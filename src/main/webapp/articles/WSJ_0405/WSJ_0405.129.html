	<p class="article-leader">TROUBLED TIMES mean big business for bankruptcy
specialists and others.
   Business activity has shifted to "the dark side of the
planet," says bankruptcy lawyer Brad Scheler of Fried, Frank,
Harris, Shriver & Jacobson. "Everybody believes that
bankruptcy and workouts are the current rage," prompting a
lot of people to develop products tailored to this market. He
has a seven-inch file filled with fliers and letters from
companies offering such services. Among them: accountants,
liquidators, software companies, consultants and appraisal
firms.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consultant Claudia King & Associates, Jersey City, N.J.,
which specializes in software for handling Chapter 11
paperwork, has doubled its staff in the past year. "We're
probably busier than we've ever been," says New York-based
turnaround specialist Abe Getzler, a 20-year veteran. He's
become "selective" about clients.</p>
<p>Fueling the growth: a population that is "less reluctant"
to resort to the bankruptcy court, says New Jersey bankruptcy
attorney Peter Sarasohn.</p>
<p>U.S. THEATERS boast impressive gains, but fear coming
cutbacks.</p>
<p>A survey of 192 nonprofit professional companies shows
"unprecedented" financial and audience growth in 1989, says
Barbara Janowitz of the Theatre Communications Group. "Earned
income, operating expenses and contributed income all
registered double-digit growth in 1989." But hidden in those
figures are some real problems, she says, noting that some
half dozen theaters have closed in the past nine months.</p>
<p>Survivors are girding for possible erosion in their
corporate and government support. Crossroads Theatre Co., New
Brunswick, N.J., is facing "some pretty serious cuts" due to
the state's current fiscal crunch, says Andre Robinson Jr.,
general manager. Competition for foundation dollars from the
homeless and other causes will make 1990-91 feel a bit
tighter, says Barry Grove of the Manhattan Theatre Club.
Hartford Stage Co. plans larger ticket price increases
because individual support is one area "we've got some
control over," says managing director David Hawkanson.</p>
<p>PROFIT GYRATIONS are likely under future accounting rules.</p>
<p>The Financial Accounting Standards Board has launched a
controversial project to more accurately value financial
instruments -- ranging from debt swaps to stock options.
"Seeking latest values -- called marking to market -- could
sharply boost earnings volatility," says a Citicorp official.
The project follows recent woes of banks and thrifts, whose
financial reports didn't give enough warning of coming
problems.</p>
<p>Some corporate critics say the change may confuse rather
than help investors. But Halsey Bullen, an FASB project
manager, says up-to-date tags for financial instruments
"better reflect current rapidly changing unstable financial
markets." A first step: a just-issued FASB rule requiring
worst-case scenarios on credit risks. Some banks already call
it "overalarming disclosure." Bankers Trust's maximum
exposure of $6.5 billion on currency and interest rate swaps,
for example, dwarfs 1989 profit of $620 million after
foreign-loan set-asides.</p>
<p>The reason: It "assumes all parties won't pay up," says
the bank's controller Richard Carbone.</p>
<p>SMOKELESS SLOPES: Tobacco companies won't be sponsoring
any more events on Aspen Skiing Co. mountains. Says Robert
Maynard, president, such corporate sponsorship isn't
"consistent with a healthy family sport like skiing."</p>
<p>CAPITAL SPENDING will slip in 1990, according to a Dun &
Bradstreet Corp. survey. Some 41% of companies said they'll
boost spending on plants and equipment, down from 46% last
year. But plans don't mean action. Last year only 23.3%
actually expanded their capital program.</p>
<p>BLEACHER BUSINESS: Houston Astros season-ticket holders
can now wheel and deal from the ballpark. Houston Cellular
Telephone Co. will take a phone message, then cart a cellular
phone to the fan's seat, along with a portable fax machine
and a laptop computer.</p>
<p>TRANSLATE THIS, more firms say, as their marketing crosses
more borders.</p>
<p>The number of translators is growing as American business
learns to deal with "a world in which America is no longer
the predominant economic power," says Tom Snow, a New York
translator. One area of big demand: translations of Japanese
patent applications into English, says Deanna Hammond of the
American Translators Association, Ossining, N.Y. Translation
of U.S. ads into European languages is also a growing market
as 1992 Common Market integration nears, says Translation
Aces, N.Y.</p>
<p>Changes in Eastern Europe are just beginning to hit the
translation market. Accurapid Translation Services Inc.,
Poughkeepsie, N.Y., is asked to translate Hungarian balance
sheets and other corporate data for U.S. investors. High-tech
vocabulary makes the job tougher. It's growing so fast "it's
difficult to stay abreast of all the language changes," says
Shuckran Kamal, Herndon, Va., translator of Arabic.</p>
<p>As demand grows, translators begin to organize, lobbying
on phone rates and other matters affecting their business.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: "The Conative Connection" by Kathy Kolbe shows up
on the Denver Post's best seller list as "The Cognitive
Collection." . . . The swimming pool is the most important
factor in selecting a vacation hotel, say 72% of children in
a survey for Holiday Inn.</p>
