	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Most stock portfolio managers lost money in
the first quarter for their worst performance since the 1987
stock market crash. But managers buying growth and small
stocks fared better than the pack.
   Investment managers lost an average of 3.2% on their stock
portfolios in the first quarter, according to performance
figures for 514 managers compiled by CDA Investment
Technologies Inc., Rockville, Md. That put the money managers
slightly behind the overall stock market, as measured by the
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which retreated 3% in the
first three months of the year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most money managers have trouble beating the S&P-500 over
the years. But it is particularly embarrassing when the
professionals lose money for their clients. Prior to the
first quarter, stock managers last showed a decline in the
1988 third quarter, when portfolio values fell a negligible
0.2% on average. In the crash-ravaged 1987 fourth quarter,
managers' stock portfolios slumped an average of 24.1%, CDA
said.</p>
<p>Many managers were hurt by the weakness in the first
quarter of stocks with large stock-market capitalizations.
Lower earnings and the end of the junk-bond financed takeover
boom took their toll on big stocks. That continued a trend
begun last year when many small stocks and growth stocks
began to shine.</p>
<p>Tiger Management Corp. in New York, which has concentrated
its stock-picking in the growth-stock sector, was one of the
quarter's top-rated companies, with a 3.6% return. "We've
normally been kind of value players in buying cheap stocks,"
says Julian H. Robertson Jr., Tiger's president. "But we
think right now the most reasonable area has been the
conventional growth stocks, where you can buy the stock at a
lower {price-earnings} multiple than its growth rate," he
says.</p>
<p>"If a company's earnings are growing 25% a year, and you
can buy {it} for 20 times earnings, you're almost
automatically bailed out if you're right about the growth
rate," he says.</p>
<p>Profitable stocks for Tiger, which has $740 million under
management, included Federal Express Corp., Deere & Co.,
Mattel Inc., Nike Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. "We did all
this without any real exposure to technology, and they were
the best stocks in the first quarter," Mr. Robertson says.</p>
<p>Tiger also profited by anticipating the fall in the Tokyo
stock market. The company sold Japanese stocks short and held
puts on the Nikkei stock index, which became more valuable as
Tokyo stocks fell. In a short sale, an investor sells
borrowed shares, hoping to profit by replacing them later
with stock bought at lower prices.</p>
<p>Because of those foreign investments, Tiger's
first-quarter performance was actually better than that
recorded by CDA, which excludes foreign securities.</p>
<p>"We're still short," said Mr. Robertson of the Tokyo
market. "What has happened so far has only been a
correction." He added that he had expected the Japanese
decline long before it came.</p>
<p>While Tiger avoided technology stocks in the first
quarter, another top performer, Amerindo U.S. Advisors Inc.,
buys nothing but electronic and biotechnology stocks, and
only small ones at that. The Lakespur, Calif., company that
manages about $438 million, follows an investment style of
buying stocks at their initial public offerings and selling
them when the companies reach annual sales of $300 million.</p>
<p>"Shares of smaller technology stocks are still vastly
undervalued by all historical valuation standards," says Gary
A. Tanaka, who co-founded the company with Albert Vilar in
1979.</p>
<p>In the biotechnology area, Mr. Tanaka expects that
"breakthroughs will revolutionize the health-care field,
culminating in sizable sales and earnings." Among the
company's holdings are Centocor Inc., Sequent Computer
Systems Inc., SynOptics Communications Inc. and Parametric
Technology Corp.</p>
<p>Wasatch Advisors Inc. of Salt Lake City, another
small-stock manager that did well in the first quarter,
thinks that small stocks have finally turned the corner,
after being out of favor for much of the 1980s, says Vice
President Jeff Cardon. Founded in 1976 and now with $100
million under management, Wasatch invests only in small
stocks.</p>
<p>Mr. Cardon likes Loewen Group Inc., a Vancouver, British
Columbia, company that is the second-largest operator of
funeral homes in North America. He favors the company, whose
stock is traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, because of its
growth opportunities and noncyclical nature.</p>
<p>"There are 20,000 funeral homes in North America, and
these guys are No. 2 {among chains} with less than 200
{homes}," he says. "It has no exposure to the economy
obviously," he adds.</p>
<p>Another favorite is Seattle-based Washington Federal
Savings & Loan, which Mr. Cardon calls "the best managed
company in our portfolio." As such, he says it can profit
from acquiring troubled S&Ls. In addition, management's
"dividend income from their stock is higher than their
salaries," he says. "That's a great incentive."</p>
<p>Friess Associates Inc., another top-rated company using a
growth-stock strategy, says it has done well by avoiding
those stocks with high price-earnings multiples. "We miss the
Wal-Marts, but for every Wal-Mart, we also missed a number of
shin-kickings," says Foster Friess, head of the company,
which has nearly $1 billion under management.</p>
<p>Among the company's current holdings is L.A. Gear Inc.;
Mr. Friess says "the stock price has been a roller coaster,
but the earnings haven't." Other holdings include Adobe
Systems Inc., Conner Peripherals Inc. and Dayton Hudson Corp.
Mr. Friess says he is "quite conservative" about the overall
stock market, however, keeping about 15% of the company's
assets in cash, instead of the normal 6%.</p>
<p>CDA compiles performance data based on reports that money
managers are required to file quarterly with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Because of gaps in the filings, the
data aren't precise. CDA assumes, for example, that the
stocks held at the start of the quarter are kept in the
managers' portfolios for the entire quarter. Cash holdings,
bonds, convertible securities and foreign issues aren't
included. Fees and the various levels of risk that the
managers took to achieve their results also aren't
considered.</p>
