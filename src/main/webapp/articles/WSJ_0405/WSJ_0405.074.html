	<p class="article-leader">ROME -- Italy is ready to lift its last remaining
restrictions on capital flows by the end of this month,
monetary officials here said.
   The action would allow Italian residents to open savings
and checking accounts abroad and hold foreign-currency
accounts in Italy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the European Community deadline for the first stage
of monetary union, member states must lift all capital-flow
restrictions by July 1, and Italy is the last of the major
countries to do so. Monetary officials here say the
government now is prepared to act in the next few weeks -- in
advance of May 6 local elections -- rather than wait for the
EC deadline.</p>
<p>"The decision to remove remaining restrictions on capital
movements is imminent," Carlo Ciampi, the Bank of Italy
governor, said in a speech to businessmen. The action, he
said, would conclude "the `long march' of our economy toward
the objective of full freedom of capital without sacrificing
exchange-rate stability."</p>
<p>Citing a strong, stable lira and high domestic interest
rates, officials expressed confidence that the end of
controls wouldn't lead to a big outflow of savings, as once
was feared.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, monetary and other officials generally agree
that a reduction in the 30% withholding tax on bank interest
earnings will be necessary to minimize the transfer of
savings to foreign-currency accounts. Italy's central bank
wants to cut that tax rate to 20%; others in government want
a more modest initial cut -- to 25%.</p>
