	<h3>You Can Slice It, Dice It or Ice It, But to Some It'll Still Be the Pits</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">President Bush has raised a ruckus over his dislike for
broccoli. If he feels the same way about watermelon, he'd
better keep quiet.
   Watermelon growers are already in such a lather over what
they think is an unfair reputation for their hefty fruit that
they've mounted a campaign to improve its image.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's not that they taste bad," says C.M. Buddy Leger,
president of the newly formed National Watermelon Board. "We
have fallen down on the job and not promoted our product."
The growers assert that it's the negative image, not the
product, that has led to a 41% decline in watermelon
consumption since 1960.</p>
<p>"Watermelons have a low profile," agrees Jeff Manning,
senior vice president of Ketchum Advertising U.S. in San
Francisco, which has developed promotional campaigns for such
competitors as bananas, strawberries and prunes.</p>
<p>Undaunted and ready to fight back, the growers have hired
the Seattle advertising agency of Evans/Kraft to give their
fruit a new look.</p>
<p>It won't be easy.</p>
<p>For starters, promotional dollars are limited. Funds for
the campaign will be collected by charging both growers and
distributors two cents per hundredweight of watermelon sold.
That will bring in about $1 million the first year.</p>
<p>Then, too, there's the sheer size and weight of the big
melons. Retailers don't give them the display they deserve,
growers complain. Consumers, meanwhile, disdain lugging the
heavy things home.</p>
<p>And don't forget those pesky pits.</p>
<p>Still, watermelon growers figure that if other fruits and
vegetables can overcome the public's disdain, theirs can,
too. "Potatoes were perceived as fattening. It took us 10
years to overcome that," Mr. Manning says.</p>
<p>Prunes, too, have done an about-face. "People used to
giggle," he says. "Now it's seen as a source of fiber, and
that gave us credibility."</p>
<p>So his advice is to widen the fruit's following outside
Fourth of July picnics. "The perception is that you eat it
when it's 90 degrees and you're sitting by a lake," Mr.
Manning says.</p>
<p>Still the easiest way to the top of the fruit basket could
be to follow the lead of the California raisins: Hire a
choreographer and rent some spiffy costumes. "That would be
nice for watermelons," says Mr. Leger. "But we can't afford
that."</p>
