	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Hubble space telescope, poised to be
launched by the space shuttle Discovery Tuesday, promises to
be one of science's proudest achievements. It will hunt for
black holes and help explain the birth of galaxies.
   It's also an example of Big Science gone bad.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The $1.54 billion telescope is at least seven years behind
schedule, $1 billion over budget and doesn't work as well as
expected. The reasons for that are more political than
scientific. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
underestimated the telescope's price to win congressional
approval. Then the agency drove up the cost and complexity by
tying the telescope to the space shuttle, and using the
project to stave off layoffs.</p>
<p>"We've been rolled too many times by megascience
projects," complains Rep. Bob Traxler, the Michigan Democrat
who heads the appropriations panel overseeing NASA. "They
develop a constituency and keep going, no matter what the
cost." In the past month, for instance, the Energy Department
increased the price of its superconducting supercollider
one-third to about $8 billion, and NASA engineers warned that
the $30 billion space station faces costly design changes.</p>
<p>The space telescope is a case study in how science
projects get out of hand. From the beginning, astronomers and
NASA managers prized salesmanship as much as science. "A NASA
mission gets started by advertising the potential of an
idea," says Robert Brown, an astronomer who spent two years
as the space telescope's chief scientist. "Then you solve the
problems you find."</p>
<p>NASA's biggest problem in the 1970s, when the agency
started selling and building the space telescope, was a lack
of political support. The agency was desperately trying to
line up backing for the space shuttle and fend off attempts
to close its big Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,
Ala. The space telescope was designed to aid both efforts --
even though the cost to the program proved to be
considerable.</p>
<p>Promoting the shuttle was the key. NASA designed the
telescope so it could be launched into orbit and serviced by
the shuttle, giving the shuttle a prominent role in space
science. Shuttle servicing also gave NASA a rationale to
slash the telescope's price tag so it would pass muster with
Congress. NASA could dispense with plans for costly testing
by promising to lug the telescope back from space and fix it
on the ground if anything important broke.</p>
<p>"It was a political plus to use the shuttle," says Noel
Hinners, a former NASA science official who pushed the
telescope through Congress by citing the shuttle's technical
merits, too. But years after winning approval of the
telescope, NASA dropped its plans to haul the satellite back
to Earth -- fearing that the extra handling could harm the
instrument.</p>
<p>NASA kept its plans for in-orbit servicing, but that led
to other problems. Designing the telescope so it would be
safe for astronauts to work on in space increased costs
sharply. The Challenger shuttle disaster in 1986 delayed the
telescope's launch by three years. Meanwhile, the orbit the
shuttle can reach -- about 350 miles above the ground -- is
so low that Earth blocks the telescope's view 40% of the
time. Overall, the space telescope will spend only one-third
of its time making observations, just slighty better than an
Earth-bound telescope, which can only work at night.</p>
<p>Internal NASA politics also set back the space telescope.
NASA split the project between the Marshall facility, which
the White House was threatening to close, and the agency's
traditional astronomy center, Goddard Space Flight Center, in
Greenbelt, Md. The two centers fought regularly over testing
and design issues, say scientists involved in the project,
while the telescope fell behind schedule and its cost
escalated.</p>
<p>Marshall also was forced by the Pentagon to limit the
number of managers it assigned to oversee the telescope. The
military feared that too many civilians would learn about
technology useful for spy satellites, says Robert Smith, a
Smithsonian Institution historian who has written a book
about the telescope. As a result of these tussles, says Mr.
Smith, NASA managers didn't catch engineering problems early
enough.</p>
<p>Now, in some important respects, the telescope isn't as
good as advertised. Its ground-based computer system is
woefully inefficient, says C.R. O'Dell, a former telescope
chief scientist, who estimates that his observing time on the
telescope has been cut nearly in half because of the problem.
Scientists say the telescope's tracking system isn't quick
enough to follow storm systems on nearby planets, which
scientists want to study to help learn more about hurricanes
on Earth. Its parts are aging.</p>
<p>The project's huge budget also led NASA to rule out
smaller missions that it could have launched sooner. If NASA
had built a smaller, cheaper telescope, "many of the
discoveries that {Hubble} will make might have been made 10
years earlier," writes Freeman Dyson, a physicist at the
Institute for Advanced Studies, in the astronomy magazine
"Sky & Telescope."</p>
<p>NASA officials believe that the launch of the space
telescope will silence the critics. Lennard Fisk, the
agency's space-science chief, says shuttle servicing will
enable NASA to update the telescope's instruments and repair
it if anything goes wrong. Edward Weiler, a NASA
space-telescope scientist, says the instrument "represents
the biggest leap in astronomical capability since Galileo put
a telescope to his eye."</p>
<p>But a little skepticism is in order. In his book, "The
Space Telescope," Mr. Smith recounts an exchange a few years
back between James Beggs, who then headed NASA, and Rep.
Edward Boland, the Massachusetts Democrat who then headed the
appropriations subcommittee responsible for the agency.</p>
<p>"The space telescope will be the eighth wonder of the
world," boasted the NASA administrator.</p>
<p>"It ought to be at that price," replied the lawmaker.</p>
