	<p class="article-leader">"Fed Has Lost Much of Its Power to Sway U.S. Interest
Rates" reads the headline on your March 12 page-one story.
Truth to tell, the Fed never had much power to sway U.S.
interest rates.
   The Fed can control directly one thing and one thing only:
the amount of high-powered money or the monetary base
(currency plus deposits at Federal Reserve). Changes in the
base in turn affect interest rates, broader monetary
aggregates and, through them, inflation, economic activity
and exchange rates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If it chooses to do so, the Fed can use its control over
the base to peg a particular interest rate such as the
federal funds rate. But if it does so, it must accept
whatever happens to other magnitudes affected by the base,
including the level of inflation. That means that, while the
Fed can peg or control the nominal federal funds rate, it
cannot control the real rate (i.e., the nominal rate minus
the rate of inflation). Similarly, it cannot control both the
federal funds rate and the long-term rate.</p>
<p>Capital markets have long been linked internationally, and
that has tended to make real interest rates in different
countries tend toward roughly the same level. But nominal
rates are a different matter, since they reflect anticipated
movements in exchange rates, which in turn are linked to
anticipated rates of inflation in different countries.</p>
<p>So long as exchange rates are free to float, the Fed has
as much control over the monetary base as it ever did, and
can, if it wishes, use that control as readily as it ever
could to target any one of a range of nominal magnitudes,
including the federal funds rate and the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>The inflation of the 1970s did not arise because of the
Fed's impotence, but because it repeatedly chose to use its
control of the monetary base to hold down the federal funds
rate to levels that generated excessive increases in monetary
aggregates. The inevitable result was sky-high interest rates
-- hardly the result the Fed intended. Fortunately, the Fed
has learned from that experience and is not likely to repeat
that mistake.</p>
