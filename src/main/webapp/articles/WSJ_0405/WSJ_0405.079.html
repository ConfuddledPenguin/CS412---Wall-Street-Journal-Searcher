	<p class="article-leader">PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Hewlett-Packard Co. said it
established a research laboratory in Tokyo.
   The Japanese laboratory will focus on applied research in
integrated circuit testing, photonics and low-temperature
electronic devices. Most of the research staff will be hired
locally, Hewlett-Packard said. The staff will work with other
company scientists and engineers, as well as visiting
scientists and professors, to develop technology for
Hewlett-Packard.</p>
