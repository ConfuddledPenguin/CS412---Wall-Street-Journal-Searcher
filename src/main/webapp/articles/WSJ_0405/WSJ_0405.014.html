	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Axel Springer Verlag AG, hoping to build on
its foothold in U.S. publishing, will introduce today a
redesigned and expanded Medical Tribune, the national
newspaper for physicians.
   The West German publisher bought the Medical Tribune in
August from the family of its founder, the late Arthur
Sackler, for an estimated $80 million. Medical Tribune was
the first acquisition in the U.S. by Axel Springer, one of
the largest newspaper publishers in Europe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Axel Springer, as of this week's issue, converted the
publication from a tabloid into a broadsheet and expanded its
editorial matter to include life style features as well as
clinical news. Published now every two weeks with editions in
Japan, France, and West Germany, Medical Tribune will become
a weekly in early 1991, said Richard Dauncey, president of
Medical Tribune.</p>
<p>"We want to bridge the gap between the physicians'
professional and private lives," said Mr. Dauncey. Axel
Springer has spent about $8 million revamping the newspaper,
which has U.S. circulation of about 125,000. "We go from
clinical news to matters of cultural significance."</p>
<p>In a related development, Axel Springer is expected to
launch more U.S. publications in the medical field. A
consumer magazine called Family Health, now being tested in
the U.K. by Axel Springer, may also be launched in the U.S.
within a year, Mr. Dauncey said.</p>
<p>Axel Springer is tapping a lucrative advertising market. A
large number of publications vie for about $420 million in
pharmaceutical and medical-related advertising. The
readership is potentially large also, with an estimated
500,000 physicians in the U.S. alone.</p>
<p>But even Axel Springer executives acknowledge they are
expanding Medical Tribune during a depressed period.
Advertising revenue for pharmaceuticals fell about 30% in the
first quarter, said Mr. Dauncey.</p>
<p>"The U.S. publication is an important part of our becoming
a world-wide provider of medical news," said Helmut Fluhrer,
Axel Springer project manager for mergers and acquisitions.
News from "the medical industry in the U.S. is vitally
important to other countries," he said.</p>
