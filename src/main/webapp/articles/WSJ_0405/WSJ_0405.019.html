	<p class="article-leader">COLUMBUS, Ohio -- American Electric Power Co. said it
agreed with the U.S. Department of Energy to share the $660
million cost of building a commercial-scale pressurized
fluidized bed combustion unit.
   The Energy Department will provide $185 million of the
cost for the unit, which burns coal more efficiently and with
less polluting emissions than standard boilers. American
Electric will provide the remaining funds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The technology hasn't previously been employed in
full-scale utility plants in North America, American Electric
said. Fluidized bed plants burn pulverized coal in the
presence of limestone, which removes most of the sulphur
dioxide, and lower operating temperatures reduce emissions of
nitrogen oxides. Those compounds are responsible for acid
rain and other pollution problems.</p>
<p>Preliminary engineering design for the facility is under
way, American Electric said. The study includes a detailed
evaluation of repowering a unit at the utility's Philip Sporn
generating plant in New Haven, W.Va., with a 330,000-kilowatt
fluidized bed combustion unit, or building a completely new
facility, the company said.</p>
<p>A fluidized bed unit at the Sporn plant would start
commercial operation in 1996, American Electric said, but
additional environmental studies would delay start-up of a
completely new facility until 1998.</p>
<p>American Electric this year will begin operating a
70,000-kilowatt unit employing the new technology at a
mothballed generating plant in Brilliant, Ohio. That unit is
a joint project with the Energy Department and the Ohio Coal
Development Office, a state agency.</p>
