	<p class="article-leader">CANADIAN TIRE Corp. said it plans to issue 150 million
Canadian dollars (US$128.7 million) of 12.1% debentures due
2010. The Toronto-based retailer said Wood Gundy Inc., Gordon
Capital Corp. and Burns Fry Ltd. have agreed to purchase the
issue around May 10. The company said it would file a
preliminary prospectus with all the Canadian provinces in the
next few days. The company said net proceeds will be used to
repay short-term debt and to fund capital expenditures.</p>
