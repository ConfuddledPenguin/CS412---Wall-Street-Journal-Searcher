	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of New England said it will reduce its work
force by 5,600 employees, or about one-third, but the
troubled bank-holding company acknowledged that it faces
further increases in nonperforming assets and loan-loss
provisions.
   The staffing reduction, which had been expected, includes
about 1,700 layoffs. Attrition, consolidations and asset
sales will account for most of the rest, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lawrence Fish, chairman and chief executive officer, said
in an interview that executive vice presidents and senior
vice presidents were among those laid off, but he declined to
identify individuals or say precisely how many senior
officers will be let go.</p>
<p>The company said personnel cutbacks, asset sales and other
measures are expected to reduce annual operating expenses by
about $300 million when fully implemented.</p>
<p>But the reductions will also carry a big price tag. In its
10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
company noted that severance costs and other one-time
expenses, along with "likely additions to the provision for
credit losses . . . may further deplete capital and equity in
the future." The company is under orders from federal
regulators to improve its capital ratios.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Bank
of New England's stock fell 37.5 cents, to $4.25, on volume
of 903,300 shares.</p>
<p>In its filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Bank of New England said a continuing review of its loan
portfolio is expected to result in an increase in
nonperforming assets from the Dec. 31 level of $2.2 billion.
It noted that the year-end total didn't include some $1
billion of loans that were still performing at year end, "but
where borrowers, in management's opinion, were experiencing
some financial difficulty."</p>
<p>The year-end allowance of $1.5 billion for possible credit
losses did include "a substantial unallocated provision to
reflect" the potential problem loans, according to the
filing. Mr. Fish declined to estimate the first-quarter
increase in nonperforming assets or loss provisions. Bank of
New England's assets currently total $25 billion.</p>
<p>The SEC filing also indicated that the company's capital
plan, to be submitted to regulators by tomorrow, could
include an exchange offer for all or part of the company's
$706 million in long-term debt. Mr. Fish stressed, however,
that the initial plan would consist of a broad list of
possible measures -- not a final blueprint. He declined to
say what form a swap offer for the debt might take, although
the filing noted that such an exchange "could have a dilutive
effect on shareholders' equity."</p>
<p>A small, New York-based investment banking firm that
claims to represent 40 institutional holders of about $200
million, or around 30%, of Bank of New England's long-term
debt, said it sent a letter to Mr. Fish yesterday renewing
requests for a meeting with bank officials.</p>
<p>"Our group would view an attempt by {the company} to
unilaterally demand a compromise of its debt or a conversion
into common stock with a great deal of suspicion in view of
the total lack of communication {by} the company to date,"
wrote John Mueller, vice president of Whitman Heffernan Rhein
& Co., according to a copy of the letter supplied by the
firm. He added, however, "Our group may be willing to make
certain sacrifices to make the company financially viable {if
we have} an opportunity to evaluate all of the alternatives."</p>
<p>The letter also noted "persistent rumors that a
change-of-control transaction, possibly involving regulatory
assistance and a compromising of the debt, is being
negotiated with a West German financial institution." Bank of
New England has declined to comment on such rumors, which
have surfaced periodically since January.</p>
<p>Bank of New England, in its filing, said its capital plan
may also include the sale of the company's Maine and Rhode
Island subsidiary banks. Possible sale of its large
Connecticut bank wasn't mentioned.</p>
<p>The company also disclosed that one creditor, Penn Mutual
Life Insurance Co., has sued for alleged breach of covenant.
Penn Mutual, which holds a $10 million, 14% note due in 1996
from Bank of New England's BNE Massachusetts Corp.
subsidiary, has charged in U.S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania that Bank of New England's
asset-sales program breached a covenant concerning the sale
of assets. The lawsuit also alleges breaches of information
and other covenants, according to Bank of New England, which
said it believes it has "meritorious defenses to the claims."</p>
<p>The suit seeks recovery of the $10 million in principal,
accrued interest, a $255,000 premium and expenses. Bank of
New England said payment of the note is current, with
interest having been paid when due. Principal is payable in
$1,430,000 installments on each July 15 from 1990 through
1996.</p>
