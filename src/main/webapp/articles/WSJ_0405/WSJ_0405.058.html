	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Labor Committee approved
comprehensive legislation aimed at overturning the effect of
several Supreme Court decisions handed down last year that
made job bias harder to prove.
   GOP Sens. David Durenberger of Minnesota and James
Jeffords of Vermont joined the panel's nine Democrats to pass
the measure on an 11-5 vote after rejecting attempts by Sen.
Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) to weaken it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sen. Hatch, the panel's ranking GOP member, indicated he
would offer other amendments when the bill is considered by
the full Senate, probably next month. A similar bill is
pending in the House.</p>
<p>"It is no mere overturning of a few Supreme Court
decisions," Sen. Hatch said. "It is, in my view, a radical
reworking of our nation's basic employment
anti-discrimination law."</p>
<p>The measure, the top legislative priority of civil-rights
groups this year, is opposed by the Bush administration and
conservative policy groups, who say it would result in hiring
quotas and reverse discrimination.</p>
<p>Lawmakers voted, 12-4, to defeat Mr. Hatch's attempt to
exempt health and safety rules from a provision that would
force employers to justify employment practices shown to have
a discriminatory impact. Committee Chairman Edward Kennedy
(D., Mass.) charged that the change would give employers
"carte blanche to adopt practices that have kept women and
minorities from fully participating under the guise of health
and safety."</p>
<p>The committee also rejected, 11-5, a Hatch amendment that
would have expanded the circumstances under which co-workers
could challenge court-approved affirmative-action plans
agreed upon by employers and minority or women employees.</p>
<p>Last year, Mr. Bush said legislation wasn't necessary to
respond to the court's decisions. But after a coalition of
Democrats and moderate Republicans introduced legislation in
February, the Justice Department prepared a more modest
measure that would address some of the same concerns.</p>
<p>The lawmakers' bill has been crafted to avoid addressing a
contentious high court ruling that barred the use of racial
quotas in state and local government affirmative-action
programs.</p>
<p>The measure approved by the committee would:</p>
<p>-- Specify that an 1866 civil-rights law, giving all
citizens equal rights to make contracts, covers lawsuits
alleging racial harassment on the job.</p>
<p>-- Allow workers to challenge alleged discriminatory
seniority plans when those plans affect them, rather than
when they are adopted.</p>
<p>-- Force employers to justify employment practices shown
to have a discriminatory impact.</p>
<p>-- Protect court-approved affirmative-action plans agreed
upon by employers and minority or women employees by
permitting only under certain circumstances lawsuits by
co-workers claiming reverse discrimination.</p>
<p>-- Make clear that it is illegal to make any employment
decisions based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion.</p>
<p>-- Assure victims of intentional bias the right to seek
monetary damages.</p>
