	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The good news is, the average stock fund beat
the market for the first time in two years.
   The bad news is, the average fund investor still lost
money.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Basically, everything got hammered" in the first quarter,
says Kurt Brouwer, a San Francisco fund analyst. "There
haven't been many times in the last 15 or 20 years when
everything went down. Bonds were down, global funds were
down, equity funds were down, gold was down. There was
nowhere to run."</p>
<p>The disappointing quarter left stock funds ahead 13.33%
for the 12 months through March.</p>
<p>Only two fund categories, science and technology funds and
Europe funds, posted gains in the latest quarterly rankings
compiled by Lipper Analytical Services Inc. All other fund
groups were unprofitable.</p>
<p>Overall, general equity funds lost an average of 2.31%,
slightly better for investors than the loss of 3.01% for the
Standard & Poor's 500 stock market index. Lipper's figures
are total returns -- price changes plus dividends.</p>
<p>"The 1980s were something of a binge," says A. Michael
Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. "If this is the
extent of the revenge, I'll take it. There are two ways you
can correct enthusiasm; one is a hard landing, the other is a
soft correction."</p>
<p>So far, says Mr. Lipper, all the signs point to the less
drastic "soft" setback. This period was the second
consecutive quarter of very slight losses by stock funds; in
the fourth quarter of 1989, the funds were down 1.2%.</p>
<p>The averages disguise the big hit taken by funds
specializing in the Pacific region, which were knocked down
more than 13%. Merrill Pacific and Scudder's Japan Fund,
which have some of the industry's best 10-year records, were
among the quarter's biggest losers.</p>
<p>Also hard hit were the high-yield, junk-bond funds, which
now account for 16 of the past year's 25 worst performing
funds. Battered junk funds dragged down the average for all
longer-term, taxable bond funds, which lost 1.4% in the
quarter. But in March, says Mr. Lipper, some junk funds did
post gains.</p>
<p>Roger McNamee, who runs the T. Rowe Price Science &
Technology Fund, was one of the few fund managers with
anything to cheer about. His fund posted a gain of almost 5%,
driven, he says, by a rebound in small companies generally,
and technology stocks in particular.</p>
<p>"In our area, we've gone through a seven-year period when
smaller stocks, and especially small growth stocks, have
consistently underperformed the market," says Mr. McNamee.
"In the process, valuations have become very reasonable. You
can tell that in our business, because it's become easier to
find good ideas."</p>
<p>Small company funds lost 1.39% in the quarter, the
smallest loss for any category of general equity fund. But,
warns Mr. Lipper, "the overall numbers are small, and these
distinctions may not be meaningful."</p>
<p>A star mutual fund manager isn't identified solely by good
long-term performance. Strength in a weak market is also a
key attribute. Gintel Fund and Brandywine Fund, two of the
industry's better-known stock funds, looked good on that
score.</p>
<p>Brandywine, managed by Foster Friess, was up almost 6% in
the quarter, driven by technology holdings and by big
positions in L.A. Gear Inc. and Nike Inc., which both posted
strong earnings gains.</p>
<p>Robert Gintel, manager of the Gintel Fund, has tended to
concentrate his fund in just a few stocks. The fund's largest
position, at 23% of assets, is Deere & Co., whose shares
posted an 18% gain in the quarter. The fund's second-largest
position, Phelps Dodge, was up 3%. Those two gains, plus a
25% cash position, helped the fund to a 5% gain in the
period.</p>
<p>The U.S.'s largest stock fund, Fidelity Magellan, beat the
average stock fund, though the fund posted a loss of 2.1%.
The news for other large, well-known funds was more
disappointing. John Neff's Windsor Fund and Michael Price's
Mutual Shares, both of which tend to do well in down markets,
saw their sluggish 1989 performance continue into this year's
first quarter.</p>
