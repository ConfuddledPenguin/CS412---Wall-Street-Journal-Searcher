	<p class="article-leader">MENLO PARK, Calif. -- Raychem Corp. said it would take a
charge of up to $90 million in its third quarter, which will
cause a loss for the fiscal year. The charge will cover
severance payments, management consolidations and certain
expenses associated with divestitures.
   Raychem said excluding the one-time charge and taxes,
results in the quarter ended March 31 were at about the
break-even level, reflecting a larger-than-expected drop in
its defense business. Sales were about 5% above the
year-earlier quarter's level of $270 million "in constant
currency," Raychem said. A spokesman said that since about
60% of sales come from international markets, currency
fluctuations could change final sales results.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Raychem makes aerospace, automotive, electronics and
telecommunications products. Its stock closed yesterday at
$27.75, down 25 cents, in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>In the year-earlier third quarter, Raychem took a one-time
charge of $10.7 million for certain programs intended to
"improve corporate efficiency." In that quarter, Raychem
posted net income of $2.4 million, or seven cents a share
fully diluted, down 92% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Raychem has seen several quarters of declining profits,
which the company has blamed, in part, on losses from its
Raynet unit. That unit, which designs fiber-optics systems,
is still developing products and markets. A spokesman said
Raynet is expected to cost the company about $60 million this
fiscal year, ending June 30. However, Raychem said it
"remains fully committed" to the Raynet unit, where
technology trials now under way are showing "encouraging
results."</p>
<p>The company will cut its work force by 8%, dismissing 900
workers to reduce staff to about 10,500. Raychem also said it
will consolidate certain management and administrative jobs,
and sell undeveloped land in Menlo Park, Calif. Raychem said
it plans to acquire manufacturing sites in other,
less-expensive parts of the U.S.</p>
<p>In addition, Raychem plans to sell its Advanced Packaging
Systems division, which makes products to enhance
communications among integrated circuits, and much of its
shape memory alloy business, which makes metals for the
aerospace industry.</p>
<p>Raychem said the moves are intended to reduce ongoing
expenses but a spokesman wouldn't estimate how much money
will be saved. Raychem said once the moves are implemented,
it expects the costs to be recovered over two to three years.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1989, the company
posted net income of $36.3 million, or $1.02 a fully diluted
share, on sales of $1.08 billion.</p>
