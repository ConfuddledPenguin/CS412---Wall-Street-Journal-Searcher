	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade, citing volatility in foreign stock markets,
raised margin requirements for their stock-index-futures
contracts, effective Monday.
   A Merc spokesman said it was the first time the exchange
was raising margins in response to movements in foreign
markets rather than volatility in one of its own contracts.
Sharp price declines in the Tokyo stock market in recent
weeks have led some investors to fear that a "spillover
effect" may eventually be felt in U.S. markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Futures margins are good-faith deposits required of
traders to ensure they can honor their trading obligations in
the face of anticipated day-to-day volatility in the price of
a particular contract. When daily price moves become more
volatile, margins typically are raised to account for the
increased risk.</p>
<p>The futures industry has been attacked by certain critics
for its relatively low margin levels compared with the stock
market, where margins are 50% of a stock's value. A margin
payment in the stock market is an actual downpayment toward
the purchase of a stock, rather than a good-faith deposit. In
both markets, margin money represents the amount of upfront
cash a speculator needs to bet on the near-term direction of
stock or futures prices.</p>
<p>The Merc, whose Standard & Poor's 500 stock-index-futures
contract accounts for more than 75% of all
stock-index-futures trading, raised margins for speculators
trading S&P 500 futures to $20,000 a contract, or nearly 12%
of the contract's face value. The previous speculative margin
had been set at $17,500, or slightly more than 10% of the
contract value.</p>
<p>Trading in the Board of Trade's Major Market index
accounts for a much smaller share of stock-index-futures
trading volume. That exchange raised speculative margins
effective Monday to $20,000 a contract, or nearly 15% of
contact value, from $13,000, or 9.5% of the contract value.</p>
