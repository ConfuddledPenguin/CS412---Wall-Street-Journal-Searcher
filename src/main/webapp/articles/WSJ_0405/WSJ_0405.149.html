	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- CrossLand Savings agreed to sell its five Utah
retail branches, accounting for a total $75 million of
deposits, to First Federal Savings Bank, Salt Lake City, for
cash.
   Terms weren't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CrossLand's retail banking operation has 115 offices in
eight states with a total $8.7 billion of deposits. The
Brooklyn thrift said the sale of the Utah deposits was a move
to focus on areas where it has a larger market share. It will
maintain its CrossLand Mortgage Corp. subsidiary in Salt Lake
City.</p>
<p>Conditions of the branch sale include the signing of a
definitive agreement and receipt of clearance by regulators,
and regulators may scrutinize CrossLand's proposed
divestiture. As is the case with many thrifts, CrossLand is
out of compliance with certain capital standards, and
regulators often are wary when such thrifts sell assets.</p>
<p>A spokesman for CrossLand said he believed the branches
are profitable, but "the growth potential for us hasn't been
tremendous in that market." The thrift anticipates no
regulatory objections to the sale, he added.</p>
