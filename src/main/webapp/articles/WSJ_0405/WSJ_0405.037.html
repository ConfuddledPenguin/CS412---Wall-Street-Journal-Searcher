	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- The Canadian government hopes to negotiate a
clean-air agreement with the U.S. by this autumn that will
settle Canada's longstanding grievance over U.S. acid rain
pollution, Canadian Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard
said.
   Mr. Bouchard told the House of Commons that the U.S.
Senate's approval Tuesday of a comprehensive clean-air bill
"moves us much closer to the opening of formal negotiations"
for a U.S.-Canada air quality agreement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He said U.S. and Canadian officials have met frequently in
the past year to discuss the framework and "essential
details" of such an agreement. He predicted formal
negotiations with the U.S. will begin soon and "we hope that
it will be possible to conclude an agreement by the fall."</p>
<p>The acid rain issue has been the Canadian government's
biggest grievance with the U.S. for much of the past decade.
Canada blames wind-carried pollution from the U.S. for half
of the acid rain that falls on Canada. Acid rain occurs when
gases from smokestacks and other sources combine with
moisture in the air and fall to the ground, often hundreds of
miles from the pollution source.</p>
<p>The Canadian government claims that acid rain has
destroyed fish and other life in at least 14,000 Eastern
Canadian lakes. The government says an additional 300,000
lakes are damaged or vulnerable.</p>
<p>The Canadian government has reached agreements with the
country's seven Eastern-most provinces requiring a 50%
reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by 1994. Sulfur
dioxide, which is emitted by power plants, smelters and other
sources, is ranked as the biggest single cause of acid rain.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and President Bush are
expected to discuss the acid rain issue when they meet in
Toronto on Tuesday. Soon after Mr. Bush was elected, he
assured Mr. Mulroney that the U.S. administration would take
concrete action on acid rain.</p>
<p>The proposed agreement with the U.S. would set targets for
reducing acid gas emissions. The Canadian government says
that sulfur dioxide emissions in Eastern Canada are already
down 40% from their 1980 level.</p>
<p>Wind-carried Canadian pollution accounts for 10% to 25% of
the acid rain that falls in the Northeastern U.S., Canadian
officials estimate.</p>
<p>The Canadian government and the Carter administration
agreed in 1979 to negotiate an accord to control
trans-boundary air pollution. But Ottawa wasn't able to
negotiate such a pact with the Reagan administration.</p>
