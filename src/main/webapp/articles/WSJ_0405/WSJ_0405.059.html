	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Futures contracts on the one-month London
Interbank Offer Rate (Libor) begin trading today on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The contract is designed to help banks and other
institutions better manage short-term interest rate risks.
Like the Merc's three-month Eurodollar futures contract, the
Libor contract will be cash settled. The last trading day
will be two London business days preceding the third
Wednesday of the contract month.</p>
