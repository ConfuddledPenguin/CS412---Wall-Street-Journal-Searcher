	<p class="article-leader">Victor Co. of Japan Ltd. has designed what it says is the
world's smallest and lightest super VHS video system.
   The new system, called the VHS Movie Compo, is priced at
288,000 yen ($1,806.34) a set. It will be released on Japan's
domestic market May 16, JVC said Wednesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A company official said the new system is composed of five
major parts: an S-VHS compact video deck, a video camera,
liquid crystal display monitor, TV tuner, and rechargeable
battery.</p>
<p>Because it uses a newly developed lightweight thin
mechanism, the S-VHS video recorder is 20% lighter and 40%
smaller than conventional models, yet offers high-fidelity
sound, the company said.</p>
<p>JVC plans to offer the new system in the U.S. this summer
and in Europe in the near future.</p>
