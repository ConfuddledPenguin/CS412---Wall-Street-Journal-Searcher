	<p class="article-leader">LVOV, Ukraine -- In an office lacking furniture, carpets,
posters and secretaries, Petryk Olik, a deputy to the
Ukrainian Parliament and a leader of the Ukrainian opposition
movement Rukh, is surprised when asked if he fears the
future. He begins to grin, and then laugh, his mouth
revealing the gaps left by the Soviet police who kicked in
his teeth during a demonstration last fall. "How can we be
afraid? We have the same right to independence as any other
nation."
   Near Rukh's office, a crowd gathers daily in the square
across from the Lvov opera house, built when the city was
part of Austro-Hungarian Galicia. Old women and young men
argue about politics and grab greedily at the new samizdat
newspapers, which bearded students pull out of their
backpacks. An elderly man shouts at a group of flag-waving
Estonians, telling them they have no right to interfere in
the Ukraine's own independence movement. Another man stops
him, explaining that all the republics must act together.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Three old ladies lay flowers beneath a portrait of Stefan
Bandera, the independence leader who fought with the Nazis
against Stalin. The portrait leans permanently against a
flagpole in the center of the square. The women hope a statue
to Gen. Bandera will soon be built in Lvov.</p>
<p>The portrait, normally surrounded by admirers, was left
standing alone in the square Saturday afternoon as everyone
flocked to a demonstration in support of Free Lithuania. Ten
thousand people stood holding blue and yellow Ukrainian
flags, listening to calls for an independent Ukraine to
follow an independent Lithuania.</p>
<p>A representative from Vilnius, apologizing for speaking
Russian, called for unity: "All of the republics must act as
one against the Russian threat."</p>
<p>In recent months, Lvov has become the center of a
fast-growing independence movement. Lvov and the Western
Ukraine were absorbed into the Soviet Union only in 1939, and
the city's older inhabitants still remember life in the
pre-war Polish republic. Then, the city was dominated by
Poles and Jews, while the Ukrainians lived in the
countryside. Now, the Poles have departed and the Jews are
lining up to get visas for Israel, but the Ukrainians who
have replaced them have a cultural memory of a brief spell of
independence early in this century.</p>
<p>More than 80% of the Lvov city council's members now have
a non-Communist orientation. All of the parliamentary
deputies from the western part of the republic also are
non-Communist, although the East retains a few. Under the
influence of their Polish friends in Solidarity and the
Polish television they watch every evening, the leaders of
Rukh in Lvov have devised a plan to link their strong
political-intellectual movement (Rukh, an umbrella
organization, is trying to register itself as an independent
political party) with the slower moving, yet deeply
dissatisfied Eastern Ukraine. They say their plan follows a
road halfway between Lithuanian and Polish independence:
working for peaceful parliamentary change, while at the same
time using the strike as a weapon.</p>
<p>With the conviction of someone who spent years in Soviet
work camps, Bogdan Horyn -- sometimes referred to as the
Ukrainian Lech Walesa -- insists patiently that this path is
possible. "There is nothing to unite the Soviet Union
anymore, now that the (Communist) Party has lost its power,"
he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Horyn recently visited the miners of the Donau region
in the Eastern Ukraine. They come from the Ukrainian peasant
tradition, which was destroyed by Stalinist collectivization
in the 1930s and was subsequently subject to more repression
and destruction than any other part of the Soviet Union. They
don't speak Ukrainian.</p>
<p>If Mr. Horyn and the other Ukrainian leaders succeed in
bringing the miners into Rukh's fold, the resulting chaos
would make the current confusion over Lithuania look like a
minor squall. Ukraine is the one Soviet republic that could
never secede without a fight. Its grain feeds Russia, and the
republic provides the bulk of non-Russian labor and industry
in the Soviet Union. "So perhaps in the future Russia without
the Ukraine will simply be a small, poor country lying
between Europe and Asia," Mr. Horyn says with a shrug.</p>
<p>In Western Ukraine, Rukh is growing almost exponentially.
Mr. Horyn speaks of a "million or so" members with a wave of
his hand. A small peasant woman in the countryside crosses
herself when she hears the movement's name: Rukh's growth has
coincided with the renovation of churches that perform the
characteristic non-Orthodox, non-Roman Catholic rites that
are a trademark of the region. A small group of Jews sitting
in the city's one remaining synagogue say they also support
Rukh, whose leaders say they try to avoid the anti-Semitism
of Russian nationalism.</p>
<p>Poverty feeds dissatisfaction. Trash lies uncollected on
the streets of Lvov. Sometimes bread is unavailable. Soap is
rationed. City residents keep their bathtubs filled to the
limit with water, knowing that their taps will run only
between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. Water must be ladled out of the
bath during the day for washing, cooking and cleaning. How
long has this rationing continued? Ten years, replies one
Lvov housewife, who says she is so afraid that the water will
be turned off completely that she wouldn't dare complain.</p>
<p>More than anything else, hatred for Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev links all of the ethnic and social groups
in Ukraine. A universal feeling equates Mr. Gorbachev with
Moscow, Russian imperialism and poverty. Should he impose
martial law on Lithuania, no one in Lvov would be surprised,
but neither would they be afraid. With the countryside
destroyed, the city crumbling and the culture suppressed,
there is nothing much for people here to lose by issuing a
declaration of Ukrainian independence.</p>
