	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Chartwell Associates L.P., an investor group
that has been promised two seats on the board of Avon
Products Inc., increased its stake in Avon to more than 15%
from 10%, according to Wall Street executives.
   Chartwell, whose investors include Mary Kay Corp., the
Fisher real estate family of New York and oil heir Gordon
Getty, yesterday bought a three-million share block of Avon
stock that was assembled by Salomon Brothers Inc., the
executives said. Salomon said the shares were purchased for
$36 each, but it didn't identify the buyer or sellers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Avon shares rose on news of the block trade, closing at
$35.25 each, up $1.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading of 3,455,100 shares.</p>
<p>Chartwell has been buying Avon shares recently, the Wall
Street executives said, and is expected to file information
with the Securities and Exchange Commission soon, indicating
that it owns an Avon stake of as much as 16%.</p>
<p>Chartwell didn't buy the three-million-share block from
either of two other groups who have major stakes in Avon, the
executives said. Those groups are a partnership of
Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs and Amway Corp., which owns
a 9.8% stake in Avon, and the Robert M. Bass Group, which
owns a 6.2% stake.</p>
<p>In total, then, at least 32% of Avon's stock would be in
the hands of aggressive shareholders who could be unhappy
with the performance of Avon's current management.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Chartwell declined to comment, as did
spokesmen for Avon and the Bass Group.</p>
<p>Mr. Jacobs, in a brief interview, said the partnership
with Amway, which he controls, wasn't a buyer or seller in
the three-million-share block trade yesterday. He said he is
"watching with great interest" the developments at Avon.</p>
<p>Takeover-stock traders said that Chartwell's increased
stake could give the partnership more leverage when its two
representatives join Avon's board after the company's May 3
annual meeting.</p>
<p>Avon agreed to nominate the two Chartwell representatives
in return for Chartwell's agreement to drop its proxy fight.
Avon also agreed to form a committee of directors to explore
ways to maximize shareholder value. The committee will be
advised by John Rochon, a member of the Chartwell group who
has also agreed to resign as vice chairman of Mary Kay.</p>
<p>The purchase of additional Avon stock, which cost $108
million, "shows that much more desire on the part of
Chartwell to make something positive happen," said one
takeover professional. Chartwell previously spent $192.9
million to buy its 10.1% stake in Avon.</p>
<p>Takeover stock traders said the purchase by Chartwell also
indicated that Chartwell wanted to increase its bet on Avon's
stock before its trading activities become more restricted by
the presence of its representatives on Avon's board. Under
insider-trading laws, Chartwell could be restricted from
buying or selling Avon shares for certain periods of time, if
its representatives become aware of material information
about Avon before it is released to the public.</p>
