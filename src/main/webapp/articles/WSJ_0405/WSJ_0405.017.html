	<p class="article-leader">The symptoms of chickenpox were eased in children
receiving the Burroughs Wellcome Co. antiviral drug,
acyclovir, researchers at the University of Minnesota
reported.
   Fifty children who were given a syrup containing acyclovir
four times a day, beginning the first day after they
developed symptoms of chickenpox, had fewer skin eruptions
than 52 children who didn't get the drug.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The eruptions began healing within a day after treatment,
or a day sooner than in the untreated children, and appeared
to heal faster, Henry H. Balfour Jr. and his colleagues at
the university's Health Sciences Center in Minneapolis
reported in this week's issue of the Journal of Pediatrics.</p>
<p>A check a year later found that the treated children had
developed the same natural immunity to chickenpox as the
untreated children.</p>
<p>Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus; one of
the many herpes viruses. Acyclovir previously was found
effective against several other viruses of the herpes family.</p>
<p>Chickenpox strikes an estimated 3.5 million people a year,
mostly children. In children, it usually produces a mild rash
and fever that lasts about five days. About 4,000 children a
year are hospitalized for complications of chickenpox. In the
rare adult who hasn't had chickenpox, infection can be
severe.</p>
