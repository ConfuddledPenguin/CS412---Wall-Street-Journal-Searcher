	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The yen got a boost from currency dealers
covering short positions amid suspicion that the Group of
Seven industrial nations is laying a trap for those who dare
take positions against the Japanese currency.
   Though most dealers said they doubted the G-7 will agree
to intervene at its talks Saturday, some speculated that the
group is trying to lull them into complacency with comments
suggesting intervention is unlikely. They say the G-7 might
be planning to surprise them next week with heavy dollar
sales for yen. G-7 nations include the U.S., Japan, Britain,
West Germany, France, Italy and Canada.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In other dealings, the dollar was mixed, with trading
confined within a narrow range. In late afternoon New York
trading, the dollar was at 1.6995 marks, up from 1.6979
marks, and at 158.95 yen, down from 159.79 yen late Tuesday.
Sterling was at $1.6401, up from $1.6357.</p>
<p>In Tokyo early Thursday, the dollar was trading at 158.18
yen, down from the opening price of 158.32 yen and down from
Wednesday's Tokyo close of 158.90 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S.
currency was trading at around 1.6985 marks, up from the
opening quote of 1.6980 marks and up from Wednesday's Tokyo
close of 1.6971 marks.</p>
<p>Comments by Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
overnight were a green light for traders to sell yen, but
they didn't, said Albert Soria, first vice president and
foreign-exchange manager at Kansallis Osake Pankki in New
York.</p>
<p>Mr. Hashimoto was reported as saying that capital flowing
out of Japan wasn't the cause of the yen's current weakness
and that he wasn't considering regulating such capital flows.
He also said the G-7 wouldn't focus only on exchange rates at
the meeting Saturday.</p>
<p>Many observers blame the yen's decline on the heavy flow
of Japanese capital abroad for investment use. Some also
wonder why Mr. Hashimoto seems to be trying to deflect
attention from any discussion of exchange rates Saturday.</p>
<p>Mr. Soria said there was a certain amount of skepticism
about the comments. On the surface, it looks as if nothing
will come out of the meeting, but the market is apprehensive
about selling the yen, he said, adding: "Is he setting us
up?"</p>
<p>But Baruch Deutsch, a dealer at Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc., in New York, said the dollar is still close to its
recent high at around 160 yen, an indication that most
traders don't expect intervention.</p>
<p>Mr. Deutsch, who predicted an accord on coordinated dollar
sales would emerge from the meeting, said the greenback is
contained more by the difficulty of breaking the
psychologically important 160-yen level. Trade talks between
the U.S. and Japan seem to be going well, he said. The U.S.
will reward the Japanese for their trade concessions and for
Japan's previous help in supporting U.S. policy on the
dollar, he said.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, Yoichi Itoh, chief corporate-service officer
with Sumitomo Trust & Banking, said, "I think the U.S. might
judge that higher Japanese interest rates might force U.S.
interest rates up, and that some kind of currency stability
will be necessary to stop Japanese interest rates from rising
further." Higher Japanese interest rates are generally
thought of as another way to lift the yen because they would
make yen-denominated investments relatively more attractive.
But when the Bank of Japan raised its discount rate to 5.25%
from 4.25% two weeks ago, the yen plunged, largely because
the move was widely expected and discounted.</p>
<p>Sterling recovered another piece of ground that was lost
in a sharp tumble when trading opened in the Far East Monday.
Mr. Soria said the pound was benefiting from high yields
available in Britain. Everyone went short sterling after the
violence in Britain during the weekend, he said, adding that
the short-covering is still evident.</p>
<p>Linda McLaughlin, vice president at Chemical Bank in New
York, said traders are trying to fill in the gaps between
$1.6455, where sterling was at late Friday in New York, and
around $1.6250, the level it fell to shortly after the
opening in New Zealand Monday.</p>
<p>The market was talking about the pound going to $1.66
before the weekend violence, she said. Nobody knows what to
do or where sterling is headed until the market fills in the
big gap by moving the pound up to around $1.6450, she said.
Once that is filled in, there will be a basis from which to
move, said Ms. McLaughlin.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $377.10 an ounce, up $1.80. Estimated
volume was a light 2.4 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Thursday, gold didn't trade due to a public
holiday.</p>
