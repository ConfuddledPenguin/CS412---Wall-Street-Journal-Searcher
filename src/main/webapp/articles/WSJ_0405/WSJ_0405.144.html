	<p class="article-leader">Pinnacle West Capital Corp., Phoenix, Ariz., in a
long-awaited transaction, said it sold its Wigwam resort
hotel for $70 million to a unit of Kabuto Decom Inc., a
Japanese construction and real estate concern.
   Pinnacle West Capital, an electric utility holding company
whose ill-starred diversification efforts led it to the edge
of bankruptcy last year, has had the resort on the auction
block for about a year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The transaction, at a price somewhat lower than suggested
by analysts, is also apparently subject to substantial
performance guarantees by Pinnacle West that the resort will
live up to expectations.</p>
<p>Under the sales agreement, Pinnacle West's SunCor
Development Co. real estate unit will continue to manage the
property. SunCor has guaranteed certain financial performance
at the resort and must make payments back to Kabuto if those
goals aren't met, John Ogden, president and chief executive
officer of SunCor said. He declined, however, to elaborate on
the guarantees.</p>
<p>Mr. Ogden said the property has a book value of just over
$50 million, indicating a gain on the sale.</p>
