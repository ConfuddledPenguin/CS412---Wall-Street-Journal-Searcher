	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Group of Seven industrial nations gather
in Paris Saturday to try to improve economic policy
coordination and shore up the yen to help settle Japan's
turbulent financial markets.
   In an effort to bolster the weakening Japanese currency,
the U.S. and its G-7 partners are widely expected to issue a
joint statement expressing support for greater stability in
Japanese markets, and for further intervention in
foreign-exchange markets. But some analysts question whether
such moves would be effective and may prefer to let the yen's
decline run its course.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The meeting in Paris takes on urgency in the wake of the
turmoil in Japan. The Nikkei Index of 225 leading stocks has
fallen 27% this year, the Japanese discount rate has risen
1.5 points since mid-December to 5.25%, and the yen has
declined about 11% against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>In a briefing with reporters this week, a senior Treasury
official characterized the Paris gathering as "primarily an
economic surveillance meeting." He stressed that such
meetings are held yearly, and indicated that it might not
even produce a joint statement. But he also said that "the
depreciation of the yen against the dollar and the European
currencies will clearly be issues of interest."</p>
<p>The faltering yen doesn't bode well for Japan's attempts
to reduce its big export surplus, this official said. "I
think the present exchange-rate situation in Japan must be a
matter of concern for Japan if it persists, because it'll
tend to contribute to export-led growth." Japan is trying to
reduce its trade surplus, but a falling yen tends to help
exports by making them relatively cheaper overseas.</p>
<p>"The pressure is obviously going to be on the Japanese for
their currency," said Jim Fralick, a principal and chief
economist at Morgan Stanley & Co. He also said there is a
"sword of intervention that's hanging over the market" in the
days leading up to the Paris meeting, the first gathering of
the G-7 since September. The G-7 consists of the U.S., Japan,
West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.</p>
<p>But analysts are divided over whether intervention and
statements may be accompanied by coordinated moves on
interest rates, particularly a rise in Japan's discount rate.
"The logic is in favor of a yen-stabilization package," and
"one not just based on a rise in Japanese rates," said Robert
Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs & Co.'s international
unit. A rise in the discount rate, which the central bank
charges on loans to financial institutions, would generally
boost Japanese interest rates and would be expected to
increase the demand for yen.</p>
<p>Mr. Fralick, though, doesn't expect any interest-rate
moves, particularly after the Treasury this year failed to
persuade the Federal Reserve to cut U.S. interest rates.
"Intervention," he said, is "the only thing they're left
with."</p>
<p>Another isolated rise in Japanese interest rates is
entirely possible -- and may be desirable. "One of the key
problems of economic management in Japan is the explosion of
the money supply, which has gone far beyond what anyone
thought was necessary, and helped grease the explosion in
asset prices" said Rimmer de Vries, chief economist at Morgan
Guaranty Trust Co.</p>
<p>Whatever measures are adopted, there could be trade-offs
between the G-7 talks and current talks -- aimed at removing
so-called structural obstacles to the bilateral economic
relationship -- taking place here between the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the Treasury official also said the G-7
meeting would review developments in Eastern Europe, German
reunification issues and world exchange rates. The
participants also will deal with the International Monetary
Fund's capital increase and "certain debt issues," he added.</p>
<p>The planned European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, which will lend to emerging democracies in
Eastern Europe, also will be discussed at the G-7 meeting. It
also will be the focus of further multilateral meetings in
Paris to be held Sunday and Monday, where the U.S. will be
represented by David Mulford, the Treasury undersecretary for
international affairs.</p>
<p>Some economists, though, are skeptical that the G-7 can do
much to stop the yen's slide. As in June last year, when the
economic powers essentially decided to let the surging dollar
run its course, the G-7 may well decide it has little choice
but to let the yen move downward.</p>
<p>"The markets are coming to the conclusion that {the G-7
is} not going to do very much, but there's some
understandable caution about setting up aggressive short
positions," said Robin Marshall, chief economist with Chase
Investment Bank Ltd. Mr. Marshall doubts whether the G-7 will
agree to mount a huge yen-buying campaign to prop up the
sagging currency. The West German central bank "isn't
prepared to go in on behalf of the Bank of Japan," he said.
"And for the moment, the reunification issue has really
sidetracked the Germans."</p>
