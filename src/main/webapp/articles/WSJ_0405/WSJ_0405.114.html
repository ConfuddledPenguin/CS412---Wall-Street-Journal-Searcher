	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- E-Systems Inc. said its auditor noted in its
opinion of the company's financial statements that it
couldn't determine the potential financial impact of a U.S.
government investigation into whether E-Systems violated
procurement regulations.
   The explanatory paragraph included in Ernst & Young's
letter to shareholders and directors marked the first time
that the auditor has raised the issue in its opinion, even
though the dispute with the U.S. Army dates back to 1985.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its annual report, E-Systems said it hasn't taken any
provisions for liability or loss related to the litigation
and can't determine the outcome of the matter. However, it
said that it considers potential charges as "extremely
serious" and that an indictment could lead the government to
suspend or debar the company and its subsidiaries from
receiving new federal contracts.</p>
<p>According to the company's financial statements, the Army
terminated two contracts, valued at $19 million, on Dec. 31,
1985, saying the concern defaulted on its agreement to build
military tactical radios. E-Systems appealed the termination
and sought $13 million in claims in a case that was to be
tried in March 1988.</p>
<p>However, in February 1988, the government told E-Systems
that it was beginning a criminal investigation into whether
the company violated procurement regulations at its Memcor
division. The division has since been discontinued.</p>
<p>The government hasn't filed any formal allegations or
indictments against the company. But E-Systems said that in
January of this year, a former first-line supervisor of the
company who had given a deposition at the Army's request in
the civil case was convicted of three counts of perjury and
one count of obstruction of justice. E-Systems said the
former employee wasn't a witness for the company, but her
conviction "may have adverse implications for the successful
prosecution" of its civil case.</p>
<p>An E-Systems spokesman wouldn't elaborate, saying that the
matters are in litigation.</p>
