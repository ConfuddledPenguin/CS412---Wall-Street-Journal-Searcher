	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
suspended trading in Southland Communications Inc. for 10
days, beginning yesterday, because of questions about control
of the company and recent market activity.
   The agency said it stopped trading in the Santa Ana,
Calif., radio-paging company because of "a possible
undisclosed change in control." Moreover, the SEC said it had
questions about the identity of the owners of Southland's
common and preferred shares.</p>
