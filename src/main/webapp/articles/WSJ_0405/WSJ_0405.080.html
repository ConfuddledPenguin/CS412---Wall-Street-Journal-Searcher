	<p class="article-leader">GORBACHEV DENOUNCED Estonia's drive for gradual
independence.
   In a telephone call to the president of the Baltic
republic, the Kremlin leader criticized a resolution
declaring Estonia an occupied state and said Tallinn's call
for step-by-step secession was invalid. The Estonian official
said Gorbachev threatened "similar measures as those taken in
Lithuania." In Vilnius, Lithuanian lawmakers approved a
resolution accusing the Soviet Union of using the army in an
attempt "to overthrow" the government of the republic, which
proclaimed its independence three weeks ago.</p>

<p>ISRAEL'S PERES CLAIMED enough support to form a governing
coalition.</p>
<p>The Labor Party leader, who has been negotiating with
small political parties since the March 15 collapse of Prime
Minister Shamir's government, said he had enough backing in
the Knesset to form a ruling coalition. He requested a
special session of the parliament to approve the new
government. Peres, who supports U.S. proposals for Mideast
peace talks, refused to name the new coalition members, and
radio reports questioned whether he had the needed votes.</p>
<p>Ex-President Carter, who met in Paris with PLO leader
Arafat and France's Mitterrand, blamed leaders in the Mideast
for stalled peace efforts.</p>

<p>Bush held talks in Washington with West Germany's
Genscher, who predicted that the Germanys would be reunited
next year. The foreign minister also said the Soviet Union
eventually may agree that a unified Germany should be in
NATO. In Bonn, West Germany said it wants a pact on monetary
union with East Germany by next month.</p>
<p>East German political parties neared formation of a
non-Communist government. Officials agreed to ask Christian
Democrat leader Maiziere to try to build a coalition, and the
legislature is expected to approve the move when it convenes
today.</p>

<p>The House approved a bill requiring the Justice Department
for the first time to collect and publish statistics on
so-called hate crimes, those that are motivated by prejudice
based on a victim's race, religion, national origin or sexual
orientation. The measure, already passed by the Senate, goes
to Bush, who is expected to sign it.</p>

<p>Mandela said the African National Congress is committed to
talks with South Africa's government, even though the group
canceled exploratory discussions that had been set for next
week. He said his meeting today with President de Klerk would
help determine whether both sides are prepared for
power-sharing negotiations.</p>

<p>El Salvador's government met in Geneva with
representatives of the country's leftist rebels for
U.N.-sponsored talks in a renewed effort to end a 10-year-old
civil war. Both sides agreed to seek a cease-fire as an
"initial objective" toward a negotiated settlement, but the
guerrillas linked acceptance of such a truce to political
changes.</p>

<p>China's Li asserted that the country's leadership is
"united and strong," and that the public doesn't want a

his first comments since Beijing's crackdown on dissent, also
said that former Communist Party chief Zhao was being
investigated over his stance during the protests.</p>

<p>Lebanon's rival Christian forces battled in Beirut after
Lebanese Forces chief Geagea urged Syrian-backed President
Hrawi to send army troops into the country's Christian
enclave to end two months of fighting. Maronite Catholic
clerics, meanwhile, attempted to forge a truce between
Geagea's militia and forces loyal to Gen. Aoun.</p>

<p>Colombia's President Barco said the suspected leader of
the Medellin-based cocaine-trafficking operation won't be
extradited to the U.S. if he surrenders to authorities. It
was the first time that Barco, who guaranteed a fair trial
for Pablo Escobar, has made such a pledge since ordering a
government crackdown on drugs last August.</p>

<p>Khashoggi was portrayed in opening arguments in U.S. court
in New York as a naive businessman who kept in contact with
the Marcoses in 1986 because he was promised a part of a

calls by the Saudi financier to the couple were part of an
effort to cover up alleged racketeering.</p>
