	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- California insurance regulators said a
state court approved a rehabilitation agreement for Mission
Insurance Co's that, among other things, calls for the
transfer of $29 million in assets to government trusts from
the Los Angeles-based insurer, which has been in bankruptcy
proceedings since 1987.
   Completion of the transfer is subject to approval by a
federal court here overseeing the Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings of Mission Insurance Group, the parent of Mission
Insurance Co's. A hearing on the plan is scheduled for May 9.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the rehabilitation plan, which was announced in
January, the assets and liabilities of Mission Insurance Co's
will be transferred to trusts overseen by the state insurance
commissioner, after which the shells of the companies will be
released from insurance liquidation proceedings and over to
Mission Insurance Group.</p>
<p>The shells of the Mission Insurance Co's contain tax-loss
carry-forwards that make them attractive, said Dana Brooks, a
lawyer acting for the California Department of Insurance.</p>
<p>The transfer to the government trusts from Mission
Insurance Co's will include $14 million in cash and 5.9
million common shares of Mission Insurance Group,
representing about 29% of the stock outstanding. Other assets
accumulated by state regulators to cover claims against
Mission Insurance Co's include about $400 million recouped to
date from settlements with reinsurers, Ms. Brooks said.</p>
<p>California's Department of Insurance has sued to recover
about $2 billion in reinsurance -- an amount now reduced by
the settlements. Reinsurers, who assume certain risks from
insurance companies in return for a portion of the premiums,
have resisted paying Mission claims, alleging that Mission
had provided misleading financial information.</p>
<p>Mission Insurance Co's insolvency was one of the largest
insurance company failures in history. Under Chapter 11, a
company is protected from creditor lawsuits while working out
a plan to pay its debts.</p>
