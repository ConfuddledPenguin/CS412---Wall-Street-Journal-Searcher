	<p class="article-leader">Western Union Corp., Upper Saddle River, N.J., and
International Business Machines Corp. said they agreed to
provide jointly a service that would enable customers to
communicate between each other's electronic mail systems.
   Both systems will integrate a communication standard known
as X.400, developed by the Consultative Committee for the
International Telephone and Telegraph, the international
standards committee.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The adoption of the standard will allow communication
between the IBM Information Network's Screenmail service and
Western Union 400 service, which is fully integrated with
Western Union's EasyLink electronic mail service.</p>
<p>Western Union said the interconnection with IBM Screenmail
is "a further step to achieve a full and open
interconnection" with major public electronic messaging
systems. Western Union provides a broad range of messaging,
financial and other services. IBM is the Armonk, N.Y.-based
computer giant.</p>
