	<p class="article-leader">Whitehall Corp. said its board will "vigorously oppose" an
effort by Cambridge Capital Fund L.P. to lead a proxy fight
against the company.
   Cambridge, a New York investment company, yesterday
proposed acquiring the 90.4% of Whitehall that it doesn't
already own for $20 a share and said it plans to nominate
five directors to Whitehall's board at the company's annual
shareholders meeting April 23.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Whitehall said that all its shareholders should be allowed
to "realize the full value of its strategies," which have
left the company debt-free and with more than $10 a share in
cash and equivalents.</p>
<p>Whitehall's chairman, Lee D. Webster, said in a news
release that the company's board will consider Cambridge's
takeover proposal "in due course."</p>
<p>Whitehall, based in Dallas, modifies and maintains
aircraft, sells underwater acoustic technology to the U.S.
Navy and makes marine sensor systems.</p>
