	<div class="article-body"><p>Tiny, highly specialized investment boutiques are thriving
even as bigger Wall Street firms slump.</p>
<p>For one, Vector Securities International Inc. in just more
than two years has built a profitable business with annual
revenue of more than $8 million by focusing on one narrow
class of clients. The Deerfield, Ill., concern operates
nationally, but only within the life-sciences industry.</p>
<p>To find financing for clients, and to perform other
services, Vector acts as a matchmaker to bring small and big
companies together, for anything from a complex merger to a
simple marketing agreement.</p>
<p>When Seradyn Inc., an Indianapolis maker of
medical-diagnostic equipment, needed a big cash infusion to
fund its rapid growth, Vector quickly arranged last year for
Mitsubishi Kasei Corp., a large Japanese chemical company, to
acquire Seradyn in a $25 million transaction. More recently,
Xoma Corp., a Berkeley, Calif., biotechnology concern, needed
to finance and market two drugs for so-called immune-related
disorders. Vector deftly arranged a development-and-marketing
agreement -- announced last month -- between Xoma and Ortho
Pharmaceutical Corp., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, the
giant New Jersey-based maker of health-care products.</p>
<p>Through such deals, Vector and the few other such highly
specialized firms that exist so far are finding a lucrative
role: They are actively seeking transactions much smaller --
and sometimes much more arcane -- than are normally
considered by big Wall Street firms. In Chicago, for example,
First Analysis Corp. focuses on clients in waste management
and environmental services. In Parsippany, N.J., Anantha
Raman & Co. provides financial research and strategic advice
to chemical businesses.</p>
<p>The emergence of these specialty firms benefits small
entrepreneurial companies, says Steven Burrill, director of
the San Francisco-based high-technology practice of the
accounting firm Ernst & Young. At most Wall Street firms, the
needs of small entrepreneurial concerns aren't big enough to
attract attention, he says. On the other hand, he adds, "The
growth of these boutiques depends entirely on how much they
can help small companies grow."</p>
<p>More such boutiques are expected to emerge soon, says
Michael Goldberg, a physician and former First Boston Corp.
investment banker who heads New York-based Montaur Capital
Corp., a new investment bank for health-care companies. Dr.
Goldberg explains that small operating companies increasingly
are seeking alliances with big corporate partners, such as
research-and-marketing agreements. Meanwhile, many big
companies are turning to smaller concerns for new ideas and
new products, he says.</p>
<p>Those trends have meant rapid success for such go-betweens
as Vector, the most active of the boutiques. Vector was
founded in 1988 by Theodore Berghorst, James Foght and Peter
Drake, all former partners of Kidder, Peabody & Co., a New
York securities firm controlled by General Electric Co.</p>
<p>In 1986, when "biotechnology was seen as a magic bullet,"
Mr. Berghorst says, Kidder asked him to create his own
specialized team to serve the "bugs-and-mice crowd," as he
puts it. Even though the business would focus on small
companies and expected rewards were long term, "Kidder wanted
to be positioned for the 1990s when the industry really took
off," he says.</p>
<p>But after the Black Monday crash in October 1987, Kidder
stressed short-term profit, and Mr. Berghorst's unit fell
into disfavor. At the end of 1987, he decided to leave
Kidder, move to Deerfield (a Chicago suburb) and, along with
Messrs. Foght and Drake, start Vector. "We wanted the
opportunity to focus on one industry and not be distracted by
the concerns of a larger firm," Mr. Foght says.</p>
<p>Vector has prepared well for its new role, industry
watchers say. "While most investment bankers in the
life-sciences still are into number crunching, Vector
understands the science," says Jeffrey Jay, a physician who
is an associate at Canaan Partners, a Rowayton, Conn.,
venture-capital firm. That helps Vector make corporate
matches between partners with compatible scientific goals.</p>
<p>In retaining boutiques such as Vector, clients pay fees --
usually totaling between 3% and 5% of the value of the
underlying transaction. But the transactions are complicated;
many involve several fees, some guaranteed, others contingent
on future developments. Xoma, which sold Ortho specific
rights to a set of drugs still in development while retaining
others, paid Vector more than $1.5 million in fees on a
transaction that might reach $50 million in value, depending
on contingencies.</p>
<p>The complexity of these deals and the relatively small
fees -- small by Wall Street standards, anyway -- would make
them unprofitable for most big investment banks, says John
Wilkerson, a New York-based consultant to health-care
businesses. But without the huge overheads of the big firms,
and with a small and versatile staff, Vector, for one, can do
such deals quite profitably, he adds.</p>
<p>With limited capital, the boutiques are hardly a major
force in the financial markets, but they are crucial
catalysts for the small clients they serve. Montaur's Dr.
Goldberg adds that the firms, though small, can develop
business relationships that permit them to offer a broad
range of financial services. Vector, for example, can buy or
sell blocks of stock for clients because of an arrangement
with a securities unit of Equitable Life Assurance Society of
the U.S. Vector also reaches a broad investor base for
analytical reports that it circulates by using the
distribution services of Blunt Ellis & Loewi, a Milwaukee
securities broker.</p>
<p>And to position itself in international markets --
especially Japan, where many prospective corporate buyers and
partners are situated -- Vector says it is working jointly on
some transactions with Yamaichi Securities Co., a major
Japanese securities concern.</p>
<p>For all their activity, the specialty firms say their
strength will be in staying small. In fact, becoming larger
might actually hurt a firm, because the leaders can no longer
pay attention to every client, says chemical-industry
specialist Anantha Raman. His New Jersey firm had grown to 20
people until he decided last year to halve that number. "We
quickly realized that our strength was not in the number of
deals we did," he says, "but in the quality of services we
provided."</p>
