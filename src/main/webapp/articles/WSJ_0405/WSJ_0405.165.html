	<p class="article-leader">PLAINVIEW, Colo. -- Headlights piercing night, the
California Zephyr slowly descends the Rockies toward Denver,
far below. "It's like we're circling in an airplane," says
Clint Parker, an assistant conductor.
   But the Zephyr is no 747. Its journey from the West Coast
to Chicago takes 51 hours when it's on time -- which is
seldom. But the 2,422-mile route offers spectacular views of
snow-capped mountains, river valleys, ravines and deserts. No
wonder it's Amtrak's most popular train. In the summer, the
Zephyr averages 500 to 550 passengers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>From San Francisco, the through fare is $476, including
space in an economy bedroom and meals. That compares with the
one-way, restricted air coach fare of $498. The
stainless-steel cars are the same double-deck Superliners
that Amtrak uses on most of its Western trains. The dining
car has declined from the old Zephyr days but is much
improved from the early 1980s, when microwave cuisine
arrived.</p>
<p>Fred Davison, a Mercedes-Benz service director from
Downingtown, Pa., says he and his wife are aboard because
"flying has got old hat. The romance is coming back into the
trains."</p>
<p>The Zephyr reaches the Continental Divide at 9,239 feet
while traversing the 6.2-mile Moffat Tunnel. Then it begins
the sinuous descent into Denver, where the impressive station
recalls another era. Passengers stretch their legs while the
train takes on fuel and a mail car.</p>
<p>After snaking through freight yards, the Zephyr opens up
to 79 miles an hour as it races through the night toward
Chicago. The next day brings views of farms. Some passengers
read. James Christen, a student from Naperville, Ill., plays
a videotape. Subject: the great streamliners of the 1940s
rounding curves and racing across prairies.</p>
