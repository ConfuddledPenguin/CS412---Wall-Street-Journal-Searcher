	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A short list of tax-increase options
prepared for the House Budget Committee's chairman includes
raising the top tax rate on corporations and limiting the
deduction for state and local taxes.
   Besides these newcomers to this year's fiscal debate,
other options on the closely guarded list include raising the
top rate on individuals, suspending a provision that ties tax
brackets to inflation, and increasing the gasoline tax, the
cigarette tax and other excise taxes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The document was prepared for Rep. Leon Panetta (D.,
Calif.) for use in continuing, closed-door sessions of the
House Budget Committee, which is charged with writing a
blueprint for deficit reduction in fiscal 1991, which begins
Oct. 1. The document presents various plans calling for tax
increases that range from $18.1 billion to $13.9 billion, the
amount Democrats say President Bush is proposing.</p>
<p>The list gives an early indication of how House Democratic
leaders might lean when it comes to raising the revenue
needed to hold down the budget deficit.</p>
<p>Though Rep. Panetta says he doesn't endorse the options,
the list includes ideas already raised by such Democratic
leaders as House Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington state,
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine and House
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of
Illinois.</p>
<p>Rep. Panetta played down the options list, stressing that
it consists of staff options prepared for him to help him
answer questions from committee members. What's more, the
budget panel doesn't have the authority to draft tax law;
that responsibility falls to the Ways and Means Committee. In
addition, President Bush is solidly opposed to several of the
items.</p>
<p>Still, the budget panel does tell tax writers how much in
taxes to levy. That amount is usually derived with specific
tax changes in mind. And while Rep. Panetta said he doesn't
intend to include specific recommendations for tax increases
in his budget plan, lawmakers will be tempted to plug options
from the list into their budget formulas.</p>
<p>Further, the mere existence of the options list has
created a stir among some of the interest groups whose taxes
would be increased, and has raised the hackles of lawmakers
who support those interests.</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Panetta said the committee is likely to
set the tax-increase total at $13.9 billion and leave the
specifics to the Ways and Means Committee. "That is a
decision for Ways and Means, and it will remain a decision
for Ways and Means," he said.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the options document is quite specific.
In each of the three, separate tax-bill versions, it lists
raising the top individual tax rate to 33% from the current,
nominal tax rate of 28%, an idea already endorsed by
Democratic leaders in the House and Senate. Now, the nation's
highest-income individuals are taxed at 28% on their last
dollar of income, while many people who make less money pay
33% on the last dollars they earn each year. All three
versions also include a hefty tax cut -- to extend a variety
of soon-to-expire tax breaks for low-income housing and
research and development expenses, for example.</p>
<p>Each version also would raise excise taxes. One version
specifies a gasoline tax increase of six cents a gallon; the
current tax is 9.1 cents a gallon. The same version lists a
doubling of the tax on cigarettes to 32 cents a pack.</p>
<p>Other options listed include an increase in the top
corporate tax rate to 35% from the current nominal rate of
34%, and the suspension for one year of the indexing of tax
brackets to inflation.</p>
<p>Versions also include a reference to an unspecified
limitation on the deduction for state and local taxes, a
proposal that in 1985 nearly killed what later became the Tax
Reform Act of 1986.</p>
<p>Many of these ideas have been advanced, at least in
rhetorical fashion, by Ways and Means Chairman Rostenkowski.
As part of a major deficit-reduction package, he has called
for increases in excise taxes and an increase in the top tax
rate on individuals. The Panetta staff options list is the
first solid indication that some of those ideas might have a
future in the legislative process.</p>
<p>Separately, the Congressional Black Caucus unveiled its
fiscal 1991 budget plan, projecting a deficit of $63.8
billion and calling for $19.8 billion in new revenue.</p>
<p>Nearly half of the new revenue, $8.2 billion, would come
from federal fees and taxes proposed by Mr. Bush. The plan
also calls for raising $6.5 billion from a 10% surtax on the
income of the top 10% corporate taxpayers and $4.1 billion
from raising the top rate on individuals. An additional $1
billion in new taxes would result from increased employment
created by various initiatives, according to the budget plan.</p>
<p>Rep. Ron Dellums (D., Calif.), chairman of the Black
Caucus, called the plan "tax equity in the finest tradition
of the Democratic Party -- taxing the wealthy."</p>
<p>The black lawmakers' spending plan would cut military
spending authority to $259.4 billion, $47.4 billion below the
president's request. That would translate to about $279.5
billion in outlays. The savings would be achieved by
eliminating numerous weapons systems, including the MX and
Midgetman missiles and the B2 bomber, and cutting 200,000
troops.</p>
<p>Some of the savings would go to increased spending on such
social programs as job training and education, and to provide
resources for communities that lose jobs because of military
spending cuts.</p>
