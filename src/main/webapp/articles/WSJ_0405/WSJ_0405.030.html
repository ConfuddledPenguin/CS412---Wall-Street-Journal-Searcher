	<p class="article-leader">A MATTER OF ROYAL CONSCIENCE</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Belgium's King Baudouin has stepped down temporarily
because his conscience wouldn't let him sign a law legalizing
abortion, a government statement said.</p>
<p>Ministers met overnight Tuesday to solve the
constitutional crisis and -- with the king's agreement --
declared he was temporarily unable to reign, the statement
said. The ministers then took over the king's powers and
enacted the abortion law, which parliament had passed on
March 29.</p>
<p>Legal experts said the king, a deeply religious Roman
Catholic, was able to step down through a law intended for
use if the monarch was too ill to carry out his duties or was
prevented from doing so for other reasons. They said its use
in a matter of conscience was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Ministers have called a session of parliament for today.
They will consider the motion that Baudouin's inability to
reign has ceased, "so that the king . . . will resume his
constitutional powers."</p>
<p>IRELAND TO ABOLISH DEATH PENALTY</p>
<p>Ireland will abolish the death penalty and introduce
automatic jail sentences of at least 30 years for certain
convicted killers, the government said in a bill published
yesterday. Under the old law, capital punishment applied only
to killers of policemen, prison officers and foreign leaders
and diplomats; hanging for all other killings was abolished
in the late 1950s. All political parties in the Irish
parliament support the bill, which is expected to pass into
law this year. Ireland's last execution took place in 1954.</p>
<p>IMPROVING EAST GERMAN ROADS</p>
<p>A new highway network in East Germany might be built by
private companies, who would then charge users a toll, West
Germany's Transport Minister Friedrich Zimmermann said. The
plan would involve improving and extending all of East
Germany's poor road system. West Germany already maintains
the three transit motorways between West Germany and West
Berlin, which lies deep inside East German territory.</p>
<p>PHILIPPINE POWER SHORTAGE</p>
<p>The Philippine government announced major electricity
cutbacks in Manila to cope with a critical power shortage.
Under the plan, government offices and major commercial
establishments will be without electricity for five
consecutive Mondays beginning April 23. Factories will lose
power for four hours one day each week, the government said,
and residential districts will have daily power cuts of up to
four hours.</p>
<p>SWEDEN'S OVERSEAS INVESTMENTS</p>
<p>Swedish companies' rate of foreign investment has hit
record levels this year and shows no sign of abating,
according to analysts. Figures from Sweden's central bank
show that Swedish companies have invested a gross 49.2
billion kronor ($8.02 billion) abroad during the first three
months this year, compared with 43.7 billion kronor for all
of 1989. One analyst said important reasons for Swedish
companies to acquire a foothold abroad are the high level of
domestic costs and a lack of qualified workers at home.</p>
<p>PROTECTING FRANCE'S ENVIRONMENT</p>
<p>The French cabinet approved a proposal prohibiting
off-road use of recreational motor vehicles. The proposal, if
passed by the National Assembly, would ban four-wheel-drive
vehicles, cross-country motorcycles and other vehicles in
areas such as sand dunes and marshes. The proposed law was
drafted because of concern that the off-road vehicles posed a
threat to hikers and to the environment.</p>
<p>VIEWS OF THE U.N.</p>
<p>International polls conducted for the United Nations
Department of Public Information show considerable approval
for the world body but also reveal ignorance about its
institutions, functions and the people who run them.</p>
<p>Overall public awareness of the U.N. was high in almost
all countries surveyed, ranging from 70% in Mexico to 99% in
Denmark. However, given a list of five U.N.
secretaries-general since 1945, less than half the people
polled could identify Javier Perez de Cuellar as the current
U.N. chief.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Perez de Cuellar called the results of the
polls, which were conducted in the second half of last year,
"very encouraging." He added: "The general public now
recognizes that the United Nations is succeeding as an
institution for the resolution of conflict and the promotion
of peace."</p>
<p>The studies showed that environmental protection was the
most popular U.N. issue with a majority of people in most
countries, although few knew about U.N. activities in this
area. Human rights, drug abuse, peace, children and crime
prevention also rated high.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>For the first time in 45 years, Hungary spent April 4 at
work. In previous years, the date was a holiday marking
Soviet military intervention to free the country from the
Nazis toward the end of World War II. The April 4 work-free
day will be replaced by one on Oct. 23, anniversary of the
failed 1956 Hungarian uprising against Soviet domination. . .
. Romania's ex-King Michael will return to his country this
month for the first time in 42 years, relatives said. The
68-year-old former monarch was put on a train out of Romania
in 1948 after the Communist government forced him to sign an
abdication document and has lived in exile in Europe and the
U.S. since then.</p>
