	<p class="article-leader">Rumors that a big Tokyo stock-market player was in
financial trouble sent investors scurrying to the safety of
U.S. Treasury bonds.
   Long-term Treasury-bond prices ended up more than one
point, or more than $10 for each $1,000 of face amount, after
having climbed 1 3/4 points as the unconfirmed rumors spread
in midafternoon New York trading. The rumors sent the Dow
Jones Industrial Average into a mild decline. The average
fell 17.34 points to 2719.37 in moderate trading. The dollar
was mixed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rumors about the inability of a big institutional
investor to raise cash to support stock positions bought on
credit came as worries intensified about the effects of
further declines in the Tokyo stock market. Although U.S.
investors have managed to shrug off the Tokyo market's slump,
they are edgy about how the mounting financial troubles in
Japan will be resolved.</p>
<p>Speculation among stock traders was that the Nikkei Index
of 225 stocks could plunge between 1000 and 3000 points, or
more than 10%, if a big Japanese institutional investor
really is in trouble. The pace of selling in Japan hasn't yet
taken on panic proportions-volume has been relatively
light-but a financial crisis among one of the big market
players could change that, especially among individual
investors who are being asked to put up more money for stocks
they bought on credit.</p>
<p>The rally in bond prices surprised many traders who looked
for a quiet day leading up to the Treasury Department's
disclosure of the size of Resolution Funding Corp.'s 40-year
bond auction next week. The decision to offer $3.5 billion in
40-year bonds relieved traders who were worried that the
Treasury would attempt another $5 billion bond sale, like the
one in January that resulted in a two-point drop in long-term
Treasury bond prices.</p>
<p>Bond investors also were holding back waiting for Friday's
government report on employment, a key economic indicator.
Economists expect the report to show that 160,000 to 180,000
jobs were created last month. While investors initially
viewed that many new jobs as indicative of a strengthening
economy, which would be bearish for bond prices, opinion has
shifted to essentially neutral.</p>
<p>Currency traders said the dollar's modest retreat against
the yen doesn't indicate a peak has been reached. Instead,
they said traders are waiting for the results of this
weekend's meeting of the Group of Seven major industrial
nations.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices slumped in moderate trading. Volume on the
New York Stock Exchange totaled 159.5 million shares.
Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of gainers 918
to 596.</p>
<p>Bond prices rallied. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year issue slid to 8.51%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late afternoon New York trading
the currency was at 1.6995 marks and 158.95 yen compared with
1.6979 marks and 159.79 yen Tuesday.</p>
