	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A U.S. bankruptcy-court judge ordered the
liquidation of most Bonwit Teller retail stores, rejecting
last-minute appeals to save the once-proud chain.
   At a court hearing, Judge Tina Brozman awarded five of the
chain's 16 stores to a group led by developers Donald Trump,
Alfred Taubman, Phil Palevsky, and Pyramid Cos., for about
$21 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Three of those stores will be liquidated, as will eight
others around the country, putting most of the chain's 1,800
employees out of work. Late last year, Bonwit's sister chain,
B. Altman & Co., was entirely liquidated. The two chains'
parent, L.J. Hooker Corp., filed for bankruptcy law
protection last summer.</p>
<p>Pyramid, a Syracuse-based mall developer, will operate the
Bonwit Teller stores in Buffalo and Boston and has acquired
the rights to the Bonwit Teller name. In an interview, a
senior Pyramid executive said that Pyramid intends to open a
new Bonwit Teller store this fall in Syracuse. He estimated
Pyramid's cost at $8.2 million plus the assumption of certain
employee liabilities.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has acquired the lease to the Bonwit Teller
flagship at Trump Tower in New York for about $5 million. In
an interview, he said he intends to close the store and lease
it to at least two new tenants. Possible tenants include
Chanel Inc. and Tiffany & Co., he said.</p>
<p>"We wanted the lease back because it has another 14 years
to run," said Mr. Trump. "I'm very happy, and I have no
doubts we'll be able to attract several prestigious
retailers."</p>
<p>Mr. Trump said that Mr. Taubman bought back the lease to
the Bonwit Teller store at the Mall at Short Hills, which is
based in Short Hills, N.J., and that Mr. Palevsky bought the
lease to the Bonwit Teller branch in Manhasset, L.I. Both
stores also will be closed.</p>
<p>Judge Brozman awarded the Bonwit Teller store in Palm
Beach to Frances Brewster, a southeast Florida specialty
retailer that currently operates four stores. Frances
Brewster will operate the Bonwit Teller store under its own
name.</p>
<p>"We're very pleased that the name will go on, but we're
quite disappointed that it won't be in more locations," said
Elayne Garofolo, senior vice president of marketing at Bonwit
Teller. "The employees are taking it as well as one would
expect. They are being professional."</p>
<p>An attorney for L.J. Hooker said in court yesterday that
former Bonwit Teller President William Ruben had indicated he
was attempting to arrange financing to buy l3 stores.
However, Mr. Ruben didn't make a formal bid, and Judge
Brozman moved the case forward.</p>
<p>"We should have had more opportunity to save this
business, because we had the financing," said Irwin M.
Rosenthal, a senior partner at Baer, Marks & Upham, and an
attorney for Mr. Ruben and his group of investors. "If they
would have given us another hour, we could have saved the
company and the jobs of its employees. It's tragic and a
travesty of justice."</p>
<p>One of the country's oldest retailers, Bonwit Teller was
founded in 1898 and soon became one of New York's most
fashionable stores. Its former flagship on Fifth Avenue,
since demolished, was for years a Manhattan landmark. Bonwit
Teller had losses of approximately $30 million over the past
three years, according to a spokesman for L.J. Hooker.
Although it appeared to be turning around, it foundered last
spring when L.J. Hooker stopped providing it with cash for
new merchandise.</p>
<p>In addition to Boston and Buffalo, two other Bonwit Teller
branches will continue to operate, at least temporarily. L.J.
Hooker has reached a licensing agreement with Pyramid that
will allow it to operate stores in Hooker-owned malls in
Cincinnati and Columbia, S.C., under the Bonwit Teller name.
But L.J. Hooker currently is trying to sell the two stores.</p>
<p>L.J. Hooker is owned by Sydney-based Hooker Corp., which
is being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator.</p>
