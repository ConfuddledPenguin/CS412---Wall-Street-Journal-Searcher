	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Delta Air Lines said it estimates its net
income for the March quarter was far lower than last year's
results, although it still will report a profit.
   The airline said its profit margin was being squeezed by a
combination of softer demand by leisure travelers and higher
fuel prices. In addition, last year's quarter showed
particularly high profits because Delta's main competitor in
its Atlanta hub, Eastern Airlines, had been hit by a strike
and practically grounded.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thomas J. Roeck, Delta's senior vice president of finance
and chief financial officer, said in a statement that while
fuel prices have declined somewhat since last year, they will
still drive up fuel expenses for the first three months by
$85 million to $90 million.</p>
<p>Separately, Delta said its March traffic fell 4.7% to 5.05
billion revenue passenger miles from 5.3 billion miles last
year. A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown
one mile. Load factor, or the percentage of seats filled,
also dropped sharply for the month to 61.5% from 68.7% a year
ago.</p>
<p>For the year to date, Delta said it flew 13.61 billion
revenue passenger miles, up slightly from last year's 13.57
billion miles. Load factor for the first three months was
57.5%, down from 61% in 1989.</p>
