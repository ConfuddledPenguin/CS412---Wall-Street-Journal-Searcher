	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- National Heritage Inc., a troubled nursing-home
management concern, said it agreed to merge with Life Care
Centers of America in a stock transaction.
   Terms call for the two companies to become a new concern
under the Life Care name. Current National Heritage
stockholders would receive one share of stock in the new
company for each common share now owned, giving them almost
40% of the new concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Owners of Life Care Centers, a closely held company based
in Cleveland, Tenn., and its affiliates would receive about
26 million new common shares, or just over 60% of the new
company. The companies said the stock is expected to be
publicly traded.</p>
<p>The merger is contingent on the companies reaching a
separate agreement with Southmark Corp., a troubled thrift
and real-estate concern that directly owns about 22% of
National Heritage. The transaction calls for Southmark to
contribute three leased health-care properties and mortgages,
advances to its health-care limited partnerships and its
general partnership interests in its health-care limited
partnerships to the new company in exchange for preferred
stock.</p>
<p>The merger, which is subject to several conditions, is
expected to be completed in the fall, and the companies said
the valuation of the assets contributed to the new concern
could change before then. Pro forma financial statements from
Life Care aren't expected until the end of this month.</p>
<p>National Heritage, which operates nursing homes and
retirement centers, many of which are owned by Southmark
partnerships, also said it has reserved the right to
negotiate with other parties interest in acquiring it.</p>
