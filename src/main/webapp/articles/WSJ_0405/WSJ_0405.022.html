	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Six executives of Film House Group Inc., a
former unit of Cineplex Odeon Corp., launched a suit against
Cineplex for 18 million Canadian dollars (US$15.4 million),
alleging that the theater chain breached its promise to pay
them hefty incentive bonuses.
   The six plaintiffs described the aggregate C$75,000 that
they received as bonuses from Cineplex last December as
"paltry, miserable and lacking in good sense and judgment."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to the six executives, Garth Drabinsky, founder
and former chairman of Cineplex, promised "to make you all
rich" if they met or exceeded budgetary performance targets.</p>
<p>Encouraged by Mr. Drabinsky's promise, the executives say
that they operated the plant seven days a week for 32 weeks
of 1989.</p>
<p>The Film House executives claim they met or exceeded
budgetary performance levels that had been set for them. They
noted that, as a team, they increased sales to about C$64.5
million in 1989 from C$12.8 million in 1986. They claim that
they operated Film House "at a profit level close to 30% of
sales revenue which is . . . unmatched by any film laboratory
post production house in the world."</p>
<p>Last week, Rank Organisation PLC completed the purchase of
the 51% of Film House it didn't already own for $40 million.
It had purchased the other 49% in 1988 for for an agreed
price of $73.5 million.</p>
<p>But Cineplex claims in documents filed with the court that
the Film House executives didn't meet the targets which would
have allowed Cineplex to adjust upward the $73.5 million
price Rank was to pay for Film House. Instead, Cineplex was
obliged to repay between $10.8 million and $12.3 million of
that price.</p>
<p>The six executives "were paid gratuitously,
notwithstanding that no incentive bonus was earned," Cineplex
said in the court filing.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Cineplex declined further comment,
noting that the issue is before the courts.</p>
<p>The Film House executives couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
