Kingdom department of health to market Regaine Topical

the U.S. as a prescription-only anti-baldness drug for men
since October 1988. Upjohn, of Kalamazoo, Mich., last
September asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
approval to market Rogaine to women in the U.S. and is still
awaiting a decision.</p>
