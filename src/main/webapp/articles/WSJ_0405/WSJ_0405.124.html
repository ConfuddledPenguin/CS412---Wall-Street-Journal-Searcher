	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Rumors that share prices in Tokyo are poised
to take another plunge helped turn gains to losses on the
over-the-counter market yesterday.
   Traders say rumors that a major Japanese institution would
be forced to liquidate at least part of its stock holdings,
driving Tokyo's Nikkei 225-Stock Index still lower, spooked
holders of U.S. equities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a rumor-driven market. . . ," says John Schraff,
equities trader at Daiwa Securities America.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index, which had edged higher to
marginal gains late Wednesday morning, slid 2.23, or 0.5%, to
435.42 by the close.</p>
<p>The rumors also sapped share prices on the New York Stock
Exchange, sinking the composite index there 0.66%.</p>
<p>But Mitch Meisler, a manager of OTC trading at Shearson
Lehman Hutton, says the turbulence overseas may make U.S.
markets the investment arena of choice.</p>
<p>He notes that yesterday's losses in unlisted shares were
tempered by sharp gains in the bond market, where a "flight
to quality" helped drive Treasury prices sharply higher.
Long-term Treasury issues were up more than a point late
yesterday.</p>
<p>The bond market rally came after Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan told the House Banking Committee
panel that the U.S. may attract disproportionate capital
inflows as investors around the world seek to diversify risk.</p>
<p>Steve VanBrunt, trader at Nikko Securities Co.
International, says his firm was moderately active yesterday,
with an equal amount of buying and selling from Japanese
accounts.</p>
<p>Daiwa's Mr. Schraff says his firm has seen "a lot of
selling" in the American Depositary Receipts of Japanese
companies, much of it by other U.S. brokerage firms.</p>
<p>Many Japanese ADRs opened on gains following a rise in
Japanese share prices Tuesday, but fell during yesterday's
session here.</p>
<p>The OTC selling was heavy enough for some traders to
expect a weak opening today, regardless of what happened in
Tokyo.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of traffic," says William H. Sulya, head of
OTC trading at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, Mo. "It
looks like it's going to carry right into {today}."</p>
<p>Total Nasdaq volume rose to 138.4 million shares yesterday
from Tuesday's 134.8 million shares.</p>
<p>OTC stocks that fell in price outnumbered those that
gained, with 830 winners and 1,105 losers.</p>
<p>National Market System volume eased to 100,371,400 shares
from 102,445,900 shares Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes the OTC market's
largest non-financial stocks, dropped 2.66, or 0.61%, to
430.96, while the Nasdaq Financial 100 Index lost 3.21, or
0.82%, to 389.37.</p>
<p>On the most-active list, Pinkerton's closed unchanged from
its offering price of 14 on volume of more than 1.3 million
shares.</p>
<p>The company's two million share initial public offering
was priced earlier yesterday at the low end of its proposed
range of $14 to $16 a share.</p>
<p>The security and investigation firm was immortalized in
American folklore for protecting the railways from such
scourges as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.</p>
<p>Al Berger, Pinkerton's chief operating officer, says the
firm was hired for the task by Abraham Lincoln, who was then
chief counsel for the Illinois Central Railway.</p>
<p>American Brands bought the company from the Pinkerton
family in 1983 and sold it to California Plant Protection
Inc. five years later. Pinkerton's was then merged with
California Plant Protection to form the present company.</p>
<p>One person who benefited from the initial public stock
offering was Thomas W. Wathen, chairman, chief executive and
president of the company.</p>
<p>According to the preliminary prospectus, Mr. Wathen bought
his 4,207,290 shares at an average price of two cents each,
or about $84,000. In the initial public offering, he sold
666,667 shares at $14 each, which, excluding the underwriting
fee, netted $9.3 million. He will own about 64% of the firm
after completion of the offering.</p>
<p>The balance of 1,333,333 shares sold in the offering were
issued by the company.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the sale of the company's shares will be
applied to reducing the $76.5 million long-term debt that
remains on the balance sheet from previous changes of
ownership.</p>
<p>Mr. Wathen has promised to apply at least $4.5 million of
his proceeds against $7.5 million in loans that he has
outstanding to the company.</p>
<p>Among Japanese ADRs that fell today, Makita Electric lost
1/2 to 85 after opening at 88 on a 2 1/2 point gain;
Ito-Yokado ended down 4 1/4 from Tuesday's close at 89 1/4,
and down from its opening at 92; Tokio Marine & Fire
Insurance fell 1 to 41 1/2, after opening with only a 1/8
point loss.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Laidlaw's class B shares eased 3/8 to 21 1/8,
while its less actively traded class A shares added 1/4 to 21
1/4. The transportation and waste treatment company reported
that it would sell its Byers Transport unit for an
undisclosed amount. Laidlaw also announced that it earned
$60.3 million in the second quarter ended in February, up
from the $42 million it earned in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>A secondary offering of 2.5 million Sequent Computer
System shares was priced late Tuesday at $24 each. The stock
closed at 24 1/4, down 7/8 from Tuesday.</p>
<p>Oilgear added 2 1/2 to 26. The company reported late
Tuesday that 1989 net income was $1.83 a share, even with the
$1.83 reported a year ago.</p>
<p>LIN Broadcasting rose 2 1/2 to 68 3/4, reflecting the
distribution of McCaw Cellular Communications class A shares
yesterday to LIN shareholders.</p>
<p>Sevenson Environmental gained 1 3/8 to 12 1/2 after
getting two contracts worth $15.5 million.</p>
<p>Intermetrics jumped 1 1/4 to 4 3/4 after declaring a
special 80-cent dividend along with its initial annual
dividend of 20 cents. The dividends will be payable to
holders of record April 30, but pay dates for the dividends
have not been set.</p>
