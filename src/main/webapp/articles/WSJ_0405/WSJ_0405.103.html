	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- A federal grand jury is investigating whether
Georgia-Pacific Corp. inflated for tax purposes the value of
Florida swampland that it donated to a state water management
agency in 1984, a grand jury witness said.
   A spokeswoman for Georgia-Pacific, an Atlanta-based
forest-products concern, declined to comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>John Flanagan, deputy assistant executive director of the
Suwannee River Water Management District, in Live Oak, Fla.,
said he and another agency member appeared under subpoena
before a grand jury in Atlanta March 13.</p>
<p>Mr. Flanagan said Martin Weinstein, an assistant U.S.
attorney, inquired about the circumstances under which
Georgia-Pacific donated 5,400 acres of land to the water
management district, a conservation and management agency, in
1984. He said the grand jury also subpoenaed the agency's
records related to Georgia-Pacific's donation of the Santa Fe
Swamp tract, which is north of Little Santa Fe Lake in
Bradford County.</p>
<p>Mr. Flanagan said the U.S. attorney is focusing on a $24
million tax deduction that Georgia-Pacific took as a result
of the donation. Georgia-Pacific reportedly purchased the
land in 1981 for $1.9 million. Prosecutors couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
