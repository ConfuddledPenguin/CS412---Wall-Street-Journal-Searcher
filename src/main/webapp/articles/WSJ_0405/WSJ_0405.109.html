	<p class="article-leader">Consolidated Rail Corp. said it received a permanent
injunction, barring the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way
Employees from striking the freight railroad.
   Philadelphia-based Conrail said a federal court in
Pennsylvania ruled that current talks on a new labor contract
conformed with the Railway Labor Act and that the threatened
strike violated a provision of the law.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The union represents 6,000 employees who maintain
Conrail's tracks. Jeff Zeh, international president of the
Detroit-based union, said that "obviously we're
disappointed."</p>
<p>Mr. Zeh objected to what he called "the slow pace" of the
negotiations, and he said that Conrail's plan to restructure
-- including a stock buy-back, an employee stock ownership
plan, and work-force cuts -- would hurt the union.</p>
