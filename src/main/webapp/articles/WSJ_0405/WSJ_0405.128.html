	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Peter Sidoti, former health-care analyst at
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., recalls the fireworks when he
wrote a negative report about one of the firm's
investment-banking clients.
   The corporate-finance department "went to Mike Milken, who
called up the research director and gave him hell for
jeopardizing business with a corporate-finance client," he
says. While his boss stood up for him, Mr. Sidoti says, in
the end the report wasn't issued.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wall Street securities analysts have always had to fight
pressures to inflate their opinions of the companies they
follow. But these pressures are mounting as Wall Street
struggles to survive the recession gripping the securities
industry.</p>
<p>To some extent, the pressures come from outside -- as in
the recent case of a Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. analyst
fired after Donald Trump threatened to sue because of the
analyst's comments.</p>
<p>But analysts are also feeling the heat more than ever from
within their own firms. Brokerage houses insist they maintain
a "Chinese Wall," completely separating their corporate
finance and research departments. Yet at time of
belt-tightening on Wall Street, when a number of firms have
been shrinking research staffs, many analysts worry that an
inappropriate opinion can land them in the frying pan.</p>
<p>"It's increasingly common that the investment-banking
division would get analysts fired," says Barry Greenfield,
portfolio manager of Fidelity Investments' Fidelity Fund.
"I've seen some research departments on Wall Street fall
apart in the past few years."</p>
<p>Robert Diener, president of American Health Properties
Inc., a real-estate investment trust, says that some
investment bankers have "implied that ratings {on his
company} would rise if we did business with them."</p>
<p>Some investment professionals say that analysts face less
pressure at firms that lack a strong corporate-finance
business. Even where the pressures do exist, many analysts do
manage to withstand them. But enough don't that at least some
of the people who use their reports are dubious about their
opinions.</p>
<p>"The first thing I look at is whether the firm is the
investment banker for the company" the analyst is
recommending, says Todd Schubert, an analyst with USAA
Investment Management. "I'm a little skeptical and cynical at
this point."</p>
<p>Whatever the reasons, brokerage houses make many more
"buy" recommendations than "sell" recommendations. A tally of
Wall Street recommendations on 1,500 companies by Zacks
Investment Research Inc., in Chicago, shows that 44.6% are
"buys" or "strong buys," and 45.6% are "holds." Only 9.7% are
"sells" or "strong sells."</p>
<p>Mr. Sidoti's experience at Drexel, which happened in 1987,
illustrates the internal pressures on Wall Street analysts.
He says there was "a lot of yelling and screaming" when he
wrote the negative report on the firm's corporate-finance
client. He declines to name the company, but says the report
"was rewritten to make it more palatable." But not even that
was enough to head off intervention by junk-bond king Michael
Milken, he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Sidoti is currently at County NatWest Securities USA,
whose president and chief executive officer, Arthur Kirsch,
was Drexel's research director at the time of the incident.
He "stood up for me," Mr. Sidoti says.</p>
<p>"Clearly, we did work with the corporate-finance
department, but we went out of our way to maintain
independence," says Mr. Kirsch, who confirms the incident.</p>
<p>John Katz, who was associate research director at Drexel,
is more blunt: "Milken was strongly supportive of his
clients, and did a hell of a job for them."</p>
<p>The research department "did our darndest to resist"
pressure from corporate finance, says Mr. Katz. "Sometimes we
won, and sometimes along the way compromises took place. I've
certainly seen other research materials go out that made me
throw up."</p>
<p>Still, he says, "We made it clear when we had a bias, when
we had an underwriting relationship." As a result, he says,
the thinking was that institutional investors using the
Drexel research reports had a red flag, "and unless they were
completely stupid, they'd do a double check with someone with
less involvement."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr. Milken denies the incident. A
spokesman for Drexel, which is in liquidation, declines to
comment.</p>
<p>The sort of pressures encountered by Mr. Sidoti have
become more common as Wall Street firms, faced with depressed
retail-brokerage business, junk-bond jitters and a sharp
falloff in merger-and-acquisition activity, fight to hold
onto a piece of the shrinking underwriting pie. "Everyone's
trying to pay the rent right now, so the pressure's greater,"
says Kenneth Statz, a managing director at Chancellor Capital
Management.</p>
<p>In November, Morgan Stanley & Co. chemical analyst Paul
Leming found himself in trouble when Occidental Petroleum
Corp. disagreed with his negative comments. Among other
things, Mr. Leming observed that the price of Occidental
shares rose when 91-year-old Chairman Armand Hammer underwent
surgery for a heart pacemaker and suggested that Morgan
Stanley customers be ready to sell if Mr. Hammer died.</p>
<p>Mr. Leming declines to comment, but people familiar with
the situation say that Occidental Petroleum officials
complained to Morgan Stanley and that the report was amended.
Mr. Leming subsequently stopped covering Occidental and has
since been promoted to principal at the investment banking
firm. Morgan Stanley declined to comment, as did Occidental
Petroleum.</p>
<p>Even if the corporate-finance side is quiescent, analysts
can still get their arms twisted. "The pressure is always
there" to give favorable ratings, says Jack Rivkin, director
of research for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</p>
<p>Most common, he says, is a company's "explicitly or
implicitly threatening to withdraw {investment banking}
business." Intimidation also arises "when you run into a
company run by an egomaniac, or when you run into a small
company."</p>
<p>When a Shearson analyst downgraded one stock, Mr. Rivkin
remembers, the company's chief executive wouldn't speak to
him for four years -- and then, only after the analyst
upgraded the stock.</p>
<p>Jonathan Gray, who follows savings and loans for Sanford
C. Bernstein, recalls that when he put out negative reports
on Financial Corp. of America, "the company tried to shut me
up with the implied threat of a lawsuit." But, he said, the
chairman of his firm backed him up. Soon thereafter, FCA went
bankrupt.</p>
<p>Whatever the source of the pressure, Wall Street research
chiefs say it is essential to resist. If an analyst comes to
be "viewed as a mouthpiece for investment banking, their
career is over," says Michael Culp, director of research at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. As far as he is concerned,
"The best mark of an analyst is having two managements that
want you dead."</p>
<p>Still, analysts sometimes find it possible to skirt the
issue. More and more, brokerage firms are switching from a
simple buy-hold-sell rating system to one with as many as six
layers that may include: strong buy, buy, outperform,
attractive, hold, accumulate, neutral, long-term attractive,
underperform, sell and strong sell.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, the gradations make it possible for analysts
to express subtle differences in their feelings about
companies. But some analysts and institutional investors say
the new ratings can also allow considerable wiggle room.</p>
<p>As for making an outright sell recommendation, some
analysts joke that it would be practically heretical.
Besides, says one analyst, "a `buy' is more sexy." Brokers
"can call everyone who owns {the stock}, and everyone who
doesn't."</p>
