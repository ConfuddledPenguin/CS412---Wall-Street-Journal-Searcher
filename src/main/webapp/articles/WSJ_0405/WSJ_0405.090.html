	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the House finance
subcommittee introduced a bill to crack down on penny-stock
fraud and better regulate small stocks.
   The legislation, offered by Rep. Edward Markey (D.,
Mass.), would broaden the power of the Securities and
Exchange Commission to bar "crooked promoters and consultants
from the securities business."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bill also would force all penny stocks to be traded
through an automated quotation system in an effort to bolster
surveillance and information flow. The system would also help
investors get more accurate pricing of the stocks.</p>
<p>The bill received immediate support from Rep. John Dingell
(D., Mich.), chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee,
who joined as a co-sponsor and called penny-stock fraud "a
national embarrassment."</p>
<p>Penny-stock fraud has emerged as a critical enforcement
problem for the SEC, which has set up a task force to deal
with the issue. By one estimate, such fraud bilks investors
of $2 billion annually, though regulators haven't been able
to certify that figure.</p>
