	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bairnco Corp. reaffirmed its plan to spin off
its Keene Corp. unit to shareholders, but it said the
insurance coverage that until now has protected Keene from
protracted asbestos-related legal settlements may be in
doubt.
   Bairnco's shares have fallen more than 50% in the past
week and have lost nearly two-thirds of their value since the
start of the year. On Tuesday, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
removed the stock from its recommended list, citing
uncertainty about the asbestos litigation Keene faces and the
adequacy of its insurance coverage.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The litigation stems from Baldwin-Ehret-Hill, a business
that Keene acquired in 1968. The BEH unit was shed in 1974
although it stopped making products containing asbestos in
1972.</p>
<p>Bairnco's shares rebounded a bit yesterday, closing at
$6.25, up 12.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.</p>
<p>Bairnco said in its annual report, filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission last Monday, that at the
end of 1989 about 70,300 bodily-injury cases were pending,
and in the first quarter, "new bodily-injury cases have
continued to be filed at a high rate."</p>
<p>From the mid-1970s through the first quarter of 1990,
Keene's settlement and defense costs of settling nearly
60,000 bodily-injury cases totaled $260 million, of which
insurers paid $251 million, Bairnco's filing said.</p>
<p>Keene estimates that at March 31, it had about $143
million of applicable insurance coverage remaining for
asbestos claims, "but substantially all" of it "is either
subject to litigation or dispute or will not be available
until after such insurance litigation or disputes or other
issues are resolved," the annual report says.</p>
<p>Further, although "a large number" of bodily-injury cases
have been resolved for Keene, the company said it can't
predict the number of future claims or the rate of
dispositions.</p>
<p>Keene also has $30 million of insurance coverage that it
calls "uncertain" because it is "owed to Keene by insolvent"
insurers. Keene is trying to recover part of the amount from
liquidators and state guaranty funds.</p>
<p>The company said it is confident that it will win the
insurance litigation.</p>
<p>Keene makes heat-shielding devices. After the spinoff,
which was announced in January, Bairnco plans to concentrate
on specialty laminates and adhesives, shielding systems, and
cutting products.</p>
<p>"The whole worry is about this asbestos problem," says
Arthur Buffman, analyst at Jesup & Lamont Inc. The analyst
notes that recently, institutions held about half Bairnco's
shares, creating a "herd instinct. Until that dries up, it'll
be a problem temporarily. They've got terribly good people
running the show, and in time they'll resolve it."</p>
<p>Mr. Buffman said that "even though they might not be
justified, people are putting in" asbestos claims. Bairnco
said in its filing that "recent claims data suggest that
increasing proportions of bodily-injury cases are being
filed" by people who had only minimal exposure to asbestos
and are less likely to have suffered injury.</p>
<p>Keene also is a defendant in some 83 property-damage cases
pending at Dec. 31. In January, three more were filed, the
filing said, adding that 29 states are seeking to hold Keene
and other companies liable for asbestos abatement in public
buildings in those states.</p>
