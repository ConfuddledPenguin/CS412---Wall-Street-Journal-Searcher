	<p class="article-leader">Just as countries compete in a world-wide market where
goods and services are exchanged, they also compete in the
market for people. The U.S. accepted about 600,000 legal
immigrants annually during the 1980s, not including the 2.5
million persons who applied for amnesty under the provisions
of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act. Including
illegals, more immigrants were admitted during the 1980s than
in any other decade in American history.
   By presenting a specific set of economic opportunities,
and by pursuing an immigration policy that prevents the entry
of some persons but encourages the entry of others, the U.S.
makes a particular type of offer in the "immigration market."
The evidence is clear that the American offer is becoming
progressively less attractive to the world's most talented
people.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since the immigration reforms of 1965, U.S. immigration
law has encouraged family reunification and discouraged the
arrival of skilled immigrants: 75% of legal immigrants in
1987 were granted entry because they were related to an
American citizen or resident, while only 4% were admitted
because they possessed useful skills. As a result, the skills
of immigrants entering the U.S. have declined sharply over
the past few decades relative to the skills of natives. Newly
arrived immigrants admitted in the late 1950s had about half
a year more schooling than natives did and earned about 8%
less per hour. Immigrants admitted in the late 1970s had 0.7
fewer years of schooling and earned about 17% less than
natives.</p>
<p>The U.S. competes for immigrants with several other
countries, but its main rivals are Australia and Canada.
Among them, these three countries account for two-thirds of
the world's legal immigration. But since 1965, Australia and
Canada have succeeded better in drawing the most talented
immigrants. While the predicted lifetime earnings -- the best
indicator of the value of the technical and intellectual
skills that immigrants bring with them -- of the immigrants
who entered the U.S.in the late 1970s were 30% lower than
those of American natives, immigrants to Canada who arrived
in Canada during that period are projected to earn only 13%
less than Canadian natives. Late 1970s immigrants to
Australia will likely earn about the same as Australian
natives.</p>
<p>By contrast, those immigrants who arrived in the U.S. in
the early 1960s will have lifetime earnings just 7% below
those of natives -- a figure exactly to the performance of
contemporary immigrants to Australia and only very slightly
worse than the 3% less that early 1960s immigrants to Canada
will earn.</p>
<p>The flagging performance of immigrants to the U.S. is due
in part to the changes in their national origins. The
national origin groups that dominate the immigrant flow today
do relatively less well in the labor market than the groups
that dominated earlier flows. For instance, the predicted
lifetime earnings of immigrants from Canada, Germany or
Britain are about 20% higher than those of natives;
immigrants from India or Korea earn about 7% less than
natives; and immigrants from the Dominican Republic, Jamaica
or Mexico earn 30% to 40% less than natives.</p>
<p>One ready explanation for these disparities is that the
skills of workers originating in advanced, industrialized
economies are more easily transferable to the U.S. labor
market than are the skills of persons from less developed
countries. But a subtler cause is at work too: It is the most
skilled workers who wish to leave such countries as Sweden
and Britain.</p>
<p>Because of the wage structure and redistributive income
policies in the European social democracies, the income gap
between the highly skilled and the less skilled is small.
Highly skilled workers are not well rewarded and the less
skilled are protected from poor labor market outcomes. This
creates an incentive for those highly skilled people to
emigrate. In poor countries, on the other hand, the wage gap
tends to be very large, and it is the less skilled who have
the most incentive to leave.</p>
<p>The problem with unskilled immigrants is not, as is often
supposed, that they reduce the living standards of native
workers. A 10% increase in the number of immigrants decreases
the average native wage by at most two-tenths of 1%, and has
little effect on the unemployment rate of practically all
native groups, including the black poor.</p>
<p>In fact, even a large and unexpected increase in the
supply of immigrants -- such as the arrival of 125,000 Cubans
into the Miami area during the 1980 Mariel boatlift -- does
little harm to native earnings and employment. The trend in
the wages and unemployment rates of both black and white
natives in Miami over the 1979-1985 period differs little
from the trends observed in a number of comparable cities,
none of which received anything like the Miami influx.</p>
<p>But though unskilled immigration doesn't deprive natives
of jobs or wages, it does have other costs. The poverty rate
of newly arrived immigrants admitted in the late 1960s was
five percentage points higher than that of natives, while the
poverty rate of immigrants admitted in the late 1970s was 18
percentage points higher. Similarly, immigrant households
admitted in the late 1970s are about two percentage points
likelier to receive public assistance than immigrants who
arrived in the early 1960s.</p>
<p>The differences in poverty and welfare recipiency rates
among national origin groups are huge. Only 7% or 8% of the
immigrants from Britain or Germany are living below the
poverty line, but 14% of Koreans, 26% of Mexicans, and 34% of
immigrants from the Dominican Republic are. The native
poverty rate is 12%. Similarly, only 5% of German and British
households are on welfare, but 10% of Filipino households,
17% of Cuban households and 26% of Dominican households
receive public assistance. Eight percent of native households
live on welfare.</p>
<p>The shift toward a more unskilled immigrant flow increases
the burden of income transfer programs. There really is a
fundamental conflict between the welfare state and
immigration. Before welfare benefits became widely available
in the 1960s, prospective immigrants to the U.S. would make
their decision based on a comparison of the economic
opportunities available to them here and in their country of
origin. Now they compare welfare opportunities too. Without
welfare, the U.S. could open its borders entirely, knowing
that those who were needed would stay, while those who
weren't would probably leave.</p>
<p>National income and tax revenues are substantially lower
than they would have been if the U.S. had attracted more
skilled immigrants. If the people who immigrated in the late
1970s had been as skilled as those who came in the early
1960s, national income would be at least $6 billion higher
and tax revenues would have increased by $1.5 billion per
year.</p>
<p>In both Canada and Australia, visas are now allocated
through a point system, which grades visa applicants in terms
of educational attainment, age and occupational background.
The presence of relatives in the country is only one factor
among many. Canada and Australia also "sell" visas to persons
who have sufficient financial resources to open businesses
and create employment opportunities for natives. But it may
well be, for instance, that the skilled persons who choose
Australia or Canada would have preferred the more favorable
tax policies or labor market conditions provided by the U.S.
If American law were different, they might have come here
instead.</p>
<p>Of course, a visa allocation system based on the
applicant's ability to pay discriminates against people who
lack these financial resources. Similarly, a point system
discriminates against people who lack the favored skill
characteristics. Any visa allocation system, however, is
bound to lead to inequities, and the inequities that would be
created by a merit-oriented immigration policy would be no
more egregious than those associated with present or previous
immigration policies. Throughout the first half of the
century, the nationalorigins quota system flatly prohibited
the entry of Asians; current policy prevents the entry of
most persons who do not have relatives in the U.S.</p>
<p>Immigration policy is inherently discriminatory. It
selectively picks and chooses from the many applicants. It
may stress national origin, or skills, or financial
resources, or family ties, or any combination of
characteristics that Americans deem economically and
politically desirable, and consistent with the country's
values and beliefs. Because there are only a limited number
of visas, the policy has to restrict or prohibit the entry of
many classes of persons. Inevitably, difficult choices must
be made.</p>
