	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon postponed until today at 3:07
p.m. EDT, the maiden launch of the Pegasus winged rocket. The
launch, which had been scheduled for yesterday, was scrapped
because of cloudy weather. Pegasus managers were concerned
that flying the rocket through clouds could inadvertently set
off a spark that would ignite the rocket.
   Pegasus, built by privately held Orbital Sciences Corp. of
Fairfax, Va., is the first U.S. rocket launcher developed
since the space shuttle. The crewless rocket is dropped from
the wing of a B-52 over the Pacific Ocean and is supposed to
vault into space carrying two small, government-owned
satellites.</p>
