	<p class="article-leader">Speeding toward Florida aboard Amtrak's Auto Train, a
tall, 78-year-old man pokes through the swaying passenger
cars, looking for trouble.
   "Broken toilet," he scribbles on a sheet of paper. "Buffet
car line too long." His sleeping-car berth also flunks. "Worn
spring," scrawls W. Graham Claytor Jr., Amtrak's chairman and
president. "Unsatisfactory," he grumps to a train attendant.
"It has to be fixed."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stern and demanding, Mr. Claytor has worried Amtrak, nit
by nit, into the best shape of its 19-year history. Now, he
is promising that Amtrak will do by the year 2000 what hardly
any other passenger rail system in the world does: operate
without taxpayer subsidies. Success would mark the "upset of
the century in passenger railroading," says William Withuhn,
a rail historian at the Smithsonian Institution.</p>
<p>Despite the odds, some employees and academics expect Mr.
Claytor to succeed. Eight years ago, government subsidies
covered 52% of Amtrak's operating costs. Now, the subsidies
have dropped to $604 million (from $896 million in 1981) and
cover only 28% of those costs. "If I were a betting man, I'd
put money on him," Mr. Withuhn says.</p>
<p>Mr. Claytor's progress has surprised many skeptics. Called
from retirement in 1982 to head the nation's passenger
railroad, the former Southern Railway president and Navy
secretary has fought sloppy service, has increased revenue
and has controlled costs. His steady financial progress has
won him allies in Congress and derailed federal budget
cutters.</p>
<p>"We were asking if Amtrak was a bottomless pit and did we
need it," recalls Rep. William Lehman, a Florida Democrat and
the chairman of the House transportation appropriations
subcommittee. "Now we're saying let's modernize it."</p>
<p>But the tracks are littered with obstacles. Most immediate
is the Bush administration's hope to end Amtrak's subsidies
in fiscal 1991 -- far earlier than Mr. Claytor would like.
Although Congress isn't likely to approve such a cutoff, Mr.
Claytor still must find capital funds. He needs, over the
next 10 years, $1.5 billion to $2 billion to expand Amtrak's
skeletal network so that it can generate the revenue to run
on its own.</p>
<p>Mr. Claytor also faces problems of low levels of service
and, because of lagging capital outlays, overworked
equipment. Except for the Boston-to-Washington Northeast
Corridor and a few other busy lines, service on most of
Amtrak's 24,000 miles of routes consists of one train a day.
At Chicago's Union Station, John Skinner, an Amtrak assistant
superintendent, tells subordinates that the oil-splattered
diesel locomotive on a train ready to depart looks like a
"piece of junk."</p>
<p>Partly to make up for any reductions in federal operating
subsidies, Mr. Claytor wants legislation to relieve Amtrak of
$135 million a year in employee retirement costs that he
believes should be borne by freight railroads or the federal
government. He also is trying to persuade the Urban Mass
Transportation Administration to pick up more of the costs
that Amtrak incurs because commuter railroads heavily use the
Northeast Corridor.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Claytor is lobbying in Congress to get -- if
the federal gasoline tax is raised -- a penny a gallon of it
assigned to Amtrak's capital needs. Meanwhile, he lined up
$105 million in private financing for 104 new passenger cars
last year.</p>
<p>And he is coaxing states and communities along Amtrak
routes to pay for modernizing stations, adding trains and
improving track. But when he refused to commit additional
funds to the busy line between San Diego and Los Angeles last
December, he got an angry reaction. "He never takes any
initiative to improve the service" on that line, says James
Mills, a former Amtrak chairman who heads the Los Angeles-San
Diego Rail Corridor Agency.</p>
<p>"We're not a philanthropic organization," Mr. Claytor
replies. "If we did everything everybody wanted, we'd go
broke."</p>
<p>In addition to finding new money, Mr. Claytor's plan
depends on wringing more costs out of rail labor, which has
already agreed to new work rules to help Amtrak. The changes,
Amtrak acknowledges, were worth about $50 million a year -- a
significant sum, perhaps, but minor compared with Amtrak's
fiscal 1989 salaries and benefits of $1.03 billion.</p>
<p>Shortly after arriving at Amtrak, Mr. Claytor took
advantage of 1983 legislation and hired his own crews to run
the Northeast Corridor trains. He paid them a week's wages
for 40 hours worked. Previously, the trains were operated
under contract with Consolidated Rail Corp., whose crews got
a day's wages for each 100 miles traveled. By operating one
of Amtrak's speedy Metroliners round trip between New York
and Washington -- less than eight hours' work -- they earned
4 1/2 days' pay.</p>
<p>"Everything I worked for has been taken away," complains
John Harrison, an engineer from Elkton, Md. He now works 20
days a month, twice as many as before. Joseph J. Carella,
another engineer, says, "I was making about $1,000 a week
seven or eight years ago working three days a week. I'm now
making about $1,000 a week working five days."</p>
<p>Later, Mr. Claytor negotiated the right to hire his own
crews nationwide.</p>
<p>"We're damned frustrated with Amtrak," says Richard
Kilroy, head of the Railway Labor Executives' Association,
which represents rail unions. "It is demanding cutbacks . . .
when we have been the main ingredient in their success."</p>
<p>When Mr. Claytor took over at Amtrak, his crusty bluntness
and keen eye for railroad operating details amazed some
staffers accustomed to the collegial style of his
predecessor, Alan Boyd. "Details bore me," Mr. Boyd says.
"I'm much more interested in conceptualizing."</p>
<p>To focus managers' attention, Mr. Claytor bombarded them
with reports of broken doors, burned-out lights and delays.
After one trip, he wrote 10 pages worth. Now, each of
Amtrak's 18 top executives must file a dozen trip reports a
year.</p>
<p>"Mr. Claytor leads by being vociferously demanding, and he
doesn't hesitate to chew people out," says Timothy Gardner, a
vice president. "When he started here, people were terrified
of him, but now there's a lot of affection for him."</p>
<p>When staffers gave him a paste-on skin thermometer said to
measure stress, he obligingly affixed it to his hand and
noted its "calm" reading. "I don't get stress, I give
stress," he joked.</p>
<p>Mr. Claytor instituted training programs for managers and
promoted those showing the tightest grasp of railroad
operations. Eight years ago, "the people they had in middle
and lower management were bush league," says M.D. "Mike"
Ongerth, an assistant vice president of Southern Pacific
Transportation Co. "Now, I see a very professional cadre of
managers."</p>
<p>Amtrak likes to point to its gains in operations. Revenue
increased to $1.27 billion last year from $758.8 million in
1984, and Metroliner revenue doubled. Ridership is up on
Amtrak's Western long-distance trains, which cater to
vacationers with movies, scenery guides and meals prepared
from fresh ingredients.</p>
<p>Stations are being rebuilt. For $150 million of federal
and private funds, Washington's Union Station has been
restored to its 1907 grandeur.</p>
<p>Mr. Claytor capitalized on higher demand for rail travel
to raise fares 55% in eight years. He has expanded income
from real estate, mail handling, fiber-optic cable leases and
the commuter trains Amtrak operates under contract for
Maryland and Massachusetts.</p>
<p>All the while, he repeatedly fought off Reagan
administration attacks on Amtrak's "mobile money-burning
machine" that serves less than 1% of intercity travelers. In
time, he convinced a majority in Congress of Amtrak's
financial progress and its growing popularity among travelers
put off by highway and airport congestion.</p>
<p>A Harvard Law graduate who skippered destroyer escorts in
World War II, Mr. Claytor practiced law for 20 years before
joining Southern Railway in 1963. He quickly became chief
executive, retiring in 1977 to serve as Navy secretary,
acting transportation secretary and deputy defense secretary
under President Carter.</p>
<p>Steam locomotives and passenger trains fascinate Mr.
Claytor; his Georgetown townhouse has floor-to-ceiling
shelves of antique toy trains. But his job occasionally
requires a cutback in train service, a step he has proved
willing to take. For example, he overcame opposition from St.
Petersburg, Fla., officials to end service there and
substitute buses from the Tampa railroad station, saving $1.3
million a year.</p>
<p>But his style draws criticism. "Claytor is an arrogant
aristocrat, autocrat and plutocrat," says Austin Coates, the
president of the United Rail Passenger Alliance, a passenger
group. "He runs Amtrak like the military, and that's a morale
killer." Howard Prevette, a Galesburg, Ill., conductor, is
still smarting from losing 10 days' pay because last October
he failed to alert an engineer to slow down past a track
gang. "They ought to take {Mr. Claytor's} paycheck away from
him whenever he makes a mistake," Mr. Prevette says.</p>
<p>Mr. Claytor defends tough discipline. "Operating a
railroad is, in effect, a military organization and has to be
done as close to letter-perfect as can be," he says. "If a
rule is in effect, by God, you got to comply with it."</p>
<p>Others are skeptical of Mr. Claytor's plan to make Amtrak
break even. "He obviously has an incentive to say that
eventually Amtrak will be self-sufficient," says David Boaz
of the Cato Institute, a conservative policy group. "He is
trying to keep the subsidies going until 1999, and in the
year 2000 there will be another excuse."</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Claytor has had setbacks. A costly move to
extend train service to Atlantic City, N.J., last May has
failed to wean many gamblers from cars and buses. And Amtrak
trains have been delayed by freight railroads' moves to
consolidate traffic on fewer lines. When the Illinois Central
said it wanted to reroute Amtrak's City of New Orleans to a
slow-speed, unsignaled track south of Memphis, Mr. Claytor
dug in his heels. "Wholly unsatisfactory. We'd get an
injunction," he says. Edward Moyers, the Illinois Central
president, now plays down his proposal as "just a
discussion."</p>
<p>Mr. Claytor's attempt to cut costs and keep passenger cars
in service by postponing some maintenance led to passenger
complaints about worn carpets, ripped seats and broken
toilets. He reversed the policy in 1988. Now, Amtrak puts its
cars in the shop for preventive maintenance at least three
times a year.</p>
<p>Mr. Claytor has updated some Amtrak repair shops with
assembly-line methods he used at the highly efficient
Southern. But he still sees big savings possible if Amtrak
ends rigid craft distinctions among shop workers. And he says
he can raise productivity by building shelters over
passenger-car yards in New York and Chicago to shield
mechanics servicing cars in rain and snow.</p>
<p>To increase ridership, Amtrak wants to buy hundreds of
passenger cars, including new Viewliner cars now being tested
as replacements for 40-year-old dining and sleeping cars. To
reduce Metroliner delays and increase efficiency, he plans to
install servicing facilities on station platforms and to
rebuild the cars to enable engineers to operate the trains
from either end. In Sweden, he recently looked at tilt trains
that could take curves faster.</p>
<p>Despite his age, Mr. Claytor says he hasn't any plans to
retire from his $99,500-a-year job in the "foreseeable
future." He received a vote of confidence last fall when
supporters in Congress roundly defeated a motion to cut off
Amtrak subsidies.</p>
<p>Rep. Robert Walker, a Pennsylvania Republican who had
proposed the cutoff, complained that "Amtrak is eating up
$600 million of subsidies while we fail to make
transportation investments for the next century." But Mr.
Claytor, relishing his victory, comments: "Mr. Walker says
Amtrak is the past. In my opinion, it's the past, present and
future."</p>
