	<p class="article-leader">There is something a little disembodied about the $21.5
billion Clean Air bill and indeed about the politics of
environmentalism itself.
   West Virginia, for instance, has just endured a statewide
strike by its public-school teachers, who indeed don't make
much, because it simply doesn't have the money to give them a
significant pay increase. New York City, besieged with human
problems, is about to cut back its police, fire and
sanitation services because it is so hard-pressed for
revenue. School budgets around the country are routinely
being voted down by communities, forcing cancellation of
educational services for students and pitting the elderly
against young families.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet on the day of the Clean Air vote, the President of the
United States is in Indiana, planting a tree and proclaiming
his support. Then 89 Senators, many presumably "representing"
states such as New York or Massachusetts that are engulfed
with human-resource and budget problems, enthusiastically
vote to impose the Clean Air bill's monumental costs and
requirements on their own embattled constituents. America's
wealth is indeed a great achievement, but only a nation this
rich could afford a national legislature so profligate.</p>
<p>We are happy to debate with our opponents the most
appropriate way to provide for and finance a society's needs.
But we wonder if it has occurred to our friends on the left
that there may not be a debate, because the environmental
movement is consuming most of the expanding pie for itself.
Even now, for instance, environmentalist lobbyists such as
Gene Karpinski of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group are
saying this hugely expensive bill isn't enough. They want
more.</p>
<p>The politics of environmentalism is a greatly
underexamined subject. For years now, environmentalism has
been a no-cost vote for America's politicians. From the
President down through the last person in Congress and out
into the state legislatures, the belief has grown that there
is simply no real political opposition to environmentalism's
costs.</p>
<p>It's well established that the President and congressional
Republicans have stiffed their business allies on the Clean
Air bill. Less explored but equally apparent is that the
Democrats in Congress have also stiffed their normal
constituencies -- the poor and the working class, especially
industrial workers (and that assumes that the national
Democrats have anything more than an I-gave-at-the-office
commitment to the poor anymore).</p>
<p>Small businesses are owned by and employ people loyal to
both parties. And though they are screaming that the bill's
provisions will crush many of them, they have been ignored.
(We loved the story in yesterday's Journal that described the
big dry cleaner who said the bill is good for his business
because the mom-and-pop competition will go belly up and
he'll get their work.)</p>
<p>High-cost environmentalism, as we've argued before, is
essentially an upper-middle-class movement, as is much else
in national politics today. None of these thirty-something
types is going to be burdened by the Clean Air bill's costs;
none of them will stop ordering from Land's End or Eddie
Bauer catalogs. But we wonder how many of the people who call
themselves traditional Democrats, if given the chance, would
have voted for this bill. How many, for instance, would have
voted for the ethanol-gasoline provision, which alone could
raise the cost of a gallon of gas by 10 to 25 cents? Or how
many workers would have agreed, as their representatives did,
that it was a good idea to simply load a lot of the bill's
costs onto the auto industry? Car buyers, already buckling
under the costs of new cars, will pay more.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say the public wants all this. Even
assuming that they did so in the past, we're not as certain
about the future, when so many other claims on financial
resources exist. Keep in mind, for instance, that many local
voters are learning that the huge amounts they spent to rip
out asbestos from their school systems was a pointless
environmental fiasco. It's very possible that with the $21
billion Clean Air bill (and surely that is a gross
underestimate), the politicians and environmentalists have
gone a bridge too far.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, voters spent billions to pay for
catalytic converters, smokestack retrofits and other
effective environmental technologies. By any measure the
American environment is cleaner. Auto tailpipe emissions, for
example, are 96% cleaner than before 1970. It was a huge and,
on balance, worthwhile commitment by the public. Now, a
little more than one year into the Bush presidency, all these
people are suddenly being told that their air is so filthy
that they must pay at least $21 billion each year to do more.</p>
<p>The political industry obviously thinks that this
environmental cost mandating can go on forever and that the
public will thank them for the imposition. We doubt it. The
fact that the middle-class or poorer constituencies who will
carry the weight of the costs in the Bush-Mitchell bill are
disorganized now does not mean they will remain so. Nor is it
likely that a situation will persist in which no public agent
or politician speaks up in their defense.</p>
