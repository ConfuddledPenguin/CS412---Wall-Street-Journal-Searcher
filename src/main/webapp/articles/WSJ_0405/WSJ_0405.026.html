	<p class="article-leader">How did the U.S. end up allied with a corrupt,
drug-dealing thug like Manuel Noriega? This is the major
question addressed by two new books, John Dinges's "Our Man
in Panama: How General Noriega Used the U.S. -- and Made
Millions in Drugs and Arms" (Random House, 320 pages,
$21.95), and Frederick Kempe's "Divorcing the Dictator:
America's Bungled Affair With Noriega" (Putnam, 469 pages,
$24.95). Mr. Dinges, a contributor to, among others, the
Washington Post and Time magazine, and Mr. Kempe, a Journal
staff reporter, both describe how U.S. administrations
repeatedly opted for short-term benefits over long-term
costs. In the end, it took 25,000 U.S. troops and several
hundred casualties to undo the damage.
   Although both books cover much the same ground, they
differ in a number of ways, with Mr. Kempe, for example,
refusing to downplay the damage done by the Panama policy of
President Carter. To win passage of the controversial Panama
Canal treaties, the Carter administration worked overtime to
whitewash the Omar Torrijos regime of charges involving drug
trafficking, money laundering for the Mafia and secret
dealings with Castro that helped Cuba circumvent the U.S.
trade embargo. After Congress passed the treaties, the Carter
administration had yet another reason to ignore mounting
evidence that Torrijos also was shipping guns and ammunition
to the Sandinistas: Torrijos took the unwanted, deposed Shah
of Iran, extricating the U.S. from a sticky situation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As Mr. Dinges points out, the Carter administration did
remove Manuel Antonio Noriega, then Torrijos's corrupt head
of intelligence, from the U.S. government payroll, after a
history of drug involvement, rape and double-dealing against
the U.S. But as Mr. Kempe shows, Torrijos then went on to
expand his National Guard "with the blessing and assistance
of the U.S.," increasing its budget from $10 million to $100
million in 1978 alone. He argues that the canal negotiations
effectively legitimized the Torrijos regime and allowed it to
create "the system of corruption and broad military power
that Noriega would later exploit to repress a nation."</p>
<p>Once Torrijos died in a 1981 plane crash, Noriega did just
that with no protests from Washington, which calculated, as
Mr. Kempe notes, that "he belonged twenty percent to them and
eighty percent to us." Coddling Noriega, argues Mr. Dinges,
gave the Reagan administration a "staging area for its
expanding military activities in Nicaragua and El Salvador. .
. ." Noriega also conveniently arranged for the fraudulent
election in 1984 of Nicolas Ardito Barletta, "a presidential
candidate he knew Washington would accept," and made "all the
right noises about the war on drugs."</p>
<p>Both Messrs. Kempe and Dinges show that the ties between
the U.S. and Noriega only began fraying after his criminal
behavior became impossible to ignore. The discovery in 1984
of the beheaded corpse of Hugo Spadafora, an outspoken
Noriega critic, prompted Sen. Jesse Helms to hold hearings. A
New York Times front page article in June 1986 linked Noriega
to drugs, Marxist guerrillas, illicit money and the Spadafora
murder. Finally came the Florida indictments against Noriega.</p>
<p>But even then, with a bipartisan, anti-Noriega consensus
in Congress, the Reagan administration could not agree on a
course of action. Economic sanctions were imposed because,
Mr. Kempe argues, they represented "the only step that
neither State nor Defense would block." Mr. Kempe also writes
that Mr. Reagan's subsequent plan to trade the Florida drug
indictments against Noriega for his resignation was opposed
by Vice President Bush because he feared it would provide
Michael Dukakis with campaign ammunition. Both Messrs. Kempe
and Dinges, however, question whether Noriega was serious
about making the deal anyhow.</p>
<p>Only after bungling an opportunity to back an attempted
coup against Noriega last October did the Bush administration
finally decide to dump him. Mr. Kempe regards the invasion as
successful, "if costly." Mr. Dinges, upholding the orthodox
left-liberal line, argues that the invasion is evidence of
Washington's double standard, since the "scale of murder and
repression in Panama under Noriega was far from the killing,
torture and disappearances carried out during much of the
same period in Chile, Argentina, El Salvador and Guatemala
with considerably less U.S. official condemnation."</p>
<p>Both authors conclude that Washington's Panama policy was
improvised from beginning to end. For Mr. Kempe, the Panama
case drives home "the cost to America of abandoning its
democratic principles and implementing short-term foreign
policy goals." Mr. Dinges feels the underlying problem is
that Washington's "real first priority" never was democracy
but "the defense against challenges to U.S. influence in the
area."</p>
<p>Now that Latin America's dictators, with the exception of
Fidel Castro, have passed from the scene, it is tempting to
conclude that the lessons of Panama are no longer relevant.
But the "twilight of the tyrants" was announced once before,
by journalist Tad Szulc in 1959. Shortly thereafter, Latin
America was again ruled largely by dictators. It is hoped
this will not happen again. But if it does, "Divorcing the
Dictator" and "Our Man in Panama" should be required reading
for all U.S. policy makers.</p>
