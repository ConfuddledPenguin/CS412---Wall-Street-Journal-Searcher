payments to minority interests surged to 4.94 billion francs
($865 million) in 1989 from 2.16 billion francs ($378

pursued a variety of acquisitions and alliances to expand its
business internationally.
   Pierre Suard, CGE chief executive officer, said at a news
conference that 1989 was a "very prosperous and rich year"
that saw the electricity group's consolidated revenue rise to

five billion-franc convertible bond issue to help finance
recent acquisitions and to prepare CGE for other
"opportunities" that appear in the future.</p>
