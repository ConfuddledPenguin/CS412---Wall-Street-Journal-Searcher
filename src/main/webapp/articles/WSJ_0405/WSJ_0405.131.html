	<p class="article-leader">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Maxtor Corp. said its bid to buy
substantially all the assets of troubled disk-drive maker
MiniScribe Corp. was accepted by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Denver.
   Maxtor's bid totaled $46 million, consisting of $21.5
million in cash, $20 million in stock, and $4.5 million in
cash and accounts receivable to be released by MiniScribe's
Hong Kong and Singapore facilities. A Maxtor spokeswoman said
she couldn't elaborate on the breakdown.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MiniScribe, based in Longmont, Colo., has been operating
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since the
beginning of the year. In January, the company said it would
sell its assets to the highest bidder so that new investors
could start with a clean slate and creditors could divide the
proceeds.</p>
<p>Wearnes Technology of Singapore also bid for MiniScribe's
assets.</p>
<p>MiniScribe, which last year said its previous management
had improperly manipulated its financial results, sought
protection from creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code
after it was unable to settle a number of shareholder and
bondholder lawsuits against it.</p>
<p>The Maxtor spokeswoman said the company won't be acquiring
any of MiniScribe's debts, or any liability for lawsuits.
Maxtor is a maker of data-storage products.</p>
