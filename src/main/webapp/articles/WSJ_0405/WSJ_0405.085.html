	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Campeau Corp.'s troubled U.S. retail units
projected that first-quarter sales will be down 3% and
second-quarter sales will be roughly equal to those of the
same quarter last year.
   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp.
announced cash flow and sales projections for the first and
second quarters of 1990 at a meeting of creditors of the two
Campeau units. Campeau's first quarter runs from February
through April. Comparisons between 1990 and 1989 figures
didn't include sales from new stores.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cash flow in the first quarter was projected to be $29
million for Federated and $14 million for Allied.</p>
<p>Company officials said that the flat sales projections for
the second quarter provide evidence that Federated and Allied
are recovering from their Chapter 11 federal-bankrputcy court
filing on Jan. 15. The companies predicted cash flow in the
second quarter will be $24 million for Federated and $6
million for Allied.</p>
<p>At the meeting yesterday, James Zimmerman, president of
Federated and Allied, told creditors that since January the
companies had instituted cost-cutting measures at the
corporate and divisional levels that would save $50 million
annually. The savings were in payroll and nonpayroll cuts, he
said.</p>
<p>About 250 creditors and lawyers attended the informational
meeting, which is mandated by the U.S. bankruptcy code. Allen
I. Questrom, chairman and chief executive officer of
Federated and Allied, told creditors that the company had
succeeded in retaining and motivating personnel and stocking
its stores with merchandise.</p>
<p>"We have substantially stabilized our organizations and
our work force, and in almost all areas of our business we
have managed to restore normalcy to our ongoing operations,"
Mr. Questrom said.</p>
<p>Creditors were invited to ask executives questions but few
did so. One lawyer who attended said that creditors didn't
yet have enough financial information to ask questions. The
companies aren't required to file detailed schedules of
assets and liabilities until June 1.</p>
