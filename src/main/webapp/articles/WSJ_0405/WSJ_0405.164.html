	<p class="article-leader">Eastern Airlines said it asked for bankruptcy court
permission to break its pilots union contract in an attempt
to reduce its costs.
   The financially ailing Texas Air Corp. unit, suffering
heavy losses, estimated that abrogating the contract would
save it more than $50 million a year. If Eastern can break
the contract, it can unilaterally cut pilot pay and change
work rules.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The carrier has lately been struggling with its unsecured
creditors over a repayment proposal the creditors consider
inadequate, and has said it planned new steps to slash costs,
including seeking termination of its pilot union agreement,
as well as reducing operations and selling more planes.</p>
<p>This is the second time Eastern has filed for permission
to break the contract. It first did so last June, but
withdrew the request within a month. If this attempt is
successful, it would mirror a move made seven years ago by
Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo, who put Texas Air's
Continental Airlines unit into Chapter 11 to abrogate its
contracts. Continental emerged from bankruptcy court a
low-cost, low-fare airline.</p>
<p>Eastern's pact with the Air Line Pilots Association
expired in July 1988, and it has been negotiating with the
union for more than two years for a new contract. Under
airline labor law, terms of the old contract stay in effect
until a new one is signed or federal mediators declare the
two sides at an impasse.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the pilots union said Eastern filed its
request after the National Mediation Board, which oversees
airline labor contracts, recessed indefinitely talks between
the pilots and the airline.</p>
