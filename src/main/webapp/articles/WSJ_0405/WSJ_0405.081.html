	<p class="article-leader">Yields on money-market mutual funds remained relatively
flat in the latest week, but assets posted the largest drop
since early January.
   The average seven-day compound yield slipped to 7.97% from
7.98% in the week ended Tuesday, according to IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the
current yield continues for a year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Assets of the 426 taxable funds tracked by Donoghue's fell
by $1.5 billion to $383.6 billion. The previous decline in
assets was less than $900 million in mid-March. Assets
dropped by $3.6 billion in early January, although that was
attributed to seasonal factors.</p>
<p>The latest week's drop was across the board, said Brenda
Malizia Negus, editor of the newsletter, affecting general
purpose funds, broker-dealer funds and funds open only to
institutions. But Ms. Negus called the decline "not
statistically significant," noting that it was well under 1%
of total assets.</p>
<p>Although the deadline for paying income taxes is less than
two weeks away, Ms. Negus said it's a bit early for that to
be a significant factor in money-fund assets. The latest
totals reflect checks written a week ago or more.</p>
<p>Assets rose steadily last spring as yields reached their
recent highs. There was a falloff of about $435 million at
the end of April, which analysts then attributed to an
attractive stock market. Total money-fund assets have
increased about $80 billion since then.</p>
<p>The latest money-fund yields reflect generally unchanged
interest rates. Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction, for
instance, yielded just two-hundredths of a percentage point
less than the week before. Yields on bank certificates of
deposit also were little changed in the latest week.</p>
<p>Average maturity of the funds' investments, which include
short-term Treasury securities, CDs and commercial paper
(short-term corporate IOUs), remained at 45 days. Maturities
are thought to indicate which way portfolio managers think
rates are headed; longer maturities permit them to lock in
relatively high yields when rates are falling just as short
maturities allow them to capture rising rates sooner.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slid to 7.67% from 7.69%. The average 30-day simple yield
edged up to 7.67% from 7.66% and the average 30-day compound
yield rose to 7.97% from 7.95%.</p>
<p>Yields on tax-free funds rose. The average seven-day
compound yield of the 220 tax-exempt funds tracked by
Donoghue's rose to 5.57% from 5.49%. That's equal to 7.74%
for an investor in the 28% tax bracket and 8.31% in the 33%
bracket.</p>
<p>Assets of the tax-free funds fell by just under $100
million to $77.3 billion, while average maturity remained at
46 days.</p>
