	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- With a wardrobe that includes three leather
coats, a Gucci gold-link necklace and two pairs of Gucci gym
shoes, 15-year-old Melchishaua Person is considered the
best-dressed student at Henry Ford High School. Her mother,
who owns a costume-jewelry store, has spent $5,000 for her
daughter's clothes as a reward for her B average.
   Melchishaua is dismayed by the prospect of a dress code at
school that would ban such trendy clothing. But all too
literally, she may be dressed fit to kill. The desire to
"bust fresh" -- to dress at the height of teen-age fashion --
has become dangerous at many of the nation's inner-city
public schools. Yet many students, confident that if
something violent happens it will happen to somebody else,
resist dress codes as a blow to their culture and their
freedom to express themselves in fashion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Students have been beaten, shot and robbed of their
leather and goose-down coats, thick gold chains, designer
shoes and other prized items. A high-school student in New
York was killed for his bomber jacket. Another, in Detroit,
was found dead with his coat and shoes missing. More than 10
students have been wounded in Detroit in other clothing
robberies near schools since last September.</p>
<p>Alarmed officials of Detroit's schools plan to prohibit
high-priced clothing and jewelry next fall. Similar codes
have already been imposed, or will be, at schools in
Baltimore, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and New Haven,
Conn.</p>
<p>The prohibitions enrage many students, though not all.
Teen-agers here have organized the Student Committee Against
Dress Codes and held a protest march at Detroit's school
administration building. "Anything can happen to you at any
time," says Tamika Johnson, a 17-year-old senior at Henry
Ford. "The bottom line is that if my parents buy the clothes
I have to be able to wear them."</p>
<p>Dress codes as a deterrent to crime bother some adults.
Mary Louise Starks, who is in charge of psychological
services for the Detroit school system, says they fail to
address the roots of teen-age violence. "A dress code is a
temporary measure that is limited in scope," she says.
"Students are committing these crimes because they don't have
a sense of power and self-esteem. They steal from their peers
to gain control over another person."</p>
<p>Such motivations, she believes, are unlikely to disappear
when a dress code is imposed. She also observes: "Our entire
society has become extremely materialistic. Greed is
reflected from the highest public office to the streets."</p>
<p>Baltimore imposed its code last year after an outbreak of
fights over leather coats and gold chains. The code bans
jewelry, leather and fur coats, and designer jogging suits.
Violators are sent home with a letter to their parents. And
students are now required to carry see-through book bags to
make it harder for them to conceal weapons at school.</p>
<p>"Violence isn't as bad as it was," says Jonathan Johns,
17, a senior at Baltimore's Dunbar High School. "There's no
way to prove it's all due to the dress code, but I feel it's
had a big impact." School officials say there were only 15
assaults and robberies or attempted robberies in 1989, when
the code was established, down from 23 in 1988, and the
number of incidents involving guns fell to 35 from 55.</p>
<p>Tilton Elementary School in Chicago adopted a voluntary
uniform of navy blue and white last year after 12 students
were robbed walking to or from school. About half the
school's 850 students wear the uniform. It may become
mandatory next September. "The code shows that you come to
school to learn and not to play, and it saves your parents'
money," says fifth-grader LaDonna Wright, 10, who attends
class in a white blouse and blue jumper. "And people won't
get killed or beat up for their clothes."</p>
<p>Nor will they at Mumford High School in Detroit, so far
the city's only public high school with a dress code. The
code was imposed in 1986 after beatings and shootings of
students for their Marc Buchanan brand leather coats and
jackets, Guess brand blue jackets and Adidas Top 10 gym
shoes.</p>
<p>Today, the code prohibits those items as well as designer
eyeglasses, gold jewelry, designer purses, leather briefcases
and about 30 other items. A clause permitting officials to
add to the list was recently invoked afer several Detroit
youngsters were shot and robbed of Triple F.A.T. Goose down
coats. The brightly colored coats, often with fur trim, cost
as much as $250 each.</p>
<p>Violators of the Mumford code may be slapped with five
day's suspension and a permanent blemish on their records.
"The code has worked marvelously well," says Mumford
Principal Robert Oden. "Most kids don't think about the code
anymore. It's become a way of life."</p>
<p>Students do think about it, however. "They have no right
to tell us what to wear," says 16-year-old Windy Watson, a
Mumford sophomore. "The school's job is to teach us, not tell
us how to dress." She says many students violate the code
regularly without being caught; she herself is carrying a
$154 Coach purse.</p>
<p>Some students at inner-city schools get money to buy
expensive gear from drug dealing. But most others, or their
parents, earn it from hard work.</p>
<p>Nicole Williams, a 17-year-old senior at Detroit's Cass
Technical High School, often works as many as 35 hours a week
at a McDonald's restaurant to pay for clothes and jewelry.
She owns and wears to school a $202 pair of Guccis, a $68
pair of Used brand blue jeans and a $100 rhinestone-studded
blue-jean jacket. "If they ban expensive clothes," she
gripes, "a lot of students won't have anything to wear."</p>
<p>At Osborn High School in Detroit, 14-year-old Eric
Harrington, a freshman, says he saves his allowance to pay
for his clothing and jewelry. A Fila emblem adorns his $50
turtleneck sweater. "I like expensive clothes like Fila and
Gucci," he says. "If I buy something I should be allowed to
wear it."</p>
<p>Teen-age tastes change rapidly and differ from place to
place. Bomber jackets (and gold-capped teeth) are hot in New
York but not in Detroit. Chicago students prize athletic
jackets with basketball and football team logotypes. Students
in Los Angeles take special care in choosing colors: The
wrong ones might invite attack by an unfriendly gang.</p>
<p>However varied the expression, the motivations for
"busting fresh" seem universal. "First impressions are
crucial," says Melchishaua Person, the well-dressed
sophomore. "I feel better about myself when I look good.
Everybody wants to look good." Robbed at Osborn High of his
$130 goose-down coat, a 15-year-old student said he wore
expensive clothes because otherwise he "probably wouldn't get
a girlfriend."</p>
<p>Still, some students accept the codes as needed. "The
reason the administration has made these rules is for our
safety," says Christina Royal, 17, a junior at Crenshaw High
School in Los Angeles, which has banned bandannas, baseball
caps and other items associated with gangs. "I don't feel
violated. It's for our own safety."</p>
<p>Marc Chambers, an 18-year-old senior at Pershing High
School in Detroit, favors a code. Last year, he was robbed of
his $500 full-length leather coat at gunpoint as he walked
home from school. "A boy walked up to me and told me to take
off the coat or he would bust a cap on {shoot} me," Marc
says.</p>
<p>Miss Person's mother, Antreina Stone, is happy to give her
daughter expensive clothing, but also says the code may be
needed. "I'm in favor of a code if it will protect young
people," she says. "Students can always wear their clothes on
weekends and after school."</p>
<p>Says Frank Hayden, the Detroit school board member who
proposed the dress code: "I prefer that young people not be
allowed to wear what they want to my having to visit them in
the hospital or attend another funeral."</p>
