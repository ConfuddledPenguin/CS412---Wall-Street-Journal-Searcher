	<p class="article-leader">In his Feb. 23 op-ed article on Peru, David Gallagher
refers to a class of leaders (such as Poland's Lech Walesa or
Argentina's Carlos Menem) "with the right instincts but
little knowledge of economics."
   I agree that Mr. Menem is not an economics expert, but
neither are most U.S. heads of state in recent history, yet
the U.S. is performing well by international standards. It is
usually the case that political leaders are not very
knowledgeable themselves, but they have a team of experts who
are. Some highly qualified economists, such as Ambassador and
Oxford Professor Guido di Tella, Harvard-trained Foreign
Affairs Minister Domingo Cavallo and Berkeley's Alieto
Guadagni, are currently working for the Argentine government.
This was also true of the Alfonsin administration (also
criticized by Mr. Gallagher): It included very capable
Harvard, Chicago and Minnesota economists, yet the result was
dismal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Gallagher seems to hold a simplistic view in which
countries do poorly due to the incompetence of their leaders.
He even goes into suggesting a rich menu of policies, such as
elimination of monopolies, liberation of labor markets,
reform of the tax system, etc. Today every person of average
intelligence in Argentina would agree in principle with those
measures. Why, then, are they not taken immediately?</p>
<p>To answer that let me briefly review different levels of
economic analysis as applied to the problem. The most
superficial is macroeconomics, or monetary theory, which
ascribes inflation to mismanagement of the money supply. Mr.
Gallagher seems to be at what I will call the second level,
which goes beyond the monetary veil and observes many
microeconomic inefficiencies and proposes several measures
such as those mentioned. My opinion is that the second level
still fails to understand the political and sociological
nature of the problem. It is by applying political-science
tools like Game Theory that one can understand why such
"basic" measures are not taken.</p>
<p>Argentina is a complex society, with enough strong
pressure groups to make a coordinated action (the only way
out in my view) very difficult. Still, power is not dispersed
enough to make it a competitive society. That is why
coordination is necessary. The past decades have seen those
sectors fighting a distributive battle, channeled through a
paternalistic state, from which they asked more than their
share, generating a gap that was financed by inflation.
Economists have been asking for measures such as those on Mr.
Gallagher's list for a long time. Only now they are starting
to understand the Prisoner's Dilemma nature of the problem:
Everyone could be better off in the long run if the right
measures are taken, but we are afraid that our short-run
sacrifice would be futile, given that the others will "cheat"
to improve their position.</p>
<p>I consider that, even if Mr. Menem's chances of success
are slim, the odds would be even worse were the government
headed by someone better trained in economics, but with less
political leverage. Mr. Menem has the advantage of having
more control over those powerful interest groups than his
predecessor. The Peronist Party traditionally has smoother
relations with trade unions, the military and some
industrialists. The "right turn" taken by Mr. Menem is not
only due to the recognition that market-oriented policies are
necessary, but also to the fact that they can buy the support
of some historical enemies such as agro-exporters.</p>
<p>For a long time economists believed that it was
politicians' fault not to understand economics well enough.
Now we are starting to realize that it is the other way
around.</p>

<p>I was surprised that Mr. Gallagher's otherwise excellent
article on Latin America's most remarkable politician (Mario
Vargas Llosa, now the leading candidate for the presidency of
Peru) contained no mention of the man who almost
single-handedly converted Peruvians to capitalism: Hernando
de Soto. In his masterpiece "El Sendaro Otro" ("The Other
Path"), he showed how the small free market, operating with
no legal protection, provided the vast majority of Peru's
production. He also showed how the current Peruvian
government works to frustrate any attempt to work within the
law. If Mr. Vargas Llosa succeeds in turning Peru capitalist,
he will doubtless have many to thank, but the greatest thanks
of all should go to Hernando de Soto.</p>
