	<p class="article-leader">A simple blood test for cancer failed to live up to its
early promise, cancer researchers said.
   When it was first described in 1986, the blood test raised
hopes that a method had been found for screening seemingly
healthy people for signs of hidden cancers. It also was hoped
that the test might be used to monitor patients who had been
treated for cancer to see if the malignancy had returned.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The test involved taking a small blood sample and
subjecting it to a procedure called nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy. In this procedure an intense magnetic
field causes the protons in the hydrogen atoms of water to
give off a detectable signal. Initial tests indicated the
technique could distinguish between blood samples from cancer
patients and blood samples from healthy persons.</p>
<p>This week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine,
however, carries two reports declaring the test produced
erroneous results in too many cases to be useful. One report,
from a team of scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital
and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that in 52%
of cases the test wrongly indicated healthy persons had
cancer and that it failed to identify 56% of patients with
cancer. The second report from Norwegian researchers
described similar results.</p>
<p>The blood test isn't to be confused with magnetic
resonance imaging, which gives an image of internal anatomy
more detailed than X-rays. It is used to detect malignant
tumors.</p>
