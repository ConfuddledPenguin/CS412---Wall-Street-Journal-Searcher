	<p class="article-leader">Circle K Corp. won some breathing room in its fight to
stave off bankruptcy proceedings and remain a viable
convenience-store chain.
   In an announcement late last night, the company said it
signed a preliminary accord with senior creditors and its
largest shareholder for a seven-month moratorium on debt and
interest payments, narrowly averting default on part of its
debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The accord is subject to a definitive agreement. Circle K,
an operator of convenience stores throughout the Southwest,
had said it was considering filing for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>Circle K Chairman Karl Eller, the energetic entrepreneur
under whose leadership the Phoenix, Ariz., company mushroomed
from a midsize regional concern to one of the largest
convenience-store operators in the nation, wasn't mentioned
in the three-page news release announcing the agreement.
However, outside directors have said that he wasn't part of
the negotiating team seeking to restructure much of the
company's more than $1 billion in long-term debt.</p>
<p>"Mr. Eller is still with the company and there hasn't been
any discussion of Mr. Eller leaving the company," a spokesman
said. He declined to comment on terms of the agreement.</p>
<p>The agreement is among the company's banks, a steering
committee for holders of its $200 million in senior secured
notes, and American Financial Corp., the company's largest
shareholder with a 38% stake and a substantial creditor.
American Financial is controlled by Cincinnati financier Carl
Lindner, a longtime business associate of Mr. Eller's.</p>
<p>The provisional pact is conditional on all sides signing a
definitive standstill agreement that would hold through the
earlier of Oct. 31 or completion of financial rearrangements.</p>
<p>During the waiting period, the banks, noteholders, and
American Financial would defer all principal and interest
payments and would waive any existing defaults under current
loan agreements.</p>
<p>The prospective accord appears to hand considerable power
to the banks, which would exercise a veto right on all
interest payments on Circle K's $510 million of subordinated
debt.</p>
<p>The standstill agreement would require that by the end of
October Circle K acquire at least 90% of its subordinated
debt. It wasn't clear what action might be taken by holders
of these securities, which include 7.25% convertible
subordinated debentures due 2006; 8.25% converitible
subordinated debentures due 2005, 12.75% senior subordinated
debentures due 1997; and 13% junior subordinated debentures
due 1997. Certain private indebtedness is also included in
this class.</p>
<p>Circle K stock closed yesterday at $1.25 a share, down
12.5 cents, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.</p>
<p>The company said terms of its offer to subordinated
holders hasn't been determined. It hinted at an exchange of
stock for subordinated debt and said a registration statement
is expected to be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission before May 15.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Circle K said it believes it has sufficient
funds to meet trade obligations during the standstill period.</p>
<p>It said parties to the agreement plan to execute new
long-term financial arrangements.</p>
<p>As part of the pact, Circle K said it has agreed in
principle to sell Circle K's New England Petroleum
Distributor operations for $26 million to Charter Co., a
51%-owned subsidiary of American Financial. The transaction
is tentatively scheduled to close April 12, subject to
certain conditions.</p>
<p>The company said it is being advised by Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets on financial arrangements.</p>
<p>Circle K, from a relatively sleepy chain of 1,300 stores
in 1983, exploded under Mr. Eller's management to 4,700
outlets at the end of last year. Growth came through a steady
diet of high-yield debt.</p>
<p>Mr. Eller's preoccupation with expansion, however,
apparently wasn't matched by an ability to mind the stores,
and a host of problems arose in recent years. Mr. Eller's
hopes apparently were unhampered, and he put the company on
the block last year, betting Circle K would fetch a fancy
price. It didn't, and losses soon cropped up.</p>
<p>The company late last month reported a $28.1 million loss
for the third quarter ended Jan. 31 on revenue of $872.5
million.</p>
<p>At that time, Circle K said it was in technical violation
of convenants on bank debt, adding that the non-compliance
was waived for a period ending this Friday, when a $60
million portion of the about $340 million in bank debt
matures.</p>
