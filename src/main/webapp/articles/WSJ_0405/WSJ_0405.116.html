	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- In a survey that underscores the real estate
crisis in Texas, the Finance Commission of Texas found that
banks, thrifts and the federal government control $43.55
billion of Texas real estate that has been repossessed or
will be shortly.
   "It's a frightening number," said commission Chairman R.
Dary Stone, president of Delphinance Development Corp. of
Dallas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>About 45% of the property covered by the survey is raw
land, a circumstance that doesn't bode well for Resolution
Trust Corp. or Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as they
attempt to market the repossessed assets of thrifts and
banks.</p>
<p>"There's just not a market for land," Mr. Stone said.
"That's why the FDIC's and RTC's job is so difficult. They're
going to be here for a long time."</p>
<p>And the size of the problem could be as much as 50%
larger, Mr. Stone suggested, because the survey -- released
yesterday -- didn't include nonperforming loans or real
estate controlled by out-of-state thrifts and banks.</p>
<p>Land accounted for about $19.43 billion of the real estate
covered by the survey. Retail, office and industrial
properties, whose market is recovering in some parts of
Texas, accounted for about $11.47 billion of the portfolio.
Multifamily developments, including apartment complexes,
which are selling well in most parts of Texas, made up about
$7.47 billion of the total.</p>
<p>The survey covers real estate and nonperforming loans held
by thrifts, banks and the government as of June 30, 1989. Mr.
Stone said he doesn't expect that the $43.55 billion value
will have changed much in intervening months.</p>
