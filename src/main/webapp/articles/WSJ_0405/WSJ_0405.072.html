	<p class="article-leader">Watching "In the Spirit" is a little like spending a
couple of hours with a dotty old aunt with a so-so memory and
a good sense of humor. Much of the time you don't know what
she's saying or why, but it's all quaint and kooky and
occasionally hilarious.
   The picture brings together women who mastered the art of
kookiness in the '60s and '70s, when it mattered -- Elaine
May, Jeannie Berlin and Marlo Thomas. Here they're playing
the sweetly wayward characters they might have played back
then, before movie comedy hardened into its current state of
plot-by-numbers, jokes-by-rote. Ms. May, for example, can
make the words, "I just hate you," seem like the funniest
punchline written.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Don't expect miracles from this almost inexplicably
agreeable little film about a cheery vegetarian occultist and
a formerly wealthy housewife who go on the lam at a New Age
retreat. The Mafia wants them because a middle-aged hooker of
their acquaintance left her address book with them before she
died. The story, concocted by Ms. Berlin and Laurie Jones,
could be sillier, but not much. Yet the players and the loopy
direction by Sandra Seacat, an actress and acting coach,
generate enormous good will just by opening their mouths and
saying the unexpected.</p>
<p>Ms. Thomas, looking like "That Girl" after moving from
therapy to less traditional forms of soul-searching, is Reva
Prosky, New Age vegetarian and health-food store owner. Her
Reva's perkiness has a manic quality; she is simultaneously
obsessed with death and home decorating.</p>
<p>Reva holds New Age seminars in her chintz-dominated
apartment, communicates with the dead, and collects people
she imagines to be troubled souls. One of these is Crystal
(Ms. Berlin), a prostitute so hard around the edges you
expect at any minute she will pull off her wig and reveal
herself to be a female impersonator. Instead, she expands on
her experiences in the form of endless vulgar anecdotes about
her clients.</p>
<p>Reva's other guests are Roger Flan (Peter Falk), a
recently fired business executive, and his frantically
pragmatic wife, Marianne (Ms. May). Mr. Falk wilts from the
heavy doses of kelp and karmic intensity and finally
disappears altogether. Then Crystal drops out, leaving the
screen to Ms. Thomas and Ms. May, who handle even the costume
changes from streetwalker micro-skirts to military camouflage
fatigues (and the plot convolutions that require such
changes).</p>
<p>Oh, Melanie Griffith shows up for five minutes or so, as
yet another prostitute. Though she's now the most famous of
the group, her appearance seems like her initiation into the
kooky club, no more, no less.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover" may be one of
the most gorgeously disgusting movies ever made. This
melodramatic examination of sadism, gluttony and depravity
could hardly be more lavishly or artfully constructed. But
it's difficult to warm to a picture that opens with gangsters
smearing a man with excrement and then making him eat it, and
that ends with their leader nibbling a human corpse that's
been broiled so as to resemble a very large Peking duck.</p>
<p>Director and writer Peter Greenaway has staged his film
like a play set in an ornate restaurant called "Le
Hollandais." This grossly overdone, blood-red establishment
is owned by a scatological criminal named Albert Spica,
played with unrepentant nastiness by Michael Gambon. So on a
nightly basis, Spica arrives for dinner with his entourage of
thugs and his wife (Helen Mirren), whom he has bruised in
mind and spirit.</p>
<p>Only the chef is unafraid of Albert, because Albert needs
him to manage this showplace of refined gluttony. And it is
the chef who helps the wife carry on with her lover back in
the kitchen storerooms. One night they do it under the
pheasants hanging from a line, waiting to be plucked; one
night by the cheese.</p>
<p>There is little story and much art direction in this
visually stunning fable. Mr. Greenaway and cinematographer
Sacha Vierny and set designers Ben Van Os and Jan Roelfs have
created remarkable landscapes that seem lifted out of a
feverish dream. The violence is equally vivid. The film
makers have achieved what they set out to: repulsive excess.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"Impulse," a forgettable thriller directed by Sondra Locke
and starring Theresa Russell, is worth mentioning only
because it is part of what seems to be a trend: the casting
of women cops on the Dirty Harry model. ("Blue Steel" is the
other recent example.) Some progress.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>VIDEO TIP: Cannibalism may understandably never be amusing
to many people. However, other carnivorous consumption can be
the acceptable subject of much pleasure, and no movie
celebrates that pleasure more delightfully than "Babette's
Feast."</p>
