	<p class="article-leader">BUTLER, N.J. -- Mortgage rates dipped last week, according
to a national survey of 2,000 lending institutions.
   Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages declined to an average
10.14% in the week ended Friday, from 10.17% the previous
week. That compares with an average of 10.16% one month ago,
and 10.2% last year, said Paul Havemann, vice president of
HSH Associates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Adjustable-rate mortgages "have fared pretty well too,"
declining to an average 8.19% last week from 8.21% the
previous week, Mr. Havemann said. That is well below the
average 8.37% the previous month and 8.63% a year earlier.</p>
