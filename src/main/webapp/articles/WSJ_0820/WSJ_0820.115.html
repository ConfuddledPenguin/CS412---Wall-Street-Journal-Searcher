	<p class="article-leader">Pioneer Electronic Corp. said strong sales lifted its
consolidated pretax profit 32% in the first quarter ended
June 30.
   Pretax profit rose to 19.884 billion yen from 15.089
billion yen a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net income rose 67% to 9.922 billion ($673 million) yen
from 5.955 billion yen ($404 million). Per-share net rose to
55.25 yen from 35.79 yen.</p>
<p>Sales rose 31% to 141.672 billion yen ($9.6 billion) from
107.859 billion yen ($7.3 billion). Sales of laser and
compact disk players and their related software were
particularly strong, according to Pioneer.</p>
<p>The value of sales abroad was also increased by the
weakness of the yen in the first quarter, compared with a
year earlier, the company said. Pioneer marked 82.044 billion
yen of sales overseas, 58% of the total.</p>
<p>Pioneer didn't release a forecast for full-year results,
but said it expects sales to rise further, aided by
introduction of new products.</p>
