	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Three creditors, including movie director
Nicolas Roeg, filed a petition against Management Co.
Entertainment Group in federal bankruptcy court here seeking
to force the company into liquidation under Chapter 7 of
federal bankruptcy laws.
   The talent management, movie production and distribution
company has been negotiating with G.E. Capital, a unit of
General Electric Co., to restructure about $72.5 million in
debt. The company has had a large debt load since it acquired
Virgin Vision Ltd., a distribution company, from Virgin Group
Ltd. for $83 million in July of last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Roeg and the other two unsecured creditors claim they
are owed a total of $161,666 for their work on "Cold Heaven,"
one of the company's many unreleased movies. The other two
creditors are the executive producer of the movie, Jack
Schwartzman, and the producer, Allan Scott.</p>
<p>Raymond Godfrey, president and chief operating officer,
termed the timing of the filing "unfortunate." He said the
company has been in discussions with a number of potential
investors and still hopes to make an announcement early next
week about a plan for the company's restructuring. He
declined to identify the investors.</p>
<p>If other creditors join in the petition, it seems likely
that the company would be forced to file for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, giving
it time to come up with a restructuring plan. Mr. Godfrey
said the company is considering that among other
alternatives. However, he said, "It's not what we prefer to
do."</p>
<p>The company, which recently released the movie "Without
You I'm Nothing," has 20 days to respond to the petition.
After that time, the court may issue an order for relief and
appoint a trustee to liquidate the company. Other creditors
may also join in the filing. The company owes money to a long
list of vendors in the film industry.</p>
<p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the company reported liabilities of $252 million as of
December 31. That amount included $153 million in notes
payable. The company also listed $20.4 million as due to
producers and $20.9 million in accounts payable. The company
hasn't filed its financial statement for its fiscal year
ended March 31.</p>
<p>The company, which has fired more than 100 employees over
the last year, fired another 15 employees on Friday, Mr.
Godfrey said. It now has a total of about 150 to 170
employees, including a European operation.</p>
<p>The stock, which traded as high as $4.1875 last year,
closed Friday at 68.75 cents bid in over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>The company's other movies include "Getting It Right" and
"The Chocolate War." The company received a producer fee on
"Look Who's Talking," the box office hit released by
Tri-Star. For the fiscal nine months ended December 31, the
company reported a net loss of $14.8 million on revenue of
$85 million.</p>
