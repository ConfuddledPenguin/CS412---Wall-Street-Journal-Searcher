	<p class="article-leader">I met Boris Roshnikoff a few months ago browsing in a
drugstore in Wilmington, Del., where I had gone to buy a
bottle of aspirin. He was standing in front of a shelf filled
with various brands of headache tablets and was writing in a
small notebook.
   "Excuse me, sir," he said after I had made my choice, "but
why did you choose one of the most expensive brands of
aspirin on display here?"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>His question startled me, but his manner was so courteous
and his accent such an intriguing mixture of Oxford English
and Slavic overtones that I answered, explaining that I
always bought the more expensive brand because it contained
an agent to neutralize the aspirin, which can irritate the
stomachs of some people.</p>
<p>"Are you a chemist?" he asked. When I admitted that I was,
he closed his notebook and launched into a series of
questions about the chemical composition of aspirin tablets.
I finally broke in with a question of my own.</p>
<p>"Why are you so interested in aspirin?"</p>
<p>"I am a Russian," he replied, "and I came over here with
one of the advance groups which preceded President
Gorbachev's summit visit. I wanted to look at the aspirin
situation in the U.S. because we seem to have a perpetual
shortage of it in the small town where I live. I found that
there is a plentiful supply of aspirin in Washington, and it
comes in all sorts of packages and under a dozen or two name
brands. So when I got the chance to visit an old friend here
in Wilmington I decided to see how the supply was in a small
town."</p>
<p>It occurred to me that Delaware's largest city is not
exactly a country village, but it also occurred to me that
you probably could find a dozen or so brands of aspirin in
just about every American country village; even a crossroads
filling station is likely to carry three or four brands. So I
said nothing about community size. Instead, I complimented
him on his excellent English and continued our conversation
about aspirin.</p>
<p>"It is always available in Moscow," he said of the elusive
pain killer, "and my neighbors asked me so often during the
past year to bring them some that I finally asked a deputy
minister of supply if there was a national shortage. He said
he had not heard of any and that the same amount had been
produced during each of the past three years, and all of it
had been distributed. But his records did not show where it
had been shipped."</p>
<p>He asked me how many brands of aspirin we had in the U.S.
I told him it might run as high as a hundred or two hundred,
since I knew that most chains and some individual stores sold
their own special brands. He carefully recorded this
information in his notebook, which contained a list of the
brands of aspirin he had discovered.</p>
<p>"Do all these stores and chains manufacture aspirin?" he
asked.</p>
<p>"No," I told him. "There probably are only four or five
producers of aspirin in the country and they sell to the many
others who buy in bulk for compounding and conversion to
tablets or capsules. Sometimes the basic manufacturers do
everything, including putting the tablets into bottles, while
the company which sells to the public provides nothing except
the labels."</p>
<p>"Does the government run controls on all these hundred or
so different brands and see that the supply is adequate for
each brand all over the country?"</p>
<p>I said I was sure the government did nothing to prevent
shortages and that the quality and supply of aspirin were
backed only by the efforts of the many companies out to make
a profit.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Mr. Roshnikoff and I parted company,
and I presume he is back in Russia now. But his questions
made me think, and on reflection I'm sure I was too
conservative in my estimate of how many brands of aspirin are
sold here. There are probably several hundred brands in any
big city alone, since a great many stores carry "generic
aspirin" under their own labels. All told, there may be more
than a thousand brands of aspirin available one place or
another in the U.S. I wish I had told him that.</p>
<p>I wish even more that I had told him that if the
production and distribution of aspirin were turned over to
just one government agency in Washington, D.C., the American
bureaucracy would soon find a way to have every one of the
thousand brands of aspirin in short supply. This is the
economic lesson I hope Mr. Roshnikoff took home with him.</p>
