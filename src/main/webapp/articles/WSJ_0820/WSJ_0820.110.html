	<p class="article-leader">Bonneville Power Administration, a federal agency that
sells power wholesale in the Northwest, and Puget Sound Power
& Light Co., a Bellevue, Wash., utility, said they agreed to
construct various transmission lines north of Seattle at a
joint cost of $21 million.
   A spokeswoman for Bonneville Power, based in Portland,
Ore., said the transmission lines will be in the fast-growing
areas of Whatcom and Skagit counties, and will provide about
850 more megawatts of power and 21 miles of transmission
lines to the two counties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement, Bonneville will rebuild one of its
transmission lines and update equipment at some of its power
substations. Puget Sound Power & Light will build two lines
branching off of the rebuilt Bonneville power line.</p>
<p>The Bonneville spokeswoman said each company will receive
half of the power from the lines, or 425 megawatts each. The
lines are expected to increase both companies' ability to
draw on Canadian power supplies. The agreement requires an
environmental impact report and U.S. Energy Department
approval.</p>
