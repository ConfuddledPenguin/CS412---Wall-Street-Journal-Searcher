	<p class="article-leader">Ridding itself of an unwanted and troublesome shareholder,
the parent of the St. Petersburg Times agreed to buy back the
40% stake owned by a group including Texas billionaire Robert
M. Bass.
   Under terms of a settlement announced Friday, Times
Publishing Co. and the Bass group agreed not to discuss
certain details of the buy-back, including its price. The
Florida newspaper company, however, is believed to have
agreed to pay between $50 million and $75 million for the
stake that the Bass group bought for about $28 million in
August 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Bass group will share 40% of its profits from the
Times Publishing investment with two nieces of the late
Nelson Poynter, who controlled the St. Petersburg Times from
1947 until his death in 1978. The Bass group purchased its
Times Publishing stock from the two nieces, who inherited the
stock from their mother, Mr. Poynter's sister. The nieces had
offered their shares to Times Publishing after their mother's
death in 1987, but Times Publishing offered a price as low as
$2.5 million.</p>
<p>The buy-back ends a dispute between the Bass group and
Times Publishing over the paper's financial structure. The
dispute broke into public view last January when the Bass
group offered to buy the 60% of Times Publishing that it
didn't own for $270 million. Most of that 60% stake is owned
by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a St. Petersburg
educational foundation that the late Mr. Poynter set up to
avoid estate taxes and keep control of the newspaper in the
hands of local journalists.</p>
<p>The Poynter Institute, whose chairman, Andrew Barnes, is
also editor of the St. Petersburg Times and chairman of Times
Publishing, rejected the Bass group offer. The Bass group
also sued Times Publishing and the Poynter Institute, seeking
to force the company to redeem a preferred stock issue on
which it has been paying dividends of more than 1,200% a
year. About 86% of the preferred dividends, amounting to more
than $3.2 million a year, go to the Poynter Institute.</p>
<p>Though the Bass group pledged to continue funding the
Poynter Institute and said it would preserve the newspaper's
integrity and independence, the offer made Mr. Bass the
center of a storm of negative publicity as other journalists
questioned Mr. Bass's motives.</p>
<p>Under the settlement, Times Publishing agreed to buy back
immediately from the Bass group an undisclosed amount of
stock, believed to be more than half the group's 40% stake.
Times Publishing has an option to buy, and the Bass group has
an option to sell, the rest of the Bass group's stake at the
same price three years from now. Mr. Barnes, who previously
said he viewed Mr. Bass as an unwelcome shareholder, is
virtually certain to cause Times Publishing to exercise its
option to buy the remaining shares from the Bass group. The
Bass group agreed to give Mr. Barnes the right to vote its
shares in the interim.</p>
<p>Times Publishing agreed to redeem its preferred stock and
to "substantially increase" the dividends it pays on its
common stock over the next five years. The preferred shares
held by the Poynter Institute will be exchanged for a
long-term subordinated debenture that will pay annual
interest approximately equal to the amount of the preferred
dividends the institute currently receives. The principal
amount and interest rate of the debenture weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>The Bass group agreed to drop its lawsuit and both sides
agreed to contribute $300,000 each to endow a professorship
in media ethics and press policy at the University of South
Florida in St. Petersburg. The gifts will be matched by
$420,000 from the state of Florida and the professorship will
be named after the late Eleanor Poynter Jamison, whose
daughters sold their stock to the Bass group.</p>
<p>In a statement, David Bonderman, Mr. Bass's chief aide,
said, "We always believed this to be a good investment and
are happy we could work with Andy Barnes to help end a family
dispute that has brewed for years." Mrs. Jamison frequently
disagreed with Mr. Poynter's management of the newspaper, and
once sued him.</p>
<p>Mr. Barnes said in a statement, "The agreement assures the
long-term independence, journalistic control and competitive
vigor of the St. Petersburg Times, as well as significant
ongoing financial support for the Poynter Institute. While
Times Publishing is incurring some debt, it will in no way
interfere with our operations, our staffing, our affiliates
or our growth."</p>
