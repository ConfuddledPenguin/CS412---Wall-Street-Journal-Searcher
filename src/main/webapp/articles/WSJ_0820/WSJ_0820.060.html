	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department sued Charles Keating,
the chairman of the former parent of the defunct Lincoln
Savings & Loan Association, to force him to provide an
accounting of his finances.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on
behalf of the Office of Thrift Supervision, is designed to
enforce an order issued by the office against Mr. Keating and
officers and directors of the failed S&L. The suit seeks to
require Mr. Keating to refrain from transferring any assets
out of the country and to give the office 48 hours notice
before making any transaction involving assets greater than
$5,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Justice Department said it filed the suit after
discussions between Mr. Keating and the government failed to
produce an agreement on Mr. Keating's compliance with the
order.</p>
