	<p class="article-leader">Magazines are gearing up to ask advertisers for hefty 1991
rate increases -- yet they are doing so not only as ad
budgets remain anemic, but also as their circulations are
sliding at a surprising clip.
   Advertising and magazine industry executives say most
magazines will be asking for 4% to 8% ad rate increases for
next year when their new rate cards come out over the next
few months. At the same time, though, a number of major
magazines are losing circulation, new figures from the Audit
Bureau of Circulations show. The glaring disparity between
higher rates and fewer eyeballs has some advertisers seeing
red and insisting that magazines' rate cards are becoming
more meaningless than ever.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"You can ask for anything. It doesn't mean advertisers
will pay those kinds of rate increases," says Rich Hamilton,
a senior vice president at D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles in
New York. "In the environment we work in now, so much of the
ad space that is sold is negotiated that a magazine's
published rate increase has relatively little meaning."</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton and other ad executives believe that for
plenty of magazines, the rate increases are little more than
bargaining chips. For some of the most competitive types of
magazines, such as women's service books, they predict, rate
cards may become obsolete over the next five years, just as
rate cards don't exist in the purely negotiated world of TV
advertising.</p>
<p>"The advertising rate card in magazines eventually is
going to become an anachronism," contends Mr. Hamilton. "It
isn't there yet, but that's the way the business is moving."</p>
<p>For their part, publishers insist the rate increases are
realistic, given big rises in postage and paper costs. What's
more, publishers have been so squeezed by advertisers over
the past few years that they desperately need the gains they
are asking for, contends David Orlow, a consultant with
Periodicals Studies Service in New York, who advises
publishers on rate increases.</p>
<p>"They can't bend anymore or they'll break," he insists.
"Normal consumer magazines will {ask for} cost-of-living
adjustments of 4% to 7%, and I'll bet a nickel that between
3% and 6% of it sticks."</p>
<p>Certainly, both advertisers and magazine publishers are
posturing at this point as they prepare to battle over rates.
But undoubtedly, magazines with slipping circulations are
going to find it rough sledding as they ask for big increases
in light of the recent declines. Their position is even
weaker given the generally abysmal advertising environment,
in which even healthy titles must woo advertisers with price
cuts and other concessions.</p>
<p>For the first six months, according to Audit Bureau
figures, some of the country's biggest names have seen small
but uncomfortable slides. The circulation of the Washington
Post's Newsweek declined 1.9% and Time's was off 3.1%, for
example. Other Time publications also slid, notably People,
off 5.1% from the first six months of 1989, because of drops
in both newsstand and subscription sales. All three magazines
had sizable declines in ad pages, ranging from 7.5% to 9.7%,
for the period.</p>
<p>The Time publications haven't decided on their 1991 rates,
says Donald Elliman, executive vice president of marketing at
Time Warner's Time magazine company. But he adds he doesn't
believe the magazines have any circulation problem, and says
the circulation declines were expected because People
increased its cover price and Time lowered its rate base. "We
set prices to reflect what we honestly believe are market
values," he says. "If we had a circulation problem, we would
have to set prices to reflect that, but I don't think we have
a circulation problem."</p>
<p>Fashion magazines also fared poorly in the circulation
race. Glamour was off 4.8% and Vogue, down 3.3%, with the
same culprit in both cases: sliding newsstand sales that more
than offset increased subscriptions for the magazines owned
by Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications. And women's
service books, the most competitive of all magazine groups,
whose ad pages have been rupturing for the past few years,
must contend with small circulation losses, too. New York
Times' McCall's was down 2.7%, for example. Meredith's Better
Homes & Gardens has already announced a 6.3% rate increase
beginning with its September issue, even though its
circulation was down 0.3% in the first half due to a 9.5%
slide in newsstand sales.</p>
<p>Publishers generally shrug off the declines. They point
out, for example, that both Better Homes and McCall's still
exceed the circulation figures they guaranteed advertisers.
Since Better Homes doesn't get paid when it delivers that
extra circulation, says Jerry Kaplan, publisher, the drop
"demonstrates that our circulation department is doing a
superior job."</p>
<p>But one problem the publishers can't dismiss so easily is
that the steepest declines are coming from deep cuts in
newsstand sales, rather than in subscriptions. Partly, that's
because titles are proliferating, leaving the same number of
buyers with more choices. Retailers are also pushing
magazines off newsstands to make room for more profitable
sundries like razor blades and candy. But the decline also
reflects the uncertain economy -- suggesting that if the
economy goes downhill as many expect, the magazine business
will be in that much worse shape.</p>
<p>Already, magazines that rely heavily on newsstand sales,
such as the women's fashion books, have seen the most
consistent and steepest declines. The more dependent on
newsstand sales, the worse the books have fared: Bride's
magazine's total circulation fell 11.3%, despite a 22.3%
increase in its small subscription base, because of a 14.4%
plunge in newsstand sales. And Reed International's Modern
Bride saw total circulation fall 22.7% mostly because of a
24.1% decline in newsstand sales.</p>
<p>"Money isn't as free as it has been. A woman or man going
to the newsstand is being very judicious because of the cost
factor. If they used to buy two or three magazines, they're
buying one," says Elliot Marion, publisher of Bride's
magazine, a Conde Nast book that had eight consecutive years
of newsstand growth before the latest figure. He adds,
though, that he is optimistic that 1991 will see a
circulation rebound.</p>
<p>Others aren't quite so sure. They note that the Middle
East crisis and the economic uncertainty it is spawning make
for even more caution among magazine buyers -- a volatile
situation whose duration is tough to predict. While Better
Homes itself doesn't rely much on newsstand sales, its
publisher, Mr. Kaplan, says, "I think you really have to be
concerned if you're heavily newsstand-driven. The economy is
certainly unsettled . . . and it's going to continue to
affect newsstand sales."</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>NEW ACCOUNT: The National Basketball Association retained
Goodby, Berlin & Silverstein, San Francisco, to create a
promotional campaign to be aired on NBC. The NBA's $600
million, four-year TV contract with NBC, announced late last
year, gives the basketball group commercial time during
nonsports programming -- mainly prime time. The value of the
air time is estimated at $10 million.</p>
<p>E.P.T. COMMERCIAL: A new TV spot for Warner-Lambert's
e.p.t. pregnancy test depicts the speechless reactions of
fathers-to-be. The ad is part of a campaign created by WPP
Group's J. Walter Thompson, New York.</p>
