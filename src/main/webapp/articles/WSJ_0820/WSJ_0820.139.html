	<p class="article-leader">The Federal Reserve Bank of New York avoided having to
shut down the heart of the U.S. banking system when it
successfully switched its electronics-payments system to an
alternate computer center in Pearl River, N.Y. yesterday.
   The move still caused some slowdown in bank transactions
and government securities trading in New York and some other
parts of the nation. And one official was aghast to learn
that a large fish market in the city was given priority over
the central bank in restoration of service by the utility.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Fed said that it would continue to use its Pearl River
facilities today and hoped to have its payments systems
functioning back in New York City on Monday. Meanwhile, some
big New York banks were still scrambling to cope with the
major power blackout that hit lower New York on Monday.</p>
<p>The Fed's move came after two of three backup emergency
generators at its lower Manhattan headquarters failed just
before daybreak. That meant that Fedwire -- the Federal
Reserve's electronic-payments systems that is the effective
lifeline of the U.S. financial system -- couldn't operate.</p>
<p>Fedwire, the Federal Reserve's funds and securities
transfer service connects Federal Reserve banks and branches,
U.S. government agencies -- including the Treasury Department
-- and about 8,000 depository institutions. It is the main
electronic-payments system in the U.S. On average, $900
billion clears through Fedwire at the New York Fed daily.
Yesterday, all transactions were settled successfully.</p>
<p>Normally, Fedwire is scheduled to begin operating at 8:30
a.m. But the move to Pearl River meant that the securities
portion of the system didn't kick in until 11 a.m, followed
by the funds-transfer network 15 minutes later.</p>
<p>While test runs have been carried out at the Pearl River
facility, the Fed has never had to use the Rockland County
center in a real emergency.</p>
<p>E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, said at
a news conference that if the backup facility hadn't worked,
the Fed might have had to declare a bank holiday as an
"extreme absolute last resort." Such a move could have meant
that the New York banks and their major customers wouldn't
have been able to make or receive payments from other banks
or their customers.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. government securities market would
effectively have been shut down because of the central role
New York financial institutions play in that market.
Moreover, New York banks play a key role in the movement of
funds around the world. That's because of the dollar's
central position as the world's major reserve and transaction
currency.</p>
<p>Bankers said that the switch to the Pearl River computer
center was delayed by the need to re-establish links between
that facility and all the banks that are linked to the Fed's
systems. These involve the use of passwords and encoded
instructions used to protect confidentiality and security.</p>
<p>"The world's payment mechanism and the world's financial
institutions are so interlocked so that you can't skip a
day," said John F. Lee, president of the New York Clearing
House Association that runs the CHIPS, or Clearing House
Interbank Payments System.</p>
<p>CHIPS is a computerized network, owned by 11 New York
banks, that is used for transferring international dollar
payments. On a normal day, just under $1 trillion is cleared
through the system.</p>
<p>James P. Robinson, an executive vice president at Los
Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp., called the problems at
the New York Fed "a substantial inconvenience" but said the
bank had been able to get all its transactions cleared and
hasn't slowed its transaction flow. However, "the process is
painfully slow," he said.</p>
<p>At the same time, officials at several Midwest banks --
First Chicago Corp., Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis and Hawkeye
Bancorp in Des Moines, Iowa -- reported no major
difficulties.</p>
<p>Mr. Corrigan of the New York Fed said that banks were told
of the system's problems and were asked "not to bunch up"
their transactions in the late afternoon when traffic can be
very heavy.</p>
<p>Contingency planning for the payments system has been a
priority of Mr. Corrigan's since he became president of the
New York Fed in January 1985. The Pearl River facility was
established in 1987. One senior banker said that before that,
"a sequence of events like {Thursday's} would have closed
down the New York component of Fedwire," which accounts for
90% of the system.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee of the Clearing House said: "The work they {the
Fed} put into Blue Hill {the name of the Pearl River
facility} paid off" yesterday.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee called Consolidated Edison Co. of New York, which
supplies electrical power to New York City, "the villain in
this whole thing." Complaining that the utility was able to
restore power to New York City's main fish market before it
could the central bank, he added: "What the hell is the
Fulton Fish Market compared to the Fed? The New York Fed
handles the vital core of the financial community
world-wide."</p>
<p>Dan Walden, director of public information at Con Edison,
said that the utility was aware that the Fed had working
backup power systems in place before the blackout occurred on
Monday. And because Con Edison was forced to allocate the
limited standby generating capacity it had, he said: "We
focused on installations that were obvious," such as Beekman
Hospital and a large housing complex with many elderly
residents. At the time, he said: "The Fed's {systems} were
working fine."</p>
<p>Fulton Fish Market, Mr. Walden said, "has an obvious
economic importance to New York."</p>
<p>The Fed wasn't the only institution in New York having
power problems. Because of generator failures at Citcorp and
a few other banks on Wednesday night, the CHIPS system
settled at 10:30 p.m., four and a half hours late. That, in
turn, caused Fedwire to close at 11:45 p.m., instead of 7
p.m. or 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Last night, J.P. Morgan & Co.'s emergency power supplies
failed at 5 p.m. Coming after most financial markets had
closed, the blackout didn't create as big a problem as it
might have an hour earlier.</p>
<p>Someone familiar with the situation said that Morgan's
computers failed with only a "couple of million in receipts
{left to go through Fedwire} and they handled that manually."
He said that today the bank planned to use its backup
facilities in Delaware.</p>
<p>Mary Cirillo, head of cash management for Citibank, said
some corporate customers have begun having their accounts
processed through Citicorp's Wilmington, Del., facilities or
through other banks that aren't being affected by the power
outage.</p>
<p>She said delays in processing accounts Wednesday were
mostly the result of efforts to implement Citicorp's
contingency plans. "It caused some minor delays and in some
cases major delays, but the work got out and that's the most
important thing," she said.</p>
<p>She said that Citicorp established its links with the
Fed's Pearl River facility early yesterday and didn't expect
any delays in processing as a result of the Fed's move. She
said that since Monday's outage, Citicorp has been processing
through both the New York Fed and the Philadelphia Fed.</p>
<p>International Business Machines Co. said it has seen a
steady flow of clients based in lower Manhattan moving
through its Business Recovery unit in Franklin Lakes, N.J.
John Nevola, head of the unit, said a commodities-trading
firm, a bank and an insurance company took personnel and data
to the IBM facility where they restored computer operations.</p>
<p>The bank and the commodities-trading firm have since
returned to their headquarters where Con Edison power had
been restored, but the insurance company continues to operate
out of the Franklin Lakes facility.</p>
