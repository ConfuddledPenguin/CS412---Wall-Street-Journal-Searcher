	<p class="article-leader">When Robert Jenvey was transferred to New York, he already
had worked for seven years as a chartered accountant in
England. But under U.S. regulations, he wasn't qualified to
practice accountancy.
   "It's ridiculous. I cannot sign an audit opinion or become
a partner in my firm," complains an angry Mr. Jenvey, who
works for Coopers & Lybrand. "I found it hard even to get
permission to take the certified public accountant exam."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Jenvey's difficulties are part of a trans-Atlantic
dispute over recognition of professional qualifications.
While the U.S. government says it wants to liberalize trade
in services, including the mutual recognition of professional
qualifications, Europeans complain that the U.S. market is
much more closed than their own.</p>
<p>"The U.S. is being hypocritical," argues John Hegarty,
secretary general of the Federation des Experts Comptables
Europeens, a Brussels-based group representing European
accountants. "If it wants to continue beating up on Japan and
Europe about trade liberalization, it should first make sure
that it is not committing sins."</p>
<p>By itself, the quarrel over accountants' qualifications
may seem minor, concerning only an estimated 3,000 Europeans
living in the U.S. But it illustrates the difficulties in
liberalizing trade in services -- the fastest-growing part of
world commerce. Such liberalization represents one of the
major goals in current negotiations under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The talks, now at a
critical stage, are scheduled to be completed by December.</p>
<p>"The accountants issue is a standard problem for the
services negotiations," says David Woods, GATT spokesman.
"Everyone has high expectations that agreements will achieve
miracles overnight. The reality is that regulatory controls
will remain with us for a long time."</p>
<p>When the current GATT round opened in 1986, it was the
U.S. that pushed hardest to expand trade liberalization to
services. The U.S. figured it was efficient in services, and
wanted to guarantee the right to establish a service business
in a foreign country.</p>
<p>Until that time, GATT had focused only on bringing down
tariffs on manufactured goods. The Europeans initially were
more reticent about opening trade in services.</p>
<p>But, spurred by the program to create a unified European
Community market by the end of 1992, they now have taken the
lead, while Washington, under pressure from strong
civil-aviation and maritime-transport lobbies, has
backtracked and called for the exclusion of entire sectors
from any new GATT agreement.</p>
<p>"Overall, the U.S. has been a prime mover for
liberalization in services," Mr. Woods says. "But as soon as
you get down to the details, things become less clear."</p>
<p>Take accountants. The EC Commission has issued under the
1992 program a directive giving accountants from any EC
country the right to practice in another EC nation. A British
chartered accountant who moves to West Germany still must
demonstrate knowledge of West German law and accounting
practices by taking a test, but he cannot be denied the right
to take the test. This move represents a significant
breakthrough, because, compared with some other professions,
accounting standards don't differ much from country to
country.</p>
<p>"It's not like lawyers, who face fundamental differences
of jurisdiction," says Andrew Coloqhum, secretary-general of
the London-based Association of Chartered Accountants. "For
accountants, veterinarians, architects and other professions,
the major corpus of knowledge translates across borders and
qualifications of equal standards should be accepted."</p>
<p>But in the U.S., six states or territories -- from North
Carolina to Guam -- preclude foreigners from taking their CPA
exam. "All we're asking for in the U.S. is a similar right as
we have won in Europe, "Mr. Coloqhum says. "We're not asking
for the U.S. to abandon its CPA requirements, just to make
them accessible."</p>
<p>In private, a U.S. trade official concedes that the
restrictions on foreigners are protectionist and must be
eliminated under any new GATT agreement. But the same
official rejects European complaints about different
requirements among the different states. An accountant
certified in California, for example, has no rights in New
York. And while it is fairly straightforward for a foreigner
to take the CPA exam in California, it is difficult in New
York.</p>
<p>"In many service sectors, the Europeans complain that
state regulations are a barrier, that they have to go through
the same process 50 times," the official says. But, "this is
not itself a barrier because Americans themselves face the
same regulations."</p>
<p>Europeans see the issue differently. They don't like how
certain states -- such as New York -- require CPA applicants
to hold many university credits in liberal-arts subjects
before they are permitted to take the exam. Partly as a
result of such requirements, Mr. Jenvey wound up taking the
California CPA exam even though he lives in New York.</p>
<p>"It's bizarre. You can only suppose that such different
rules are designed to close the market," says Mr. Jenvey, who
chairs the U.S. chapter of the Association of Chartered
Accountants. "I have a university degree in engineering, I've
worked full-time as an accountant, and yet I still had to go
back to school before I could take the CPA exam."</p>
<p>Many U.S. accountants agree. Charlie Heeter of Arthur
Andersen & Co. in Washington has begun working with European
counterparts to develop a single set of guidelines for mutual
recognition of accounting credentials. He says that big
international accounting firms favor a simplified procedure
for recognizing national qualifications.</p>
<p>"Traditionally, the accounting profession in America has
been domestically oriented and the professional societies
haven't considered the issue seriously," Mr. Heeter says.
"Big firms like us want to do all that is possible to make it
easier for accountants to practice in other countries. After
all, we practice around the world."</p>
<p>These soothing words provide little solace for Mr. Jenvey,
who still cannot sign audit opinions in New York. Like many
other European accountants, he says he settled in New York
because it is the "world's financial capital, the most
exciting place in the world to practice accountancy." Now,
after years of difficulties, he is waiting for the results of
the test he took in California. Although he has no immediate
plans to practice accounting there, he thinks the added
credential will make it easier for him to work in the U.S. in
general.</p>
<p>But Mr. Jenvey doesn't expect any breakthrough at GATT to
make it easier for other European accountants to gain
accreditation in the U.S.</p>
<p>"Total reciprocity: That's the ultimate, and we'll never
have it," he says. "People are too protective, they'll never
accept an automatic entry ticket."</p>
