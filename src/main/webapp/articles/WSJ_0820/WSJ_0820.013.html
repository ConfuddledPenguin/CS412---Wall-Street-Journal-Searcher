	<p class="article-leader">DEARBORN, Mich. -- CMS Energy Corp. said the Michigan
Supreme Court has delayed the company from using its
interests in the Midland Cogeneration Venture.
   The utility holding company said interests include $1.2
billion of the cogeneration venture's notes and about $315
million of its equity interests.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Michigan Court of Appeals on Wednesday reaffirmed its
earlier denial to restrict use of these interests. In today's
action, the Michigan Supreme Court said it will consider the
need to review the actions of the Court of Appeals.</p>
