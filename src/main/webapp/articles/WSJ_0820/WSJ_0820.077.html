	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- There hasn't been much doubt in recent days
about what nation is the most powerful. The Iraq crisis shows
that the U.S. is the only true superpower.
   All the talk about Japan or Germany being the new No. 1
has faded quickly -- at least for now. So has the idea that
military power became irrelevant with the collapse of
communism. These thoughts seem naive at a time when a
military force has risen in the Persian Gulf that threatens
the wealth on which Japanese and German clout has been built.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Only the U.S. has the means to move mass military force
around the globe in days and to rally numerous other nations
to the cause. And, for all its economic woes, the U.S. can
back up that military might with an economy far larger than
any rival's.</p>
<p>"This crisis in the Gulf is the answer to the argument
that we've reached the end of history, that peace has broken
out, that military power doesn't matter and the only coin of
influence in the world is economic power," Harold Brown, a
former defense secretary, said. These popular claims are
being shown up as exaggerations.</p>
<p>But no matter how good the crisis has made Americans feel
so far, with President Bush rallying support by making frank
allusions to stopping a new Hitler, it obscures the shift in
the world power game. Military might still counts, but there
is a new emphasis on economic strength, and the U.S. isn't
well prepared to retain that aspect of global leadership.</p>
<p>Indeed, because the Iraq crisis puts such a premium on the
military means for protecting economic security, it could
divert Americans from the painful job of fixing the broken
U.S. economy so it can compete better world-wide. Even if Mr.
Bush succeeds in protecting Saudi Arabia and rolling Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein back out of Kuwait, he will pay
economically, because the venture adds to the burdensome
federal deficit and increases the odds of a recession.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, America's chief economic competitors -- Japan,
the Pacific Rim nations, and Europe -- will enjoy the fruits
of the U.S. effort to secure reasonably priced oil, while
bearing little of the burden of carrying it out.</p>
<p>Japan and Germany may take the unprecedented step of
sending a few minesweepers into the Persian Gulf, their first
foreign military ventures since World War II. And President
Bush has asked them to chip in funds to help poorer countries
cope with the embargo of Iraq. But none of the roles being
discussed for them would cost nearly as much as what the U.S.
will pay.</p>
<p>"The question is what this does to economic relations,"
Mr. Brown said. "Japan and Germany do, in a sense, get a free
ride."</p>
<p>Talk is increasing here about simply charging Tokyo and
Bonn for U.S. military services, but this would make the U.S.
troops little more than guns for hire. "We can't be
mercenaries," Mr. Brown said.</p>
<p>James Schlesinger, a former secretary of defense and of
energy, said: "The crisis shows that sheer, raw military
power is a key dimension of power. No other country has it,
but it's pretty hard for us to charge others for it."</p>
<p>Mr. Brown suggested that indirect payment might do. "We
should try to extract something in return, something that
would give us some economic advantage, like a greater opening
of the Japanese market," he said. But he added, "That isn't
very likely."</p>
<p>For now, President Bush looks terrific. Even Moscow is
moving to join the U.S.-led effort against Iraq. But his real
test may be whether he can cope with economic realities as
well as military ones.</p>
