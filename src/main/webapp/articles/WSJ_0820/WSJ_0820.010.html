	<p class="article-leader">AKRON, Ohio -- B.F. Goodrich Co. said its Geon Vinyl unit
raised its resin and compound prices by two cents a pound,
effective Sept. 1.
   The maker of plastics, specialty chemicals and aerospace
products said the boost resulted from increased crude prices
caused by the Middle East crisis.</p>
