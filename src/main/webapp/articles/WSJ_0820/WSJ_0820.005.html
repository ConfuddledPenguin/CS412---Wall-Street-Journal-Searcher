	<p class="article-leader">CULVER CITY, Calif. -- At the historic Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer
studios, the atmosphere is chaotic. The first wave of
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. employees have started
the move from Burbank to their new headquarters here.
Construction crews mingle with movie crews, and employees
wander around buildings named after Buster Keaton and Judy
Garland to find their new offices.
   By far the most imposing edifice is the art deco Thalberg
Building, where the office once occupied by film pioneer
Louis B. Mayer is getting an expensive face lift for the new
Columbia brass, Chief Executive Peter Guber and his
co-chairman, Jon Peters. Among the vintage Columbia movie
posters lining the walls is one at the entrance to the
Guber-Peters suite: Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in "You'll
Never Get Rich."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Messrs. Guber and Peters, who produced "Batman" and "Rain
Man," are already plenty rich. Now their job is to turn
Columbia into a moneymaker. After paying $3.4 billion and
assuming $1.5 billion in debt to acquire Columbia -- and
shelling out another $200 million for Guber Peters Co. last
year. Sony Corp. faces several years of heavy expenditures
before it can expect a return. It will cost $500 million to
$700 million for the Columbia and Tri-Star Pictures units to
crank out 20 to 30 movies annually. And Sony will have to
spend plenty more on marketing, distribution and television
operations.</p>
<p>Another $50 million to $100 million will go to massive
renovation and new construction at the Culver City studio
over the next two to three years, while annual overhead costs
have been increased to about $50 million from $35 million
because of the heavy influx of new executives and staff.</p>
<p>Sony acknowledges that it expects Columbia to have a
negative cash flow of $250 million to $350 million -- or
about $100 million in operating losses -- for each of the
next two years, and possibly beyond. Annual cash flow of
about $150 million from Columbia's healthy television
operations and its Loews Theaters won't be nearly enough to
offset the investment required, and it will take 18 months to
two years to get a steady flow of new films made and
released.</p>
<p>But Sony dismisses industry speculation that it faces a
bottomless pit of losses and huge unexpected write-offs,
saying that any "accounting adjustments" associated with
Columbia were treated as part of its acquisition costs in the
fiscal year that ended in March. While acknowledging that the
dearth of viable movie projects at Columbia was worse than
expected at the time of purchase, Sony USA President Michael
P. Schulhof says, "There are no major surprises at Columbia."</p>
<p>Indeed, Sony earlier this year reduced its earnings growth
projections to cover the Columbia losses. Net income, which
increased 42% in fiscal 1990 to $685 million, should grow
only 12% in fiscal 1991; Columbia-related costs will shave
$50 million to $80 million off the year's earnings, the
company says. Sony refinanced $2.7 billion in debt from the
Columbia purchase in the Japanese market earlier this year,
resulting in sharply lower interest expense.</p>
<p>With world-wide sales of $23 billion last year and strong
results in its electronics and recorded music businesses, the
Japanese electronic giant can be sanguine for a while. Sony
says it was fully prepared for the financial hit and still
views Columbia as a key strategic purchase to meld its
hardware and software businesses. Moreover, Sony says, it is
confident that Mr. Guber has assembled a top-flight team that
can turn the studio around in a few years.</p>
<p>"Sony's entry into Hollywood is going pretty much as we
expected," Mr. Schulhof says. "It probably is costing a
little more than we thought it would, but new management, led
by Peter Guber, has earned the respect of Sony top
management."</p>
<p>Messrs. Guber and Peters, who declined to be interviewed,
have been spending at a breakneck pace, paying top dollar for
writers and directors, buying scripts at record prices and
generally making a big splash around town. Much of the
attention, though, has been on the seeming excesses of Mr.
Peters, the former hairdresser who is by far the more
flamboyant of the Guber-Peters team. Hollywood has been
buzzing in recent months as Mr. Peters put his ex-wife, a
girlfriend and his son's girlfriend on the Columbia payroll.</p>
<p>Hollywood executives predict it is just a matter of time
before Sony brass in Tokyo clamps down and the company is
expected to scrutinize such arrangements more closely in the
future, but so far officials don't appear to be overly
concerned. Mr. Peters, Sony and Columbia say, is a valuable
asset as the company's "chief creative officer," looking for
potential blockbusters for the company and trying to cement
its relationships with key talent, and his friends all have
legitimate jobs.</p>
<p>Mr. Peters's antics aside, there is plenty of real action
at the company. Star producer and director James Brooks
("Terms of Endearment," "War of the Roses" and television's
"The Simpsons") recently agreed to move his company to
Columbia. Tri-Star also is in informal discussions with
Steven Spielberg about having him direct "Captain Hook," a
new take on the Peter Pan story starring Dustin Hoffman.
"Lethal Weapon" director Dick Donner will direct "Radio
Flyer" for Columbia, Robin Williams is starring in "The
Fisher King" for Tri-Star and Barbra Streisand -- a former
girlfriend of Mr. Peters -- is filming "Prince of Tides" at
Columbia.</p>
<p>To run the Columbia unit, Mr. Guber wooed back a seasoned
executive, Frank Price, who ran Columbia in the early 1980s.
And Mr. Guber recruited Mike Medavoy, longtime head of Orion
Pictures Corp.'s production operations, to run Tri-Star.
Entertainment attorney Alan Levine was made chief operating
officer of the parent company. And Jonathan Dolgen, president
of News Corp.'s Fox Inc., is said to be rejoining Columbia
when his Fox contract expires.</p>
<p>Of the two film production units, Columbia is getting off
to a much slower start. Former President Dawn Steel did leave
three completed projects: "Flatliners," which opened last
week; "Postcards from the Edge," which stars Shirley MacLaine
and Meryl Streep and is due for release next month; and
"Awakenings," starring Robert De Niro and due out at
Christmas. But Ms. Steel left very little in development or
the early production stages that Mr. Price wanted to make.</p>
<p>Never known for churning out a high volume of movies even
in his days as a studio chief at Columbia and later at MCA
Inc.'s Universal Studios, Mr. Price has so far announced only
one movie, "Return to the Blue Lagoon," a sequel to the 1980
film starring Brooke Shields. That was one of about 50
projects Mr. Price had under development at his Frank Price
Co.; under the terms of his agreement to head Columbia, he
will receive a percentage of any of those movies he makes at
Columbia. Mr. Price says he is also starting production on a
contemporary version of "Sea Wolf," based on the Jack London
book, and "Gladiator," a movie about boxing to be directed by
"Karate Kid" director John Avildsen.</p>
<p>Other movies being made under the Columbia banner are
projects brought in initially by Mr. Peters and embraced by
Mr. Price, such as "Radio Flyer" and "Prince of Tides." And
Mr. Price will be able to release movies from several other
companies already associated with Columbia from the previous
regime. For example, Columbia distributes movies made by
Michael Douglas's Stonebridge Productions and Castle Rock
Entertainment, producer of the hit "When Harry Met Sally."
Columbia also has an equity interest in Castle Rock, which is
now making "Misery," based on the Stephen King novel.</p>
<p>Columbia got off to a rough start on the production of
"Radio Flyers," firing first-time director David Mickey Evans
after paying him $1 million for the screenplay. After halting
production, Columbia agreed to pay a hefty $6 million to Mr.
Donner and his wife, Lauren Shuler, to direct and produce the
movie. But Columbia executives say getting a superstar
director like Mr. Donner is a big coup, and they have high
hopes for the movie.</p>
<p>At Tri-Star, meanwhile, Mr. Medavoy was able to shift into
high gear more swiftly, moving ahead with some projects in
development from previous management. For example, Tri-Star
is shooting a sequel to last year's hit "Look Who's Talking"
and "Hudson Hawk," an action movie starring Bruce Willis. Mr.
Medavoy had an existing script, "Another You," rewritten for
Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder; it is about to start
production.</p>
<p>Mr. Medavoy has also signed development and production
agreements with Reginald and Warrington Hudlin, producers of
the comedy "House Party"; Denzel Washington, star of "Glory"
and "Mo' Better Blues"; actor Dennis Quaid and producer
Cathleen Summers; and actor Richard Gere's Gere Productions.
He also inherits a lucrative agreement to distribute movies
for Carolco Pictures Inc., the source of most of Tri-Star's
revenue this year. Tri-Star is expected to make about $20
million from "Total Recall," and is also distributing "Air
America."</p>
<p>Although most of the top executives at Columbia left after
the Sony purchase, a number of key ones stayed on. For
example, Michael Nathanson, who has been a production
executive at Columbia through four management regimes, is Mr.
Price's president of production, and Mr. Medavoy has kept on
most of the Tri-Star executive team. Buffy Shutt and Kathy
Jones, brought in by Ms. Steel to head marketing for
Columbia, now oversee marketing for both Columbia and
Tri-Star. Former distribution chief James Spitz returned to
the company, and Gary Lieberthal remained at the helm of
Columbia's television operations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Guber Peters Co. continues to operate as a
separate unit, signing its own movie and production deals and
hiring executives. Since Mr. Price and Mr. Medavoy have been
guaranteed complete autonomy at Columbia and Tri-Star,
Guber-Peters could serve as a vehicle for Mr. Peters to
produce movies he wants to make without stepping on their
toes. But Sony and Columbia officials dismiss speculation
that Messrs. Guber and Peters are keeping their former
company alive as an insurance policy should things not work
out at Columbia. Eventually, they say, Guber Peters is likely
to be folded into the Columbia studio.</p>
<p>The biggest hassle Columbia faces immediately is the
relocation to the MGM lot. As part of the settlement of a
legal battle with Time Warner Inc. over the Guber-Peters
team, Columbia was forced to trade its half interest in the
Burbank Studios for the MGM lot owned by Warner. It will be
years before the entire company can move, and executives
frequently have to make the 30- to 45-minute shuttle between
the two locations for meetings.</p>
<p>Columbia recently submitted an ambitious 15-year plan to
the Culver City council, which could take months and even
years to review and approve it all. The proposal would add as
many as 19 new buildings on or near the 44-acre lot, some of
which exceed local height limits. But the plan is true to
Columbia's posh new style, featuring vest-pocket parks, a
turn of the century American town square, retail stores and
"appropriately sized and visually interesting plant
material," according to the plan.</p>
