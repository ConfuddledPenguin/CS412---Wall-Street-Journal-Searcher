	<p class="article-leader">Dart Drug Stores Inc. said it will liquidate the company
because it has been unable to develop a plan of
reorganization acceptable to creditors.
   The Landover, Md., discount retailer, which owes about
$130 million, said it plans to close all 65 Fantle's
Drugstores in the Washington area by early November.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dart Drug filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code about a year ago.
The company said it plans to sell its inventory and store
leases as soon as it has authorization from the bankruptcy
court, but declined to estimate proceeds.</p>
<p>The company said it owes about $24 million to its major
secured creditor Mellon Bank Corp. in Pittsburgh. Trustees
for the largest groups of unsecured bondholders are
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Co., with debt of about
$101 million, and Signet Trust Co., with about $29 million.</p>
<p>In April 1989, Dart Drug changed the name of its stores to
Fantle's and tried a new store format in an effort to boost
sales and profits. Sheldon W. Fantle, chairman and chief
executive officer, said strong competition and a sluggish
economy prevented the company from fully implementing its
marketing strategy.</p>
