	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The huge June reduction in the U.S.'s trade
deficit, to the lowest level in seven years, is likely to be
as short-lived as the oil-price drop that helped bring it
about.
   Still, record exports were a major factor in the improved
trade outlook, and one that has more potential for lasting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The trade deficit shrank to $5.07 billion in June, $2.7
billion less than May's $7.77 billion gap, the Commerce
Department reported. Exports grew 4.6% to a record $34.30
billion, while imports fell 2.9% to $39.38 billion.</p>
<p>But the U.S. is unlikely to see another deficit that small
anytime soon. One of the main ingredients in the improvement
was a drop in oil prices, which helped reduce the nation's
petroleum import bill by $631 million. Given the subsequent
spike in oil prices following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
earlier this month, analysts said the trade deficit is
certain to widen again.</p>
<p>"I think it has nowhere to go but up," said John Endean,
an economist for the American Business Conference, an
organization of chief executives of fast-growing midsized
companies. "The June oil prices were low even by
pre-Kuwait-invasion standards."</p>
<p>According to the report, oil prices were averaging $14.64
a barrel in June. On Friday, the day the trade report was
disclosed, oil was trading at around $28 a barrel on the spot
market. Spot prices aren't directly comparable with import
prices, which are usually set by contract, but analysts agree
that oil prices of all sorts are heading up.</p>
<p>But economists were encouraged by progress in other areas
of trade, particularly the continued growth in exports. "The
ongoing rise in exports suggests there will be continuing
support for the U.S. economy from export demand," said
Richard Rippe, chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New
York.</p>
<p>U.S. exports have grown enormously over the past 2 1/2
years, although the pace of increase has slowed in recent
months. But Mr. Rippe and many other analysts said they
expect continued gains in exports, as the economies of many
of the U.S.'s major trading partners are growing at a fairly
healthy pace. That means demand for goods both foreign and
domestic is likely to continue to be strong.</p>
<p>In addition, the dollar has been generally declining in
value against foreign currencies, a favorable development for
exports because it will translate into lower prices for
foreigners buying American goods.</p>
<p>"Outside of oil you should see continued sizable
improvement in the net export position," predicted Lincoln
Anderson, an economist at Bear Stearns & Co. in New York.</p>
<p>American companies' success in selling goods overseas has
been one of the U.S. economy's few sources of strength in
recent months. "Trade is going to be the key as to whether
the economy merely slows down and we have a couple of
quarters slump in GNP (gross national product) or whether
things will get a lot worse," said Mr. Anderson.</p>
<p>While rising oil prices are likely to fatten the nation's
import bill, the weak economy will probably curb imports in
other areas, many analysts believe.</p>
<p>June's rise in exports reflected increased shipments of
U.S. aircraft, other capital goods and food. The drop in
imports included decreases in purchases of foreign-made cars
and industrial supplies.</p>
