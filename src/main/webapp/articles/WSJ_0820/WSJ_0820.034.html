	<p class="article-leader">LEXINGTON, Ky. -- Listen to the dark-suited Dawahare boys,
Appalachia's leading local retailers, as they huddle around
an oval table to discuss store strategy and other hot topics.
   A.F. wants to know how much he should risk on the horse
races. Oscar Dee bemoans his latest gardening injury. Frank
proposes licensing Casper the Friendly Ghost T-shirts. All
bicker about what's for lunch.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On Fifth Avenue, they'd probably draw snickers. But the
Dawahares (pronounced Daw-Hairs) have made a success out of
retailing by not acting like the hotshots; they don't even go
into Chapter 11. For the six Dawahare brothers and their 26
clothing, furniture and discount stores in Appalachia,
long-term planning means finding out if everybody is coming
to work next Monday. Satisfying a range of customers means
pairing $999 fur coats with $29.99 rayon pant-suits.</p>
<p>Yet Wall Street analysts admire the Dawahares' mountain
moxie and their talent for survival in a troubled retail
climate. The Dawahares are "people who live and die by the
business -- and are right there, not in New York or Chicago,"
says Barry Bryant, a retail analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities. "They have a better idea of what locals want."</p>
<p>Fifty-seven-year-old A.F. Dawahare, the youngest brother
and president of privately owned Dawahare's Inc., admits: "I
never thought we'd outlast Federated." That's the
Bloomingdale's parent that fell into the hands of Campeau
Corp. two years ago and has since sought protection from
creditors in Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy act.</p>
<p>Even some of the brothers' brash children, impatiently
awaiting their turn at the helm, wonder how in the world the
business has managed to survive. "When I first started
working here, I asked where's the budget and was told there
wasn't one," says 28-year-old Frank Dawahare, district
manager for three eastern Kentucky stores. But the hardest
part of the job, he says, is taking orders from relatives.
"They ride you up one side and down the other," he says.</p>
<p>The simplest matters ignite sibling rivalry. Joseph
Kawaja, son of a Dawahare sister, says his uncle Hoover gave
him $51 as a graduation present just to outdo uncle A.F.'s
gift by $1. "My brothers are like a bunch of wild horses,"
says A.F.</p>
<p>Mostly they bicker over what to put in their stores and
whom to sell to. "Everybody who walks past the door is a
customer," contends the senior Frank Dawahare. Brother A.F.
disagrees: "Successful stores target a market," he snaps.
"I've been trying to convince you of that for 30 years,
Frank."</p>
<p>The stores' racks reflect the Dawahares' divergent views.
At Dawahare's in Pikeville, Ky., shoppers find everything
from blue jeans to pumps with gold lame bows. The children's
department features black leather miniskirts in toddler sizes
for $39.99. In Lexington, men's polyester suits compete for
rack space with Ralph Lauren Polo displays, where argyle
socks go for $11 a pair.</p>
<p>Yet the eclecticism seems to work in the boom-and-bust
coal fields, where shoppers splurge on big-ticket items when
they're working and go discount when they're laid off.
Besides, how many other major retailers would be likely to
open a store in Whitesburg, Ky., with a population of 1,500?
In some towns, Dawahare's has little competition.</p>
<p>The clan has hung together since 1912, when S.F. and Selma
Dawahare, both immigrants from Damascus, met at a Syrian
singles dance and were married in New York City. They moved
to eastern Kentucky so S.F. could work as a peddler in the
coal fields. The coal business boomed, and S.F. opened his
first Dawahare's store in East Jenkins, Ky. Revenues and
children multiplied.</p>
<p>Fond of their new homeland, S.F. and Selma named several
of their eight sons after U.S. presidents. There were Woodrow
Wilson, Warren G. Harding and Hoover Dawahare. Hoover, born
on Election Day in 1928, almost became Al Smith Dawahare, but
his parents held off naming him until a week after the
election, when the news of Herbert Hoover's victory reached
the Kentucky hollows.</p>
<p>The origin of A.F.'s name, like other family matters, is
in dispute. Nellie Dawahare Kawaja and her brother A.F. say
it's short for Atta Fadallah, after two uncles. But Hoover
snaps: "Damn it, Nellie, it means After Frank. He was born
after his brother Frank." Says another sibling: "No, it means
After FDR." The debate continues for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Despite their penchant for arguing, S.F. always told his
eight sons to stick together. He wanted the company's
ownership divided among them with each inheriting one store,
but there weren't enough stores to go around when he died in
1951. Two sons have died since. His three daughters were told
to find husbands. They got a minority interest in the firm
and have little say in business matters. "If that would
happen today, there's no way we'd put up with it," Nellie
says.</p>
<p>The daughters share equally in the family's real-estate
holdings, which bring an income of about $1 million a year.
The stores are earning a total of $300,000 or so a year on
sales that have recently ranged between $30 million and $40
million. A.F. says profits should improve this year.</p>
<p>Some brothers have run stores while others have tended
departments in the larger Lexington stores. Hoover says the
clothing business took too much time from his real passion,
politics, so he persuaded his brothers to open a
less-demanding furniture chain for him to head.</p>
<p>A former state representative from Letcher County, Hoover
is best remembered for the day he stood on his desk and
screamed so the house speaker would call on him during a
debate on coal taxes. Guards were called to drag him out.</p>
<p>Frank is considered the most eccentric of the bunch. One
of his ideas is to convert Casper the Friendly Ghost or a
likeness of Art Buchwald into T-shirts or other merchandise
for the stores. So far nothing has come of it, but his
brothers humor him: "Who knows, maybe he could've come up
with the Simpsons," says A.F. Frank is credited with the
sharpest flair for fashion; he has stocked $12.50 paisley
ties in the men's department.</p>
<p>A.F., the president, isn't quite sure why he got the job.
"What can I do with these older brothers?" he laments. "The
responsibility was forced on me." One advantage: He has two
degrees from Harvard.</p>
<p>The brothers are uniformly penny-pinching. The executive
suite is the cluttered second floor of a Lexington store.
Some share offices with other employees. There are no
executive bonuses.</p>
<p>Threadbare rugs in the Pikeville store have stains from a
leaky roof. Clothing racks are marked with hand-lettered
signs or plain beige "Sale" or "Clearance" cards. "We really
need to remodel," says Richard Dawahare, Woodrow's son.</p>
<p>A.F. admits he has become a stickler about spending as he
observes the carnage throughout the retail industry. "The
bedrock of our industry has been crushed," he says. He is
pushing for "revolutionary changes," such as sticking to a
budget.</p>
<p>A.F. also is testing a new advertising and promotion
campaign. The slogan: When you look good, you feel good. "Do
you think that's too corny?" he asks.</p>
<p>The company has been approached about selling out, perhaps
going public. All offers have been rebuffed. Some suggest
that the brothers might sell eventually, or that an outsider
could become the next president when A.F. steps down. Younger
kin are anxiously waiting to see a succession plan. "It's a
very emotional issue," says Jimmy Dawahare, A.F.'s son.</p>
<p>Educated at the best schools, some Dawahare offspring are
lawyers, accountants and fashion designers by training. Many
have worked for Macy's and other large retailers before
returning to the family business. Yearning for the chance to
do it their way, they've formed a cousins' committee to plot
strategy.</p>
<p>"Wasn't it Napoleon who said the worst plan executed to
its fullest is better than no plan at all?" Jimmy Dawahare
asks. Cousin Richard replies: "Yeah, but remember, Jimmy,
Napoleon finally got his butt kicked."</p>
