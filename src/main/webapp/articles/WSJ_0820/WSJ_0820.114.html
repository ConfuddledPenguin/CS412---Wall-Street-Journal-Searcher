	<p class="article-leader">Geo. A. Hormel & Co. said its fiscal third quarter net
income dropped 12% because it had to pay high prices for
hogs.
   The Austin, Minn.-based meat processor said profit was
$12.6 million, or 16 cents a share, for the quarter ended
July 28, compared with $14.3 million, or 18 cents a share, a
year earlier. The year-earlier per-share figure is adjusted
to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split paid Jan. 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales rose 16% to $654.7 million from $564.0 million.</p>
<p>Profit margins were hurt by the jump in the price of hogs,
which the company buys to make meat products. Although the
price of pork products jumped by some measures to a record
level in supermarkets earlier this summer, Hormel said it
still wasn't able to immediately pass along all of its
increased costs to customers.</p>
<p>The price of fattened hogs was high earlier this year
because of unusually small herds. Hormel said that the supply
of hogs is gradually increasing and that its raw material
costs are moderating.</p>
