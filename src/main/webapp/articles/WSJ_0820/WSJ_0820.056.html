	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- The Soviet government has submitted a bill to
parliament that would allow foreign companies to become sole
owners of new enterprises in the Soviet Union, Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov said.
   It would be the first time in at least 60 years that
foreigners have been allowed to wholly own businesses here.
Under current law, foreign companies must work with Soviet
firms in joint ventures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It is impossible to move toward a market economy while
the country is isolated from the world economy," Mr. Ryzhkov
said today, in remarks carried by the official Tass news
agency. "One can no longer rely on joint ventures alone."</p>
<p>Tass quoted a senior official of the State Foreign
Economic Commission as saying the bill would encourage
foreign investment by granting substantial benefits for joint
ventures in which the share of foreign capital exceeds 30%.</p>
