	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In the months leading up to Saddam Hussein's
invasion of Kuwait, the Iraqi dictator secretly built new
ties with a long list of terrorist operators, U.S.
intelligence agencies say.
   Now he is in a position to deploy those killers and
kidnappers to strike at Americans, Europeans and moderate
Arabs, if he decides to turn to the terrorist option in the
Persian Gulf crisis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S. officials stress that the Central Intelligence Agency
and other U.S. and Allied intelligence operations haven't
detected any specific terrorist moves to retaliate for
President Bush's swift military deployment to the Gulf. And
they are anxious to head off public alarm; portents of
terrorist attacks have been wrong in the past.</p>
<p>But the West's counterterrorism networks have gone into
high gear in the past 10 days, issuing alerts across the
world and even within the U.S. Their worry has increased as
analysts have revisited past intelligence reports with the
advantage of hindsight and concluded that, well before the
invasion, the Iraqi dictator seemed to be methodically
knitting together a network of old and new terrorist allies.
Although for years Saddam Hussein had sat on the terrorism
sidelines, even expelling some groups, now he appears in a
position to get back into the game if he chooses.</p>
<p>By one foreign intelligence estimate, there may be as many
as 1,400 active international terrorists now in Iraq, which
is double the estimate of just a year ago. Any attack they
might stage against Americans could put pressure on President
Bush to order military retaliation, risking wider combat. "We
have conveyed the message to Saddam Hussein that an act of
terror will be viewed as something for which he'll be held
responsible," says a senior administration official.</p>
<p>Nobody in the West knows for sure whether Saddam Hussein
will choose the path of terrorism. He faces political and
logistical problems in using terror tactics, and a growing
American military force on his doorstep. Experts warn that
intelligence in this field is slippery, sometimes
contradictory, and subject to differing interpretations.</p>
<p>However, American, French and Israeli sources familiar
with intelligence on the subject say Saddam Hussein took a
number of key steps earlier this year to build up his
terrorist capabilities. The various spy services don't agree
on all the details, but all are convinced that the terrorist
pattern is real. Among the actions by Saddam Hussein they
cite are these:</p>
<p>-- He began reinstalling the notorious Abu Nidal
Organization in Baghdad this spring. It had been exiled for
years to Libya, where it suffered a debilitating internal
split. By some estimates, there now are hundreds of Abu Nidal
operatives training in and around Baghdad in case they are
ordered to repeat the group's earlier exploits, such as
machine-gunning airports and synagogues. Abu Nidal himself
may now be in Baghdad.</p>
<p>-- He gave haven to his longtime terrorist protege Abu
Abbas, after Mr. Abbas publicly took responsibility for an
aborted attack on an Israeli beach that forced the U.S. to
end talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Mr.
Abbas's Palestine Liberation Front is also responsible for
the 1985 hijacking of the Achille Lauro cruise ship in the
Mediterranean, in which a wheelchair-bound American was shot
and thrown into the sea.</p>
<p>-- He permitted Yasser Arafat and the rest of the PLO
leadership to move key parts of their headquarters to Baghdad
from Tunis. While many PLO leaders play no direct role in
terrorism, Western experts claim that Abu Iyad, an Arafat
deputy who is suspected of directing the killing of a U.S.
diplomat in the Sudan, is in Baghdad, along with elements of
Force 17, a PLO military arm that has engaged in terrorism.</p>
<p>-- He opened contact with Ahmad Jibril, leader of the
group that is believed to have blown up Pan Am flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. According to French
sources, Mr. Jibril was invited to open an office in Baghdad
for his Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, even though his patrons are Iraq's worst Moslem
enemies: Syria and Iran. Mr. Jibril is thought to have
declined, but has changed patrons before.</p>
<p>-- He may have gained a lever over another bloody group
that is an unlikely ally: Lebanon's pro-Iranian Shiite
Hezbollah, or Party of God. By seizing Kuwait, Saddam Hussein
won control over 15 Shiite terrorists in prison there,
including the brother-in-law of one of Hezbollah's most
brutal operatives, Imad Mugniyah. French intelligence sources
say the prisoners are now in Baghdad, and Saddam is offering
to free Mr. Mugniyah's brother-in-law if Hezbollah plays ball
with him. If true, that could be ominous for the six American
hostages the group holds, including two controlled by Mr.
Mugniyah.</p>
<p>-- He is bidding for the backing of some groups with which
he doesn't appear to have made contact, by calling on devout
Moslems to help him stand up to America. U.S. intelligence is
especially worried that Iraq may recruit the Islamic Jihad, a
Lebanon-based Palestinian group that in February shot up an
Israeli tourist bus in Egypt.</p>
<p>In addition to these contacts, two other major terrorist
figures have long lived in Baghdad. One is Abu Ibrahim, the
master Arab terrorist bomb-maker, who devised the hidden
suitcase bomb for destroying airliners and trained others who
built even smaller and cleverer bombs. Mr. Ibrahim is
supposedly retired, his terror group disbanded, but he is a
potential asset for Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Another terrorist based in Iraq is Abu Salim, whose group,
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-Special
Command, claimed responsibility for the 1985 bombing of a
Spanish restaurant frequented by U.S. servicemen.</p>
<p>Lesser groups also call Baghdad home. Iraq sponsors a
marginal group called the Arab Liberation Front, and it has
backed Kurdish terrorists in Turkey and Iranian terrorists in
Iran.</p>
<p>The last time American forces were on the ground in the
Mideast, it was terrorism, not conventional arms, that drove
them off, through the stunning 1983 bombing of the Marine
barracks in Lebanon.</p>
<p>This time, terrorists are again issuing threats. Hussein
Musawi, a leader of Hezbollah, the Lebanese group that killed
the 241 Marines in 1983, has called for "suicide attacks"
against U.S. interests, even though his pro-Iranian group has
also condemned the Kuwait invasion. Abu Abbas, the man behind
the Achille Lauro hijacking, has told his followers to
"strike with your strong arms at all U.S. interests."</p>
<p>And, in addition to the prominent, methodical groups,
experts fear that Saddam Hussein's flaming anti-American
rhetoric could incite quicker, free-lance terrorism by
unknown individuals.</p>
<p>"Saddam Hussein is building up something, obviously," says
a French terrorism expert who writes under the pen name of
Xavier Raufer. "It seems that even in May and June, Saddam
Hussein already had something in mind."</p>
<p>Gary Sick, a former National Security Council specialist
on the Gulf, thinks terrorist actions inspired by Saddam
Hussein are "highly probable." He notes: "This can be
directed not only at us, but also at the Saudis and the
Egyptians and all of those Arab forces who have chosen to
oppose him." In case of terrorism, he says, "Bush will find
it very hard to sit still with all those forces there."</p>
<p>Two days after Mr. Bush announced the U.S. intervention,
the U.S. issued an innocuous-sounding travel warning that was
lost in the tide of crisis coverage. "The Department of State
advises that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait may raise the risk
of terrorist incidents directed against American interests
overseas," it said, adding, "There is, however, no specific
information available at this time concerning such terrorist
operations."</p>
<p>The bland announcement was the public manifestation of an
intense counterterrorism effort. Since U.S. troop deployments
began, American embassies and military bases have been told
to increase security. The FBI has stepped up surveillance in
the U.S., especially where troops and arms concentrate on
their way to the Mideast. The CIA has redoubled its detection
efforts overseas, searching for signs that Iraq-inspired
groups might be activating terror cells to kill Westerners,
incite Israel to enter the fray or destabilize Arab allies of
the U.S.</p>
<p>In Washington, a little-known interagency counterterrorism
group has met frequently, sifting a surge in clandestine
information and tips, most of them of little value. Experts
from the National Security Council staff, the CIA, the FBI,
the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State Department also
confer frequently, and terrorism intelligence is a regular
part of Mr. Bush's crisis briefings.</p>
<p>For most of the 1980s, Iraq wasn't a leading terror
suspect. As part of his effort to win help in the long war
against Iran, Saddam Hussein barred active terrorism out of
Baghdad in the early 1980s. Iraq was removed from the U.S.
list of terrorist states in 1982, and the next year expelled
the Abu Nidal Organization.</p>
<p>Now all terrorist-trackers are focused on Baghdad again.
"We are very, very concerned," says a senior U.S.
counterterrorism official. "In the context of everything
else, it looks very ominous."</p>
<p>Intelligence officials are especially concerned about the
Abu Nidal and Hezbollah groups -- proven masters of the
bloodiest and most calculated sort of terror, with experience
operating far from home.</p>
<p>Abu Nidal's band had been widely reported shattered in
severe infighting that peaked last year in Libya, and Abu
Nidal himself (whose real name is Sabri al-Banna) has been
reported dead or imprisoned in Libya. But U.S. officials now
believe at least a remnant of the group has emerged in
fighting shape in Baghdad. The group had been expert at
concealing cells of killers in Europe, and U.S. intelligence
was particularly alarmed this spring at sudden signs that Abu
Nidal operatives there were stirring, traveling and holding
meetings, after long being dormant.</p>
<p>French and Israeli sources go further: Both say Abu Nidal
himself is now in Baghdad. By some foreign accounts, the
terrorist chief was escorted to the Iraqi capital from Libya
by a brother of Saddam Hussein. They also note signs that
scores of PLO fighters have recently defected to Abu Nidal in
Lebanon.</p>
<p>Hezbollah is doubly dangerous: It is as bloody as Abu
Nidal's band and despises the U.S., plus it holds the six
U.S. hostages in Lebanon. The key to its posture may lie in
Iran's attitude toward Iraq, and especially in the fate of
the 15 Shiite prisoners Kuwait had held. Twelve of those are
Iraqi exiles who have tried to unseat Saddam Hussein, a past
that would normally mark them for death in Iraq. But French
sources contend that all 15 have been taken to Baghdad, where
they could be used as bait to coax new anti-U.S. terrorism
from Hezbollah's Mr. Mugniyah, who holds hostages Terry
Anderson and Thomas Sutherland. U.S. intelligence is striving
to locate the 15 Shiite prisoners.</p>
<p>Hussein Musawi, a Hezbollah leader, has called on
terrorists to help dislodge the U.S. from the Persian Gulf
and said that "releasing the (U.S. hostages) now would be a
reward to the Americans for their invasion of the Gulf." If
Iraq's new peace bid to Iran succeeds, the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah may take an even harder line.</p>
<p>Despite the assets Saddam Hussein seems to have assembled,
he still would face several obstacles that could slow or even
stop him from moving to terrorism. One is that Syria, Iraq's
enemy and rival in the Arab world, opposes his invasion of
Kuwait and has sent troops to help keep him out of Saudi
Arabia. Many of the most radical Palestinian and Shiite
terrorists owe some allegiance to Syria, which has let them
operate from Syria or Lebanon.</p>
<p>Moreover, though Saddam Hussein now portrays himself as a
Moslem seeking to oust foreign infidels, he remains
handicapped by being known as a secular Arab who spent eight
years fighting Iran, the Shiite Moslem theocracy that
inspires some of the most active Shiite terrorists.</p>
<p>An additional obstacle is that most professional terrorist
acts take months to plan.</p>
<p>And, of course, the biggest constraint may be the simple
fact that Saddam Hussein would have to contemplate launching
terrorism with tens of thousands of American troops on his
nation's doorstep -- a far different situation than in
earlier outbreaks of terrorism, when any U.S. forces that
could retaliate were far away.</p>
