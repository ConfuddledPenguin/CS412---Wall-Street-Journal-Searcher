	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is seeking a quick settlement of a
number of trade disputes with Japan, including one sparked by
the failure of a highly competitive U.S. firm to win an
airport construction contract, a senior Commerce Department
official said in an interview.
   Michael Farren, undersecretary of commerce for
international trade, said he is still pressing Tokyo for an
explanation of why AEG Westinghouse Transportation Systems
Inc. lost an award for the new Kansai airport's people-mover
system to a less-experienced Japanese firm. The
Pittsburgh-based company, a joint venture of Westinghouse
Electric Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG of West Germany, is
reputedly the leader in this field, having installed 14 of
the 18 airport people-movers in operation around the world.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Farren said he also is watching how the Kansai airport
management handles an imminent award for the airport's
luggage-handling system. BAE Automated Systems Inc. of
Carrolton, Texas, is one of several firms bidding for that
job.</p>
<p>The people-mover award is valued at only $40 million to
$45 million and the baggage-handling system somewhat less.
But these two awards could be the "litmus test" of how well a
1988 accord to open 14 major Japanese public-works projects
to foreign participation is working, Mr. Farren said.</p>
<p>Japan has to show some give in order to ease congressional
ire. Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee's international trade subcommittee, has
warned that the Westinghouse case "does not bode well for the
future" of the agreement. Sen. Frank Murkowski (R., Alaska),
for his part, vowed to introduce more legislation to deny
Japanese construction firms access to federally funded U.S.
public works if Japan continues its alleged discrimination
against American bidders.</p>
<p>Tokyo insists that U.S. contractors are faring relatively
well under the agreement. "They have already won $100
million, and there is still 80% of the contracts to be
awarded," a Japanese diplomat said. By U.S. estimates, the 14
public-works projects covered by the agreement will create as
much as $17 billion in business over 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>The U.S. will reopen talks next month on both the
construction issue as well as Allied-Signal Inc.'s complaint
that some Japanese manufacturers are acting in concert with a
government agency to prevent the U.S. company from selling
its amorphous metal technology to potential Japanese users.</p>
<p>Mr. Farren said the Allied-Signal case is another that has
to be settled soon. A 150-day period for negotiating a
settlement expires on Sept. 15. Failure to resolve the
dispute will be a cue for Allied-Signal to reactivate its
formal complaint that carries the threat of stiff trade
sanctions against Japan.</p>
<p>A separate accord that obligates Japan to give U.S.
vendors wider access to its semiconductor market has a year
left to run, but Mr. Farren said he is anxious to see faster
results. The U.S. semiconductor industry has been demanding
sanctions against Japan because its Japanese market share is
still far below the promised 20%.</p>
