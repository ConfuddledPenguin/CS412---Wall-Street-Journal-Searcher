	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied
Stores Corp. said they have asked the U.S. bankruptcy court
to extend for five months the period during which the
companies have the exclusive right to file a reorganization
plan.
   The request didn't come as a surprise, as the companies
previously indicated they would probably seek such an
extension.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Federated and Allied, both subsidiaries of Toronto-based
Campeau Corp., said they needed the additional time "because
of the scope and complexity" of their reorganization effort.
The companies also said the extension would allow management
to concentrate on the stores' operations during the key
Christmas retail season.</p>
<p>In bankruptcy cases, the debtor has a right to file its
own reorganization plan before creditors have a chance to
suggest an alternative. But the debtor must file within a
designated period or lose that right.</p>
<p>Federated and Allied are seeking an extension to Feb. 28
from Sept. 12, when the period of exclusivity currently is
due to expire. The companies said a hearing on the request is
scheduled for Sept. 11. They said the action isn't expected
to affect the timing of a presentation to creditors of a
future business plan, which is scheduled for October.</p>
<p>Kurt Barnard, publisher of the Retail Marketing Report,
said the current difficult retailing environment complicates
efforts by the companies to come up with a reorganization
plan that is acceptable to creditors. He said an extension of
the deadline beyond Christmas might give Federated and Allied
a chance to reverse their recent losses and "put an
encouraging face on their prospects."</p>
<p>In their latest reporting period, Federated and Allied
posted a combined loss of $27.2 million for May on revenue of
$129.5 million. Federated Department Stores consists of
Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus, Rich's/Goldsmith's and
Burdines. Allied Stores consists of Jordan Marsh, Maas/Jordan
Marsh (Florida), Stern's and The Bon Marche.</p>
<p>Federated and Allied filed for protection under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on Jan. 15 and were given until
May to file a plan of reorganization on an exclusive basis.
This period was then extended. According to Campeau filings,
the two units have a combined $7.3 billion in debt to be
settled under Chapter 11 proceedings.</p>
