	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The National Science Foundation, in a
controversial decision contrary to its scientific advisers'
recommendation, picked Florida State University over
Massachusetts Institute of Technology as the site for a new
national center for magnet research.
   The decision by the NSF's board stunned officials at MIT,
which for 30 years has been the world's leading center for
magnet research. In a terse statement Friday, outgoing MIT
President Paul E. Gray asked the NSF board to reconsider its
decision. Citing the NSF advisory panel's conclusion that
putting the new center at MIT would be the fastest way to
boost U.S. magnet research, he asserted that placing it at
Florida State "is hardly compatible with the NSF's interest
in the competitive posture of the U.S."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decision paves the way for federal funding of up to
$60 million over the next five years to build the center at
the school in Tallahassee, Fla. The state of Florida has
committed an additional $58 million to the center over five
years, the NSF said.</p>
<p>The new National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is aimed
at ensuring that the U.S. remains the world leader in
research on strong magnets. U.S. policy makers fear that new
magnet centers in France and Japan may soon surpass MIT's
Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory as leaders in the
area. Among other things, high-field magnets are playing
critical roles in studies on new superconductors,
magnetically levitated trains, new imaging devices to peer
inside the body and structures of molecules being developed
as drugs.</p>
<p>The NSF board's decision followed a heated competition
between Florida State and MIT. The Florida school has
proposed to develop the center with Los Alamos National
Laboratory in New Mexico. MIT's proposal represented a
collaboration of six Boston-area schools, including Harvard
University.</p>
<p>In recommending last month that the new center be placed
at MIT, the NSF advisory panel noted MIT's "proven record of
excellent performance" in science and magnet technology. The
panel added that a new magnet center at MIT would be fully
operational "at least two years sooner" than the five or more
years it would require to build the center from scratch at
Florida State.</p>
<p>However, the NSF advisers noted that MIT's magnet center
hasn't been strongly backed by the school's administration
and is supported by "a somewhat limited number of faculty" at
MIT. The committee added that "it was difficult to sense any
real enthusiasm on the part of the administration" at MIT for
the new center. In contrast, the committee stated, the
Florida State group was highly enthusiastic, backed by a
"major commitment" of money from the state government and
willing to assign 24 faculty members to the new center.</p>
<p>"Florida State's commitment to build an academic structure
for the new center made a big difference" in the siting
decision, said NSF Assistant Director David A. Sanchez. "Some
reviewers regarded {the MIT center} as more of a magnet
manufacturer than a national research center."</p>
<p>MIT officials countered that some of the most important
magnet-related discoveries in recent years have been made at
its center. They added that MIT, as a private school, was at
a disadvantage in the contest with Florida State, which used
state government backing to help win over NSF Director Erich
Bloch and other NSF officials.</p>
