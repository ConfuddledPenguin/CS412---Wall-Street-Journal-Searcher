	<p class="article-leader">From Bangkok to Barcelona, consumers are hearing an
advertising slogan familiar to many Americans: "Not just
Visa, Citibank Visa."
   Citicorp, the parent of Citibank, is already the biggest
issuer of bank cards in the U.S., with 22 million accounts
and 29 million cardholders. But in the past two years, it has
set its sights on consumers in 18 other countries. And this
year alone, Citicorp expects that outside the U.S. its Visa,
MasterCard and Diners Club cards will grow 40%, to more than
three million accounts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Citicorp isn't attempting to unseat local banks as the
biggest card issuers in these countries. Instead, it is
picking market niches -- usually upper income groups -- where
its name and ability to provide services give it an edge.</p>
<p>"Our name connotes an upscale image," says Pei-yuan Chia,
head of Citicorp's international consumer business. "In many
countries we have an existing customer base through our
branches. We also have our learning experience in the U.S. to
draw on."</p>
<p>If the card business pans out overseas, Citicorp's future
earnings could get a nice kick. (Its domestic card business
already earns more than $600 million a year.) "At some point,
I can see us with 15 million accounts overseas," says Mr.
Chia. Assuming Citicorp makes a profit of about $25 annually
on each overseas account, as it does now on its U.S.
portfolio, he says that would mean earnings could jump
between $350 million and $400 million a year.</p>
<p>Citicorp isn't alone in recognizing the potential of
expanding overseas. American Express Co. is the card pioneer
abroad, with 10 million cardholders outside the U.S. G.
Richard Thoman, head of American Express's international
businesses, estimates there are 120 million people outside
North America who could qualify for one of the company's
cards.</p>
<p>Last year, the number of overseas American Express green
and gold charge cards and Optima credit cards climbed about
17%. But Mr. Thoman says he's "more comfortable with growth
in the 12% to 15% range." He adds that American Express
issues cards in about 30 countries, and "we're pretty well
through the list of countries that we need to be in."</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan Corp. is the third major U.S. player in
the international card game. With a presence in 10 countries,
Chase has quadrupled its credit card accounts overseas in the
past three years. Though it declines to divulge how many
accounts it has, it is believed to be well behind American
Express and Citicorp.</p>
<p>Competitively, U.S. issuers are in good shape in foreign
countries. As H. Robert Heller, a former Federal Reserve
Board governor and now an executive with Visa International,
says: "Traditionally, banks have relied on the customer to
come to the bank for the service. American banks learned long
ago that they needed to go to the customer."</p>
<p>The push overseas is propelled by economic forces. Some
targeted countries have faster growing economies than the
U.S., and some have emerging middle classes. Mr. Heller
estimates that charge volume on Visa cards in Europe will hit
$250 billion by 1993, surpassing Visa's U.S. charge volume.</p>
<p>Another factor is the increasingly cutthroat competition
in the U.S. The average adult consumer has about six charge
and credit cards, and new issuers, such as American Telephone
& Telegraph Co. and Prudential Insurance Co. of America,
continue to enter the market. As a result, card issuers have
to spend more to get new cardholders. Bankers estimate that
the cost of adding new accounts has risen to more than $100
today from $20 in 1980.</p>
<p>The question remains whether credit cards will be as
profitable in other countries as they are in the U.S. For one
thing, 70% of foreign consumers typically pay off their
balances in full each month. In the U.S. only 30% do,
providing greater interest income for banks.</p>
<p>Another danger is that losses will exceed expectations.
Citicorp's overseas card losses are far below its U.S.
levels, but loss rates usually don't start rising until the
third year and Citicorp isn't even two years into its
international push.</p>
<p>Part of the challenge in issuing cards overseas is
figuring out who should get them, particularly because many
countries don't have centralized credit reporting bureaus. To
fill this void, Citicorp is being creative. In India, where a
telephone is expensive and difficult to get, it uses the
telephone directory to find potential customers. In
Indonesia, it solicits owners of TV satellite dishes.</p>
<p>West Germany poses cultural as well as marketing hurdles.
Historically, Germans have shunned debt and have used their
cards as electronic checkbooks instead of revolving credit.
In fact, the German word for "debt" -- schulden -- also means
"guilt." In addition, German privacy laws make it difficult
to get an individual's credit history for commercial
purposes, and other laws governing promotions prevent
comparative advertising or gifts.</p>
<p>To deal with the cultural issue, Citicorp coined a German
phrase with more positive connotations for consumers. Roughly
translated, the term, Ruckzahl-Wahl, means "credit that
empowers."</p>
<p>Citicorp was able to rely on customers of its thriving
German consumer banking subsidiary, Kundenkreditbank, as one
source of potential cardholders. But to reach beyond KKB
customers, it had to compile a list of desirable consumers by
such means as combing home ownership records for well-to-do
neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Brazil is testing Citicorp's nimbleness in dealing with a
changing economy. Citicorp manages Credicard S.A., the big
MasterCard issuer that Citicorp and two large Brazilian banks
jointly own. In 1989, Credicard dominated the market with a
36% share of Brazilian charge card volume.</p>
<p>Brazil's hyperinflation worked in favor of credit card
issuers because consumers were encouraged to borrow and repay
with inflated cruzados. As a result, the profitability of a
Credicard MasterCard account was only slightly less than that
of a U.S. account.</p>
<p>But President Ferdinando Collor de Mello's anti-inflation
program reined in consumer borrowing. To recoup some of what
they have lost in borrowings, Credicard and other issuers
have raised annual fees. "It's not as profitable as it once
was," Mr. Chia says.</p>
<p>In Singapore, the market already looked saturated by the
time Citicorp considered issuing cards. By law, only
well-to-do people, roughly 200,000 of the nation's 2.7
million residents, can legally be offered a card. Ten other
issuers, including American Express, had already put 680,000
cards in the hands of residents, and some banks had waived
annual fees for two years.</p>
<p>In such a competitive environment, Raymond Lim, Citicorp's
general manager of cards in Singapore, says, the only viable
strategy was to differentiate Citibank credit cards from all
the low-cost alternatives. Citicorp chose to go after the
upper income segment with the highest priced card ($75 for a
gold card), fatter credit lines, round-the-clock customer
service world-wide and a heavy promotion blitz using media
and mail.</p>
<p>The approach seems to be working. Since September 1989,
Citicorp has issued 40,000 cards, representing about 6% of
the market. Jeanine Farhi, head of cards in Southeast Asia,
says, "Singapore has been a terrific surprise."</p>
