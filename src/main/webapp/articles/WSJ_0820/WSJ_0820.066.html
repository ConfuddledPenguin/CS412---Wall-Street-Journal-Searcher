	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Everybody is entitled to a mistake, but it looks
like the chairman of Polly Peck International PLC may have
used up his quota with London's institutional investors.
   In a change of heart that torpedoed his company's stock
price Friday, Asil Nadir, the mercurial chairman and chief
executive of the British food and electronics concern, said
he won't be taking his company private after all. His
decision came five days after he announced that he might make
a bid -- valued by analysts at about #1.3 billion ($2.49
billion) -- for the 74% of the company he doesn't already
own.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company's shares tumbled 78 pence to close at 324
pence.</p>
<p>"Anybody outside {the company} must be a wee bit surprised
about what's going on," said David Rough, a portfolio manager
for Legal & General Assurance PLC.</p>
<p>The official reason for the change of mind was that the
bid idea wasn't popular with many investors, who apparently
"indicated that they wouldn't wish to see Polly Peck become a
private company." Mr. Nadir didn't return telephone calls
seeking elaboration.</p>
<p>But David Fawcus, group financial director, said Mr. Nadir
decided his possible bid wouldn't attract enough shares to
take the company private. Mr. Fawcus denied speculation by
London analysts that Mr. Nadir had simply failed to raise the
financing needed for a bid. "He satisfied the board and its
financial advisers that the money was in place" to bid, Mr.
Fawcus said.</p>
