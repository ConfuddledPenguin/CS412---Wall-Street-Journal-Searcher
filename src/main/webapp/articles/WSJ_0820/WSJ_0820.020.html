	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canada's consumer price index rose a seasonally
adjusted 0.4% in July from June, Statistics Canada, a federal
agency, said.
   The increase was the same rate as that recorded in June.
The July boost was mainly attributed to increases in
transportation and food prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, Statistics Canada reported that Canada's
merchandise trade surplus widened to 1.73 billion Canadian
dollars (US$1.51 billion) in June, partly because of a sharp
drop in imports. In May the surplus totaled C$630 million.</p>
