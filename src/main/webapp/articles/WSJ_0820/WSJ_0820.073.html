	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co. said it is having
trouble meeting demand at the gasoline pump, and the oil
company appears to be preparing its customers for a potential
increase in prices.
   Arco, which froze its gas prices Aug. 8 in the wake of
President Bush's request that oil companies act responsibly
in pricing, said more than 270 of its stations have run out
of regular unleaded gasoline at some pumps during the past
week and a half. On average, Arco has been able to replenish
supplies in about 2 1/2 hours.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We want to hold on as long as we can to comply with the
president's request" on pricing, an Arco spokesman said. Arco
said last week that its freeze will remain in effect, but
that it will review pricing daily.</p>
<p>Arco's regular unleaded gasoline is priced between four
and 12 cents below the competition's, and averages about
$1.16 a gallon in Los Angeles. As a result, sales volume at
the company's 1,700 stations, situated in five Western
states, has jumped about 9% since the price freeze. "As we
see volumes increase, we see more runouts," the spokesman
said. "And our inventories are tight."</p>
<p>Arco gets most of its crude oil from its fields in Alaska
and refines it in Washington state and Southern California.
But the company has purchased gasoline on the spot market --
100,000 barrels so far -- because of the increased demand and
a fire last week at Arco's Carson, Calif., refinery that
temporarily cut gasoline production by about 15,000 barrels a
day. Production at that refinery was expected to be back to
normal today.</p>
