	<p class="article-leader">SANAA, Yemen -- Ali Abdullah Saleh is one of the few Arab
leaders willing to stand up and be counted for Saddam
Hussein.
   "Iraq's security was threatened" by Kuwait's policy on oil
and territory, says the 48-year-old Yemeni president. If Iraq
abandoned negotiations too soon, he says, "Iraq's act was
similar to the action adopted by Western countries. They
moved forces at once to protect their interests. If Iraq is
at fault, Western countries also are at fault," he says. "Why
didn't they, too, wait for dialogue?"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Geographically, this small rugged land at the foot of the
Arabian Peninsula is a long way from the unfolding crisis in
the gulf. But politically, it has become a central player. As
the only Arab state represented on the U.N. Security Council,
Yemen is in the hot seat.</p>
<p>When the council first voted to condemn the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait, the Yemeni delegate didn't vote, saying he was
without instructions. That stand reflected Yemen's intense
dilemma, as a close ally of Iraq and major recipient of
Kuwaiti aid.</p>
<p>Yemen also abstained on the sanctions resolution but went
on to vote against Iraq's annexation of Kuwait and the
holding of foreign captives in Baghdad.</p>
<p>The arrival of U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia tilted Yemen
firmly toward Iraq. Yemenis have longstanding grudges against
the Saudis over a disputed province and over their workers'
low status and poor treatment at the hands of the Saudis.</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh is one of a handful of outsiders who have seen
Saddam Hussein since the onset of the crisis. The Iraqi
leader's mood is, he says, unruffled. "He is the same person
I have known all these years," Mr. Saleh says in an
interview. "He loves and wants peace, he rejects war, but in
some circumstances, war has been imposed on him."</p>
<p>Throwing in his lot with Iraq is uncharacteristic for the
Yemeni president. In his 12-year rule, he has pursued a
policy of strict neutrality, extracting aid from Moscow,
Washington and Beijing, and hewing to the consensus view on
all Arab issues.</p>
<p>Now, President Saleh finds himself at odds with George
Bush, Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and Saudi Arabia's King Fahd. He
proposes that foreign forces withdraw from Saudi Arabia,
Iraqi forces withdraw from Kuwait and be replaced by Arab
peacekeeping troops, and an Arab negotiating team then work
to mediate a solution.</p>
<p>"Some countries have blamed us" for abstaining on the two
key Security Council resolutions, he says "but does the U.S.
want solutions, or only condemnations?" Ideally, he says,
Yemen's Security Council seat should represent the Arab bloc
and even some other Third World nations. "But if there is no
consensus, the point of view will reflect the views of Yemen
only," he adds.</p>
<p>Yemen is opposed to sanctions against Iraq "for mere human
reasons, because children, women and elderly people will
suffer." However, Yemen, which itself imports food and can't
refine all its own oil, won't take part in sanctions-busting.
"We don't have the resources to do so," the president says in
the interview.</p>
<p>He also rules out a military role. Some analysts have
suggested that Yemen might use an Iraqi attack on Saudi
Arabia as an opportunity to attack the Saudis' southern flank
and win back the disputed province of Asir. Rumors of tank
movements in the north have been fueled by tighter travel
restrictions near border areas.</p>
<p>But President Saleh denies any such intentions. "Yemen
isn't part of the conflict," he says. He considers his chief
obligation to push for foreign withdrawal. If the U.S. is so
concerned about the sovereignty of Kuwait's ruling family, he
says, "we should remember Panama, where America took a
president out of office by force and brought him to the U.S.
for trial."</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh doesn't think the deep split in Arab opinion is
irreversible. "I think the Yemen streets and the Arab streets
all are more angry against some Arab leaderships than they
are with the Americans themselves," he says. "Arab people
should stand together and find solutions, they should not
cooperate with imperialists. I think that if foreign forces
withdraw, there is hope for a unified Arab position."</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh says he considers President Bush "a wonderful
friend," wise in domestic administration. But now, he says,
the president may be carried away by "the pride of the U.S.
as a superpower." He says he can't see any justification for
the massive U.S. military deployments.</p>
<p>"If it is just to show the power of the U.S., we are all
familiar with that," he says. "The U.S. used to talk about
individual Palestinians as terrorists, but the U.S. is
terrorizing by fleets, warships, aircraft. It is terrorizing
the whole world."</p>
