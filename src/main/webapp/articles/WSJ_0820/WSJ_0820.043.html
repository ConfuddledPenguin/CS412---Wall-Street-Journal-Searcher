	<h3>Global View: If Markets Are Jittery, Maybe It's Deja Vu</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Markets world-wide -- in securities, precious metals,
currencies and commodities -- reacted to the Persian Gulf
crisis the way markets usually react to crisis, with big
price swings. Traders first sought refuge in the dollar. Then
they had second thoughts and the dollar went limp again,
falling last week through a series of new lows against the
German mark. Tokyo's Nikkei index bounced like a yo-yo,
reflecting Japan's nervousness about its dependence on
Persian Gulf oil and continuing distortions in stock and
property values.
   But anyone who thinks all this was capricious should
perhaps take time to ponder how such price movements come
about. Imagine, if you will, many millions of the most
complex analog computers -- that is, human brains --
operating in all parts of the world. Each compares data
coming in by newspaper, TV, radio, telephone, newswires or
what have you with the analogs in their memory banks,
recollections of similar events. Out of that comparative
analysis comes many millions of decisions -- to buy, sell or
stand pat. They feed back into trading rooms around the globe
through an electronic neural network that is itself global.
The resulting trades set prices, which are in turn fed back
out again -- through this newspaper, the AP-Dow Jones wire
service or other media -- to those same living analog
computers. The process adjusts prices, guiding productive
resources toward uses of the highest value.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In other words, the collective wisdom of the world is
applied instantaneously and with infinite repetition to the
task of placing a value on all the great multitude of items
traded in global markets, whether they be orange juice
futures, U.K. gilts, Swiss francs, or shares in Exxon. What
this vast global computer was telling us late last week,
after many fluctuations, was that crude oil should be about
$12 a barrel higher than its price before Saddam Hussein
seized Kuwait, that gold should be about $45 an ounce more
and the U.S. dollar was not enjoying great favor.</p>
<p>By all three measurements the U.S. dollar was weak. It
would buy less gold, less oil and fewer marks. It is true
that other currencies, including the mark, also would buy
less gold and less oil, but the position of the dollar is of
broader interest. Most international trading is denominated
in dollars. Large entities, such as central banks,
multinational corporations and investment funds around the
world have big dollar accounts or big investments in
dollar-denominated securities.</p>
<p>For that reason, U.S. monetary management in the wake of
the Saddam takeover has an importance to the world that
parallels the importance of how well George Bush and his
administration manage the politics and military strategy
involved in putting Mr. Hussein out of business. That places
a considerable burden on the U.S. political system. If the
world lacks confidence in the ability of the U.S. political
system to deal with economic crises, the historical record of
the 1970s may be the reason.</p>
<p>For anyone with a long memory, the reaction of some
Americans to the UN embargo on Saddam's oil is cause for
jitters. Multinational oil companies -- slathered and
demagogued unmercifully by politicians and cartoonists
throughout the 1970s -- once again are in the spotlight,
accused of profiteering on Persian Gulf uncertainties. Oil
companies like to make profits when they can, but it is
amazing how much more difficult that was for them in the
free-market 1980s than in the heavily regulated 1970s. That
empirical knowledge, however, doesn't impede politicians who
see accusations of profiteering as vote-getters. They are
clearly having thoughts about reregulating, thwarting the
natural workings of the market. Should they do that, disaster
will inevitably follow.</p>
<p>That is exactly what happened at the beginning of the
1970s decade. It all began with a soft dollar, brought about
by the presumed necessity for the U.S. Federal Reserve to
finance Lyndon Johnson's 1960s spending spree. He had
insisted on a costly "war on poverty" while at the same time
financing an expensive shooting war in Vietnam. The
outpouring of dollars crashed the Bretton Woods international
monetary system and embarked the U.S. on an inflationary
course.</p>
<p>Richard Nixon, LBJ's successor, applied the worst possible
remedy, price controls, under prodding by Democrats
controlling the House of Representatives. The groundwork was
thus laid for the "energy crises" of the 1970s. They were in
fact crises self-inflicted by misguided monetary policy and
economic regulation.</p>
<p>With the Fed pumping out dollars and prices held down by
law, U.S. producers, including producers of fuel, were caught
in a squeeze. Inflation was pushing up demand and costs, but
legislated ceilings prevented prices from responding. As a
result, producers curtailed output. Oil and gas wells were
"shut in." The result was the oil price explosion of 1973, on
a scale no cartel could possibly have produced -- even though
OPEC still is blamed for it. A nation consuming one third of
the world's oil had simply pumped up demand and curtailed
production simultaneously.</p>
<p>Incredibly, that explosion convinced Congress that energy
price controls should remain on, not be taken off. They did
remain, with further turmoil, until 1981. In that year, the
combination of price deregulation and a vigorous
anti-inflation policy by the Fed sent oil prices into a
tailspin. That forced oil companies back into competition,
which caused them far more trauma than they had suffered
during the 1970s period of inflation and rigged markets.</p>
<p>So if markets are nervous about the dollar today, there is
good reason. The U.S. polity learned a lot in the 1980s. The
world has changed as well, with nuclear power and high-tech
industry making the production of modern industrial nations
less sensitive to oil price changes. But there still are a
lot of people -- many of them in important roles in
Washington -- who think that price controls were the correct
response to OPEC in the 1970s and who might presumably think
that they are the correct response to Saddam Hussein and
gyrations in the oil market today. Further, the United States
seems to have a Treasury that believes -- against all
evidence available from Japan and Germany -- that a soft
currency is a good thing. Although dollar devaluation has not
cured the U.S. trade deficit after five years, there still is
the touching belief that some day it will. Finally, the U.S.
has an LBJ-style Congress that thinks if the U.S. can't
inflate its way to greater prosperity, surely it can do it
with massive federal spending.</p>
<p>We've been down this track before, but many people have
forgotten the lessons. The reaction of world markets to the
Persian Gulf crisis suggests however that the vast global
computer that runs all markets has those lessons stored
somewhere in its memory banks and is discounting the dollar
accordingly.</p>
