	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Iran has secured an unusually large price
increase from Japanese customers on long-term contracts for
crude oil to be loaded between September and December,
industry sources said.
   The increases, which by previous agreement will apply to
other Asian buyers of Iranian crude, change the value of
Iranian oil so much that other Persian Gulf producers are
expected to raise their prices as well.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The Saudis will have to follow," said one trader, noting
that oil sold by Saudi Arabia and other producers, which like
Iranian oil is priced against Omani or Dubai crudes, will
otherwise seem inexpensive.</p>
<p>Beginning in September, the price of Iranian Heavy, which
makes up the bulk of Japan's crude supplies from Iran, will
cost a monthly average price equivalent to the price of Dubai
Fateh crude plus 25 cents a barrel. That is an increase of
$1.40 a barrel from the price Iran obtained from Japan in
July and August.</p>
<p>Iranian Light crude will cost a monthly average price
equivalent to the price of Omani crude plus 35 cents a
barrel, an increase of 60 cents a barrel over the current
price.</p>
<p>The actual cost of the crude is even greater than the
increases suggest because of jumps in the prices of Omani and
Dubai crudes since the latest Middle East crisis began Aug.
2.</p>
<p>Dubai crude has gained $7.40 a barrel in the past month.
If that price holds in September -- and many say it will go
even higher -- Japan will pay $8.80 a barrel more for Iranian
crude than it did in August.</p>
