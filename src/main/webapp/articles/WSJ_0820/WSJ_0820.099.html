	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks plunged in thin trading, reflecting investor
disappointment about unfruitful talks between President Bush
and Jordan's King Hussein in finding a peaceful solution to
the Middle East crisis.
   Meanwhile, London stocks slumped to their lowest levels
since late April in agitated trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues was down 762.72 points
at 26786.72.</p>
<p>At the end of the morning session in Tokyo Monday, the
Nikkei index was up 134.05 points at 26920.77.</p>
<p>Also discouraged by a plunge on Wall Street overnight,
cash and futures indexes fell widely right after the opening
Friday. Futures indexes continued to slide on short-hedging
the rest of the day, triggering rounds of arbitrage selling
on the spot market, traders said.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section was estimated at 300 million
shares, down from 305.7 million shares Thursday. Decliners
outnumbered advancers 861 to 115, while 105 issues were
unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section dropped 34.06 points, or 1.65%, to 2033.30.</p>
<p>The second section index fell 41.42 points, or 1.01%, to
4072.25. Volume in the section was estimated at 13 million
shares, down from 14.7 million shares Thursday.</p>
<p>The market was disappointed to see that King Hussein
didn't have any message from Iraq's president to Mr. Bush
after all, observers said.</p>
<p>"We were too overjoyed on Wednesday," said a fund manager
at Nippon Life Insurance, referring to a 1440-point surge on
the Nikkei Index that day following rumors that King Hussein
was carrying a message that suggested Iraq may withdraw from
Kuwait.</p>
<p>On Thursday and Friday, the market lost nearly all of
Wednesday's advance.</p>
<p>Institutions bought blue-chip shares such as Nippon Steel,
Sony, Matsushita Electric Industrial, Toshiba and Hitachi on
Wednesday, the fund manager said.</p>
<p>But these shares fell Thursday and Friday, "making it
difficult for institutions to buy again," he said.</p>
<p>Both institutions and dealers raised their cash positions
ahead of the weekend, guarding against a possible worsening
of the Middle East situation, traders said.</p>
<p>Fumihiko Ishii, manager of investment research at Nomura
Securities, said the majority of participants weren't
expecting war to break out in the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>"But uncertainty keeps investors off the trading floor,"
he said.</p>
<p>Yoshio Ogawa, general manager of stock trading at Nikko
Securities, said trading this week will continue to be
nervous with investors alternating from optimism to
pessimism, responding to news from the Middle East.</p>
<p>Steel shares bounced up late Friday afternoon, helped by
buying from investment trust funds, which placed buy orders
at limit prices, traders said.</p>
<p>Nippon Steel gained 10 yen to 529 yen ($3.59), while NKK
added 7 yen to 514 yen.</p>
<p>The rest of the market fell broadly, regardless of sector.</p>
<p>Plant engineering companies were sold as their projects in
Iraq and Kuwait have been frozen because of economic sanction
by Japan against the two nations.</p>
<p>Chiyoda Corp. was down 90 yen to 1640 yen. Toyo
Engineering fell 40 yen to 1440 yen.</p>
<p>Blue chips slumped, with Sony down 200 yen to 7650 yen,
and Toshiba falling 25 yen to 945 yen. Toyota Motor dropped
50 yen to 1950 yen.</p>
<p>Construction and housing shares were among the big losers.</p>
<p>Shimizu fell 60 yen to 1620 yen, while Misawa Homes fell
50 yen to 2200 yen.</p>
<p>In London, market watchers said shares were marked lower
to encourage buyers into the market, but the observers also
noted outright large selling from continental and
international investors who have become shaken over Middle
East developments.</p>
<p>Additionally, traders were squaring positions ahead of the
weekend to protect themselves against any unexpected
developments from the region.</p>
<p>Moreover, a soggy start to Wall Street combined to
pressure the London market.</p>
<p>Only four stocks in the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100
Share Index managed to escape the onslaught, and these were
predictably oil shares. The international sector, undermined
by a surging pound, included some of the day's biggest
losers.</p>
<p>The FT-SE 100 Share Index slumped 45.2 points to 2176.9.
The Financial Times 30 Share Index shed 46 points to 1678.9.
Turnover was 500.5 million issues, up from 375.4 million
shares Thursday.</p>
<p>Among oil shares, Shell Transport & Trading added 7 pence
to 492 pence (13 cents to $9.41), Lasmo rose 12 pence to 467
pence, while Ultramar gained 9 pence to 350 pence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, RTZ fell 19 pence to 510 pence, BOC was down 18
pence to 474 pence, Glaxo Holdings was 30 pence lower at 728
pence, and SmithKline Beecham shed 18 pence to 534 pence.</p>
<p>Building shares were also battered after a report Thursday
by the Bank of England suggested that interest rates would
likely remain high for some time. Redland slipped 18 pence to
536 pence, RMC shed 23 pence to 596 pence, Beazer fell 7
pence to 128 pence, and BPB dropped 8 pence to 188 pence.</p>
<p>Reuters continued its slide. The stock dropped 51 pence to
878 pence after slumping 80 pence Thursday. The stock has
suffered from some downgradings in the U.S. as well as
adverse press comment in the U.K. Three million shares
changed hands.</p>
<p>Polly Peck slumped 78 pence to 324 pence. The company's
chairman, Asil Nadir, said he is abandoning plans to bid for
the whole of the group.</p>
<p>In other markets, shares closed lower in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam, Milan, Madrid and Stockholm.
South African gold stocks closed higher.</p>
<p>Also, stocks ended lower in Hong Kong, Sydney, Manila,
Singapore, Taipei, Seoul and Wellington.</p>

as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
