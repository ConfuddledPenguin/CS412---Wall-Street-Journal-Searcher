	<p class="article-leader">A federal grand jury indicted two former officials of
closely held FJW Industries Inc. on charges that they tried
to defraud the government on a contract to supply equipment
for U.S. Army tanks.
   FJW, based in Elgin, Ill, won a total $1.2 million in
contracts to provide the Army with night-vision periscopes
for its M-60 battle tank, the indictment says. According to
the indictment, the company bought used periscopes from an
Israeli company, then sent them to Singapore, where an FJW
subsidiary disassembled the periscopes; the parts were then
shipped to FJW in Illinois, and assembled into periscopes FJW
sought to pass off as new equipment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The indictment says the defendants -- Barry Warzak, vice
president, operations, and George Bravo, vice president,
finance -- repeatedly provided false documents certifying
that the contract was being properly fulfilled.</p>
<p>FJW wasn't named in the indictment. Messrs. Warzak and
Bravo couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
