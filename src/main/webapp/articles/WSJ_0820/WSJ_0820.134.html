	<p class="article-leader">HARARE, Zimbabwe -- The state airline withdrew three
Boeing Co. 707 airliners from service after cracks were found
in the wing spars, officials said.
   The planes are expected to be grounded for several weeks
for repairs and tests, a spokesman for Air Zimbabwe said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A fourth Boeing 707 was given a clean bill of health and
is flying normal routes, he said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the four planes were checked after
Boeing, Seattle, warned operators of possible wing cracks,
particularly in ageing 707s.</p>
<p>The state airline acquired its 707s second-hand a decade
ago.</p>
<p>Air Zimbabwe also operates two Boeing 737s and one
recently acquired extendedrange 767.</p>
