	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Most analysts continue to think, or hope, that
the economy is only flirting with recession and soon may
start moving upward slightly faster. At the moment, however,
the economy is so close to zero growth that one or more
unfavorable developments in the Mideast oil crisis, domestic
interest rates or somewhere else could push it into slump
territory.
   Once again the current week's statistics, mostly covering
developments in July and even earlier, aren't going to tell
us much about the outlook. One of the few August numbers will
be sales of domestically produced cars for the second 10 days
of the month, and that figure isn't likely to reveal much.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales in August's first 10 days were down 18.8% from a
year earlier, and the result for the latest period is likely
to be about the same. Sales were unusually strong a year ago
as manufacturers increased rebates to move large inventories.
Those inventories are much smaller this year and so,
naturally, are the rebates.</p>
<p>The increased uncertainty touched off when Iraq invaded
neighboring Kuwait early this month has led many economists
to reduce their forecasts for the inflation-adjusted gross
national product. Edward S. Hyman of C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell Inc. looks for the preliminary GNP report for the
second quarter, to be announced Friday, to be revised
downward to zero growth. The advance number, announced a
month ago, was an increase of 1.2% annually.</p>
<p>But Stephen S. Roach of Morgan Stanley & Co., though he
has cut his forecasts, still looks for preliminary GNP growth
of 2% a year. "The economy," he says, "is not likely to fall
into an outright recession at any point in the next year and
a half. We continue to maintain that the economy has enough
forward momentum to avoid recession -- even in the face of an
energy shock."</p>
<p>The 49 economists interviewed monthly by Blue Chip
Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, cut their
average GNP forecasts for both 1990 and 199l, predicting
growth at a rate of 1.3% this year and 1.7% next year. A
month earlier, they predicted gains of 1.9% for 1990 and 2.2%
for 1991. But the averages obscure deeper concerns on the
part of some. R.J. Eggert of Blue Chip notes that in August
there was a sharp rise in the number of analysts who
predicted a quarter or two of negative growth between now and
the end of next year.</p>
<p>Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist of Merrill Lynch,
Pierce Fenner & Smith, was predicting a recession last year
but later changed his mind. At the moment, he doesn't seem
too comfortable with that change. "The U.S. economy is on the
edge of recession and may fall in," he says. "Though we think
that the economy can avoid the plunge, the risk of a downturn
is high and rising."</p>
<p>Among the other numbers due out this week, durable goods
orders for July are expected to show a reasonable gain of
more than 2%. Mr. Hyman of C.J. Lawrence says, "Our model
indicates that July durable goods orders rose 2.5%, largely
due to an estimated 3% increase in auto production," which
fell 2.8% in June.</p>
