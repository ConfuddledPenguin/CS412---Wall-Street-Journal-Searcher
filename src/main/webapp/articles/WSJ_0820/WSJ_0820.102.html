	<p class="article-leader">WEST BERLIN -- Seven people were arrested in connection
with the alleged delivery of a poison-gas plant to Iraq, a
West German prosecutor said.
   Prosecutor Friedrich Hoffmann in Darmstadt said Friday
that among those arrested was a man he identified only as
"al-Kadhi," an Iraqi specialist employed by the West German
foreign intelligence service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Hoffmann said the arrests, which came after several
years of investigation, took so long because evidence was
needed to prove that the plant allegedly delivered to Iraq
was constructed so that it could produce poison gas.</p>
<p>He said among those arrested were employees of Pilot Plant
in Dreieich, a Darmstadt suburb south of Frankfurt; workers
in the export section of Preussag AG in Hanover, and from
Walter Engineering Trading in Hamburg. Company officials
couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoffmann emphasized that the accusations of illegal
shipments to Iraq were directed at individuals and not at the
companies he named.</p>
<p>Separately, the news weekly Der Spiegel reported over the
weekend that the East German National People's Army helped
Iraq gear up for chemical warfare -- by directing
construction of a training ground in Iraq where the weapons
could be tested.</p>
