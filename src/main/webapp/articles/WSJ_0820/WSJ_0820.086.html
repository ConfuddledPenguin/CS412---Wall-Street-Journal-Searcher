	<p class="article-leader">The Energy Department's response to Saddam Hussein last
week amounted to a seasonally adjusted version of Jimmy
Carter in his green cardigan making his famous plea for
conservation. Top item on the department's agenda is for
Americans to inflate automobile tires to their recommended
pressure, with carpooling, vanpooling and tuneups secondary
weapons in the arsenal to reduce oil demand. As silly as all
this sounds, the full measure of the sublime here is that the
words "Alaska" and "Point Arguello" are nowhere to be found
in Energy's program.
   The first principle remains that the idea of domestic
"independence" from foreign oil is as misplaced now as it was
in the 1970s. Last we looked, oil remained a fungible
commodity, so it makes no difference to price where the
supply originates. That said, it makes a lot of sense for
countries that have reserves in the ground to tap them to
make up for the oil from Iraq and Kuwait that has now been
quarantined. The U.S. alone had bought about 600,000 barrels
of oil daily from these two countries. We now import about
half our crude oil, a new record, while domestic output has
fallen to a 30-year low.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As Energy's oddball demand-side suggestions make clear, if
we are going to close the gap between energy supply and
demand, the place to start is with supply. Just as clearly,
this means finding the will to disarm the environmentalists.
As a colleague at Barron's put it last week, the
environmentalists who have been so successful at getting
politicians and judges to block development of American
reserves have unwittingly become "Saddam's secret weapon."</p>
<p>The Interior Department recently finished a five-year
study requested by Congress to identify the "best single
opportunity to increase significantly domestic oil
production." No surprise about the source: Alaska, or more
precisely what is officially known as the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge. This is a vast coastal plain of some 1.5
million acres in the remote northeast part of the state,
about 65 miles east of the North Slope. Interior estimates
recoverable reserves of as many as nine billion barrels,
enough eventually to account for some 20% of domestic
production. Despite cries of despoilation, oil industry
estimates are that exploration and drilling would occur on
just 15,000 acres, about 23 square miles.</p>
<p>The good news is that there are five bills in Congress on
leasing some of this Arctic land for exploration. The bad
news is that two of these bills are environmentalist-backed
bans on development. Worse, none of the bills that would open
the area to serious exploration has gotten anywhere in
Congress despite various committees holding more than 20
hearings.</p>
<p>The so-called compromise bill on exploration in Alaska
reflects the pre-Saddam view that there is a free lunch when
it comes to the environment. This House bill would allow
drilling of only four exploratory wells. A time-consuming
procedure would be set up to see whether any of the rest of
the area could ever be leased. In other words, the standard
operating procedure of delay and litigation to block
development.</p>
<p>Congress is not the only culprit. In June, President Bush
happily announced he was in favor of making 99% of the
California coast "off-limits to oil and gas leasing and
development until after the year 2000." One extremely
promising area off California that had already been leased is
now caught up in a Byzantine permit battle that has let a
local government block development.</p>
<p>Point Arguello is the largest domestic discovery since
Prudhoe Bay, but the members of the Santa Barbara County
Board of Supervisors have so far stymied development. Chevron
has spent $2 billion on the project, which has been ready to
go for two years. The field could produce some 100,000
barrels a day, which would be a fine start toward replacing
all of Saddam's oil. The project is frozen pending a
"supplemental environmental impact statement" due in
November. The Energy Department has offered to mediate the
dispute over whether the oil would be moved to refineries
down the coast by pipeline or by tanker.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that nuclear power has helped some
countries, notably Japan and France, greatly reduce their
reliance on Middle East oil. In the U.S., Shoreham and
Seabrook are hollow testaments to the ability of special
interests to destroy an industry. It's also worth noting that
almost all the oil that could be developed in this country
would be delivered by pipeline, not by tanker a la the Exxon
Valdez. While we're at it, we note that the much-discussed
caribou herd at Prudhoe Bay has grown to 15,000 from 3,000 in
1970.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein may have done this country a big favor by
reminding everyone that banning drilling in "wildlife" areas
and offshore always includes tradeoffs. The cost of
environmentalism is never easy to quantify, but neither is
the risk of the oil weapon in the hands of a dictator.</p>
