	<p class="article-leader">Airbus Industrie said it received firm orders for 51
aircraft in July, bringing total unit sales to date to more
than 1,500.
   The company said the 51 aircraft were ordered by eight
customers, including two new ones.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Airbus is a consortium among Aerospatiale of France;
Messerschmitt-BoelkowBlohm G.m.b.H., a unit of Daimler-Benz
AG of West Germany; British Aerospace PLC; and Construcciones
Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.</p>
<p>As reported earlier, Airbus sales in the first half of
1990 dropped to 118 from 252 in the year-earlier half, caused
in part by a four-month strike at British Aerospace, which
makes wings for the planes.</p>
