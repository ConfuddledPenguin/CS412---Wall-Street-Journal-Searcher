	<p class="article-leader">Businessland Inc. reported a net loss of $21.5 million for
its fiscal fourth quarter ended June 30 and restated results
for its fiscal second and third quarters, increasing the net
losses for those periods.
   Investors drilled the San Jose, Calif., computer dealer's
stock, which tumbled 58% to close at $2.875, down $4, in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. Among other computer
dealers, MicroAge closed at $13.25, down $4, and Intelligent
Electronics at $15.875, down 37.5 cents, both in national
over-the-counter trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Businessland said its fourth-quarter loss was equal to 73
cents a share. Most analysts expected the company to post a
small profit or at worst a loss of five cents a share. In the
year-earlier period, Businessland had a profit of $7.4
million, or 23 cents a share, on sales of $322.6 million.</p>
<p>The collapse of Businessland's stock prompted speculation
that the company now may be a takeover target. The company's
market value, based on about 30 million shares outstanding,
was a mere $86.3 million at the close of yesterday's trading.
At that price, some observers think Businessland, which
reported revenues of $339 million for the fourth quarter and
$1.35 billion for the fiscal year, would make an attractive
acquisition, especially for a healthier computer dealer.</p>
<p>Even if Businessland isn't in play, the company's
weakening condition appears to threaten its independence.
"The question is: Can this company survive as an independent
entity?" asked Charles Wolf, an analyst at First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>David Norman, Businessland's chief executive, is confident
the company can recover. "We believe we have the staying
power to be a major player," he said.</p>
<p>Observers are less sure, saying Businessland is paying
dearly today for some disastrous moves made in recent years.
These include an enervating price war Businessland sparked
last year and a 1988 acquisition of ComputerCraft, a
store-front retailer that's posting losses.</p>
<p>Businessland also is suffering from the after-effects of a
rift with Compaq Computer Corp. In February 1989, Compaq
dropped Businessland as a distributor and although the two
companies made up this March Mr. Norman said he is only now
"making progress in winning back customers that we lost."</p>
<p>"Basically, the company has never recovered from the
Compaq thing," said Benny Lorenzo, an analyst at Volpe Welty
& Co.</p>
<p>Observers are disturbed as well by Businessland's need to
restate results for its second and third quarters. Mr. Norman
said the restatements were the result of "accounting errors,"
but these mistakes doubled the company's third-quarter loss
and their disclosure has weakened confidence in Mr. Norman's
management.</p>
<p>"The company's poor financial results heighten the fact
that Businessland's management and entire culture must change
fairly soon," said Seymour Merrin, a computer retailing
analyst in Palo Alto, Calif.</p>
<p>Mr. Norman insists changes are in the works. For much of
this year he has been streamlining operations while at the
same time expanding overseas. In January, he closed about 90
outlets and cut the work force by about 7%. Then in June, he
dismissed his two highest-ranking sales and marketing
executives, citing poor performance, and has yet to name
successors.</p>
<p>Mr. Norman admits, however, that Businessland, which has
tried to position itself as a sophisticated supplier and
networker of computers, still doesn't receive enough revenue
from services, maintenance and training. The company gets
about 7% of its revenue from such high-margin services, well
below the double-digit percentage Mr. Norman believes will
insure the firm's profitability.</p>
<p>He also concedes he erred in investing so heavily in
selling higher-priced machines such as servers and
workstations, which aren't typically sold by personal
computer dealers. "We got ahead of ourselves," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Norman blamed the poor fourth quarter on losses from
the firm's expanding international operations and its
20-store ComputerCraft retail group. Also contributing to the
loss was a $6 million charge involved in closing 15
facilities, the deferral to future quarters of credits from
some vendors, and increases in inventories of spare parts for
computers serviced by the company.</p>
<p>For the year, Businessland had a net loss of $23.1
million, or 76 cents a share, in contrast to net income of
$32.9 million, $1.04 a share, in its fiscal 1989. Revenue
rose to $1.35 billion from $1.18 billion.</p>
<p>The losses placed Businessland in violation of certain
covenants with lenders, and Mr. Norman said he hadn't yet
learned what the lenders' position is on revising loan
agreements.</p>

<p>BUSINESSLAND Inc. said it closed about 19 outlets in
January. The number was misstated in the Aug. 7 edition.</p>
