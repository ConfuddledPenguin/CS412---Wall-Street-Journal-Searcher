	<p class="article-leader">BETHESDA, Md. -- Many small defense contractors think the
Middle East crisis will bring them more business. But few
have felt the impact as swiftly as Survival Technology Inc.
   A year ago, Survival Technology was headed toward failure.
James H. Miller, the health-care executive recruited to turn
the company around, was sure that a return to profitability
meant cutting back heavily on the company's reliance on
Pentagon contracts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Enter Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Following the Iraqi president's invasion of Kuwait, the
Defense Department last week doubled an earlier $1 million
order for one of Survival Technology's key products, a small
injection kit that soldiers and civilians can use to
temporarily counter the deadly effects of nerve gas.</p>
<p>The Pentagon also asked that the delivery date of the
chemical warfare antidotes be speeded up by two months.
Meanwhile, Survival Technology's telephone has been ringing
"nonstop" from overseas allies asking for product pricing and
delivery information, says Mr. Miller, the company's chief
executive officer.</p>
<p>Though the sudden surge of demand may be short-lived, it
gives the company a boost while it pursues its turnaround
strategy. The situation required some scrambling, but the
company's response shows how fast a small business can react.</p>
<p>The 32-year-old company is the only U.S. producer of
self-injection kits to counter nerve-gas effects. A soldier
exposed to the gas pushes a vial the size of a ball-point pen
against his thigh and a spring-loaded one-inch needle shoots
two milligrams of atropine into his muscle. This is followed
by a larger, spring-loaded dose of Pralidoxime Chloride.</p>
<p>Survival Technology also packages injectable antidotes for
allergies, bee stings, and attacks of heart arrhythmia.</p>
<p>The crisis has brought unexpected excitement to Survival
Technology's modern brick headquarters on a shady side street
in suburban Washington, D.C., and to its manufacturing
facility in St. Louis. Employees have volunteered to work
weekends. The price of the company's stock, traded over the
counter, jumped $5 after the invasion to $15.50 a share
before settling back to what Mr. Miller terms a "more
realistic" $13 level Friday.</p>
<p>The company shifted gears quickly as the crisis developed.
After the unexpected invasion of Kuwait, company officials
called contacts in the Defense Department and in the Persian
Gulf, asking about their inventories of nerve gas antidotes.</p>
<p>"Then we contacted all our vendors to accelerate
deliveries," Mr. Miller says. "We didn't have the order yet
but in my judgment we were going to get it. Then we called
our director of manufacturing in St. Louis and asked him to
run three or four scenarios on how we could produce the
{added} product while maintaining our commercial business."
The whole process took two days.</p>
<p>"In a small business, you don't have any political
issues," he adds. "You call together your team and if they
think it's a good idea, you just do it."</p>
<p>Mr. Miller stresses that the Persian Gulf military buildup
hasn't "saved" Survival Technology, which has had losses in
five of the last six years. The Pentagon order isn't likely
to be repeated soon, since barring a chemical warfare attack,
the injection kits will remain unused in the military supply
system. Each unit has a shelf life of five years.</p>
<p>The Pentagon order "will provide a boost in revenue for
maybe one quarter," says Mr. Miller, acknowledging that the
short-term revenue boost comes from the very sector he
designated for cutback. Survival Technology's long-term
health depends on cost-cutting and lots more civilian
pharmaceutical sales, he insists.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller, 52 years old, was an executive vice president
at Beecham Inc. before being hired a year ago by Survival
Technology's founder, Stanley Sarnoff. Dr. Sarnoff, who died
this summer, was an eminent cardiologist and prolific
inventor. He held 49 patents, including one for the automatic
injector that is the basis of Survival Technology's business.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller says Dr. Sarnoff once told him: "I was so
enthralled with science that I should have paid more
attention to business." Without the restructuring away from
heavy reliance on defense contracts and a purge of top
management, Mr. Miller says the company would have failed.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller says the company, which employs about 400
workers, will probably be in the black in the current quarter
ending Oct. 31, when earnings are normally depressed. In the
corresponding quarter a year earlier, the company posted a
$1.5 million loss. For the nine months ended April 30,
Survival Technology had a $801,000 loss on sales of $12.6
million, compared with a net loss of $1.3 million on sales of
$12.3 million in the year-earlier period.</p>
