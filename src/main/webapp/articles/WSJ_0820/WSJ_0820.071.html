	<p class="article-leader">More Franchises Get
   A Mexican Accent</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MORE U.S. franchisers are expanding south of the border.</p>
<p>Partly in response to a Mexican effort to encourage
franchising, 20 American franchisers so far this year have
registered to open units in Mexico -- matching the entire
1989 total, says Michael Brennan, a franchising attorney in
Chicago. Mr. Brennan and others say the figures suggest
Mexico eventually could rival Europe as a foreign destination
for U.S. firms.</p>
<p>Kwik Kopy Corp., a Houston franchiser of photocopying
centers, recently signed an agreement to open 100 units in
Mexico over the next few years. The first is expected to
start up next month. Philadelphia's West Coast Video Inc., a
franchiser of video-rental stores, is seeking a Mexican
partner to open five units in Mexico City, with one
additional unit to open every six weeks thereafter.</p>
<p>Until this year, Mexican law severely restricted the
control a foreign franchiser could exert over its
franchisees. But in January the government exempted such
businesses from many of the old rules and granted franchisers
an array of new powers.</p>
<p>Mexico's growing middle class and favorable economic
trends and tax structure bode well for franchising in Mexico,
as does a free-trade agreement that the country is expected
to reach with the U.S. by the end of 1991.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Brennan warns, "there are still some
problems." For example, Mexican law prohibits non-compete
clauses in contracts and forbids franchise agreements of any
kind that run for more than 10 years.</p>
<p>Thriving Scams Aim</p>
<p>At Small Companies</p>
<p>INFLATABLE RAFTS have floated into the sea of small
business scams.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney in Los Angeles recently obtained fraud
convictions against two men who allegedly used telephone
boiler rooms to sell overpriced advertising trinkets to
small-business owners after telling each entrepreneur that he
was the winner of a new powerboat. The only "boat" ever sent
was a small, inflatable raft-like vessel that arrived in a
cardboard box, say the prosecutors.</p>
<p>Telephone-marketing tricksters, mostly based in Southern
California, are still thriving despite increased efforts by
authorities, and many of their victims are entrepreneurs,
says Beverly Hills lawyer David A. Katz. He's the former head
of a multiagency government task force aimed at boiler-room
operators. Many scams involve selling nonexistent or
overpriced office supplies, he says, and small businesses are
particularly vulnerable because they often order more
informally.</p>
<p>In Capitol Hill testimony last month, Mr. Katz told how
scamsters often develop a "mooch" -- a company insider bribed
to order thousands of dollars of pens, pads and other items.</p>
<p>In another popular scam against small businesses, the
crook orders merchandise on credit, never pays and disappears
with the goods. Small-business owners should be particularly
wary of new customers who make a few small orders and then
suddenly start making giant ones, experts warn.</p>
<p>Carving Out a Niche</p>
<p>In Employee Training</p>
<p>SMALL BUSINESSES thrive helping corporations with training
and education.</p>
<p>"As technology proliferates into all aspects of the
workplace, corporations are busy retraining workers," says
venture capitalist Yuval Almog of AIA Ventures, Minneapolis.
"Much of that work will be farmed out to small, specialist
firms." Mr. Almog says he has invested in several such
startups.</p>
<p>Authorware Inc., also of Minneapolis, recently received a
multimillion-dollar contract from American Airlines to
develop training tools for a broad spectrum of its employees.
Using Authorware's system, for instance, pilots can evaluate
the impact on takeoff of such variables as runway length,
wind velocity and aircraft weight. Northern Telecom Ltd. is
working with Authorware to develop ways to help employees
understand new technology.</p>
<p>Multimedia technology -- combining text, graphics, video,
sound and animation -- "provides a level of realism and
simulation that traditional training means can't," says John
"Bud" Colligan, chief executive officer of Authorware and a
former Apple Computer executive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, salesmen and clients of database developer
Oracle Corp. are using software of Boston's Relational
Courseware Inc. for training. Big corporations have the
internal capability to provide training and education, but
"smaller companies often can do the same things faster and
cheaper," says John Carson, a former McKinsey & Co.
consultant who launched his own start-up this year to help
corporations provide employees with parenting information.
Educational Publishing, Mr. Carson's start-up, publishes a
newsletter that Polaroid Corp. and Pacer Systems Inc. are
distributing to staff.

<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>ENTREPRENEURS start young, says a survey of 1,000 small
businesses by United Group Information Services. The average
entrepreneur surveyed was about 29 years old when he or she
started a business, and 82% took the plunge before turning
40. . . . Boredom and burnout are the biggest reasons
business owners cite for selling their firms, says David R.
Hoods, division president of Geneva Cos., an Irvine, Calif.,
merger and acquisition services firm. Lack of capital and
absence of a child who wants to take over are the next
biggest reasons, he adds.</p>
