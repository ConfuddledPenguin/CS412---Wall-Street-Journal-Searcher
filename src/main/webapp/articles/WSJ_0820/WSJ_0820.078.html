	<p class="article-leader">SUSEGANA, Italy -- Europe's statesmen are merely trying to
forge a common European market. Heikki Takanen dreams of
something even more elusive: a common European refrigerator.
   Northern Europeans tend to shop once a week in
supermarkets and demand large refrigerators; southern
Europeans, many of whom shop at open-air markets every few
days, generally prefer small ones. Northerners like their
fridges on the top and their freezers on the bottom;
southerners want just the opposite. And the English, who are
big consumers of frozen foods, complicate things further by
insisting on units with 60% freezer space.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"National stereotypes really exist," says Mr. Takanen,
vice president for "cold" products at Sweden's Electrolux AB.
Noting the variety of regional preferences in color and
design, he adds, "Our task is to take this fragmented market
and unify it as much as possible."</p>
<p>In this, Mr. Takanen is at the cutting edge of an idea
transforming European business. A number of market
strategists have argued that with the advent of a unified
European Community after 1992, national markets in Europe
will resemble those of the American states. In many product
categories, they insist, only big, powerful companies will be
able to compete effectively across borders to serve all 325
million consumers and exploit fully the resulting economies
of scale.</p>
<p>The saga of Electrolux's experience with refrigerators
illustrates some of the potential rewards and perils of
efforts toward Pan-Europeanization. It also shows that, at
least for now, the U.S. model doesn't quite apply to Europe.</p>
<p>Over the past six years, Electrolux has attempted to
streamline its operations by concentrating component
purchasing, eliminating production overlaps, pooling research
efforts and centralizing much of its marketing. However, the
company still operates six refrigerator factories in Europe
(it has closed two), sells products under 40 brand names and
produces 120 basic designs with 1,500 variants. In fact, it
has launched new specialty refrigerators to appeal to certain
market niches.</p>
<p>"You'll never have one plant in the middle of Europe
producing for the entire Continent," concedes Mr. Takanen.
"You just can try to standardize a lot and create synergies."</p>
<p>In the U.S., more than 80% of all refrigerators have their
freezers on top, and most come in one standard size. And for
the most part, the units turned out by America's factories
are sold under a handful of national brands. It is a
high-volume, low-margin business that demands ruthless
efficiency to succeed.</p>
<p>Electrolux is indeed big and efficient. It has 135 sales
companies and 43 factories in 15 countries. Its corporate
headquarters are located just outside Stockholm, and it has a
total 152,900 employees. It produces about six million
refrigerators a year -- half of them in North America, half
in Europe. With some 25% of the European refrigerator market,
it holds twice the share of its nearest competitor.</p>
<p>Electrolux's efforts are appreciated even by those most
skeptical about Pan-Europeanization. In a 1987 paper on the
home-appliance industry, J.M. Stopford of the London Business
School argued that it was more profitable for companies to
concentrate on their home markets than to confront different
national tastes and tackle Europe as a whole.</p>
<p>Now, he says, "Electrolux has changed the rules of the
game. When I looked at the industry in 1987, national rules
dominated, and the international players were less
profitable. They had a hard time coping with a changing
market. My reading now is that the one-country position is
too vulnerable and that Electrolux's investments are
beginning to pay off."</p>
<p>Electrolux had little choice but to go Pan-European.
Unlike British, French, German or Italian companies, it found
its Swedish base too small to allow concentratation on a home
market. In the early 1960s, the company came close to
bankruptcy as its absorption refrigerators were unable to
compete with the new compressor models developed by such
competitors as N.V. Philips and Siemens AG.</p>
<p>Electrolux saved itself with a series of acquisitions that
improved its technology and gave it a strong presence
throughout Scandinavia. By the 1980s, it was branching out
across the rest of Europe. But its refrigerators were still
being manufactured in plants with specialized assembly lines
and with local brands, designs and distribution networks.
Leif Johansson, as head of the major-appliance division at
the time, thought much more could be done.</p>
<p>Mr. Johansson, now 38 and an executive vice president for
household appliances, said, "To us, the obvious lesson was
that our products could become more and more international."</p>
<p>His theory was soon tested when the financially troubled
Italian appliance maker Industrie Zanussi S.p.A. asked
Electrolux for help in the form of a small investment in the
company. Mr. Johansson responded with a buy-out proposal,
which was approved by Electrolux Chairman Anders Scharp.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Electrolux had structured its operations
nation by nation. But after the Zanussi acquisition was
completed in 1984, most activities were reorganized into
international product divisions -- "wet" for washing
machines, "hot" for stoves and microwave ovens, "cold" for
refrigerators and freezers. Each division is now run by a
manager based in Stockholm, under Mr. Johansson's overall
supervision.</p>
<p>As Electrolux has rethought its approach to production, it
has closed two of eight factories in Europe. The six that
remain include a small factory in Spain producing about
350,000 units a year, one in England producing 300,000 a year
and one in Finland producing only 160,000 a year.</p>
<p>"The Finns have their own type of kitchen, and they are
nationalistic -- they want their fridges made there," Mr.
Takanen asserts. While it might make more sense economically
to close such operations, he adds, "the idea, rather, is to
try and tie our factories into an international network and
gain efficiencies that way."</p>
<p>Such a strategy has required developing new products for
market niches -- another factor that complicates Electrolux's
broader consolidation efforts. Earlier this year, the Finnish
factory started making the Quattro, a $1,300 deluxe
refrigerator with four doors and three separate temperature
compartments. Mr. Takanen expects that about 20% of the
company's European production soon will consist of such
specialty high-end models, and that this niche production
will permit some plants to reach an efficient production
level at only 300,000 units annually.</p>
<p>For the other 80% of production, much higher levels of
output remain crucial. Electrolux has poured money into a
flexible manufacturing system for its plant in Susegana, 40
miles north of Venice. Workers prepare kits of different
component combinations that are then added to standard
shells. The factory, which turns out 1.2 million
refrigerators a year, or 4,200 a day, can retool quickly
enough to produce its entire range of 1,000 combinations
within a week.</p>
<p>Another area of focus for Electrolux has been trying to
standardize sales and marketing across the Continent. After
its various acquisitions, the firm found itself with a
proliferation of European brands, as well as the
international brands Zanussi and Electrolux. Even the latter
had varying images in different markets: In Britain, for
example, Zanussi claimed upscale cachet, while in Sweden it
was considered middle of the market.</p>
<p>To address this problem, Electrolux grouped all the
different brands into four families. Two of the lines, Alpha
Electrolux and Delta Zanussi, are sold and advertised in
similar ways throughout Europe, while the other two, Beta and
Gamma, represent collections of national brands advertised
and sold differently.</p>
<p>"We can sell these two fridges anywhere in Europe," argues
Roberto Pezzetta, their designer. "It isn't important whether
the customer lives in Munich or Milan. What's important is
their life style, not their geography."</p>
<p>But insists Fulvio Cazzio, regional marketing manager for
German-speaking countries and Hungary, "Our markets still are
local; there are language barriers and different distribution
systems. In Italy, it's distribution and price which count,
while in Germany it's products and test results."</p>
<p>Mr. Takanen begs to differ. He points to a Europe-wide
trend toward smaller families made up of two wage earners who
live in single-family housing and have the means to travel.
"The markets," he maintains, "are beginning to merge."</p>
<p>Such differences of opinion underline the daunting
challenges for the company whose profit plummeted 41% last
year.</p>
<p>"Coordination of marketing and distribution activities and
the development of a new transnational organization have
turned out to be more complicated than we foresaw," Mr.
Scharp, chairman of the company, conceded in announcing the
disappointing results.</p>
<p>The setback won't thwart Electrolux's ambitious plans.</p>
<p>"Electrolux has started a trend towards Europeanization
which can't be reversed," notes Bill Coleman, an analyst at
the British brokerage firm James Capel & Co. "Appliances are
a cyclical industry, and they're well positioned for the next
upturn."</p>
