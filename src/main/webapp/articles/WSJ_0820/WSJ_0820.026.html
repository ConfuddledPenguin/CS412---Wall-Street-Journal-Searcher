	<p class="article-leader">SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Interactive Media Technologies Inc.
said it switched the investment firm on its $4 million
private placement of 12% convertible subordinated debentures.
The communications concern said it replaced the investment
firm R.G. Dickinson, a unit of Stotler Group Inc., a futures
concern which was forced into bankruptcy earlier this month.
   Interactive Media Technologies said it signed a letter of
intent for two other investment banking firms, A.T. Brod
Investment Banking and Wainwright Austin Stone & Co. to
manage the offering. Proceeds will be used to increase
manufacturing.</p>
