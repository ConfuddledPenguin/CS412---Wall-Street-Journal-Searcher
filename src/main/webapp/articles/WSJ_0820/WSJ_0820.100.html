	<p class="article-leader">HAL Inc., the parent of Hawaiian Airlines, reported that
its second-quarter net loss grew more than fivefold to $26.9
million, or $12.42 a share, because of heavy investments and
soft market conditions.
   In last year's second quarter, the Honolulu-based company
posted a net loss of $4.3 million, or $2.20 a share. The
year-ago loss reflects an $8.4 million gain on the sale of
property and equipment. Revenue slid to $79.6 million from
$84.2 million a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>HAL said heavy investments in aircraft improved its
on-time performance, and were expected to "slow our
turnaround." But unexpectedly soft market conditions, coupled
with the suspension of its military charters "made this
quarter especially rough," the company added.</p>
<p>For the six months, HAL's loss more than tripled to $43
million, or $19.89 a share, from $13 million, or $6.68 a
share, in last year's period. The year-ago loss reflects a
gain on sale of property and equipment of $8.4 million.
Revenue declined to $160.7 million from nearly $168 million a
year ago.</p>
