	<p class="article-leader">Cambridge BioScience Corp. said it is recalling 140 kits
of its 5-minute AIDS test because they no longer meet
manufacturer specifications.
   Worcester, Mass.-based Cambridge BioScience, which makes
the HIV-1 latex screening test, said the problem is consigned
only to kits belonging to Lot A6535 and is requesting
customers to discontinue use of them. A company spokesman
said that the company plans to ask these customers to return
the kits so they can be re-examined.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The defective lot, he said, "represents a very small
percentage of the total number of lots made available by the
company," since it began selling them last year. He noted
that the company's quality control department has tested
numerous other lots before and after the bad batch and found
the kits to be functioning properly.</p>
