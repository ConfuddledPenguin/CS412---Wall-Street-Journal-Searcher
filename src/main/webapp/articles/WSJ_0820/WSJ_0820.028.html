	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Program trading, reflecting for the first time
the effects of a newly approved "circuit breaker," declined
to 8.4% of New York Stock Exchange volume, or 17.5 million
shares a day, in the week ended Aug. 3.
   In the previous week, program trading accounted for 9.9%,
or 17 million shares a day, the Big Board said in its weekly
report on computer-aided trading strategies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At 9:53 a.m. on Aug. 3, a "circuit breaker" designed to
restrict program trading went into effect after the Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell 50 points in reaction to the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait. The restriction requires index-arbitrage
traders to wait for stock prices to rise from previous trades
before executing the stock side of their transactions.</p>
<p>In the first thirty minutes before the restriction on
program trading, the Big Board said CS First Boston Inc.'s
First Boston Corp. unit sold about 1.4 million shares to
facilitate customer orders while Kidder, Peabody & Co. sold
633,000 shares in program trading for its own account and
387,000 as an agent for customers.</p>
<p>Another circuit breaker called the sidecar went into
effect at 1:19 p.m. when September futures on the S&P 500
index showed a loss of 12 points, the Big Board said. The
sidecar, a special Big Board computer file, handled program
trading orders for a five-minute period. The Big Board said
Bear Stearns & Co. sold 683,000 shares in program trading for
its own account while Susquehanna Investment Group sold
535,000 shares between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial then reversed its fall, rising 52
points between 2 p.m. and 3 p.m. During that time Kidder
Peabody sold 506,00 shares for its own account and bought
147,000 shares as an agent. Goldman, Sachs & Co. bought
465,000 shares for its own account or as an agent, and
Merrill Lynch & Co. bought 408,000 shares as an agent.</p>
<p>For the week, the five most active program traders, which
accounted for 60% of all program trading on the exchange
were: Kidder Peabody (18.1 million shares), Morgan Stanley &
Co. (12.5 million), Susquehanna (9.2 million), Bear Stearns
(6.4 million) and PaineWebber Inc. (6.4 million).</p>
<p>The Big Board said of the five most active program
traders, Kidder Peabody, Susquehanna and Bear Stearns were
primarily involved in trading for their own accounts, while
the other two firms executed most of their program trading
for customers.</p>
<p>Program trading is the purchase or sale of a group of at
least 15 and often hundreds of different stocks. Stock-index
arbitrage involves stock purchases and sales with offsetting
trades in futures and options. For the week, stock-index
arbitrage was led by Kidder Peabody and Susquehanna, which
accounted for 55% of the total.</p>
