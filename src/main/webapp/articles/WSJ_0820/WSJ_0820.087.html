	<p class="article-leader">As Japan steps up its interest in Southeast Asia, the U.S.
economic presence in the region is in eclipse.
   U.S. government aid has been reduced to several Southeast
Asian countries over the past few years. Aid to the
Philippines continues high, but that to Indonesia has
steadily dropped, and U.S. aid for Thailand fell almost 50%
last year (to $10 million). Malaysia gets no aid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Officials at the Agency for International Development say
the shrinking numbers are due to broader U.S. budget
cutbacks, the region's booming economies, and needs in newly
free Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The squeeze comes while Japanese aid is flooding Southeast
Asia. In 1988, Japan sent $984 million to Indonesia, $360
million to Thailand and $534 million to the Philippines. That
represented more than 20 times U.S. aid to Indonesia, 15
times U.S. aid to Thailand, and almost double the U.S. aid to
the Philippines. Japan says it is the largest aid donor in 17
Asian nations.</p>
<p>In private investment, a similar Japan-U.S. gap shows up.
U.S. firms invested about $3.9 billion in Southeast Asia last
year, roughly half what Japanese concerns are expected to
spend there this year, the Conference Board estimates. The
business research group says that in the first half of 1990,
U.S. companies launched 110 foreign manufacturing ventures,
but only five were in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>"U.S. companies have a very strong European orientation
and very limited orientation to Southeast Asia," says Gail
Fosler, the Board's chief economist. Yet she expects Asia's
economic growth to far outstrip Europe's in coming years.</p>
<p>To be sure, several U.S. companies are already established
in Southeast Asia through subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Among them are Du Pont Co., Coca-Cola, Dow Chemical, Goodyear
and Hewlett-Packard. Still, Japan's greater rate of
investment in Asia is likely to give it a larger share of
some of the fastest-growing markets in the world, as well as
greater access to inexpensive labor.</p>
