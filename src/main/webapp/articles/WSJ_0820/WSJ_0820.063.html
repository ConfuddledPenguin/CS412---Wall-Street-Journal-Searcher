	<p class="article-leader">KATLEHONG, South Africa -- Under the steeple of St.
Peter's Chains Anglican Church, the survivors of South
Africa's savage political fighting gather to share their
tales of horror.
   Johanna Tefo, her toes poking out of her tattered shoes,
describes fleeing from her flimsy plywood shack as it
disappeared in flames; all she has left now is her
toothbrush, which is wedged behind her left ear like a
pencil. Selina Mqambela, still in a daze, recalls the eight
hours she spent hiding in a swamp, hoping the reeds would
conceal her from the men with spears and machetes. Duduzile
Mkhwanazi, betraying no emotion, tells of her frantic search
for her husband, which ended when she saw police slinging his
body onto a pile of corpses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When South African President F.W. de Klerk opened
Parliament in February with a series of stunning political
reforms, including the unbanning of black opposition groups
and a commitment to end white minority rule, he declared that
"the season of violence is over." But in the turbulent months
since then, it has only gotten worse, culminating in an
outburst of unrest in the past five days that has blacks
killing blacks, leaving more than 270 people dead, hundreds
more injured and thousands homeless.</p>
<p>The reforms have unleashed a flood of emotions bottled up
during 40 years of racial segregation and severe repression
of black politics. Over the past week, black townships around
Johannesburg have erupted with clashes between supporters of
Inkatha and the African National Congress, two rival parties
seeking to build their power bases in the newly open
political arena. The police and army, controlled by the white
government, have been accused of taking sides and in some
cases of abetting the violence.</p>
<p>"If this is what the future of South Africa will be, it
will be horrible," says the Reverend Z.T. Mohatsoa, who has
opened up St. Peter's to about fifty women and children left
homeless by the fighting. "We haven't struggled for black
liberation all these years to end up like this. Who will want
to live here?"</p>
<p>The fighting, tragically, has dashed the optimism
generated by the two initial meetings between the government
and the ANC aimed at clearing away the obstacles to
negotiations on a new constitution. Earlier this month, the
ANC suspended its 30-year-old guerrilla struggle against
white rule, and the government set up a timetable for the
release of political prisoners and return of exiles. Peace,
it seemed, was at hand.</p>
<p>But then the shacks of Katlehong -- scarred by some of the
fiercest fighting -- and neighboring Thokoza, southeast of
Johannesburg, went up in flames, and so did the spirit of
negotiation. As a result, the peace process, and the
political leaders brokering it, are under intense pressure.
Right-wing whites opposed to the reforms last week broke up a
speech by Mr. de Klerk, who they say is plunging the country
into anarchy. ANC leader Nelson Mandela and Inkatha chief
Mangosuthu Buthelezi seem powerless to control their
supporters. Deep-seated mistrust between the organizations
have kept the two black leaders from coming together for a
joint call for peace. While each of them meets with the
government, they have yet to talk to each other.</p>
<p>The most disturbing aspect of the violence for both black
and white South Africans, as well as for foreigners looking
to invest in the country's post-apartheid economy, is the
ugly overtone of tribal feuding, which has contributed to the
downfall of much of the rest of Africa. The women seeking
refuge at St. Peter's, who come from a mixture of tribes, say
the Katlehong violence started when Zulus loyal to Inkatha
(which is Zulu-based) poured out of migrant labor dormitories
and attacked the squatter community, particularly targeting
Xhosas. (Mr. Mandela is a Xhosa.) Then, say the women, the
Xhosa men would regroup and attack the Zulus. The cycle of
revenge spun out of control, and spread to other areas around
Johannesburg.</p>
<p>"The picture from this is that Africans can't govern
themselves, that Africans are irresponsible, that we don't
care for life," says Faith Mashiloane, a member of the
Katlehong Civic Association. "But that isn't true. I tell
you, it isn't true."</p>
<p>The officers of the association, which is aligned with
groups supportive of the ANC, have come to St. Peter's to
figure out what went wrong. One blames it on the legacy of
apartheid, which accentuated tribal differences by trying to
divide the black majority into ethnic homelands. Another says
the impoverished living conditions of blacks breed
frustration and hostility.</p>
<p>Many of the civic officials blame conservative elements in
the police who, they say, are intent on destabilizing the
political negotiations and therefore are slow to curb the
violence. (The police vehemently deny this.) Still more blame
Inkatha for raising tensions in the area; one refers to a
pamphlet distributed by Inkatha calling on Zulus to resist
being ruled by a Xhosa, meaning Mr. Mandela. Perhaps, another
volunteers, Mr. Mandela should overrule ANC objections to
meeting with Mr. Buthelezi and test Inkatha's claims to
peace.</p>
<p>The women refugees at St. Peter's are weary of saying
who's to blame. Letitia Pekane, a social worker at the church
who is trying to help them settle into new homes, conjures up
a familiar image of South Africa. The country is like a
zebra, she says. If someone kills the black stripes, the
white ones die too, and vice versa.</p>
<p>"If one dies, all die," she says. "That's what is
happening now. We are all dying."</p>
