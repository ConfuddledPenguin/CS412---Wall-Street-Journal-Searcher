	<p class="article-leader">A growing number of limited partnership sponsors are
cutting back on the information they make available to
investors.
   With the approval of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the sponsors have stopped filing some public
financial reports -- at least until the SEC reaches a
decision on a key disclosure issue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The reports involved are the annual 10K and quarterly 10Q
reports most public companies are required to file with the
agency. How investors are affected will vary from partnership
to partnership. But at a time when at least $5 billion of
partnerships sold a few years ago are foundering, some
analysts and financial advisers are up in arms.</p>
<p>"It's outrageous," says Spencer Jefferies, a Dallas
partnership analyst. At least 40 of the big public
partnerships he tracks have recently quit making the SEC
filings. He estimates they raised as much as $1 billion from
several thousand investors.</p>
<p>Rep. Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.), chairman of the House
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, says the
panel plans to look into the matter. The question, he says,
is whether allowing companies to forgo the detailed reports
runs "counter to a fundamental purpose of our securities laws
-- providing investors with the facts they need to make
informed investment decisions."</p>
<p>For more than four years now, the SEC has been debating
whether federal laws that require the filings for most
publicly marketed investments should continue to apply to
partnerships and other securities that aren't widely traded.
"There is some concern that the reporting requirements are
burdensome," an SEC spokesman says.</p>
<p>While the debate continues, the SEC has been granting
temporary filing exemptions. Typically, they are good for two
or three years, when they can be renewed if the SEC still
hasn't decided whether to make them permanent. But they can
be revoked if the agency decides there are material changes
that affect investors.</p>
<p>The SEC says it has processed applications for more than
850 waivers. Lately, more and more of those requests are
coming from partnership sponsors, especially troubled
sponsors of widely held partnerships.</p>
<p>Sponsors no longer reporting to the SEC say that not
having to consult securities lawyers and perhaps hire
accountants to help with the filings can benefit their
investors. It "cuts down on partnership expenses," says a
spokeswoman for Angeles Corp., a Los Angeles syndicator. It
received a filing exemption for its Angeles Income Properties
Ltd. real estate partnership in 1988. Six months ago, it
requested waivers for 13 more partnerships. Industry sources
estimate that at least 40,000 investors put more than $400
million into the partnerships involved.</p>
<p>John Provine, managing general partner of August Real
Estate Investment Inc. of Irvine, Calif., says his company
quit making SEC reports last fall on all 10 of its public
partnerships. They raised about $30 million from 2,000
investors. The cost of the filings ran "anywhere from $50,000
to $150,000 per year per partnership," he says.</p>
<p>New York-based Integrated Resources Inc., which is in
Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings, also stopped reporting
last fall on seven of its National Property Investors real
estate partnerships and 17 American Leasing partnerships.
They raised more than $540 million from 58,000 investors.</p>
<p>Because limited partnerships are long-term investments,
with only limited trading in an informal resale, or
"secondary," market, Integrated thought the cost of filing
SEC reports on its partnerships was unjustified, a
spokeswoman says.</p>
<p>So did Boston-based Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. Liberty
received filing exemptions for seven of its real estate
partnerships last December. The partnerships, which have
about 20,000 investors, raised $215 million.</p>
<p>Without the 10K and 10Q reports, the information available
to partnership investors varies widely, says Keith Allaire,
research director at Robert A. Stanger & Co., a Shrewsbury,
N.J., partnership publishing and consulting firm. Most
sponsors send their limited partners audited financial
statements at least once a year. And "some of their annual
reports are substantially superior to the SEC reports," says
Mr. Allaire.</p>
<p>But it's only in their public filings that many other
syndicators reveal much in the way of historical information.
"There's much more analysis," says Jackie Coyne, senior vice
president of Financial Network Investment Corp., a Torrance,
Calif., brokerage firm. "Limited partners interested in an
in-depth review can really understand what the performance
has been."</p>
<p>The public filings are the only source of information on
many smaller partnerships.</p>
<p>"This industry needs more disclosure, not less," says Ms.
Coyne.</p>
