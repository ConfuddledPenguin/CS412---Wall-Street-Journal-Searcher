	<p class="article-leader">SPRING VALLEY, N.Y. -- Par Pharmaceutical, plagued by
recalls of its generic drugs, reported a loss for the third
fiscal quarter and said it expected losses for "at least the
next two quarters."
   The company also said it expects to report a loss for
fiscal 1990.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the quarter ending June 30, the loss widened to $5.2
million, or 46 cents a share, from $1.8 million, or 16 cents
a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 65% to $9.7 million from
$27.6 million.</p>
<p>In March and April, Quad Pharmaceuticals, a Par
subsidiary, recalled 29 injectable products because the
company had made manufacturing changes without following Food
and Drug Administration requirements. Quad voluntarily placed
a moratorium on shipments of other products comprising 85% of
its product line.</p>
<p>The company reported a third-quarter charge to operations
of $4.7 million in connection with the recalls.</p>
<p>In announcing the results, Par said that continuing
"manufacturing difficulties" at Quad would continue to
"adversely affect" operations for at least two quarters.</p>
<p>In August 1989, Par placed a moratorium on shipments of
its entire oral solid product line. By the end of the most
recent quarter, about 70% of that line had been reintroduced.
Par said it had begun to rebuild the Quad management team.</p>
<p>In the first nine months, Par had a net loss of $10.8
million or 97 cents a share, on $41.9 million in sales;
results included a $10.4 million pre-tax charge in connection
with product recalls and related matters. A year earlier, net
income was $3.7 million, or 34 cents a share, on sales of
$85.7 million.</p>
