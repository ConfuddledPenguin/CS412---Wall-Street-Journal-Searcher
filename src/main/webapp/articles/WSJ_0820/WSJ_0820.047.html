	<p class="article-leader">JAPAN'S ANTI-NUCLEAR STANCE</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japan, at an international review of the 20-year-old
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, will press for stronger
enforcement measures to halt the spread of nuclear arms, the
government said.</p>
<p>The reviewing-committee session, which begins today in
Geneva, is aimed at resolving problems in the treaty, which
is widely expected to be extended beyond its expiration date
in 1995.</p>
<p>Japan will propose that the nuclear "club" of nations that
possess atomic weapons allow the International Atomic Energy
Agency to inspect all their nuclear facilities, officials
said. Nuclear-weapons nations are now allowed to specify
which sites will be open to inspection by the United Nations
agency, while signatories without nuclear weapons must open
all sites.</p>
<p>Japan will also seek stronger controls on the export of
nuclear technology, including a requirement for detailed
explanations of the purpose of related equipment before the
granting of export permits. In addition, Japan will press for
nonsignatory nations to join the treaty and for greater
arms-reduction efforts by members of the nuclear club.</p>
<p>The professed nuclear powers are China, Britain, France,
India, the Soviet Union and the U.S., but several other
nations are believed capable of producing nuclear arms.</p>
<p>BERLIN BIAS</p>
<p>A majority of Germans favor Berlin as the capital of a
united Germany, according to 2,093 West Germans and 799 East
Germans surveyed by the West German Interior Ministry. The
survey found 55% of the West Germans in favor of Berlin,
compared with 43% who prefer the capital staying in Bonn.
Among East Germans, 91% want Berlin and 7% like Bonn. For
cost reasons, many leading West German officials are opposed
to moving the seat of government to Berlin.</p>
<p>SOUTH KOREAN ARMS BUDGET</p>
<p>South Korea's Defense Ministry called for an 18% rise in
the military budget next year, with about half the increase
to go for pay rises. However, the Economic Planning Board has
proposed a boost of less than 10%. The ministry proposal, for
military spending equivalent to $11 billion, would represent
nearly 29% of the nation's total 1991 budget.</p>
<p>FOREIGN AFFAIRS TRANSLATED</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs, an influential U.S. journal of commentary
on international matters, said Chuokoron, a Japanese monthly,
will translate and publish about 40 Foreign Affairs essays
and articles annually over the next five years. Chuokoron
also carries Japanese commentary on politics, economics,
history and international relations. Foreign Affairs is
published by the Council on Foreign Relations, New York.</p>
<p>SAUSAGES FOR SLIMMERS</p>
<p>Sundby-Wenbo, a Danish pork-products cooperative, said it
is seeking world-wide patents for a new process that cuts the
fat content of sausages and other processed meat to 3%, about
one-fifth the level in the leanest products now available.
Company officials said the process substitutes vegetable
extract for fat but doesn't affect taste and consistency.
They added that the lean-meat products, which the company
plans to launch in Denmark by the end of this month, contain
only one-third the calories and half as much salt as other
processed meats.</p>
<p>TAIWAN COOLS OFF</p>
<p>Taiwan's economy is expected to grow 5.24% in 1990, down
from 7.33% in 1989 and the lowest rate since 1983, a
government agency reported. The estimate trailed both the
government's 1990 target of 7% and a prediction in May of
7.23%. Officials attributed the slowing economic activity
mainly to lackluster stock-market performance, rising labor
costs, decreasing exports and continuing declines in private
investment.</p>
<p>CLOSE SHAVE IN ISRAEL</p>
<p>Israel's chief rabbi, Mordechai Eliahu, ruled that
Orthodox Jewish men may shave their beards so gas masks fit
properly in the event of a chemical attack by Iraq, and he
urged them to carry scissors in case they need a fast trim.</p>
<p>Many Orthodox men have full beards and wear side curls.
But, in his ruling, Rabbi Eliahu said that although Jewish
tradition always speaks of Jewish men wearing beards, there
was no prohibition against shaving in the body of Jewish law.</p>
<p>"Bearded men have to shave off their beards before wearing
a gas mask, because even a two-day beard prevents the mask
from sealing properly and may allow the gas to penetrate
inside," the rabbi said.</p>
<p>The Israeli government has considered distributing masks
because of threats by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to
attack the Jewish state with chemical weapons. Private sales
of masks have boomed.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Japan's cosmetic-surgery business, once patronized largely
by entertainers and bar hostesses, is getting a new look of
its own. Young women are flooding surgeons' offices for
operations ranging from nose jobs and double eyelids to bust
enhancements. . . . Moscow, which often boasts of having the
world's best ice cream, has a shortage in these waning days
of summer. Officials said two of the Soviet capital's three
ice-cream factories are closed for repairs.</p>
