	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Fears of a recession are sending some "junk"
bond investors running for cover.
   But unlike the big 1989 sell-offs, when investors dumped
high-yield, below-investment-grade junk bonds almost
indiscriminately, the selling this time is focused on issues
that have the most to lose in an economic downturn.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Investors are bailing out of chemical, housing and other
cyclical issues. Meanwhile, Wall Street analysts have been
urging clients to push their money into bonds issued by
supermarkets, food companies and other traditionally
noncyclical industries -- and investors seem to be doing just
that.</p>
<p>"We're positioned for a recession," said Jim Sullivan,
president of Sullivan Money Management Inc. in Houston, a
$100 million junk-bond investor. "We've been buying bonds of
cosmetic companies like Mary Kay and Revlon, food purveyors,
and some of the {less-leveraged} cable-TV companies."</p>
<p>Mr. Sullivan said he is shying away from heavy-industrial
companies' bonds, as well as bonds issued by casinos,
jewelers or other companies that rely on growth in disposable
income.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of August, some once well-regarded
junk bonds of industrial companies have taken a pounding.
Quantum Chemical Corp.'s 13% bonds of 2004, which had traded
at 84 1/4 cents on the dollar as recently as Aug. 3, tumbled
8.6% by last Friday to 77 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>Similarly, the textile maker Burlington Industries Inc.'s
13 7/8% bonds of 2000, which had traded at 85 cents on the
dollar as recently as Aug. 10, slipped to 81 cents by last
Friday. The reason, according to Catherine Montgomery, head
of research at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.:
"Fear of a recession."</p>
<p>Overall, however, the junk-bond market in the past few
weeks has held up much better than the rout in
heavy-industrial companies' bonds would suggest. This is
partly because investors are moving into noncyclical issues,
and partly because the junk-bond market has already done
plenty of adjusting to bad news in the past 18 months.</p>
<p>Financial markets in general have tumbled since Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, because of worries about sharply
higher oil prices and their implications for U.S. economy.
But while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen
6.7% this month, the broad junk-bond market is down only 2%,
according to First Boston Corp., or off 3%, according to
Salomon Brothers Inc. By comparison, 10-year Treasury notes
have fallen about 2.3%.</p>
<p>"Stocks were a little late in realizing what the junk-bond
market knew a while earlier: We're heading into recession,"
said Mark Durbiano, a portfolio manager at Federated Research
Corp. Mr. Durbiano has eked out total returns of about 3% for
clients this year, slightly above the average for junk-bond
mutual funds. But he is cautious about the outlook for the
next year.</p>
<p>For some highly leveraged, economically sensitive
junk-bond issuers, "Their viability will come into question,"
Mr. Durbiano said. "It will be a matter of whether they can
make it past the bottom of this cycle."</p>
<p>Reflecting his economic worries, Mr. Durbiano said, his
junk-bond portfolio is concentrated in supermarket issues,
such as Safeway Stores Inc., Kroger Co., Tops Markets Inc.
and Eagle Food Centers Inc., and in cable-television issues.
Most of these issues declined only 1% to 4% in the August
sell-off.</p>
<p>Energy junk bonds also are attracting some notice, as the
Mideast conflict is leading to higher oil prices. Mr.
Durbiano said he is looking at Mesa L.P. bonds, though he
hasn't decided whether he will buy them. Citicorp calculates
that energy-related junk bonds declined just 0.3% so far in
August, one of the best showings for an industry group.</p>
<p>Several junk-bond specialists argue that even after the
past 2 1/2 weeks' sharp price adjustments, the exodus from
recession-sensitive bonds may have farther to go.</p>
<p>In a report reaching clients last week, Citicorp's
high-yield research director, Mariel Clemensen, wrote that
her "first impressions" were that the Mideast oil shock would
be negative for bonds issued by building materials, casino,
metals, restaurant, airline and trucking companies. It would
be neutral to positive for cable-TV, machinery, oil and gas,
and supermarket issues, she said.</p>
<p>Last Friday, Ms. Clemensen said she expanded her analysis
with a more detailed review. The importance of separating
recession-prone bonds from others still holds, she said,
"only more so."</p>
