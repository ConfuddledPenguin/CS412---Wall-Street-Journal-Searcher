	<p class="article-leader">LABUAN, Malaysia -- This sleepy Malaysian free port off
Borneo's north coast hardly conjures up visions of an
international offshore financial center. But Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's government sees just that.
   Mr. Mahathir's ruling National Front has big plans to
develop the 78-square-kilometer island into a tax haven along
the lines of Caribbean and European financial shelters that
enjoy low-tax regimes and minimal government regulation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many analysts, however, say the plans may be too grand and
the rivalry among global financial centers too intense for
Labuan to meet Kuala Lumpur's expectations in the near
future. They also note that the Asian-Pacific region already
offers a plethora of tax incentives for investors.</p>
<p>The linchpin in efforts to transform the island is a
package of six pieces of legislation designed to spur a
flurry of financial activity. They are expected to become law
soon.</p>
<p>Supporters of the Mahathir plan note that Labuan is
advantageously located. Though air links are minimal, the
island is only several hours' flight from Hong Kong and
Singapore. Proponents also expect Labuan to appeal to jittery
Hong Kong executives and financiers seeking new legal
domiciles for their operations before China regains
sovereignty over the British colony in 1997.</p>
<p>But skeptics argue that Labuan needs more than location
and investment incentives. They note the dearth of
telecommunications, travel, lodging, office and recreational
facilities on the island, not to mention personnel. Labuan's
population largely lacks the education and training required
to staff financial concerns.</p>
<p>In addition, financial and tax consultants cite
inconsistencies and unspecified fees in the various bills.</p>
<p>"I've told my clients to sit tight," says a Kuala Lumpur
lawyer, who predicts that the hastily drafted legislative
measures will undergo extensive revisions in the years ahead.</p>
<p>Many have faith, though. Arjunan Subramaniam, director of
tax services for Arthur Andersen's Malaysian unit and an
adviser to the government on the project, says, "You have to
take the first step; you have to begin somewhere. It'll take
about 30 years to make it a fully developed tax haven."</p>
<p>Labuan was ceded to the central authorities in April 1984
by the Sabah state government, then led by Chief Minister
Harris Salleh. Since that time, the federal government has
faced increasing public pressure from East Malaysians to make
something of the island. Ill-conceived industrial projects
under the Harris administration have saddled Labuan with
heavy debt, and its economy is largely dependent on the
socalled barter trade with Filipino merchants and others.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahathir opted to pursue the taxhaven route some five
years ago, consultants say. But it wasn't until he pressed
the relevant government ministries in November to draft the
necessary legislation by this year that the plans began to
take shape.</p>
<p>Among other things, the bill stipulates that offshore
concerns involved in so-called non-trading activities would
pay no tax at all. Such activities are defined mainly as
investments in securities, loans, deposits and immovable
properties, such as buildings. And as an inducement to
attract professionals and contractors to Labuan, accounting
and law firms, as well as construction companies, would have
only 50% of their profits subject to Malaysia's 35%
corporate-tax rate for the next five years.</p>
<p>Other inducements for offshore companies would include
exemption from stamp duties; no withholding tax on interest,
royalties and technical fees; no tax on dividends to
beneficiaries and shareholders of the concerns; and relaxed
restrictions on the granting of multiple-entry visas to
foreigners working for the concerns.</p>
<p>The legislation would also safeguard the secrecy
requirements of the banks' clients, a requisite of most tax
havens.</p>
<p>One part of the legislation, the Offshore Companies Bill,
has been criticized as being cumbersome and time-consuming.
The longest of the measures at 129 pages, the bill spells out
the incorporation, registration and administration of
offshore companies in Labuan. Critics note that other tax
havens, such as the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman
Islands, permit the registration of companies in about a day.
They fear it would take several months to fulfill all the
provisions in the Malaysian bill.</p>
<p>Government consultants say the legislative package, with a
few expectations, would meet the needs of companies and
individuals seeking a low-tax regime for certain operations
in Southeast Asia. But they caution that today's
sophisticated global telecommunications network also means
that they can just as easily use other tax havens.</p>
