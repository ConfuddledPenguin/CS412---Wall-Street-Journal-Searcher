	<p class="article-leader">A federal appeals court ruled that even innocent property
owners must meet stiff standards in challenging drug-law
forfeitures.
   The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said
the government can seize property on which drug transactions
occurred unless the owner "did all that reasonably could be
expected to prevent further illicit use of the premises."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although the law protects innocent property owners from
having their buildings seized, the appeals court said lack of
knowledge isn't enough to avoid forfeiture -- property owners
must also prove that they didn't consent to the drug
activity. To prove lack of consent, the owner must show that
strong steps were taken to deter the drug violations, the
court ruled.</p>
<p>"Consent in this situation must be something more than a
state of mind," the appeals-court panel said. Affirming a
lower-court ruling, the appellate judges said, "Once an owner
has knowledge, he gives his consent to the narcotics activity
unless he then does all that reasonably could be expected to
prevent further illicit use of the premises."</p>
<p>Federal appeals courts and district judges have been
divided on the innocent property-owner issue. In a similar
case earlier this month, a U.S. district judge in Manhattan
ordered the government to return the property after finding
that the law "doesn't require claimant to prove that he has
done all he could reasonably be expected to do to prevent"
the illegal activity.</p>
<p>The federal appeals court in Manhattan, however, said the
seriousness of the drug problem must be considered in
deciding how the forfeiture law applies.</p>
<p>"Congress intended forfeiture to be a powerful weapon in
the war on drugs. The illicit sale and use of drugs is taking
an ever increasing toll on our nation," the appeals court
said. "Given the present circumstances, defining `consent' .
. . as the failure to take all reasonable steps to prevent
illicit use of premises once one acquires knowledge of that
use is entirely appropriate."</p>
<p>In the case before the appeals court, the owner of the
property, Manhattan-based West 141st St. Realty Corp., argued
that the company took adequate measures to stop drug activity
at the six-story Manhattan building by refusing to accept
rent from tenants who were arrested in a drug raid. The
company claimed that the trial judge erred by telling the
jury that the innocent-owner defense could prevail only if
Realty proved that it had taken every reasonable measure to
prevent the drug trafficking.</p>
<p>Based on the trial judge's instructions, a federal jury
decided in favor of the government and approved the
forfeiture.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the company couldn't be reached for comment.</p>

<p>JUDGE RAISES THE STAKES in suit against USX and
steelworkers' union.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Edwin L. Nelson in Alabama said an
employee suit over a concessionary labor contract can be
certified as a class action with regard to liability and
compensation. Thirty-eight current or former workers of a USX
Corp. plant near Birmingham allege that they lost income from
an allegedly illegal pact between USX and the union, the
United Steelworkers.</p>
<p>If the Pittsburgh-based steel and energy concern and the
union lose the case, they would have to compensate about
4,000 workers.</p>
<p>Prior to the judge's decision this week, J. Vernon Patrick
Jr., who is representing the plaintiffs, submitted documents
to the court alleging $144 million in damages. Mr. Patrick
said he will seek treble damages under the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.</p>
<p>"It's been a hard-fought battle, but it's only the battle
and not the war," he said.</p>
<p>USX and union officials declined to comment.</p>
<p>The suit, filed two years ago, alleges that a 1983 labor
contract covering steelworkers at USX's Fairfield, Ala.,
plant violated federal labor laws because two union
representatives, E.B. Rich and Thermon Phillips, received
special pension benefits from the company.</p>
<p>Last month, a federal jury in Birmingham found USX and the
union officials guilty of violating federal labor laws in a
pension bribery scheme. USX and the union said they would
appeal the decision.</p>
<p>The civil case, which had been suspended while the
criminal case was in progress, is due to go to trial in
September 1991.</p>

<p>SECURITIES INDUSTRY SUES to halt Florida
broker-arbitration law.</p>
<p>The Securities Industry Association and eight member
brokerage houses sued the Florida comptroller last Friday,
challenging the constitutionality of a recently enacted law
that allows investors the option of bringing their disputes
with brokers to arbitrators not affiliated with the
securities industry. Florida is the first state to enact a
law that requires brokers to allow their customers the
freedom to take their disputes to the American Arbitration
Association, an independent forum, or to arbitration panels
subsidized by the industry.</p>
<p>AAA president Robert Coulson has hailed the Securities and
Investor Protection Act as a safeguard for small investors'
"right to select." But last Friday, William Fitzpatrick, the
SIA's general counsel, said a provision of the Florida law
unfairly singles out arbitration clauses in brokerage firm
contracts. Mr. Fitzpatrick cited a recent U.S. Supreme Court
decision that the Federal Arbitration Act prohibits states
from singling out arbitration agreements for tighter controls
than other business contracts. In that ruling, the high court
knocked down a Massachusetts regulation similar to Florida's
law.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzpatrick contends that if the Florida law stands,
each of the other 49 states might also impose their own
special conditions on arbitration agreements. "Soon we will
have 50 different versions of what an arbitration agreement
should look like and nobody would use arbitration," Mr.
Fitzpatrick said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Florida comptroller said the office
had not received the suit and declined to comment. The bill
goes into effect Oct. 1.</p>

<p>HOUSTON LAWYER gets jail term for anti-Semitic remarks
about judge.</p>
<p>State District Judge Michael McSpadden sentenced attorney
Jack Love to six months in jail along with a $1,500 fine for
the derogatory comments, which were aimed at County
Court-at-Law Judge Sherman Ross.</p>
<p>According to testimony, Mr. Love had become angry last
June 21 after Judge Ross adjourned a court session without
setting a trial date for one of Mr. Love's clients. Witnesses
testified Mr. Love denounced Judge Ross to several court
workers, referring to him as a "little Jew" and threatening
to burn a cross on his lawn.</p>
<p>After learning of the remarks, Judge Ross scheduled a
hearing last month and held Mr. Love in contempt, sentencing
him to 90 days in jail and imposing a $500 fine. The action
was appealed to Judge McSpadden who last week upheld the
contempt finding and increased the penalties. Calling Mr.
Love's behavior "obscene" and "reprehensible," Judge
McSpadden said he would ask the State Bar of Texas to look
into the matter.</p>
<p>Edward Wheeler, a Pasadena, Texas, attorney representing
Mr. Love, had argued that a contempt finding wasn't warranted
because the court wasn't in session when Mr. Love made his
remarks, and some were made outside of the courtroom. He also
contended that the remarks were protected by the First
Amendment.</p>
<p>Mr. Wheeler called the punishment "harsh" and said he
would attempt to get the penalties overturned.</p>

<p>ODOR ORDINANCE in Jacksonville is struck down by judge for
vagueness.</p>
<p>The city of Jacksonville, Fla., lost a round in its
three-year battle against foul-smelling industries when Duval
Circuit Judge John Southwood declared that criminal
provisions of the city's ordinance aimed at stemming odors
are unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The judge said the criminal portions of the ordinance,
which has been on the books for three years, failed to
provide an objective standard as to what constitutes a
criminal violation. Criminal penalties included a fine of up
to $500 a day and 90 days in prison for each violation.</p>
<p>"What we're saying is there is not an ascertainable
standard of conduct to measure what is criminal behavior,"
said Edward Booth Sr., a Jacksonville attorney for SCM Glidco
Organics Corp., a chemical company that makes various
products from wood-pulp residue and pine tars, one of two
companies that challenged the criminal provisions of the odor
ordinance. "It was vague and ambiguous," he said. Mr. Booth
said SCM Glidco, a unit of London-based Hanson PLC, has made
every effort to eliminate offensive odors by installing the
best technology to cope with smell problems.</p>
<p>Daniel D. Richardson, chief of the environmental law
division for the city, said Jacksonville, which has a large
wood-pulp and related chemical manufacturing industry, will
continue to battle foul smells with its civil penalties.</p>
<p>It will also assess whether to appeal the ruling or to
fashion a new criminal ordinance.</p>
