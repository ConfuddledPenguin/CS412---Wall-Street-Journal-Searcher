	<p class="article-leader">CARACAS, Venezuela -- President Carlos Andres Perez
strongly suggested that Venezuela and other OPEC countries
will soon increase production to make up for embargoed Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil.
   "OPEC has the obligation to maintain production at the
22.5 million barrels a day level agreed to at the last OPEC
conference," said Mr. Perez during an interview at his ornate
office in the presidential palace here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. Perez said Venezuela, like Saudi Arabia, wanted if
possible to reach agreement with the other members of OPEC,
or the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, to
"provisionally" increase their production quotas. The higher
production would make up a large part of the roughly four
million barrels a day of Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil removed from
the world market by United Nations sanctions following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Under such an OPEC agreement, Venezuela could increase its
production by up to 500,000 barrels a day from its current
OPEC quota of 1.95 million barrels a day. "OPEC must maintain
its cohesion," said Mr. Perez.</p>
<p>Mr. Perez said a steep price rise resulting from a failure
to replace the lost production would be "disastrous" for the
world economy, and especially for the economies of developing
countries.</p>
<p>Venezuela, along with Saudi Arabia, has issued a call for
an OPEC meeting to consider a production increase. But as
energy minister Celestino Armas flew to Geneva Saturday to
meet with his Saudi counterpart, only Ecuador and the United
Arab Emirates had agreed to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>Venezuelan officials said the proposed meeting would be
unlikely to produce an agreement on quotas, since several
member countries are afraid of crossing Iraq. If the meeting
fails, then OPEC members who are in a position to increase
their production -- Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Nigeria and the
United Arab Emirates -- would probably agree among themselves
to temporarily apportion the four million barrels a day
oil-production shortfall until the crisis is over.</p>
<p>The officials, who are anxious to preserve OPEC, said it
would be possible to reassign the shortfall under an OPEC
regulation that permits re-allotment of quotas that are not
being used by member nations. At any rate, the issue should
be settled this week, the officials said.</p>
<p>Mr. Perez, who has been accused at home and in the U.S. of
waffling on the issue of raising Venezuelan production,
denied that he has been pressured by the U.S. to do so. "The
U.S. attitude towards Venezuela's position has been one of
frank gratitude," Mr. Perez said.</p>
<p>During the interview, Mr. Perez repeatedly emphasized what
he called OPEC's "compromise" to produce 22.5 million barrels
a day of oil for the world market, and the calamitous
consequences for developing nations in particular of another
oil shock. Mr. Perez said that Venezuela had "unbreakable
obligations" to supply the U.S. and Latin America. "Brazil
used to get 200,000 barrels a day from Iraq," he said. "They
are living from day to day. Venezuela will have to help."</p>
<p>Mr. Armas, the energy minister, said that while high oil
inventories had so far helped cushion the crisis for
industrial countries like Japan, countries like Argentina and
Brazil, with small or nonexisting inventories, were fast
approaching a "critical situation."</p>
<p>Mr. Armas said that most of the projected increase in
Venezuelan production would be heavier crudes. That could
cause some marketing and refining headaches: In most
instances, the refining of heavy crudes provides a higher
percentage of fuel oil, for which Venezuela would have to
find new markets, said a former senior official of Petroleos
de Venezuela, the state oil company.</p>
<p>Mr. Armas said that at the beginning of the Gulf crisis,
Venezuela had briefly raised production over its OPEC quota
"out of nervousness." But he said the increase sent the wrong
signal to the market and the country was now keeping within
its quota.</p>
