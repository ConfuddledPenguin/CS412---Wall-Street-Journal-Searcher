	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department filed a consent
decree that would allow Offshore Pipelines Inc. to complete
its proposed acquisition of marine-construction vessels and
other assets from Brown & Root Inc., a unit of Halliburton
Co., for about $80 million.
   The decree would settle an antitrust suit also filed
Friday that challenged the acquisition. The agreement
requires Offshore Pipelines, based in Houston, to divest
itself of two Brown & Root barges used for laying or burying
oil and gas pipes offshore.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>James Rill, head of the Justice Department's antitrust
division, said that without the divestiture, the proposed
acquisition would be anti-competitive in the U.S. portion of
the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Offshore Pipelines' sale of the barges, Mr. Rill said,
"will ensure that the acquisition of Brown & Root's vessels
by OPI will not raise the cost of offshore oil and gas
exploration and production" in the gulf, and will create more
competition in that market.</p>
<p>Dallas-based Halliburton said it will realize a pretax
gain of about $33 million for the sale.</p>
<p>The assets include 23 derrick, pipelay and other marine
construction vessels, as well as interest in certain marine
construction support facilities in the Far East and the U.S.
The sale of a marine construction facility in the Middle East
to Offshore Pipelines is expected to be completed later this
year.</p>
