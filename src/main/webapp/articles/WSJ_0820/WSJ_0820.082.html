	<p class="article-leader">BRASILIA, Brazil -- The government said it would shortly
sell 10 state-run companies and its minority holdings in one
petrochemical plant and two major petroleum refineries in an
effort to streamline Brazil's economy and reduce a national
deficit of $31 billion.
   The sale of state companies is a key to the sweeping
economic reforms announced March 16 by President Fernando
Collor de Mello.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The package, which froze $115 billion in savings accounts
and money market deposits for 18 months and made deep cuts in
spending, curbed record inflation of almost 5,000% a year.</p>
<p>The companies, including some steel concerns were expected
to bring between $9 billion and $10 billion in revenue, said
Eduardo Modiano, head of the government's commission on
privatizing state firms.</p>
<p>Mr. Collor, who took office March 15, also promised to
sell 200 state-run enterprises with a combined debt of $62
billion by 1992.</p>
<p>Brazilian law permits foreign investors to purchase up to
40% of investment shares with voting rights. Foreign
investors can buy 100% of a company's shares without voting
privileges.</p>
<p>Foreign companies with subsidiaries in Brazil can use the
frozen new cruzados blocked in the Central Bank under the
plan to purchase shares with no limits.</p>
