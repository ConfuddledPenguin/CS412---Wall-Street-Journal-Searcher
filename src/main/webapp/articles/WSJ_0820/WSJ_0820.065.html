	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. offered a lump-sum
buy-out of as much as $65,000 to its blue-collar workers
willing to leave the company.
   The No. 3 U.S. auto maker is in the midst of a $1.5
billion cost-cutting program, which includes early retirement
for some white-collar workers. Chrysler also is entering
contract talks with the United Auto Workers union, in which
job security will be an issue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The offer to about 60,000 of Chrysler UAW workers is
similar to programs used at Ford Motor Co. and General Motors
Corp. UAW contracts with the auto makers specifically provide
for such "early termination" payments.</p>
<p>Chrysler officials said they expect about 600 workers to
take the offer before the Aug. 24 deadline. The company said
about 450 already have signed up. Ford said only five of its
workers have taken the payments this year. The payments range
from $12,000 for workers with at least one year of service to
$65,000 for more experienced workers.</p>
