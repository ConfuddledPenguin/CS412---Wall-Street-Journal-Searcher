	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- Chancellor Helmut Kohl knew he had overcome the
last obstacles to German unity when Mikhail Gorbachev invited
him to the Soviet leader's birthplace in the Caucasus to talk
things over in July, something Mr. Gorbachev hadn't done with
any other foreign leader.
   "You don't invite someone to your home in order to fight
with you," he told an aide.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Kohl set down their helicopter
in a wheat field en route to their critical talks, local
peasants offered them a large wheel of bread with a porcelain
dish of salt baked into the middle. Following local
tradition, Mr. Gorbachev put his lips to the bowl as if to
kiss the bread, and he took a taste. Not to be outdone, Mr.
Kohl sprinkled some of the salt across the bread in the shape
of a crucifix. "This is how we do it where I'm from," he
said.</p>
<p>Increasingly, those affectionate July meetings look like a
sign of things to come. West German Foreign Minister Hans
Dietrich Genscher and his Soviet counterpart, Eduard
Shevardnadze, reached agreement in Moscow on Friday to allow
the four World War II Allied powers and the two Germanys to
sign an agreement on Sept. 12 on German unification. It was
their 11th meeting this year.</p>
<p>And the Soviet Union and West Germany were seeking
additional cooperation in Moscow last week. The Germans
wanted to further accelerate the unification, and Moscow, in
return, wanted a detailed bilateral agreement committing a
single Germany to economic, industrial, scientific and
technological cooperation.</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Genscher wanted the Soviet Union to
agree to a suspension of allied rights over Germany as soon
as the agreement was signed, rather than waiting for the four
countries to ratify the agreement. Mr. Genscher's effort
underlined Bonn's continued concern that unification be made
irreversible as soon as possible.</p>
<p>West Germany and Moscow also have begun working out the
complex details of sensitive agreements regarding the
withdrawal of 363,000 Soviet soldiers in East Germany. And
West Germany has agreed to work out arrangements so that the
Soviets don't suffer economically due to monetary union with
East Germany, which was Moscow's largest import source.</p>
<p>West Germany has already advanced the Soviets five billion
marks ($3.22 billion) in untied loans, it has given it 220
million marks in food aid and agreed to pay 1.25 billion
marks toward the cost of stationing Soviet troops in East
Germany. What's more, Bonn's effort to increase its imports
from Moscow have resulted in a 6% boost in foreign exchange
earnings for the Soviets in the first six months. Meanwhile,
West German exports to the Soviet Union grew by less than 1%.</p>
<p>But the direct line to cash is only part of the story.
Moscow increasingly regards Bonn as its lifeline to Western
economic assistance, international economic organizations
and, in short, to the modern world. It has been reassured of
Mr. Kohl's good intentions by Bonn's willingness to act as
its unofficial emissary to NATO and at the Houston economic
summit.</p>
<p>"The Soviet Union sees a unified Germany as its central
trading partner, as its bridge to Western economic and
financial institutions," says Horst Teltschik, Mr. Kohl's
national security adviser. What's more, Soviet officials have
told their West German counterparts that they pray for their
success in privatizing East Germany because it could serve as
a model for their own efforts and as a weapon against
internal political opponents.</p>
<p>Ironically, it is the same two superpowers that helped
divide and then competed over the fate of divided Germany
that now are helping the country emerge united and robust so
as to satisfy their individual interests. "There will be a
new sort of axis -- although that may sound like a bad word
-- of the Germans, the Soviets and the U.S.," says Karsten
Voigt, a Social Democratic member of West Germany's
parliament. "The long fear that the Soviets could play a
German card is gone. The card is lost when unification is
completed. Now the Soviets want to use us as a card to grow
closer to the West, to the U.S."</p>
<p>The source of the new amity is most likely Realpolitik.
Chancellor Kohl's successful policy of remaining close to
Washington and NATO accomplished two essential goals: It
positions Germany as an attractive and essential partner for
Moscow that can coax the rest of the West. And it frees Bonn
from the accusation that its tie to the East is an ominous
continuation of historical German policies that led to the
Hitler-Stalin agreement and set the stage for World War II.</p>
<p>Many Europeans are understandably fearful when Germany and
Russia warm to each other. But experts believe there is far
less cause for concern this time around. That's because the
rest of Europe was better prepared for Bonn's unilateral
improvement of its relations with Moscow. And Moscow is using
its link to Bonn to avoid being isolated from the other
Western allies.</p>
<p>"There's nothing detrimental to U.S. interests," says
Robert Hormats, a former American official now at Goldman
Sachs in New York. "It is uncomfortable for Washington
because we are accustomed to being the primary interlocutor
for Moscow and Bonn both. . . . But the new order in Europe
is that Germany is the new major economic and political
player. Germany and Moscow are increasingly working out
bilateral arrangements in their interests without consulting
the U.S."</p>
<p>"Gorbachev is trying to influence the alliance through
Kohl," adds Uwe Nehrlich, a security expert at the Institute
for Policy Studies near Munich. "Kohl's power is derivative.
If he had allowed his ties to the U.S. and the alliance to
loosen, his leverage with Gorbachev would be less."</p>
