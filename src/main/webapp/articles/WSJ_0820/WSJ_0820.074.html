	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- From an investor's point of view, Black Box
Inc. would seem to have a thing or two going for it. It
markets computer products, with all the potential pizazz that
implies. It is highly regarded, offering a wide selection of
parts by mail.
   But now, even as Black Box hopes to sell stock to the
public, the company is buckling under the debt of a leveraged
buy-out orchestrated two years ago by New York's Odyssey
Partners and the now-collapsed Drexel Burnham Lambert Group
Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a black hole," says Roger McNamee, manager of T.
Rowe Price Associates' Science & Technology Fund, after
studying disclosure documents for the proposed stock
offering. "Black Box is a great franchise buried in a whole
bunch of financial problems. It's hard to blame anybody
except Drexel and Odyssey," a firm widely regarded as a savvy
investor.</p>
<p>Already in default on one loan, the company originally
planned a recapitalization to meet an Aug. 31 payment
deadline by raising $86 million through public offerings of
stock and convertible debt this month. But the plan, calling
for a 45% fully diluted stake to wind up in public hands, was
postponed two weeks ago as the stock market tumbled. Bankers
last week extended the company's grace period to Oct. 15.</p>
<p>Even if market conditions improve, however, the offering
looks iffy, for prospective investors don't seem to be in any
hurry to bail out a struggling leveraged buy-out. "Their
financial reshaping should be handled in the private realm,"
says Alan Radlo, manager of the $734 million Fidelity OTC
Fund.</p>
<p>Black Box's offering document says the company could end
up in bankruptcy court if the recapitalization isn't
completed within a reasonable period.</p>
<p>Some large investors were strongly advised by Standard &
Poor's analyst Mark Basham to avoid the offering, which had
an indicated price range of $12 to $14 a share for 4.5
million shares. "This is the dying gasp of a patient on the
operating table," says Mr. Basham. "I wouldn't find it
attractive at any price."</p>
<p>Mr. McNamee isn't so sure. Tangled up in the "financial
mess" created by the LBO, he says, is a high-quality
cataloger and provider of computer equipment. The company has
a loyal following among professionals in charge of computer
systems at the nation's largest corporate offices, as well as
government and educational complexes.</p>
<p>With 627 employees, Black Box publishes four catalogs of
computer products that in the year ended March 31 had a total
circulation of 4.5 million. It sells its own line of
equipment, including modems, cables, printer interfaces and
other computer parts, as well as other manufacturers'
products. With subsidiaries in Canada and Britain, it has an
international distribution network. The company is in the
process of moving its headquarters from Simi Valley, Calif.,
to its main facility in a Pittsburgh suburb.</p>
<p>Black Box's franchise as the nation's leader in direct
marketing of computer products "could excite the public," Mr.
McNamee suggests. A shareholder of Black Box's predecessor
Micom Systems, Mr. McNamee says his fund "made a ton of
money" from that stock until its telecommunications equipment
business slowed in the mid-1980s. Now, he says, the catalog
business has developed into a secure and promising business.</p>
<p>However, Mr. McNamee emphasizes that public investors
shouldn't have to undo the debt Black Box incurred two years
ago by "the unrealistic assumptions" of the LBO investors.
"It's obvious the original LBO was structurally flawed," he
says.</p>
<p>Indeed, the $334 million, $16-a-share, buy-out of what was
then known as Micom Systems was heavily reliant on debt. As
part of the debt financing, a $138 million revolving credit
loan was provided by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. The
company issued $110 million in senior subordinated
increasing-rate notes, which carried a rate of 16.19% as of
March 31. An additional $34 million came from selling various
preferred shares.</p>
<p>Despite the sale of three subsidiaries, Black Box owed the
revolving credit line $80.5 million as of July 1. It also
owed the entire $110 million in notes. The company already
has defaulted on the revolving credit; on June 15, it missed
an interest payment on the notes.</p>
<p>Annual revenue growth of at least 15% in the past three
years wasn't enough to offset the debt-service requirements.
Black Box's revenue grew to $107 million for fiscal 1990 from
$53.2 million four years earlier. However, at the same time
its interest expense jumped to $26.7 million from $134,000.
The company reported a loss applicable to common stock of
$33.9 million for the year, compared with profit of $5
million four years earlier.</p>
<p>Black Box also says it has been hamstrung by the weakening
performance of Micom Communications Corp., a subsidiary that
makes low-cost data communications devices. That subsidiary
will be spun off to Odyssey Partners under the planned
recapitalization.</p>
<p>In addition to the stock offering, the recapitalization
also calls for a concurrent offering of $35 million of
convertible debt, the buy-back of most of the notes and new
bank financing. Alex. Brown & Sons is the lead underwriter of
the offering.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Black Box (who also is a spokesman for
Odyssey), says the company was confident the IPO would be
successful before the stock market tumbled in early August.
While keeping an eye on the troubled market for signs of
improvement, Black Box will be looking for alternatives to a
public offering to satisfy the bankers and creditors, he
says. "They're nimble and creative. They'll come up with a
response."</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Over-the-counter stocks tumbled ahead of another weekend
of uncertainty about the Middle East.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 8.78, or 2.2%, Friday
to 393.49, its lowest level since mid-January 1989. Since its
peak of 485.73 last October, the index has fallen nearly 20%.</p>
<p>Trading picked up, as 146.9 million shares changed hands,
up from 114.9 million Thursday. Declining stocks swamped
advancers, 1,616 to 522.</p>
<p>Forschner Group slid 1 3/4 to 6 1/4 after the Shelton,
Conn., marketer of cutlery such as, Swiss Army knives, said
its 1990 earnings could be "substantially" below year-earlier
profit of 75 cents a share. Forschner cited the continued
weakness of the dollar against the Swiss franc. Meanwhile,
Boston-based FMR disclosed that it holds an 11.5% stake in
Forschner.</p>
<p>Among the OTC gainers, Cisco Systems added 1 1/2 to 24 3/4
after the maker of computer network products reported that
net income for its fourth quarter, ended July 29, more than
doubled to 30 cents a share from 12 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Biomet rose 1/2 to 30 after Standard & Poor's said it is
adding the Warsaw, Ind., maker of surgical implant devices to
its index of America's 500 largest public companies. Stocks
normally benefit from a wave of buying when they are added to
the index, as funds based on the S&P 500 buy the stock.</p>
<p>Among OTC energy stocks, Noble Drilling rose 1/2 to 10
1/2, Hamilton Oil gained 3/8 to 40 1/8, DeKalb Energy Class B
shares advanced 1/4 to 28 3/4 and McFarland Energy added 1/8
to 10 5/8.</p>
