	<p class="article-leader">Karen Elliott House will find few to disagree with her
suggestion of "No Appeasement of Iraq" (editorial page, Aug.
7). However, it is difficult to see how her reasoning or
prescriptions would contribute to peace and stability.
   In justifying unilateral military action, she suggests the
U.S. has "simply to pursue its own interest -- the free flow
of oil at acceptable prices." Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait
largely to ensure his definition of appropriate price and
supply levels for oil, as he defines them. How can we
distinguish U.S. military action in service of our definition
of appropriate price and supply levels from Saddam Hussein's?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Surely, the more important reason for resisting Saddam's
aggression is that it threatens the region with instability,
and creates yet another dangerous precedent of a violation of
sovereignty. It therefore makes sense to resist it in a
manner that preserves, and if possible promotes, the values
sought to be vindicated. A unilateral U.S. military response
would galvanize Arab nationalist sentiment into a relatively
neutral posture, an unstable prospect. A multilateral
response, which Ms. House scoffs at, would allow for the
development of a regional consensus around the shared
interest in resisting Iraqi domination. It also would enjoy
legitimacy as a reflection of the world community's interest
in world order, rather than being perceived as one
superpower's unilateral pursuit of its economic interests.</p>

<p>For a number of years, I've enjoyed Ms. House's insightful
articles on the Middle East. This one continues her
excellence. The phrase "superpower amity has little effect on
regional enmity" should be copyrighted.</p>
<p>Her article, coupled with the one of Messrs. Jeffrey
Birnbaum and Andrew Pasztor in the same issue, should be read
at the National Security Council and other agencies. It is
hoped that there will be collaboration with the U.S.S.R. What
an opportunity if Soviet naval units could enforce the
blockade at Iskenderun.</p>

<p>Ms. House was breathtaking in her ability to get to the
heart of our country's Middle Eastern quandary. Years of
waffling and positioning have left the U.S. in a serious bind
with little room to maneuver.</p>
<p>Might I suggest you consider reprinting several thousand
copies of Ms. House's article and delivering them to our
policy makers in Foggy Bottom, Capitol Hill and the White
House?</p>

<p>Ms. House's comments raise more questions than they
answer. Where does "military intervention" stop short of
total occupation of the Arab world? You can't just punch the
bully once and stop the fight.</p>
<p>If the U.S. intervenes, is Ms. House volunteering as an
infantry rifleperson, or are we to send "them" to fight and
be killed? How does the cost in U.S. lives and dollars
compare with the increased cost of oil? If we had not let the
Luddites in our midst scare us away from clean nuclear power
we wouldn't be so vulnerable now.</p>

<p>When Israel bombed Iraq's nuclear facilities in 1981,
seriously forestalling Hussein's quest for nuclear
capability, the act was condemned around the world, and
Israel's warning that Hussein would use every means possible
to threaten other nations was rejected.</p>
<p>Now, it's clear Israel's foreboding was right on the
money. Imagine a Hussein with a nuclear arsenal. It's a scary
thought. But we don't have to face that scenario, for now at
least, thanks to Israel.</p>

<p>It's hard to believe Ms. House argues for using the U.S.
military to enforce an "acceptable" price for oil. Troops
should be used to protect freedom, not to extract price
concessions from trading partners.</p>
<p>Far better to develop an alternate supply. There is reason
to believe research into high-technology areas such as laser
fusion or even biotechnology could yield a significant
discovery within three years.</p>

<p>Wow] To use a British expression, Ms. House is wonderfully
"bloodyminded," with phrases such as "dictator took control .
. . of the West's economic destiny in the 1990s." Really?
Then she comments about Hussein's "ability to dictate world
oil prices." How? Then she says our efforts are "too little,
too late." All in three paragraphs.</p>
<p>Then Ms. House also decries our healthy aversion to
bloodshed, ignoring the fact that healthy aversion also
exists among the young people of Iraq, especially those who
fought in the war with Iran (one of three being a woman
toward the end). She ignores economic history, too -- that at
one time Saudi Arabia was producing 12 million barrels a day,
and so was the Soviet Union, and that since that time,
Western consumption has dropped dramatically, and other
sources of crude have risen dramatically. Saudi Arabia still
can produce 12 million barrels a day, and the Soviet Union
can make almost half that amount available for hard currency.</p>
<p>This administration's careful building of political and
economic blocks to put a real wall around Iraq, backed by a
real military wall, has been strategically adept. But we
cannot stimulate Hussein's imagination to understand in
advance the result of a B-52 bombing raid on Iraq's principal
cities, nor can we pre-demonstrate the devastating effect of
our jet fighters on his old Soviet tanks, which are required
to stop in order to fire, and whose diesel tanks sit exposed
behind the turret. Unfortunately, he and, sadly, some of his
people, may have to find this out the hard way. But many
people will resent Ms. House's rush to this gory undertaking,
and will admire President Bush and his colleagues for their
restrained patience.</p>

<p>Iraq's brutal occupation of Kuwait dramatically and
ominously points up another unwanted legacy of the Reagan
administration, which dismantled or disregarded many of the
energy-conservation programs intended to reduce the need for
petroleum after the oil crises in 1973-74 and 1979.</p>
<p>His administration cut billions of dollars from the
planned spending on crude oil for the strategic petroleum
reserve; it eased the government's fuel-efficiency
requirements for new cars; it cut back a variety of programs
intended to encourage conservation and development of
alternative energy sources such as solar power; it failed to
take the necessary leadership in 1986 urging the adoption of
a fuel tax.</p>

<p>My initial reaction is to say, "Thank you Saddam Hussein."
This brutal megalomaniac may have done the U.S. a big favor
in the following areas:</p>
<p>1. Reminding Congress that we cannot take all of the
budget cuts from defense.</p>
<p>2. Reminding Congress that we need our defense reductions
made with world strategy in mind and not the pork barrel.</p>
<p>3. Reminding us that we still need to project forces on a
world-wide basis.</p>

<p>The Bush administration's outrage at Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait loses its moral force when it is remembered that just
a few months ago President Bush ordered the invasion of
Panama, and a few years ago the Reagan-Bush administration
ordered the invasion of Grenada. Iraq has used the Panama
rationale of replacing a corrupt leader.</p>
<p>International lawfulness cannot be advanced when
superpowers set a tone of acting as they please. The
superpowers must show the way by practicing a respect for
international law and for the sovereignty of nations and by
working to strengthen international organizations like the
United Nations and the World Court.</p>

<p>Ms. House says it without obfuscation: We will conduct war
for the "free flow of oil at tolerable prices." Before we
send our young men to kill and die there, full disclosure is
in order so that mothers and fathers who get visits from a
major will know why their sons died. That was not a luxury
given the parents of the 58,000 dead in Vietnam.</p>
<p>The analogy of Kuwait and Munich limps badly. Saudi
Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, the Arab Emirates and Oman were the
creations of England and France for their own economic and
strategic reasons in the early part of this century. They
established as these countries' leaders sheik families who
rule with little or no respect for democracy or human rights.
They are in power through the corruption of vast wealth
shared by few Arabs in that part of the world. American
policy makers know this but continue to use the sheiks for
their own strategic purposes.</p>
<p>The average Arab knows the U.S. is the enemy of his land,
his resources and his religion. The West uses this part of
the world for its own purposes, starting with the forcing of
its foreign surrogate, Israel, onto Arab soil.</p>
<p>All the talk about Iraq establishing a "puppet" government
in Kuwait may not be true. There are more than 100,000
Palestinians there who were treated as serfs with no rights.
And many Kuwaitis may be pleased at the expulsion of a vain
and corrupt family of sheiks.</p>
<p>Here is a suggested headstone for the U.S. servicemen who
may die in Arab countries:</p>
<p>Here lies PFC Harvey Anybody</p>
<p>Killed in action on the U.S. Enterprise in the Persian
Gulf</p>
<p>He died courageously for his country's</p>
<p>Free flow of oil at reasonable prices</p>
