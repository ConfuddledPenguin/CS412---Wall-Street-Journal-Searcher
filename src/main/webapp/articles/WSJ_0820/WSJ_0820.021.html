	<p class="article-leader">DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. said it will extend the
shutdown of its Dearborn, Mich., assembly plant through this
week.
   The auto maker said the move was "necessitated by a parts
shortage." Ford idled the plant last week because of weak
demand for the Ford Mustang cars built there.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The extra week of no production will result in 3,700 fewer
Mustangs for the company and affect about 2,100 hourly
workers.</p>
