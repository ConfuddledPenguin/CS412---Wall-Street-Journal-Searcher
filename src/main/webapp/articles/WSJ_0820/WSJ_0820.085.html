	<p class="article-leader">BUDAPEST, Hungary -- Peter Molnar, 26 years old, is a
fresh-faced, fair-haired student who lives at home with his
mother. He's also an important member of the Hungarian
parliament.
   "This is a bit difficult to believe," he admits during a
break in the parliamentary proceedings, to which he has worn
blue jeans and an open-collar shirt. "I should be taking my
exams just right now."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>His defiant generation helped lead the charge through the
streets of Eastern Europe last year toppling politically
bankrupt Communist regimes. But last spring, Hungarian
students made their impact through a quieter, more
traditional sort of revolution -- an election.</p>
<p>The Federation for Young Democrats won 22 of 366
parliamentary seats in March's national legislative
elections, and a spot in the next Guinness Book of World
Records. (Fidesz is the only political party with an age
limit, 35, in a freely elected parliament.) And since the
election, its deputies have impressed observers by providing
the sharpest opposition to Hungary's ruling center-right
coalition.</p>
<p>`The youngsters are real pros," says Andras Banki, deputy
editor in chief of the Budapest daily Magyar Nemzet. "The
government talks in vague generalities. Fidesz spells out the
specifics."</p>
<p>Fidesz also has injected another invaluable element into
Hungary's budding democracy: humor. The youths, who prefer
jeans and long hair to suits and ties, judged the inaugural
session stiff and boring. So, at the following session they
placed an orange on each deputy's desk. "Orange is our
color," explains Mr. Molnar, pointing to an orange button
pinned to his shirt. "It's fresh and invigorating."</p>
<p>When the first deputy rose to speak, his orange provoked
giggles by rolling off his desk. A second deputy began to
intone, only to be interrupted by the screech of buzzers.</p>
<p>"What is going on?," demanded the parliamentary president.</p>
<p>"It's only the oranges," responded Fidesz leader Viktor
Orban. "They hit the buzzers."</p>
<p>"We all try to be so serious and then these youngsters
come along," complains Balint Magyar, 38, a deputy from the
Free Democratic Party. "They shout, they applaud, they beat
their desks."</p>
<p>Of course, Hungary isn't the only country with exasperated
adults. Lech Walesa, father of Poland's Solidarity trade
union movement, has complained often about the radicalism of
his younger followers. "The young are always more simple and
direct in their way of expressing themselves," Mr. Walesa
says. "They say, `Oh, this old man speaks too much.'"</p>
<p>For Fidesz, however, being "simple and direct" has proved
effective. The group was founded by law students in 1988 as
an alternative to the Communist Youth League. Its members
quickly built a radical platform on such issues as
environmental protection, the right to refuse military
service as a conscientious objector, and the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Hungary. Veteran Hungarian opposition
groups at the time avoided the sensitive issue of Soviet
troops.</p>
<p>There always was a humorous side to Fidesz's radicalism.
The group mimicked the "happenings" of a Polish dissident
youth group named Orange Alternative, staging events such as
a birthday party for Stalin at the Budapest zoo. The youths
wore red, waved flags with Bolshevik slogans and sang
Stalinist hymns in front of the chimpanzee cage.</p>
<p>Satiric at times, the pranksters are deadly serious about
their ideals. While most politicians still were temporizing
in 1988 and 1989 about the need for a "middle road" between
capitalism and communism, Fidesz stood with those who
demanded pure Western-style democracy. "Democracy works in
Western Europe and the United States," Mr. Molnar said at the
time. "Why shouldn't it work here?"</p>
<p>Such ideas were not appreciated by the Communist
authorities, who responded to Fidesz's founding by declaring
the group illegal and threatening to expel its leaders from
the university and imprison them. But the students stood
their ground, and the authorities backed down. Within a few
months, Fidesz had attracted more than 2,000 members, and
within a year it had about 10,000. That apparently was enough
to impress President Bush, who insisted on meeting Mr. Molnar
and his friends when he visited Budapest last summer.</p>
<p>Then, in January, in a decision that initially divided the
movement, Fidesz turned itself into a political party,
announcing it would post candidates for the March elections.
"We feared that everyone would laugh at us," Mr. Molnar
admits. "I myself hesitated for a long time between running
or continuing my studies."</p>
<p>But once the decision had been made, the group devised a
clever, courageous campaign. Their slogan was "Listen to your
heart and vote for Fidesz." They plastered the country with
posters showing, on top, the late Soviet leader Leonid
Brezhnev embracing former East German leader Erich Honecker
and, below, a young couple kissing. The caption read: "Who
would you choose?"</p>
<p>"The campaign was so serious, so heavy," Mr. Orban
recalls. "We loosened up the style."</p>
<p>On election day, Fidesz found support among young and old
voters. Television showed Hungary's oldest citizen, a
106-year-old woman, casting her ballot for Fidesz.</p>
<p>"They won because they are so cute," says Agnes Major, who
soon will be a grandmother. "All mothers would want to have
them as their children."</p>
<p>When the ballots were counted in the first round, Fidesz
had won 9% of the vote, just less than the Communists' 10%.
The most votes went to Democratic Forum, which took 25%, just
ahead of the Free Democrats with 21%. In a startling result
in one district, Fidesz candidate Jozsef Szajer finished more
than 10 percentage points ahead of Communist leader Imre
Pozsgay. The district was won by a Democratic Forum
candidate, however. "I underestimated them," Mr. Pozsgay says
of Fidesz. "They were very well-prepared young men, strong
opponents."</p>
<p>In parliament, Fidesz deputies have shown they can be
effective. When the governing Democratic Forum struck a deal
with the Free Democrats to rewrite the constitution and elect
Arpad Gompac as president, Fidesz deputies led the
opposition, proposing 19 amendments and asking pointed
questions that suggested the democratic process was being
subverted. More than a dozen of their amendments were
eventually accepted, including one that enshrined property
ownership as a "natural human right." "We got the idea from
Jefferson," says Mr. Orban.</p>
<p>"They embarrassed us," says Janos Kis, leader of the Free
Democrats. "As a bigger party, we have to show more
responsibility, and as a smaller party, they are freer to
criticize."</p>
<p>Indeed, when Prime Minister Jozef Antall presented his new
government to parliament as a "government of national
renewal," Fidesz's Mr. Orban again stepped up and objected.
He asked why the government hadn't announced any serious plan
for dealing with the deteriorating economy.</p>
<p>"It's not a government of national renewal," he told his
fellow legislators. "It's a government of national
say-nothing."</p>
<p>"They're so bright," moans an admiring Mr. Kis. "They
attack the government in a tough, sarcastic way."</p>
<p>The party has even challenged press magnates Rupert
Murdoch and Robert Maxwell, who each have taken control of a
newspaper in Budapest, and West German media giant Axel
Springer AG, which has taken over six provincial newspapers.
As a result of the takeovers, Fidesz forced the creation of a
parliamentary commission to investigate purchases of
Hungarian newspapers by foreigners. The commission already
has blocked the purchase of one Budapest paper. "We're going
to stop these shenanigans," says Mr. Molnar, who represents
Fidesz on the committee. "A new law is needed to regulate
press takeovers."</p>
<p>But as he debates the fate of multimillion-dollar
takeovers, Mr. Molnar has another pressing challenge: finding
an apartment. Budapest has a terrible shortage of housing. Of
Fidesz's 22 deputies, ranging in age from 23 to 33, six still
are enrolled in college and seven live at home.</p>
<p>"Now that I'm a deputy," Mr. Molnar says, "it's becoming
harder to live with my mom."</p>
