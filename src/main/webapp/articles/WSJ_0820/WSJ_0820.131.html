	<h3>Heard on the Street: Weaker Dollar Is Helping Some U.S. Companies</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The slumping dollar is boosting the case for
stocks of U.S. companies that do a lot of business overseas.
   When Iraq invaded Kuwait, investors fled to the dollar as
a safe haven, causing the U.S. currency to soar briefly. But
now the dollar is declining again, bolstering the
foreign-exposure theory that began gaining favor on Wall
Street earlier this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That theory has two pillars. Foreign economies are growing
more quickly than that of the U.S., which limps along at a
1.2% annual pace. And the dollar's weakness is beneficial
because it gives U.S. exporters a price advantage against
foreign competition, while also making foreign profits fatter
when translated into dollars. All of which is good for the
stocks of companies with major foreign involvement, be they
U.S.-based exporters or multinationals with subsidiaries
abroad.</p>
<p>The dollar has retreated so fast that last week it tumbled
to three successive postwar lows against the German mark.
Since the invasion-inspired peak, the U.S. currency is down
about 4.5% against the mark and British pound and nearly 3%
against the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Sure, analysts say, higher oil prices could slow the
economies of Japan, West Germany and various European
countries. But those countries are starting off with much
faster growth than the U.S. And the damage from an oil price
rise to Japan and Europe, which are more dependent on foreign
oil than the U.S., may not be as great as some fear. "Japan
has become extremely oil-efficient," says William P.
Sterling, international economist for Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>He thinks rising oil prices may force Germany and Japan to
raise interest rates to keep inflation from getting out of
hand. As the U.S. economy is in a fragile state, the Federal
Reserve Board is unlikely to foster similar interest-rate
increases here. As a result, Mr. Sterling figures, the dollar
could easily fall in coming months, for higher interest rates
abroad tend to reduce the dollar's allure to international
investors and speculators.</p>
<p>And so money managers may well continue to snap up shares
of companies such as General Electric, Corning Glass and
International Business Machines, which get a large percentage
of their sales and earnings abroad.</p>
<p>For American companies, "the growth is perceived to be
overseas," says Jeff Landle, a portfolio manager at
Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers in New York. "The U.S. economy
is certainly not in the near future expected to exhibit any
great growth spurt. So the idea of companies with large
foreign exposure makes a lot of sense."</p>
<p>Three that Mr. Landle likes are GE, IBM and Dow Chemical.
Besides being big exporters, he says, all three have
production and distribution facilities in place in many
countries. That advantage is important, he says, because
trade barriers are falling fast within regions (such as
Europe or North America) but not between regions.</p>
<p>Jack Orben, chairman of Associated Family Services, a New
York money management firm, praises International Flavors &
Fragrances and Gillette for management savvy in understanding
foreign markets. "They are tuned in to the changing political
situation in various countries," he says.</p>
<p>"The U.S. is a shrinking portion of demand in many
industries," says Remy Fisher, a vice president of J.& W.
Seligman & Co. in New York. Foreign exposure is one attribute
she typically looks for in a stock. Among her favorites are
GE and Corning Glass, each of which derives at least 40% of
sales and earnings abroad. GE, she says, historically has
been good at channeling capital spending to where the growth
is going to be, a couple of years in advance. Recently, she
says, GE has been pushing capital spending in Europe.</p>
<p>Fluor, an engineering and construction company, has heavy
orders from Germany, France and Hungary, Ms. Fisher says.
About 40% of the firm's backlog now comes from abroad,
compared with 20% only a year ago.</p>
<p>Gerald Perritt, a Chicago money manager who usually
emphasizes smaller companies, says that having operations
abroad is often a sign of foresight and sophistication on the
part of a small, growing business. Three stocks of small
companies active in Europe that he owns are Porta Systems,
which makes electrical surge-protection equipment for
telecommunications systems; Vishay Intertechnology, an
electronics concern that recently expanded into England
through an acquisition, and Air Express International, a
freight forwarding firm.</p>
<p>The dollar is giving such companies a hand in their
foreign operations. Since year end, the dollar has fallen 16%
against the pound and more than 8% against the mark. The U.S.
currency could decline by an additional 5% to 10%, says
Nicholas P. Sargen, an international economist at Salomon
Brothers. But he warns that investors shouldn't expect it to
fall out of bed.</p>
<p>Of course, some people are skeptical of the thesis that
foreign exposure is a basis on which to pick stocks.</p>
<p>"It sounds like a lot of baloney to me," says Don
Mitchell, chairman of Mitchell & Co., a Weston, Mass.,
consulting firm. Foreign economies have been growing faster
than the U.S.'s "for a long time now," he says, so this
particular theme may be played out. "To the extent there's
anything new, it's the dying-dollar story," Mr. Mitchell
says. But, "There are two things that nobody predicts worth a
darn. One is interest rates and the other is currency."</p>
<p>Besides, Mr. Mitchell asks, "If it's so wonderful to be
abroad, why buy U.S. stocks? Why not just buy foreign
stocks?" Proponents of U.S. exporters and multinationals
reply that these stocks are relatively easy to research, and
would benefit further if the dollar continues to fall. Also,
rising interest rates in countries such as Germany or Japan
could pull those countries' entire stock markets lower.</p>
<p>James H. Morgan, president of Morgan Investments in
Greenville, S.C., says foreign exposure shouldn't be the main
factor in stock selection. "If the dollar weakens enough to
help on {the trade} front, it would create other problems"
such as higher U.S. interest rates, he says. More important,
he says, is a company's ability to withstand an economic
slowdown.</p>
<p>Randall Eley, president of Edgar Lomax Co. in Alexandria,
Va., expects a "world-wide slowdown" in economic activity. So
he's looking for companies with "low P/Es {ratios of stock
prices to annual per-share earnings}, great financial
strength, very little debt." Still, he is hoping a falling
dollar will give a boost to his firm's holding in Dow
Chemical, which has been a laggard.</p>
<p>There's one very big risk in the foreign exposure thesis.
If Mideast saber-rattling evolves into a full-fledged war and
major oil facilities are blown up, all bets are off. Europe
and Japan can cope with higher oil prices but their economies
could grind to a halt if acute shortages develop. And in a
hot war the dollar could skyrocket.</p>
