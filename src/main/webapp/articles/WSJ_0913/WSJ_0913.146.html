	<p class="article-leader">LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Valley Capital Corp.'s Valley Bank unit
said it would continue charging a $1 surcharge on 100 of its
automated teller machines around the state after a federal
appellate court ruled againt a challenge by Plus System.
   The surcharge, levied to ATM customers mostly at machines
in casinos, is unique to Nevada, which passed a law last year
making it unlawful for bank card networks to dictate whether
banks could use the surcharge. Denver-based Plus System Inc.
challenged the constitutionality of that law, which a federal
appeals court upheld.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Valley Bank had sued Plus System on antitrust grounds
because Plus System refused to cooperate on the surcharge for
its customers. Valley Bank's gross revenue on the surcharge
is about $200,000 a month, according to Jon Joseph, executive
vice president and general counsel. A Valley spokesman said
he expected more Nevada banks to follow suit.</p>
<p>Plus System attorneys couldn't be reached, and it wasn't
known if they would appeal. The bank-card network is owned by
a group of banks and Visa International Inc.</p>
