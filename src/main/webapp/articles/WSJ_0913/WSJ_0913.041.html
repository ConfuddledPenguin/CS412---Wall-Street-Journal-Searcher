	<p class="article-leader">EDMONTON, Alberta -- The Alberta government said it
expects to raise 951 million Canadian dollars (US$819.1
million) from an initial public offering of shares of Telus
Corp., the new holding company that owns Alberta's big
telephone utility.
   Alberta telecommunications minister Fred Stewart said the
C$12-a-share issue is the largest equity offering ever in
Canada. He added the offering has drawn "overwhelming"
interest in Alberta, where investors can buy Telus shares for
C$6 each, and pay the balance next September.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since investor demand in Alberta exceeded the issue's size
by about C$450 million, Mr. Stewart said the government has
had to limit the number of shares that can be purchased on
the two-part installment plan to a maximum of 900 per
investor.</p>
<p>Demand for the offering, which is expected to be completed
by Sept. 28, has proven a windfall for the issue's 11-member
underwriting group, led by RBC Dominion Securities Inc. of
Toronto. With trading volumes down sharply this year in
Canada and many securities dealers posting operating losses,
the estimated 3.7% average underwriting and selling
commission earned by dealers on the issue has offered some
welcome relief.</p>
<p>"It has been a very good issue for us," said Tony Melvyn,
a broker in the Edmonton office of Levesque Beaubien
Geoffrion Inc., a securities dealer based in Toronto.</p>
<p>The offering of more than 79.3 million Telus shares,
representing a 60% stake in the company, has also drawn heavy
interest from the 11,500 eligible employees of Alberta
Government Telephones, Telus's main subsidiary. About 84% of
the big utility's staff subscribed to the issue, Mr. Stewart
said.</p>
<p>As previously reported, the Alberta government first
announced in May its plans to privatize Alberta Government
Telephones, which is Canada's third largest
telecommunications concern with assets of about C$2.8 billion
and 1989 revenue of C$1.2 billion.</p>
<p>The government intends to retain the remaining 40% stake
in Telus for at least a year.</p>
