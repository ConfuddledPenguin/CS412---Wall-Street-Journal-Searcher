	<h3>Worse Yet, Surgeons Might Start Doing Things With Pizza Cutters</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">When piping-hot pizzas were wheeled in to the emergency
rooms of two public hospitals in Houston recently, nurses and
orderlies naturally wondered who the good Samaritan was.
   The answer was easy as pie to find: There, along with the
oozy cheese and gooey goodies, was the business card of Reid
McInvale, attorney at law.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Why was Mr. McInvale, who handles his share of
personal-injury cases, donating pizzas to local hospital
workers?</p>
<p>Simple, says Mr. McInvale. He had been reading the other
day about what a tough job hospital orderlies have. So, on
the spur of the moment, he decided to have a batch of pizzas
delivered to the two emergency rooms. He kept up the
deliveries several nights running, as a "minor token of
gratitude for some of the lowest paid, most overworked and
most dedicated workers in Houston."</p>
<p>Harris County hospital officials were far from grateful,
however -- especially considering that Mr. McInvale sent
along his business card. ("You have to let the people know
it's not some serial killer sending the pizzas," he
explains.) The officials, suspecting that he was shopping for
leads to personal-injury cases -- Mr. McInvale denies he was
doing so -- asked county prosecutors to stop the deliveries.</p>
<p>Dori Wind, an assistant county attorney, says she simply
asked Mr. McInvale "not to send any more pizzas." He
complied, but isn't happy about it.</p>
<p>Mr. McInvale says he was told the pizza ban stemmed from a
hospital-district policy that bars hospital employees from
accepting gifts, and that any employees caught eating his
pizza would be fired or disciplined. Mr. McInvale calls this
policy hypocritical, considering how many freebies doctors
get from pharmaceutical companies. And he threatens to bring
a $100 million lawsuit against anyone who fires an orderly
for eating his pizzas.</p>
<p>Larry Fitzgerald, a spokesman for the State Bar of Texas,
says lawyers are barred by ethical rules from soliciting
lawsuits, but he doesn't know whether pizza deliveries would
be covered: "This is the first pizza solicitation call I've
had."</p>
<p>For her part, Ms. Wind says that when she asked Mr.
McInvale to halt the pizza deliveries, she didn't indicate
that anyone would be fired.</p>
<p>"I just told him it was inappropriate," says Ms. Wind.
"You really can't be eating pizzas in the emergency room --
it would be unsanitary."</p>
