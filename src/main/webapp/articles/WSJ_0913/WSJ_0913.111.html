	<p class="article-leader">AUSTIN, Texas -- The Texas Supreme Court ruled that the
state's public utility commission doesn't have authority to
reconsider some $600 million in nuclear plant construction
cost overruns in setting the electric power rates of Gulf
States Utilities Co.
   The court confirmed an earlier lower court ruling that
once the commission set aside those costs in a 1988 rate
case, it couldn't take them up again in a later one. The
costs were presented again in a different format in a 1989
Gulf States rate case; the utility said the commission had
instructed it to resubmit the costs in that case with better
justification.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ruling didn't disallow the construction costs or rule
on the merits of the original commission decision to set them
aside. It only confirmed a lower court ruling that said by
giving the utility "a second opportunity to prove the same
facts," the public utility commission incorrectly rejected a
hearing examiner's conclusion.</p>
<p>The costs at issue are part of the New Orleans-based
utility's $3.1 billion investment in the River Bend nuclear
plant in Louisiana. About $1.4 billion of that has been
challenged as not prudent expenditures. The portion of the
overruns considered by Texas regulators amounted to about
$600 million. The remainder applied to the utility's rates in
Louisiana; regulators there have disallowed that portion and
the company is appealing the decision.</p>
<p>Gulf States said it will seek a rehearing from the Texas
Supreme Court. If that fails, it said it would consider
appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. It also said it would
press pending litigation that it brought against the Texas
commission in 1988, challenging on its merits the agency's
original decision to set aside the costs.</p>
<p>The utility reiterated previous statements that if all
efforts to have the $1.4 billion considered in its cost
structure fail, it would be forced to take after-tax
write-offs of up to $600 million.</p>
