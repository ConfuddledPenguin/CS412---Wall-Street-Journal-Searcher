	<p class="article-leader">Maxwell Communications Corp. PLC is planning to sell some
assets and may renegotiate the terms of its recent agreement
to buy three U.S. supermarket tabloids.
   In London, Robert Maxwell, chairman, told Maxwell
Communications' annual meeting that the company is in talks
to sell some of its "non-strategic businesses." He said
"negotiations are well advanced in a number of transactions
which we expect to complete very shortly" but declined to be
any more specific.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, executives of Globe International Publishing
Inc. of Montreal confirmed that Maxwell's plans to buy three
of its supermarket tabloids have been delayed. In May,
Maxwell announced plans to acquire the Globe, National
Examiner and Sun from Globe International for an estimated
$100 million. The tabloids would make Mr. Maxwell an instant
powerhouse at lucrative supermarket checkout stands.</p>
<p>Peter Rubenovitch, Globe's chief financial officer,
wouldn't comment on negotiations, except to say they are
continuing. "Yes, the timetable has changed," said Mr.
Rubenovitch. "We planned to close within a month or two, but
that was too ambitious." Although he declined to elaborate,
Mr. Maxwell is said to have missed two closing deadlines. He
is also attempting to renegotiate the purchase price to below
$100 million, according to people familiar with the talks.</p>
<p>At the annual meeting in London, Mr. Maxwell said his
company would repay about $400 million in short-term debt by
Oct. 23. "We do not enjoy being a highly leveraged business,"
Mr. Maxwell said. The company is "determined" to bring down
its level of debt as quickly as possible. Maxwell shares
closed up a penny at 167 pence on the London Stock Exchange.
Mr. Maxwell and other company officials couldn't be reached
after the meeting.</p>
<p>Globe executives said Mr. Maxwell recently visited the
Globe's publication headquarters in Boca Raton, Fla., where
Globe executives expected to finalize the transaction.
Instead, they said, Mr. Maxwell said he needed to knock down
the price.</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell, through his privately held Mirror Group PLC,
publishes the London Daily Mirror, the second-largest
newspaper in Britain, and recently launched the European, an
English-language newspaper for Europe.</p>
<p>His biggest U.S. acquisition to date was the $2.6 billion
purchase in 1988 of Macmillan Inc. Mr. Maxwell has hinted at
more U.S. acquisitions without giving details. In June, at
the annual meeting of one of his companies, Berlitz
International Inc., in New York, Mr. Maxwell said he was
negotiating to purchase a U.S. newspaper. He said that he was
"interested" in Tribune Co.'s high-circulation but marginally
profitable New York Daily News but that no negotiations had
been held. The Chicago Sun-Times was also rumored as a
possible target, but its owners denied negotiating with Mr.
Maxwell.</p>
