	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Banks can stop borrowers' ability to tap
into home-equity lines of credit, the Federal Reserve said,
if the fluctuating interest rate paid by the borrower hits
the cap specified in the loan agreement.
   The amended regulation stems from a 1989 lawsuit filed by
Consumers Union, which challenged the Fed regulation as a
violation of the Home Equity Act.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The law prohibited lenders from changing the terms of a
home-equity loan after the account had been opened. But the
Fed added an exemption, which allows the banks to stop
disbursing funds if an interest-rate cap is reached and those
terms are spelled out in the lending agreement.</p>
<p>"Under this regulation, the consumer can't borrow money he
expected to under his line of credit," said Michelle Meier,
counsel for government affairs for Consumers Union. "He will
have to go another lender at a higher interest rate."</p>
<p>The U.S. District Court here dismissed the suit in May,
saying that the Fed has broad authority to rule on such
matters. Consumers Union said it will appeal. As of 1988,
about $75 billion in home-equity loans were outstanding, Ms.
Meier said.</p>
