	<p class="article-leader">From a speech by Margaret Thatcher to the Aspen
Institute's 40th anniversary conference on Aug. 5:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>{W}e must bring the new democracies of Eastern Europe into
closer association with the insitutions of Western Europe.
And I propose that the Community should declare unequivocally
that it is ready to accept all the countries of Eastern
Europe as members if they want to join, provided that
democracy has taken root and that their economies are capable
of sustaining membership. We cannot say in one breath that
they are part of Europe and in the next our European
Community Club is so exclusive that we will not admit them. .
. .</p>
<p>This does not mean that the further development of the
existing Community has to be put on ice. Far from it. . . .
But if . . . we set off down the path of giving more and more
powers to highly centralised institutions, which are not
democratically accountable, then we should be making it
harder for the Eastern Europeans to join.</p>
<p>They have not thrown off central command and control in
their own countries only to find them reincarnated in the
European Community.</p>
