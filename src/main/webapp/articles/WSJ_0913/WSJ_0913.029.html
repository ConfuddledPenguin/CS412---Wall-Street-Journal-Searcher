FUND, Omaha, Neb., said units of record Sept. 30 will receive
a special distribution of $2 a unit, payable Oct. 31. The
special payout represents "approximately two-thirds of the
HUD {Department of Housing and Urban Development} insurance
proceeds" from the assignment of the mortgage on Casa
Sandoval, a "senior living center" in Hayward, Calif. Because
the distribution will reduce the partners' capital, America
First Participating said, the fund's annual cash distribution
rate will be adjusted to $1.15 a unit, beginning with the
distribution to units of record Oct. 31, and payable Nov. 30.</p>
