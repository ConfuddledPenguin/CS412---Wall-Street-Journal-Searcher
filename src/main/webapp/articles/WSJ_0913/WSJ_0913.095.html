	<p class="article-leader">RICHMOND, Va. -- Reynolds Metals Co. Chairman William O.
Bourke said he expects third-quarter earnings to exceed
analysts' expectations over 20% because of increasing revenue
from abroad.
   Mr. Bourke said the earnings will be near the second
quarter's $1.75 a share, exceeding analysts' projections of
about $1.45. Mr. Bourke, who is also chief executive officer,
said the nation's No. 2 aluminum concern should surpass $7 a
share in earnings for the year, against expectations of
$6.67.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Even the higher-than-expected estimates, however, will
fall short of last year's levels of $2.10 for the third
quarter and $9.06 for the year. Mr. Bourke attributed the
year-to-year decline to ongoing slumps in the transportation
and construction industries and continued low market prices
for aluminum ingot.</p>
<p>Mr. Bourke's bullish forecast apparently took Wall Street
by surprise, as Reynolds's stock rose $2.375 to close at
$68.375, a new 52-week high, in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange. On Tuesday, Mr. Bourke gave a sneak
preview of the more bullish earnings outlook to analysts at
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette's annual metals seminar.</p>
<p>In an interview at Reynolds's headquarters here, Mr.
Bourke attributed the better-than-expected performance to
foreign business -- growing at a rate of 20% to 30% -- which
"more than offset" declining domestic demand. He also noted
that aluminum producers had virtually no surplus inventory,
contributing to a tight supply-demand situation that has
firmed prices.</p>
<p>"There's just no surplus inventory anywhere, and we have
no intention of letting them increase," the executive said.</p>
<p>Mr. Bourke also suggested that the earnings vindicated his
ongoing restructuring of Reynolds's operations, in which he
wrote off 45% of the company's assets and diversified into
gold, plastics, and fabricated aluminum products. Mr. Bourke
has tried to focus on such products in an effort to protect
the company from aluminum's wide price swings.</p>
<p>Aluminum analyst Stewart Spector said Reynolds's strong
performance was driven by higher-than-expected ingot prices.
While off from last year's highs, the rise in raw aluminum
prices -- 46% since January -- has exceeded Wall Street's
expectations.</p>
<p>Reynolds's sluggish domestic growth, stemming largely from
its reliance on depressed construction and transportation
markets, won't improve before the middle of next year, Mr.
Bourke said. The executive said the company's capital
expenditure program of over $3 billion, begun in 1988, should
add $150 million to profit in 1991 and as much as $200
million in 1992.</p>
<p>Separately, Reynolds Metals said its Mount Vernon Plastics
Corp. unit opened a $15 million plant in Sparks, Nev., that
makes plastic overcaps for canned coffee, margarine tubs and
tennis ball cans, containers for margarine, yogurt and deli
products, and microwave trays. By year end, the plant will
have about 150 employees, the company said.</p>
