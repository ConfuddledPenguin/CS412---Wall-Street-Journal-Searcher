	<p class="article-leader">The world's moralists seem to have reached a consensus
about how to deal with Iraq. To wit, the moral course is to
mount a blockade, the burden of which will fall on
noncombatants -- women, children, conquered Kuwaitis and the
Iraqi people. But, they say, do not think of bombing Iraqi
chemical-weapons sites, let alone trying to defeat the Iraqi
military machine in open combat. Such "unprovoked" use of
force is immoral.
   Of course it is preferable to achieve our purposes without
violence, without taking any casualties or inflicting any.
But look unblinkingly at the purposes President Bush outlined
Tuesday night: an immediate and unconditional Iraqi
withdrawal from Kuwait; measures to ensure more permanent
peace in the vital Persian Gulf; a halt to the spread of
chemical, biological, missile and nuclear weapons; the
consummation of a lesson that aggression will not be
tolerated. As the remarkable degree of world consensus
attests, these purposes are both just and vital to stability
and progress in the emerging, highly interdependent world
order.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The chance that Saddam Hussein will relent and withdraw
unconditionally is, it should by now be apparent, highly
theoretical. There also is a chance that he would be replaced
in a coup, but somehow dictators who rule by terror seldom
are. And in either case, it is difficult to imagine an
agreement to destroy chemical weapons, halt the Iraqi nuclear
program and reduce the Iraqi military to a size that does not
threaten its neighbors, not to mention the return of the loot
taken during the aggression. The "moderate" option of
containing Saddam over the next generation almost surely
would undermine our Arab allies, and is a de facto
recognition of his conquest. If President Bush's purposes are
to be achieved, the odds are overwhelming that they will have
to be achieved by force.</p>
<p>Naturally one should be prudent. While marshaling his
forces and building consensus, President Bush has allowed
time for diplomacy by the Arab states, the UN Secretary
General and so on. With his first armored forces now deployed
in Saudi Arabia, he may want to try again to achieve his aims
with the threat of force rather than its use -- for example
by the blockade of Kuwaiti air space suggested on our pages
by Albert Wohlstetter and Fred Hoffman. But such options
depend on a willingness to use, sooner or later, whatever
force is necessary to achieve the full menu of the
President's stated purposes.</p>
<p>The lesson of military history, indeed, is that if force
must be used it should be used decisively. It is the instinct
of the American people that military action is serious
business -- to be avoided if possible but, when necessary,
not to be invoked in half-hearted ways. We have been
struggling since the end of World War II, to be sure, with
the issue of how to apply this lesson in an age of nuclear
weapons, given their unimaginable destructiveness and
potential for carnage of noncombatants. In Korea, this issue
comprised the dispute between President Truman and General
MacArthur. In Vietnam we feared superpower conflict and its
potential for nuclear holocaust, so applied force through
incremental, gradual escalation. Our experience confirmed the
wisdom of history's lesson.</p>
<p>The Iraqi invasion is the first aggression of a new era
precisely because superpower competition no longer protects
the local tyrant. The issue is whether the world will allow
such brazenness even without superpower protection and the
threat of nuclear war; if so it will be a dark portent for
the future in general, and in particular for the potential
American hostages throughout the world.</p>
<p>There is of course no thought of employing nuclear
weapons, since we want to maintain moral and prudential
restraints on their use. We would like if possible to extend
such restraints to chemical and other weapons of mass
destruction likely to take a huge toll of civilians. But to
achieve the President's aims in Iraq we probably will need to
use force decisively in the classic military sense of
destroying the enemy's capacity and will to resist.</p>
<p>The American armed forces have digested the lesson of the
Vietnam escalation better than anyone, if anything perhaps
too well. The generals certainly are right in wanting a force
large enough to crack the Iraqi army swiftly, but there also
is a risk that unrealistically large requirements can become
an excuse for inaction. By now, after all, we have
overwhelming air power, a Security Council blessing, control
of the seas, and some 20 allies committed. American armored,
airborne and marine divisions now face Iraq, not to overlook
a large Turkish army on its northern border. President Bush
has visited Chairman Gorbachev to make sure the Soviets stand
aside, and visited Congress to cement its backing and rally
the American people. Most of the pieces are in place for a
decisive blow.</p>
<p>A few weeks more time would provide more tanks and more
troops, but also carry the risk of political complications
and erosion of the alliance. The passage of time, above all,
is likely to expose the moral ambiguity of the current policy
of pseudo-war. The President already has said we will allow
the shipment of medicine to the sick and food to babies. Is
it our policy to starve babies not to the point of death, but
only to malnutrition? How long can this be sustained, and
what outcome might justify it?</p>
<p>President Bush, of course, must bear the decision of
balancing the chances of avoiding further violence, the
pressures of time and the need for decisive action. But his
decision need not be clouded by sentimentality masquerading
as morality. When war looms, acting decisively and seeking a
speedy conclusion is not only the best military choice but
the best moral choice.</p>
