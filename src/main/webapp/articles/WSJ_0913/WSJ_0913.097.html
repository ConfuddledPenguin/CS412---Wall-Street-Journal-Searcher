	<p class="article-leader">We very much appreciate the review ("The Sick Soviet
Bear," Leisure & Arts, Aug. 28) by Charles Wolf Jr. of our
book, "Meltdown: Inside the Soviet Economy," but we would
like to correct one point of great importance. Mr. Wolf
reports that we "repeatedly urge reliance on and support for
Mikhail Gorbachev." To the contrary, in our book we note that
the dynamics of economic reform are no longer in his hands,
and we have publicly criticized the Bush administration for
putting all its eggs in Mr. Gorbachev's basket. Mr. Gorbachev
may have missed the opportunity to use privatization to
strengthen the Soviet Union against political disintegration.
The movement toward autonomous republics might require the
assignment of property rights, in whole or part, on a
republic basis.
