	<p class="article-leader">Ecolab Inc., in a continuation of a business relationship
with West Germany's Henkel KGaA that began last December,
said the two companies have agreed to combine their European
cleaning and sanitizing businesses.
   Ecolab, a cleaning and maintenance concern based in St.
Paul, Minn., will also acquire Henkel's cleaning and
sanitizing businesses in 18 non-European countries and plans
to acquire Henkel's interest in cleaning and sanitizing
businesses in several other countries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement, Ecolab will pay $74 million and
Henkel will receive 5.6 million shares of Ecolab's common
stock. Each company will hold a 50% stake in the joint
venture company, Henkel-Ecolab, which will have revenue of
about $750 million.</p>
<p>Henkel, a chemical products and packaging concern, will
have representation on Ecolab's board proportionate to its
stock ownership. Ecolab currently has 23.5 million common
shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Henkel will also get back the $110 million it paid for its
initial investment in Ecolab. In December Ecolab sold Henkel
1.1 million shares of 7% Series A convertible preferred
stock. Ecolab said the shares will be retired.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals
and is expected to be completed early next year.</p>
