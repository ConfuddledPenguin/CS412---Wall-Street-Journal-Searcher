	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- If you're having trouble selling a piece of
real estate, you're in good company.
   Big pension funds that poured billions of dollars into
real-estate investment pools now are finding it unexpectedly
hard to get their money out.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Starting in the late 1970s, many pension funds decided to
diversify their portfolios of stocks and bonds by investing
in commercial real estate, such as office buildings, shopping
malls and warehouses. Much of the estimated $120 billion they
shelled out went to insurance companies and banks that pooled
the money and bought scores of different properties.</p>
<p>Now, with the real estate market wilting, most of the two
dozen so-called open-end real estate pools have been flooded
with demands from pension funds wanting their money back. The
withdrawal requests have fed on themselves and now are
approaching $2 billion. But paying off waiting investors
could take years, some pool operators say.</p>
<p>Pool operators say that selling properties in today's
depressed market to meet withdrawal requests would force them
to accept fire-sale prices. "We're not going to sell a
property hastily to pay out one person to the detriment of
all the other investors," says a spokesman for Aetna Life &
Casualty Co. As a result, pool operators are asking investors
to be patient; some, such as First Wachovia Corp., are
imposing withdrawal moratoriums of a year or more. And at
most pools, it is up to the operators to decide when to honor
withdrawal requests.</p>
<p>The size of the waiting lists varies greatly. Investors
accounting for almost half of Cigna Corp.'s $769 million real
estate pool have asked for their money back. The insurer is
asking investors to accept a two-year delay in payouts. In
addition, it wants to make partial payouts, instead of doling
out sales proceeds on a first come, first served basis.</p>
<p>At the biggest pool, Equitable Life Assurance Society of
the U.S.'s $3.7 billion Prime Property Fund, 25 clients have
asked to withdraw a total of $280 million. The fund began
making partial payments to investors last May, and Equitable
officials say they expect to catch up in nine months to a
year.</p>
<p>That's a far cry from the promise of easy withdrawals that
attracted pension funds to the real estate pools during the
past 20 years. By the promise of letting investors move their
money in and out on short notice, pools were intended to
overcome investors' worries about real estate's lack of
liquidity -- the ability to sell a property quickly without
taking a financial bath.</p>
<p>But as investors learned in the 1987 stock market crash,
liquidity can evaporate quickly when everyone rushes for the
exit at once. Several years of deteriorating real estate
prices and some pool operators' poor property selections have
soured many pension funds on real estate pools. And as pools
often pay withdrawals on a first come, first served basis,
other investors have rushed to join the exit line for fear of
being left behind.</p>
<p>"When things are going well, no one wants to get out {of
pools}, and when things are going badly, everybody wants to
get out -- and no one can," says SEI Corp. real estate
consultant Nicholas Tannura. Richard Wollack, an Emeryville,
Calif., broker who specializes in helping pension funds that
want to get out of real estate pools, says, "There is no
liquidity in an open-end fund unless people think there is
liquidity."</p>
<p>With the real estate market slumping, one pool run by John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. and others run by Bank of
Boston Corp. and Travelers Corp. have decided to sell all
their properties and return the proceeds to investors.</p>
<p>But even liquidation won't guarantee that clients will get
their money back quickly. Bank of Boston, for example, has
sold only one property after a year of trying to unload its
$200 million pool portfolio. "We're going to be looking at an
extended time for disposition," says Thomas Lunny, director
of the Bank of Boston real-estate advisory arm.</p>
<p>The exodus from real estate pools doesn't necessarily
signal that pension funds are souring on real estate as an
investment. Specialists believe pension funds with long-term
investment horizons will continue to use real estate to
diversify their stock and bond holdings and to help hedge
against inflation.</p>
<p>"The reasons that pension funds went into real estate --
diversification, lower volatility for the total portfolio and
protection against inflation -- are still there," says Sylvia
Ferrell-Jones, who handles real estate investing for
Connecticut's public employee pension fund. "People should
not panic, based on the past two or three years of declining
performance."</p>
<p>But as pension executives become more experienced with
real estate -- this was virtually unheard of in pension
portfolios only 20 years ago -- many of the larger funds are
starting to invest in closed-end pools, which don't promise
quick withdrawals, or buy properties directly. "We would
rather invest with a limited number of people or on our own
where we have more control," says Edward T. Tokar Jr., head
of Allied-Signal Inc.'s pension fund.</p>
<p>But the withdrawal bug has spread to some closed-end real
estate funds. Unlike open-end funds, investors in closed-end
funds agree to tie up their money for years, but they usually
can withdraw if they find another investor to take their
place. In the past 18 months, "we've seen a doubling or
tripling" in the number of investors interested in such
swaps, though the number isn't overwhelming, says Mr.
Wollack, the California broker who helps arrange them.</p>
<p>Worsening the withdrawal problem at many open-end pools is
the policy of making payouts on a first come, first served
basis. This puts pressure on pension funds to ask for their
money back as a protective measure, for fear that the
properties in the pool might be overvalued. In that case,
those pulling out first could get back more on their
investments than those who stay in the pool.</p>
<p>"I am convinced that more than half those investors
standing in line {to withdraw} are doing so simply because
they saw the queue," says Paul Saylor of Atlanta-based
Institutional Property Consultants. Several pools have
switched to making partial payments, to ease withdrawal
pressure. But such moves irk investors that are near the
front of the withdrawal line and now will have to wait longer
for the full return of their money.</p>
<p>Real estate veterans note that withdrawal lines have come
and gone before with market cycles, and that most pension
funds are slowing new investments but not abandoning the
market.</p>
<p>Equitable, for one, says that its withdrawal requests now
are running at about the average for the past five years; its
withdrawal problem stems from a dearth of new investors
putting money into real estate, providing cash to pay off
those who want to leave, the insurer says.</p>
<p>In addition, some real estate pools, including
Equitable's, actually have outpaced the stock and bond market
indexes during the past 12 months. "All of a sudden, this
year, when the stock and bond markets don't have dramatic
returns, our returns don't look so shabby," says Harry
Pierandri, portfolio manager for Equitable's Equitable Real
Estate Investment Management unit.</p>
