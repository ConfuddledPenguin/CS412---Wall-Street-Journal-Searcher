	<h3>Environment: Ecology Claims May Just Look Good on Paper</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Makers of paper products from grocery sacks to disposable
diapers are marketing their goods with claims that they are
environmentally superior to plastic.
   But paper companies may soon find themselves in trouble
with federal regulators for making much the same false or
misleading claims as their rivals in the plastic industry.
Already, the Federal Trade Commission is investigating a
proliferation of environmental claims for various paper
products, and several state officials say they also are
concerned.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The main point of contention is paper makers' statements
that their products are biodegradable. Among the companies
making such claims are Stone Container Corp., which says its
paper bags are "naturally degradable" and "environmentally
responsible"; Burger King Corp., which labels all its
fast-food packaging as biodegradable; and Weyerhaeuser Co.,
which makes the same claim for its Nature's Care disposable
diapers.</p>
<p>These companies say their claims are accurate and confer
an important marketing advantage because the public believes
that paper is "natural" and, therefore, safer for the planet.
But federal and state officials say such claims may only
foster misperceptions about the differences between paper and
plastic.</p>
<p>"A lot of the claims made for degradable plastic are just
as misleading when applied to paper products," says Barry
Cutler, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of
Consumer Protection.</p>
<p>The FTC is investigating claims for a variety of paper
products, Mr. Cutler says. The agency's rules preclude the
agency from disclosing specific investigations before it
announces charges. But Stone Container says the FTC has asked
for documentation of claims made in a 30-second TV spot that
ran in some markets earlier this year. In the ad, which the
company says was a test campaign that is now being evaluated,
Stone said its bags are degradable and recyclable.</p>
<p>The ad was "very effective. More people were asking for
paper bags," a Stone Container spokesman says.</p>
<p>Environmental groups say degradability claims are
irrelevant, given that nearly 90% of waste is disposed of in
landfills or incinerators. "In a landfill environment, paper
is no more degradable than plastic," says Richard Denison,
senior scientist at the Environmental Defense Fund, a
Washington, D.C., advocacy group.</p>
<p>Supermarket chains and bag makers are also widely
promoting paper grocery sacks as "100% recyclable." But
environmental groups say even that claim tends to mislead
because only 10% to 15% of paper bags are currently being
recycled, according to Franklin Associates Ltd., a Prairie
Village, Kan., solid-waste consultant. (Franklin says that
rate far exceeds the 1% to 3% estimate for plastic bags.)</p>
<p>Advertising watchdogs are pursuing paper makers partly
because of loud complaints that the plastics industry has
been singled out for attack while claims for paper go
unchallenged. "We're asking for a level playing field," says
George Makrauer, chairman of the Degradable Plastics Council,
an industry group.</p>
<p>So far, federal and state investigations have targeted
degradability claims for plastic products, such as First
Brands Corp.'s Glad trash bags. Attorneys general in seven
states have sued Mobil Corp.'s Mobil Chemical Co. unit for
alleged false advertising of Hefty trash bags. Bowing to
public pressure, Mobil is removing all environmental claims,
and First Brands is modifying its claims.</p>
<p>Much is at stake in the paper-plastic marketing war. In 10
years, plastic has won about half the market for grocery
sacks and sales of about $330 million a year, according to
industry estimates. Paper grocery bags, with annual sales of
$1.2 billion, have steadily lost market share as supermarkets
have pushed plastic bags, which cost less than half as much.</p>
<p>The paper industry has fought back with a media campaign
asserting that "paper bags degrade quickly and harmlessly in
the environment," and urging consumers to demand: "Package
Mine In Paper, Please." The campaign has halted the decline
of paper sacks, both sides say. Mr. Makrauer of the plastics
council says plastic bag sales have dropped 10% to 15% in the
past year.</p>
<p>The paper industry now is taking the offensive, launching
new products in markets dominated by plastic. Stone
Container, a Chicago company that has 40% of the paper
grocery sack market, recently began selling paper lawn and
trash bags that it says are "all natural" and
"biodegradable." Its new line of trash compactor bags have a
plastic lining wrapped in "environmentally safe" paper.</p>
<p>The Stone Container spokesman says the claims are accurate
because tests show paper "degrades completely" in water and
when composted. "We'll be the first to admit that nothing
degrades in landfills," he says.</p>
<p>But Mr. Denison of the Environmental Defense Fund says the
labels are "totally misleading." The lawn and refuse bags are
intended for composting, but the label also specifies
"general trash," which would be burned or dumped in
landfills.</p>
<p>The marketing battle isn't limited to bags. Keyes Fibre
Co. is increasing the prominence of "100% biodegradable"
labels on Chinet paper plates because many people "thought
they were plastic," says a spokesman. Weyerhaeuser launched
its "88% biodegradable" disposable diapers at the request of
retailers clamoring for an environmentally friendly product.</p>
<p>Some bag makers and grocery chains are fighting
degradability claims and pushing recycling to keep trash out
of landfills.</p>
<p>Duro Bag Manufacturing Co. in Ludlow, Ky., sells "100%
recycled" grocery sacks made from used corrugated boxes. Stop
& Shop Supermarket Co., based in Quincy, Mass., is
distributing fliers telling consumers that degradability
isn't the answer. The chain is testing a new Stone Container
sack containing 20% recycled newspapers, but is also
defending its heavy use of plastic bags. Says a spokeswoman:
"We can't determine based on good science that paper or
plastic is superior."</p>
