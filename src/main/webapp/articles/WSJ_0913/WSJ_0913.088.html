	<p class="article-leader">Ratners Group PLC, the British retailer in the midst of a
takeover bid for Kay Jewelers Inc. of Alexandria, Va.,
reported a 37% plunge in pretax profit for the first six
months of the year.
   Britain's biggest jewelery chain said pretax profit fell
to #9.30 million ($17.3 million) from #14.7 million a year
earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest results, in line with market expectations,
suffer in the comparison because of a #7.4 million gain on
investments and property disposals in the 1989 period. There
were no such gains in the latest period.</p>
<p>Ratner said that despite the slowdown in U.K. consumer
demand, the company is heading toward "the all-important
Christmas season with confidence."</p>
<p>The $328 million bid for Kay, funded in large part through
a 1-for-4 rights issue, is expected to be completed before
the Christmas selling period, it said.</p>
