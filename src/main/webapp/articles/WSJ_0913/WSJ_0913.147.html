	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Motorola Inc. and Toshiba Corp. agreed in
principle to set up a semiconductor joint venture in
Scotland, people close to the companies said.
   Details are still under negotiation, and a signing date
hasn't been set, those people stressed. The plans are the
most significant part of a basic agreement, reached a few
months ago, to expand the three-year-old relationship between
the concerns. Motorola and Toshiba make memory and logic
chips in a joint venture in northern Japan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The project would give Toshiba its first major chip-making
operation in Europe.</p>
<p>Neither company would confirm the accord, which was
reported in Thursday's Nihon Keizai Shimbun. A Motorola
spokesman in the U.S. said the company has an "agreement in
principle" on a "new phase" of its agreement with Toshiba,
but wouldn't elaborate.</p>
<p>A spokesman at Toshiba's headquarters in Tokyo said that
the company hopes to build a new semiconductor plant in
Europe and that a venture with Motorola is "one of the
possibilities." He said the company also is considering
partnerships with Siemens AG of West Germany and Thomson S.A.
of France, or may open a plant by itself.</p>
<p>Toshiba currently assembles semiconductors in West
Germany, but the Motorola plant would be its first European
wafer fabrication facility. Wafer fabrication, which involves
making the heart of the semiconductor, is more complicated
and has higher value than assembly. As the European Community
governments move toward economic integration and established
domestic-content regulations for 1992, wafer fabrication is
considered an important mark of "local" production.</p>
<p>Motorola currently has its own wafer fabrication facility
in Scotland.</p>
<p>The tentative Motorola-Toshiba agreement comes amid
speculation that the relationship between the companies has
been on the rocks. Earlier this year, Motorola signed an
agreement giving it access to memory chip technology from
International Business Machines Corp. Motorola is supposed to
get that same technology from Toshiba, but apparently
couldn't reach an agreement on getting more advanced
know-how. Motorola is teaching Toshiba how to make logic
chips.</p>
<p>As another part of the same basic pact that includes the
European venture, Toshiba and Motorola decided to build more
advanced-generation semciondcutors in Japan. They didn't
agree on a more wide-ranging technology sharing, the people
close to the companies said.</p>
<p>The venture between the companies would be the latest in a
string of bilateral semiconductor agreements signed this
year. As trade tensions mount, particularly over
semiconductors, Japanese government and industry officials
are encouraging more joint ventures to bring the industries
closer together.</p>
