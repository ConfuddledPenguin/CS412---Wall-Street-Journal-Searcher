	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- The cash-strapped city of Philadelphia
said it will again postpone the sale of $375 million in
short-term bonds after Swiss Bank Corp. withdrew its
guarantee for a portion of the offering.
   At a news conference, Mayor W. Wilson Goode said the
bank's withdrawal and "excessively high" interest rates
demanded by investors in yesterday's pricing attempt were
factors forcing the city to postpone pricing the notes for at
least another week. Philadelphia originally intended to sell
the notes last month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a move to reassure holders of the city's other bonds,
rated "below investment grade" by Moody's Investor's Service
Inc., Mayor Goode said he was directing the city finance
director to transfer sufficient cash to the sinking fund and
other escrow accounts to meet the city's debt obligations
through June 30.</p>
<p>Swiss Bank confirmed Tuesday that it was guaranteeing $50
million of the notes, the only bank to make such a
commitment. But yesterday the bank said it would no longer
participate in the offering because unspecified conditions
for its support had not been fulfilled.</p>
<p>"We have determined that these conditions have not been
satisfied, and, accordingly, we have decided not to proceed,"
said a spokesman at the bank's headquarters in Basel,
Switzerland. Mayor Goode said he was still trying to learn
why the bank backed out.</p>
<p>Swiss Bank's desertion is likely to make the notes more
difficult to sell and could force the city to restructure the
offering or scuttle it, said traders and analysts.</p>
<p>At best, Philadelphia will have to offer a significant
premium for the tax-free notes. Peter Allegrini, a bond-fund
manager for Fidelity Investments, said yesterday's pricing
suggested a yield of about 9.5%, compared with about 6% for
the typical short-term municipal note.</p>
<p>Philadelphia needs the proceeds from the note sale to
stave off a cash-flow crisis arising from a $206.4 million
budget deficit in the year ending June 30. Without the notes,
officials say the city can stretch its funds until December
at best. And even with a note sale, the city will run out of
cash in May.</p>
<p>The city's precarious financial position has some
investors convinced that the notes, which are unsecured, are
too risky at any yield. "There is just not enough security in
this thing to fall back on if the city were to get into
trouble," said Robert Froehlich, an analyst at Van Kempen
Merritt Investment Advisory Corp. "Whether it's 9 1/2% or 11
1/2% or 12 1/2%, if the city goes into bankruptcy, that extra
risk isn't worth it."</p>
<p>Mr. Froehlich said that Van Kempen holds about about $30
million of Philadelphia's other bonds but does not intend to
buy any notes unless the offering is restructured to
guarantee payment. "Banks are in the business of lending," he
said. "The fact that one of them got on board and then got
off certainly was a red light."</p>
<p>But Fidelity's Mr. Allegrini said the notes are very
appealing at the high yields Philadelphia's underwriters were
offering. "I haven't finished my homework, but I'm very close
to saying yes," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Allegrini said the city plans to put revenue in a
special account to pay off the notes. "We want to make sure
that once the funds are in the lockbox, they are there to pay
off the notes," he said. If the city can clarify the
covenants, Fidelity will probably buy the notes for its
Pennsylvania tax-free bond fund.</p>
<p>Philadelphia's fiscal troubles have also affected its
other debt. This summer, Moody's downgraded the city's credit
rating to the junk-bond level. Standard & Poor's Corp. gives
the city its lowest investment-grade rating.</p>
<p>And since city controller Jonathan A. Saidel disclosed the
city's cash woes in mid-August, leery investors have bid up
the yields on the city's bonds. Yields on the city's 8 1/4
general obligation bonds due 2009, for example, have risen
from about 8% to about 8.6%, said Alan Schankel, manager of
the municipal bond department at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>"The city leadership must show a game plan," Mr. Schankel
said. "They aren't showing that things are going to change."</p>
<p>Mayor Goode was optimistic that the city's elected
officials can resolve the fiscal crisis. "I believe it is our
responsibility to come to a consensus," he said. "The problem
we have is solvable."</p>
