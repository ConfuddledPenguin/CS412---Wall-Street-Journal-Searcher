	<p class="article-leader">SIX NATIONS SIGNED a treaty restoring full sovereignty to
a united Germany.
   The treaty, signed in Moscow by the two Germanys and the
four World War II victors, endorses the unified Germany
scheduled to come into being Oct. 3. The new Germany can
remain in NATO, but no non-German NATO forces will be
permanently stationed on the territory of the former East
German state. In return, the treaty declares that the united
Germany "has no territorial claims whatsoever against other
states." As part of a side accord, Bonn agreed to provide
billions of dollars in aid to Moscow and help build housing
in the U.S.S.R. for the nearly 400,000 Soviet troops that
will leave German territory.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the treaty, Germany will reduce its armed forces to
370,000 troops, and pledges not to acquire nuclear, chemical
or biological weapons. Germany also will sign a treaty with
Poland guaranteeing their current border.</p>

Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>The speech by Iranian spiritual leader Khamenei came amid
reports Tehran had agreed to help break a U.N. embargo by

government for the hardships that have resulted from the
trade embargo.</p>

<p>The House voted to require heftier military spending by
U.S. allies in Europe and the Pacific as part of post-Cold
War defense arrangements. The provisions, approved during
debate on a $283 billion defense authorization bill for
fiscal 1991, include a requirement that Tokyo pay the full
cost of U.S. forces in Japan.</p>
<p>Gorbachev said a plan for converting the Soviet Union to a
market economy has been submitted to the national Parliament
and those of the 15 republics. The president, saying the
entire nation should debate the issue, confirmed that the
plan he submitted to legislators was based on a radical
proposal submitted by economist Shatalin.</p>

<p>A state judge in New York signed an order temporarily
barring St. Martin's Press from continuing to sell a book
about the Israeli intelligence service, known as the Mossad.
Lawyers for the Israeli government argued that publication of
the book would endanger lives and disclose confidential
information.</p>

<p>The Senate adopted a mandatory inspection plan for the
nation's $30 billion seafood industry. The landmark

rival inspection plan favored by the Bush administration.</p>

<p>South Africa appealed to the U.N. for help in ending a
wave of black violence in Johannesburg's townships that has
killed 700 people in a month. Pretoria called for
international pressure to arrange a meeting between two black
rivals, Mandela of the African National Congress and
Buthelezi, leader of the Zulu-based Inkatha movement.</p>

<p>A research team reported that different cases of
Alzheimer's disease can spring from different causes, showing
that it is a group of closely associated disorders rather
than a single disease. An estimated four million Americans
suffer from Alzheimer's disease, which results in the
progressive loss of mental powers.</p>

<p>Nigeria's President Babangida said it would be premature
for a five-nation, 4,000-member West African peacekeeping

<p>Scientists identified an enzyme linked to the most serious
form of diabetes, a discovery that may help in finding people

diabetes, which affects about one million Americans.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Philippines halted military actions against Communist
rebels in Manila and three provinces but demanded a show of
sincerity from insurgents before the cease-fire is expanded.
There was no immediate reply from the guerrillas to the
order, seen as a way for officials to focus on the
reconstruction of towns devastated by a July quake.</p>
<p>---</p>

cameras to record and broadcast civil trials in several

laboratory for studying environmental problems.</p>
