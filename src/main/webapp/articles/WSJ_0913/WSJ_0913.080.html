	<p class="article-leader">Our text for today will be taken not from the showdown in
the Arabian desert, but from a consideration of that vaulting
masterpiece of prescient phrasemongering, "the imperial
Congress."
   Anyone who reads regularly from the offerings on the
opposite page -- as we all do -- knows that most of
Washington's problems at home and abroad can be traced to the
excessive ambitions and constitutional excesses of a Congress
gone mad with power lust. It is an interesting conceit, once
more beloved of liberals than conservatives, but its day of
even limited credibility was shorter than the test with
Saddam Hussein now promises to be. These days, rather than
being a ravening wolf straining at a dangerously frayed
leash, Congress repeatedly proves itself to be a neutered
pussycat, aiming for nothing higher than comfortable
longevity in the warm environs of Capitol Hill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That, to repeat, is not what you will learn from reading
the Journal's editorials or even the offerings of more
balanced observers. But what we think we know from reading
here, there and (it occasionally seems) everywhere, and what
is actually true, are often two different things. This is one
of those cases.</p>
<p>The record is quite clear. Across a decade in which two
administrations regularly complained about congressional
encroachment on executive prerogatives, Congress was about as
intrusive as a leaf. It lighted here and lighted there, but
for most of the time it blew first in one direction and then
another, barely staying put long enough to make an impression
of any kind.</p>
<p>What venture in fact did Congress deter, impede or
destroy? Certainly not Mr. Reagan's foreign-policy forays,
whether in Central America or Asia. Obviously not his
domestic initiatives, the most important of which were as
regularly endorsed as they regularly assaulted cherished
Democratic Party positions. While a Bush presidency, achieved
without a policy mandate, was expected to provide Congress
with the wherewithal for a reassertion of influence, the
truth is that Congress has been no less disinclined to
confront George Bush than Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>"Bring on the wimp," some of the congressional tigers were
roaring 20 months ago. But the "wimp" turned out to have a
whip, his popularity, and Congress has rarely ventured out of
its cage. Rather than an imperial Congress, this has been an
invisible Congress.</p>
<p>Do we have a budget crisis? Is the savings-and-loan
disaster directly traceable to Washington? Has the economic
separation of rich and poor in the U.S. taken on Third World
proportions? Has the president sent American forces into open
combat three times in 10 years without serious congressional
check and no prior congressional approval? Is even the
largest military expedition since the Vietnam War judged to
lie outside the bounds of congressional review, criticism or
formal approval?</p>
<p>The answer is always the same: yes. This Congress has not
even demanded that the president ask for the fig leaf of a
Tonkin Gulf resolution -- a fig leaf, I would add, that is
not nearly as emphatic an endorsement of his Middle East
venture as it deserves. The problem is not that in this
instance that Congress should be opposing the president but
that in this instance, as in so many in recent years,
Congress has proved to be simply irrelevant.</p>
<p>There is something altogether fitting in the symbolism
inherent in a budget summit between Congress and president at
an Air Force base. The commander-in-chief summons and the
Congress mumbles. God forbid that it should take the bit in
its teeth and offer a tough alternative to the policies that
have brought the government to bankruptcy and the nation to
both bankruptcy-recession and inflation. A trim here, a slide
there and a lot of winks all around, and you've got the
"budget package," which is offered as a meaningful answer to
a sea of red ink and a boxful of unmet national needs.</p>
<p>It is not true that Congress can do nothing well. It can
separate petitioners from their money with remarkable
dexterity. What PACs, corporations, true believers and
concerned citizens spend to help perpetuate this gutless
Congress in office sets records every year. They get
something individually for their money, which ranges from
satisfaction at their candidate's re-election to influence on
his vote. What the nation gets is a clutch of House and
Senate members who check their convictions at the door. Money
is mother's milk, and mother calls the tune.</p>
<p>Is your name Charlie Keating and you have a problem with
savings-and-loan regulators? Call on the Democratic whip in
the Senate and a few other concerned senators. Are you a
farmer afraid that Congress might face facts and impose
sanctions on Iraq, thereby cutting off one of your lucrative
markets? Well, right up to the day before the invasion of
Kuwait, count on the Republican Senate leader to be in your
corner.</p>
<p>Congress is a pride of special-interest shills posing as
public-policy lions. It does not take a presidential giant to
still their querulous complaints. A man of quite ordinary
stature appears large when standing among pygmies. This
Congress is imperial only when it comes to the structures it
builds for itself. In all other respects, its goals are as
modest as its vision, courage and convictions.</p>
