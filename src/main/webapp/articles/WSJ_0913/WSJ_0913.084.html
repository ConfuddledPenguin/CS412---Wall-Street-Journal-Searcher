	<p class="article-leader">EAST GERMANY'S ACTIVE `MOLES'</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>East Germany fired 30 former secret police agents from
official posts after learning that thousands may be working
in the government, officials said.</p>
<p>Up to 6,000 agents of the old Communist security police
reportedly still occupy important posts in East German
government and industry three weeks before unification. Der
Morgen, an East German daily, said 65 "moles" of the Stasi
state-security apparatus, formally abolished in December,
still worked in the Interior Ministry, which oversees a
committee in charge of Stasi's breakup.</p>
<p>East German officials acknowledged on Tuesday some
government ministries were still riddled with Stasi moles
infiltrated in the 1980s but offered no figures.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel conceded that the
man he appointed to oversee the Stasi-dissolution committee
turned out to be a Stasi mole himself and was fired. Der
Morgen accused Mr. Diestel of laxness in rooting out Stasi
agents from his ministry.</p>
<p>ANOTHER SOVIET SHORTAGE: INK</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's national newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda
reported that the country is down to just two or three weeks'
supply of printer's ink. "It's entirely possible that in a
short time, presses for newspapers, passports and rubles will
come to a halt," the article said. Sergei Galkin of the state
Printing Committee told the newspaper that Western suppliers
of printer's ink haven't been paid for their last shipment
and refuse to send any more on credit. He said he needs $12
million to $17 million before he can replenish supplies.</p>
<p>DAIHATSU'S ITALIAN PROJECT
</p>
<p>Japan's Daihatsu Motor Co. has reached an agreement with
Carrozzeria Bertone S.p.A to supply major parts for a
four-wheel-drive car to be sold under the Italian company's
name in Europe. Daihatsu will ship the body and steering
systems for its Rocky model to Bertone, which will complete
the vehicles with engines built by BMW, Daihatsu said.
Bertone and Daihatsu will turn out about 10,000 units a year,
beginning in 1992. The new car, called the Feroza, will be
marketed by Daihatsu dealers.</p>
<p>EXECUTIONS IN CHINA</p>
<p>China has executed more than 500 people this year in its
biggest crackdown on crime since 1983, Amnesty International
said. The London-based human rights group said the executions
were carried out by firing squads after courts were ordered
to "clean up crime" before the Asian Games in Beijing later
this month. "Those executed are among the 1,100 people we
know have been sentenced to death in the past 12 months,"
Amnesty said. "And while that number is high, it is only the
tip of the iceberg."</p>
<p>BUNGEE BAN IN NEW SOUTH WALES</p>
<p>The thrill-seeking sport of bungee jumping was banned in
the Australian state of New South Wales pending review of an
accident that injured the former Miss Australia and an
experienced jumper. Natalie McCurry, whose reign as Miss
Australia ended Monday, suffered a broken collarbone when a
cord came free as she and the other jumper, Andy Gulby,
plunged 130 feet from a cage suspended by a crane off
Sydney's Birkenhead Point.</p>
<p>FROM LIANYUNGANG TO ROTTERDAM</p>
<p>Chinese and Soviet officials yesterday completed a railway
line spanning the border in remote western China, the
official Xinhua news agency reported. Xinhua said the
285-mile link would enable passengers to ride by rail from
the eastern Chinese port of Lianyungang through the Soviet
Union and East Europe to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The
total distance is 6,700 miles.</p>
<p>SLUGGISH CARS IN EUROPE</p>
<p>Europe's new-car sales in July rose 5.4% to 991,381 from
940,836 a year earlier, but fell 2% from 1,102,060 in June,
amid continuing signs of sluggishness for the auto industry.</p>
<p>The July decline from the previous month was largely
attributed to the seasonal fall in British car sales. Sales
traditionally slump ahead of August, the start of the new
license-registration year. Excluding Britain, where
month-to-month sales fell 68%, European car sales rose 8.8%
to 945,674 from 869,363 in June.</p>
<p>But analysts said they see no reason to alter full-year
forecasts ranging from flat auto sales to a 2% decline. Their
forecasts are linked to the growth in the gross domestic
product of European economies. GDP growth now is slowing from
4% in 1989 to about 2% for 1991, one analyst estimates.</p>
<p>A 21% year-to-year rise in West German car sales helped
buoy the European market overall. Since monetary union July
1, the used-car market in West Germany has come under a siege
of buying from East Germans; as the number of used cars has
diminished, more buyers have had to turn to new cars.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Spain's national carrier Iberia will begin direct flights
between Madrid and Berlin, with a stopover in Barcelona, on
Oct. 28. Iberia passengers flying to Berlin currently must
make connecting flights at Vienna, Amsterdam, Brussels,
Athens or Rome. . . . The 100th anniversary of the founding
of Fort Salisbury, now the Zimbabwean capital Harare, went
uncelebrated yesterday. Asked if any ceremonies were planned
for the centennial, a city official said, "What do you mean?
You want us to celebrate colonialism?"</p>
