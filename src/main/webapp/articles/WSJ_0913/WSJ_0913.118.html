	<p class="article-leader">CULVER CITY, Calif. -- Gary Lieberthal, chairman of the
television division of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.,
signed a new long-term employment agreement and will be
elected to the board of directors of Columbia, a Sony Corp.
unit.
   Mr. Lieberthal is the only head of a major Columbia
division to remain in his post after Sony's purchase of
Columbia late last year. Peter Guber and Jon Peters took over
as co-chairmen of Columbia soon after the purchase,
succeeding Victor Kaufman, who resigned. Messrs. Guber and
Peters subsequently recruited Frank Price to head the
Columbia Pictures unit, succeeding Dawn Steel, who resigned.
Mike Medavoy was chosen to run the Tri-Star Pictures unit
after Jeff Sagansky left to run CBS Inc.'s Entertainment
Division.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While Columbia's movie operations had been plagued by
management turnover and box office flops prior to the Sony
purchase, the television operation has been stable and
successful since Mr. Lieberthal took the helm in 1987.
Profits from the television operation have carried the movie
business through numerous losing seasons, and Columbia
Pictures Television is considered one of the company's most
valuable assets, with a library of nearly 25,000 television
episodes.</p>
<p>Columbia's current television series include "Who's the
Boss?," "Married . . . With Children" and "Designing Women."
Mr. Lieberthal joined the television division in 1986, when
Columbia acquired Embassy Communications Inc., where he was
chairman and chief executive.</p>
