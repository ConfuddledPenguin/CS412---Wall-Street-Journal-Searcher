	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The stock market, led by energy and metals
stocks, moved higher in continued light trading.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 13.12 to 2625.74 as
gains in three blue-chip oil issues -- Exxon, Chevron and
Texaco -- and in Aluminum Co. of America boosted the 30-stock
measure by a total of about 10.40 points.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Traders attributed a late surge to speculation that Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein might be overthrown, spurred by a
report from Egypt's state-run news agency that his control of
the country is being undermined by a growing dissident
movement and a coup was likely.</p>
<p>The rally took the market back up to the vicinity of
session highs reached just after trading opened. President
Bush's address to Congress, in which he declared that the
Iraqi leader "will fail" in his efforts to annex Kuwait,
served as an inspiration for the early gains, traders said.</p>
<p>In between, concerns about a statement from Iran
expressing opposition to the U.S. military presence in the
Persian Gulf and periodic bouts of futures-related program
selling kept stocks under pressure, traders said.</p>
<p>"The market's still in the same quandary," said Richard
Meyer, head of institutional trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann &
Co. "Without news, the market has no direction in which to
go."</p>
<p>On the New York Stock Exchange, 129,890,000 shares were
traded, compared with 113,220,000 shares Tuesday. Advancers
led decliners by 778 to 638.</p>
<p>Among broader market indexes, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock
Index climbed 1.50 to 322.54, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index went up 0.70 to 177.09 and the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index rose 1.07 to 298.80.</p>
<p>Several analysts said the heavy selling which had preceded
the market's recent lull -- and the increasing pessimism
developing among investors -- indicate that the market is
about due to break out of its recent trading range with a
rally.</p>
<p>Since Aug. 23, the Dow Jones industrials has stayed within
a range of about 40 points on a closing basis -- between its
Aug. 29 reading of 2632.43 and its Aug. 30 close of 2593.32.</p>
<p>"We've had plenty of excuses for {stocks} to go down
again," said Michael Metz, a market strategist at Oppenheimer
& Co., and the show of stability provides evidence that
investors "who just have to get out {of the market} and have
to raise cash have already done it."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the latest survey of investment advisors by
Investors Intelligence -- a popular indicator of market
sentiment -- showed a sharp increase in the level of market
bearishness.</p>
<p>Of the market letter writers surveyed a week ago, 56% held
a pessimistic outlook on stocks while only 30% were bullish
and 14% were expecting a short-term correction. The readings
were in line with levels reached at the market's lows in late
January, when more than 57% of the advisers were bearish and
less than 30% were bullish.</p>
<p>The data "would indicate that a lot of people have already
moved to the sidelines," said Michael Burke, editor of the
survey for Chartcraft Inc., New Rochelle, N.Y. That should
insulate the market from any sharp drops over the short run,
he added.</p>
<p>Exxon went up 1/2 to 51 3/8 in composite trading of 1.3
million shares, while Chevron advanced 1 to 77 1/8 and Texaco
climbed 1 3/4 to 64 3/8. Among other oil stocks, Mobil gained
3/4 to 66, Amoco added 7/8 to 58, Unocal added 5/8 to 32 7/8
and Atlantic Richfield went up 2 3/8 to 138 5/8. In the
oilfield-services sector, Schlumberger rose 1 1/4 to 66 7/8
and Halliburton rose 3/4 to 54 7/8.</p>
<p>Alcoa advanced 2 to 68 1/4, while Alcan Aluminium gained
1/2 to 22 1/8 and topped the exchange's list of most active
issues with 3.5 million shares. Reynolds Metals, which said
it expects third-quarter earnings to be close to the second
quarter's $1.75 a share, jumped 2 3/8 to 68 3/8; its forecast
was higher than many analysts had projected.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the metals sector, Amax rose 1 1/2 to 26 and
Phelps Dodge climbed 1 7/8 to 63 3/4 on the Big Board.
Maxxam, which owns Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical, jumped 3 3/8
to 62 on the American Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Corroon & Black rallied 6 3/4 to 37 5/8 on three million
shares. Aon expressed interest in buying the insurance
company for $40 a share, or about $840 million. Corroon &
Black has agreed to a stock-swap merger offer from Willis
Faber, a British insurer. Aon dropped 1 1/2 to 33.</p>
<p>Browning-Ferris Industries dipped 1 1/2 to 33 on 1.9
million shares after several analysts, in response to a more
cautious outlook from the company, lowered their earnings
estimate for the fiscal year ending this month and the
following year.</p>
<p>Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Vishnu Swarup, who
lowered his fiscal 1991 forecast for Browning-Ferris by five
cents a share to $2.30, also downgraded the stock's rating to
"hold" from "buy." Mr. Swarup told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report his actions reflected economic weakness in
the Northeast, which produces 12% to 13% of the company's
revenue. He maintained his fiscal 1990 estimate at $2 a
share.</p>
<p>Waste Management, another pollution-control issue, also
was a victim of heavy selling. The stock dipped 3/4 to 35 1/2
in composite trading of about 1.3 million shares. But
ServiceMaster, which agreed to combine certain operations
with two Waste Management units in a partnership, rose 3/4 to
22.</p>
<p>Santa Fe Pacific fell 1/2 to 14 7/8 on 1.9 million shares.
The company said it would swap 14.5 million common shares for
$215.6 million in debentures under an exchange offer which
expires Tuesday.</p>
<p>Gulf States Utilities skidded 1 3/8 to 10 1/8. The Texas
Supreme Court, overturning an earlier appeals-court ruling,
decided that state utility regulators didn't have the
authority to reconsider $1.4 billion in costs related to the
company's River Bend nuclear plant in setting rates.</p>
<p>MNC Financial rose 3/8 to 7 1/8 on 1.3 million shares. Its
board approved plans to sell $180 million in preferred stock
to Alfred Lerner, a director, and maintained the company's
common-stock dividend at 29 cents a share. MNC shares dropped
in heavy trading last week amid rumors that the sale was in
jeopardy and the dividend would be reduced.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.18
to 323.19. Volume totaled 9,260,000 shares.</p>
