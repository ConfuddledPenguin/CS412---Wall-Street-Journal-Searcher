	<p class="article-leader">Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, said it completed
the sale of its soft-drink beverage business to a group led
by management of the unit. Westinghouse also purchased a 15%
interest in the new venture. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Westinghouse, a diversified company with interests in
broadcasting, financial services, community development and
electrical parts distribution, signaled last year that the
beverage group was on the block, as it had been hurt by
pricing competition in the soft-drink industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The beverage group, based in Vernon, Calif., has about
2,000 employees and is the largest bottler of 7-Up. Its
portfolio of brands includes RC Cola, A&W Root Beer, Sunkist
Orange and Hawaiian Punch. It also distributes Seagram's Wine
Coolers, and Perrier and Evian bottled water. Its western
division includes facilities and bottling franchises in
southern and central California; Las Vegas, Nev.; Phoenix and
