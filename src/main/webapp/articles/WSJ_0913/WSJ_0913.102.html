	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The New York Mercantile Exchange said it
started an investigation of false rumor-spreading that may
have resulted in the sharp run-up of crude oil futures prices
Monday.
   In heavy trading in the final 20 minutes of the Nymex
energy futures session, prices of crude oil futures and
petroleum product futures for October surged over $1.60 a
barrel.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An exchange spokeswoman said it had no suspects at this
time, but the offender could be fined as much as $250,000 and
suspended from trading. She added that the exchange would
notify the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the
Justice Department.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman added that based on previous Nymex
investigations there wasn't much confidence anyone would be
charged.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts that were aware of the investigation
doubt that the Nymex would be able to locate and discipline a
culprit.</p>
<p>One trader noted after learning of the investigation that
troop movements inside of Iraq and near Turkish and Syrian
borders were confirmed by the U.S. State Department early
Tuesday. Those movements, and early, limited knowledge of
such activity, he said, could have been the base for the talk
in oil markets Monday.</p>
