	<p class="article-leader">ST. SAUVEUR, Quebec -- If Jacques Hebert's idea catches
on, marketers will have a new way to reach the kind of people
who read corporate annual reports -- ads in corporate annual
reports.
   Mont Saint-Sauveur International Inc.'s 32-page report for
fiscal 1990 features 22 ads -- not counting in-house blurbs.
The ads include messages from Bell Canada, Chrysler Capital
Corp. and two banks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unfortunately for Mont Saint-Sauveur, it had to give the
ads away. That wasn't the original plan, says Mr. Hebert,
chairman and president of the company, which operates ski
resorts in Quebec and Vermont.</p>
<p>The company's first goal was to make the annual report
more interesting. "I'm a chartered accountant, and even I
always thought annual reports were boring," Mr. Hebert says.</p>
<p>The second goal was to cut costs. After deciding to put
out Saint-Sauveur's report in the form of a tabloid-size
newspaper, the inclusion of in-house ads was an obvious idea.
From that point, it wasn't much of a leap to try and really
cut costs by selling ads.</p>
<p>The market wasn't ready. "People resisted the idea," Mr.
Hebert admits. Instead, Mont Saint-Sauveur offered its
suppliers free advertising space. "It may generate more
business," says Newport, Vt., attorney Robert Chimileski of
his ad. But asked if he'd pay, Mr. Chimileski answers, "I
wouldn't think so."</p>
<p>Mont Saint-Sauveur's annual report is probably a first in
Canada, says Grace Lew, who watches annual-report trends for
the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants. The only
thing that came close in Canada is the annual report of a
Toronto-based newspaper publisher; that report used a tabloid
format, but didn't include outside ads.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Saint-Sauveur didn't save a dime, Mr.
Hebert says. This year's effort cost just as much as last
year's more conventional report, about five Canadian dollars
($4.30) a copy. And it was a lot more work. But Mr. Hebert
isn't giving up. "Eventually we'll break even on our annual
report," he says.</p>
