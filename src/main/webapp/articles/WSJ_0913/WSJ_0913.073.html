	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co. said it agreed to
pay Alaska $287 million to settle a 13-year dispute over
royalties due the state from Arco's Alaskan North Slope oil
production.
   The settlement will result in a third-quarter charge of
about $25 million. A large reserve that covers most of the
settlement amount along with other potential liabilities was
set up piecemeal over many years, Arco said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said the charge will have a negligible impact on
third-quarter profit and may be offset by one-time gains,
including a previously announced $300 million legal
settlement with Southern Natural Gas Co. In the year-earlier
quarter, Arco earned $379 million, or $2.19 a share, on
revenue of $3.71 billion.</p>
<p>The settlement agreement includes an approach for
calculating future oil royalties on most of Arco's current
North Slope leases. "This methodology is intended to reduce
the potential for future conflict," said William E. Wade Jr.,
vice chairman of Arco Alaska Inc., an Arco unit.</p>
<p>Alaska Governor Steve Cowper said the settlement "marks
the beginning of a new era of cooperation between the state
and Arco which will mean a more amicable payment system and
which also will lead to increased development on the North
Slope."</p>
<p>Arco said the settlement resolves all major claims
involving its North Slope oil production that were raised by
Alaska State in a 1977 lawsuit, including charges of
negligent misrepresentation, breach of implied covenants of
good faith and fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>"The settlement is fair and isn't an admission of
wrongdoing on our part," an Arco spokesman said.</p>
<p>The company said that 11 other North Slope oil producers
were originally named in the suit, including Chevron U.S.A.,
a unit of Chevron Corp.; BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. and
Standard Alaska Production Co., units of British Petroleum
Inc.; Exxon Corp.; Louisiana Land & Exploration Co.; Mobil
Corp.; FMP Operating Co., a unit of Freeport-McMoran Inc.;
Marathon Oil Co., a unit of USX Corp.; Getty Oil Co., a unit
of Texaco Inc., and Phillips Petroleum Co.</p>
<p>Amerada Hess Corp. settled in December with a $319,000
payment, the state said.</p>
<p>Alaska has been seeking a total of about $902 million from
the oil producers, including $320 million from Arco in
royalties and interest for the period June 1977 through
November 1986. The $287 million settlement encompasses
production through February of this year, Arco said.</p>
<p>"The settlement is a positive in that it eliminates
uncertainty," said L. Eugene Nowack, an analyst at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. He expects Arco to record one-time gains
of roughly $190 million in the third quarter and a slight
increase in operating profit.</p>
<p>In a strong market for oil stocks, Arco shares rose $2.375
to $138.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
