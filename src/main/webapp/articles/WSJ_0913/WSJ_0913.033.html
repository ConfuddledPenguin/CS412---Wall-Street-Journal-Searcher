	<p class="article-leader">When Leo Bouchard of Oakland, Maine, was looking to put
away some money for his children's education five years ago,
he turned to a mutual fund sold by First Investors
Consolidated Corp., which manages $3.6 billion in fund
assets.
   "They made promises like you wouldn't believe," says Mr.
Bouchard, a salesman for a medical-supply company. But he did
believe the salesman who told him: "`You'll make 12.25% on
your money. Guaranteed.' Guaranteed was the word." That was
the pitch, Mr. Bouchard says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mutual funds are legally obliged to send all new investors
a copy of a fund's prospectus, which, among other things, is
supposed to spell out the risks entailed. Mr. Bouchard says
he got no prospectus from First Investors.</p>
<p>Mr. Bouchard, who was new to investing, says that over the
course of 4 1/2 years he put $7,000 into First Investors Fund
for Income, a junk-bond mutual fund. And during that time, he
says, his account was handled by seven or eight different
salespeople. "In one summer, we went through three or four
reps," he says. "They were all young kids."</p>
<p>As it turned out, Mr. Bouchard didn't lose his shirt, but
he did lose $1,000, and this year he sold his stake. "We got
out because the shares were going down and down," he says.
"They said the shares would come back up, but they never
did."</p>
<p>Funds holding junk, or high-yield, bonds haven't fared
well since mid-1989, but the performance of First Investors'
two large junk-bond funds has been especially dismal. And
according to former First Investors salespeople, Mr.
Bouchard's treatment as a client is hardly unique. Others,
too, put up money without fully realizing that they were
buying into a risky deal.</p>
<p>For years, First Investors has used an army of novice
sales representatives to sell junk-bond mutual funds that
have performed poorly while charging sales commissions that
are higher than most junk-bond funds. In making their
pitches, former salespeople say, they often emphasized lavish
dividend yields but talked little about the fact that one
would lose money should share prices decline.</p>
<p>Mutual funds have enjoyed explosive growth in the past
decade, and First Investors has grown with them. The
company's assets under management ballooned from less than
$800 million in 1979 to more than $4 billion in 1989. But
assets have since slipped back to $3.6 billion, and the
company may be in an extended decline.</p>
<p>The first blow came last year with the collapse of the
junk-bond market. Now other problems loom. Sales practices at
the 60-year-old concern are being scrutinized by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and by a passel of state
regulators.</p>
<p>During a two-hour interview, the company's two highest
officers decline to say anything about the investigations.
But First Investors' president, David Grayson, and its
chairman, Glenn Head, each of whom owns 36% of the privately
held company's voting stock, do argue that First Investors'
problems involve little other than the complaints of
disgruntled former employees and a junk-bond market in the
doldrums. "Nobody would have a lot of complaints if they made
a lot of money with us," says Mr. Grayson.</p>
<p>That's the problem. Clients led to believe their
investments carried little risk have been losing money and
are unhappy about it. Furthermore, questions have been raised
about whether First Investors has tried rather too hard to
sell junk-bond funds to credulous investors who don't
understand what they are getting into.</p>
<p>First Investors isn't a typical mutual-fund company. The
firm went into business in 1930 selling -- but not managing
-- mutual funds. By the 1960s, it had become a major
distributor of such venerable funds as Fundamental Investors,
which has since become part of the American Funds Group, and
Wellington Fund, now distributed by Vanguard Group.</p>
<p>First Investors got heavily involved in fund management
only after Mr. Grayson and Mr. Head took it private in a
leveraged buy-out in 1968. Messrs. Grayson and Head also
rapidly expanded the company's sales network. Today First
Investors has 150 offices, up from just 35 in 1968. Though
its sales force of 2,500 can sell other funds, salespeople
say they are told to stick to the company's own products.</p>
<p>Today, First Investors' is trying to compete not so much
with such industry giants as Fidelity Investments or Vanguard
Group, but, rather, with the local bank. Well-rehearsed
salespeople ask potential investors what they are earning on
their savings accounts and certificates of deposit. Then reps
tell prospects about the much higher yields currently
available in First Investors' two large junk-bond funds, its
$982 million Fund for Income and its $648 million High Yield
Fund.</p>
<p>"Their target is middle America," says Brian D. Mahoney,
who for four years worked as a salesman in the company's New
Haven, Conn., office. "The idea is to compare the yield to
passbook savings and CDs."</p>
<p>With a CD, investors get a fixed, predictable return,
whereas the share price on a junk-bond fund fluctuates. But
in a script put together by First Investors employees in
California, salespeople were encouraged to turn the
comparison to their advantage. "Remember how we computed the
yield?" reads the script. "We divided the total dividends
over the last 12 months by the current offering price and got
the rate of return. Well, if the price drops, your yield goes
up] We've created an investment where you win whether the
price goes up or down]"</p>
<p>Shown this script, Mr. Grayson and Mr. Head disavow any
knowledge of it. They say that scripted sales patters were
phased out over the past few years and that earlier this year
the firm sent out a directive to employees that scripts were
no longer to be used. "We were amazed at the number of
scripts going around," says Mr. Grayson, who maintains that
in the scripts distributed by management, salespeople had
been directed to tell investors that rates of return weren't
guaranteed and that share prices would fluctuate.</p>
<p>Lately, most of the share-price fluctuations have been
downward. According to New York's Lipper Analytical Services,
both Fund for Income and High Yield lost more than 11% in the
year that ended June 30, in contrast to a 5.6% loss for the
average junk-bond fund. Fund for Income (known by employees
as Fifi) had a total return of 7.1% a year over the past
decade, making it the 24th poorest-performing junk fund on a
list of 26. "No way should you put money into the high yield
area of First Investors, period," asserts Tyler Jenks,
director of research with Boston's Kanon Bloch Carre & Co., a
mutual-fund research concern. Mutual Fund Values, a
newsletter published by Chicago's Morningstar Inc., gives
First Investors' two junk funds its lowest rating.</p>
<p>Fund for Income's "objective was always yield first,"
concedes Mr. Head. "It's perfectly reasonable to have an
objective of a higher yield," he adds. But last year the
funds changed strategy. "Both Fifi and High Yield became more
conservative in their selection of bonds and their trading of
bonds," says Mr. Head. "This change began to show results in
the second quarter of 1990."</p>
<p>Michael Rukujzo, a former First Investors salesman who
worked in the Chicago office, says most of his clients knew
little or nothing about mutual funds. "Whenever I approached
a client who had any investment experience, I'd never get the
sale," says Mr. Rukujzo, who now works for Kanon Bloch's
brokerage subsidary.</p>
<p>Until the junk-bond market started disintegrating in
mid-1989, some First Investors shareholders say they had no
idea that they had their money in the riskiest sector of the
bond market. Five years ago, a New Yorker named Marvin Rock
put $40,000 into four First Investors funds. But then, eager
to get higher dividends, he moved his entire investment into
Fifi.</p>
<p>"I was under the impression you couldn't lose money," says
Mr. Rock, who was sent a copy of the fund's prospectus but
says he didn't bother to read it because he assumed the fund
was a safe investment. "In the beginning, I didn't even know
the share price could go up and down." By the time Mr. Rock
finally got out of the Fund for Income this past January, his
$40,000 had shrunk to $28,000.</p>
<p>Gary Barkman was a First Investors salesman until he quit
earlier this year. "I was right out of college, just like
most of the people there," recalls Mr. Barkman, who joined
First Investors in October 1984.</p>
<p>After two job interviews, Mr. Barkman was accepted for the
training program. First, he took a two-week course to prepare
for the National Association of Securities Dealers' licensing
exam, which must be passed before one can sell mutual funds.
As sometimes happens in the securities industry, Mr. Barkman
himself had to pay the licensing fee and tuition, which in
his case totaled $287. He then took First Investors' two-week
"product knowledge" class, during which new employees are
expected to write the names of potential customers in their
so-called bankbook. "The homework each night was to come up
with 20 {additional} names," says Mr. Barkman.</p>
<p>The final hurdle: learning the sales pitch. "If you {had}
the script memorized, then you {were} cleared through to talk
to your prospects," says Mr. Barkman. His first customers
were friends and relatives. "I don't know anybody who has
been successful at First Investors who hasn't started there,"
he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Barkman rose swiftly through the ranks, and last year
earned nearly $80,000 in commissions as a manager of the
First Investors' Schenectady, N.Y., office.</p>
<p>"I was the perfect epitome of what the management-training
program could do," he says. In March 1990, Mr. Barkman and 15
other salespeople left First Investors and joined another
securities firm, Capital Growth & Shelter Inc. Now, he says,
"it's hard for me to admit that I worked there."</p>
<p>After Mr. Barkman and the 15 others quit, First Investors
sought a preliminary injunction to keep them from soliciting
business from their old First Investors clients and to bar
them from trying to hire away other First Investors
representatives. The injunction was denied by the New York
Supreme Court, though Mr. Barkman and the others were
compelled to return records that they had taken when they
left their jobs. In a countersuit against First Investors,
Mr. Barkman alleges that his "reputation as a financial
consultant has been irreparably damaged" as a result of
having worked there. He is seeking $10 million in damages.</p>
<p>Mr. Grayson, First Investors' president, estimates that
for every four or five representives who pass the NASD
licensing exam, only one will still be with the company a
year later. Thus, its salesmen are constantly on the lookout
for new recruits, and First Investors even operates an
unusual incentive system under which one salesman who
recruits another can get a cut of the mutual-fund commission
revenue the new guy pulls in and continue to get the cut as
long as he himself works there. "The best reps are normally
brought in by other reps," says Mr. Grayson.</p>
<p>The first sign of trouble for First Investors came last
year, when it was disclosed that the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office were
scrutinizing transactions by Benalder Bayse Jr., who at the
time was manager of First Investors' junk-bond funds. The
current inquiry is focusing on whether Mr. Bayse was given a
personal stake in a Drexel Burnham Lambert partnership in
return for buying securities underwritten by Drexel for the
funds he managed. Mr. Bayse left the employ of First
Investors late last year. Mr. Bayse's lawyer declines to
comment on the inquiry.</p>
<p>People contacted by SEC investigators say the agency has
been looking into First Investors' sales practices, and not
just into Mr. Bayse. The agency declines to comment.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, First Investors' periodic-payment plans
came under fire from Maine's Securities Division. Such
arrangements once were widespread in the industry, but now
only a handful of mutual-fund companies offer them. These
plans are designed to encourage investors to sock away a
small sum of money, say $50 or $100, every month for 10 or 15
years. The commission in the first year can run as high as
50% of what has been invested.</p>
<p>Commissions aren't exorbitant if investors stick with
their plans. But in March, Maine's Securities Division
published a report showing that many First Investors
shareholders dropped out of the plans early. These investors
ended up paying commissions well above the legal maximum
sales charge of 9% of the amount invested. As a result of the
Maine report, other state securities administrators are
scrutinizing periodic-payment plans.</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest threat to First Investors is coming
from a group of four state securities administrators.
Investigators from Georgia, Massachusetts, New York and
Virginia are now investigating the company. Results of the
joint investigation could be made public as early as next
month. Officials from Georgia, Massachusetts and Virginia
decline to comment. A spokesman for the New York attorney
general's office confirms that New York is investigating but
offers no details.</p>
<p>Former salespeople contacted by investigators say the four
states are looking at First Investors' sales practices, in
particular the contents of its sales pitches. They also are
said to be interested in what was taught in First Investors'
training classes and in whether the funds sold were suitable
for clients.</p>
<p>Though First Investors refuses to comment on the
investigations, Mr. Grayson says the company has "definitely
not" been involved in any illegal activities. But the company
says it has nonetheless recently rewritten sales literature
to emphasize investment risks. It says it has also revamped
its training program to impress upon salespeople that the
funds they sell must be suitable based on each client's
willingness to incur risk. The firm says that a year ago it
started calling all new account holders to make sure they
fully understood what sort of funds they had purchased and
what the sales charges are.</p>
