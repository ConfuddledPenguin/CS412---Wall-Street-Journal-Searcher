	<p class="article-leader">The Ford Foundation launched a program to help combat
racism on college campuses.
   The foundation announced $1.6 million in grants to help 19
colleges and universities add courses that deal more directly
with such issues as cultural diversity, ethnic heritage and
racial oppression. The initiative comes at a time when many
campuses -- and the nation as a whole -- are dealing with
outbreaks of racial prejudice and tension.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"To reach the roots of intolerance and improve campus
life, we must make the teaching of non-Western cultures a
basic element of undergraduate education, said Franklin
Thomas, president of the New York foundation. "The minority
population under the age of 18 in the U.S. has risen from 15%
in the 1950s to 36% today, and the number is still growing.
As the face of America changes, education must help American
students learn to live and work together," he said.</p>
<p>Foundation officials said that the grants are just the
first step in what will be a multiyear program involving
other institutions.</p>
