	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Researchers here reported that different cases
of Alzheimer's disease can spring from different causes,
showing that it is a group of closely associated disorders
rather than a single illness.
   The finding complicates the search for the causes of
Alzheimer's disease. But by providing new clues in that
search, it promises to accelerate efforts to understand how
the disease develops, and, perhaps someday, how to ward it
off.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Studies on the disease, which usually affects people over
age 60, are increasingly urgent as the population grows
older. It is the nation's fourth leading killer; an estimated
four million Americans suffer from it, experiencing
progressive memory loss and loss of other mental powers.</p>
<p>Scientists have long suspected that there are different
forms of Alzheimer's disease, which develop in different
ways, but which all lead to the same kind of brain
deterioration. But strong evidence of that hypothesis was
lacking before now, says Peter H. St. George-Hyslop, a
Massachusetts General Hospital researcher who led a 60-person
international team that made the latest discovery.</p>
<p>"This is the first {report of} pretty clear-cut evidence"
that Alzheimer's disease represents "multiple disorders"
rather than a single disease with one cause, he added.</p>
<p>In 1987, a group of researchers, including Dr. St.
George-Hyslop, showed that a gene associated with a
relatively rare, inherited form of the disease -- called
familial Alzheimer's disease, or FAD -- resides on chromosome
21, one of the 23 pairs of coiled DNA that carry genetic
material in human cells. Since then, scientists have been
trying to pinpoint the gene.</p>
<p>The latest discovery, published in today's issue of the
journal Nature, showed that "late-onset" cases of FAD, whose
effects appear after age 65, stem from a cause, or causes,
other than a gene on chromosome 21. That cause may be another
genetic defect. Alternatively, it could involve a nongenetic
factor. Scientists have theorized that viruses, or certain
chemicals, could trigger the disease, perhaps in people with
a genetic predisposition to it. In any case, researchers now
are broadening their studies to look for different genes and
non-genetic factors underlying Alzheimer's disease, Dr. St.
George-Hyslop said.</p>
<p>One of the hottest new leads involves chromosome 19. In
May, researchers at Duke University Medical Center reported
they had found evidence that a gene on chromosome 19 is
associated with common, late-onset Alzheimer's disease. The
Duke team also reported that it had found evidence supporting
the earlier discovery that a gene on chromosome 21 underlies
the inherited "early onset" form of Alzheimer's disease,
which strikes before age 65. The Duke scientists, however,
haven't published details of their findings in a scientific
journal, and the findings haven't yet been confirmed by other
researchers.</p>
<p>Some scientists now believe that all cases of Alzheimer's
disease are caused directly by genes, or by a genetic
predisposition, that makes people vulnerable to suspected
external triggers. According to one variation of the theory,
everyone carries genes that cause Alzheimer's disease, and
all people would get the illness if they lived long enough.</p>
