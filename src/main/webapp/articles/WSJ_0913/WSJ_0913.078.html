	<p class="article-leader">British Aerospace PLC said pretax profit for the first six
months eased 0.7% to #146 million ($270.8 million) from #147
million a year earlier.
   The results, which matched market expectations, were
damped by a #28 million charge related to a prolonged
industrial dispute at the aerospace division of British
Aerospace, which is one of the country's largest industrial
concerns with interests in auto making and property
development.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit after taxes and minority interests, or net profit
attributable to shareholders, was unchanged at #102 million.
Earnings per share eased 0.3% to 35.6 pence from 35.7 pence.
Despite the flat earnings performance, the company said it
will boost its interim dividend to 8.9 pence a share, up 9.9%
from the 8.1 pence paid in the year-earlier first half.</p>
<p>Sales climbed 20% to #4.79 billion from #4 billion a year
earlier.</p>
<p>The company said cost-reduction programs helped profit
margins in several divisions, including both commercial
aircraft and defense equipment.</p>
