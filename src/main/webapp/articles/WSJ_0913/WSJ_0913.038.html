	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- The Canadian Auto Workers union rejected a
contract proposal by the Canadian subsidiary of Ford Motor
Co., and both sides predicted it will be difficult to avert a
strike scheduled to begin tomorrow at midnight.
   Terms of the contract proposal, which covered economic
issues such as wages, vacations and cost-of-living
allowances, weren't disclosed. Both sides referred to the
offer, the first tabled by the company since negotiations
began last week, as a "basis for further discussion."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CAW President Robert White said Ford was moving in the
right direction with its contract proposal. But he said the
amount of money the company was offering was "not even close"
to the union's demands. He said he doubted there was enough
time to reach a settlement before the strike deadline. The
current contract, covering 12,800 Ford workers, expires
tomorrow.</p>
<p>Ford Canada spokesman James Hartford said a tentative
contract agreement before the strike deadline was
"achievable," but only with "considerable effort."</p>
<p>"One of the serious players here is the clock," Mr.
Hartford said.</p>
<p>The CAW began contract talks last Wednesday after
selecting Ford as its strike target. Any contract reached
will serve as a model for later talks with the Canadian
subsidiaries of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.</p>
