	<p class="article-leader">In his Aug. 15 Rule of Law column relating to problems for
Roger and Juliana Pilon, Gordon Crovitz, referring to Michael
Shaheen, the Justice Department ethics chief, suggests Mr.
Shaheen may have issued an erroneous report on the Pilons. He
states, "If Mr. Shaheen issued the annual report despite
knowledge that Mr. Pilon had been cleared, this might be a
case of J. Edgar Shaheen. Mr. Shaheen has been the only
director of the post-Watergate ethics office, which was
formed in 1976. Longevity may breed a dangerous insularity."
   Perhaps Mr. Crovitz's "J. Edgar Shaheen" reference was to
the fact that J. Edgar Hoover was a longtime director of the
FBI. However, the unfortunate sentence structure implies that
Mr. Hoover, too, issued false reports on individuals. I am
not aware of any such charges made about Mr. Hoover.</p>
