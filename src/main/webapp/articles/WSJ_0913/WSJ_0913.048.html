Athena Gold Inc., said they signed a joint venture accord
with Placer Dome U.S. to develop Athena's 19-square-mile
Talapoosa property.

to receive a 51% interest in the overall Talapoosa property.
In return, Placer Dome will spend about $25.5 million to fund
exploration, engineering, and project capital, along with
