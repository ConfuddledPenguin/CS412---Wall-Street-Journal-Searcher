	<p class="article-leader">Troubled Equimark Corp., Pittsburgh, was hit with a
shareholder lawsuit, alleging that the bank-holding company
concealed its bad loans.
   The suit, filed by one shareholder as a class-action
complaint, also alleges Equimark misled the public into
believing it would achieve consistent growth and earnings.
And the suit claims that Equimark overstated its profits for
the past several years by failing to set adequate reserves
for loan losses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An Equimark spokeswoman said she hadn't seen the suit and
couldn't comment on it.</p>
<p>The suit comes one week after Alan S. Fellheimer announced
his resignation as chairman of Equimark. He left amid
criticism for his overly ambitious growth strategy, brusque
management style and mounting losses.</p>
<p>The suit named Mr. Fellheimer and several current and
former executives as defendants, including Mr. Fellheimer's
wife, Judith. Mrs. Fellheimer was a high-ranking executive
who left Equimark earlier this year.</p>
