	<p class="article-leader">TW Holdings Inc. said it is making two prepayments
totaling $70 million on senior debt, reflecting "better than
anticipated" operations.
   TW, which in December 1989 acquired TW Services Inc., the
giant food-services concern with 1989 revenue of $3.5
billion, said a $40 million prepayment made yesterday was
applied to four quarterly principal payments of term A senior
debt, scheduled to begin Dec. 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>TW, a Spartanburg, S.C., provider of food, vending and
medical services said the other $30 million, which it plans
to pay today, will reduce the bridge portion of its senior
bank loan to $267.5 million. The company said it expects to
pay off the balance of the bridge loan by Dec. 1 with
proceeds from planned asset sales and real estate financings.</p>
<p>Karl Sedlarz, vice president and treasurer, said cash flow
has been better than expected, largely because of controls on
capital expenditures and strong revenue, which rose 7.7% in
the six months ended June 30 to $1.8 billion from $1.67
billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>TW owns Canteen, the big contract food and vending
service, Denny's restaurants, and the Quincy's Family
Steakhouse chain, and is the largest franchisee of Hardee's
restaurants.</p>
<p>Coniston Partners, the New York-based investment concern,
and associated parties control TW Holdings.</p>
