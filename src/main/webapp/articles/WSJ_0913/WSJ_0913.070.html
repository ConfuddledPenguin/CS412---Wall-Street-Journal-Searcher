	<p class="article-leader">Kansas Power & Light Co. is the previously unidentified
third party negotiating to rescue Kansas Gas & Electric Co.
from an $857 million hostile bid from another local utility,
according to people familiar with the situation.
   However, the same people said the talks between the two
utilities haven't progressed very far.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>They and some takeover stock traders theorized that
disclosure of the talks late Tuesday by the target, Kansas
Gas & Electric, may have been aimed at getting the first
bidder, Kansas City Power & Light Co., to increase its
$27-a-share offer.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Kansas Gas & Electric's stock rose $1.25 to $25.75
in response to its disclosure after the market closed Tuesday
that it has begun acquisition talks with an unidentified
third party.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Kansas City Power & Light, based in Kansas
City, Mo., asked to be given "equal opportunity with other
parties" to negotiate an acquisition of Wichita-based Kansas
Gas. Kansas Power & Light is based in Topeka.</p>
<p>One reason some traders were skeptical about Kansas
Power's chances of acquiring Kansas Gas is that Kansas Power
carries a somewhat smaller stock-market value than Kansas
Gas. "You've got an $800 million company trying to buy a $1
billion one," said one.</p>
<p>Officials at Kansas G&E and Kansas P&L couldn't be reached
to comment late yesterday.</p>
