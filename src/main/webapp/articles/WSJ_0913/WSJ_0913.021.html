	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's trade surplus for August edged up 3.7%,
as another sharp increase in the surplus with Southeast Asia
offset continued narrowing of surpluses with the U.S. and
European Community.
   The August figures, however, don't reflect the recent jump
in crude-oil prices, the full effect of which isn't likely to
show up before October, Finance Ministry officials said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Finance Ministry said the overall surplus, measured on
a customs-cleared basis, rose to $3.49 billion from $3.37
billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Exports rose 2.6%, to $22.39 billion from $21.82 billion,
representing the third consecutive increase after eight
consecutive monthly declines. Imports edged up 2.4%, to $18.9
billion from $18.46 billion, led by a 23% jump in imports
from the EC.</p>
<p>Adjusted for seasonal factors, the August surplus was
$4.74 billion, little changed from the $4.76 billion surplus
in July.</p>
<p>While some economists had been predicting a renewed
widening of Japan's surplus in the second half of this year,
the recent surge in oil prices makes it increasingly unlikely
that any sharp increase will materialize.</p>
<p>The rise in spot oil prices, to around $30 a barrel from
less than $20 a barrel before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,
could eventually add several hundred million dollars a month
to Japan's import bill. But the dollar value of oil imports
actually slipped 0.5%, to $1.86 billion in August. Finance
Ministry officials explained that it normally takes about two
months for oil-price increases to show up in import
statistics.</p>
<p>Higher oil prices also are likely to sap demand in Japan's
major export markets, economists note.</p>
<p>The modest August increase "confirms there will be no
major recovery in Japanese exports this year -- and you have
the oil whammy" adding to the import bill, said Paul
Summerville, senior economist at Jardine Fleming Japan Ltd.
Japan's balance of payments surpluses are likely to run below
many economists' predictions, he said.</p>
<p>Japan's surplus with the U.S. declined 6% from a year
earlier, to $2.83 billion. Imports declined 1.3% to $4.27
billion. But that was outweighed by a 3.2% drop in exports,
to $7.1 billion.</p>
<p>A softening U.S. economy contributed to shrinkage in
exports of such items as video equipment and
telecommunications equipment, Finance Ministry officials
said. The main factor in the lower imports was a 71% drop in
imports of aircraft, to $91.7 million.</p>
<p>Trade with the rest of Asia continued to boom, however.
Japan's surplus with Southeast Asia and South Korea jumped
75%, to $1.57 billion, as exports of autos, video equipment,
engines and other machinery remained strong. Imports from the
region declined 3.4%, to $5.48 billion. But Mr. Summerville
said imports from the region could pick up if higher oil
prices eat into local demand. Such a development could cause
Southeast Asian producers to redirect output from local
markets to Japan, he said.</p>
<p>The surplus with the EC fell 16%, to $1.13 billion. The
23% jump in imports from the EC came as European producers of
alcoholic beverages, autos and art works continued to find an
increased appetite for their goods among Japanese consumers.</p>
