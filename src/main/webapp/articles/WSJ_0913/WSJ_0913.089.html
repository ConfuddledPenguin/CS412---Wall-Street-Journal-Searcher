	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Since the start of the year, negotiations have
been going on about the possibility of a U.S.-Soviet
passenger airplane venture.
   The little-known talks came to light when Mikhail
Gorbachev was asked by Soviet television what else he and
President Bush discussed, besides the Persian Gulf, at the
Helsinki summit last Sunday. The Soviet president mentioned
the airplane venture.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The planned project involves two Soviet aircraft design
bureaus, Ilyushin and Tupolev, Israel Aircraft Industries
Ltd., and the Pratt & Whitney unit of United Technologies
Corp. The point man for this unlikely team is none other than
the original Russia hand, Armand Hammer, the 92-year-old
chairman and chief executive of Occidental Petroleum Corp.</p>
<p>The plan is to take four-engined Ilyushin Il-96s and
twin-engined Tupolev Tu204s to Tel Aviv, where the Israeli
aerospace concern would outfit them with Pratt & Whitney
engines, U.S. avionic systems and comfortable cabin
interiors. The planes then would be offered for sale
world-wide as cheaper alternatives to Airbus Industrie and
Boeing Co. aircraft.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview yesterday, Dr. Hammer said he
would travel to Moscow next month and hopes to get a firm
contract from President Gorbachev so that a new company he
chairs, Aviation Venture International, can buy the Soviet
airplanes for refitting in Israel and export to the West. "I
have written Mr. Gorbachev about it and I have had
encouraging replies," he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Hammer also said he met with President Bush three
weeks ago and discussed the plan. The president's reaction
was "very favorable," he said.</p>
<p>These refitted-for-export jetliners, which are intended to
compete with the best that Airbus can build, would offer
airlines an alternative to the three big Western
manufacturers -- Airbus, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
-- which are nearly sold out for the next several years, Dr.
Hammer said. They could be flying by 1995 and would cost less
than competing Western models because of lower Soviet and
Israeli labor costs, he said.</p>
<p>However, big problems could lie ahead. Aeroflot, the
Soviet Union's mammoth airline, itself needs nearly all of
the early production of both new models. Western
technology-transfer authorities may balk at letting sensitive
avionic systems go into Soviet-built airplanes. Aviation
specialists say the refitted planes would have to win
certification from exacting U.S. and European air-worthiness
authorities, a potentially large stumbling block. Finally,
they ask, who would supply after-sales support to airlines
that bought the planes?</p>
<p>Israel Aircraft Industries is keeping mum on the subject.
A spokesman in Tel Aviv said the state-owned defense and
aerospace company won't be commenting until "there is a
logical opportunity with a strong profit potential." Israel
and the Soviet Union have no diplomatic relations. But Dr.
Hammer said the company has made five trips to the Soviet
aircraft factories this year and that, under orders from Mr.
Gorbachev, the Israelis were "shown everything."</p>
<p>Aero-engine builder Pratt & Whitney confirmed that it has
been in technical talks for the past several months with the
Ilyushin and Tupolev bureaus about fastening its PW2037
engine on their newest models. "We're pursuing it as a very
serious venture," says a spokesman. The PW2037 currently
flies on Boeing's twin-engined 757.</p>
<p>Dr. Hammer said Aviation Venture International has raised
$2.5 million in startup money for the project from the likes
of British publisher Robert Maxwell, Canadian developer
Albert Reichmann and Israeli businessmen Shaul Eisenberg and
Al Schwimmer. He added that these investors hope to raise $50
million from banks or a public offering next April so that
Aviation Venture International can start buying planes,
engines and avionic systems. With firm orders from airlines,
the venture would then be able to raise more capital from the
public.</p>
<p>Aerospace specialists are enthusiastic about the design of
the long-range Il-96 and the short- to medium-range Tu-204,
both of which are now undergoing flight tests and Soviet
certification. Both have the new "fly-by-wire" cockpit
technology pioneered for civil airliners by Airbus. But the
problem with the existing models, especially for export
prospects, is the engines, a technology in which the Soviets
trail.</p>
<p>Pratt & Whitney says there would be no problems fitting
its PW2037 on the two Soviet jetliners. The company has
gotten U.S. government clearance to talk to the Soviets about
the project, the spokesman said, but it hasn't yet received
export licenses for the engines.</p>
<p>As for prospective buyers apart from Aeroflot, GPA Group
Ltd., the Irish airplane lessor, has said it likes the Tu-204
model and even has talked about buying some with Soviet
engines. No doubt with Western engines and cockpit equipment,
GPA would be even more interested. One GPA manager calls the
project "feasible."</p>
<p>The concept of a joint airplane venture isn't entirely
new. Earlier this year, Ilyushin reportedly had talks with
Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain and other Western
aerospace companies about joint development of an export
model of Ilyushin's new, 60-seat Il-114 turboprop commuter
aircraft.</p>
<p>And there is a precedent of sorts. Gulfstream Aerospace
Corp., a unit of Chrysler Corp., and the Sukhoi Design Bureau
have teamed up on plans for a supersonic business jet. The
two showed a model at the big Farnborough Air Show in Britain
earlier this month.</p>
<p>The first international aerospace exhibition in the Soviet
Union is scheduled to open Sept. 21 in Moscow and interest
from the West is high. More than 200 exhibitors from 15
countries have signed up and 90 Soviet companies will be
represented. The U.S.-Soviet-Israeli project is expected to
be a hot topic at the show.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>GULFSTREAM AEROSPACE Corp. has been sold by Chrysler Corp.
and is no longer a unit of the auto maker. The ownership was
misstated in yesterday's edition.</p>
