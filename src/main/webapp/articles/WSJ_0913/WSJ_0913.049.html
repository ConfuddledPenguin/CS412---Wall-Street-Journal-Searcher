	<p class="article-leader">PITTSFIELD, Mass. -- General Electric Co. confirmed
reports that it is delaying construction of a $2.5 billion
plastics facility in Spain because of weakening world-wide
market conditions.
   The plant was to be near Cartagena on the Mediterranean
coast with completion scheduled for 1992.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokeswoman for the GE Plastics unit said a new
construction schedule is being discussed with the Spanish
government but declined to disclose details. The Spanish
government has donated the site and is to bear 30% of the
cost through subsidies and grants.</p>
<p>Robert Reitzes, an analyst who follows chemicals and
plastics at Mabon Nugent & Co., said rising oil prices since
the Mideast crisis are forcing plastic makers, already
skittish in a weakening economy, to rethink expansion plans.
He cited Union Carbide Co. and Du Pont Co., among several,
considering "indefinite delays."</p>
<p>GE Plastics first announced its plans in October 1988,
saying the investment would total $1.7 billion. In 1989, it
increased the planned investment to $2.5 billion for a larger
manufacturing facility. Since then, the world-wide economy
has softened, especially demand in the automotive market, the
spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>GE expects to export 90% of the plant's output, silicon
sealants for the construction industry and polycarbonate
plastics for autos, and computer consoles. The facility was
to begin production in two to three years from the date of
the initial announcement, with a work force of about 500 and
eventually expanding to 1,500 workers.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said the company's commitment to build the
facility hasn't changed.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>DU PONT Co. and Union Carbide Co. say neither is delaying
nor considering a delay of any plastics plant construction.
In Thursday's edition, an article incorrectly included them
among companies considering such delays.</p>
