	<p class="article-leader">Southeast Banking Corp., Miami, said it completed the sale
of its residential mortgage servicing portfolio and certain
related assets to Sears Mortgage Corp. for $108 million.
   Sears Mortgage, based in Riverwoods, Ill., is a unit of
Coldwell Banker Real Estate Group, which in turn is a unit of
Sears, Roebuck & Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Southeast didn't say how much of a capital gain it will
record on the sale of the $6.7 billion portfolio, but a
spokeswoman said one analyst's estimate of $40 million to $50
million "is in the ballpark."</p>
<p>Ida Roberts, the Southeast spokeswoman, said the company
will give further details of the transaction when it reports
its third-quarter results, probably in the second week of
October.</p>
<p>For Sears Mortgage, the deal gives it a deeper presence in
Florida, a fast-growing market where it previously had nine
loan origination offices. It said the purchase of servicing
rights on the 83,000 loans increased its servicing portfolio
to 190,000 loans totaling $14 billion.</p>
<p>Southeast's move is aimed at shoring up capital at the
banking concern.</p>
