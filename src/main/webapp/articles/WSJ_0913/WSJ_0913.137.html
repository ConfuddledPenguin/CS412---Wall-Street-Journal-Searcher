	<p class="article-leader">Founding shareholders of the troubled Italian chemical
venture Enimont S.p.A. agreed to dissolve the year-old
public-private partnership, Italy's state industry ministry
said.
   Enimont's founders also laid out steps to transfer
ownership of the company, possibly within 30 days, to one of
the two partners, the state energy agency Ente Nazionale
Idrocarburi and Montedison S.p.A., a chemical company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The parties agree that ENI will communicate its offer to
acquire or sell {its Enimont stake} within 15 days . . . and
Montedison will convey its answer within 15 days of the
offer," the ministry statement said. Under guidelines set out
by the government last week, if Montedison refuses to buy the
agency's stake, the government will acquire Montedison's
holding. Each partner owns 40% of Enimont, and minority
shareholders own the remaining 20%.</p>
<p>Profound differences between the two main shareholders
have marred Enimont from its inception, keeping the company
from becoming the model of state-private cooperation it set
out to be.</p>
