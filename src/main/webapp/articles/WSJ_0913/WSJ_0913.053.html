	<p class="article-leader">Short of hiring Sam Spade, is there any way investors can
find out if their financial planner ever went to the slammer,
or their stockbroker really went to Harvard?
   With fraud and other abuses by financial advisers on the
rise, say regulators, it's more important than ever for
investors to check the background of their broker or planner.
A history of disciplinary actions, or discrepancies in an
adviser's credentials, can be a tipoff to potential trouble.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One of the first things investors can do to check out a
financial adviser is to call their state securities
department. (Investors can get local numbers by calling the
North American Securities Administrators Association in
Washington, D.C., at 202-737-0900.)</p>
<p>When you call the state securities department, employees
there can enter the name of an individual or firm into a
50-state computer data base maintained jointly by the North
American Securities Administrators Association and the
National Association of Securities Dealers.</p>
<p>The system, called CRD, for Central Registration
Depository, keeps track of anyone registered to sell
securities in any state. It maintains records on an
individual's education and former employment. It also shows
whether he or she has ever filed for bankruptcy; been the
subject of a complaint by state or federal regulators or the
subject of a legal injunction against doing business, or been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to investment-related
misdemeanors or felonies.</p>
<p>If a broker or financial planner is not listed in the data
base at all, "you've got a problem," says John Perkins, the
Missouri commissioner of securities. It could mean they are
not registered to sell securities.</p>
<p>But, in some circumstances, a person or firm may have a
legitimate reason for not registering. This would include
anyone who doesn't sell investments (such as financial
planners who accept only fees and don't sell investment
products -- a group that comprises about 10% of all financial
planners). Firms that sell commodities, including foreign
currencies, may also be absent from CRD, since they are not
required to register under the securities laws of most
states.</p>
<p>If the CRD computer draws a blank, investors should ask
the firm or person for references from such sources as trade
associations and banks with which they do business. They can
also ask securities regulators for help in identifying other
avenues to investigate, says Missouri's Mr. Perkins.</p>
<p>However, even if a person or firm is registered, and has
no negative information filed, the investor's job isn't done.
Says Mark Maddox, Indiana commissioner of securities: "Simply
because a company is properly registered and has no
disciplinary action doesn't mean a lot these days."</p>
<p>For example, sometimes the information supplied to
investors by state securities departments from the CRD system
isn't always complete or accurate. Recently, a reporter
phoned state securities regulators in four states. She asked
if any negative information existed on a brokerage firm that
had, in fact, been barred from doing business in at least one
state. One state employee said the company wasn't listed in
the CRD system, while two others said the company was listed
but had no disciplinary history.</p>
<p>Also, the securities industry is resisting efforts by
regulators to require that brokers and other advisers
disclose information about pending legal actions against
them.</p>
<p>Because of such limitations, investors may have to make
other inquiries. But other resources may not be much better.
For example, Financial Planning Resource Foundation Inc., a
nonprofit firm in Holland, Pa., claims to have a data base on
"problem" financial planners that is "infinitely better" than
the ones operated by the states, since it pools information
the states generate with information from "law enforcement
agencies and investigating bodies" in the fields of
accounting, banking, insurance and securities.</p>
<p>But when asked how the database gets its information, its
founder, financial planner William Knegendorf, says that
financial planners around the country "mail in
newsclippings." He says the system has no computer ties to
any regulatory group, and so far follows only 35 states
closely. (A recent call to Financial Planning Resource's 900
number, to inquire about a firm that has been included in the
states' CRD system since last spring, drew a blank.) "We
don't claim to be perfect," says Mr. Knegendorf.</p>
<p>Investors who aren't satisfied with the databases at their
disposal, however, can often find out a lot on their own. One
of the best places to start is by checking the references and
credentials of one's financial adviser.</p>
<p>That's what 83-year-old Florida investor Hobart C. Reid
did. Last June, he says, a broker with Group America, an
Agoura Hills, Calif., firm that sells commodities over the
phone, persuaded him to invest $30,000 in Swiss francs and
Deutsche marks.</p>
<p>But after he invested, Mr. Reid, a retired graphic artist,
had second thoughts. He called Delaware Trust, the bank his
broker said was holding the currencies. When bank officials
told him they did no business with Group America, Mr. Reid
says he called his broker at Group America, who told him that
a "mistake" had been made. Mr. Reid then received a document
that indicated that his investment was being held by Merrill
Lynch & Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Reid says he felt reassured by this, but decided to
check with Merrill Lynch anyway. He gave the document he
received to a Merrill Lynch broker, who forwarded it to
internal investigators in New York. Merrill says it found
that Group America did not have a connection to Merrill.</p>
<p>Mr. Reid says he then got a call from Bill Whitely, Group
America's president. "They said would I be satisfied if I got
my money back. I said heck yes. They sent it Federal
Express."</p>
<p>Mr. Whitely of Group America says that the reference to
Merrill Lynch on the statement sent to Mr. Reid was a
computer mistake.</p>
<p>Regulators say Mr. Reid's investigatory tenacity may have
helped him in his getting his money back. "Squeaky wheels --
they pay off," says Bill McDonald, assistant commissioner of
the California Department of Corporations. Still, he adds,
referring to Mr. Reid, it's better if investors do the
checkups before they invest.</p>
