	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck & Co. hopes to boost sales to
charge-card customers by offering cash certificates that can
be applied to future purchases.
   The retailing and financial services concern, struggling
to reverse years of sagging earnings, is introducing the
"frequent shopper" program in time for the Christmas season.
With a recession looming, executives also hope the program
will increase their store's appeal to cautious consumers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It won't be tremendously significant, but it will be a
plus," said Laurence Cudmore, Sears retail president.</p>
<p>But others aren't so sure. "I don't see it as a real
strong incentive" for shoppers, said Kurt Peters, editor of a
trade publication called Credit Card News.</p>
<p>The reason: Sears is offering customers who accumulate at
least $200 in purchases on their cards certificates valued at
1% of those purchases. The average Sears charge-card customer
spends $300 to $400 a year, meaning a bonus of $3 or $4.</p>
<p>Mr. Cudmore acknowledged that the bonus doesn't seem
substantial. But he said when the program was tested in
Baltimore and Pittsburgh, Sears found "a very definite
difference in performance (at stores in the pilot program)
versus the control stores."</p>
<p>He declined to estimate how much the program might cost
Sears. Sears has 40 million charge-card accounts, but it
considers only 26 million of them active. A spokeswoman said
the bonus club, which starts Saturday, could help Sears
attract customers who haven't shopped its stores in a while.</p>
