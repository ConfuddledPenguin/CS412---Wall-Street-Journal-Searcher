	<p class="article-leader">CARACAS -- Venezuelan non-oil exports have jumped 55%
since last year, the government said.
   The country exported more than $2.3 billion in non-oil
products from January through August 1990, up from $1.5
billion in the year-earlier period, the Central Office of
Statistics and Information said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Venezuela exported $260 million in non-oil goods last
month, the highest level since March.</p>
<p>The government has been trying to encourage the
non-traditional exports by allowing the local currency, the
bolivar, to devalue. The currency has gone from an average of
about 38 bolivares to the dollar in 1989 to a current 49
bolivares.</p>
<p>Nearly 90% of Venezuela's export income comes from oil
sales.</p>
