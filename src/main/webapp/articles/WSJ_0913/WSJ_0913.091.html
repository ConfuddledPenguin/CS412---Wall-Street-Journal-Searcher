	<p class="article-leader">Your Aug. 17 page-one story "Energy Options" concentrates
so much on short-term oil displacement that it ignores the
great contributions that have already been made by nuclear
energy in replacing foreign oil in the generation of
electricity. You fail to recognize that U.S. nuclear-energy
plants have reduced dependence on foreign oil since the 1973
oil embargo by 4.3 billion barrels and continue to cut our
use of foreign oil by 740,000 barrels every day. This is just
about the amount we had been importing from Iraq and Kuwait
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   Construction of nuclear-energy plants to supply
electricity was a major part of this nation's efforts to use
domestic sources of energy to avoid its increasing dependence
on foreign oil after the 1973 embargo. We've forgotten that
lesson and, apparently, must relearn it.</p>

<p>You dismiss renewable energy as "far-fetched alternatives"
that aren't economically viable. One need only look at
California's use of renewable energy resources last year to
see that these statements are completely untrue. In 1989,
18.2% of all electrical energy used in California came from
renewable energy resources. As one of those renewable
technologies, we believe that solar electric generating
systems (SEGS) are neither far-fetched nor uneconomical. As a
matter of fact, our newest 80-megawatt SEGS plant is
currently providing Southern California Edison electricity at
a cost of eight cents a kilowatt hour. This cost is cheaper
than nuclear and almost competitive with oil and gas.</p>
