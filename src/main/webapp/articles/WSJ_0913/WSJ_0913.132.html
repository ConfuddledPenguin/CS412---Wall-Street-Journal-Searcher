	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate adopted a mandatory fish
inspection plan that would put the nation's $30 billion
seafood industry under a triad of regulatory agencies.
   The landmark food-safety measure was approved by voice
vote after lawmakers voted, 59-39, to reject a rival
inspection plan favored by the Bush administration. The
measure, sponsored by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
(D., Maine), would give the Agriculture Department the lead
in inspecting 1,900 processors nationwide. Currently, only a
fraction of four billion pounds of fish and shellfish
consumed each year in the U.S. undergoes some form of
product-grading or inspection.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"No longer will consumers have to guess whether or not the
fish they eat is safe," said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.),
floor manager of the bill. "For the first time, they will be
able to buy seafood with the USDA's seal of approval."</p>
<p>Defeated was the proposal by Sens. Ernest Hollings (D.,
S.C.), Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and Ted Stevens (R.,
Alaska) to give the inspection duties to the Food and Drug
Administration and the Commerce Department. In floor debate,
Sen. Mitchell successfully argued that the lack of a lead
agency "would muddle lines of authority and accountability,
making the {joint} program unworkable and incapable of
protecting public health."</p>
<p>Under the Mitchell-Leahy bill, the Agriculture
Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service would conduct
the seafood inspections, the FDA would set limits for
bacteria and other contaminants, while the Commerce
Department's National Marine Fisheries Service would continue
to oversee the nation's fisheries, including closing polluted
waters to fishing and shellfish harvesting.</p>
<p>Awaiting floor action in the House are rival fish
inspection bills pushed by Agriculture Committee Chairman
Kika de la Garza (D., Texas) and by Commerce Committee
Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.). They are engaged in battle
over turf, just as their Senate counterparts, Messrs. Leahy
and Hollings, have been. Mr. de la Garza would give the lead
to the Agriculture Department, which falls under his panel's
jurisdiction, while Mr. Dingell favors the FDA, which his
committee oversees.</p>
<p>Mr. Mitchell is expected to urge the House Democratic
leaders to expedite a vote on seafood-inspection legislation.
Backers of the Mitchell-Leahy bill have indicated a
willingness to accept a compromise measure. By giving the FDA
an expanded role, they hope to win over Mr. Dingell and avert
a presidential veto, which has been threatened by the White
House.</p>
<p>For the consumer movement, however, last night's vote,
coming after more than 20 years of failed legislative
initiatives, was a mixed victory. The safe-food coalition
split over fish inspection, with Public Voice for Food and
Health Policy supporting the Mitchell-Leahy measure and most
other consumer groups favoring the Hollings-Kennedy-Stevens
bill.</p>
<p>The bone of contention is whistle-blower protection. Under
the Mitchell-Leahy bill, there wouldn't be continuous
inspection of seafood processing plants. Instead, inspectors
would make random visits at the plants and rely on plant
workers for tips on improper or unsanitary pratices when the
inspectors aren't there.</p>
<p>For this reason, most consumer groups supported the
Hollings-Kennedy-Stevens measure because it would have
protected whistle-blowers from reprisals by their employers.
Aides to Sen. Leahy said that whistle-blower protections will
be added to the Mitchell-Leahy bill when it goes to
conference.</p>
