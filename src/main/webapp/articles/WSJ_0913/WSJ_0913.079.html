	<p class="article-leader">FORT WORTH -- American Airlines said it sued the Federal
Aviation Administration to block an agency decision yesterday
that would allow rival United Airlines to change certain
flight schedules at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.
   The suit, filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington, is the latest development in a running spat
between the two carriers over schedules at O'Hare, one of the
nation's busiest airports. The two carriers and affiliated
commuter lines account for 80% of the traffic there.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last month, American was granted a temporary restraining
order barring United from publishing new schedules for that
airport. A hearing is set for Sept. 17. In its latest suit,
American said, the appeals court ordered filings by both
sides by Sept. 19. American is a unit of AMR Corp.; United is
a unit of UAL Corp.</p>
<p>The latest round was kicked off yesterday when the FAA
announced it was authorizing United to move certain evening
flights away from time periods into which American had
recently moved flights. The FAA said United's changes would
reduce anticipated delays and air traffic controller
workloads in those periods. The authorization would take
effect Oct. 1 and expire Jan. 15, 1991.</p>
<p>The seeds of the scrap were planted last March, when
American and United at the behest of the FAA agreed to accept
certain scheduling restrictions to reduce congestion at
O'Hare. In June, American told the FAA that it was
withdrawing from the arrangement because it was suffering
competitively and was rescheduling some evening flights
within the flexibility allowed under its official "slots." A
"slot" is an assigned block of time in which an aircraft is
supposed to arrive or depart.</p>
<p>United then proposed moving some of its flights, but to
times not included in its formal "slots," which triggered
American's opposition. American said the new times would give
United an unfair competitive edge.</p>
