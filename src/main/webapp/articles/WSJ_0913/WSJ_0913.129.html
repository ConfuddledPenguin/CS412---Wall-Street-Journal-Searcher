	<p class="article-leader">Already reeling from the enormity of the thrift bailout,
Congress appears likely to give regulators the authority to
boost bank-deposit insurance premiums, probably before its
current session ends.
   But bank experts worry that the lawmakers may overreact
and argue that increasing the insurance premiums carries
risks of its own.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Congressional Budget Office told the Senate Banking
Committee that, given current trends, it expects 600 to 700
bank failures to occur by 1993, dragging the insurance fund
down to about $4 billion, its lowest point ever, from its
current $13.2 billion. (There are 13,200 commercial banks and
mutual savings banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.) A similar report warning of weakness in the insurance
fund was issued by the General Accounting Office Tuesday.</p>
<p>The two reports leave the impression that the banking
industry is in worse shape than it really is, bank analysts
say. The banking industry is expected to lobby hard against
another rise in the premiums they pay, arguing that Congress
is overreacting to avoid any potential recriminations if
conditions do worsen.</p>
<p>Lobbyists for the industry attributed the reports to a
Congress shaken to its core by the savings and loan bailout.
"The GAO numbers aren't a surprise to people who've been
studying this for a time," said Robert Dugger, chief
economist for the American Bankers Association. "But I think
there is a lot of alarming rhetoric being associated with
it."</p>
<p>The lobbyists, and even the government auditors, note that
a premium increase carries risks of its own, including a
possible worsening of the credit crunch. "An overreaction by
Congress or the regulators could result in further downward
pressure in these already weak economic areas," said Mr.
Dugger.</p>
<p>Real estate loans, especially in the Northeast, and the
increasing cash flow problems of many highly leveraged
companies in the face of a possible recession are clearly
worrisome. But most analysts say a repeat of the thrift
industry collapse is not likely for banks, especially as
commercial banks are much better capitalized as a group and
are still earning decent profits for the most part.</p>
<p>And although it is tough for banks to raise long-term debt
and equity, short-term funds are still readily available for
all but the handful of large troubled banks, said Gregory
Root, president of Keefe BankWatch, a bank rating agency
followed closely by money market investors.</p>
<p>Anxiety over the bank fund has Congress and the
administration in agreement that the regulators should be
permitted to raise bank insurance premiums. The Treasury
Department, which had kept its silence as it prepares a
deposit insurance reform package at year end, said it will
introduce narrow legislation designed for speedy passage.
Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the Senate
Banking Committee and Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas),
chairman of the House Banking Committee, also have endorsed
the idea.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, failure to enact such legislation before
Congress adjourns in October could leave the FDIC powerless
to take actions that may be necessary to protect the bank
insurance fund should the economy continue to slow this
winter," said Sen. Riegle.</p>
<p>Congress, facing scathing S&L criticism, is likely to act
soon to increase the insurance premium authority. "We'd fool
ourselves if we thought there wasn't going to be plenty of
problems in the banks," said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.),
a member of the House Banking Committee. "It might be better
to make the banks pay more now than have the taxpayers pay
later."</p>
<p>The FDIC has already raised insurance premiums to the
statutory limit, including a recently announced 4.5-cent
increase for each $100 of deposits, which will take effect
next year. This represented 7.3% of the industry's 1989 net
income of $15 billion, after nonrecurring gains. After the
increase, the banks will pay 19.5 cents a year per $100 of
deposits.</p>
<p>Regulators aren't yet saying what they would do with
broader authority to raise insurance premiums. "We'll be
studying it, obviously," said William Seidman, chairman of
the FDIC, which manages both the bank and thrift deposit
insurance funds. Mr. Seidman recently wrote to Mr. Gonzalez
endorsing the plan to allow greater flexibility with
premiums.</p>
<p>What makes the reports this week seem ominous for banks is
that the publicity generated did not note that the FDIC fund
covers many large mutual savings banks, which are owned by
their depositors and are part of the thrift industry.
Analysts say there is a greater chance of several large
savings banks failing in the near future than big commercial
banks. Indeed, analysts say the picture is not nearly as
bleak for the commercial banking industry.</p>
<p>Helping to bolster the banking industry through its
growing problems, says James McDermott, director of research
at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, is its access to relatively
inexpensive deposits. Many banks are buying the deposits of
failed savings institutions at less than it costs to purchase
funds in the open market.</p>
<p>Consultant William Isaac, a former FDIC chairman, suggests
several alternatives to a premium increase. One would be a
special premium of 1% of deposits that banks would turn over
to the FDIC to get the fund up to 1.7% of total deposits.
That extra premium would pay interest to the banks and be
refunded once the fund reached the desired level of 1.25% of
deposits on its own. He also suggests diverting to the FDIC
fund the money earned by the Federal Reserve for the
non-interest bearing reserves banks now keep at the Fed.
Currently the $15 billion or more earned each year on those
reserves are turned over to the Treasury.</p>
<p>The deposit insurance fund isn't in as much imminent
danger as the new warnings would indicate, says the FDIC's
John Bovenzi, deputy to Mr. Seidman. Mr. Bovenzi said his
agency "has a problem" with the GAO saying that the $13.2
billion FDIC fund could be tapped for $8 billion of
liabilities from previous Southwest bank failures. Those
assets, composed mostly of problem loans that are being
managed by solvent financial institutions, have already been
marked to market, that is, their losses have already been
reflected by the fund.</p>
