	<p class="article-leader">Occidental Petroleum Corp. said it agreed to pay about $45
million as part of a plan to clean up a hazardous waste
landfill in Niagara Falls, N.Y.
   The plan, proposed in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y.,
calls for Occidental to build and operate for about $25
million a containment and waste-extraction system at the
S-Area landfill, which was operated by Hooker Chemical Co.,
acquired by Occidental in 1968. The site is where 63,000 tons
of hazardous waste were disposed, according to the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. The system is expected to be
completed in 1996.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, Los Angeles based Occidental has agreed to
spend $64.9 million over a 20-year period to build with the
city a new $67.8 million drinking water treatment plant on a
site adjacent to the landfill, according to Thomas L.
Jennings, vice president for environmental affairs at
Occidental's chemical operations. These funds were diverted
from a plan to clean up the existing water plant on the same
site.</p>
<p>Aside from Occidental Chemical Corp. and the EPA, other
parties to the agreement are the U.S. Department of Justice
and New York state departments of environmental conservation,
law, health and the city of Niagara Falls.</p>
