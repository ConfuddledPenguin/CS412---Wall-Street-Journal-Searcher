	<p class="article-leader">A Republican President, George Bush, and a U.S. Congress
controlled by Democrats stood together Wednesday night. For
those of us who have watched U.S. foreign policy degrade over
25 years into a recent condition of almost reflexive,
corrosive partisanship -- from Vietnam through the trial of
Oliver North -- Wednesday evening's display of solidarity was
extraordinary. In replying to the President's speech, House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt said, "Here at home, a sense
of unity and the absence of widespread opposition to this
action in the Persian Gulf, testify to our powerful,
instinctive feeling that this is a cause worth standing and
fighting for." Similar sentiments suffused Mr. Gephardt's
speech.
   It is no doubt possible to explain Mr. Gephardt's remarks
in terms of normal political calculation. American troops are
in the Gulf and at risk, and it is late in the day to start
carping about the President's actions. Congressional
elections are two months off. However, it is also possible
that those of us who get paid to chronicle the daily mayhem
of Washington's picaresque world sometimes are liable to miss
the larger turns in the political temper.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Vermont Royster, this paper's former editor and its
historical memory, called us from North Carolina yesterday to
suggest that just such a turn may have taken place on
America's television screens Wednesday night. Mr. Royster
said the atmosphere of the evening drew to mind memories of
December 8, 1941, the day after Pearl Harbor, when President
Roosevelt went before Congress to seek a declaration of war
against Japan. The Senate voted it unanimously and the House
by 388 to 1, thereby putting to rest the deep political
divisions of the previous decade over the question of
American isolationism from the world's troubles.</p>
<p>As in our time, with the War Powers Resolution and the
Nicaraguan-directed Boland amendments, Congress in the 1930s
passed a series of Neutrality Acts to circumscribe the
President's freedom to act in foreign affairs. Predictably,
these legislative interventions proved to be clumsy and
unwieldy instruments. Each made the formation and execution
of American policy difficult. Some welcomed that result. But
America's allies surely did not, instead seeing these
seemingly endless tensions as a formula for uncertain and
incoherent U.S. policy.</p>
<p>It of course remains to be seen whether the current
entente on foreign policy is lasting. A new defense bill will
soon be debated by the Congress, and even in the midst of
this historic moment there is no assurance that the
Democratic leadership can prevent defense from being
irrationally pulled apart by the party's left wing or the
usual pork barrelers. Yet there is reason to hope that a
workable bipartisan coherence on foreign affairs may yet
develop.</p>
<p>The Bush administration's recurring reference to the need
to create a new, civilized world order in the wake of the
Cold War found its echo in Mr. Gephardt's remarks: "We can
see beyond the present shadows of war in the Middle East to a
new world order where the strong work together to deter and
stop aggression. This was precisely Franklin Roosevelt's and
Winston Churchill's vision for peace for the postwar period."</p>
<p>If indeed Republicans and Democrats are ready to turn the
page on more than two decades of acrimony in U.S. foreign
policy, the world's movement toward Roosevelt's and
Churchill's vision, interrupted at its creation for more than
40 years, may commence again. We shall see.</p>
