	<p class="article-leader">Bouygues S.A. said a unit has received a 20-year contract
valued at 2 billion French francs ($376.1 million) annually
to manage the Ivory Coast's electricity distribution system.
   The French construction and public works group said La
Saur S.A., which specializes in electricity distribution and
is one of the largest water management companies in France,
also agreed to invest about 100 million francs to update the
West African country's electricity network and pay debt
accrued by Cie. Ivoirienne d'Electricite.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The group said La Saur will request technical assistance
from Electricite de France International, a branch of the
French state-run electricity company.</p>
<p>A Bouygues official said the contract grew out of the
Ivory Coast's need to supply the necessary expansion and
maintenance investments required in the electrical sector.
The country's population is projected to increase to 20
million by 2000 from about 14 million currently.</p>
<p>The group said the contract will boost La Saur's annual
revenue to about 6 billion francs this year.</p>
