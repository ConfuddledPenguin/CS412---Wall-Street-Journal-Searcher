	<p class="article-leader">BTR PLC, one of Britain's largest industrial
conglomerates, reported a 6.6% rise in pretax profit for the
first half of the year and said it would issue one free bonus
warrant for every 15 shares held.
   The profit before tax of #530 million ($984.7 million),
from #497 million a year earlier, was at the lower end of
market forecasts, which ranged from #525 million to #550
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BTR set the exercise price of the warrants at 370 pence.
If all the warrants are exercised in the allowed periods in
1994 and 1995, they would add 116 million shares to the
company's current 1.75 billion ordinary shares in circulation
and raise #429 million in capital.</p>
<p>Profit after tax, less minorities, rose 6.7% to #302
million from #283 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings
improved 5.5% to 17.4 pence from 16.5 pence.</p>
<p>Net profit attributable to shareholders, however, fell
7.9% to #302 million from #328 million. BTR didn't report any
extraordinary items in the half-year, although in the
previous period the company had a #45 million extraordinary
gain from the proceeds of its sale of National Tyre, a tire
and car replacement parts distributor, for #140 million.</p>
<p>Sales were up 2.5% to #3.47 billion from #3.39 billion.</p>
