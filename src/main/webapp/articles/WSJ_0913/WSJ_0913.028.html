	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Budget negotiators labored to overcome
differences on taxes and on how to enforce a
deficit-reduction accord as the bipartisan talks continued.
   Among the crucial unresolved issues were the Republicans'
demand for lower capital-gains taxes and the Democrats'
insistence that any such tax cut be combined with an increase
in income-tax rates for upper-income Americans, people close
to the talks said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, there was some tangible progress as the
administration accepted a new 10% tax on the purchase of
luxury items, a proposal advanced by the Democrats.</p>
<p>Negotiators, who had hoped to reach an accord by this
morning, said they see little chance of reaching agreement
before tomorrow. House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) said
he expects an agreement before week's end.</p>
<p>Rep. Foley said Democrats will find it "extremely
difficult" to agree to a capital-gains cut unless it is
accompanied by higher income-tax rates "or some comparable
action." He didn't elaborate on what alternatives to higher
rates might be acceptable.</p>
<p>"I don't sense any great hostility" to capital gains, said
Republican negotiator Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota. "The
problem is the price." He and other Republicans said they
won't go along with increased tax rates.</p>
<p>Although there had been speculation that the
administration might back off its proposal to cut
capital-gains tax rates, President Bush underscored his
commitment to the idea in his speech to Congress.</p>
<p>Both the administration and congressional Republicans have
emphasized the importance of changing the congressional
budget process to assure that any agreement is carried out.
Changes in taxes and benefit programs can be written into
law, but some other mechanism is being sought to limit other
domestic spending and defense spending, which are subject to
annual appropriations bills.</p>
<p>Some Democrats, particularly Senate Appropriations
Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), have resisted any
attempt to tie their hands for more than one year. The
initial Democratic offer made last week said the
appropriations committee would honor any ceiling on overall
spending, but would consider as "advisory only" any attempt
to set totals for defense and non-defense spending beyond
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1.</p>
<p>To meet their goal of reducing the deficit $500 billion in
five years, negotiators are converging on a plan that would
result in a net tax increase of about $130 billion. People
close to the talks said the tax package would probably
contain higher energy taxes, including an increase in the
gasoline tax, higher taxes on alcoholic beverages and an
extension of the 1.45% Medicare payroll tax to cover wages
above the current $51,300 ceiling. Tax breaks to encourage
oil exploration probably will be a part of any accord, they
added.</p>
<p>In one of its latest offers, the administration proposed
four new taxes that would raise $2.5 billion in fiscal 1991
and more than $24 billion over the five-year period. The
largest of these taxes is a one-cent-agallon tax on refined
petroleum products that would raise about $1 billion in the
first year and $8 billion over five years.</p>
<p>The GOP and White House also would impose a luxury tax
that would raise $900 million in the first year and $7.8
billion over five years. This closely matches a Democratic
proposal for a new tax on purchases of luxury items. The
Republicans' 10% luxury tax would be imposed on automobiles
that cost more than $30,000, boats that cost more than
$30,000, electronics of more than $1,000, jewelry of more
than $5,000, and furs of more than $500.</p>
<p>In addition, the Republican would index to inflation a
variety of excise taxes and would accept a tax on
ozone-depleting chemicals similar to one proposed by the
Democrats.</p>
<p>Defense spending would be cut between $170 billion and
$200 billion from projected levels over five years, based on
offers made by the two sides. Domestic spending of all sorts
would be trimmed between $103 billion and $126 billion, with
both sides proposing to make the elderly pay more of the cost
of Medicare.</p>
<p>The American Association of Retired Persons, recalling the
uproar that led Congress to repeal a surtax on upper-income
elderly that was to pay for an expansion of Medicare to cover
catastrophic illness, objected to proposals to increase
Medicare premiums for upper-income people. "It is
catastrophic without the benefits," the group said.</p>
