prices on several 1991 models as much as 7.2%, although it is
freezing prices on some versions.
   The biggest price increase is on the Prelude 2.0 Si. The
1991 model will have a base price of $14,945, up 7.2% from a
year earlier. Honda said spokesmen weren't immediately
available to comment on the reason for the move.</p>

expensive Prelude, the Si four-speed equipped with automatic
transmission, 4.9% to $19,450. Honda said it will also raise
the base price on its 1991 Civic three-door hatchback to
$6,895, up 3.9% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The auto maker isn't changing prices on some other 1991
models, including the CRX HF and the CRX Si.</p>
<p>Honda said that, on average, its 1991-model base reflect
an increase of 1%, or $140 a car. That average includes a

the U.S. Its base price, announced earlier, will increase
$200, or 1.6%, from the 1990 model.</p>
