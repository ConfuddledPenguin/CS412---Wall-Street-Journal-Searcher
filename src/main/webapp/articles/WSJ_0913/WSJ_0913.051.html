	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Drought and searing heat have dealt the
Southeast peanut crop a double wallop that is expected to
have an estimated $575 million economic impact on a
three-state region and to drive up consumer prices for peanut
products, especially peanut butter.
   The region -- which includes Georgia, Florida, and Alabama
and produces 65% of U.S. peanuts -- is bracing for its worst
crop in 10 years. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture
statistics, the region will reap 2.04 billion pounds of
peanuts, down 23% from last year and 24% below an Aug. 1
forecast.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Peanut Advisory Board, a trade association, said
peanut prices increased 12%, to $731 a ton, in the past week
and may go higher, depending on weather and crop conditions
through next month. The board said the direct loss to farmers
will be about $150 million; the balance of the estimated $575
million loss will be felt by shellers and others in related
businesses.</p>
<p>The two other areas that are big producers of peanuts --
the Virginia and North Carolina region and the region of New
Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas -- are expected to enjoy increases
in crop output of 15% and 10%, respectively over last year,
but not enough to make up the loss from the Southeast. The
USDA said this year's U.S. crop is expected to be 3.56
billion pounds, down 11%.</p>
<p>Prices of peanut butter are expected to rise the most,
because it is made from the type of peanuts grown in the
Southeast, the Peanut Advisory Board said. It estimates
consumer peanut-butter prices will go up 10% by January.</p>
