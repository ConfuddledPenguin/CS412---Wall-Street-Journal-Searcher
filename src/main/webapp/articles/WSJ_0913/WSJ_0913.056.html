	<p class="article-leader">TROY, Mich. -- K mart Corp. plans to ditch its familiar
red and turquoise signs in favor of a new logo.
   Chairman Joseph Antonini acknowledged that changing a
symbol as well known as K mart's is risky because it could
alienate shoppers. But, he said, "We wanted to signify the
changes taking place inside the store. This is what we have
to do."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new logo, which will appear in ads as well as signs at
all 2,231 K mart stores by 1995, features a big red "K." The
word "mart" is written in smaller white script inside the K.
It was designed by Anspach, Grossman, Portugal Inc., New
York.</p>
<p>Retailing and image consultants have contended for some
time that the old logo conveyed the impression that K mart
hadn't changed much since its early discounting days in the
1960s, when it attracted shoppers with low-priced light
bulbs, hangers and other odds and ends. Nowadays, K mart
sells more stylish apparel and home goods. And it just
embarked on a massive $2.3 billion store renovation program
to enlarge its outlets, widen aisles and improve its
displays.</p>
<p>Mr. Antonini defended the logo change. "Our research
showed you could do anything you wanted with the mart," he
said, "but don't lose that big red K."</p>
