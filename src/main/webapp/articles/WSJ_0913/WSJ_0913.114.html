	<p class="article-leader">DOWNERS GROVE, Ill. -- ServiceMaster L.P. and Waste
Management Inc. agreed in principle to form a new pest
control, cleaning service and lawn-care joint venture by
combining operations with total revenue of about $920
million.
   The two suburban Chicago companies said the venture, to be
known as ServiceMaster Consumer Services Limited Partnership,
will operate as a unit of ServiceMaster.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The planned partnership will consist of Waste Management's
pest-control business and TruGreen lawn-care business.
ServiceMaster will contribute its consumer services business,
including its residential and commercial cleaning services,
the Terminix termite and pest control businesses, the Merry
Maids maid business and the American Home Shield home
warranty business.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for Waste Management to receive common
equity in the partnership representing 20% of the total
equity and a preferred interest convertible into another 2.1%
of the common equity of the partnership, according to the
companies. ServiceMaster will initially hold 80% of the
common equity.</p>
<p>The two businesses that Waste Management is contributing
had 1989 revenue of $170 million, and ServiceMaster's
contribution of a mix of franchise and company run businesses
had over $750 million in consumer level revenue for the same
period.</p>
<p>Waste Management said it valued the two businesses it
contributed, and the value of the partnership interest and
convertible preferred it will receive, at about $180 million,
giving the venture an indicated total value of about $818
million.</p>
<p>ServiceMaster, a health care and cleaning concern which
had $1.5 billion in revenue last year, said the partnership
was "a great addition" that would make Terminix the leading
pest control business in the country.</p>
<p>For Waste Management, the nation's largest collector of
municipal garbage with over $4.4 billion in revenue, the
agreement will rid the company of the responsibility of
running its consumer services business, while maintaining an
equity position.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, ServiceMaster and Waste Management
will develop and participate in joint marketing efforts in
both the consumer services and management services areas.
Waste Management will be represented on the venture's board,
but won't participate in day-to-day management.</p>
<p>"We're going to continue to focus on environmental
services and ServiceMaster is going to focus on consumer
services, and our shareholders will participate," in earnings
from the operations it is contributing, said a Waste
Management spokesman. "That's why we didn't sell" the
operations, he added.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to approval of both company's
boards. The companies said they expect to reach a definitive
agreement by the end of the year.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, ServiceMaster closed at $22, up 75 cents, and Waste
Management closed at $35.50, down 75 cents.</p>
