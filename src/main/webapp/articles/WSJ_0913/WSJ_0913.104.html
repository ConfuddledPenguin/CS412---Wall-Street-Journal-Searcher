	<p class="article-leader">Bertelsmann AG expects its profit to edge about 3.9%
higher in the fiscal year ending next June 30 to 530 million
marks ($333 million) on a 3% sales gain to around 13.7
billion marks.
   Executives at the West German media giant also said
Bertelsmann is moving ahead in establishing a bridgehead in
Eastern Europe for its book clubs, newspapers, magazines,
entertainment and electronic media activities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The closely held company reported that its profit in the
fiscal year ending June 30 rose 26.9% from a year earlier to
510 million marks from 402 million marks. Sales were up 6.4%
to 13.3 billion marks from 12.5 billion marks.</p>
<p>In the U.S., where the company derives about one-third of
its global sales, Bertelsmann has made a "turnaround" at
previously struggling operations, like the New York-based
Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group, Chairman Mark
Woessner said.</p>
<p>Mr. Woessner said that the company is still looking for a
partner to launch another U.S. record label. The company
intends to build up its global market share in music, by
means of linking up with other companies in international
entertainment ventures.</p>
