	<p class="article-leader">Coca-Cola is no longer the only brand that can teach the
world to sing, a new study says. Along with the ubiquitous
soft drink, consumers now regard Sony, Mercedes-Benz, Kodak
and Disney as truly "global brands."
   Those names -- along with Nestle, Toyota, McDonald's, IBM
and Pepsi-Cola -- ranked high in a survey of brand awareness
with consumers in the U.S., Japan and Western Europe. The
study, conducted by Landor Associates, an image-consulting
concern based in San Francisco, defines a global brand as one
that is recognized well enough in the world's major markets
for shoppers to evaluate it against other available brands.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Ten years ago, we would have said Coca-Cola was the only
truly global brand," said Donald Casey, president of Landor.
The latest study identified up to 20 brands that were already
internationally known, and noted a further 45 brands poised
for global status.</p>
<p>To gauge the consumer attitudes, Landor questioned 5,000
consumers in the U.S., 3,000 consumers in eight European
countries and 1,000 consumers in Japan. Consumers were asked
how familiar they were with some 800 different trademarks.
Respondents were then asked how highly they regarded those
brands. Combining the familiarity and esteem scores, Landor
then ranked the brands by "image power."</p>
<p>But some critics question the value of asking consumers to
rate brands along such subjective criteria as esteem. "People
are going to have a lot more esteem for a Mercedes than for a
brand of toothpaste," said Alan Siegel, chairman of Siegel &
Gale Inc., a corporate-identity unit of Saatchi & Saatchi
Worldwide.</p>
<p>Indeed, brands made by some of the world's most powerful
marketers, including Procter & Gamble Co. and Unilever Group,
are noticeably absent from the survey's top 20 brands. Even
Marlboro cigarettes, among the world's best-selling packaged
consumer products, were absent from the global rankings.
"It's hard to believe," says a spokesman for Philip Morris
Cos., which makes Marlboro. "It points out a question about
the validity of their idea of global brands."</p>
