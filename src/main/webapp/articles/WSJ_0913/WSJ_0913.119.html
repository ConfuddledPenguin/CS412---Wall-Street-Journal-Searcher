	<p class="article-leader">An accounting panel abandoned a proposal that would have
required airlines to reflect much higher costs on their books
for the millions of unused frequent-flier travel coupons the
carriers have outstanding.
   Meeting in Seattle, the Accounting Standards Executive
Committee of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants deliberated over a proposal that would have
required airlines to adopt two different methods of
accounting for frequent-flier liabilities. But "we terminated
the project," said John L. Kreischer, chairman of the
15-member committee.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A special task force of institute accountants spent two
years studying frequent-flier accounting methods. The
proposal abandoned yesterday called for airlines to use both
incremental-cost and deferred-revenue accounting methods.</p>
<p>The first allows airlines to set aside money for
liabilities based on its incremental cost -- that is, the
cost of flying a frequent flier in an otherwise empty seat.
The second requires that at a future time, airlines must
account for frequent-flier miles based on the price of the
revenue that would be lost from displacing a paying
passenger.</p>
<p>Currently, each airline determines its own frequent-flier
liabilities, based on incremental costs for each additional
nonfare paying passenger. These costs include food, fuel and
handling; the airlines also take into account the rates at
which the frequent-flier coupons are redeemed.</p>
<p>The debate is extremely important to all airlines, which
have opposed changing the accounting rules for frequent-flier
programs.</p>
<p>The travel awards have become tremendously popular since
they were created in 1981, but they've left airlines with
significant liabilities. According to an internal study by
the BusinessFlyer, a newsletter on frequent-travel awards,
airlines have a total 34.6 billion frequent-flier miles
outstanding.</p>
<p>John Holland, the newsletter's publisher, says that
redemption rates are rising, but still only 26% of the
mileage under the awards is redeemed. Forcing airlines to
reserve for all mileage that might be redeemed could double
the industry's liabilities outstanding to $4.7 billion and
might even threaten some carriers' solvency.</p>
<p>Still, some accountants argue that as frequent-flier
programs have skyrocketed, airlines are incurring huge
potential future liabilities and aren't accurately reflecting
such liabilities on their books.</p>
<p>Mr. Kreischer said the committee decided to abandon the
dual-method proposal because it did not want to provoke a
battle with the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the
body that has final say over accounting standards for the
airline and other industries.</p>
<p>Through prior meetings, Mr. Kreischer said, AICPA members
determined that the FASB prefers only the deferred-accounting
method of recording frequent-flier liabilities.</p>
<p>"We felt (the dual method) was a reasonable position, but
we didn't want to go counter to the FASB," Mr. Kreischer
said. The panel "agrees in principle" with the
deferred-revenue method, but it wanted to go a step further
to allow for travel awards that are not redeemed.</p>
<p>The FASB now must decide whether to battle the airlines
over the issue, Mr. Kreischer said.</p>
<p>Dennis R. Beresford, chairman of the FASB, said he was
somewhat surprised by the outcome of the AICPA meeting. After
working with the AICPA task force, he anticipated that the
group would go along with the FASB's strong preference for a
single deferred-revenue method.</p>
<p>Mr. Beresford maintains that this method more-accurately
reflects the economics of frequent-flier transactions. Mr.
Beresford added that it is too early to say whether the FASB
will take up the matter further. "It sounds like they (the
AICPA) have passed the buck. We have to decide whether we
want to accept it,"he said.</p>
