	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- It's a Hollywood cliffhanger that has run
longer than most TV series: Will anybody ever close a deal to
buy MGM/UA Communications?
   For more than two years, the movie and television
production and distribution company has been up for sale.
More than 100 potential buyers have been contacted. Two
companies controlled by foreigners, each aspiring to roar
like the MGM lion, have reached separate agreements to pay
more than $1 billion for MGM/UA.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the first agreement, with Qintex Australia, fell apart
in October 1989 when Qintex couldn't raise enough money to
complete the deal. And the second, with Pathe Communications,
was scheduled to close in June but extended to Oct. 23
because of Pathe's own difficulties in obtaining financing.</p>
<p>Because of this history, and continuing questions about
Pathe's ability to procure the $900 million or so in cash
needed to close the deal, MGM/UA shares are trading at a big
discount to the proposed purchase price. Though Pathe
proposes to pay $17.50 in cash for each MGM/UA share, the
stock has been trading closer to 14 1/2 and closed yesterday
at 15 1/4, up 5/8. (MGM/UA shareholders got a separate cash
distribution of $4 a share July 20, funded by Pathe's $253
million "down payment" on the acquisition.)</p>
<p>The discount reflects deep skepticism among takeover-stock
traders about whether Pathe Chairman Giancarlo Parretti can
complete the transaction in the next six weeks. "Unless he
can pull a rabbit out of a hat and come up with close to $900
million, the deal's not getting done," says one
takeover-stock trader who is betting it won't be completed on
schedule.</p>
<p>If the accord with Pathe falls apart, traders and analysts
believe MGM/UA stock could fall below 10, and perhaps into
the range of 7 to 8, where it traded before efforts to sell
the company began in April 1988.</p>
<p>Pathe officials "are still as confident as ever that they
can do the deal," a spokesman for Pathe says. But Pathe
refuses to discuss where its money will come from, saying it
"won't disclose bits and pieces" of the financing package.</p>
<p>A major incentive for completing the takeover is the "down
payment," now totaling $303 million, that Pathe has made
since March. That's far more money, the reasoning goes, than
anybody would throw away on a deal that they can't complete.</p>
<p>What is sometimes lost in discussions of Pathe's down
payment is that the money won't be entirely wasted even if
Pathe can't complete its acquisition of MGM/UA. If the accord
doesn't close, MGM/UA is supposed to issue 12 million new
common shares (a 19% stake) and put them in an escrow account
for Pathe. Pathe, however, wouldn't be able to take ownership
of the shares until after litigation stemming from the deal's
collapse is settled. And MGM/UA would be able to take the
shares as payment of any damages assessed against Pathe.</p>
<p>If Pathe isn't able to complete the transaction on time,
MGM/UA's fate will once again be in the hands of its
controlling shareholder, billionaire Kirk Kerkorian. As the
owner of 71% of MGM/UA's common shares and practically all of
its preferred shares, Mr. Kerkorian can decide whether to
grant Pathe another extension (perhaps in return for more
down payments or other concessions) or to launch yet another
search for a new buyer. Though MGM's board must consider the
interests of public shareholders, the company's bylaws don't
provide for a separate vote by minority shareholders on
merger proposals.</p>
<p>Clearly, the secretive Mr. Kerkorian wants to sell MGM/UA.
He has listened to a host of proposals from big,
well-financed U.S., European and Japanese companies. As
described in proxy material for MGM/UA's Oct. 2 shareholders
meeting, the interested parties included MCA, Walt Disney,
Paramount, Sony, Time Warner and PolyGram, plus well-known
figures such as Marvin Davis, Rupert Murdoch, Robert Maxwell
and Donald Trump.</p>
<p>An acquisition of MGM/UA by any company with a major U.S.
movie studio could easily run into antitrust problems. And
Mr. Kerkorian has demanded consistently that the proposed
buyer of MGM/UA bear the risks of litigation and an adverse
antitrust ruling. So far, nobody has been willing to take
those risks.</p>
<p>Even traders and analysts who doubt that Pathe will buy
MGM/UA on schedule believe that the company will be sold
eventually. But Mr. Kerkorian, by all accounts a very healthy
72-year-old, seems to be in no hurry.</p>
<p>In the meantime, MGM/UA's modest operating earnings --
including revenue from the "thirtysomething" and "In the Heat
of the Night" TV series -- are more than consumed by interest
payments on $400 million of long-term debt.</p>
<p>Shareholders can take some comfort in estimates that the
MGM/UA film library alone is valued at between $700 million
and $900 million. The library, which has more than 1,000
United Artists movies and the 34 MGM movies released since
1986, includes the various James Bond, Rocky and Pink Panther
films.</p>
<p>Time Warner, in fact, was willing to lend Pathe $650
million, secured by the film library, to help finance the
MGM/UA purchase, but backed away after it appeared that Pathe
was having trouble raising the rest of the money. Now, Time
Warner and Pathe are suing each other, and Mr. Parretti has
said he's too busy trying to find financing to undergo a
grilling by Time Warner lawyers.</p>
