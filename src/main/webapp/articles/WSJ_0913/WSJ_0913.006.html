	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- The number of passengers carried on European
airlines' international flights rose 11% in July, the third
consecutive month of increases above 10%, the Association of
European Airlines said.
   But the association said July probably marked the end of
that growth, citing the effects of higher oil prices and fuel
costs that quickly followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Routes in Europe, across the Atlantic and to Asia and
Australia all showed above-average growth, the association
said, while South Atlantic, sub-Saharan Africa and Middle
Eastern routes had smaller increases. The sharp decline in
traffic to North Africa continued, the association said. Air
freight rose 7.4% in July, the second highest rise this year.</p>
