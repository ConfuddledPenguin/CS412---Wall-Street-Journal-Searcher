	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Dun & Bradstreet Corp. said it will market
directories on Soviet business data to companies in the West.
   Dun & Bradstreet signed an agreement with the Information
and Publishing Center of Goskomstat, the U.S.S.R.'s state
committee on statistics. The company plans to offer the
Soviet data in four directories, beginning in the fourth
quarter of 1990.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One directory will include the names and addresses of all
operational joint ventures. Another directory will provide
data on 500 of the largest Soviet manufacturing businesses.
The third will list names and addresses of Soviet export
enterprises. The fourth will be an annual directory
containing historical Soviet import and export trade
statistics for 1988, 1989, and 1990, and quarterly data for
1991 forward.</p>
<p>"The information made available by this agreement will
help Western firms to evaluate emerging business
opportunities in the Soviet Union," said Charles W. Moritz,
Dun & Bradstreet's chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Each directory should sell for less than $100 although a
price has yet to be set, according to the marketer of
business information and related services.</p>
