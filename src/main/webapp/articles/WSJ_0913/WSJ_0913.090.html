	<p class="article-leader">STOUGHTON, Mass. -- Reebok International Ltd. named
Bertram Lee, a black businessman who is chairman of the
Denver Nuggets basketball team, to its board.
   The action comes at a time when some black groups are
charging that the sneaker industry has profited hugely from
sales to black youths while having few blacks in upper
management and spending little money in the black community.
Operation Push, a Chicago-based civil rights group, has
started a boycott of shoes made by Nike Inc., Beaverton,
Ore., Reebok's archrival, demanding among other things that
it name a black person to its board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The industry has been coming under a lot of criticism
lately, and Reebok is trying to address some of the issues
raised by Operation Push," said Heidi Steinberg, a shoe
analyst with Salomon Bros.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee, who has served on other boards, said he always
evaluates human rights when he considers whether to join a
board. Reebok "came through with flying colors," he said.</p>
<p>He added that he hasn't had any contact with Operation
Push about the shoe companies, but he said he expects
Operation Push will evaluate Reebok at some point. Nike has
charged that Operation Push decided to boycott Nike because
Reebok has advertised in the group's magazine while Nike
hasn't.</p>
<p>Nike has said the boycott hasn't had any effect on sales.
Operation Push said officials were unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee and Reebok said he was invited to consider joining
the Reebok board before Operation Push started its boycott in
August. He said he met Reebok Chairman Paul Fireman last
spring when the two helped organize Nelson Mandela's visit to
Boston.</p>
<p>Some critics have complained that shoe companies encourage
poor inner-city youths to spend exorbitant funds buying
sneakers, such as Reebok's Pump shoes that retail for $150.
In some places police have reported people being mugged for
their sneakers. Mr. Lee said that Reebok sells shoes at a
variety of prices and that "Reebok has done no more and no
less than I would do as a businessman." He added, "I'm not
sure I've been able to see the ethical problem."</p>
<p>Mr. Lee said that as a director "my primary responsibility
is a fiduciary duty to the shareholders." He said he believes
he was added to the board because of "my assumed business
acumen, my interest in sports and my enthusiasm for human
rights and companies that have an interest in human rights."
He said, "Reebok was thrown an added incentive because I
happen to be an African American."</p>
<p>Mr. Lee, 51 years old, is chairman of BML Associates, a
Boston holding company with interests in radio stations and
the Nuggets. He is also chairman of Boston Bank of Commerce.</p>
<p>In the past he has been president of New England
Television Corp., which owned the first minority-controlled
CBS network affiliate. Until last year he was a director of
Boston's Shawmut National Bank. He said he resigned that post
because he was spending much of his time in the Midwest. He
is also a director of numerous nonprofit institutions.</p>
<p>He is chairman of TransAfrica Forum, an anti-apartheid
group, based in Washington, D.C., with which Reebok has
worked since sponsoring the Human Rights Now Tour for Amnesty
International, two years ago.</p>
