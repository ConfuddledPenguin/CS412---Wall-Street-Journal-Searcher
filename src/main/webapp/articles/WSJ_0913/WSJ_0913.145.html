	<p class="article-leader">One autumn day in 1864, William Tecumseh Sherman, the
smoldering ruins of Georgia barely behind him, learned that
three reporters traveling with his Army of the Tennessee had
been captured by the rebels. The general also heard --
falsely -- that they had been executed.
   "Good," he snapped. "Now we'll have news from hell before
breakfast]"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While Sherman's view of the press may seem a little harsh
in these days of affable public affairs officers and talky
generals on the evening news, an ingrained and unshakable
distrust of journalists has a long military history. It is
something to consider in these days of huffing and puffing
about "getting at the facts" of our posture in the Persian
Gulf.</p>
<p>During the Crimean War, Sir William Howard Russell, the
"father of war correspondents," brought down Lord Aberdeen's
government with dispatches about the command's treatment of
its own troops. So loathed was Russell by the generals that
he had to pitch a tent outside camp and almost starved during
the Russian winter. In the Civil War, Russell dined with
Lincoln, but was virtually run out of the country after his
all-too-accurate reports of the Union army's collapse at Bull
Run.</p>
<p>The European high commands kept such close watch on
newsmen in World War I that America's celebrity
correspondent, Richard Harding Davis, packed up and went
home, but not until after he had been arrested as a spy by
the Germans. In Korea, correspondents, initially urged to
censor themselves within the bounds of an ill-defined
security and regard for morale, begged for official controls
as competition led them into dangerous indiscretions.</p>
<p>In the discordant '60s, Americans in their living rooms
saw their sons wounded and dying. For the first time -- and
probably the last -- battlefield access was not restricted,
nor dispatches censored. News of the most highly dramatized
failure in our history poured out of the hundreds of
helicopters and jeeps available to reporters.</p>
<p>The front ranks of American journalism are thick with
those who got their first break covering Vietnam, righteously
deciding that victory wasn't worth dying for -- and, anyway,
the fall of Goliath was a far better story. During the Tet
Offensive of 1968, for example, the televised pictures of
Viet Cong on the embassy lawn never caught up with the
reality -- that the enemy was severely punished and
dispersed, a fact even Hanoi's commanders would admit years
later.</p>
<p>Even without the press's "help," from 1974 to 1983 our
armed forces seemed punch drunk, bumping dazedly into one
another; a C-5A evacuating orphans from Saigon crashed and
burned; a botched attempt to rescue crewmen of the freighter
Mayaguez from an island in the Gulf of Siam ended in a
senseless accident -- and then, most desperate of all, came
bungling and disaster at Desert One.</p>
<p>Nothing suggests that information will flow from the
Middle East as once did Kuwaiti crude. Indeed, the hapless
Pentagon media pool, now disbanded for Saudi Arabia,
represented an effort to dispel suspicion that the brass
still remembered the enthusiasm with which Vietnam's debacles
had been aired. Never again would they let the press "lose" a
war.</p>
<p>Despite the earnest disclaimers of Defense Department spin
artists and "enlightened" field commanders, the breach
remains unrepaired. Military men cannot forget those
humiliations and, despite revisionist assertions that the
reporting from Southeast Asia had negligible effect on public
opinion, they still taste the gall. They provided access --
and got a bonus set of battle scars for their trouble. Such
memories have become a legacy. Ask any cadet at West Point,
any raw recruit what he thinks of newspeople. What's more,
they no doubt reflect the attitude of their commander in
chief, George Bush.</p>
<p>"He who says he had made war without mistakes," observed
Napoleon, "has made but little war," a maxim that military
professionals grasp all too well, and one that politicians
fear to entertain. There are demonstrably authentic grounds
for secrecy -- the risks to our side -- but they also mask
the "fog of war," that catalog of blunders that is war's
companion -- and so often the red meat of news.</p>
<p>Media executives insist they understand why "sensitive
strategies" must not be revealed, yet they demand the "facts"
-- names, numbers, places and plans -- all of which collides
with that admirable summary of the military attitude offered
by a British intelligence chief during World War I: "Say what
you like, old man. But don't mention any places or people."</p>
<p>More often than not, commanders regard reporters as
interlopers with no understanding of military imperatives:
discipline, organization, technology, "the life." Eliminating
the draft has only widened the gap, producing a press corps
often hard put to tell a sergeant from a captain, let alone
grasp the mysteries of thermal optical sights. The military
public-affairs apparatus has not forgotten the days when it
could be dangerous to wear the uniform in public. It is ready
to deal with the media's ever-increasing ability to broadcast
live from the hot spots, painfully aware that pictures of a
pilot lying in a burns unit or an infantryman slumped over a
machine gun -- the body bag factor -- may erode American
will, strengthen the enemy's hand. Perhaps all they can count
on is that Saddam Hussein, to say the least, lacks the
ascetic charisma of a Ho Chi Minh.</p>
<p>As U.S. forces poise at the line drawn in the sand, the
military and media have once more squared off on their own
patch of ground. While dashing F-15s gleam on runways,
reporters rhapsodize about "the cutting edge" of American
might, but from a designated distance. While the knights ride
out against each other on this vast tournament ground,
editors back home fume about military control. Memories die
hard and the lessons of Vietnam are bearing bitter fruit in
the desert.</p>
