	<h3>Politics & Policy: Democrats, Republicans Differ Sharply In Their Depictions of the Thrift Debacle</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- First, Rep. Lynn Martin (R., Ill.) attacked
her opponent, incumbent Sen. Paul Simon (D., Ill.), for a
phone call he made to a savings and loan association on
behalf of a Simon supporter and Chicago real estate agent who
defaulted on a $5 million loan. "You'd think a U.S. senator
would have shown better judgment," said a Martin commercial.
   Next came the counterattack. The Simon campaign aired a TV
spot asserting that then-Rep. Simon was one of 13 members of
Congress to vote against the first major deregulation bill.
"Lynn Martin consistently favored deregulation of S&Ls,"
charged the Simon ad.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The difference in these two approaches to the S&L issue
clearly reflects the particular circumstances of each
candidate. But it also underscores a larger point: As the two
parties begin to refine their messages on the thrift debacle,
they are starting to present two sharply different pictures
of the crisis.</p>
<p>For Democrats, the S&L collapse is a national issue that
discredits 10 years of Republican-inspired economic
deregulation. "George Bush, Ronald Reagan and their
high-roller friends ran the government, designed the S&L
policy, and hand-picked the people that gutted the oversight
agencies," charges the Democratic National Committee's "Guide
for Understanding the S&L Crisis," sent out last month to
Democratic members of Congress.</p>
<p>Republicans, however, define the issue less sweepingly as
the result of the corruption or ineptitude of individual
politicians, many of them Democratic. A recent paper by the
House Republican Conference concedes that the Reagan
administration erred in hiring too few bank examiners and not
paying them enough, but stresses that the chief villains were
key lawmakers who "stall, strut, posture, hold their nose,
clip wires on the smoke-detectors, and throw rocks at the
firemen."</p>
<p>Such opposing views reflect the two parties' different
strategies in dealing with the thrift crisis, which is
expected to cost the federal government $130 billion,
excluding interest. Democrats, who must wait until 1992
before they can use the S&L issue against President Bush,
have substituted his son Neil as a symbol of the thrift mess.
Although the furor over Neil Bush's role as a director of the
Silverado Banking, Savings & Loan Association has subsided,
conflict-of-interest charges concerning Mr. Bush will get a
fresh airing at an administrative hearing in Denver later
this month.</p>
<p>Republicans, meanwhile, are vigorously publicizing
connections between the S&L industry and individual members
of Congress like Rep. Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.), whose two
sons-in-law were recently revealed to have former ties to the
U.S. League of Savings Institutions.</p>
<p>Nowhere is the difference between the two parties' stances
more apparent than in the DNC and House Republican Conference
papers issued last month. The Democratic document charges
that the thrift mess "was created by deliberate cutbacks in
the supervision of the S&L industry under Republican economic
philosophy, in a Republican era, under two successive
Republican administrations." The Republican report, on the
other hand, states that the S&L crisis was created in the
early 1980s by "a bipartisan cast of politicians," and argues
that the involvement of Democrats in creating the problem
makes "Democratic willingness to make S&L salvage management
an issue in 1990" seem "strange."</p>
<p>Thus far, the differences in party strategies haven't had
a major impact on the campaign trail. Where the opportunity
presents itself, Democrats seem just as eager as Republicans
to attack their opponents' individual records on S&Ls --
especially when the opponent has accepted contributions from
the thrift industry.</p>
<p>Even where the differences do surface, drawing a partisan
line can be difficult for Democrats. For example, Sen.
Simon's TV ad doesn't explicitly label deregulation as a
Republican policy, and for good reason: That first vote he
cast against deregulation occurred in 1980, when Jimmy Carter
was president.</p>
<p>Still, congressional Democrats are working to keep
Republican culpability in the headlines through a number of
hearings on the S&L crisis scheduled for this month. Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) on Tuesday concluded a series of
hearings on James Fail, a Texas thrift executive who retained
a former Bush aide to lobby on his behalf. And Sen. David
Pryor (D., Ark.) is planning to investigate the
administration of the S&L bailout itself -- which is
unambiguously the responsibility of the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Now there are signs that Democratic challengers are
beginning to heed the message spelled out in the DNC playbook
-- if not to attack Republicans, at least to attack
Washington. "The S&L scandal is costing us billions and the
budget deficit is skyrocketing and all politicians in
Washington can think of is to make us pay for the mess,"
charges an ad for Democrat Harry Lonsdale, who's challenging
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R., Ore.).</p>
<p>Another ad, for challenger Ted Muenster, a Democrat
seeking to unseat Sen. Larry Pressler (R., S.D.), states that
"the politicians are spending more time blaming each other
for the savings and loan mess than trying to get our money
back."</p>
<p>Still, both parties have far to go in articulating their
messages. "For Democrats, it ought to be a policy debate over
deregulation," says political scientist William Schneider of
the American Enterprise Institute. "The Republican
argument,"he says, "is essentially that it's a congressional
failure." But so far, "it's the politics of character
assassination. It's just another device for negative
campaigning."</p>
