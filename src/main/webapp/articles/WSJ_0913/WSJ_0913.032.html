exchange $215.6 million principal amount of its 16% senior
subordinated debentures, due 2003, under its previously
announced debt-for-equity swap.
   The railroad, real estate and natural resources concern
said debenture holders will receive 67.25 shares of its stock
plus $26.67 for each $1,000 principal amount of debentures
accepted for exchange. Santa Fe said it will issue 14.5
million common shares in the exchange offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Santa Fe said the debentures are being purchased on a pro
rata basis; the definitive pro rata factor is expected to be
announced on or about next Tuesday.</p>
<p>The company said it is continuing with its plan to
refinance and redeem the remaining $565 million of debentures
outstanding on about Oct. 31 through the issuance of
long-term debt at the parent company and proceeds of an
offering of variable-rate exchangeable debentures at its
pipeline subsidiary.</p>
