	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- The two Germanys and the four allies that won
World War II signed a treaty giving their blessing to the
united Germany scheduled to come into being Oct. 3.
   The treaty, which concludes seven months of bargaining,
provides that the World War II allies -- the U.S., the Soviet
Union, Britain and France -- will restore to Germany the full
sovereignty it lost in 1945. The united Germany will be in
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but no non-German
NATO forces will be stationed permanently on the territory of
the former East German state.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The treaty also declares that the united Germany "has no
territorial claims whatsoever against other states" and "will
never disturb the peaceful relations between nations."</p>
<p>The seven-page treaty was made possible by a side
agreement between West Germany and the Soviet Union. Under
it, Bonn will provide billions of dollars in aid to Moscow
and help build housing in the U.S.S.R. for the nearly 400,000
Soviet troops that will leave German territory by the end of
1994 as a result of the German unity treaty.</p>
<p>Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev told Soviet reporters
the German aid will total nearly $10 billion. The figure was
worked out in the past few days, after Moscow unexpectedly
raised its financial demands sharply.</p>
<p>Now that the unity treaty is signed, the two Germanys can
proceed as planned with a separate internal pact and declare
themselves a single state.</p>
<p>Two important issues related to the new treaty remain
unresolved. Secretary of State James Baker will continue
negotiating with Soviet officials today over a Soviet demand
that the U.S. separately agree to limit its troop deployments
in Europe to well below 100,000, compared with more than
300,000 now. Mr. Baker also is negotiating with Senate
leaders about whether the unity pact will have to be ratified
by the Senate.</p>
<p>Under the treaty, Germany will limit its armed forces to
370,000 troops, down from nearly 500,000 now, and it pledges
never to acquire nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.
United Germany also will sign a treaty with Poland
guaranteeing their current border.</p>
<p>The treaty erases the military and political arrangements
put in place after World War II, and it formally eliminates
Soviet control established by Joseph Stalin over East
Germany.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev presided over the treaty signing at a hotel
built for Communist Party leaders here. He was praised for
encouraging reforms in East Germany and allowing the opening
of the Berlin Wall. "We have drawn the line under World War
II," declared Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
"We are now dealing with a new Germany that has drawn its
lessons from history."</p>
<p>West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said,
"This is a day of joy and jubilation," but he also recalled
the victims of Nazi Germany. "In this hour, we remember the
victims of war and totalitarian domination," he said. "We are
particularly thinking about the Jewish people. We would not
want their agony to ever be repeated."</p>
<p>For his part, Secretary Baker hailed "the plain, ordinary
people who breached the wall and tore asunder the Iron
Curtain."</p>
<p>Last-minute disputes were still being resolved two hours
before the signing. Mr. Baker was awakened in the middle of
the night when Mr. Genscher appeared at his hotel to iron out
language covering NATO troops on German soil.</p>
<p>In the pact, the Soviet Union agreed to let Germany decide
when and how U.S. and other NATO troops based in the
country's western half can "deploy" temporarily to the
eastern half for maneuvers. Germany pledged to protect Soviet
war monuments, to consult Moscow about honoring East German
contracts and to bar Nazism.</p>
<p>The pact calls for total Soviet withdrawal from Germany
over four years, but it allows the U.S. to keep as many
troops on German soil as Washington and Bonn jointly want. An
earlier, separate agreement between the U.S. and the Soviet
Union, which permitted each side 195,000 troops in central
Europe, has been junked as obsolete in light of the Soviet
exit.</p>
<p>Moscow privately has been pressing Washington to declare
publicly a new unilateral U.S. troop ceiling of well below
100,000. But the U.S. has resisted, wanting to keep a free
hand and telling Moscow that Congress won't permit as many as
195,000 U.S. troops in Central Europe anyway.</p>
<p>Still, the Soviets want such a limit on U.S. troops to
quell political concerns here over a separate conventional
arms-control treaty, which would cut each side's arsenal of
tanks, artillery pieces and other weapons. Mr. Baker will
discuss the matter today with Mr. Shevardnadze and Mr.
Gorbachev. The Bush administration is still debating what to
do.</p>
<p>At Soviet insistence, the U.S. agreed to call the German
unity pact a "treaty," rather than giving it the less august
title of "agreement." But the administration still argues
that the pact needn't be ratified by the Senate. Senate
leaders disagree, and Mr. Baker spent time on the telephone
to Capitol Hill trying to iron out the issue.</p>
<p>Because ratification in each nation takes time, the formal
termination of the World War II victors' rights and full
restoration of German sovereignty could be delayed past the
Oct. 3 unification date.</p>
<p>To avoid that delay, the four allies agreed to sign a
separate agreement in New York Oct. 1 suspending their legal
rights over Germany. As a result, the nation will be fully
sovereign when it unifies Oct. 3, even before the allied
rights are terminated.</p>
