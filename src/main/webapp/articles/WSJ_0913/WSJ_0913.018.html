	<p class="article-leader">When the books editor of The Wall Street Journal phoned
me, I told my girl to put the call right through. The Journal
is a truly world-class institution for which I have enormous
respect. Besides, the newspaper business, in which the
Journal team is a major player, is an industry in which I've
always been fascinated. I'm not saying I was panting. People
who make deals do not pant. But I was willing to talk.
   "Andrew," this editor said to me, "you must review that
Trump book." Frankly, I was not surprised to hear from her.
She happens to be one of the top editors in her chosen field
and a major, major talent. We had done numerous deals over
the past two years and, to be honest, I think even my critics
will admit that we both benefited in a maximized way from
those deals. My work filled the upper righthand corner of
this page, which I happen to know is a very sensitive matter
with this particular editor, and I walked away with more than
a few dollars in my pocket, which I was very happy to have.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So to myself I'm thinking: This could be class. This could
be a go. I would not be truly unhappy to possess this book,
although I knew that the smirking cover photo might keep my
wife, who is terrific, awake nights. To be in a reviewing
situation with this man's book could be a fantastic
opportunity. But I had doubts of which I had to unburden
myself. That's who I am. That's me.</p>
<p>"Look," I said to this editor, who is brilliant and back
with whom I go way, "there's one problem. The book stinks. It
is a menace. Spend 25 minutes with it, and you find yourself
thinking and talking exactly the way this man thinks and
talks: self-congratulatory, dissembling, superficial, and
periphrastic, which is a word I happen to know of which the
Donald has never heard. I will not take the risk of sounding
like a buffoon for the rest of my life. I cannot review this
book."</p>
<p>"I'll pay you extra," she said.</p>
<p>The book arrived the next day, and my modesty will not be
offended if I admit to you that I was right on target:
"Surviving at the Top" (Random House, 236 pages, $21.95) is
the thinnest, least interesting celebrity book since the
publication of the 18th rewrite of Bob Hope's memoirs, which
is nothing against Bob, who is a dear friend and very old.</p>
<p>Like innumerable Americans, literally, I had been gagging
for months reading about Donald's incredibly sleazy personal
problems and then had recoiled at the transparently phony
denials of his massive business failures. You would think
that we, as a nation, would have had enough of a man who
induced a coast-to-coast upchuck for the better part of a
year. But you would be wrong. "Surviving at the Top" has
attained an incredibly high position on some of the most
widely respected best-seller lists in this country. Who, you
ask me, is buying this book in such fabulous numbers?</p>
<p>First are the people who are in an obsessive relationship
with the Donald's personal situation. They are, as he puts
it, the scum of the earth, which in all fairness they have
every right to be. Unfortunately, "Surviving at the Top" is
totally lacking in personal information of the tabloid
variety; if it's gossip you want, I respectfully suggest that
you try Liz Smith, a true pro of whom I am most fond. Ivana
is one very special lady -- brains and body, the Donald
admits. But here's the bottom line on this class act whom he
was proud to call wife before she started monthly skin-peels:
"We seem to be headed in different directions."</p>
<p>Donald, you're saying, we knew that. You're saying: Fine,
okay, then how about Marla? A "terrific person," Donald
writes, "but my relationship with her was not the cause of
the trouble between Ivana and me." That's it. Now, Marla is
not a nothing lady. This is a lady who has worked in film;
this is a lady who on numerous occasions has expressed deep
concern about our environment; this is a lady who, in a
famous TV interview, achieved the unimaginable feat of making
Diane Sawyer appear intelligent by comparison. But of all
this the Donald says nothing]</p>
<p>Let us just say that this is a very savvy gentleman, a guy
who plays his cards incredibly close to the vest. This is
also a guy who has happened to achieve at a very high strata
a kind of success that is fabulous. That's why most of his
book is aimed at the readers who are stupid -- although I
respect them totally as people. These are people whose hunger
for business books is insatiable. They are convinced that
"Surviving at the Top" will unlock the secrets of success,
Trump-style -- that it will explain how a man can botch his
deals to the point where his debts exceed his assets by
one-third of a billion dollars and still write a book called
"Surviving at the Top."</p>
<p>The answer is simple. First, convince scores of terrific
bankers from some of the hugest banks in the world to lend
you very substantial sums of financing. These sums allow you
to spend megalomaniacally, which helps you convince other
brilliantly creative bankers to act in an accommodating mode
when it comes time to pay off the first terrific bankers.</p>
<p>Do either the Donald or I have to draw you pictures to
explain that those terrific people will therefore do
everything in their power to keep you from going down that
chute? Suddenly you will find that these are some fabulously
patient lenders with whom you are privileged to be doing
business.</p>
<p>It will be tough. It will be a challenge. But in the final
analysis it will be a deal.</p>
