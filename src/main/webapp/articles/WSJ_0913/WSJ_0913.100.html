	<p class="article-leader">Darling-Delaware Co. lacks cash to pay interest on its
high-yield junk bonds, just 20 months after it paid a $179
million dividend to the prominent Texas and Connecticut
investors who own the company.
   Darling-Delaware, based in Dallas, is the largest U.S.
rendering company, producing tallow and bone meal from animal
parts. For the first six months of 1990, the company reported
an $11.3 million loss on revenue of $177.8 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Darling-Delaware has stopped filing quarterly results with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, asserting that it is
a private company that doesn't need to make public filings.
It still sends reports to bondholders, though, and in a
footnote to its second-quarter report, the company said it
"doesn't have sufficient cash" to make a $12.2 million
interest payment that is due Saturday on its 14% senior
subordinated notes. The company added that it "doesn't
anticipate that it will be able to borrow funds" to make the
payment.</p>
<p>Until this year, Darling-Delaware had been highly
profitable for its owners. These include Fort Worth, Texas,
investor Richard Rainwater; Edward W. Rose III, a co-owner of
the Texas Rangers baseball team; and Airlie Group, a
Greenwich, Conn., investment firm. Airlie's main owners and
investors are former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. employee
Dort Cameron, Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.
and the Bass family of Texas.</p>
<p>On Jan. 3, 1989, Darling-Delaware paid $179 million to its
owners, including $25.8 million to Mr. Rose, $62.4 million to
Airlie Group, then known as Investment L.P., and $9.5 million
for Mr. Rainwater. The amounts were disclosed in an SEC
filing for Darling-Delaware's junk bonds, which were issued
two months later.</p>
<p>Analysts and bondholders voiced dismay at the downturn in
Darling-Delaware's fortunes so soon after the company's big
payout to the owners. "It's clear they took too much of a
dividend," said Hannah Strasser, an analyst at Deltec
Securities, which owns some Darling-Delaware bonds.</p>
<p>Executives at Airlie didn't return repeated phone calls
seeking comment. Mr. Rainwater declined to comment, as did a
spokesman for Mr. Rose.</p>
<p>Darling-Delaware's junk bonds have sunk steadily since
being issued, traders said, and were quoted yesterday at just
22 cents on the dollar. The bonds, which were underwritten by
the failed Drexel, were downgraded to a double-C rating last
week by Standard & Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>Bondholders said Darling-Delaware and its financial
advisers, Jefferies & Co., have called a meeting for today in
New York at which they are expected to put forth a
debt-restructuring plan. Deltec's Ms. Strasser said she
expects bondholders will push for Darling-Delaware's owners
to put more cash into the company and give some equity to
bondholders in return for bondholders' willingness to
exchange their bonds for less costly debt.</p>
<p>In March, Darling-Delaware's owners pumped $24 million
into the company, helping the company meet its interest
payment then.</p>
<p>In its second-quarter report, Darling-Delaware, which
employs about 2,000 people, disclosed a variety of business
setbacks. It said a slowdown in cattle slaughterings reduced
its intake of raw material, while environmental regulators
told the company it may be liable for the clean-up of waste
dumps in Houston and Shelbyville, Ind., and a switch in U.S.
eating habits away from beef and toward pork and chicken has
left the company with less profitable raw materials.</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, "Darling's sophisticated
investor group must support this credit," said Jeremy
Bloomer, managing director of Credit Research & Trading
Corp., Greenwich, Conn. Otherwise, Mr. Bloomer said, the
company's owners "might be forced to return part of their
{$179 million} dividend" under various possible legal claims
by bondholders.</p>
<p>Ms. Strasser said bondholders have hired a Chicago law
firm, Chapman & Cutler, to advise them on their options but
haven't made any decision yet on litigation.</p>
