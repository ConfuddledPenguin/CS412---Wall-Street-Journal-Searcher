	<p class="article-leader">SADDLE BROOK, N.J. -- Lexington Management Corp., a unit
of Piedmont Management Co., New York, said it will eliminate
sales charges on purchases of shares of three mutual funds,
effective Sept. 12.
   The three funds are: Lexington Corporate Leaders Trust
Fund, with assets of $87.6 million; Lexington Global Fund,
with assets of $52 million; and Lexington Technical Strategy
Fund, with assets of about $9 million. Previously, the fund
management company imposed maximum sales charges of between
4% and 5% on the funds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lexington Management, which manages about $2.5 billion of
assets, also offers eight mutual funds that never carried
purchase and redemption fees. Company officials said the
popularity of these funds prompted them to drop the fees on
the other three funds.</p>
