	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- At Guardsman Elevator Co. in the
rough-and-tumble South Bronx, a loud, fierce-looking dog
named Tiger watches the parking lot. Inside the building, a
shotgun is perched in an executive's office.
   But street crime isn't the danger that preoccupies
Guardsman these days. Instead, it is concerned with the risks
faced by juvenile and college-age daredevils who ride on top
of elevators rather than inside them. Guardsman has developed
a new gadget, called the Elevator Car Top Intrusion Device,
to keep people off the elevator tops.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In their day-to-day work, small companies often spot needs
for new products or services. Mired in their routine
activities, however, the companies assume they aren't
equipped to develop products to fill those needs. Yet
Guardsman -- which says it has 42 employees and about $6
million in annual revenue -- shows how even a small company
with no research department can turn an idea into a
marketable product.</p>
<p>Riding the tops -- a game known by such names as "elevator
chicken," "elevator surfing" and "elevator action" -- has led
in recent years to injuries and deaths in many cities with
high-rise apartment buildings. In most cases, players use a
shoestring to defeat the hoistway-door lock just above an
elevator stopped one floor below. Then they jump onto the top
of the car.</p>
<p>Though such riding has occurred mostly in poor, inner-city
neighborhoods, it has also been faddish recently at some
colleges. Only last March at the University of Massachusetts,
in Amherst, an 18-year-old freshman plunged 16 stories to his
death. He apparently had tried to leap from the roof of one
elevator to another in a double shaft, the Boston Globe
reported.</p>
<p>Housed in a black steel box that can be bolted to an
elevator top, Guardsman's device shuts off the elevator and
sounds an ear-piercing siren whenever an infrared beam
detects tampering with the hoistway doors. Eight prototype
units are already at work at test sites in New York City and
in Newark, N.J. Val Coleman, a spokesman for the New York
City Housing Authority, says of a unit installed about five
months ago in a 30-story building on Vernon Street in
Brooklyn: "So far we've had good success. We're very pleased
with it."</p>
<p>Guardsman is pleased, too. Until recently, it was just
another small service company, one of hundreds in the region
that maintain and repair elevators. Now its owners have
formed a new, separate company, G.E.C. Holding Corp., that
they hope will earn millions of dollars in the next few years
from sales of the anti-intrusion device. Though no new
technology is involved, G.E.C. is seeking an applications
patent covering its product. It is also seeking a
manufacturer to produce it in quantity. Before long, G.E.C.
believes, such devices may be standard equipment in high-rise
buildings, at a price of perhaps $500 for each elevator.</p>
<p>If all goes well, says Robert F. Cummins, one of the three
owners of Guardsman, sales of G.E.C.'s device will enable the
owners to develop more ideas for elevator components into
actual products. The envisioned products would make
Guardsman's regular work easier, by reducing unscheduled
elevator maintenance. And they would give the company a new
source of earnings. "We hope to generate a load of money,"
Mr. Cummins says.</p>
<p>Until recently, Guardsman gave little thought to anything
but its constant day-to-day service work for some 650
clients. The company says it earns the most money when
careful scheduling permits employees to service an increased
number of clients. But in 1988, unscheduled service calls due
to elevator riders -- who often vandalize equipment -- were
becoming frequent enough to unnerve the company.</p>
<p>Besides risking injury, the riders were driving up repair
costs for elevator owners, shortening the useful lives of
elevators and exposing owners to possible liability claims in
the event of accidents. And in some cases, riders descended
through trap doors into elevator cars, where they mugged
passengers.</p>
<p>Not all elevator-service companies were upset by the
riders, who often cause damage leading to $150-an-hour repair
calls. Says Mr. Cummins, "There are guys in the industry who
say, `We're glad people are wrecking the elevators -- we can
bill the hell out them for repairs.'" Guardsman, on the other
hand, stuck to its view that in the long run, eliminating
unscheduled service would be more profitable.</p>
<p>But how to do this? In recent years, elevator companies
tried a variety of tricks to discourage top-of-the-car
riding, says Mr. Coleman of the New York City Housing
Authority. But he adds, "Until now, the kids have been able
to circumvent anything we do." For example, riders learned to
disconnect the pressure-sensitive rubber mats that were added
to some elevator tops a few years ago as a warning device.</p>
<p>Guardsman says it had a different idea: using infrared
technology to trigger an alarm before any intruder could
disconnect it. Late in 1988, by combing through suppliers'
catalogs of electronic and mechanical parts, Guardsman
employees found the components to put together such a device.
Tinkering on their own in the company's metalworking shop,
the employees built several prototypes, which they housed in
16-gauge steel to resist tampering.</p>
<p>"Our biggest problem was finding the time and energy to do
this without taking too much away from our normal day-to-day
operations," Mr. Cummins says. Actually, the work went fairly
smoothly, with no major technical problems.</p>
<p>To design the devices, "we just played devil's advocate
with each other," says Joseph Vitiello, one of the owners.
One concern was the alarm, which the company decided to make
as loud as possible. After five months of tinkering and field
tests, Guardsman had a working product, consisting of about
15 off-the-shelf parts. In January, after forming G.E.C., the
owners had an attorney pay a $305 fee and file for a U.S.
applications patent. (The government's decision is still
pending.) Including the value of the time that Guardsman
employees spent on the project, the owners say they've
invested about $150,000 in the product.</p>
<p>Now, the owners say they're talking with parts suppliers
and with a manufacturer (which they decline to name). Lacking
capital, the owners say they'd require any manufacturer to
finance the tooling expenses necessary to prepare for
production. But in return, the manufacturer would enjoy an
exclusive contract to produce the product for G.E.C. Mr.
Cummins estimates that a national market exists for 400,000
devices, to be sold during the next five years or so.</p>
