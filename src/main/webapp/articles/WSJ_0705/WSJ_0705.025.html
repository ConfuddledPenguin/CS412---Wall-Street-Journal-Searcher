	<p class="article-leader">MILAN -- Alitalia S.p.A., Italy's flagship air carrier,
said it has pulled out of the international bidding for
Aerolineas Argentinas, Argentina's state airline.
   Alitalia said it decided not to participate in the bid
after determining "the impossibility of developing a
practicable management program under the restrictive terms of
the Argentine government."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The privatization of Argentina's state airlines will
involve 85% of the company's share capital, while the
remaining portion will remain in the hands of the state.</p>
<p>Under terms stipulated by the Argentine government
regarding the portion to be privatized, only 49% can end up
in foreign hands, and only 30% can be sold to a foreign
airline.</p>
