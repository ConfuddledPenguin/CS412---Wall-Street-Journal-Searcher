	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Two men were sentenced after pleading
guilty in April to a long-running scam involving falsified
test results on millions of nuts and bolts designed to fasten
parts in aircraft engines.
   Norman McHaffie, president of the now-defunct defense
contractor McHaffie Inc. of Sylmar, Calif., was sentenced to
three years in prison and three years' probation and was
fined $750,000. James Hicks, an employee, was sentenced to
one and a half years in prison and two years' probation, and
the company was fined $750,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A third defendant, former shop floor manager William
Whitham, was sentenced June 18 to 20 weekends in prison,
three years' probation and 150 hours of community service
after pleading guilty.</p>
<p>The government accused the men of participating in a
10-year scheme beginning in 1979 that involved more than
4,000 government and commercial contracts. According to the
government's investigation, the company did not conduct
Pentagon-mandated tests on the products, but went to great
lengths to falsify results and otherwise mask the fraud.</p>
