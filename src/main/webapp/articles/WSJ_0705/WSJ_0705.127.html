	<p class="article-leader">EAST HARTFORD, Conn. -- Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United
Technologies Corp., said it recalled all 38 of its new PW4000
engines for wide-body planes because of a compressor problem.
   A Pratt & Whitney spokesman said that the company decided
to recall the engines after tests at Boeing Co. in Seattle
disclosed the problem that could cause an in-flight engine
shutdown. Although a few of the engines had been installed on
planes, none of the aircraft were in service, the spokesman
added.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The recalled engines are part of a PW4000 "performance
improvement" package that Pratt & Whitney introduced in
February and shipped to Boeing, McDonnell Douglas Corp., and
Airbus Industrie. Boeing plans to use the new PW-4000 engines
for its 747-400 and 767-300 jets. McDonnell Douglas and
Airbus will use the engines to power their MD-11 and A330
jets respectively.</p>
<p>Pratt & Whitney said the latest PW-4000 engines, which
have slight design modifications from its earlier PW-4000
engines, are being replaced by engines with the older design.</p>
<p>The PW-4000, Pratt & Whitney's most powerful engine,
accounted for about $4.7 billion in firm orders and options
in the year ended February.</p>
