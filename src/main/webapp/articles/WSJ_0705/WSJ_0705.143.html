	<p class="article-leader">In the movie "The Graduate," Dustin Hoffman receives some
neighborly advice: "Plastics." Get into a career in plastics.
Mr. Hoffman's character doesn't. Instead, he gets into an
affair with another neighbor's wife. No matter. To movie
audiences in the 1960s, "plastics" became what "advertising"
had been to an earlier generation: the future.
   Well, perhaps the film was ahead of its time. Perhaps
plastic, at least recycled plastic, is the future. Should
there be a "Post-Graduate" sequel, Mr. Hoffman might very
well be wearing it. The swimming pool might be lined with it.
And the famous Mrs. Robinson would surely be wearing shoulder
pads created from it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plastics people would have us believe that anything is
possible when it comes to recycling, and they are spending
millions of dollars to prove it.</p>
<p>Who would believe, for instance, that Goodyear Tire &
Rubber Co. would turn some fashion tricks and come up with
plastic threads? That company has created a suit made of
recycled plastic soda bottles -- the soft drinks Americans
consume at a rate of 12.4 billion gallons a year.</p>
<p>Unlike cotton, silk or linen, plastic doesn't exactly
breathe. It isn't great looking, either. Imagine an itchy,
navy-blue polyester leisure suit, with matching navy-blue
polyester tie -- a kind of Smokey and the Bandit look gone
retro. Goodyear has donated this one-of-a-kind suit to
Ripley's Believe It or Not, which professes to be happy about
it. Doubtless it is the only suit that bears a Goodyear
label.</p>
<p>Actually, Goodyear isn't that far off the mark. Real
fashion designers do incorporate PET (polyethylene
terephtalate) into some of their lesser lines. Bill Blass,
who dresses the First Lady from time to time, uses recycled
PET as stuffing in quilted comforters and bedspreads. It's
cheaper than virgin plastic and, naturally, goose down.
Shoulder pads are often made from PET fibers.</p>
<p>King Glorious, a horse, wore knitted leg warmers with
recycled-PET padding. "It insulates better, holds its shape
better and costs only a fraction of regular felt padding,"
says Peter Armatto of Equine Textiles, the pads' Arcadia,
Calif., manufacturer. But who's going to rebut that -- Mr.
Glorious, now a happy stud?</p>
<p>With some stretch of the imagination, this concept could
be pitched to Mikhail Baryshnikov, the ballet dancer, who has
a line of bodywear, for use in human leg warming.</p>
<p>To cows, recycled plastic makes a more delightful and
delectable table setting than Limoges china. Farmers needn't
worry about breakage, nor be concerned about the acid that
drips from cow tongues, which helps pit cement mangers,
causing the feed to fall through the cracks. Just by covering
the cement with a sheet of recycled high-density polyethylene
(HDPE), Dan Stahl, in Luxemberg, Wis., has increased feed
consumption. Milk production then rose by 7% or 8%, or so he
says. Mr. Stahl, one of the pioneer users of HDPE, chose to
order his plastic sheet in black. But it comes in other
decorator colors.</p>
<p>Humans sidling up to their own liquid mangers could
discover the miracle of modern recycling staring out at them
from the bottom of their highball glasses. For the bar of his
restaurant in West Palm Beach, Fla., John Pfleger wanted a
terrazzo-look. Instead of using bits of expensive black
marble embedded into Portland cement, Master Builders Inc. in
Cleveland cleverly salvaged some thermoplastic from car
bumpers, and voila] a terrazzo bar, with bits of black bumper
that look almost like the real thing. This terrazzo look is
often found on the kitchen floor, a kind of linoleum redux.</p>
<p>For all its creative new uses, however, the future of
recycled plastic isn't guaranteed. For one thing, the process
of recycling isn't so easy. In general, after the soda
bottles are cleaned, their plastic is recovered either
through washing with chemicals or mechanical separation. The
recovered plastic then is heated, extruded and cooled back to
a solid that can be beaten into shape. The job gets tough
when the plastic has more than one resin, as many products
do. When it is heated, multiple-resin plastic tends to form a
mush that has little economic value.</p>
<p>Another serious problem is a chronic shortage of what the
industry calls "post-consumer" plastic. Because the public
perceives plastic as a throwaway, and because old plastic
containers can't just be tied up like old newspapers, fewer
than one million of the 10 million or so U.S. households
covered by a curbside pick-up program have the option of
putting plastic out for collection, says Resource Recycling,
a trade magazine. Recyclers like Du Pont usually buy from
companies like Waste Management, which picks up recyclables.</p>
<p>There's also another teeny trouble spot, which the
plastics industry doesn't like to mention when it's hyping
the magic of "Oui Oui" screens -- mats for urinals. If that
product, and others like it, eventually make their way to the
junk heap, there, like all other plastic, it will sit for
eternity.</p>
<p>But some big things are happening in the recycling world,
like telephone poles made from the plastic coating on
curlicue phone cords. Hammer's Plastic Recycling Corp., in
Iowa Falls, Iowa., is currently testing a handsome black
pole, which comes in attachable 20-foot sections, and would,
Floyd Hammer says, "frustrate squirrels."</p>
<p>And what else? Oh, here's something. Cardinal Comb Corp.
of Leominster, Mass., makes combs from McDonald's polystyrene
containers and school lunch trays. Cardinal sells the bulk of
its recycled-plastic combs to Plastics Again, owned by a
consortium of eight polystyrene manufacturers. They use them
for promotion.</p>
