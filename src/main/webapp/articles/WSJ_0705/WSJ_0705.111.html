	<p class="article-leader">A group of major creditors in the Greyhound Lines Inc.
federal bankruptcy case filed a change of venue motion
seeking to move the Chapter 11 proceedings from Brownsville,
Texas, to Dallas, headquarters of GLI Holding Co., parent
company of Greyhound and five other subsidiaries involved in
the case.
   The creditors' group includes Security Pacific Business
Credit Inc., a unit of Security Pacific Corp., and other
secured lenders who had provided Greyhound with $50 million
in term loans and a $110 million revolving credit facility
prior to Greyhound's Chapter 11 filing last month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Security Pacific group alleges that the
Brownsville-based Eagle Manufacturing Company Inc., one of
the GLI units involved, accounts for only a small percentage
of GLI's revenue and that most of the corporation's
executives and business records are in Dallas.</p>
<p>Arguing that the Eagle plant represents one of the
country's largest concentrations of GLI employees, Greyhound
attorneys said they would oppose the move. No hearings have
been scheduled.</p>
