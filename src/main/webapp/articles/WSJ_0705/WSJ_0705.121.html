	<p class="article-leader">Beeba's Creations Inc. said it plans to liquidate its
minority interests in its two remaining offshore
manufacturing operations, resulting in a $4 million pre-tax
charge against earnings.
   The San Diego-based company also reported a net loss of
$5.3 million, or $1.19 a share, for the third quarter ended
May 31, compared with net income of $1.6 million, or 35 cents
a share, a year ago. The writeoff accounted for 53 cents a
share of the loss.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The importer and distributor of women's clothing blamed
its problems on decreasing gross margins caused by bankruptcy
filings by major retailers, poor weather, weak economic
conditions in several parts of the country and competitive
pressures.</p>
<p>As a result, said Steven P. Wyandt, chief executive
officer, "The company has been unable to liquidate its spring
and summer inventory within season as in prior years and will
be forced to carry a significant portion of this inventory
into fiscal 1991."</p>
