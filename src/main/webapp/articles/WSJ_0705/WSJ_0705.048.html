	<p class="article-leader">An ulcer-prevention drug used by arthritis sufferers is
cost-effective only for high-risk patients who have had
previous gastric ulcers, a new study suggests.
   The report could mean difficulties for the medicine,
marketed by Monsanto Co.'s G.D. Searle unit under the trade
name Cytotec. The study also reflects the increasing role
cost considerations -- not just clinical measures -- play in
evaluating the effectiveness of medicines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cytotec, known generically as misoprostol, helps prevent
ulcers in patients taking other drugs to relieve arthritis
pain. As many as 19 million people in the U.S. take such
medicines, known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
which can cause ulcers as a side effect. In a small number of
cases, severe or even fatal bleeding results.</p>
<p>The study, published in yesterday's Journal of the
American Medical Association, says that because most users of
the nonsteroidal drugs aren't likely to develop ulcers, wide
use of Cytotec among these patients isn't cost-effective.</p>
<p>While preventing such ulcers "is an appealing clinical
strategy," say Jonathan T. Edelson, president of Medical
Decision Resources, Brookline, Mass., and his co-authors,
"the cost of {prevention} may be high relative to the
benefits provided."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Monsanto's Searle unit didn't dispute the
thrust of the findings, which he termed "not surprising." He
said the report probably wouldn't affect sales of Cytotec
because the drug is targeted only at high-risk patients
anyway. About 5.5 million nonsteroidal drug patients have a
history of ulcer disease, the spokesman said, and the company
has estimated that 5.5 million "other patients at risk" might
also benefit from the medicine. Searle projects world-wide
Cytotec sales at $90 million to $100 million in 1990.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drug
only for patients "at high risk of complications from a
gastric ulcer," or of developing such ulcers. However, once a
drug is on the market, it isn't unusual for doctors to
prescribe it for patients whose symptoms fall outside the
approved criteria. Earlier this year, Searle came under fire
for ads that appeared to target the drug at a broader
audience. The company denied the intent but ran corrective
ads.</p>
<p>Dr. Edelson's research was based on previous studies of
the drug's effectiveness in preventing ulcers and on the
incidence of ulcers among patients taking nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs. These data were analyzed by a
computer model that accounts for the cost of the drug,
patients who fail to take medicine and other factors to
predict health and cost benefits.</p>
<p>The study showed, for instance, that about 4.5% of all
patients on arthritis medication are likely to develop ulcers
each year, while 4.4% of those taking Cytotec risk developing
ulcers. Using the computer model, treating all such patients
with Cytotec for one year would translate to a cost of
$667,400 per year of life saved.</p>
<p>For patients over 60, 14.5% with Cytotec and 17.6% without
it are likely to develop ulcers, for a cost per year of life
saved of $186,700, the study estimated. For patients with
rheumatoid arthritis, the cost per year of life saved would
be $95,600.</p>
<p>In contrast, flu vaccine for the elderly, a
well-established primary prevention program, costs about
$2,200 per year of life saved, while certain blood pressure
medicines cost about $12,400 per year of life saved, the
study says.</p>
<p>But the study found that at least 60% of patients who
developed ulcers once from the nonsteroidal medicine would
likely develop them again. For this group, the cost of using
Cytotec to prevent a second occurence would be less than
$40,000 per year of life saved -- an amount that may be
cost-effective, the study says.</p>
<p>Dr. Edelson cautioned that changing some assumptions in
the model would lower the cost figures. In any event, the
study is just one factor doctors should use in determining
treatment and "doesn't in any way dictate the care of any
individual patient," he says.</p>
<p>But such studies are of increasing interest, not only to
doctors, but among drug companies, insurers, hospitals,
health maintenance organizations and others concerned about
who will pay for drug therapy and how much. "It's no longer
adequate to show that a drug is safe and effective," says
Alan L. Hillman, assistant professor of medicine and
health-care management at the University of Pennsylvania.
"The {pharmaceutical} industry has been finding that it's
important to establish an economic argument for its new
products."</p>
