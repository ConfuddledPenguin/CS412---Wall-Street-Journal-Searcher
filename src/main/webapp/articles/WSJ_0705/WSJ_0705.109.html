	<p class="article-leader">Sweden's Procordia AB continued its push into European
confectionery by acquiring Danish candy maker Benzon Brands
AS.
   Benzon Brands, a unit of Danish holding concern Monberg &
Thorsen Holdings, is the third European candy company snapped
up by Procordia in the past 18 months. The acquisition brings
Procordia a new brand of product, Sorbits chewing gum, plus
bases in Holland and Belgium.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Terms weren't disclosed. Procordia officials said the
purchase price was less than Benzon Brands' 1989 sales of 450
million Danish kroner ($71.2 million) but declined to
elaborate, citing a pledge of confidentiality given to the
Danish seller.</p>
<p>The relatively modest price fetched by Benzon Brands' core
candy operations reflect dwindling profit in recent years.
According to Procordia officials, Benzon Brands' pretax
profit fell 52% last year to 24 million kroner from 50
million kroner the previous year.</p>
<p>Besides confectionery, Benzon Brands also makes skin-care
and hair-care products, which account for about a fifth of
sales. Those activities will be shifted to a division at
Procordia's drug unit.</p>
