	<p class="article-leader">Chemical joint venture Enimont S.p.A. reported a plunge in
first-half operating profit as the downturn in the world
chemical industry and the Italian company's continuing
internal problems took their toll.
   However the performance was broadly in line with the
company's own budget forecasts, and in some respects better
than anticipated.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gross operating income fell to 937 billion lire ($772
million) in the first half of this year from 1.42 trillion
lire in the first six months of 1989, although it was only
slightly below the budget forecast of 955 billion lire.</p>
<p>Sales slipped to 7.53 trillion lire from 8.21 trillion a
year earlier. Operating profit totaled 477 billion, compared
with a budget forecast of 491 billion and a first-half 1989
operating profit of 999 billion. Gross pretax income was 182
billion lire in the first six months of this year, above the
forecast 61 billion but well below the 693 billion recorded
in the first half of 1989.</p>
