	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Corona Corp. radically altered its plans to
secure control of Canada's hottest gold prospect and said it
would pursue talks with rival Placer Dome Inc. Analysts and
some Corona officials expect the talks will result in joint
ownership of the rich ore deposit.
   Corona said it was pressured to change its plans after
Murray Pezim, a Corona director and honorary chairman,
refused to deliver to Corona his shares in Prime Resources
Group Inc. under a previous agreement. Mr. Pezim also is
chairman of Prime Resources, which owns, together with
Stikine Resources Ltd., the Eskay Creek gold property in
northwestern British Columbia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Eskay Creek has estimated reserves of about 4.8 million
ounces of gold, worth about $1.73 billion at current market
prices.</p>
<p>Under its revised proposal, Toronto-based Corona said it
dropped plans to spin off its gold assets into a separately
listed subsidiary and to acquire Prime Resources by swapping
shares in the subsidiary.</p>
<p>Corona also said it improved the terms of an offer to
Stikine's major shareholders, who had committed to Corona
their 42% stake. For each Stikine share, holders will receive
one new Corona preferred share that will be redeemable at a
later date into either 8.5 Corona Class A subordinate voting
shares or 70 Canadian dollars (US$60.14) in cash. Corona said
it plans to offer, subject to regulatory approval, the same
terms to other Stikine holders to increase its stake to 55%.</p>
<p>Placer Dome, a Vancouver, British Columbia, gold mining
concern, has offered C$67.50 a share for Stikine, valuing the
company at about C$225 million. The bid by Placer, which
already owns 45% of Stikine's shares, expired yesterday, but
the company said it wouldn't have final bid results until
today.</p>
<p>Corona said it agreed to acquire a 7% stake in Prime
Resources from Vancouver financier Jim Pattison. The purchase
price is one Corona Class A share and an amount in cash to
bring the value of the transaction to C$9 a share. Corona
said it also obtained voting rights over the rest of Mr.
Pattison's holdings in Prime Resources, bringing Corona's
voting control in Prime to 34% from 20% currently.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Mr. Pezim, the Corona director,
refused to turn over his shares to Corona's offer unless the
terms were improved. Mr. Pezim said Corona's latest offer "is
what we wanted in the first place."</p>
<p>But Corona spokesman Brian Hay said the company hadn't
made any new offers for Mr. Pezim's holdings. He said Corona
decided not to take Mr. Pezim to court over the previous
agreement to deliver his Prime Resources shares because of
the cost of such a procedure.</p>
<p>On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Corona Class A shares
closed unchanged yesterday at C$7.625 after rising 25
Canadian cents on Tuesday following the Corona announcement.
Stikine shares closed yesterday at C$70, down C$2, after
closing unchanged a day earlier. Placer Dome shares rose 50
Canadian cents Tuesday and 12.5 Canadian cents yesterday to
finish at C$18.50. On the Vancouver Stock Exchange, Prime
Resources shares closed yesterday at C$8.50, up 37.5 Canadian
cents, after losing 87.5 Canadian cents on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Hay said he expects talks between Corona and Placer
Dome to result in a merger of Stikine and Prime Resources
into an operating company to develop the Eskay creek ore
deposit. Production at Eskay Creek isn't expected to begin
before 1993.</p>
<p>"I see a joint venture between Placer and Corona on this
thing," Mr. Pezim said.</p>
<p>Hugh Leggatt, a Placer Dome spokesman, said, "We'd like to
reach an agreement with them {Corona} on the disposition of
the Eskay Creek assets. In principle we're quite prepared to
speak with them."</p>
