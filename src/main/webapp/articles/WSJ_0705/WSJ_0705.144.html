	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co., eager to
boost its share of the electronic messaging market, agreed to
buy most of cash-strapped Western Union Corp.'s Business
Services Group for $180 million.
   The transaction would make AT&T the dominant player in the
electronic-mail industry, with 40% of the market. However, it
needs regulatory approval and Western Union must first
complete the debt restructuring plan aimed at keeping the
company out of bankruptcy law proceedings. The companies said
they expect to complete the all-cash transaction by Sept. 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the plan, AT&T would combine its own electronic
messaging businesses with Western Union's EasyLink electronic
mail business, telex operations and newer services like voice
mail, specialized fax transmission and the
computer-to-computer transmission of information known as
electronic data interchange.</p>
<p>Western Union, based in Upper Saddle River, N.J., would be
left with its Mailgram business and its Financial Services
unit, which includes money transfer and telegram. The assets
being sold accounted for roughly $250 million of Western
Union's $629 million 1989 revenue.</p>
<p>The deal, if passed, would be one of the most significant
transactions between the two companies since their bitter
rivalry for dominance of the communications business before
the turn of the century. At that time, Western Union seemed
an invincible communications giant whose vast network of
telegraph lines criss-crossed America.</p>
<p>But AT&T essentially won that fight when Western Union
committed what is widely considered one of the biggest
corporate blunders ever, by passing up the rights to
Alexander Graham Bell's telephone for $100,000 in 1876. A few
years later, AT&T bought Western Union's interest in Western
Electric Co. and made it the captive supplier of equipment to
the Bell System. For a period of four years in the early
1900s, AT&T controlled Western Union but the U.S. government
forced it to unload its interest in the telegraph company for
antitrust reasons.</p>
<p>Now AT&T will combine Western Union's electronic messaging
businesses into a new business called AT&T Intelligent
Network Services, which will become part of AT&T's Business
Communications Services unit, which had revenue of about $14
billion last year.</p>
<p>"This is a key strategic move to strengthen our position
in global messaging," said John Smart, BCS president. He said
AT&T will initially operate EasyLink, the nation's biggest
electronic mail provider, as a separate entity. The company
will gradually graft EasyLink onto the smaller AT&T Mail
business as AT&T makes the two services' software and
hardware compatible.</p>
<p>For the past two years, Western Union's telex revenue has
fallen more than 25% a year. But Mr. Smart said the decline
has slowed since the end of 1989. He added that AT&T plans to
continue Western Union's strategy of converting telex
customers to EasyLink.</p>
<p>Mr. Smart said the $180 million purchase price represented
"a reasonable premium above the net book value for those
assets," but he declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>A Western Union spokesman said the operation being
acquired by AT&T "is something approaching $250 million {in
revenues}. That's about as close as I can get." He wouldn't
disclose operating profits. In 1989 the entire Business
Services Group posted revenue of $303 million and an
operating profit of $72 million and currently has 1,300
employees.</p>
<p>Western Union's spokesman said the company will file in
the next few days an amended financial restructuring plan
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to reflect the
AT&T transaction. Proceeds from the transaction will be used
to retire a major chunk of Western Union's $530 million in
senior debt.</p>
