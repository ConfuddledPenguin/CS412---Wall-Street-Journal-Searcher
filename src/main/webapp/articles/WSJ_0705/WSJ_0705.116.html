	<p class="article-leader">BUSH AIDES are considering a plan to impose a tax of as
much as 0.5% on the sale of stocks, bonds, futures contracts
and other instruments. The securities industry is already
lobbying against the idea, which the White House sees as a
possible way of making a capital-gains tax cut palatable to

writers in Congress, Bentsen is interested in the proposal,
but Rostenkowski opposes it.
