	<p class="article-leader">BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Mentor Graphics Corp. said a surprising
slowdown in second-quarter orders resulted in profit and
revenue "significantly less" than anticipated.
   The announcement sent the company's stock plunging $4.375,
closing at $17.625 on volume of over 5.6 million shares in
national over-the-counter trading Tuesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The maker of computer-aided design systems said net income
was five cents to 10 cents a share on revenue of $100 million
to $103 million. Net was 29 cents a share on revenue of $106
million a year earlier. Earnings were restated to reflect the
acquisition of Silicon Compiler Systems in March.</p>
<p>Analysts had projected that Mentor Graphics would earn
between 31 cents and 33 cents a share. Company officials
cited stiffening competition in the design automation field
from Hewlett-Packard Co., notably its recent announcement of
new generation workstations.</p>
<p>Thomas Bruggere, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the company had predicted an uncertain year, citing an
"increased risk that order volume could be disrupted." Mr.
Bruggere added that he was "surprised by the severity of the
(earnings) shortfall."</p>
<p>Allen Denison, an analyst with Black & Co. in Portland,
Ore., said Mentor Graphics's problems, in part, reflect a
sluggishness in the high-tech industry in general. He said he
expects earnings to improve in the second half because of the
pending release of new computer systems and a new software
package.</p>
