	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Do you spend hours a week playing bridge? Or
are you a neighborhood chess master?
   Bankers Trust may have a job for you.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a bid to discover new foreign-exchange and bond-trading
talent, Bankers Trust New York Corp., the U.S.'s 10th-largest
bank, is advertising in magazines for chess and bridge
enthusiasts for players who may be interested in turning
their game skills into cold cash -- for themselves and the
bank.</p>
<p>According to the ads, chess and bridge "require certain
finely-honed skills," among them the ability to predict an
opponent's moves, courage to take short-term risks for
long-term gains, and the patience to assess every option
available.</p>
<p>"Interestingly enough, these are the exact skills
necessary to succeed as a trader in the global currency and
securities markets," the ad in Chess Life says.</p>
<p>"It doesn't really matter what your background is" the ad
in Contract Bridge Bulletin emphasizes, "and it could be the
best move you'll ever make."</p>
<p>Bankers Trust won't talk about how it came to advertise
for chess and bridge players. "We really have nothing to
say," says a spokesman for the bank. "We've just placed the
ads and we haven't had any response yet."</p>
<p>But the ads say that the idea came from several of the
bank's best traders, including one highly successful currency
trader who is an international master chess player. "He is
still moving pieces to form a calculated game plan, but now
it is yen and Deutsche marks as well as rooks and knights,"
the ad says.</p>
<p>Competitors have mixed feelings about trolling for trading
talent in hobby magazines. "We just hired some traders, but
we didn't hire them from a bridge club," says the head
currency trader at one bank.</p>
<p>But Carmine Rotondo, chief corporate foreign-exchange
dealer at Security Pacific National Bank, says good traders
have to keep their wits about them. Bridge players, he says,
"tend to be more calm, more acclimated to changing
conditions" than other games players, especially gamblers.
"You wouldn't want a blackjack player on the desk," he says.
"They tend to self-destruct."</p>
<p>Yet another currency trader says bridge and chess players
may be fine, but the people he really wants on his trading
desk "are the guys that scalp tickets outside the stadium."</p>
<p>In any event, traders are well rewarded when they produce
big profits for their employer. While a trader straight from
a bank's training program would probably be paid about
$60,000 a year, senior traders with five years or more
experience earn six-figure salaries with generous bonuses.
That's in return for producing $2.5 million or more in annual
profits for the bank.</p>
<p>How much did you make in your last chess match?</p>
