	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- "Ten days, for . . . what?"
   That irreverent headline in a Moscow youth newspaper this
week aptly summed up the mood of crisis pervading the Soviet
Communist Party's 28th Congress. Rather than setting
grandiose and unrealistic goals for Soviet society, as such
meetings used to do, the congress is engaged in a
hand-wringing debate about the party's declining influence
and ideological vacuum.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Contrary to some expectations, the meeting hasn't turned
into an all-out attack on Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev,
though both he and his Politburo colleagues have taken sharp
criticism. Instead, moderates and hard-line conservatives
have embarked on a painful search for ways to ensure the
future of a party that used to boast it was the future.</p>
<p>"We need to retain socialism, but how?" asks Alexander
Bolatov, a moderate delegate from the Ukrainian coal-mining
town of Donetsk. "Stalin built his model. Now we don't like
that, but we have no new model. We're in an ideological
crisis."</p>
<p>The message from conservatives is similar, if differently
phrased. "One of the most important tasks today is the
defense of socialist and communist ideals," Mukhu Aliyev told
the congress yesterday, to loud applause. "Under the guise of
reform, the party is being pushed out of the political
arena."</p>
<p>The delegates have much to fret about. Under Mr.
Gorbachev's perestroika reform program, the party has given
up its political monopoly and is gradually ceding power to
elected government councils. Its domestic reputation is at an
all-time low; recent polls show most people blame it for
their economic and social ills.</p>
<p>Even the working class it long claimed to represent has
lost faith. Next week, miners plan a one-day nationwide
strike to demand, among other things, the nationalization of
all Communist Party property and an end to party influence in
factories, the KGB, army and police.</p>
<p>A lunchtime conversation echoes a constant refrain:</p>
<p>"The working class is the basis of the party. How come
there are so few workers among the delegates?" asks a Soviet
journalist, puzzled by the preponderance of full-time party
hacks at the congress.</p>
<p>"When workers start delving into politics, there's
something wrong in society," replies Vladimir Sarostov. He
works at a glass factory in Byelorussia, one of just 541
workers among the 4,700 delegates. Peasants, another
constituency long claimed by the party, account for just 255
delegates. In the past, a quota system would have ensured
that many more representatives of the working class showed
up. This time, in a semblance of democracy, congress
delegates were elected instead. Workers either didn't stand
for election, or lost.</p>
<p>The atmosphere at the congress is mainly subdued. Fearful
of exacerbating a growing split that could speed the party's
demise, conservatives have stopped gunning for Mr. Gorbachev.
Even some of his fiercest critics, such as Boris Gidaspov,
the Leningrad Communist chief, and Ivan Polozkov, head of the
newly created Russian Communist Party, say they want him to
stay on as party leader.</p>
<p>But there are flashes of anger. Vadim Medvedev, the
party's ideology chief, is a prime target. Conservatives and
moderates alike criticize him for his pomposity and lack of
ideas. "Comrade Medvedev appears incapable of forming new
debate on ideology," said Yuri Prokofiev, head of the party's
Moscow branch.</p>
<p>Few give Mr. Medvedev much chance of being reappointed to
the 11-man Politburo when the congress elects party leaders
next week. But if he goes, he will be in good company. Three
Politburo colleagues, Vitaly Vorotnikov, Nikolai Slyunkov and
junior member Alexandra Biryukova, have announced plans to
retire. Four others hint that their days in the party
leadership are numbered: Gorbachev confidant Alexander
Yakovlev; Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov; Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze; and Lev Zaikov, who is in charge of
military industry.</p>
<p>If they carry through, Messrs. Yakovlev and Shevardnadze,
and perhaps Mr. Ryzhkov, would still wield power in their
government posts and as members of the presidential council.
But the fact that such important people could even consider
giving up their party posts is a clear sign of the decline of
Communist power.</p>
<p>Still, the party can't be written off. The conservative
majority at the congress is showing signs of making a stand
against Mr. Gorbachev's plans to introduce market-oriented
economic reform. If the congress withholds its support, Mr.
Gorbachev would have difficulty pressing ahead.</p>
<p>Many delegates equate the idea of a market economy with
capitalism. But they concede that decades of socialist
planning have failed to provide the people with basic
necessities. So something has to change, they say.</p>
<p>"You need to convince people why the market is the
savior," says Alexander Kapto, who heads the Central
Committee's ideological department. It is a task that turns
ideology into mental gymnastics.</p>
<p>"A market economy doesn't have to be capitalist," says Mr.
Bolatov, the delegate from Donetsk. How so? "You could have
production on a market basis," he says after thinking for a
bit, "and distribution on a socialist one."</p>
