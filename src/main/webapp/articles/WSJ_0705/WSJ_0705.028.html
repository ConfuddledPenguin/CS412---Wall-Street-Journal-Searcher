	<p class="article-leader">Retailers claim better service depends on linking clerks'
pay to performance. But Dayton Hudson Corp. is discovering it
isn't easy to switch to an incentive-pay plan.
   Unhappy workers at half a dozen Hudson's department stores
in Michigan are attempting to unionize. In the first election
in May, salespeople at the Westland store voted 274 to 179 in
favor of joining the United Auto Workers union. The company
has challenged the results. But one fact is undisputed:
Complaints about the company's Performance Plus pay plan
fueled the union drive.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The experience of the Minneapolis-based department store
chain illustrates the pitfalls retailers are likely to
encounter as more of them attempt to link pay to performance.
Store managers say incentive plans are necessary in today's
competitive environment. But store clerks often say they feel
intimidated by unrealistically high sales goals and threats
of dismissal.</p>
<p>Stores from Bloomingdale's Inc. to R.H. Macy & Co. have
switched to incentive-pay plans in recent years to better
compete with the likes of Nordstrom Inc. The Seattle-based
retailer built a reputation for stellar service by paying
clerks commissions that boost their incomes above the average
clerk's wage. But now, with Nordstrom's sales-growth slowing,
even some of its clerks are griping publicly about the
Darwinian struggle on the sales floor.</p>
<p>Bloomingdale's, however, says its incentive-pay plan has
been a success. The retailer's program, first instituted in
1986, has been adopted in 13 of its 17 stores, including most
of its New York metropolitan locations, a spokeswoman says.
"Even the most unbelieving become believers when they see the
correlation between performance and salary," she says. Macy's
declined to comment on its program.</p>
<p>Dayton Hudson, which has converted to Performance Plus in
11 of its 37 Dayton's and Hudson's stores, which are mostly
in Minnesota and Michigan, now is trying to ease workers'
anxieties by changing some of the most onerous aspects of its
three-year-old program. It also is surveying workers and
re-evaluating whether to convert five more stores this year.
"We were not as effective in listening to our employees as we
should have been," admits Stephen E. Watson, Dayton Hudson's
president.</p>
<p>Under Performance Plus, salespeople are paid a combination
of hourly wages and "bonuses" for exceeding sales quotas. But
the word bonus is a misnomer. Workers are fired for
consistently failing to meet their quotas. And the quarterly
bonuses can sometimes be withheld.</p>
<p>At the store in Westland, a Detroit suburb, employees
contend they were incensed by the firings of a few veteran
salesclerks, who were penalized under the new pay plan.
Because sales quotas are calculated on the basis of hourly
pay, longtime clerks who earn more are required to sell more.
The alternative: dismissal.</p>
<p>Sandra Jedlowski, a clerk earning nearly $9 an hour when
she was fired in 1988, attended union organizing meetings
recently to tell her story. The 52-year-old Mrs. Jedlowski
says she had worked at Hudson's for nearly a decade and had
been one of the highest-paid salespeople in the petite dress
and sportswear department. But she failed to meet her quota
under the incentive-pay program.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jedlowski says the only alternative proposed was to
take a pay cut to lower her quota. She refused. "They had
given me the raises," she says. "I didn't see a reason to
take a cut. What guarantee did I have that they wouldn't fire
me at a lower rate?"</p>
<p>Bob King, director of UAW Region 1A, maintains that
"Hudson's was trying to squeeze out the longtime employees."
Dayton Hudson officials deny the charge.</p>
<p>More recently, as Merredith White, a 20-year-old cosmetics
clerk, tells it, she was unfairly denied a bonus of roughly
$900 because of a single complaint from a customer she didn't
even wait on. "They told me I wouldn't be receiving my bonus
because this was a legitimate customer complaint," she says.</p>
<p>The customer claimed Ms. White ignored him one evening
last December. But Ms. White says she was taking a
well-deserved break. Instead of leaving the sales floor,
however, she sat at a nearby Lancome counter to have her
caricature drawn -- while a Lancome salesclerk kept an eye on
her Estee Lauder area. The Lancome clerk actually waited on
the customer. But Ms. White says the customer apparently
spotted her navy blue Estee Lauder uniform and concluded that
she was shirking her responsibilities.</p>
<p>One of her supervisors agreed, saying clerks aren't
supposed to take breaks so late in the day. Then, Ms. White
says, the supervisor told her to sign a statement
acknowledging that "the customer was very unhappy about his
service" and that Ms. White wouldn't get a fourth-quarter
bonus. The statement also warned that she "could be
terminated" for any more complaints.</p>
<p>Ms. White says she signed, fearing she would be fired if
she refused. "I felt very intimidated. She made me feel like
I should crawl underneath a rug," says Ms. White, who is
still working at Hudson's while attending cosmetology school.</p>
<p>"I feel cheated," she says. "I worked my tail off for that
bonus. Sometimes I wouldn't even take my break."</p>
<p>A Dayton Hudson spokeswoman says "there were other issues
involved" in Ms. White's case. But she declined to elaborate,
saying: "We don't feel it's appropriate to publicly comment
on particular incidents. We believe that's a matter between
the employee and management."</p>
<p>Dayton Hudson officials say a typical salesclerk's annual
wage has risen under Performance Plus to a range of $16,000
to $20,000 from $10,000 to $14,000. But they acknowledge
sweeping changes are under way in the program, partly to
provide more protection for longtime clerks such as those
like Ms. Jedlowski. Salespeople with at least 10 years of
service, for example, will see sales goals fall in August by
a percentage equal to years of service.</p>
<p>The company also changed disciplinary procedures for
clerks, making it tougher to get on the track leading to
dismissal and easier to get off it. Workers facing dismissal
were granted amnesty in April so they could benefit from the
changes. The company says most policy changes aren't
retroactive.</p>
<p>Moreover, the company several months ago stopped
withholding bonuses earned by employees who failed to meet
eight of 10 customer-service standards that some clerks
consider too subjective. Those included approaching
customers, developing a rapport with them and suggesting they
buy additional items.</p>
<p>Dayton Hudson says it now withholds bonuses only for
excessive absenteeism, arguments with other clerks on the
sales floor and customer complaints.</p>
<p>As for complaints, Dennis Toffolo, new president of
Hudson's stores, says bonuses generally can't be withheld
because of a single beef. "And we don't just listen to what
the customer has to say," he says.</p>
<p>Marvin Goldstein, chairman and chief executive of Dayton
Hudson's department store unit, insists the company isn't
trying to intimidate employees. Instead, he says, "We're
trying to enhance their stature in our company and help them
have greater earnings capacity."</p>
