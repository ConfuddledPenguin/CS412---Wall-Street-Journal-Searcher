	<p class="article-leader">Gold staged a pre-holiday rally Tuesday, but some analysts
said its move was due to technical conditions.
   Gold for August delivery gained $3.30 an ounce to settle
at $364.10 in active trading. Don Tierney, a precious metals
analyst at Stanley B. Bell & Co. in New York, said the
strength was surprising for the day before a holiday. The
U.S. market was closed yesterday for Independence Day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Tierney said a lot of Tuesday's buying probably was
done by traders who didn't take profits Friday on short
positions they had sold in anticipation of price declines.
These traders, he said, probably didn't want the profits to
show up in their June or their second-quarter statements.</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney also said gold may have gained strength
because traders in many Middle Eastern countries were
observing a four-day Muslim holiday that will not end until
today. "Investors believe that the massive selling in March,
May and June came from Middle Eastern interests," he said.
"They {were} taking some comfort from the holiday."</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney noted that Tuesday was the fifth consecutive
day that gold had closed higher, with the rally lifting the
August contract by $11.20 an ounce since last Tuesday. The
next technical resistance point, he said, is $365 an ounce.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM Group, a New
York-based metals research consultant, said gold rose because
it closed above $360 an ounce Monday.</p>
<p>"It was simply follow-through buying," he said. "That's
the whole story."</p>
<p>Other analysts attributed gold's strength to recent
weakness in the dollar, but Mr. Christian said that wasn't
much of a contributing factor.</p>
<p>The silver market held modest gains for most of Tuesday's
session. But in the final two minutes of trading, heavy
selling drove prices down. September silver settled two cents
an ounce lower at $4.99 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Mr. Tierney said it was apparent that traders didn't want to
hold any silver positions over the holiday. Earlier, there
was evidence of covering of short positions and fund buying,
according to market technicians.</p>
<p>Mr. Tierney also said a smaller-than-expected number of
delivery notices for silver against the expiring July
contract indicate some support for silver. "The fact that so
few notices are being delivered tells me that {traders
holding previously purchased contracts} want to acquire
silver bullion at these low prices," he said.</p>
<p>Platinum traders wondered why strong cash prices for
rhodium, another metal in the platinum family, weren't
spilling over into their market. October platinum settled at
$494.40 an ounce, down 10 cents. Rhodium was rumored to have
traded at $5,000 an ounce Friday and above $7,000 an ounce
Tuesday. There is no futures market for rhodium, which is
used as a catalyst in emission-control units and in refining.</p>
<p>Mr. Christian of CPM Group said such high prices for
rhodium are actually bearish for platinum. Traditionally, he
said, rhodium is mined as a byproduct of platinum, but that
relationship can become distorted under special conditions
such as those now occurring. He said the rhodium-producing
unit at the Rustenberg platinum mine in South Africa has been
experiencing technical problems in recent months and that
there have been problems lately at several other rhodium
refineries too.</p>
<p>"That means the market was expecting several thousand
ounces of rhodium that never appeared," Mr. Christian said.</p>
<p>Also affecting the relative prices of platinum and rhodium
is the ratio in which the two metals occur in the ore body
from which they are mined. According to Mr. Christian, one
ounce of rhodium is found for every 16 ounces of platinum in
the Merensky reef, the main platinum ore body in South
Africa. This ratio suggests that rhodium should sell for
about 16 times the price of platinum, he said, and the two
metals currently are approaching that price ratio.</p>
<p>However, he said, there is an ore body called UG2 that
yields about one ounce of rhodium for every 4.6 ounces of
platinum. Therefore, "If platinum from the UG2 ore body is at
$500 an ounce, any time rhodium sells for more than $2,300
there is a strong incentive to mine rhodium and let platinum
be the byproduct," Mr. Christian said.</p>
<p>Most platinum still comes from Merensky, he said, but
there is a definite shift toward mining the UG2 ore body
because of the higher concentration of rhodium. "Speculators
who understand the mining economics of these two metals look
at the high price of rhodium and conclude that it is not
bullish for platinum," Mr. Christian said.</p>
<p>Several participants in the European metals trade noted
that the rally in rhodium took place on extremely small
volume. They said that if only a small amount of metal were
offered to the market it could cause a sharp sell-off.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets Tuesday:</p>
<p>LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices for July and August pork belly
futures contracts fell their daily limit of two cents a pound
on heavier-than-expected deliveries of frozen pork bellies to
contract holders. Many of the deliveries were thought to have
been made to speculators rather than commercial users,
according to Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research
Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. That means the speculators are
likely to resell the bellies they have been stuck with,
further depressing prices, Mr. Morgan said. Pork bellies are
used in making bacon. July pork belly futures closed at 57.67
cents a pound, and August bellies closed at 55.77 cents a
pound. Monday was the first day deliveries could have been
made against holders of the July contract, but no deliveries
were made until Tuesday, analysts said. Support for pork
belly futures prices is likely to come from figures released
after the close of trading Tuesday, said Jerry Abbenhaus, a
futures analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
He said the report of 3.6 million pounds of frozen bellies
moving out of warehouses last week was far above analysts'
estimates of one million to 2.5 million pounds. With
warehouse supplies dwindling more rapidly than expected,
futures prices are likely to rebound somewhat, Mr. Abbenhaus
said.</p>
<p>ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices finished slightly higher,
mostly in reaction to a strike by Norwegian offshore oil
workers. Wildcat strikes in defiance of a back-to-work order
from the Norwegian government and the workers' union have
kept crude prices from declining in the face of enormous
inventories and high output by Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries members. Roald Larsen, a Norwegian union
official, was quoted Tuesday as saying strikers were blocking
helicopter landing pads on some platforms to prevent relief
crews from landing. Norway's normal North Sea oil production
is about 1.6 million barrels a day. North Sea Brent crude for
August delivery rose 10 cents a barrel Tuesday to settle at
$15.97, while the August West Texas Intermediate contract
gained eight cents to close at $16.80 a barrel. A prolonged
strike would boost prices for North Sea oil and for other
crudes, especially the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
and certain North African crudes, Lawrence Goldstein,
president of Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said.
News that Saudi Arabia told customers in the Far East that
contract prices for August will be unchanged from July also
was viewed as supportive for prices. However, a report by the
American Petroleum Institute released after trading ended
Tuesday unexpectedly showed an increase in U.S. crude oil
inventories for last week. This report could overwhelm
short-term bullish sentiment, analysts said.</p>
