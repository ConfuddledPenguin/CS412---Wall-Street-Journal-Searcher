	<p class="article-leader">Five years ago, optimistic entrepreneurs in Cambridge,
Mass., erected a billboard proclaiming the area near the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology "AI Alley," in honor of
a host of burgeoning little artificial-intelligence
companies.
   They might as well have focused on "Buggy Whip Boulevard."
Of several Cambridge AI companies widely publicized at the
time, at least three are out of business; the biggest has
shrunk to half its former size, and others have slashed
employment 50% to 90% in desperate attempts to become
profitable.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nationwide, the picture is much the same. The AI industry,
which many market researchers had projected would reach $4
billion in annual sales by now, remains nascent. Generous
estimates of the market today are closer to $600 million.
After swallowing up hundreds of millions of dollars in
venture capital and exciting some of the brightest professors
at top technical schools with visions of riches, hundreds of
AI start-ups have yielded only a few profitable public
companies.</p>
<p>"We're in AI winter," says Richard A. Shaffer, publisher
of Technologic Computer Letter, a New York newsletter on
venture capital and high technology.</p>
<p>These days, the surviving AI companies are trying to
regroup. They are hiring outside managers, trumpeting the
merits of cost-cutting now that venture funds are gone, and
playing up what their products do while playing down the AI
link.</p>
<p>"We're not an AI company. We're not selling, `Get close to
AI,'" says J. Philip Cooper, a former McGraw-Hill Inc.
executive who slashed employment to 45 from 110 after he was
hired to rescue Applied Expert Systems Inc., a Cambridge
maker of "expert systems" for financial planners.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is the art of making computers
mimic ordinary human abilities. Broadly defined, it includes
computerized vision systems that help machines in factories
"see" or let computers analyze aerial photographs; speech
recognition systems that someday may result in language
translators or electronic typewriters that can take
dictation; and robotics systems that guard warehouses or
carry television cameras. The biggest AI market is for expert
systems: software programs that seek to mimic the reasoning
and decision making of specialists in different fields based
on rules of thumb and their data bases of knowledge.</p>
<p>To be sure, AI techniques are showing up in many areas.
American Express Co. says an expert system in its
credit-authorization department saves it millions of dollars
a year by reviewing cardholders' big purchases and
authorizing them in seconds or flagging them for employees to
query. An expert system called Ask Dan About Your Taxes has
been melded into Andrew Tobias's Tax Cut software program.</p>
<p>And hope springs eternal. With new management in place,
this year "will be a turnaround for a lot of these
companies," says Harvey Newquist, president of Relayer Group,
a Scottsdale, Ariz., firm that follows the industry.</p>
<p>Some companies echo that optimism. Industry pioneer AI
Corp., a 15-year-old software company in Waltham, Mass., went
public last week at $9.50 a share, 68 times earnings for the
year ended March 31, a sign that the market may be warming to
AI stocks again. Another AI software company, closely held
five-year-old Neuron Data Corp., Palo Alto, Calif., which had
$8 million in sales last year, projects revenue of $100
million for 1995.</p>
<p>Predicting how high technology will work as business is
notoriously difficult. Few analysts would have picked Apple
Computer Inc. and Compaq Computer Corp. out of the myriad PC
companies 10 years ago. But the ebullient birth and
discouraging collapse of the AI industry go far beyond the
norm.</p>
<p>In retrospect, many people say artificial intelligence
isn't really a market in itself, but rather a series of
techniques for products in many different markets. Lawrence
Weber, a Cambridge marketing consultant, says: "I was
promoting AI as an end-all. It turned out to be an
ingredient. None of us knew that at the time."</p>
<p>Among investors, the situation "was mass delusion," says
Philip A. Cooper, who raised tens of millions of dollars to
start a now-defunct expert system company called Palladian
Corp. in Cambridge. Mr. Cooper, who now heads a venture
capital firm, says, "In the 17th century, people said
`tulips' and the world went nuts. AI was a more virulent case
because it was more difficult to define."</p>
<p>AI companies ran into trouble for a variety of reasons.
Many didn't have a good understanding of the potential
markets. Applied Expert Systems tried to sell a $50,000
package to professional financial planners who were
threatened by a computer that was said to produce better
financial plans than they could. Now the company is marketing
the package to banks and insurance companies as a tool that
will let employees produce financial plans quickly for
customers.</p>
<p>Other products were too expensive. In the early 1980s,
LISP Machine Inc., Xerox Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc. all
designed workstations that ran on LISP, the language of
choice for early AI work, and predicted big sales. But
customers balked at the cost, which ran as high as $100,000,
and eventually figured out ways to make LISP run on existing
workstations and PCs. LISP Machine disappeared from public
view after filing for Chapter 11 protection from creditors;
Xerox is out of the business, and Texas Instruments' AI
effort now emphasizes software and consulting.</p>
<p>Some companies had problems because executives came from
academic backgrounds and gave short shrift to marketing. Mr.
Cooper, who took over Applied Expert Systems, says one
important innovation was diverting some research money to
develop a training video and cue cards to teach customers how
to use the company's products. John S. Wurts, who was brought
in from a successful software company to turn around
Symbolics Inc., says he discovered that salespeople at the
Cambridge company didn't realize they had to sell to senior
management and data processing managers as well as
technicians within companies.</p>
<p>Many AI companies headed by well-funded academics spent
money freely, says Mr. Newquist of Relayer Group. He says
money-losing companies threw lavish parties at AI
conventions. Mr. Wurts says Symbolics, started by veterans of
MIT's AI laboratory, paid programmers $60,000 to $90,000 a
year, 30% more than they would get now. At its peak,
Symbolics had 1,100 employees and planned to hire 600 more.
Mr. Wurts consolidated in cheaper office space Symbolics
operations that had been split up among three high-priced,
elegantly furnished facilities in Cambridge, suburban Boston
and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Russell Noftsker, Symbolics's founder and former chief
executive, says the company "had a proprietary advanced
technology. We could command the price margins that would
allow us to support that structure." Symbolics could have
been a player in the booming workstation market, he says, if
the company's venture capitalists hadn't delayed funding for
a low-priced microprocessor version. Instead, he says,
pricing pressure from other companies "brought our revenue
down faster than we could cut costs."</p>
<p>Growth turned to wrenching retrenchment. Symbolics's
employment has plunged by more than two-thirds to 350 people.
Sales, which had soared to $114.2 million in 1986 from $1.8
million in 1982, fell to $67.2 million in the year ended June
30, 1989, when the company had a small profit. Revenue fell
18% in the first nine months of fiscal 1990, and the company
expects to post a loss for the year.</p>
<p>Several software companies likewise spent too much and
overestimated the market, and their stocks have performed
poorly. Intellicorp Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., maker of
AI tools used by programmers to write expert systems, went
public in 1983 and traded as high as $17, but closed recently
at $6. After several erratic years, it expects to post its
second straight year of profits, with sales topping $20
million, analysts say. Teknowledge Inc., which went public in
1986 at $13, was eventually acquired by a Pittsburgh company
called Cimflex in a stock swap; the stock of Cimflex
Teknowledge Corp. is now under $1 a share.</p>
<p>Even at struggling companies, executives remain believers
in the technology. But they fear that the industry's lack of
commercial success will hurt interest. "When the AI industry
started going down, an awful lot of people said, `I guess AI
isn't any good,'" says Mr. Wurts of Symbolics. "It's
important for the future of the U.S. that people understand
this stuff is a real competitive weapon."</p>
