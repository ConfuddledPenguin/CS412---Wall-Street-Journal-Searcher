	<p class="article-leader">Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. said its Pickands Mather & Co. unit
agreed to restructure the ownership and operation of the
jointly run Savage River iron ore mines in Australia.
   Terms weren't disclosed. But Cleveland-Cliffs, a
Cleveland-based iron ore mining concern, said the transaction
would have a "material effect" on its financial position and
its current year operating results.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Savage River properties are a joint venture managed by
Pickands Mather in Tasmania. Under the restructuring accord,
effective Oct. 1, Pickands Mather will acquire 100% of the
interests of the current Australian, U.S. and Japanese
participants, including the 36% interest of a company
affiliate.</p>
<p>In turn, Pickands Mather said it agreed to reduce iron ore
production to 1.3 million tons, from the current capacity of
2.5 million tons. Operations are expected to continue through
1995, with production, mostly iron ore pellets, being
marketed to customers in Australia, Japan and Korea.</p>
<p>Continued operation will maintain about 300 jobs,
Cleveland-Cliffs said.</p>

<p>CLEVELAND-CLIFFS Inc. said a transaction to restructure
ownership of the Savage River iron ore mines in Australia
would not have a "material effect" on the company's financial
position or operating results. An earlier edition misstated
the company's position.</p>
