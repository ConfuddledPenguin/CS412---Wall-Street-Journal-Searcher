	<p class="article-leader">I fear it is necessary to return again, the third time in
as many columns, to the topic of Israel. This is not because
I am monomanic on the subject but because in a second letter
Steven Emerson continues to assert that I have been
practicing deceptions upon the readers of The Wall Street
Journal. So it is necessary to respond one last time.
   What is the prime issue on the table as regards Israel,
the Palestinians and the U.S.? Surely it is the right to
self-determination of the indigenous Palestinian inhabitants
of the territories and Gaza, which have been occupied by
Israel since 1967.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Successive Israeli governments have not only denied
Palestinians that right, but even the right to select their
own representatives at any negotiation. In this, Israel has
been abetted by the U.S. and so long as the U.S. persists in
this rejectionist policy nothing is going to change.</p>
<p>People often forget how extraordinary this rejectionism
is. Suppose Zionists had been excluded from negotiations over
the fate of Palestine in 1947. Such exclusion would have been
denounced as grotesque. Yet when today Palestinians
overwhelmingly regard the PLO as their proper representative
they are refused the right to such representation by Israel
and the U.S., and the U.S. press here takes it for granted
that there can be no equality of rights.</p>
<p>A prime task for lobbyists and propagandists for the
Israeli government in this country is to proclaim
simultaneously that this rejectionism is just but that Israel
is virtuously eager to continue the "peace process." Here is
where Mr. Emerson enters the story. When Ami Popper shot to
death seven Palestinians last May, Mr. Emerson hastened to
assert in these pages that Israel's humane values had been
demonstrated by denunciation of the killings across "the
entire political spectrum."</p>
<p>By way of response I suggested that Popper's deeds be set
in a context of verbal and physical violence toward
Palestinians exercised by the armed forces and by right-wing
settlers encouraged by the Israeli government. I also cited
evidence that Israel has not the slightest intention of ever
yielding any part of the territories to Palestinians and that
indeed the notion of deporting or "transferring" Palestinians
out of the territories altogether is gaining in political
respectability.</p>
<p>Some of my examples Mr. Emerson never contested or has
ceased to do so. So yes, Lt. Col. Yehuda Meir did indeed
order his soldiers to break the arms and legs of Palestinian
villagers in Huwara and Bita. In fact, Col. Meir broke down
in court last week, said the army had been ordered to do this
by Interior Minister Yitzhak Rabin, that he was being "thrown
to the wolves" as a scapegoat. Yes, prominent Israeli
politicians have called for "transfer."</p>
<p>But Mr. Emerson is still reluctant to concede that Rabbi
Moshe Levinger, a leader of the extremist settler group the
Gush Emunism recently convicted of killing a Palestinian
shopkeeper and at the time about to go to prison for that
crime, was an honored presence at the anniversary
celebrations for the illegal West Bank settlement of Elkana;
that Chaim Herzog, president of Israel, pandered to extremist
settlers at that same celebration. Finally, Mr. Emerson
insists that when Rabbi Moshe Neriya enjoined every Jew
without thinking and without hesitation "to shoot Arabs right
and left" he was speaking only of shooting in self-defense.</p>
<p>These are not trivial matters. Suppose, in this country,
that one of the Joint Chiefs attended a Klan rally and
fraternized with the Grand Wizard; or that the president of
France attended a racist rally, wearing the insignia of
LePen's movement; or that the Rev. Ian Paisley enjoined all
Protestant Ulstermen to "shoot Catholics left and right
without thinking and without hesitating." It would be big
news.</p>
<p>So it was with the celebration and the statement of Rabbi
Neriya at Elkana, even though Mr. Emerson cannot bring
himself publicly to acknowledge the fact. Exactly as I quoted
him, Gideon Levi of Ha'aretz took particular pains to record
the intimacies between the convicted Levinger and Israel's
third most senior army officer: "Who didn't hug Levinger? The
head of the army's central Command warmly shook the hand of
the rabbi-convict. . . . Yep, he's one of the boys, Levinger,
even among senior army officers."</p>
<p>Did President Chaim Herzog pander to extremist settler
sentiment? Mr. Emerson dismisses the significance of the
knitted cap Mr. Herzog donned for the occasion and claims
that when he used the Hebrew word "ger" to describe
Palestinian residents in the area he was describing them as
"non-Jewish neighbors." In his description in Ha'aretz of the
events at Elkana, Mr. Levi particularly noted the president
"was quick to put on a skull cap -- not his usual black
velvet one, but a knitted one, appropriate for settlers."
"Ger" means "foreigner" or "stranger," and the implications
of a word describing indigenous Palestinians as "strangers"
or "foreigners" would be obvious to Ha'aretz's readers.</p>
<p>And Rabbi Neriya? In his letter of June 27 Mr. Emerson
makes a show of announcing that he telephoned Ha'aretz
reporter Dan Margalit to ask whether the infamous injunction
"to shoot right and left" had been "a call for mass murder."
"Absolutely not," he quotes Mr. Margalit as responding. But
the words "mass murder" are Mr. Emerson's, not mine. All I
did was quote what the rabbi said, and if Mr. Emerson had
lingered on the phone he could have asked Mr. Margalit to
read him his Ha'aretz story of May 13, which began with the
description of Rabbi Neriya's statement as "a hair-raising
document written by the most senior religious-national
educator." Mr. Margalit then denounced Rabbis Levinger and
Neriya, saying that the "right of self-defense" has its rules
and these "prohibit shooting at random and in a reckless
manner, without identifying the target, and these rules are
what Levinger and Neriya want to destroy." Mr. Margalit later
refers in the same story to "the blatantly illegal Halachic
ruling of the educator -- rabbi (i.e. Neriya) to shoot right
and left without thinking."</p>
<p>The words Mr. Emerson so dutifully defends provoked
outrage in Israel. For example, the Israeli novelist Amos Oz
said in a speech quoted in the May 28 London Independent
concerning Rabbi Neriya: "Not even during the worst battles,
not even during Israel's most bitter wars has anyone ever
dared to preach that thinking ought to cease, and be replaced
by indiscriminate shooting `left and right.'"</p>
<p>Once again Mr. Emerson has the effrontery to denounce the
human-rights activist Israel Shahak, this time as a man who
"has called Jews `Nazis' who run `concentration camps.'"
Prof. Shahak is a survivor of the Warsaw ghetto and of
Bergen-Belsen, and if Mr. Emerson took the trouble to study
what Prof. Shahak has long been saying he would know Prof.
Shahak has been very precise. He has said Israel's policies
in the territories can be compared with the policies used by
the Nazis against Jews from 1934 to 1939. This is
unquestionably true even though it is apparently the life's
mission of people like Mr. Emerson to proclaim otherwise and
to denounce anyone who dares suggest that only recognition of
Palestinian rights to self-determination will end these
terrible blemishes on the conduct of the Israeli state.</p>
