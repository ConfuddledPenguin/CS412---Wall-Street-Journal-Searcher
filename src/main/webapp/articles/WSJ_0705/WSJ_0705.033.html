	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- UAL Corp. said June traffic at its United
Airlines unit climbed 8.4% to 6.91 billion revenue passenger
miles from 6.37 billion a year earlier. A revenue passenger
mile is one paying passenger flown one mile.
   The airline's June load factor, or the percentage of
available seats occupied, slipped to 70.9% from 72.2%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Domestic traffic eased less than 1% to 5.02 billion
revenue passenger miles from 5.03 billion a year earlier. But
overseas traffic rose significantly, the company said, citing
recently instituted trans-Atlantic flights and more
substantial Pacific routes.</p>
<p>In the first six months, United's traffic rose 7.3% to
35.84 billion revenue passenger miles from 33.41 billion a
year earlier. The load factor increased to 65.5% from 64.9%.</p>
