	<p class="article-leader">THRIFTS IN LIMBO: S&Ls hobble along while awaiting
government sale.
   Some 256 S&Ls thrash in conservatorship, a kind of
no-saver's-land between receivership and going on the block.
"It's like a ship with no rudder" staying open pending sale,
says Richard White, president of Midwest Federal Savings,
Minot, N.D. Resolution Trust Corp. sends a managing agent who
often curtails activity. Generally not allowed: new loans;
maturities beyond six months; top rates or ad promotions.
That makes it tough to keep even the most loyal customers.
"We're not competitive," sighs Mr. White. Deposits fell 10%
to $510 million at Midwest since the end of 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>George Bragg, new president of Sooner Federal in Tulsa,
Okla., visited every one of the thrift's branches to stem
outflows last year. "I talked with 900 customers," says Mr.
Bragg, who also has had political aspirations. Sooner lost
$80 million of its $1.2 billion in deposits. Managers also
fled, but he says the thrift "spread responsibility" and now
has "a more efficient staff." RTC, meanwhile, speeds up
sales.</p>
<p>RTC figures 60% of the thrifts were "victimized by
criminal activity."</p>
<p>FIDO'S A FATSO, say pet food companies pushing new "lite"
products.</p>
<p>"Lots of cats and dogs sit with their owners and watch TV
when they used to be out chasing birds," says Elizabeth
Hodgkins of Hill's Pet Products. To combat an "epidemic of
overweight," the Colgate-Palmolive unit offers high-fiber,
low-fat "maintenance" pet food as well as prescription
products. Ralston Purina adds Pro Plan Lite for cats on the
paws of Tender Vittles Lite. Purina's Fit & Trim for dogs --
its pioneer product -- is still a big seller in the $5.8
billion supermarket pet food field.</p>
<p>Snacks are always a problem: one extra-large Milk-Bone has
254 calories. Ms. Hodgkins suggests withholding some of
doggie's canned food, baking it and "cutting it into little
bites" for treats. Wesley Bayles, a Washington, D.C., vet, is
more generous, but he confesses to being overweight himself.
"My evaluation of a dog's weight may not be the same as some
skinny veterinarian's." His own black Lab manages to stay a
trim 72 pounds on dog food and the odd pizza crust.</p>
<p>FIRST-DAY DOCS lay hands on patients this month. Should
you be one?</p>
<p>The academic year begins in teaching hospitals as interns
fresh from medical school join newly-advanced residents in a
changing-of-the guard. Turnover of the so-called house staff
means a patient can have one team of doctors on June 30 and
another on July 1 -- provoking anxiety all around. But a
recent study led by Dr. Eugene C. Rich of the University of
Kentucky College of Medicine, found that quality of care
didn't suffer during the summer months. However, the length
of hospitalization rose -- and so did the bill.</p>
<p>The report, published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, drew criticism from Dr. Jeffrey L.
Kaufman, of Albany (N.Y.) Medical College, for counting
readmissions, death and nursing home placement rather than
more relevant criteria like quality of written orders or
correctness of drug dosage. His advice? Ask your doctor if
the hospital has a transition strategy. If not, "I'd say wait
a little bit." If so, "it's perfectly reasonable to go in."
Dr. Sol Sherry, former chief of medicine at Philadelphia's
Temple University Hospital, says overlapping the teams helps
greatly.</p>
<p>"It's a pressure cooker," Dr. Sherry says of the
transition. But "we never had a great problem."</p>
<p>A ROOM WITH A VIEW isn't enough. In New York, Hotel
Macklowe promises to deliver faxes within minutes while the
Empire Hotel says voice mail assures correct messages for
guests. Boston's Lafayette Swissotel rents cellular phones.</p>
<p>GETTING SOAKED is good for the garden and the conscience
with a water-saving hose made of recycled tires. Moisture
Master Soaker Hose seeps slowly. Cost: $12 to $15 for 50
feet.</p>
<p>VANITIES FOR THE BONFIRE? Liebert Autobiographies will
publish your bio from taped recollections for $2,246. For
$600 more, they'll update it a few years later.</p>
<p>HAZARDOUS TO YOUR LOAN: Concern over toxic materials
clouds lending.</p>
<p>Commercial loans and multifamily housing projects have
been subject to environmental audits for some time. Now, as
lists of hazardous substances and potential liabilities grow
well beyond asbestos and radon, some lenders feel the home
mortgage may be the next big risk. There aren't the typical
business-site hazards, "but more lenders are becoming more
sensitive to other kinds of problems," says Warren Tyler of
State Savings Bank, Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>Mr. Tyler, a former state EPA director, predicts lawn
chemicals and drinking water are the next potential concerns.
Others point to backyard, underground fuel-storage tanks. In
Massachusetts, state law says prospective homeowners must
agree to remove lead-based paint from certain surfaces if a
child under six will live in a house built before 1978. But
enforcement has been feeble. Part of the problem: budget
cuts.</p>
<p>Chemical Bank's first-stage environmental audit for a
multifamily project costs $2,000 to $3,000.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: The pro shop at Pebble Beach offers a $12,300 set
of clubs: iron heads are cast from a Queen Elizabeth II
propeller, woods are persimmon. . . . Waldbaum's supermarket
in Port Chester, N.Y., speeds up with 15- and 20-item express
lines.</p>
