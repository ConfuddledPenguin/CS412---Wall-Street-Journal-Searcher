	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- After six months in the red, the nation's
brokerage firms finally eked out a profit in the second
quarter, analysts say.
   But earnings are hardly rosy for the beleaguered brokerage
houses. Second-quarter profits, although an improvement over
the two previous quarters, will be down as much as 35% from
year-earlier levels when they are announced later this month,
some analysts say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Profitability for a lot of the firms is still poor," says
Alison Deans, a brokerage analyst at Primerica Corp.'s Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.</p>
<p>Still, even meager profits will be a welcome relief for
the 350 New York Stock Exchange broker-dealers doing business
with the public. As a group, the brokerage firms had a pretax
loss of $91.7 million in last year's fourth quarter -- the
first industrywide loss since the quarter that included the
1987 stock-market crash.</p>
<p>And the Big Board is expected to soon report that in the
1990 first quarter, the 350 broker-dealers had a $486 million
pretax loss, in part due to a surge in interest rates,
industry executives say.</p>
<p>The recent red ink also reflects big onetime retrenchment
charges by industry leaders Merrill Lynch & Co. in the fourth
quarter and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in this year's first
quarter.</p>
<p>Now Shearson (which had a record $915 million
first-quarter loss) is telling analysts it made money in the
second quarter; the American Express Co. unit could wind up
making a respectable $100 million for the remainder of the
year, says James Hanbury, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder &
Co.</p>
<p>The brokerage industry's expected second-quarter earnings
will look particularly poor compared with the robust 1989
second quarter. That quarter was a blockbuster, with several
firms riding big bond-trading windfalls. Salomon Inc., for
one, reported a record $253 million net income.</p>
<p>The problems crimping Wall Street's bottom line are
daunting. Even with near-record levels in the stock market
this year, trading activity remains moribund. New York Stock
Exchange volume has averaged about 155 million shares a day
this year, down 17% from its 1987 peak. Individual-investor
activity has spurted, but remains far below the levels seen
before the stock-market crash.</p>
<p>Moreover, Wall Street has been pummeled by a sharp drop in
investment-banking and underwriting revenue. The volume of
mergers and acquisitions that have generated big advisory
fees for Wall Street has tumbled to a seven-year low. And in
the second quarter, fees from underwriting stocks and bonds
plunged 29.4% from a year earlier, according to Securities
Data Co.</p>
<p>For the full year, underwriting revenue will be the lowest
for Wall Street since 1984, predicts Michael Goldstein, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. "This is a pretty
mediocre investment banking year," he says. "There aren't a
lot of bright spots."</p>
<p>The most active underwriting areas are the least lucrative
for securities firms: mortgage and asset-backed securities.
"The nature of the business now is lower margins," says Smith
Barney's Ms. Deans.</p>
<p>Even Bear Stearns Cos., which is benefiting most from the
surge in mortgage-backed securities, should fall short of its
year-ago profit, analysts say, although the firm is expected
to do better than it did in the prior quarter. Salomon and
Morgan Stanley Group Inc. were aided in the first quarter by
big trading gains; they aren't expected to match their
first-quarter earnings, or those of the year-earlier period,
analysts say.</p>
<p>"Firms will be fortunate if their earnings in the second
quarter equal the first," says Perrin Long, senior securities
analyst at Lipper Analytical Services Inc. "In some
instances, they could be down sharply."</p>
<p>Here are how some analysts view the biggest publicly
traded brokerage firms:</p>
<p>SALOMON: Even with expected big refining gains in its
Phibro Energy unit, Salomon isn't likely to come anywhere
near its year-earlier performance of $1.73 a share. Profits
from bond trading, a big driver in Salomon's first-quarter
earnings, were pared by a sudden burst of bond-market
volatility last week, several analysts said. Smith Barney's
Ms. Deans, who earlier had raised her second-quarter estimate
to $1 a share from 60 cents, said Salomon "may have given
back" some trading gains because of the recent bond-market
gyrations. Other analysts think Salomon will earn about 75
cents a share.</p>
<p>MORGAN STANLEY: Some analysts expect Morgan Stanley to
have one of its weakest quarters in the last two years,
earning between $1.80 to $2 a share. Like Salomon, Morgan
isn't expected to report big bond and foreign-exchange
trading profits, as it did in the first quarter. Its year-ago
results of $2.83 a share were bolstered by a big
merchant-banking gain that won't be repeated. Wertheim
Schroder's Mr. Hanbury expects Morgan's return on equity to
fall to 16% -- "low for them, but still tops for the
industry," he says.</p>
<p>BEAR STEARNS: A pickup in its mortgage-backed securities
and trade-processing operations is expected to help Bear
Stearns record respectable earnings of about 42 cents a
share. That would be below its year-earlier profit of 45
cents a share, despite the firm's strict cost consciousness.</p>
<p>MERRILL LYNCH: Merrill is likely to repeat its lackluster
first-quarter earnings of 34 cents a share, analysts say.
That would be sharply below the 62 cents a share reported a
year earlier. "Expenses have to be down to prevent a
wipeout," says Mr. Hanbury. Cost cutting at the nation's
biggest securities firm is still slogging along, several
analysts say.</p>
<p>SHEARSON LEHMAN: After its monumental first-quarter
charge, Shearson is likely to post its first operating profit
in three quarters, analysts say. Although its restructuring
has led to some meaningful cost reductions, some analysts
remain skeptical of reading too much into second-quarter
results. That's because Shearson typically books between $25
million and $30 million in pretax fees from customers'
Individual Retirement Accounts and Keogh plans during the
second period.</p>
<p>PAINEWEBBER GROUP INC.: PaineWebber is expected to do
better than the first quarter, earning about 25 cents a
share. That would be down from 33 cents a share last year.
Despite a recent pickup in individual-investor activity,
however, the firm still disappoints several analysts because
of PaineWebber's continuing poor performance in investment
banking. "Profits have gone from subpar to mediocre," says
Ms. Deans, and won't go much higher until individual
investors return to the stock market in a big way.</p>
