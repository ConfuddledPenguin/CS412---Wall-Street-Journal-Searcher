	<p class="article-leader">Those who spent the past week trying to divine the meaning
of President Bush's words on taxes focused on one phrase.
Early on -- the first time the issue came up publicly -- the
president acknowledged a need for greater "tax revenues."
Later, at the week's end, the president said that in his
negotiations to solve the budget problem a number of things
would be considered "including tax increases." The difference
here between "higher tax revenues" and "tax increases" is
crucial. The important fact is that, the government's new
posture notwithstanding, the two do not usually coincide.
   One way to raise tax revenues, Mr. Bush's first stated
goal, would be to cut the capital-gains tax. Ever since
maximum tax rates on capital gains were increased by 65%
after the 1986 reform, many more investors have preferred
immediate interest income to possible future gains. Companies
in recent years have catered to this preference by increasing
their debt/equity ratios through stock buybacks and leveraged
buy-outs. The result has been larger corporate interest
deductions, and therefore smaller taxable profits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A lower capital-gains tax would therefore raise corporate
tax receipts by tilting the debt-equity decision back toward
equity, while making it possible for credit-constrained small
entrepreneurs to raise capital by selling stock. Interest
rates would be held down by the reduced business demand for
credit, as well as by the increased incentive for individuals
to hold taxable bonds for capital gains, thus reducing the
government's interest expense.</p>
<p>A lower capital-gains tax would also increase the pace at
which capital gains were realized, raising revenues directly
as well as through the increased economic growth arising from
more efficient mobility of capital. It would bid up the value
of assets subject to the capital-gains tax and thus raise the
amount of taxable gain, move more venture capital out of
tax-exempt funds into the hands of taxable individuals, raise
personal incentives to save and to take longer-term risks and
greatly reduce the cost of the S&L bailout by raising the
value of the thrifts' real estate and bonds. A lower
capital-gains tax could shave tens of billions off the
deficit.</p>
<p>As the chart shows, inflation-adjusted federal revenues
have expanded at an unprecedented rate since fiscal 1983 (see
accompanying illustration -- WSJ July 5, 1990). Measured in
constant 1982 dollars, tax revenues were nearly stagnant
during the 1970s, hovering between $500 and $600 billion.
Since 1980, real federal revenues have increased by more than
one-third, Tax collections are about the same percentage of
GNP as they were 10 years ago, but, thanks largely to the
Reagan tax cuts, the U.S. economy is nearly one-third larger
largely because the 1980s were the years of important tax
cuts.</p>
<p>If the government in 1980 had instead set out to increase
taxes by one-third average federal tax rates would have had
to have been increased by one-third. It is hard to believe
the economy could have grown at all in the 1980s under such
an onerous tax increase, much less experienced, as it did, a
huge increase in growth.</p>
<p>Even a seemingly modest increase in tax rates on incomes
or sales can be selfdefeating. In the short run, it can cause
a recession. In the long run, it can slow economic growth.
Yet the U.S. government's own budgetary accountants' revenue
estimates from various increases in tax rates always assume
that taxes do no damage whatsoever to the economy.</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office predicts, for example,
that a one percentage point increase in the corporate tax
rate would yield an extra $1.3 billion next year, on the
untenable assumption that it would have no effect on
corporate investment or employment. But if it really had no
effect, then an extra $65 billion could be collected by
simply raising the corporate tax rate to 84%. A $5 oil import
fee is likewise supposed to raise $7.7 billion on the
assumption that higher energy prices do no damage. If that
made sense, we could raise $65 billion by imposing an oil
import fee to raise prices to $60 a barrel.</p>
<p>Consider a less-extreme example, the $3.8 billion that is
said to be available if the president and Democratic leaders
opt for what is currently a popular "budget fix": Raising
marginal tax rates on high-income families to 33% from 28%.
This is proposed as a "trade" for a lower capital-gains tax,
even though young professional couples with high salaries
often have negligible capital gains, while people nearing
retirement have large capital gains and small taxable
incomes. Since tax reform made the average tax rate virtually
the same as the marginal rate among the top-bracket
taxpayers, an increase of 5 percentage points in marginal
rates amounts to a brutal increase of nearly 18 percentage
points in average tax rates. That increase would amount to a
$10,000 added burden on a taxable income of $200,000.</p>
<p>To avoid that, though, affected taxpayers would hold more
tax-exempt bonds and make greater use of the lower
alternative minimum tax; many more salaried people would
become self-employed; professionals would play more golf and
retire earlier. The alleged $3.8 billion revenue increase,
which assumes that people don't react to their taxes, would
soon turn out to be an "unexpected" loss.</p>
<p>Raising the top tax rate to 33% could hurt the economy,
and therefore the budget, in many different ways. The higher
tax rate on interest income and dividends would raise
interest rates and sink the stock market by reducing the
demand for taxable securities. Those losses in the stock and
bond markets would in turn damage the budget (through higher
interest expense, lower capital-gains tax receipts, weak
taxable sales and profits due to reduced wealth, etc.). The
result of such a higher tax rate could easily widen the
budget deficit by tens of billions of dollars for many years
to come.</p>
<p>The alleged beneficial effect of higher tax rates on
savings is another myth arising from static accounting. The
whole idea assumes that higher tax rates would in fact yield
higher revenues over time, that higher revenues would
actually be devoted to reduced deficits and that increasing
the government's revenue at the expense of the private sector
would not reduce the private sector's ability or willingness
to save. Not one of these assumptions is consistent with
experience. Instead, the ability of private households and
firms to save would be seriously undermined by higher tax
rates on what people earn or buy, and the value of U.S.
stocks, bonds and real estate would also be depressed by the
reduction in prospective after-tax returns.</p>
<p>Actually, the U.S. has had some instructive experience
with trying to raise federal revenues by increasing the tax
share of GNP, rather than by increasing GNP itself. The first
major effort was in mid-1932, when individual income tax
rates were roughly tripled. Revenues subsequently fell by
16%. The next experiment was the surtax of 1969-70. Interest
rates rose sharply for many months after the higher rates
were imposed, falling only as the economy was shoved into a
recession that did not end until the surtax was removed.</p>
<p>Then there were the unlegislated tax increases resulting
from inflation and "bracket creep" in 1974-75 and 1981-82,
when revenues once again declined with the contracting
economy. In fact, federal tax receipts have never exceeded
the current 19.6% of GNP since World War II without tipping
the economy into recession. The option of attaining
significant and sustained "tax revenue increases" through
higher tax rates is a politicians' illusion; it has never
worked.</p>
<p>Couldn't the contractionary effect of higher tax rates by
offset be an easier monetary policy? Not really. Even if
higher tax rates generated more real revenue, which they do
not, it makes no sense to argue that smaller deficits justify
any easier monetary policy than would otherwise be
appropriate. This amounts to saying that if the government
sold fewer bonds, then it could safely print more money. But
bonds and money are not at all the same. Higher tax rates
would weaken the supply side of the economy, while an easy
money policy merely stimulates spending or "demand." The
result of that "policy mix" is always stagflation -- witness
Britain.</p>
<p>There is actually only one way in which real tax revenues
can be significantly increased over the next decade, and that
is the same way that real revenues were increased over the
past decade -- namely, by increases in employment, profits,
capital gains and sales. That is why President Bush's
proposed "growth incentives"lower tax rates on capital gains
-- are not at all inconsistent with real and sustainable "tax
revenue increases." Higher tax rates, on the other hand, are
inconsistent with growth incentives, and therefore with the
preservation of the past decade's remarkable increase in real
revenues.</p>
