	<p class="article-leader">It looks as if voters in California, Oklahoma and Colorado
will vote this fall on limiting the number of terms their
state legislators and other state officials may serve. In
Colorado, voters are also likely to decide if the state
should unilaterally limit the congressional terms of its own
U.S. Senators and Representatives.
   Last week, an initiative signed by one million
Californians qualified for the state's November ballot. It
would limit all state officials to a maximum of two or three
terms, end the Legislature's "golden parachute" pension plan
and limit the amount spent annually by the Legislature on its
operations to $950,000 per member.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A competing initiative to limit terms, sponsored by
California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, is already set
for the ballot. Mr. Van de Kamp, a Democrat, says interest in
limiting terms crosses party lines.</p>
<p>In Oklahoma, voters may go to the polls as early as
September on an initiative to limit state legislators to 12
years of service. As with the President of the United States,
Oklahoma's governor is already limited to two terms. A former
Democratic governor and 30 state legislators have endorsed
the measure.</p>
<p>But Colorado has the most interesting term-limit news.
State Senator Terry Considine is sponsoring an initiative to
limit not only the terms of state officeholders, but also
those of Members of Congress from Colorado. He has already
collected 40,000 of the 50,000 signatures he needs to win
ballot status, and has a month left to gather more.</p>
<p>Mr. Considine argues that getting two-thirds of the states
to call for a constitutional amendment to limit terms and
then securing approval by three-fourths of the states would
take years. A better approach would be the one taken by
states that wanted the popular election of U.S. Senators
early in this century. By the time the 17th Amendment ending
selection of Senators by state legislatures was passed in
1913, nearly half the states were effectively choosing their
Senators by popular vote. Those Senators in turn helped force
Congress to accept nationwide popular elections. The same
principle could force Congress to limit its terms or initiate
other reforms limiting the power of incumbency.</p>
<p>New York attorney Stephen Glazier argued on these pages
last month that each state has the authority under Article I,
Section 4 of the Constitution to limit the right of a
congressional incumbent to stand for re-election. Clause I
gives the states the power to set "the times, places and
manner of holding elections for senators and representatives"
while allowing Congress the power to override any regulations
by majority vote.</p>
<p>Critics of Mr. Glazier argue in the letters column nearby
that in the 1969 case of Powell v. McCormack, the Supreme
Court held that no one can be excluded from serving in
Congress if he or she meets the requirements of age,
citizenship and residency stated in the Constitution (See
related story: "Letters to the Editor: Madison & Hamilton
Settled the Matter" -- WSJ July 5, 1990). However, what the
court actually ruled was that Congress was powerless to
exclude a Member-elect who met those requirements. It was
silent on the issue of state regulation. Its argument against
congressional exclusion was based on the principle that in a
democracy the people should be able to elect whom they
please.</p>
<p>But surely the near-impossibility of defeating an
incumbent today allows Colorado voters to democratically
decide that the only way they can easily remove incumbents is
to limit terms. By a two-to-one margin, voters of all ages
and income groups as well as both parties and sexes favor
this drastic action to break up the incumbents' monopoly.</p>
<p>Critics of the Glazier approach also raise a practical
objection: A state that limits its representatives to 12
years of service would hamper the power of its delegation to
represent the state's interests in Washington.</p>
<p>Mr. Considine says similar arguments were made in Colorado
over the extension of the vote to women and the state's
pioneering law on open government meetings. He says voters
believe the incumbent-entrenched Congress is doing far more
damage to them than any benefits represented by pork-barrel
projects dragged home by committee chairmen. He believes
voters will weigh the political risks and benefits, and if
they favor term limitation the momentum will spread the idea
quickly to other states.</p>
<p>Term limitation is admittedly a blunt weapon, but the
array of incumbent protections Congress has created on its
own behalf forces its use. Without it, citizen interest and
participation in politics will continue to plummet as
elections more and more seem a sullen ratification of the
status quo, rather than competitive contests. No matter what
the outcome of this fall's term-limitation initiatives, the
campaigns around them promise to be anything but dull and
routine.</p>
