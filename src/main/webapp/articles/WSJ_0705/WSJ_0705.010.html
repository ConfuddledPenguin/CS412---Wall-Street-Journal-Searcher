	<p class="article-leader">Nelson Mandela's visit to the U.S. reminded us just how
far away from racial reconciliation South Africa remains. In
fact, each uncertain step the South African government takes
seems only to heighten tension.
   So who will unite the divided nation? One immediately
thinks of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, whose bold opposition to
apartheid won him a Nobel Prize. But the Anglican churches
over which he presides remain heavily segregated. Even his
own congregation is nearly all black.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, the grass-roots work is being done by a group
of Christians without international recognition: South
African charismatics. The idea of charismatics having a
serious socio-political impact may sound strange to American
ears. In this country, charismatic and Pentecostal forms of
Christianity have been more associated with emotional worship
and speaking in tongues -- and, more recently, with lavish
life styles and theme parks.</p>
<p>But in South Africa the results of this enthusiastic form
of religious experience have been far different. Not that
South Africa's charismatics started out to be political.
However, in the South African context, just the act of
building large churches where blacks and whites mingle
harmoniously is a political statement. And that is exactly
what the charismatics have done.</p>
<p>Probably the most significant of these integrated
congregations is Ray Macauley's Rhema Church in Johannesburg.
Mr. Macauley graduated from Tulsa, Okla.-based evangelist
Kenneth Hagin's Bible school in 1981 and returned to South
Africa to preach an apolitical message of emotional, physical
and financial wholeness for all who would accept God's
promises. The church he founded now has 10,000 members, about
one-fourth of them black.</p>
<p>Rhema is just one of a dozen charismatic congregations
with integrated memberships of 1,000 or more. The racial
balance varies. More important than the specific proportions,
though, is the fact that these large churches and innumerable
smaller ones constitute a substantial social movement
consciously committed to racial equality and intermingling.</p>
<p>Karla Poewe, professor of anthropology at the University
of Calgary, who (along with her husband, religious studies
professor Irving Hexham) has extensively studied South
African charismatics, found remarkable changes in racial
attitudes among members of these churches. Many of them,
especially the blacks, were initially attracted by the
rousing, energetic style of charismatic worship, a definite
departure from the staid formalism of most South African
churches.</p>
<p>For most newcomers, sitting beside a worshiper of another
race was a breakthrough. Ms. Poewe found that only four of
the 150 church members she interviewed retained a reactionary
stance on race relations. Most members reported having
interracial friendships for the first time.</p>
<p>Along with employing both quantitative and qualitative
forms of analysis, Ms. Poewe watched as whites and blacks
spontaneously, unhesitatingly chatted after services. "Every
indicator we have," she concluded, "shows a change in racial
attitudes from reactionary to enlightened."</p>
<p>These churches have done more than integrate their
services. Two charismatic ministers initiated a "Joweto
Project," its name an amalgam of white Johannesburg and black
Soweto, which in 1984 began taking whites to meetings in
black townships and vice versa. An interracial singing group,
Friends First, came together during a period of prayer and
fasting in 1985 and has released a record entitled "We See a
New Africa"; Nick Paton, son of renowned author Alan Paton,
is one of the singers.</p>
<p>The integrated churches are making a political impact in
spite of themselves -- and losing naivete along the way. Two
years ago they were still thinking they could ignore politics
and just preach the Gospel. Now they are facing pressure not
only from black liberals, who demand radical pronouncements
from them, but also from white conservatives for whom these
churches' visible pattern of racial equality is a quiet but
real threat. Mr. Hexham says the Botha government attempted
to close their integrated day schools, and a South African
scholar told him the government also sought to discredit
these churches by showing TV programs ridiculing their
faith-healing practices.</p>
<p>Though reluctant politicians, some of these charismatics
are beginning to think politically, thanks in part to the
influence of an American import called "Kingdom theology."
Its main proponent, Earl Paulk, pastors an interracial,
10,000-member congregation in suburban Atlanta.</p>
<p>Mr. Paulk emphasizes that the church should be socially
relevant and unhesitant to challenge ungodly "world systems."
His church's size and activism have made it a recognizable,
though nonpartisan force in local politics.</p>
<p>Kingdom theology first entered South Africa four years ago
when a drama written by Mr. Paulk's church was performed at a
church in Durban. Last year Kirby Clements, a black pastor on
Mr. Paulk's staff, traveled there and addressed 2,000 leaders
of the Apostolic Faith Mission, South Africa's largest
Pentecostal group.</p>
<p>"We confronted the classical Pentecostal theology by
saying you can be politically concerned without being
politicized," says Mr. Clements. The result: more
charismatics, both black and white, quietly determined to
link their faith to peaceful methods of social change.</p>
<p>The spirit motivating these charismatics may be the best,
if not the only, path to the elusive goal of racial justice
without bloodshed in South Africa.</p>
