	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- With mutual fund performance, what you see
isn't always what you get.
   Most surveys of fund performance provide investors with
only a rough approximation of what happens in the real world.
That's because they ignore the impact of taxes and sales
commissions paid by investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The total return numbers that you see plastered all over
the place are returns that virtually no investor ever gets,"
says Joe Mansueto, president of Morningstar Inc., a Chicago
mutual fund research firm. Once taxes and sales commissions
are figured in, a mutual fund's relative performance can look
dramatically better -- or drastically worse.</p>
<p>Take Neuberger & Berman Manhattan Fund. In mutual fund
surveys, the fund's performance looks good but not great. For
the 1980s, it showed a compound total return of 445%, making
it the decade's 43rd-ranked performer among mutual funds. But
after taxes and sales commissions, Manhattan turns out to
have been the decade's 11th best-performing fund.</p>
<p>What was the secret of Manhattan's success? The fund's
edge came partly from the fact that it's a no-load fund,
which means investors can buy shares without paying a sales
commission.</p>
<p>But Manhattan also got an edge during the 1980s from using
capital-loss carry-forwards. When Neuberger & Berman acquired
Manhattan from CNA Financial Corp. in 1979, the fund had a
rotten record -- but it also had $70 million in capital-loss
carry-forwards, the result of numerous losing stock trades
during its years of poor performance. Under Neuberger &
Berman, these loss carry-forwards were used to offset capital
gains realized by the fund, so that Manhattan didn't have to
make a capital gains distribution to its shareholders until
February 1986.</p>
<p>How much was this nifty piece of tax sheltering worth?
Morningstar calculates that a Manhattan Fund shareholder
during the 1980s would have lost less than 17% of his gains
to Uncle Sam. By contrast, taxes and sales charges slashed an
estimated 35% from the average gain for stock fund investors.</p>
<p>Morningstar took a look at the past decade's
top-performing funds to see how they stacked up after taxes
and sales charges. For each fund, Morningstar presumed that
an investor opened an account at the start of 1980 and paid
today's full sales commission, if any.</p>
<p>Each year, mutual funds are legally obliged to pay out
practically all dividends and net realized capital gains, on
which shareholders then pay taxes. Morningstar assumed these
gains were taxed at 28% and that shareholders met their tax
bill each year with money from their mutual fund accounts.
Morningstar then calculated what the value of the account
would have been at the end of the 1980s.</p>
<p>The study also presumed that an investor decided to hang
on to his account at the end of the decade. If an investor
closed down his account instead, he would normally be liable
for further taxes. There are a few things that Morningstar's
figures don't take into account, such as the taxrate changes
over the past decade. But their numbers provide a more
realistic guide to fund performance than the more traditional
fund surveys do.</p>
<p>Manhattan Fund now has used up its capital-loss
carry-forwards; these days, the group of funds with the
largest loss carry-forwards are the beaten-up junk bond
funds. But there are other ways for funds to cut their
shareholders' tax bills -- such as avoiding
high-dividend-yielding stocks and hanging on to winning stock
positions, thereby keeping portfolio turnover low.</p>
<p>The past decade's top three performers -- Fidelity
Investments' Magellan Fund, Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Pacific
Fund and the Japan Fund managed by Scudder, Stevens & Clark
-- are still the top three after their returns are adjusted
for taxes and sales commissions. But some other top-ranking
funds slipped badly. Lindner Dividend, for instance, is
usually ranked as the past decade's ninth best of a total of
324 stock funds. But because the fund picks up hefty amounts
of dividend and interest income from high-yielding stocks and
junk bonds, which are then immediately taxable to its
holders, the fund slips to 24th on an after-tax basis.</p>
<p>Robert Lange, a fund manager at Lindner Management, says
taxes are unavoidable given the fund's objective of providing
shareholders with current income. "We presume that people are
going to reach a point in their lives when they are going to
want income," Mr. Lange says. "When you reach that point, you
can't really avoid taxes."</p>
<p>Many of the top funds on an after-tax basis are those that
pick up capital gains by buying and holding stocks that pay
little or no dividend. That's just what Albert Nicholas does
at Milwaukee's Nicholas Fund, a no-load mutual fund. "We have
a tendency to let our winners run, so we're not taking a lot
of capital gains," says Mr. Nicholas, who also says he
doesn't look for high-dividend-paying stocks: "We're more
growth-oriented. We want companies to reinvest their earnings
and grow more."</p>
<p>Nicholas Fund has had positions for over a decade in
stocks such as Community Psychiatric Centers, Dean Foods Co.
and National Medical Enterprises Inc. Mr. Nicholas's
willingness to ride his winners means the fund had a low
portfolio turnover rate of just 28% a year during the 1980s.</p>
<p>Low portfolio turnover also paid off for shareholders in
SLH Appreciation, which -- despite a 5% sales charge --
jumped from 45th to 12th place when taxes and sales load are
figured in.</p>
<p>"Our largest holdings include things like Walt Disney and
Waste Management, where the yield is nominal," says Harold
Williamson, one of the fund's co-managers. "Current income is
not a focus of the fund. We tend to ride our winners. Many of
them we've held for five years or longer."</p>
<p>But low turnover doesn't necessarily mean a fund is riding
its winners, nor does high turnover mean a fund is quickly
taking its capital gains. Japan Fund had average turnover of
just 31% in the 1980s, yet taxes put a hefty dent in its
total return. Twentieth Century Select, meanwhile, had
above-average turnover of 112% a year, but the fund looks
impressive on a post-tax basis.</p>
<p>Another high-turnover fund, the no-load WPG Tudor Fund,
jumped from 32nd on an unadjusted basis to fifth place in
after-tax results.</p>
<p>"We have a bifurcated holding period," says Melville
Straus, the fund's manager. "We'll have many stocks in there
for two or three years, and some for six months or less. We
try to take our losses early." Among the fund's longer-term
holdings are MCI Communications Corp., Waste Management Inc.,
Chemical Waste Management Inc., Healthsouth Rehabilitation
Corp., Shoney's Inc., Toys 'R' Us Inc. and Novell Inc.</p>
<p>Instead of concentrating on a fund's turnover, says
Morningstar's Mr. Mansueto, investors might do better to
check the footnotes of a fund's annual report and see if the
fund has large unrealized gains. Those represent a potential
tax liability, but they may also mean that a fund tends to
stay with its winners.</p>
<p>Though funds that buy high-dividend-yielding stocks look
relatively poor on an after-tax basis, "I don't know that you
should avoid those funds altogether," Mr. Mansueto says. One
way to avoid the tax liabilities generated by such funds is
to buy them for an individual retirement account.</p>
<p>And what about funds that charge high sales commissions?
These charges can put a big dent in an investor's returns if
he only hangs onto a fund for one or two years. But for truly
long-term investors, Mr. Mansueto points out, taxes can be
much more significant. "Loads tend to get all the attention,"
he says. "Nobody ever looks at taxes."</p>

<p>  After Paying The Piper, It's A Very Different Tune</p>
<p>Most mutual fund surveys ignore taxes and sales charges
when figuring performance results. But if you deduct those
two costs, a fund's result can change radically.</p>
