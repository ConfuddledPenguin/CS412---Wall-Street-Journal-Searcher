	<p class="article-leader">HOVNANIAN ENTERPRISES Inc. (Red Bank, N.J.) -- Standard &
Poor's Corp. said it affirmed its single-B-plus rating on $92
million of subordinated debt of this home builder. The rating
concern said its move reflects Hovnanian's "strong
competitive position . . . impressive earnings track record,
solid capital base, and the expectation that the company will
prudently manage its operations, outperform competitors, and
maintain profitability during the current residential market
downturn in the Northeast."

Standard & Poor's Corp. placed the senior and short-term debt
totaling $1.4 billion of the company's U.S. unit, North
American Philips Corp., under review for a possible
downgrade. The review was prompted by the parent company's
expected $1.07 billion loss for the year, resulting from
special charges for its unprofitable computer and
semiconductor businesses.</p>
