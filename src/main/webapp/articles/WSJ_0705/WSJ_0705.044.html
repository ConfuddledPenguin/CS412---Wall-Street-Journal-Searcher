	<p class="article-leader">Microcom Inc. slashed its previously reported fiscal
fourth-quarter and year-end results and said it also expects
to report sharply higher than anticipated losses for the
first quarter.
   The announcement suggests deepening problems at the
Norwood, Mass., software and data communications equipment
maker. In June, the value of Microcom's stock was reduced by
nearly half in frenzied trading after the company warned
investors it would post a loss in its fiscal first quarter
ended June 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a statement issued after the close of the market
Tuesday, Microcom said it revised its fourth-quarter results
downward to net income of $1 million, or 11 cents a share,
from the previously reported net of $3.2 million, or 32 cents
a share. Revenue for its fourth quarter, which ended March
31, was revised to $18.25 million from $21.8 million.</p>
<p>Microcom also said it expected to report a loss of between
43 cents and 48 cents a share for the first quarter ended
June 30, on sharply lower revenue of $10.5 million. Just last
month, the company had estimated the loss at between 15 cents
and 20 cents a share, on revenue of $14 million. In the
year-ago first quarter, Microcom reported net income of $2.5
million, or 29 cents a share, on revenue of $17 million.</p>
<p>Microcom attributed the unexpected adjustments of the
fourth-quarter results to "overstocking of key North American
distributors" during the period.</p>
<p>James M. Dow, president and chief executive officer, said
first-quarter revenue was substantially below estimates "due
to tightened credit policies with distributors and
resellers." He also said sales reserves were increased and
that purchases of two key product lines, LAN Bridge and
Protocol modems, were delayed. International sales, however,
were in line with estimates, he said.</p>
<p>Michel Guite, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc., called
the problems in the first quarter a "serious distribution and
packaging blunder" by the company, which caused a large
number of software product returns. He also said sales of
modems had fallen short of expectations. Sales of equipment
such as modems -- which transmit computer data over phone
lines -- have accounted for about two-thirds of revenue, Mr.
Guite said, though they contributed only about 35% of
earnings.</p>
<p>Microcom's stock still hasn't recovered from the pounding
it took last month when the company issued its initial
forecast of a loss for the quarter. The stock, which dropped
$8.50, to $9.75, with more than 1.7 million shares changing
hands on June 11, closed at $8.75, unchanged, in national
over-the-counter trading Tuesday.</p>
<p>For the full year, Microcom said it revised net income to
$9.5 million, or $1 a share, from a previously reported
$11.66 million, or $1.22 a share. Revenue was adjusted
downward to $71 million, from a previously reported $75.1
million. In 1989, Microcom reported net income of $7.6
million, or 92 cents a share, on revenue of $59.3 million.</p>
<p>The revisions to the fourth quarter and full year did not
amount to a formal restatement, because they had not yet been
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
company indicated.</p>
