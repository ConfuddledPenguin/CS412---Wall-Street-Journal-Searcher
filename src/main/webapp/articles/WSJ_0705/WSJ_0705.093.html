   Make Less, but Make Do</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>THE BABY BOOM generation is faring better economically
than many studies suggest.</p>
<p>Considerable research has indicated that the huge size of
the cohort born between 1946 and 1964, plus the recession of
the early Reagan years, have depressed the boomers' earnings
compared with those of earlier groups at similar ages. But, a
new analysis argues, that's just part of the story.</p>
<p>Richard Easterlin and Christine Macdonald of the
University of Southern California and Diane Macunovich of
Williams College agree the earnings picture isn't too good.
Their data show that average real earnings of young men
between the ages of 20 and 40 in 1987 were lower or just
barely above the earnings of men in that age range in 1974.
For example, men 30 to 35 in 1987 had average earnings $2,300
a year less than the comparable age group in 1974.</p>
<p>But the researchers maintain that the boomers made
life-style adjustments giving them a higher economic standard
of living than the earnings figures imply. They continued to
live with parents, cohabited or doubled up with other adults,
stretching their buying power. They postponed marriage and
children until they were older and making more money. Wives
went to work and then kept on working after having kids.</p>
<p>The Easterlin team calculates an "average income per adult
equivalent," a figure that takes into account the number of
adults and children sharing each household's income and
economies of scale; they conclude that this figure was
sharply higher for young people in 1987 than for comparable
age groups in 1974. In 1987, for instance, the average annual
income per adult equivalent for men between 30 and 35 is
figured to be $2,700 higher than it was for those 30 to 35 in
1974.</p>
<p>"For the baby boom generation," the analysis says,
"altered demographic behavior has been the key to
transforming adverse labor market conditions into favorable
living levels."</p>
<p>Parents' Relationships</p>
<p>Shape Sexual Attitudes</p>
<p>PARENTS' MARITAL history influences their children's
attitudes toward sex and marriage, a University of Michigan
professor reports.</p>
<p>Arland Thornton drew on a large sample of white Detroit
families who had children in July 1961, interviewing the
mothers repeatedly between 1962 and 1985 and interviewing the
children when they were 18 and again when they were 23. He
found that children whose mothers had married young generally
had more accepting attitudes toward premarital sex than
children whose mothers married older. They also tended to
enter more quickly into cohabitation or marriage.</p>
<p>Children whose mothers were pregnant before marriage were
substantially more sexually active themselves than children
conceived after marriage.</p>
<p>Parental divorce and remarriage had similar impact. Young
people whose parents divorced during the years they were
growing up were substantially more likely to have extensive
premarital sex and to cohabit before marriage. The
cohabitation rate among children whose childhoods were marked
by family disruption was more than double that for children
from intact families.</p>
<p>"One particularly interesting finding," Mr. Thornton says,
was that children whose mothers divorced and remarried were
far more sexually active than those whose mothers didn't
remarry.</p>
<p>Non-Traditional Homes</p>
<p>Can Hurt Kids' Health</p>
<p>FAMILY STRUCTURE has much to do with children's health and
development, a new survey documents.</p>
<p>With so many more children living in single-parent or
stepparent families, the subject takes on new urgency.
Deborah Dawson of the National Center for Health Statistics
examined a 1988 government survey of the health and emotional
status of some 17,000 children ranging in age from infancy to
17.</p>
<p>After adjusting for the children's age, sex, race, family
income, whether the mother worked outside the home and other
factors, she found that on a series of health tests, children
living in non-traditional families had substantially greater
problems than those living with both natural parents.</p>
<p>For example, the risk of having had an injury or accident
during the year before the survey was 20% to 30% higher for
children living with a mother and stepfather or with a
divorced mother only; peculiarly, children living with a
never-married mother had no higher injury rates. Children in
mother-headed families, whether never-married or previously
married, were 50% more likely to have asthma.</p>
<p>Children living in mother-headed families or with mothers
and stepfathers were anywhere from 40% to 75% more likely to
have had to repeat a grade in school than those living with
both biological parents. Children from disrupted marriages
were over 70% more likely to have been suspended or expelled,
and those living with never-married mothers more than twice
as likely.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>MEN MADE UP 73% of the full-time faculty in U.S. higher
education in 1988 and 56% of the part-time faculty, according
to the Department of Education. Whites accounted for
nine-tenths of all faculty members, while 4% were Asian, 3%
black, 2% Hispanic and 1% American Indian. . . . More
arrestees in the Northeast test positive for multiple drug
use than in any other part of the U.S., National Institute of
Justice researchers report. Compared with males, female
arrestees show as high or higher multiple drug use in every
section of the country.</p>
