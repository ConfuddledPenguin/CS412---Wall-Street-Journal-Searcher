	<p class="article-leader">Tucked off the Pentagon's drab "A" ring are about 100
square feet reserved for nondenominational worship. But on
the prestigious "E" ring about 2,000 square feet are set
aside for devotions to George C. Marshall. In addition to
statuary and portraits, there is a huge reliquary containing
bits of old uniforms and personal items. The altar lacks only
incense and candles.
   Marshall's memory is held sacred above all others not
because of his excellent leadership of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff in World War II, nor for his courage and vision as
secretary of state, nor even for his term as the third
secretary of defense. The hushed reverence of bureaucrats
passing through the "Marshall corridor" honors a different
conquest. In 1947, he inspired the War Department's hostile
takeover of the Navy Department, ending in victory the Army's
longest battle. Though the name of the Pentagon was changed
from War to Defense, it was the admirals who were led across
the river in chains from their vanquished redoubt on
Independence Avenue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ed Cray's "General of the Army George C. Marshall: Soldier
and Statesman" (Norton, $29.95) brings up the full flavor and
bitterness of this and other struggles in Marshall's long
career. The flavor comes in no small measure because Mr. Cray
is even more passionate and partisan than his hero. His lack
of objectivity may diminish the scholarly value of this book,
but certainly not its readability.</p>
<p>To him, Marshall was a combination of Washington, Plato,
Alexander and Francis of Assisi. Those who disagreed with him
are knaves, fools or, like FDR and Churchill, shallow
politicians. But his special contempt is saved for everyone
and anything naval. Secretary James Forrestal was a lunatic;
Adm. Ernest King, a malevolent obstructionist; and Adm.
Chester Nimitz, a simpleton. Even the victory at Midway, seen
by most historians as one of the most decisive in history, is
derided as "a victory by the narrowest of margins and the
greatest of luck."</p>
<p>But for all its excesses, the book is a good review of
Marshall's life and times with lots of new material nicely
written. This book leaves no doubt that here was a great man
of vision and integrity. It also documents the fact that he
was a lifelong Democrat, a consummate political intriguer,
manipulator of the media and shameless promoter of cronies,
though Mr. Cray doesn't always conclude the obvious from his
research. After describing how Marshall connived with his pal
Harry Hopkins (to whom he owed his promotion from brigadier
to Army Chief of Staff) and survived years of army
infighting, it is amusing to read that "the General had never
engaged in partisan politics and had avoided equally savage
Army politics." Har, har, har]</p>
<p>Many of the 850 pages deal with World War II and are
especially good in explaining the deep cleavage on strategy
that divided the allies throughout the war, and indeed that
continues to the present day. From the start, Churchill
pressed what today are called "competitive strategies" -- the
applying of Allied maritime and land strength against enemy
weaknesses using blockade, bombing, maneuver and special
operations, delaying any direct invasion until the enemy was
sufficiently weakened. Strongly in support of this strategy
were Roosevelt, the U.S. Navy and MacArthur. Marshall, on the
other hand, was a firm believer that "war could end
decisively only with huge land armies eventually colliding in
Western Europe." His was the direct attrition strategy of
Army doctrine that went back to Grant. It had none of the
lower risk, lower casualty appeal of a naval and air war. "It
was a concept based on overwhelming force, of crushing
opposition," writes Mr. Cray, approvingly.</p>
<p>The British military leadership never had much admiration
for Marshall as a strategist. "He had old-fashioned ideas of
always wanting to get straight at the enemy regardless of
overall strategic requirements," said Lord Ismay.</p>
<p>After the war Marshall's direct assault approach was the
secret of the enormous success of the Marshall Plan, which
revitalized a rubbled Europe. And in molding the postwar
military, his victory was absolute. He is the father of our
vast overcentralized defense organization, equivalent in
assets to the top 30 Fortune 500 companies combined, and it
is he more than anyone who molded the staff-dominated culture
of our modern armed forces. Since the establishment of the
Defense Department, with its staff of 90,000 military and
civilians, most of the service chiefs and all of the chairmen
of JCS were selected because of accomplishments in staff
duty, not field command. So orthodox has his culture become,
that recent law prohibits an officer in any service from
promotion to flag rank without at least 4 1/2 years of staff
duty. There is no such requirement for field or sea
experience.</p>
<p>Marshall also was able to fix the orthodox military
doctrine of the Pentagon so firmly that it has endured
largely unchanged to the present day. Its principles are:
First, that wars can only be won on land with the sea and air
arms subordinated; and second, that Europe must always be the
foundation of U.S. defense policy -- the rest of the world is
a sideshow.</p>
<p>With the Cold War over, the book is a timely look back at
its beginnings. And for anyone interested in learning how
that fabulous circus of entropy called the Defense Department
was conceived, Mr. Cray's biography is must reading.</p>
