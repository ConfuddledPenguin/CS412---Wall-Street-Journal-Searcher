	<p class="article-leader">Alliant Computer Systems Corp., citing disappointing sales
of large systems and costs of introducing a new computer,
said it expects to report a second-quarter loss of eight to
12 cents a share on revenue of close to $20 million.
   In the year-ago period, the Littleton, Mass.-based company
had net income of $377,000, or three cents a share, on
revenue of $17 million. Alliant said analysts had been
predicting revenue of $23 million to $24 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue was hurt by "longer and more extensive" customer
testing of the company's new FX/2800 supercomputer and by "a
predominance of upgrade business," Alliant said.</p>
<p>Alliant also said that Ronald Gruner, president and chief
executive, was named vice chairman and that Craig J. Mundie,
vice president, research and development, was named president
and chief operating officer. Mr. Gruner will continue as
chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Mundie will be responsible for day-to-day operations
and will report to Mr. Gruner. Richard B. Goldman, recently
appointed chief financial officer, will assume the additional
position of treasurer, formerly held by Mr. Mundie.</p>
