	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Secretary of State James Baker proposed that
24 Western nations establish an aid program to assist Central
America.
   Mr. Baker gave few details of the proposal, which came as
the two dozen countries that have pooled $14 billion in
financial aid for Poland and Hungary agreed to offer similar
help to four other Eastern European countries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though there was no official reaction to Mr. Baker's
proposal, which he said would help "broaden the support for
democracy and development in Central America," several
countries said they would consider the idea. Mr. Baker said
President Bush had received a favorable response to the idea
when he discussed it recently with EC Commission President
Jacques Delors. And Mr. Baker said several European foreign
ministers had indicated they would support the idea.</p>
<p>Regarding Eastern Europe, the ministers of the so-called
Group of 24 agreed that Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, East
Germany and Yugoslavia were making progress toward market
economies and democratic societies and thus should be
included in the joint aid programs.</p>
<p>"The door is now open for direct, coordinated assistance,"
said Frans Andriessen, the EC Commissioner for external
relations who chaired the G-24 meeting.</p>
<p>But the ministers expressed widely divergent views about
creating a separate aid program for the Soviet Union. And
they refused to offer any aid to Romania until that country
does more to create a democratic political system.</p>
<p>The discussions among the G-24 ministers, the second since
they agreed one year ago to coordinate their financial
assistance to Poland and Hungary, were described as a major
step toward creating a more stable and prosperous Eastern
Europe. The meeting came less than a week before the summit
of leaders of the seven major industrial countries in
Houston, where the controversial subject of aid to the Soviet
Union is likely to be brought up again.</p>
<p>The ministers didn't estimate how much additional aid
would be necessary to help the four new members of the G-24
aid program. But in their joint statement, they said it would
require "further financial efforts from the whole Western
Community."</p>
<p>"The amount of money needed to give help to these
countries is enormous," added Mr. Andriessen.</p>
<p>The ministers also asked the EC Commission, which is
administering the aid program for the G-24, to study the
possibility of a large financial "safety-net" fund, that
could be used to help the Eastern countries create
convertible currencies, finance short-term
balance-of-payments shortfalls and meet other emergency
needs.</p>
<p>Mr. Andriessen and several other commissioners had
suggested the fund, which would be similar to the $1 billion
stabilization fund that the G-24 already has put into place
for Poland. The Polish fund is credited with helping that
country put into place radical changes in its economic and
monetary system. Mr. Andriessen said that such a fund for all
of Eastern Europe should amount to 10 billion European
Currency Units ($12.47 billion).</p>
<p>But the ministers were cautious about endorsing the fund
before it was clear whether it would duplicate the efforts of
the International Monetary Fund, which is the principal
organization that tries to help countries with
balance-of-payment problems or other short-term financing
needs.</p>
