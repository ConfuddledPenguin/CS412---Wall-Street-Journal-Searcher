	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The stock market on Tuesday rose for the fifth
consecutive session, as investors loaded up on stocks they
hope will be safe from negative earnings surprises. But
trading was moderate.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 12.37 to 2911.63,
the first close above 2900 since June 21. The current winning
streak in the Dow industrials is the longest since early May.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 130,050,000
shares, compared with 130,200,000 on Monday. Advancing issues
on the Big Board outpaced decliners 834 to 650. The financial
markets were closed yesterday in observance of Independence
Day.</p>
<p>Profit-taking depressed technology issues: Compaq Computer
fell 2 to 123 1/8; Digital Equipment Corp. fell 5/8 to 83
3/4, and International Business Machines slipped 7/8 to 117
5/8.</p>
<p>Traders expect little change in stock prices until the
wave of corporate earnings reports begins next week.</p>
<p>"I would be hard-pressed to call it anything other than a
trading-range market right now," George D. Adler, director of
portfolio management at Banc One Asset Management Corp.,
said. "We are all sitting on our hands waiting for something
to happen."</p>
<p>Still, stocks of companies that maintain earnings growth
throughout the ups and downs of economic cycles were clearly
in favor Tuesday. Tobacco, waste-management and beverage
stocks advanced. For example, American Brands rose 7/8 to 65
5/8, Waste Management gained 1 to 42 7/8, and Anheuser-Busch
added 5/8 to 43 3/4.</p>
<p>Among advancing growth and consumer issues in the Dow
industrial average were Philip Morris, which gained 7/8 to 48
and was the most active Big Board stock, with more than 2.6
million shares changing hands; Merck, which gained 5/8 to 87
5/8; General Electric, which rose 5/8 to 71 1/8, and
Woolworth which jumped 1 to 34 1/8.</p>
<p>Periodic stock-index arbitrage buy programs, in which
traders buy stocks and sell futures to lock in fleeting price
differences, also lifted these shares.</p>
<p>Among declining stocks, Dow Jones slipped 1/2 to a new
52-week low of 22 1/2, continuing a monthlong slide. Since
early June, shares of the information and publishing company,
which publishes this newspaper, have fallen 20%. Several
analysts, including Susan Decker of Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette, have recently lowered their earnings estimates for
Dow Jones. Ms. Decker said she is concerned about a "softer
profit outlook" at Dow Jones's Telerate subsidiary.</p>
<p>General Instrument rose 1/2 to 45 5/8 on volume of more
than 1.9 million shares, an indication that market players
believe another suitor for the company will surface with an
offer higher than Forstmann Little's buy-out bid of $44.50 a
share. Analysts said potential bidders include U.S.
telecommunications companies and foreign concerns such as
Matsushita Electric Industrial and N.V. Philips.</p>
<p>But Kay Jewelers, another takeover target, slipped 1/2 to
13 3/4 as Ratners Group's offer drew a cool reception from
some holders of the company's two "junk" bond issues. The bid
calls for the British concern to pay 75% of face value for
Kay's high-yield bonds.</p>
<p>Mattel, which said it expects to report that
second-quarter sales rose about 16% from a year earlier, rose
3/8 to 22 1/2 on 1.3 million shares. The company didn't
provide an earnings estimate.</p>
<p>TCBY Enterprises dropped 1 5/8 to 17 5/8, after
Robinson-Humphrey downgraded the stock's short-term
investment rating and cut earnings estimates. Separately, a
company spokeswoman acknowledged that a Florida-based
franchisee with about 50 stores had filed for bankruptcy-law
protection, but she said the filing in "no way will impair"
TCBY.</p>
<p>Dividend-related trades by institutions swelled volume in
Central Maine Power, which rose 1/8 to 18 3/4, as 2.3 million
shares were traded, and SCEcorp, which added 1/8 to 37 5/8 on
1.4 million shares. Another utility stock, Entergy, also was
high on the NYSE's list of most active stocks; the issue
gained 1/8 to 20, as two million shares changed hands.</p>
<p>Signet Banking, which said it expects to post "minimal
earnings" for the second quarter after adding to its reserve
for loan losses, regained 5/8 to 19 7/8, after plummeting 3
3/4 on Monday. But selling spread to issues of other
Southeast-based bank holding companies: Sovran Financial
dropped 1 1/4 to 26 3/4, Citizens & Southern slipped 5/8 to
22 3/8, and Southeast Banking fell 3/8 to 9.</p>
<p>Dallas Semiconductor lost 5/8 to 7 1/8, after Shearson
Lehman Hutton, in resuming its coverage of the company,
downgraded the stock's short-term investment rating and
removed it from two listings of recommended growth stocks.
The firm also lowered earnings projections for 1990 and 1991
by four cents a share to 55 cents and 70 cents, respectively.</p>
<p>Genuine Parts slid 1 3/8 to 38 1/8, after Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette cut its rating on the stock to
"unattractive" from "neutral" and lowered earnings estimates.
The firm now expects the company to earn $2.70 a share in
1990 and $2.90 a share in 1991; its earlier forecasts were
$2.85 and $3.20, respectively. Hillenbrand Industries fell 2
1/8 to 42 3/4. The company reported that net income for the
quarter ended June 2 dropped slightly from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.53
to 360.67. Volume totaled about 11,730,000 shares, compared
with about 9,850,000 on Monday. Advancing issues edged
decliners, 295 to 263, and 240 stocks ended unchanged.</p>
<p>Greenman Bros. jumped 1 7/8 to 7 1/8, after agreeing to
sell its Circus World toy-retailing unit to Melville for $90
million to $100 million; the price will be set upon
completion of the sale, which is expected in early August.
Melville added 3/4 to 53 in Big Board trading.</p>
<p>Fruit of the Loom dropped 3/8 to 12. Standard & Poor's
lowered its ratings on debt issues of the company and two
other concerns controlled by the investor William Farley.</p>
<p>P. Leiner Nutritional Products dropped 1 3/8 to 10 1/8.
The company estimated that sales for the June quarter fell to
about $27.2 million from $32.2 million a year earlier, and
said it expects net income to be substantially lower, as
well.</p>
<p>John Fluke Manufacturing, which said orders for the
quarter ended June 29 were below its expectations, slipped 2
1/8 to 19 7/8. Net orders for the period amounted to $53.7
million, the company said.</p>
<p>Sanifill rose 3/4 to 20 3/4, after revising its
first-quarter earnings upward to reflect an acquisition. The
company declined to identify the takeover that led to the
restatement.</p>
