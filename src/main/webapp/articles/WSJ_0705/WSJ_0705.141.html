	<p class="article-leader">General Electric Co. of Britain said pretax profit for the
year ended March 31 increased 9.4% to #872 million ($1.54
billion) from #797 million a year earlier, boosted by strong
overseas sales and by acquisitions and alliances that the
electrical company built up during the fiscal year, but still
below market forecasts.
   GEC, which is unrelated to the U.S. company of the same
name, said profit after taxes and minority interests but
before extraordinary items rose 6.5% to #543 million from
#510 million. The latest period included a #139 million gain,
representing surplus from the sale of fixed-asset investments
to joint ventures, and year-earlier results had a #12 million
special provision. Per-share earnings rose 5.8% to 20.2 pence
from 19.1 pence. Net profit attributable to shareholders,
after taxes and special items, increased 38% to #433 million
from #314 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales jumped 32% to #8.79 billion from #6.66 billion.</p>
<p>GEC is recommending a final dividend of 6.70 pence a
share, making a total payout for the year of 9.25 pence, up
19% from 7.80 pence a year earlier.</p>
