	<p class="article-leader">New Jersey's highest court, ruling in an 11-year-old case,
ordered two Princeton University eating clubs to admit women.
   The decision came in the case of Sally B. Frank, a former
Princeton student who sued the university and three eating
clubs in 1979, claiming their males-only policies
discriminated against women.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ms. Frank, who graduated from Princeton and is now an
associate law professor at New York University Law School,
named the Ivy Club, the Tiger Inn and the University Cottage
Club in her suit. All three are among Princeton's five
"selective eating clubs," meaning they choose their members.
At the time of the suit they were the only three to
discriminate against women. The Cottage Club settled out of
court in 1988 and agreed to admit women.</p>
<p>The suit, the first of its kind to reach a state supreme
court, argued that the clubs are a place of "public
accommodation" and therefore barred by New Jersey's Law
Against Discrimination from excluding members on the basis of
race, religion, handicap or sex.</p>
<p>But the law provides an exception to places that are
purely "private" in character, and attorneys for the Ivy and
the Tiger maintained that the clubs fell within the
exception. All of Princeton's 13 eating clubs are similar to
fraternities: They are legally and financially independent of
the campus, serve as the primary dining halls for students
and provide social and recreational activities.</p>
<p>The Tiger and Ivy are also highly selective in whom they
choose as new members. Forcing them to admit women, their
attorneys argued, would violate the members' right to freedom
of association.</p>
<p>But the New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously held that the
clubs exist solely as part of Princeton, whether or not they
remain legally and financially independent. Since the
university is a place of public accommodation, the court
reasoned, the clubs also fall under the law: "The clubs
gather their membership from Princeton and, in turn, provide
the service of feeding Princeton students. Because of this,
the clubs lack the distinctively private nature that would
exempt them from the Law Against Discrimination," the court
said.</p>
<p>Ms. Frank said she felt vindicated and satisfied by the
decision, though the clubs may still appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Ironically, students at both clubs voted to admit women
earlier this year but must vote in favor again next year for
the decision to become final. The decision on whether to
appeal, however, rests with each club's board of directors.</p>
<p>Attorneys for both clubs said the clubs had the option of
admitting women and still appealing the ruling to test its
constitutionality.</p>

<p>LIABILITY INSURANCE policy may cover subcontractors' work,
court says.</p>
<p>A California state appeals court reversed a lower-court
decision that would have allowed an insurance company to
avoid paying up on a property damage claim because the damage
was allegedly caused by subcontractors. The insurance
company, Maryland Casualty Co., Baltimore, argued that the
policy's coverage excluded the subcontractors' work.</p>
<p>The opinion appears to weaken the ability of California
insurance companies to refuse coverage for certain types of
property damage claims. The court said that "in the absence
of unambiguous policy terms we are not inclined to restrict
the risks for which businesses may obtain insurance."</p>
<p>The case began when a group of condominium owners in
Carlsbad, Calif., filed complaints against the condominium
developers, Roundtree Condominiums, and the project's general
contractor, DMF Construction Inc., San Diego. The complaints
alleged that construction defects and the shifting of soil
were damaging the condominiums and reducing their value.</p>
<p>Maryland Casualty, which had issued comprehensive general
liability policies to Roundtree and DMF, sought a court order
that the terms of the policies didn't require it to defend
the firms or pay claims on their behalf in the suit by the
condominium owners.</p>
<p>Robert Coffin, a lawyer who represented Maryland Casualty,
said, "This decision places the insurers at risk for the cost
in many cases of rebuilding the entire complex . . . which I
think is far beyond what was intended by the insurers when
they wrote these types of policies." He said no decision has
been made on whether to appeal.</p>
<p>Kimberly Lewis of Kolodny & Pressman in San Diego, a
lawyer for the general contractor and the developer, said
that the case was particularly significant because
"construction-defect cases are so rampant in California, and
people are always looking to California as leading the way on
how to interpret insurance."</p>

<p>FINE & AMBROGNE will dissolve, sending eight lawyers to
Eckert Seamans.</p>
<p>Partners of the 52-lawyer Boston firm of Fine & Ambrogne
voted unanimously to dissolve the firm as of July 20. Several
partners in the dissolving firm said its problems stemmed
more from political differences among partners than any
financial woes.</p>
<p>The 200-lawyer Pittsburgh law firm Eckert Seamans Cherin &
Mellott said that eight Fine & Ambrogne lawyers will join the
firm. Kent May, Eckert Seamans's administrative partner, said
the firm, which has taken on about 30 new lawyers this year,
plans to continue expanding its Boston office.</p>
<p>"With the {Boston} economy the way it is, other law firms
seem to be disintegrating in one fashion or another, which we
hope will make available good lawyers who need a home," Mr.
May said.</p>

<p>DONALD TRUMP testifies on behalf of boxing promoter Don
King.</p>
<p>The testimony was provided in federal court in Manhattan
in the promoter's contract dispute with heavyweight boxing
champion James "Buster" Douglas. Messrs. Trump and King have
worked together to stage several fights in an Atlantic City
casino owned by Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>Fending off allegations that Mr. King had dealt
dishonestly with Mr. Douglas and others, Mr. Trump said, "He
is a good man, but a tough man. He tells me the truth."</p>
<p>Mr. Trump's testimony also offered some revealing details
about how boxing deals are made. Mr. Trump said he and Mr.
King negotiated the purse and date of a rematch between Mr.
Douglas and exchamp Mike Tyson during the middle and late
rounds of their title fight last February.</p>
<p>After Mr. Tyson was knocked out, Messrs. Trump and King
shook hands on the deal, Mr. Trump testified.</p>

the largest law firm in Hawaii, is merging with Ball, Hunt,
Hart, Brown & Baerwitz of Long Beach, Calif., and Los
Angeles. The new firm, Carlsmith, Ball, Wichman, Murray,
Case, Mukai & Ichiki, will be based in Honolulu and include
175 attorneys. The firm will specialize in Pacific Rim
business transactions as well as international law.</p>

<p>JORDEN & SCHULTE, a Miami-based law firm, beefed up its
Washington, D.C., presence thorough a merger with the
eight-attorney firm of Burchette & Associates. The new
70-attorney firm is called Jorden Schulte & Burchette. The
merger includes three partners from Burchette & Schulte, a
legal and government-relations firm-William H. Burchette,
Foster De Reitzes and Kenneth Lee. Jorden & Schulte, which
has experienced some recent defections, said the move
reflects a longtime desire to increase its Washington
practice.</p>

<p>DAVID A. BRAUN, former president of Polygram Records, is
leaving the Los Angeles law firm of Silverberg, Katz,
Thompson & Braun to join New York-based Proskauer Rose Goetz
& Mendelsohn as special counsel in Los Angeles. Malcolm A.
Wisemen, another entertainment law specialist at Silverberg,
will also join Proskauer, which has nearly 400 attorneys,
including 40 in Los Angeles. Says Richard Thompson, managing
partner at eight-lawyer Silverberg Katz: "David left under
amicable circumstances. . . . He wanted to be associated with
a bigger firm."</p>
