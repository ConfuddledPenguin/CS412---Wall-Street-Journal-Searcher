   Another Shoe Drops</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">We have no fondness for former dictators or their
self-indulgent widows, but the acquittal of Imelda Marcos is
a reminder that criminalizing political doesn't pay. Whatever
else the jurors may have thought during the three-month trial
of the woman with all the shoes, they easily concluded that
Mrs. Marcos wasn't a racketeer.
   The real mystery is how then-U.S. Attorney Rudolph
Giuliani persuaded the Justice Department that the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law was appropriate for
this case -- just as he managed to RICO other notorious
"gangsters" such as investment bankers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Marcos juror Thomas O'Rourke, a Transit Authority worker,
said Mr. Giuliani was "only trying to make a name for
himself" with this "totally silly case." Those are remarkably
critical words from a juror. So much for a reported State
Department cable that Mr. Giuliani had "guaranteed" a
conviction.</p>
<p>The case became more complex when Ferdinand Marcos died in
September; none of the case's allegations involved Mrs.
Marcos alone. But there were problems with the case as early
as the indictment two years ago after the Marcoses gave up
power and were given refuge in Hawaii. The case claimed to be
about property in the U.S., but it was obvious to everyone
that the prosecution was brought because of what the Marcoses
did in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The charges were based on alleged stealing of some $200
million from the Philippine treasury that the couple then
spent on jewels, art and New York real estate. The defense
that the money was from a gold hoard Mr. Marcos discovered
may not have been easy to credit. Still, after almost 100
prosecution witnesses and thousands of pages of bank records,
even the judge wondered what a case that belonged in a
Philippine court was doing in ours. Judge John Keenan asked
out of the jury's hearing, "What's an American court, what am
I, doing here, trying a case involving the theft of money
from Philippine banks?" The jury apparently agreed.</p>
<p>The collapse of this prosecution is surely a telling
example of prosecutorial hubris. We knew that with RICO an
aggressive prosecutor could indict a ham sandwich, but it now
appears that convictions may no longer be so easy. Coming
after a judge vacated the RICO sentences of Princeton/Newport
securities officials, this acquittal leaves us wondering how
a Michael Milken might have fared with a New York jury if
RICO's power hadn't rubber-hosed him into a settlement. The
embarrassing Marcos acquittal should be another nail in
RICO's coffin.</p>
<p>There is also a serious foreign policy point here. We
worried that this case might deter other tyrants from giving
up power bloodlessly if they saw that they'd still end up
RICO'd into a U.S. jail cell. We doubt that the State
Department will be pressured again by U.S. Attorneys who want
to indict foreign heads of state, at least without clear
evidence of legal wrongdoing in this country.</p>
<p>This prosecution didn't do the Philippines any favors
either. Whatever Mr. Marcos's venal crimes, the real scandal
remains that his reign delayed any mature system of democracy
and free markets. Surely the embattled Corazon Aquino has
enough on her mind without having to worry about more
internal divisions caused by any unintended rehabilitation of
the Marcoses in a U.S. court.</p>
