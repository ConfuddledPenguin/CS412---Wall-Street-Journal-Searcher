	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Falling interest rates will bolster the
sagging U.S. economy, helping to avert a recession for at
least another year, according to a survey of 40 economists by
The Wall Street Journal.
   But economic growth will be painfully slow, most
forecasters warn. Unemployment will increase, and many
struggling industries, such as housing, defense and Wall
Street, are heading for even tougher times.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I don't foresee a nationwide recession, but a lot of
industries and regions of the country already feel like
they're in {a recession} now," says Stuart Hoffman, vice
president at PNC Financial Corp in Pittsburgh. "Just look at
the real estate business in the Northeast. When you can't
sell your home, you feel like your whole world is in a
recession."</p>
<p>Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., agrees there won't be a countrywide
recession. But he says the economy "should continue to
experience rolling recessions, which hit different industries
and regions at different times."</p>
<p>Higher taxes could make this grim outlook even darker,
several forecasters fear. President Bush's abrupt about-face
in deciding to consider new taxes comes as many state and
local governments are raising taxes and reducing budgets.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, most analysts are counting on the Federal
Reserve to race to the rescue, cutting interest rates in the
nick of time to keep the economy afloat. Of the 40 economists
surveyed, 35 predicted that the economy will expand for at
least 12 more months.</p>
<p>"The Federal Reserve will take appropriate steps to
prevent business from getting weaker than it is," says Neal
Soss, a managing director at First Boston Corp. Political
pressure also could help persuade the Fed to cut rates soon,
says James Smith, a professor of finance at the University of
North Carolina. He says Alan Greenspan "knows what he has to
do to get reappointed" as Fed chairman in 1991.</p>
<p>Fed officials probably will cut rates within a few weeks,
says Donald Straszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch &
Co. "The Fed's focus has shifted from reducing inflation to
sustaining economic growth," he says. However, he adds with a
laugh: "We forecast not because we know, but because we are
asked."</p>
<p>The large number of forecasters who say a recession won't
occur makes skeptics even more worried that a slump is
inevitable. They say the economy is even weaker than it looks
and that the Fed won't act quickly enough to stave off a
slump.</p>
<p>"The economy is clearly vulnerable to a recession right
now, and we are increasingly likely to move into one" this
year, says Philip Braverman, senior vice president at DKB
Securities. "The longer the Fed delays its inevitable easing,
the steeper the economic decline."</p>
<p>The gloomiest forecast, as usual, comes from A. Gary
Shilling, a New York economist who heads a consulting firm
bearing his name. He argues that a recession "may already
have started" and says the civilian unemployment rate will
soar to 8.9% next May from 5.3% this past May. He also
predicts that interest rates will plunge as much as two
percentage points, and thus he urges investors to "start to
move into Treasury bonds and other high-quality bonds."</p>
<p>Mr. Shilling's forecast is consistent with his jeremiad of
six months ago, which was by far the least accurate in the
Journal's survey. At that time, Mr. Shilling predicted a
sharp recession in this year's first half, driving the
unemployment rate to 7% by May, or 1.7 percentage points
higher than it was. He also predicted the yield on short-term
Treasury bills would plummet to 5% by midyear -- three
percentage points lower than they actually are.</p>
<p>Mr. Shilling now has predicted four of the past zero
recessions.</p>
<p>He says, "All I can say is we may be in a recession now,
but it obviously hasn't unfolded as rapidly as we thought it
would." He also says U.S. interest rates are being held up by
high rates in Europe and Japan and that the Federal Reserve
"has been extremely reluctant" to ease credit despite the
economy's softness and Bush administration pressure.</p>
<p>While most economists six months ago were correct in
forecasting continued economic growth, most also were way off
the mark with their interest-rate forecasts. The average
forecast six months ago called for long-term Treasury bond
yields to drop to 7.62% by the end of last month. Instead,
yields rose to 8.40%.</p>
<p>This time around, the Journal distributed its survey to
several non-economists, some of whom did much better than
most professional forecasters. By far the best interest-rate
forecasts came from Raul Gonzalez, a 31-year-old doorman at a
Manhattan apartment building. Mr. Gonzalez predicted the
yield on 30-year Treasury bonds would rise to 8 1/2% -- only
1/10 of a percentage point off the mark. "You want any hints,
now you know who to come to," he told a reporter.</p>
<p>None of the 40 economists surveyed last December expected
inflation to surge as much as it did. J. Dewey Daane, a
former Fed official now a finance professor at Vanderbilt
University's Owen Graduate School of Management, came the
closest.</p>
<p>But Susan Seidel, director of the William Beadleston Inc.
art gallery, was even more accurate. Six months ago, she
wrote to this reporter: "According to economists, there
shouldn't be inflation when times are bad (using, for
example, the Depression), but it still seems to me that
things are costing more and more." Inflation "has got to go
up," she predicted. "Taxicabs are going up, restaurants are
going up, and mass transit is going up. That's my perception
of inflation."</p>
<p>To be fair, economists who failed have plenty of company,
even among professional investment managers. For example, a
weekly survey of 46 fixed-income managers in late December by
C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell found 68% bullish on bonds.
Only 10% were bearish. Shortly thereafter, interest rates
began to surge and bond prices tumbled.</p>
<p>Most forecasters have "terrible" track records on interest
rates, says Walter Wriston, Citicorp's former chairman. "We
lost our teeth trying to guess rates" at the bank, he
recalls. The moral: "You have to treat these forecasts with a
large saltshaker."</p>
<p>This point is underscored by a study by Ryan Labs Inc., a
bond analysis firm in New York. Ronald J. Ryan, president,
looked back at average forecasts in surveys by this newspaper
since mid-1982. Only on rare occasions has the group average
been correct even on the general direction of interest rates.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of forecasts from The Wall Street
Journal's latest survey:</p>
<p>-- Anemic Growth. The economy will expand at only a 1.6%
annual rate, adjusted for inflation, in this year's second
half. That would be about the same as in the first half.
(First-half results won't be available from the government
until later in the month, but they are expected to show a
growth rate of about 1.5% to 2%.) Growth will pick up very
slightly in next year's first half, to a 1.8% pace.</p>
<p>-- Lower Interest Rates. Treasury bills, now about 8%,
will yield 7.56% at year's end and 7.43% in mid-1991.
Government bonds, now about 8.40%, will yield 8.16% at year's
end and 8.09% by the middle of next year.</p>
<p>-- Lower Inflation. The consumer price index will rise 4%
over the next 12 months, compared with an estimated annual
rate of around 5.5% in this year's first half.</p>
<p>-- Sturdy Dollar. The dollar, which now buys about 150
Japanese yen, will be worth about the same in six months and
12 months: 150 yen at the end of this year and 149 yen by
mid-1991.</p>
<p>-- Higher Unemployment. The civilian unemployment rate,
which stood at 5.3% in May, will rise to 5.6% in November and
5.7% by next May. June's unemployment report will be released
tomorrow.</p>
<p>WINNERS AND LOSERS: Saul Hymans of the University of
Michigan came up with the best bond forecast. He predicted
30-year Treasury bonds would yield 8.40% by midyear, which
was exactly correct. Tied for second place were David Berson
of the Federal National Mortgage Association and Paul Boltz
of T. Rowe Price, followed by Arnold Moskowitz of County
NatWest and Richard Hoey of Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Gary
Shilling came in last.</p>
<p>The best short-term interest-rate forecasts came from
Messrs. Berson and Boltz. Mr. Shilling again ranked at the
bottom.</p>
<p>Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. was among the first
to admit the error of his forecasts. In early February,
referring to several of his first-quarter average interest
rate forecasts, he wrote: "No doubt we've sent out worse
forecasts in our time (sad to admit) but not many. (And with
our having said it, there's no real need for you, the
recipients, to do the same, is there?)"</p>
<p>Mr. Smith of the University of North Carolina was best on
the dollar, followed closely by Ed Hyman of C.J. Lawrence,
Alan Lerner of Bankers Trust, Mickey Levy of First Fidelity
Bancorp. and Edward Yardeni of Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. Mr. Daane, the former Fed official now at Vanderbilt,
finished last -- even though, curiously enough, his inflation
forecast was the best.</p>
<p>Although final economic-growth figures aren't yet
available, it appears that more than a dozen forecasters came
close to being correct. The worst predictions came from
Messrs. Shilling, Hoey and Hoffman, as well as Irwin Kellner
of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Corp. It also appears that
Messrs. Kellner and Shilling were farthest from the mark with
their inflation forecasts.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoey, who formerly worked for Drexel Burnham Lambert,
nominates himself as "most improved." However, he has mixed
feelings about his forecasts. "The good news is that our
forecast of financial illiquidity in 1990 was right," he
says. "The bad news is that we lost a few bucks on Drexel
stock as a result. On balance, I wish I had been wrong."</p>
<p>Once again, the survey shows that interest-rate
forecasting is much tougher than forecasting the economy. "I
think it's pretty obvious that if anyone really did know how
to forecast interest rates, they would have long ago retired
to fame and fortune," Mr. Shilling says.</p>
