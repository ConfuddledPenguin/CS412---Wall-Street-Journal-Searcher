	<p class="article-leader">After scouting the great South Florida swamp in 1905, Gov.
Napolean Bonaparte Broward proposed a plan of conquest. By
building a system of canals to drain four feet of water from
flood-prone Lake Okeechobee, Florida could gain as much new
farmland as all the land then under cultivation in the state.
   And with the drainage extended south to the Everglades, he
told the state Legislature, "ultimately about six million
acres of the finest land in the country would be rendered
cultivable -- an area capable of producing the entire tonnage
of cane sugar produced in this country."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And so the muck was won. For 50 years, state and federal
engineers diked and dug along Florida's southeast coast, from
Palm Beach County in the north to Dade County in the south.
They spent $30 million building 1,400 miles of canals, 2,000
floodgates and 19 pumping stations. The results were
extraordinary: A vast expanse of teeming raw nature became
dry land for crops, providing irrigation and drinking water
for millions of new inhabitants.</p>
<p>Now, however, nature may be biting back. The Florida
peninsula, in spite of some recent rains, is suffering
through the second year of its worst drought in decades. This
comes on the heels of a nearly 30-year spell during which
South Florida's rainfall has averaged 10% below normal. And
now the huge flood-control project that made possible the
region's boom is at the center of a scientific controversy:
Have the man-made changes in terrain affected the very
climate of South Florida?</p>
<p>At first glance, the notion seems silly. Florida has water
on three sides, so how could draining part of its surface
make a difference? And anyway, climates aren't the sort of
thing especially amenable to human influence, to say the
least. Many Floridians dismiss the proposal out of hand.</p>
<p>What's significant, however, is the number and stature of
those who don't. A vanguard of experts, some buttressed by
exhaustive studies, suggest that draining South Florida's
wetlands has made the region permanently drier.</p>
<p>There are two basic sources of rainfall, here as
elsewhere: large disturbances, or fronts, that crisscross the
globe (and show up on TV-news satellite photos); and local,
so-called meso-scale thunderstorms, which build on hot days
and come crashing down in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>Local storms normally account for much of South Florida's
rainfall. The current drought involves declines of both kinds
of storms. But in the 10%-below-normal rainfall noted since
1960, the deficit has been mostly in the local, meso-scale
variety.</p>
<p>Most of the water in those local clouds comes from the
Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico via sea breezes. But, some
scientists contend, the sea breezes are more likely to turn
into rainstorms if they get saturated, at low altitude, by
water evaporating from below. If the land below is dry, less
water vapor rises to meet the breezes than if the land is
marshy.</p>
<p>Dry land also is hotter, as is the air above it. Over dry
land, these scientists say, clouds habitually form higher in
the sky, become less saturated -- and yield scantier
rainfall. "When you dry out a landscape, the lower
{atmospheric} layers don't have enough water vapor to form
clouds," contends H.T. Odum, a University of Florida
climatologist and an early researcher of this so-called rain
machine theory. "If the ground is dry, clouds form higher,
and it doesn't rain."</p>
<p>There are probably as many weather and climate experts who
dismiss this theory as embrace it. "It is certainly appealing
to say that draining the wetlands has had an effect" on
rainfall, say Wayne C. Huber, a University of Florida
hydrologist. "Scientifically, I don't think it holds up."</p>
<p>It is an issue of considerable importance. If South
Florida is getting permanently drier, the impact on the
region could be staggering. Already, salt water has begun
contaminating wells along both populous coasts, forcing
conservation measures in some areas and expenditures for
desalinization equipment. In April, a moratorium on new
water-use permits was imposed in 1,400 square miles east of
Tampa Bay and extending south to Sarasota. "We expect to see
water-quality deterioration all along the {west} coast" from
salt-water intrusion, says David Moore, of the Southwest
Florida Water Management District. The underground reservoir,
he says, "is being de-watered, and it isn't being recharged
by rainfall."</p>
<p>Drainage, by removing the moderating effect of wetlands on
air temperatures, has also brought more winter frosts to the
area, scientists say, devastating huge citrus groves. As for
wildlife, "the Everglades National Park is in jeopardy of
becoming a biological desert," says Robert Chandler,
superintendent of the park, whose withered marshes were
ravaged by wildfires this spring. The park is home to 12
endangered animal species.</p>
<p>Scientists debated the rain-machine theory about a decade
ago, during South Florida's last major drought. After weather
returned to near normal in the mid-1980s, the debate faded.
But research continued, with some disquieting results.</p>
<p>In 1985, Colorado State University scientists Jeffery
McQueen and Roger Pielke devised an elaborate computer model
showing that thunderstorms form much more slowly over those
parts of South Florida containing dry land than over those
with wetlands.</p>
<p>The following year, one alternative to the rain-machine
theory took a hit. That alternative holds that the long-term
rainfall decline is due to a drop in the number of tropical
storms and hurricanes passing over the area. But a 1986 study
found that the largest rainfall deficits had come in July, a
month that never has many hurricanes and tropical storms
anyway. The study's author was Cecil Palmer,
environmental-services coordinator for Polk County, east of
Tampa.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unsettling report was a study of what has
happened in a much larger area of wetlands drainage: the
Amazon. Computer simulations based on extensive historical
data suggest the Amazon's rainfall can be expected to decline
radically as drainage and deforestation proceed; then, as
rainfall dwindles, reforestation becomes nearly impossible.
The report, in the March issue of Science, is by researchers
at the University of Maryland's Center for
Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Interactions.</p>
<p>Its lead author, J. Shukla, says the lessons would apply
to South Florida as well. "There's no doubt that meso-scale
climate is influenced by land changes," he says.</p>
<p>The drought has renewed concern in Florida that something
big and irreversible is going on, and a growing chorus of
finger-pointing politicians, developers, farmers and
environmentalists is circling the state's water regulators in
a perverse sort of rain dance. Urbanites say farmers irrigate
too much. Farmers say the cities are growing too fast. Animal
advocates call both cities and farms enemies of Florida's
vanishing wildlife. And rain-machine scientists say the state
refuses to confront the real culprit: swamp drainage.</p>
<p>"One of the most important needs now," says Everglades
superintendent Chandler, a rain-machine proponent, "is for a
thorough understanding of how the total Florida water system
really works."</p>
<p>It used to be much easier to understand. Before the
drainage network was built, Lake Okeechobee would spill
southward in an annual flood that slowly flowed in a wide
"river of grass" into Florida Bay 100 miles away. The vast,
shallow marsh formed a rich wildlife habitat and prime
conditions for the evaporation/cloud-formation/rainfall
cycle. A century ago, more than 90% of South Florida was
swamp, compared with about half today.</p>
<p>But now, the arbiter of water flow isn't the land's
natural contours but the South Florida Water Management
District. Its mandate, to protect urban and farm areas from
flooding, dates from a time when water and rain were seen as
threats to Florida civilization.</p>
<p>Wildlife is low on today's priority list of water users.
"When I first came to South Florida, there used to be
literally millions of birds roosting in the trees and
marshes," says Gerald Parker, who, working for the U.S.
Geological Survey in the 1940s, first mapped Florida's water.
"Now, if you see a hundred birds while driving across the
state, it's a good day."</p>
<p>In the two wildlife preserves carved from South Florida's
alluvial past, the Everglades National Park and Loxahatchee
National Wildlife Refuge near West Palm Beach, the marshes
are nearly dry. What little water would normally wash through
during drought is routed to farms for irrigation and into
canals to bolster the coastal water table against saltwater.</p>
<p>The tradeoffs are stark. The number of alligators in the
Loxahatchee has fallen 40% in just two years; in the
Everglades it has plunged by more than two-thirds. In both
places, gators that survive -- generally larger, older ones
that have eaten many of the smaller offspring during the
drought -- are beginning their summer nesting season, and
rainfall is essential for their reproduction. The few wading
birds still to be seen in the dry saw grass are a vestigial
reminder of the giant flocks that once carpeted Floria's wet
green plains.</p>
<p>The possibility that draining those plains has permanently
cut the fresh-water supply threatens the soul of this go-go
state: growth. The implications for development of all sorts
are so grave that state officials have shunned the issue,
contend scientists who have worked within state government
and at universities. Environmentalists, federal wildlife
managers and even county government officials claim that they
have tried for years to get the water districts and other
state agencies to finance research on rain patterns, but the
topic has been ignored, they say, and even suppressed.</p>
<p>In the past three years, Mr. Palmer, the Polk County
official who did the rainfall studies, has urged the state's
legislature to initiate climatic research, but to no avail.
"Our universities are doing polar meteorology, tropical
meteorology, mountain meteorology -- most everything except
Florida meteorology," he says.</p>
<p>Robert Livingston, a biologist who heads Florida State's
Center for Aquatic Research and Resource Management, claims
he was blackballed by state financing sources for focusing
his research on ecological issues. Until two years ago, he
says, the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation had
provided him with $100,000 to $300,000 a year for his work,
but the grants dried up after he released a critical report
on lakeside development. A spokesman for the department
denies Mr. Livingston was blackballed. "He's just one of many
people that we draw on as a research source," the spokesman
says.</p>
<p>Within the South Florida Water Management District,
several scientists want more research, but management, which
serves a board appointed by a conservative governor and
dominated by agricultural and real-estate interests, ranks
"climate change planning" last on a list of 31 priorities.
The reason, says deputy executive director Thomas MacVicar,
is that "nobody has convinced us that, number one, it's a
real phenomenon, and number two, that we have any control
over it, assuming we could find the relationships."</p>
<p>In Polk County, a key runoff area whose rainfall helps
supply the entire region, lake levels are down by as much as
30 feet. Housing built on the shores of Star Lake now lies
hundreds of feet from the water. Piers are high and dry.</p>
<p>Water district officials say Polk County's water table has
been drawn down through heavy ground water pumping by citrus
growers, but the citrus growers blame the cities. "If we were
really serious about planning, we'd stop urban development
until we had something in place to correct the water
shortage," says James Griffiths, a farm lobbyist who has his
own explanation, with maps and drawings, of how urban wells
near the coast have lowered inland lakes. "I don't see any
evidence that we're thinking about the bigger picture," he
says.</p>
<p>Agribusiness is also on the defensive in the Everglades
Agricultural Area just south of Lake Okeechobee, the plain of
muck and saw grass that inspired Gov. Broward's visions. It
is now one of the most productive cane-growing areas in the
world -- and the heaviest consumer of South Florida water.
But rain-machine scientists say diverting the "river of
grass" down canals to the coast not only dried out the
landscape but also caused the organic muck to oxidize and
condense in the sun, creating a permanent dip in the
three-inch-per-mile slope that once fell nearly perfectly all
the way to Florida Bay.</p>
<p>The soil loss probably means agriculture is doomed in the
area within the next 20 years, most experts agree. Land in
the southern stretches is already being retired from farming.
But the river of grass will never return. If Lake Okeechobee
were allowed to flood its banks again, the soil subsidence
would cause the water to form a giant puddle to the south and
flow no further.</p>
<p>"They'll probably try to restore the saw grass, the
waterlilies, the turtles, the alligators, the gar fish some
day," says Mr. Parker, the scientist who first mapped
Florida's water flows. "But the Everglades will never be
restored as long as there's the general feeling here in
Florida that water is the enemy of the people."</p>
