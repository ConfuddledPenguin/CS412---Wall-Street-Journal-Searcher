	<p class="article-leader">West Germany's Siemens AG said it will own 78% of the
surviving company following the planned merger of its Data &
Information Systems division with Nixdorf Computer AG.
   In April, Siemens acquired 51% of the voting shares of the
financially troubled West German computer group and plans to
merge it with the Data & Information Systems division.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The merger is scheduled to take effect Oct. 1.</p>
<p>The resulting company, Siemens-Nixdorf Informationssysteme
AG, would have world-wide sales of around 12 billion marks
($7.26 billion), making it one of Europe's largest
information technology groups.</p>
<p>Under terms of the merger, Siemens will swap the Data &
Information Systems unit for 26.3 million newly issued
Nixdorf voting shares carrying a total nominal value of 1.32
billion marks. Siemens already owns 11.2 million Nixdorf
voting shares.</p>
<p>Siemens added that two independent auditors valued Nixdorf
at 3.02 billion marks, while the Siemens division was
estimated to be worth 7.1 billion marks.</p>
