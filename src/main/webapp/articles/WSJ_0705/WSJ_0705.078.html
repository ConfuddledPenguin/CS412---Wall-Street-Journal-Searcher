	<p class="article-leader">Price Stern Sloan Inc. said it has abandoned the idea of
selling the company, and will instead consider asset sales or
other steps to reduce debt.
   In November, the Los Angeles-based publishing company
retained Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Inc. to help
evaluate restructuring or merger alternatives. A company
spokesman said no decision has been made as to which assets
might be sold.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>L. Lawrence Sloan, chairman and chief executive officer,
said the company is working to control costs and improve
gross profit margins despite a slow retail environment. Even
so, the company won't report a profit for the first half,
usually a weak period.</p>
<p>Price Stern Sloan reported a loss of $11.7 million, or
$3.10 a share, on sales of $41 million for 1989. The
company's stock closed unchanged at $4.25 in over-the-counter
trading.</p>
