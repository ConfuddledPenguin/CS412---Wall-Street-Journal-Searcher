	<p class="article-leader">Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, N.Y., said it plans to
introduce a recyclable 35mm camera, the Fun Saver 35.
   The photographic, pharmaceutical and chemical concern said
the camera, with a built-in electronic flash, will be priced
at less than $16 and available to consumers by mid-October.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Designed for indoor and outdoor use, each camera will be
sold loaded with a 24-exposure roll of Kodacolor Gold 400
print film, Kodak said. Upon completing all 24 exposures, a
user may return the entire camera to a photofinisher, who
will process the film and return the camera for recycling.</p>
