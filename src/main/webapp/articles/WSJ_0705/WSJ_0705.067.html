	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge in Phoenix, Ariz., declared a mistrial
Monday after eight jurors failed to reach a verdict in a $989
million suit brought by Washington Public Power Supply System
against General Electric Co.
   The suit, filed in 1985, charged General Electric with
fraud and breach of contract in the design of the containment
vessel at WPPSS's No. 2 plant near Richland, Wash. The
containment vessel is the thick concrete enclosure designed
to prevent the escape of radiation after a nuclear accident.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>WPPSS will probably request a retrial, subject to board
approval later this month. "We've come this far, I expect
we'll pursue it," said a spokesman for WPPSS, a
quasi-government agency that supplies electricity in the
state of Washington.</p>
<p>"We were pleased the jury didn't accept the allegations,"
said a spokesman for General Electric, Fairfield, Conn. "If
they want to pursue another trial, we think the outcome would
be favorable to us." General Electric has denied all of
WPPSS's allegations.</p>
<p>Other utilities with nuclear reactors and containment
vessels designed by General Electric have apparently been
watching the WPPSS case. Pennsylvania Power & Light Co. and
Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co., among other utilities,
sent lawyers to observe the trial, WPPSS said.</p>
<p>It wasn't clear when or if Judge Alan McDonald, who
presided over the trial, would unseal his separate ruling on
the validity of a damage-limitation clause in General
Electric's 1971 contract with WPPSS. The contract capped
General Electric's liability at the face amount of the
contract, or about $110 million. Judge McDonald had sealed
his decision to avoid biasing the jury.</p>
<p>During the 4 1/2-month trial, jurors were presented with
detailed engineering data and analysis about structural loads
on concrete and pipes during a nuclear plant accident. WPPSS
has been trying to recover its costs for redesigning and
reconstructing the containment vessel. WPPSS says the
"rework" caused an 18-month delay in completing the plant,
which began commercial operation in December 1984.</p>
<p>General Electric said that the only lawsuit against the
company that is similar to the WPPSS case is a $600 million
action brought by Long Island Lighting Co., which owns the
Shoreham nuclear plant in Brookhaven, N.Y.</p>
<p>"We feel we have even a stronger case than in the WPPSS
situation," the General Electric spokesman said. The suit is
expected to go to trial this fall in federal district court
in Pathogue, N.Y.</p>
<p>WPPSS's claims in its General Electric suit aren't related
to the 1983 default by the agency on $2.25 billion of bonds
issued for construction of its nuclear units 4 and 5. Those
units were abandoned after being partially built.</p>
