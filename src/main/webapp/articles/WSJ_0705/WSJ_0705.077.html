	<p class="article-leader">FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- General Electric Co. said it signed an
agreement with France's Snecma to share in the development of
its new jumbo-jet engine, the GE-90, and is negotiating with
Italy's Fiat SpA on a similar agreement.
   A spokesman for GE's Aircraft Engines division in
Evandale, Ohio, wouldn't confirm whether the company had
reached a definitive agreement with Fiat.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In January, GE said that it planned to offer the GE-90, a
new and more powerful engine for Boeing Co.'s planned 777 and
other wide-body planes in the mid-1990s. It also said it
would seek to form a partnership with several foreign firms
to share in developing, manufacturing and marketing the
GE-90, which it estimated would cost from $1.2 billion to $2
billion.</p>
<p>Under the terms of its agreement with GE, Snecma will have
a 25% stake in the GE-90 program. The French company also
will provide 40% of the assembly and test work on the GE-90
engine.</p>
<p>People in the industry said Fiat was considering a 10%
stake in the project, but neither Fiat nor GE would provide
additional details.</p>
