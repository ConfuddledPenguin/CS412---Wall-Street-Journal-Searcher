	<p class="article-leader">In suggesting that "Each State Can Limit Re-Election to
Congress" (editorial page, June 19), Stephen Glazier brings
attention to serious constitutional issues. Sadly, however,
he gives entirely too short a shrift to the important
Qualifications Clauses of Article I, Sections 2 and 3.
   Contrary to the impression given by his treatment of these
clauses, it is well-settled, as both James Madison and
Alexander Hamilton noted in the Federalist Papers (Fed. Nos.
52 and 60), and the Supreme Court painstakingly recognized as
recently as 1969 (in Powell v. McCormack), that the clauses
"define and fix" the maximum qualifications for
representatives and senators, and that those qualifications
are "unalterable" by either Congress or the states.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Glazier's limited analysis of some "ballot access" and
"automatic resignation" case law succeeds in casting no doubt
upon the continued vitality of this enduring constitutional
principle.</p>
<p>He cites the Supreme Court case Storer v. Brown, the
district-court case Williams v. Tucker, the Second Circuit
case Signorelli v. Evans and the Ninth Circuit case Joyner v.
Mofford.</p>
<p>But Storer, Williams and Signorelli were all "ballot
access" cases. Denying people access to the ballot for
legitimate procedural reasons simply does not impose an
"additional" qualification for office. After all, if any of
the challengers in those cases had won the offices they
sought through valid write-in campaigns they would have been
seated, and neither Congress nor the states could have done
anything to stop it. See Powell.</p>
<p>Similarly, so-called "automatic resignation" statutes
simply do not impose additional qualifications for office.
Mr. Glazier unwittingly recognized this in his summary of the
Joyner case. He noted that the statute in that case was found
not to impose "an additional qualification because the
(challenger) was not barred from running for Congress"
(emphasis added). Yes, that's the point.
Automatic-resignation statutes require only that the
candidate resign some other office before running for
Congress. These statutes do not disqualify candidates from
holding congressional office. To the contrary, they were
carefully drafted precisely so as to respect the important
protections inherent in the Qualifications Clauses.</p>
<p>By contrast, a term limitation on congressional offices
would, in Mr. Glazier's own words, directly "bar (affected
incumbents) from running for Congress." This restriction,
like the many that state courts have recognized (see, e.g.,
Hellmann v. Collier, 1958, holding that the Qualifications
Clause required states to permit candidates to run in any
election district across the state), would disqualify certain
people from holding office not because they were under 25 or
30 years of age, not because they were not inhabitants of the
state, not because they had not been citizens of the U.S. for
seven or nine years, but simply, and additionally, because
they had held those very same offices for the preceding 12
years. This is simply not in the Constitution. And it's going
to take some judicial activism of an entirely new and more
wicked sort to find it there.</p>

<p>Mr. Glazier fails to take account of the states'
individual interests in being represented by long-term
incumbents in Congress. Every state would wish the terms of
the congressional legislators representing the other states
to be limited, and might even be willing to have the terms of
its own legislators be limited if the other states' terms
were limited as well. But no state is going to limit the
terms of its federal legislators-and thus their power to
represent state interests on the federal level-unilaterally.</p>
<p>Jurisprudentially and politically, Mr. Glazier's
suggestion just will not wash.</p>
<p>Richard D. Shore</p>
<p>Washington</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Mr. Glazier's premise that we who believe in limiting
congressional terms need to promote state legislative action
as a solution has merit. It would seem simpler than a
constitutional amendment. There is, however, at least one
major problem with looking to our state legislators for
relief: They are just as insulated as our national
representatives.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most powerful person in Ohio politics is a
long-term legislator from a rural section of the state. He
decides who gets what committee assignments. He decides what
legislation gets through. If he is unhappy with whomever my
district sends to Columbus, that person might as well stay
home.</p>
<p>If this power-legislator and his friends vote to limit
congressional terms, might they not be putting themselves at
risk? Wouldn't we voters be correct in next asking our state
legislators to limit their own terms? Can we reasonably
expect them to be any more altruistic than the members of
Congress?</p>
<p>There is a solution. If there is going to be any
term-limitation fruit to pick, it will be solely the produce
of grass-roots activity. We voters will need to strive to get
such legislation on our state ballots, allowing the decision
to be made in the voting booth and not the back rooms of our
state capitals or Washington.</p>
