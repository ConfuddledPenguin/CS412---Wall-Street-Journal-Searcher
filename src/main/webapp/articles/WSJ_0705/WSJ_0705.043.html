	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- A Canadian environmental panel recommended that
the federal government reject plans by Gulf Canada Resources
Ltd. to drill in the western Arctic Ocean, citing the
potentially devastating effects of a spill.
   The recommendation, if accepted by the federal government,
would result in a suspension of operations in Canada's
Beaufort Sea region, which leads into the Arctic Ocean. Gulf
Canada, a unit of Toronto-based Olympia & York Developments
Ltd., which is controlled by the Reichmann family, is the
only company that planned to drill there this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Environmental Impact Review Board said Gulf Canada, an
energy concern, and federal regulators had demonstrated
"complacency" toward environmental protection and wildlife
preservation. The regulators, the Canada Oil and Gas Lands
Administration, will rule on Gulf Canada's drilling plans.</p>
<p>Gulf Canada had proposed to drill four wells in the
Beaufort Sea in the next three years.</p>
<p>The environmental board, made up of representatives from
the federal government, the governments of the Yukon and
Northwest Territories, and Western Arctic Inuit natives, said
Gulf Canada hadn't been able to estimate the effects of an
oil spill on the area's coastline or to give details of how
the company would carry out cleanup operations in the event
of a spill. It said Gulf Canada didn't provide adequate
evidence at a public hearing last month to enable the board
to estimate the cost of cleaning up a hypothetical worst-case
oil spill.</p>
<p>Gulf Canada officials estimated that a worst-case well
blowout could release 40,000 barrels of oil a day for 66
days, or 10 times more oil than that released when Exxon
Corp.'s Valdez tanker ran aground in Alaska last year. The
board said such a spill could have "devastating impacts on
sensitive shorelines and on wildlife that could last for
decades."</p>
<p>Frank Mitton, manager of Gulf Canada's northern
operations, said the board's comments were even "harsher than
anticipated." Gulf Canada has "all the plans and precautions
to make sure we don't have an environmental disaster," he
said.</p>
<p>The review board said it blamed the lack of preparedness
for dealing with oil spills on "a complacency" on the part of
Gulf Canada and the government, which is "driven by an
ultimate belief that a blowout is so unlikely to occur that
preparing to meet it is largely an academic exercise."</p>
<p>It added: "This is the kind of complacency that has been
blamed for the confused response to the Exxon Valdez oil
spill."</p>
<p>Maurice Taschereau, administrator of the Canada Oil and
Gas Lands Administration, said he was "shaken and puzzled" by
the board's criticism. He said the agency has "lots of
contingency plans" in place to deal with environmental
disasters. Mr. Taschereau declined to indicate how his agency
will respond to the board's recommendations. It has 30 days
to reach a decision.</p>
<p>Stephen Hazell, executive director of the Canadian Arctic
Resources Committee, an environmental group, said the federal
regulator can't reject the board's advice without calling
into question the government's own environmental review
process.</p>
<p>No wells are being drilled in the Beaufort Sea now. Amoco
Canada Petroleum Co., a unit of Chicago-based Amoco Corp.,
recently canceled its plans to drill two wells in the
Beaufort Sea, because of insufficient interest from its
partners to proceed with the project. An Amoco spokesman said
the company now intends to carry out some seismic work this
summer.</p>
