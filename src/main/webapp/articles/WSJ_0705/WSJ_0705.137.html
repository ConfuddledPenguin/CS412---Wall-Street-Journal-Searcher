	<div class="article-body"><p>DANIEL LIEBERMAN MAKES HIS LIVING selling bagels and
cheese in Mount Kisco, N.Y. But he lives his life devoting 30
hours or so every week to fulfilling the wishes of children
near death.</p>
<p>Operating from the small office at the back of his
"Danny's Cheese Shop," the 39-year-old Mr. Lieberman presides
over the Hudson Valley chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
He also serves as one of 21 volunteer board members of the
national group, a nonprofit organization with 7,300
volunteers that has made wishes come true for more than
10,000 children since its founding in 1980 in Phoenix.</p>
<p>Mr. Lieberman came to Make-A-Wish five years ago after
hearing about the group from a friend. The description of the
joy brought to seriously ill children, often near death, by
the grant of a single wish touched a nerve with the
bagel-shop proprietor. His own daughter, Rachel, had barely
survived major surgery at the age of five months, and the
45-day hospital vigil following her operation gave Mr.
Lieberman new appreciation for the life of a child.</p>
<p>His chapter's first wish award went in January 1986 to
Joey, a 12-year-old suffering from leukemia, whose wish was
to visit his grandparents in Czechoslovakia. An airline
donated two tickets to Prague, and Mr. Lieberman's chapter
contributed $4,500 for two more tickets plus expenses for
Joey and three family members. Joey, seen smiling in a
picture on Mr. Lieberman's office wall, is 17 this year, his
leukemia in remission.</p>
<p>Since then, the Hudson Valley group has worked to grant
the wishes of 350 children. Their stories don't always have a
happy ending, and there seems to be more of them every year.
It's a challenge for Mr. Lieberman and the 200 other
volunteers in his chapter. Two of the six phone lines in his
store are dedicated to "wish work"; he's even got a facsimile
machine, donated by a retired advertising executive, to keep
the wishes coming.</p>
<p>It isn't hard for a child to qualify. A candidate must be
under age 18 and afflicted with a life-threatening illness;
nominees  come from a network of medical and social workers
and clergy. Financial hardship isn't a criteria. Parents who
could afford an elaborate last birthday party for their
stricken child can't cope with hiring a clown, explains Karla
Blomberg, president of the national group and owner of a real
estate company.</p>
<p>Mr. Lieberman asks candidates, "If Christmas or your
birthday were tomorrow, what would you like?" Or, "If you
could do anything, what would it be?" Candidates can make
another wish if the first one is rejected. An 11-year-old
boy's wish for a  rifle was turned down because of its
potential harm, but he got his second wish, a trip to Disney
World. Also, the wish granted may not always be the wish
sought. The New York Mets, citing Major League Baseball rules
that restrict the dugout to team personnel, turned down a
boy's wish for a seat with the players but gave him four
season tickets instead.</p>
<p>There's some formality: Volunteers have to be certain the
wish is the child's own; and a doctor must certify that the
child's life is threatened by an illness.</p>
<p>Wishes run the gamut. David, 17, exchanged gifts with
President Bush in the Oval Office. Some ask to meet star
athletes or entertainers; others want a doll, a computer or a
shopping spree. There often isn't much time to comply. The
cost isn't high. Excluding donated items such as clothing and
transportation, the average cost of fulfilling a dying
child's dream is about $2,400.</p>
<p>When he isn't granting wishes, Mr. Lieberman is raising
money to fund them. One big event is a June "bagel day" in
which Mr. Lieberman and other volunteers show up at 39
commuter train stations for three hours to hand out bagels
and cream cheese and accept Make-A-Wish donations. This
June's "bagel day" raised about $100,000, compared with
$4,100 in 1985.</p>
