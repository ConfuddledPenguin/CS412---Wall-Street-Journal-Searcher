	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Energy Department estimates that the
cost of cleaning up its nuclear weapons plants and other
facilities could rise to $6 billion a year later this decade
-- about twice as much as current spending levels.
   In a new five-year cleanup projection, the department said
it could cost $31.6 billion from fiscal 1992 through fiscal
1996 to remove, treat and store radioactive and hazardous
waste from nearly 100 department sites around the U.S. The
total costs of cleanup are unknown, although previous
estimates have ranged to more than $100 billion. Work is
expected to continue through at least 2019.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Officials cautioned that the projections represent a
high-cost scenario and are too preliminary to signal how much
the department actually will seek from Congress in the years
ahead. However, the department conceded that the costs of
dealing with severe environmental problems at the
government's nuclear weapons complex and other sites are
projected to mount significantly in fiscal 1992, when the
projection calls for almost double the $2.8 billion requested
by the Bush administration for fiscal 1991. Fiscal 1992
begins Oct. 1, 1991.</p>
<p>The higher costs will have to be borne by the U.S.
taxpayer. "We're going to get it from the taxpayer," said Leo
Duffy, director of DOE's environmental management office.
"There's no other supply."</p>
<p>When the department issued its five-year plan last year,
the estimate was $19.1 billion through fiscal 1995. Mr. Duffy
said the latest projection is significantly higher in large
part because both the government and private contractors who
run many of the DOE facilities fear civil or criminal
liability for violating environmental regulations.</p>
<p>Mr. Duffy said it's doubtful the department would ask
Congress to allot the full amount it has projected. He said
neither the government nor private contractors will have the
manpower or technology available to spend that much money
efficiently for the next four or five years. He also
predicted there will be a shortage of qualified job
applicants to carry out the complex cleanup project in the
years ahead. The report said the DOE and its contractors
would have to more than double the size of their staffs to
handle the mammoth cleanup project.</p>
