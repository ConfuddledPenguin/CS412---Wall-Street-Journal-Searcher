	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks slid in early trading
Tuesday amid several disappointing earnings projections but
recovered later to close only slightly lower.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.28 to 461.76, a 0.06%
loss, after being off 0.86 early in the day. Advancing shares
came out ahead of decliners, 926-901, as volume rose to 131
million shares from 114.2 million Monday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Technology issues were hit particularly hard in the first
hour of trading after Mentor Graphics, Alliant Computer
Systems and Interleaf all cautioned investors about
disappointing quarterly results before the market opened.
Mentor, the day's most active stock, plunged 4 3/8 to 17 5/8
on 5.7 million shares, Alliant tumbled 1 1/16 to 6 7/16, and
Interleaf dropped 1 to 6 3/4.</p>
<p>Also after the first hour, the Nasdaq Industrial Index was
off 1.31 at 497.66 and the Nasdaq 100 Index of larger issues,
which includes many technology stocks, was down 1.82 to
475.02. However, both indexes recovered to finish with much
narrower declines: The Nasdaq Industrials closed at 498.62,
down 0.35, and the Nasdaq 100 index fell 0.85 to end the day
at 475.99.</p>
<p>Investors largely chose not to paint the entire market
with the negative-earnings-surprise brush, said William
Rothe, head of OTC trading at Alex. Brown & Sons Inc.,
Baltimore. "I'm still seeing some people who don't want to be
left out of this market," he said, adding that institutional
investors continued to hunt for bargains across all industry
groups.</p>
<p>At Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York, trading of
technology stocks accounted for much of Tuesday's activity,
according to Robert O'Toole Sr., manager of institutional OTC
trading. The technology issues "were swinging all over the
lot," he said. However, Mr. O'Toole said he was encouraged by
the market's recovery, particularly before yesterday's
Independence Day closing.</p>
<p>"Usually before a holiday they try to flatten them out or
take them down," he said, explaining that many investors
traditionally choose to sell stocks before a holiday in case
unexpected news breaks while the market is closed.</p>
<p>Mentor Graphics tumbled after the Beaverton, Ore., maker
of computer-aided engineering systems said it expects to
report earnings for the second quarter of five to 10 cents a
share, down from 29 cents a share a year earlier. The company
said it expects "similar" results for the third quarter.</p>
<p>Alliant Computer, a Littleton, Mass., maker of computer
systems, said it expects to report a second-quarter loss of
eight to 12 cents a share. A year earlier, it had net income
of three cents a share. Second-quarter revenue is expected to
be about $3 million less than analysts' estimates, Alliant
said, citing difficulties in transition to a new product.</p>
<p>Similarly, Interleaf, a Cambridge, Mass., maker of
computer aids for publishing, said it expects to report a
loss for its first quarter, ended June 30, of about 25 cents
a share. It had net income of one cent a share a year
earlier. Interleaf said it might not break even for six
months.</p>
<p>Piedmont Federal slid 3/4 to 5 3/4 after the Manassas,
Va., financial institution said it expects to report
"substantial" losses for the second quarter and full year,
citing a soft real estate market and increases in
non-performing assets and loan charge-offs. Piedmont Federal
reported net of $1.21 a share for the second quarter of 1989
and $1.26 a share for the full year.</p>
<p>Among other financial stocks, Talman Home Federal Savings
& Loan dropped 2 7/8 to 4 3/4 after the Chicago-based thrift
said an investor group led by Harrison I. Steans terminated a
preliminary agreement to buy it, primarily because of the
company's revised earnings outlook. Talman Home Federal said
it expects to report in about 10 days that second-quarter
profit fell below the first-quarter level of 47 cents a
share, primarily because of a higher cost of funds and
expenses related to the terminated buy-out.</p>
<p>Foremost plunged 4 1/2 to 25 5/8 after the Grand Rapids,
Mich., insurer said it ended a five-month search for a buyer.
The Nasdaq Insurance Index fell 2.81 to 501.47.</p>
<p>Among the day's gainers, New Milford Savings Bank rose 1/2
to 4 after the New Milford, Conn., bank said it dissolved its
subsidiary, Westconn Realty Co., and sold its trust services
subsidiary, Taylor House Investment Management Inc. The bank
said the dissolution of Westconn Realty was one of the final
steps in phasing out its real estate development business.</p>
<p>Investors embraced an initial public offering of Wet Seal,
an Irvine, Calif., retailer of women's apparel. Three million
of the company's Class A common shares were priced at $14.25
each; the stock closed at 17 1/4, unchanged, as more than 3.3
million shares changed hands.</p>
<p>A relatively new issue, K-Swiss Class A shares, rose 2 to
25 after Merrill Lynch analyst Brenda Gall initiated coverage
of the stock with a near-term "above average" opinion and
long-term "buy" opinion, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report. The athletic footwear maker went public June
5 in an offering of 1,450,000 Class A shares priced at $17.50
each.</p>
