	<h3>The Toughest Part of the Journey Is Portaging Down to the Atlantic</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">West Virginia, the Mountain State, may be going to sea.
   Ron Ingram quit his job as an insurance salesman two years
ago with a bold idea to promote his home state. He wants to
fly West Virginia's colors in the BOC Challenge, an
around-the-world sailing race.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But first he must find a boat.</p>
<p>That's not easy in Appalachia. After all, landlocked West
Virginia is to nautical prowess what Jamaica is to
bobsledding. Mr. Ingram, 47 years old, expects to go out of
state to buy the 50-foot sloop he will need for the voyage.</p>
<p>The race, which starts Sept. 15, covers a grueling 27,000
nautical miles over eight months, stopping on five
continents. The boats are sailed solo. But Mr. Ingram, who
grew up ocean sailing with his father and has continued to
sail as an adult, worries more about reaching the starting
line than the finish.</p>
<p>To get there, he needs money. Lots of money. So far, his
group, The Spirit of West Virginia Inc., has raised only
$5,000 of the $350,000 he needs to compete. "That might buy
him a sail," says Peter Dunning of BOC Group PLC, a British
concern that sponsors the race. "We'd love to see him here,
but he's banging his head against a brick wall."</p>
<p>The state's 35,000 PTA members offered to bail him out,
volunteering to raise funds. Pepsi and Seiko also climbed on
board, donating some promotional material, and the West
Virginia Tourism Office waded in.</p>
<p>But Mark Schrader, director of the race, is dubious about
Mr. Ingram's chances: "He's swimming upstream."</p>
<p>Even if Mr. Ingram comes up with the $350,000, he must
first sail the boat on a 4,000-nautical-mile qualifying run.</p>
<p>Thirty boats have entered the race, from nine countries
and nine states. Except for a homemade number from Hungary,
the would-be West Virginia vessel seems to be the only
landlocked entry.</p>
<p>Well, not entirely landlocked. West Virginians can reach
salt water by taking the Kanawha River to the Ohio to the
Mississippi, a mere 60-day jaunt. There's a shortcut through
the Atchfalya Swamp, Mr. Ingram says, "but you wouldn't want
to do that."</p>
<p>Mr. Ingram thinks an appearance on the international
yachting scene could transform West Virginia's image. "About
all we're known for now is West Virginia University's
football team."</p>
<p>Maybe you've heard of them: They're called the
Mountaineers.</p>
