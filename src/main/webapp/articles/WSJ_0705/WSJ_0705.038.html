	<p class="article-leader">Investors pulled $4.3 billion out of money market mutual
funds in the six days ended Monday, apparently seeking better
returns on stocks and bonds.
   The average seven-day compound yield of 430 taxable funds
tracked by IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report was 7.97%,
compared with 7.96% a week ago and within the narrow range of
the past five months. Compound yields assume reinvestment of
dividends. The Holliston, Mass., newsletter did its weekly
survey a day early because of the Independence Day holiday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yields on most certificates of deposit, meanwhile, eased
slightly in the week ended Tuesday, according to Banxquote
Money Markets, a New York information service. The average
yield on a one-year small-denomination CD, for instance,
slipped to 7.83% from 7.85%, according to Banxquote's 18-bank
survey. Average yields on one-year CDs sold by leading
brokerage firms eased to 8.15% from 8.17%.</p>
<p>The drop in money fund assets was the largest in more than
two years, although there was a weekly drop of $4.2 billion
in January. Assets of taxable funds now total $374.6 billion.</p>
<p>Martha Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's, said some of the
cash leaving money funds in the latest period may have gone
into the stock market or short-term Treasury securities.
Three-month and six-month bills sold at Monday's auction
yielded slightly more than the average money fund.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual weekly auction of three-month and
six-month bills, one-year bills and two-year and four-year
Treasury notes were auctioned this past week. One-year
T-bills sold at auction last week yielded 8.09%; four-year
notes yielded 8.5%.</p>
<p>James M. Benham, chairman of Benham Capital Management, a
Mountainview, Calif., investment management firm, said some
money fund investors may be extending maturities a bit. He
noted that investors can buy two-year and four-year notes
with a money fund check.</p>
<p>At mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments, much of the
cash coming out of money funds went into stock and bond
funds, said Michael Hines, a marketing vice president. "It's
not out-the-door money, it's exchange money," he said, adding
that a number of money fund accounts were opened last week.</p>
<p>Although none of the banks in the Banxquote survey offered
a yield as high as 9%, investors can still find consumer CDs
yielding that much or more on maturities of six months or
longer at some banks. Yields on large-denomination CDs,
generally $90,000 and more, at the surveyed banks also were
mostly lower. Average yields on one-year jumbo CDs slid to
7.88% from 7.94%, while five-year maturities fell to 8.20%
from 8.25%.</p>
<p>"There is a general expectation in the market for rates to
continue to fall gradually," said Norberto Mehl, chairman of
Banxquote.</p>
<p>Money fund portfolio managers seem to agree. The average
maturity of the funds' investments -- such things as
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs), Treasury bills
and CDs -- lengthened by a day to 45 days. Longer maturities
typically are thought to indicate that fund managers expect
interest rates to fall because the longer maturities permit
funds to retain relatively higher yields for a longer period.
Average maturity has been as short as 29 days and as long as
53 days in recent years.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
inched up to 7.68% from 7.67%. The average 30-day simple
yield remained at 7.67%, while the average 30-day compound
yield moved to 7.97% from 7.96%.</p>
<p>Assets of 221 tax-free funds fell nearly $300 million to
$75.7 billion, while yields were little changed, Donoghue's
said. The average seven-day compound yield of the tax-exempt
funds was 5.46%, for instance, compared with 5.45% last week.
That's equivalent to 7.58% for someone in the 28% tax bracket
and 8.15% for investors paying 33% in taxes.</p>
<p>Average maturity of the tax-free funds lengthened by five
days to 48 days.</p>
