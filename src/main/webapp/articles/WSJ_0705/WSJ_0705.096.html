	<p class="article-leader">A.T. Massey Coal Co., known for its bitter battles with
the United Mine Workers, named a tough anti-union manager
president and heir apparent of this Appalachian coal
producer.
   Don Blankenship, president of Massey's Coal Services unit,
assumes much of the daily operating chores from E. Morgan
Massey, grandson of the company's founder. Mr. Massey, who is
63 years old, becomes chairman and chief executive officer,
both new posts at the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1984, Mr. Blankenship, now 40, advocated that Massey
fight the UMW rather than sign an industrywide contract. The
result was a 15-month strike.</p>
<p>The dispute was termed a "guerrilla war" after a sniper's
bullet killed a coal truck driver in Pike County, Ky., in
1985. The strike ended in January 1986 when Massey, a unit of
Los Angeles-based Fluor Corp., agreed that all its coal units
would bargain as one employer.</p>
<p>Mr. Blankenship was then in charge of Massey's Rawl Sales
& Processing Co., which was in the middle of the dispute. His
Matewan, W.Va., office is still peppered with bullet holes he
says came from strikers' guns. "I kept the TV with a bullet
hole in it," he says. "The judge liked to use it to show
tapes of the violence."</p>
<p>Mr. Blankenship, the son of a West Virginia coalfields
grocer, still faces a tenuous relationship with the UMW. "I
don't view this move as positive for labor relations," says
Mike Browning, vice president of UMW District 17 in West
Virginia. "They're designing themselves to be a nonunion
company."</p>
<p>Massey and the UMW still have various lawsuits in the
courts and complaints before the National Labor Relations
Board related to wildcat coal strikes staged last summer in
support of striking mineworkers at Pittston Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Blankenship, who spent his college breaks working in
the mines, suggests the labor climate could improve now that
the industry as a group is addressing how to solve some of
its biggest problems, including new funding schemes for its
troubled pension and health funds. Those funds were key
issues in the Pittston strike.</p>
<p>"Anybody that's lived in southern West Virginia can't help
but have respect for what the union achieved," he says. "But
they've not been as pragmatic as they should."</p>
<p>Beyond labor problems, Mr. Blankenship takes over Massey
at a time when Fluor has hired investment bankers to evaluate
what to do with its coal holdings. One option is to sell the
company. Fluor, a construction and engineering firm, has been
divesting itself of its natural resource holdings. "I have no
idea what Fluor might choose to do," Mr. Blankenship says.</p>
<p>An accountant by training, the executive considers the
stricter clean air legislation a plus for low-sulfur coal
producers such as Massey.</p>
<p>Utilities could choose low-sulfur coal as one solution to
tighter requirements curbing sulfur dioxide emissions from
power plants. All of Massey's more than 700 million tons of
coal reserves are considered low-sulfur. "It will give us new
opportunities," he says.</p>
