	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- If it were a soap opera, they'd call it "As
the Cycle Turns."
   The cycle, in this case, is the pricing cycle for property
and casualty insurance. And the drama, such as it is, comes
from trying to predict when the cycle will turn -- when
insurers will stop cutting prices and start raising them.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For investors in insurance brokerage stocks, there is big
money to be made by calling the turns correctly. When
commercial insurance premiums start rising, profits of
insurance brokers rise too. That's because the brokers are
paid a percentage of the premium on each policy they sell.
Stock prices of insurance brokers tend to rise with profits,
but they usually start rising months before, when reports of
price increases begin circulating.</p>
<p>Thus the game for analysts is to call the turn in the
insurance cycle just before it happens.</p>
<p>A few brave souls are saying now is the time to buy
insurance brokerage stocks. First, these analysts believe the
cycle will turn upward in the next few quarters. Second, they
point out that insurance brokerage stocks are trading at the
low end of their historic range, measured by the stocks'
price earnings ratios. And the current P-E ratios are near
that of the rest of the stock market, so there is relatively
little risk that insurance brokerage stocks will drop much,
they add.</p>
<p>"The timing is quite good, because sometime in the next
couple quarters we'll be in the early stages of a sharp
earnings rebound," says Thomas G. Rosencrants, an
Atlanta-based insurance analyst. Insurance brokers' stock
valuations currently "are quite compelling," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosencrants has made an aggressive buy recommendation
for six insurance brokers, ranging from one of the industry's
biggest players, Marsh & McLennan, to one of the smallest
publicly traded brokers, Poe & Associates. The others on his
shopping list are Alexander & Alexander Services, Corroon &
Black, Arthur J. Gallagher, and Hilb, Rogal & Hamilton.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosencrants concedes that there isn't yet any evidence
that insurance companies are raising prices significantly,
though "the numerical evidence is that pricing has bottomed
out." After three years of price cutting, "there are acute
and intensifying financial pressures on the insurance
companies to begin raising prices," he says.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Rosencrants's stance is perhaps the most
aggressive among insurance analysts, he isn't alone in
recommending insurance brokerage stocks. He and others point
out that insurance brokerage stocks offer a way to play the
property-casualty cycle while avoiding some of the risks in
insurance-company stocks -- such as exposure to big claims
liabilities and problems with commercial real estate
investments.</p>
<p>Ira H. Malis of Alex. Brown & Sons, Baltimore, is
recommending only two stocks, Marsh & McLennan and Hilb,
Rogal & Hamilton.</p>
<p>Mr. Malis says of Marsh & McLennan: "It's rare that you
see a company that is the best at everything it does, trading
at a market multiple." Mr. Malis expects Marsh & McLennan to
earn $4.45 a share this year and $5.90 a share next year. At
Tuesday's closing price of 78 on the New York Stock Exchange,
Marsh & McLennan is trading at about 13 times next year's
estimated earnings. "We don't think the {stock} price
reflects the fact that earnings should double over the next
three years," Mr. Malis says.</p>
<p>Hilb, Rogal & Hamilton is a small broker that operates
only in the U.S.; Mr. Malis says it's "trading at the
cheapest multiple of the {insurance broker} group." At
Tuesday's close of 13 3/4 in national over-the-counter
trading, the stock is trading at about 10 times Mr. Malis's
1991 earnings estimate of $1.35 a share.</p>
<p>As for the turn in the cycle, Mr. Malis says: "It's
ridiculous to try to be too specific" about the timing.</p>
<p>Samuel Liss of Salomon Brothers is recommending Marsh &
McLennan and Arthur J. Gallagher. He says there is
"corrective change going on right now" in insurance prices,
and notes that Salomon is expecting the 18 companies in its
property-casualty insurance stock index to post premium
growth of 4% this year and 10% next year, following zero
growth last year.</p>
<p>"There is a reason to have an investment presence in the
group, primarily because, as intermediaries, the insurance
brokers have the ability to quickly capture the benefits of a
pricing change," Mr. Liss says.</p>
<p>Among the skeptics is Alice Cornish of Northington
Partners, Avon, Conn., which specializes in insurance-stock
research. She doesn't expect insurance prices to start rising
until next year, "probably in the second half." And even that
distant prospect, she warns, depends on a drop in the
industry's capital, which has yet to occur.</p>
<p>"I think it's early" to start buying insurance brokerage
stocks, Ms. Cornish says. She expects analysts to start
reducing their earnings estimates for insurance brokers after
the brokers begin reporting second-quarter earnings. After
that happens, Ms. Cornish believes that insurance brokerage
stocks will be available at lower prices than today's.</p>
