	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
downgraded its rating on General Instrument Corp.'s
commercial paper and put its subordinated debt under review,
after a leveraged buy-out offer for the cable-television
equipment maker.
   The rating concern said it lowered the commercial paper
rating to not prime from prime-2. It also will consider
downgrading the subordinated debt, which is rated Baa-3.
About $175 million of debt outstanding is affected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moody's said its action reflects the deteriorated
financial flexibility in General Instrument that would result
from a buyout. It said it expects the deal will be completed
at a minimum of $1.42 billion, the amount proposed Monday by
Forstmann, Little & Co., a buy-out firm. It said General
Instrument's management supports the proposed transaction,
and noted that an enhanced offer could be made. The Forstmann
bid was valued at $44.50 a share. General Instrument shares
closed Tuesday at $45.625, up 50 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, on volume of more than 1.9
million shares, making it the third most-active issue on the
Big Board.</p>
<p>Forstmann Little has said it will use $600 million in
subordinated debt in financing the planned acquisition. The
remainder will be financed with equity from Forstmann Little
investors and syndicated bank loans totaling about $1
billion.</p>
