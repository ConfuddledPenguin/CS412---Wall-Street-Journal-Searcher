	<p class="article-leader">MACON, Ga. -- Charter Medical Corp. said it is considering
proposals for the $100 million sale and leaseback of several
of its hospitals in a step to improve cash flow.
   Charter said the sale-leaseback transactions under review
would generate about $45 million in net cash flow after the
payment of bank debt and transaction costs. J. Rodney
Laughlin, executive vice president, human resources and
development, declined to identify the prospective
sale-leaseback parties, "because we're still looking at
several proposals."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Charter also confirmed that a bond holder had filed a
lawsuit last week against the company in a federal district
court in Macon alleging that Charter had misrepresented its
financial condition in filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commision. A spokesman said the company hasn't yet
received copies of two other similar suits that reportedly
were filed against it this week.</p>
<p>The giant psychiatric and general hospital concern also
said that it decided to bow out of a proposed hospital
management contract in Saudi Arabia, because the bidding
process was dragging on. "We decided to withdraw and go about
our business," said Mr. Laughlin, noting the Saudi project
had become "time consuming and expensive."</p>
<p>In a move aimed at reassuring the public in the wake of a
recent spate of adverse publicity, Charter also said it is
"current with all debt obligations" and noted that following
the return of $6 million from a bid bond posted for the Saudi
Arabian project, it has $50 million in cash on hand and a $30
million line of bank credit available.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts generally hailed the sale-leaseback
proposal as a positive and predictable step that would help
cash flow. "Clearly the sale-leaseback is good," said
Meredith Adler, a First Boston Corp. analyst. "The question
is, is it enough to help them to finance the building they've
already done and to continue to make payments on the debt."
She added that while the cancellation of the Saudi project
was a minor move, it indicates the company's intention of
focusing on its central problems.</p>
<p>Charter, in the face of a tightening market for
psychiatric hospital care, is struggling under $1.6 billion
in debt from the 1988 management-led leveraged buyout of the
company. The company said it is continuing to reduce costs --
particularly in the area of marketing -- to try to get itself
back on track. "We expect to see a good improvement in
reducing expenses in the upcoming months," Mr. Laughlin said.</p>
<p>Charter's woes came to a head in March when the company
said it was taking a $35 million special charge for
accounting irregularities that involved, among other things,
a pervasive practice of inadequately reserving for bad debts.
In June, it laid off 600 workers, about 3% of its workforce.</p>
