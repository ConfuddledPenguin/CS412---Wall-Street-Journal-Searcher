	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices were slightly firmer Wednesday,
declining from midday highs on index-linked selling in late
afternoon trading.
   Stocks in London closed lower on mounting concern about
the strengthening pound and the continued spate of corporate
profit downgradings, while Frankfurt shares rose on support
of a successful start to monetary union with East Germany.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which
gained 254.37 points Tuesday, rose 31.32 points to close at
32445.92.</p>
<p>In early trading Thursday, the Nikkei index was up 21.14
points at 32467.06.</p>
<p>Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
550 million shares, up from 466 million shares Tuesday.</p>
<p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues 641 to 324,
while 160 issues remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section, which gained 0.78 points Tuesday, was up 13.87
points, or 0.59%, at 2363.35.</p>
<p>The second section index, which advanced 13.77 points
Tuesday, was up 19.17 points, or 0.46%, to close at 4222.84.</p>
<p>Volume in the second section was estimated at 28 million
shares, up from 21 million shares Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index rose 213 points during the first half
hour of the morning session. The strength of the yen favored
domestic demand-related shares, while prompting profit-taking
on export-oriented high-technology shares, which had been
bought in the past weeks on expectations that the yen's
weakness would push up their earnings, traders said.</p>
<p>"But buying didn't continue," said Hiroyuki Murai, general
manager of stock trading at Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>Gains made for the domestic demandrelated shares prompted
selling by institutional investors, who hold these issues by
heavy volume, traders said.</p>
<p>Concern about an official discount rate increase by the
Bank of Japan has gradually been slackened this week, helped
by the central bank's recent stance, which is perceived as
neutral in controlling market interest rates, said a senior
trader at Wako Securities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, most investors -- institutions in particular --
continued to hold off from buying, traders said, because the
future of German economic conditions after Sunday's monetary
union and results of the Soviet Communist Party conference,
which will last until July 13, are unclear.</p>
<p>High-priced, high-technology shares were broadly lower.
Fanuc fell 120 yen to 7,700 yen (80 cents to $51), and
Kyocera lost 230 yen to 8,850 yen.</p>
<p>Sony lost 120 yen to 8,750 yen, while TDK fell 100 yen to
7,400 yen and Pioneer dropped 90 yen to 6,350 yen.</p>
<p>Construction and development stocks were firmer on the
day. Ohbayashi rose 30 yen to 1,690 yen, Taisei added 20 yen
to 1,360 yen and Shimizu rose 20 yen to 2,130 yen.</p>
<p>Kajima rose 30 yen to 1,990 yen, and Kumagai Gumi rose 20
yen to 1,160 yen.</p>
<p>In London, the market started the session easier, with
initial losses ascribed to Barclay's de Zoete Wedd
downgrading RTZ's profit forecast.</p>
<p>The pound's continued strength, with the currency standing
at a 16-month high vs. the dollar, heightened nervousness
about stocks with considerable overseas business, prompting
some sell activity.</p>
<p>"People are concerned that, on a currency translation
basis, a number of overseas earners will be disadvantaged by
the strong pound," said one dealer.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Index, which fell
0.3 points Tuesday, ended down 16.2 points at 2355.5.</p>
<p>The narrower Financial Times-Stock Exchange 30-Index,
which fell 1.9 points Tuesday, ended down 13.6 points, at
1881.1.</p>
<p>Dealers said if company profit warnings and downgradings
continue at the current pace, the uncertainty in the market
will continue to prevail.</p>
<p>Leading stocks to fall on currency worries included
Reckitt & Colman, which eased 29 pence to #12.65 (51 cents to
$22.40). RTZ ended down 22 pence at 541 pence.</p>
<p>A profit downgrading of P&O by James Capel sent that
company's share price down 21 pence to 628 pence. A James
Capel source said that P&O's operations were similar to
Trafalgar House, which was downgraded earlier in the week.</p>
<p>The only sector to show gains Wednesday was clearing
banks, with Midland leading, ending up 6 pence at 295 pence
on rumors of a bullish statement by the chairman of Hong Kong
& Shanghai Banking Corp. about a possible merger with Midland
by year end. The report was refuted by both banks.</p>
<p>Total turnover during the session was 353 million shares,
down from an equally modest 449.9 million shares on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Share prices on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange gained 1% in
lively trading. The German Stock Index, or DAX, jumped 18.90
to 1925.13.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was led higher by financial
issues, which were basking in the glow of a stronger bond
market. Market operators are optimistic about the acceptance
of the German Unity Bond, and say that a successful launch of
the unity bond could be a signal for even higher prices in
coming weeks.</p>
<p>Dresdner Bank jumped 15 marks to 449.50 marks (9 cents to
$272.08), Deutsche Bank added 10.50 marks to 818.50 marks,
and Commerzbank gained 7 marks to 293 marks.</p>
<p>The banking sector had lagged the market this year as
fears of a rapid surge in interest rates at the start of
1990, due in large part to worries about the costs of
unification and monetary union, weighed against their share
prices.</p>
<p>But with monetary union passing its first start-up hurdles
without any major hitches, and with German central bank
officials sounding much more optimistic about inflation being
under control, pressures are easing, dealers say.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Zurich, Stockholm
and Madrid; lower in Paris and Milan; and mixed in Brussels
and Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed mixed.</p>
<p>Share prices closed lower in Taipei, Manila and Seoul,
higher in Sydney, Wellington and Singapore and stable in Hong
Kong.</p>
