	<p class="article-leader">EVERETT, Wash. -- John Fluke Mfg. Co. said net orders for
its third quarter ended June 29 were "lower than anticipated"
at $53.7 million. The company declined to say what it had
hoped orders would be.
   It cited reduced orders from defense contractors and
"belt-tightening measures" by certain customers. John Fluke
makes test and measurement instruments.</p>
