	<p class="article-leader">Hibernia Savings Bank, citing troubled real estate loans,
said it will post losses for the second quarter and the first
half, and the Quincy, Mass., company omitted its quarterly
dividend.
   In the year-earlier second quarter, Hibernia earned
$108,992, or 14 cents a share, and in the 1989 first half,
had net income of $514,863, or 63 cents a share. It has been
paying a quarterly dividend of nine cents a share, last paid
in April.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bank said "the continuing deterioration in the real
estate market, which has resulted in increases in the levels
of both nonperforming loans and other real estate owned,"
prompted it to allocate a special loan-loss provision of
$2,150,000 for the latest quarter; Hibernia said it would
have been profitable otherwise.</p>
<p>As of Saturday, after recording the special loan-loss
provision, the bank's capital will be about 6.55%, while
regulatory capital will be 8.05%, and it met all regulatory
capital requirements.</p>
