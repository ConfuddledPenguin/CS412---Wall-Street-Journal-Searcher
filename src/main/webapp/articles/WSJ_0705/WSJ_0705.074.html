	<p class="article-leader">The U.S. and South Korean governments appear to have
resolved their differences over selling McDonnell Douglas
Corp. F/A-18 fighters to Seoul, paving the way for an
agreement to be signed within the next few days.
   The 120-aircraft, $3 billion deal hit a snag a couple of
months ago when the Koreans demanded that the U.S. hand over
sensitive aviation technology.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Congressional critics of the transaction, led by Sen. Alan
Dixon (D., Ill.), have expressed fears that the U.S. will
help build Korea's aerospace sector into a serious economic
rival, undermining one of the few industries in which the
U.S. maintains a trade surplus. That same issue was debated
vociferously on Capitol Hill last spring when lawmakers
considered the fate of the FSX fighter with Japan. That
project, however, calls for co-development of the airplane
with General Dynamics Corp. as opposed to the much more
standard co-production arrangement with the Koreans.</p>
<p>Seoul, for its part, was worried that the U.S. would buy
back only 30% of the contract's total value in Korean goods
-- a standard practice known as "offsetting"; it is not
unusual in military equipment sales for the offset to be
closer to 100%.</p>
<p>Just how those concerns have been resolved wasn't
immediately clear. Congressional sources said the U.S.
appeared to have caved in on a few key points, including
softening its stance on offsets and allowing the Koreans
access to certain engine and flight-control technology.
However, the influential Dong-A Ilbo newspaper reported that
the accord was modified to make it more difficult for South
Korea to acquire sophisticated U.S. technology, especially
computer and radar systems.</p>
<p>Either way, there is little doubt that progress has been
made. A spokesman for St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas said
Tuesday that talks between the two countries "are going well,
and an announcement is expected soon." An industry source
added that McDonnell Douglas has scheduled a meeting for next
week with its subcontractors to plot legislative strategy.</p>
<p>Late last year, the Koreans formally selected the F/A-18,
dubbed the Hornet, over General Dynamics's F-16. The
government plans to buy 12 F/A-18s off the shelf, assemble
another 36 from kits sent from U.S. factories, and then
co-produce another 72 planes on South Korean soil.</p>
<p>Negotiators have been working furiously to conclude a pact
so lawmakers will have sufficient time to elicit public
comment on it, as is required, and still be able to sign off
on the deal during the current congressional session.</p>
<p>Once the agreement hits Capitol Hill, though, it is sure
to cause something of a stir. The Koreans have been accused
in the past of improperly selling U.S. military hardware to
third countries.</p>
<p>Sen. Dixon, aides say, may still decide to introduce a
resolution to scuttle the Korea Fighter Project entirely;
that tack, however, is unlikely to get very far. Of even more
concern to lobbyists backing the program is that restrictive
language will be imposed upon the contract, making it
unpalatable to the Koreans.</p>
<p>"There will be a lot of posturing, but there is nothing
unusual or threatening about this sale," asserted Joel
Johnson, vice president of international activities for the
Aerospace Industries Association, a Washington, D.C., trade
group. "What would be more threatening is if we mess this up
and they turn around and buy European aircraft instead."</p>
<p>"Congressmen," Mr. Johnson added, "keep forgetting that we
have current competitors."</p>
