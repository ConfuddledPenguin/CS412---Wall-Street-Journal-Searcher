	<p class="article-leader">MAYNARD, Mass. -- John F. Smith, recently anointed
second-in-command at Digital Equipment Corp., has the
prognosticators stumped. Is he or isn't he the heir apparent
to Kenneth H. Olsen, Digital's iron-willed founder?
   Jack Smith shrugs off such questions. "I'm disappointed,"
he says. "I always thought I was the No. 2 around here."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It's not surprising that Mr. Smith would want to play down
the significance of his new job as senior vice president for
operations. Historically, getting named Mr. Olsen's No. 2 has
been a precarious perch. The last person to hold the job,
John J. Shields, resigned last year after falling from favor
with Mr. Olsen and being stripped of his power. He's now
president of competitor Prime Computer Inc.</p>
<p>Succession is a delicate subject at Digital, which is one
of the largest companies in the world still run by its
founder. Mr. Olsen, 64 years old, shows no signs of slowing
down, and has disavowed any interest in retirement. He has
dominated Digital's executive ranks for so long that many of
the company's top executives labor in near anonymity.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Smith's promotion wasn't accompanied by a
public announcement, even though he was given sweeping
responsibility over all sales, field service, engineering,
marketing and manufacturing.</p>
<p>"Jack Smith is in the hot seat," says George Colony,
president of consultant Forrester Research Inc. "Digital is
facing some rough water over the next 18 months. If he can't
turn things around, then he'll be out, too. If he can, he'll
deserve to be named president."</p>
<p>If that happens, insiders say, Mr. Olsen would take the
title of chairman and step back from day-to-day management.
But he's unlikely to take that step while Digital is on the
defensive. After years of breakneck growth that made it the
world's second-largest computer maker, Digital is now
struggling to cut costs and spark new growth.</p>
<p>Digital's unusual management structure makes handicapping
the race to succeed Mr. Olsen especially difficult. The
computer giant has never had a chairman, chief executive
officer or chief operating officer. James M. Osterhof, a
former Ford Motor Co. executive who is now Digital's vice
president for finance, says that "at Ford, you could flip
open the policy manual and find a detailed organizational
chart on page two. There's nothing even remotely like that
here."</p>
<p>But Mr. Smith's new title may not make things any clearer.
If Mr. Olsen stays at the helm another five years or more,
Mr. Smith, 55, could very well serve out his career as
second-in-command. "He'd be Olsen's day-to-day operations
man, a very capable, loyal lieutenant -- but not necessarily
the guy who will take Digital to the 21st century," says Marc
G. Schulman of UBS Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Despite his broad influence within the world's second
largest computer maker, Mr. Smith has a low profile in the
industry. "I guess I'm relatively unknown," Mr. Smith says.
"Some people seek out the limelight. I'm not really that kind
of person."</p>
<p>That low profile may have helped his career. "Jack has
shown tremendous staying power," says Don McInnis, a former
executive who is now a vice president at Prime. "He knows how
to work effectively with Ken -- and he can move his ego aside
to get the job done." As a result, others say, he is less
likely to suffer Mr. Shields's fate.</p>
<p>Friends describe Mr. Smith as the consummate insider. He
was Digital's 12th employee, handling everything in those
early days from wiring logic modules to painting cabinets and
sweeping the floor. He has run Digital's manufacturing for
much of his career.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith thinks Digital has to take some swift steps to
regain its competitive edge. "We're at war," he says. "Our
profit level is at its lowest in the company's 33-year
history. We have too high a cost structure, and it's obvious
that we can eliminate more jobs." In key areas, he says, "we
took our eyes off the ball."</p>
<p>Digital already has cut 3,000 jobs through a voluntary
severance program. But that's only about half of what has to
be done, he says, indicating that the goal is to trim the
payroll by a total of about 6,000 to 8,000 people. As of
March 30, Digital employed 125,800.</p>
<p>Philip Caldwell, a longtime Digital board member and the
former chairman of Ford, says Mr. Smith "has had an
opportunity for hands-on experience in virtually all the line
activities. He's done well in those assignments,
demonstrating leadership and judgment." Mr. Smith, he says,
"knows where all the bodies are buried in the organization,
and that can come in handy." But he indicated that the board
hasn't made any final decisions on succession. "It's
something that has to be undertaken one step at a time," he
says.</p>
<p>Mr. Caldwell says that as difficult as it is to imagine
Digital without Mr. Olsen, succession is the board's biggest
task. "Digital in so many ways is a reflection of this one
man," he says. "But the world had to consider Ford Motor Co.
without Henry Ford, too."</p>
