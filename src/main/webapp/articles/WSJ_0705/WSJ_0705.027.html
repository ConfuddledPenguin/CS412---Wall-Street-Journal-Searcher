	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Unocal Corp. said one of its units
completed the acquisition of the Prairie Producing unit of
Placer Dome Inc. for about $336 million. Placer is a
Vancouver-based gold producer.
   The transaction, which includes about $252 million in
cash, adds to Unocal's natural gas reserves and new
exploratory lands in East Texas and Louisiana. The buyer is a
unit of Union Exploration Partners, or UXP, a Houston-based
limited partnership 95%-owned by the oil giant.</p>
