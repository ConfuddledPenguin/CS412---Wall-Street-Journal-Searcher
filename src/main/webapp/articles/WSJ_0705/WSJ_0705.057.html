	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- When is a treaty not a treaty?
   That is the sticky political and legal question the Bush
administration is encountering as it prepares to ask Congress
to approve the agreements signed by President Bush and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev at last month's summit meeting. The
way the question is answered is far more than a matter of
legal arcana; it could set precedents for a whole series of
historic U.S.-Soviet agreements likely to be wrapped up in
the next few years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Contrary to general perceptions at the summit, the
administration isn't treating the most important deals Mr.
Bush and Mr. Gorbachev signed -- a pact to eliminate chemical
weapons and a trade agreement -- as formal treaties, which
would require ratification by two-thirds of the Senate. That
process often has resulted in amendments and reservations
that then require further negotiations. Instead, the
chemical-weapons and trade accords are to be treated as
executive agreements, which can be approved by resolutions
backed by simple majorities of the House and Senate.</p>
<p>And that already is generating spats between Congress and
the White House -- and between the two houses of Congress
itself.</p>
<p>Prominent senators from both parties -- including 18 of
the 19 members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee --
have formally protested that the decision not to treat the
chemical-arms deal as a treaty robs them of their
constitutional ratification rights. "We must be unequivocal
about the imperative that significant international
agreements take treaty form," declare Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell, a Rhode Island Democrat,
and ranking Republican Jesse Helms of North Carolina in a
joint letter to Mr. Bush.</p>
<p>And Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.) warns that failing to
allow the Senate to ratify the deal would be "a serious
political mistake."</p>
<p>There isn't the same kind of dispute over the treatment of
the trade pact. Under American trade law and tradition, such
bilateral trade deals are treated as executive agreements and
submitted to both the House and the Senate for simple
majority approval.</p>
<p>But there's a related problem with the trade pact. Bush
administration officials contend, and many in Congress
concur, that for technical reasons the current process for
approving trade deals is unconstitional because the
resolutions of approval aren't sent to the president for
signature. So, although the White House says it doesn't
intend to do so, some administration lawyers contend
President Bush could put the trade deal into effect without
approval unless Congress passes pending legislation to fix
the system.</p>
<p>That legislation seems likely to clear Congress soon. But
if it doesn't, the question of what sort of congressional
approval is legally necessary could still emerge as a
debating point when the trade deal is submitted for approval,
probably later this year. That would be particularly
important if Congress remains angry over Mr. Gorbachev's
treatment of Lithuania and continues threatening to block the
trade deal in retaliation.</p>
<p>For now, the more politically charged debate is on the
chemical-arms deal, which requires an end to production of
chemical weapons and destruction of a large share of existing
stockpiles. The question of whether such a pact is a treaty
or not is a murky area of constitutional law, leaving much
open to presidential discretion.</p>
<p>The White House doesn't consider the pact a full-blown
treaty because it is supposed to be just an "interim" step
toward a broader, multinational accord banning chemical
weapons world-wide, says C. Boyden Gray, the president's
counsel. In addition, administration aides contend, the House
has been particularly active on chemical-weapons issues and
shouldn't be cut out of the approval process, as it would be
in a Senate treaty ratification.</p>
<p>But many in Congress suspect that other, long-range
political considerations also are behind the administration's
calculation.</p>
<p>Persuading two-thirds of the Senate's 100 members to
ratify a formal treaty without them first tacking on their
own amendments and reservations has proven to be a tough job
in recent years. So some suspect that the administration's
handling of the chemical-weapons deal, which even Sen. Biden
says probably would get the two-thirds Senate support, may be
intended in part to set a pattern of approving some arms
accords through resolutions requiring only a simple majority
-- an important point at a time when six arms deals with the
Soviets could be completed in coming years.</p>
<p>"It's such an epic struggle to get a treaty through the
Senate that if you're going to go ahead on a pragmatic basis
you're going to have to go more to the executive agreement,"
says Rep. Lee Hamilton (D., Ind.), a leading Democrat on the
House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>In fact, there is some historical precedent for treating
arms pacts this way. The SALT I strategic-arms accord also
wasn't ratified as a treaty but rather approved by both
houses as an executive agreement. Under President Nixon, as
now, the White House argued that the pact was merely an
"interim accord" leading to a broader SALT II agreement --
which also never was ratified by the Senate because of the
invasion of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>As if to underscore the problem with getting treaties
ratified, Mr. Bush has just sent to the Senate for
ratification two lesspublicized agreements he signed with Mr.
Gorbachev at the summit, which detail how to verify limits on
underground nuclear explosions. Those agreements are designed
to finally win ratification of two nuclear-testing accords
with the Soviets, which have been lying unratified for 14
years.</p>
<p>House members would love to see arms deals treated as
executive agreements because they are cut out of the action
in a Senate treaty-ratification process. As a result, some
intracongressional sniping has broken out between House
members and senators over the handling of the chemicalarms
pact.</p>
<p>Recently, Secretary of State James Baker appeared before
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and was chided for
declining to submit the chemical-weapons pact as a treaty.
Sen. Biden, in particular, argued that the deal is
significant because it would commit the U.S. to ban
production of an entire class of weapons, and therefore
should be treated as a "serious and significant" treaty.</p>
<p>The next morning, Mr. Baker appeared before the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, and Rep. Dante Fascell (D., Fla.),
the panel's chairman, immediately argued against his Senate
colleagues. He implored the administration to continue
treating the deal as an executive agreement and even
declared: "I congratulate the administration for sending this
up as an executive agreement."</p>
<p>The House should play a role in approval because on
chemical arms "there's been a debate going on in Congress for
the last eight or nine years in which the House has been
intimately involved," Rep. Fascell says in an interview.
Besides, he adds, the decision of whether to call the pact a
treaty or an executive agreement "is purely a political
decision. Both have equal effect in law."</p>
<p>And in fact, there aren't any hard and fast rules to
distinguish between a treaty and an executive agreement. Such
ambiguity about the constitutional rights of Congress is
"always the case in foreign afffairs," says Louis Fisher, a
specialist on executive and legislative powers at the Library
of Congress. "Whenever it gets gray, that means the
institutions have to be alert to their own powers, and if
they think they're being infringed, then to fight back."</p>
