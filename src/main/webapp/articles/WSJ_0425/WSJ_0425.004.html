	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Quaker Oats Co. decided to spin off its
troubled Fisher-Price toy business to shareholders, allowing
management to concentrate on other difficulties at what, for
the first time in two decades, is a "pure" food company.
   The big packaged foods company boasts some sterling brand
names and strong market positions. Overseas business is
booming. But in recent months it has struggled with sluggish
sales in its U.S. and Canadian grocery products businesses,
particularly with pet foods and snacks. Meanwhile,
competition across the table is becoming increasingly
intense; soft-drink giants Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are
organizing attacks on Quaker's biggest-selling product,
Gatorade.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thus, the decision to spin off Fisher-Price seems, as
Quaker's oatmeal spokesman Wilford Brimley puts it, "the
right thing to do."</p>
<p>"Hallelujah]" exclaimed Prudential-Bache Securities food
analyst John McMillin, long an advocate of the spinoff.</p>
<p>Other analysts also applauded. "Management was spending a
lot of time on Fisher-Price, so just being able to focus on
their basic businesses has got to be a plus," said Roger W.
Spencer of PaineWebber Inc.</p>
<p>Quaker stock initially jumped on the news, rising more
than a dollar before settling at $49.25 a share, up 62.5
cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
Quaker's 52-week high was $68.875.</p>
<p>If regulators approve the spinoff -- now planned for early
next year -- Fisher-Price would become an independent,
free-standing company ranking among the top six U.S. toy
makers. In its most recent fiscal year, Fisher-Price reported
sales of $844.8 million and $97 million in operating
earnings. But after a disastrous Christmas season, the
company will end this year substantially in the red. William
D. Smithburg, chairman and chief executive of Quaker Oats,
estimated Fisher-Price's total losses for the year could
reach "somewhere around $20 million to $30 million."</p>
<p>Under the planned spinoff, Quaker shareholders would
receive stock in the new company, but the number of shares
won't be determined for some time, a spokesman said. That
will depend on the number of Quaker shares outstanding and
the value of the toy company. Quaker now has 75.5 million
shares outstanding, but has been aggressively repurchasing
its stock of late.</p>
<p>Quaker said it will transfer an unspecified amount of its
debt to the new entity, but "we intend to structure the debt
so Fisher-Price is in a position of strength and able to be
self-sufficient," a spokesman said.</p>
<p>In the latest nine months, the toy division had sales of
about $566 million, but inventory write-offs and trade
markdowns following the Christmas fiasco, plus a subsequent
plant closing, led to an operating loss of about $34.8
million for the period. Based in East Aurora, N.Y.,
Fisher-Price has about 7,400 employees world-wide and
represents about 17% of its parent's identifiable assets.</p>
<p>Quaker had built Fisher-Price from a $30 million business
in 1969 and profited handsomely from toys that became
household staples for preschoolers. But last year's overly
ambitious product line, which not only couldn't be delivered
to stores in time but failed to wow consumers, left the
parent company bloodied and angry. Fisher-Price's former
president departed in January, to be temporarily replaced by
executives coincidentally named Fisher and Price.</p>
<p>Paul E. Price, senior vice president of finance at the
parent company, has served as Fisher-Price's temporary
president, but will return to Quaker after the spinoff, the
company said. It is now searching for a new chief executive
officer to head the toymaker when it strikes out on its own.</p>
<p>Shareholders wondering how Fisher-Price will fare
independent of Quaker might get some guidance from the past.
In a move strikingly similar to Quaker's, in 1985 General
Mills Inc. spun off its Kenner and Parker Brothers toy group
as an independent concern. The spun-off company subsequently
was acquired by Tonka Corp., which earlier this week reported
a loss for the latest quarter.</p>
<p>"It is a risky business, totally product driven," said toy
industry analyst Carol Palmer of Duff & Phelps, Chicago,
commenting on an independent Fisher-Price's chances. "To the
extent that Fisher-Price has toothpaste-type products, that
makes them a little more stable."</p>
<p>Assuming the spinoff goes as planned, Quaker executives
will be able to concentrate on fixing the bread-and-butter
businesses. Noting that Fisher-Price's latest "trough" was
its third under Quaker's ownership, Mr. Smithburg said that
without the toy business, "We can clearly focus better on
groceries."</p>
<p>Chief among his concerns is likely to be getting the
Gaines dog food house in order. Although Quaker has a strong
European franchise, it is fighting to hold a low-margin 20%
of the U.S. dog food market -- a performance that Mr.
Smithburg acknowledges "for the last few years has been below
expectations." But, he added in an interview yesterday, "we
think profitability on pet foods has bottomed out, and expect
to see increases in profit next year and volume stability on
key brands by the summer."</p>
<p>Volume is a tricky issue at Quaker. While overall volume
in its U.S. and Canadian grocery products business fell 4% in
the latest quarter, the company increasingly is concentrating
its marketing dollars on higher-margin items. Despite
"intense competition," Mr. Smithburg predicts "a good fourth
quarter" in grocery products.</p>
<p>Analysts are circumspect. Nomi Ghez, an analyst at
Goldman, Sachs & Co., yesterday cut her estimate for Quaker's
1990 operating earnings to $3.10 from $3.20. "I frankly could
see some benefits in keeping the {toy} business and turning
it around, since they have gone through most of the pain
already," she said. "Now they're left with a lackluster food
business that can maybe grow over time at 10% to 12%."</p>
<p>Quaker has been atop many of Wall Street's takeover target
lists in recent months, as its stock slumped below
food-industry rivals. Prudential-Bache's Mr. McMillin said:
"You can argue they're doing a raider's dirty work" by
spinning off Fisher-Price, but the move "creates shareholder
values, which should boost the stock. Investors have been
valuing Fisher-Price at zero."</p>
<p>Mr. McMillin said he recently advised clients that Nestle
S.A., the world's biggest food conglomerate, "has always
coveted Quaker's businesses and would be the most likely
corporate buyer. Unilever and Philip Morris would also be
candidates."</p>
<p>But Mr. Smithburg, who lately has stressed his company's
desire to remain independent, yesterday sought to minimize
such speculation. "I don't lose a lot of sleep over
takeovers," he said. "My task is to run the company the best
way possible."</p>
