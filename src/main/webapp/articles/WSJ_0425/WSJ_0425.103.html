	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- MGM Grand Air, the luxury airline unit of
MGM Grand Inc., said it plans to add three reconfigured DC8
Super 62 aircraft to its main New York-Los Angeles route in
August, replacing the 727-100s currently in use.
   The new aircraft will double MGM Grand's capacity on its
New York-Los Angeles route, Charles L. Demoney, the airline's
president and chief executive officer, said. Two of the
727-100s will be used for charter flights, and a third may be
put up for sale, he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The luxury airline, which began service in September 1987,
said the DC-8s will be reconfigured from 190 seats to 81
seats each. The company will spend $55.5 million to buy and
refurbish the planes; that equals about $162,500 a seat. The
new planes' cargo capacity may enable the airline to boost
revenue 4% to 5% from cargo business, Mr. Demoney said.</p>
<p>MGM Grand began turning a profit after five quarters of
operation, he said; it reported revenue of $30.2 million for
1989, a 36% increase from the prior year. The airline runs at
a load factor of about 75%, but Mr. Demoney said it may show
load factors in the high 50% range in the first months of the
larger planes' operation.</p>
<p>The airline offers luxury transcontinental service at a
fare of $1,017 one way, roughly equal to other airlines'
first-class rate. Although the airline hopes to launch
international service to London, Tokyo and Paris, no such
move is likely anytime soon, the company said.</p>
<p>MGM Grand, which is controlled by investor Kirk
Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp., also operates a Las Vegas casino
and plans to build another Las Vegas entertainment project.</p>
