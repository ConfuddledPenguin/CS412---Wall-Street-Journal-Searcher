	<p class="article-leader">MIDLAND, Mich. -- Dow Chemical Co. said first-quarter
earnings dropped 38% with the combined effects of higher
feedstock costs and lower commodity prices.
   The chemical and specialty-product company said net income
fell to $462 million, or $1.71 a share, from $743 million, or
$2.72 a share, a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales increased 9.3% to $4.9 billion from $4.49 billion.</p>
<p>Results were slightly below the expected range of $1.75 to
$1.90 a share. But several analysts said they weren't
downgrading estimates for the year, which ranged from $6.25
to $7.40, depending on economic forecasts.</p>
<p>The company said results were "good" and represented a
return to "more normal" earnings levels, following a record
high in the 1989 first quarter. Dow Chemical shares closed at
$61, down 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday.</p>
<p>The company said sales volume increased 18%, but prices
fell nearly 8% and hydrocarbon and energy costs were up
nearly 6%. Operating profit dropped 43% for chemicals and
performance products, 42% for plastics and 89% for
hydrocarbons and energy. Negative effects of commodity
chemicals were partly offset by consumer, agriculture and
pharmaceutical products, where sales rose 62% and operating
profit doubled.</p>
<p>"Clearly, our diversification strategy is paying off,"
said Frank Popoff, president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Popoff said results for 1990 will be "strong," but
below 1989 net of $2.49 billion, or $9.20 a share. The
second-quarter outlook is improving with declining costs and
rising prices for several high-volume products, he says. But
analyst Theodore S. Semegran of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
warned that rising petrochemical capacity through 1992 would
continue to shrink margins and hold down earnings this year
and in 1991.</p>
