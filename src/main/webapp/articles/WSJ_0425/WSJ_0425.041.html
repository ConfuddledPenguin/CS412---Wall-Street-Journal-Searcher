   On Secret-Agent Cars</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>IT'S TEMPTING enough: Spend $2 a minute on the
1-900-HOT-CARS line and get names of auctions where Ferraris
and Porsches -- repossessed, seized in drug raids or driven
by "government agents" -- can be had for "as little as $100."</p>
<p>If it sounds too good to be true, it is. The majority of
vehicles sold at government and many private auctions are
dumpy domestic sedans, not the exotica whizzing around on
Miami Vice reruns. A federal auction in Michigan recently
mentioned on the 900-service did sell cars used by government
agents, but they were 1987 Chevrolet Celebrities and 1986
Plymouth Reliants used by the FBI, hardly the stuff of 007.</p>
<p>On the rare occasion when something savory shows up, like
a low-mileage BMW 735i, it will go for $37,000, not $100. So
which cars cost $100? According to auctioneers, they're
usually weary wagons with lots of dents and miles.</p>
<p>Auctioneers say they aren't connected with the 900
service, and some say they dislike it. That's because
consumers blame the auctioneers, not the phone service, when
"hot cars" at cheap prices don't materialize. "The whole idea
is defrauding people who come thinking they'll get a Ferrari
for $100," asserts Jack Ostoin, owner of J&D Recovery & Auto
Auction of Detroit. "That never happens."</p>
<p>A recent call to get Pennsylvania auction dates lasted
nine minutes and cost $18. Dean Vlahos, president of U.S.
Sales Corp., which runs the Hot Cars line, says people can
avoid the toll with a $99 lifetime membership.</p>
<p>Mr. Vlahos says Ferraris have been sold at these auctions,
but that people "have to use a little common sense" about
what cars will sell cheaply.</p>
<p>He says his company has a right to air information about
the auctions because it's publicly available. That's the rub:
People can find out about the auctions -- a lot more cheaply
-- in newspapers or through the Yellow Pages.</p>
<p>A Word to the Wise:</p>
<p>Go Beyond the Guide</p>
<p>CAR PRICING guides, which direct buyers in their
bargaining, are proliferating. But going strictly by the
books, which compare the difference between dealer invoice
costs and retail sticker prices, doesn't guarantee a good
deal.</p>
<p>"Usually guys who come armed with information from those
services and make an offer on that basis end up paying more,"
says Ron Salhany, a Port Richey, Fla., Buick dealer.</p>
<p>While guides such as the Edmund's car price books or
Changing Times magazine's automotive annual take pains to be
accurate, prices can change suddenly. And the guides don't
deal with the ever-fluctuating rebates and option-package
discounts.</p>
<p>The guides also don't direct buyers to aim for a break on
fixed dealer costs such as destination or advertising
charges. The guides also don't take into account the 3%
profit for domestic dealers built into invoice prices -- a
margin that can be negotiable.</p>
<p>The guides are valuable in helping people approximate what
they should pay for a car.</p>
<p>One guide even suggests a target price. "The target price
we put in our book is a good price," says Peter S. Levy,
president of IntelliChoice Inc., a San Jose, Calif.,
publisher of price books. "But," he adds, "anybody can get a
better price if they are savvy negotiators."</p>
<p>Car Companies Attempt</p>
<p>To Sort Out Recycling</p>
<p>RECYCLABLE CARS are becoming a goal, but they are probably
years away.</p>
<p>Right now there isn't much financial incentive to reuse
car materials, but penalties for not doing so may be down the
road. So car makers are trying to think ahead.</p>
<p>The biggest problem involves the plethora of materials
used to build cars. Autos once were made of glass, steel,
rubber and plastic, which were easy to separate for
recycling. Now, even midsized cars can contain 250 pounds of
plastic alone, of which there may be 20 varieties.</p>
<p>As a result, modern cars are a recycling nightmare, with
only about 60% of their materials recoverable. To improve
that ratio, BMW, which has felt political pressure from
German environmentalists, has begun designing cars so they
are as easy to disassemble as they are to build.</p>
<p>"We can't use robots or machines," says Christoph Huss,
BMW's product information manager in the U.S. "It's very
difficult get to all of the parts."</p>
<p>BMW doesn't expect full-scale recycling within 15 years.
The toughest obstacle: getting all auto makers to use only
certain materials for certain parts in order to simplify
reclamation.</p>
<p>General Motors Corp., meanwhile, says a chemical
decomposition method formerly used for old tires may be the
key to recycling the huge plastic panels used on its Lumina
APV, Trans Sport and Silhouette minivans.</p>
<p>More Dealers Count On</p>
<p>`Almost New' Fleet Cars</p>
<p>BUYERS LOOKING for good prices on 1990 models may soon
find them -- on used-car lots.</p>
<p>Big rental fleets are already shipping some of this year's
models off to dealer auctions now that snowbirds are
returning the cars in places like Florida and Arizona. More
important, dealers are eagerly snapping them up, figuring
they'll sell well at a time when new cars aren't moving.</p>
<p>Late-model used fleet cars can have 20,000 or more miles
on them, but can cost about $3,000 less than brand new
models.</p>
<p>"So far this year it seems that everybody decided all they
could buy are rental cars for their used-car lots," says Greg
Gehman, general manager of the Manheim (Pa.) Auto Auction.
"Demand just turned on like a faucet."</p>
