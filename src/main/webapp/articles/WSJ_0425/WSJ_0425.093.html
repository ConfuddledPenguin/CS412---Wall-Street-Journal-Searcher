	<p class="article-leader">FAIRFAX, Va. -- After launching its experimental Pegasus
rocket, Orbital Sciences Corp. finally launched its initial
public offering.
   The company sold about 2.4 million shares at $14 each
Monday -- $1 a share more than the company had planned last
month when it abruptly canceled the offering. On the day of
the proposed offering, a Wall Street Journal article
appeared, describing the steep risks involved in the Pegasus
project and apparently spooking the company and investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But since that time, things have gone well for Orbital
Sciences. In early April, it successfully launched Pegasus,
which is carried on the wing of a B-52 bomber and is dropped
over the ocean before it ignites. Pegasus is designed to
carry small satellites into space -- an emerging market that
has largely been ignored by the big aerospace companies as
too risky or too small.</p>
<p>Cash-strapped Orbital Sciences sold about 1,250,000 shares
itself, raising about $17.5 million, before underwriting
fees. Outside investors sold about 1,150,000 shares. Orbital
Sciences didn't return calls seeking comment. Its
underwriter, Alex. Brown & Sons, confirmed that the shares
had been sold.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in its first day of trading, the rocket
company's shares opened at $14.50 in over-the-counter trading
and closed at $14. About 1.2 million shares were traded.</p>
