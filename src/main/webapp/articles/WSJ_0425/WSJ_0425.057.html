	<p class="article-leader">Just a decade ago the Southern Baptists seemed ready to
dominate the American religious landscape. Growing by an
average 200,000 members a year, the Southern Baptist
Convention had become the nation's second largest religious
body, behind the Roman Catholic Church, and it had plenty of
ambition for growth.
   The denomination's leaders had launched a campaign to
"reach every person in the world with the gospel of Jesus
Christ by the year 2000." They had leaped into conservative
Sunbelt politics, championing the candidacy of Ronald Reagan
and others. And the new leadership, headed by conservative
Texas state judge Paul Pressler, had just vowed to rid the
denomination of "liberals" who weakened the movement from
within.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Over the past decade, Mr. Pressler and his ideological
partner, Paige Patterson, have set about doing just that,
triggering a purge of an unprecedented number of teachers and
staffers who don't agree with their fundamentalist views. But
rather than gaining strength, the Southern Baptist juggernaut
has stalled, and many members blame what they say is the
overzealous leadership of Messrs. Pressler and Patterson.</p>
<p>The convention is now losing more active members than it
is adding, and fewer and fewer missionaries and seminary
students are signing up to spread its word. Some churches
have begun withholding contributions to the convention's
coffers, forcing some Baptist agencies to cut their staffs
and postpone salary increases.</p>
<p>Should this slide continue, "it would threaten everything
we do," says Harold C. Bennett, treasurer of the convention's
executive committee.</p>
<p>Demographic factors account for some of this decline. The
baby boom generation has been less likely to attend church or
to remain loyal to a particular denomination. Many Protestant
churches, for example, have experienced more severe
membership slides. But many Baptists themselves largely point
to the internal dissension and ill will they say has been
created by the 11 years of fundamentalist rule led by Mr.
Pressler and Mr. Patterson. Mr. Pressler, 59 years old, last
year turned down an offer from President Bush to head the
Office of Government Ethics (following bitter protests from
moderate Baptists). Mr. Patterson, 47, is the president of
Criswell College, a Baptist institution in Dallas.</p>
<p>Gene Puckett, an outspoken moderate who is editor of the
Baptist state newspaper in North Carolina, wrote in a recent
editorial: "No denomination can stand the continued stress
Southern Baptists have known for 11 years. We are
step-by-step self-destructing."</p>
<p>John Baugh, a 75- year-old Houston millionaire who has
given generously to Baptist causes, is now spending plenty of
money on a campaign to oust the Pressler-Patterson faction
from the leadership.</p>
<p>The Rev. John Hewett, pastor of the First Baptist Church
of Asheville, N.C., says, "People aren't stupid: They won't
continue to give $100,000 a year to something that's going to
eradicate what they stand for."</p>
<p>The slight, combative Mr. Pressler, who sits on the ruling
77-man executive committee, and the stocky and soft-spoken
Mr. Patterson, who is a trustee of the convention's foreign
mission board, derive most of their power from their
positions as chief political strategist and chief ideologue,
respectively, of the denomination's fundamentalist wing. The
fundamentalists believe that life should be ruled by a
resolutely literal interpretation of the Bible.</p>
<p>Messrs. Pressler and Patterson play down the nature of the
troubles within the convention, noting that the national
organization raised a record $137 million last year, and that
contributions have continued to rise every year under their
tenurealbeit by a much smaller amount than they used to.</p>
<p>They do acknowledge that the movement has lost its
momentum, but they vow to right that soon. Says Mr. Pressler,
"When the fire is recovered in the pulpits . . . we'll see
great things accomplished," he says. "This is going to mean
more baptisms, more contributions, more evangelistic zeal."</p>
<p>Mr. Pressler says the revival will take place as soon as
he has eradicated what he calls "the fruits of liberalism,"
which he says "take a long time to develop" and an even
longer time to dispel.</p>
<p>For many, however, simply finding "liberals" in the
Southern Baptist Convention isn't an easy task.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 1845, when it split with northern
Baptists over the issue of slavery, the Southern Baptist
movement has played a major role in shaping conservative
Southern values. From its revivals, in which the faithful
march down the church aisle and become "born again" by
publicly declaring their faith in Jesus, to its ubiquitous
Sunday schools, vacation Bible camps and Baptist colleges,
the denomination has imbued its members with the notion that
they are chosen by God to evangelize a sinful world. They
tend to shun tobacco, alcohol and dancing.</p>
<p>Mr. Baugh, the Houston millionaire and Baptist moderate,
says he has "never seen a liberal in the Southern Baptist
Convention."</p>
<p>But Messrs. Patterson and Pressler have seen them, going
back quite a few years. Mr. Patterson, who began preaching
publicly at age 15, recalls that at one point in the 1950s,
he informed his father, a prominent Baptist who later became
executive director of the General Baptist Convention of
Texas, that the faculty of nearby Hardin-Simmons University
in Abilene was theologically soft.</p>
<p>Mr. Patterson soon went off to a seminary in New Orleans,
where he first met the young Princeton-educated attorney, Mr.
Pressler, who was visiting. Mr. Patterson vividly recalls
that the two like-minded Baptists spent an entire night in
the French Quarter's Cafe du Monde, where, oblivious to the
revelry going on about them, they munched sugar doughnuts and
plotted how they would one day rid their denomination of
liberalism. "That was where this all started," he says. "We
think they should put a plaque there."</p>
<p>The fundamentalists believe women should have no role in
church leadership, that abortion of any kind is wrong and
that prayer in schools should be mandatory. The "liberals"
tend to support abortion in limited cases, believe women
should be allowed to hold church office and vigorously oppose
school prayer as a violation of the separation between church
and state.</p>
<p>Rhetoric has been anything but kind over the years, with
moderate Baptists labeling fundamentalists "fanatics," among
other things, and fundamentalists choosing such phrases as
"skunks" and "rattlesnakes" for their opponents.</p>
<p>But for the many years the moderates controlled national
offices, moderates and fundamentalists generally co-existed
within the denomination, each maintaining their own positions
as heads of churches and colleges and in state and local
Baptist offices.</p>
<p>Mr. Pressler says he was finally moved to change all that
in 1977 when he received complaints from five freshmen at
Baptist-supported Baylor University in Waco, Texas, about
"liberal" textbooks. He recalls one such textbook asserting
that the Old Testament's Book of Daniel contains historical
errors. Mr. Pressler says he concluded that this and other
teachings at Baylor were theological "garbage," so he set out
to drive the liberals from the Baptist temple.</p>
<p>By 1979, his political skills bore fruit, as his
well-organized fundamentalist faction swamped the generally
sleepy annual convention, marking the first of 10 straight
electoral victories. Over the years, the fundamentalists have
consolidated their power to an extent moderates say they
never did, moving in on moderate scholars, ministers and
state and local denomination officials.</p>
<p>The Rev. Claude Stewart taught theology at Southeastern
Baptist Theological Seminary near Raleigh, N.C., until 1987,
when he became the first of more than a dozen faculty members
to resign in the face of a fundamentalist takeover of the
school's board of trustees. "Frankly, I knew that I
represented the left-wing of the spectrum there," Mr. Stewart
says. The so-called left wing there supported the ordination
of women.</p>
<p>While getting rid of the likes of Mr. Stewart may ensure
that a more fundamentalist view is taken in the schools, it
hasn't helped with the all-important fundraising or in
recruiting new members to the denomination.</p>
<p>At the denomination's national headquarters, housed in a
three-block long cluster of buildings in downtown Nashville,
Tenn., Baptist bureaucrats have discovered that moderates,
who are becoming more and more dismayed with the
fundamentalist turn in their faith, are the biggest givers to
church fund-raising drives. In North Carolina, a hotbed of
moderate resistance, $557,000 in contributions that normally
would have gone to Nashville were withheld in protest last
year, up from $20,000 the year before.</p>
<p>The Rev. Ferris Akins, who directs missionary work for 50
central Texas churches, says he used to support the
fundamentalists until he discovered that, in general, their
churches often passed little of their own funds on to
Nashville.</p>
<p>Last summer, the denomination's Executive Committee
announced that because of a fund-raising shortage, $23
million in projects for the 1985-90 period -- mostly building
projects at the seminaries -- would have to be tackled
sometime in the next decade.</p>
<p>But perhaps more important than the shortage of money is
the public-relations problem the denomination's squabbling is
causing throughout the South.</p>
<p>Curious to see what others thought of his fellow Baptists,
I.L. Clayton, a retired Raleigh, N.C., businessman, decided
to poll the Sunday lunch crowd at a local K&W Cafeteria last
year. "The first lady I talked to said, `I'm a Baptist, but
I'm ashamed to admit it,'" he recalls. Other diners who
weren't Baptists either denounced the denomination or simply
asked, "Why do you fight all the time?"</p>
<p>Enrollment at the six Southern Baptist seminaries has
fallen 14% since 1985. At Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, President Russell Dilday says
many young Baptist men and women fear being sucked into the
fight. "This is not a good time, they say, to go into
Southern Baptist ministry and mission work," he says.</p>
<p>On Monday, fundamentalists, who recently gained control of
the board of the Southern Baptist seminary in Louisville,
Ky., encouraged students to tape-record their teachers to
make sure the instructors follow fundamentalist views in the
classroom. The seminary also in effect barred its employees
from opposing its anti-abortion stand, and it encouraged
employees to campaign for new laws that would bar abortion
except in cases where the mother's life is in danger.</p>
<p>Even some fundamentalists say their national leadership
has become too concerned with purging nonbelievers and with
internal and external politics.</p>
<p>The most important break inside the fundamentalist camp
came last fall when the Rev. David Montoya, a pastor in
Gravette, Ark., and one of the fundamentalists' eight
"district leaders" in Arkansas, quit after some local Baptist
leaders whom he says are hard-line conservatives were accused
by fundamentalists of being "liberals."</p>
<p>Before he broke with the organization, Mr. Montoya taped a
political "strategy session" in which fundamentalists laid
plans to take over the Arkansas Baptist Convention -- one of
the few state organizations they don't already dominate -- by
busing in supporters to swamp the annual state meeting. Newly
elected fundamentalist officers would then dismiss some of
the convention's top staff members, the so-called liberals.
Mr. Montoya leaked the tape, touching off an uproar among the
state's Baptists, who voted to reject the fundamentalist
candidate for state convention president.</p>
<p>Some prominent Baptists now say they worry that the
deepening ill will could lead some individual churches to
simply secede from the convention and join another related
sect, such as the American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A.,
formerly known as the northern Baptists. Unlike more tightly
organized denominations like the Episcopalians or Methodists,
the Southern Baptist Convention has always been a loose
coalition of independent, autonomous churches that can easily
withhold funds or break completely away from the national
organization.</p>
<p>Bill J. Leonard, professor of church history at the
Southern Baptist seminary in Louisville, writes in a history
of the convention scheduled to be published in June that "the
possibility exists that the Southern Baptist Convention could
be permanently split."</p>
<p>Still, the fundamentalist leaders say they are
unconcerned. They fully expect to once-again sweep the annual
leadership elections slated for June 12-14 in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Mr. Patterson, for one, claims that "we'll more than
replace" any denomination members driven off by the
fundamentalist movement. Already, he says, some independent
fundamentalist churches have expressed interest in joining
the South Baptist denomination. "Sooner or later, you're
going to have an awakening, or a revival, and we're going to
take off again," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Pressler adds that the takeoff is fast approaching,
since fundamentalists now are close to controlling just about
every Southern Baptist institution. He vows, "When
conservative, grass-roots Southern Baptists have complete
confidence in their institutions, then they will open their
pocketbooks."</p>
