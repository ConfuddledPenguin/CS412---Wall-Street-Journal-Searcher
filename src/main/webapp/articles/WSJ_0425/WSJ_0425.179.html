	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it will
review for possible downgrades its triple-A ratings on
long-term deposits and senior debt of Fuji Bank Ltd. and
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., and senior debt of their units.
   But the rating concern said downgrades, if any, aren't
likely to be substantial for either bank; their short-term
prime-1 ratings aren't affected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Fuji remains a formidable and well-managed bank," Moody's
said, but cited "Fuji's tolerance for interest-rate risk, the
bank's real estate-related exposures, which are among the
largest of Japan's top city banks, and Fuji's
disproportionate exposure to highly leveraged transactions in
the U.S." It said the "review will focus on the factors
contributing to Fuji's deteriorating operating performance,
as well as examine in more detail the bank's exposure to
riskier borrowers." Fuji had nonconsolidated assets of 55.7
trillion yen ($353.31 billion) last Sept. 30, Moody's said.</p>
<p>Regarding Dai-Ichi, about $1.4 billion in long-term debt
is affected by Moody's review. Dai-Ichi's "overhead ratio is
chronically the highest among its peers, making the bank more
vulnerable to an earnings squeeze when rapidly rising
interest rates narrow the bank's margins," Moody's said;
also, "the bank's real estate-related loans have expanded
faster than those of its peers."</p>
<p>Moody's said it will focus on Dai-Ichi's efforts to
improve operating efficiency under rising interest rates and
its exposure to real estate lending. Though Moody's regards
the bank's risk level to have increased somewhat, it said it
believes Dai-Ichi retains its solid domestic franchise and
customer loyalty.</p>
