	<p class="article-leader">WEYENBERG SHOE MANUFACTURING Co. declared a 2-for-1 stock
split and raised its quarterly 20%. The Milwaukee shoe
concern increased its dividend to 15 cents a share from 12.5
cents, on a postsplit basis. Both the split and dividend are
payable July 2 to stock of record June 1. The company has
about 822,158 common shares outstanding. Separately,
shareholders at the annual meeting approved an amendment that
changes the name of the company to Weyco Group Inc. A
spokesman said the old name doesn't reflect its current
business, which involves "less manufacturing and more
importing" of shoes.</p>
