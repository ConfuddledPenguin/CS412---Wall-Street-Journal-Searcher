	<p class="article-leader">OPA LOCKA, Fla. -- State agriculture officials said they
plan to begin spraying parts of south Florida to combat a
possible infestation of Mediterranean fruit flies.
   Officials said yesterday that they had discovered a fifth
Medfly in Dade County. The first fly was discovered about a
week ago. The flies are a potentially serious threat to the
state's extensive citrus crops.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The state plans to fight the flies in two ways: aerial
spraying of malathion and the release of millions of sterile
flies. The sterile flies mate with the wild Medflies to
produce non-fertile eggs.</p>
<p>While discussing the sprayings, Doyle Conner, the state's
commissioner of agriculture, said, "In spite of the recent
adverse publicity in California, there is overwhelming
scientific evidence that aerial application of malathion
doesn't pose any significant public health concern."</p>
<p>Officials said they will widely publicize dates and times
of the sprayings.</p>
