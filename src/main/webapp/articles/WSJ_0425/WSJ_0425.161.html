	<p class="article-leader">Tambrands Inc., Lake Success, N.Y., reported that net
income rose 22% for the first quarter, fueled by strong
shipments of tampons in the U.S.
   The company earned $22.1 million, or $1.02 a share,
compared with $18 million, or 81 cents a share, in the
year-earlier quarter. Revenue increased 23% to $159.3 million
from $129.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said the unexpected steep increase in revenue was
magnified by weak revenue last year. A 9% decline in research
and development expenditures, coupled with a 13% drop in
general and administrative costs, helped fuel earnings
growth.</p>
<p>The percentage increase in per-share earnings exceeded the
percentage increase in net income because Tambrands has
repurchased its own shares since the first quarter of last
year.</p>
<p>In New York Stock exchange composite trading, Tambrands
closed at $76.125 a share, down 12.5 cents.</p>
