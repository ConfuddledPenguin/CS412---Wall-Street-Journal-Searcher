	<p class="article-leader">A federal grand jury in Fargo, N.D., has indicted a man
accused of originating a scheme to botch up the Internal
Revenue Service by filing false reports of income paid to
others.
   The indictment issued last week in Fargo charges that
Roger N. Elvick, 53 years old, of Moorhead, Minn., "concocted
and promoted" the scheme to impede the IRS and harass other
persons and conspired with other defendants to market the
scheme by selling written material and audio and video tapes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Wall Street Journal reported in a front-page article
last week that the IRS was pursuing 40 criminal
investigations into such subtly disruptive activities in
unidentified locales around the country.</p>
<p>In the only previous indictment, six New Mexico tax
protesters were charged by a federal grand jury in
Albuquerque in February with filing 49 fraudulent Form 1099s
naming public officials and others as the recipients of
millions of dollars of nonwage income.</p>
<p>A taxpayer's failure to declare income reported by third
parties to the IRS on 1099s may lead to an audit. One
apparent purpose of the falsified forms is to provoke
needless audits that could be costly and time-consuming for
the targets and for the IRS.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Gary Annear in Fargo said the IRS
has uncovered over 2,600 phony 1099s filed by 193 people in
27 states purporting to have made payments totaling more than
$11.1 billion. Mr. Annear says his office believes it can
prove that Mr. Elvick originated the scheme.</p>
<p>Mr. Elvick was in custody in Austin, Texas, on other
federal charges before the Fargo indictment, Mr. Annear adds.</p>
<p>IRS investigators found videocassettes explaining the
scheme in the Farmington, N.M., office of two of the
defendants under arrest in New Mexico, but the investigators
haven't disclosed the source of those cassettes.</p>
<p>In Washington, the IRS director of public affairs, Ellen
Murphy, said the indictment is "an important case." But while
the 40 investigations around the country have "a common
theme" involving fraudulent 1099s, she adds, the IRS so far
doesn't have information that the incidents are otherwise
related to each other.</p>
<p>Besides Mr. Elvick, the Fargo grand jury indicted Ronald
W. Knutt, 47, of Rocklake, N.D.; Thomas D. Porter, 49, of
Cando, N.D., and Natalie C. Telemaque, 33, of Glendale, Ariz.
The 19 counts include conspiracy to defraud the U.S. and
filing false 1099s and tax returns with the IRS.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges that the four had other purposes
besides harassing the IRS and "any person whom defendants
felt had wronged them." It charges that phony 1099s were one
link in a chain of arcane devices meant to culminate in
fraudulent tax refunds and other payments to the defendants
by the IRS.</p>
<p>Three defendants even applied to the IRS for rewards for
tipping it off to alleged tax violators, the indictment says.
And, it continues, one possessed forged documents purporting
to be drafts payable through IRS Commissioner Fred T.
Goldberg Jr. to enable people to collect from the IRS.</p>
