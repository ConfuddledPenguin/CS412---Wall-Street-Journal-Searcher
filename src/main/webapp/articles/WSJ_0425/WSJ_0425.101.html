	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Four executives at Novell Inc. sold more than
$8 million of company stock in the month before the price
plummeted on news of a proposed merger with Lotus Development
Corp., filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
show.
   Raymond J. Noorda, chairman, sold $6.6 million of the
software maker's shares on March 19 and March 20, according
to the filings. The 153,000 shares, which were sold at an
average price of $43.01 a share, represented 4% of his
holdings in the Provo, Utah, company, the filings show.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Three other Novell insiders sold an additional 38,995
shares between March 13 and March 30, according to the
filings.</p>
<p>Novell announced plans to merge with Lotus on April 5. The
stock fell $4.125 in one day, to $38.75. It continues to
hover near that level, closing yesterday at $37.75, down 50
cents, in over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Noorda was unavailable for comment. But David
Bradford, the company's general counsel, said that when the
executives sold the shares, the merger "wasn't even a glimmer
in anyone's eye." Mr. Bradford, who sold 6,250 shares, 87% of
his Novell holdings, in March, added: "We we're hoping the
stock would go up," on the news.</p>
<p>In general, Wall Street analysts did view the merger
positively, arguing that if the two companies successfully
merge, it could prove a formidable challenge to the industry
dominance of Microsoft Corp. But investors -- worried that
the merger may prove difficult, and disappointed that Novell
holders don't get a premium under its proposed terms --
showed their displeasure.</p>
<p>According to Peter Troop, head of investor relations at
the company, the announcement triggered a drop because Wall
Street is "choosing to see it (the merger) as a sale." Under
a letter of intent signed by the companies, Lotus will issue
1,19131 Lotus common shares for each Novell common share.
Negotiations for the merger continue, he said, although a
shareholders' lawsuit has been filed to block it, a suit the
company contends is "without merit."</p>
<p>The two other Novell executives who sold shares, one of
whom has since left the company, were unavailable for
comment. Kanwal Rekhi, executive vice president of product
development, sold 1,745 shares, retaining 135,648 shares,
according to SEC filings. Ronald Eliason, formerly executive
vice president and treasurer, sold all his holdings, 31,000
shares, for about $1.4 million. Their shares fetched prices
ranging from $41.75 to $44.13 a share.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>DROP IN THE BUCKET: Sam Walton, chairman of Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and one of the world's richest individuals, sold
$1.9 million of the company's stock on March 19, SEC filings
show.</p>
<p>But while the 40,920 shares he sold would be a lot for
most people, Mr. Walton retains over 218 million shares in
the company.</p>
<p>The shares sold for $46.81 a share, compared with the
company's closing level yesterday of $48.25, down 37.5 cents
in New York Stock Exchange Composite trading.</p>
<p>Also selling Wal-Mart shares in March were the company's
chief operating officer and a director, each selling small
portions of their Wal-Mart stakes, SEC filings show. In a
transaction related to an earlier exercise of options, Donald
G. Soderquist, the chief operating officer, sold 25,000
shares for $1.2 million, or 5% of his holdings. Jack C.
Shewmaker sold 15,000 shares for $68,000, representing 2% of
his stake. Their shares fetched prices ranging from $44.50 to
$47.50, according to the SEC filings.</p>
<p>Mr. Soderquist declined to comment, while Mr. Walton and
Mr. Shewmaker weren't available. The company declined to
comment or to confirm the SEC data.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>BUSY SIGNAL: Two brothers of McCaw Cellular Communications
Inc. Chairman Craig McCaw sold almost $20 million of the
company's stock, a month after its acquisition of LIN
Broadcasting, according to SEC filings. As shown on the
accompanying Insider Trading Spotlight, the two sold 625,367
shares in the Kirkland, Wash., cellular-phone-service company
on April 6.</p>
<p>Since then, the price of McCaw Cellular's stock has fallen
18% in over-the-counter trading. The insiders sold at $31.25
a share, the filings show. The stock closed yesterday at
$25.75, down 75 cents.</p>
<p>The brothers -- John E. McCaw Jr., executive vice
president of acquisitions, and Bruce McCaw, a director --
declined to comment.</p>
<p>But a company spokesman noted that McCaw took on a great
deal of debt as part of the LIN Broadcasting acquisition,
which was completed March 5. The decline in the price of the
stock has been part of "the market's disenchantment with
leveraged companies," he said. He added that the sales were
part of a prearranged private sale of a stake in McCaw to the
BT USA subsidiary of British Telecommunications PLC.</p>
<p>John McCaw sold 469,025 shares, retaining a stake of 4,500
Class A common shares and 890,016 Class B common shares, SEC
filings show. Bruce McCaw sold 156,342 Class A shares,
virtually all his Class A holdings, but retains almost 12
million Class B common shares, according to the filings.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>MCCAW CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS Inc. said John E. McCaw Jr.,
executive vice president of acquisitions, has 12,238,249
shares of the company's Class B common stock. His Class B
holding was misstated in yesterday's edition because of an
error by Invest/Net, a company that tracks filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The incorrect figure was
confirmed by a McCaw spokesman prior to publication, and Mr.
McCaw had declined to comment.</p>
