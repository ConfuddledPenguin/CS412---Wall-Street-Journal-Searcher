	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Sales of domestically built cars and trucks
plunged 17.7% in mid-April as auto makers posted another
disappointing performance during what should be the heart of
the spring selling season.
   "There's only one word to describe it: tough," said Clay
Lowenfield, general sales manager of a Ford and a Nissan
dealership in El Paso, Texas. Both dealerships saw sales drop
about 25% from year-earlier levels, he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Overall, the 10 companies that build vehicles in the U.S.
sold 306,637 cars, trucks and vans in the April 11-20 period,
down from 372,419 a year earlier. Sales of domestically made
cars fell 19.1% from year-earlier levels, pulling the
seasonally adjusted annual selling pace for the mid-April
period down to 6.6 million cars from a robust 7.9 million
selling rate in mid-April of 1989.</p>
<p>The Big Three U.S. auto makers all suffered sharp declines
in car and truck sales. The worst numbers came from Chrysler
Corp., which had a 38.8% drop in total vehicle sales. General
Motors Corp.'s total car and truck sales fell 15.5% during
the latest 10 days, while Ford Motor Co.'s car and light
truck sales skidded 19.3%.</p>
<p>Among Japanese car makers, however, all but one boosted
sales of domestically built vehicles over year-earlier
levels, although that was in part because they are building
more cars in the U.S. than a year earlier. The exception was
Mazda Motor Corp., which saw sales of its two domestically
built vehicles slump 55.7% after consumer incentives expired
April 10.</p>
<p>Chrysler has been struggling since the end of January,
when it halted a first-time $1,000 rebate offer on its
best-selling minivans. That offer sparked record January
sales for the auto maker. But Chrysler has suffered
double-digit sales declines in almost every 10-day sales
period since then. For mid-April, the No. 3 U.S. auto maker's
domestic truck and van sales fell 33.9% from a year earlier.
That compares with a 15.1% decline in overall domestic truck
sales during the mid-April period. Sales of domestically made
Chrysler cars tumbled 38.4% in the period.</p>
<p>To stop the slide, Chrysler has reintroduced the sort of
cut-rate financing offers that helped to boost sales a year
ago. Chrysler announced Saturday that it will offer
interest-free loans for as much as two years on many of its
vehicles.</p>
<p>"The last time that happened, we had people standing in
line to buy cars and trucks," said Donald Warnock, who owns a
Chrysler and a Dodge dealership in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Chrysler stock was one of the most active in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, with almost 1.1
million shares changing hands. It closed at $15.875,
unchanged.</p>
<p>At Ford Motor, sales of domestically built cars were down
22.7%, while sales of domestic trucks fell 13.1%. Ford
dealers said they expect the new Escort subcompact, which
goes on sale this week, to help the No. 2 auto maker bolster
its market share. "I'm looking for that to give us a real
shot in the arm," said Fred Ricart, owner of Ricart Ford in
Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>General Motors, meanwhile, outperformed Ford and the
overall market. The No. 1 auto maker's domestic car sales
dropped 18.9%, less than the overall drop in domestic car
sales. GM's domestic truck sales fell 9.6%, but that was
considerably better than the performance of the total
domestic truck market.</p>
<p>The major Japanese car makers, however, did much better.
Toyota Motor Corp., which has been boosting its U.S. output,
posted a 55.3% increase in sales of its domestically produced
cars. Nissan Motor Corp. boosted sales of its U.S.-built cars
and compact trucks 31.5% in the period.</p>
<p>Honda Motor Co. posted a 6.7% gain in sales of its
domestic car models. Sales of Mitsubishi Motor Corp.'s
U.S.-made cars rose 63.8%. A year earlier, Mitsubishi was
still boosting production at the Illinois factory it operates
in a joint venture with Chrysler.</p>
