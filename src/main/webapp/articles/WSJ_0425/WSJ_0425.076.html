	<p class="article-leader">Ames Department Stores Inc.'s stock and bonds tumbled
further yesterday, amid growing speculation that the troubled
discount department store chain could soon seek shelter from
its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code.
   Speculation was fueled by a report that the cash-strapped
chain has hired the New York law firm of Skadden Arps Slate
Meagher & Flom to prepare papers for a possible Chapter 11
filing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Skadden Arps spokesman confirmed the firm had been
retained by Ames "to explore various restructuring
alternatives." But he declined to say specifically if Ames
was planning to file for bankruptcy-law protection. The
hiring of Skadden Arps was initially reported in the Hartford
(Conn.) Courant.</p>
<p>Ames shares closed at $1.375, down 62.5 cents, in heavy
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The
company's 7 1/2% subordinated convertible debentures, which
had been trading over $50 for each $100 face value as
recently as mid-March, fell to $10.75 from $14.25.</p>
<p>Ames officials didn't return phone calls seeking comment.</p>
<p>The future of Ames, based in Rocky Hill, Conn., has been
in question since the company reported earlier this month
that it expects to report a $228 million loss for the year
ended Jan. 27 because of problems with the Zayre discount
chain it acquired two years ago. The company said it plans to
close 74 of its 680 stores because of the problems, and is
negotiating with its banks for a new credit agreement.</p>
<p>Whether or not Ames decides to make a bankruptcy-court
filing, hiring a bankruptcy specialist could help current
negotiations with its bankers. "It's a way of saying, `We're
going to pull the trigger unless you, the lenders, go along
with us,'" said Howard Davidowitz, a retail and financial
consultant in New York.</p>
<p>He added: "The big question stalling those negotiations is
who gets the money from the disposition of those {74} stores.
Naturally the banks want it," he added, noting that Ames
already has violated certain conditions set by its lenders.</p>
<p>Last week, Ames announced that it had been granted one
waiver and that it was requesting a further waiver from
Citibank, the lead bank in a group of approximately 20
institutions.</p>
<p>Because of its financial problems, Ames hasn't paid a
number of retailers for recent shipments of merchandise,
retailers say. Unable to reach the company by telephone,
several retailers have visited officials in person at the
company headquarters. But they were told by the company that
the banks have ordered a hold of payment to vendors.</p>
<p>Some, however, don't believe that Ames is about to throw
in the towel. "I doubt if they're going to declare
bankruptcy," noted Kurt Barnard, a New York publisher of a
retail newsletter. "Over half the stores, the Ames stores,
are doing well," he said. "Before filing {for bankruptcy
protection} they could just get rid of the Zayre chain
altogether."</p>
