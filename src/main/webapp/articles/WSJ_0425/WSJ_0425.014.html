	<p class="article-leader">RJR Nabisco Inc. reported a loss of $222 million for the
first quarter because of massive debt expenses, but the food
and tobacco company showed strong gains in operating profit
and cash flow.
   RJR, taken private last year in a $25 billion leveraged
buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., reported brisk
growth in cigarette revenue, mostly because of price
increases and cuts in overhead costs. Most importantly, RJR's
debt coverage -- its cash flow as a percentage of total
interest obligations -- reached 1.14 in the quarter, up from
1.04 three months earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"That's pretty good for a first-year LBO of that size,"
said Sam DeRosa-Farag, a bond analyst with First Boston Corp.
"That's the beauty" of taking a tobacco company private
through an LBO: "They're cash cows."</p>
<p>RJR revenue jumped 9.5% to $3.2 billion from $2.93
billion. The growth was paced by a 15% increase in tobacco
revenue, to $1.86 billion from $1.62 billion. Revenue from
food grew 3% to $1.34 billion from $1.31 billion, which
includes several units that have been divested in the past
year.</p>
<p>Louis V. Gerstner Jr., RJR's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the New York company's results benefited from
RJR's decision last year to end the practice called trade
loading, whereby the company built up huge excess inventories
among its cigarette distributors. In past years, RJR's heavy
fourth-quarter trade loads had the effect of artificially
depressing first-quarter tobacco shipments by swamping
distributors shelves, thus making shipments in this year's
first quarter seem unusually strong by comparison.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless," said Mr. Gerstner, "these results also
reflect strong fundamentals, and there is a growing sense of
momentum in the company."</p>
<p>That momentum may have been reflected lately in the
steadily rising price of RJR's publicly traded bonds. RJR's
two most widely held debentures, the 13.71% pay-in-kind debt
due 2009 and the pay-in-kind debt due 2007, have rallied
several points in the past month, on the strength of
analysts' high expectations for the company's operations and
persistent rumors that RJR may soon buy the bonds back, or
offer some other type of exchange for the debt.</p>
<p>Covenants require RJR to reset the bonds' interest rates
by a year from now so they trade at par, a requirement that
many analysts agree would be prohibitively expensive at
current prices.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 13.71% pay-in-kind debentures due 2009 rose
5/8, or $6.25 for a bond with $1,000 face amount, to close at
81 5/8, on the New York Stock Exchange, while RJR's
pay-in-kind debentures due 2007 rose 3/4 to 68 1/8.</p>
<p>"They've still got a long way to go," said Alan Snyder of
San Francisco-based Snyder Capital Management, an
investment-management firm that holds some RJR bonds. The
bond prices "are still about 30% or so from where they've got
to be to reset" interest rates.</p>
<p>Karl von der Heyden, RJR's chief financial officer,
wouldn't comment on what RJR may do to address the reset
requirement, except to say, "We're always looking at all the
options."</p>
<p>RJR said operating profit in the first quarter jumped 50%
to $602 million from $402 million. The company's operating
profit from tobacco rose 40% to $637 million from $453
million. Operating profit from food rose 18% to $141 million
from $119 million.</p>
<p>Much of RJR's first-quarter growth in operating profit
came from slashing costs, analysts and RJR executives said.
In the past year, for example, the company has cut its
headquarters work force by more than half, said Mr. von der
Heyden, to fewer than 300 employees from more than 650. In
the first quarter, the cost of maintaining the head office
fell to $24 million from $46 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. von der Heyden said RJR's expenditures on
advertising and marketing rose more than 10% in the period to
more than $700 million. He added, however, that U.S.
consumption of RJR cigarettes fell 3% in the quarter,
continuing a worrisome trend for the No. 2 U.S. cigarette
maker.</p>
