	<p class="article-leader">International Business Machines Corp. will introduce
several models of a low-cost home computer early this summer,
signaling a splashy new assault on a market in which it has
failed in the past, industry executives said.
   The executives said the new machines will avoid most of
IBM's previous missteps: They will run popular software and
will be reasonably powerful, easy to use and priced
aggressively -- between $1,000 and $2,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Still, going after the home market is a gamble for the
Armonk, N.Y.-based computer giant. As IBM discovered to its
embarrassment in 1984 and 1985, when its PCjr home computer
was met with widespread ridicule, home users are a demanding
bunch. They're also very price-sensitive, making the formula
for a success particularly hard to find.</p>
<p>IBM is taking another gamble, as well, the executives
added. In an expansion of a trial program, IBM will sell the
computers through high-profile department stores such as R.H.
Macy & Co. and Sears, Roebuck & Co., they said. That could
well help reach customers who don't regularly visit computer
stores. At the same time, IBM needs to be careful not to
alienate its existing network of dealers, whose good
relations with IBM over the past year and a half have
contributed to IBM's gains in the personal-computer market.</p>
<p>An IBM spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports,
saying the company doesn't talk about products before they
are announced. But IBM executives have hinted around such a
move for months, and vice president James Cannavino issued a
statement yesterday that emphasized IBM's current presence in
the marketplace and said IBM is "working hard to satisfy
(home computing) needs with highly competitive products."</p>
<p>While IBM has had some success with computers on the low
end of its Personal System/2 line, the home market is
dominated by makers of IBM "clones" such as Packard Bell Inc.
and Epson America Inc., and by home-computer specialist
Commodore International Ltd.</p>
<p>The size of the market is hard to quantify, because any
personal computer can be used at home. International Data
Corp., a market research firm in Framingham, Mass., estimates
that U.S. sales of "homehobby" computers -- a definition that
excludes machines used mostly for business -- will reach $975
million, or 1.1 million units, in 1990. That's a very small
slice of the total $28 billion, 9.8 million-unit market for
personal computers in the U.S.</p>
<p>Slicing the data another way, Personal Technology Research
of Waltham, Mass., says $3.8 billion of computers, or 5.5
million units, will be sold during 1990 through electronics
stores that don't specialize in computers. That's how most
people buy home computers, whether they're for personal or
business use, says PTR general manager Casey Dworkin.</p>
<p>In any case, analysts said, several trends in the market
are evident. Machines are getting more powerful, and the
ability to run heavy-duty business applications is key.</p>
<p>"We aren't looking at the toy most people were buying five
or six years ago," said Mr. Dworkin. "People want to be able
to bring work home." A $1,000 entry-level price also appears
to be important, and ease-of-use has emerged as a major
selling point.</p>
<p>IBM's new offerings will apparently address all these
points. But company executives have indicated that they don't
just want to grab a share of an existing marketplace: They
want to create a whole new class of customers.</p>
<p>"New users -- people who've never seen computer outside of
a video arcade -- make up most of our potential market," Mr.
Cannavino, the IBM vice president, told analysts recently.</p>
<p>Mr. Cannavino, who heads IBM's personal systems business,
is shaping up as a cheerleader for home computers. He has
told many people that he sees the nation's 90 million
households as a tempting target, and talks of "a computer in
every kitchen."</p>
<p>This vision -- the computer as household appliance --
means that IBM will likely have to market its home computers
a lot differently than its other personal computers, which
are sold mostly through authorized computer stores. Industry
executives said the company is lining up department stores
that will sell the machines in much the same way they sell
televisions or microwave ovens.</p>
<p>The executives said the new machines will be based on
Intel Corp.'s 80286 microprocessor, which also serves as the
heart of IBM's low-end Model 25 and 30 personal computers.
They will also include a 30-megabyte hard-disk drive, a 3
1/2-inch floppy-disk drive, 640 kilobytes of internal memory,
a mouse, and easy-to-use software that will allow users to
start working as soon as the computer is turned on. Some
models will offer an internal modem, allowing the computer to
communicate across telephone lines.</p>
