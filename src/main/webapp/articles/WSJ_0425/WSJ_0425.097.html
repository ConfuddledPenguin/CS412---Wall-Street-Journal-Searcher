	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Private industry's labor costs rose 1.6% in
the first quarter, the government said, accelerating from a
1.1% rise in the fourth period and a 1.2% increase in 1989's
first quarter.
   The increases were propelled by benefit increases,
including a rise in the Social Security taxes paid by
employers, the Labor Department said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's not an explosion but it's steady pressure," said
Audrey Freedman, a labor economist at the Conference Board, a
business research organization. Many economists see the
labor-cost figure as an important indicator of inflation,
because salaries and benefits are a large share of business
costs and ultimately must be reflected in prices.</p>
<p>In the 12 months ended in March, wages, salaries and
benefits for private sector employees increased 5.2%, the
biggest rise since they climbed 5.4% in the 12 months ended
June 1984. That figure was 4.8% for all 1989 and 4.6% in the
12 months ended in March of that year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a separate report, the Labor Department said
major collective-bargaining agreements settled in the first
quarter provided wage increases averaging 3.8% in the first
year and 3.3% a year over the life of the pacts.</p>
<p>Those figures were well above the ones in previous
contracts negotiated by the same parties. The previous
contracts, generally negotiated two or three years ago, paid
2.3% in the first year and 2.2% a year for the full term of
the contracts. The figures don't include benefits. Agreements
in the latest report covered 318,000 workers.</p>
<p>Increases in benefits made up most of the 5.2% increase in
total compensation for workers over the 12 months ended in
March. Benefit costs to employers rose 7.2% in that period,
up from a 5.4% rise in the year-earlier period. Wages and
salaries rose only 4.2%, the same increase registered for the
12 months ended March 1989.</p>
<p>White collar workers received wage and salary increases of
4.6% during the 12-month period, faring better than blue
collar workers, who posted gains of 3.7%. Labor costs
continued to increase more rapidly in services than in
goods-producing industries, though the difference was small
-- 4.2% versus 4%.</p>
<p>Including employees of state and local governments, but
not federal employees, the department's employment cost index
rose 1.7% in the first quarter, compared with a 1.2% rise in
the first quarter of 1989. The index rose 1% in last year's
fourth quarter.</p>
<p>In the 12 months ended in March, this index was up 5.5%.
It rose 5% for the full year 1989, and 4.8% in the 12 months
ended in March 1989.</p>
<p>Unlike most of the government's economic statistics, none
of these figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>
