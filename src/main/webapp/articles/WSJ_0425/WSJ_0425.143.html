	<p class="article-leader">MCI Communications Corp. said it received a non-exclusive,
three-year contract from American Express Co., in which the
Washington-based telecommunications company will provide a
full range of network services to the New York-based travel
and financial services concern's business units world-wide.
   The contract, valued at $60 million and guaranteed for
three years, is the largest that American Express has awarded
MCI since the two companies began working together in the
early 1970s. The contract has an option for an additional two
years, increasing its value to a potential $100 million, said
Bert C. Roberts Jr., MCI president and chief operating
officer.</p>
