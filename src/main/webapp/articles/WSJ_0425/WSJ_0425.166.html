	<p class="article-leader">Tucson Electric Power Co. said it had a loss of $14.8
million, or 68 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared
with net income of $20.4 million, or 75 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue fell to $120.9 million from $153.4 million.
   The Tucson, Ariz., utility attributed much of the setback
to an increase in interest expense, which totaled $30.6
million for the quarter. The company is negotiating a new
$350 million master credit agreement, which it now says it
hopes to have in place by mid-summer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The credit agreement, which the company earlier said it
hoped to arrange by April 30, would provide an additional $90
million in borrowing capacity.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Tucson's
stock closed at $11.25, unchanged.</p>
