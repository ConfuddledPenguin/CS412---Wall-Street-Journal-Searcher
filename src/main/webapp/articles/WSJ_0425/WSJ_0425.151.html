	<p class="article-leader">Citing competitive pricing pressures, Amdahl Corp. said
first-quarter earnings slipped 34% to $29.9 million, or 27
cents a share, from $45.6 million, or 42 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   Revenue increased nearly 8% to $506.8 million from $470.3
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Sunnyvale, Calif., computer vendor said earnings were
lower because of competitive pricing pressures that
accelerated soon after the first quarter of 1989 and because
of a shift in product mix since that time. The company, among
other computer manufacturers and vendors, has been hurt by
pricing pressures in a sluggish market.</p>
<p>Amdahl said in early 1989 the company's 5890 mainframes
constituted the majority of product shipments, but Amdahl is
now delivering more 5990 systems, which have higher average
selling prices but also higher manufacturing costs because of
more complex technology.</p>
