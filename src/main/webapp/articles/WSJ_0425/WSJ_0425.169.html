	<p class="article-leader">Image Bank Inc.'s shares lost a third of their value as
the New York stock-photography company restated fiscal
first-quarter per-share earnings downward to seven cents from
12 cents.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Image Bank
fell $2.75 to $5.25.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Image Bank, which licenses reproductive rights for
photographs, illustrations and cinematography, said the
restatement reflects the addition of $365,069 to the cost of
sales at a recently acquired U.K. subsidiary, Book People
Ltd. The costs stemmed from a failure to account for certain
purchase invoices for books that were part of the unit's
inventory, Image Bank said.</p>
<p>Revised net income for the first quarter ended Dec. 31 is
$261,079 compared with the $430,641 originally reported. For
the year-earlier fiscal first quarter, Image Bank reported
net income of $205,896, or nine cents a share. Shares
outstanding in the periods were 3.7 million and 2.2 million,
respectively.</p>
