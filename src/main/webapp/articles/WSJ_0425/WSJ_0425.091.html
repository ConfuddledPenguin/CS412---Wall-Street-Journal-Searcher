	<p class="article-leader">HAS THE IRS GROUNDED efforts to tax frequent-flier
benefits?
   Experts agree that free airline tickets earned with
credits for deductible business travel are personal income if
used for personal travel. But years after starting a
"project" to write rules for taxing the income, the IRS still
is stumped by these questions: what to tax, when to tax it,
how to value it, who (airline, company, or traveler) must
record and report it, and whether it is a nontaxable fringe
benefit for employees. Now the IRS has reclassified its
regulation-writing project as a "study."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That doesn't mean the chore is downgraded, a spokesman
says; it means the IRS needs to learn more about the rapidly
growing and changing programs. But, says Donald Alexander, a
Washington lawyer who represents the Air Transport
Association: "I'd be surprised if we heard from the IRS soon.
I think they are finding the game isn't worth the candle."
William Raby, editor of a newsletter on tax practice, says
many CPAs are concerned about the ethics of not reporting the
income on clients' returns.</p>
<p>Raby says he would raise an ethical question about the
IRS's "failure . . . to provide even one word of guidance."</p>
<p>JUDGES UP THE ANTE for taxpayers who gamble on frivolous
court tactics.</p>
<p>The 1982 tax act let the Tax Court order taxpayers to pay
damages of up to $5,000 for filing frivolous or delaying
suits. But the growing number of damage awards didn't seem to
be deterrent enough, so the 1989 tax act authorized the court
to impose a penalty of up to $25,000 for making groundless
arguments starting this year. Judges are beginning to apply
that heavier hand.</p>
<p>Robert J. Urwyler of Modesto, Calif., made frivolous tax
protests and failed twice to appear for trial; Special Judge
Galloway has ordered him to pay $7,000 on top of taxes and
other penalties. Judge Parr ordered Marjorie E. Brock,
Redding, Calif., to pay civil fraud penalties and $5,000 for
"obnoxious behavior" in 1989 and $10,000 for this year --
including failing to appear for trial.</p>
<p>SELF-EMPLOYERS may trim Social Security taxes a bit, with
some figuring.</p>
<p>Half of employees' Social Security tax is paid by
employers. But the self-employed nominally pay the full tax
-- in 1990, 15.3% of the first $51,300 of self-employment
earnings. Still, new two-step rules will let them lower the
rate, says Peter Elinsky of Peat Marwick, CPAs. First, before
figuring the self-employment Social Security tax, they may
deduct from earnings a sum equal to the earnings times half
the tax rate; the full rate then is levied on the balance.
Thus, Elinsky says, the maximum tax of $7,848.90 applies to
earnings of $55,550 or more; for lower earnings, the tax is
less.</p>
<p>Step No. 2 comes when a self-employer files an income-tax
return: On it, he may deduct half of the Social Security tax
actually paid. Someone in the 28% income-tax bracket thus
pays an effective Social Security rate of 12.15%, not 15.3%,
on earnings of $55,550 or less, Elinsky says. Employees pay
Social Security tax at a 7.65% rate.</p>
<p>Reducing self-employment-tax payments may result in lower
Social Security benefits later, Elinsky adds.</p>
<p>REAL-ESTATE transaction reporting would be widened broadly
in 1991 by proposed IRS rules to cover land and all
residential, industrial, and commercial buildings. The IRS
plans a hearing Sept. 24. Reporting now is required for
one-to-four-family residential properties.</p>
<p>PERSONAL-SERVICE concerns owned at least 95% by present
and past employees pay a flat 34% tax, not the regular
graduated corporate rates on income up to $75,000. The IRS
says it is screening such companies' returns, because many
have computed their taxes at the lower graduated rates.</p>
<p>TAXPAYERS' RIGHTS should be expanded, says Sen. Armstrong
(R., Colo.). He has entered five bills to broaden rights to
recover costs from the IRS and to sue it, to equalize the
interest rates on overdue taxes and refunds, and to protect
confidential communications with tax advisers.</p>
<p>WORKING COUPLES must watch for underwithholding, tax
advisers say.</p>
<p>So it's time to review Form W-4s, adds the California
Society of Enrolled Agents, who are licensed advisers. IRS
withholding tables for couples filing jointly assume only one
spouse works, and the society describes this potential
problem: John and Jo earn $2,000 a month each and don't
itemize deductions. On W-4s, they list themselves as married
but claim no dependents, to maximize withholding; their
employers withhold $261 a month each, or a total of $522.</p>
<p>The couple also have $2,000 of interest income. Doing
their 1990 return, they find they owe $844 more in tax. Yet
if Jo as the sole breadwinner earned the same total sum,
$4,000 a month, $695 would be withheld from her monthly
paycheck; and the couple would get a $1,232 refund. The
lesson for working couples: Be sure to use the nine-step
worksheet on the back of the W-4 to figure the right
withholding, the society says.</p>
<p>The effect of the withholding tables varies, but falls on
all working couples to some extent, the society says.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: Taxpayers Associations International -- joining
groups striving to restrain taxes in 15 nations -- plans its
first meeting in July, aboard the Cinderella sailing from
Stockholm to Helsinki. . . . Missouri Sens. Danforth and Bond
propose to amend the Constitution to bar federal judges from
imposing state taxes. They would overturn the Supreme Court's
ruling in the Kansas City, Mo., school-desegregation case.</p>
