	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Crude-oil imports to Japan in March rose at an
annual rate of 3.8% to 123.1 million barrels, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said.
   The imports also rose 1.5% from February.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Oil-products sales in March fell 1% to 126.4 million
barrels, compared with a year earlier. Inventories rose 6.6%
to 71 million barrels, and production increased 7.9% to 101.6
million barrels.</p>
<p>The effect of Japan's unusually warm winter could be seen
in kerosene sales, which fell 14% from March 1989 levels to
18.8 million barrels.</p>
<p>Vehicle fuels showed the best sales increase in the month,
up 5.4% at 23.6 million barrels. Sales of naphtha and gasoil
each rose 4.9%. Sales of other products, including fuel oil
and jet fuel, declined.</p>
<p>Product exports from Japan continued to climb in March, as
the government held to its refinery liberalization policy.
These exports more than tripled to 3.4 million barrels.</p>
