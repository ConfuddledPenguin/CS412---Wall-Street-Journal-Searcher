	<p class="article-leader">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Undercutting a rosier government
forecast, the Malaysian Institute of Economic Research
predicted the nation's gross domestic product will grow 7.8%
in 1990 but the government-assisted, structurally independent
institute cautioned that building inflation will force
long-term interest rates higher.
   The assessment jibes more closely with the views of
private analysts and economists than Bank Negara's annual
report released in March. The institute's GDP forecast also
represents a substantial deceleration from the 8.5% rate in
1989 and is more modest than the central bank's forecast of
8.3%. It estimated the inflation rate this year will hit 5%,
exceeding Bank Negara's forecast of a 4% rise in the consumer
price index, and topping by far the 1989 increase of 2.8%.</p>
