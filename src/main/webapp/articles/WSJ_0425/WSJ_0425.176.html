	<p class="article-leader">ST.LOUIS -- Monsanto Co. said first-quarter profit fell
13% from a year-ago, to $194 million, or $2.95 a share.
   The report had been expected since last month, when the
company said it expected lower corporate profit because of
profit declines in its core chemical businesses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A year earlier, Monsanto earned $222 million, or $3.24 a
share. Sales in the latest quarter were $2.29 billion, up 1%,
from $2.27 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>In the crop chemicals unit, pretax profit fell to $151
million, from the record $184 million of last year. The
company said many shipments of its Lasso herbicide were
delayed until the second quarter because of changes in
farmers' purchasing patterns. In addition, the company said,
the sales mix of its Roundup herbicides tilted toward the
lower-priced formulations during the latest quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts have said that, because the timing of
crop-chemical purchases varies, results for the first six
months are a better indicator of how the business is doing
than are results for the first quarter. Richard Mahoney,
Monsanto's chairman and chief executive officer, said the
company still expects profit from the crop-chemicals business
in 1990 to exceed last year's, given "reasonable weather."</p>
<p>In the other chief chemicals unit, whose products include
plastic for shatterproof windshields, pretax profit dropped
to $119 million, from $130 million. Monsanto attributed the
decline to lower production in the auto industry.</p>
<p>The other profit decline within Monsanto came in its
NutraSweet Co. unit, which had pretax profit of $67 million,
down from a record $74 million a year ago. In the G.D. Searle
& Co. unit, pretax profit was $4 million, against a loss of
$8 million a year ago.</p>
