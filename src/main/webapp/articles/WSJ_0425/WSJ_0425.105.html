	<p class="article-leader">Roche Holding AG, a large Swiss chemical and
pharmaceutical concern, said its 1989 consolidated profit
surged 33% to 852 million Swiss francs ($570.4 million) from
642 million francs in 1988, on a previously reported 21% jump
in sales to 9.81 billion francs from 8.14 billion francs.
   Roche cited robust sales growth, a favorable economic
environment, the relative weakness of the Swiss franc and
"liquid fund investments."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it will propose a dividend of 38 francs a
share on 1989's results, or a total of 157 million francs,
compared with 118 million francs paid out on 1988's results.
The proposed payout can't be compared directly with that for
1988 because of a 1989 capital restructuring, Roche said.</p>
<p>Cash flow, a barometer of a Swiss company's performance,
jumped 23% in 1989 to 1.45 billion francs, or 15% of sales.
Research and development spending totaled 1.42 billion
francs, or about 14% of sales. Pharmaceuticals accounted for
about 45% of 1989 sales; vitamins and fine chemicals, 25%;
diagnostics, 14%; fragrances and flavors, 11%; and plant
protection, 5%.</p>
