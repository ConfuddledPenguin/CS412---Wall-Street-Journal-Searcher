	<p class="article-leader">WALTHAM, Mass. -- Thermo Instrument Systems Inc. said it
agreed to acquire Finnigan Corp. for $20 a share or $110
million to $120 million.
   Finnigan, which Thermo called the world's largest maker of
mass spectrometers, has been unprofitable in the face of
competitive pricing pressures. In over-the-counter trading
yesterday, Finnigan surged $4.50 to $18.75. Thermo
Instrument, an 80%-owned subsidiary of Thermo Electron Corp.,
rose 12.5 cents to $14.375. Thermo Instrument makes
instruments for environmental testing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the first quarter, Finnigan, San Jose, Calif., had a
net loss of $1.1 million, or 20 cents a share, on sales of
$30.3 million.</p>
<p>Arvin Smith, president of Thermo Instrument, said that for
the first quarter his company expects to report net income
rose almost 30% to about $4.1 million, or 17 cents a share,
from a restated $3.2 million or 16 cents a share. The number
of shares outstanding increased to 24 million from a restated
19.7 million to reflect the conversion of debentures. Sales
rose 19% to about $49 million from a restated $41.2 million,
he said.</p>
<p>The Finnigan acquisition would be Thermo Instrument's
second consecutive purchase of a struggling company. In
January, Thermo Instrument completed the stock acquisition of
Thermo Environmental Corp., another Thermo Electron
affiliate.</p>
<p>Thermo Instrument's main business is making instruments
used to test and monitor air, water and nuclear pollution
sources. That business has been growing strongly as
corporations increasingly worry about toughened pollution
regulations. Thermo Environmental, whose sales account for
about 30% of the combined company, runs laboratories that
conduct such tests.</p>
<p>The Finnigan acquisition is subject to approval by each
board, execution of a definitive acquisition agreement, and
receipt of regulatory and other approvals.</p>
