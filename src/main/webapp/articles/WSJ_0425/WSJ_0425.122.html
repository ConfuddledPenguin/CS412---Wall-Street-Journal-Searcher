	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks regained some strength in the afternoon
Tuesday but still ended the day lower as the yen continued in
a downturn, chipping away at buying sentiment and dragging
down stock prices, traders said.
   Shares inched up in London but were down in most other
world markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At Tokyo, the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues, which
gave up 156.37 points Monday, bounced up from its morning
levels to close at 29501.38, down 177.69. The Nikkei's
intraday low was 29285.09.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index fell 42.15 to close
the morning session at 29459.23.</p>
<p>Tuesday's volume on the First Section was estimated at 480
million shares, an improvement from 330 million Monday.</p>
<p>Losers outnumbered winners, 645 to 310, while 147 issues
remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all issues
listed in the First Section, which fell 12.96 points Monday,
lost another 8.11 points, or 0.37%, to 2193.09.</p>
<p>The Second Section index, which retreated 12.35 points
Monday, fell back 23.59 points, or 0.66%, to close at
3526.26. Volume in the Second Section was 10 million shares,
down from 15 million Monday.</p>
<p>Stock prices had fallen on sell programs by major foreign
brokerage houses, followed by last-minute dealer selling, in
the morning. Selective buying of blue-chips and
domestic-demand-related issues by dealers and some
individuals helped keep prices from falling too far, however.</p>
<p>But in the afternoon session, several corporate news
reports moved the market, traders said.</p>
<p>Trading in shares of Suzuki Motor were suspended on all
Japanese markets to allow for fair trading, as the company
announced that it has jointly developed diagnosis devices
with a Dainippon Pharmaceutical subsidiary, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange said.</p>
<p>The blood-testing devices are to be used in diagnosing
victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, and
serum hepatitis.</p>
<p>While Suzuki Motor had moved only 10 yen (6.3 cents)
higher to 800 yen ($5.07) before trading in the stock was
suspended, Dainippon Pharmaceutical's shares soared 310 yen
to 2,850 on the news.</p>
<p>According to another local news report, Ricoh Co. invented
a neuro-IC, or integrated chip, which can learn and study
much like the human brain, traders said. The company's stock
jumped 200 to 1,300.</p>
<p>In addition, the market got a boost from non-life and life
insurance companies, which are said to be set to buy nearly
300 billion yen of stock, one trader at a foreign brokerage
firm said.</p>
<p>Although overall sentiment is clearly cautious with the
weaker yen and bond markets, especially ahead of the
holidays, factors behind daily movements are becoming
blurred, traders agreed.</p>
<p>The dollar broke above the 158-yen level Tuesday, up
sharply from 157.55 in both New York and Tokyo late Monday.</p>
<p>Tuesday's best-performing sectors included
pharmaceuticals, which are generally regarded as safe plays
during yen weakness because of high earnings growth forecasts
and unwavering demand.</p>
<p>Daiichi Pharmaceutical was up 50 to 2,590, Fujisawa added
40 to 2,040, Ono gained 140 to 5,970 and Taisho
Pharmaceutical rose 50 to 2,370.</p>
<p>London share prices staged a recovery late in the session
to finish mostly higher after a spate of gloomy corporate
news pressured individual stocks and dragged the market down
throughout most of the trading day.</p>
<p>Depressed prices lured both bears covering their short
positions and investors charting fresh territory into the
market, buoying share prices, traders said.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
up 0.7 point at 2159.9. The index fell as low as 2150.4
around midday, nearly breaching a psychological support level
of 2150.0 before rebounding. The intraday high of 2168.7 was
reached shortly after official trading commenced.</p>
<p>At its final tally, the narrower FT 30 share index was up
4.5 points at 1697.2. Volume was a light 372.9 million
shares, compared with 382.6 million Monday.</p>
<p>In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
finished at 2187, up from its close of 2181 Monday.</p>
<p>After a strong opening on the back of firmer stock-index
futures, shares were bumped lower on a bearish statement from
Midland Bank which said it expects the poor trading
conditions to continue and intensify.</p>
<p>The news sent bank shares tumbling and investors running
for cover. "Midland Bank's profit warning knocked the
stuffing out of the (market)," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Several banks, however, managed a smart recuperation in
brisk dealings later in the day, traders said. While Midland
fell 21 pence (34 cents) to 289 pence and Barclays lost 5 to
514, Lloyds managed to put on 7 to 262 and National
Westminster advanced 4 to 315.</p>
<p>In light of Midland's alarm signal, "the market has
actually performed very well," respecting the 2150.0 mark and
stirring buying interest, one trader said.</p>
<p>Additionally, early pressure was forced on the market by
news Monday that the Sir James Goldsmith-led consortium
Hoylake abandoned its nine-month battle for B.A.T Industries.
Shares in the tobacco and financial services conglomerate
plummeted 23 to 701.</p>
<p>But on the other side of the coin, shares in food group
Ranks Hovis McDougall climbed 12 to 387, as speculation
intensified that it might be an attractive substitute for
B.A.T, as Sunningdale Holdings, a consortium in which Mr.
Goldsmith participates, controls a near-30% stake in RHM.</p>
<p>In other takeover situations, shares in retailer
Kingfisher fell 9 to 280 as the market awaits a ruling by the
U.K. Monopolies and Mergers Commission about its bid for
electrical retailer Dixons. One trader suggested that
sentiment leaned towards the commission's allowing the
takeover to proceed, although Dixons might try to fetch a
higher price. Dixons climbed 4 to 120.</p>
<p>Elsewhere around the market, building materials group
Tarmac added 17 to 225 following news that its pretax profit
for 1989 declined just 4%, healthier than expectations.</p>
<p>Stocks closed higher in Paris, lower in Frankfurt, Zurich,
Brussels, Stockholm and Milan, and mixed in Amsterdam. South
African golds closed mixed.</p>
<p>Share prices closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong,
Wellington, Manila, Singapore and Seoul and were higher in
Taipei.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
