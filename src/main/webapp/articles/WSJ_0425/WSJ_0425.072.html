	<p class="article-leader">The nation's two biggest steelmakers, hurt by reduced
volume and pricing, posted sharply lower first-quarter
earnings.
   USX Corp. profits slid 41% to $176 million, or 66 cents a
share, from $296 million, or $1.09 a share, a year ago.
However, last year's results included $179 million in
one-time special items as well as a pretax gain of $74
million from the sale of assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At Bethlehem Steel Corp., the nation's No. 2 steelmaker,
earnings plunged 68% to $21 million, or 20 cents a share,
from $65 million, or 78 cents a share, a year ago. On an
operating basis, the fall was sharper because last year's
first quarter included a $55 million restructuring charge.</p>
<p>Still, some industry analysts were pleasantly surprised at
the earnings performance of both USX and Bethlehem and
believe a recent uptick in orders portends second-quarter
improvements.</p>
<p>"I'm surprised at how well they did," said John Jacobson,
an analyst with AUS Consultants. "Five or six years ago,
steelmakers' ability to adapt to lower pricing and somewhat
weaker demand wasn't nearly as good."</p>
<p>A year ago, the industry was enjoying relatively strong
demand and firm pricing. But business began dropping off in
the second half of 1989 as auto makers cut back on production
and world steel prices fell. Those trends continued into the
first quarter. Recently, though, business appears to have
strengthened.</p>
<p>In the recent quarter, USX's steel segment reported a 39%
drop in operating profit to $60 million from $99 million a
year ago. Sales dropped to $1.3 billion from $1.5 billion.
Both drops reflect lower steel prices and the sale of the
company's Lorain, Ohio, works to a joint venture with Kobe
Steel of Japan last year.</p>
<p>USX earned about $23 a ton of steel shipped, higher than
most analysts' projections of $15 to $18 a ton. Analyst John
Tumazos of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities believes
stronger orders in the last part of the quarter boosted
profit.</p>
<p>USX's performance was aided by Marathon Oil, which
benefited from higher crude oil prices. Marathon's operating
profit rose to $242 million from $241 million; the
year-earlier quarter included a $60 million gain related to
inventory valuation.</p>
<p>Texas Oil & Gas, which USX put on the block last year,
continued its disappointing performance. It reported a loss
of $5 million, compared with operating profit of $147 million
a year ago. Last year's quarterly results at the natural gas
unit included a $144 million gain from the settlement of
lawsuits.</p>
<p>Bethlehem's biggest problem, meanwhile, was in its basic
steel operations, where operating profit plummeted 79% to $29
million from $137 million a year ago. A key factor in the
segment's disappointing showing was a 19% drop in steel
shipments and lower operating rates. Bethlehem's operating
rates fell to 70% from 82%, giving it fewer tons to absorb
fixed-interest and labor costs.</p>
<p>At the same time, Bethlehem's operating costs were higher
because of a labor pact signed last year with United
Steelworkers of America, as well as outages at its blast
furnaces.</p>
<p>Losses at Bethlehem's steel-related operations narrowed
markedly to $4 million from $63 million a year ago, when the
company took a $55 million charge to shrink its Baltimore
Marine division.</p>
<p>Bethlehem said that as a result of recent order
improvements, the industry may ship more than the originally
expected 77 million tons this year. That would be lower,
however, than the 84 million tons shipped last year.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
USX shares closed at $32.75, down 25 cents, and Bethlehem
closed unchanged at $17.625.</p>
