	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Interest-rate concerns continued to take a
toll on the stock market, which matched its longest losing
streak of the year by falling for the fifth straight session.
   Stocks began the session by moving higher along with
bonds, but were unable to hold the gains after renewed
weakness developed in the bond market, sending rates higher.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which climbed more than
11 points shortly after the opening, closed at 2,654.50, down
12.17. The average had dropped five consecutive times in
January and again in February.</p>
<p>Among broader measures, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index
slipped 0.69 to 330.36 and the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index dropped 0.42 to 181.51.</p>
<p>Declining issues outnumbered advancers 833 to 652 on the
Big Board, where the pace of trading remained slow. Volume on
the Big Board was 137,360,000 shares, little changed from
Monday's total of 136,150,000.</p>
<p>Stocks posted their initial gains after the bond market
shrugged off a better-than-expected report on March orders
for durable goods, which rose 6.7%. At their session highs,
Treasury notes and bonds showed gains of as much as 1/2
point, or $5 per $1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>But when Treasury issues resumed their recent decline,
stock prices headed lower as well. At least four rounds of
futures-related program selling hit the market over the
course of the afternoon, traders said, with the worst damage
coming in the final hour of trading.</p>
<p>"People are continuing to focus on rates, the fact that
they're not moving lower," said Ronald B. Doran, head of
institutional trading at First Albany Corp. The yields on
Treasury issues increased as prices retreated; but at
closing, the issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>Although the market's latest sell-off was relatively
narrow by the standards of its latest losing streak -- more
than 1,000 issues finished lower on the Big Board in three
out of the five sessions -- some analysts said the downturn
has yet to produce the kind of technical readings that would
indicate the selling has become excessive.</p>
<p>"We're going to get to a point where you get people
starting to legitimately panic here. I don't think you're
there yet," said Edward P. Nicoski, managing director of
technical analysis at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood, Minneapolis.</p>
<p>But Mr. Nicoski noted that his firm's latest survey of 340
industry groups, finished Monday, showed that more than
one-quarter of the groups had dropped to 52-week lows while
none stood at 52-week highs. In addition, only 11% of those
sectors were above their moving average for the prior 40
weeks, a long-term performance measure.</p>
<p>Sears Roebuck tumbled 1 1/8 to 35 3/8, a 52-week low, in
the wake of its first-quarter earnings report. The company's
net income for the period fell 59% from the year-ago level;
its earnings per share of 31 cents was below analysts'
forecasts.</p>
<p>Conversely, a stronger-than-expected earnings report for
the first quarter sent Chevron rising 7/8 to 64 3/4. The
company reported a 51% rise in its net income.</p>
<p>Ames Department Stores, the Big Board's most active issue,
slid 5/8 to 1 3/8 on 3.7 million shares. The Hartford Courant
reported that the financially troubled retailer hired a
bankruptcy specialist with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom, a New York law firm, to begin preparing for a possible
Chapter 11 filing. TJX, which holds a major stake in Ames,
dropped 7/8 to 12 5/8 on 1.3 million shares.</p>
<p>Santa Fe Pacific gained 5/8 to 21. The company said it
plans to spin off its remaining 80% stake in its real-estate
unit and 81.7% interest in its energy business to
shareholders during the third quarter. Shares of the energy
subsidiary, Santa Fe Resources, rose 1/8 to 16.</p>
<p>Quaker Oats, which said its board approved in principle a
spinoff of its Fisher-Price toy unit to shareholders early
next year, rose 5/8 to 49 1/4. The company also reported that
its net income from continuing operations for its first
quarter was up 10% from a year ago.</p>
<p>Merry-Go-Round Enterprises advanced 3/4 to 21 1/4.
Montgomery Securities raised estimates of the company's
earnings for the first quarter, fiscal 1991 and fiscal 1992,
citing sales gains that have been "much stronger than
expected." The company told Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report its April sales for stores open at least one year
probably will be 40% to 50% higher than a year earlier, with
total sales climbing 60% to 65%.</p>
<p>Schering-Plough rose 1/4 to 80 1/8 after increasing its
quarterly dividend by 24%, to 56 cents a share, and declaring
a 2-for-1 stock split.</p>
<p>Blockbuster Entertainment, which reported that
first-quarter net jumped 82% from a year ago, gained 7/8 to
18 3/8. Strong quarterly earnings reports also boosted Vons,
which gained 1 7/8 to 22 5/8, and Harley-Davidson, which rose
1 to 43.</p>
<p>Golden Valley Microwave Foods dipped 1 to 32 3/4. Although
the company's first-quarter net income increased 61.7% from
the year-ago level, net excluding income from a joint venture
fell 16%.</p>
<p>Fieldcrest Cannon declined 1 1/8 to 19 7/8. The company
reported that its first-quarter net dropped 89% from a year
ago.</p>
<p>Lomas & Nettleton Mortgage Investments retreated 1 to 4
5/8 after the company posted a loss for its fiscal third
quarter, ended in March, and said it would forgo a dividend
payment in August.</p>
<p>General Motors Class E stock, representing GM's Electronic
Data Systems subsidiary, gained 5/8 to 29 3/8. This newspaper
previously reported in its "Heard on the Street" column that
money managers who like the GE unit's long-term prospects say
the stock's drop from its record high of 31 1/4 earlier this
month may be a buying opportunity.</p>
<p>Kuhlman climbed 1 1/8 to 10 5/8. The company signed a
letter of intent to sell its blow-molded plastics business to
the U.S. unit of Belgium's Solvay for about $45 million in
cash, plus certain deferred payments.</p>
<p>La Quinta Motor Inns rose 5/8 to 14 1/2. Industrial Equity
(Pacific), which owns about 13% of the company's common
shares, said it expects to hold discussions with La Quinta's
management about alternatives for maximizing shareholder
value.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index, which
closed at its lowest level of the year Monday, fell 1.06 to
343.89. Volume totaled 12,456,075 shares compared with
13,356,140 Monday. There were 220 issues advancing and 292
declining.</p>
<p>Home Shopping Network rose 3/8 to 7 1/4 following a report
in Multichannel News, a cable-television industry trade
publication, that the company has hired First Boston to
investigate its possible sale.</p>
<p>Thermo Instrument Systems, which said it expects to report
that net for the first quarter rose about 30% from a year
ago, gained 1/8 to 14 3/8.</p>
<p>Separately, the company reached an agreement to buy
Finnigan Corp. for $20 a share; Finnigan rose 4 1/2 to 18 3/4
in over-the-counter trading.</p>
