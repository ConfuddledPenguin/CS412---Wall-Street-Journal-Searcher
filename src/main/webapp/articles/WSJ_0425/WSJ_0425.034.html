	<p class="article-leader">The firing of the Pentagon's head of research is playing
as a case of Bush Administration "ideologues" purging a
lonely hero of U.S. "competitiveness." What we see instead is
a good man who fell in with the wrong crowd and became
confused about the real purpose of defense research.
   Craig Fields, director of the $1.1 billion Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), was transferred
last week after his latest spat with Deputy Secretary of
Defense Donald Atwood. While the trigger was ostensibly one
controversial investment, the dispute actually goes to the
heart of the debate about U.S. "industrial policy." Somewhere
during his 16-year career, Mr. Fields joined the crowd that
believes that a main Pentagon purpose is to nurture certain
U.S. commercial interests. Since this is neither Bush policy
nor in the American tradition, Mr. Fields was bound to lose.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That said, Mr. Fields has done an enormous amount of good
in an underappreciated area of U.S. defense-technology
research. His judgment delivered seed money for such
high-risk technologies as artificial intelligence (computers
that perform tasks analogous to human intelligence),
parallel-processing computers and semiconductors that use
gallium arsenide instead of silicon (and promise faster
processing speeds as well as protection against nuclear-blast
radiation). He also financed the ideas of Carver Mead, the
Caltech scientist and guru of America's computer industry.</p>
<p>Yet in the past year or so, Mr. Fields had begun to have
larger dreams for DARPA. He became a favorite of those on
Capitol Hill and in U.S. industry who sought an expanded
"commercial DARPA" for private industry. It wasn't enough to
boost futuristic technologies that couldn't find private
financing. He wanted the government to subsidize the U.S.
electronics industry -- for example, the $100 million subsidy
for Sematech, the federal computer-chip concern, and
high-definition TV.</p>
<p>In a letter last August to the planners at the Commerce
Department, Mr. Fields more or less endorsed a Japan-style
industrial policy for the U.S. "We need a national religious
conversion," he wrote, because "the American way" was no
longer good enough against the planners of East Asia. He also
took a swipe at "highly placed individuals who think nothing
is wrong," presumably senior White House aides who still
believe in such notions as free markets.</p>
<p>Now, we understand that the line between "seed money" and
industrial policy can be muddy. The national defense is a
common good that requires the collective effort marshaled by
government. Since technology is critical to American defense,
it makes sense for the Pentagon to spend liberally on R&D.
Some technologies are so speculative that the private sector
is reluctant to support them. Even as total defense spending
declines, R&D spending should increase, as a hedge against
future uncertainty.</p>
<p>Yet the government crosses the line when it undertakes the
wholesale subsidy of industry. We're still waiting to hear
why Sematech is needed in a world with dozens of
computer-chip makers. High-definition display screens may
have their defense uses, but that doesn't mean the feds
should get into the home-TV business.</p>
<p>The "commercial DARPA" proposed by Senator John Glenn
would undermine precisely the kind of far-out but promising
defense research that Mr. Fields spent his career supporting.
Pentagon research spending would become another political
honey pot micromanaged by Congress. Lobbyists for existing
industry would defeat the future every time.</p>
<p>In fact, just yesterday 11 Members of Congress fired off a
letter demanding that Mr. Fields be reinstated. The entire
industrial-policy crowd signed up -- Reps. Mel Levine, Dick
Gephardt, Don Ritter, Helen Bentley, Ed Markey, and Senators
Al Gore and John Heinz.</p>
<p>Mr. Fields has also seemed unduly worried about Japan. In
a world where information travels at lightning speed, it
isn't possible for Americans to lead in every technology.
Instead of trying to make everything at home, a better (and
more plausible) national-security strategy is to share
technology with the likes of Japan. If the Japanese steal a
lead in gallium arsenide or ceramics, it makes more sense to
share than to duplicate. In any case, paranoia sends exactly
the wrong message.</p>
<p>We'd like to see Mr. Fields find some spot at the
Pentagon, because his defense dreams have served his country
well. It's his larger dreams we worry about, just as we
continue to worry about the people who want to make the
private economy's best minds partners with the same people
who helped the S&L industry become what it is today.</p>
