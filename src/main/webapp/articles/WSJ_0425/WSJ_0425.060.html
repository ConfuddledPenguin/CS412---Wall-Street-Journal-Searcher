	<p class="article-leader">In your March 16 article about the new agent, sumatriptan,
manufactured by Glaxo, you state, "there is nothing in the
marketplace now that effectively treats migraine".
   Migraine is treated abortively and/or prophylactically.
Propranolol (Inderal) has been used extensively for migraine
therapy and has been recognized by the FDA for more than 10
years, as an effective agent in migraine prophylaxis. This
drug has demonstrated excellent results throughout the world.
Effective abortive agents are also available.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Only time, extensive studies and widespread use of
sumatriptan will demonstrate its reported benefits over those
of the currently used therapeutic agents.</p>
