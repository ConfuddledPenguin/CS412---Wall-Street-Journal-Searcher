	<p class="article-leader">Yields on certificates of deposit at major banks and
brokerage firms rose across the board -- pushing past the 9%
level for a five-year CD at one major bank.
   The increases in the week ended yesterday coincided with a
sharp rise in market interest rates that has pushed yields on
longer-term Treasury securities up to nearly 9%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The biggest increases in CD yields were among
small-denomination CDs sold by leading brokerage firms. The
average yield on one-year broker-sold CDs rose to 8.50% from
8.19%, while the five-year-CD average rose to 8.85% from
8.57%, according to figures compiled by Banxquote Money
Markets, a New York information service.</p>
<p>Average yields for most large-denomination CDs, which
typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were also up
significantly. The greatest gains were in the longer-term
maturities. Average yields on two-year jumbo CDs were 8.43%,
while five-year maturities were 8.54%. In New York, Chase
Manhattan Bank raised the yield on its five-year CD to 9.17%,
one of the highest in the country.</p>
<p>"Nine percent is a psychological resistance level," said
Banxquote Chairman Norberto Mehl. "Once one of the leading
banks has crossed this level, other banks are expected to
follow."</p>
<p>Mr. Mehl said that some of the leading brokers, such as
Shearson Lehman Hutton and Dean Witter Reynolds, are also
offering CDs that are approaching the 9% level.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, average yields on small-denomination CDs at 18
banks surveyed by Banxquote rose only slightly. The average
yield on a one-year consumer CD rose to 8.02% from 7.96%,
while five-year consumer CDs offered 8.20%, up from 8.16%.</p>
