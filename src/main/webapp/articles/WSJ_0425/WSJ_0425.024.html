	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. said the base price of its new
Mercury Capri convertible, which is to go on sale this
summer, will be $12,588, and that of the high-performance
Capri XR2, with a 132-horsepower, turbocharged engine, will
be $15,522.
   The Capri is expected to compete with cars such as the
highly successful Mazda Miata, which was introduced last
year. Market research indicates that Capri buyers will be 25
to 35 years old, and that many will be first-time buyers, a
Ford official said, predicting the car will sell particularly
well on the West Coast and East Coast and in metropolitan
areas.</p>
