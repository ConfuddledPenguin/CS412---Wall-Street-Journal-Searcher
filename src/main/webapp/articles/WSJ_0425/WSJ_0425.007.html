	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian manufacturers' unfilled orders in
February fell 0.7% from January, Statistics Canada, a federal
agency, said, citing in part lower order backlogs at
machinery and primary metal industries.
   Unfilled orders rose 0.7% in January and fell 1.8% in
December. In February, manufacturers' shipments rose 1.9%,
because of the reopening of some auto plants that were
temporarily closed in January.</p>
