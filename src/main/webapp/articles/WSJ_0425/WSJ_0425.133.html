	<p class="article-leader">The Southern Baptist Convention officially claims 14.9
million members, making it the largest of America's
Protestant denominations.
   By contrast, the Roman Catholic Church claims 54 million
adherents in the U.S., although sociologists say that number
includes many "cultural Catholics" who are no longer
practicing church members, and the American Baptist Churches,
formerly the Northern Baptists, claim 1.6 million members.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Southern Baptist statisticians and even some top
denomination officials acknowledge that the 14.9 million
figure for the Southern Baptists is overstated, and that as
many as half that number no longer set foot in a Southern
Baptist church.</p>
<p>The figure includes as many as 4.4 million so-called
nonresident members, a technical term that actually allows
the counting as members those the church has simply lost
touch with, Southern Baptist pastors say.</p>
<p>From church records, the convention's Sunday School Board
also calculates that another three million people haven't
attended their church or donated to one in the past year.</p>
