	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. is expected to announce
today that it will move production of its Chevrolet Camaro
and Pontiac Firebird muscle cars to a Canadian plant from one
in Southern California.
   But GM and United Auto Workers union officials said
yesterday there is still a chance that the 43-year-old Van
Nuys, Calif., factory that currently builds the cars will not
join the seven other GM assembly plants that have halted
production or been targeted for shutdown since 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GM scheduled a news conference at its Ste. Therese,
Quebec, plant for this afternoon. A GM spokesman in Canada
wouldn't elaborate on the reasons for the news conference.
Officials of the Canadian Auto Workers union said they're
expecting the official announcement that the Canadian factory
will build the next generation of the Camaro-Firebird,
beginning in 1992.</p>
<p>The Ste. Therese plant, which currently builds a line of
midsized cars, recently got a new paint shop with the help of
220 million Canadian dollars (US$189.5 million) in
interest-free Canadian government financing. Union officials
there also have agreed to company demands for more flexible
work rules.</p>
<p>GM and United Auto Workers union officials insisted
yesterday the Van Nuys plant may survive, despite its age,
its distance from GM's major parts operations and the poor
quality marks accorded its current products. Company and
union officials say they are working on plans to make the
plant into a flexible factory capable of building several
different models for the West Coast market.</p>
<p>"We're very optimistic that we'll be able to convert Van
Nuys" into a flexible manufacturing plant, a GM spokeswoman
said yesterday. "We don't expect it to close," added Henry
Gonzalez, assistant director for the UAW region that covers
California.</p>
<p>Moreover, by moving the Van Nuys plant's cars to Canada,
GM could trigger provisions of the current UAW-GM agreement
that prohibit layoffs except as a result of a sales downturn,
UAW officials said. Under those provisions, GM would have to
keep the 3,000 Van Nuys workers on the payroll even if they
had no production work to do.</p>
