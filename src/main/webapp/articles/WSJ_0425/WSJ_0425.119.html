	<p class="article-leader">NEW ORLEANS -- Tidewater Inc. said its board adopted a
shareholder rights plan to "deter coercive or unfair takeover
tactics."
   The operator of marine operations for the oil and natural
gas industry said the plan calls for one preferred stock
purchase right to be distributed for each common share held
May 7. The rights, which expire May 1, 2000, are exercisable
after the accumulation of 15% or more of the company's common
shares by a "hostile" buyer, Tidewater said.</p>
