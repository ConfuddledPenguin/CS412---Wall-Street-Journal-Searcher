	<p class="article-leader">The Supreme Court, in a setback to the film industry,
ruled that the re-release of the Alfred Hitchcock movie "Rear
Window" in 1983 violated the copyright for the story on which
it was based.
   The 6-3 ruling means that MCA Inc., actor Jimmy Stewart,
and Mr. Hitchcock's estate will have to share revenue from
the re-release of the film and distribution on videocassette
with Sheldon Abend, a literary agent who now owns the
copyright for the short story.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ruling, written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, also will
have far-reaching effects not only on the film industry but
on all producers of works that rely on other copyrighted
material.</p>
<p>The decision places a cloud over the rights to revenues
produced by a large number of works: those that were based on
other copyrighted material, that were made before a new
federal copyright law took effect in 1978 and for which the
owner of the original copyright died before that copyright
could be renewed. Before 1978, all copyrights lasted 28 years
and could be renewed for another 28-year term.</p>
<p>Mr. Abend estimated that there are more than 600
feature-length motion pictures based on literary works where
the authors died in the first term of copyright and the
copyright was validly renewed by their heirs. "What this
means is that these major studios will have to stop
distributing these movies and clear them with the estates and
give the heirs a fair chance" to share in the profits, Mr.
Abend said.</p>
<p>Stephen Kroft, a Beverly Hills, Calif., lawyer who filed a
friend-of-the-court brief for major motion picture studios
and distributors, said: "This will affect a lot of works
besides films. There will be a lot of uncertainty about
copyrights for a long time. Somebody who exploits copyrighted
works is going to have to research extensively the history of
the copyright."</p>
<p>But Peter Anderson, a lawyer in Santa Monica, Calif., who
represents Mr. Abend, said the ruling is a "victory" for
original, artistic creators.</p>
<p>The amount to which Mr. Abend is entitled will be
determined by a federal court in a hearing; a federal appeals
court estimated that the re-release yielded $12 million in
revenue from 1983 to 1988. The federal court also will have
to determine Mr. Abend's share of future revenue.</p>
<p>The short story, "It Had to Be Murder," was written in
1942 by Cornell Woolrich. In 1945, he sold the film rights to
a movie company and, in 1954, "Rear Window," starring Mr.
Stewart and Grace Kelly, was released. The author promised
that the movie company could distribute the film for both the
copyright and renewal periods. But Mr. Woolrich died in 1968
before he could renew the copyright. In 1969, the executors
of his estate renewed the copyright and sold it in 1971 to
Mr. Abend for $650.</p>
<p>After "Rear Window" was re-released in 1983, Mr. Abend
sued. A federal district court in Los Angeles dismissed the
lawsuit, but a federal appeals court in San Francisco
reversed the decision.</p>
<p>The legal question was whether the producer of a film or
other work that relies, with permission, on copyrighted
materials may continue to distribute that work during the
28-year renewal period. The high court said that the producer
of a work that uses copyrighted material with valid
permission can't continue to distribute that work during the
renewal period, unless the original creator properly renewed
the first copyright.</p>
<p>Justice John Stevens dissented, joined by Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia.</p>
<p>Mr. Abend's lawyer, Mr. Anderson, said the ruling will
return the law that governs work based on copyrighted
material to its original purpose. "The effect of the law was
to ensure that the real creators of a work would benefit from
the exploitation of their works, as would their families
after they died," Mr. Anderson said.</p>
<p>But Mr. Kroft, who filed the brief for the film industry,
said: "Where the copyright renewal rights are owned by a
successor, they've got a noose around the producers now" of
works derived from copyrighted material.</p>
<p>The movie producers and distributors for whom Mr. Kroft
spoke declined yesterday to comment separately on the
decision. These included Columbia Pictures Industries Inc., a
unit of Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.;
Orion Pictures Corp.; Paramount Pictures Corp., a unit of
Paramount Communications Inc.; and Fox Film Corp., a unit of
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr. Stewart said the actor didn't have any
comment on the Supreme Court's decision.</p>
<p>"This has put a whole number of works in limbo," said
Louis P. Petrich, who represented MCA and the other
defendants. "All the works created from 1962 to 1977 that are
subject to renewal are going to become like lepers, because
if you use them in creating a new work, there's always the
potential that they're going to be like a little time bomb."</p>
