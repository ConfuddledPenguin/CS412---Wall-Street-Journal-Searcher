	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- The leading indicator of Japan's economy
increased to 50, the so-called boom-or-bust line, in
February, the latest reporting month, and government
officials predicted that the economy will continue to expand.
   The Economic Planning Agency, which announced the
indicator, considers a reading above the line of 50 as a sign
of future economic expansion, and a reading below that level
as an indication of possible contraction ahead.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The February reading represented a pick-up from a revised
40.9 in January.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, EPA Director-General Hideyuki Aizawa
reported to the cabinet that Japan's economy continues to
expand.</p>
<p>Mr. Aizawa's April report meant that the country's economy
has continued to expand for 41 months in a row, almost
matching the second-longest, post-war expansion of 42 months,
which was set between June 1958 and December 1961.</p>
