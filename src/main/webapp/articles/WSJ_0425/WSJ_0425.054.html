	<p class="article-leader">According to your April 19 Asides, Czech public prosecutor
Tomas Sokol is threatening to outlaw the Czechoslovak
Communist Party under an existing statute prohibiting fascism
in that country.
   Should Mr. Sokol need expert testimony corroborating his
conclusion that communism and fascism are mirror-image
tyrannies, here are some testimonials from experts on the
subject:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Susan Sontag (American liberal-intellectual author and
literary critic): "Not only is fascism (and overt military
rule) the probable destiny of all Communist societies --
especially when their populations are moved to revolt -- but
Communism is itself a variant, the most successful variant,
of fascism."</p>
<p>Adolf Hitler: "The petit bourgeois Social Democrat and
trade union boss will never make a National Socialist, but
the Communist always will. . . . There is more that unites us
than divides us from Bolshevism . . . above all the genuine
revolutionary spirit."</p>
<p>Andrei Sakharov (Russian dissident and Nobel Peace Prize
winner, to Soviet officials at the 1978 trial of Anatoly
Shcharansky): "You are not humans. You are fascists. Hear me,
a member of the Academy of Sciences. You are fascists."</p>
<p>Seweryn Bailer (Columbia University professor of Russian
Studies and emigre from Poland): "I came to realize that the
system there {in the U.S.S.R.} involved all of the things I
had fought against in Nazism. And I made my decision on this
to leave that system at the first opportunity."</p>
<p>Bernard-Henri Levy (French intellectual of the "New
Philosophers" Movement): "I am the bastard child of an unholy
union between fascism and Stalinism. . . . The only
revolution I know, the one which may grant notoriety to this
century, is the Nazi plague and Red fascism."</p>
<p>Prof. A. James Gregor (author of "The Fascist Persuasion
in Radical Politics," Princeton University Press, 1974): ". .
. Fascist and Communist regimes are subspecies of one and the
same species. . . . In substance, whatever distinctions there
are between `fascist' and `communist' movements in terms of
ideological commitments -- they are singularly superficial."</p>
<p>Although your Asides did not address the problem of
"former" Communist parties now calling themselves "Democratic
Socialist" or "Social Democratic," there is an urgent need in
geopolitics for a label distinguishing such parties from
those of Western "social democrats" -- who are, in truth,
free-enterprise welfare-state democrats, rather than
state-ownership socialists of Marxist tendency.</p>
<p>The new label is "communoid," which simply indicates that
the political party in question most assuredly was Communist
(i.e. left-wing fascist) and, in its socialist heart of
hearts, may still be.</p>
