	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered the ratings on
subordinated debt of CrossLand Savings and said that if the
savings bank continues to suffer from a capital crunch, a
further downgrade is possible.
   The ratings agency said the downgrade reflects
"CrossLand's deteriorating asset quality, accentuated by a
large loss in the first quarter ended March 31, as well as
its ongoing capital deficiency." On Friday, CrossLand
reported a first-quarter loss of $136.5 million, reflecting a
$100 million provision for possible losses on problem loans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Brooklyn-based CrossLand, the largest savings bank in New
York and one of the largest in the country, has suffered from
weakness in the regional real estate market. The bank's
nonperforming assets have been soaring just as new, strict
capital requirements were instituted in thrift-reform
legislation passed by Congress.</p>
<p>CrossLand has been ordered to bolster its low tangible
capital base, but a recapitalization plan collapsed last
month when the Pritzker family of Chicago decided against an
investment.</p>
<p>As an alternative, CrossLand recently filed a proposal
with the Office of Thrift Supervision to convert preferred
stock, which isn't counted as core capital because of its
cumulative feature, into common stock. But shareholders have
to approve the plan, and even if they do, said S&P, "it will
leave the company shy of the risk-adjusted capital minimum."</p>
<p>Maurice Reissman, chairman, president and chief executive
officer of CrossLand, said S&P is wrong in its assertion that
the stock reclassification plan won't cover its capital
requirement. "The total risk-adjusted capital requirement is
for $621.8 million," said Mr. Reissman, "And if the
reclassification is successful, we'll have $752.3 million."</p>
<p>In its statement, S&P added, "Partially mitigating the
concerns is CrossLand's continued strong market position."</p>
<p>The agency downgraded CrossLand's subordinated debt to
triple-C-plus from single-B, and its certificates of deposit
to single-B/single-B from double-B-minus/single-B. These
ratings were placed on CreditWatch in November. S&P said
about $170 million of subordinated debt is affected, but it
affirmed its single-C rating on CrossLand's $363 million of
preferred stock.</p>
<p>Separately, the crowded CrossLand annual meeting lasted
nearly two hours, as a variety of shareholders criticized the
company for its judgment and performance.</p>
<p>In remarks about the future of the company, Mr. Reissman
reiterated statements in the annual report about cutting back
on construction loans, emphasizing residential real estate
loans, and exploring the sale of branch operations in several
states.</p>
<p>Mr. Reissman didn't offer new proposals for raising
capital. He said he couldn't answer questions about how
seriously the bank will be hurt if the stock reclassification
doesn't get approved by the preferred and common shareholders
or what alternatives the company has.</p>
