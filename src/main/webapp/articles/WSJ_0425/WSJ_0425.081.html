	<p class="article-leader">The attorneys general of seven states accused the nation's
mortgage lenders of violating federal law by requiring
homeowners to place more money than necessary in escrow
accounts held by the lenders.
   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said at a news
conference that, as a result of such long-time practices, the
mortgage lending industry is holding several billion dollars
of homeowners' money unlawfully.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By law, lenders are allowed to establish escrow accounts
to collect and hold money from homeowners to pay for taxes
and insurance on mortgaged property. In all but a few states,
little or no interest is paid to the consumer by the lender
on these accounts.</p>
<p>But a 1975 amendment to the federal Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act (Respa) limits the size of the escrow
accounts. Under Respa, lenders are prohibited from requiring
consumers to maintain in the accounts more than one-sixth of
a year's required payments for taxes and insurance. Congress
allowed a two-month cushion to protect the lender's
investment in a house by making sure enough money is set
aside, in case a homeowner defaults on payments.</p>
<p>The states launched an investigation in June 1988 after a
Long Island, N.Y., homeowner complained about possible escrow
overcharges. A survey of four of the largest lending
organizations, comprising Citicorp's Citibank; General Motors
Corp.'s GMAC Mortgage Corp.; Fleet/Norstar Financial Group
Inc.'s Fleet Mortgage Corp.; and Lomas Financial Corp.,
disclosed overcharging in two-thirds of all home mortgages,
Mr. Abrams said.</p>
<p>"The cushions sometimes equaled three to five months of
the annual tax and insurance bills, serving no legitimate
purpose to protect the lenders' investment but rather
providing them with more money on which they could earn
greater profits," Mr. Abrams said. The other six states that
conducted the investigation are California, Florida, Iowa,
Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Abrams, affected homeowners maintain on
average $150 more in escrow than is permitted by law. In
addition to violating the Respa ceiling, he said that lenders
routinely ignored escrow-account restrictions contained in
their underlying mortgage agreements, meaning the total
amount overcharged could be even higher than the states
suspect.</p>
<p>The states maintain that the lenders exceed the legal
limits by employing a complicated accounting technique known
as "individual item analysis." Under this system, the lenders
in effect create subaccounts for each type of expenditure
that must come out of the escrow account. By requiring that
each subaccount never go below zero, regardless of how much
money remains in the account as a whole, the lenders end up
with cushions in excess of the two-month ceiling, said New
York Assistant Attorney General Melvin L. Goldberg.</p>
<p>"The industry standard is to do itemized accounting. I
don't doubt that there are isolated problems, but it's not
widespread. The industry has come a long way in policing
itself on this issue," said Brian Chappelle, staff vice
president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, a
trade group.</p>
<p>"We're puzzled by (Mr. Abrams's) announcement. We don't
set out to create any excess, but any excess beyond the
two-month cushion is automatically returned to the consumer,"
said a spokesman for Citibank. Spokesmen for Lomas and GMAC
said they could not comment, because they had not seen the
report. A Fleet spokesman did not return phone calls.</p>
<p>Mr. Abrams said the states formally requested 18 months
ago that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
increase enforcement of the escrow limits and develop new
rules on how lenders should compute escrow balances to avoid
any excesses. So far, HUD has taken no action, Mr. Abrams
said. If HUD does not respond, Mr. Abrams said the states
will be forced to file individual lawsuits against the
lenders.</p>
<p>A HUD spokesman said, "Secretary Jack Kemp fully supports
any efforts to make sure homeowners are not overcharged on
their escrow accounts, but since 1974 HUD has had no
enforcement authority over the escrow accounts. Congress has
asked the department not to publish any new regulations
governing Respa until Congress can hold hearings on the
subject."</p>

<p>BROWN & WILLIAMSON Tobacco Corp. seeks reversal or new
trial in $148.8 million case. The Louisville, Ky., cigarette
maker asked U.S. District Judge Frank W. Bullock Jr. in
Greensboro, N.C., to reject a jury's verdict that B&W had
illegally competed with Liggett Group Inc., a Durham, N.C.,
tobacco company.</p>
<p>The case centers on Liggett's allegation that B&W engaged
in so-called predatory price discrimination in the market for
lowpriced, generic cigarettes in 1984 and 1985. After a
seven-month trial, the jury found last month that B&W
violated the little-used antitrust law known as the
Robinson-Patman Act. However, it rejected Liggett's further
claim that B&W had infringed its trademark on design features
of its packages.</p>
<p>B&W said that the antitrust verdict, if left to stand,
would "chill the spirit of fair and aggressive competition in
this country, limiting the methods for introducing and
marketing new products."</p>
<p>Liggett asked the judge to preserve the antitrust verdict
and to grant a new trial on the trademark issue.</p>
<p>Judge Bullock said he would take at least 60 days to
decide the motion.</p>

<p>SOURCE PERRIER is sued by a San Francisco seltzer water
company. With stores beginning to restock Source Perrier
S.A.'s sparkling water after a two-month recall, Seltzer
Sister Bottling Co. has sued the Paris-based company and its
distributors in the U.S., Perrier Group of America Inc. and
Great Waters of France Inc.</p>
<p>The action was filed in federal court in San Francisco on
behalf of Seltzer Sister and other bottlers of carbonated
water, charging Perrier has violated federal consumer laws.
These laws allow companies to sue competitors in an effort to
collect damages for consumer fraud, according to attorney
Caroline Barron of North & Barron in Phoenix, Ariz.</p>
<p>Seltzer Sister claims that for 14 years Source Perrier
falsely advertised to U.S. consumers the purity and natural
effervescence of its bottled water. Seltzer Sister is a
five-year-old firm that delivers seltzer water to homes and
restaurants in the San Francisco Bay area. Ms. Barron alleges
that consumers were persuaded to buy Perrier instead of
factory-carbonated water like the kind sold by Seltzer Sister
because they thought Perrier's carbonation was natural and
healthier.</p>
<p>Neither Perrier nor its attorney could be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>The seltzer delivery service wants Source Perrier to pay
three times the amount it paid to advertise, or its profits
during the 14-year period, says Ms. Barron. She estimates
damages to run as high as $100 million or more.</p>
<p>In early April, Perrier recalled all its bottled waters
after North Carolina regulators found some bottles contained
small amounts of benzene, a poisonous liquid shown to cause
cancer in laboratory animals. Source Perrier officials said
that in addition to the water in its famous spring in
Vergeze, France, it separately pumps carbon dioxide gas to
the plant. The gas contains the benzene. Company officials
also disclosed that the gas for its water was filtered in an
effort to remove those chemicals.</p>
<p>Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said
Perrier's claim to bottle "naturally sparkling" water is
false.</p>
