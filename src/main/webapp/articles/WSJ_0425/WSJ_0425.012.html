	<p class="article-leader">To evaluate the fundamental political changes going on in
Europe these days, journalists and commentators have pressed
a whole lexicon of historical catchphrases into heavy-duty
service. "1848," for example, the year revolutionary
movements shook European capitals, now serves as shorthand to
describe the hopeful -- and, perhaps, sometimes, ephemeral --
move to democracy in places like Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Bulgaria or Romania.
   A reference point that pops up even more frequently is
"Sarajevo," the name of the Bosnian town where, in 1914, an
assasination triggered World War I and the dissolution of the
Habsburg empire. Recognizing that the great powers
essentially "stumbled" into a world-wide conflagration they
didn't want and whose course they couldn't control, we have
come to see Sarajevo and its aftermath as a case study in the
frailties of political leadership -- as a metaphor for the
capacity of otherwise rational men to turn diplomatic
molehills into mountains of human misery. Writers and
speakers also sometimes speak of "Sarajevo" when they seek to
warn of the chaos the breakup of another empire, the Soviet
one, might bring. But there are some problems we might like
to consider before employing this mighty analogy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Take a moment to review what actually happened in the
Bosnian capital three-quarters of a century ago. On June 28,
1914, a young Serbian nationalist named Gavrilo Princip
assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of
Austria-Hungary, and his wife Sophie. Franz Ferdinand was a
moderate who hoped to hold the multinational Habsburg Empire
together through concessions to Slavs. His assassin belonged
to a terrorist society that saw him as a threat to its dream
of an independent south-Slav state.</p>
<p>Anti-Slav elements in Vienna understood that they could
use Franz Ferdinand's murder as a pretext for a move against
the pan-Slav center of Serbia. After securing promises of
support from its ally Germany, the Austro-Hungarian
government delivered an ultimatum to Serbia, an ultimatum
designed to be too draconian for Serbs to accept. Belgrade's
refusal would allow the imperial army to attack Serbia.
Austria's bullying of Serbia aroused the Russians, who
considered themselves defenders of Slavic interests in the
Balkans. Czar Nicholas II ordered mobilization against
Austria.</p>
<p>This in turn alarmed the Germans, who like Austria-Hungary
opposed the expansion of Slavic power, and whose military
leaders were prepared to risk a "preventive war" against
Russia. They also feared that they might not be able to stop
the huge Russian "steamroller" once it was effectively set in
motion. Germany felt particularly vulnerable because Russia
was allied to France, which was likely to fall upon the Reich
from the west while Germany was attempting to contain Russia
in the east. Germany's strategy in the event of war -- the
infamous Schlieffen Plan -- therefore called for a rapid and
overwhelming strike against Paris, the success of which would
allow German troops to hurry east before the Russian
steamroller started to roll.</p>
<p>The French government, recalling France's mauling by the
Germans in the Franco-Prussian war 44 years before, was not
anxious for a general war, but did give its Russian ally the
same assurances that Germany had given Austria; Paris hoped
that this might restrain the Germans. France's other ally,
Britain, also hoped to prevent an escalation of the conflict,
since if France were attacked Britain would surely have to
come to her defense.</p>
<p>Germany should have known this all along, but the
likelihood of British intervention seems to have dawned on
the Reich's leadership only at the last minute.
Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 28, even
though Belgrade had accommodated virtually all the demands
contained in Vienna's ultimatum. Austria was encouraged in
this course by the German general staff, which reassured
Vienna that it still had the full backing of the world's most
powerful army.</p>
<p>Each of the powers went to war in August 1914 expecting
rapid and decisive victory. But the fighting was to last four
years and to claim roughly nine million lives. The European
war became a "world war" because it was fought by empires
that drew on the manpower of their colonies, and because
unrestricted submarine warfare by the Germans brought the
U.S. into the conflict in 1917. It was said to be the "war to
end all wars," but its outcome prepared the way for a second,
more terrible, conflict.</p>
<p>Could "Sarajevo" happen again? Six years ago
defense-policy analyst Steven E. Miller asked this question
and concluded that indeed it could. He argued that in 1984,
as in 1914, leaders were dangerously flirting with the
notions that military measures were necessary to preserve
power; that a war, even one between the superpowers, could be
quick, decisive, and "limited"; that there were great
advantages in striking first and great perils in not doing
so. And he noted that if the costs of the First World War
were vastly disproportionate to the ends achieved, they were
likely to be so again in 1984, but by a rather more
impressive margin.</p>
<p>Although one might quarrel with some aspects of Mr.
Miller's historical comparison, searching for analogies
between 1914 and the present probably made more sense in 1984
than it would today. Systems of "entangling alliances," which
played so pernicious a role in the outbreak of World War I,
and continued to define international politics in 1984, are
rapidly falling apart. The concept of "limited war" --
entertained both by the men of 1914 and the U.S. government
in the early 1980s -- no longer seem so prevalent in high
councils of state. Doctrines of devastating "first strikes"
or effective "forward defense," championed so loudly in 1914
and again in the early 1980s, have not been officially
abandoned, but their viability has been undercut by
arms-reduction agreements and troop withdrawals. Political
leaders are no longer inclined -- indeed they have not been
so since World War I -- to abdicate responsibility to their
generals; generals, for that matter, are now often more
cautious than politicians.</p>
<p>Of course, we should not be too quick to conclude that the
atrophy of the Cold War and the decline in mutual
saber-rattling is rapidly ushering in an "end of history" of
the kind described by State Department analyst Francis
Fukuyama. There may be some certain ominous similarities
between the realities of 1914 and those of today. Once again
a multinational empire is facing an internal "nationalities
crisis" that might induce it to resort to military measures.
The disintegration of that empire's Eastern European sphere
of influence has unleashed nationalist forces as potentially
destabilizing as those of 1914. Ironically, the nationalities
conflict is particularly fierce in Yugoslavia, the South-Slav
state that Princip hoped to bring to life by killing Franz
Ferdinand.</p>
<p>Asked during the war by his prison physician if he would
still have shot the archduke had he known what would follow,
Princip answered "yes." Plenty of Princips are still abroad
in the world. One thing, though, will certainly be different
if another Princip pulls the trigger on a new Armageddon: It
is unlikely the event will be commemorated by footsteps
stamped in the concrete, as is the case at the corner of
Rudolf Street and the Appel Quai in downtown Sarajevo.</p>
