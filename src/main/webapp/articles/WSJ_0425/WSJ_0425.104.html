	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Federal Pioneer Ltd. said four nominees of
Groupe Schneider S.A. of France were appointed to Federal's
eight-member board following Schneider's acquisition of a
controlling stake in the Canadian electrical equipment maker.
   Schneider is offering 15 Canadian dollars (US$12.92) a
share for all the common shares of Federal Pioneer. Last week
it completed the purchase of a 63% stake in Federal Pioneer
from Enfield Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The French concern hasn't acquired the remainder of those
shares as yet, Federal Pioneer said. The C$300 million bid is
set to expire Monday.</p>
<p>The Schneider nominees are Lorenzo Folio, Michel Robin,
Denis Lagrange and E. Jacques Courtois. They succeed Enfield
representatives Willard L'Heureux, Robert Harding and James
Meekison. There was one vacancy on the board.</p>
<p>Federal also said Mr. Folio was named chairman, succeeding
Mr. L'Heureux, who resigned.</p>
<p>Enfield, an industrial holding concern in which the
Bronfman family's merchant bank, Hees International Bancorp
Inc., holds a 40% stake, tendered its 53.3% fully diluted
stake in Federal Pioneer to the offer.</p>
<p>Schneider has extensive holdings in the electrical
equipment industry. It plans to integrate Federal Pioneer
with its MerlinGerin S.A. subsidiary.</p>
