	<p class="article-leader">Hees International Bancorp, a merchant banking concern
controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family that has a 40% voting
stake in Canadian Express Ltd., said it deferred its offer to
buy as many as 40 million common shares of the Toronto-based
industrial holding company for 65 Canadian cents (56 U.S.
cents) each, pending further regulatory review.
   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Canadian
Express common closed at 52 Canadian cents, up one cent.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Ontario Securities Commission on Monday withdrew an
exemption from certain regulatory requirements that it had
granted to the Hees bid, which was made March 23. The
commission believed Hees should have referred in its
exemption application to a fairness opinion prepared by Wood
Gundy Inc. in May 1989, Hees said. Hees has asked Wood Gundy
to update that opinion for the commission.</p>
<p>The proposed bid would raise Hees's voting stake in
Canadian Express to about 56%; the 40% includes a 7% in
common stock and 33% in preferred stock.</p>
