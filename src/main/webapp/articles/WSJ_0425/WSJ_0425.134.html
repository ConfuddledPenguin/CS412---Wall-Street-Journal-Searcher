	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp., trying to avoid a Chapter
11 bankruptcy-law filing, said it will make a proposal to
recapitalize with an exchange offer of new secured debt and
common stock.
   The company said it will file "within the next few
business days" a registration statement and proxy materials
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, providing an
outline of the exchange offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In March, Western Union told the SEC in its annual filing
that it could be forced to seek protection under the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code if it doesn't work out a suitable
restructuring of its debt or raise sufficient funds through
asset sales.</p>
<p>The 139-year-old company has been hit by a steep decline
in its telex business amid an explosion in facsimile
transmission. And Western is meeting stiff competition from
American Express Co. and MCI Communications Corp. in the
money-transfer and electronic mail businesses.</p>
<p>In its filing with the SEC, Western Union said it will
request clearance from the commission to make the exchange
offer to holders of its senior secured reset notes due Dec.
15, 1992, which currently carry an interest payment of
19.25%, as well as to holders of 16% notes due June 15, 1991.</p>
<p>Western is also seeking approval from its stockholders to
reclassify its widely distributed preferred shares and the
Class B common shares held by Brooke Partners L.P. into an as
yet undisclosed number of regular common shares.</p>
<p>Brooke, which controls Western, has been wrestling with
the company's senior reset bonds, which currently total $500
million. The terms of these bonds require Western to raise
the interest rate on the bonds from 16.5% to a level that
would allow them to trade at par. This year the company
raised the rate to 19.25%, but the bonds nonetheless are
trading at 37 cents on the dollar, or $370 for each $1,000
note. And the interest burden on this senior debt will hit
$96 million this year. The total interest expense is $116
million, a Western Union spokesman said.</p>
<p>"The current level of debt payments is not sustainable by
the business," he said. Cash flow available to pay off the
company's debt in 1989 totaled $62 million, he said.</p>
<p>On April 6 Western met with a group of its senior note
holders that had agreed in writing to keep the briefing
confidential and not to trade on the company's securities
until the proceedings were made public.</p>
<p>At that meeting Western told the holders that the company
now operates as two units -- financial services and business
services. Financial services include money transfer, a bill
payment service (formerly National Payments Network, which
Western acquired in 1989), Mailgram and Telegram. Business
services include telex, the EasyLink electronic mail service,
and Priority Mail service.</p>
<p>Western said the two units together had operating profit
of $167 million last year.</p>
<p>Western also disclosed that it had cut annual expenses by
more than $100 million in 1989 to $655 million, primarily
because of a 50% reduction in its work force to 3,800
employees and reduced lease charges for transmission lines.</p>
