	<p class="article-leader">Sir Kit McMahon, chairman of Midland Bank PLC, issued a
profit warning, saying high U.K. interest rates are raising
prospects for trouble with the bank's domestic loan
portfolio.
   Sir Kit, speaking at the annual general shareholders'
meeting, didn't provide an exact profit forecast. But he said
that profit is "currently running well below the level
achieved in the very different conditions prevalent in the
first half of last year."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Midland reported first-half 1989 pretax profit of #531
million ($868.2 million), up from #313 million in the
year-earlier period. It posted a pretax loss of #261 million
for all of 1989, largely as the result of extensive loan-loss
provisioning for advances to Third World nations.</p>
<p>"With the {British} government seeing the need to keep
interest rates high, the deterioration in trading conditions
is continuing and indeed intensifying," Sir Kit said.</p>
<p>He noted "lower overall asset growth and a further
weakening of margins" are helping to eat into Midland's net
interest income.</p>
