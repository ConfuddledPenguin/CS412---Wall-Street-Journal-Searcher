	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Orders to makers of big-ticket goods leaped
6.7% in March, the Commerce Department reported, suggesting
to some analysts that the manufacturing sector may be in a
mild rally.
   The March increase in orders for durable goods -- factory
equipment, cars, appliances and other items intended to last
at least three years -- was the biggest jump since December
1988, when orders rose 7.4%. It followed an increase in
February of 2.3%. The two months together weren't enough,
however, to make up for the 10.5% plunge in January, which
was led by weakness in auto orders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The March report "suggests the industrial sector may have
bottomed out in January or February and may well have
rebounded a bit," said Donald Straszheim, chief economist at
Merrill Lynch & Co. "It's appropriate to read this as
indicative of a bit of strength in the economy."</p>
<p>However, Gordon Richards, economist for the National
Association of Manufacturers, said the rise was misleading
because "a pickup in individual sectors is disguising an
overall slower growth trend in the economy."</p>
<p>Both the March and February advances reflected strong
orders for transportation equipment -- the March increase in
that segment was 21%. The Commerce Department said most of
that was attributable to aircraft orders, although motor
vehicles also showed increases. Transportation orders bounce
around a lot from month to month and were also a factor in
the big January orders drop. Excluding them, the March orders
increase was 2% and February orders were flat.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, "even allowing for the air transport
portion, one has to have his confidence bolstered by the
report," said David Littmann, senior economist at
Manufacturers National Bank of Detroit. "It shows the economy
is far from recession and is still steaming along."</p>
<p>Mr. Littman said he expects the government's report on
first-quarter gross national product, scheduled for release
Friday, to show a 1% to 2% expansion in total economic growth
on an annual basis. Mr. Straszheim of Merrill Lynch predicted
a higher figure, about 2.8%.</p>
<p>New orders for durable goods in March totaled $128.77
billion, up from $120.68 billion in February. Orders for
primary metals increased 7%, while orders for nonelectrical
machinery, which includes computers, rose 1.6%. Orders in the
electrical machinery category rose 1.1%.</p>
<p>Orders for nondefense capital goods -- which include the
increase in aircraft orders -- were up 14.9% in March. In
defense capital goods, orders were down 4.5%.</p>
<p>Unfilled orders increased 0.8% to $496.70 billion,
reversing a rare decline in February of 0.5%.</p>
<p>Shipments in March increased 1.5% to $124.99 billion,
after a February increase of 5.5%.</p>
<p>All the figures were adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>
