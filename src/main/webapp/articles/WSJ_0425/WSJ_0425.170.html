	<p class="article-leader">San Diego Gas & Electric Co. said first-quarter net income
jumped 56%, in part because year-earlier earnings were
depressed by a special charge.
   The utility holding company reported net before the
payment of preferred dividends of $56.1 million, or 95 cents
a share, compared with $35.9 million, or 59 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 8% to $539.5 million from $499.4
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the 1989 first quarter, California's Public Utilities
Commission disallowed the company $25 million of costs to
import power over the Southwest Powerlink.</p>
<p>Thomas A. Page, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, also attributed the earnings improvement to "reduced
utility operating and maintenance costs and improved earnings
of our subsidiaries."</p>
