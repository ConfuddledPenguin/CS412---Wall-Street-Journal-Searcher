	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade said it plans to
begin trading an oat futures-options contract Tuesday.
   The launch of the oat contract will mean that every CBOT
agricultural futures contract "will be complemented by an
options market," the exchange said. Months listed for the
contract will be the same as the underlying oat futures,
beginning with July 1990.</p>
