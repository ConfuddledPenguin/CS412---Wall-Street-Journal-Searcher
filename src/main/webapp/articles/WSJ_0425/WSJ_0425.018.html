	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Resolution Trust Corp. is considering a
plan to reduce prices of real estate the government has
repossessed and is having trouble selling.
   In a signal that it's having a tough time selling the
property, the thrift bailout agency said in a meeting
yesterday that it may slash prices below appraised values
more than originally planned. Its real-estate portfolio may
eventually total as much as $100 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>RTC Chairman William Seidman compared the proposed policy
to a department store markdown, calling it the "Filene's
basement plan." Under the plan, if a property doesn't sell
after six months, the RTC could reduce the price to 15% below
the price set by private appraisers. After three more months
without a sale, the price could be reduced 5% more. After
that time, the property would be reappraised. For residential
property, the first markdown could occur after four months.</p>
<p>"It's costing us every day because we are not making the
sales that we could be making," said Mr. Seidman. The RTC has
taken control of about $16.4 billion in foreclosed real
estate, but it has sold only about $2 billion of that since
the agency was created in August.</p>
<p>The board delayed for two weeks any decision after Robert
Clarke, comptroller of the currency, said he was concerned
that the policy could hurt other real-estate prices. The
agency will re-examine the proposal during that time.</p>
<p>The RTC said the proposed policy wouldn't violate a
provision in the savings-and-loan restructuring law that
restricts the RTC from selling real estate below 95% of the
market value in depressed areas. The agency argues that
market value shouldn't be set exclusively by appraisers, but
by what price attracts buyers.</p>
<p>The RTC may also consider how to guarantee loans for some
private borrowers to finance purchases of RTC real estate,
said David Cooke, executive director of the agency.</p>
<p>Separately, the RTC tapped Greenwich Capital Markets Inc.,
a Greenwich, Conn., investment banking specialist that deals
in asset-backed securities and mortgages, to act as its
adviser in setting policies for securitizing mortgages and
loans held by the RTC thrifts. In addition to the $250,000
policy contract, Greenwich will launch a pilot project to
bundle some RTC assets to be sold in blocks. The amount of
that contract will depend on the extent of the assets in the
securitization program.</p>
