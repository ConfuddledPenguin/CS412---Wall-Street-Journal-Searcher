	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Top California Democrats, who have launched
a drive to defeat two Republican-backed reapportionment
plans, asked organized labor to give $1 million to the effort
in lieu of regular campaign contributions.
   Yesterday, after other California lawmakers resisted the
unusual proposal, and after inquiries were made by this
newspaper, the state's Democratic House delegation abandoned
it. But the lawmakers still are moving forward with an
aggressive "soft money" fund-raising campaign even as
Congress debates ending or limiting such contributions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Soft money, which consists of contributions to state party
organizations and state-level political committees, falls
outside of the limits and disclosure requirements of the
federal election laws.</p>
<p>The California Democrats' goal is to raise at least $2
million, according to several people involved in the effort.
Labor almost certainly will still be asked to make a
significant contribution, although not as part of the swap
initially proposed at a meeting of delegation members with
labor leaders earlier this month. Other major Democratic
donors in California are also being asked to make big
contributions.</p>
<p>State Rep. Vic Fazio heads the California Democrats'
reapportionment drive, known as IMPAC 2000. He denied that
labor was given any specific contribution target, but other
people who are knowledgeable about the meeting said the $1
million figure was discussed. Mr. Fazio also asserted that
there is nothing untoward about soliciting labor support for
such an important effort. He said Republicans are pouring
hundreds of thousands of dollars to try to pass the
initiatives, which, he added, "aren't something that were put
on the ballot by public citizens' groups."</p>
<p>The use of soft money is especially sensitive in
California since the disclosure that U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston
(D., Calif.) received more than $800,000 in soft-money
contributions from savings-and-loan executive Charles Keating
for voter-registration drives. Sen. Cranston faces a Senate
Ethics Committee investigation into his ties to Mr. Keating.</p>
<p>As many as a dozen of the 27 Democratic incumbents in
California could be endangered when House districts are
redrawn starting next year, according to several political
analysts in the state. The two June ballot propositions, both
of which are supported by the Republican Party, would change
the way redistricting is done. One would set up a panel of
retired judges to handle reapportionment. The other would
require a two-thirds vote of both houses of the California
Legislature to adopt a reapportionment plan. Current law
requires approval only by a simple majority of the
legislature, which is controlled by the Democrats.</p>
<p>If both measures pass, the one with the largest number of
votes would be adopted.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, some of the Democrats in the
California delegation began to resist the proposed
arrangement with labor, at least in part because they need
labor contributions themselves. At least two of the members
in tough contests were to be exempt from the swap, but a
wider reluctance to forgo the campaign income apparently
killed the effort.</p>
<p>In addition, even though the monies would have come from
several unions, at least some of the lawmakers privately
worried about the appearance of taking so much from a single
interest group. Labor leaders themselves had been skittish
about the proposed swap.</p>
<p>Several prominent Democratic donors, including film
producer and investor Frederick Field, have been asked to
make large contributions to California IMPAC 2000. Besides
that effort, Democrats in the California state Legislature
also have fundraising campaigns in high gear. Altogether,
California Democrats hope to raise more than $5 million to
defeat the ballot propositions.</p>
<p>Republicans, meanwhile, have their own big soft-money
program to pass the two propositions. According to Bob Marks,
campaign director for one of the proposition drives,
supporters of the two ballot initiatives have already raised
more than $1 million and hope to raise at least $2.5 million
more. A $400,000 television advertising campaign has been
budgeted.</p>
<p>The Republican National Committee has kicked in more than
$500,000 to support the two propositions. David Packard,
finance chairman of Californians for Political Reform, one of
the ballot proposition groups, has contributed $25,000.
Donald Fisher, chairman of the Gap Inc. clothing-store chain,
gave $10,000. A number of law firms and oil companies have
made large donations as well.</p>
