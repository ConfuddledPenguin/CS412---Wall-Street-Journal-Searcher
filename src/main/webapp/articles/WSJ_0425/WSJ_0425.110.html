	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Five companies announced a joint project to
develop improved software technology for managing knowledge
with expert systems, a branch of artificial intelligence.
   Carnegie Group Inc., a Pittsburgh-based software company,
joined together with electronics giants Digital Equipment
Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc., auto maker Ford Motor Co.
and U S West Inc., a telephone company. The group said they
are investing a total of $10 million over five years in what
they called the Initiative for Managing Knowledge.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dennis Yablonsky, president of Carnegie Group, said the
project aims to devise a new technique for representing
knowledge in computers that will let different computers and
different software programs incorporate the knowledge. Unlike
current expert systems, the knowledge wouldn't be based on a
single expert's expertise, nor would it be in a
self-contained system, he said.</p>
<p>David Fawcett, expert systems manager in Ford's
electronics division, said that eventually the technology
might allow computerized design systems laying out printed
circuit boards in Dearborn, Mich., to check a knowledge base
of manufacturing plants to see if a design would pose any
problem.</p>
<p>The group said it had begun working two years ago and
plans to finish the first phase late this year. It said group
members will be free to use the technology or sell it to
others.</p>
