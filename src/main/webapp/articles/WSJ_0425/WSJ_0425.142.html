	<p class="article-leader">Melville Corp., Rye, N.Y., said first-quarter earnings
plunged 68%, largely because the Easter selling period falls
in the second quarter this year.
   Melville, a specialty retailer of apparel, footwear,
prescription drugs and other businesses, said net income fell
to $7.8 million, or four cents a share, from $24.2 million,
or 22 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 5.8% to $1.62
billion from $1.53 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Melville noted that the Palm Sunday and Easter week
selling periods occurred in the second quarter of 1990 but in
the first quarter of 1989.</p>
<p>The company also noted that it issued preference stock
last June on which the quarterly dividend is $3.9 million;
the year earlier per-share figure didn't reflect a preference
stock dividend.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Melville
fell 50 cents $45.25.</p>
