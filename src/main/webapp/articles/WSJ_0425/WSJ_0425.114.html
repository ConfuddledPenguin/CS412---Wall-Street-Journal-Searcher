	<p class="article-leader">Wellcome PLC of Britain, a major pharmaceutical concern,
said the U.S. Food & Drug Administration approved the use of
its biggest drug, Zorivax, for treatment of shingles in the
U.S.
   Shingles, or herpes zoster, is a viral infection of
certain sensory nerves, causing pain and an eruption of
blisters along the affected nerve. Zovirax already is used to
treat other herpes diseases in the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year ended Aug. 26, Zovirax sales totaled #293
million ($479.1 million), up 36% from a year earlier. A
spokesman declined to forecast earnings from Zovirax sales,
but said the U.S. market is potentially lucrative. An
estimated 300,000 people in the U.S. become affected by
shingles each year, he said. Wellcome said it will begin
marketing the orally dispensed drug through its U.S. unit,
Burroughs Wellcome Co., within several weeks.</p>
<p>Zovirax has been in use for other herpes diseases since
1981 and was first used as a shingles treatment in Britain in
1987. About 20 countries have approved the drug's usage to
treat shingles.</p>
