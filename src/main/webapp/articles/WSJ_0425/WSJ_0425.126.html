	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- First Interstate Bancorp said it reached an
agreement with National Convenience Stores that will allow
First Interstate customers to use their automated teller
machine cards to purchase merchandise and gasoline at certain
of National's Stop N Go Stores outlets.
   The bank holding company said it expects about 100
California Stop N Go locations to participate in the program,
using electronic terminals in those stores. It also expects
to expand the program to Texas, and potentially Washington
and Arizona, First Interstate said.</p>
