	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Commodore International Ltd. introduced an
Amiga personal computer that gives it a solid entry in the
fast-growing market for machines using multimedia technology.
   "Multimedia" has become the latest buzzword in the
personal-computer industry because improvements in handling
sound, pictures and video seem to open the way for new uses
for computers at a time when growth in personal-computer
demand is slowing. Proponents argue that multimedia systems
will soon be used widely by corporate trainers, schools and
anyone making a formal presentation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Commodore, based in West Chester, Pa., has been struggling
for the past year and is staking its future on the multimedia
computer market. It hopes to ride the demand for multimedia
systems and get into corporate accounts, much the way Apple
Computer Inc. used its Macintosh's aptitude for desktop
publishing to solidify its position in corporate America.</p>
<p>It won't be easy. Commodore still needs to persuade more
big dealers to carry the Amiga line. But dealers, facing the
welter of products available, are trying to reduce the number
of companies whose products they carry. Commodore faces a
similar hurdle with corporate customers trying to simplify
their computer systems; Amiga software won't run on Macintosh
or IBM-compatible machines.</p>
<p>In general, Commodore needs to re-establish its
credibility. It has had losses in recent quarters and
personal computer sales are down, even in West Germany, its
strongest market. Reflecting these problems, Commodore's
stock has tumbled 60% in the past year. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, Commodore shares closed
at $7.25, down 25 cents.</p>
<p>The machine announced at a news conference here yesterday
stacks up nicely against the competition. The Amiga 3000 uses
Motorola Corp.'s powerful 68030 central processor as well as
some customized chips that speed the handling of graphics and
sound. The 3000 also comes with a so-called authoring system
that makes it rather easy to pull together a multimedia
presentation.</p>
<p>"This machine is state-of-the-art," said Nick Arnett, a
consultant with Multimedia Computing Corp., Santa Clara,
Calif.</p>
<p>With suggested retail prices of $3,299 to $4,499 --
depending on the speed of the processor and the size of the
hard disk -- the Amiga 3000 line also costs thousands of
dollars less than some competing systems.</p>
<p>Harry Copperman, who has been running Commodore's U.S.
operations for the past year, said the company is making
progress in its target markets: education, government and
corporations, mainly for use by trainers. He said existing
models of the Amiga line now account for more than 50% of
sales.</p>
<p>"This {turnaround} is a journey, not an event," he
cautioned. But he added: "Overall, we've been very pleased."</p>
