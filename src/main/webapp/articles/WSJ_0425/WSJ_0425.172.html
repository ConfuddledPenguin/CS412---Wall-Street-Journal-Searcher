	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Following a seven-day losing streak, bond
prices were little changed yesterday. But in the futures
market, the rout continued with prices of bond futures
falling for the 13th consecutive trading session.
   Traders termed yesterday's bond market as dizzy because
prices meandered for much of the day. In early trading,
Treasury bonds posted modest declines in reaction to two key
economic indicators: the Commerce Department's durable goods
report and the Labor Department's employment cost index.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Orders for durable goods, such as factory equipment, cars,
appliances and other items intended to last at least three
years, jumped 6.7% in March following a 2.3% advance in
February. The report provided fresh evidence that some
sectors of the manufacturing industry are rebounding.</p>
<p>While that may be good for the economy, the bond market
reacts badly to such news because investors fear that a
pickup in economic activity could lead to higher inflation
and interest rates, two trends that reduce the value and
appeal of fixed-income securities. In fact, a
sharper-than-expected increase in the employment cost report
demonstrated that inflation is accelerating.</p>
<p>The employment cost index for all civilian workers rose
5.5% for the 12 months ended in March, up from a 5% rise in
1989.</p>
<p>Prices of the benchmark 30-year bond fell more than 1/4
point, or $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount, after
the reports were released.</p>
<p>But when yields on the benchmark bond hit 9%, an important
psychological level, Wall Street dealers and professional
traders rushed into the market to buy cheap securities to
cover short-sale positions. In a short sale, dealers and
professional traders sell borrowed securities and later seek
to make a profit by replacing what was borrowed with cheaper
securities. Essentially, these dealers are betting that
prices will fall.</p>
<p>"It was a crazy day," said Kevin Flanagan, money market
economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "Everybody was
expecting the market to sell off sharply after the reports
and stay that way," he said.</p>
<p>The bond market rally fizzled later in the day due to lack
of interest by retail investors. "There was just no follow
through by investors and with no retail support, the market
could not sustain the gains," said Mr. Flanagan.</p>
<p>In the futures market, traders said the 13-day decline was
the longest losing streak in recent memory. And some
technicians say the selling spree isn't over yet.</p>
<p>"The trend is still toward higher interest rates," said
Roger Froehlich, president of Technical Dimensions, Mount
Kisco, N.Y.</p>
<p>John Slosberg, a senior analyst at Technical Data Global
Markets Group, warned clients yesterday that the futures
market remains "vulnerable to the downside."</p>
<p>Bond futures have fallen more than four points since the
first week in April and now are at the lowest levels in
nearly a year. June bond futures settled yesterday at a price
of 89 4/32, down 1/8 point. Mr. Slosberg said if June bond
futures contract prices break below 88 26/32, which
corresponds to a 9% yield on the government's benchmark
30-year bond, "you will see frenzied selling," he said.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>News that former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond
chief Michael Milken pleaded guilty to six felony counts had
little effect on the junk-bond market.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken is widely credited with creating the market a
decade ago, but his presence has diminished considerably
during the last two years.</p>
<p>Most junk bonds ended unchanged yesterday. However, there
were some notable exceptions.</p>
<p>Among the biggest losers was Ames Department Stores Inc.
The retailer's junk bonds plunged on reports that it hired
the New York law firm of Skadden Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom
to prepare papers for a possible Chapter 11 bankruptcy
filing. A Skadden Arps spokesman confirmed that it had been
retained by Ames "to explore various restructuring
alternatives." But the spokesman declined to say specifically
if Ames was planning to file for bankruptcy-law protection.</p>
<p>Ames 13% senior subordinated reset notes fell five points
in early trading, but rebounded by the afternoon to close one
point lower at 21. The company's 7 1/2% subordinated
convertible debentures fell three points to about $11.25.</p>
<p>Among winners: The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. advanced
despite news that the food and tobacco giant reported a loss
of $222 million for the first quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts said some investors ignored the net loss and
instead focused on operating income, which climbed to $602
million from $402 million in the first quarter a year ago.</p>
<p>"I think at minimum the market should be very pleased with
the numbers," said Dirk Van Doren, a high-yield analyst at
McCarthy Crisanti & Maffei Inc.</p>
<p>RJR's pay-in-kind bonds, which had been up more than a
point, finished as much as 3/4 point higher. The 13.71%
convertible pay-in-kind debentures, due in 2009, rose 5/8 to
81 5/8 on the New York Stock Exchange. The 13.71%
exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, ended
3/4 point higher at 68 1/8.</p>
<p>Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.'s junk bonds jumped four points
on news that the Justice Department's antitrust division will
allow Michelin Group's proposed acquisition of Uniroyal to go
forward as scheduled.</p>
<p>Uniroyal's 14 1/2% subordinated debentures, maturing in
2000, finished four points higher at 109.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Bond prices ended narrowly mixed after a day of seesaw
trading activity. The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price
of 95 5/32, slightly higher than 95 4/32 on Monday. The yield
was unchanged yield 8.96%.</p>
<p>The latest 10-year notes were slightly higher at 96 27/32
to yield 8.97% compared with 96 25/32 to yield 8.98%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates moved lower yesterday. The discount rate
on three-month Treasury bills was 7.76% for a bond-equivalent
yield of 8.00%, while the rate on six-month bills was 7.90%
for a bond equivalent yield of 8.32%.</p>
<p>On Monday, the average discount rate of Treasury bills at
the government's auction was 7.78% for a bond equivalent
yield of 8.05%, while the average auction rate for six-month
bills was 7.91% for a bond equivalent yield of 8.35%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Helped by demand for collateral for new derivative issues,
mortgage securities fell 1/32 to 2/32 but held up better than
the intermediate Treasury market.</p>
<p>The Federal National Mortgage Association announced two
real estate mortgage investment conduit issues, or Remics,
totaling $550 million, while the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. offered a $300 million Remic.</p>
<p>With dealers seeking collateral for these deals, Freddie
Mac and Fannie Mae securities fared well for the second
straight session.</p>
<p>The benchmark Freddie Mac 9 1/2% issue eased only 1/32 at
96 6/32, while the Fannie Mae 9 1/2% issue dropped 1/32 to 96
23/32.</p>
<p>In the Government National Mortgage Association market,
the 9% Ginnie Mae issue ended at 93 27/32, down 2/32; the 9
1/2% issue at 96 13/32, down 2/32; the 10% issue at 98 31/32,
down 2/32; and the 11% issue at 103 1/4, also down 2/32.</p>
<p>In the Remic market, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
underwrote a $300 million Fannie Mae deal backed by Fannie
Mae's 10% issue, Shearson Lehman Hutton sold a $250 million
Fannie Mae issue backed by 15-year 9 1/2% securities, and
Morgan Stanley underwrote the $300 million Freddie Mac issue,
which is backed by 9% securities.</p>
<p>Municipal Issues</p>
<p>Tax-exempt issues were 1/4 to 3/8 point lower in listless
late trading.</p>
<p>"I think it's a general lack of enthusiasm, a general lack
of optimism. The market's suffering from some kind of
malaise," one municipal trader said.</p>
<p>Traders cited a lack of interest among investors in buying
bonds. Some participants may be waiting for municipals to
bottom out before they begin bargain hunting, a few traders
said.</p>
<p>In one of the largest deals of the session, a Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. group set the preliminary pricing for a
$283 million issue of Transmission Agency of Northern
California revenue bonds. The bonds were tentatively priced
to yield from 6.40% in 1994 to 7.35% in 2024.</p>
<p>In new-issue activity, a Smith Barney Harris Upham & Co.
group repriced an issue of $82 million Ohio Water Development
Authority revenue bonds. The bonds are now priced to yield
from 6.10% in 1991 to 7.35% in 2009 and 2016.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>The rebound of the dollar against the yen put a damper on
the Japanese government bond market yesterday.</p>
<p>The dollar ended at 158.15 yen, up from 157.55 yen in
Tokyo late Monday and 157.55 yen at the Tokyo close Monday.
In response, Japanese government bond prices fell 0.26 points
to 85.96 to yield 7.375%.</p>
<p>British government bonds ended little changed while West
German bonds were modestly lower. Meanwhile, the Canadian
subsidiary of International Business Machines Corp. tapped
the Eurobond market yesterday. IBM Canada Ltd. issued 150
million Canadian dollars (US$129 million) of five-year notes
through lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston. The coupon
rate was set at 13 1/2%.</p>
