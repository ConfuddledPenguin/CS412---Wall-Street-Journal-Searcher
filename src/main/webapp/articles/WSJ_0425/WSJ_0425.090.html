	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Canam Manac Inc. and two Quebec government
agencies said they agreed in principle to pool their holdings
in Noverco Inc. and to offer 15.25 Canadian dollars
(US$13.14) a share, or about C$218 million, for the 27% of
Noverco they don't already own.
   Canam Manac currently holds about 44% of Noverco and the
two Quebec agencies together hold about 29% of the Montreal
energy concern. Noverco's main operating unit is Gaz
Metropolitain, Quebec's dominant natural gas distributor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Trading was halted in Canam Manac and Noverco shares
Friday after a news report that an agreement was reached. On
the Toronto Stock Exchange Noverco last traded at C$12.625
and Canam Manac last traded at C$4.60. Canam Manac is a St.
Georges, Quebec, steel products concern.</p>
<p>Canam Manac, Caisse de Depot et Placement, the Quebec
government's pension-fund agency, and Soquip, the province's
energy agency, said they will form a new holding company to
hold their Noverco shares and make the tender offer. They
said Canam Manac will own 50% of the holding company and the
agencies 25% each.</p>
<p>The three concerns said the agreement is subject to
regulatory approval. They said that as part of the agreement
Caisse de Depot and Soquip hold an irrevocable option to
acquire Canam Manac's Noverco shares. The option can be
exercised on three month's notice between July 1, 1991, and
March 31, 1993. Canam Manac holds an irrevocable option to
sell its Noverco shares on the same terms.</p>
