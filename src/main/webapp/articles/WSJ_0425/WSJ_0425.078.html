	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Wall Street is seeking to capitalize on the
forced reshaping of corporate America.
   Merrill Lynch & Co., predicting a string of financial
problems that will trigger corporate restructurings, is
expanding its presence in the high-yield, high-risk "junk"
bond market to take advantage of the investment banking
opportunities caused by corporations' fiscal woes. Merrill
becomes the latest -- and biggest -- Wall Street securities
firm hunting for big profits in the restructuring business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Merrill is counting in particular on an increase in the
already rising number of corporate bankruptcies, as more
companies face credit crunches such as the one that put
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. out of business. The
bankruptcy-law filings, and threats of them, might create
years of active business for investment bankers.</p>
<p>"Reorganizations and reshapings of companies will mount,
and it's spreading around the world," Jerome P. Kenney,
Merrill's head of capital markets, said in an interview. "We
intend to be the leader in the new shape of it."</p>
<p>Bankruptcy-law filings in 1989 and so far this year aren't
as numerous as they were in the mid-1980s, when the rust,
farm and energy belts were hurt by a near-depression -- but
they are rising. More important from Wall Street's
perspective, the companies involved are getting bigger, with
$500 million to $1 billion bankruptcy-law cases becoming
common, rather than rare.</p>
<p>Aside from bankruptcy opportunities, investment bankers
also foresee restructuring business, as companies seek to
raise money by spinning off units that aren't able to issue
investment-grade bonds. The bankers are desperate for some
kind of business these days; investment banking revenue at
most major brokerage firms in the first quarter was down 20%
to 25% from a year earlier, reflecting the low number of
merger deals and underwriting opportunities.</p>
<p>Though the fees from restructuring deals are unlikely ever
to approach those of the lucrative leveraged buy-outs that
made investment bankers rich until recently, they are still
attractive.</p>
<p>Firms such as Bear Stearns Cos., Salomon Inc., CS First
Boston Inc. and American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Hutton
Inc. unit also are active in the restructuring field.
Primerica Corp.'s Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. unit,
another big player, recently snapped up Drexel's 23-member
financial-restructuring unit. Even Kidder, Peabody & Co., a
General Electric Co. unit that never had much visibility in
junk bonds, has beefed up its restructuring operations.</p>
<p>Shearson, the second-biggest U.S. brokerage firm behind
Merrill, has been shrinking nearly all of its businesses as
part of a huge retrenchment effort. Yet a spokesman said
restructurings are still "an important and growing area for
us." A Shearson executive said that in the firm's 10-member
restructuring group, "The guys are running around like crazy"
these days.</p>
<p>Reshaping companies could be just the potion that an ill
Wall Street needs. The Street since the 1987 stock market
crash has been in the throes of a profits recession, if not a
depression. The irony: The Street now is relying on hard
times in other sectors to bail it out.</p>
<p>Cynics say Wall Street is always prepared to cash in on
others' problems, even those the Street itself helped create.
Wall Street was midwife to some of the current problems
companies are facing by helping them dig too deeply into debt
in the 1980s.</p>
<p>George Putnam III, publisher of Boston-based Bankruptcy
DataSource, which tracks companies in bankruptcy-law
proceedings, said that the way Wall Street is relying on a
bankruptcy binge to make money is "odd, to say the least."
But he said, "There is a legitimate role for investment
bankers in the area," and the opportunities will multiply for
at least the rest of this year.</p>
<p>Merrill's push has particularly caught the brokerage
industry's eye. Because Merrill "is the biggest brokerage
firm and presumably has the most resources to throw at {the
restructuring business}, it's interesting that they see an
opportunity here," Mr. Putnam said.</p>
<p>Merrill said its restructuring focus, including what Chief
Financial Officer Thomas Patrick called an "increasing
commitment to the junk-bond market," is a natural response to
the stepped-up amount of "distress situations" among its
corporate clients.</p>
<p>U.S. public corporations are making bankruptcy-law filings
at the rate of more than two a week. Merrill's Mr. Kenney
said this trend should "worsen over the next nine months, and
then bottom out until it gets better." But even then, there
are millions of dollars to be made by investment bankers;
many bankruptcy-law reorganizations take years to complete,
so even a slowdown in filings this year wouldn't kill the
business.</p>
<p>To capitalize on the trend, Merrill is expanding its team
of investment bankers specializing in so-called workouts, the
fixing of distressed companies. The workout team, set up four
years ago with only two or three bankers, now has about 20
and may increase to 30 shortly, Mr. Kenney said.</p>
<p>But Wall Street's new restructuring push has pitfalls. To
do what they want, investment banks need to increase their
commitment to the junk-bond market, because junk paper is
usually involved in the restructuring of distressed
companies. Some Merrill stockholders said they are troubled
by Merrill's increased emphasis on the troubled junk market,
which Drexel once dominated.</p>
<p>At Merrill's annual meeting last week, for example,
holders queried Merrill officials about whether a plunge into
junk is a risk worth taking for a firm that, because of a big
retrenchment plan, posted a net loss for 1989 of $213.4
million. But William A. Schreyer, Merrill chairman, said junk
is a $200 billion market, so Merrill must be heavily involved
in it to serve clients. "There is junk and there is garbage,"
Mr. Schreyer said, "and the idea is to avoid the garbage."</p>
<p>Merrill emphasized that it isn't expanding its inventories
of junk bonds. Pressed by the major credit-rating companies,
Wall Street brokerage firms have been trimming their junk
inventories, rather than expanding them.</p>
<p>The credit-rating concerns have a big role in the
corporate restructuring boom that Merrill and other brokerage
firms foresee, however. Mr. Kenney of Merrill said one reason
so many corporations will be seeking bankruptcy-law
protection is pressure from credit-rating concerns worried
about liquidity problems at otherwise healthy firms. Drexel
was forced into bankruptcy court because it was unable to
secure short-term financing.</p>
<p>Such "liquidity-induced deals" will predominate in the
expected wave of collapses, Mr. Kenney said. And along with
the credit-rating companies' pressure will come pressure from
lenders who will precipitate bankruptcy-law filings by
pulling away from lending. "I think you're going to see
{more} bank-caused filings," Mr. Kenney said.</p>
<p>Some analysts warned that Wall Street shouldn't get too
giddy about the potential for the restructuring business.
Michael Goldstein, a brokerage analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein & Co., said he thinks there isn't "enough revenue
potential in bankruptcies to offset the declines" in mergers,
leveraged buy-outs and related takeover-speculation
businesses. "I'm not sure how big the revenue potential of
this entire market will ultimately be," Mr. Goldstein said,
though on a depressed Wall Street, "something is better than
nothing."</p>
