	<p class="article-leader">A federal grand jury in San Diego indicted 14 Southern
California lawyers and four other people on charges of
participating in a scheme to defraud insurers of as much as
$50 million.
   The indictment alleges that Lynn Boyd Stites, a Glendale
lawyer, now believed to be living in Gstaad, Switzerland,
organized and controlled this network of lawyers, who often
represented both sides of the same lawsuits. The longer and
more complex these lawyers could make the litigation
involving insurance company policyholders, the higher their
fees ran, the indictment alleges. Insurers were paying the
legal fees for the policyholders who were being sued and had
coverage.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These attorneys were involved in nine major litigations,
which spawned a myraid of other lawsuits and countersuits.</p>
<p>The indictment also alleges that "the Alliance," as the
network of lawyers and associates is known among prosecutors,
provided funding and administrative support to its various
member lawyers. A bookkeeper was used to keep track of funds
collected by Mr. Stites, who had a kickback arrangement with
each member of the Alliance. Money also was paid to
individual clients while they were defendants in lawsuits
controlled by the Alliance, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>The 18 defendants were charged with 18 violations under
the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO)
and 18 mail fraud violations. The case is the result of a
continuing investigation by the U.S. Postal Inspection
Service.</p>
<p>The grand jury indictment included a surprise defendant,
Leonardo Radomile. Mr. Radomile, a San Diego attorney, had
dealings with the Alliance, but he held himself out as an
undercover informant working with the postal inspectors. He
said he often wore a body wire and recorded numerous
conversations with Alliance members for investigators.</p>
<p>Yet the indictment alleges that Mr. Radomile received
financial assistance from the Alliance to run his law firm,
was compensated by the Alliance for being a defendant in one
case, and that he referred five other major litigations to
the Alliance.</p>
<p>John Heisner, Mr. Radomile's attorney in San Diego, had no
comment on the indictment.</p>
<p>Last month, a suit was filed under RICO by Fund American
Cos.' Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. and Sears, Roebuck & Co.'s
Allstate Insurance Co. The suit named 26 defendants, 18 of
whom, including Mr. Stites, are lawyers. It alleges fraud,
conspiracy and mail fraud and seeks $6.3 million in actual
damages. Under RICO, a damage award could be tripled.</p>
<p>The insurers' suit names many of the same defendants
charged by the grand jury yesterday, but they didn't name Mr.
Radomile.</p>
