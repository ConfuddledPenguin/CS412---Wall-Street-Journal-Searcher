	<p class="article-leader">Kuhlman Corp., Birmingham, Mich., said it entered into a
letter of intent to sell its plastics operations to Solvay
America Inc. for about $45 million, which includes cash,
certain deferred payments and assumption of related
liabilities.
   The announcement came at Kuhlman's annual meeting. Solvay
America is a unit of Solvay & Cie S.A. of Belgium.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plastic operations being sold contributed about
one-quarter of Kuhlman's 1989 sales of $166 million, the
company said. These operations include plants in Michigan,
Pennsylvania and in Ontario, Canada, plus a technical
development complex in Michigan and interest in a Mexican
joint venture.</p>
<p>"This development will enable Kuhlman to focus its efforts
on our profitable electrical tranformer business, which has
always been our principal business segment over Kuhlman's
entire 96-year history," said Donald O. Dulude, chairman,
president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>In 1989, Kuhlman earned $5.1 million, or 92 cents a share,
compared to a $8.1 million loss a year earlier.</p>
