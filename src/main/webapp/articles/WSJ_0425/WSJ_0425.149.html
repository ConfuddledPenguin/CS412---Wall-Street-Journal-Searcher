	<p class="article-leader">BUSH DEFERRED any sanctions against the Soviet Union over
Lithuania.
   Reflecting both continued hope for negotiations and U.S.
allies' unwillingness to support such curbs, the president
said that he currently won't take any steps that might
provoke a Kremlin backlash and scuttle chances for a
settlement of the standoff over Lithuania's independence bid.
The decision, which was announced after Bush met with
congressional leaders, followed days of debate within the
administration about whether to cancel talks with Moscow on
economic issues.</p>

which is to be released today. The 12-ton device is expected
to enable astronomers to peer into space almost to the
beginning of time. The first pictures from the telescope are
expected to be relayed to Earth in about seven days.</p>
