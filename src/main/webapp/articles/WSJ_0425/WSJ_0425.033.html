had been tendered under its offer to purchase shares
outstanding at $30 each; the offer expired Monday.
   Getty Petroleum Corp., Jericho, N.Y., which prior to the
offer owned about 40% of the common shares of Slattery,
agreed not to tender any shares under the offer. Excluding
Getty's stake, about 99% of the shares outstanding have been
tendered.</p>
