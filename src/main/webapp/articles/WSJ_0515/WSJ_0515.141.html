	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- The West German economy grew 2.5% in the
first quarter of 1990 from the fourth quarter of 1989 after
price and seasonal adjustments, the West German Economics
Ministry said.
   The Economics Ministry said in a monthly report released
yesterday that it now sees gross national product (GNP)
growth for the full year of between 3.5% and 4%. That follows
suggestions from Deutsche Bundesbank Vice President Helmut
Schlesinger, who in a speech last Thursday said GNP would
grow by "about 4%" in 1990.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In January, the Economics Ministry forecast that GNP would
grow 3% in 1990. But by March, officials were indicating that
that forecast, made before the proposal to introduce the
Deutsche mark into East Germany, was in need of upward
revision.</p>
<p>In February, the Economics Ministry said that fourth
quarter GNP grew 1% in the fourth quarter from the third
quarter.</p>
