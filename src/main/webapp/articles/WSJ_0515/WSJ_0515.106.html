	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Many parents view video games as the
junk food of the mind and Nintendo Ltd. as the chef.
   Hoping to change that image, Nintendo is to announce today
that it's donating $3 million to Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Media Laboratory in the hope that MIT can find
ways to help create games that stimulate thought.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MIT and Nintendo believe the 20 million Nintendo
video-game systems in homes around the U.S. could play a role
in education precisely because they're so popular among
children. "Children feel absolutely comfortable with {video
games}. It's more than comfortable, it's a love affair," says
Seymour Papert, a mathematician at Media Lab who's an expert
in using play to help children learn.</p>
<p>Prof. Papert and fellow MIT scientists primarily will
conduct basic research on how to harness the nation's
otherwise idle fascination with video games for constructive
use. With MIT's findings, Nintendo and its licensed software
makers will then develop games. Under terms of the grant, MIT
doesn't have to create specific game cartridges, though Prof.
Papert doesn't rule out that possibility.</p>
<p>Nintendo isn't just trying to appease concerned parents
with the project. With its systems already in 90% of all
homes with children of video game-playing age, the market is
nearing saturation. By creating more interest in educational
games, the Japanese company could boost software sales.</p>
<p>As part of that thrust, Nintendo has talked to Video
Technology Industries Inc., an Illinois electronics concern,
about creating a game that would develop a child's deductive
powers and memory. Video Technology is currently programming
a game, but because of the weak market for educational games,
Nintendo won't sign any pact until it sees the product,
according to an executive involved in the talks. Nintendo
also is exploring businesses outside the video game field,
including electronic stock trading and home shopping.</p>
<p>For video-technology concerns, this isn't the first foray
into electronic education. Nintendo itself has two
educational video games, under the Sesame Street name, that
help children spell and learn numbers. Other companies,
including Mattel Inc., Quaker Oats Co.'s Fisher Price unit
and Tiger Electronics Inc. also make educational games.</p>
<p>These existing games haven't been runaway successes among
children, because they're too much like classwork and not
enough like games. As a result, only about $350 million of
educational software was sold last year, a shadow of the $3.5
billion in sales that video games racked up. Nicholas
Negroponte, director of the Media Lab, attributes the weak
market for educational games to the fact that "they try to
trick kids into thinking that they're playing" instead of
doing assignments.</p>
<p>The challenge, says Mr. Negroponte, is to come up with
ways to develop games that entertain kids and educate them at
the same time in such subjects as math, geometry and logic.
"Nintendo doesn't know how {to make such a game}, that's why
they're giving us the project," he adds.</p>
<p>"It's a very difficult thing to do," comments Bernard
Tessler, a former school teacher who now runs Children's
Creative Workshop, a retail store in Syosset, N.Y. "It hasn't
been done successfully yet." He himself once toyed with the
notion of trying to develop such games, but decided not to
because "I didn't have the materials and means," he says.</p>
<p>Another difficulty: Just the idea of having children spend
more time playing video games at home or in class will be
jarring to many parents. "Nintendo is the antithesis of
school," says Mr. Negroponte. "Parents resent their children
playing with the game. They feel it's a distraction."</p>
<p>Prof. Papert, the proponent of a radical education theory,
is going to head the MIT project. He's known for his use of
Lego blocks to tutor elementary school children in physics
and spatial geometry. Hooking up the blocks to a computer,
children learn how to construct bridges, buildings and cars.
Then, through a special computer language system called Logo
that Mr. Papert devised, they make the objects move and
operate. The Lego-Logo system is now used in about one-third
of U.S. elementary schools and was the outgrowth of a grant
from Denmark's Lego Group.</p>
<p>It was Prof. Papert's work with Lego that got Nintendo
President Hiroshi Yamauchi's attention in February when Mr.
Negroponte first approached him. "We went to him with a 3
1/2-inch thick document outlining a project proposal,"
recalls Mr. Negroponte. "But Nintendo broadened the scope of
our research, leaving it open-ended without establishing a
set of deliverables and deadlines."</p>
<p>Before coming up with ideas on how to mix play and
learning with software, researchers will try to better
understand children's fascination with video games. "Nobody
fully understands how something like this can have such a
strong hold on someone," notes Prof. Papert. "Sometimes, it's
scary to think about it."</p>
<p>Prof. Papert says any new Nintendo game by MIT could
include elements from two games already on the market. One is
Nintendo's Tetris, a sort of geometric jigsaw puzzle that
requires players to think several moves in advance, because
the positioning of one piece on the screen dictates where the
next four or five will go. The other is SimCity, a game by
Maxis in which players build cities. SimCity offers some
understanding of engineering design, architecture and the
environment.</p>
