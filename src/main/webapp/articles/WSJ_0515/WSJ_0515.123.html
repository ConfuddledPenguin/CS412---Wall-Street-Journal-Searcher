	<p class="article-leader">Mission Insurance Group Inc. said a federal court approved
the company's rehabilitation agreement for unit Mission
Insurance Cos. that, among other things, calls for the
transfer of $29 million in assets to government trusts.
   The Los Angeles-based insurer has been in bankruptcy-law
proceedings since 1987. Its insolvency was one of the largest
insurance-company failures in history.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The California Insurance Commission must resolve certain
tax issues in connection with the plan.</p>
<p>Under the plan, the assets and liabilities of Mission
Insurance Cos. will be transferred to trusts overseen by the
California insurance commissioner. The transfer is to include
$14 million in cash and 5.9 million Mission Insurance Group
common shares, representing about 29% of the stock
outstanding.</p>
