	<p class="article-leader">TUCSON, Ariz. -- Tucson Electric Power Co. said that an
arbitration panel ruled that the company didn't breach
certain terms of a power-sales contract with San Diego Gas &
Electric Co. and won't be required to refund $57 million in
disputed payments to the California utility.
   The arbitration proceeding was begun in 1988 and the
finding cannot be appealed. The dispute arose over sales of
power by Tucson Electric to San Diego Gas between June 1987
and May 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dispute centered on the scheduling of available power
by Tucson Electric to San Diego Gas. San Diego Gas asserted
that Tucson had imposed scheduling restrictions that breached
the purchase contract.</p>
<p>San Diego Gas also contended that Tucson Electric didn't
meet its contractual obligations in terms of power capacity
provided to San Diego Gas.</p>
<p>James Walsh, an attorney for San Diego G&E, said the two
companies had filed lawsuits over the disputed power sales
but had dropped the litigation and instead agreed to abide by
the decision of the arbitration panel.</p>
