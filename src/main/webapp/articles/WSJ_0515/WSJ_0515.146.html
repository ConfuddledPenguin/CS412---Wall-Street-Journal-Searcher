	<p class="article-leader">ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Blinder, Robinson & Co. said that the
Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a preliminary
injunction entered against it almost a year ago that limited
the brokerage's ability to transfer assets outside its
ordinary business.
   Blinder is a unit of Intercontinental Enterprises Inc. and
once was the nation's largest penny-stock broker.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The preliminary injunction was granted in May of last year
by a Philadelphia federal judge, who enjoined Blinder from
transferring assets outside of its ordinary business and
prohibited it from transferring funds overseas without
advance notice or court approval. The judge also ordered
Blinder to return funds transferred to overseas bank accounts
to the U.S.</p>
<p>However, in late May of 1989, the appeals court agreed to
stay the provisions limiting transfers overseas and the
requirement to return assets from overseas.</p>
<p>The injunction was issued as part of class-action lawsuits
filed by three groups of former Blinder Robinson customers
who are charging the brokerage with securities fraud,
excessive markups on stocks and racketeering. A trial date
for the lawsuit hasn't been set, a Blinder lawyer said.</p>
<p>Separately, Intercontinental Enterprises said it had a net
loss of $4.5 million, or six cents a share, for its year
ended Jan. 26, compared with a net loss of $9.6 million, or
13 cents a share, in the previous year. Revenue fell about
50%, to $42.1 million in fiscal 1990 from $84.6 million in
fiscal 1989. The company attributed the revenue decline to a
downturn in the securities industry and said the latest-year
loss includes the cost of closing several Blinder Robinson
offices.</p>
