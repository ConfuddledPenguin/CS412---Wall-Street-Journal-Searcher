	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Fab Industries Inc., a manufacturer of knitted
textile fabrics and other products, adopted a poison pill --
a measure designed to make hostile takeovers prohibitively
expensive.
   The company will issue rights to shareholders of record
June 6. Under certain takeover circumstances, the rights
would entitle the holders to buy shares of Fab or its buyer
at half the market price.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move isn't a response to any specific takeover effort,
Fab said. At March 22, Fab had 3.3 million shares
outstanding.</p>
