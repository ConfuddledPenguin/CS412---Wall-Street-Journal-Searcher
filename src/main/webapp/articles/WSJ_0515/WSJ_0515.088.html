	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors in a New York real estate
partnership filed suit, seeking to block the sale of the
partnership and to obtain more control over management.
   Oppenheimer & Bigelow Income Fund I and Edge Partners
filed suit in Delaware Chancery Court against American Real
Estate Partners and American Property Investors. API's
parent, Integrated Resources Inc., is operating under the
federal bankruptcy laws and, according to a March 30
Securities and Exchange Commission filing, plans to sell its
interest in API "within the next several months."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plaintiffs seek to review the books, records and
accounting of AREP, a master limited partnership, because of
increases in general and administrative expenses of the
general partner, API.</p>
<p>The partners are also seeking a declaratory judgment to
block the sale of AREP by API without the consent of a
majority of the limited partners. Charles H. Jones Jr. a
limited partner said he and other limited partners are
interested in converting AREP into a real estate investment
trust.</p>
<p>The conversion would eliminate the need for a general
partner and provide direct management of AREP by a management
firm retained by the limited partners.</p>
