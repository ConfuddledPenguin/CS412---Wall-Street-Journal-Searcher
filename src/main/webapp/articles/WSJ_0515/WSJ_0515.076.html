	<p class="article-leader">Lots of money-market mutual fund investors are looking for
someplace else to park their cash these days. The question
is: where?
   Last year at this time, when money-fund yields were
pushing 10% after rising steadily for about a year, more than
$1 billion a week was flowing into the funds. But in the past
six weeks, more than $8 billion has flowed out of money
funds, and for good reasons.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While average money-fund yields have stayed just under 8%
for more than three months, interest rates in general have
gone up and headed back down. The temporary rise made yields
on some other investments more attractive than money funds.
Now, with rates headed lower, moving into other investments
offers a chance to lock in today's yields for months or even
years to come.</p>
<p>Although no one's suggesting that investors pull all, or
even most, of their cash out of money funds, many financial
advisers do say this is a good time to at least consider
other things as well.</p>
<p>"You have to segment" your assets, says Kurt Brouwer of
San Francisco investment advisers Brouwer & Janachowski. "Ask
yourself, `How much do I need to keep liquid, and how much
can I afford to lock in for a little longer?'"</p>
<p>Financial professionals generally recommend keeping the
equivalent of three months of living expenses in some kind of
liquid account to cover unexpected illness or other
emergencies. There's also an argument for keeping a certain
amount of cash on hand to take advantage of unexpected
investment opportunities. For those purposes, money funds
look pretty good. Their average yield of 7.96% is more than a
full percentage point better than the 6.63% average on
money-market deposit accounts at major banks.</p>
<p>Some of the cash coming out of money funds is undoubtedly
going into the stock market. After all, the long-term average
return on stocks has been about 10% a year. But the
short-term risk in stocks can be great, and money-fund
investors tend to be risk-averse. Typically, they prefer the
stability of fixed-income investments, the comparative
liquidity of bond mutual funds and the safety of securities
backed by the U.S. government.</p>
<p>Here's a look at some of the alternatives:</p>
<p>CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT: These are a popular alternative
to money funds because federal deposit insurance makes them
particularly safe. There are usually steep penalties for
early withdrawal, however, so most money-fund investors would
probably opt for the shortest terms. To get a yield better
than 8% from a bank generally requires at least a one-year
commitment.</p>
<p>In some parts of the country, however, depositors can do
that well or better on terms as short as three months. In
Narragansett, R.I., for instance, Pier Bank offers 8.75% for
three months. A six-month CD at Connecticut Bank & Trust Co.
in Hartford yields 9%.</p>
<p>"If you're going to be moving out of money funds into CDs,
this is a good time," says Edward D. McCarthy, a financial
planner in Providence, R.I. "The market in this part of the
country is as hot as I've seen it in years."</p>
<p>One option for investors considering CDs is buying them
from a major brokerage firm. According to Banxquote Money
Markets, a New York information service, the average yield on
a six-month broker-sold CD is 8.37%. The CDs are actually
issued by banks and thrifts and are insured; the brokerage
firms negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose CDs
they sell.</p>
<p>Because many big brokerage firms maintain a secondary, or
resale, market in the CDs they sell, investors concerned
about liquidity can buy a two-year CD, with an average yield
of 8.95% at the firms surveyed by Banxquote, and sell it
later if they need the money.</p>
<p>TREASURY BILLS: T-bills, which are backed by the U.S.
government, come in maturities of three, six and 12 months.
The six-month bill, which yielded 8.10% at yesterday's weekly
Treasury auction, offers a slightly better yield than the
average money fund; the one-year bill is even better,
currently yielding just under 8.2%. And T-bills are exempt
from state and local taxes.</p>
<p>T-bills, however, require a minimum investment of $10,000.
A few money funds have no minimum-investment requirement, and
many let investors get started with as little as $500.</p>
<p>Buying Treasurys through a bank or broker, which usually
charge a $50 to $100 fee, reduces the yield. But Treasury
securities can be purchased directly at no fee through the
Federal Reserve Bank by mail or in person.</p>
<p>Investors willing to lock up their money for a while can
get better yields. A 10-year Treasury note, for instance, is
currently yielding close to 8.6% and requires a minimum
investment of just $1,000. "I'd want to be high quality at
this point," says Lewis J. Altfest, a New York investment
manager. "Close to 9% a year compares pretty favorably to
equities."</p>
<p>SHORT-TERM BOND FUNDS: Bond funds offer investors a way to
participate in the somewhat higher yields available in the
bond market without sacrificing the diversification and
liquidity of a mutual fund. But bond-fund prices do
fluctuate, so investors should think in terms of "total
return," which includes price changes as well as interest
payments.</p>
<p>Money-fund investors may prefer short-term bond funds,
which invest in securities with maturities of one to five
years. Their prices are less volatile than longer-term bonds.
The 9.04% average yield on investment-grade short-term bond
funds at the end of March was more than a full percentage
point higher than on money funds. The total return over the
preceding 12 months was 9.32%.</p>
<p>Intermediate-term funds, with maturities of five to 10
years, looked even better over the past year. According to
Lipper Analytical Services, the total return for the 12
months through March 31 was 9.65%. The average yield at the
end of March was 8.62%.</p>
<p>"Most of the time, I'd rather take my risk where I'm
getting paid for it, either in equities or long-term bonds,"
says Michael A. Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical. "For
the last year or so, you've been better off in short or
intermediate term."</p>
<p>For investors in high tax brackets who want to stay in
money funds, tax-exempt funds may be the way to go right now.
The average yield on tax-exempt money funds is currently
5.74%, which translates into a taxable-equivalent yield of
8.57% for an investor paying taxes at a 33% rate.</p>
<p>There are state tax-exempt funds, too, that are
particularly attractive to investors in high-tax states like
California, Massachusetts and New York. For New York
investors paying 36% of their income in taxes, for instance,
a 5.5% yield on a tax-free fund would be equal to a taxable
yield of 8.59%.</p>
<p>Yields on tax-free funds aren't always higher than taxable
funds, however. They tend to fluctuate more because they are
influenced by the supply of tax-exempt securities.</p>
<p>There is the view among some financial professionals that,
tax-free or taxable, money funds aren't a bad place to be
when the interest rate outlook is uncertain. "Money funds are
a decision not to bet," says Lynn Hopewell, a financial
planner in Falls Church, Va. "If you're talking megabucks,
that's one thing. If you've got a few hundred thousand, I
don't think a sliver of a point makes that much difference."</p>
