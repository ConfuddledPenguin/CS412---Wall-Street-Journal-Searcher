	<p class="article-leader">For small businesses, MEWA is becoming a four-letter word.
   A few years ago, having small businesses band together
into Multiple Employer Welfare Associations struck many
business owners as a great way to get cheaper health care.
But today, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations is scheduled to hold a hearing in Washington
on MEWA fraud and abuse. "Unscrupulous promoters . . . are
literally playing with people's lives," says subcommittee
chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Says Raymond Maria, the Labor Department's acting
inspector general: "The whole environment is an invitation to
larceny." Law-enforcement officials say MEWAs have fallen in
the cracks between state and federal oversight.</p>
<p>Those and other problems with MEWAs have left many
business owners disillusioned. For instance, Jo Hardwick, the
owner of a real-estate agency in Cape Coral, Fla., signed
herself and some of her employees into a MEWA when she found
it difficult to get traditional health insurance. "We paid
our premiums, and then the problems started," she recalls.
Ms. Hardwick says she is out $1,100 in premiums and has had
to pay $8,000 of medical bills that were supposed to be
covered.</p>
<p>According to testimony prepared by the Texas Board of
Insurance for today's Senate hearing, principals of Ms.
Hardwick's MEWA, which also operated in Texas, used premium
dollars to lease luxury cars, do construction work on their
homes and buy expensive suits and jewelry.</p>
<p>James Helm, a principal of the MEWA, last month in a
deposition in a Texas state court denied wasting premium
dollars.</p>
<p>To be sure, law-enforcement officials and others familiar
with MEWAs note that many MEWAs are operating successfully
and some MEWA failures are due to factors other than
chicanery. Robert van Maarth, the Lakewood, Colo.,
administrator of several MEWAs, says such plans are "still a
marvelous idea" when they are properly run and regulated.</p>
<p>MEWAs, which are supposed to act as self-insurance pools
or as purchasers of group policies from insurance companies,
have proliferated as small companies cope with soaring health
costs and difficulty in getting standard coverage.</p>
<p>Nobody seems to know the precise dimensions of MEWA fraud,
or even the total number of MEWAs. But state and federal
officials who have begun investigating corruption in these
benefit plans estimate that unpaid medical claims probably
reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars and affect
hundreds of thousands of workers.</p>
<p>For the small-business owner, the financial danger from
failed MEWAs can be enormous. Patricia Petersen, a deputy
insurance commissioner for the state of Washington, says
employers could be held liable under federal law for any
unpaid medical bills of their employees.</p>
<p>In the case of Zapata Bancshares Inc., unpaid claims total
several hundred thousand dollars, says Laura Miller, who
handles claims for the bank holding company, based in Zapata,
Texas. (In 1989, Zapata's net income was $365,000.) The
company hopes to recover at least some of the money from the
operators and insurance brokers involved with the same
multistate MEWA used by Ms. Hardwick's firm.</p>
<p>A federal creation in the mid-1970s under the purview of
the Labor Department, MEWAs were largely unregulated by
either the state or federal government. By the early 1980s,
enough MEWA problems were surfacing that Congress gave states
their own powers to oversee the plans (then generally known
as Multiple Employer Trusts, or METs). But most states still
looked to the federal government for the lead in regulating
MEWAs.</p>
<p>In Washington state, Ms. Petersen says her office has
received increasing numbers of complaints about MEWAs. Among
other things, insurance regulators found that the person
running one MEWA previously had his securities licenses in
two states revoked for absconding with clients' funds, Ms.
Petersen says.</p>
<p>Ms. Petersen called on the Labor Department for help,
partly because MEWA administrators were turning away state
investigators, claiming federal jurisdiction. "We just needed
a federal body to get through the doors," she says. "But the
Labor Department wouldn't do it."</p>
<p>Tom Gallagher, Florida's insurance commissioner, says the
state has spent a lot of time fighting in court over MEWAs'
claims of federal exemption from state regulation. MEWAs
"keep taking people's money and not paying claims," he says.</p>
<p>Labor Department infighting may be hampering moves against
MEWA abuse. Mr. Maria, the acting inspector general, who has
about two dozen criminal MEWA investigations under way, says
he could triple such activity if not for restrictions on his
role. (Bills have recently been introduced in Congress to
give inspectors general broader investigative power.)</p>
<p>But David George Ball, an assistant secretary of labor,
says the pension and welfare office has responsibility over
MEWAs and has some 40 civil and criminal probes of its own
under way.</p>
<p>Mr. Ball declines to comment on the department's past
handling of the MEWA issue but says that in recent months it
has "brought tremendous amounts of new resources to bear" on
MEWA problems. He says Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole just
yesterday sent a letter to each state insurance commissioner
presenting a program for cooperating in investigating MEWAs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, entrepreneurs can take some steps to protect
themselves, say lawenforcement officials. Their advice:</p>
<p>-- Research any MEWA thoroughly. Get the names of people
running it and find out what jobs they've had before. Check
with regulators in states where they worked to see if there
were any problems.</p>
<p>-- Ask for a financial plan for the MEWA and get it
evaluated by an independent expert. "Our experience is that
the worst frauds generally won't show you a financial
statement," says James Harrington, a supervising investigator
with the California state insurance department.</p>
<p>-- Press insurance agents on exactly what they are
selling. Some employers complain that insurance agents tell
them they are getting coverage through an insurance company
when in truth they are being sold a MEWA.</p>
<p>-- Once in a plan, keep an eye on it. The federal MEWA
legislation envisions employers' being active members of the
MEWA boards of trustees, says Washington's Ms. Petersen. But
all too often, she adds, employers "just leave the fox
sitting there alone."</p>
