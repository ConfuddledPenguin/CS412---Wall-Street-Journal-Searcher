	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Shopping at a suburban supermarket here, amid
the low-calorie frozen dinners, Sioned Jones sees one brand
she's inclined to pass by. "There's more of a stigma attached
to Weight Watchers," says the 25-year-old computer
programmer. She says buying the product, from America's H.J.
Heinz Co., "means you're on a diet."
   Losing weight appears to interest Britons and Continental
Europeans less than it does Americans. Ms. Jones thinks a
name like Healthy Options, a line from Britain's Unilever
Group, doesn't carry the same connotation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But nearby, Edna MacLeod ignores both contenders and picks
out four packages of Lean Cuisine, made by Nestle S.A. of
Switzerland. "We British stick with what we like," the
white-haired secretary says.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh-based Heinz, which wants to become a bigger
force in post-1992 Europe, is finding that its Weight
Watchers dishes face a costly battle in Britain. And among
Americans trying to move into the European food market,
Heinz's problems aren't unusual.</p>
<p>Many U.S. food companies are having a
harder-than-anticipated struggle to raise their bit-player
status in the European Community's integrated market.
"Everybody is still looking at {1992} as an interesting
opportunity," says Charles Ludolph, who directs the U.S.
Commerce Department's Office of EC Affairs. But "realism is
certainly sinking in."</p>
<p>While hungrily eyeing the Continent's $550 billion food
industry, the Americans had underestimated the competitive
clout of European food giants, the difficulty of making major
acquisitions, and the lingering diversity of 320 million
Western Europeans -- with their nine languages and
distinctive national eating habits.</p>
<p>Though U.S. companies still show much enthusiasm,
amplified by the prospect of new markets in Eastern Europe,
some of their fears of a discriminatory "Fortress Europe"
seem justified. In the food industry, protectionist
regulations linger on despite the generally falling trade
barriers. Italy, for example, allows only products made from
durum wheat -- not surprisingly, Italy's predominant type --
to be called pasta, even though spaghetti, macaroni and the
like can be made from many varieties of wheat.</p>
<p>And, for whatever reason, regulations vary in perplexing
ways from one country to another. France won't let Coca-Cola
use aspartame (Nutra-Sweet) as an artificial sweetener in
Diet Coke. Britain and Ireland let cookie makers add chlorine
to their flour in certain products -- something no other EC
country allows. And Italy has Europe's tightest restrictions
on additives in bubblegum -- a maximum of 20 -- while some
other European countries allow up to 67 of them.</p>
<p>Quaker Oats Co. ran into protectionism while trying to
make Gatorade a pan-European product. After a three-year
struggle before the sports drink rang up respectable annual
sales of $40 million in Italy (its initial market), the
Gatorade launch in France last month ran afoul of rules about
health beverages; the Chicago company had to add extra
vitamin B1.</p>
<p>National tastes introduce more complications. Italians
dislike a grapefruit-flavored Gatorade, for instance, but
West Germans like it.</p>
<p>Europe's high price and slow payoff are inducing some
Americans to lower their sights. Two major U.S. food
producers recently dropped plans to try to expand modest
European operations into $1 billion-a-year-plus businesses,
and instead are getting rid of them, says Ian Davis, a
London-based partner for U.S. consultants McKinsey & Co. (He
won't name the companies.) Others "have been very
disappointed by the difficulties in growing the businesses
significantly," he adds.</p>
<p>Certainly that's true for Campbell Soup Co. Analysts say
Campbell expanded too fast in Europe and overpaid -- $201
million, or 24 times earnings -- for Freshbake Foods PLC, a
British frozen-foods producer with little brand recognition
and a third-place market share. Despite two years of
management shuffles and the shutdown of four of Freshbake's
eight plants, the British operations remain a drag on
earnings.</p>
<p>Although rivals contend that Campbell would like to
jettison its move into British frozen foods, Campbell's own
executives say they still view Freshbake as their crucial
entry into Europe's #9 billion frozen-food industry. But they
admit progress has been slow. "It's easy to figure out what
to do and very painful to do it," says R. Edward Glover, the
president of the U.S. soup maker's European operation.</p>
<p>Campbell's travails won't deter Heinz, however. Heinz
believes that U.K. sales of frozen entrees, spurred by the
spread of working women and microwave ovens, may hit #1
billion a year by 1992. Heinz plunged into Britain's
frozen-food industry mostly to move beyond its slow-growing
beans and ketchup business, largely in Britain, and to create
a big European splash with Weight Watchers. Also inspiring
both Heinz and Unilever to push into Britain -- and setting
off the current #20 million marketing battle here -- was
Nestle's success with Lean Cuisine.</p>
<p>The Swiss company inaugurated Lean Cuisine in the U.S. in
1981 after almost $10 million and a decade of development.
Transferred to Britain in 1985, Lean Cuisine turned
profitable after two years -- with the aid of an altered
promotional strategy. In Britain, Nestle touts Lean Cuisine
as a tasty Yuppie food while offering free 14-day menu plans
to shed pounds. In the U.S., in contrast, Nestle's
advertising pushes weight control much harder.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Weight Watchers commercials in Britain
emphasize dieting. In one ad, a close-up camera pans slowly
past succulent vegetables while a sultry female voice
intones: "Believe it or not, you've just been watching the
calories." A #4.2 million Heinz ad blitz drew growth from
Lean Cuisine last year, Nestle concedes, and Lean Cuisine
sales fell short of their #50 million target -- after
tripling to #45 million between 1985 and 1988.</p>
<p>But Heinz's triumph didn't last long. Unilever, crafting a
Lean Cuisine lookalike, decided instead on a product with
bigger portions and wider appeal. Healthy Options appeared
last fall, backed by an #8 million campaign in which Unilever
plugs the meals as low-fat fare for "healthy eaters" and
hides the calorie count on the back of the package. The
Anglo-Dutch giant figures that only 10% of its customers are
slimmers, compared with 50% of Nestle's and two-thirds of
Heinz's.</p>
<p>And unlike Heinz, Unilever enjoys considerable clout among
British grocers as leader of the frozen-food industry.
Gateway Foodmarkets, for example, decided to carry Healthy
Options in all 730 supermarkets after Unilever promised
exceptionally high profit margins. The chain initially
carried frozen Weight Watcher meals only in its larger
stores.</p>
<p>Heinz executives insist that Healthy Options isn't hurting
their sales. Just to make sure, Heinz is giving away a can of
baked beans with every frozen dinner. Officials also deny
seeking to export Americans' obsession with weight. Weight
Watchers "is seen as a mainstream product" rather than a dish
for dieters, contends Bruce Purgavie, deputy managing
director of Heinz's U.K. arm. "We cater to the vast majority
of {British} women who are interested in weight control."</p>
<p>But market researchers say Healthy Options is starting to
damp the growth of both Weight Watchers and Lean Cuisine in a
rapidly expanding market. Weight Watchers may end up with the
smallest niche, some analysts contend, because of its name
and its rivals' greater marketing muscle. Heinz should
embrace a broader thrust such as Unilever's "healthy eating"
drive, says John Campbell, an analyst at U.K. brokers County
NatWest WoodMac.</p>
<p>Other U.S. food companies have found that, to convert
Europeans to American eating habits, they must spend years
wooing them. Although Coca-Cola Co. has been in France for 70
years, longer than anywhere else in Europe, the French still
drink much less Coke than their neighbors do. So Coca-Cola
recently spent $250 million to buy the leading Coke franchise
from Pernod Ricard S.A., a French spirits company, and to
build plants in France. Another example: The French still
don't drink American-style instant coffee the way Britons do.</p>
<p>However, U.S. food makers can carve out niches in Europe
by exporting a strong national brand to countries where local
tastes are broadening. IC Industries Inc.'s Old El Paso unit,
the Mexican-food leader in the U.S., expects the total
Mexican food market will reach #16 million this year in
Britain alone. But who eats the spicy fare the most?
Norwegians]</p>
<p>Some U.S. food companies are trying to tailor their
products to national preferences. Philip Morris Cos.' Kraft
already varies its cheese slices by national market --
offering cheddar to Britons, mozzarella to Italians and Swiss
to the Swiss. Now it's trying to figure out whether -- and
how -- to introduce a U.S. cheese spread in Europe.</p>
<p>But for some American companies, a push into Europe isn't
worth the effort. General Mills Inc. dropped plans to bring
Hamburger Helper to France and Britain "because we don't
think local consumption habits will change" soon, says Arthur
Schulze, vice chairman. Over the years, American peanut
butter, Pop Tarts, certain cake mixes, Dr Pepper soda, and
chocolate candy (except for Mars Inc. products) have come to
Europe but never really caught on.</p>
<p>Many Europeans think Hershey Foods Corp. candy bars, for
example, taste bitter. And "a lot of Hershey products have
peanuts in them. Europeans view peanuts as something you feed
horses," says John McMillin, a food-industry analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. But Hershey, an
official hints, doesn't plan to change the products it
exports.</p>
<p>Such a stand typifies the once-common attitude "that if it
sold well in America, it would carry well into Europe," says
Judith Lannon, European research and development director for
ad agency J. Walter Thompson. And even now, some U.S. food
producers, caught up in 1992 hype, still "think that once the
barriers go down, all Europeans will be the same," she adds.</p>
<p>Sara Lee Corp., in its first major Continental foray,
began shipping British-made frozen pies and cakes to France a
year ago, without altering the recipes for French tastes. The
Chicago company offers a British version of cheesecake (with
black-currant topping) and an American one (with strawberry).
"We feel we have core products that are acceptable all over
the world" and customize only when necessary, explains Thomas
McLeod Jr., president of the Kitchens of Sara Lee division.</p>
<p>Mars is putting an equally risky bet on how much
homogenization Europeans will swallow. The U.S. candy maker
has wanted to run pan-European ad campaigns for Snickers bars
since 1988, when Nestle became Europe's chocolate king by
buying confectioner Rowntree PLC. But Snickers lacked a
single Europe-wide name; in Britain, the candy was long sold
as "Marathon" to avoid association with "knickers," the
English word for women's underpants. Last month, Mars boldly
dumped the Marathon label in favor of Snickers.</p>
<p>"What a decision, to get rid of a major brand name]"
exclaims Michael Walsh, the chairman of Ogilvy & Mather ad
agency in London. Retorts a Mars spokesman: "The world has
moved on."</p>
<p>Frito-Lay epitomizes the hurdles for U.S. food producers
scrambling to sell American-style products in Europe. After
buying a small Spanish snacks business in the early 1970s,
the PepsiCo Inc. subsidiary tried to wean Spaniards away from
olives and anchovies. "People said nobody in Spain would eat
Doritos because Doritos come from corn and corn is food for
pigs," recalls Michael Jordan, the president of PepsiCo's
global snack-food business. Eventually, Frito won over the
Spanish -- plus much of Southern Europe -- with a big sales
force and commercials that promoted the corn chips as
wholesome American fare, but the operation didn't turn
consistently profitable until the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Frito won't conquer Northern Europe any more easily. Last
summer, in one of the Americans' few big food-industry
takeovers in 1989, Frito paid $1.35 billion -- nearly 30
times earnings -- for Britain's two leading snack makers. But
Frito hit a dead end after months of courting H. Bahlsens
Keksfabrik KG, a major West German maker of upscale cookies
and potato chips. So, instead of buying a German market
presence, Frito may ship snacks from Britain because 1992
"will make it easier to bring products from other countries,"
Mr. Jordan says. He adds that Frito is also considering
German joint ventures.</p>
<p>Indeed, American-European alliances, which are multiplying
in industries such as cars, drugs and electronics, are
starting in foods. General Mills, discouraged about invading
Europe alone, forged a partnership with Nestle last December.
Nestle will use its enormous clout to stock European grocery
shelves with General Mills products such as Wheaties and
Cheerios. General Mills will need all the help Nestle can
offer. Outside Ireland and Britain, few Europeans eat cereal
at breakfast.</p>
<p>"Nestle understands local countries {in Europe} very
well," General Mills's Mr. Schulze says, adding that he
expects more such American-European alliances. "We're not the
only company in the world that thinks speed is important."</p>
