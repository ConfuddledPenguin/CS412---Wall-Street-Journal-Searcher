	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp. came under fire
from psychiatrists, government officials and mental-health
advocates for the price of its new schizophrenia drug
Clozaril.
   Critics at the American Psychiatric Association meeting
here challenged the company's insistence upon packaging the
drug with an exclusive blood-monitoring system that is
designed to detect a potentially fatal side effect. Including
the system, the drug costs $8,944 a year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I feel like I'm being blackmailed by the company," said
William Reid, medical director for the Texas department of
mental health and mental retardation. The price amounts "to a
ransom for taxpayers," he said, while holding chronic
schizophrenic patients "hostage to their illness."</p>
<p>Dr. Reid's comments reflect fierce emotions that the drug
has provoked among the mental-health profession since the
U.S. subsidiary of Switzerland's Sandoz Ltd. introduced the
drug here in February. By bundling the drug with the
monitoring system, critics say, Sandoz has priced it out of
reach of desperately ill people who need it most. The
monitoring system is administered by the Caremark subsidiary
of Baxter International Inc., Deerfield, Ill.</p>
<p>Arguing that the majority of eligible patients are poor
and supported by government welfare programs -- some of which
won't cover the treatment at the current price -- the critics
urged Sandoz to allow alternatives to the system.</p>
<p>Clozapine, as the drug is known generically, is effective
in treating schizophrenics for whom conventional medicines
have failed. In some cases, patients who were confined for
years in mental hospitals have resumed normal or near-normal
lives on the drug.</p>
<p>But up to 2% of patients develop a blood disorder that
resulted in 43 deaths in Europe, mostly in the 1970s. Sandoz
maintains that its monitoring system, in which patients
submit to a blood test each week in return for a week's
supply of the drug, is the only way to prevent deaths.
Without its system, Sandoz says, three patients a week could
die from clozapine, and the drug would be pulled from the
market. "The only way patients will {get} access to Clozaril
is through {the Sandoz system}," Gilbert Honigfeld, Sandoz's
director of scientific communications, said at the forum. "We
will not allow patients to die."</p>
<p>But several psychiatrists and mental-health officials
contended at the forum that the elaborate monitoring system
is an overreaction to the dangers of the drug and that it
duplicates services already provided routinely by doctors and
hospitals for other drugs. They added that less-restrictive
monitoring in European countries -- where the drug costs
$1,000 to $1,500 a year -- hasn't led to widespread
fatalities.</p>
<p>Laurie Flynn, executive director of the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill, an advocacy group of about 100,000
patient families, urged Sandoz to reduce the price of
clozapine. But she also said her group has no confidence in
the ability of state mental hospitals to assure the safety of
patients taking the drug.</p>
<p>One woman who said her son has schizophrenia underscored
the dilemma for many prospective users of the drug. Diagnosed
five years ago, her son was losing muscle control of his
tongue on standard medications. He went to Columbia
Presbyterian Hospital in New York, where the woman, a retired
teacher, agreed to pay for the initial weeks of clozapine,
assuming Medicaid would soon cover it. But New York's
Medicaid program doesn't pay for it yet. "When I found out
about the cost, I was flabbergasted," she said. "I'm being
wiped out emotionally and financially."</p>
