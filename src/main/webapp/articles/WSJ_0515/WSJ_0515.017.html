	<p class="article-leader">ST. LOUIS -- Moody's Investors Service Inc., citing the
deteriorating outlook for defense contractors, lowered its
ratings on about $3.4 billion of McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s
senior and subordinated debt.
   Moody's downgraded McDonnell Douglas's senior debt and
shelf registration to Baa-1 from single-A-3, and subordinated
debt to Baa-2 from Baa-1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rating concern said its action also was based on
McDonnell Douglas's "continuing operating difficulties at its
commercial aircraft operations."</p>
<p>A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said the company was
notified by Moody's several weeks ago that it might downgrade
the debt. "Everybody knows we're experiencing financial
difficulties, particularly in our transport-aircraft
business, where we had an operating loss of $84 million in
the first quarter," the spokesman said. "But that's also an
area where we think there's tremendous potential."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
McDonnell Douglas shares closed at $47.875, down $1.</p>
