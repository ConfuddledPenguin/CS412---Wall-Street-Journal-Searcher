	<p class="article-leader">SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- After recent purchases of nut, candy
and yogurt companies, American Confectionery Corp. expects to
report a reduced net loss for the fiscal third quarter ended
March 31, Steve Kircher, president, said.
   For the latest quarter, American Confectionery expects to
report a net loss in the range of $900,000, or about 18 cents
a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $1 million, or
about 21 cents, including respectively scaled-down net losses
from continuing operations of $284,000, or five cents a
share, and $726,000, or 15 cents a share. Besides the effect
of acquisitions, Mr. Kircher said results have been skewed by
a continuing strategy of converting company-owned stores to
franchised operations, which is reducing revenue in the
near-term.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It is real clear that the core business is getting
better," Mr. Kircher said, noting that the company's retail
nut business, which had been operating at an annual $17
million loss when acquired in November 1988, was currently
breaking even.</p>
<p>In the latest quarter, Mr. Kircher said revenue would
approximate $6 million, compared with about $8 million a year
earlier, with revenue from continuing operations increasing
to about $4.6 million, from $4.3 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Kircher said results for the nine months would be
"break-even to a small loss" compared with year-earlier
profit of $1.1 million, or about 21 cents. Nine months
revenue would be flat, or would slightly exceed the $25
million reported a year ago, and would increase to $17.4
million, from about $11 million on a continuing basis. Unlike
a year earlier, the latest quarter and nine months didn't
include the Easter holiday, an important time for candy
sales.</p>
<p>American Confectionery became publicly held in March, with
the acquisition of J. Higby's Inc., an unprofitable
franchiser of frozen yogurt and specialty foods stores.</p>
