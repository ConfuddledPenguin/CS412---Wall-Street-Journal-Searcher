	<p class="article-leader">National Westminster Bank PLC, Britain's second-largest
commercial bank, said it acquired a further 40% stake in Van
Lanschot's Beleggings Compagnie, raising its holdings in the
midsized Dutch retail bank to 80%.
   The purchase, the price of which wasn't disclosed, has
been expected since late January when NatWest said it was in
talks with Rabobank Nederland over the possible acquisition
of Rabobank's stake in Beleggings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Beleggings is the holding company of F. van Lanschot
Bankiers, a bank founded in 1737 and comprising 20 branches
in the Netherlands and Luxembourg.</p>
<p>The move "represents a significant building block in
developing the key customer segments that are vital to our
success in Europe," said Ian Farnsworth, NatWest general
manager for European business.</p>
<p>A NatWest official said the bank has no plans to acquire
the remaining 20%, most of which is held by the Lanschot
family. Britain's Commercial Union Assurance Co. PLC owns
about 5% through a Dutch subsidiary, NatWest said.</p>
