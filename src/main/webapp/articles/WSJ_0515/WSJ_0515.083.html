	<p class="article-leader">HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Two state senators proposed legislation
that would bar insurers from selling new policies in all
other insurance lines if they decided to pull out of the auto
insurance business in Pennsylvania.
   There are also plans to amend an antitrust statute, being
considered by the state senate judiciary committee, removing
a current partial exemption for the insurance industry.
Pennsylvania is the only state without an antitrust law.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, Pennsylvania's fight to keep auto insurers from
bailing out of the state was dealt a blow when a state court
judge ruled last Friday that current Pennsylvania law doesn't
prevent an insurer from pulling out of the auto-insurance
market if staying costs the company more money than it would
make.</p>
<p>The measure unveiled yesterday is designed to block three
insurers who sent nonrenewal notices to their auto insurance
policyholders in Pennsylvania. The proposed bill is similar
to a Massachusetts law that's being challenged in federal
court by Aetna Life & Casualty Co., which claims it's
unconstitutional.</p>
<p>A new auto insurance bill, signed into law in February,
requires premium rate rollbacks of 10% and as much as 22%, if
drivers choose a no-fault provision limiting their right to
sue. The measure proposed yesterday would be retroactive to
Jan. 1. The bill will be introduced in the senate later this
week.</p>
<p>Auto insurers "who have pulled the rug out from under
Pennsylvania motorists should not be doing other new business
in the state," said State Senator Stewart J. Greenleaf, one
of the two sponsors of the new bill. If losing new business
in all their other insurance lines isn't enough of a
deterrent to keep auto insurers in Pennsylvania, then Sen.
Greenleaf said he would ask the legislature to bar companies
from all other business in this state.</p>
<p>Aetna is one of the three insurers who want to pull out of
the auto insurance market. It said that the rate rollbacks
ordered by the new auto insurance law would force it to lose
about $20 million over the next 12 months. The Hartford,
Conn.-based company is the fifth-largest insurer working in
Pennsylvania, with 200,000 policyholders.</p>
<p>Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co. and a unit of Safeco
Corp. have also sent nonrenewal notices to their
policyholders in Pennsylvania. They also claim the rollback
would hurt them.</p>
<p>Officials at Harleysville and Safeco couldn't comment
until they'd reviewed a copy of the proposed legislation.
Aetna couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>In ruling on a suit brought by Harleysville against the
state insurance commissioner, a Commonwealth Court said if an
insurer sustains "a signficant loss if they continue to issue
private passenger automobile insurance policies, that's "a
good reason" for nonrenewals.</p>
<p>The state insurance department immediately appealed the
ruling to the state supreme court. Some state officials fear
a mass exodus by auto insurers if the lower court decision is
upheld.</p>
