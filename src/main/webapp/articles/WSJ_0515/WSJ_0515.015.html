	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Business inventories were virtually
unchanged in March, the Commerce Department reported,
signaling that managers are avoiding any buildup in
stockpiles of unsold goods that could lead to a recession.
   Overall inventories totaled $794 billion during the month,
compared with $794.02 billion in February. Manufacturers'
inventories declined 0.3%, while those of retailers and
wholesalers increased 0.3% and 0.2% respectively.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales, meanwhile, rose 0.6% during the month, to $539.13
billion, following a 1.4% increase to $535.85 during
February. According to the report, it would take 1.47 months
to sell all the inventories if sales continued at the March
rate. The last time the inventories-to-sales ratio was so low
was January 1989 when it also was 1.47, the lowest recorded
ratio since 1982.</p>
<p>Sara Johnson, managing economist at Data Resources Inc. in
Lexington, Mass., said the figures suggest there are no
unwanted inventories. Excessive inventories indicate that
production is outpacing sales, an imbalance that can result
in production cutbacks by manufacturers.</p>
<p>Retail sales fell 0.2% in March, to $149.55 billion,
following an increase of less than 0.1% in February to
$149.90 billion. Ms. Johnson attributed the March drop to the
fluctuating automobile market. However, she said retailers
need to be aware that consumers are spending cautiously.
Manufacturers' and wholesalers' sales increased 1.1% and 0.8%
respectively.</p>
<p>"The report generally confirms that the economy is
continuing to expand, but at a gradual pace," said Ms.
Johnson, later adding that the report "wouldn't give the
Federal Reserve any impetus to ease its monetary policy."</p>
<p>Overall, the report depicts a "dull picture," said Neil
Soss, chief economist at First Boston Corp. Mr. Soss
predicted modest growth in production for a short period and
says he believes that inventories are under control.</p>
<p>All the numbers are adjusted for normal seasonal
fluctuations. But Mr. Soss said inventory figures for the
past few months have been distorted because of unusual
weather fluctuations, including both unseasonably cold and
unseasonably warm weather.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of the Commerce Department's report on
business inventories and sales in March. The figures are in
billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted:</p>
