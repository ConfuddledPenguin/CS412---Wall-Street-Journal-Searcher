	<p class="article-leader">THE WORLD'S POPULATION</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The world population will increase by one billion in the
1990s, an increase that may prove catastrophic to the
environment, a United Nations report predicted.</p>
<p>The estimate of growth in the world population --
currently 5.3 billion -- outstrips all previous forecasts,
the State of the World Population report from the U.N.
Population Fund said. The environment and poorer countries,
where 90% of the rise will occur, will suffer most as the
population increases by three people every second -- about a
quarter of a million each day -- the report said.</p>
<p>The report said that while the industrialized countries
were mainly responsible for damage to the ozone layer and for
roughly two-thirds of global warming, the combination of
poverty and population growth was causing deforestation and
land degradation in the developing world.</p>
<p>The 1990s will see greater growth than any decade in human
history, with 90 million to 100 million more people each
year, the report said. During the next century, it predicted,
global population will probably double and could triple.</p>
<p>INDIA CLEANSES FILM INDUSTRY</p>
<p>India, whose huge film industry turns out more than 700
films a year, has ordered censors to purge the nation's
movies of sex and violence, said Information and Broadcasting
Minister Parvathaneni Upendra. Although Indian films are
conservative by Western standards -- both nudity and kissing
are banned -- rape scenes are common, and "Scenes glorifying
sex and violence have crossed the limits of decency," Mr.
Upendra said. Under new rules, censors would also refuse to
approve movies promoted by posters showing vulgar scenes, he
said.

<p>SOUTH KOREA FIGHTS CORRUPTION</p>
<p>As part of a new anti-corruption investigation of
government officials in South Korea, the prosecutor general's
office announced the arrest of four present or former Seoul
city officers. The four were charged with taking bribes
ranging from $14,000 to $47,000 from a businessman in 1988
for giving him favors in issuing permits to build a hotel in
downtown Seoul, prosecutors said. President Roh Tae Woo
appointed a 54-member presidential task force Saturday to
root out corruption by year's end.</p>
<p>CITIZEN'S EAST BLOC PLANS</p>
<p>Japan's Citizen Watch Co. will begin marketing its watches
in Eastern Europe through local agents, a company spokeswoman
said. Citizen's West German subsidiary, Citizen Watch Europe
G.m.b.H, will find companies and shops to sell watches priced
between 3,000 yen (about $20) to 5,000 yen, according to the
spokesman. The move is the first major attempt by a Japanese
watchmaker to enter the rapidly changing region, she said.
The company plans to sell 100,000 watches annually in the
region.</p>
<p>HONG KONG'S JOBLESS</p>
<p>Hong Kong's jobless rate rose to 1.7% in the first quarter
from 1.3% in the previous quarter, marking its highest level
since mid-1988. While the colony's labor shortage has been a
prime factor behind spiraling local prices, Jason Kwok,
senior economist at Bank of East Asia, warned that it's
premature to say inflation may be easing. "I'd like to wait
to see data for a few more months," he said. "We also have to
take into account what the property market will be doing
before making any pronouncements about inflation."</p>
<p>SOVIETS' LATE BILL PAYMENTS</p>
<p>Japan reportedly doubled the rate on export insurance to
the Soviet Union after hearing from major Japanese trading
houses that Soviet trading organizations were late in paying
their bills. A spokesman for trading house Nissho Iwa Corp.
said the government raised the export-insurance rate for
several products, such as steel, chemical products and
textiles. The insurance rate varies according to product, and
specific rates aren't released, but trading-house officials
say that the rate has been raised to an average of about
0.02% from about 0.01%.</p>
<p>CZECHOSLOVAK TELEVISION</p>
<p>Czechoslovak television started an experimental broadcast
on a third channel yesterday that incorporates U.S, Soviet
and West European programs.</p>
<p>The broadcast, which replaced Soviet programming formerly
available on the same channel, will reach approximately 30%
of Czechoslovakia's territory, the Socialist daily Svobodne
Slovo said. Of the other two Czechoslovak channels, one
broadcasts nationwide and the other provides regional
programming.</p>
<p>The programming of the third channel was made available by
foreign TV stations such as La Sept and TV 5 of France, CNN
of the U.S. and the U.S.-government run World Net and Soviet
television.</p>
<p>The third channel will include language courses, sports,
news, and music, Svobodne Slovo said.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Dogs unleashed by suspicious Bangkok residents have
hampered a population survey by biting at least 40 census
takers, a Thai census official said. Other residents,
thinking the census takers were burglars, threw stones and
hot water at them. . . . A Swedish court awarded Bjorn Borg
$12,500 in damages from a magazine that published an article
alleging he was a cocaine addict. The 33-year-old tennis
champion had sued the Swedish satirical magazine Z for
$57,000.</p>
