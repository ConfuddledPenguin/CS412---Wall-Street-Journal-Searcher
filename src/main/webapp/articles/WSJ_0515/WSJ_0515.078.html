	<p class="article-leader">In a time-worn routine of New York City life, each day a
multitude descends the steep and long staircases and
mechanical escalators to wait on narrow and crowded platforms
bounded by dark tunnels and high-power electrical rails. . .
.
   The subway is not a domain of the privileged and powerful.
Rather, it is the primary means of transportation for
literally millions of people of modest means, including
hard-working men and women, students and elderly pensioners
who live in and around New York City and who are dependent on
the subway for the conduct of their daily affairs. They are
the bulk of the subway's patronage, and the City has an
obvious interest in providing them with a reasonably safe,
propitious and benign means of public transportation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With these words, federal appeals judges in New York last
week renounced the idea that there is a constitutional right
to panhandle in subways. District Court Judge Leonard Sand
had established that right in an earlier ruling. The appeals
court said, in essence, that communities of people have
interests that must be balanced against rights alleged for
individuals. New York is not about to become the City of Good
Manners, but a recognition that government has some right to
protect citizens is a big step toward rediscovering civilized
behavior.</p>
<p>The court's ruling comes as New York teeters on the edge
of some Hobbesian jungle, where the idea of standards of
acceptable behavior begins to sound like a bad joke. Anxious
crowds wait outside a Brooklyn courthouse to see if the legal
system is capable of convicting someone for the brutal
killing of a young black man, Yusuf Hawkins, in the white
neighborhood of Bensonhurst. Over the weekend, near the
neighborhood where some Korean grocers are being boycotted, a
group of blacks mistook three Vietnamese immigrants for
Koreans and decided to beat them.</p>
<p>As every visitor knows, the subways are a special case.
"Begging in the subway," Federal Appeals Judge Frank Altimari
wrote, "often amounts to nothing less than assault, creating
in the passengers the apprehension of imminent danger." Judge
Altimari emphasized in the opinion for the Second Circuit
that the issue is not the First Amendment, but what society
can do to protect its members. He referred to Transit
Authority studies that indicate passengers find panhandlers
threatening, harassing and inherently aggressive.</p>
<p>Nor is there any reason to draw the line between free
speech and intimidation only after a panhandler pulls a
knife. The appeals court said the ban on begging must not be
viewed "from the imaginary heights of Mount Olympus . . .
lest a rigid, mechanistic application of some legal doctrine
gainsays the common good." The decision added that the lower
court had an "exacerbated deference to the alleged individual
rights of beggars and panhandlers to the great detriment of
the common good."</p>
<p>These are strong words, and it's hard to miss the appeals
court's tone of impatience with Judge Sand's earlier ruling
(though it is nothing compared with what many beleaguered
subway riders said the morning after that decision). We think
the appeals judges chose their words carefully and with a
purpose. They wanted to send a strong message to the activist
Judge Sand, who also has been much in the news for attempting
to engineer the public-housing policies of Yonkers, N.Y.</p>
<p>The appeals court detailed how Judge Sand had essentially
arranged the subway case so that he could issue a broad
ruling creating a new right. "Not satisfied with the scope of
the original controversy," the appeals court wrote, Judge
Sand's court "directed that the complaint be amended on
numerous occasions." On its own, Judge Sand's court contacted
the New York Attorney General, and after he declined to
intervene, the court made him a party to the case so that an
anti-loitering law would be at issue. "It instructed that
over a dozen defendants be added, and that the class be
enlarged to include all needy persons in New York State."</p>
<p>The subway begging case raises other questions about
courts and the common good. The idea that city authorities
have no power to ban begging of this type suggests how the
common life of cities deterioriated the past 30 years.</p>
<p>The courts have all but outlawed vagrancy laws as
unconstitutional, crippling the police effort to stop drug
sales on the street and in public parks. Courts tilt the
balance away from community interests by excluding evidence
of crimes from trials when a lawyer can find a technical
problem with a search warrant. Communities now endure
convicts back among them on the streets because judges
decided that jails were "unreasonably" crowded. In New York,
Washington, Detroit, Los Angeles and elsewhere, neighborhoods
have become the criminals' punching bags.</p>
<p>It is true that there will always be some conflict between
community interests and individual rights. There is no
reason, however, for the Constitution to become a tool in the
service of anarchy. The Preamble itself declares that one
reason We the People ordained and established a Constitution
in the first place is to "insure domestic tranquility."</p>
