	<p class="article-leader">UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- MCA Inc. wants to build a new
part of its business on Bedrock, not to mention Jellystone
Park.
   According to individuals close to the company, MCA is in
discussions to acquire Hanna-Barbera Productions, the cartoon
company that created the Flintstones and their Bedrock
friends, along with Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, the
Jetsons, Scooby Doo and other characters.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Great American Communications Co., which owns
Hanna-Barbera, declined to comment, as did MCA executives.
Executives close to the situation cautioned that talks were
very preliminary and that a deal was far from concluded.
However, Great American is known to be cash strapped and
Great American executives are scheduled to be in Los Angeles
this week and are to meet with MCA officials.</p>
<p>MCA's reported interest reflects a mad rush by
entertainment giants to tie up with well-known fantasy
characters for use in making and marketing movies, TV shows,
theme park attractions and consumer merchandise.</p>
<p>MCA already has a close relationship with the animation
studio: It has a Hanna-Barbera attraction at its new
Universal Studios Florida theme park and is co-producing and
distributing "Jetsons: The Movie," a feature-length cartoon
coming out July 6. Similarly, a Flintstones movie is in
development at MCA's Universal Pictures. In addition, many
Hanna-Barbera cartoons air on USA Network, 50%-owned by MCA.
Finally, Hanna-Barbera's newly appointed president is David
Kirschner, the executive producer of MCA's animated movie "An
American Tail."</p>
<p>Owning Hanna-Barbera would help MCA compete with Walt
Disney Co., which last year added the Muppets to its stable
of characters, and Time Warner Inc., which has been promoting
Bugs Bunny's 50th Anniversary and licensing Looney Tunes
characters to endorse products. Meanwhile, Time Warner bought
a 19.5% stake in the Six Flags theme park chain, which uses
the Warner characters.</p>
<p>An industry executive likened the interest in
Hanna-Barbera to MCA's acquisition of Geffen Records for $550
million in stock earlier this year. "You get to be a serious
player overnight, and you're not going to get there by making
`An American Tail' and `The Land Before Time' every two
years," referring to MCA's last two animated movies. The
executive added that like Geffen, which was the last major
independent record company, Hanna-Barbera is one of the few
well-known cartoon franchises in existence that kids and
their parents both know.</p>
<p>Cincinnati-based Great American, controlled by investor
Carl Lindner since he acquired Taft Broadcasting in 1987, is
laboring under a junk-bond debt load. Its long-term debt was
$1.19 billion at the end of last year, and a $165 million
payment is due in October. Last week, it was disclosed the
company was looking for a buyer for its radio stations. Great
American is 61%-owned by Mr. Lindner's American Financial
Corp.</p>
<p>A report yesterday in the trade newspaper Variety said
Merrill Lynch had prepared a prospectus offering the
company's entertainment units for $700 million to $1 billion:
Aside from Hanna-Barbera, these include a 48.6% stake in
Spelling Entertainment, which has a library including
"Dynasty," "Charlie's Angels" and other programs, Worldvision
Enterprises Inc., a distribution company owned by Spelling,
and Ruby Spears Enterprises, a smaller animation company.
Spelling has been on the block since last fall.</p>
<p>Hanna-Barbera, founded in 1957 by William Hanna and Joseph
Barbera, is "the jewel of the enterprise," says Paul C.
Marsh, an analyst with Bateman Eichler Hill Richards. He
places the value of the cartoon studio at about $300 million
and the rest of Great American's entertainment assets at $500
million. Mr. Marsh said he believes Great American had hoped
to hold on to Hanna-Barbera and let it appreciate, but that
the debt pressure became too intense. Lisbeth R. Barron,
research vice president at S.G. Warburg & Co., values
Hanna-Barbera at about $200 million.</p>
<p>MCA also could use Hanna-Barbera's current production
facilities to create TV cartoons. The company recently hired
a former Hanna-Barbera senior vice president, Jeff Segal, to
start a children's entertainment division. News Corp.'s Fox
Inc., Disney and Warner have been actively accelerating their
production of television cartoons.</p>
<p>One possible complication to the acquisition is that most
of the Hanna-Barbera library is encumbered by existing
distribution agreements. MCA's world-wide distribution
machinery would have to wait for these agreements to expire
or buy them out, a possibility since Worldvision has most of
these contracts.</p>
<p>A Hanna-Barbera spokeswoman confirmed that the Great
American executives would be in Los Angeles but said the trip
was for routine operational meetings.</p>

<p>PAUL C. MARSH, an analyst at Bateman Eichler, Hill
Richards Inc., places the value of Hanna-Barbera Productions
Inc. at about $300 million, and the rest of Great American
Communications Co.'s entertainment assets at about $200
million. Yesterday's edition misstated the latter figure.</p>
