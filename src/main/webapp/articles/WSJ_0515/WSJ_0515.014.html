	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- South African platinum mines are planning to
raise production by one million troy ounces, or 39%, during
the next five years, Johnson Matthey PLC said in its latest
annual review of the metal.
   This year, the world's largest platinum producing nation
will produce as much as 150,000 ounces more than 1989's
record output of nearly 2.6 million ounces, the
precious-metals-refinery firm said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, in futures trading, platinum prices rose to
$485.75 an ounce, up $2, on expectations that strikes and
strife in South Africa will pare the mines' estimates during
the next few years.</p>
<p>Moreover, dealers responded favorably to Johnson Matthey's
findings that exports by the Soviet Union, the second-largest
producer, were sharply lower in this year's first quarter.</p>
<p>Last year, Soviet platinum supplies soared to 550,000
ounces, the highest levels since 1977, Johnson Matthey said.
Yet production fell this year, possibly because of an
explosion in November at a platinum-producing complex in
Norilsk, Siberia, said Jeremy Coombes, author of the report.</p>
<p>Although the Soviet Union could well raise sales later in
the year, he said, total exports this year could decline to
1988 levels of 440,000 ounces.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, world-wide fabrication demand rose to
approximately 3.2 million ounces in 1989 from approximately
three million in 1988, mainly because of buoyant jewelry
demand in Japan. Platinum used in automobiles also grew.</p>
<p>But investment in platinum bars and coins tumbled 75% to
160,000 ounces last year, from 660,000 ounces in 1988,
because of high real returns on other investments, Mr.
Coombes said.</p>
<p>Growth in industrial demand could also slacken, Johnson
Matthey said. Faced with higher borrowing costs, industrial
consumers may prefer to reduce inventories rather than buy
new metal. Platinum sales could also be hindered by weaker
U.S. auto production, and after five successive years of
growth, platinum consumption in Western Europe may also
stagnate.</p>
<p>Excluding investment demand, supplies exceeded fabrication
consumption by 110,000 ounces, the third year of surplus, the
report said. But with such a narrow differential between
demand and supply, prices could range between $470 and $520
an ounce this year.</p>
