	<p class="article-leader">Marks & Spencer PLC, a major British clothing and food
retailer, reported a 14% rise in pretax profit for the year
ended March 31, with a strong recovery in Europe offsetting
difficulties in the U.S.
   Marks & Spencer said that pretax profit jumped to #604.2
million ($1.01 billion) in its latest fiscal year from #529
million a year earlier, reaching the upper limit of market
expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit after tax less minorities, or net profit
attributable to shareholders, increased 13% to #389 million
from #342.9 million the year before.</p>
<p>The company reported no extraordinary items for either the
latest period or a year earlier.</p>
<p>Marks & Spencer's sales rose 9.5% to #5.61 billion from
#5.12 billion.</p>
<p>The company said it was a "particularly good year" for
ladies' clothing sales in the United Kingdom and Ireland,
with continental Europe also showing a strong recovery in
profit and sales compared with the previous reporting year.</p>
<p>Difficult trading conditions and severe price-cutting hit
Brooks Brothers, Marks & Spencer's flagship store in the U.S.
But the company's mail-order division "made good increases"
there, the company said.</p>
