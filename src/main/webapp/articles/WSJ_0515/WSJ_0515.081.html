	<p class="article-leader">"Catch 22" is a famous metaphor for a bad deal -- for
example, you can't get a job without experience, but you
can't get experience without a job. Congress is now trying to
create what a few wags are calling a "Hatch 22" -- federal
employees will be allowed to wage partisan politics but still
be protected by civil-service laws.
   In other words, a typical Washington deal, good for
everyone except taxpayers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That about sums up the current effort to amend the Hatch
Act, the 1939 law that bars the three-million-strong federal
work force from partisan politics. The Senate voted 67-30
last week to all but repeal the act's political curbs, and
the House passed a similar bill last year. President Bush has
promised a veto, but an override vote will be close.</p>
<p>No one wants to deny federal workers the basic rights of
citizenship. They can vote as they like. But repealing the
Hatch Act would allow employees to become full-fledged
partisans -- raising money, running for office,
electioneering, organizing political-action committees.
Indeed, this is precisely the plan of the public-employee
unions that are driving the bill. Their leaders are
frustrated that the Hatch Act limits their political clout.
The presidents of three unions were suspended for 60 days
under Hatch for openly supporting Walter Mondale in 1984.</p>
<p>If the Hatch curbs are dumped, these unions will become
giant lobbies for their own self-interest, which is to say
for a bigger state. Somehow the idea persists in Washington
that serious policy should be turned over to "disinterested"
career civil servants. For relying mainly on political
appointees, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is getting heat
from all over, only last week for disagreeing with his deputy
who was representing the career staff's point of view.</p>
<p>But political appointees are at least subject to politics
-- to presidential elections. An un-Hatched civil service
will get the best of both worlds, both the right to play
politics and protection from voters. Thus insulated, this
force will soon conspire with the other nearly permanent
branch of government, the Congress and its staff. Voting will
mean even less than it does now.</p>
<p>Civil libertarians should also be worried, since Hatch
repeal would create big new opportunities for state coercion.
Do Americans really want the same people who audit taxes or
deliver the mail to hit them up for campaign gifts? It's
worth recalling that the Hatch Act was passed in response to
reports that New Deal foremen were strong-arming workers to
help re-elect a Kentucky Senator.</p>
<p>The only way to protect civil servants from harassment is
to shield them from partisan politics altogether. Only a
total ban gives employees a plausible excuse for not becoming
political. Without such a ban, an employee will always feel
pressure, however subtle, to favor the boss's or union's
cause. Federal workers themselves seem to understand this;
polls have shown significant employee concern about Hatch
repeal.</p>
<p>If the unions want to politicize the civil service, then
at least let's go all the way. Let's bring back the old
"spoils system" and make everything political. When everyone
was a political appointee, at least voters had the chance to
throw the bums out every four years.</p>
