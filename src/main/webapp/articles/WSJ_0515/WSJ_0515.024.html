	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- New England Mutual Life Insurance Co. hired
Robert Riley, the No. 2 investment officer at Prudential
Insurance Co. of America, as president and chief executive
officer of its Loomis, Sayles & Co. unit.
   Industry officials said Mr. Riley's departure represents a
potential loss for Prudential, where he oversaw a strategic
shift that is credited with helping build assets during a
six-year tenure. He will leave behind responsibility for
$98.7 billion, representing all of Prudential's external, or
nonpremium generated, money-management portfolios, for $30
billion in institutional and individual portfolios at Loomis
Sayles.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Riley will take over his new positions on June 1 from
Robert Kemp, who is helping to run a spinoff of Loomis Sayles
created last October.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Riley, Prudential helped push what has become a
growing trend in money management toward a looser, more
decentralized way of handling assets. Several specialty
management firms, including concerns focusing on foreign
securities, portfolios that mimic market indexes, or heavily
computer-based investing were bought or formed. Under the
system, principals in the firms were given wider autonomy
than previous in-house portfolio managers, and were rewarded
according to performance.</p>
<p>"It's been one of the clearest displays of good
money-management marketing," said David O'Donovan, director
of money-manager research at SEI Corp., a Chicago pension
fund consultant. Prudential has "made knowing who to deal
with much clearer, so it's easier to pick and choose."</p>
<p>It was unclear whether Mr. Riley would be pursuing a
similar strategy at Loomis Sayles, which represents the bulk
of New England Mutual's $57 billion New England Investment
Cos. unit. Mr. O'Donovan speculated that Mr. Riley "might
open them up to different styles and different products."</p>
<p>But Ralph Verni, chief executive of New England
Investment, said, "We want to continue in the future to
foster a high degree of independence" among money-management
operations, but said that Mr. Riley "won't be taking us into
a lot of different" investment areas. Mr. Riley couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Riley, who recently served as executive vice
president of Prudential Investment Corp. as chairman of
Prudential Realty Group, Prudential's non-premium money
management assets tripled to their current $98.7 billion
level. Acquisitions included Jennison Associated, purchased
in 1985 for $80 million. Assets under management at Jennison
have grown to $21.7 billion from $15 billion at the time of
the purchase.</p>
