	<p class="article-leader">ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Big O Tires Inc. said its directors
authorized it to borrow as much as $5 million so that its
employee stock ownership plan can purchase more of the
company's shares.
   The company said the approval doubles the board's previous
authorization of $2.5 million; however, the company hasn't
yet obtained a loan for the ESOP.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The owner and franchiser of tire stores said the loan may
be used to buy stock on the open market, or from the company.
The ESOP already owns 826,843 Big O shares, or about 4.7% of
the company's stock.</p>
