	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Market nervousness over a weekend political
setback for West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrats caused a sell-off of the mark against the dollar
yesterday.
   Participants described the day's market activity as driven
by activity in mark rates, with the dollar and Swiss franc
emerging as the main beneficiaries of the West German
currency's weakness.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The mark weakened on news that Mr. Kohl's governing
coalition lost its majority in the upper house of the West
German parliament as a result of losses in state elections
Sunday, traders said. Mr. Kohl's Christian Democrats govern
in a coalition with the Bavarian Christian Social Union, a
sister party, and with the centrist Free Democrats.</p>
<p>It was feared the loss of the upper house to the
left-of-center Social Democrats could complicate the
reunification process as the government tries to rush
legislation through parliament in order to meet a strict
deadline for monetary and economic unification. Mr. Kohl's
government has set July 2 as the effective date of a state
treaty covering the monetary, economic and social aspects of
the Germanys' reunification.</p>
<p>Traders emphasized, however, that the market remains
bullish on the mark in the long term.</p>
<p>"The election throws a wrench into the works to some
degree, but both {the Christian Democrats and Social
Democrats} still want unification" and neither will let
political bickering get in the way of the bottom line, said
Bill English, senior trader at Banca Nazionale Dell'
Agricoltura in New York.</p>
<p>Despite some gains against the mark and other currencies
yesterday, the dollar exhibited the fundamental weakness that
caused its losses Friday, said John McCarthy, chief foreign
exchange dealer at Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank N.V. in New York.</p>
<p>The dollar's gains yesterday came from special factors
weakening the mark, and the currency was steadied against
other units by underlying support from surging U.S. stock
prices, Mr. McCarthy said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
ended the day at a new all-time high of 2,821.53, up 19.95
points. The previous record high had been 2,810.15 points,
reached last Jan. 2.</p>
<p>The Swiss franc also benefited from the mark's weakness,
traders said. The Swiss unit attracted buyers because of
Switzerland's high interest rates and comparative political
stability, they said.</p>
<p>The switch to the franc from the mark following news of
the West German election results helped the Swiss unit extend
its gains against the dollar for the second consecutive day,
they said.</p>
<p>In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6425 marks, up from its close of 1.6380 marks in very
late trading Friday. At about 4 p.m. Friday, the dollar was
at 1.6478 marks, but then subsequently continued falling to
the 1.6380-mark level.</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 152.47 yen in late dealings
yesterday, down slightly from 152.65 yen late Friday.
Sterling was quoted at $1.6825, up from $1.6790 Friday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the U.S. currency was
quoted at 151.70 yen, down sharply from Monday's Tokyo close
of 153.35 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about
1.6455 marks.</p>
<p>Yesterday's focus on the mark relegated dollar-yen
dealings to the back burner following Friday's sharp yen
jump. The U.S. currency spent the New York day little changed
from Friday's closing level against the yen.</p>
<p>Market activity generally was muted yesterday by
participants' preparation for important economic indicators
due later in the week, dealers said.</p>
<p>Participants said the most important economic figure
expected during the week is the Consumer Price Index for
April, due tomorrow.</p>
<p>The CPI is being awaited as a further signal of
inflationary pressure on the U.S. economy, and by extension,
an indication of which direction interest rates will take,
said Dell' Agricoltura's Mr. English and Peter Iversen, a
trader at Shawmut Bank of Boston N.A.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for
current delivery settled at $368.40 an ounce, down 40 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate two million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $368.45 an ounce.</p>
