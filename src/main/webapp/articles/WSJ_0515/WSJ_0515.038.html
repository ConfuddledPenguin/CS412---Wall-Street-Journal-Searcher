	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Amid the rubble of the battered junk-bond
market, some powerful new players are stirring: the major
banks.
   Using banks' newly won powers to underwrite corporate
bonds, Citicorp, J.P. Morgan & Co. and Bankers Trust New York
Corp. have all established groups specializing in sales and
trading of high-risk, high-yield junk bonds. And First
Chicago Corp., has just begun staffing up for a junk-bond
effort.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It's another example of how big banks are trying to muscle
in on the securities business dominated by Wall Street.</p>
<p>Executives at all three New York banks say they plan a
long-term effort to develop relationships with investors who
want to buy junk bonds, and with companies that want to issue
junk.</p>
<p>Even after the near-collapse of the $200 billion junk
market last fall, the bankers think they are smart enough to
navigate the risks of a market where Wall Street securities
firms have stumbled.</p>
<p>"Credit is something we feel we know a little bit about,"
says Ramon de Oliveira, head of the high-yield group at J.P.
Morgan. He says commercial banks can thrive in the minefield
of junk by using "the skills we have developed in our banking
practice."</p>
<p>Despite the junk market's current woes, which began with
credit crises last summer at Integrated Resources Inc. and
Campeau Corp., bankers believe the market will survive and,
eventually, prosper.</p>
<p>But some Wall Street executives find it ironic that banks
are invading the junk market at a time when they are
retreating, under pressure from banking regulators, from
making bank loans for leveraged buy-outs and other takeovers
involving heavy debt loads. These so-called highly leveraged
transactions often include large amounts of junk bonds.</p>
<p>But bankers insist they won't get in over their heads in
the junk market, the way banks did with loans to less
developed countries or real estate developers. Banks will
avoid going overboard, they say, by keeping their junk-bond
holdings modest and trading in and out of the market quickly.</p>
<p>"It's deliberately not our strategy to acquire assets as
an asset holder," says Robert Lawrence, manager of the
high-yield department of Citicorp's securities unit, Citicorp
Securities Markets Inc. "We intend to sell and trade these
securities much as we trade in any other instruments."</p>
<p>As yet, none of the banks has underwritten a single new
issue of junk bonds, an important goal if banks are to
establish themselves as serious players in the junk market.
That's because the new-issue market has been moribund since
late last year; only two new junk-bond issues have come to
market this year.</p>
<p>Mr. Lawrence concedes that the junk market "has certainly
deteriorated since we made our original plans" to jump in.
Citicorp executives have even asked themselves whether they
are getting in too late, he says.</p>
<p>But bankers insist the junk market is too important for
them to stand aside. "You can't ignore something that
represents more than 20% of the entire corporate bond
market," says J.P. Morgan's Mr. Oliveira. "Whatever shape the
market is in now, it still represents a legitimate market and
asset class."</p>
<p>Mr. Oliveira notes that despite its blue-chip image,
Morgan has many clients who invest in and issue junk bonds.
"We have to cover the high-yield market to service these
clients," he says.</p>
<p>Because only a handful of new issues have been sold this
year, the banks have concentrated on research, sales and
trading to build up their customer base. Bankers Trust has
been busy doing trades averaging $2 million apiece in size;
it recently ranked second among all junk-bond dealers in one
trading category in a poll of institutional investors by
Greenwich Associates, a consulting firm.</p>
<p>Tim Yates, managing director in charge of high-yield and
structured sales at Bankers Trust, says his company aims to
join Wall Street securities firms as one of the top five
firms in junk. "We entered trading and sales in order to
build a strong new-issue distribution capability," he says.</p>
<p>Citicorp last fall lured Mariel Clemensen, head of junk
research, from Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.
to run Citicorp's research operation. Recently, First Chicago
hired Robert Lupo, formerly head of junk research at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.</p>
<p>Bankers believe that the research will result in a
new-issue capability that can be exploited once the junk
new-issue market comes back. Mr. Lawrence of Citicorp
believes that new junk issues, which reached a peak of more
than $45 billion in 1986 in public and private offerings, can
rebound to $30 billion a year.</p>
<p>What will make that happen?</p>
<p>Although the market value of all junk bonds outstanding
may have shrunk from $200 billion to as little as $150
billion by some estimates, those bonds are throwing off
interest income of roughly $25 billion annually.</p>
<p>Bankers believe that eventually this income, together with
funds from bargain-hunting investors, will generate enough
demand for junk to overcome the selling pressure from
thrifts, insurance companies and mutual funds. That would
cause the junk market to resume expanding, they say.</p>
<p>The big banks generally insist they are in the junk market
for the long haul. They won't cut and run when times get
tough, as many big banks have in the London securities
market.</p>
<p>"We don't look at businesses here with a short-term
orientation," says Citicorp's Mr. Lawrence. "It may take
three to five years to build a business franchise. This is a
long-term business, and we decided we should take our time
and do it well." At any rate, he says his group has made
money this year and last.</p>
