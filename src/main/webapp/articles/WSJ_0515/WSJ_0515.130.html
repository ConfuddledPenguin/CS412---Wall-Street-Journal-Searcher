	<p class="article-leader">Patrick Petroleum Co. said it has sold $20 million of
10.75% eight-year subordinated collateralized notes to a
group of institutional investors. Non-callable warrants,
which expire in 1997, to purchase 800,000 shares of Patrick
common stock were also issued to the participants.
   The Jackson, Mich.-based oil and gas exploration company
said it will use proceeds to repay existing credit lines and
provide "additional financial flexibility" to support its
continuing oil and gas acquisition programs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The notes, which are due in 1998, are secured by Patrick
Petroleum's equity ownership in Penske Corp. and its Penske
Transportation Inc. unit.</p>
<p>The institutional investors, headed by Westinghouse Credit
Corp. of Pittsburgh, a unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp.,
also include Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Co. of
Hartford, Conn., and General American Life Insurance Co. of
St. Louis. Boettcher & Co., of Denver, served as the private
placement agent and financial adviser to the company.</p>
<p>"This is the best way to continue the rapid expansion of
our oil and gas operations while maintaining the benefits of
our Penske securities," said Patrick's president, U.E.
Patrick, in a prepared statement. "We remain committed to our
Penske investments and will continue to receive the benefits
of future dividends and capital appreciation. Also, we will
profit from this fixed-rate component of our capitalization
and our relationship with these substantial financial
institutions."</p>
