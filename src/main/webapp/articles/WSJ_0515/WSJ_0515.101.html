	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- At Car and Driver, America's largest magazine
for car buffs, the writers and editors like to get close to
their subjects. Very close.
   Editor William Jeanes says he encourages staffers to be
"consultants" to auto makers, the better to get early access
to new cars and inside dope. That meant staff editor Tony
Assenza could, for a fee, help Suzuki Motor Corp.'s
advertising agency prepare publicity materials and a training
film for sales personnel. Then Mr. Assenza reviewed two
Suzuki vehicles in the magazine, describing the Sidekick as
"a well-aimed rifle shot," and the Swift GTi as "a basic,
sturdy, off-the-shelf nickel rocket."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>No big deal, says Mr. Assenza, who left Car and Driver
last November to work for one of Honda Motor Co.'s
advertising agencies. He says the reviews, which appeared in
November 1988 and February 1989, were untainted because of
his own integrity, and that of Car and Driver's editors. He
notes that deep in his positive review of the Swift, for
example, he calls the steering "heavy" and the suspension
mediocre. "I'm not afraid to bite the hand that somewhat
feeds me," he declares.</p>
<p>Welcome to the world of automotive enthusiast journalism,
where the barriers that separate advertisers from journalists
are porous enough for paychecks to pass through -- as well as
airline tickets to Japan, free rooms at fancy resorts, gift
certificates, clocks, briefcases and, of course, free use of
some of the hottest new cars on the market.</p>
<p>Once an isolated niche among specialty magazines, the
major "buff books" are growing mightily in size and
influence. The Big Four -- Car and Driver, Motor Trend, Road
& Track and Automobile -- now boast 2.9 million readers;
their combined advertising revenue ($137.8 million) has
surged 33% since 1987.</p>
<p>Auto makers, meanwhile, want every edge they can get in
their increasingly competitive market. They view glowing
buff-book reviews as a more powerful marketing tool than the
buy-my-car message in their own multimillion-dollar ad
campaigns. But as manufacturers, particularly the Japanese,
step up efforts to woo the editors and publishers who control
the car magazines, the lines separating some of the critics
from their subjects are getting blurry indeed. Consider:</p>
<p>-- Some well-known automotive writers routinely sell their
services on a "free-lance" basis to car companies or their ad
agencies. David E. Davis Jr., editor of Automobile, gets paid
for speaking at company gatherings. "If Ford or Volkswagen
wants me to speak to dealers at a sales convention, my fee is
$5,000," Mr. Davis says, adding that he makes 20 to 25
speeches a year.</p>
<p>-- Other writers are on car-company payrolls. At Motor
Trend, regular contributor Ron Grable spends part of every
year writing about cars. The rest of the year, he works for
Nissan Motor Co. in Los Angeles, test-driving prototypes. The
magazine doesn't allow Mr. Grable to review Japanese cars "to
avoid the appearance of impropriety," says executive editor
Jack Nerad. Mr. Grable does, however, review the products of
Nissan's Detroit rivals, though not those that compete
directly with Nissan cars.</p>
<p>-- Some buff magazines rake in huge amounts by producing
"special issues" that are magazine-length promotions paid for
by a single manufacturer. In 1988 Motor Trend produced such
an issue for Ford with the cover headline "How Ford Became
1." Just last month it did a similar Ford issue titled
"Winning America Over."</p>
<p>"We don't have direct editorial control," a Ford spokesman
says. "But you can understand that it's not going to have a
negative bent to it. That just wouldn't be in the cards."
These issues have a separate staff and are labeled "special
supplement" at the bottom of the cover. But they look just
like regular issues.</p>
<p>"I think it's a scandal," says Stephen Isaacs, a professor
and associate dean at Columbia University's Graduate School
of Journalism, referring to the broader influence the auto
makers have over buff books. "I love those magazines, but
{now} I just won't buy them. How can you believe any word in
a publication that allows" such practices?</p>
<p>Even a few veterans of the buff-book trade say things are
getting out of hand. "I don't see how you can report on a car
maker and work there," says Road & Track editor Tom Bryant.
"It's like discovering that the White House correspondent for
a network is teaching the president how to appear on
television."</p>
<p>Mr. Bryant drew a line, of sorts, last year when Road &
Track mailed subscribers a "special" edition bought by Nissan
to promote the new 300 ZX sports car. The magazine got "a lot
of adverse mail" from readers, Mr. Bryant says, so Road &
Track decided that no more special issues would be mailed
directly to subscribers. The advertising specials still look
much like regular Road & Track issues, but now Nissan and its
dealers distribute them.</p>
<p>Such qualms, however, aren't the norm. Most buff-book
writers and editors say the favors they get from car makers
don't compromise the magazines' integrity. "I can't think of
a time when either I or a member of my staff has modified his
judgment because the knowledge of that product was the result
of a trip someone paid for," says Automobile's Mr. Davis.</p>
<p>Buff books aren't the only publications bending the
traditional barriers between editorial and advertising.
Fashion writers, for example, are often invited to act as
design advisers and plied with free gifts, says Alan
Millstein, publisher of the newsletter Fashion Network
Report. "The wall between advertising and editorial at most
fashion publications is translucent," he says. "It's like the
skin of an onion." In fact, a recent article in the Columbia
Journalism Review worried that a number of magazines in a
variety of fields are "selling their editorial integrity" to
woo advertising.</p>
<p>The automobile buff books present a special case. It isn't
a $400 suit or $30 of cosmetics they're writing about. The
products they review constitute the second biggest purchase
-- next to a house -- many of their readers will ever make.</p>
<p>That isn't to say that buff books don't write negative
reviews. Car and Driver, for example, can be downright
biting. It recently said the V-6 engine in General Motors
Corp.'s new S-15 Jimmy "feels and sounds like a V-8 with two
plug wires pulled." Automobile last December chronicled how
the 1988 Lincoln Continental it tested racked up seven visits
to the shop and $1,995 worth of repairs (some covered by
warranty) in less than 31,000 miles.</p>
<p>What's more, buff-book editors say it isn't in the
character of broad-ranging enthusiast magazines to follow the
prim example of, say, Consumer Reports, which doesn't accept
free use of cars for testing, accept free trips for its
reporters or allow employees who write its car reviews to
free-lance for the auto makers.</p>
<p>(The Wall Street Journal also forbids those practices,
although the newspaper did accept free use of "test" cars
until 1966. Since then, The Journal has rented these vehicles
from the auto makers.)</p>
<p>Each of the major buff books tries to cultivate a distinct
character. Motor Trend, owned by Petersen Publishing Co. of
Los Angeles, emphasizes domestic models and tends to be the
most generous in praising them. Car and Driver has a
tongue-in-cheek flair; for the April issue, technical editor
Csaba Csere reviewed the ride of the SSN 700, a nuclear
submarine. Road & Track, which along with Car and Driver is
owned by Hachette, of Paris, France, aims for fans of
road-racing and exotic European sports cars. Automobile,
owned by a subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., tries
to be an Esquire for car connoisseurs.</p>
<p>Car makers want the same thing from buff writers that
movie producers want from Siskel and Ebert: A few snappy
lines of unqualified praise suitable for quotation. "People
don't trust advertising," says Kinder Essington, director of
marketing and advertising planning for J. Walter Thompson's
Detroit office, which handles Ford's car advertising. But
people do trust buff-book reviews, almost as much as their
own previous experience with a car or the recommendation of a
friend, he says.</p>
<p>That's why even Mercedes-Benz and Toyota Motor Corp. lard
their ads with buff-book quotes. Lexus, Toyota's luxury
division, makes the strategy explicit in a recent magazine ad
that shows a photo of its LS 400 sedan surrounded by
laudatory quotes from buff books. "If you're looking for a
second opinion on Lexus," the headline reads, "here are 26 of
them."</p>
<p>All of which explains why auto makers court the buff
books. Long before it introduced its new MR 2 sports car this
year, Toyota invited several car-magazine writers to critique
the model. Among other things, the writers said the
suspension was too mushy. Toyota tightened up the ride "and
indeed produced a better sports car," a company spokesman
says.</p>
<p>Months before a new car is launched, manufacturers start
lobbying in earnest for favorable coverage. Last August, as
Nissan prepared to introduce its Infiniti luxury division, it
invited about two dozen buff-book writers for a free two-day
stay at the plush Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills.
Oldsmobile last year played host to the buff press at the
Stouffer Pine Isle Resort near Atlanta.</p>
<p>At such events, it is a longstanding custom for car makers
to present gifts to the writers. During its Georgia soiree,
for instance, Oldsmobile handed out $25 gift certificates for
the resort's pro shop. A few writers gave the certificates
back, but most didn't, an Olds spokesman says. Buff writers
say gifts are usually worth less than $50, but car makers
have handed out more valuable items, such as leather jackets
and typewriters.</p>
<p>The auto makers also court the writers to act as design or
marketing advisers -- sometimes for pay. "They {car makers}
say, `Can we rent one of your guys to look at what we're
doing, and tell us if we're on the right track,'" says Mr.
Jeanes, the Car and Driver editor. He compares this
consulting work to that of a computer-science professor who
advises IBM.</p>
<p>Thus Patrick Bedard, editor-at-large at Car and Driver,
periodically serves as a paid consultant to auto makers. He
helped write a report for GM on how to improve its 1986 Buick
Riviera and Cadillac Eldorado. GM paid him "a very tiny
amount," says Mr. Bedard, without being specific. "It's not
enough to turn my head." He adds: "I do not see myself as a
reporter. None of us came to this business to be reporters.
We came to follow our car enthusiasm."</p>
<p>Mr. Jeanes acknowledges that "it doesn't look good" for
his writers to take money from car makers. But he notes that
the magazine requires writers to inform editors of their
consulting work, and to submit their reviews of clients' cars
to a "peer review" by other staffers. "I'm quite comfortable
in terms of maintaining editorial integrity," he says.</p>
<p>Then there are the awards.</p>
<p>Motor Trend, Car and Driver and Automobile magazines have
created a cottage industry in handing out annual accolades to
their favorite vehicles. Each year at Motor Trend, for
example, the magazine's editors put a collection of new cars
through ride and handling tests and score them on styling,
quality and acceleration, among other things. The magazine's
staff, monitored by an accounting firm, then votes on a
domestic and import "Car of the Year."</p>
<p>But the Car of the Year awards aren't merely a recognition
of car-making prowess. They're the sparks that fire a
lucrative marketing engine. Motor Trend says advertising
plays no part in which car gets the award. But it's a
different story after the winner is decided, car-company
officials say.</p>
<p>When Motor Trend told Nissan that its 300 ZX Turbo had won
the 1990 Import Car of the Year contest, the magazine's
representatives spent most of the meeting describing the
myriad advertising opportunities the award presented, a
Nissan official recalls. And Nissan now is running three-page
color ads in Motor Trend using the magazine's testimonial.</p>
<p>Ford, which in January won a Car of the Year trophy for
its Lincoln Town Car, is also running three-page spreads in
Motor Trend. What's more, Ford trumpets its award (and the
Motor Trend name) in ads that run in other publications.</p>
<p>Car and Driver, meanwhile, publishes an annual "Ten Best
Cars" list. Honda now runs magazine ads to boast about making
the Car and Driver list eight years in a row. In these ads,
Car and Driver's name is repeated eight times.</p>
<p>At Automobile, Mr. Davis says he and his staff simply sit
down once a year to choose both an Automobile of the Year and
a group of Automotive All-Stars. This share-the-wealth
approach made winners of nine different companies this year.</p>
<p>One of them was Chrysler Corp. The company was so pleased
that its Dodge Caravan made the 1990 All-Star list (despite
being more than five years old) that it thanked Automobile --
in a full page ad it bought in the magazine's All-Star issue.
"It's enough to make a Caravan blush," Chrysler gushed.</p>
