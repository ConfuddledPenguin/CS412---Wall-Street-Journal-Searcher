	<p class="article-leader">In your April 3 article "Research Firm Taps Oceans of Data
to Bail Out Clients," you say that with the number of data
bases soaring, "greater expertise is required to master all
the possibilities for harvesting data."
   Members of our association are trained to master the
possibilities. That is our raison d'etre. Our members hold
degrees not only in library science but also in their field
of specialization. When it comes to harvesting data, we are
the cream of the crop. And we're pretty good weeders too --
weeding out "irrelevant information."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A recent survey conducted in cooperation with the
management-consulting firm Temple, Barker & Sloane revealed
that nearly 90% of the senior-level managers in the 164
companies surveyed felt their librarians were delivering
effective service, and nearly 80% agreed that librarians were
responding to changing needs of companies. None of the
respondents saw a decrease in the impact of the library on
business. Hardly supportive of the statement that "in-house
libraries might be slimmed or eliminated."</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason the ad executive mentioned in the
article had such a long wait for information and subsequently
turned to the information broker was that the firm's New York
library had closed years prior to the start of his search --
a fact uncovered by one of our members minutes after she read
the article.</p>
