<p>DANCE</p>
<p>Parsons Dance Company: As a Paul Taylor dancer, David
Parsons always stood out from the pack with his witty
athleticism, his nonchalant virtuosity. Now his own fledgling
troupe is starting to do the same. The company shows why in
its first major New York season, tonight through May 20.
Among the three premieres scheduled are "Nascimento," a lush
ensemble work to an original score by Brazilian composer
Milton Nascimento; and "Elysian Fields," an exploration of
violence that features Parsons as a deceptively
angelic-looking demon. Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Ave. (at
19th Street). 212-242-0800.</p>
