	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Edward A. Fox, president and chief executive
officer of the Student Loan Marketing Association, was named
dean of Dartmouth University's Amos Tuck School of business.
   Mr. Fox, 53 years old, succeeds Colin C. Blaydon, 49, who
will return to teaching after taking a sabbatical to work on
a book.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As Sallie Mae's first and only chief executive officer,
Mr. Fox oversaw the student-loan servicing concern's
evolution from a company with "a net worth of negative
$50,000 on my first day" 17 years ago to one with assets of
$37 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Fox has taught at Georgetown University and the
business schools of New York University, the University of
Pennsylvania, and Harvard University.</p>
<p>The new dean said he intends to recruit more women and
minority students and faculty to meet the changing
demographic nature of the work force. "Women and minorities
are replacing retiring white males," Mr. Fox said. "We should
have more managers that come from those environments."</p>
<p>Sallie Mae said its board will meet next week to begin its
search for a successor to Mr. Fox, who will step down in late
summer. Separately, the company said Ronald F. Hunt,
executive vice president and general counsel, resigned,
effective July. Mr. Hunt, 46, will pursue private practice in
his native North Carolina.</p>
