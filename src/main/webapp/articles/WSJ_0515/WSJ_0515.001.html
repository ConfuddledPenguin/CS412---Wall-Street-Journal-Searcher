	<p class="article-leader">Malcolm Stockdale resigned as chairman, chief executive
officer and a director of Verit Industries, and Verit said
its acquisition of 56% of Houston-based Iroquois Brands Ltd.
had been "rescinded."
   Mr. Stockdale, along with Verit President John Carway, had
led Verit on the acquisition trail in recent months in an
apparent attempt to build it into a multi-industry concern
with interests in construction equipment, real estate and
control of toxic wastes. Many of the proposed transactions
involved target companies in need of financial aid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 45-year-old Mr. Stockdale, chairman and controlling
holder of Iroquois Brands, is a British businessman who in
1988 bought control of Iroquois. He then began selling off
that company's pharmaceutical and vitamin businesses, and
merged Iroquois with the Utah shell company that he had used
to make acquisitions of European companies in the mining and
construction equipment industries.</p>
<p>In February, Verit said it had completed purchase of
1,242,334 common shares of Iroquois in a private transaction
that involved issuance of 155,292 new Series A preferred
shares of Verit. Each Verit preferred share was to have been
convertible into 20 common shares, although the company said
certain approvals by Verit holders were required.</p>
<p>The proposed transaction first was mentioned about the
time late last year that Mssrs. Stockdale and Carway were
named top officers at Verit.</p>
<p>Verit, which recently moved its headquarters to Phoenix,
Ariz., from the Los Angeles suburb of Sun Valley, Calif.,
didn't name a new chairman and chief executive officer
yesterday, although a spokesman said "there is a search on"
and the company hopes to complete the process shortly.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Stockdale said that "the
direction of both companies (Verit and Iroquois) is too far
apart to be practical." Iroquois will continue in its
industrial equipment and gas-station operation businesses, he
said. The Verit preferred shares had been issued, Mr.
Stockdale added, but conversion into common wouldn't have
been allowed until Verit holders had approved the
transaction.</p>
<p>Verit said all parties involved in the private exchange of
stock had agreed to its cancellation.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange,
Verit, which didn't trade, stood at $2.125, and Iroquois
Brands, which also didn't trade, stood at $3.50.</p>
<p>Last month American Toxxic Control Inc., a small Whittier,
Calif., company that treats chemical industry wastes,
canceled negotiations with Verit concerning the proposed
acquisition of American Toxxic by a Verit subsidiary.
American Toxxic, which had hoped to get help in restructuring
debt and gaining a listing for itself on the American Stock
Exchange, said that cancellation reflected "questions about
Verit's balance sheet" and some concerns raised in an earlier
Wall Street Journal story about Verit.</p>
<p>The Journal story noted that terms of transactions
proposed by Messrs. Stockdale and Carway sometimes call for
issuance of large numbers of convertible preferred shares,
and often are bewilderingly complex, sometimes involving
companies in the British Isle of Man tax haven. The story
also noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission has
inquired about a dispute between Verit and a former auditor,
and pointed out that Mr. Carway has convictions on his record
in Ireland for check fraud and in England for marijuana
possession.</p>
<p>Mr. Carway, a 44-year-old former outside consultant to
Verit who last year acquired 38% of the company, said Verit's
purchase of a major interest in Emerald Homes Limited
Partnership isn't endangered. Earlier this year Verit
acquired a 24% stake in Emerald, a Phoenix-based real estate
concern traded on the New York Stock Exchange, for 20,000
Verit preferred shares. Verit later announced plans to issue
more preferred, convertible into 6.6 million Verit common
shares, to acquire Emerald's California and Texas divisions.
Verit has 759,853 common shares outstanding.</p>
