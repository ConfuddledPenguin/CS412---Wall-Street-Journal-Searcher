	<p class="article-leader">MORTON GROVE, Ill. -- Middleby Corp. filed suit against a
Whitman Corp. unit, alleging fraud and breach of contract in
the 1989 sale of the unit's food-service equipment
operations.
   In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Chicago, the
maker of food-service equipment claims Whitman's Hussmann
Corp. unit misrepresented the profitability of its
food-service group, which it sold to Middleby in July 1989
for $62.5 million. The operations Middleby bought include the
Toastmaster, Victory Refrigeration, Southbend, Seco and Escan
lines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Middleby is seeking about $30 million it says it overpaid
for the operations as a result of Hussmann's
"misrepresentations and concealments." It is also asking for
punitive damages of "at least $40 million." The suit names
Hussmann as a defendant, but doesn't name Whitman, the
parent.</p>
<p>Whitman announced in March that it plans to sell the
Hussmann unit; Middleby said it had sought to meet with
Whitman after the announcement that Hussmann would be sold,
but had been "rebuffed."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Whitman called the suit a "crock of banana
oil," and denied the allegations. In addition, the spokesman
said, "Any time {Middleby} wanted to meet with us, we have
met with them."</p>
