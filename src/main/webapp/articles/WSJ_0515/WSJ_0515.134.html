	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- MacMillan Bloedel Ltd. said
it will close its biggest pulp mill for two weeks beginning
June 25, because of soft market conditions.
   The temporary closure of the Harmac pulp mill, near
Nanaimo, British Columbia, will reduce MacMillan Bloedel's
inventory of bleached pulp by about 16,000 metric tons, it
said. The move follows an extended maintenance closedown at
Harmac in March, which curtailed the mill's output by about
15,000 metric tons.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last year, Harmac produced 370,000 metric tons of market
pulp, accounting for about 75% of MacMillan Bloedel's total
market pulp output. Market pulp is wood pulp that is sold on
the open market, to producers of paper and other products.</p>
<p>A metric ton equals about 2,204.62 pounds.</p>
<p>MacMillan Bloedel, 49.9%-owned by Toronto-based Noranda
Forest Inc., said the closure will affect 800 workers at the
mill and about 100 workers at the company's Thunderbird
sawmill, which is scheduled to close for maintenance during
the same period.</p>
<p>Canadian shipments of market pulp fell 13% in March,
compared with March, 1989. The big drop in shipments left
producers with 532,000 metric tons of inventory, a 30day
supply. That compared with year-earlier inventory of just
290,000 metric tons, or a 14-day supply.</p>
