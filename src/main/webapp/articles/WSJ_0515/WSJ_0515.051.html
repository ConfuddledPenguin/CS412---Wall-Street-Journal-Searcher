	<p class="article-leader">TEMPE, Ariz. -- The by-the-bootstraps culture of America
West Airlines, which boasts of being one of two surviving
start-ups from its industry's deregulation, is in partial
abeyance lest its competitors get a leg up.
   That's one spin on what the 45-year-old president and
chief operating officer, Michael Conway, says about the
carrier's efforts to get local government to build it a
maintenance and technical facility with office space and
parking at Sky Harbor airport near Phoenix. Although the
airline's original proposal has been reduced by more than
half, a $50 million publicly assisted project would still be
significant not only for a company with a reputation for
independence, but as the latest leap nationally into an area
of airport construction previously left to the private
sector.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Conway isn't shy about what he expects from the city
of Phoenix. He says his airline brings not only its own jobs
-- 8,000 in offices here and the airport already, plus 2,000
linked to this expansion -- but has a big "multiplier" effect
by opening up the area to more commercial connections. Thus
the magic words "economic development" come into play as a
basis for government action.</p>
<p>America West claims to be among only a handful of U.S.
businesses that have zoomed to billion-dollar size in under a
decade. From its hubs here and in Las Vegas, it flies to 60
U.S. cities, including Honolulu. It hopes soon to connect
from Hawaii to East Asia. Eventually, Mr. Conway says,
Phoenix can be a "gateway" comparable to Atlanta. His company
has ordered $3 billion of fleet and parts; that and its
opening of a larger terminal at Sky Harbor later this year
explain the pressing need for the support facility, he says.
The carrier's debt load, though lessening, remains high for
the industry and explains why it wants the government to
carry the building.</p>
<p>"What America West is trying to do is to keep this off
their balance sheet," says Kevin Keogh, the Phoenix finance
director. That would mean putting it on a local authority's
books, with a sales tax or some other levy serving as a
backup should the airline not make the lease payments
designed to cover the notes. And for Phoenix, in the midst of
a $1 billion road and waterworks financing and beset by a
number of public-works controversies, that may be more than
the credit markets can bear.</p>
<p>So the sides represented by Messrs. Conway and Keogh, both
blunt ex-New Yorkers, are having some rough negotiations.
Both men express optimism and a desire to avoid a row, but
the edginess is palpable.</p>
<p>"We have to do something here in a way that makes sense
economically," says Mr. Conway. "And if we're unable to do it
here, then by definition we'll do it somewhere else. I just
hope it doesn't come to that." He says America West is
"listening to" but not seeking out other municipal offers.
The decision looms as the airline also weighs buying other
"franchises" -- routes and possibly hubs of weaker sisters.</p>
<p>"I think we have to try to get something from these people
that makes us not at a competitive disadvantage with other
carriers that are getting a better deal from other cities,"
Mr. Conway says. Although provision of non-terminal
facilities remains the exception, the practice is spreading.
Two major examples: Continental Airlines is getting a
maintenance hangar at the new Denver airport, and United
Airlines is considering 20 localities' proposals for help
building a 6,000-employee upkeep structure east of the
Rockies.</p>
<p>But more than that, what gripes Mr. Conway is the lock
some competitors have elsewhere on gates and profitable
routes. Particularly, his ire is directed at Southwest
Airlines' dominance of close-in Love Field in Dallas, which
he says permits that carrier big profits on those flights so
it can engage in "predatory" price-cutting in markets where
it competes with America West, which matches the fares. Mr.
Conway says the Southwest "windfall" in Dallas stems from
legislation that restricted Love Field gates to carriers that
don't connect baggage and tickets with other airlines --
i.e., Southwest.</p>
<p>It's a familiar trade story: A company impeded somewhere
by some law or practice asks for a boost at home so as to
"level the playing field." Jobs are at stake. Add to that the
fact that a primary airline can appear to be a community's
lifeline, and you see the makings of a pet industry. Mr.
Conway spots a model: "There are tons of examples of what
cities have done for sports teams, which really makes you
wonder. Who do you think has done more for the city of
Atlanta, the Falcons or Delta Airlines?"</p>
<p>Public subsidy of targeted economic development -- be it
as trivial a form as boosterism or as fundamental as credit
allocation via finance breaks -- is an issue on which even
many of America's most competitive business people stub their
free-market toes. And, as Mr. Conway points out, you could
hardly ask for a more entrepreneurial, dynamic enterprise
than America West. Chairman Edward Beauvais founded it in
1981 after a career in airline management and consulting. His
cohesive executive group has combined aggressiveness with a
casual style; the nonunion company encourages stock ownership
and initiative by employees. Most salaries are modest, but
worker concerns figure in such benefits as an expansive
child-care program.</p>
<p>Now that ethos -- one emphasizing "do it yourself" even to
the level of bottled water a group of employees might decide
to order and pay for -- is in awkward juxtaposition.
Nationally, the airline (like the other survivor, Midway) is
still an upstart, even an underdog. But regionally it has
become one of the top 10 private employers, wielding clout
and asking favors. City officials, looking at another big
borrowing, worry about the future of America West in a
volatile industry and about Phoenix's own financial health
after a recent round of what Mr. Keogh, the finance director,
calls "strong reservations" expressed by bond-rating
agencies. Although the area's economy is picking up, it has
been wracked by thrift, bank and real-estate busts.</p>
<p>What if the America West deal does go through? Won't other
local businesses get the idea they deserve similar help? Mr.
Keogh says if they have headquarters here and a project
involving 2,000 or 3,000 jobs, they'd be considered.</p>
<p>Mr. Conway says that if some other company made as much of
a contribution to the area -- or as he likes to put it in
deal-speak, "if they put as much on the table and brought as
much to the party" -- they could get theirs. Size talks in
the big, bad world out there, and public policy-making is no
different, he believes.</p>
<p>"What is the role of government and business?" he asks
rhetorically. "How proactive should they be? You could take
that argument right up to the point of, Should the U.S.
government bail Chrysler out? If you become big enough and
critical enough, you will get assistance that you would never
get if you weren't that size. It happens all the time."</p>
<p>Yes, it does.</p>
