	<p class="article-leader">SHIN POND, Maine -- In a sunlit clearing in the vast
wilderness north of snow-capped Mount Katahdin, a majestic
woodland caribou snaps to attention and tests the faint
breeze. It is a sight that hasn't been seen for more than a
century here, though great herds once roamed Maine.
   The chalk-white stag looks healthy and alert. But the odds
are he will die soon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Caribou No. 630 -- for 159.630 megahertz, the signature
frequency of a transmitter on his neck -- is an unwitting
conscript in a grand plan to transplant this stately relative
of the reindeer from northern Canada back to its former
habitat of Maine. But the four-year-old Maine Caribou Project
is stirring controversy and raising questions about who is
benefiting, since it doesn't seem to be the caribou.</p>
<p>Some of the three dozen or so animals that have been
reintroduced died right away from the trauma of capture,
unable to survive being rounded up by helicopter, shot by
tranquilizing darts and shipped 1,200 miles. More hardships
have followed. Of the 12 released last year, 11 fell to
disease or predators. So many perished that "we had to stop
naming them" and give them numbers instead, says Mark
McCullough, the project's biologist.</p>
<p>Backers also had to suspend the "Adopt-a-Caribou" program,
a potent fund-raising technique for the privately financed
project, because the animals kept dying. Dandy, Davey,
Natalie, Kathy and the eight other caribou released in 1989
had been adopted by grade-school classes, garden clubs and
businesses, which then got reports on their progress in the
wild.</p>
<p>The schoolchildren learned a cruel lesson. Natalie was
mauled by a black bear. All that was left of Davey were a few
bones, gnawed clean. Dandy died in a rock slide, while Kathy
was claimed by a stomach ulcer. Many others succumbed to a
ghastly parasite, a worm that slithers up the spinal cord and
bores into the brain, driving the victim crazy before killing
it. Even in the nursery pens for those bred in captivity at
the University of Maine, bottle-fed baby caribou -- doe-eyed
stars of the local TV news -- were felled by viruses and
diarrhea.</p>
<p>The carnage has ignited an emotional debate in Maine over
animal rights and the wisdom of trying to fool Mother Nature.
"The whole thing has been a howling failure," declares Linn
Pulis, a member of the Maine Animal Coalition. She suggests
the project was really undertaken for the benefit of humans,
based on a self-centered, romantic notion of wilderness.
"It's certainly not being done for the caribou," she says.</p>
<p>The Humane Society of the U.S. calls it a "disaster" and
has asked Gov. John McKernan to suspend the project, which
needs permits from the state wildlife commission. (He hasn't
yet responded.) Now public opinion, which strongly favored
the project in its first three years, seems to be shifting as
well.</p>
<p>The project's stated scientific goal is to find out
whether caribou can inhabit their former range in Maine
despite the advance of white-tailed deer, carriers of the
brainworm parasite. But backers acknowledge that other
elements -- such as nostalgia, sentimentality and tourism --
may be playing a part. "The caribou is a tremendously
important symbol of wilderness" and a key part of Maine's
heritage, explains Thomas Urquhart, director of the Maine
Audubon Society. The state map is dotted with Caribou Lakes,
Caribou Mountains, Caribou Brooks and Caribou Bogs, not to
mention the town of Caribou -- where one hasn't set hoof in a
hundred years.</p>
<p>"Part of the problem is that the caribou have lovely dark
eyes, and people grow attached to them, and the media love
them," says Mr. Urquhart, who serves on the board of the
project. The exposure helps draw donations, he concedes, "but
it obscures the fact that this is a science experiment, and
experiments don't always work."</p>
<p>Some skeptics, however, suspect that "blood sport" was the
hidden motivation for the project. "The object of the caribou
caper is to establish a modest supply of another big-game
animal hunters can slaughter," charges Mike Brown, columnist
for some rural weekly newspapers.</p>
<p>Despite the mounting criticism, boosters aren't giving up.
Twenty more animals were released last month, and plans call
for 25 more to be caught in Canada and released next year and
another 25 in 1992. The hope is that eventually caribou will
fare as well as the puffin, the peregrine falcon and the wild
turkey, all of which have been successfully reintroduced in
Maine.</p>
<p>Mr. McCullough, the biologist, is philosophical about the
harsh way nature has dealt with his experiment. "Death is
part of what happens in the wild every day," he says. "It's
the hard reality that they never show on programs like `Wild
Kingdom.'" As for hunting, he strongly denies that one goal
is to supply caribou for game. Hunting could occur only if
there were someday so many that a short, restricted hunt
might be needed to manage the herd, he says.</p>
<p>Mr. McCullough believes that man destroyed most of the
original caribou population and now has "a moral obligation
to undo the damage he has done." He has decorated his office
with a painting he did of a regal stag and its mate in the
swirling mists atop Mount Katahdin. "One day, we hope that
this scene can again become a reality," he says.</p>
<p>But others think nature had the decisive role in the
caribou's departure from Maine. They wonder whether caribou
can live alongside deer, which aren't affected by the brain
worm they carry. The parasite's complex life cycle begins in
deer droppings and spreads in a larval stage to snails and
slugs on the forest floor, which pass it back to deer -- or
to an unlucky feeding caribou.</p>
<p>Historically the range of deer and caribou didn't overlap,
says Arthur T. Bergerud, of the University of Victoria in
British Columbia. He led the first effort to return caribou
to Maine, in 1963, which failed. "Caribou just can't share
their range with the white-tailed deer," he says. Where they
appear to do so, as on Quebec's Gaspe Peninsula, caribou and
deer are in fact separated by altitude and feeding habits, he
says.</p>
<p>Mr. Bergerud believes the caribou left Maine largely
because shifting climate cycles allowed deer to migrate
northward. Other scientists think caribou left after logging
reduced the old forests to scrub and new-growth woods, which
deer prefer. All agree that heavy hunting also played a role.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for their disappearance, many
officials in both Canada and Maine think it's worth finding
out whether caribou can live here now. Maine's wildlife
commissioner, William Vail, says the caribou project should
be allowed to continue at least one more season.</p>
<p>The biologists "have done an outstanding job," he says.
"It's a tough issue politically and socially. Some people
think its terribly cruel to take them from the wild and
transplant them. But it's science, and we think it deserves
another chance."</p>
<p>Kevin Noyce, a mechanic at the Irving gasoline station in
the tiny northern Maine town of Patten, agrees. "Lots of
people think they're wasting their time, and a lot of money,
but I think it's worth a try," he says. "If caribou are
running around the forest again 50 years from now it'll seem
like it was a pretty good idea."</p>
<p>However, Mr. Noyce is less enthusiastic about another
reintroduction effort recently proposed by federal officials.
"Now, ask me about timber wolves," he says, "and you'll get a
different answer."</p>
