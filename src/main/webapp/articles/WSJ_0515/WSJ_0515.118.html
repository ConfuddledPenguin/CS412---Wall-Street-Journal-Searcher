	<p class="article-leader">Mycogen Corp. said it entered a research and development
pact with S.C. Johnson & Son Inc. to develop biological
pesticides for common household pests.
   Under the agreement, S.C. Johnson, a private maker of
consumer products for home, personal care and insect control
based in Racine, Wis., will provide San Diego-based Mycogen
with an undisclosed amount of research funding. Both firms
will manufacture and market commercial products resulting
from the research.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Andrew C. Barnes, executive vice president of Mycogen,
wouldn't disclose which pests the company had targeted, but
conceded that the cockroach, ant, flea, silverfish and
termite would be obvious choices. Until now, Mycogen has
marketed biological pesticides for commercial agricultural
use only. Mycogen's products are based on natural agents such
as micro-organisms, fatty acid compounds, and highly refined
paraffinic oils.</p>
