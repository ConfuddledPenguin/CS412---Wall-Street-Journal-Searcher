	<p class="article-leader">BRASILIA -- Brazil this week will begin lifting
restrictions on computer imports and open the market to
foreign multinationals to modernize its outdated industrial
sector, a top official said.
   "Protectionism has created complacent producers and
consumers," said Science and Technology Secretary Jose
Goldemberg.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Brazil will publish a list Thursday of 57 products that
would no longer receive subsidies and market protection,
ranging from eight-bit microcomputers used for entertainment
to low resolution monitors and non-laser printers.</p>
<p>This will open the market to identical products
manufactured abroad. But these products will be charged
import duties and excise taxes, he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. has been pressing Brazil to phase out subsidies
for Brazilian makers of high-tech products and to open up the
market to foreign competition.</p>
