	<p class="article-leader">I always read George Melloan's articles. Simply put, he
brings me much information and causes me to think more deeply
than I would otherwise.
   In regard to his April 16 Global View column, "Political
Rhetoric Turned Upside Down," the reason there is so much
misunderstanding concerning "liberal" and "conservative," I
submit, is that the defining of these terms stops with saying
that "preservation of the status quo" is thought to be the
end result sought by the conservative. A true conservative is
one who must have a valid reason, as distinguished from
emotion or seeking to curry favor with the public, to depart
from tried-and-true practices or approaches to daily life and
its problems. The true conservative has learned from history
or at least has sought avidly to do so.</p>
