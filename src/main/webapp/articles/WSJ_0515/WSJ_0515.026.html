	<p class="article-leader">As White House officials and House and Senate negotiators
begin their deficit cutting budget "summit" today, the
federal tax system seems to be one of the targets in their
cross-hairs. And at the center of the bull's-eye is the
"bubble" -- the 33% marginal tax rate on some middle-income
taxpayers.
   Democratic leaders are entering the summit claiming that
they are determined to pop the bubble in the name of fairness
and simplicity by extending a 33% tax rate that allegedly
falls on middle-income taxpayers to "the rich." But
intentional or not, this is a delusion. The Democratic
leadership is using public confusion over the difference
between average and marginal tax rates as a reason to impose
a tax increase on the American economy and to undo the 1986
tax reform.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ironically, the bubble exists because Congress wanted to
introduce more progressivity into the 1986 tax reform. That
reform set two marginal tax rates, 15% and 28%. In order not
to treat upper income taxpayers too generously, however,
Congress decided to deny taxpayers with the highest incomes
the benefit of the 15% rate on their first increments of
income.</p>
<p>So, at certain levels of taxable income -- between $44,900
and $93,130 for single filers and between $74,850 and
$155,320 for joint filers -- the benefits of the 15% rate are
phased out. This is accomplished by applying a 5% surcharge
to this band of income. A taxpayer whose income level falls
within the band must pay back some, but not all the benefit
received from the 15% rate. A taxpayer whose taxable income
is above this income band gets no benefit from the lower
rate.</p>
<p>In addition, that taxpayer's personal exemptions are also
taken back by extending the surcharge to income above the
band. Once the tax benefit ($560 per exemption) has been
fully negated, the surcharge no longer exists and the 28% tax
rate resumes. But all of this refers only to marginal tax
rates -- the rate on each additional dollar. Nobody's average
tax rate ever exceeds 28 cents on every taxable dollar of
income, before personal exemptions.</p>
<p>So, three marginal rates exist, but, as the chart shows,
no taxpayer ever pays an effective or average rate of tax of
more than 28% (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ May 15,
1990). Unfortunately, many people find it hard to grasp this
concept: The bubble may be the first major tax provision ever
repealed simply because it was hard to explain why and how it
works.</p>
<p>Clearly, as the chart again shows, it is incorrect to
suggest that those upper middle-income taxpayers subject to a
33% marginal tax rate on a portion of their income are being
treated unfairly compared to higher-income taxpayers who pay
a flat rate of 28% on all their income. The higher the income
level the more "pain" there is from the additional tax.</p>
<p>There is no lower-bracket loophole for the "rich," as some
have maintained; the "rich" in fact pay a higher effective
tax than do the middle-income taxpayers subject to the
bubble. In fact, the bubble actually augments the
progressivity of the tax code.</p>
<p>The hue and cry over the bubble has failed, curiously, to
direct attention to the rate structure that its detractors
intend to replace it with. As one listens to Democratic
leaders bemoan the decline of progressivity in the federal
tax system during the 1980s, it becomes quite apparent that
their true objective is not simply to eliminate the confusion
created by the phaseouts and surtaxes of the 1986 tax reform.</p>
<p>Instead, it seems that the bubble poppers want to make 33%
the effective rate for taxpayers with the highest incomes. If
so, the bubble won't go away: It will just float upward to
apply at a higher level of income. Applying a third rate of
33% to the current rate structure and retaining the current
phaseouts would mean that taxpayers over a certain level of
income would find every dollar, not just the marginal
dollars, of their taxable income subject to a 33% tax rate.
Meanwhile with the 5% surtax still in place, upper middle
income taxpayers would find themselves facing yet another
bubble -- but this time of 38%, not 33%.</p>
<p>Efforts to eliminate the bubble have been brewing for some
time, and though defeated, they remain on the tax legislative
agenda. The idea lingers on partly because of widespread
ignorance of the probable impact of the bubble's elimination.
Any plan to pop the bubble would probably impose sizeable
increases in tax rates on many taxpayers. One likely result
of those higher rates would be increased political pressure
to reverse the basic tradeoff of lower rates for a broader
tax base that formed the foundation of the Tax Reform Act of
1986.</p>
<p>The plan the House of Representatives considered last
September would create such pressures. The plan would have
created three marginal rates, of 15%, 28% and 33%. It was
defeated then, but some Democrats would like the White House
to consider it again now. The effect of the adoption of this
plan would be to increase the average tax rate above the 28%
level, so that it would approach, though never actually hit,
33% for taxpayers with the highest incomes.</p>
<p>For a family of four, the tax increase would kick in at
about $200,000 of taxable income. For those taxpayers, this
simple "correction" -- "in correcting that, we are not
creating a new tax" said Speaker Thomas Foley in September --
would be traumatic. The Joint Tax Committee staff estimates
the proceeds of the "correction" at $4.2 billion in fiscal
1991 and $44.3 billion over the next five years. That's no
correction -- that's a tax increase.</p>
<p>Fairness and clarity, if they are indeed the purposes of
the bubble-poppers, don't require more revenue. Bubble
popping does not have to be code for soaking the rich.
Instead, current law could be replaced with three marginal
rates, but the income levels at which the 28% and 33%
marginal rates apply would be adjusted so that no more and no
less revenue would be raised than is raised under current
law. The fact that this option is not being taken seriously
is a sure sign that the bubble poppers are interested in
something other than fixing the technical quirks of the tax
system.</p>
