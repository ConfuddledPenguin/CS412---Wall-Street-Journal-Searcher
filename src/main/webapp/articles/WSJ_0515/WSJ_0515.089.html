	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The National Association of Securities
Dealers said it canceled the membership of Wellshire
Securities Inc., a penny-stock firm based in New York.
   The cancellation followed a preliminary injunction granted
by a federal court in Manhattan in April at the request of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. In March, the SEC
filed a civil suit alleging that Wellshire and its executives
made false and misleading statements about the stocks they
were promoting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The SEC complaint said that from June 1988 to the present,
Wellshire, under the direction of Robert Cohen and Carol
Martino, has operated a penny-stock "boiler room," selling
speculative over-the-counter securities to the public through
the use of abusive sales practices and inflated price
predictions.</p>
<p>"Wellshire and Cohen and Martino haven't been given the
benefit of a full trial," said Mitchell Lampert, an attorney
for the executives. "But the damage has already been done."
Wellshire and the two executives previously have denied any
wrongdoing.</p>
