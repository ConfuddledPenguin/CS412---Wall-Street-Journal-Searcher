	<p class="article-leader">LANCASTER, Pa. -- Armstrong World Industries Inc. won
three out of four board seats contested at the company's
annual meeting, according to a preliminary tally of proxy
votes cast. The Belzberg family, which owns about 11.5% of
Armstrong, collected enough votes to elect one director.
   Although the vote was not binding, five governance
amendments proposed by the Belzbergs were also defeated,
pending a federal court decision on the proposals' validity.
According to the preliminary figures, votes against each
proposal ranged from 18.7 million to 19.3 million, votes in
favor ranged from 15.2 million to 15.6 million, and
abstentions ranged from 4.6 million to 4.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although Armstrong said the proposals were "soundly
rejected," the building products concern said it would
consider the shareholders' views on them. If enacted, the
amendments would make it easier for holders to force the
board to take certain actions, such as approve a takeover.</p>
<p>The board's nominees received about two-thirds of the
votes cast at the April 30 meeting, with the Belzberg
nominees receiving one-third, the company said. Armstrong has
a cumulative voting system for directors, in which
shareholders received four votes per share to allocate any
way they chose. Approximately 83% of Armstrong's 47.2 million
shares voted in the election.</p>
<p>Armstrong said it was gratified by the results. "Despite
the Belzbergs' strenuous efforts and expensive campaign, a
substantial majority of our shareholders didn't buy what the
Belzbergs attempted to sell," said Chairman and Chief
Executive William W. Adams in a statement.</p>
<p>The Belzbergs, who have repeatedly indicated they might
make a bid for the company, said they considered the vote on
the amendments a victory, after discounting effects of the
employee stock ownership plan and certain discretionary
proxies that were voted by management.</p>
<p>Final results will not be available for several days, and
all proxies are subject to review and challenge.</p>
