	<p class="article-leader">Petroleum prices rose sharply on reports of pending supply
cuts.
   May and June projections on crude oil production by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and in the
North Sea's U.K. sector figured prominently in market
results, as prices jumped as much as 76 cents a barrel.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There were new industry reports of OPEC output cuts --
mainly in the Middle East -- totaling as much as 700,000
barrels a day so far this month, in line with the May 3
agreement. Some trackers of OPEC production questioned the
reported sizes of such reductions. But one authoritative
monitor confirmed that his figures now show OPEC's production
nearing 23 million barrels a day after averaging 23.7 million
barrels, according to his calculations, in April.</p>
<p>On top of the OPEC reports, meantime, came news that in
June the North Sea's Brent crude oil production and
transportation system will be able to load only about
one-half of its usual monthly volume of more than 30 cargoes.
Reasons for the reduction include both planned and
unscheduled maintenance factors as well as labor problems.</p>
<p>"The bottom line," said John Hill, a Merrill Lynch & Co.
vice president of energy trading, "is that only 16 cargoes
will be loaded."</p>
<p>Some traders suggested that both the OPEC and North Sea
developments already had been factored into the oil markets.
Still, the developments ignited a rally in crude oil prices
that began in European spot and futures markets and then
spread to the U.S.</p>
<p>On London's International Petroleum Exchange, Brent blend
crude oil futures closed up between 33 cents and 50 cents a
barrel in heavy trading. On European spot markets, North Sea
crudes were up between 30 cents and 60 cents a barrel.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Marathon Petroleum and Sun Refining &
Marketing Co. set off what is likely to be a new round of
increases of 75 cents a barrel in field postings for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark crude. The refiners' new
WTI posting is $18.50 a barrel.</p>
<p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June futures
contract for a WTI-like crude increased 76 cents a barrel to
settle at $19.71. Unleaded gasoline and heating oil futures
also were up sharply, as much as 1.57 cents a gallon for some
contracts.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices for platinum and silver
rose, but gold edged lower. July delivery platinum advanced
$3.30 an ounce to $487.20. July silver was up two cents an
ounce to $5.1250. June gold slipped 60 cents an ounce to
$369.90. Although Johnson Matthey, the world's largest
platinum-products company, said in its latest annual review
of the platinum market yesterday that South Africa would
raise its output by 39% over the next five years, its
observation that strikes and violence are expected to cut
that nation's estimates in the next few years stimulated
demand for futures. Yesterday there were reports of a strike
at a small South African platinum mine, analysts said. One
analyst said it created concern that it could be a sign of
further labor unrest in the future. Johnson Matthey said that
the Soviet Union's platinum exports in the first quarter this
year were lower after soaring last year to the highest level
since 1977, and could decline for the year as a whole. As for
gold, there was very little investment demand, "and the
surging stock market didn't help it either," said one
analyst.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices eased on traders' perceptions that
demand for the metal may be easing and supplies growing. The
July contract declined 2.65 cents a pound to $1.15. John
Gross, president of J.E. Gross & Associates, Inc., a
copper-industry consulting firm in New City, N.Y., observed
that brass and rod mill use of copper "is good, but down from
the levels earlier this year." Analysts and dealers estimated
that London Metal Exchange warehouse inventories of copper
today may rise by 4,000 tons to 8,000 tons. Mr. Gross said he
thought those estimates were high, but agreed that people
think supplies are rising. Copper inventories of New York's
Commodity Exchange yesterday rose by 428 tons, to 6,335 tons,
he noted. Mr. Gross also cited the Commodity Exchange's
action last week in increasing margins, or good-faith money,
for transactions in May contracts and the exchange's notice
that it would go to a full price for May contracts next
Monday. The result has been, Mr. Gross said, for the open
interest, or number of May contracts outstanding that remain
to be nullified by either an opposite trade or delivery or a
commodity, to decline significantly. This decline will reduce
concerns over deliveries against the May contract as it
approaches its last trading day on May 29, he said.</p>
<p>COCOA: Futures prices rose to life-of-contract highs
because of unrest in the Ivory Coast, the world's largest
cocoa producer, and predictions of higher prices by two major
trade firms. The July contract soared $105 a metric ton to
$1,406. At its high during the day, July traded at $1,410,
setting a new life-of-contract high that topped $1,384, set
on April 11. Analysts said troops surrounded the presidential
residence in Abidjan, the capital of the Ivory Coast, and
protested economic conditions. Also, unarmed troops
surrounded the radio station in that city, but later returned
to their barracks, analysts said. Arthur Stevenson, analyst
for Prudential-Bache Securities, said the events were the
latest in turmoil that has plagued that country in the past
three months. Another analyst, Sandra Kaul of Shearson Lehman
Hutton, said two of the world's biggest commodity trade
firms, Salomon Inc.'s Philipp Bros. unit, based in New York,
and Paris-based Sucre et Denrees agreed in separate addresses
at a Paris luncheon on Saturday that prices would rise
significantly and perhaps double. "This caused a real rush of
buying in London and New York, because these firms in the
past have been very much on opposite sides of the market,"
said Ms. Kaul. The reports caused many traders who had
previously sold contracts in anticipation of further price
declines "to panic and buy back their contracts," she said.</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices slid in a
continuation of Friday's reaction to government figures
predicting an increase in soybean stockpiles for the
1990-1991 crop year. The Agriculture Department pegged
soybean stocks at 355 million bushels for the 1990-1991
period, compared with last season's carry-over of 305 million
bushels. Widespread rain across Midwestern and Southern
growing regions, and predictions for more of the same, also
depressed soybean futures prices. Analysts said they are
worried that farmers, unable at present to plant corn and
cotton in flooded fields, will substitute soybeans for these
crops as their fields dry out. That increase in soybean
acreage would be expected to boost supply and depress prices
in the soybean and soybean futures markets. Most corn is
planted in the Midwest by the end of May, while farmers
typically wait up to a month later to plant soybeans. Soybean
futures for July delivery dropped eight cents a bushel to
$6.3575 a bushel. Wet weather provided modest support to
wheat futures prices on the Chicago Board of Trade as
analysts said that some wheat crops had been damaged by
flooding, and that wheat rust, a disease that can reduce
yields, had been spotted in Oklahoma. Wheat futures prices on
the Kansas City Board of Trade were slightly lower. Corn
futures prices, supported by continued tight supplies, closed
mostly higher, despite the sell-off in the adjacent soybean
futures pit at the Chicago Board of Trade. July corn futures
gained 0.75 cents a bushel to close at $2.9075 a bushel.</p>
