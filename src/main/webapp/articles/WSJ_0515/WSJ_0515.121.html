	<p class="article-leader">A partnership controlled by David H. Batchelder that is
trying to oust the board of Pic `N' Save Corp. said a large
shareholder agreed to support the partnership's slate.
   Bill M. Thomas, who owns about 1.4 million Pic `N' Save
shares, or 4% of the 35.4 million shares outstanding, also
has agreed to be one of the nominees of Girard Partners L.P.,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Girard holds 6.6% of Pic `N' Save.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Thomas, who is in his mid-50s, was the company's
executive vice president and chief financial officer for
about eight years until April 1987. The partnership has
nominated four other men to the company's seven-member board.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Dominguez, Calif.-based discount
retailer declined to comment.</p>
<p>Girard has been soliciting consents from holders in
support of its slate and has said it is seeking access to the
company's nonpublic financial information to make a bid to
acquire the company. Girard also has threatened a proxy
contest at the June 20 annual meeting.</p>
