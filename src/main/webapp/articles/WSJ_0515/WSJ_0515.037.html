	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The shake-up at the Justice Department
continued as Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's top aide,
Robert Ross, said he will resign and chief spokesman David
Runkel was moved to an advisory role in which he won't deal
directly with the media.
   The moves clear the way for Assistant Attorney General
William Barr to become the department's No. 2 official with
broad authority over its day-to-day operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Department officials close to Mr. Thornburgh portrayed the
latest personnel maneuvers as signaling the diminution of the
authority of the attorney general's inner circle of personal
aides, some of whom have served him since his two terms as
governor of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Messrs. Ross and Runkel, among other Thornburgh aides,
have been criticized within the department and on Capitol
Hill as inexperienced in national politics and excessively
concerned with their boss's political fortunes.</p>
<p>"This has the effect, though it wasn't the sole goal, of
opening up the department," said one senior official who is
close to Mr. Thornburgh but who refused to be quoted by name.
"The attorney general is not insensitive to the `palace
guard' charges that have been made."</p>
<p>"We're now in a position to get the management structure
the way we wanted it," said Mr. Ross, who served first as
deputy counsel and then as chief of staff on Mr. Thornburgh's
gubernatorial team. Mr. Ross, who previously indicated he
intended to stay at the department for only a short period,
left his job voluntarily and will complete a reorganization
of the department's international office before returning to
private law practice in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Mr. Thornburgh's staff shuffling reflects continuing
political difficulties that have plagued him since he took
office in August 1988. On Friday, Donald Ayer, deputy
attorney general, announced his resignation after six months
on the job. Even though he officially was the department's
No. 2 official, Mr. Ayer found himself outranked in practice
by Mr. Ross. Mr. Barr was nominated to succeed him as deputy
attorney general.</p>
<p>Last year, Mr. Thornburgh's first choice for the deputy
job, Robert Fiske, was forced to withdraw from consideration
when conservatives attacked his role with the American Bar
Association committee that evaluates potential federal
judicial nominees.</p>
<p>Mr. Thornburgh apparently decided to reassign Mr. Runkel
because he is concerned about numerous news reports about his
political setbacks. Mr. Runkel, whose successor wasn't named,
will stay on, at least in the near term, to advise the
attorney general on "long-term public relations" matters. Mr.
Runkel declined to comment.</p>
<p>The new Thornburgh team plans to "reconsider" the attorney
general's clampdown on dissemination of information about
department actions and policies, according to some officials.
The policy has prompted protests from reporters and
lawmakers.</p>
<p>Officials close to Mr. Thornburgh said the attorney
general always had intended to reduce the role of his
personal staff after an initial transition period. This
process was delayed, according to the officials, because of
the Fiske defeat and the attorney general's concern that Mr.
Ayer asserted too much independence. The attorney general is
also said to have been unhappy about the way Mr. Ayer handled
several assignments that resulted in public criticism of the
Justice Department.</p>
<p>Mr. Barr, considered tough and skilled by allies and foes,
isn't expected to encounter significant opposition when he
goes before the Senate for confirmation. In his current post
as an assistant attorney general, he has stirred controversy
as pointman for the administration's efforts to enact a
constitutional amendment banning flag-burning and as author
of official legal opinions authorizing expanded international
police activities by U.S. law-enforcement agents and
soldiers.</p>
<p>Officials close to Mr. Thornburgh portrayed Mr. Barr as
having quickly forged a close working relationship with the
attorney general since taking over the Justice Department's
Office of Legal Counsel last year.</p>
<p>A former legislative aide for the Central Intelligence
Agency and domestic policy adviser in the Reagan White House,
Mr. Barr has aggressively defended the executive branch's
authority against purported infringement by Congress -- a
favorite issue for both Mr. Thornburgh and President Bush.</p>
