	<p class="article-leader">Swiss Bank Corp., Switzerland's second-largest bank, said
it has a 49% stake in the financial company Unigestion SA of
Geneva with the acquisition of a nonlisted stake of
registered shares.
   Unigestion, in turn, has a 49.9% voting stake, through a
subsidiary, in the medium-sized Swiss bank Banca della
Svizzera Italiana.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>No other details were given, pending a news conference set
for today in Zurich.</p>
<p>The transaction continues a consolidation in the Swiss
banking industry.</p>
<p>Analysts suggested that Unigestion had problems in
absorbing the costs of obtaining its indirect controlling
stake in Banca della Svizzera Italiana.</p>
<p>Analysts speculated that the 49% stake in Unigestion may
give the big Swiss bank enough control to influence
Unigestion's management.</p>
