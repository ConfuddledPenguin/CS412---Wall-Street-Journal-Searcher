	<h3>Law: `False Impressions' Can Spur Libel Suits, Even if News Media Get the Facts Right</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">For media companies, the truth has long been considered
the best defense in a libel suit. But it may not be enough
anymore.
   In a growing number of cases, public figures are suing on
grounds that an article created a false impression, even if
each statement taken separately was true. And recently,
juries have shown a willingness to grant big awards in such
cases.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Media defense lawyers contend the suits have the potential
to chill debate about matters of public interest. Defending a
false-impression suit "is like trying to nail a jellyfish to
the wall," says Richard Winfield, a partner and First
Amendment lawyer with Rogers & Wells, New York. "Impressions
are amorphous and imprecise."</p>
<p>Lawyers for public figures, however, contend that news
organizations use that argument as a shield for publishing
unfair stories on sensational topics. These lawyers maintain
that the courts never intended to protect news organizations
when a story conveys an incorrect impression. They say courts
have gone too far in allowing reporters to hide behind the
First Amendment while hinting at wrongdoing that can ruin a
person's reputation.</p>
<p>Courts have ruled both ways on the issue, and the Supreme
Court has never expressly ruled on liability in
false-impression cases. But the high court may get a chance
to decide the issue in a closely watched case against the
Duluth, Minn., News-Tribune that Minnesota's Supreme Court
ruled on last week.</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that public figures can't
win a libel case unless they prove that a statement was
false, defamatory and published with knowledge of its
falseness or reckless disregard of whether it was true or
false. So when a state court jury in Duluth ruled against the
Duluth newspaper two years ago in a false-impression suit, "I
was shocked," says Thomas R. Thibodeau, a partner in the
Duluth law firm of Johnson, Killen, Thibodeau & Seiler, and a
lawyer for the newspaper. "At trial, the plaintiff had
testified that every statement in the articles was true."</p>
<p>The plaintiff, Donald J. Diesen, former county attorney
for Carlton County, Minn., alleged that he had been defamed
by implication. He claimed the newspaper's series concerning
his handling of domestic-abuse cases left the impression that
he wasn't enforcing the law when it came to assaults on
women. The jury awarded him more than $750,000.</p>
<p>Last week, the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed the lower
court's decision, ruling that public officials can't
generally prevail in false-impression suits. The court held
that because the articles contained true statements or
opinions, any implications were constitutionally protected
criticism of a public official.</p>
<p>Patrick T. Tierney, a lawyer for Mr. Diesen and a partner
with Collins, Buckley, Sauntry & Haugh, St. Paul, Minn.,
says, "There is great concern about what the media will now
be able to do to public officials. As long as each sentence
is accurate when read out of context, the media can string
together a series of sentences that intentionally and
deliberately create a false impression." Mr. Tierney plans to
appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The decision by Minnesota's highest court was hardly
definitive. Mr. Thibodeau, the newspaper's lawyer, says the
court didn't completely bar false-impression suits in cases
where it can be shown that a reporter omitted facts that
might have changed the tenor of a story.</p>
<p>Showing that reporters intended to convey a false
impression is the strategy of entertainer Wayne Newton in his
legal battle with General Electric Co.'s National
Broadcasting Co. unit. The suit, pending before federal
appeals court in Pasadena, Calif., has drawn the attention of
libel specialists because Mr. Newton was awarded $19.2
million in damages by a jury in Las Vegas, Nev., federal
district court in 1986. The judge later reduced the award to
$5.3 million, holding that Mr. Newton's reputation and income
hadn't been harmed as much as the jury had found.</p>
<p>The case concerns an Oct. 6, 1980, segment on NBC's
evening news titled "Wayne Newton and the Law." Mr. Newton
argued that the NBC report created the impression that he had
received financial assistance from organized-crime figures to
finance the purchase of a hotel. Among other things, he cited
the reporters' failure to include the fact that he received a
bank loan to finance the purchase.</p>
<p>"If you have hot news and put together a story that leaves
an impression, that's not actionable," says Morton Galane,
Mr. Newton's lawyer. "But they had a long time to work on the
broadcast and must take responsibility for the clear
impression they conveyed."</p>
<p>Floyd Abrams, a partner with the New York law firm of
Cahill Gordon & Reindel who represents NBC, has asked the
appeals court to rule that public figures can't win a libel
suit based on alleged impressions -- regardless of whether
the journalist intended to convey an innuendo. "The Newton
case is an example of how juries move quickly from the
proposition that an impression was left to the fact that the
reporter must have meant to leave it," Mr. Abrams says.</p>
<p>He concedes that barring all such suits may mean that some
journalists escape the consequences of irresponsible
behavior. "But there is a major social cost in allowing the
suits to proceed," he says. "It will chill reporting about
public figures and issues of public concern."</p>
<p>Some suits call into question a news organization's entire
editing process. Joseph Locricchio and Gary Francell, former
owners of the Pine Knob entertainment complex in Clarkston,
Mich., sued the Detroit News in 1980 in state court in Wayne
County, alleging that a series of front-page articles in the
newspaper had left the impression that they were members of
organized crime.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs said their complaints weren't necessarily
based on specific false statements in the stories. Instead,
they argued that the articles in their entirety -- including
the pictures and headlines -- had left the impression that
they were engaged in criminal conduct. ("Is It Mafia?" the
main headline asked.) They alleged that as a result of the
articles, they were unable to obtain financing and were
forced to file for bankruptcy-court protection.</p>
<p>In 1985, the jury awarded Mr. Francell $3 million but
awarded nothing to Mr. Locricchio. The case is pending before
the Michigan Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In another case, Eric A. Foretich, the former husband of
Elizabeth Morgan, recently filed a libel suit against Glamour
magazine and others, alleging that an article about his
widely publicized custody battle left the impression that he
had sexually abused his daughter Hilary.</p>
<p>Dr. Morgan has claimed that her former husband sexually
abused Hilary, a charge he denies. A judge said the evidence
was inconclusive.</p>
<p>In his suit, filed last October in federal district court
in Washington, D.C., Dr. Foretich alleges that some
statements in Glamour's November 1988 issue were false and
defamatory. At the heart of the case, says his lawyer, Elaine
Mittleman, is the contention that while "no one comes out and
says he sexually abused his daughter," the article leaves
that impression.</p>
<p>"Glamour named Dr. Morgan `mother of the year' for
protecting a child from sexual abuse," says Ms. Mittleman.
"Who says that's true? Dr. Morgan hasn't prevailed in court."</p>
<p>But Roslyn A. Mazer, a partner with the Washington law
firm of Dickstein, Shapiro & Morin and an attorney for
Glamour, says much of the article was based on sworn court
testimony. "To accurately report on what someone said doesn't
create a basis for liability under a false-impression theory
or any other," she says.</p>
