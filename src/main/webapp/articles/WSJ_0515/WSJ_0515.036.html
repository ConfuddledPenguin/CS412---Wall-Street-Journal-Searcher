	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Gregory M. Kipnis, who helped run Morgan
Stanley & Co.'s high-tech trading unit, resigned from the
firm yesterday to join County NatWest Ltd.
   Mr. Kipnis, 49 years old, who was a principal at Morgan
Stanley, will join County NatWest as an executive director in
charge of the British broker-dealer's world-wide proprietary
trading and risk management. He will be based in London.
County NatWest has been aggressively building up its equity
operations this year; the dealer has hired several former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. employees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lately, Mr. Kipnis was responsible for distributing some
of the technology developed by Morgan's Analytical
Proprietary Trading unit to the other trading departments
around the firm. Mr. Kipnis's departure follows the
resignation of Nunzio Tartaglia, the former director of the
Analytical Proprietary Trading unit, eight months ago.</p>
