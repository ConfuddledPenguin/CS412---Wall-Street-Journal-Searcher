	<p class="article-leader">In his April 11 Rule of Law column, "The Good News Is
There Are No More `Frivolous Lawsuits,'" L. Gordon Crovitz
argues for adoption of "English rule" on legal costs, whereby
plaintiffs who lose in court are forced to pay defense costs
and attorneys' fees. This country has never accepted such a
doctrine because of the chilling effect it would have on
victims' rights to obtain fair compensation in court. Even
those with strong cases would fear pursuing a legitimate
claim, on the chance they would lose and be economically
devastated by having to pay legal costs on top of medical
bills.
   Mr. Crovitz should review the article published in this
newspaper on May 15, 1986, by James L. Gattuso of the
conservative Heritage Foundation. Mr. Gattuso demonstrates
that far from encouraging frivolous filings, as Mr. Crovitz
argues, the contingency-fee system actually screens out
baseless suits. Since plaintiff attorneys get paid only upon
winning, they have no incentive to file or drag out
insignificant lawsuits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The contingency-fee system and the absence of draconian
measures such as the "English rule" have served to make our
civil-justice system the global model for emerging
democracies throughout the world. At least the sick and
injured have a chance for justice here. The same can't be
said for citizens of most other nations.</p>
