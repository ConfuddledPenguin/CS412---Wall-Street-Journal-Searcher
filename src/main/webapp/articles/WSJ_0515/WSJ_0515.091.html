	<p class="article-leader">J.C. Penney Co., Dallas, said it will purchase from NCR
Corp., Dayton, Ohio, more than $45 million in point-of-sale
workstation systems this year as part of a three-year project
to upgrade terminals in about 1,400 stores nationwide.
   Penney began the project last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The companies said the new system, among other things,
allows Penney to replace the traditional charge slip with a
single sales slip printed by the computer and signed by the
customer.</p>
