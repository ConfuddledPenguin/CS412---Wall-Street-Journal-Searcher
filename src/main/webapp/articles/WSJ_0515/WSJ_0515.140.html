	<p class="article-leader">WESTWOOD, Mass. -- LTX Corp. said it expects results for
its third quarter ended April 30 to show a narrower loss than
the $5.1 million, or 52 cents a share, recorded in the second
quarter.
   Graham Miller, chairman and president, said the maker of
semiconductor testing equipment also expects to post "better
revenues," compared with $33.9 million in the second quarter.
If the current trend continues, he said, the company "could
be {at} break-even in two quarters" from now.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the quarter ended April 30, 1989, LTX had a loss of $19
million, or $1.97 a share, on sales of $25.1 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller's remarks came at a news conference to announce
a formal agreement under which Sumitomo Metal Industries
Ltd., Osaka, Japan will pay $12 million for a 49.5% stake in
LTX's Japanese subsidiary. Sumitomo will pay another $12
million for a stake of about 13% in LTX, including 1.5
million common shares and debentures convertible into an
additional 1.5 million shares, at $4.25 a share.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller said LTX began looking for an established
Japanese partner three years ago, after LTX decided to pursue
the market for testing of digital semiconductors in Japan, a
larger market than that for analog devices, which had been
the company's usual strength. The company didn't have a need
for capital at that time, Mr. Miller said. But he said that
it was "fortuitous" that Sumitomo was able to supply capital
at a time when LTX is trying to recoup from a year of red
ink.</p>
<p>Shigehiko Hashimoto, general manager of Sumitomo Metal's
new business division, said the investment in LTX represents
part of Sumitomo's effort to diversify into electronics and
other businesses, from its steelmaking base. Sumitomo Metal
had sales of about $8 billion in the year ended March 31,
1989.</p>
