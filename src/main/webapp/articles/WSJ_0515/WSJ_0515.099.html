	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Diamandis Communications Inc., a unit of
French publisher Hachette S.A., said it plans to sell Woman's
Day, one of the largest circulation women's magazines in the
U.S.
   Hachette declined to say what price it is seeking for
Woman's Day, which it said had operating profit in 1989 of
more than $25 million. Investment bankers and publishing
industry consultants said the magazine could fetch between
$175 million and $200 million, based on a multiple of between
seven and eight times its operating profit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Hachette is selling Woman's Day at a difficult time.
The magazine's ad pages are down about 15% below last year's
level, reflecting a general slump in magazine advertising.
And many big publishers are backing away from their buying
sprees of recent years.</p>
<p>Didier Guerin, the president of Hachette's U.S.
subsidiary, Hachette Publications Inc., said "When we
acquired Diamandis two years ago, we took on a lot of debt.
It's good to reduce that debt. And we want to concentrate on
special interest magazines in the U.S. and magazines with an
international appeal, such as Elle."</p>
<p>Woman's Day, with an average circulation of just under
five million, is one of the so-called Seven Sisters women's
magazines. It isn't the classiest, selling mostly single
issue copies in supermarkets, but it is solidly profitable,
said publisher Bob Mate, and reaches roughly one in four
American women. As a very large, mass-oriented publication,
Woman's Day is quite different from the other tightly
targeted magazines published by Diamandis, which include Road
& Track, Car and Driver and Popular Photography.</p>
<p>Investment bankers speculate that possible buyers for
Woman's Day include the owners of the other six "sisters,"
including Hearst Corp., which publishes Good Housekeeping and
Redbook. New York Times Co., which publishes Family Circle,
just bought McCall's last year and isn't expected to be in
the market again so soon. Meredith Corp. owns Ladies' Home
Journal and Better Homes & Gardens. Some say Cahners
Publishing Co., a unit of Britain's giant Reed International
PLC, is a potential buyer because it owns similar
publications in England and is expanding in the U.S.</p>
<p>Dan McNamee, a media consultant, said Diamandis has been
"quietly discussing the prospect" of selling Woman's Day for
at least six months. Mr. McNamee agrees that "it's a bad fit
for Diamandis, which has a slew of special-interest titles."
Despite the fact that magazines are selling for lower
multiples than they were a year ago and the weakness of the
advertising market, Mr. McNamee said he expects Woman's Day
to find a buyer. "I think the franchise is still strong,
though whoever buys it may need to invest some money," said
Mr. McNamee.</p>
<p>Included in the sale, which is being handled by investment
bankers Veronis, Suhler & Associates Inc., will be 21 Woman's
Day Specials, single-subject special magazines on such topics
as home decorating and health. A spokesman said the company
sells about six million copies of the special issues a year,
for annual revenue of about $15 million.</p>
<p>Hachette bought Diamandis in 1988 for $712 million, which
included 13 publications.</p>
