	<p class="article-leader">ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Curtice-Burns Foods Inc. said several
of its divisions will be consolidated under William Petty,
who is executive vice president of this food concern.
   Effective June 1, Mr. Petty, 58 years old, also will
become chief executive of the company's Comstock Michigan
Fruit division, succeeding Robert Silkett, 60, who is
retiring. Several other divisions will report to Mr. Petty,
including the company's Nalley's division, Brooks Food
division, Farman Brothers Pickle Co. and Lucca Packing Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Curtice said the reorganization of its top management
structure is aimed at improving its performance and will
allow the company to respond more quickly to market demands.</p>
<p>As reported, Curtice-Burns reported a 25% decline in net
income for the fiscal nine months and said it expects lower
earnings for the year ending June 30 because of plant and
administrative consolidations and unfavorable crop
conditions.</p>
<p>Curtice said Tommy Murray, 50, who was named chief
executive of its newly formed snack foods group last
November, will be reporting to David J. McDonald, president
and chief executive of Curtice-Burns. The snack group is made
up of the Snyder's and Hiland divisions, Tim's Cascade Chips
and the Nalley's U.S. Snack Food unit.</p>
<p>Other divisions reporting to Mr. McDonald are Southern
Frozen Foods, National Oats Co. and the meat snack group, the
company said.</p>
