	<p class="article-leader">A small Houston biotechnology company said it agreed with
Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Ciba-Geigy Ltd. to jointly
develop monoclonal antibody products for treating certain
allergies.
   The company, privately held Tanox Biosystems Inc., said
the two companies will merge their research on ways to
eliminate from the blood and suppress further production of a
substance called immunoglobulin E. That substance seems to
exacerbate allergic reactions such as hay fever, asthma and
insect stings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement, Ciba-Geigy will pay Tanox an initial
undisclosed amount of money, with additional payments as
product development progresses. Ciba Geigy will also acquire
a minority stake in Tanox. Tanox will receive royalties on
Ciba-Geigy's sales of resulting allergy products and will
share manufacturing rights.</p>
