<p>AIR CANADA'S first-quarter results included 6 million
Canadian dollars (US$5.1 million) net proceeds from the sale
of shares in an investment and an undisclosed amount from the
sale of an aircraft. Yesterday's edition incorrectly
described these sales as extraordinary gains and misstated
the total amount.</p>
