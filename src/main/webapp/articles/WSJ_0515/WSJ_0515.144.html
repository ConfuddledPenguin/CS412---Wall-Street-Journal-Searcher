	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southland Corp. said it had a net loss of $69.4
million in the first quarter after a $52 million tax benefit
related to the sale of a 50% stake in Citgo Petroleum Corp.
   Included in its $121.5 million loss before the tax benefit
was $133.3 million in interest expense.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A year earlier, the convenience store retailer had a net
loss of $169.4 million, including a $56 million charge
related to a debt-exchange offer and $17.3 million in profit
from discontinued operations. The year-ago loss from
continuing operations of $130.7 million included $144.7
million in interest expense.</p>
<p>Revenue rose about 2% to $1.94 billion from $1.9 billion.</p>
<p>The company said its average merchandise sales increased
about 3.6% in the quarter, while its merchandise gross
profits rose about 2.5%. Retail gasoline profits declined
2.4%, largely because Southland has fewer outlets this year
than last.</p>
<p>Southland, which went private in a $4.9 billion leveraged
buy-out in 1987, has proposed swapping its public debt and
selling 75% of its stock to its Japanese partners for $400
million to avert a liquidity crisis and possible bankruptcy
filing. However, its debt-swap proposal already has
encountered heated resistance from bondholders, many of whom
don't want to accept the proposed zero-coupon bonds with
longer maturities for the interest-paying debt they now own.</p>
<p>Southland said it currently is holding discussions with
bondholders.</p>
<p>The company also said that its has reduced its senior bank
term loan to $900.4 million from about $2.55 billion when it
went private, and that it has repaid about $399.5 million
this year. It still will owe $12.9 million on June 30 and
$18.8 million on both Sept. 30 and Dec. 31 on that loan.</p>
