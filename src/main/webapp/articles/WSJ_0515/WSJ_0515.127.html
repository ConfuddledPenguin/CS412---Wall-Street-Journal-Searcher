	<p class="article-leader">Apple Bancorp Inc. urged shareholders to reject a proxy
fight organized by Stanley Stahl and affirmed its rejection
of the New York real-estate investor's $38-a-share tender
offer.
   The New York-based parent of Apple Bank for Savings told
shareholders in a letter, "We believe that it is coercive for
Mr. Stahl to condition his offer on having you first vote to
give him control" of Apple before the board "has had a full
opportunity to explore and pursue financially more-attractive
alternatives."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Stahl, who controls 30.6% of Apple and has offered
$121.6 million for the rest, declined to comment on the
letter, which Apple disclosed as part of a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing. The company and Mr. Stahl have
lawsuits pending against each other.</p>
<p>Apple's directors haven't set a date for the annual
meeting; Mr. Stahl's lawsuit demands, among other things,
that the board set such a date. The company has said that the
board hasn't set the date in order to allow time to explore
alternatives to Mr. Stahl's bid.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Apple shares closed at $44, unchanged.</p>
