	<p class="article-leader">SUNNYVALE, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp.'s Lockheed Missiles &
Space Co. subsidiary said it received a $971 million contract
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to
oversee design and development of a new generation of rocket
motors for the space shuttle.
   Under terms of the five-year contract, Lockheed Missiles
is the prime contractor and systems engineer for development
of 20 advanced, solid rocket motors for use in the space
agency's shuttle launches beginning in 1995.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The motors will be built at a plant to be constructed on
1,100 acres of federal land near Iuka, Miss., close to the
Tennessee and Alabama borders. GenCorp Inc.'s Aerojet General
Corp. subsidiary, Folsom, Calif., will produce the motors.
Wheelabrator Technologies Inc.'s RUST International Corp.
subsidiary, based in Birmingham, Ala., will manage the plant
construction.</p>
<p>Of the $971 million award, Lockheed will receive "a little
more than a quarter and two-thirds go to Aerojet," said a
Lockheed spokesman. The balance will be paid to various
subcontractors.</p>
<p>If NASA exercised an option for production of up to 88
additional motors in the mid-1990s, the contract's value
could rise by as much as $1.39 billion, Lockheed said.</p>
<p>Aerojet's portion will be split with subcontractors,
including Babcock & Wilcox, a New Orleans unit of McDermott
International Inc. and Thiokol Corp., Brigham City, Utah.
Aerojet will employ up to 1,000 people and Lockheed will
employ about 70 at the site, Lockheed said.</p>
<p>The proposed rocket motors will have a lift capability of
65,000 pounds of payload, about 12,000 pounds more than the
existing motors, which were refurbished after the Challenger
explosion four years ago. Besides being more powerful, the
new motors will be safer, mainly because there are fewer
joints.</p>
<p>Separately, about 900 machinists union members at
Lockheed's aircraft service unit in Ontario, Calif., voted to
accept the company's latest employment contract offer. The
settlement ends a nine-week strike by machinists at that
location.</p>
<p>Under the contract terms, machinists will receive a 5%
bonus plus $2,000 in the first year; in the second and third
years, top-grade hourly employees will receive a 3% wage
increase and 2% bonus, with all others receiving a 5% bonus.
The agreement also contains cost-of-living allowances over
the three years.</p>
