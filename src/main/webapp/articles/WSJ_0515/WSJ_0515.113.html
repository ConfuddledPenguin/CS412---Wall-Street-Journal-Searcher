	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- For all the political risk that Congress and
the White House face in budget talks beginning here today,
the alternative of deep automatic spending cuts may be even
more perilous, both sides agree.
   After all the blustering is over, the imperative of
avoiding these across-the-board spending cuts is likely to be
foremost on the minds of congressional and administration
budget negotiators when they open talks with a 90-minute
session at the White House this afternoon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cuts, which would be triggered in October by the
Gramm-Rudman law, would slash fiscal 1991 spending 25% or
more on everything from President Bush's war on drugs to the
already-stretched air-traffic-control system. Social Security
benefits would be spared, but the director of the
Congressional Budget Office warns that Social Security
offices might have to close one day a week.</p>
<p>"It would have a chilling effect on our way of life in the
United States," says Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, a
Republican negotiator at the budget summit.</p>
<p>And he is assuming that the across-the-board spending cuts
for fiscal 1991 would amount to only $55 billion or so. White
House Budget Director Richard Darman, who keeps the books
under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, says inaction
might mean cuts of $100 billion or more just before this
fall's elections.</p>
<p>That's far greater than the $16.1 billion in Gramm-Rudman
cuts imposed last year but scaled back sharply within a week.
"When you double the ante or triple it," says House
Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois, "then that tends
to have a feedback into every member's district."</p>
<p>The pain might not be felt immediately, budget analysts
say. But it would come if the cuts weren't undone. A new
congressional analysis shows that if the spending cuts
totaled $50 billion, then outlays for veterans' health care
would be pared by $350 million, for aid to Israel by $550
million, for AIDS research by $127 million and for the space
program by $1.4 billion. By law, roughly two-thirds of all
federal spending is exempt, including Social Security
benefits and federal pensions. The cuts would be split evenly
between defense and eligible nondefense programs. If the cuts
totaled $50 billion, Pentagon outlays would be slashed 13%
and applicable nondefense programs 18% across-the-board.</p>
<p>So the betting in Congress and in the administration is
that the budget summit will produce some way to avoid what is
sometimes called "a planned train wreck."</p>
<p>But success may come in a different guise from the "big
deal" that wipes out the deficit for all time. If no one is
prepared to live with the Gramm-Rudman cuts, then the
politically safer alternative may be to poke a new loophole
in the Gramm-Rudman law.</p>
<p>Simply rewriting the Gramm-Rudman law -- as bean counters
in both the administration and the Congress are recommending
-- to ignore the unanticipated extra spending on the thrift
crisis would nearly halve Mr. Darman's $100 billion estimate.</p>
<p>And with so much talk about altering budgetary accounting
in order that Congress can tell voters it's no longer raiding
the Social Security trust fund, there's bound to be some
rejiggering of the Gramm-Rudman deficit ceilings. If
negotiators can only come up with $40 billion or so of
spending cuts, tax increases and accounting gimmicks, they
surely will be tempted to adjust the targets accordingly,
declare victory and go home.</p>
<p>Another possibility, one Republican senator suggests, is
agreement this fall on a plan to avert the dreaded spending
cuts, even if it can't be put into force until a lame-duck
session before Christmas.</p>
<p>But for now, the administration clearly has decided to
abandon its previous public complacency about the economy and
the deficit, hoping that its scary talk about the future will
help prompt a compromise. Mr. Darman, for one, no longer
exudes optimism about the economy or confidence that the law
gives him enough flexibility to fudge the figures on the cost
of the thrift crisis.</p>
<p>Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget
Office, finds the talk of sudden crisis a little hard to
swallow. "I'm tempted to say: `Read my book,'" he says,
referring to a CBO budget analysis published earlier this
year. Rejecting an economic forecast that Mr. Darman defended
three months ago and now disavows, the CBO for months has
been projecting a fiscal 1991 deficit of $161 billion, or
almost $100 billion more than the $64 billion Gramm-Rudman
target.</p>
<p>Some Democrats are skeptical, too, about the
administration's sudden discovery that high interest rates
threaten to produce a recession and require drastic action on
the deficit. "The problem is serious, but I'm not sure it's
of the gravity that they're saying," says Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.). "The problem
didn't suddenly reach critical mass."</p>
<p>Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine notes a
"high level of resentment and skepticism among Democrats"
toward the talks. If negotiators don't make progress in the
next two or three weeks, Sen. Sasser says, the Senate should
consider the Senate Budget Committee's budget plan to trim
the deficit by $43 billion.</p>
<p>Yet the White House wasn't predicting speedy progress or
agreement in the budget negotiations. "It'll go on probably
weeks, if not months," says White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater. "It is not the kind of thing where anybody expects
to run in, throw a proposal on the table, and vote on it, or
anything like that."</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzwater says that after today's initial 90-minute
meeting, at which President Bush will preside and make an
opening presentation, the big administration-congressional
negotiating group is likely to break up into smaller groups
to consider specific issues in detail. Those subgroups then
will report back to the full group, which includes 21
lawmakers and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, Budget
Director Darman and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu,
as well as Mr. Bush.</p>
<p>"A lot will depend on the president himself," Sen. Sasser
says. "If he sits on the sideline and lets Sununu define the
political side of it, and Darman try to define the fiscal,
budgetary side of it, they probably are not going to be
successful."</p>
<p>But Sen. Sasser, who is less enthusiastic about the talks
than many others on Capitol Hill, says Mr. Bush must want the
talks to succeed "or he would not have opened up this
Pandora's box" and exposed himself to the charge that he is
abandoning his no-new-taxes pledge.</p>
