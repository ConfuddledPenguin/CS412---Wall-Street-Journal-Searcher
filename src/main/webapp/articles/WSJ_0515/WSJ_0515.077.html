	<p class="article-leader">Your April 2 Heard on the Street column about the proposed
Safeway Stores public offering was disturbing.
   Your main points were: that some prospective investors
find Safeway's debt load and "lack of earnings" disturbing;
and that others dislike the involvement of Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The first of these points was presented so devoid of
context as to make it laughable. When compared with the cash
flow that will have to support it, Safeway's debt load is
significantly smaller than that of Kroger, another large
(sales of $19 billion) public supermarket company. And when
it comes to earnings, Safeway is at least making a net
profit. You imply that Safeway's prospective P-E multiple of
36 is astronomical. To put this in context, neither Kroger
nor Vons (also a public supermarket company, sales of $5
billion) boasts any P-E multiple at all, because both are
still reporting net losses. Compared with these two perfectly
respectable supermarket companies, Safeway looks a steal at
36 times.</p>
<p>I make no claims about KKR's treatment of bondholders in
any one of its deals. But if reporters want to run anti-KKR
stories, they should do so in the open, not by sly hints and
suggestions.</p>
