settlement agreement providing for the payment of unpaid
retiree medical claims incurred prior to July 31, 1990, and

settlement covers about 2,000 former employees of the

payments and a retiree benefit fund in excess of $1 million
to be established by Amdura and its subsidiaries, the company
said.</p>
