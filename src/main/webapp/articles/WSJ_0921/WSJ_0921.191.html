	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Jacques Attali is an idea man.
   For the past decade he has been Francois Mitterrand's
personal idea man, showering the French president with ideas,
on international debt, nuclear arms and the global balance of
power. Overflow ideas went into 15 books, including two
novels, labored over between 4 a.m. and 7 a.m. each morning,
about money, power, love, life and death.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. Mitterrand's former special counselor, through
whose office all visitors to the president had to pass,
recently had an idea that is taking him in a new direction.
Western Europe, Mr. Attali thought, urgently needed to help
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union rebuild their industrial
base. Existing institutions such as the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund could help, but were either too
big or too bureaucratic to solve the problem.</p>
<p>So Mr. Attali (pronounced with the accent on the last
syllable) thought up the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development. He calls the bank the first independent major
new international financial institution since the 1944
Bretton Woods conference set up the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund. (Later institutions, such as
development banks for Asia and Africa, are arms of the World
Bank or the IMF, he reasons.)</p>
<p>The new institution, with an initial capital of 10 billion
European Currency Units ($13 billion), will channel money to
both private and public projects in the East. With the firm
backing of Mr. Mitterrand, Mr. Attali sold the idea to the
European Community, which will hold a majority stake in the
bank, and to other governments, including the U.S. and Japan.
He wrote the business plan and articles of incorporation for
the bank. And he got himself named its president-designate.
All in less than a year.</p>
<p>The problem is certainly urgent. With risky free-market
reforms already under way in Poland and Hungary, being
readied in the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, and a more
distant dream in Bulgaria and Romania, Eastern Europe needs
lots of financial help. Fast. The enormous costs of the West
German bailout of East Germany seem to rise every day, and
estimates of basic infrastructure needs in East Germany alone
are dozens of times what the EBRD will be able to provide for
all of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>"Financing the cleanup after communism threatens to be
surprisingly disruptive in the short run," according to a
report by Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd. of London. Credit
Suisse estimates that a Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union on the same relative scale as the postwar
rebuilding of Western Europe would cost $85 billion -- nearly
seven times what Mr. Attali has -- and that money wouldn't be
nearly enough to erase the legacy of 45 years of failed
economic policies.</p>
<p>Mr. Attali didn't respond to a request for an interview
for this article; aides said he wasn't giving any press
interviews before officially being named president of the
EBRD. But in past interviews, in speeches and in his
writings, he has outlined his basic vision of the EBRD.
Essentially, he views it as a sort of international merchant
bank trying to make a profit for its 42 shareholding nations
by investing in new Eastern European companies in the fields
of telecommunications, railroads, airlines, television,
newspapers and other basic industries that would in turn spur
manufacturing activity.</p>
<p>An international financial official who recently met Mr.
Attali says the new bank will be "two-thirds Lazard Freres,
one-third World Bank."</p>
<p>Its charter requires that at least 60% of its loans go to
private-sector projects, a stipulation won by the U.S. during
the bank's formation process. "The bank won't be financing
humanitarian projects," Mr. Attali told the French
Parliament's foreign-affairs committee in June. "As the
biggest merchant bank in the world, it will serve as a
catalyst for an entire development process."</p>
<p>Mr. Attali's strategy -- and a lot of the controversy he
has generated since being nominated to head the EBRD -- is
based on his firm belief that global power in the future will
depend on a nation's or a region's ability to support strong
manufacturing industries. In a recent book, he sees the
emergence of two major couples in the world: Japan and the
United States, and Europe and the Soviet Union. In both
cases, he argues, it is the first member of the couple, Japan
and Europe, that will be the dynamic manufacturing force
supporting the militarily strong but economically burdened
superpower.</p>
<p>His main argument is that the U.S. manufacturing industry
has declined perilously in the face of Japanese competition.
"The United States will find itself in a situation of being
symbolically secondary," he writes. "Already it can't sell
anything to Japan but agricultural products. It will become
Japan's granary, like Poland was for 17th-century Flanders."
He adds: "The U.S. will have to get used to the idea of being
no longer master of the world, at the very moment capitalism
is winning everywhere in Eastern Europe."</p>
<p>To capitalize on the triumph of capitalism in the East, an
increasingly united Western Europe has to provide seed money
and know-how. Hence the EBRD. "It will be the training ground
for the transition from a centralized to a market economy,"
he writes, playing the same role that the European Coal and
Steel Community did as the precursor of the Common Market and
eventually turning the European continent into an industrial
powerhouse.</p>
<p>He firmly believes that both governments and the private
sector have a role to play: He has enthusiastically
championed such subsidized projects as the European Airbus
and the promotion of high-definition television, as means of
ensuring Europe's manufacturing future. He was the architect
of Mr. Mitterrand's ill-fated nationalization program
starting in 1981, which was later partly reversed and which
now has been frozen.</p>
<p>Mr. Attali is a man around whom controversy occasionally
swirls. He was born 46 years ago in French Algeria to a poor
but eventually successful family of merchants. The family
moved to Paris when Jacques and his twin brother, Bernard,
now chairman of Air France, were 12. The boys quickly rose on
academic merit through the most elite of France's elite
schools. Jacques went to four of the best schools, including
the "Ecole Nationale d'Administration," the breeding ground
for France's top officials. He became an economics professor,
a member of the Socialist Party, and economic adviser to Mr.
Mitterrand in the years before the Socialists won power in
1981.</p>
<p>Since then, from his key seat at the Elysee Palace, Mr.
Attali has served as France's sherpa, or advance man, for the
last 10 economic summits, as well as playing a key role in
strategic affairs. During the debate over the stationing and
removal of American medium-range missiles in Europe, Mr.
Attali met frequently with Charles Powell, Margaret
Thatcher's security adviser, and Horst Teltschik, adviser to
Helmut Kohl, trying to work out a common European defense
strategy.</p>
<p>Mr. Attali also forged a close alliance with the U.S.
Treasury in the first 18 months of the Bush administration,
exerting considerable influence on U.S. international
economic policy, according to senior U.S. officials. Mr.
Attali's closest ally in the Treasury, Undersecretary for
International Affairs David Mulford, was pushing the U.S.
administration to write off more Third World debt, a strategy
favored by Mr. Attali and Mr. Mitterrand.</p>
<p>When Mr. Attali was vigorously lobbying to set up the
EBRD, the Treasury initially allowed the French a free hand
and agreed that the U.S. would have the same 8.5%
shareholding as France, Italy, West Germany, Britain and
Japan. Under pressure from the National Security Council and
the State Department -- and after an internal wrangle -- the
Treasury became more engaged in the negotiations regarding
the new bank. It pressed for -- and got -- a 10% share in the
new institution, forced through regulations limiting Soviet
borrowing from the bank, and insisted on a private-sector
emphasis in the new institution's lending policies.</p>
<p>Mr. Attali's appointment to head the new bank created
considerable ill will. The Dutch in particular, who had hoped
to snare the top job at the new institution for their own
former finance minister, H. Onno Ruding, were dismayed at the
secretive negotiations between Britain and France that led to
a London location for the EBRD and to Mr. Attali's
appointment as its head. They are still fuming. "I don't see
how anybody can believe that the man {Mr. Attali} who
masterminded the most sweeping program of nationalizations in
French history is the right man to privatize Eastern Europe,"
says a Dutchman.</p>
<p>Mr. Attali will have to be more diplomatic if he is to
make a success of his new task. The bank has -- for the time
being -- a relatively limited mandate, with Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria as
its main customers. But it has 42 shareholders, including all
the major Western nations, the East Bloc countries and even
Mexico.</p>
<p>The U.S. administration already is upset by Mr. Attali's
recent attempts to concentrate management power in his own
office at the EBRD. Mr. Attali has tried to cut back the
powers of the planned bank's board of directors, U.S.
officials say, and has tried to ensure that he has no
powerful deputy but instead a group of four equal
subordinates.</p>
<p>The U.S. and some other bank shareholders are insisting on
a powerful deputy to Mr. Attali and a board of directors with
real clout. These issues won't be settled until next month
when more meetings on the bank's management structure are
scheduled to be held in Europe. The U.S. is even threatening
to pull out of the EBRD if Mr. Attali's proposed management
structure is implemented.</p>
<p>U.S. and European government officials generally commend
Mr. Attali for his charm and genius, but caution that his
ideas and obsessions can sometimes seem harebrained. Last
year Mr. Attali was sent by Mr. Mitterrand on a special
mission to Bangladesh, which had been recently devastated by
a flood. During preparations for the economic summit in
Paris, Mr. Attali spent months trying to convince other
industrial countries' leaders that it was necessary to spend
billions of dollars to build dams and dikes in Bangladesh to
prevent cataclysmic floods that occur only once in a
generation.</p>
<p>To counterbalance Mr. Attali, the Bush administration is
said to favor World Bank senior vice president Ernest Stern
as Mr. Attali's deputy. Mr. Stern, an American who has
devoted most of his career to economic development and the
World Bank, is highly respected in international financial
circles and has a formidable reputation for his management
and financial skills. He has headed both the World Bank's
operations and its financial departments.</p>
<p>Apart from these squabbles, the U.S. seems to have no
problem with Mr. Attali's general approach. "Jacques wants to
have a flexible organization, pay high salaries, and run {the
EBRD} like a merchant bank," says a senior Treasury official.
"To really get at the private-sector business, he's going to
have to have good private-sector people."</p>
<p>Bush administration officials say that a strong U.S. share
in the EBRD is important because it reinforces American
partnership with Europe at a time when the countries in the
East Bloc are turning toward democratic market-oriented
systems. It also reflects the U.S.'s continuing commitment to
a strong, reunited, free and economically healthy Europe,
they say.</p>
<p>But some in Washington aren't nearly so enamored of the
EBRD. William Niskanen, chairman of the Cato Institute and a
former member of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, says: "I think the last thing these Eastern
European countries need is money that will be used to defer
the most important decisions." He says both the U.S. and
Eastern Europe would be better off without the new
institution.</p>
<p>"There may be foreign-policy reasons for the U.S. joining
the EBRD, but those I think are better served by bilateral
aid," he adds.</p>
