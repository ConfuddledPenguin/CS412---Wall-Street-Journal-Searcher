	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- While many companies are bemoaning the
flagging quality of the work force, others are winning Labor
Department awards for their solutions to the problem.
   On Wednesday, the agency offered up the winners of its
first work-force quality awards. Not surprisingly, one of the
common threads is training.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The awards -- called LIFT America (an acronym of Labor
Investing for Tomorrow) -- are given to employers, unions,
educational organizations and communities to recognize
"creative solutions" for upgrading the quality of the work
force. Sixteen winners were chosen from 500 nominees; they
run the gamut from local vocational programs to industrial
giants.</p>
<p>Vermont Heating & Ventilating Co. was cited for its
embrace of programs to enhance skills and motivate workers.
John Stearns, head of personnel training, says the
250-employee company in Colchester, Vt., spends 10% of gross
revenue on training and education programs. Elaine Druke, who
rose from a journeyman sheetmetal worker to vice president,
administration, credits much of her success to the company's
motivational efforts. "Without the educational help," she
says, "it wouldn't have happened."</p>
<p>International Business Machines Corp. was honored for its
employee "work/life" programs. The IBM programs, addressing
family-related needs, include assisting employees with child
care and elder care, spouse relocation, schedule flexibility
and leaves of absence, and a broad array of seminars,
educational and career assistance for retirees. The company
also has committed $25 million to increase the supply and
quality of child-care and elder-care services in areas where
employees work and live.</p>
<p>Though the IBM programs involve both women and men, they
partly reflect IBM projections that over the 35-year period
ending in 2000 its male employee population will have dropped
by 25% while the number of its women employees will have
tripled.</p>
<p>Several other award winners also stress efforts to improve
opportunities for women and minorities. Building Futures in
Industry and Trades, a program run by Portland Community
College in Oregon, is a "fast track" six-month training
course designed to put women on paths for such nontraditional
skilled careers as electricians, plumbers, carpenters and
sheet-metal workers in jobs that pay $15 to $25 an hour.</p>
<p>Previously, women weren't striving toward such jobs,
program officials say. Many of the women students, whose
average age is 36, were working in low-paid jobs -- such as
in fast-food restaurants -- when they entered the program.
About 35% were unemployed and on welfare; 70% were single
heads of household.</p>
<p>The program fills women's "skill gaps" through immersion
courses in everything from learning how to wire electrical
projects to a physical-fitness program to career planning.
The women build a house from the foundation up, do upper-body
training, and even hear from sex-discrimination attorneys on
how to file a complaint if a problem arises. Since the summer
of 1989, when the program started, 106 women have completed
training -- an 87% graduation rate. Of the graduates, 90%
went on to apprenticeship or on-the-job training positions.</p>
<p>Katharine Settle says she entered the program because "my
husband had just recently left after 34 years of marriage,
and I found myself thinking about what I was going to do for
a living." Though she hadn't had a job in 26 years, she
thought the training program would help her acquire skills to
be a residential-construction contractor and thus make use of
experience already gained while helping to build and renovate
houses with her former husband. She's now pursuing an
associate degree in building-construction technology and says
the training program was "invaluable" in helping her reach
her goals.</p>
<p>The Labor Department also selected a program created by
the National Urban Coalition and funded by Shell Oil Co.,
part of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, to better equip minority
and women students with math, science and technology skills.
The program, begun in 1987 at nine elementary schools in
Houston and Washington, D.C., has expanded to 30 schools
around the country. Specially trained teachers use new
techniques to teach skills, and students are also required to
spend Saturday mornings at school or on field trips with a
parent or family member for family learning sessions. The
teachers link science skills to the children's own heritage,
and use special role models to motivate students, including
minority astronauts, entertainers and athletes. Follow-ups
show the program made positive differences in test scores,
attendance and motivation levels of participating children.</p>
<p>"Most companies are beginning to realize the changing
demographics of the work force and the fact that the schools
are in a crisis," says Paula Saizan, Shell's coordinator for
the program, which is called "Say YES to a Youngster's
Future."</p>
