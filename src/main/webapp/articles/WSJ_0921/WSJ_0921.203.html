	<p class="article-leader">As the real estate slump drags on, a lot of people are
thinking the unthinkable: What would happen if I just walked
away from my mortgage?
   While most people wouldn't act on the fantasy, some people
are abandoning their mortgages, turning their house over to
the bank.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After years of double-digit appreciation, many homeowners
already have seen the value of their homes drop by as much as
20%. That can be enough to wipe out a homeowner's equity, so
that the remaining mortgage is greater than the value of the
house.</p>
<p>"A lot of people bought when prices were going up; now
they're going down," says Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the
Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University
of Southern California at Berkeley. "More of those people
view walking away as an option. It happened in Texas and
Arizona, and now it's happening in the Northeast. It's not a
massive problem, but it could become one."</p>
<p>But simply letting the bank take your house when you can
afford to hang on through the current real-estate slump is a
terrible idea, says Roger Sirlin, a Mamaroneck, N.Y., lawyer
who represents lenders.</p>
<p>"A lot of people think they can just mail back the keys,
but it isn't that simple," he says. A foreclosure often has
several serious, long-term repercussions.</p>
<p>For one, it blackens a homeowner's credit record, where a
foreclosure stays for seven years. Because lenders view
mortgages as some of the safest loans they can make, a
foreclosure can make it hard to get new credit of any kind.</p>
<p>Banks consider the way people manage their house loans as
"probably the best indicator of their general
creditworthiness," says Joe Belew, president of the Consumer
Bankers Association, a Washington trade group.</p>
<p>A foreclosure can also mean losing existing credit, such
as one's credit cards. "It's up to the individual lender, but
many of them check credit reports periodically to look for
problems," says Michael Van Buskirk, a vice president at
Cleveland-based TRW Inc., the nation's largest credit bureau.
"If they see a foreclosure, they could take away your credit
cards, reduce your limit or just not renew the cards."</p>
<p>Some banks say they wouldn't revoke the credit cards of
someone who defaulted on a mortgage, so long as that
individual kept up the payments on the credit cards.
Defaulting on a mortgage also wouldn't necessarily
preventetting new credit cards from some banks. "It makes it
difficult, but not impossible," says William L. Capps, who
heads credit-card operations at Security Pacific National
Bank, Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Mr. Van Buskirk of TRW also doubts that a homeowner who
walks away from a mortgage, and also has an outstanding auto
loan, would have the car repossessed. "It's uncollateralized
loans that are most likely to be called," he says.</p>
<p>But there are plenty of other headaches the homeowner
could face. Many houses have fallen so far in value they
aren't fetching enough in foreclosure auctions to cover the
remaining mortgage.</p>
<p>As a result, more and more lenders are using the laws in
some states, such as New York, to force borrowers to make up
the difference. They can do that by taking a homeowner's car
and savings accounts or garnisheeing paychecks for as long as
20 years.</p>
<p>Such "deficiency judgments" were relatively rare when
inflation was boosting home values year after year. Now, says
Mr. Sirlin, lenders are "beginning to go after people."</p>
<p>Tax rules also are stacked in favor of hanging on to your
house. Unhappily, if you sell the house at a loss, that loss
isn't deductible on your income taxes. Under tax laws, "a
house is considered personal property, just like a car," says
William G. Brennan, a tax partner in the Washington office of
accountants Ernst & Young.</p>
<p>But if you walk away from your mortgage, you could end up
owing the taxman. Some states don't permit lenders to seek
deficiency judgments. If a lender can't go after the
difference between the auction price and the outstanding debt
on the house, the Internal Revenue Service can. The IRS
considers any unclaimed shortfall "forgiveness of debt," in
effect, a payment to you from the lender. Then it becomes
taxable income.</p>
<p>The tax consequences of abandoning a mortgage could be
even worse for homeowners who refinanced before the bottom
fell out of the housing market.</p>
<p>Many people took advantage of spiraling real estate values
to take cash out and refinance for more than they originally
for their homes. Walking away now could trigger a tax
double-whammy, says Ernst & Young's Mr. Brennan.</p>
<p>Mr. Brennan offers this example: "Suppose you bought a
paid house a few years ago for $100,000 and took out a
mortgage for $90,000. The house doubled in value to $200,000,
so you refinanced for $170,000. Since then, the house has
dropped in value to $150,000.</p>
<p>"Now, you walk away. The bank takes back the house, sells
it for $150,000 and doesn't go after you for the other
$20,000 still left on the mortgage.</p>
<p>"That $20,000 of forgiven debt is taxable income," he
says, but that isn't all. "Since your tax basis in the house
is still $100,000 because that's what you paid for it, but
the bank sold it for $150,000, you also have a $50,000
taxable gain."</p>
<p>A financially strapped homeowner who can't avoid
foreclosure might be better off filing for bankruptcy, says
Ray Martin, a Dallas lawyer. In many states, the owner gets
to keep a house, even if it isn't fully paid for, because the
house is an "exempt asset that doesn't go into the bankruptcy
estate," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Martin adds, however, that the mortgage holder could
still foreclose if a bankrupt homeowner doesn't meet the
mortgage payments. A bankruptcy also stays on an individual's
credit record for 10 years.</p>
<p>Homeowners with serious debt problems should keep in mind
that lenders aren't eager to get back houses they have to
turn around and sell themselves at current depressed prices.</p>
<p>"The last thing they want to do is foreclose," says TRW's
Mr. Van Buskirk. "If you've had a problem or lost a job, most
lenders will help you work it out. But if you just walk away,
that's very difficult, if not impossible, to explain. In
short, it's a big mistake."</p>
