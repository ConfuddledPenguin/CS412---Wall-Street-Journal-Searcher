	<p class="article-leader">PASADENA, Calif. -- Avery International Corp. said its
merger with Dennison Manufacturing Co. has been delayed until
mid-October because the Justice Department is taking slightly
longer than expected to complete its antitrust review.
   "No problem is anticipated," an Avery spokeswoman said.
The office-products concern had expected the review to be
done by Sept. 28. Completion is now expected Oct. 12. The
merger with Dennison, an office-products manufacturer based
in Framingham, Mass., will close shortly thereafter, Avery
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Avery also reported that net income fell 30% to $13.3
million in the third quarter ended Aug. 31. The results
include $3.7 million in merger-related expenses, which
reduced per-share net by eight cents to 30 cents a share. In
the year-ago quarter, the company had net of $18.9 million,
or 43 cents a share. Sales in the latest quarter rose 6% to
$448.6 million from $422.7 million.</p>
<p>Avery said "a weak world-wide industrial economy" hurt the
company. The company was also hurt by the bankruptcies of
three large European customers. Avery said strong
performances of its U.S. office products businesses didn't
offset weakness in overseas operations.</p>
