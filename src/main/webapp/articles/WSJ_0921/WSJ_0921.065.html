	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange is proposing a
rule change aimed at curbing stock market volatility each
month when stock-index futures and options expire.
   The rule could curtail certain forms of program trading.
The Big Board wants to give its specialists new powers to
only partially fill expiration orders for stock if the market
maker is unable to find sufficient supply or demand.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rule change is likely to spark outrage from some
program traders whose strategies sometimes depend on having
orders filled precisely at the closing prices on the third
Friday of each month. (Today is one of those days, the
quarterly and monthly expiration of stock-index futures and
options and options on individual stocks.)</p>
<p>The proposal "is not an attractive rule for stock-index
arbitragers," said a principal at one firm. "Telling somebody
that you can't get out is about the worst thing you can do"
to turn investors away from a market, "except for closing the
market altogether."</p>
<p>In stock-index arbitrage, dealers trade among stocks,
stock-index futures and options to capture profits from
fleeting price differences.</p>
<p>Other exchanges could also be affected. The rule change
could induce enough uncertainty to curb some program-trading
strategies altogether, which would cut into volume on the
Chicago Board Options Exchange, the American Stock Exchange
and the Chicago Board of Trade.</p>
<p>But such controversy is likely to put more heat on the two
Chicago exchanges and on the Amex, which so far have refused
to switch to morning expirations. Currently, S&P 500-stock
index futures and options expire quarterly in the morning,
meaning the settlement value of the futures and options is
based on the opening price of all 500 stocks. This procedure
allows specialists in the underlying stocks more time to
match buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>What the Big Board's proposal "should do is induce the
Amex and the CBOE to take a serious look at the problem" of
afternoon expirations, said Richard Grasso, Big Board
president. He added he preferred morning expirations to the
new rule.</p>
<p>The Friday afternoon expirations have been a longstanding
concern at the Big Board and the Securities and Exchange
Commission, because they occasionally result in abrupt swings
in stock prices.</p>
<p>"Our thinking has been that the {morning} expirations help
address volatility concerns, and provide better procedures
for marshalling interest in underlying stocks," said Brandon
Becker, associate director at the SEC's division of market
regulation. He said afternoon expirations are a source of
"continuing concern."</p>
<p>The Big Board and the SEC are particularly concerned about
what would happen if an afternoon expiration occurred
simultaneously with a market panic, such as October 13, 1989,
when stocks fell 190 points in the final hour of trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Grasso insists that the exchange is not trying to
curtail trading strategies or give specialists undue powers.
"It is purely and simply a question of fairness -- how you
fairly price a large amount of stock," he said. A morning
expiration, he said, would give the exchange more time to
broadcast the supply and demand for stock to customers,
making the market more efficient.</p>
<p>"I understand the problem New York is concerned about,"
said Alger B. Chapman, chairman of the CBOE. "But the problem
is being created by a relatively small number of
professionals." Mr. Chapman said the Big Board's rule change
"may well be better than turning the apple cart upside down
for the individual investor" with a change in expiration
times.</p>
<p>The Big Board's concern extends to the CBOE's big Standard
& Poor's 100 stock index options contract, an active market
used by program traders. The CBOE also has an S&P 500 options
contract that settles monthly on Friday afternoons. The Amex
trades the active Major Market Index options contract.</p>
<p>Following a specific request from the SEC in July to study
the matter anew, the CBOE and the Amex funded a study by two
academics on expiration volatility.</p>
<p>One conclusion reached by Hans R. Stoll of Vanderbilt
University and Robert Whaley of Duke University: "Volatility
on the monthly {non-quarterly} expirations has not increased
in a way that necessitates a change in expiration
procedures."</p>
<p>Citing the study, an Amex spokeswoman said: "We see no
reason to change at this point. The study said there was no
impact." A Board of Trade spokesman said the exchange is
reviewing the matter.</p>
<p>Aside from the study, CBOE President Charles Henry noted
that it would confuse customers if the expiration was
changed. "We talked to all of the firms that were
representing customers. They asked us to keep it {the
expiration} on the close," Mr. Henry said.</p>
<p>Additionally, CBOE officials argue that important economic
news is often disclosed Fridays. An afternoon expiration is
less risky for investors, the officials say, because the
market has had time to digest that news.</p>
<p>The CBOE, the world's largest options exchange, is having
a booming year in some products. The exchange's options on
the S&P 500 stock index has seen record-setting trading
interest this month.</p>
<p>Recently, the CBOE asked the SEC to allow member firms to
increase the size of positions they can take in the contract.
For now, the SEC has denied the request and restated its
concern about afternoon expirations.</p>
<p>Regarding the Big Board's proposal, once the SEC gets a
rule change request it publishes the document and seeks
public comment. The SEC typically takes action 30 days after
publication, but that period can be extended. The Big Board
submitted its proposal to the SEC on Sept. 7.</p>
<p>In a separate action, Big Board and CBOE officials said
they are investigating a series of expiration days for signs
of manipulation. This study includes past July 20, 1990, when
the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell sharply as traders
changed buy orders to sell orders late in the session.</p>
