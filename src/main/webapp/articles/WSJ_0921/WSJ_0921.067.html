	<p class="article-leader">The budget summit debate over capital gains, some would
have us believe, is the only thing standing in the way of a
budget deal, a balanced budget, a plunge in interest rates,
renewed economic growth, everlasting prosperity and the
redemption of sins. The Republicans want to cut the tax, and
the Democrats refuse to do so without some symbolic increase
in the top marginal rate.
   We come to propose a compromise: Leave the capital-gains
rate where it is, but tidy up two corners of the tax law.
First, index the base of the capital gains for inflation.
Second, allow the full deduction of capital losses against
ordinary income.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In other words, treat all income the same; what could be
fairer? The Bush proposal looks a lot more reasonable, and
the talk of "fairness" looks even sillier, if you stop to
notice that the current system does not tax capital gains the
same as other income. It taxes them punitively.</p>
<p>First, capital gains are measured in nominal dollars. That
is, the "gain" is the difference between the purchase price
and the selling price, even if the dollar has eroded faster
than the property appreciated. You can be taxed on illusory
gains, while a tax of 75% on real gains is relatively easy to
demonstrate, as David Goldman recently showed on these pages.
If the purpose of a budget deal is to cut the deficit, boost
savings and help capital formation, this kind of taxation on
capital gains is boneheaded.</p>
<p>We agree with some liberal tax reformers that the effect
of inflation on capital gains is no different from the effect
on savings accounts or other capital pools (which were
already taxed once when the capital was saved from income).
If you index the base of capital gains, you ought also to
provide for deducting the inflation rate from interest or
other returns on capital before they are taxed.</p>
<p>That aside, the indexing point is widely understood. Even
the editors of the New York Times, while ranting against the
capital-gains cut, concede that indexing is only fair. But
moralizers like the Times have either never heard about the
non-deductibility of losses, or display a studied ignorance
of this even more glaring inequity.</p>
<p>If you have capital losses, the tax code lets you deduct
them against capital gains, but limits deductions against
other income to $3,000 a year. If your stock goes up, you
have income. But if it goes down more than $3,000, you don't
lose income, the tax man says. This is called "taxing all
income the same." If a lower tax rate for capital gains is
"unfair," the summiteers can still redress this
heads-we-wins, tails-you-lose provision.</p>
<p>Now, we suspect the summiteers won't much like our
compromise, because the capital-loss provision is the tax
code's dirty little secret. If you allowed full deduction of
losses, the capital-gains tax probably wouldn't raise any
revenue and might as well be abolished. And with full
deductibility, you'd see people with large losses, from junk
bonds for example, paying no tax despite high cash flows from
other earnings. This would make losses, like those at S&Ls,
more useful for tax purposes and easier to handle, but
"reformers" would scream.</p>
<p>Which is why the deduction for losses was limited in the
first place, back during the Great Depression. And the
limitation on deductions was the reason why capital gains
were historically taxed at a lower rate -- in an attempt at
rough justice or, dare we say, "fairness." This solution to
the dilemma worked well enough for many years, until tax
writers decided that lowering the top marginal rate required
a pound of flesh from capital gains, and took away one side
of the historical bargain.</p>
<p>The summit argument over capital gains is a bit silly to
begin with, of course, since despite official but artificial
numbers to the contrary, everyone understands that a simple
cut in the capital-gains tax rate would actually increase
revenues in the next budget. And if capital gains are paid by
"the rich," higher revenues mean the rich are paying higher
taxes. Our indexing-plus-deductibility compromise fits well
with the spirit of unreality that permeates the summit's
glass cocoon: The bean-counters could say no revenues would
be lost because "the rich" never have losses. The fairness
mavens could say everything is treated the same. Democrats
could say they held the line on the rate, and the Republicans
could say they've secretly abolished the tax.</p>
<p>It would be a lot simpler, though, to recognize that there
are reasons why capital gains have historically carried a
lower tax rate than ordinary income. One reason is to promote
growth, especially through start-up companies. But another
reason, rooted in equity, is to level the table on treatment
of investors' gains and losses. That is, there is nothing
intrinsically unfair in the Bush proposal for a lower
capital-gains rate, and therefore nothing that needs to be
"offset" by raising taxes elsewhere.</p>
