	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Sabena is seeking an injection of six billion
Belgian francs ($185.8 million) from the government to
finance an ambitious expansion plan, a spokesman for the
Belgian carrier said.
   Separately, the spokesman said Sabena's operating loss for
the year will be wider than 1989's loss of 1.26 billion
Belgian francs. He declined to elaborate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to an article in Le Soir, a Belgian daily, the
funds Sabena is seeking would be part of a six-year, 97
billion Belgian franc expansion program that will boost the
airline's fleet to 91 aircraft in 1996 from the current 41.</p>
<p>The expansion is related to the formation of Sabena World
Airways, an operating subsidiary Sabena has formed with
British Airways and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to convert
Brussels into a major European passenger air service hub.
British Air and KLM each have a 20% stake in Sabena World
Airways, with Sabena holding the remaining 60%.</p>
<p>Sabena is 53%-owned by the Belgian government.</p>
<p>Andre Pahaut, the carrier's chief executive officer, said
Sabena would boost fares 5% to 8% starting in October.</p>
