	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department said it is
considering whether legislation or other action is needed to
clarify the status of the tax benefits that were part of 96
government-assisted sales of insolvent thrifts in 1988.
   In a series of hearings, Congress is reviewing the
much-criticized transactions, which heaped more than $4
billion in tax benefits on buyers of thrifts. The benefits
occurred primarily through nontaxable government notes and
were shared among the buyers of the sick thrifts and their
affiliates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Resolution Trust Corp. has said it could save as much
as $4 billion if it received $22 billion in funding to pay
off the high-interest government notes that were part of the
deals.</p>
<p>Yesterday, William Seidman, chairman of the RTC, said
government savings could be even higher, depending on rulings
from the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury regarding
the tax benefits. "The tax benefits are complicated by what
assurances the government gave buyers at the time," said Mr.
Seidman.</p>
<p>Mr. Seidman said that just having the $22 billion on hand
might give the thrifts the clout to renegotiate the sales,
without spending all the money. "Then the funds wouldn't have
to be spent, and we would have the particular pleasure of
returning them to the Treasury."</p>
<p>Jack Kemp, secretary for the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, suggested that tax breaks might be
considered to help the RTC sell its swelling inventory of
properties seized from S&Ls, which currently includes about
$31 billion in real estate or troubled real-estate loans. Mr.
Kemp, a member of the RTC's Oversight Board, said tax
incentives could "drive some of this property back to the
private sector."</p>
