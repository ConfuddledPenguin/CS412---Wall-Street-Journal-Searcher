	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. said
sluggish sales will force them to temporarily close a total
of four U.S. car plants, idling 11,400 workers.
   GM said it will idle 4,300 workers at the Willow Run,
Mich., assembly plant that builds the large Chevrolet Caprice
model for two weeks beginning Monday. When the plant resumes
production Oct. 8, it will operate only one shift for at
least four weeks, also as a result of slow consumer demand
for the cars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Caprice is one of the biggest cars GM sells, and was
relaunched this spring with a radically new, aerodynamic
exterior. However, sales have slumped in recent weeks and now
GM dealers have a 96-day supply of the cars. A 60-to-65 days
supply is considered ideal. A Chevrolet spokesman said it's
not clear whether concerns about gas prices are affecting
sales of the car.</p>
<p>Ford, meanwhile, said it will temporarily idle three of
its U.S. assembly plants next week, laying off about 7,100
workers. The plants build the Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable,
the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar, and medium and
heavy-duty trucks.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ford said the Lorain, Ohio, truck assembly
plant will operate only one shift next week, putting 1,500
workers on temporary layoff. The plant builds the Econoline
and Club Wagon vans.</p>
<p>Ford said the strike by Canadian Auto Workers at its
Canadian operations hasn't forced any plant shutdowns in the
U.S. However, if the six-day walkout continues into next
week, parts shortages could force down time at certain Ford's
operations in the U.S. The facilities most likely to be idled
are the Wixom, Mich., luxury car factory, and two plants that
build the Taurus and Sable midsized models.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 10 domestic auto makers planned to build
148,711 cars this week, down 2.3% from 152,135 made a year
ago.</p>
