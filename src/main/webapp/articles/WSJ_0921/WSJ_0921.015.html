	<p class="article-leader">BRAINTREE, Mass. -- Clean Harbors Inc., denied state
permission to build a proposed hazardous waste incinerator,
said it will take a pretax charge of about $16 million that
will result in a loss for its third quarter, ending Nov. 30.
   The waste cleanup and hauling company said the one-time
charge will be related to a write-down of its investment in
the incinerator. The state Department of Environmental
Protection, in a decision that followed the recommendation of
the state Public Health Department, said the company's site
in Braintree isn't suitable for the project. It said the site
is in a heavily populated area and lacks an adequate buffer
zone between it and the area's residents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Clean Harbors spokesman said the state's decision
"clearly stated that the factors which caused them to reach
the decision that the site is not suitable aren't mitigable."
Clean Harbors has been planning to build the incinerator for
several years, but opposition among local residents has been
strong.</p>
<p>In the year-earlier third quarter, Clean Harbors had net
income of $1.6 million, or 18 cents a share, on revenue of
$33.5 million.</p>
<p>The company also said it had fiscal second-quarter net of
$1.4 million, or 16 cents a share, up 7.5% from $1.3 million,
or 15 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 16% to
$40.6 million in the period ended Aug. 31 from $35.1 million.
For the fiscal first half, net rose 17% to $2 million, or 23
cents a share, on revenue of $75.1 million, from $1.7
million, or 19 cents a share, on revenue of $68.2 million.</p>
