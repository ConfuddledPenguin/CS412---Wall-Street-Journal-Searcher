	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Apple Bancorp, ending a long, contentious
battle with Stanley Stahl, said it terminated two trusts it
created as its last attempt to block the real estate investor
from gaining control of the thrift holding company's board.
   The move effectively clears Mr. Stahl to complete his
tender offer of $38 for each Apple share, or an indicated
$179.4 million, and install a majority on Apple's board. Mr.
Stahl currently has a 30.3% stake in the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Investors, some of whom described the latest news as a
"done deal," reacted positively, boosting the price of Apple
stock $5.50 to $36.375 a share in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange yesterday.</p>
<p>But one analyst cautioned that Mr. Stahl could still back
out of the offer. "For economic reasons he might not want to
proceed," said Reid Nagle, an analyst with SNL Securities.</p>
<p>Separately, Mr. Stahl said in a statement he expects to
complete the offer, which expires Oct. 1. As of Sept. 4,
about 2.8 million, or about 46% of the shares outstanding had
been tendered, giving Mr. Stahl control of about 76% of the
company.</p>
<p>A spokesman said Mr. Stahl should have no problem with
financing the completion of the offer, which would be in cash
that he holds in certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>The announcement followed Mr. Stahl's assertion earlier
this week that the trusts violated conditions of his tender
offer. Last week, Apple established the trusts to pay for
costs that its officers and directors might incur in
litigation between the bank and Mr. Stahl, and to compensate
employees who might incur costs in enforcing the pacts.</p>
<p>The trusts were the last of several barriers Apple raised
in the past year to prevent Mr. Stahl from seeking control of
the company without completing the tender offer. Tactics
included rescheduling its annual meeting to come after the
completion of the tender offer and adopting anti-takeover
measures.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Stahl said he and Apple had begun
negotiating adequate assurances that Apple will,
simultaneously with the completion of the offer, elect his
nominees to form a majority on the board.</p>
