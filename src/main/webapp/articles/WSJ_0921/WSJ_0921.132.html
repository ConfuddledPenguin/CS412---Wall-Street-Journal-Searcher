	<p class="article-leader">3Com Corp. reported that net income for the first quarter
ended Aug. 31 quadrupled, to $5 million, or 17 cents a share,
from $1.2 million, or 4 cents a share, in the year-ago
period.
   Sales rose 19% to $106.2 million from $89.1 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Santa Clara, Calif., manufacturer of computer network
systems said that new products, such as its transmissions and
adapter devices, contributed to a third of sales, up from 10%
a year earlier. 3Com said the new-product sales helped to
offset weakening interest in the company's older workgroup
systems products.</p>
