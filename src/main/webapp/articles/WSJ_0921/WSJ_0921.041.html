	<p class="article-leader">SANTIAGO -- They were celebrating a birthday party. Almost
all of them were Communists who had known each other for
ages. The spirits were high; they were eating well, gossiping
and reminiscing about the old days.
   "I remember studying the layouts of all friendly embassies
in Santiago before jumping into East Germany's house in '73,"
boasted one of them. "I could burst into any of those
embassies anytime."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Yeah," said another one, "except that now what embassies
have we got left? There's no country to go to]"</p>
<p>Their laughter silenced the bitter irony of their words.
The Chilean Communist Party, once the strongest in the
Western world after the Italian Communist Party, has lost its
"Vatican" in Moscow and is falling to pieces. Prominent and
longtime faithful members are withdrawing from the Central
Committee, if not quitting the party altogether. And some
very conspicuous faces -- some of the very same ones that
were a symbol of underground Chilean communism during the
Pinochet government -- have been expelled from the party by
their own peers.</p>
<p>Take Luis Guastavino. A party member since he was 17 years
old, he has devoted his whole life to communism. Elected to
Parliament during three consecutive periods in the 1960s, his
albino face was an unmistakable trademark of proletarian
fire. He flew to exile after the military coup that overthrew
Socialist President Salvador Allende and, during most of the
17 years in which Gen. Augusto Pinochet ruled the country,
was an outstanding party figure: a member of the Central
Committee and an indisputable leader of Chilean communism,
someone whose voice was heard.</p>
<p>No more. Mr. Guastavino was "separated" from the party in
August, after months of fierce internal struggle. Since his
arrival from exile in 1987, he had tried unsuccessfully to
launch a Chilean-flavored perestroika, urging the Central
Committee to abandon its policy of "popular mass rebellion"
and "national insurrection." Mr. Guastavino, now 58, believed
that the Central Committee had to change, but the Central
Committee thought otherwise.</p>
<p>So if his voice was once heard with respect inside the
party, for the past several weeks it has been coming through
a loudspeaker outside: Mr. Guastavino has given interviews to
all media, friend or foe, accusing the Central Committee and
the Political Commission of being paranoid, Stalinists,
political morons. He even said that the people who now head
the party are "the mummies of Marxism," the worst insult of
all, since for decades the word "mummy" has been used in
Chile to identify aged ultraconservative right-wingers.</p>
<p>Members of the Central Committee, enjoying the total
freedom of the press that now reigns in Chile, haven't kept
their mouths shut either. They have accused Mr. Guastavino of
"individualistic degradation," and they have called him quite
an extensive list of ugly names. Volodia Teitelboim, the
secretary-general, went as far as giving an interview to the
powerful and loathed newspaper El Mercurio, which supported
Gen. Pinochet's government, to "put things straight."</p>
<p>In the midst of the battle, there was even some space in
the press for the Proletarian Action Communist Party, a tiny
Stalinist faction: It stated that neither Mr. Guastavino nor
Mr. Teitelboim were real Communists and that their words were
"offending Stalin and his great theoretical and practical
legacy."</p>
<p>If Mr. Guastavino's story has been a media feast, it is by
no means the only symptom of disintegration. Nearly half the
members of the Party Youth's Central Committee resigned some
weeks ago, and Secretary-General Teitelboim said the party
was undergoing a growth crisis. Several well-known Communist
Party spokespeople, such as Fanny Pollarolo, Manuel Riesco,
Gonzalo Rovira, have either quit the Central Committee or
stated publicly their opposition to the party's current
leadership, hinting that it might be leading Chilean
communism into oblivion.</p>
<p>This is hardly news in a world in which many national
Communist parties have been blown to smithereens from within
in less than a year. But given the 17 years of ruthless
right-wing military regime in Chile, which gave the local
Communist Party an aura of heroism and much more than a
handful of martyrs, things could have been different.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's economic and political crisis has had
its effect on local communism, of course. The Chilean party
aligned itself with Moscow since its very beginning and the
guidelines are now nonexistent. It was Mr. Guastavino himself
who said that losing the U.S.S.R. model was similar to Samson
being shorn of his hair.</p>
<p>But the main reasons for the current ailments of the
Chilean Communists are their own misjudgments. They never
thought Gen. Pinochet would lead a fair plebiscite while he
sought to stay in power. But he did. Much less that he would
organize free elections if he lost the plebiscite. But he
did. Even less that he would step down if his candidate
didn't win those elections. But he did.</p>
<p>The Communists insisted on overthrowing Gen. Pinochet with
weapons instead of using votes in political maneuvers. They
alienated the very same people they wanted to seduce when
they sponsored the creation of the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic
Front guerrilla army. They never understood that almost all
Chileans yearned for quietness, after the psychological and
physical wars of the Allende and Pinochet governments.</p>
<p>And the Communists were always late. Late to the massive
protest movements of the early '80s -- they declared 1986 as
the "decisive year" to overthrow Gen. Pinochet, when it was
obvious that all the momentum had waned. Late to the
plebiscite -- up to the very last minute they were telling
the people not to register and not to vote. Late to the
election of December 1989 -- they finally voted for the
current president, Patricio Aylwin, but had their own
separate list for Parliament and got no seats at all. A sad
story, for a party that had had 17% of Chilean votes.</p>
<p>They have also been late in adapting to the rules of
democracy and freedom of the press. They found themselves
suddenly with their own newspapers, radio station and
magazines, with the possibility of coming out in the open
with no threat of being imprisoned for their words. And they
haven't been able to cope with the new scenario properly.
After everyone else, they are trying to gather the 37,000
signatures of membership they need to register as a legal
political party. They are now, and have been for many years
in Chilean history, behind history. They haven't been able to
put their act together, perhaps because they have no act left
at all.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago marked a landmark for the Chilean left. It
was the 20th anniversary of Salvador Allende's election as
president. His family, back from exile, has built a huge
marble mausoleum for him in Santiago's main cemetery. He was
reburied on Sept. 4 with all the leftist parties present at
the burial.</p>
<p>The Communists were also there, of course. The Guastavinos
and the Teitelboims. It was their burial, too.</p>
