	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission
accused REC Investors Inc. of buying about $150 million of
securities without having enough money to pay for them.
   The complaint also named the firm's sole shareholder,
Robert E. Connors, and National State Bank of Summit, N.J.
The bank was accused of lending the firm money to buy the
stock with insufficient collateral.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to the commission, REC, based in Far Hills,
N.J., purchased about $150 million of securities without
sufficient funds to pay for the trades in 1987 and 1988. It
earned $2.6 million in profit on the trades.</p>
<p>At the same time the suit was filed, the defendants
settled, without admitting any violations. Under the consent
agreement, REC will disgorge $47,803, representing the costs
that the firm would have incurred, plus interest, had it
borrowed the funds in compliance with margin rules, which
allow investors to buy stock without putting up the full
cost.</p>
<p>Mr. Connors and the bank agreed to refrain from the
alleged violations in the future.</p>
<p>In a separate settlement of administrative proceedings
against REC and Mr. Connors, REC agreed to a censure from the
agency and Mr. Connors agreed to a 15-day suspension of
trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Connors couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.</p>
