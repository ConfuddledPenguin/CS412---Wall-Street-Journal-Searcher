	<p class="article-leader">The new joint venture in pharmaceuticals between Du Pont
Co. and Merck & Co. has recruited the former chief of
research and development at Genentech Inc. to lead its own
drug discovery efforts.
   David W. Martin Jr., formerly senior vice president,
research and development, at Genentech, is expected to be
named to the new position this month, if Du Pont and Merck
can iron out final details of their agreement by then.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dr. Martin, 49 years old, confirmed in an interview that
he has been named to head research and development at the
venture, called Du Pont Merck Pharmaceuticals Co. He remarked
that he was "within two days" of taking a position at a West
Coast biotech concern when the Du Pont-Merck offer beckoned.
He has been a consultant to Genentech since resigning from
his executive post at the South San Francisco, Calif.,
company last November.</p>
<p>Dr. Martin said the Du Pont-Merck venture attracted him
with the breadth of its technology and what he called the
commitment of the venture partners to long-term goals.
"They're careful in picking what they want to do, but they
don't change direction," he said.</p>
<p>The joint venture, announced in July, is a recent example
of the spate of cooperative ventures and mergers to crop up
among drug companies as they cope with growing research and
development costs and global competition. Du Pont, the
diversified chemicals concern based in Wilmington, Del., is
putting all its drug business into the venture. Merck, of
Rahway, N.J., is contributing rights to market some of its
drugs and an undisclosed amount of cash.</p>
<p>Merck, often called the premier drug research company in
its industry, is using the venture to tap the new-drug
pipeline at Du Pont. For Du Pont, the venture offers a quick
way to expand its presence abroad, through rights to certain
Merck products in Europe.</p>
<p>A Du Pont spokesman confirmed Dr. Martin's appointment but
declined to say whether the new company is looking outside to
fill other top positions.</p>
<p>A final agreement on the joint venture hasn't yet been
reached, but Joseph A. Mollica, currently a Du Pont vice
president, already has been named chief executive officer of
the new company. Dr. Martin will report to Mr. Mollica and
assume some of the research management tasks that Mr.
Mollica, a scientist by training, has had within Du Pont.</p>
<p>At Genentech, Dr. Martin presided over a research program
that has produced some of the early fruits of biotechnology,
such as genetically engineered human growth hormone, sold
under the trade name Protropin, and the heart drug known as
TPA or Activase. But at the Du Pont-Merck venture, he will be
managing a far larger staff, about 1,500 instead of the 700
at Genentech.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Merck said that officials who would be
familiar with appointments at the new company weren't
available for comment.</p>
