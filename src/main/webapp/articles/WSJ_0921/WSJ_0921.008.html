	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Minorco S.A., a Luxembourg-registered,
London-based holding company, said pretax profit jumped 41%
in the year ended June 30, partly reflecting the sale of its
stake in Consolidated Gold Fields PLC.
   Pretax profit for the group, whose holdings focus on
international mining and minerals operations, jumped to $223
million from $158 million. Sales rose 60% to $265 million
from $166 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>South African-controlled Minorco earned $1.6 billion on
the sale of its 29.9% stake in Consolidated Gold Fields to
Hanson PLC in August 1989, which followed its own aborted bid
for Gold Fields.</p>
<p>The sale helped double Minorco's year-end cash and
short-term investment holdings to $1.76 billion from $871
million and sent income on financial operations up 42% to
$236 million from $166 million.</p>
<p>Minorco also said Chester Crocker, former U.S. assistant
secretary of state for African affairs, has joined its board.</p>
<p>Profit after taxes and minority interests fell 18% to $229
million from $280 million, hurt by a sharp fall in
undistributed earnings on investments to $12.9 million from
$124 million a year earlier, when the holding in Gold Fields
was included. Earnings per share fell 18% to $1.35 from
$1.64.</p>
<p>Net profit attributable to shareholders, however, nearly
tripled to $784 million from $280 million, boosted by a $555
million extraordinary gain, representing profit on the Gold
Fields stake minus restructuring costs at its Engelhard Corp.
affiliate and a write-down of its interest in Western Gold
Exploration & Mining Co. A year earlier, Minorco had a
$100,000 extraordinary gain.</p>
<p>Sales were boosted by Minorco's higher income from
financial operations as well as the inclusion of $28.9
million in sales from Independence Mining Co., a U.S. gold
mining group that Minorco bought for $705 million in March.</p>
