	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The two German parliaments
independently ratified the treaty that will officially unify
their nations Oct. 3.
   But the long day of debate in the West German Bundestag
was marked by fierce skirmishes over the costs of
unification, particularly on whether new taxes are needed.
The question of whether German troops should be allowed to
deploy outside the boundaries of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization also generated heated words, as politicians
looked beyond Oct. 3 and began to stake out campaign stands
for the first all-German elections, on Dec. 2.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 1,000-page unification treaty details how all
functions of the East German state will be united with those
of West Germany under one government and parliament. For East
Germany's parliament, the Volkskammer, the vote was its last
important business before its dissolution in two weeks.</p>
<p>The Bundestag approved the treaty by 442-47; the
Volkskammer, by 299-80.</p>
