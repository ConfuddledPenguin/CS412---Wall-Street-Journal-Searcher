	<p class="article-leader">Drunks and tort lawyers are surely toasting this week's
award of $9 million to a visibly plastered Mexican dishwasher
who stumbled in front of a New York subway train and woke up
missing one arm. In awarding this jackpot, a Bronx jury
heaved all blame on the Transit Authority for failing to
"take charge" of the man.
   Other recent awards against the TA include $4.3 million
for a thug who was shot in the back by policemen and crippled
after mugging a 71-year-old man; $1.2 million for an
unsuccessful suicide who jumped in front of a train and lost
his legs; and $8.2 million for a homeless man who stumbled
over garbage left by other homeless people, fell onto the
subway tracks and was badly burned by the third rail, plus $5
million for a brother chasing him trying to take him home. If
the cases are typical, a third of the loot stands to go to
brazen and imaginative tort lawyers.</p>

jury's award. God save us is more like it.</p>
