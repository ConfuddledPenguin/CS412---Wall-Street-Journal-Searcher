	<p class="article-leader">Economic growth in Japan slowed to a 3.6% annual rate in
the second quarter of this year from an 11.4% pace in the
prior three months, but officials remained optimistic about
the economic outlook despite rising oil prices and interest
rates.
   The Economic Planning Agency said gross national product,
the nation's total output of goods and services, grew an
inflation-adjusted 0.9% in the calendar second quarter, which
is the first quarter of the Japanese fiscal year, from the
prior quarter. In the first quarter, GNP expanded 2.7% from
the preceding three months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite the slowing, agency officials said they don't
expect growth to be hindered, at least for the rest of the
year.</p>
<p>Domestic demand accounted for growth of 2.4% in the second
quarter compared with the prior quarter, but external demand
contracted 1.5%, resulting in the overall quarter-to-quarter
growth of 0.9%. Within Japan, such factors as personal
consumption and corporate investment in plant and equipment
have been expanding steadily.</p>
<p>The report comes amid growing concern about the global
economy and a world-wide squeeze on capital -- and the large
role that Japan plays in both. For instance, the recent
plunge in Tokyo's stock market is eroding the capital base of
Japan's big banks, which in turn is decreasing the flow of
capital to other countries. With less capital coming in to
the U.S., interest rates stay higher and economic recovery
could be delayed.</p>
<p>Shinyasu Hoshino, Economic Planning Agency administrative
vice minister, said there weren't any signs of an overheating
economy. He said that the economy is continuing to grow
smoothly in the current quarter and that there is no reason
for pessimism about 1990's final quarter.</p>
<p>In a bid to hold down inflation, the central bank has
raised its discount rate -- the rate it charges on loans to
financial institutions -- five times since May 1989, to 6%.</p>
<p>Many economists and analysts expect Japan, which depends
on imported oil for most of its energy needs, to cope well
with the surge in oil prices in the wake of Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait. But some research groups have said the higher
prices will curb economic growth in Japan.</p>
<p>Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist for Nomura Research
Institute, said higher interest rates and oil prices may
reduce the annual GNP growth rate by about 0.5 percentage
point in coming quarters. Still, he expects growth for the
current fiscal year of about 5%.</p>
<p>Mr. Okumura said that combined with the 11.4% annual
growth rate of the first quarter, the latest data show that
"the Japanese economy is expanding very smoothly."</p>
<p>Nomura Research forecasts real economic growth easing to
about 4% in the fiscal year starting next April 1, with
inflation in consumer and wholesale price inflation remaining
below 3%, Mr. Okumura said.</p>
<p>Some government economists have said that the central
bank's monetary tightening, as well as the yen's strength,
which makes imports denominated in other currencies --
including oil -- less expensive, will counterbalance the
impact of higher oil prices. Still, the government's forecast
of 4% growth in GNP for the current fiscal year is more
guarded than those of many private economists, who predict
expansions greater than 4%.</p>
<p>The economy has grown for 46 consecutive months, marking
the second-longest postwar expansion after a 57-month period
of growth between October 1965 and July 1970. Before the
Middle East crisis began, many economists had predicted that
the current expansion would break that record. Most retain
their optimism. A series of surveys conducted recently by the
Bank of Japan and the Finance Ministry also showed that the
economy is maintaining its momentum.</p>
<p>Kenneth Courtis, a Tokyo-based economist for Deutsche Bank
AG, noted that such indicators as auto sales, housing starts
and midyear bonuses point to "very strong" growth in the
current quarter. But he predicted capital spending by
Japanese corporations will tail off in coming months, partly
because higher oil prices are causing other countries to
reduce their growth projections.</p>
<p>Personal spending, which accounts for nearly 60% of GNP in
Japan, grew an inflation-adjusted 1.4% during the quarter
from the January-March period, when such spending rose 0.4%.
Corporate-equipment investment grew 3.8% from the
January-March quarter, when such investment expanded 3.5%.</p>
<p>Housing investment grew 1.8% in the latest quarter, down
from 2% in the January-March period.</p>
<p>External demand served to brake growth as exports fell
3.9% from the January-March quarter, when exports surged
9.1%, and as imports grew 3.2% from the prior three months,
when the pace was 2.1%.</p>
<p>Government capital spending in the second quarter grew
2.1%, compared with a 1.4% expansion in the first period.</p>
