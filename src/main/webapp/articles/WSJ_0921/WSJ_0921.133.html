	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- The inauguration of W. Wilson Goode in
January 1984 as this city's first black mayor brought joy
that the color barrier had finally been breached. It also
brought relief to many that the city had been narrowly spared
the return of Frank Rizzo, the tough ex-cop and former mayor
who had been such an embarrassment in the 1970s.
   "Never before did a mayor come into office with more
genuine support from all communities, from the business
community, from the neighborhoods," says G. Fred DiBona Jr.,
president of Independence Blue Cross, an early adviser to Mr.
Goode.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The honeymoon was sweet but short. Mr. Goode's two-term
tenure as mayor has become a tale of eroding power and
influence, especially with the city council and the state
legislature. It is a story of failures: failures to build
effective coalitions, resolve grudges, gain vital state
support and keep the city prospering.</p>
<p>Today, Philadelphia is on the verge of financial collapse
and political paralysis. The crisis has many sources, and
some are clearly beyond the mayor's control. But many of them
are traced to his troubled tenure, with its long string of
blunders, miscalculations and ruptured relationships.</p>
<p>The 52-year-old mayor says he deserves "as much blame as
any other elected official, but I'm not out there by myself."
While few would disagree, Harold A. Sorgenti, president of
Philadelphia's Arco Chemical Co., says that Mr. Goode "is not
the kind of person who could work the political system to his
advantage."</p>
<p>Mr. Goode had seemed the ideal man to unite the city.
Unlike mayors in Washington, Atlanta, Detroit and other big
cities, he didn't rise to power through black activism or
bloc politics. Instead, he was a manager, the embodiment of
the black professional as urban civil servant. For three
years, he had done a solid job as the city's managing
director, shepherding its resources and cutting waste with
cool efficiency.</p>
<p>His background, experience and credentials appealed to the
city's white establishment. Henry Wendt, then chief executive
of SmithKline Beckman Corp., and Roger Hillas, then president
of Provident National Bank, were close advisers. Top officers
of Arco Chemical, ARA Services Inc. and Hunt Manufacturing
Co. steered his finance committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Goode had a master's degree in government
administration from the University of Pennsylvania's
prestigious Wharton School and a preference for starched
collars and Brooks Brothers suits. But as the son of a
sharecropper and a deacon in his Baptist church, he also had
the support from the black community, where he carried 99% of
the vote.</p>
<p>On taking office Mr. Goode told Philadelphians: "We have
begun the process of healing the divisions of the past." He
pledged to make Philadelphia once again "a great place to
live, a great place to do business." People believed in him,
using words like renaissance and revitalization to describe
their hopes for Philadelphia. They even talked of Mr. Goode
as a Democratic contender for vice president.</p>
<p>Yet almost from the outset, he had difficulty controlling
Philadelphia's fractious and often clownish 17-member city
council. His distaste for closed-door political dealings
frustrated his reform initiatives. "I don't understand the
concept of government that says the mayor has to take other
elected officials in the back room, make deals with them,
twist their arms, threaten them in order to get done what
they ought to do," Mr. Goode himself acknowledges. "I'm not
from that school."</p>
<p>The mayor, now a lame duck, has stuck to his principles
and poured his heart into the job for seven grueling years.
Despite budget pressures, Mr. Goode has tried to maintain
essential services while providing for the city's needy. But
during that period, federal money for Philadelphia's social
services has almost disappeared, and state officials haven't
come to the rescue. The city budget has grown ever more
bloated, and the council has repeatedly declined to raise
taxes enough to balance it. Now the city is on the fiscal
rocks.</p>
<p>Faced with a cumulative deficit of $206.4 million in its
$2.2 billion budget for the current fiscal year, the fourth
deficit in a row, Philadelphia could run out of cash before
Christmas, perhaps before Thanksgiving. Last week, Mr. Goode
was forced to withdraw the city's plan to raise $375 million
by selling short-term notes after Swiss Bank Corp. yanked its
guarantees. Moody's Investors Service Inc. responded by
declaring the city's bonds, already at "junk" levels and the
lowest-rated city bonds in the nation, to be even riskier.
Then Standard & Poor's Corp. weighed in, slamming the city
even harder.</p>
<p>Further inaction could be disastrous. A default on the
city's bond debt, for which the city promises to pay interest
only until June 1991, probably would ruin Philadelphia's
credit for 10 to 12 years. Deep slashes in all kinds of city
services would become unavoidable. Insolvency also could
bring panic, accelerating the exodus of jobs that has cost
the city about 400,000 residents since 1970. Of those who
remain, one in every four lives below the federal poverty
line.</p>
<p>Philadelphia is the nation's fifth-largest city, with an
estimated population of 1,543,000. Nearly half the city's
residents are blacks, with Asians, Hispanics and other racial
minorities accounting for less than 15% of the population.
Strong ethnic neighborhoods -- Jewish, Italian, Irish and
Polish -- hold together large sections of the city's South
and Northeast sides. The city, founded as a Quaker colony by
William Penn and made famous by such early leaders as
Benjamin Franklin, still clings to some vestiges of the
Quaker tenet of political consensus.</p>
<p>Nobody would have found the mayor's job easy. Despite
Philadelphia's handsome skyline, tony historic district,
world-class orchestra, museums and medical research teams, it
suffers from a lack of civic spirit. Apathetic residents in
ethnic and blue-collar neighborhoods tolerate corrupt judges,
police and politicians. As is true with many decaying cities,
litter and potholes are everywhere. People sleep on the
sidewalks. The stench of urine and human feces often
permeates downtown streets, subway tunnels, and even City
Hall. Voters pay little attention to important issues and
problems, but nurture grudges for years if elected
representatives fail to attend a family funeral or
neighborhood picnic.</p>
<p>"The vast majority couldn't care less," says councilman
Thacher Longstreth. "That's the kind of citizenry we're
dealing with here."</p>
<p>Mr. Goode had hoped to overcome the apathy. Soon after he
took office, the city published a 12-page promotional
tabloid. "We're moving again, and the best is yet ahead]" Mr.
Goode wrote in an open letter. The cover showed happy,
cheering Philadelphians waving their index fingers: "We're
Number 1."</p>
<p>The cheering stopped and the high hopes crumbled on May
13, 1985, when Philadelphia police assaulted the fortified
rowhouse headquarters of a radical group called MOVE. They
shot 10,000 rounds into the house and dropped a bomb on the
roof. The resulting fire killed 11 people inside the house,
including five children, and reduced the entire neighborhood
-- two city blocks containing 61 homes -- to rubble.</p>
<p>A grand jury considered bringing criminal charges against
the mayor and his top aides, but dropped the idea.
Nevertheless, the grand jury concluded: "Goode delegated too
much, deferred too often, knew too little and asked too few
questions."</p>
<p>Mr. Goode's reputation has never fully recovered. Key
supporters in the business community, shocked by the mayor's
lack of control, began to distance themselves. SmithKline's
Mr. Wendt, once one of Mr. Goode's chief supporters and
advisers, disengaged. Mr. Wendt says through a spokesman that
he has been "out of touch" with city issues for so long that
he doesn't "feel comfortable" talking about the mayor. Says a
prominent banker: "We left Wilson Goode to swing in the
wind."</p>
<p>Mr. Goode's relationship with the city council also began
to sour.</p>
<p>He proposed building a trash-to-steam incinerator in South
Philadelphia. The need was urgent: The city had used up a
landfill in an adjacent county and was trucking garbage to
dumps as far away as North Carolina and Texas. But the
proposal immediately ran into neighborhood opposition, led by
one city council member. Mr. Goode couldn't marshal enough
support to counter it. Now the city must pay Waste Management
Inc. $54 million a year to haul its trash to a landfill just
outside of town.</p>
<p>To get the incinerator the city needed, the mayor wouldn't
politick. "He never went over to Lucien Blackwell's chambers.
He never went over to John Street's chambers," says former
city solicitor Seymour Kurland, referring to two of the city
council's most influential members. Instead, Mr. Kurland
says, the mayor called both men into his office, made a short
speech and then dismissed them by saying, "Thank you very
much." Other big projects, including a huge criminal courts
complex, also have been bungled to the detriment of
taxpayers.</p>
<p>But it has always been difficult for Philadelphia's mayors
to achieve rapport with the easily distracted city council.</p>
<p>Last year, the council engaged in a long and furious
debate over whether to declare June as Lesbian and Gay Pride
Month. "What is there to be proud of?" scoffed Councilman
Francis W. Rafferty. "They're sick people, no doubt about
it." Mr. Longstreth referred to homosexuals as "fairies." Mr.
Blackwell supported the resolution, which narrowly passed,
but he lamented the lack of a "magic potion" to "cure"
homosexuality.</p>
<p>By the time Mr. Goode narrowly won re-election in 1987 in
a rematch against Mr. Rizzo, the federal government had
already largely ended revenue-sharing with big cities. (In
1985 alone, $46.5 million disappeared from the budget.) Then
Philadelphia's budget wars began. Mr. Goode had assured the
voters that the budget was balanced and no new taxes were
needed. But the city ended that fiscal year with a $32.1
million deficit, its first under Mr. Goode.</p>
<p>The city council balked at a $126 million tax increase he
proposed. Instead, led by Mr. Street (the council's budget
expert, who filed for personal bankruptcy in 1987), the
council raised only $82.5 million in new taxes. The city
ended the next fiscal year with a deficit of $75.2 million.</p>
<p>The council's refusal to accept Mr. Goode's tax increases
has allowed rampant spending and revenue shortages. The
city's bloated, patronage-riddled court system, which is
controlled by elected judges and is supposed to be the
financial responsibility of the state, costs Philadelphia
about $144 million a year to operate. City prison employees
racked up $15 million of overtime pay last year. City garbage
collectors are paid about $13 an hour.</p>
<p>In fiscal 1990, about 9% of Philadelphia's total payroll
represented overtime and premium pay -- about double the rate
for New York City. The Pennsylvania Economy League says
Philadelphia's employee benefits are also among the most
generous anywhere, largely due to contracts negotiated before
Mr. Goode took office.</p>
<p>Even little things cost a lot here. The streets
department, which dispatches five-member crews just to fix
potholes, also spends over $1 million a year replacing bulbs
and paying the electricity tab for more than 22,000 street
lights in private alleys. Every summer for 10 years, the city
has paid to empty and refill a 70,000-gallon swimming pool
every day at the McVeigh Recreation Center in Northeast
Philadelphia, all because nobody would repair a broken pump
and filter.</p>
<p>Serious inefficiencies are built into the city charter and
civil-service rules. When the former water commissioner,
William J. Marrazzo, tried to buy a $300 lawnmower for his
department, he says he found the procurement process required
$200 worth of paper work and a long wait. As for managerial
discretion, civil-service rules permitted him to hire only
three people in his entire department: his secretary and two
deputy commissioners.</p>
<p>As the city's budget pressures grew, Mr. Goode failed to
build strong bridges to the state capital, where upstate and
rural legislators have always looked askance at the city.
While Pittsburgh has successfully lobbied for hundreds of
millions of dollars in recent years, Philadelphia never made
a persuasive case for its needs. State legislators say they
can't justify to their upstate constituents the funneling of
more money to Philadelphia until the city government develops
a coherent fiscal plan.</p>
<p>F. Joseph Loeper, a Delaware County Republican who is the
state's senate majority leader, says, "Philadelphia is a
place where state dollars pour into and disappear." Mr.
Goode's fellow Democrat, Gov. Robert P. Casey, also has kept
his distance from Philadelphia's mess while he runs for
re-election.</p>
<p>No one can say who the city will rally behind when Mr.
Goode leaves office in l992. No single figure has emerged
among the Democrats, who hold a voter-registration advantage
of about four to one over Republicans. Mr. Blackwell and
George Burrell Jr., both black, probably would seek to match
Mr. Goode's big election margins. But many other possible
candidates could emerge, including a former city prosecutor,
a former city controller and a former chancellor of the
Philadelphia Bar Association. On the Republican side, Mr.
Rizzo threatens yet another bid.</p>
<p>The current crisis shows how badly the city's political
system has broken down. Last week, Mr. Goode called for an
end to the brawling that has brought Philadelphia to the
brink. Instead, council members, just back from summer
recess, devoted their first session to such weighty matters
as approving parades and a physical-fitness walkathon with
local celebrities.</p>
<p>While the Bible-quoting Mr. Blackwell delivered a
55-minute tirade against new taxes, his colleague Angel L.
Ortiz vacantly tossed an apple in the air. The bored budget
expert, Mr. Street, walked out.</p>
<p>Can Philadelphia extricate itself from the financial
morass? No analogies in other big cities are perfect, but
others have managed to come back from the brink. In the
1970s, New York had to grant powers to an independent
administrative board and wrangle state guarantees before it
could restore much of its fiscal health. More recently,
Cleveland dug itself out of a financial hole, and Detroit
averted a fiscal crisis when the Michigan Legislature granted
the city an emergency extension of its electricity-taxing
authority.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia's case, state law would preclude the
imposition of a New York-style authority. But new initiatives
were under way this week to seek loans or guarantees from
foreign banks, and there was talk of imposing on local banks
a requirement to contribute to a bailout.</p>
<p>Potential solutions abound -- but no one can agree on
which to pursue. Mr. Goode wants tax increases, more state
aid and the sale of the city's sports stadium and parking
garages. Mr. Blackwell wants city unions to defer negotiated
wage increases and proposes selling the airport. Mr. Burrell
demands the resignation of the city finance director.
Councilwoman Joan Krajewski wants $150 million in private
donations. Councilman James Tayoun advocates an independent
board to oversee the city's finances because "nobody in the
world trusts us anymore."</p>
<p>Business leaders have yet to offer substantive help in the
crisis. Large local banks wouldn't give even token guarantees
of $15 million each for the short-term notes the city tried
unsuccessfully to float last week. The chamber of commerce
called an emergency "summit" meeting Wednesday, but no
elected officials except the mayor and the city controller
bothered to show up.</p>
<p>As anxieties mount, Mr. Goode says he is open to new ideas
and looking for common ground. But his attitude suggests that
the gap may be hard to close. "We'll get it done," he says.
"My way."</p>
