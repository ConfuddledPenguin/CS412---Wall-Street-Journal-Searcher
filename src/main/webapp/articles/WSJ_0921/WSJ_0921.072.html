	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Lonrho PLC, the U.K. trading conglomerate,
served a high-court writ on the three Al-Fayed brothers in a
long-running dispute over their takeover of Harrods
department store.
   Lonrho is claiming back the 29.9% stake in the House of
Fraser that it sold to the Al-Fayeds in 1984 as well as the
tranfer to Lonrho of all the rest of the shares in House of
Fraser, a stores group that owns the prestigious London
department store Harrods.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1985 the Al-Fayeds bought House of Fraser for 615
million pounds ($1.2 billion).</p>
<p>Lonrho has fought a prolonged battle to undo the Al-Fayed
takeover after its own efforts to buy House of Fraser were
blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in 1981.</p>
<p>Under the latest court action, Lonrho is demanding that
the Al-Fayeds clear House of Fraser of debt before handing
the stores group over to the company.</p>
<p>In a statement, House of Fraser called the writ "the last
gasp of the longest whinge in British commercial history."
The statement went on to say that the Al-Fayeds "acquired
House of Fraser fairly and squarely" and that the company
"will strenuously defend any proceedings which Lonrho sees
fit to bring. House of Fraser extends its sympathy to the
Lonrho shareholders who are being forced willy nilly to
finance this obsession."</p>
