	<p class="article-leader">WELCOME, HORST and Vlad and Todor and Piotr and, yes, even
you, Boris] The era of international opportunity is
thundering down upon us, and the borders that distinguished
the old global order are fast becoming history. The world is
opening like a giant bazaar, and in the not-too-distant
future it is possible to see one giant market speaking one
common language: capitalism. Bravo]
   Many who ply their trade on an international scale will
find it necessary to conduct some business right here in the
U.S.A., even if we aren't the big shots we used to be. We
want to do our share to help you. So here's our contribution:
some all-American rules for non-U.S. business people as they
wend their way around our halls of commerce.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tip 1</p>
<p>JUST SAY YO]: At the start of any good American business
relationship is a lusty American greeting. A crusty
end-of-the-paw squeeze from a knobby cluster of British
digits leaves a lot of us understandably cold. So get in
there right off the bat and let us know you're darned happy
to see us. Who knows? It just might be great to know us]</p>
<p>Tip 2</p>
<p>SISTERHOOD IS INEXORABLE: Cut out that sexism] Honestly.</p>
<p>A female executive I know visited Japan a couple of years
ago. She was one of about six people who could talk about her
highly technological subject intelligently. She appeared in
the board room of the corporation pumped for a serious
meeting. She wore her best suit. Within 15 minutes every
senior Japanese official in the room had politely asked where
her husband was. She replied that her husband was at home in
New York, taking care of their three-year-old daughter. At
last it dawned on them: She was a secretary. They brusquely
asked to see her boss. She made it clear that she was IT. The
meeting proceeded. The only other thing to report is that
about halfway through the morning, my friend asked for
directions to the Ladies' Room. There wasn't one.</p>
<p>Come on, guys. American women aren't going to go away even
if you want them to. They're fit. They're rested. And they
came to play. Get with the program.</p>
<p>Tip 3</p>
<p>EAT, DRINK AND BE MERRY: Americans love lunch. We also
love breakfast and dinner. We'll even take a short snack, if
we must. And in this era of contracting budgets, we do esteem
those who feed and water us, whether the plastic is
indigenous or imported from some outlandish location.</p>
<p>Remember, however, that most sane Americans still view
such digestive events as essentially social. And watch that
menu, OK? This is dinner, not a round of "quien es muy
macho." A pal of mine was over in Japan to close a deal not
long ago. In the midst of negotiations, the group repaired to
dinner. While eating his lobster, my friend was jolted when
the creature turned its eye stalks around and gazed directly
at him. It was . . . alive.</p>
<p>Don't forget: We like to kill our food before we eat it.
You know that. Be nice.</p>
<p>Tip 4</p>
<p>THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS STRANGE: We're Americans] You may
think you know us from Radio Free Europe or the Voice of
America. But there are some things that may still surprise
you. We don't take naps after lunch or drink tea unless we're
sick, and we eat our salad before the main course. We're
proud of the way we do things over here, even when we don't
do them very well. And we have needs, see? Are you listening?
Do you really and truly care? We'll love you for it]</p>
<p>Tip 5</p>
<p>NO GLOATING: The Germans have the World Cup. The Poles
have the Pope. The Japanese have their entire perception of
their perfect culture. We had advertising. Now the British
have it. That's fine. All's fair. But as you proceed to buy
our businesses and mesmerize our consumers, try not to be so
gosh darned jolly about it. Just do it.</p>
<p>Tip 6</p>
<p>SPEAK SOFTLY BUT CARRY A BIG BERLITZ: Last month I tried
to put together a Korean-manufactured product. It was
intended to be a bicycle when completed. About halfway
through, I read something like: "Inserting pivot A axle and
carefully into B groove not intended until sprocket assembly
remaining when open (see Fig.32B)."</p>
<p>We expect this from instruction manuals. We actually
relish it. But not in person. When it comes to face-to-face
conversation, we turn hopelessly xenophobic. Please to not it
forget.</p>
<p>Tip 7
</p>
<p>BROWN SHOES DON'T MAKE IT: Tune into the culture, babe. In
most places except Los Angeles, the heavy business uniform is
still dark blue or gray in winter and khaki on the most
informal days of summer. A sport coat? Grow up.</p>
<p>This is as it should be. People are doing serious business
here, or like to think they are. We don't, on the other hand,
like to look like a bunch of FBI guys. Take my advice. Leaf
through a couple of recent Esquires or GQs. Then go shopping.</p>
<p>Tip 8</p>
<p>CHARITY BEGINS WITH CONSULTING: So OK. Our products aren't
necessarily the best. Our management style needs honing. Our
workers are expensive and sometimes unproductive. We messed
ourselves up] We admit it]</p>
<p>But we are the only ones who truly understand how we broke
things bad enough to fix them. And pretty soon, thanks to our
performance in the '80s, a lot of us will be out there on the
street, offering our wisdom. So hire us. Be forewarned: We
don't come cheap. The going rate is $1,000 a day, minimum.
Rest assured, though. We'll be forever grateful, and you'll
get a full two-page report at the end of every month.</p>
<p>Tip 9</p>
<p>AS LONG AS YOU HAVE YOUR HEALTH. . . : Chill out, dudes.
Wake up and smell the coffee. Stop and smell the roses. The
bird that's too early can end up with nothing but worms. The
1990s will be all about the reduction of international
stress. You first.</p>
