	<p class="article-leader">MOUNT MITAKE, Japan -- The secluded mountain inn
reverberates with dedicated Japanese salespeople in a heated
all-night corporate meeting.
   Leaders pepper their talk with inspirational quotations
from Japanese business heroes. Eager colleagues scribble down
notes. Aspiring workers stand up and pledge to reach higher
sales goals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Welcome to Amway -- literally the American Way -- Japanese
style. The 50 Japanese spending a recent weekend together are
marketers of the detergents, vitamins and cosmetics of Amway
Corp., the Michigan-based direct-marketing empire.</p>
<p>Amway's ability to graft Japanese traditions onto its
quintessentially American corporate culture has brought it
tremendous success in a market where many another American
company has stumbled. And the magnetism of Amway for hundreds
of thousands of Japanese Amway distributors speaks volumes
about the ways in which Japanese society is changing -- and
the ways that it's not.</p>
<p>Many of the distributors are refugees from the
stultifying, hierarchical world of Japanese big business.
They want to work for themselves, and be paid according to
their performance, not according to their seniority. The
growing numbers of people who feel the way they do mark a big
change in Japanese society.</p>
<p>The opportunity to escape from Japan's rigid seniority
system, still prevalent in much of corporate Japan, lures
younger distributors in their 20s and early 30s to join
Amway. In contrast, their American counterparts are often
retirees.</p>
<p>"People are starting to wonder what they could do as a
single gear in a company," says 33-year-old Junichi Ebine, a
Tokyo distributor and part-time jewelry wholesaler. "They
want to have fun, they want to do something. But they have
nothing. When they join Amway, there's something that
clicks."</p>
<p>Once they start to make sales calls, the very Americanness
of the business -- from the bold English labels on the bulky
cleanser containers, to handshakes at meetings and American
concepts -- is a plus in a country that still retains its
fascination with things Western.</p>
<p>But the real secret of the distributors' success lies in
the way Amway's cultish corporate culture plays to Japan's
unchanged emphasis on close personal relationships and group
mentality. Japan's Amway distributors take these values to an
extreme.</p>
<p>Amway encourages those who buy its products to sell to
others. When they're getting started (and some never get
beyond that stage), they can do the work in their spare time,
so they don't have to risk quitting a well-established
lifetime job in a Japanese company until they're sure they
can succeed in their new role.</p>
<p>As in the U.S., Amway's Japanese distributors gain 30%
commission on products they sell, as well as handsome bonuses
for new members they bring in.</p>
<p>Despite Amway distributors' leaning toward an American
life style, their business tactics are often typically
Japanese. In a society where building one's "jinmyaku", or
network of human contacts, is everything, selling a product
through acquaintances works particularly well.</p>
<p>Nobuyuki Kakuwa, 33 years old, who quit his machinery
business three years ago to push Amway products with his
wife, says his work involves a "sticky personal
relationship," ubiquitous in the Japanese society. When
acquaintances start getting annoyed with his recruiting phone
calls, "I take them out to dinner and listen to them grumble"
about life, he says. "Then, if that's the way you feel, I
say, you should start doing Amway." The effort has rewarded
him an "American-style" apartment, complete with a barbecue
set, he states proudly.</p>
<p>Amway's culture encourages group meetings and pep rallies.
In Japan, just as salarymen go drinking with colleagues after
work, Amway distributors get together for "after-Amway"
dinners. They voluntarily sacrifice as many as two weekends a
month to absorb the secrets of success, and show their
dedication by vowing to reach the next rung in the Amway
ladder.</p>
<p>Eager distributors are spreading the word to Japanese
friends in California, and even company executives in New
York. The businesslike attitudes of American distributors
shock them. "People in America separate their work from the
days they take off," says an Amway member, who just came back
from a tour of the U.S. "But in Japan, you'd never refuse
someone who needs a hand on a particular day."</p>
<p>The results in Japan are impressive indeed. For the year
ended August, only Amway's 11th in Japan, the company expects
to report that sales jumped 20% from the previous year's 76.5
billion yen ($555.9 million), more than a quarter of the
company's world-wide total and nearly equaling Amway's sales
in the U.S., where it has operated for 31 years. William
Hemmer, president of the Japanese unit, even says that
Amway's Japanese sales may eventually surpass its American
sales.</p>
<p>Amway's direct-distribution system -- which lets it
end-run Japan's complex and import-resistant layers of
middlemen -- also has helped it to succeed. Amway ships 75%
of its 200 products from its rural Ada, Mich., headquarters;
the rest are made locally. Then it sells its goods directly
through its 700,000 distributors, who are also among its
customers.</p>
<p>Some question how long Amway will retain its American
connection. Local newspapers have been speculating recently
that the company is looking for Japanese buyers for the Japan
unit. Other American direct marketers in Japan such as
Shaklee Corp. have sold out to Japanese. Even Avon Products
Inc., while successful, has become a takeover target. Amway
officials flatly deny such speculation.</p>
<p>To be sure, not all Japanese consumers have a rosy image
of the company. Since direct marketing first landed in Japan
more than 20 years ago, shady salesmen selling everything
from futon mattresses to English-language cassettes have
duped crowds of gullible consumers.</p>
<p>Amway itself was criticized for aggressive recruiting
tactics when its sales suddenly started soaring five years
ago. Distributors complain that although few of their friends
doubt the quality of Amway products, some ask if the business
is a shaky pyramidal scheme, or mock them for selling their
souls to the devil.</p>
<p>The strong bonds among distributors is a bit much for
some. "It's like they're hypnotized," says Yoshio Terada,
president of Step K.K., a discount-store chain near Tokyo.
"They don't feel it if you kick them." Unhappy that Amway
limits its product channel to its distributors, one retailer
secretly buys the products himself and displays them in one
of his stores.</p>
<p>Amway's continued expansion is causing Japanese copycats
to sprout. Daiei Inc., Japan's biggest retail chain, two
years ago set up its own direct marketing business called
X-One, promoting similar products like cleansers and shampoo.</p>
<p>Now, Amway is moving to step up its image in Japan. Last
year, it started advertising on television and in magazines.
It's sponsoring classical concerts. It's tying up with
Japanese and foreign companies to promote drinking glasses,
kitchen knives and electric cooking rings in Japan.</p>
<p>For Amway's Japanese distributor/customers, with their
strong sense of enthusiasm and group loyalty, nothing that
says Amway can be bad. If polo shirts with an Amway logo were
to go on sale, says Kyoko Ebine, Mr. Ebine's wife, "we'd line
up to buy them."</p>
