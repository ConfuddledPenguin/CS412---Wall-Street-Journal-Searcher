	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Assets of the nation's 524 money market
funds rose $1.72 billion to $408.76 billion in the week ended
Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute, a
Washington-based trade association.
   Assets of 256 general-purpose funds rose $1.05 billion to
$144.85 billion, and assets of 105 broker-dealer funds rose
$40.9 million to $165.61 billion. Assets of 163 institutional
funds rose $629.5 million to $98.30 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite light trading with narrowly fluctuating money
market fund yields and short-term interest rates, "assets of
money market funds rose nonetheless by a substantial amount,
reflecting investors' basic predilection for safety in times
of economic uncertainty," said Jacob Dreyer, chief economist
at the Institute.</p>
<p>Fund assets were revised for the week ended Sept. 12, to
$407.04 billion. The increase reported for that week was
revised to $497.8 million.</p>
