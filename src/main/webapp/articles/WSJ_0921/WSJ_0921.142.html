	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Business expectations for sales and profits
have hit a seven-year low, the latest quarterly survey by Dun
& Bradstreet Corp. indicates.
   However, Joseph W. Duncan, economist and chief
statistician at the business information marketing concern,
cautioned that the results "may have been exaggerated by the
high levels of anxiety" immediately after the Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait by Iraq. The survey was conducted from Aug. 12 to
Aug. 30. "Until further data become available, the outlook
for a recession remains uncertain," he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The survey found manufacturers to be the most pessimistic
group, with the sales optimism index for the fourth quarter
falling to 47 from 66 in the third quarter. Overall, the
index fell to 50 from 60, the lowest level since the 1983
first quarter.</p>
<p>The profits optimism index for all companies fell 10
points to 43, with manufacturers' expectations falling 14
points to 44 from 58. The survey found expectations for
higher selling prices rising three points to 33.</p>
<p>Dun & Bradstreet's survey interviewed 1,500 executives in
manufacturing, retailing and wholesaling. The quarterly
survey asks whether executives expect an increase, decrease
or no change in measures such as sales, profits, prices and
employment. The index reported in each category represents
the difference between those expecting an increase and those
expecting a decrease.</p>
<p>The employment optimism index fell six points to 11, its
lowest level in nearly eight years, while the new orders
index among manufacturers fell 16 points to 46.</p>
