	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Adding to an already long list of companies it
is suing for patent infringement, computer-chip giant Texas
Instruments Inc. filed suit last Thursday against mail-order
computer firm Dell Computer Corp.
   TI asked the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Texas to assess a dollar amount for damages, claiming that
Dell, of Austin, Texas, violated several key patents in
building its personal computers. "People who make PC clones
generally violate our patents," a TI spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>TI and Dell had been discussing patent issues since April.
"We were very surprised when they filed," said a Dell
spokesman.</p>
<p>Dell says the suit is without merit -- merely another
example of TI's overactive legal department. Within the past
year, TI has sued its own customers and competing U.S. chip
firms on patent-related matters. Among those companies are
Zenith Data Systems Corp., Analog Devices Inc. and LSI Logic
Corp.</p>
<p>Dell is the second Texas computer maker this month to spar
in court over patents with TI. Tandy Corp. on Sept. 6 alleged
that TI broke federal antitrust laws by falsely claiming
ownership of certain microprocessor technologies. Tandy also
alleged that TI demanded unreasonably high royalty payments.</p>
<p>Japanese chip firms have also accused TI of demanding
exorbitant royalty rates. A Japanese press report said TI
demanded 10% of the wholesale value of products using chips
based on a TI patent. TI would not confirm the report.</p>
