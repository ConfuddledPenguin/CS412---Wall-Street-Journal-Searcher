	<p class="article-leader">Air France's board decided to intensify the French-owned
airline's cost-cutting program in response to an estimated
loss of 170 million French francs ($32.3 million) in the
first half and oil-related difficulties anticipated in the
second half.
   The board also delayed until 1991 any non-aircraft
investments planned for the rest of this year, while
nonessential work on buildings or information systems has
effectively been canceled.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Air France also adopted a hiring freeze, with the
exception of navigation personnel, while the airline's
program of chartering planes from other companies will be
phased out following the charter in January of a Boeing 747.</p>
<p>The measures follow Air France Chairman Bernard Attali's
announcement in June that the company is cutting back flights
on some less-traveled routes in the face of sluggish traffic
growth.</p>
<p>Air France had consolidated net profit after payments to
minority interests of 841 million francs in 1989 on revenue
of 39.6 billion francs.</p>
