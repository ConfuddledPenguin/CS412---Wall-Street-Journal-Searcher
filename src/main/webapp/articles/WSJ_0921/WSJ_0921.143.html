	<p class="article-leader">Corroon & Black Corp. refused Aon Corp.'s request for a
meeting to discuss its $40-a-share, or $840 million, bid.
   In a letter to Patrick G. Ryan, Aon's chairman and chief
executive officer, Corroon's Chairman and Chief Executive
Richard Miller said "the board has unanimously rejected Aon's
demands for a meeting to discuss its proposal and for an
opportunity to conduct a due diligence examination of New
York-based insurer Corroon & Black.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After Aon's offer was rebuffed by Corroon's board late
Tuesday, the Chicago insurer said it would leave its all-cash
bid on the table. But Wednesday, Aon's Mr. Ryan reiterated
that he wouldn't pursue the offer if Corroon's board
continues to oppose it.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller also reiterated that Corroon's board believes
its previously announced merger with international insurance
broker Willis Faber PLC of London "is in the best interests
of Corroon & Black shareholders . . ."</p>
<p>The Willis Faber merger is currently valued at
$31.38-a-share, or $643.3 million, based on yesterday's
closing price. In London trading yesterday, Willis Faber
shares closed at 214 pence, up 4 pence.</p>
<p>When Willis Faber made its merger proposal to Corroon on
June 4, the offer was valued at $34.72 a share, or $712.3
million.</p>
<p>Corroon shareholders are set to vote on the Willis Faber
merger next Friday.</p>
<p>Corroon shares fell $1.125 to $30.875 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Aon officials weren't immediately available
for comment late yesterday afternoon.</p>
