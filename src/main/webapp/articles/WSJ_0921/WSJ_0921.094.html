	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Is President Bush willing to impose a death
sentence on Americans held hostage by Saddam Hussein?
   Mr. Bush insists the Iraqi dictator's threats to use U.S.
citizens as shields against an American attack, or even to
starve them, won't weaken his demand that Iraq withdraw from
Kuwait. He feels that a preoccupation with hostages' safety
wrecked Jimmy Carter's presidency and nearly derailed Ronald
Reagan's. "Our hearts go out to the hostages and their
families. But our policy cannot change. And it will not
change," the president told Congress last week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So far, the president's tough stance against Saddam
Hussein wins public support. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News
poll taken earlier this week found that 53% of the registered
voters responding would favor the U.S. taking military action
against Iraq while there are still American hostages in Iraq
and Kuwait, while 34% would oppose such action. "At this
stage, the public is saying, `We're playing for keeps,'" say
pollsters Robert Teeter and Peter Hart, who conducted the
survey. "The idea that the hostages may get harmed is
accepted."</p>
<p>But if the Persian Gulf crisis drags on, public pressure
against jeopardizing hostages' lives could mount, posing a
tough test of Mr. Bush's determination to break a 10-year
pattern of manipulation of the U.S. by hostage-takers.</p>
<p>"There's a big distinction between the short-term, when
people are rallying around the president and the flag, and
what happens month after month when either there's a deadlock
or a very bad turn in the military situation," warns James
McGregor Burns, a Williams College political scientist and an
authority on the presidency.</p>
<p>Indeed, as Mr. Bush spoke last week, there were some faint
sounds of discontent. "The president's statement came across
like a death sentence," says Michael Saba, an Illinois
businessman who founded Coming Home, a group that is
organizing hostage-family members to push for the release of
Americans trapped by Iraq's invasion, now estimated at 1,350
citizens. "Our people are saying that there just have to be
other ways to meet the president's objectives."</p>
<p>Mr. Saba, who was in Baghdad when Iraq invaded Kuwait but
escaped seven days later, says the 500 family members he has
contacted are upset that Mr. Bush lists freeing the hostages
last after his other goals of forcing Iraq to withdraw,
restoring Kuwait's government and ensuring regional security.
"Does the fourth goal have a lower value than the other
three?" he asks. The group plans to focus its attention on
Congress, he says.</p>
<p>For now, most lawmakers strongly support Mr. Bush's
policy. The hostages "are in our prayers but they cannot
dominate our planning," said Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.),
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, as he led a
congressional delegation on a visit to Saudi Arabia recently.
"You can't run a foreign policy on hostages," agreed GOP Sen.

<p>Senior Bush administration officials say that from the
beginning of the Gulf crisis there was little debate over how
to handle the hostage issue. While everything possible would
be done to safeguard the hostages, says a senior official, it
was understood that if they got caught in harm's way, that
would be a necessary consequence of dealing with the
situation created by Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush's views on dealing with hostage situations were
formed when he was vice president and chaired a task force on
combatting terrorism, says Marlin Fitzwater, the White House
spokesman. "The hostage position is so well known and
strongly felt" following the experiences in Iran and Lebanon,
says Mr. Fitzwater, that "it's just not a matter that's been
open to negotiations" during the current crisis.</p>
<p>The 1986 task force report stressed that the U.S.
shouldn't make concessions to terrorists -- a mistake that
was being made by the Reagan administration, which was
trading arms to Iran for hostages, even as the report was
being written. According to a member of the task force, the
classified version of the report referred more specifically
to hostage-holding. It concluded that "there are so many
Americans wandering around the world, that if you make
concessions to win someone's release, the terrorists can
easily take another," the task force member said.</p>
<p>From the beginning of the Gulf crisis, the administration
played down the hostage aspect, referring to the Americans
trapped in Iraq and Kuwait as "detainees." When asked about
the status of these U.S. citizens on Aug. 14, Mr. Bush said:
"The status is inconvenienced people who want to get out." He
waited until Aug. 20, during a speech to the Veterans of
Foreign Wars, to use the word "hostage."</p>
<p>Despite his tough stance, however, President Bush at times
violates his own rules about maintaining a low public profile
on the hostage issue. Long before the Persian Gulf troubles,
when the focus was on Lebanon, a decision had been made to
not greet freed hostages at the White House, according to an
administration official. But last April, when hostage-takers
in Lebanon released Robert Polhill, Mr. Bush invited him for
a visit.</p>
<p>And Vice President Dan Quayle said in an interview earlier
this week that "not a day goes by without an inquiry about
the hostages. They're very much on {Mr. Bush's} mind. We're
in constant contact with the families."</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzwater insists that 10 years of agonizing over
hostages has taught officials and the public valuable lessons
about dealing with the problem. He said Mr. Bush isn't
getting the kind of pressure from hostage families that he
did when, as vice president, he was the Reagan
administration's liaison to the families of U.S. hostages
held in Lebanon. "People understand the policy," Mr.
Fitzwater asserts, adding that some hostage families now
realize that negotiations for some hostages only prolongs
captivity for everybody else.</p>
<p>But Noel Koch, who headed the Pentagon's counter-terrorism
effort from 1981 to 1986, warns that this could be the calm
before a storm. "It's still early in the game. Until this
thing becomes protracted and the suffering sets in or people
start getting killed, there will be a tendency on the part of
the families to keep quiet. But that could change abruptly."</p>
