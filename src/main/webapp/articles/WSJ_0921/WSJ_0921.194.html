	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on
about $2.17 billion of debt issued by Norwest Corp. and a
unit, citing "the risks associated with Norwest's current
strategy of acquiring weaker financial institutions" to
expand its banking franchise.
   S&P said the Minneapolis bank holding concern's pending
stock-swap acquisition of lower-rated United Banks of
Colorado "will present exceptional challenges to Norwest's
management given the sluggish economy {in Colorado} and
United Banks' high-risk profile." United Banks' $6.3 billion
in assets will represent nearly 20% of Norwest's total after
the acquisition is concluded.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The "majority of Norwest units continue to perform well,"
S&P said, adding that the company's exposure to such
high-risk assets as loans for commercial real estate,
high-leverage transactions, and loans to lesser developed
countries are "modest relative to {its} peers."</p>
<p>S&P lowered its ratings on senior debt of Norwest Corp.
and its Norwest Financial Inc. unit to single-A-plus from
double-A-minus; reduced subordinated debt of the parent and
unit to single-A from single-A-plus; trimmed Norwest Corp.'s
preferred stock to single-A-minus from single-A; and lowered
commercial paper for Norwest and Norwest Financial to A-1
from A-1-plus.</p>
<p>Norwest chief financial officer John T. Thornton called
the downgrading unjustified. "Frankly, we were really
disappointed" with the action, which the company found "a
little bit surprising," he said. Standard & Poor's "has
oriented itself toward the acquisition risk," he said, even
though Norwest had stressed to the rating concern the
"improvement in our capital ratios" over the past couple of
years, and "the extensive due diligence" it carries out prior
to its bank acquisitions.</p>
