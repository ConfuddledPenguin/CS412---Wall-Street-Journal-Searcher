	<p class="article-leader">New Jersey began a bounty program to reward state
residents who blow the whistle on polluters.
   Under the program, started Wednesday, anyone with a tip
that results in a civil or criminal fine for illegally dumped
waste, including garbage, medical waste, toxic chemicals and
low-level radioactive waste, will receive either 10% or $250
of the fine collected, whichever is greater. For information
resulting in the arrest and conviction of anyone illegally
storing or dumping hazardous or low-level radioactive waste,
the reward is 50% of the penalty collected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We want to enlist every citizen in New Jersey in the
fight to protect our clean air and water," Gov. Jim Florio
said in a statement. "We need seven million pairs of eyes
looking out for polluters."</p>
