	<p class="article-leader">IT'S ALMOST A GIVEN: Japanese companies will penetrate the
European market with the same ease as they came to dominate
so much of American industry.
   Think again.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japanese companies face obstacles in Europe that they
never had to face in the U.S. Some companies are clearly up
to the task. But it's equally clear that many of the skills
that served the Japanese so well in the U.S. will not
automatically work in Europe.</p>
<p>The accompanying diagram -- prepared by Industrial Bank of
Japan -- illustrates Japan's problem (see accompanying
illustration -- WSJ Sept. 21, 1990). It shows the
globalization cycle in Europe, as companies move from being
strictly exporters to running fully localized operations.</p>
<p>Each step in the cycle has been a response to European
Community pressure. Early on, the Japanese exported
low-priced products to the EC. But those shipments ran into
import quotas and anti-dumping duties. The Japanese responded
by establishing European plants to assemble imported parts.
But the EC countered with local-content rules and higher
duties on imported components.</p>
<p>As the Japanese shifted more production to the EC, they
found that they had to abide by even stricter "rules of
origin," which require them to manufacture the core parts of
a product in the EC. Their willingness to transfer technology
and appoint European nationals to top management posts now
has become the final test of their right to be treated as "EC
corporations," with the right to freely trade within the EC's
prospective single market.</p>
<p>American companies don't face the same adjustment: They
have long operated their European operations as local
companies. But the Japanese have focused their sights largely
on the U.S. and Asia -- where the pressures have so far
stopped short of demands for full technology transfer and
requirements for regional headquarters and local management.
"Europe is the most advanced right now" in inducing foreign
players to localize, says Susumu Taketomi, chief financial
economist of Industrial Bank of Japan, Japan's largest
long-term credit bank.</p>
<p>One plus for the Japanese: They are acquiring management
strategies that could be applied in the U.S. if this country
ever decides to adopt EC-style rules for market entry.</p>
<p>Two Japanese multinationals, Nissan Motor Co. and Fujitsu
Ltd., have been successful at meeting most of the EC
standards. Nissan opened a plant in Spain in 1981 and another
in England in 1986, and both are operating on an 80%
local-content basis.</p>
<p>France has indicated that it will treat Nissan's
English-built cars as British cars for customs purposes.
Nissan has further formalized its European presence with a
regional headquarters, called Nissan Europe N.V., in
Amsterdam. Moreover, Nissan is upgrading the quality of its
EC-based technology; its design center in Sunderland,
England, is designing cars for the British market.</p>
<p>Fujitsu is also expanding its European presence in stages.
The Japanese computer maker began modestly by supplying
mainframes to be marketed under Siemen A.G.'s brand and
producing smaller computers and printers in Malaga, Spain. In
1981 Fujitsu began assembling semiconductors in Ireland. Last
year it announced plans to build a more sophisticated plant
in England to produce the latest generation of computer
memories as well as semi-customized integrated circuits.</p>
<p>Fujitsu's biggest step so far is the purchase of 80% of
International Computers Ltd., Britain's leader in this field.
The acquisition overcomes many EC barriers. Fujitsu's joint
venture with Telefonica S.A. of Spain is intended to explore
leading-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence.</p>
