	<p class="article-leader">Regarding your Aug. 31 Enterprise story "Fiberglass's Long
Life Is Sinking Sailboat Producers," I don't agree with the
contention that the sailboat industry is suffering from
"design constipation" and that all it needs is an infusion of
innovative design to free it from diminishing sales figures.
   My experience from retailing more than 4,000 fiberglass
boats and having represented more than 50 national
manufacturers the past 20 years that have gone belly up,
leads me to somewhat other conclusions. One concerns the
significant lifestyle change of the 25-to-40-year-olds. With
a majority of the families having both partners working full
time, there is not the time to sail on weekends. The careful
planning necessary to juggle a weekend family junket aboard a
sailboat, such as food preparation, fueling, trip planning,
marina reservations, weather, balancing children's lessons
and other family commitments, requires hours of time not
available anymore to the nonexistent "stay-at-home" member of
the family. Making boats go faster or simpler to operate will
not bring back the market. Only a return to a former familial
life style will, and this is not likely in the near future.</p>
