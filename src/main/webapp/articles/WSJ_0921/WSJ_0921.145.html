	<p class="article-leader">Asarco Inc., a New York-based nonferrous metals, specialty
chemicals and environmental services company, said it
temporarily suspended mill construction at its Ray copper
mine expansion project in Arizona, pending discussions with
state and federal environmental agencies.
   The company said the issue involves the optimum location
of a mine waste-disposal site, part of a $194 million
expansion at the 4,500-acre Ray mine in Hayden, Ariz.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Asarco said the mill construction is ahead of schedule.
The expansion, which is to be completed in early 1992, will
increase production capacity to 182,000 tons of copper a year
from 115,000 tons.</p>
