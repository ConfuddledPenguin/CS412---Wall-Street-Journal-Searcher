	<p class="article-leader">HealthVest,an ailing real estate investment trust, said it
had completed the previously announced transfer of the
operating lease on Eastwood Medical Center in Memphis, Tenn.,
to Regent Health Group Inc., a closely held
hospital-management company. HealthVest said the new 10-year
lease provides for minimum annual rental payments to the
trust of about $4.8 million and for additional rent on a
formula basis. The agreement also provides for deferral of
the first three months' rental, the company said.
   Healthvest, based in Austin, Texas, said Healthcare
International Inc., the hospital management concern that
leases many of its properties, will remain obligated to
HealthVest for the difference between the annual base rent
owned on Eastwood Medical Center through the termination of
its original lease in February 1992 and the rent paid by
Regent under the new lease. HealthVest estimated that amount
at about $2.8 million a year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the six months, HealthVest reported a net loss of $6.8
million, or 64 cents a share, on revenue of $16 million, down
from net income of $10.9 million, or 96 cents a share, on
revenue of $29.4 million in the year-earlier period.</p>
