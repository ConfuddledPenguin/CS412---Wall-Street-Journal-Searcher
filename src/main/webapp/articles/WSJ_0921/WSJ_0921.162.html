	<p class="article-leader">Ogden Corp. ended speculation that it might split into two
public companies, and said it intends to retain its 85%
holding in Ogden Projects Inc., its waste-to-energy unit.
   Odgen, based in New York, also announced a major
reshuffling of the Ogden Projects board, replacing five of
its eight members and adding three others.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier this year, Ogden had been discussing the possible
creation of Ogden Projects as a separate entity.</p>
<p>Ogden Projects, which went public in 1989, has been
growing rapidly as it brings on line large waste-to-energy
plants operating long-term contracts; at the end of 1989, it
had 13 plants in operation, 7 under construction, and 6
awaiting license.</p>
<p>Ogden's other major activity is a broad array of service
business which generated $1 billion of revenue in 1989,
ranging from asbestos abatement, managing arenas and
convention centers, and operating commercial aviation
facilities to managing industrial and building locations and
providing building maintenance services.</p>
<p>For the six months, Ogden Projects had net income of $15.9
million, or 45 cents a share, on revenue of $189 million.</p>
