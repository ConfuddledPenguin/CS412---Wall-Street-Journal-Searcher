	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Healthco International Inc., ending a four-month
battle with dissident shareholder Gemini Partners L.P.,
agreed to give Gemini three seats on a new seven member
Healthco board.
   Gemini, a New York limited partnership with a 9.96% stake
in Healthco, had been soliciting consents from shareholders
to remove Healthco's current board. It said earlier this
month that it had enough consents to do so, though Healthco
disagreed with Gemini's count.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Healthco said it will convene its annual meeting on Sept.
25 and immediately adjourn the meeting to a later date to
allow time to send out revised proxy materials outlining the
terms of the settlement with Gemini.</p>
<p>Healthco, a dental equipment firm, also said it will form
a special committee of major shareholders to review the
progress of its proposed acquisition by Dallas buyout
specialist Hicks, Muse & Co. As reported, Hicks Muse agreed
earlier this month to acquire Healthco for $19.25 a share, or
$250 million.</p>
<p>Prior to reaching the settlement with Healthco, Gemini had
criticized the $19.25-a-share price as "ludicrously" low and
said that if its slate was elected it would work to get a
better price for Healthco.</p>
<p>In a joint statement with Healthco, Gemini executive
general partner Emmanuel R. Pearlman said Gemini "was pleased
to arrive at an amicable resolution with Healthco which we
believe is in the best interests of all Healthco
stockholders." He couldn't be reached for further comment.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Healthco said various suits filed by
Healthco and Gemini in connection with the consent
solicitation will be withdrawn or settled by the two parties.</p>
<p>Commenting on the settlement, Healthco Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Marvin M. Cyker said: "We can now put this
behind us and devote ourselves to the real tasks -- running
Healthco's business for the benefit of all of our various
constituencies and completing as soon as possible our $19.25
cash merger with Hicks Muse."</p>
