	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Agriculture Department analysts, in a break
with the Bush administration's high expectations of choking
off trade with Iraq, are projecting considerable leakage in
the food embargo against the embattled nation.
   The department's World Agricultural Outlook Board
estimates that despite the international embargo, Iraq will
be able to import one million metric tons of wheat and wheat
flour between last July 1 and June 30, 1991, about one-fourth
of what it customarily uses annually. The panel also projects
Iraq will import 350,000 metric tons of rice next year,
almost half of its annual consumption. In addition, the panel
expects Iraqi imports of barley and other coarse grains to
total 400,000 metric tons between Oct. 1 and Sept. 30, 1991.
Typically, Iraq uses about 1.4 million metric tons of barley
a year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, several grain traders and a senior Treasury
official were skeptical of the panel's projections. But
should the estimates prove correct, it suggests the regime of
Saddam Hussein could hold out longer than has been generally
thought.</p>
<p>The panel's forecast assumes that much of the food will be
smuggled into Iraq by truck, ship, even camel caravan, and
that some will be provided openly by famine-relief
organizations under United Nations auspices.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of traders in the Mideast who really
don't have any flag," said Gerald Rector, chairman of the
outlook board's feed grains and wheat committee. "They will
take a commodity wherever they can get the best price."</p>
<p>The board's surprising forecast represents the first
disquieting government assessment of the prospects for
embargo-busting since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and
the swift imposition of U.N. sanctions against Baghdad.
Administration officials have repeatedly extolled the
cooperation of other nations in honoring and enforcing the
sanctions, and they have cited Iraqi bread lines and
shortages of sugar, cooking oil and other commodities as
proof that the embargo is beginning to bite.</p>
<p>In an interview yesterday, Deputy Treasury Secretary John
Robson described the international sanctions as "an amazingly
tight net," and dismissed the possibility of imports'
slipping through in any appreciable volume.</p>
<p>"I don't think you're going to have an absolutely
air-tight embargo," he said, "but I'm not going to sit around
and worry about a truckload of tomatoes getting in."</p>
<p>The outlook board members are analysts with the Foreign
Agricultural Service and Economic Research Service, who tap
the expertise of U.S. officials outside the Agriculture
Department in making projections of world agricultural trade.</p>
<p>The board expects Iraq to devote part of its diminishing
foreign exchange to rice purchases. In its Sept. 12 report,
the panel projects Iraqi rice imports for 1991 at 350,000
tons, just 100,000 tons less than what was imported this year
before sanctions were imposed.</p>
<p>"Rice should be the primary commodity they try to bring
in," said Mr. Rector. "Typically, it's traded in bag form.
You can put it on a camel or a boat and bring it in."</p>
<p>As for the one-million-metric-ton forecast for wheat and
wheat flour, an estimated 300,000 tons were imported before
Iraq was embargoed, he said. The panel assumes that the
current glut of wheat on the world market will help Iraqi
efforts to obtain through middlemen an additional 700,000
tons.</p>
<p>"If you've got a lot of wheat looking for a home," said
Mr. Rector, "it makes it more likely that you have people
willing to buy it and get it across the {Iraqi} border."</p>
<p>The board expects nations such as Libya and Yemen to help
Iraq by serving as transshipment points for food purchased
elsewhere, Mr. Rector said. In addition, leakage is expected
across the Jordanian, Turkish and Iranian borders. The
shipments would take roundabout routes, he added. One
possibility foreseen: Persian Gulf traders would ferry grain
by boat into Iran, and Iranian truckers would take it across
the border.</p>
<p>"Iran and Iraq traded across the border even when they
were fighting" in their eight-year war that ended in 1988, he
said.</p>
<p>If the Iraqis import as much food as the analysts
forecast, the odds of their holding out until next year's
harvests would be improved considerably. Last month, an
Agriculture Department report estimated that Iraq already had
enough wheat, rice, barley and other coarse grains to last
four to six months.</p>
<p>Several grain-trade experts expressed doubts about the
willingness of any nation to engage in embargo-busting in the
face of overwhelming world support for the sanctions. "I
can't imagine what country would load {grain}," said Bernard
Steinweg, a Continental Grain Co. executive. "That would be a
ridiculous risk."</p>
<p>Furthermore, grain traders for multinational agribusiness
companies would detect any big shipments, said a Cargill Inc.
spokesman, who added that the entire market acts as an
"intelligence network."</p>
<p>Some Agriculture Department officials are also skeptical
about the potential for leakage. "Shiploads of grain are easy
to see," said one official. "Truckloads going across the
border may be happening, but they won't make a big dent {in
the embargo}.</p>
