	<p class="article-leader">MGM/UA Communications Co. said it received checks totaling
$50 million from Pathe Communications Corp., bringing to $353
million the amount Pathe has paid in cash toward its proposed
$1.3 billion acquisition of MGM/UA.
   The payment is the last in a series of good-faith interim
payments required under the companies' merger agreement.
Pathe, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., has also given MGM/UA
a $75 million security interest in three films slated by
Pathe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The merger pact calls for MGM/UA shareholders to receive a
total of $21.50 a share, including a $4-a-share payment
distributed on July 20. Payment of the remaining $17.50 a
share and closing of the merger is set to occur by Oct. 23.</p>
<p>MGM/UA holders will meet to vote on the merger Oct. 2. The
polling is a formality because Kirk Kerkorian, who controls
about 80% of MGM/UA's shares, already agreed to vote in favor
of the merger.</p>
<p>MGM/UA rose 25 cents to $14 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading.</p>
