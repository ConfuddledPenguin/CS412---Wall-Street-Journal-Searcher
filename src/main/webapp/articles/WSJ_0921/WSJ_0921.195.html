	<p class="article-leader">Lake Zurich, Ill. -- In 1992, when he is 36 years old,
Kurt Thomas hopes to be in Barcelona, Spain, as a member of a
U.S. Olympic team. That wouldn't raise eyebrows if he were a
yachtsman, shooter or equestrian. But he's a gymnast who last
competed in 1980.
   To the obvious question -- "Why?" -- Thomas flips back a
"Why not?"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I'm doing it because I can, physically, and because I'm a
spotlight kind of guy," chirps the sport's ex-prince. "Think
of it: A comeback in my sport, at my age, would be
phenomenal] I mean, I wish George Foreman {the 42-year-old
heavyweight boxer} all the luck in the world, but what he's
doing is a walk in the park compared with me."</p>
<p>So Thomas doesn't lack for bravado, which is fortunate
because something has to keep him going through the 7
1/2-hour daily workouts he has subjected himself to here for
the past nine months.</p>
<p>And when that flags, there is the memory of past
accomplishments, which were substantial. In 1978, as a 22
year old, the springy blond young man captured the floor
exercises segment of the World Championships in Strasbourg,
France, becoming the first American gymnastics gold medalist
at that level in 46 years. A year later, at the next World's
in Fort Worth, Texas, he won two gold medals and three
silvers, including one in the all-around, to establish
himself as a favorite for the 1980 Olympics in Moscow.</p>
<p>Better yet, Thomas had a gymnastics move named for him, an
honor that has evaded Olympic champions. It's the "Thomas
Flair," a high-swinging maneuver that he devised for the
pommel horse. It's kind of like a botanist putting his name
on a new fern.</p>
<p>But when President Carter yanked the Yanks out of the
Moscow Games, this "spotlight kind of guy" responded to the
need to earn a living by hitting the road in search of
spotlights. He started a show called "Kurt Thomas Gymnastics
America," a gymnastics version of the Ice Capades. Until this
year, he and his touring troupe offered up wholesome
entertainment at conventions, amusement parks, state fairs
and football and basketball halftimes.</p>
<p>He also starred in what might have been the first -- and
could be the last -- movie with a gymnastics theme. Called
"Gymkata," it was filmed in Yugoslavia in 1985, and enjoyed a
moderately successful run in both the U.S. and Europe. "It
wasn't all gymnastics -- there was some karate in it, too,"
Thomas notes, without elaboration. Of his own performance, he
says, "I was pretty good considering I'd never had an acting
lesson."</p>
<p>But a life upon the boards did not prove wholly
fulfilling, and when Thomas visited the 1988 Olympics in
Seoul, Korea, as a TV commentator, the idea of a comeback
occurred. It gained force the next summer at the U.S.
Gymnastics Championships. "Without putting anybody down, I
thought I could do better than what I saw," he says of the
latter event.</p>
<p>He continues: "I suppose the natural time for me to have
come back was for the 1984 Games, but I was too busy with the
show then. It was rough for me to watch the U.S. men
--younger guys I'd seen come up -- win the team gold medal. I
was sorry I wasn't there with them, but then I thought that,
in a way, I was, because I'd helped put U.S. gymnastics on
the map.</p>
<p>"I figured I was too old to try it for '88 until I got
there, and by that time it was too late. It's funny: I was
too old for '88, but just right for '92."</p>
<p>Thomas checked out his status last fall with the U.S.
Gymnastics Federation, the national governing body for the
sport, and learned, with some bemusement, that he wasn't
considered a professional under the much-relaxed Olympic
standards now in force. ("If I'm not a pro, who is?" he
wonders aloud.) Then he checked in for training at the U.S.
Gymnastics Training Center, a private facility in this suburb
of Chicago that's co-owned by Lee Battaglia, his teammate and
roommate at Indiana State University. Despite his show-biz
tumbling, the 5-foot-7 Thomas weighed 168 pounds, some 40
over his competitive weight.</p>
<p>The pounds came off and strength returned, but not without
cost: The renewal of strenuous workouts after the long layoff
awakened a dormant shoulder injury. Thomas had planned to
compete in the 1990 Nationals last June, but arthroscopic
surgery on the joint in May intervened. He asserts that the
shoulder, and the rest of him, are fine now. "I've got a
young body," he smiles. "I'm just starting to get hair on my
chest."</p>
<p>His new schedule has him making his competitive debut Nov.
16 and 17 in a regional meet in Madison, Wis. If his scores
are among the top 24 in a number of such regionals scheduled
for those days, he'll qualify for the Winter Nationals two
weeks later. A top-12 finish there would give him a spot on
the U.S. national team and eligibility for international
events.</p>
<p>His initial goals, he says, are modest. "I'd settle for a
24th at Madison and a 12th in the Winter Nationals. I'm
shooting for a medal in '92, not '90."</p>
<p>One person who thinks Thomas will get what he's come for
is coach Battaglia, whose other pupils have included Chris
Waller, the all-around runner-up in the 1990 Nationals. "No
one has ever done what Kurt is trying, but there's no one
like Kurt," Battaglia declares. "He's the most disciplined
athlete I've ever been around, and the hardest worker. When
he makes up his mind to do something, he succeeds."</p>
<p>Others feel differently, but their views only serve as
grist for Thomas's motivational mill. Without being asked, he
pulls out his key ring, to which he has attached a
plastic-encased newspaper clipping in which former rival
Nikolai Andrianov of the U.S.S.R., a 1980 Olympic medalist,
is quoted as calling Thomas's comeback attempt "ridiculous."</p>
<p>Says Thomas: "I hope Nikolai is in Barcelona to watch me.
If he's not, maybe I'll give him a call after I've won."</p>
