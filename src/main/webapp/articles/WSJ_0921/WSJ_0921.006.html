	<p class="article-leader">EASTERN EUROPE has found democracy on its own, but it will
have plenty of help in discovering capitalism.
   A new survey shows that one-third of corporate chief
executive officers in the U.S., Asia and Western Europe plan
to build or buy factories in Eastern Europe over the next
five years. The CEOs' bullish investment plans reflect a
belief that political liberalization in Eastern Europe is
paving the way toward eventual profits for foreign investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier this year, for example, General Electric Co. of
Stamford, Conn., paid $150 million to buy a majority interest
in Tungsram Co., a Hungarian lighting company. GE Chairman
Jack Welch said when the investment was announced that he was
making a "substantial bet" that moving into Hungary would pay
off.</p>
<p>But while international executives are optimistic, they
are also wary. They display, for instance, little of the
giddy optimism that abounded five to 10 years ago when China
appeared to be undergoing a similar opening to foreign trade.
The reasons for the current caution? Executives cite concerns
about Eastern Europe's bureaucracy, its political instability
and its restrictions on foreign companies' ability to extract
hard currency.</p>
<p>Those are some of the preliminary findings that emerge
from a poll of chief executive officers in the U.S., Europe,
Japan and Pacific Rim nations. The survey was conducted
jointly by The Wall Street Journal, the management consulting
firm of Booz-Allen & Hamilton Inc., and Nihon Keizai Shimbun,
Japan's leading business newspaper.</p>
<p>Some 158 responses were tabulated at press time;
subsequent calculations may slightly alter some of the exact
percentage responses but won't change broad trends.</p>
<p>"Executives see opportunities in Eastern Europe because of
the large consumer market and the educated labor force,"
explains Joseph Nemec, a senior vice president at Booz-Allen.
Most of that interest is concentrated among manufacturing
companies, Mr. Nemec observes; service and financial
companies aren't yet convinced that Eastern Europe's business
climate is suitable.</p>
<p>The survey shows that interest in Eastern Europe has
picked up decisively, compared with a similar 1989 survey of
chief executives. Last year, a mere 5% of executives said
they planned to make capital investments in either Eastern
Europe or the Soviet Union in the next five years. This year,
34% of executives say they intend to make Eastern Europe part
of their capital-investment mix by 1995. Meanwhile, 13% of
executives say the U.S.S.R. will be part of their investment
mix by 1995.</p>
<p>Don't expect foreign companies to start making toothpaste
in Tirana or sofas in Sofia, though. The capital cities of
Albania and Bulgaria -- in fact, those entire nations --
aren't likely to see much foreign investment.</p>
<p>Instead, U.S., Asian and West European chief executives
cite a narrowly drawn list of East European countries that
appeal to them. No. 1 on the list is East Germany, soon to
become part of a unified Germany. Of executives planning East
European investment, 87% plan to do so in what is currently
East Germany. Next on their list is Hungary, cited by 68%,
followed by Poland, at 55%, and Czechoslovakia, at 47%.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia, Romania and Bulgaria appeal to only a few
hardy (or naive) chief executives. And absolutely none of the
executives surveyed say they plan to invest in Albania.
That's little wonder: Albania is the only East European
nation to have largely withstood the wave of political
liberalization sweeping through the region. It also has the
least developed local economy.</p>
<p>The most optimistic outlook toward Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union comes from Japanese executives. Only 3% of
Japanese executives, for instance, see serious trouble
financing any East European or Soviet expansion. In contrast,
36% of U.S. executives and 27% of West European executives
identified financing as a major barrier to entering those
markets.</p>
<p>Similarly, just 30% of Japanese executives identified East
European government regulations as a major impediment to
doing business in the region. That compares with 42% for both
U.S. and West European executives.</p>
<p>Still, Japan isn't exactly putting its money where its
mouth is. Eastern Europe accounts for just 0.7% of Japanese
companies' world-wide capital-spending plans by 1995. That
compares with 1.8% of U.S. companies' overall spending plans
and 4.6% of Western European companies' spending plans.</p>
<p>The predominant areas for capital investment world-wide
remain the U.S. and Canada, which get a 36% share, Western
Europe, at 21%, and Japan, at 18%.</p>
<p>Although few executives plan to do much investing in the
U.S.S.R, they have plenty of opinions about the Soviet Union.
A remarkable 96% say they like Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, though nearly one-third of executives have some
doubts that he can keep his position until 1995.</p>
<p>Some 86% of respondents think there will be sustained
economic liberalization in the Soviet Union in the next five
years. Most of them, however, seem to believe that the Soviet
economy is too backward to register much global clout in the
next five years. Only 19% of respondents think it's likely
that the U.S.S.R. will become a major economic power.</p>
