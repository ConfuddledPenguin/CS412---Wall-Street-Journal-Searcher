	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Frank Darden got his first computer at the age
of 16, a Christmas present from his parents. Sitting on a
desk in his bedroom, it opened a window on a world he found
so consuming that he quit high school and spent most days and
nights at the keyboard.
   His parents often wondered what their son found so
compelling in the endless hours he spent alone in his room.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Then one afternoon last summer, a dozen Secret Service
agents burst into the family's suburban home. Agents held
Edward and</p>
<p>Lou Darden at gunpoint as they swarmed into their son's
room, seizing scores of disks, armloads of files and three
computers.</p>
<p>When Frank got home an hour later, the terrified young man
confessed that he had used his home computer to break into</p>
<p>BellSouth Corp.'s telephone network. In February, Mr.
Darden and two others were indicted on felony charges of
conspiracy and wire fraud.</p>
<p>"I guess now my parents know what I was doing in my room,"
says a remorseful Mr. Darden, a bright, impatient 24-year-old
with shoulder-length hair and a tiedyed T-shirt.</p>
<p>Mr. Darden thus became another of the growing number of
"hackers" nabbed by federal agents. For a long time, these
high-tech trespassers operated in relative obscurity, using
their computers and phone lines to go where few people were
meant to go. But lately, in a string of highly publicized
cases, hacking has moved toward the forefront of white-collar
crime. Increasingly, banks, businesses, credit bureaus and
telephone companies are discovering that someone, often in
the dead of night, has wandered into their computer systems
-- and left his mark.</p>
<p>As Mr. Darden's experience reveals, hacking has developed
its own subculture, rich with literature and legend and
peopled by electronic vandals, voyeurs and explorers known by
fanciful code names. "Any business that has a computer hooked
to a phone is vulnerable," warns Mr. Darden, who called
himself the "The Leftist." Before the bust, he was one of the
best.</p>
<p>Mr. Darden's case is part of a broad federal crackdown on
*  computer hackers that has led to more than 30 raids in
cities across the country. In the most recent sweep, 13
people were arrested in New York last week, including a
14-year-old suspected of breaking into a computer used by the
Secretary of the Air Force.</p>
<p>An early target in the crackdown was the Legion of Doom,
an elite clique of hackers that included Mr. Darden and was
targeted by the Secret Service because of its members'
notable skills. "The Legion of Doom had the power to
jeopardize the entire phone network," says Kent B. Alexander,
an assistant U.S. attorney prosecuting Mr. Darden's case in
Atlanta.</p>
<p>In a Secret Service affidavit filed in U.S. District Court
in Atlanta, BellSouth investigators call the Legion of Doom
"a severe threat to U.S. financial and telecommunications
industries." Federal agents suspect the Legion was
responsible for software "time bombs" -- destructive programs
designed to shut down major switching hubs -- planted in
telephone company computers in Denver, Atlanta and New Jersey
last year. The programs were defused before causing damage,
investigators say, but the intrusions, which weren't
disclosed by the phone companies, could have knocked out
service to hundreds of thousands of customer phone lines.</p>
<p>The government sweep so far has bagged a motley band,
mostly loners and young rebels in their teens or early
twenties. In past cases, many of the hackers who have
admitted breaking into computers have insisted that they
didn't damage the systems they penetrated. They did it for
sport.</p>
<p>"There's no thrill quite the same as getting into your
first system," says Phrack, an electronic magazine run out of
a University of Missouri dorm and accessed by computer.
Before it was shut down in the latest sweep, Phrack (for
phone-freak hacking) published tips on cracking computer
security. One issue offers a "hacker's code of ethics," which
advises, "Do not intentionally damage any system" or alter
any files "other than ones you need to ensure your escape."
Another rule: "Don't be afraid to be paranoid. Remember, you
are breaking the law." Mr. Darden says he strictly adhered to
the code.</p>
<p>But the hackers' creed means nothing in court. There,
hacking is treated much like any other form of criminal
trespass under a law Congress passed in 1988. The law
persuaded many hackers to end their illicit forays. But it
turned other hobbyists into criminals.</p>
<p>During his hacker days, Mr. Darden's world was an oddly
solitary one. For hours on end he sat in front of the
computer screen, finding his only human contact in the words
*  and arcane code that arrived via computer from other
hackers. "Once he got into a subject, there was no stopping,"
recalls his mother. "He was always studying up on something.
He read encyclopedias as a pastime."</p>
<p>Geography was meaningless; friends from around the world
were just a few keystrokes away, thanks to modems that
connect computers through phone lines. Mr. Darden says he has
struck up many lasting friendships on-line with people he has
never met in person.</p>
<p>In this silent, cerebral world, age is also irrelevant.
Only computer skills count. Once on-line, a hacker can be
anyone he or she wants to be. "No one knows if you're fat,
pimply, or scared to talk to girls," says Sheldon Zenner, a
Chicago attorney who recently defended an editor of Phrack on
felony wire-fraud charges. "Suddenly you're no longer just
the shy adolescent, but Knight Lightning or The Prophet."</p>
<p>"It's a compulsion for some of these people," adds Mr.
Alexander, the Atlanta prosecutor. "I'm convinced that if
Lotus 1-2-3 was behind Door No. 1, and Cheryl Tiegs was
standing behind Door No. 2, a hacker would go for the
software."</p>
<p>Mr. Darden recounts his hacking days with disapproval --
and just a touch of pride. He broke into his first system at
the age of 17, dialing his way into a big computer at Hayes
Microcomputer Products Inc., in Norcross, Ga., and nosing
around the system. "I didn't take anything, I was just trying
to see if it could be done," he says now. Hayes uncovered the
breach and quickly tightened security, he says.</p>
<p>Hacking sessions often stretched into the early morning
hours. He would start by checking lists of computer phone
numbers collected by his computer the night before through an
automatic process called "war dialing." That's the brute
force approach to hacking, when the computer runs through the
night, methodically dialing every number in a telephone
exchange. It records the number whenever it hits a "carrier
tone" signaling a computer is on the other end.</p>
<p>In a typical night of war dialing, in which the computer
might check thousands of numbers, perhaps 100 computer
carrier tones would be unearthed, "each one a potential
treasure chest," Mr. Darden says. He would then begin calling
down the "hit list" with his computer, each time trying to
determine what kind of system was on the other end. Fax
machines were a problem, because they emit a tone that sounds
like a computer, so he wrote software that ignored them.</p>
<p>Each kind of computer had a distinctive response to his
call, so he would tailor his approach to the type of system
he encountered. Computers that used the Unix software
operating system were especially easy to break into, while
Digital Equipment Corp.'s VAX computers, which have multiple
levels of security, presented a bigger challenge. But he says
he was fond of the VAX because of its widely used software.
"For a hacker, the VAX is like putting on an old Jimi Hendrix
record in a bar -- it's a real classic." Using purloined
telephone credit-card numbers, which his computer generated
through trial and error, he got into computers all over the
world, including an encounter with a VAX that spoke Finnish.</p>
<p>He devised password-cracking programs that automated the
hacking process. He also devised a program that let him
capture legitimate users' passwords as they logged onto the
system. When he found a password the target computer
recognized, his screen would typically respond with a prompt,
such as a sign. "Once you get that, you've got an open door,"
he says. Often he would play "cat-and-mouse games" with a
company's computer operators. "I'd send a little greeting to
their printer, to let them know I was there. It drove them
crazy."</p>
<p>Credit bureaus were a favorite target. And, despite the
warnings of other hackers that it might give him away, his
first move was to look up his own credit report. "Naturally,
I didn't have one," he says. He found his parents' report,
and looked up others for friends.</p>
<p>To make the process more efficient, and show off, Mr.
Darden and other hackers traded phone numbers and
system-cracking tips on pirate "bulletin boards" -- computer
systems that store and forward text and electronic mail over
phone lines. "Black Ice" was one such board. Access was
tightly limited to an elite circle.</p>
<p>Mr. Darden's biggest thrill as a hacker -- and ultimately
his downfall -- came when he broke into a big BellSouth
computer in Atlanta used by technicians to maintain and
control the phone system. He learned how to navigate within
the system by asking questions of BellSouth's own online
"help" program. Once inside, he found he had the ability to
reroute telephone calls or bring down switching centers,
neither of which he says he did. Mr. Darden did, however,
listen in on a few phone lines, but only those of other
hackers, he insists, and only to prove his prowess.</p>
<p>"If we'd wanted to, we could have knocked out service
across the Southeastern U.S.," he says. "The fact that I
could get into the system amazed me. But we were careful not
to damage anything."</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, when BellSouth discovered hackers were
rummaging through its computer, it reacted swiftly. It put 42
investigators on the task of tracking the intruders down, and
spent $1.5 million on the effort. Once it found the source of
the intrusions, it called in the Secret Service, which
enforces computer-crime laws.</p>
<p>In the indictment, Mr. Darden and two co-defendants,
Robert J. Riggs, 21, a.k.a. The Prophet, and Adam E. Grant,
22, a.k.a. The Urvile, were charged with taking copies of
proprietary software from BellSouth during their ramblings in
the system, and with unauthorized intrusion, possessing
illegal phone credit-card numbers with intent to defraud, and
conspiracy. Messrs. Darden and Riggs pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and face a maximum of five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine. Mr. Grant pleaded guilty to possessing
BellSouth computer access codes with the intent to defraud
and faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000
fine. Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 14. The only good
thing to come out of the whole experience,</p>
<p>Mr. Darden muses, is that after he was indicted, his
high-school sweetheart -- whom he often spurned in favor of
his computer -- saw his picture on the front page of the
local paper and got back in touch. Mr. Darden, who now works
installing systems for a local computer company, views
himself as a purist, hacking for the thrill of exploring the
forbidden. He looks down on those who use their skills simply
to steal phone and credit-card numbers. But in this game,
information is everything, and not even Mr. Darden can
control its spread. During their sweep, federal agents have
found some hackers using code-cracking information dug up by
the Legion of Doom to perpetrate their own practical jokes
and fraud.</p>
<p>For a few days last year, for example, phone calls to the
Delray Beach, Fla., probation office were mysteriously
rerouted to a dial-a-porn line in New York. Secret Service
agents say it's the kind of thing the Legion might have done.</p>
<p>And in Elwood, Ind., a 15-year-old calling himself Fry Guy
allegedly used information he got from the Legion to carry
out an elaborate fraud. Secret Service agents say he used his
computer to break into a credit rating service in Maryland to
pilfer VISA and MasterCard credit information. He then
entered BellSouth's control network and altered a pay phone
on a street corner in nearby Paducah, Ky., to residential
status. Next, he called Western Union and had cash wired out
of credit-card accounts to the Paducah Western Union office.
When Western Union called the credit-card holders to verify
the transactions, the calls were forwarded to the pay phone
and then to the youth's home phone, where he posed as the
credit-card holders and gave approval. The cash was then
picked up at the Western Union window, investigators say.</p>
<p>In all, Fry Guy siphoned more than $10,000 in cash and
purchases from credit-card accounts, alleges William M.
Gleason, the Secret Service investigator. He also found
evidence that Fry Guy, whose name hasn't been released,
hacked his way into a payroll computer for a local McDonald's
Corp. outlet, giving pay raises to his friends working at the
restaurant.</p>
<p>Fry Guy's case is being handled by state juvenile
authorities and, because of his age, it is unclear what
punishment he might get. At the very least, his parents are
likely to watch the family phone bill more closely. In a
recent meeting with federal prosecutors, Fry Guy's
exasperated father wore a baseball cap bearing the legend
"Kids: They'll drive you crazy."</p>
<p>Federal agents admit that, when they detect an intruder
inside a computer, there isn't any way of telling if it's a
precocious teen-ager or a crook out to commit fraud. So they
simply execute the law.</p>
<p>"When a hacker gets into a system, it's no different from
a burglar breaking into your home or office," says Secret
Service agent James Cool. If the door is open, the law treats
a trespasser differently, he adds. But if a hacker cracks a
password to get into a system, "it's the same as kicking in a
locked door -- and we're going to come after them."</p>
<p>Ed Darden wishes he had known all of this before he gave
his son that Apple II for Christmas eight years ago. "I'd
have thought twice about it," he says. "Maybe we should have
given him a bicycle."</p>

<p>AN ARTICLE on computer hackers on Aug. 22 mentioned
computer bulletin boards, including one called Black Ice. The
one referred to, which federal law enforcement officials say
had been operating in Richmond, Va., isn't connected with a
computer bulletin board system in Austin, Texas, that also is
named Black Ice.</p>
