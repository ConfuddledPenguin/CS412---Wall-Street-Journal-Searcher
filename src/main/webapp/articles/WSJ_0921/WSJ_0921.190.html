	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Troubles at Polly Peck International PLC neared
a climax as the company's stock price plunged 55% on a flurry
of rumors and the company announced plans for a special board
meeting today.
   The company didn't offer any explanation for the price
crash, and a spokesman declined to comment on a spate of
unsubstantiated market rumors that ranged from debt-payment
problems to the imminent resignation of Asil Nadir, the
company's chairman and chief executive.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Following a halt in trading of the stock on the London
Stock Exchange yesterday, Polly Peck said it had requested
the suspension "in view of the effect of the numerous current
rumors on the share price." It didn't elaborate. Before the
2:21 p.m. suspension, Polly Peck shares dove by 135 pence, to
108 pence ($2.04). Trading volume was heavy, at 36 million
shares.</p>
<p>The stock collapse came as Britain's Serious Fraud Office
confirmed that police searched the London offices of South
Audley Management Ltd. on Wednesday. South Audley manages
property and investments for Nadir family members and family
trusts, according to a Polly Peck spokesman. The fraud office
didn't disclose the purpose of the search, but numerous
London newspapers reported that British authorities are
investigating trading by present or former South Audley
associates in Polly Peck shares. The Polly Peck spokesman
said South Audley "has nothing to do with" Polly Peck itself.</p>
<p>On Aug. 12, Mr. Nadir told a special Polly Peck board
meeting that he was considering taking the company private.
Mr. Nadir changed his mind just five days later, claiming
that some shareholders had protested to him about his plan.
Since then, following repeated news reports of the government
probe, the company's stock has been sinking.</p>
<p>The London exchange, meanwhile, passed on to the
Department of Trade and Industry a report it had compiled on
the August events. In it, the exchange criticized Mr. Nadir
for inadequately preparing his original bid plans.</p>
<p>Mr. Nadir, a Turkish Cypriot, through the 1980s built the
former British textiles company into a mini-conglomerate,
with its biggest investments in fruit trading and
electronics. Polly Peck bought the tropical-fruit business of
RJR Nabisco Inc.'s Del Monte unit and acquired control of
Japan's troubled Sansui Electric Co.</p>
<p>Early in the 1980s, the company's stock price had soared
-- only to collapse as its earnings growth faltered.</p>
