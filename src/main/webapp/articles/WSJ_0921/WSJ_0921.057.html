	<p class="article-leader">ROCHEFORT, Belgium -- Brother Pierre is extolling the
virtues of his monastic life: fulfilling work in the abbey's
small brewery, along with plenty of time for study,
reflection and prayer.
   His hair shaven to a black stubble, the young Trappist
monk peers earnestly at a visitor in a cold stone antechamber
of the Rochefort monastery. "What we seek," he explains, "is
calm." Suddenly, the calm is disturbed by the beeping of an
electronic pager hidden somewhere beneath Brother Pierre's
cassock. "Excuse me a moment," he says, then pads down the
corridor on sandaled feet to confer with a colleague.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For Belgium's Trappist monks, the pressures of the outside
world are never completely absent. The beer they brew to pay
for monastery expenses and charity has become so popular in
recent years that they often can't keep up with demand.</p>
<p>"Our customers are on their knees before us," says Brother
Pierre, who quickly adds that this is "just a manner of
speaking." Like the four other Trappist monasteries that
produce beer in Belgium, Rochefort's abbey sometimes has to
ration its supply among its most loyal customers.</p>
<p>The beer is scarce partly because there is a shortage of
monks to brew it. As in other wealthy Western countries,
Trappists here find that fewer and fewer young men want to
adopt the austere monastic life. The average age of Trappist
monks in Belgium is well over 60; the Rochefort abbey hasn't
had a new recruit since 1982.</p>
<p>Thus, only a few monks are available for brewing at most
of the abbeys. At the Orval monastery, for instance, only one
of the 35 monks, Father Bruno, works in the brewery. Wearing
a blue lab coat, he supervises 26 outside workers in a
business with annual sales equivalent to about $4 million.</p>
<p>"To work eight hours a day is difficult for a monk,"
Father Bruno says softly. "They have other things to do."
Some bake bread; others make cheese. A few are too old to do
much work of any kind. Even so, Father Bruno reasons that the
monastery can continue to claim its beer is "brewed by
Trappist monks" as long as they control the finances, quality
and promotion.</p>
<p>Apart from a few crucifixes here and there, Orval doesn't
look much different from any other small brewery. Nor does
the sight of Father Bruno tapping away on his personal
computer exactly evoke the medieval imagery associated with
Trappist beer. The brewery's switchboard plays "Home on the
Range" for callers put on hold.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, partly because the product is viewed as
authentic and traditional, the Trappist brewers' sales last
year grew to about 290,000 hectoliters, up about 14% from
1985. Their share of the Belgian beer market grew to 2.2% of
total volume from 1.8% five years ago -- despite competition
from secular imitators. By value, the Trappists' share is
much bigger, since their beer is among the most expensive.</p>
<p>The Trappist beers are strong -- up to 12% alcohol -- and
full-bodied. Some are slightly sweet. All are "refermented"
in the bottle and based on traditional recipes. None
resembles a standard Pilsener beer.</p>
<p>Though most of the Trappist beer is drunk in Belgium, a
growing share is exported, mainly to France and the
Netherlands but also to the U.S. and other faraway markets.</p>
<p>The biggest exporter among the Trappists is Chimay, whose
business has outgrown the monastery. The beer is still made
within the stone walls, but the bottling plant and a cheese
factory have moved to a nearby industrial zone. With cash to
spare, the monastery has even invested some of its profits in
the local dairy and packaging industries.</p>
<p>Monks as venture capitalists? "You can forget your
capitalistic comparisons," snaps Philippe Macq, a brisk,
secular businessman who runs Chimay's commercial side,
shuttling between the abbey and the industrial zone in a car
equipped with a mobile telephone. "Money doesn't interest
them," he says. "They are rich, but they live like the poor."</p>
<p>Even so, the monks of Chimay invested in expanded brewing
capacity last year, and Mr. Macq hopes they will agree to
another modest increase this year.</p>
<p>The other monasteries seem less ambitious about expansion.
Brother Pierre of Rochefort says his abbey has "practiced
auto-limitation" since the 1950s. The monks don't want their
monastery overshadowed by a huge industrial plant.</p>
<p>At the Westmalle monastery's brewery, almost hidden amid
cow pastures near Antwerp, Brother Thomas says he figures
production would have to double to meet demand. "On
principle," he adds, "we say no."</p>
<p>The smallest Trappist brewery, St. Sixtus, finally retired
its wooden casks this year and installed $1.5 million of
gleaming, automated equipment. For the moment, however, St.
Sixtus is limited to selling only a trickle of its dark,
sweet beer because of an agreement made just after World War
II by "a brother who wasn't very clever," as one Belgian
brewing executive puts it. The agreement gives a neighboring
brewery, Sint Bernardus, a near monopoly on use of the St.
Sixtus brand name, in exchange for royalties totaling about
$150 a year.</p>
<p>If the monks find this a pittance, they are not letting
on. However, Brother Paul of St. Sixtus notes that the monks
will be free to sell all the beer they want once the
agreement expires in 1992. He is coy about whether they will
take advantage of it.</p>
<p>"We brew to live," Brother Paul says serenely. "We don't
live to brew."</p>
<p>At all of the abbeys, monks recoil at any suggestion that
they are sophisticated businessmen. Still, whether by design
or accident, their strategy seems to be working.</p>
<p>For one thing, they have avoided flooding the market, thus
preserving rarity value. For another, their distinctive brews
are in tune with today's beer drinkers, who tend to drink
less but demand more novelty. "People are getting sick and
tired of all these beers that taste the same," says Michel
Tassin, a Belgian who imports Chimay into the U.S., where a
750-milliliter bottle, sealed with a champagne-style cork,
sells in stores for as much as $9.50.</p>
<p>The monks also think long term. Westmalle's Brother Thomas
offers a visitor a glass of relatively light beer brewed only
for consumption within the monastery. Should a severe
economic slump ever deter people from paying the equivalent
of $2 or $3 a glass for Westmalle's stronger brands, he
confides, the brewery could quickly roll out the cheaper,
light version.</p>
<p>As usual, success has aroused the competition. Belgium's
two big secular brewers, Interbrew S.A. and Alken-Maes S.A.,
both sell what they call "abbey beers" -- brews produced in
modern plants but using old monastery formulas. The Trappists
take a dim view of such competition. "The consumer is being
fooled a little," says Mr. Macq of Chimay.</p>
<p>Although there is nothing the Trappists can do to stop
abbey beers, they are determined to defend their Trappist
trade name, which is protected under Belgian law. Brother
Thomas of Westmalle, usually mild-mannered, turns gruff when
he recalls a recent British television program that
erroneously identified a secular beer as Trappist. "If this
continues," he huffs, "we'll have to take legal action."</p>
