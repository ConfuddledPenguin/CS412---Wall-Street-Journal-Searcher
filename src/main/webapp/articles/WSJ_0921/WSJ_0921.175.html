	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Reports that some congressional leaders may
seek to postpone automatic spending cuts, which are called
for under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, sent
jitters through the bond market yesterday.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 3/8 point, a
loss of about $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.
Yesterday's decline nearly wiped out Wednesday's rally and
pushed the yield on the benchmark bond back up to 9.03%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bond prices were little changed during early trading but
sank suddenly on news that members of Congress have been
discussing the possibility of delaying across-the-board
spending cuts to give congressional negotiators more time to
work out details of a deficit reduction plan. Unless Congress
comes up with a plan, $85 billion in automatic,
across-the-board spending cuts are scheduled to go into
effect Oct. 1. By Oct. 15, an additional $20 billion could be
cut.</p>
<p>Lawrence Leuzzi, a managing director at S.G. Warburg &
Co., said the reports were a big disappointment to bond
investors, who have been counting on a quick solution to the
nation's big budget deficit problem. Among other benefits, a
smaller deficit would reduce the size of future government
borrowings, which, in turn, could lead to lower interest
rates.</p>
<p>"This could be the first chink in the Gramm-Rudman armor
that could potentially lead to the unraveling of the
legislation," Mr. Leuzzi said. "If they delay Gramm-Rudman a
few weeks for the budget negotiations, then next they may
want to delay it until the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved.
And that would be very negative for the markets."</p>
<p>Relentless increases in oil prices, and reports that
additional price rises could be in store, also hurt bond
prices.</p>
<p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, prices of the October
crude oil futures contract settled at $34.71 a barrel, up
$1.53.</p>
<p>If that wasn't bad enough, the World Bank said yesterday
that world oil prices could skyrocket as high as $65 a barrel
if the Persian Gulf crisis turns into a shooting war.</p>
<p>Sentiment in the bond market is apparently so bearish that
not even plunging stock prices encouraged investors to buy
bonds. This was surprising, considering that the bond market
often benefits from sharp declines in stock prices, as
investors sell stocks and invest the proceeds in Treasury
securities, which are considered ultrasafe.</p>
<p>Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu, said the
bond market had been anticipating some "bond for stocks"
trading, "but that never really materialized." At one point,
the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 50 points, but
ended 39.11 points lower at 2518.32.</p>
<p>Mr. Fabbri said the thin trading conditions may have
overstated yesterday's bond market decline. "If more people
were in the market," he said, "it would have been more
balanced in matching bids with offers." Mr. Fabbri said he
expects trading volume to be light again today, with few
fresh economic developments on which to focus.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury securities ended moderately lower to little
changed in light trading.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
96 30/32, down from 97 9/32 on Wednesday. The issue's yield,
which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to
9.03% from 9%.</p>
<p>Short-term securities were little changed. The price of
two-year notes ended at 100 3/32, to yield 8.05%, unchanged
from Wednesday. Rates on Treasury bills were slightly higher.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at
7.39%, for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.61%, and the rate on
six-month bills was 7.32%, for a bond-equivalent yield of
7.69%.</p>
<p>The Treasury sold $10.5 billion of one-year bills
yesterday at an average yield of 7.25%. That was down from
7.4% at the previous one-year bill auction Aug. 23 and was
the lowest yield since 7.21% at the Jan. 11 auction.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's 52-week bill auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>
<p>                                       52-Week Bills</p>
<p>

<p>The bills are dated Sept. 27, 1990 and mature Sept. 26,
1991.</p>
<p>Junk and Corporate Bonds</p>
<p>Falling stock prices weighed on the junk-bond market,
driving prices moderately lower.</p>
<p>But while prices of most high-yield,
below-investment-grade bonds were 1/2 point lower, the junk
bonds issued by casino operators posted larger declines. The
casino-bond rout was led by Goldriver Finance Corp., which
plunged more than 30 points on news that the company won't
meet interest due Nov. 1 on its 13.875% first mortgage bonds.
The company also said it may not be able to make other
bondholder payments, as well.</p>
<p>That news cast a pall over the entire casino sector, where
issues such as Caesars World and Aztar Mortgage Funding Inc.
registered losses of as much as one point.</p>
<p>Though markets for Goldriver bonds were wide, high-yield
traders quoted the securities at bid prices ranging from 35
to 39, down at least 33 points from Wednesday's closing
levels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Caesars World 13.5% subordinated notes, due in
1997, slipped 1/2 point to 98 and Aztar Mortgage Funding's
13.5% first mortgage bonds, maturing in 1996, fell one point
to 81.</p>
<p>In the high-grade market, bond prices finished unchanged
to 1/8 point lower.</p>
<p>Among new issues, Premark International Inc. offered $100
million of notes, which were priced to yield 10.502%. The
noncallable notes were priced at a spread of 1.6 percentage
points above the Treasury's 10-year note, through
underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Co.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>An unexpected oil price flare-up sent municipals lower
late in the session, with tax-exempt bonds unchanged to off
1/4 point in light dealings.</p>
<p>A World Bank report, which estimates that the price of oil
could rise to $65 a barrel if a shooting war breaks out in
the Persian Gulf, was generally viewed as the impetus for
oil's latest rise. After the report, a municipal trader said,
"The market's down on oil trading."</p>
<p>Trading remained light, as marketwary investors are
continuing to sit on the sidelines, given the lingering
uncertainty about the Middle East. "They're very careful,"
the trader said of investors. "They're involved only if they
have to be."</p>
<p>The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.2% issue due 2018
was 1/8 point lower at 97 to 97 3/8, to yield 7.42%.</p>
<p>In new-issue dealings, a Goldman, Sachs & Co. group set
the preliminary pricing for the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority, New York's $165.9 million transit and commuter
facilities service contract bonds, to yield from 6.4% in 1992
to 8.13% in 2016. Ratings of single-A/triple-B-plus are
expected.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities experienced a session of
lackluster trading, as many market players were absent
because of a religious holiday.</p>
<p>Even though active mortgage issues traded in a tight range
for most of the day, mortgage securities lost ground in
mid-afternoon, prompted by the sharp rise in oil prices.</p>
<p>Mortgage issues gave up nearly 1/4 point when oil prices
shot up. Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie
Mae, 9 1/2% issues for October delivery were off 5/32 at 98
8/32, down 7/32 from the high of 98 15/32. Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, Gold 9 1/2% issues and
Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, 9 1/2%
issues were slightly stronger, down 4/32, at 98 25/32 and 98
18/32, respectively.</p>
<p>In the real estate mortgage investment conduit, or remic,
market, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets announced the details
of Merrill Lynch Trust 47. The $300 million remic is backed
by Ginnie Mae 9% issues and consists of nine classes.</p>
<p>The first two classes are sequential pay classes. A
sequential pay is a series of classes whereby cash flows are
used to retire each class in order of maturity. Of the
remaining seven classes, five are planned amortization
classes, or PACs. A remic is a type of security underwritten
by Wall Street firms that provides a method of dividing up
the income flows from many mortgages into new securities with
various interest rates and maturities, to attract banks,
insurers and other big investors to the home-mortgage market.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Treasury yield spreads were slightly narrower.
Ginnie Mae 9 1/2% issues were yielding 9.91%, assuming a
constant annual prepayment rate of 5.5. The yield
differential was 100 basis points over the 10-year Treasury
note, one basis point narrower than Wednesday. A basis point
is equal to 1/100th of one percentage point.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac Gold 9 1/2% issues were yielding 9.82%, based
on a constant annual prepayment rate of 6.9, and were at 90
basis points over the 10-year Treasury note, three basis
points tighter than Wednesday.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>British government bonds surged in a flight-to-quality
rally that was triggered by falling stock prices.</p>
<p>The price of Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% government bond,
or gilt, was quoted at 100 10/32, up 22/32 from late
Wednesday, to yield 11.69%.</p>
<p>"We started to take off the moment the Footsie started to
plummet, with one or two people looking for a refuge," a
trader said. Footsie is the sobriquet for the Financial
Times-Stock Index of 100 issues. "It's just gone up and up
and up," the trader said. "For every 1/2 point down in the
Footsie, we're putting on a tick or two."</p>
<p>The bond rally began late in the day and provided some
excitement to an otherwise torpid market.</p>
<p>Gilt prices were slightly lower at the opening, because of
continued worries about delays in sterling's entry into the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism, following Wednesday's
comments by the West German Bundesbank, or central bank,
president, Karl Otto Poehl.</p>
<p>In Japan, bankers and dealers warned investors to expect
another increase in Japan's long-term prime rate next week.
Many analysts said the rate could rise to as high as 9%.</p>
<p>But bankers expressed worry that the jump to the
psychologically significant 9% level, while justified by the
costs of funds of banks, would chill demand for their loans.
An official at one of Japan's three long-term credit banks,
which reset the prime rate late each month, said his bank may
try to limit the rise in the long-term prime to below 9%.</p>
<p>The long-term prime rate is a benchmark for pricing many
corporate loans, including subordinated loans being taken by
Japanese banks to raise capital, as well as housing and
personal loans. At 9%, the prime rate would be at its highest
level in eight years.</p>
