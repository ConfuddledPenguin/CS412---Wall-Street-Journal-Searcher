	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The federal Resolution Trust Corp. filed a
lawsuit accusing Saudi European Bank and nine other
defendants of a racketeering scheme that allegedly cheated
Lincoln Savings & Loan Association out of $18 million.
   In the civil suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan,
the agency also asserted that the alleged scheme was carried
out with the secret approval of Charles Keating, the failed
thrift's former owner. The lawsuit alleges that the
defendants won Mr. Keating's cooperation by arranging for
American Continental Corp., Lincoln Savings' parent company,
to receive favorable treatment from Saudi European Bank, a
small merchant bank that was based in Paris and acquired last
year by Maison Bouygues, a unit of Bouygues S.A. of France.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The lawsuit seeks compensatory and special damages of at
least $18 million, which could be tripled to $54 million
under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations, or
RICO, law. The suit seeks additional damages totaling $90
million for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty.</p>
<p>The lawsuit says each of the defendants can be held liable
for the entire amount of damages sought, because they were
alleged co-conspirators in the scheme.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating wasn't named as a defendant in the suit. The
RTC, which was created to sell and merge insolvent thrifts,
already has a $1.1 billion civil racketeering suit pending
against Mr. Keating, who also was indicted on criminal
charges earlier this week.</p>
<p>Regulators have estimated that the collapse of Irvine,
Calif.-based Lincoln Savings could cost taxpayers more than
$2.5 billion. Officials charge that Lincoln Savings was
engaging in many such transactions that benefited American
Continental at the expense of the thrift, which held more
than $4 billion in government-insured deposits. American
Continental filed for bankruptcy-law protection in April
1989.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed yesterday centers on an $18 million
investment Lincoln Savings made in Saudi European Investment
Corp., a Saudi European Bank affiliate, in 1984.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that Lincoln Savings and other
investors were defrauded in a securities offering that was
supposed to raise $60 million to create a publicly traded
U.S. energy company. Instead, the lawsuit claims, the stock
offering was secretly oversubscribed, diluting the value of
the investments, and the financing diverted to benefit
certain shareholders.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that the defendants diverted at least
$40 million from the oversubscribed stock offering. For
example, the lawsuit says, in November 1984 -- immediately
after the offering was supposed to close -- the defendants
fraudulently used some of the funds to buy the U.S. trading
division of Gulf Oil Corp., a unit of Chevron Corp.</p>
<p>"Defendants' transactions for their personal benefit
impaired the financial condition of {Saudi European
Investment Corp.}, thereby lessening the value of the shares
held by the plaintiffs and damaging them," the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>The RTC said in its suit that Mr. Keating's company,
American Continental, first raised questions with Saudi
European Investment Corp. about the diluted investments. To
conceal the alleged scheme, the lawsuit states, Saudi
European Bank arranged a business venture with American
Continental that enabled the company to post a profit for
1987.</p>
<p>Along with Saudi European Bank and its investment
affiliate, the other defendants named in the suit include
Richard A. Fenn of Pawling, N.Y., a Saudi European Bank
official; Jamal Radwan, a Saudi European Investment official
whose address couldn't be determined; Ronald F. Reilly of
Weston, Conn., who allegedly acted as an agent for Messrs.
Fenn and Radwan; ALEF Bank, a management-service company
owned by Saudi European Investment and based in the
Netherlands Antilles; and ALEF Investment Corp. of Paris.</p>
<p>Also named as defendants and charged with assisting in the
scheme are two New York law firms, Gadsby & Hannah and
Townley & Updike, and a Townley Updike attorney, Mario
Diaz-Cruz III of New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Diaz-Cruz and Mr. Reilly each said separately last
night that they were unaware the suit had been filed. None of
the other defendants could be reached for comment last night.</p>
<p>The lawsuit noted that Saudi European Bank was sold to
Maison Bouygues last December and renamed Societe de Banque
Privee S.A. In the lawsuit, the RTC charges that Maison
Bouygues knew of the alleged fraud when it bought the bank
and could be held liable for the allegations against Saudi
European Bank.</p>
