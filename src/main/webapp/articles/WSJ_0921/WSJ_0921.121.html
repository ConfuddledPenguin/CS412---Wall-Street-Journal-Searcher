	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- A Dayton Hudson Corp. foundation, reversing
an earlier decision blasted by abortion-rights advocates,
approved an $18,000 grant to Planned Parenthood.
   Still, Dayton Hudson is being careful not to anger
anti-abortion groups. The big retailer said its money is
going into a "restricted public-education fund" that Planned
Parenthood's Minnesota chapter will add as a "separate line
item subcategory" in its audit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dayton Hudson said, "Our contributions have never been nor
will they be used to finance abortion services. We are
satisfied that we can make this grant without taking a
position on this issue."</p>
<p>Last month, the Dayton Hudson Foundation decided to sever
longtime financial ties to Planned Parenthood in an attempt,
it said, to distance itself from the battle over abortion.
For 22 years, the foundation had given the group money for
education programs designed to prevent teen-age pregnancy.</p>
<p>It isn't known if the reversal will appease women's groups
that announced plans to boycott Dayton Hudson stores during
the Christmas season if the foundation didn't restore
funding.</p>
