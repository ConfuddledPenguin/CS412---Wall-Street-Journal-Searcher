	<p class="article-leader">Cockerill Sambre S.A. said unconsolidated profit for the
first six months of fiscal 1990 rose 22%, to 8.9 billion
Belgian francs ($275.6 million) from 7.3 billion Belgian
francs in the year-earlier period.
   Sales declined 6% to 50.1 billion Belgian francs from 53.3
billion Belgian francs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Belgian steel foundry said the increase in profit was
due to extraordinary gains. Without the gains, profit would
have been about half the level of year-ago earnings, the
company said.</p>
<p>Cockerill predicted noticeably weaker second-half results
because of lower prices and volume for steel products.
Moreover, it said it didn't expect to realize the same level
of one-time gains as during the first half.</p>
<p>"The profit for 1990 should nonetheless remain
satisfactory, without attaining the exceptional level seen in
1989,' the company said.</p>
