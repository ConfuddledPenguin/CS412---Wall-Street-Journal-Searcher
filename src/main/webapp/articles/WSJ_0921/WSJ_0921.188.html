	<p class="article-leader">LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- First Commercial Corp. said its board
adopted a shareholder rights' plan designed to deter hostile
takeovers.
   The multibank holding company said it doesn't know of any
such efforts to acquire the company, but adopted the plan to
prevent an acquirer from gaining control of the corporation
without offering a fair price to all holders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it would issue one preferred stock
purchase right for each common share outstanding to stock of
record as of a week from today. The rights entitle holders to
buy common shares at half price if a hostile suitor acquires
20% of the company's common stock or launches a tender or
exchange offer to do so.</p>
