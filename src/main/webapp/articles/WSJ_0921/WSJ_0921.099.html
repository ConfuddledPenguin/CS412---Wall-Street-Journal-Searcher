	<p class="article-leader">EINDHOVEN, the Netherlands -- As expected, N.V. Philips,
the Dutch electronics giant, said that it would sell its 15%
stake in AT&T Network Systems International BV back to
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
   A spokesman for Philips declined to provide financial
information on how the transfer of the stake, which is
effective immediately, will be done. The transfer of
Philips's 15% stake in AT&T-NSI back to AT&T will boost
AT&T's holdings in the joint venture to 74% from 59%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Spain's Telefonica de Espana S.A. and Italy's Stet Group
hold 6% and 20% stakes, respectively, in the joint venture.</p>
