	<p class="article-leader">BETHESDA, Md. -- Martin Marietta Corp. said it completed
the first sale of holdings of its Orlando Central Park Inc.
unit in Orlando, Fla., under a divestiture program announced
last year.
   The $42.5 million sale includes 150 acres for hotel and
retail development and the Mercado Shopping Village in the
Plaza international project in Orlando, the company said. The
properties were sold to three groups of investors, who
weren't identified.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company had announced in August 1989 that it planned
to shed its Orlando Central Park holdings, and said yesterday
that efforts to complete the program are continuing. The
company's 50% interest in Orlando Peabody Hotel isn't
included in the program.</p>
