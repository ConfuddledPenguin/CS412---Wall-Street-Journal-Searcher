	<p class="article-leader">President Gorbachev seemed unambiguous enough last week
when he threw his support behind the more radical of two
approaches for attacking the Soviet Union's economic crisis,
but now he's temporizing.
   On Monday the president decided that a national referendum
would be necessary on a crucial element of the program: land
ownership. In other words, Soviet citizens must be asked if
they think that they should be allowed to own land.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A referendum would take months, postponing the program put
together by Professor Stanislav Shatalin -- a 500-day
timetable for curbing state spending, eliminating subsidies
to state-owned industrial and agricultural enterprises and
putting land into private hands. And delay could doom the
effort entirely. The Soviet Union is slipping into anarchy.
It may soon be too late for organized reform.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Mr. Gorbachev has avoided
the most direct route between two points. Perestroika has
thus far been a bust because Mr. Gorbachev refuses to follow
the logic of reform to its necessary conclusions. The whole
world sees that the Soviet Union must move toward free
markets.</p>
<p>But advocates of the go-slow approach, led up by Premier
Nikolai Ryzhkov, still managed to convince Mr. Gorbachev that
the union is endangered by the Shatalin plan. Mr. Ryzhkov
even told a reporter that if his own program is rejected, "I
will not carry out any other." He's worried that the program,
which would start October 1, would stack the cards in favor
of secessionist republics. Last week the prime minister said,
on Soviet television monitored by the BBC, that the proposal
to pay taxes exclusively at the local and republic level
"means the elimination of the U.S.S.R. as a single state. The
government will not accept this path."</p>
<p>Boris Yeltsin, the head of the Russian Republic, is fully
aware of this. He knows that the disintegration of the Soviet
Union would leave him in control of a superpower, arguably
more manageable and more potent than the current U.S.S.R. The
Russian Federation has already adopted the Shatalin plan, and
Mr. Yeltsin's supporters are evidently ready to turn Moscow
upside down on behalf of a radical overhaul.</p>
<p>But don't underestimate Mikhail Gorbachev; he too knows
how to read political tea leaves. By siding with orthodoxy
after all, he is saying in effect that he has little faith in
the radicals' solution. One could say that his two kopeck's
worth of support last week for the program was grossly
overvalued. The president as obliquely as ever is now casting
his ever-variable vote with those who would preserve the
empire and their own positions of power in it.</p>
<p>These sudden turns in events at the highest levels of the
Soviet government help one understand the depth of feeling
Alekandr Solzhenitsyn expressed in his article published in
the Soviet Union this week: "Nothing useful will ever be
reached unless the Communist-Leninist party yields not just
one point of its constitutional power but is completely
separated from any influence on economic and state life,
completely gives up control over us or any aspect of our
lives."</p>
