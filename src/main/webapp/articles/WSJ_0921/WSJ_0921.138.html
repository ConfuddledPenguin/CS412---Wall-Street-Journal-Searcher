	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Buoyed until recently by an updraft, the blimp
industry has fallen to earth with a thud.
   The collapse of Airship Industries (U.K.) Ltd. has
deflated hopes for the dirigibles market. The company, which
with Westinghouse Electric Corp. is building a blimp for the
U.S. Navy, wasn't able to sell enough of its lighter-than-air
craft to keep up with steep research-and-development costs.
And with its parent company's major investor, Bond Corp.
Holdings Ltd., facing its own financial crisis, Airship
Industries U.K. couldn't find any cash.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If they had gone on for another two years, there might
have been quite good profit" from the Navy contract, says Ian
Bond, a partner at Cork Gully, the accountants called in to
salvage the British company's operations. But in the
meantime, he adds, "they haven't sold enough airships. It's
unlikely the company has made any money on a true accounting
basis for years and years."</p>
<p>Cork Gully has had half a dozen approaches from parties
interested in buying the business. Work is continuing on the
Navy contract at Airship Industries U.K.'s factory in
Bedfordshire, north of London. But if no firm offer arises in
the next few weeks, Mr. Bond says he will wind up the
company's operations, casting a cloud over completion of the
$168.9 million Navy contract and the overall blimp business.</p>
<p>Best known as cigar-shaped ads floating over sports
stadiums, blimps have been touted for wider use in recent
years. Airship Industries U.K., whose parent Airship
Industries Ltd. is 47.2%-owned by Bond Corp. of Australia,
has been the blimp's windiest backer, peddling it as a
tourist attraction and as a sturdy, stealthy surveillance
vehicle.</p>
<p>A blimp is simply a bulbous bag of helium with a crew
compartment slung under it. On its tail are propeller-driven
engines to push it, and fins to steer it. Blimps can hover
longer and more quietly than helicopters. Today's blimps use
inert helium instead of the highly flammable hydrogen that
destroyed the famous Hindenburg dirigible in New Jersey in
1937.</p>
<p>Airship Industries Ltd. has about a dozen blimps aloft
around the world. Among its customers are the Tokyo police,
which bought one last year to use in disasters such as
earthquakes and floods.</p>
<p>But the company's most prestigious -- and potentially
lucrative -- effort was its Navy project. The Navy awarded
the contract for a prototype surveillance blimp in June 1987
to Westinghouse-Airship Industries Inc., a joint venture
equally owned by Westinghouse and Airship Industries Ltd.
Airship Industries U.K. has acted as subcontractor.</p>
<p>The contract involves building a 400-foot blimp, equipped
with a large radar that can see supersonic, sea-skimming
anti-ship missiles from a long way off. The Navy originally
considered ordering a fleet of the airships estimated to cost
$5 billion. Subsequent budget pressures made that unlikely,
but the contract still was Airship Industries U.K.'s biggest
potential moneyspinner, propelling it beyond the advertising
and tourism markets.</p>
<p>But with overall blimp sales slow and development costs
high, Airship Industries U.K. now is about #50 million ($94.2
million) in debt, including #35 million owed to Bond Corp.
Meanwhile, Bond Corp., which rescued Airship Industries Ltd.
during earlier troubles in 1984, is undergoing its own
reorganization because of debt. "That checkbook has been
closed now," says Cork Gully's Mr. Bond, who isn't related to
Bond Corp.'s Alan Bond.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that Airship Industries U.K. couldn't pay
its debts, the parent company last week summoned Cork Gully.
In Britain, companies that can't pay their debts usually hand
the business over to accountants, who then try to find a
buyer.</p>
<p>Cork Gully now is doing just that, with help from
Westinghouse. Mr. Bond is cautious about the prospects. "We
hope things work out well, but one never knows," he says. If
no buyer emerges in two weeks, Cork Gully will auction the
company's assets; Westinghouse will have to decide whether to
carry on without Airship Industries U.K., Mr. Bond says. "It
leaves them with a little bit of a problem."</p>
<p>A Westinghouse spokesman says only that the joint venture
is "making arrangements" to perform the Navy contract
"through alternate means."</p>
<p>Despite the collapse of Airship Industries U.K., the blimp
enthusiasts remain.</p>
<p>Advanced Airship Corp. insists "airships are alive and
well." The company, based on the Isle of Man off the west
coast of England, says it has nearly finished a prototype
blimp that flies faster and carries more passengers than
rival models. Advanced Airship boasts "a ready market" for
early production models.</p>
<p>John Hooper, a company director, doesn't want to name
prospective buyers. But he cites as potential customers
advertisers and tourism groups, military forces and
government bodies such as drug-enforcement agencies. "Any
organization that needs an eye in the sky," he says.</p>
