	<p class="article-leader">REGIONAL TRADING ALLIANCES. Slowly -- and haltingly --
nations seem to be embracing them. Which leads to a question:
Are trading alliances a boon or a hindrance to international
trade?
   The answer is yes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Free-trade agreements within regions are designed to
expand trade and are roundly welcomed by most economists. The
worry is that such agreements can easily lead to the dreaded
protectionist trading blocs -- defensive pacts that set up
barriers around regions and prevent the flow of goods from
one region to another.</p>
<p>What might a world of regional trading blocs look like?
The accompanying map portrays one such world -- based on
today's conventional wisdom (see accompanying illustration --
WSJ Sept. 21, 1990).</p>
<p>On the left-hand side of the map is the Americas bloc. As
the strongest nation economically and politically, the United
States is naturally at the center of the bloc. Canada and
Mexico would be important secondary players in the Americas
bloc, as would the rest of Latin America.</p>
<p>The U.S.-Canada free-trade agreement, which took effect
last year, is widely regarded in the U.S. as an expansion of
free trade. But it is viewed with alarm by some Japanese as
the beginning of a regional, protectionist bloc. The same is
true about the recently discussed possibility of a free-trade
agreement between the U.S. and Mexico.</p>
<p>The same conflicting perspectives define the second bloc
on the chart -- the European bloc. The 1992 economic
integration of Western Europe and the dramatic developments
in Eastern Europe suggest a potential for a large and strong
economic alliance. But the question remains: Will European
unity be primarily a trade-expanding measure by the EC
countries? Or will it facilitate the erection of
protectionist walls, the so-called fortress Europe?</p>
<p>And in Asia, there is much talk these days about a "yen"
bloc, linking Japan's economy more closely with the economies
of other Asian countries. The result, as in North America and
Europe, would be a more self-sufficient region, better able
to provide both raw materials and markets within the region
-- and perhaps more willing to reduce trade with America or
Europe.</p>
<p>Japanese government officials loudly assail regional
trading blocs that serve as protectionist trade umbrellas.
But they also concede that blocs may be an unfortunate but
emerging trend.</p>
<p>"There is a little bit of cohesiveness among the nations
of the Pacific Rim," said Kazuo Nukazawa, managing director
of Keidanren, the Japanese big-business organization, on a
recent Public Broadcasting Service television program.
"Largely, they are afraid of American protectionism or
European protectionism."</p>
<p>Whether blocs emerge is impossible to say. Already,
however, many companies are hedging their bets by
establishing a large presence in each region. Hence the
recent flurry of cross-border acquisitions and the rash of
global alliances and joint ventures. Direct investment, as
the U.S. discovered in the 1950s and 1960s in Europe, is the
way to become an "insider" in foreign lands. In a world of
blocs, mere exporters, are the biggest losers.</p>
