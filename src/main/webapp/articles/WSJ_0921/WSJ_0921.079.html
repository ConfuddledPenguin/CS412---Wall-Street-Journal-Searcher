	<p class="article-leader">LOWELL, Mass. -- Wang Laboratories Inc. disclosed in its
annual report that it sold its Intecom subsidiary to the
Matra Communications unit of Matra S.A. of Paris for just $26
million.
   Wang had previously announced the sale, but hadn't
divulged the price. It had acquired Intecom, a Richardson,
Texas, maker of telephone switchboards, for some $89 million
in cash and Wang stock then valued at $140 million. The
acquisition, which took place in stages beginning in 1984,
was completed in 1986. One former executive who asked not to
be identified said that Wang had spent a total of $240
million buying the unit and attempting to make it profitable.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As previously reported, Wang had a net loss of $715.9
million, or $4.35 a share, in fiscal 1990, widened from a net
loss of $424.3 million, or $2.59 a share, in fiscal 1989. The
loss for fiscal 1990 included a loss on discontinued
operations, including Intecom, of $87.3 million. The 1990
loss was over and above a $100.l million loss on discontinued
operations in 1989 that included an earlier projection for
losses on the sale of Intecom.</p>
<p>Wang sold off Intecom, two financing subsidiaries and some
smaller units over the past 12 months to raise cash and pay
off bank debt. Richard Miller, who was hired as president in
August 1989 to turn around the struggling computer maker said
that bank debt now has been cut to $12 million from $575
million in August 1989.</p>
<p>Wang said that total current liabilities have shrunk 10%
to $872.1 million and long-term debt was reduced 11% as of
June 30. It said that shareholders equity fell 63% to $414.9
million from $1.13 billion.</p>
<p>Wang has been slashing costs and said that operating costs
have been cut by about $500 million a year. Employment has
been reduced to about 19,500 today from 31,500 in December
1988.</p>
<p>Intecom's buyer, Matra Communications, is 70%-owned by the
parent, 20% by Cie. Financiere De Paribas, and 10% publicly
held.</p>
<p>Although Wang didn't break out Intecom separately, in the
annual report it disclosed that Intecom and Wang Financial
Information Services Inc., a much smaller operation that was
sold for $16 million, had a combined loss from operations of
$18.6 million on revenue of $103.5 million in fiscal 1990.</p>
