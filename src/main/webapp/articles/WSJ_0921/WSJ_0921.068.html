	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian steel production totaled 159,248 metric
tons in the week ended Saturday, up 0.4% from 158,653 tons in
the preceding week but down 46% from 286,816 tons a year
earlier, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.
   The drop from the 1989 pace is partly attributable to an
ongoing strike at Stelco Inc., a steel concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cumulative total in 1990 was 9,421,764 tons, down 16%
from 11,143,714 tons a year earlier.</p>
