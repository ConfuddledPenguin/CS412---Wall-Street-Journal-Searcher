revising the legal status of Portugal's largest commercial

   Banco Portugues do Atlantico will be transformed from a
purely state company into a public limited company in which
the state will remain the only shareholder. The eventual
privatization of BPA is scheduled to be held in three stages.
The first sale of 33% of shares expected before the end of
