	<p class="article-leader">TCBY Enterprises Inc. said fiscal third-quarter net income
fell 42%, adding that it doesn't expect to post "positive"
same-store sales for the year.
   In the nine months ended Aug. 31, TCBY said same-store
sales fell 12.7%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Little Rock, Ark., chain of frozen-yogurt stores said
third-quarter profit was $6.7 million, or 25 cents a share,
down from $11.5 million, or 43 cents a share, a year ago. In
late August, the company said it expected such a drop,
largely because of increased competition and bad weather.</p>
<p>Sales and franchising revenue fell 11% to $43.6 million
from a restated $49.2 million. TCBY said it opened 99 stores
in the quarter, bringing the total to 1,894.</p>
<p>TCBY said it is continuing to implement programs for sales
outside stores. But it added that "additional sales from
these programs are not expected to reach significant levels
in 1990." The company said it is also testing in-store menu
items such as salads, Slim-Fast shakes and Slim-Fast frozen
products. TCBY franchisees have complained recently about a
paucity of new products.</p>
