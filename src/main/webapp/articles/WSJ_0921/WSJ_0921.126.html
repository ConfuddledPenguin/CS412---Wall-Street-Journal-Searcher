	<p class="article-leader">Sometimes, when really relaxed, Katy MacDonald can shut
one eye and keep the other eye open.
   That's right, she winks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But only on a good day. Usually, this 35-year-old
psychotherapist in Berkeley, Calif., barely manages to make
what she calls "my fake wink" -- a facial contortion in which
she crunches her forehead and shuts both eyes at once.</p>
<p>Ms. MacDonald is part of a little known, poorly
researched, suffering-in-silence minority: nonwinkers. The
inability to wink may seem like one of life's smaller
tribulations. But those who have the affliction -- including
this reporter -- feel both put upon and shut out by those who
don't.</p>
<p>The case of Wendy Lustbader, a Seattle, Wash., social
worker, is typical. She says she's "felt mocked by winks
since childhood."</p>
<p>"I hate being winked at," says Ms. Lustbader, who delivers
a real wink about once in every 10 tries. "I'm very aware of
the others in the room, and the winker makes me a
co-conspirator. You don't know the wink is coming, and you're
entwined in it. You can't defend against a wink. It happens
so fast."</p>
<p>What's her problem?</p>
<p>Many biologists and physicians believe that winking is
genetically determined. They say that the brains of people
like Ms. Lustbader, Katy MacDonald and Ms. MacDonald's
father, who also can't wink, are somehow "wired" differently,
making it difficult for them to control the major muscle
around the eye. "There might be a subtle abnormality in the
brain stem, or your hardwiring somewhere makes it
impossible," says Craig Karson, a professor of psychiatry at
the University of Arkansas.</p>
<p>A similar kind of abnormality may exist in people who
can't wiggle their ears. Yet unlike ear wiggling, a kind of
party gag, winking has charismatic power, "especially in a
one-to-one situation," says Robert Whiteside, who writes
widely on body language. As a gesture, the wink is well
understood as an invitation to intimacy, and when not overtly
sexual, it signifies collusion or solidarity.</p>
<p>"The message of the wink," writes anthropologist Desmond
Morris, is "you and I are momentarily involved in a shared
act which secretly excludes all others."</p>
<p>Moreover, adds Nancy Henley, a professor of psychology at
UCLA, "A wink is something you can do when your arms are full
with grocery bags."</p>
<p>For those born with the proper wiring, winking is easily
learned, usually in childhood, sometimes on the first try.
But experts estimate that millions of Americans have trouble
getting the hang of it. According to "Adler's Physiology of
the Eye," a standard medical text, "Many persons cannot wink
until they are taught, and some never learn to close one eye
at all." Antonio Sanchez, a yoga instructor in San Francisco,
says he had a girlfriend who couldn't wink. At non-Nirvanic
moments, "I would wink at her, and she couldn't wink back,"
he recalls. "It really bugged her. So I developed an exercise
for her. After a lot of effort, she learned to wink."</p>
<p>Mr. Sanchez and that girlfriend have since parted ways,
but his dedication to helping nonwinkers wink remains intact.
He's devised a simple exercise for them: Stand in front of a
mirror and rub both hands together until the palms are warm.
Place a palm on each eye. Uncover one eye. Hold the other eye
shut with the helping hand while tightening the muscle around
that eye. Then withdraw the hand and keep the muscle tight.</p>
<p>Don't expect to master the wink in one try, Mr. Sanchez
warns. "It could take you days, weeks, even months," he says.
"Concentration is everything."</p>
<p>Horses, it seems, have an easier time of it. Roy
Markegard, a horse trainer in Half Moon Bay, Calif., says
he's taught 80 of his equine friends to wink simply by
winking at them until they wink back. "Dogs can wink, too,"
he adds.</p>
<p>Strangely the scientific establishment has paid scant
attention to the plight of nonwinkers, devoting little
research to the problem. When pressed, experts will say
something like this: "It may be that the person who can't
wink lacks some general inhibitory capacity, that he may be
excessively aroused," says Joseph Tecce, a psychologist at
Boston College. But then the physical benefits of winking are
hardly romantic. "Winking helps the circulation of tears,
both by increasing drainage and by causing constriction of
the lacrimal gland," says the "Encyclopedia of the Eye."</p>
<p>It's worrisome, of course, when a person suddenly loses
the ability to wink. "It ought to require examination,"
opines Barret Katz, a neuro-ophthalmologist in San Francisco.
This rare disorder, called Revilloid's sign, is a puzzle to
physicians. In general, though, the inability to wink "isn't
a hot issue," Dr. Katz adds.</p>
<p>None of this is very helpful to nonwinkers, particularly
someone like Lindsay Peters, a 12-year-old from Ofrage, Pa.,
who's weighing a career as an astronomer but has trouble
looking through a telescope. "I try to squint, or I might
cover my eye with my hand," she says. Eye patches can be
used, but they're awkward and look stylish only on the
Hathaway man.</p>
<p>Bill Hayes, a former policeman from Albuquerque, N.M.,
says he learned to wink only because he had to. "I could
close one eye on the firing range," where he needed to
display expert marksmanship, but no where else, he says. Now
retired, Mr. Hayes has lost his ability to wink and reports
trouble using cameras.</p>
<p>An inability to wink can be an occupational hazard even on
the other side of the camera. John C. Fletcher, an acting
teacher at American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco,
asks every student in his beginning classes to wink, as part
of a series of dramatic exercises.</p>
<p>"Invariably someone in the class can't wink," he says.
"This is an ongoing issue."</p>
<p>Mr. Fletcher thinks "an actor should be able to move his
body any way he pleases." He convinces skeptical students of
the value of winking in this way: "I bring up the image of
the filming of their first big role: Steven Spielberg comes
in for a closeup and asks for a wink. What do you do? Tell
him you can't wink?"</p>
<p>Afterwards, few students ignore winking, he says.</p>
<p>It may well be, however, that winking is on the wane. "It
was much more popular 30 to 40 years ago," says Paul Ekman, a
psychologist and expert in facial behavior at the University
of California at San Francisco. Mr. Ekman explains that such
"facial emblems" as winking contain clear meanings and are
"the physical equivalent of words, but they go in and out of
style." Some non-Western cultures, such as the South Fore
people in New Guinea, ascribe no meaning to a wink, and even
in the West, Mr. Ekman notes, today "winking is almost
passe."</p>
<p>And there's more good news for nonwinkers: In certain
situations, winking is highly improper, says etiquette maven
Charlotte Ford. "If a man is winking at a women for sexual
reasons, that is vulgar," she says.</p>
<p>But Marianna Nunes, who gives seminars on flirting in the
San Francisco area and knows all about the language of
romance, thinks even a messy wink by a nonwinker may be
better than its modern equivalent. "Personally, I'd like to
see more {winking}," she says. "Now, there's more showing off
your body."</p>
