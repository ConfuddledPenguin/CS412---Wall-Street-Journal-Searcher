	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- As the nations of the European Community move
toward economic integration at the end of 1992, it's already
clear that tomatoes will be able to travel across national
borders with no impediments -- which is more than the people
who eat them may be able to do.
   Bureaucrats and national negotiators have already agreed
upon more than half of the 282 regulations that are needed to
make the new Europe fully integrated. (Tomatoes and other
goods, for example, will be able to move across internal EC
borders without stopping at border checkpoints.) But the
bureaucrats are now encountering more than a few glitches
that are slowing the work -- threatening to make 1992 a more
incomplete integration than had been predicted or hoped for.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The issues range from taxes to auto imports to worries
about terrorists and rabid dogs. No issue is more important,
however, than the free movement of people across borders. For
the average EC citizen, the removal of border controls on
such movement is "the most visible and tangible proof of the
reality of a unified Community," says EC Commission President
Jacques Delors.</p>
<p>The sticking point here is the failure of member nations
to agree on a common immigration policy. If they can't break
the logjam, people moving around the EC will still be
standing in line to show their passports while they watch the
tomato trucks whiz by. To get the people moving freely, the
EC will somehow have to reconcile in one immigration policy
the widely differing ones of member nations.</p>
<p>Germany, for one, doesn't require visas for temporary
visitors from East Bloc nations. This wouldn't have mattered
much a couple of years ago. But with the breakdown of Soviet
domination of Eastern Europe and the freedom of movement
people there have gained, the EC nations will have to contend
with a flood of new visitors, many seeking jobs and a new
life in the West.</p>
<p>Adopting an EC-wide policy like Germany's is worrisome to
member nations such as France, Spain, Italy, Ireland and the
Netherlands, where unemployment rates range from 9% to 16% of
the work force. But these nations, too, have liberal policies
of their own toward certain favored states, usually former
colonies. A lot of compromises will have to be made.</p>
<p>There are other reasons for concern beyond the sheer
number of immigrants that might be attracted by an open
policy. The UK, for one fears that a lax policy will to
easily allow in drug smugglers, terrorists and other
criminals -- who, once inside the EC, will be able to move
all over it without check. But at the same time, citing
issues of national sovereignty, the UK is reluctant to go
along with the solution favored by other nations: creation of
an EC police force modeled after the American FBI.</p>
<p>So the immigration matter is stuck in the mud, at least
for the moment, along with some other complex issues in the
1992 program. Still clinging to concerns for their
sovereignty and traditions, the 12 EC states each have at
least one or two items in the 1992 agenda that they would
like to toss out the window and are reluctant to give way on.</p>
<p>The French and Italians, for instance, want their auto
industries protected against wholesale invasion by Japanese
car makers. They, along with Britain, Spain and Portugal,
currently limit the number of Japanese cars sold in their
countries. During a negotiating session in Brussels earlier
this year, French European Affairs Minister Edith Cresson
declared that "the final aim" of the Japanese car makers is
"to conquer market share and then kill" their European
competitors.</p>
<p>But the countries that don't restrict Japanese auto
imports, including Belgium, Germany and the Netherland, are
loath to put EC-wide restrictions on them. They fear that
limiting imports would also limit competition, leading to
higher auto prices for EC customers. One possible solution:
persuade Japan to voluntarily limit its exports to the
now-protected markets for a transition period, which could
last until 1997 or 1998.</p>
<p>Tax policy is another headache. Because few governments
are willing to give up much control over taxes, only a few
trade-related tax measures were included in the 1992 program
-- and even these are stalled. They include stopping double
taxation on companies operating in two or more states, and
reducing the difference in the EC states' widely varying
value-added tax rates. Christiane Scrivener, the EC
commissioner in charge of the tax dossier, says: "Taxation is
one of the thorniest issues, precisely because it has to do
with both sovereignty and money."</p>
<p>The EC countries are having similar troubles trusting each
other's health standards. Britain is worried that allowing
free trade in animals will jeopardize one of that nation's
proudest achievements -- the eradication of rabies. Other
countries have similar worries about certain plant diseases.
As a result, only about half of the 100 plant-health and
veterinary items in the 1992 program have been passed, and
most experts believe that some of them will still be
unresolved after 1992.</p>
<p>Reaching agreement on these and other matters would be
difficult enough in stable times, and these are times of
flux. Diplomats, national parliaments, the EC Commission and
others directly involved in the 1992 agenda are being
distracted by the need to handle all sorts of things beyond
the writing and approval of regulations -- the Gulf crisis,
the opening of the East Bloc, demands on Europe to help the
Soviet Union, new applications for EC membership from
Austria, Cyprus, Turkey and Malta, and on and on. The
community has "a lot on its plate," British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said recently, urging other EC members not
to let the momentum behind 1992 slow down.</p>
<p>Moreover, the global economy looks much shakier now than
it did during the first 2 1/2 years of 1992 negotiations,
when growth was brisk. If it slips into a full-blown
recession or worse, the EC nations will be likely to become
even more protective of their own interests and industries,
and much more reluctant to make the compromises they might
have agreed to when they were flush.</p>
<p>The difficulties they've already been having in resolving
issues are exasperating enough to the Eurocrats. "If we have
to check every box, crate or trainload of goods that crosses
a border to make sure they don't contain any rabid dogs, then
the single market will be a farce," grumbles one EC official.</p>
<p>But in almost the same breath, he predicts that for all
the difficulties, the 1992 program will indeed be a success.
Most of the sticking points will start to come unstuck in
months to come, he believes. The reason? So much has already
been done and so much momentum built up that 1992 has become
an irresistible force. "No government wants to take
responsibility for it failing," he says.</p>
<p>There are signs that he may well be correct. Even the
sticky border-controls problem may be yielding, at least to
some extent; earlier this year, France, Germany, Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg agreed to remove immigration
controls among themselves, and other states have asked to
join them.</p>
<p>Success for the 1992 program is also seen by those who
point out that the measures already passed have transformed
the business landscape in Europe, creating a surge of
investment and building up political pressure to get the rest
of the program passed on time. "In many ways, European
business has already gone beyond 1992," says Sir Leon
Brittan, the EC commissioner for financial services and
competition policy. "What it offers is already being built
into company planning for the next century."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some businessmen and others with a stake in
the success of 1992 are trying to prepare the public for the
fact that when the magic date of Dec. 31, 1992, arrives,
there may be more than a few loose ends left to tie up. Price
Waterhouse, the management consulting firm, has gone so far
as to suggest that the deadline be abandoned.</p>
<p>Noting that formal talks on such complex matters as a
single Eurocurrency and a more unified foreign-policy and
political structure won't even begin until December, Price
Waterhouse maintains in a recent EC review that the deadline
is not really meaningful. "Those persisting with a blinkered
view of a deadline {more than two years away} had better
think again," the study says.</p>
