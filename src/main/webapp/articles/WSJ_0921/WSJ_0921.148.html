	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Consumer and industry groups alike are
fighting a Bush administration plan that would boost up-front
costs for borrowers of loans backed by the Federal Housing
Administration.
   The plan is designed to protect the solvency of the FHA's
mutual mortgage insurance fund, which insures low
down-payment mortgages on single-family homes. Officials of
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, citing a
study by Price Waterhouse, say the fund isn't operating on a
sound basis, in part because of poor management and lax
monitoring during the Reagan administration. The officials
predict that the fund will be insolvent by the middle of the
decade.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The administration, among other things, wants to add a
0.5% premium to high-risk loans and require home buyers to
pay two-thirds of the closing costs in cash at settlement.
The HUD plan would eliminate as many as 100,000 borrowers
annually, according to the National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>The Senate housing bill has incorporated the
administration's plan. But a different proposal, which is
backed by several trade and consumer groups, is contained in
legislation passed by the House. The two versions must be
resolved by a conference committee.</p>
<p>The House version, known as the Vento-Ridge alternative,
would reduce the current up-front premium to 1.35% from 3.8%,
but add a 0.6% annual insurance premium. The up-front cash
needed by home buyers would remain about the same as under
current FHA requirements.</p>
<p>Currently, the buyer of a house selling for $100,000 would
have to pay $6,600 at settlement. That figure would rise to
$7,866 under the HUD proposal, according to figures released
by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs.</p>
<p>Both the HUD plan and the Vento-Ridge alternative would
keep the FHA fund financially stable, according to Price
Waterhouse. Administration officials have said they would
recommend a veto of the House housing legislation, in part
because of its FHA measure.</p>
<p>HUD Secretary Jack Kemp and his aides have met with
industry groups in an attempt to resolve the differences.
"We've been talking with all elements of the industry," said
Mary Brunette, a department spokeswoman. "We're working to
resolve some of the differences so the conference can go
forward."</p>
<p>Warren Lasko, executive vice president of the Mortgage
Bankers Association, said his organization doesn't believe
the financial troubles of the FHA are as bad as the
administration contends.</p>
<p>The HUD proposal has made some strange bedfellows of its
opponents. Consumer advocates, such as the Consumer's Union
and National People's Action, usually find themselves on the
opposite side of issues from trade associations such as the
National Association of Realtors.</p>
<p>"It's one of those issues where their profit interest in
putting people in houses parallels our interest in putting
people in houses," said Michelle Meier of the Consumer's
Union.</p>
