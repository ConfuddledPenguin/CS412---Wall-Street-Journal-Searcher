   On Medicare Galls Firms</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>THE PROPOSAL by a small company to help trim the U.S.
budget deficit has provoked a corporate outcry over soaring
health costs.</p>
<p>Ren, a Nashville, Tenn., provider of kidney dialysis
services, wants Congress to require private insurers to pay
more of the $2 billion annual bill for dialysis treatment now
covered by Medicare. Budget negotiators are considering the
idea.</p>
<p>Currently, employers provide primary coverage for
employees for 12 months -- about $200 million a year.
Medicare picks up the bill thereafter, as well as for the
large majority of the 110,000 dialysis patients who are over
65. Ren says its plan to extend employers' coverage to two
years would double their costs, reducing the federal deficit
by $200 million.</p>
<p>Business leaders are enraged. High health costs, as well
as the deficit, undermine U.S. competitiveness, says Walter
B. Maher, director of federal relations at Chrysler. "You do
absolutely nothing to reduce costs when one payer decides to
dodge the bullet and shift costs to another payer."
Particularly galling, he asserts, is that Ren expects to
profit from the cost-shifting, because private insurers pay
more for dialysis than Medicare does.</p>
<p>Thomas Mills, a partner in Dyer, Ellis Joseph & Mills,
Washington, and a lobbyist for Ren, acknowledges that Ren and
others would benefit. But he says that Medicare reimbursement
has declined in real terms in recent years and that
Medicare's dialysis program -- which began in the early 1970s
when treatment was so expensive that insurers balked and
people died -- is now an anomaly. Major heart operations and
other procedures routinely covered by private insurers are
far more expensive than dialysis, which costs about $22,500 a
year.</p>
<p>But for business, the extra $200 million won't buy a
nickel of additional care and may discourage smaller
companies from buying coverage for workers, says Willis
Goldbeck, president of the Washington Business Group on
Health. "This is totally contrary to the direction that
health insurance needs to go in the U.S."</p>
<p>Insurance Net for Poor</p>
<p>Frayed Badly in 1980s</p>
<p>MINORITY and low-income people have borne the brunt of a
decade of erosion in private insurance coverage, a U.S. study
says.</p>
<p>In 1987, just 42% of poor and low-income people under 65
had health coverage, down from 56% 10 years earlier,
according to the report. During the same period, the
proportion of middle and upper-income insured remained level
at about 86%.</p>
<p>The number of uninsured increased by 11.5 million, or more
than 40% over the decade, the study found, and more than half
of them were black or Hispanic.</p>
<p>"Poor and low-income people are today twice as likely as
the rest of the population to have no health coverage," says
David Satcher, president of Meharry Medical College,
Nashville, Tenn. Not surprisingly, other research
demonstrates that those without insurance get less care and
may be less healthy as a result.</p>
<p>The study, by Pamela Short and colleagues at the U.S.
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, appears in the
inaugural issue of the Journal of Health Care for the Poor
and Underserved, published recently by Meharry, and is based
on federal surveys of 15,000 households. In commentary
accompanying the report, Woodrow Myers, New York City's
health commissioner, says such data "should be considered a
tragedy and a crisis, although it generally is not."</p>
<p>Nurses Get Public's Vote</p>
<p>As Best Bet to Cut Costs</p>
<p>THE NATION'S nurses may hold one of the keys to lowering
health-care costs.</p>
<p>Most people think nurses are far more likely to play a
"constructive" role in reducing medical costs than doctors,
hospital administrators or insurers, according to a poll
conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates Inc. for the
National League of Nursing.</p>
<p>Other health research indicates nurses can provide such
routine services as screenings and physicals more
cost-effectively than doctors, says Claire Fagin, dean at the
University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing. And the poll
indicated many people would be willing to see nurses for some
basic services instead of a doctor "if they thought it would
lower health-care costs," says Pamela Maraldo, the nursing
league's chief executive officer. People are particularly
interested in getting nurses to provide more care at home to
avert nursing home admissions for the elderly.</p>
<p>But even when nurses provide such services, usually
doctors must bill Medicare and many other insurers for them.
"There's no reason why Medicare should pay physicians to give
nursing care when nurses provide the care," argues Ms.
Maraldo. The poll, she says, supports her profession's quest
for status to bill Medicare directly.</p>
<p>It's an uphill fight. For one thing, policy makers worry
that opening the Medicare spigot to another provider group
could cause an immediate runup in spending. Then there's
another poll that nurses lost decisively. In June, the
American Medical Association voted to oppose moves to give
more clinical and financial autonomy to nurses and other
non-physician providers.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>ONE-PACK-A-DAY retirees who quit smoking today could
reduce next year's health bills by $2,300 each, says a study
of Bank of America retirees by J. Paul Leigh, an economist at
San Jose State University. . . . Metropolitan Life Insurance
paid $111.2 million in AIDS-related medical claims last year,
nearly double the $63.5 million of 1988.</p>
