	<p class="article-leader">BUFFALO, N.Y. -- National Fuel Gas Supply Corp., the
pipeline subsidiary of National Fuel Gas Co., said it will
invest $30.1 million to complete a project to import gas from
Canada.
   To finish the project, National Fuel will construct an
8,600-horsepower compressor in Concord, N.Y., while its
partner, Tennessee Gas Transmission Corp., will extend its
Niagara Spur pipeline by almost 50 miles. Total cost of the
jointly owned facilities is estimated at $65.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved the
final phase of the project, which will allow National Fuel to
transport an additional 161.5 million cubic feet of gas from
Canada per day. Construction begins this fall and is
scheduled for completion next summer.</p>
