	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices fell for the sixth consecutive trading
day Thursday to the year's low, with the pace of declines set
by interest rate-sensitive sectors.
   In London, shares closed lower after tumbling from an
opening high and breaking through two main support levels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues was down 123.19 points,
or 0.52%, at 23602.98.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Friday, the Nikkei index fell another 310.18
points to close the morning session at 23292.80.</p>
<p>On Thursday, stock prices rebounded from morning lows
during the afternoon session with help from small-volume
index-linked buying by investment trust funds and securities
companies, traders said.</p>
<p>But institutional buying thinned further, amid continuing
uncertainty about the direction of domestic interest rates
and the Mideast situation. Some investors also raised cash
positions ahead of Japan's long weekend, traders said. Tokyo
markets will be closed Monday for a national holiday.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section was estimated at 400 million
shares, in line with 390 million shares Wednesday. Losers
outnumbered gainers 754 to 191, while 156 issues were
unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 31.75 points, or 1.76%, to 1767.97.</p>
<p>The second section index dropped 55.20 points, or 1.60%,
to 3394.54. Volume in the section was estimated at 6.7
million shares, compared with almost seven million shares
Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We want to support the market by active buying if
possible," said an official at Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>But with the fiscal midyear book closing at the end of
September, trading activity of brokerage houses will be
restricted much like that of other major players including
financial institutions, he said.</p>
<p>With little buying support, stocks remained vulnerable
even to only a small amount of general selling as well as
arbitrage selling, traders said.</p>
<p>As many companies evaluate the value of holdings based on
stock prices on the last day of September, participants said,
some window dressing operations by brokerage houses and
institutions are expected to push up stock prices Sept. 28,
the last trading day of the month.</p>
<p>"Many expect the Nikkei to move up around 25000 or 26000
points {on Sept. 28}," a trader at Daiwa Securities said.</p>
<p>But in the longer term, volume is likely to remain poor,
making it difficult for stocks to rebound strongly.</p>
<p>"Being cautious is the best thing to do," said Hironobu
Hagio, manager of the equity division at Nippon Life
Insurance.</p>
<p>Unless domestic interest rates peak out or the Persian
Gulf problem is solved, institutions are unable to commit
themselves to the stock market, he said.</p>
<p>"It is true that we are waiting for a buying opportunity.
But as long as there is a possibility that stock prices may
fall further, we can't buy," Mr. Hagio said.</p>
<p>The most heavily traded issue Thursday was Kobe Steel,
with a total of 18 million of its shares changing hands. Kobe
Steel gained 4 yen to 539 yen ($3.92).</p>
<p>While financial issues are likely to come under further
pressure, shares that have been oversold, such as steels,
shipbuildings and paper-pulps, are expected to show technical
rebounds soon, said Hisamichi Sawa, vice president at
Prudential-Bache Securities (Japan).</p>
<p>Real estate shares were sold Thursday as a government
report on the latest nationwide land price data showed the
sharpest yearly growth on record, of an average 13.7%, in the
year ended July 1.</p>
<p>The report prompted speculation that the government will
continue to pressure the real estate industry to keep land
prices from rising, traders said.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Estate was down 70 yen at 1140 yen, while
Sumitomo Realty dropped 30 yen to 1060 yen.</p>
<p>Blue-chip electrics with strong earnings predictions also
failed to get support because of the lack of buy orders,
traders said.</p>
<p>Sony fell 110 yen to 6550 yen. Sharp dropped 40 yen to
1280 yen, while Matsushita Electric Industrial declined 50
yen to 1610 yen.</p>
<p>In London, the market fell through support levels for the
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index at 2050 and
2030 points.</p>
<p>The suspension of trading in Polly Peck following a
variety of rumors and a free fall in the company's share
price brought the fragile London market down, and was the
main talking point among traders.</p>
<p>"There is just no investor confidence. No one wants to
invest," one trader said. He added that there was no point in
traders buying when there was no support in the market, and
the prospect was for prices to fall even lower.</p>
<p>Wall Street slumped during the London afternoon session,
generating additional selling pressure in London.</p>
<p>The FT-SE 100-Share Index fell 48.9 points to 2016.9,
unable to match an opening high of 2069.2. The Financial
Times 30-Share Index closed down 45.1 points at 1531.0.
Volume was 517.7 million shares, well above Wednesday's 386.8
million.</p>
<p>Polly Peck shares were suspended at 108 pence ($2.04)
after a 135-pence fall from the Wednesday close. Rumors were
rampant, and the company wasn't commenting on the reasons for
the suspension except to say that it wanted to stop the
stock's free fall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Beazer fell 15 pence to 93 pence. The
construction company said it wasn't aware of any reason for
the fall, adding that interim results next week should be in
line with market expectations.</p>
<p>Cookson, a metals, chemicals and plastics maker, fell 36
pence to 54 pence. Cookson was hurt by rumors that it might
not be able to pay an interim dividend.</p>
<p>Among company results, brewing concern Guinness posted a
31% rise in pretax profit to #322 million. Initial market
enthusiasm was damped, and the shares ended 11 pence lower at
669 pence after a spurt upward at the opening of trading.</p>
<p>Glaxo also reported strong results. Half-year pretax
profit rose 13% to #1.14 billion, exceeding market forecasts.
But again, the initial enthusiasm faded, and the shares ended
5 pence lower at 716 pence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, shares closed lower in all major European
markets. South African gold stocks closed narrowly mixed.</p>
<p>And stocks closed lower in Sydney, Singapore, Seoul and
Taipei, mixed in Hong Kong, higher in Manila, and little
changed in Wellington.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
