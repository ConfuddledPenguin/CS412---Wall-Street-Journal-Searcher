	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Home Savings Bank, whose shareholders just
approved the bank's acquisition by H.F. Ahmanson & Co., said
it will suspend payment of the third-quarter dividend.
   Robert Pondt, Home Savings' senior executive vice
president, said the board of directors voted to suspend the
18.75-cent-a-share payout in the hope of saving about $2
million by the end of the year. The quarterly dividend was
last paid on July 19.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Pondt said the suspension of the payout wasn't at
Ahmanson's request, but he added that it could enhance Home
Savings' value to Ahmanson. He also said payment of a
fourth-quarter dividend depends on earnings reported for the
current quarter and completion of the acquisition, which is
expected by year end. However, he said the bank expects flat
third-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>The acquisition, valued at about $300 million, was
approved Wednesday by Home Savings' shareholders, and is
subject to regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Home Savings, with assets of $1.5 billion, operates 13
full-service banking offices in the New York metropolitan
area.</p>
<p>H. F. Ahmanson of Irwindale, Calif., with more than $47.6
billion in assets, is the parent company of Home Savings of
America and The Bowery Savings Bank.</p>
