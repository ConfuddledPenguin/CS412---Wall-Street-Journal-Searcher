	<p class="article-leader">ZURICH, Switzerland -- Swiss voters go to the polls Sunday
to decide on a future with or without nuclear power. The
outcome is far from certain.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has given the issue an Adrenalin
push as voters are forced to face Switzerland's vulnerability
as a small country heavily dependent on outside sources of
energy. About 65% of Switzerland's total energy needs come
from foreign oil sources. This dependence is balanced against
health and safety concerns over nuclear power plants.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The sensitivity of our situation is illustrated by
Kuwait," says Edwin Somm, Swiss executive vice president of
Asea Brown Boveri AG in Zurich.</p>
<p>Like other industrialized countries, a certain complacency
had set in after 1986, when cheap oil started to flow. But
now there are concerns over energy's significance for
Switzerland's future economic growth, jobs and national
security.</p>
<p>"Energy is the most important theme of our times,"
declares Vreni Spoerry, a Zurich representative in the
national parliament.</p>
<p>Three proposals will confront the Swiss electorate next
weekend. Two are a direct result of the 1986 Chernobyl
disaster, which shocked anti-nuclear groups into gathering
enough signatures to force national votes on their concerns.</p>
<p>One proposal would stop construction of future nuclear
plants and demand that present facilities close as soon as
feasible. The second would place a 10-year moratorium on
building any new plants.</p>
<p>Switzerland currently has five nuclear plants producing
around 40% of the country's electricity.</p>
<p>The Swiss government has strongly advised citizens to vote
against both initiatives. "It would be irresponsible to give
up nuclear energy as an option," says the government in a
brochure sent to every household to explain the issues.</p>
<p>In the brochure, which includes all viewpoints, supporters
of the initiatives declare: "In a thickly populated country
like Switzerland, nuclear power plants are an unacceptable
risk."</p>
<p>The third proposal is on a parliamentary decision to give
more powers to the federal government to determine energy
policy. The government would be empowered to lay down
guidelines for energy consumption, including the right to set
standards for energy use in factories, automobiles and
appliances.</p>
<p>In 1983, such central control was refused in a referendum
as a majority of cantons refused to go along. This time
around there is said to be considerably more support.
However, prominent voices are still opposed. "We won't save
energy, but face a flood of state regulations," protests
Heinz Allenspach, Swiss Employers' Association director. "All
we will get is more bureaucracy."</p>
<p>Hanging in streets throughout Switzerland this week are
posters with warning messages. Pedestrians are bombarded on
the one hand with warnings that if they vote against nuclear
energy, calamity will result through a breakdown of transport
and health facilities. On the other hand, they are asked
ominously from a poster depicting the Swiss flag: "Where do
you go after the nuclear catastrophe?" Coming as somewhat of
an emotional relief are dry appeals against the encroachment
of the state.</p>
<p>Switzerland isn't the only country faced with the nuclear
decision. The U.S., where nuclear power plants produce 19% of
the country's electricity, has pondered the issue since the
Three Mile Island accident in 1979. Sweden voted in 1980 to
gradually stop nuclear power use; but faced with finding an
alternative, it is now engaged in a debate over whether doing
so is possible. Italians voted after Chernobyl to drop
nuclear power development, and the government is betting on
an expansion of coal and gas production.</p>
<p>However, Switzerland will be the first country to vote on
the issue since the threat to Western oil supplies from the
Iraqi crisis.</p>
<p>In July, a survey by Zurich market researchers Isopublic
AG indicated that the Swiss would vote against nuclear
energy. Those surveyed were given a choice of three
alternatives: a stop, a moratorium, or continued
construction. About 46% wanted a stop; 25% a moratorium, and
19% favored continuation of nuclear power plant construction.
About 10% were undecided.</p>
<p>No survey has been made since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
"I wish that I'd been given the chance," says Isopublic
spokesman Robert Kappeler. "Through this crisis, public
opinion could have altered substantially."</p>
<p>Also, he points out, the referendum campaign is now in
full swing, and "that can change a lot in the way people
think."</p>
<p>For 30 years Alexander Euler, an engineer and member of
parliament, has fought against nuclear power. He argues:
"Atom reactors produce dangers which cannot be controlled.
Nuclear energy technology presumes that people don't make
mistakes. But making mistakes is part of being a person."</p>
<p>He pleads that it is possible to do without nuclear power
if electricity is used more efficiently, if more efficient
technologies are employed and if alternative sources of
energy are encouraged.</p>
<p>"Every kilowatt-hour of nuclear energy endangers plant,
animal and human life," Mr. Euler maintains. "Every nuclear
power plant increases the possibility of a catastrophe."</p>
