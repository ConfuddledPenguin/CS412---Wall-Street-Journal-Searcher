	<p class="article-leader">Federal Express Corp. reported a 42% gain in net income
for its first quarter, ended Aug. 31, on a 16% gain in
revenue.
   The Memphis, Tenn., express-delivery company said net was
$43.1 million, or 81 cents a share, compared with $30.4
million, or 58 cents a share. Revenue rose to $1.92 billion
from $1.65 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The per-share earnings exceeded analysts' estimates, but
there were several one-time items that contributed to the
results.</p>
<p>"It was seemingly a good quarter," said Kevin Murphy, an
analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co. "But there were some
materially significant items in there as well."</p>
<p>For one thing, Federal Express gained some charter
business from the U.S. military's Operation Desert Shield
buildup of troops and equipment in the Middle East. It also
picked up some shipments that would have gone to rival United
Parcel Service of America Inc., as some customers shifted
their business amid fears of a strike at UPS during the
quarter. Earnings also benefited from the sale of
noise-reduction kits for aircraft engines.</p>
<p>On an operating basis, Federal attributed the earnings
increase to cost-control efforts and productivity
improvements. It also said there was a "modest rebound" in
Asian air freight volume from the depressed levels of April
and May.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said Federal Express had another loss
on its international business, which has been going through a
costly expansion process, but he wouldn't elaborate.</p>
<p>Analysts said the U.S. operations' results were more
promising. "The domestic side of the house looks very strong,
even with weak volume, because of the much higher margins
they're getting" as a result of price increases this year,
said Doug Arthur, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody & Co.</p>
<p>To cover rising fuel costs caused by the Mideast showdown
with Iraq, Federal said it will raise some prices on most
overseas routes before the end of the year. It said the
increases will vary by route but will be within the company's
usual 3% to 7% range. The spokesman said he expects some
international competitors to follow suit.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Federal Express said it won't raise prices
further in its small package express business. The company
has increased those prices twice this year, by 4% to 5% in
April and 1% to 2% in July.</p>
<p>Federal Express said its fuel costs were in line with
expectations during the latest quarter but will be hurt by
higher prices as current fuel contracts expire.</p>
