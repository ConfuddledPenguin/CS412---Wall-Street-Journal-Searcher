	<p class="article-leader">American Telephone & Telegraph Co. made its first major
entry into the Mexican market by winning a $130 million
contract from Telefonos de Mexico S.A. de C.V., Mexico's
national telephone company.
   AT&T, based in New York, will build a major part of a
fiber optic network that will link 54 locations throughout
the country, significantly enhancing Mexico's international
long-distance infrastructure.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The contract is a coup for AT&T, whose other major
contract with Telmex was a $13 million project involving
digital access and cross connecting equipment.</p>
<p>AT&T outbid two of Mexico's largest traditional suppliers,
L.M. Ericsson of Sweden and Alcatel of France, to win the
right to build 60% of the network. Alcatel has been awarded a
contract to build 25% of the network and Ericsson 15%.</p>
<p>The Mexican project begins this month and will be
completed by 1993. It involves 8,000 miles of fiber-optic
cable and related equipment. AT&T and its Spanish subsidiary
will provide the cable, components, and transmission
equipment. AT&T will also be working with a Mexican
engineering and construction firm to provide Telmex with a
turnkey system.</p>
<p>The project will create one of the most modern telephone
networks in the world, offering high-quality transmission,
faster connection speeds and a larger call handling capacity.</p>
