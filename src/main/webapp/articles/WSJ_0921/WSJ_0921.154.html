	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration renewed its debate
over whether to draw down some oil from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, while U.S. officials voiced deep
skepticism about the newest Arab diplomatic effort to end the
crisis with Iraq.
   President Bush's national security advisers met to discuss
the strategic reserve, which President Bush has been
reluctant to use in the current crisis, administration aides
said. A senior official said Mr. Bush hasn't made any new
decisions, but indicated that the administration intends to
monitor the current escalation in oil prices carefully as it
weighs its policy toward the reserve.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"While there have been ups and downs and spikes, the price
has been increasing, and we'll have to watch that very
carefully," the official said. Crude oil futures reached a
record high yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>A key meeting of the International Energy Agency, an
organization that monitors oil supplies to industrial
nations, is scheduled for next week. The session could help
determine whether there is a consensus among the U.S. and
other countries about drawing down emergency oil stockpiles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, American officials disparaged a new effort by
Jordan's King Hussein to end the international confrontation
with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. King Hussein plans to visit
Iraq soon, along with the foreign ministers of Algeria and
Morocco, to take to Saddam Hussein ideas for ending Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait, Algerian radio announced.</p>
<p>King Hussein just finished a meeting with the leaders of
Algeria and Morocco in an attempt to find an Arab plan
acceptable to both Iraq and the international community that
has condemned the invasion.</p>
<p>But administration officials said they believed King
Hussein's latest proposals include concessions to Iraq that
won't be acceptable to the U.S.</p>
<p>"Like all the other plans that involve rewarding Saddam
Hussein, they can't be accepted," a senior administration
aide said. He added that the Bush administration is asserting
in its talks with Arab leaders that any steps that appear to
reward Saddam Hussein for his invasion of Kuwait will
increase the danger for other Arab nations by encouraging
similar aggression later.</p>
<p>Reports from Jordan indicate that the latest ideas carried
by King Hussein would link an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait with
a withdrawal of U.S. and other foreign forces from the
Persian Gulf region, and also would call for a plebiscite in
Kuwait six months after the Iraqi withdrawal, to determine
that country's future. It isn't clear what the other elements
might be.</p>
<p>As the Arab diplomatic maneuvering continued, the United
Nations Security Council moved closer to imposing an air
blockade on Iraq. That would expand trade sanctions the U.N.
already has imposed. The Security Council has prepared a
draft of a resolution that is being reviewed by governments
of its member nations and could be voted on today or
tomorrow, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>Such a resolution also might include provisions imposing
penalties on countries that circumvent the U.N.-mandated
embargo on trade with Iraq.</p>
<p>U.S. officials continue to insist that Iran, potentially a
big embargo-buster, isn't showing any signs of helping Iraq
in a significant way.</p>
<p>If Iran would agree to take Iraqi crude oil and ship it
onto the world market, either by building a spur connecting
the two countries' oil pipeline systems or by carrying oil
from Iraq to Iran on barges, it might be able to move out
200,000 barrels of Iraqi oil a day, one senior U.S. official
said. Saudi Arabian officials have expressed concern that
Iran might agree to do that.</p>
<p>But the U.S. official said that there isn't any indication
Tehran has agreed to help Iraq, and he asserted that Iran's
interests wouldn't be served by helping Iraq consolidate its
hold on Kuwait. He also noted that oil exports of the
magnitude Iran could facilitate wouldn't be enough to
alleviate Iraq's economic problems.</p>
<p>Separately, the propaganda war between the U.S. and Iraq
continued yesterday. Iraq said it wants to send the U.S. a
taped address by Saddam Hussein for use on American
television, answering the address by President Bush shown on
Iraqi television this week. Iraq's ambassador went to the
State Department to discuss sending such a tape.</p>
<p>The White House and State Department indicated that the
U.S. government would be willing to pass it on to American
television networks, but they noted the networks would decide
whether to broadcast it.</p>
<p>White House officials also indicated that there is a
chance President Bush will visit the Middle East in November.
Mr. Bush is likely to travel to Europe in mid-November to
sign a new East-West treaty cutting conventional arms.</p>
<p>Officials said he would like to go to Saudi Arabia to
visit American troops and to Egypt, which has supported the
U.S. in the Gulf crisis, on his way home. But such a trip
won't be firmly set until it is clearer what the Gulf
situation will be in November, the officials said.</p>
<p>The question whether to draw down oil from America's
strategic reserve has split Bush administration officials.
Some officials in the Energy, State and Defense departments
have pushed for at least token use of some of the oil to damp
market speculation about tight oil supplies, which is helping
push up oil prices. But officials in the Treasury Department,
and some in the White House, oppose using the reserve simply
to affect prices, and Mr. Bush himself seemed to suggest this
week that it should be tapped only to alleviate genuine
shortages, rather than to cool market speculation.</p>
<p>"I think that when you have a real shortage of a product
or you see an external event that is going to guarantee that
there be a shortage, then would be the time when you most
certainly should use the SPRO," Mr. Bush told a group of
reporters at the White House Monday. "It is my judgment that
there isn't such a shortage at this time."</p>
<p>But Mr. Bush also acknowledged that some people are
pushing him to authorize a symbolic tapping of some reserve
oil, or to allow a demonstration drawdown for psychological
purposes, and he said he is listening to those arguments.</p>
<p>A senior official said that the Bush administration isn't
convinced that a symbolic use of reserve oil would have much
impact, but he suggested that price as well as supply will be
a consideration as the U.S. sets its policy. The White House
intends "to keep a finger on the pulse" of the oil situation
and continue considering use of SPRO oil, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Saudi Arabia, U.S. and Saudi military
officers said there is new intelligence that Iraq's expanded
forces in Kuwait have dug into defense positions. Many Iraqi
aircraft and missile units, according to these officers,
recently have increased night training and switched radar and
communication frequencies -- moves apparently designed to
confuse the U.S. and prepare for defending against air
strikes at night.</p>
<p>In addition, U.S. officers said that many top-of-the-line
Iraqi fighters have been moved further away from the Saudi
border, apparently to protect them from U.S. bombardment and
give them more flexibility to respond if fighting erupts.</p>
<p>The comments by commanders on the ground, which follow the
Pentagon's announcement that Iraq now has some 360,000 troops
and 2,800 tanks in and near Kuwait, are among the most
pessimistic so far about the chances the crisis will be
resolved quickly.</p>
