	<p class="article-leader">Susan Lee is entitled to her opinion that anyone who
questions the performance of an unbridled free market is
"weird" and "benighted." But her review of my book
"Prosperity Lost" (Leisure & Arts, Aug. 27) went off the deep
end in labeling me an advocate of a "police state."
   Redistribution of income and limits on the accumulation of
wealth have been the official policy of the U.S. ever since
the creation of the income tax, inheritance taxes and the New
Deal social programs. The problem is that these measures have
traditionally been applied only half-heartedly, and during
the Reagan years they were decimated.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I thought conservatives had outgrown the practice of
mindlessly condemning critics of laissez faire as
totalitarian. Far from embracing Stalinism, my book was
inspired by the struggles of East Europeans against
repressive government power.</p>
<p>Yet, as many Poles, for example, are beginning to realize,
allowing the market completely free rein is not the most
effective way of restoring prosperity for all. Faced with
deregulatory disasters such as the savings-and-loan mess,
many Americans are coming to the same conclusion. The
solution to the economic problems of East and West will come
from innovative thinking, not rabid defense of old
ideologies.</p>
