	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Samuel Goldwyn Co., one of the few
remaining independent movie companies, offered to merge in a
stock swap with Heritage Entertainment Inc., a troubled owner
of theaters.
   The move, which is subject to execution of a definitive
agreement and approval by holders and boards of each company,
would allow the Goldwyn concern to become a public company.
Closely held, the company is controlled by Samuel Goldwyn
Jr., son of the late Samuel Goldwyn, one of Hollywood's early
moguls.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the proposed transaction, Heritage said it would
issue at least 90.8 million shares to Goldwyn's holders for
all of the Goldwyn company's stock.</p>
<p>Currently, Heritage has about 7.6 million common shares
outstanding. The transaction would leave Heritage
shareholders with an 8.5% stake in the combined company that
would keep the Samuel Goldwyn Co. name.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in composite trading on the American Stock
Exchange, Heritage shares closed at $1.375, up 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>Heritage shareholders also would receive Class A warrants,
giving them the right to purchase a total of 3.4 million
shares in the combined company at $2.20 each. The warrants
would be redeemable for 30 cents each. Heritage holders also
would receive Class B warrants, allowing them to buy 6.2
million shares at a 10% discount to the average trading price
over a 30-day period.</p>
<p>Samuel Goldwyn Co. has produced "Mystic Pizza" and has
distributed "Henry V," "Wild at Heart," and "Longtime
Companion." Recently, the company announced that it plans to
boost movie production to about five movies a year.</p>
<p>Heritage owns about 88 movie theaters in 10 states,
including California, Washington and Oregon, and a film
library. It also sells movies for television syndication and
produced the "Flipper" TV series that Goldwyn distributes.</p>
<p>Heritage posted a net loss of $4 million for fiscal 1990,
ended March 31, and the company has been seeking investors to
raise capital.</p>
<p>"The most popular way to go public is to buy some
languishing entity," said Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst at
Seidler Amdec Securities. "Goldwyn is a nice little company
with art-type films." However, he added: "No company has been
particularly successful at enhancing its movie division by
owning theaters."</p>
<p>Meyer Gottlieb, president and chief operating officer of
Goldwyn, said the transaction is part of a continuing plan to
"expand and diversify."</p>
