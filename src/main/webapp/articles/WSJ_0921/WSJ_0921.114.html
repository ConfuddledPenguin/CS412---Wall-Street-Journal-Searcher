	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The British government ordered antitrust probes
of two separate transactions planned by France's Thomson CSF
S.A. and Finland's Kemira Oy.
   The action holds up, at least temporarily, plans by
France-owned Thomson and British Aerospace PLC to merge their
guided-missile businesses. The merger, for which planning
began last year, would create one of the world's largest
missile makers, with annual sales of about #1.4 billion
($2.63 billion).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government also ordered an investigation into plans
for Kemira, a Finland-owned chemical company, to buy the
British nitrogenous fertilizer business of Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC. The transaction, announced in July and valued
at less than #100 million, would make Kemira the largest
fertilizer supplier in Britain.</p>
<p>The decision highlights how serious the ruling
Conservative Party is taking its recent vow to scrutinize
mergers involving foreign state-controlled companies.</p>
