	<p class="article-leader">Fraud in franchising and the sale of business
opportunities is on the rise, fueled in part by a faltering
economy, say prosecutors and federal regulators.
   In convention centers and exhibition halls across the
country, weekend franchise and business-opportunity shows woo
crowds of would-be entrepreneurs with everything from
frozen-yogurt stands to T-shirt print shops. And although
most of them are legitimate, a growing number are scams.
"We're seeing more and more of these cases," says Kent
Alexander, an assistant U.S. attorney in Atlanta.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Franchise fraud leaves in its wake broken dreams of
financial independence and -- as the spate of recent cases
shows -- threatens the loss of homes and life savings of the
unwary investor.</p>
<p>Rose Gregg found out first-hand. The 35-year-old single
mother from Cincinnati invested all of her modest savings two
years ago with American Legal Distributors, an Atlanta
concern that billed itself as a provider of prepaid legal
services. She saw the business -- marketing the company's
services in local shopping malls -- as work that would let
her spend more time with her son, who has cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>"They had the biggest booth at the show, surrounded by
legitimate franchises I recognized," she says. "I spent a
week in a training seminar. I talked to other people who said
they'd been successful. They even sent a bouquet of flowers
after I invested."</p>
<p>That was all she got. Ms. Gregg was one of 375 people
bilked out of more than $3 million by American Legal, with
individual losses ranging from Ms. Gregg's $5,500 nest egg to
more than $25,000, according to court documents. The scam's
organizer, Harold H. Pasley, was sentenced last month to 15
years in prison, while four "singers," people who were paid
to pose as successful franchisees, also received stiff
sentences. James C. Strayhorn, Mr. Pasley's attorney, says
his client disputes the charges and intends to pursue an
appeal of his sentence.</p>
<p>A franchise gone bad is an especially cruel way to lose
money, says Jerome Steiner of the Federal Trade Commission.
"People don't just lose the cash they put in," he says.
"They've also invested lots of hard work, their pride and
dreams into trying to build their own business."</p>
<p>Regulators say the number of potential victims of such
scams tends to rise as the economy sours. That's because
people who have been laid off or pushed into early retirement
often dream of owning their own business -- and have big
severance or benefit checks to invest, says R. Norman Cramer,
of the FTC's Denver office. As a result, "franchise fraud has
become a booming business for us over the last couple of
years," Mr. Cramer says.</p>
<p>The scams span a broad spectrum. In a 1989 San Francisco
case, a company calling itself T.B.A. Inc. sold
distributorships for in-home AIDS tests, promising an
enormous market and a potential return of $3,000 a week, all
for an initial investment of less than $200. "Protect
yourself and your loved ones by testing in the privacy of
your own home," newspaper advertisements said. And the
company assured its distributors that they would "never
actually touch a test kit, completely removing any
possibility of contamination."</p>
<p>That was one of the few truthful statements the company
made. The AIDS test was nothing more than a mail-order
questionnaire about life style. The firm was shut down and
ordered to repay investors. People named in the suit couldn't
be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Scams such as the AIDS-test business are called bust-outs.
"These people come into town, rent nice offices, take out ads
in the local paper, persuade people to invest in whatever
they're selling, and then they evaporate," says attorney
Sheldon Horowitz of the New York attorney general's office.
Many victims of franchise fraud never see their money again.</p>
<p>An exception was the pistol-packing investor who got his
$7,500 franchise fee back from American Safe Marketing, a
firm that fraudulently offered franchises for the sale of
fire extinguishers, the government charged in U.S. District
Court in Georgia last year. As FTC attorneys tell it, a
Colorado man who was convinced he had been conned flew to the
firm's Marietta, Ga., offices and walked a company officer to
the bank at gunpoint. "It was restitution, Western-style,"
says the FTC's Claude Wild. "We don't recommend it."</p>
<p>Nicholas Lotito, lawyer for Safe Marketing's two owners,
says his clients inherited problems from previous owners.
"They bought an ongoing business with a number of problems
they weren't aware of," he says, and they didn't profit by
it.</p>
<p>Fraud is less common among traditional franchisers who
convey a trademark to the franchisee, regulators say. Charges
of fraud against such established firms generally arise from
disputes over poor planning, markets that didn't materialize
or other adverse business conditions. The angry franchisee
"these days is a lot more likely to sue the minute there's a
problem," says Patrick Boroian, president of FranCorp, an
Olympia Fields, Ill., consultant.</p>
<p>McKleans Inc. was one such case. The Bethel, Conn.,
dry-cleaning franchiser didn't set out to defraud anyone, an
FTC investigator says. It "just couldn't deliver on its
promises." After a tangled battle with franchisees and
regulators, the company filed for bankruptcy protection. The
founders of McKleans couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Pat Burdo, who operates three McKleans stores in Monroe,
Conn., says the suits and the company's failure reflect the
difficulties of operating a franchise outlet. "This is a
hands-on business. I'm in here every morning at 7:30," Mr.
Burdo says. "Most of the people who got hurt were the
executive types who thought their franchise would run by
itself." He says some franchisees lost $50,000.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent increase in fraud cases, people in
the franchising industry maintain that the problem is far
less prevalent today than in the 1960s and early 1970s, "when
there were lots of classic suede-shoe, fly-by-night
operators," says John Reynolds, a spokesman for the
International Franchise Association of Washington.</p>
<p>Franchising has since entered the mainstream of American
business, with an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 franchisers doing
business through some 500,000 outlets, accounting for
one-third of all retail sales, the franchise association
says. And the numbers are growing.</p>
<p>"With the downsizing of corporate America, and the shift
to a service economy, thousands of former middle managers are
looking to get into business for themselves," Mr. Reynolds
says. "It's the great American dream. But if you're thinking
about buying a franchise, carefully investigate every claim
and get a lawyer before signing a contract."</p>
<p>Under federal rules, franchisers must provide detailed
financial data to back up sales claims, fully outline any
services to be provided by the franchiser, and disclose any
past legal entanglements, among other regulations.</p>
<p>Despite all the rules, Mr. Reynolds says, "you can't
legislate honesty." In franchising, as in any other business,
"there will always be those who are just out there trying to
rip people off."</p>
