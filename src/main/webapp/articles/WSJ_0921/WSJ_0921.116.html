	<p class="article-leader">SCEcorp said John E. Bryson was elected chairman and chief
executive officer of the utility holding company and its
operating unit, succeeding Howard Allen, who will retire from
those posts Oct. 1.
   The selection of Mr. Bryson, a one-time environmental
activist and former chairman of California's Public Utility
Commission, ends a two-way race for the top position at the
nation's second-largest investor-owned electric utility in
terms of customers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bryson's rival for the top slot, Michael R. Peevey,
was elected president of SCEcorp, a third title held by Mr.
Allen, who has dominated SCEcorp and its Southern California
Edison Co. unit for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Mr. Bryson, 47 years old, is currently executive vice
president and chief financial officer of SCEcorp. Mr. Peevey,
52, is also an executive vice president of the Rosemead,
Calif., concern.</p>
<p>The selection of Mr. Bryson was warmly received by
analysts. "I think it's a big plus for the company," said
Edward J. Tirello Jr., an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris
Upham Inc. Mr. Tirello said increasing competition in the
utility business as well as complicated environmental
pressures call for the broad background that Mr. Bryson will
bring to the position.</p>
<p>Mr. Bryson and Mr. Peevey have for much of the past five
years appeared an odd couple of prospective successors to Mr.
Allen, who is a forceful personality in political and
business circles in California and nationally in the
utilities business. Mr. Allen will remain chairman of
SCEcorp's executive committee and a director of both the
holding company and its utility unit -- suggesting that he
may continue to wield considerable power at SCEcorp.</p>
<p>Even as they were being groomed for the top position, Mr.
Bryson and Mr. Peevey shared only a little of the corporate
limelight with Mr. Allen. Both men were elected directors of
SCEcorp and the utility only yesterday. Their pictures
haven't appeared in the company's annual report since 1984.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the men were being given a succession of
responsibilities. And speculation was rampant at SCEcorp
about who would get the final nod. Mr. Bryson, a cerebral
lawyer, rarely made formal public appearances outside the
company and has looked after financial and legal matters
inside it. Mr. Peevey, a garrulous economist and former labor
lobbyist, has spearheaded SCEcorp's tough and very public
lobbying for acceptance of its plan to merge with neighboring
San Diego Gas & Electric Co. in a $2.8 billion stock swap.</p>
<p>SCEcorp is still fighting for approval of the merger,
which is being considered by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission and the California Public Utility Commission,
which are expected to rule before the end of the year. The
combined utility would supplant Pacific Gas & Electric Co. as
the nation's largest investor-owned utility in terms of
customers.</p>
<p>If allowed, the consolidation of the operations with San
Diego Gas will be the principal task facing SCEcorp's new
chairman and will take considerable attention.</p>
<p>But, as part of a wider strategy, the company under Mr.
Bryson is also likely to emphasize its burgeoning
non-regulated businesses, which include construction of
generating facilities that sell power to other utilities. In
an interview, Mr. Bryson noted that this effort has moved
overseas, with a massive project now under consideration to
build a one million-kilowatt generating station in Britain.</p>
<p>"We believe that our non-utility businesses . . . are a
very significant part of our own future," said Mr. Bryson,
who added that the industry "is dealing with an increasing
rate of change."</p>
<p>Mr. Bryson has a background at least as diverse as the
company he will head. Shortly after graduation from law
school, he was a founder of the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a national public-interest law group.</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, he was chairman of the California State
Water Resources Board. And from 1979 to 1982, he was
president of the California Public Utilities Commission,
where he is credited with revitalizing parts of the staff and
encouraging broader regulatory approaches.</p>
<p>Mr. Bryson was hired by Southern California Edison after a
two-year stint with a San Francisco law firm and became
senior vice president, law and finance. He was later made an
executive vice president and chief financial officer.
(Michael L. Noel, currently vice president and treasurer,
will assume the added title of chief financial officer Oct.
1.)</p>
