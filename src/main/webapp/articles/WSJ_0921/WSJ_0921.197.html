	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- CalFed Inc. said it will sell its annuity
and life insurance subsidiary to Conseco Inc., a Carmel,
Ind., insurance firm, for about $140.2 million.
   As a result of the sale, Calfed said it has established a
provision for a loss of about $40 million in the third
quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement, CalFed will sell Beneficial Standard
Life Incurance Company to Conseco in exchange for cash.
CalFed will purchase about $25 million of real estate and
other assets owned by Beneficial Standard. In addition, in
the three months after the sale, CalFed may choose to buy an
additional $35 million of other real estate assets that its
insurance unit acquired through foreclosure, as well as some
nonperforming and other mortgage loans.</p>
<p>About $12 million of the $40 million loss expected
involved tax liabilities incurred in the sale, a CalFed
spokesman said. The rest of the loss is the result of the
company's repurchase of some of Beneficial Standard's assets.</p>
<p>"There will definitely be an impact on earnings," the
spokesman said. CalFed will report its third-quarter earnings
in mid-October.</p>
<p>The sale is part of CalFed's two-year effort to
restructure its financial service business, selling
marginally profitable assets and jettisoning side ventures.
Since the summer of 1989, its principal subsidiary,
California Federal Bank, has sold its $125 million credit
card portfolio, and CalFed has sold off several insurance
units, a retirement-plan business and its interests in a
string of real estate properties.</p>
<p>Last year, Beneficial Standard had a loss of $5.3 million
on revenue of $150.4 million. In the first six months of
1990, it had earnings of $3.5 million. Beneficial Standard
had $1.8 billion in assets as of June 30, 1990.</p>

subsidiary, Beneficial Standard Life Insurance Co., to
Conseco Inc., CalFed may purchase back from Beneficial $35
million of real estate assets acquired through foreclosure,
as well as some nonperforming and other mortgage loans within
three years. The period of time was misstated in Friday's
edition.</p>
