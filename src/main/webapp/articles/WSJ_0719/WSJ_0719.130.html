	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The roller coaster ride in the hog market
continued as prices of most futures contracts went into a
jowl-flapping tailspin.
   With meatpackers bidding up prices for mature hogs to near
the record levels set in May, some futures traders decided to
take profits and not press their luck any further.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange yesterday
the hog contract for August delivery dropped 0.87 cent a
pound to settle at 59.72 cents a pound.</p>
<p>The price of the August futures contract for pork bellies,
which are used to make bacon, sank its daily permissible
limit of two cents a pound to settle at 46.42 cents a pound.</p>
<p>Hog prices have been whipsawed for several months.</p>
<p>Because of a tight supply of mature hogs, the nation's
slaughter is running about 6% behind last year's pace. That
is creating fierce competition among meatpackers for hogs.</p>
<p>On Monday, for example, prices of several hog futures
contracts jumped their daily permissible limit of 1.5 cents a
pound because of a sudden hog shortage.</p>
<p>Those high prices have also pushed up the consumer price
of pork to record levels. As a result, any sign of consumer
resistance to high retail prices can trigger a wild plunge in
futures prices.</p>
<p>"We are waffling between supply bulls and demand bears,"
said Charles Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton,
Chicago.</p>
<p>What triggered yesterday's sudden disinflationary
sentiment isn't clear. The consumption of refrigerated pork
bellies is running above analysts' estimates. That usually
would support prices.</p>
<p>There were widespread rumors yesterday, however, that one
major pork belly supplier suddenly lowered its price by two
cents a pound -- igniting speculation that demand for pork is
wavering.</p>
<p>Because the pork belly market is so thinly traded, the
move by just one concern can shift prices. Analysts are
divided, however, over the impact of that price cut on the
market.</p>
<p>Cattle futures prices rose.</p>
<p>After the close of trading tomorrow traders expect the
Agriculture Department to report that the number of young
cattle placed on feedlots in seven major ranch states in June
rose 2.5% from June 1989.</p>
<p>Feedlots fatten cattle for slaughter. Usually a rise in
placements signals that the supply of fattened cattle will
increase several months into the future, thus damping the
price that meatpackers will pay then.</p>
<p>Opinion is mixed, however, over whether cattle prices will
begin to retreat significantly anytime soon from their high
levels. During part of the trading session yesterday, the
cattle contract for August delivery touched a
life-of-contract high of 76.30 cents a pound.</p>
<p>Among other things, the Agriculture Department is also
expected to report that placements onto feedlots during the
entire second quarter in 13 states trailed last year's
levels.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>ENERGY: Petroleum futures closed mixed on little news.
Although oil inventories still are high, expectations that
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will curb
its overproduction as a result of next week's midyear meeting
kept a support for prices. Also, Iraq again figured
prominently in world oil markets on an unsubstantiated rumor
that it is massing troops on the Kuwait border. Energy
futures brokers have been trying to peddle that rumor for
several days. But there were few takers until yesterday when
it resurfaced after Iraq's foreign minister accused Kuwait of
violating the Iraqi border and stealing oil valued at $2.4
billion. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have been the
chief targets of Iraqi complaints about OPEC quota cheaters.
Yesterday's charges followed Tuesday's statement by President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq that he would deal forcefully with
overproducers in OPEC unless they mended their ways. But both
Kuwait and the UAE already had pledged they will reduce
output. So most traders were puzzled by the Iraqi troops
rumor and discounted it. Still, oil futures surged, if only
briefly, on London's International Petroleum Exchange and the
New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures price for the
International Petroleum Exchange's September Brent crude
contract closed 16 cents higher at $18.35 a barrel. In U.S.
futures trading, the September crude contract settled at
$19.61 a barrel, down 16 cents, after nudging $20 during the
day. August crude was down 10 cents at $18.55.</p>
<p>ORANGE JUICE: The July contract swung widely on its last
day of trading because a large number of outstanding
contracts remained to be nullified or fulfilled; but it ended
barely changed. The most active contract, September, eased.
July traded from a low of $1.81 to a high of $1.88 before
expiring at noon EDT 0.10 cent a pound lower at $1.8685.
September declined 2.55 cents a pound to $1.7585. The July
contract showed early strength as traders who didn't want to
take delivery of the concentrate hung on for a while before
liquidating their positions, an analyst said. As the July
price dropped, processors bought contracts. Processors have
been active buyers of contracts, with the intention of taking
delivery of concentrate because futures prices are well below
cash market quotes of $2 to $2.05 a pound, the analyst said.
Trading turned thin as expiration neared; at one point, the
price jumped more than three cents a pound from one trade to
the next. Overall, the analyst said, "It was a reasonably
orderly expiration. The fact that July ended 11 cents {a
pound} over September was a positive development that could
help provide September with further support."</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices were mixed. Silver was
strong and platinum edged higher, but gold couldn't sustain
early gains and ended lower. September silver advanced 6.7
cents an ounce to $4.935. October platinum was up 30 cents an
ounce to $479.60. August gold ended with a loss of 50 cents
an ounce at $362.50 after trading as high as $363.90.
Yesterday's advance in silver was a continuation of the
recovery in the metal Tuesday after the September price
dropped to its previously set life-of-contract low of $4.81.
The contract Tuesday recovered most of its sharp loss and
yesterday tacked on further gains as traders, particularly
speculators, were attracted by the market's strong
performance. According to Peter Cardillo, director of
commodity research for Jesup, Josephthal Inc., of New York, a
slight change has taken place in fundamentals that has
contributed some support to the market. "Some smaller silver
mines in the U.S. and Canada have suspended production
because of low prices," he said. "It isn't a major
development, but it has injected a more positive note in the
market." If silver continues to attract demand, Mr. Cardillo
said, there is a possibility that the September contract's
price could top $5 and possibly trade as high as $5.25.</p>
