	<p class="article-leader">A congressional panel charged that a Justice Department
decision not to pursue civil charges against Northrop Corp.
for alleged B-2 Stealth bomber mischarges stemmed from a
finding that "the Air Force was fully aware that Northrop's
reports were false" but did nothing about it.
   Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House
subcommittee on oversight and investigations, asserted in a
letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that the Air Force
"abandoned its fiduciary responsibilities to protect the
interests of the taxpayers while making the single largest
investment in a weapons system in this country's history."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, Northrop confirmed it lost a South Korean
arbitrator's decision in a dispute over a $6,250,000 payment
it made to some Seoul businessmen. The company said it will
appeal the decision by the Korean Commercial Arbitration
Board. Northrop, which said it's pursuing other attempts to
recover the money, insists the money was earmarked for a
hotel venture and that the company was bilked out of all of
it.</p>
<p>Mr. Dingell's investigators and two federal grand juries,
though, are trying to determine whether Northrop executives
instead intended the money as a bribe so that Korean
officials would buy F-20 jet fighters, in violation of the
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The company and its
executives, including Chairman Thomas V. Jones, deny any
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Both the B-2 and F-20 controversies are sure to surface
during a Dingell subcommittee hearing, possibly this month,
into Northrop's business activities.</p>
<p>Citing a 1988 memorandum prepared by Howard Daniels, civil
division chief of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles,
Mr. Dingell noted that the Justice Department concluded that
Northrop "did, in fact, present inaccurate cost and
scheduling data . . . and earned-value estimates" on the
Stealth bomber project. The Daniels memo called Northrop's
scheduling system "essentially a farce."</p>
<p>Mr. Dingell's staff said the government attorney's memo,
still unreleased by the Justice Department, didn't allege the
amount of the overcharging. A private lawsuit brought by
several former employees contends the fraud totaled more than
$20 billion.</p>
<p>A Northrop spokesman in Los Angeles and an Air Force
spokesman both declined to comment; Mr. Daniels couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>The allegations of B-2 mischarges first were raised two
years ago by some former Northrop managers and auditors.
Under the federal False Claims Act, the U.S. reviews
whistle-blower cases to decide if it wants to join as a
co-plaintiff.</p>
<p>"Just because the government knows of fraud does not
eliminate its obligation to take action against it," said
Herbert Hafif, a Claremont, Calif., attorney representing the
whistle-blowers.</p>
<p>In his letter, Mr. Dingell asked Mr. Cheney to "convene a
court of inquiry" analyzing the Justice Department findings.</p>
<p>The Daniels memo, according to the congressman, said that
while some whistle-blower allegations were essentially
accurate, "the Air Force has known of these facts for some
time but has chosen to take no remedial action." The memo
said: "Accordingly, there is no provable fraud because there
is no detrimental reliance on false representations."</p>
<p>Noting that the memo claimed only two government auditors
were checking on the B-2 through the early 1980s, Mr. Dingell
fumed: "That breaks down to about $10 billion per auditor.
Using that ratio, we could oversee the entire $300 billion
defense budget with 30 auditors." He called the situation
"nothing short of criminally negligent," adding that the memo
suggests "a conspiracy between the Air Force and Northrop to
mislead" the defense secretary and Congress on a "pet
program" carrying a $65 billion-plus price tag. He called the
concerns "cause enough to terminate this program."</p>
