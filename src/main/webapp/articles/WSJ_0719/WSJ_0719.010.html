	<p class="article-leader">LONG GROVE, Ill. -- Kemper Corp. said its board approved a
stockholder rights plan, designed to deter unfair takeover
practices and protect its "long-range strategic plans"
against disruption.
   The insurance and investment services concern said it is
not aware of any takeover activity directed toward it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the plan, shareholders will, on July 30, be issued
rights which, under certain takeover circumstances, allow the
holder to buy stock in the company at half price.</p>
