	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Chrysler Corp. expects to end 1990 with
negative cash flow for the second straight year because
earnings from its sagging sales aren't covering its heavy
spending for badly needed new products.
   Robert A. Lutz, president of the company's Chrysler Motors
unit, said that the No. 3 U.S. auto maker will likely have
"slightly negative cash flow this year," which will turn into
break-even cash flow in 1991. He didn't give specific
figures, but industry analysts said Chrysler could see its
consolidated cash flow fall as much as $1 billion this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chrysler managed to alleviate much of the pressure on its
cash situation earlier this year. A sale and lease-back deal
on its Auburn Hills, Mich., technical center -- which is
still under construction -- raised $1.1 billion for this
year. And the sale of its Gulfstream Aerospace unit added
more than $800 million.</p>
<p>Chrysler common closed yesterday at $16, down 62.5 cents,
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>A big reason for Chrysler's negative cash flow this year
is its plan to spend $3.1 billion on new products and other
capital improvements. The spending is part of the company's
goal of spending $15.6 billion through 1994 to revamp its
vehicle lineup and improve facilities.</p>
<p>While spending has increased significantly, weak sales are
driving down the company's earnings. Through the end of June,
Chrysler's domestic new-car sales were off 15% from a year
ago, while its domestic new-truck sales fell 13%.</p>
<p>Analysts are forecasting Chrysler will report
second-quarter earnings of $138 million to $185 million, or
60 cents to 85 cents a share. In the 1989 second quarter,
Chrysler had net income of $341 million, or $1.46 a share.</p>
