	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Here in a downtown Manhattan hotel ballroom in
midsummer the fans of television's "Dark Shadows" stand out.
They're the people with the winter-pale faces of TV's true
and faithful followers. Some 1,500 strong, they have come
from 35 states for a weekend of reruns and reminiscence.
   Show-biz promotional hype can't buy loyalty like this.
"Dark Shadows," a Gothic afternoon soap opera featuring
vampires and time travel, went off network TV in 1971. It
reappeared sporadically in syndication and is now available
only on videotape. For its ardent fans, nothing on TV before
or since can rival it. "It's all we watch at night," says
Marianne Johanson, of New Jersey. She and her husband Carl,
an engineer, own cassettes of 100 of the 1,225 "Dark Shadows"
episodes extant on tape and are adding to their collection.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Dark Shadows" fans belong to a relatively new kind of fan
club, devoted to a TV series rather than a single performer.
Another in this genre is the 7,000-member Andy Griffith Show
Appreciation Society.</p>
<p>Griffith Society President John Meroney, a 20-year-old
student at Wake Forest University, says he "cannot ever
remember not watching the program," which aired on CBS during
the 1960s and is now in syndication. Mr. Meroney, who claims
to have seen each of the 249 episodes 30 or 40 times, says
the show's small-town setting and homespun values give it a
"never-never-land quality. It represents Camelot . . . a
`Brigadoon.'"</p>
<p>The Griffith Society's bimonthly newsletter rails against
the excision of precious seconds from beloved episodes to
squeeze in more commercials. It also has covered the
continuing saga of member Bill Flynn and his prickly
relationship with North Carolina law enforcement. Police take
a dim view of his attempts to tool around town in a replica
of the 1963 Ford Galaxie squad car featured on the series.
Nor do they approve of his sheriff's uniform -- a copy of a
costume Andy Griffith wore.</p>
<p>Fan clubs are ephemeral; they come and they go. Some 350
currently are registered with the National Association of Fan
Clubs, whose president is Blanche Trinajstick of Pueblo,
Colo. The association has tried to improve the image of fan
clubs, which Mrs. Trinajstick says "was so bad for so long."
The "groupie factor" has unfairly stigmatized fan clubs and
alienated celebrities, she says.</p>
<p>No one who has flirted even fleetingly with fame can be
sure of avoiding canonization by a fan club. There is even a
club dedicated to Lawrence Welk's "Champagne Lady," Norma
Zimmer. Princess Kitty has a fan club, too.</p>
<p>She is a brown and white cat in Miami who played Ernest
Hemingway's cat in a TV miniseries and has made personal
appearances in hospitals and charity shows. She can play
"Three Blind Mice" on the piano and slam-dunk a small
basketball. Club President Moura Wrinkle, who works in
pest-control research, says most of Princess Kitty's 70 other
card-carrying fans are children. But she, too, is smitten:
"As many shows as I've seen, I'm still in awe," she says.</p>
<p>In contrast to most of the entertainment world,
country-music stars, many of whom profess the common touch,
are often chummy with their fans. "You can't hire people to
do the kind of PR fans will do for free," says Loudilla
Johnson, who with her sisters, Loretta and Kay, founded the
Loretta Lynn Fan Club in 1963. "If you want to be reclusive,
fine, go home and close the door. Country-music stars know
they won't make it if that's their attitude."</p>
<p>The Johnson sisters, who live on a 2,500-acre farm in Wild
Horse, Colo., met Loretta Lynn in 1960, when she was still an
unknown crisscrossing the heartland by car to plug her
records at radio stations. The singer encouraged them to form
a fan club, which has since grown to 5,000 members. The
sisters publish a quarterly newsletter, always containing a
chatty letter from Loretta, her performance schedule, fan
queries ("Can Loretta take a tease?" "What kind of shampoo
does she use?") and merchandise offerings such as Loretta
Lynn sweatpants and coffee mugs.</p>
<p>Yet for all the frenetic activity of these groups, their
influence on entertainment careers has become marginal.</p>
<p>There are some notable exceptions. In 1983, fan-club
pressure rescued the TV series "Cagney & Lacey" after it was
canceled by CBS. The hoards of "Star Trek" followers had
clout too. And singers Barry Manilow, Engelbert Humperdinck
and Tom Jones were helped in their blockbuster careers by
knowing how to court their fans, who network through scores
of local chapters bearing names like "Tom's Vegas Luvs,"
"Manilovers Anonymous" and "Hump's Happy Hoosiers."</p>
<p>For the most part, however, ratings and box-office grosses
speak far more eloquently to entertainment decision makers.
The days are long past when movie studios instigated fan
clubs and ordered contract-bound stars to cooperate with
them. Many entertainers have come to view their most
obsessive fans as nuisances or worse.</p>
<p>Show-business ambivalence toward fans has failed to
discourage them. In kitchens and basements across the land,
their printers and copying machines spew out news of the
stars' comings and goings in exhaustive detail. However
unrequited, it is a labor of love -- a love that is sometimes
volatile.</p>
<p>Last year, a deranged fan killed actress Rebecca
Schaeffer. Recent targets of harassment by fans have included
Vanna White, Teri Garr, Michael J. Fox and Sharon Gless.
"Idolizing heros is normal," says Gavin de Becker, a security
consultant to many Hollywood entertainers who has researched
fan behavior in the media age. "But what is usually a mild
drug is a poison for some people."</p>
<p>Television's intrusion into living rooms and bedrooms
distorts the ordinary barrier between performer and audience,
Mr. de Becker theorizes. A false intimacy develops, in which,
he says, "we believe we really know Johnny Carson -- who in
fact we don't know." Disturbed people who have difficulty
distinguishing between fact and fantasy are especially
vulnerable to the illusion, he adds.</p>
<p>Fans have tender sensibilities. At the "Dark Shadows"
festival, a vendor and disillusioned fan is miffed that
series star Jonathan Frid, who played the vampire Barnabas
Collins, will make only a brief appearance. "It's
disgraceful," she says. "These fans can recite every episode
verbatim -- this is their life. To see them mistreated I find
upsetting." Festival officials say the actor had a
conflicting out-of-town performance commitment.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, stars enjoyed a simpler relationship
with their fans. Leatrice Gilbert Fountain, daughter of two
early movie stars, screen idol John Gilbert and actress
Leatrice Joy, recollects the adulation as she sips a cup of
coffee in her Greenwich, Conn., home. Her father, an
on-screen and off-screen lover of Greta Garbo, always wrote
"Gratefully yours" with his autograph. She says her mother
employed a team of secretaries who wrote handwritten replies
to the thousands of fan letters she got each week. One fan
became a lifelong friend.</p>
<p>Miss Joy even bestowed tiny golden medals on infant girls
who were named after her. The medals were inscribed, "To
Leatrice Joy from Leatrice Joy."</p>
<p>Mrs. Fountain, co-author of a biography of her father,
stays in touch with the 85-member Friends of Jack Gilbert fan
club, revived in 1986 by Alice D. Johnson, a 77-year-old
Philadelphian. Says Ms. Johnson of the actor: "I've loved him
all my life."</p>
