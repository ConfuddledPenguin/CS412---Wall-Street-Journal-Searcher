	<p class="article-leader">Apple Computer Inc., continuing to post healthy financial
results despite concerns that it has a weak mix of products,
reported a 25% rise in profit for its third fiscal quarter
ended June 19.
   Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., said net income rose to
$119.8 million from $96.1 million the year earlier. Per-share
net rose 30% to 96 cents from 74 cents a year earlier on a
greater number of shares outstanding. Revenue grew 9.3% to
$1.36 billion from $1.25 billion the year before.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, Apple warned that results for its current quarter
may not equal those of a year ago because of high spending on
products being developed.</p>
<p>In the fall, the company is expected to revamp the low end
of its Macintosh computer line with at least two new models
that sport lower prices and higher performance than current
ones. Analysts fear that Apple's demand may soften somewhat
as the introduction of these products, tentatively set for
October, nears.</p>
<p>The third-quarter results, released after the market
closed yesterday, were generally in line with expectations.
In a statement, John Sculley, Apple's chief executive
officer, attributed the results to strong demand for its
higher-end Macintosh computers and to price cuts that have
spurred demand for low-end Macintoshes.</p>
