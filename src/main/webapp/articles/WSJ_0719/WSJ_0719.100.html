	<p class="article-leader">Graphic Scanning Corp. said its directors decided to seek
an "alliance" with a "strategic partner or partners" to
develop new businesses and generate new capital.
   Based in Englewood, N.J., Graphic Scanning Corp., which is
involved in paging, cellular telephone and wireless cable
operations, has faltered in previous efforts to improve its
financial position. Discussions to sell a controlling
interest in its Digital Mobile Communications Ltd. business,
a U.K. telecommunications company, collapsed last year, as
did talks of a possible merger with McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said its directors had determined that
developing its telecommunications businesses is "beyond the
scope" of its current resources. Termination of the Digital
Mobile sales discussions "creates immediate capital needs,"
the company added.</p>
<p>It said it also is looking at other alternatives to raise
capital, including selling securities or assets or entering
into other joint ventures.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended March 31, Graphic Scanning had a
net loss of $38.5 million, or $1.19 a share, on revenue of
$71.1 million.</p>
