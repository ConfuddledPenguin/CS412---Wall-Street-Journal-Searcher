	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court ruled that an
employer can't offer workers early-retirement packages
without the permission of their union.
   The decision, involving the Toledo Blade Co., could pose a
major roadblock for employers seeking to offer lump sums or
other inducements for senior workers to retire early when
those employers can't gain a union's acquiescence in
collective bargaining. Such early-retirement packages have
become commonplace lately.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ruling also may affect situations in which companies
try to go around unions in dealing with workers on other
matters, as more employers have been trying to do.</p>
<p>The appeals court here ruled that the Toledo Blade
illegally declared it had the right to "buy out" employees'
lifetime job guarantees after negotiations with Local 63 of
the typographical union had failed in 1982. The dispute
centered on the company's effort to retain in the labor
contract a clause allowing such "direct dealing" with
employees. The court sent the case back to the National Labor
Relations Board, which had ruled in favor of the newspaper
company.</p>
<p>Writing for the basically conservative three-judge panel,
Judge Douglas Ginsburg said the Blade's position is
"fundamentally inconsistent" with the system of collective
bargaining established by the National Labor Relations Act.
By negotiating directly with employees to try to buy out job
guarantees at the lowest cost, "the Employer could
effectively put the employees into competition with each
other to sell out at the lowest price," Judge Ginsburg said.</p>
<p>This "not only displaces the union from its
representational role, it also gives the Employer the
opportunity to destroy the cohesiveness of the Union's
membership," Judge Ginsburg said.</p>
<p>Elliott Bredhoff, a union-oriented labor lawyer, called
the decision "a rather strong reaffirmation of the importance
of the unions' role in collective bargaining," with a
conservative panel disagreeing with the NLRB over "one of the
most fundamental rights" spelled out in the labor act.</p>
<p>The court said that a similar NLRB case is pending before
the U.S. appeals court in Denver. In that case, the board had
ruled that Colorado-Ute Electric Association, an electrical
cooperative, lawfully bargained to an impasse with the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers over the
co-op's right to offer merit raises directly to employees.
The NLRB also ruled, however, that the employer illegally
tried to put the plan into effect without negotiating with
the IBEW over the amount and timing of the merit raises.</p>
<p>Still other cases involving employer attempts to
circumvent a union after reaching an impasse, such as one
involving subcontracting, are pending before the board. In
light of the court ruling, "we're going to have to reconsider
how we treat all these types of cases," said Jerry Hunter,
the NLRB's general counsel.</p>
<p>Under the law, when employers and unions bargain to an
impasse over contract matters such as wages, benefits and
working rules, the employer may then seek to put its contract
offer into effect and the union may strike. But in the
appeals court's view, the employer's insistence on dealing
directly with workers over retirement changes isn't such an
issue. The employer must gain union permission before taking
such action, the court said.</p>
<p>In 1976 and 1979, the Blade's union had agreed that the
newspaper could negotiate directly with individual employees
over the buy-out of the job guarantees that it, like many
newspaper publishers, had previously given as the price of
introducing labor-saving technology. But in 1982, the parties
reached an impasse over inclusion of that same clause in a
new contract.</p>
<p>The union charged the Blade with refusing to bargain in
good faith. The NLRB dismissed the complaint, holding that
the employer could bargain to an impasse and then have the
right to continue dealing directly with employees in making
early-retirement offers.</p>
