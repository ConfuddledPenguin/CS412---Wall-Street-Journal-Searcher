	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The leveraged buy-out firm Clayton & Dubilier
is negotiating a possible $2.5 billion to $3 billion buy-out
of International Business Machines Corp.'s typewriter,
keyboard and other low-end operations, according to industry
and financial executives.
   If completed, the acquisition would be the largest ever
for the New York-based partnership. An IBM deal also would be
consistent with some of Clayton & Dubilier's previous
acquisitions, which included low-technology units shed by
Harris Corp. and Unisys Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that IBM was
looking at a $3 billion divestiture of its low-tech
businesses. In a statement yesterday, IBM said it is
"considering many options as it moves to sharpen its
strategic focus," but the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant didn't
comment directly on the newspaper story. IBM did say, though,
that it "hasn't concluded any transaction."</p>
<p>IBM also said any action "would ensure that our employees
are treated fairly, that service to our customers is
uninterrupted and that the transaction is in the best
economic interest of our company."</p>
<p>Financial executives also said Clayton & Dubilier may have
lined up an equity partner to share in the acquisition.
Clayton & Dubilier reportedly sounded out General Electric
Capital Corp., a unit of General Electric Co., about buying
some subordinated debt to help finance the transaction. GE
Capital declined to comment.</p>
<p>Several bankers said Clayton & Dubilier's longtime lead
bank, Manufacturers Hanover Corp., is likely to organize bank
loans for an IBM deal. The bankers cautioned that they hadn't
yet seen Clayton & Dubilier's exact financing terms.
Officials at Manufacturers didn't return phone calls.</p>
<p>People familiar with Clayton & Dubilier said they expect
the firm will strive to meet IBM's concerns. Recent Clayton &
Dubilier acquisitions have let management and employees buy a
stake of about 25% in the post-buy-out company. Clayton &
Dubilier "has made an effort to put equity ownership in the
broadest hands," an adviser to the buy-out firm said.</p>
<p>Clayton & Dubilier also has tried to assure IBM that its
acquisitions generally don't involve the big asset sales and
job cuts that have soured the public image of buy-outs.
Instead, Clayton & Dubilier, led by its chairman, former
McKinsey & Co. consultant Martin Dubilier, has portrayed
itself as a team of hands-on operating specialists, with
ideas on improving everything from a company's distribution
system to its inventory control.</p>
<p>To date, Clayton & Dubilier's largest acquisition has been
the $1.16 billion purchase of Uniroyal Inc. in 1985.
Recently, however, Clayton & Dubilier has taken steps to
increase its buying power. It raised a $1 billion equity fund
last year from pension funds and other institutional
investors, triple the size of its previous fund. At the time,
Clayton & Dubilier said it wanted to "participate in
transactions . . . above the $1 billion level."</p>
<p>Several bankers said Clayton & Dubilier's longtime lead

Financial executives also said Clayton & Dubilier is in talks
with General Electric Capital Corp., a unit of General
Electric Co., which is considering buying some subordinated
debt to help finance the transaction. Officials at
Manufacturers didn't return phone calls; General Electric
Capital declined comment.</p>
<p>The indicated purchase price of $2.5 billion to $3 billion
would appear to include other operations besides typewriters,
keyboards and printers. Although IBM doesn't break out
results by individual product lines, its world-wide sales of
typewriters, keyboards and low-end printers are estimated at
less than $2 billion. Given the relatively low margins on
those businesses, any purchase price would presumably come to
less than the annual revenue.</p>
<p>IBM spent $350 million in the early 1980s to modernize and
automate its facility in Lexington, Ky., where more than
4,000 employees build the products that are up for sale. But
it has apparently decided that it can't build the products as
efficiently as competitors can.</p>
<p>IBM has been re-evaluating what businesses are central to
its strategy and has been selling some marginal assets. With
pressure from competitors unabating, IBM has aggressively cut
costs, to the point of taking a $2.4 billion write-off in
last year's fourth quarter to cover the costs of cutting
10,000 jobs and consolidating some plants.</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
IBM shares closed at $119.875, down 87.5 cents.</p>
