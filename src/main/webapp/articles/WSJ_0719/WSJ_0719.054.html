	<p class="article-leader">OSAKA -- Can a Japanese farm-equipment maker harvest
riches in Silicon Valley? Kubota Corp. hopes so. Since 1986,
the maker of tractors and iron pipes has plowed $158.1
million into eight U.S. technology companies. The portfolio
includes minority stakes in such firms as Mips Computer
Systems Inc., one of the most successful new microprocessor
companies, and Mycogen Corp., a developer of microbial
pesticides.
   Many old-line Japanese industrial companies in recent
years have bought into technologies that hold the promise of
greater growth. Steelmakers, cement producers and textile
manufacturers are working on everything from computer chips
to optical fibers. But few have moved as broadly or briskly
as Kubota, a company that started out 100 years ago making
cast iron for machinery used in Japan's headlong rush toward
industrialization.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With the company about to embark on its second century,
"our conventional business fields' future growth was not good
enough," explains Masahiro Yoshida, a managing director and
chief strategist of the company's diversification into high
technology.</p>
<p>So, instead of relying on rice harvesters and water pipes
to keep sales growing, the company decided to learn to make
the computers that increasingly are used to design such
equipment.</p>
<p>With its mature businesses throwing off cash and its
extensive Japanese landholdings and securities providing a
massive asset base, the company went shopping for promising
talent in the U.S. "In Japan, it's much more difficult to
hire people who have such knowledge," Mr. Yoshida says.</p>
<p>Kubota's high-tech push hit a snag late last week. Two
founders of a company that eventually became Stardent
Computer Inc. alleged that Kubota -- which owns 22% of the
mini-supercomputer company -- conspired to fraudulently
obtain the American company's technology and transfer it to a
wholly owned Kubota subsidiary. The executives, Allen Michels
and Matthew Sanders, sued for $25 million in damages.</p>
<p>Kubota executives deny the charges, and contend their
support has kept the struggling computer company on its feet.
Mr. Yoshida claims the two Stardent executives "are trying to
cover their failure in business and blame it on somebody
else."</p>
<p>Messrs. Michels and Sanders, aren't involved in daily
operations of Stardent. In Newton, Mass., Stardent's
president and chief executive, John William Poduska, said
"our relationship {with Kubota} has been and continues to be
excellent. . . . We have no knowledge of any facts that would
give rise to the basis of a legal claim." A spokeswoman said
that directors will discuss the suit and the role of Messrs.
Michels and Sanders with the company at a directors meeting
today.</p>
<p>Stardent was created last fall when Ardent Computer Corp.,
a Sunnyvale, Calif., firm founded by Messrs. Michels and
Sanders and funded largely by Kubota, was merged with Stellar
Computer Inc. a Newton,. Mass., company started by Mr.
Poduska. Both companies had been started at the same time to
make graphics supercomputers, and the competition between the
two was so ruthless that both lost money freely.</p>
<p>Whatever the truth, the dispute is an indication of the
difficulty in meshing an oldline industrial company --
especially one from a country where corporate loyalty is
considered a paramount virtue -- with the often brash,
freewheeling cultures of U.S. high-tech ventures. "We have to
concede," says Mr. Yoshida, that Kubota's initial assessment
of Stardent's "business plan and the people responsible for
carrying out the business . . . was incorrect."</p>
<p>But Kubota isn't about to stop sowing capital overeas.
And, despite worries in some quarters that U.S. companies are
selling too much technology to potential foreign competitors,
capital-starved American companies aren't about to stop
accepting help. Indeed, Kubota also made news earlier this
week with an investment more in line with its traditional
operations. The Japanese manufacturer joined Ford Motor Co.
and Tenneco Inc. of the U.S. in agreeing to buy a 27% stake
in Cummins Engine Co., a Columbus, Ind., maker of engines for
trucks and tractors. Kubota's stake would come to 5.4%,
valued at $50 million.</p>
<p>The Cummins tie-up illustrates how companies increasingly
are turning to so-called global alliances to strengthen their
presence in overseas markets. Kubota, which has had a
business relationship with a Cummins subsidiary in the U.S.
for several years, was approached by Cummins in May 1989,
according to Yutaka Murata, an executive in Kubota's engine
division.</p>
<p>The proposed tie-up closely resembled so-called stable
shareholder relationships among Japanese concerns. It was
attractive to Kubota because of Cummins' extensive business
network in Europe, where Kubota hopes to strengthen its
presence before the market is unified in 1992. The two
companies already are looking into joint manufacturing of
15-to-100 horsepower diesel engines in the United Kingdom or
in Spain, partly to supply the tractors Kubota now builds in
Spain and the small construction equipment it makes in West
Germany, according to Mr. Murata.</p>
<p>Despite the attention attracted by Kubota's high-tech
foray, its less-glamorous industrial lines continue to
account for the vast bulk of its revenue and its earnings. On
a consolidated basis, Kubota's revenue rose to 839 billion
yen (about $5.67 billion) for its fiscal year that ended
March 31, from 736.8 billion a year earlier. Net income,
meanwhile, fell to 7.6 billion yen from 18.4 billion yen --
partly because of costs associated with its U.S. investments.</p>
<p>Kubota's computer subsidiary outside of Tokyo, which
builds graphics supercomputers designed by Stardent and
minicomputers for Mips, hopes this year to double the 7
billion yen in revenue achieved last year. The unit,
established in 1987, also aims to turn a profit for the first
time this year, according to a Kubota spokesman. The company
says it hopes to increase total revenue from high-technology
businesses to 10% to 15% of overall revenue by the year 2000,
from less than 5% now.</p>
<p>In the near future, securities analysts say, Kubota is
likely to reap more benefits from increased spending on
Japan's infrastructure, which lags well behind that of most
developed countries. The company is a major supplier of pipes
for waterworks and sewage systems. And its 4.95 million
square meters in landholdings includes a large tract in Osaka
that is scheduled for redevelopment in connection with the
new Kansai airport.</p>
<p>But Kubota is determined to remake its image as it heads
into its second century. The company in April shortened its
Japanese name to K.K. Kubota from Kubota Iron Works K.K., and
hired a New York firm to design a new logo -- in Roman
letters.</p>
