	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For 20 years, Barbara Ann Kipfer kept a list
of things that make her happy. Each year for 10 years, she
mailed it to Peter Workman, the founder and owner of Workman
Publishing. "I just knew it was a Workman book," says Ms.
Kipfer, who makes her living writing dictionaries in
Connecticut. "They do books that are offbeat but classy."
   Last year, Mr. Workman told Ms. Kipfer he was skeptical
about turning her 22,000 favorite things into a book but
wanted to try. The list was shortened, the title was changed
from "The Happy Book" to "14,000 things to be happy about,"
and the book was packaged in a small, chunky size with a
clever cover.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some readers might quarrel with flannel sheets, the word
"boo" or other specific entries, but "14,000 things" was on
the Publishers Weekly paperback best-seller list for five
weeks, and it has sold well over 100,000 copies. It's
building the kind of gentle cult following that proves it's a
Workman book after all.</p>
<p>Over the past 22 years, Workman has developed a reputation
for books that are clever, quirky and distinctively designed.
Most are high-quality paperbacks priced below most comparable
competing books, and they tend to be cookbooks, humor books,
calendars or children's books. Workman has also pioneered in
merchandising non-book items in bookstores and books in
non-bookstores.</p>
<p>"Unlike almost any other publisher, you can look at a book
and say, `That's a Workman,'" says Judith Riven, an executive
editor at Hearst Corp.'s Avon Books. "They are smart and
original and catch trends before anybody else. French bistros
are all the rage now, but Workman already has a bistro
cookbook out there."</p>
<p>Workman books are so "endearing and intriguing that they
almost compel you to give them special display," adds Michael
Brownstein, manager of the Atticus Bookstore Cafe in New
Haven, Conn.</p>
<p>What sets a Workman book apart isn't just subject and
design but also the way it's published.</p>
<p>"Workman is my first choice of all the publishers in
America, provided I'm selling their kind of book," says
literary agent Elise Goodman. "If you sell a book to a big
conglomerate publisher and they pay a big advance and do a
big advertising campaign, you feel like the author gets lost
-- and the sales reflect it. Workman never gives up on a
book, and they don't treat them like soap: Each one gets
special handling."</p>
<p>Such treatment is the centerpiece of the Workman
publishing philosophy and helps explain why writers often
accept lower advances to be published there. While other
publishers keep vowing to improve their profits by publishing
fewer books better, their lists rarely dwindle. For years,
Workman has limited itself to about 20 new titles a year,
although more than 75% of its books are still in print -- a
phenomenal record -- so its publicists and commissioned
salespeople keep quite busy.</p>
<p>Workman's whimsy, eccentricity and obsessive attention to
detail flow from Mr. Workman, the 51-year-old founder. A
tall, gawky man with a lopsided grin and the bemused air of a
mad scientist, he works in a chaotic office where even the
floor is piled high with books and papers. Mr. Workman hates
meetings and memos, but he approves every project, book
jacket and print run and still writes every royalty check.
Editors and art directors are given enormous freedom to dream
up projects, but once they're picked, everyone is expected to
be as compulsive and disciplined as Mr. Workman to make them
succeed.</p>
<p>The high-pressure frenzy at Workman's funky downtown
offices -- and the boss's sometimes hot temper -- have driven
some authors and employees away. Helene Siegel, who once
managed production at Workman, says, "Peter doesn't
compromise, and he can wear you down." She says she respects
him enormously but also remembers him getting mad that she
wouldn't jump on a plane to inspect some pillows printed with
a Workman character when she was eight months pregnant.</p>
<p>"Every project drives us nuts; it's always missed
deadlines and crisis management," says James Martin, who has
supervised the printing of Workman books at Banta Co. in
Menasha, Wis., for 18 years. "We have never, ever had a book
whose cover didn't change three, four times." Nevertheless,
Mr. Martin is a big admirer of Mr. Workman. "Peter is a
genius and people here will do anything they can to
accommodate him," Mr. Martin says.</p>
<p>Most Workman employees feel the same way. And Mr.
Workman's methods have produced extraordinary growth. Mr.
Workman refuses to divulge sales and profits, but Ron Jaffe,
senior marketing director for Waldenbooks, says that sales of
Workman items there have doubled in the past three years
alone. Bert Snyder, Workman's sales manager, adds that one
title in three sells more than 100,000 copies.</p>
<p>Workman's success starts with Mr. Workman's instinct for
picking projects, but the publisher finds it hard to analyze
his formula. "Something begets something," he says in his
laconic way. "Things sort of unfold."</p>
<p>Workman's marketing panache dates back to a time when the
publisher had more energy than money. Its first big success,
"The Toy Book," was a how-to book of simple toys kids can
build. An advertising budget was impossible in 1972, so
author Stephen Caney made "hundreds" of appearances, says Mr.
Workman, and sales started to climb. (Still in print, though
with a new cover, the book has sold more than 320,000
copies.) To this day, Workman routinely mounts far longer
author tours than most publishers, while spending little on
ads.</p>
<p>Mr. Caney's penchant for dreaming up projects for kids has
led to a series of Workman "activity books" that come with
props. New fall selections from Mr. Caney include "Make Your
Own Time Capsule" and "Teach Yourself Tap Dancing," which
follow the best selling "Bug Book & Bug Bottle" and "Beach
Book & Beach Bucket" by other authors.</p>
<p>It was a cartoon cat in red sneakers that put Workman on
the map. B. Kliban's goofy "Cat" book has sold nearly a
million copies, but it was a slow starter. To promote it in
1975, most of the Workman staff ran around selling copies at
the annual cat show at Madison Square Garden. Then Mr.
Workman decided to give display posters of the cartoon cat to
bookstores. The posters were so popular, patrons stole them,
so bookstores asked to sell the posters, and Workman took up
licensing.</p>
<p>Pretty soon Workman was selling Kliban cat mugs, pillows,
stationery and aprons. Cat calendars led Workman into other
calendars, and today it sells millions, featuring teddy
bears, dolls, herbs, games and tips for saving the planet, as
well as 21 kinds of Page-A-Day calendars, a format it
pioneered.</p>
<p>The Workman way is to start small, print conservatively
and promote like mad, sometimes even for a book published
years before. A good example of how its persistence pays off
is "What to Expect When You're Expecting." When the book came
out in 1984, bookstore orders were a paltry 6,800 copies.
"Booksellers said, `Who needs another pregnancy book,
especially one that isn't written by a doctor?'" recalls
Workman's sales manager.</p>
<p>But Workman was convinced there was a market for the book.
Written by health writer Arlene Eisenberg and her two
daughters (one a nurse and both with children), the
month-by-month guide tells women how they'll feel and look
and answers questions they might feel silly bugging a doctor
with.</p>
<p>To keep copies moving, Workman offered a special deal to
bookstores that would order five or more. And Workman paid to
send the authors to annual meetings of obstetricians and
pediatricians, who then recommended the book. Now, with sales
of more than a million, "What to Expect" is the top selling
book on pregnancy, and unlike most books, it has higher sales
every year.</p>
<p>The authors followed it with "What to Eat When You're
Expecting" and "What to Expect the First Year," and Workman
has just signed them up for two more books. "We could get
more (advance) money from another publisher, but I don't want
to work for anyone else," says Mrs. Eisenberg. "Peter is the
only publisher I know who would allow updates with every
printing."</p>
<p>Workman's respect for contributors can be carried to
extremes. Take the teddy bears. Every year, about 20,000
teddy bear lovers send photos of their favorite pals to
Workman to audition for a place in Workman's popular Teddy
Bear calendar. The winning bears are sent by Federal Express
to New York for a photo shoot, but if the designers want to
pose a bear named, say, "Ralph" in a dress, a Workman staffer
will call the bear's home "to make sure no one minds," says
editor Suzanne Rafer.</p>
<p>There have been bombs at Workman, including a humor book
called "Sneakers," children's books by William Buckley and
Anne Beattie and a spoof of Chinese horoscopes called "Help,
I Just Found Out I'm a Pig."</p>
<p>But Mr. Workman keeps trying new things. Last year, he
bought small, classy fiction publisher Algonquin Books of
Chapel Hill, N.C. This fall, along with such Workmanlike
titles as "All I Need to Know I Learned From My Cat," Workman
will publish an uncharacteristic book about AIDS, for
teen-agers, and its first novel ever. The novel, "Good
Omens," is a funny book about the end of the world.</p>
<p>"It just felt good," says Mr. Workman.</p>
