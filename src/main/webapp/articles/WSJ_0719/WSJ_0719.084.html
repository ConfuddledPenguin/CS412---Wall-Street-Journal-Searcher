	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Philip Morris Cos. reported second-quarter net
income rose 27%, powered by strong gains in operating profit
in its big tobacco and food divisions.
   The consumer products concern said net increased to $948
million, or $1.03 a share, from $745 million, or 80 cents a
share, a year earlier. Operating revenue grew 12% to $12.74
billion from $11.42 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said earnings were even stronger than expected,
noting Philip Morris was particularly strong in its
international tobacco and big U.S. and international food
divisions.</p>
<p>The company, which recently announced plans to acquire 80%
of Swiss coffee and chocolate maker Jacobs Suchard AG for
$3.8 billion, doesn't break out results by division. But
Hamish Maxwell, chairman and chief executive officer, said in
a statement "cigarette unit volume, including exports,
increased strongly" for the quarter and the half. He said
unit sales of cigarettes in the U.S. edged up slightly during
the quarter and the half. That gain came despite declining
consumption of cigarettes in the U.S. Mr. Maxwell also cited
gains at the major food divisions.</p>
<p>Overall, operating profit before amortization of good
will, unallocated corporate expenses and interest, and other
debt expense increased 19% to $2.28 billion from $1.91
billion.</p>
<p>Analysts' estimates in operating profit growth by division
varied. Several of them put growth in operating profit for
the international cigarette business at 25% to 30%. In the
U.S. cigarette business, where Philip Morris is No. 1 in
revenue, analysts estimated operating profit grew between 12%
and 13% in the quarter. They noted the growth came despite an
about 20% increase in the company's marketing expenses in
that segment.</p>
<p>The company's big food divisions -- it is the nation's
largest food company in terms of revenue -- particularly
General Foods USA and Kraft USA, and the Kraft General Foods
International business also performed well. Becky Barfield,
an analyst at First Boston Corp., estimated a more than 25%
growth in operating profit for Kraft USA, helped by cheese
prices, and about a 25% growth in operating profit at General
Foods USA, helped by the swing in coffee profit. She said the
Miller Brewing subsidiary also did well.</p>
<p>Marc I. Cohen, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.,
estimated operating profit at Kraft General Foods
International grew about 50%.</p>
<p>Analysts also noted the company had one-time expenses
related to its planned move of about 500 of its 1,700
Manhattan employees to Rye Brook in Westchester County.</p>
<p>In the first half, earnings rose 29% to $1.72 billion, or
$1.86 a share, from $1.34 billion, or $1.44 a share, a year
ago. Operating revenue increased 9.5% to $24.1 billion from
$22 billion.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Philip Morris closed at $50.125, down 37.5 cents.</p>
