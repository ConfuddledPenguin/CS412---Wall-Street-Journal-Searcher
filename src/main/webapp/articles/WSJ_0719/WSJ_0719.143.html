	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal approvals for new generic drugs will
accelerate within "a period of months," Health and Human
Services Secretary Louis Sullivan told a congressional
hearing.
   Dr. Sullivan's prediction offers hope to the industry and
consumers that the Food and Drug Administration will soon
recover from the disorder and demoralization brought on by
last year's generic-drug scandals. But Rep. John Dingell (D.,
Mich.) painted a bleaker picture, chiding Dr. Sullivan for
the FDA's "negligible criminal enforcement" and the
"continuing paralysis of the generic-drug approval process."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Disclosures last year of fraud and bribery by officials of
some generic-drug companies slowed the FDA's generic-drug
approvals to a near halt. The FDA, a part of the Health and
Human Services Department, went from approving 61 generic
drugs in April 1989 to 15 in May 1989, when congressional
hearings chaired by Rep. Dingell publicized the scandals.
Since then, generic-drug approvals have averaged fewer than
10 a month.</p>
<p>Generics are lower-priced copies of brand-name drugs on
which the patents have expired.</p>
<p>Top executives of several generic-drug companies,
including American Therapeutics Inc. and My-K Laboratories
Inc., have been convicted of charges stemming from the
scandal. In addition, a grand jury last month indicted Dr.
Marvin Seife, former director of the FDA's division of
generic drugs, on two counts of perjury.</p>
<p>Generic-drug companies initially suffered a steep decline
in sales as pharmacists and consumers reacted to the news
that certain generic-drug companies had falsified data
submitted to win FDA clearance. Since January of this year,
however, sales have bounced back and are approaching a record
pace, according to industry analyst Hemant Shah of HKS & Co.,
Warren, N.J.</p>
<p>The slowdown in approvals has had a minimal effect on the
generic-drug industry, says Mr. Shah, because "there aren't
that many drugs which have gone off patent in the last couple
of years."</p>
<p>But the FDA's slow rate of approval could spell trouble
for the generic-drug industry in coming years as a large
number of high-selling brand-name drugs -- called
"blockbusters" in the industry -- that entered the market in
the early 1980s come off patent and generic-drug companies
attempt to introduce their own versions. Among the brand-name
drugs affected are Ceclor, a popular antibiotic made by Eli
Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, whose patent expires in 1992, and
Tagamet, a popular anti-ulcer drug made by SmithKline
Beckman, Philadelphia, which loses its patent in 1994. The
combined annual sales of blockbuster drugs coming off patent
between 1991 and 1995 is estimated to be $10 billion.</p>
<p>At yesterday's hearing, Before the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, Dr. Sullivan announced several steps to
improve the FDA's regulation of generic drugs. He said that
within the next week he would appoint an FDA ombudsman "to
address grievances that cannot be resolved by the agency's
line managers." He also announced the appointment of Roger
Williams, a pharmacologist at the University of California at
San Francisco, to head a newly created generic-drug office.</p>
<p>These officials face a formidable task in attempting to
improve the FDA's regulation of generic drugs. According to
Dr. Sullivan, an FDA survey of generic-drug approvals
conducted in the wake of the scandals found deficiencies in
half of all products surveyed.</p>
<p>Of particular concern are generic-drug tests conducted at
Biodecision Laboratories, Pittsburgh, which has done work for
almost every major generic-drug company. Eleven of 13
pre-approval drug tests conducted by the lab and surveyed by
the FDA were judged faulty by the agency. Among these were
tests for a generic version of doxycycline made by
Parke-Davis, a division of Warner-Lambert Co., Morris Plains,
N.J., and a generic version of erythromycin made by Mylan
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Morgantown, W.Va. Both generic
products are antibiotics.</p>
<p>Biodecision President Robert Lecher said yesterday that
the lab had conducted extensive evaluations of the 11 tests
involved and found "no new evidence that would make us
question our work."</p>
<p>But Dr. Sullivan said the FDA would hold up approvals "on
pending applications that may be affected" by any flaws in
Biodecision's procedures.</p>
