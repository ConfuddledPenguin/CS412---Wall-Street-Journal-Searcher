	<p class="article-leader">Mercedes-Benz AG said the company's workers' council
agreed to special Saturday overtime shifts to help the
company cope with rising demand.
   The auto-making arm of Daimler-Benz AG said that special
shifts will be added on "several Saturdays" beginning
September. The overtime shifts will affect the company's
plants in Stuttgart-Untertuerkheim, Sindelfingen and Bremen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mercedes-Benz had tried to introduce the overtime shifts
at the start of the year, but the company couldn't reach an
agreement with the workers' council</p>
<p>In a statement, Mercedes-Benz said the extra shifts will
be added "so that the company can react flexibly to the
heightened demand." It said that "clear" growth rates in
Europe and in other foreign markets for Mercedes-Benz cars in
general, along with lively demand for certain models and for
equipment, had prompted the need for extra shifts.</p>
