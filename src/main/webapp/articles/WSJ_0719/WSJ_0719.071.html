	<div class="article-body"><p>JOHN NEU, A MAJOR DEVELOPER of New Jersey real estate, is
taking direct action to help the homeless -- he is giving
them homes. Five of his prefabricated townhouses, installed
two blocks from the New Jersey end of the Holland Tunnel on
land donated by Newark's Roman Catholic Archdiocese, are now
transitional housing for single parents and their children in
Jersey City. In a second project, he will give away 25 more
of these $50,000 three-bedroom, 1 1/2-bath prefabs to
low-income families.</p>
<p>The developer's wife, Wendy, who is a former prison social
worker, literally brought the problem home to her husband. In
February 1989, she found a homeless woman on a street corner
and took her to the couple's Hoboken home. During the woman's
six-weeks' stay, John Neu learned firsthand the plight of the
homeless.</p>
<p>Searching for a home for their new charge, the Neus became
acquainted with the Newark Archdiocese's Catholic Community
Services and Tom Catlaw, the church agency's director for
Hudson County, which includes Jersey City. By this time, John
Neu was determined to go further in helping the homeless. (He
and his wife, incidentally, did eventually locate a place for
their homeless guest.)</p>
<p>The archdiocese owned five empty lots in Jersey City, near
one of its community centers. Mr. Neu had five unfinished
prefab townhouses in a warehouse, repossessed from a failed
customer. The combination was a natural. Mr. Catlaw and the
archdiocese offered the five lots as a building site; Mr. Neu
put the final touches on the prefabs and donated them. The
church group raised most of the $115,000 needed for
foundations, sidewalks, utilities connections and other
site-preparation work.</p>
<p>In June, the archdiocese began using the new homes as
transitional housing for families, most headed by single
parents, already enrolled in programs for counseling,
education and job training.</p>
<p>The townhouses represent the final phase of a three-part
program for the homeless. This starts with emergency shelter
for as long as 45 days, moving next into a transitional
period of as long as six months, and finally, thanks to Mr.
Neu, into a period of stabilization when families can count
on a roof over their heads for as long as two years.</p>
<p>This process, Mr. Catlaw says, is designed to break a
cycle of homelessness that finds many of the church agency's
clients entering a second generation without a permanent
home. They're "not necessarily on the street," he says, "but
living with relatives or in shelters." After this new
transitional stage, he says, "when children have been in the
same school for two years," the families should be ready to
move out on their own. The family heads, in turn, are
expected to turn over part of whatever earnings they have to
the archdiocese, which holds them in savings accounts against
the day the families are ready to stand alone.</p>
<p>John Neu, in Mr. Catlaw's eyes, is "an incredible human
being." He recalls that this past Christmas, the developer
and his wife spent the day at one of the archdiocese's
psychiatric centers, cooking and serving meals. Mr. Neu's
company is Manhattan-based and he and his wife now live there
as well, but his interests are New Jersey-oriented. The firm
owns five million square feet of real estate there and a
scrap business has an installation in Jersey City.</p>
<p>For Mr. Neu, this first gift is only the beginning. The
next is designed to help the nearly homeless, families caught
in that Catch-22 of too much income to qualify for housing
subsidies and too little to afford a home.</p>
<p>Mr. Neu is now working with a new low-income project
sponsored by another nonprofit Jersey City organization
called Neighborhood Housing, which is rebuilding a 25-block
area there. For this, he plans to buy and donate 25
additional prefab townhouses, which will be erected on land
obtained from the city.</p>
