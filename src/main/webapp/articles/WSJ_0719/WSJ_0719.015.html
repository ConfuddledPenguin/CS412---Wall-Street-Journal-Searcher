	<p class="article-leader">Everybody in the fall of 1989 -- a few short months ago --
was sure that German unification would take years. Similarly,
the current common wisdom is that liquidating the Stalinist
economies of Central Europe -- East Germany, Czechoslovakia
and Hungary (all areas that before World War II were
economically fully developed) -- will take many years.
Actually, the changes are coming with lightning speed, and
there is no slowing or stopping them. For the goods turned
out by Central Europe's plants have become unsalable.
   By 1995, Volkswagen expects to make 250,000 Rabbits in a
plant in Zwickau, East Germany, that last year turned out
50,000 of the tiny, expensive and chronically malfunctioning
Trabant cars. But what is that plant going to make during
these next five years? Not a single Trabant can be sold now
that East Germans can buy, for less money, bigger and
infinitely better Western-made Fords, Volkswagens, Opels or
Fiats. Central European-made textiles, appliances, toys, hand
tools, processed foods and shoes have all become similarly
unsalable and are, indeed, no longer on the store shelves in
Berlin, Budapest and Prague. And even the lushest government
subsidy could not make a Western manufacturer put into its
automobile bodies the heavy and pockmarked sheet steel that
Central European rolling mills turn out.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For Central Europe to regain a modicum of prosperity, let
alone enjoy social and political stability, its industries
must become productive and competitive in no time at all.
This requires, however, that industrial employment be slashed
more drastically than it has ever been slashed, even in a
severe depression. East Germany's total labor force numbers
nine million (out of a total population of 16.5 million).
West German economists, including those of the trade unions,
estimate that between three million and four million workers
will have to be laid off if East German industry is to
survive in a competitive market. This, although East Germany
has the most efficient industries of the entire Soviet Bloc.</p>
<p>A rapid economic turnaround has to be Central Europe's top
priority. Without it there will be neither social nor
political stability. But the region's fragile democracies,
with their tremendous social and political tensions, could
not stand prolonged mass unemployment. They need something
unprecedented: radical job cuts coupled with employment
maintenance or, at least, income maintenance. This is the
turnaround challenge of Central Europe.</p>
<p>And it is the prosperity and stability not just of Central
Europe that is at stake, but that of Western Europe as well.
A successful turnaround of Central Europe offers
unprecedented opportunities to Western Europe, and above all
to West Germany. It promises a long investment-led boom that
would make Europe the world's economic leader.</p>
<p>But failure to turn around the economies of Central
Europe, and fast, would surely trigger a mass exodus of
despairing people from the East -- a larger-scale repetition
of the flight of 3,000 East Germans a day that inundated West
Germany before the Berlin Wall crumbled last autumn. And if
prolonged mass unemployment were the price for the
turnaround, it would evoke the same response. "I am
optimistic," said a West German publisher when he told me of
his buying a number of East German newspapers. "But it's a
high-low poker game with the biggest stakes ever."</p>
<p>To produce 250,000 cars a year in Zwickau, Volkswagen
expects to employ no more people than had been employed in
the same plant to build 50,000 Trabants. In other words, four
out of every five Trabant workers should never have been on
the payroll.</p>
<p>Central Europe's most efficient steel mill, Witkowice in
Czechoslovakia, produces about the same tonnage it did in
1938, but with a substantially larger work force. In the
West, even an inefficent steel mill turns out 2 1/2 times the
tonnage per worker it did 50 years ago, or about three times
what Witkowice does.</p>
<p>Even the plants in Central Europe that have kept abreast
of technology are overstaffed. The Tungsram works outside of
Budapest, of which General Electric recently acquired
control, make a first-rate light bulb. But they employ almost
50% more people, proportionately, than do GE, Siemens and
Philips in their light-bulb plants in the West.</p>
<p>These are not isolated examples. In a Stalinist economy,
over-staffing is not mismanagement; it is a virtue and built
into the system. All incentives reward putting more people on
the payroll: capital available for investment in the plant;
raw materials allocated to the plant; managerial pay and
managerial perks. As a political system too, Stalinism pushes
over-staffing. Large plants are expected to create jobs to
reward the party faithful.</p>
<p>A Stalinist economy also misemploys. All its emphasis is
on the heavy industries of the 1920s: coal mining, steel,
commodity chemicals. As a result, employment in Central
Europe is concentrated in the "smokestack" industries in
which there is over-capacity world-wide. A good many, some
very big employers among them, will shut down. A likely
candidate for the padlock is the large chemical complex in
Bitterfeld, East Germany, probably Europe's biggest. Because
its raw material is lignite -- a sulfur-laden, ash-rich, soft
coal -- its costs are double those of its petroleum-using
competitors across the border in West Germany. And reducing
lignite's life-threatening pollution to the minimum
acceptable level would drive up costs by an added two-fifths
or so.</p>
<p>Yet, typically there is little alternative employment
available in the areas in which these over-manned or obsolete
plants are located. Stalinism deliberately organized its
political control around one big plant or industry that
dominates its region. Zwickau, Witkowice and Bitterfeld are
all single-employer towns. It is precisely there, however,
that jobs will have to be cut the most.</p>
<p>There are substantial employment opportunities in Central
Europe. Many workers will be needed, for instance, to rebuild
the obsolescent, dilapidated factories that are Stalinism's
legacy. To convert Zwickau into an efficient Volkswagen plant
should keep one-third of its present work force busy.
Rebuilding Central Europe's industry could provide jobs for
something like 5% of the total industrial work force, it is
estimated. It won't come cheap, though. Volkswagen, for
instance, plans to invest $3 billion in Zwickau -- more than
it should cost to build such a plant from scratch. In East
Germany capital will not be much of a problem, however; West
Germany has deep pockets. In Hungary and Czechoslovakia, too,
capital to rebuild the plants seems to be available from the
West.</p>
<p>Another substantial employment opportunity -- perhaps for
as much as another 5% of the work force -- lies in rebuilding
the run-down infrastructure of Central Europe. East Germany,
for instance, has fewer telephones now than it had before
World War II; its railroads and highways also have fallen
well below prewar standards. The biggest infrastructure need
in all of Central Europe is housing; communist regimes always
treat it as a stepchild. What is needed is not public housing
but housing that gives privacy, is privately financed and
privately owned. "If only," a Czech friend said, "we could
find someone like your Mr. Levitt who built the Levittowns in
Long Island and around Philadelphia after World War II."</p>
<p>But the biggest employment opportunities lie in services.
Communist regimes consider them "bourgeois" and are hostile
to them. There is, therefore, tremendous demand all over
Central Europe for every kind of service: retail and
wholesale distribution; repair and maintenance; banking and
insurance; restaurants, laundries, dry cleaners and so on.
Services, as we know, can come into being practically
overnight and without much investment. All they require is a
local entrepreneur. And since factory workers in Central
Europe have been badly paid, shifting into service work often
means making more money. Europe's best chance for a
successful turnaround may then lie in rapidly building a
thriving service sector.</p>
<p>The biggest question regarding Central Europe's turnaround
is a political one. Will governments refrain from doing the
wrong things, however popular they might be?</p>
<p>The worst thing Europe's governments could do -- and the
one they are, alas, most likely to do -- is subsidize
continuing industrial over-staffing. Unless Central Europe's
manufacturing plants become competitive very fast, there will
be no turnaround. Cutting piecemeal is the wrong move in a
turnaround, and the most expensive move in the end. One must
be able to tell people, "We're done with cutting. Let's start
building." Otherwise no one does any work.</p>
<p>Any financial assistance given -- and quite a bit will be
needed -- should be aimed at creating new, productive jobs.
There might also be a need to provide income maintenance --
e.g., following early retirement. But subsidizing
unproductive and redundant jobs can only obstruct economic
recovery. It ultimately endangers social stability.</p>
<p>Equally dangerous would be protecting Central European
industries from competition within Europe. There will be high
barriers in Europe against Japan and South Korea. But rapid
European economic integration must not be sacrificed to the
short-term problems of Central Europe.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the legacy of 40 years of Stalinism: the
hostility in Central Europe to services and especially to the
independent entrepreneur. "We need 500 house painters in
Prague alone," my Czech friend said, "and there'd be more
than enough work for them. But the government monopolies
wouldn't sell them ladders or paint brushes or paint. They'd
consider them antisocial and parasites." In the last
analysis, Central Europe's turnaround may therefore well be
as much a matter of political courage and political will as
of investments and of economics.</p>
<p>Market economics and free enterprise, it is now being
said, have won over communism. This is not really true.
Communism collapsed from within, economically, politically
and, above all, morally: It defeated itself. Free enterprise
and market economics -- and democracy as well -- will have
won only when they have turned around Central Europe.</p>
