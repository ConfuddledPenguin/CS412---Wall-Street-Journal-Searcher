	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- An investor has sued Dataproducts Corp. and
its chief executive officer, Jack C. Davis, for allegedly
issuing false and misleading positive statements about the
company before its stock took a tumble last September.
   The drop in the stock price, to $9.50 a share on Sept. 8
from as high as $13.875 in August, came after Dataproducts
announced a restructuring that resulted in a one-time charge
of $45 million. That move came as Dataproducts sought to
resist a hostile bid from DPC Acquisition Corp., a New York
investment group led by Crescott Investment Associates. This
year, Dataproducts was acquired by a venture formed by two
affiliates of Hitachi Ltd., the Tokyo-based electronic
equipment maker, for about $160 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nadeem Faruqi, a purchaser of 100 Dataproducts shares,
said in his lawsuit filed in federal court here that the
misleading statements began May 3, 1988, with a news release
calling "solid ink technology" the future of office printing,
when the company knew it was facing technical and marketing
difficulties.</p>
<p>The Woodland Hills, Calif., maker of computer printers and
other data handling equipment also covered up problems with
its SI 480 printer and airline ticket printing products, the
suit charges.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis said yesterday that he hadn't seen the suit and
thus couldn't comment on it.</p>
<p>The suit, which seeks class-action status on behalf of
those who purchased stock between May 3, 1988, and Sept. 7,
1989, seeks unspecified damages.</p>
<p>In the year ended March 31, Dataproducts had a net loss of
$8.1 million, or 41 cents a share, on revenue of $333.7
million. It had net income of $3.8 million, or 19 cents a
share, on revenue of $353.4 million the year before.</p>
