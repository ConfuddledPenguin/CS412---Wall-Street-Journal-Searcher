	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- Boy Scouts should "Be Prepared," but
need they pack riot gear for the 17th World Scout Jamboree in
Korea next year?
   A lot of U.S. moms and dads seem to think so. They believe
Korea is just too dangerous, even though their Scouts have
probably already survived subzero camping, undercooked food
and rope-bridge crossings. The parents have seen coverage of
bomb-throwing anti-U.S. student protesters and don't want
their teen-agers earning merit badges in riot control.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So organizers of the giant camping trip, held roughly
every four years, are having trouble persuading U.S. Scouts
to camp in the shadow of Mount Sorak. During the Aug. 8-16,
1991, event, Scouts from European socialist countries may
make their first appearance at a world jamboree. Scouts from
121 other countries will be there, with Japanese Scouts in
record numbers. And some Girl Scouts will brave it.</p>
<p>But so far only about 2,000 U.S. Scouts have asked for
applications. That compares with 3,000 -- at least -- that
jamboree officials in Seoul were hoping to get, and the
7,000-strong contingent the U.S. sent to Japan in 1971.
"There is still a perception of Korea that it is not a garden
spot," says Terry R. Hanna, a prominent Oklahoma City
attorney and Scout leader who is drumming up interest in the
jamboree.</p>
<p>So supporters have made a video showing Korea at its best,
sent letters to Scout councils around the nation and asked
businessmen who have visited Korea to assure parents about
its safety and hospitality. They point out that Korea isn't
another Iran, where the 1979 world jamboree had to be
canceled when Islamic revolutionaries overthrew the Shah.
"It's not a life or death matter, but I want the Boy Scouts
of America to be represented here," says Kim Kyu Young,
secretary general of the Boy Scouts of Korea.</p>
<p>The U.S. news media are being blamed for the fears about
safety, because isolated incidents have at times made it
appear that the entire country was in flames. In reality,
protests -- small and almost always contained on college
campuses by riot police -- are dwindling, and no American has
ever been attacked by Korean protesters.</p>
<p>In Korea, Doug Smith, a 19-year-old Eagle Scout from
Portland, Ore., and volunteer worker for the jamboree,
concedes that his parents initially were worried about his
safety. "But they came out and visited and saw it was OK," he
says.</p>
