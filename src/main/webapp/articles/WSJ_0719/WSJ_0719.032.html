	<p class="article-leader">AID FROM TOKYO</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japan, the world's largest donor of official foreign aid
last year, should improve the quality and the quantity of its
aid to developing nations, a Japanese government Economic
Planning Agency advisory panel said in a report.</p>
<p>The nation should increase the number of grants it gives
developing countries as a proportion of overall official aid,
the report said. In 1988, grants made up 46.6% of Japan's
official development assistance, compared with an average
78.4% among 18 other donor nations in the same period, an
agency official said. The other nations included the U.S.,
Australia and European Community nations.</p>
<p>The agency report also urged Japan to increase
technological aid, which made up only 12% of Japan's total
development aid in 1988 against an average 21.3% among other
donor states. In addition, the report recommended sending
more engineering consultants abroad and inviting more
engineers to Japan for training.</p>
<p>Japan is now in the middle of a five-year plan to boost
aid to more than $50 billion in 1988-1992 from $24.9 billion
in 1983-1987, an agency official said.</p>
<p>GERMAN HEALTH-CARE PROBLEM</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of West German youths choose each year
to work with the sick, the old and the handicapped as an
alternative to military service. But as the East-West
confrontation has eased, Bonn has reduced the conscription
period for those doing the civilian tasks from 20 months to
16, and hospitals and homes for the elderly or disabled fear
the loss of a crucial source of inexpensive labor. "We are
facing a serious problem," said Gerhard Wagner of the German
Red Cross, where 25% of the work is done by conscripts. The
number of youths choosing social service over military
training rose to 87,000 in 1989 from 6,000 in 1967.</p>
<p>SOUTH KOREAN ROUNDUP</p>
<p>South Korean prosecutors said about 5,000 real-estate
speculators had been rounded up in a crackdown that began
early in March. Of those detained, 540 people were arrested
and formally charged, and about 4,000 suspects booked for
investigations, prosecutors said. The government ordered the
crackdown mainly to check inflation, but land and housing
prices continue to rise.</p>
<p>LAYOFFS IN SUDAN</p>
<p>Sudan, struggling to fight a huge budget deficit and move
toward a market economy, said it will lay off about 50,000
government workers within a month. The move, which will
reduce the government work force by 10%, is part of a
three-year economic-reform program launched last month. Sudan
owes about $13 billion to foreign creditors.</p>
<p>SAS STRIKE OVER</p>
<p>Scandinavian Airlines System reached an agreement with its
Swedish pilots, whose one-day walkouts led to cancellations
of many SAS flights. SAS said it agreed to a 7% wage increase
for the pilots, who in turn pledged to raise productivity
through more flying time. The airline's Swedish pilots walked
off their jobs July 12 and 16. The pilots now average about
32,000 kronor a month ($5,370); top salaries are about 55,000
kronor.</p>
<p>A JAPANESE RECORD</p>
<p>The nine major electric-power companies on Japan's main
islands set a new record for output in a one-hour period
yesterday, according to Japan's Federation of Electric Power
Companies. At 0600 Greenwich Mean Time, the utilities
recorded a one-hour output of 137,946 megawatts. Japan has
been experiencing unusually hot weather, which puts a higher
call on electric power for cooling. Japan's utilities are now
working at near full capacity, a federation spokesman said.</p>
<p>BONN'S ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY</p>
<p>West Germany has embarked on an extensive study of the
environmental costs and benefits related to overall economic
output.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by the Federal Statistics Office,
will attempt to measure and quantify the environmental
aspects of economic production, which now aren't included in
data compiled on the nation's gross national product.</p>
<p>"There's doubt, whether in the long-term, GNP can still be
used as a measure of economic output," said Bonn Environment
Minister Klaus Toepfer. He said the statistics-office model
should make clear what links exist between economic and
environmental developments.</p>
<p>The statistics office won't have a complete picture of the
environmental economics ready for another two years, but Mr.
Toepfer said that next January, when preliminary data on 1990
economic growth are presented, the agency should be able to
at least give some indications on how water and air pollution
have developed during the year.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>South Korea accused North Korea of "a betrayal" after the
latter postponed an inter-Korea parliamentary meeting. After
a six-month suspension, lawmakers of the two nations were
scheduled to reopen talks at the border village of Panmunjom
on Friday. North Korea said the split in the South Korean
parliament would make the scheduled talks fruitless. . . .
The State Department advised U.S. citizens to take caution
when traveling in Nepal. It said that although violent
incidents in Katmandu during the spring have diminished,
strikes and anti-government demonstrations continue.</p>
