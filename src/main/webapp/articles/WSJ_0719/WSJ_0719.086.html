	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- If anything proves that political borders no
longer inhibit the flow of capital, it is that shares of
Chile's biggest telephone company are expected to begin
trading tomorrow on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Compania de Telefonos de Chile's offering of 110 million
shares, underwritten by Salomon Brothers, is said to be
oversubscribed. It will be the first Latin American stock to
be listed on an American exchange since 1963 and the first on
the Big Board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The pitch, in a word, is growth. And CTC's stock, expected
to be priced at 17 shares for about $15 on the Big Board, is
being offered at under six times earnings and at a yield
after Chilean taxes of 8%.</p>
<p>CTC's roughly $100 million offering will increase its
float by 15%. Its shares now trade on the Santiago Stock
Exchange, which was founded in 1893 and is open every
business day for two 45-minute sessions.</p>
<p>The Santiago exchange is small and illiquid -- its total
market capitalization is one-sixth of IBM's -- but CTC is a
bet not on Chile's stock exchange but on the country itself.</p>
<p>Chile has what is probably Latin America's healthiest and
decidedly most free market-oriented economy. Its gross
domestic product grew last year by 10%; its trade balance in
1988 was positive by $2 billion; and its 13 million people
are, by Latin American standards, urbane and educated.
However, inflation is about 21%.</p>
<p>The sentiment of foreigners doing business in Chile, as
expressed by John Duncan, chairman of Englewood, Colo.-based
Cyprus Minerals, is that Chile "is unique in Latin America.
It's taking off."</p>
<p>CTC's basic business, which accounted for half of its $290
million in 1989 revenue, is providing regulated local
telephone service. It also sells some of Chile's
long-distance service and is expanding in public telephones,
private telephone systems and equipment, and cellular service
in the country's two major cities, Santiago and Valparaiso.</p>
<p>But though telephone service has recently grown, it lags
behind demand and badly. Chile has six telephone lines for
each 100 people. Argentina has 10 for each 100; the U.S. has
52.</p>
<p>The waiting period to get a telephone in Chile is roughly
a year. And 293,000 applications for service are pending,
equal to one-third of the total lines installed. This
situation is, the company believes, an opportunity for
growth. And, brokers emphasize to investors,
inflation-adjusted growth.</p>
<p>Telephone tariffs are set by a government model to provide
a 12% real rate of return, and prices are adjusted for
inflation. And if CTC outperforms the model, it is free to
pocket the difference.</p>
<p>CTC's backlog owes, in part, to a collection of uninspired
or underfinanced previous owners. Its former controlling
managers or shareholders include ITT; Chile's former elected
Marxist government; Chile's former unelected military
government; and Alan Bond, the Australian investor, art
collector and debtor.</p>
<p>Bond Corp. International acquired a half-share in CTC when
it was privatized in 1988. Earlier this year, with Mr. Bond's
empire teetering, it sold its stake in CTC to Spanish-based
Telefonica de Espana for $391 million.</p>
<p>Telefonica's first moves were to slow down CTC's
development plan and to cut dividends to 80% of net income
from 100%. It did this, according to the prospectus, because
CTC had "identified various potential obstacles . . .
including possible lack of outside contractors, possible
delays or shortfalls in financing, delays in equipment
supplies and potential limitations of skilled labor."</p>
<p>However, the revised plan is hardly timid. CTC plans to
put one million new lines in service by 1996 and to double
the number of telephones per capita.</p>
<p>Just through the end of 1992, it will need to spend about
$1 billion. This is, for CTC, a big number. Net income last
year was roughly $130 million, and most of its earnings, at
least for the moment, are being eaten up by dividends.</p>
<p>Thus, growth will largely be financed from borrowings. Net
income is unlikely to rise much, if at all, in the next few
years because of rising interest costs and depreciation.</p>
<p>CTC's debt is a tolerable 42% of capitalization. However,
covenants in pending loans restrict CTC from taking on too
much debt. If its development program runs into snags, it
could be forced to curtail borrowings and growth. "Financing
or other obstacles could result in a reduction of dividends,"
CTC says.</p>
<p>Maria Elena Carrion, an analyst at U.S. Trust of New York,
says CTC has "two big negatives: no earnings growth for the
next three years and large capital expenses for years to
come." And Chile's recent transition to democracy brings, in
some analysts' minds, a prospect of higher inflation. Though
CTC's tariffs rise with inflation, Andrew Economos, a
portfolio manager at Scudder, Stevens & Clark, worries that
"inflation-indexation is one of the first things to go" in an
economic crisis.</p>
<p>Chile, though, doesn't seem headed for crisis. While the
current round of democratic government is new, free-market
economics aren't. The question, most likely, isn't whether
CTC will grow, but how fast?</p>
