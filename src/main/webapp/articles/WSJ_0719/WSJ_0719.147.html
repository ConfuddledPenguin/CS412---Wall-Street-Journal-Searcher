	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- The U.S. presented the Soviet Union a detailed
proposal for extended U.S. technical aid to Moscow in several
economic problem areas.
   The paper, handed to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze by Secretary of State James Baker at a meeting
here, offers no U.S. funds but promises U.S. expertise to
help improve such areas as banking, housing, the tax system
and distribution networks. The U.S. also is offering to help
with market education.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposal is a follow-up to the annual economic summit
last week in Houston, at which President Bush said direct
economic aid was premature and, instead, stressed technical
economic assistance.</p>
<p>According to an aide to Mr. Baker, the secretary of state
emphasized U.S. help for changing the Soviet distribution
system. The official said Mr. Baker told Mr. Shevardnadze
that "It doesn't do the Soviets a lot of good if they are
producing a lot more goods or acquiring a lot more goods if
they can't distribute them."</p>
<p>The official conceded that President Bush made a similar
offer to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev at the Malta
summit in December and that the technical advice projects
offered then hadn't yet been carried out. But he added that
Mr. Shevardnadze seemed anxious to accept the current offer
and that he told Mr. Baker he might appoint a small staff to
see that the technical assistance actually is delivered.</p>
<p>Separately, the State Department official said Mr.
Shevardnadze didn't object to the U.S. policy of trying to
build ties to the new non-Communist opposition in the Soviet
Union.</p>
<p>"Shevardnadze said that was understandable, he had no
problem with that," the official said.</p>
