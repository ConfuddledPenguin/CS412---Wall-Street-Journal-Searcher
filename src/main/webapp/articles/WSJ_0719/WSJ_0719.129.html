	<p class="article-leader">Cap Gemini Sogeti S.A. has agreed to buy the 69.5% of
Hoskyns Group PLC owned jointly by West Germany's Siemens AG
and Britain's General Electric Co. PLC for #199 million
($361.5 million), the companies said yesterday.
   CGS, a French data processing service group, also said it
would make an offer for the balance of Hoskyns shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hoskyns, a computer services group, saw its shares rise 58
pence to 353 ($6.41) following the announcement.</p>
<p>CGS said it is offering 330 pence a share for Hoskyns,
valuing the whole of the company at #286 million.</p>
<p>Although the board of Hoskyns said it isn't recommending
whether or not shareholders should accept the CGS offers, it
said "the terms of the offer are fair and reasonable."</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers, the
U.K. body which governs regulations on bids, said the panel
hasn't yet studied the proposal.</p>
