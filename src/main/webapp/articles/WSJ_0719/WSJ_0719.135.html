	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. SAID it would hold talks with Vietnam in a bid to
end Cambodia's war.
   In a policy reversal, Secretary of State Baker said the
Bush administration would negotiate with the Vietnamese to
try to prevent the Khmer Rouge guerrillas from again taking
over Cambodia. The U.S. said it will no longer support
awarding Cambodia's U.N. seat to a three-party coalition that
includes two non-Communist groups and the Khmer Rouge. The
U.S. also plans to loosen curbs on humanitarian aid for
Vietnam and Cambodia, whose government was installed by
Hanoi.</p>

with its stalling tactics at the negotiating table, helped
spark the U.S. policy shift.</p>

<p>The Senate approved the Civil Rights Act of 1990 by a vote
of 65-34. The measure would overturn five 1989 Supreme Court
decisions that made it more difficult for victims of
employment discrimination to win court cases. President Bush,
who maintains the legislation would result in quotas, has
threatened to veto it.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Baker gave Soviet Foreign Minister
Shevardnadze a proposal for U.S. technical aid to Moscow
focusing on banking, housing, taxes and distribution of
goods. Separately, a State Department aide said Shevardnadze
didn't object to U.S. efforts to build ties to the
non-Communist Soviet opposition.</p>

<p>The Senate Ethics Committee issued a recommendation that
the full Senate denounce Sen. David Durenberger for
"unequivocally unethical" financial conduct. The panel told
the Minnesota Republican to repay more than $29,000 to the
Senate and also pay $95,000 to charities for exceeding the
chamber's limits on honoraria.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union and Hungary accepted NATO's offer to
establish diplomatic ties with the military alliance,
officials said in Brussels. The decisions came less than two
weeks after NATO leaders vowed to reduce their military
defenses in Europe and reassured the East of their peaceful
intentions.</p>

<p>British researchers said they may have found a genetic
trigger that determines an embryo's sex. Scientists from
Britain's Imperial Cancer Research Fund and the Medical
Research Council said they found the gene in the Y
chromosome. They stressed that the finding shouldn't be used
for genetic manipulation of the human species.</p>

<p>Strong aftershocks jolted earthquake-devastated areas in
the Philippines as more bodies were dug out, raising the
death toll from Monday's quake to 376. Hundreds were still
reported to be trapped under rubble in the mountain resort of
Baguio.</p>

<p>Mandela returned to South Africa after a six-week world
tour, saying the African National Congress won't agree to a
cease-fire until Pretoria leaders release hundreds of
prisoners and meet other conditions. In Natal province, at
least 28 blacks died and 56 were hurt when gunmen ambushed a
bus.</p>

<p>A National Research Council study said a U.S. plan for an
underground nuclear waste dump is "bound to fail" because it
requires the Energy Department to build an underground
repository that will be safe for 10,000 years. That, the
study said, is a scientific impossibility, adding that
federal law should have flexibility to allow for
uncertainties.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe plans to lift a 25-year state of emergency next
week. The government said the special powers, including
detention without trial, were no longer needed. The measures
were introduced in 1965, when former Rhodesian Prime Minister
Ian Smith declared independence from Britain.</p>

<p>The House approved a $50.35 billion agriculture bill that
would deny funding for new federal crop-insurance policies in

programs favored by the Bush administration.</p>

<p>East Germany announced an emergency aid package to rescue
its farm sector, which has suffered from a flood of West
German produce following this month's economic merger with
Bonn. The East German government said farmers would receive
$1 billion in assistance to subsidize prices, promote exports
and pay wages.</p>

<p>A judge ruled that a 12-year-old Chicago boy suffering
from leukemia can't demand that two half-siblings be tested
to see if they would be compatible bone-marrow donors,
thereby dismissing a lawsuit that had been brought by the
boy's father.</p>

<p>Two cosmonauts used an emergency hatch to re-enter their

life-support supplies were running out, Soviet media said.
The incident was the latest in a series of problems plaguing
the six-month mission, which began in February.</p>
