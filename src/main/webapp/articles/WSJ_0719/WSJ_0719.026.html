	<p class="article-leader">FORT WORTH, Texas -- Pier 1 Imports said that sales rose
almost 12% in June but that sales for those at stores open
more than a year fell 2.6%.
   The company attributed the slip in sales at older stores
to a decline in furniture sales. "The consumer has lost a
little confidence in the economy and is buying less
furniture," said Robert G. Herndon, chief financial officer
for the home-furnishing retailer. Mr. Herndon said the
company's sales of soft goods remain strong.</p>

million a year ago.</p>
