	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Consolidated Rail Corp. increased its
quarterly dividend 14%, as a big reduction in shares
outstanding improved its per-share net income.
   The freight railroad boosted the payout to 40 cents a
share from 35 cents, payable Sept. 14 to stock of record Aug.
31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though Conrail posted a 9.8% decline in second-quarter net
income to $74 million from $82 million a year earlier,
earnings per share increased 35% to $1.61 from $1.19. Profit
on a fully diluted basis was $1.46 a share in the latest
period.</p>
<p>Revenue declined 2.3% to $861 million from $881 million.</p>
<p>The company said the number of common shares outstanding
as of June 30 was 38% lower than that of a year earlier,
accounting for the improvement in quarterly earnings per
share.</p>
<p>Graeme Lidgerwood, an analyst at First Boston Corp., said:
"Conrail is generating substantial cash flow in excess of its
capital spending requirements. In addition, the company is
paying dividends on fewer shares outstanding, which makes
additional cash available to boost the dividend rate."</p>
<p>Conrail said it had an after-tax gain of about $9 million
in the latest quarter, resulting from its previously reported
sale of the Cockeysville, Md., industrial track to the
Maryland Mass Transit Administration. But the company said
the gain was more than offset by a $15 million reduction in
net owing to the financing of the first quarter's $1.1
billion tender offer.</p>
<p>James Hagen, Conrail's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, said that overall traffic levels in the
second quarter were "essentially flat," and that the company
continued to be subject to pricing pressure and an
unfavorable traffic mix. For example, Conrail hauled
relatively higher volumes of low-rated commodities, such as
coal, and lower volumes of high-rated freight, such as autos.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Conrail shares closed at $50.25, down 75 cents.</p>
