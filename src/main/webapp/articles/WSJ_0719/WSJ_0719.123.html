	<p class="article-leader">Clothestime Inc. said it sees about a 30% decline in
second-quarter per-share profit to about 11 cents a share
from 16 cents a share.
   In the year-ago quarter ended July 29, the apparel-store
chain posted net income of $2.3 million, or 16 cents a share,
on sales of about $52 million. The second quarter ends on
July 28.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Clothestime said that comparable store sales this month
are running about 9% lower than last July. Total monthly
sales are expected to be about $17 million, roughly the same
as last year, a company official said.</p>
<p>Clothestime attributed the lower-than-expected sales
mainly to a lack of television advertising this month. Last
summer, the company reoriented its marketing to focus on
somewhat older customers and to sell more brand-name clothes.
Clothestime said its "competitive pricing" on the brand-name
merchandise has resulted in "slightly lower gross margins."</p>
