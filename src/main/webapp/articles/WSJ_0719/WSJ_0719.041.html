	<p class="article-leader">TEMPEST IN A TAPE DECK: Controversial Sony DAT sales hum,
for now.
   A music publishers' lawsuit to ban digital audio tape
players, charging they abet copyright piracy, hasn't hurt
early demand for the first consumer models. But a severe DAT
shortage and the $900 price may cut popularity later. "The
public is laughing at the suit," says Michael Kay of Lyric
High Fidelity, New York. He says he could easily sell 50 to
70 units this month but notes Sony can only deliver 10. In
Berkeley, Calif., Greg Badie of The Good Guys says it got 50
DATs for all 22 stores. "We sold out two days after we got
them."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Enthusiasm isn't universal. "People won't be interested
until the product is well under $500," says Herbert
Schmutzler of Sounds Deluxe in Clarendon Hills, Ill.
"Basically, it's a high-end tape deck," adds Mark Sloan, of
the Media Room, Morton Grove, Ill. Edward Murphy of the
National Music Publishers Association, thinks otherwise. His
group argues that DATs make "perfect clones" that deprive
songwriters and publishers of royalties.</p>
<p>Sony expects industrywide, first-year sales of 80,000 to
100,000 DAT units.</p>
<p>KEEP BAILING] Summer finds many boat owners, dealers still
adrift.</p>
<p>Boats languish for months, even years as softness
continues. Melchor Garcia cut the asking price on his 55-foot
motor yacht on Long Island to $660,000 from $790,000 during
the two years it's been on the market. Mort Sussman, who's
been trying to sell his boat on the island for months, says
"several people are interested, but seem very over-extended"
and can't get financing.</p>
<p>"There are loans we should be able to approve that we
aren't able to place," says Jeffrey Stith, of Yegen Marine,
who brokers loans. Yachting Magazine's "yacht of the month"
for July isn't immune. Asking price on the 80-foot
motorsailer: $2.1 million -- 16% below cost. Another sign of
the times: Newport International Sailboat Show considered
allowing used boats at its September show, but shelves the
idea until 1991.</p>
<p>CHICKENS LOSE APPETITE when it's hot; weather affects
others, too.</p>
<p>Mother Nature obviously determines crop size and food
prices. Economists say poultry prices may rise because
chickens are off their feed. But the weather's influence is
being felt in other data, too. The latest: consumer spending.
DRI/McGraw-Hill's Roger Brinner says that worries over a
pending consumer crash are over-rated, since recent retail
sales reports look bad only in comparison to weather-induced
sales during winter. "People went out and shopped, creating
an artificially high base" that made April, May and June look
worse, he says. Sanford Bernstein's Giulio Martini concurs,
noting five of the past seven months' data have been
influenced by abnormal weather.</p>
<p>Mr. Martini says GNP could "accelerate substantially" in
coming months as spending patterns adjust. But no one expects
the kind of wallop the drought gave GNP last year. In fact,
economists like Georgia State's Donald Ratajczak expect tamer
1990 food inflation of around 4%. There will be isolated
problems, like those chickens who are suffering the
Southeast's dry heat wave, eating poorly and growing thinner.
But there's a silver lining in the "watermelon belt": Mr.
Ratajczak notes that dryness means smaller, but sweeter
melons. "So, they'll actually taste better."</p>
<p>Weather accounts for 15% to 50% of mood, a study of park
rangers by a University of Wisconsin professor finds.</p>
<p>GARBO AT GAVEL: The actress's Impressionist paintings,
books and furnishings go on the block at Sotheby's in
November; they're expected to fetch $20 million.</p>
<p>DUMP AND BE DUMPED. About 25% of New York State consumers
polled in June said they stopped buying from firms they think
pollute, says Century Research.</p>
<p>HOLD THE OLIVE: One-pound "Water Weights" carry liquid in
plastic bottles for exercise now and refreshment later. Price
per pair: $9.95.</p>
<p>"SUMMER MELT" in tuition deposits deepens; schools
struggle with shortfall.</p>
<p>A demographic turn shrinks the number of available college
freshmen, putting the choosy student on top. Many Ivy League
schools called back "second string" prospects in May and
June, sparking a chain reaction of backing and filling among
institutions. "People are still jockeying around. It's a
buyer's market," says Joe Foulke of Iona College, in New
Rochelle, N.Y. "It puts a kink in planning." With hiring and
spending plans at stake, it's smart to run a tight shop. This
summer, if a question arises on a student form, Iona phones
the student rather than writes. And the school recently fired
up its television ads.</p>
<p>At Fairleigh Dickinson in Rutherford, N.J., deposits are
currently down 8%, says William DiBrienza. But he notes
that's well ahead of mid-May's 25% shortfall, adding: "The
financial aid situation very much determines who attends here
and who doesn't." York College in Pennsylvania says it was
flooded with deposits in April and May. The school attributes
at least part of its good fortune to its below-average cost.
One notable bright spot in the college crunch: enrollment at
black colleges soars.</p>
<p>A new guide, "Barron's 300: Best Buys in College
Education," is due out in mid-August. Price: $12.95.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: Dallas-based Auto Critic checks out used cars for
buyers. . . . Frosty Paws finds over 10% of polled pet owners
say they're as attached to their dogs as their spouses; 3%
add their dogs can sing.</p>
