	<p class="article-leader">The United Steelworkers of America knew 1990 would be
tough.
   The union faces contract talks with the industry's most
combative negotiator, USX Corp. At the same time, it must
beef up efforts to find new dues-paying members to replace
thousands laid off in the 1980s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The year just got tougher. Last week, two high-ranking
union officials were found guilty of conspiracy and
violations of the Taft-Hartley Act. The government said the
union officials, along with USX, which was found guilty of 14
related counts, received secret pension benefits as part of a
conspiracy to win significant concessions in 1983. The
trend-setting pact ultimately resulted in reopening USX's
then-idled Fairfield, Ala., plant.</p>
<p>Labor experts say the convictions could strain what
already promise to be tense negotiations with the nation's
largest steelmaker. More important, the convictions could
hurt the union's credibility among some rank-and-file
members, still smarting from such concessionary contracts.</p>
<p>Although both the company and union say they're confident
the convictions will be overturned, the damage is largely
done. Buddy Davis, a union director, says that convictions
make big news, while reversals don't. Moreover, he says,
"even though I'm confident the charges will be dropped,
you'll still have people talking behind their {union
officials'} backs saying, `They got off the hook.' "</p>
<p>The timing couldn't have been worse. The USW had finally
begun to get back on its feet after a decade marred by
layoffs and divisive elections for top officials. It had
become more militant -- weathering a tough strike against USX
in 1986, its first in 26 years -- and more progressive by
creating employee-owned plants. Furthermore, membership had
stopped its downward spiral in recent years, and last year
the union negotiated rich contracts with four major
steelmakers.</p>
<p>"In the last five years, we've pulled together and gotten
a lot more unity," says Mr. Davis. "This is the last thing we
need."</p>
<p>Some rank-and-file members, feeling cheated, have already
sued the union. A group in Birmingham, Ala., seeking wages
and benefits lost in the concessions, claims the union
breached not only its fiduciary duty but its duty of fair
representation. And Larry Regan, president of Local 1014 in
Gary, Ind., plans to file a second suit. He said the
Fairfield pact set a pattern of concessions -- including
reducing work crews to unsafe levels -- for future contracts
at plants around the country. "You had people committing
suicides and being injured because of these concessions," he
says.</p>
<p>The union already is seeing the impact on its efforts to
gain and retain members. At O'Neal Steel Inc. in Birmingham,
where 250 union members in four plants voted to decertify the
union, the indictments against the union officials became a
campaign issue. "We certainly weren't bashful about
mentioning it," says Raymond Lindsey, O'Neal's vice president
of human resources.</p>
<p>Andrew Turner, who was the local president until the
decertification, says members were more concerned about job
security than about the indictment. "But this hurt. Some
members said they didn't want a bunch of crooks representing
them," he says.</p>
<p>The union has warned its organizers that companies would
use the conviction as an anti-union club. "I'm sure this is
going to bite us in some places," says Mr. Davis. Membership
in his own district has dropped to 18,000 from a high of
36,000 a decade ago, and he has fewer staff members trying to
organize a larger number of small plants.</p>
<p>One point the union is stressing in its defense is that
most companies offer pension benefits to union officials --
which the court has deemed illegal. A Department of Labor
survey found that 62% of U.S. manufacturers provide such
benefits to labor representatives even though they're
employed by unions.</p>
<p>Carl Frankel, a USW staff attorney, says the convictions
"won't cause us to lose an {organizing} election that
otherwise we'd win. No doubt we'll have to deal with this,
but we've had other challenges, and we'll get through this
one."</p>
<p>How last week's verdict will play out with USX
negotiations isn't quite clear, but some people say the union
and USX, both fearing any cozy appearance, might be more
hard-nosed than normal.</p>
<p>The Steelworkers want to pattern contracts after one
signed last year by Bethlehem Steel Corp., the first major
steelmaker to reach an accord. USX has already scoffed at the
pact, calling it "too generous." Moreover, the company is
willing to sell its steel operations at the right price, and
it can threaten during talks to do so to a less
union-friendly company.</p>
<p>Ben Fischer, director of the Center for Labor Studies at
Carnegie Mellon University, fears that the ruling will ban
nearly all collaborative arrangements, even if they benefit
rank-and-file workers and employers. It could also taint any
concessionary contract, even when it's needed for a company
to survive.</p>
<p>"The only thing that becomes safe is arms-length
adversarial relationships," he said. "That way, even though
you may destroy the institution, you protect yourselves."</p>
<p>Labor experts also warn that the convictions could
increase friction between top USW officials and local plant
presidents, making it more difficult for the union to
solidify its negotiating stance against USX. Local leaders
have always wanted more control over individual plant issues,
such as holidays, contracting out and maintenance schedules,
but with the convictions they may feel more justified in
distancing themselves from headquarters.</p>
<p>"There has always been friction," said economist Don
Barnett. "This just means more mistrust."</p>
