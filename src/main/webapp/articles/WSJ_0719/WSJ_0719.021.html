	<p class="article-leader">ORANGE, Calif. -- Bergen Brunswig Corp. said its longtime
chief executive officer, Emil P. Martini Jr., will retire on
Aug. 31.
   Mr. Martini, who will be 62 years old on Aug. 9, will
remain chairman. "It won't be merely a ceremonial function,"
a spokesman for the drug and videocassette distribution
concern said. "He will continue to be available."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Martini will be succeeded as chief executive by his
58-year-old brother, Robert E. Martini, who will remain
Bergen Brunswig president and relinquish the post of chief
operating officer to Dwight A. Steffensen, 46, who also will
remain executive vice president.</p>
<p>Emil Martini spent "all of his working life" at Bergen
Brunswig or its predecessor, Bergen Drug Co., which was
founded by the brothers' father, the spokesman said. Bergen
Brunswig's sales have jumped to more than $4 billion from
about $200 million since the merger of Bergen Drug and
Brunswig Drug Co. in 1969. Emil Martini was named chief
executive in 1970.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Bergen Brunswig Class A shares closed at $28.75, down 37.5
cents.</p>
