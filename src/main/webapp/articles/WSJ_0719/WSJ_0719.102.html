	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber
opened contract talks with General Motors Corp. by vowing to
"change the way GM does business" so that no more union
members lose their jobs.
   But Alfred S. Warren, GM's vice president and top labor
negotiator, replied that the company wants the union to
accept measures that will cut costs in the auto maker's
parts-making operations. GM also wants the union's help in
narrowing the approximately $560-per-car gap between GM's
health-care costs and those of U.S. assembly factories
operated by Japanese auto makers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both Mr. Bieber and Mr. Warren said they want to resolve
their differences and produce a new, three-year contract
before the current pact ends Sept. 14.</p>
<p>Union bargainers will push for job guarantees that will
force GM to lay off salaried workers before UAW members, Mr.
Bieber said.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Warren declined to be specific about GM's
proposals for cutting labor costs in its parts businesses,
the vice president said, "If the union offered me a lower
wage scale (for parts workers) I'd take it." GM parts workers
now earn the same average $15.74 hourly wage as assembly
workers -- well above the average pay at competitive, non-GM
parts operations.</p>
<p>As for health benefits, Mr. Warren said current UAW plans
add about $622 to the cost of each vehicle GM builds, which
compares to about $60 for U.S-built Japanese vehicles.</p>
