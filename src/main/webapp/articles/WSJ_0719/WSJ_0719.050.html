	<p class="article-leader">Loan problems continue to dog the banking industry, as
four big banks reported lower second-quarter profit and
Continental Bank Corp. posted a $56.7 million loss.
   The depressed earnings at PNC Financial Corp., Shawmut
National Corp., Fleet/Norstar Financial Group and First
Interstate Bancorp are all the result of big portfolios of
problem loans. Continental's troubled loans to highly
leveraged borrowers, meanwhile, tripled during the quarter
while income from corporate lending plunged 25%, reflecting
the current doldrums in the commercial banking business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Where earnings go from here is a function of when we get
out of this funk," said Robert Albertson, a bank stock
analyst at Goldman Sachs & Co. in New York.</p>
<p>Continental's second-quarter loss also includes a $48
million pretax charge to cover the cost of cutting 900 jobs
and retreating from some businesses, as well as some other
one-time losses and a gain. But a spokeswoman said that,
omitting such special items, Continental was essentially at
"break-even" for the quarter.</p>
<p>The loss, which had been expected, was a steep slide from
last's year second-quarter profit and illustrates the
potential pitfalls of the Chicago-based company's strategy
under Thomas C. Theobald of being a purely commercial bank.
Continental's presence remains small in some commercial areas
-- foreign exchange and bond trading, and equity investments
-- that help sustain its competitors during periods of weak
loan demand. And it has no consumer business.</p>
<p>Mr. Theobald said he remains committed to the strategy and
blamed the "general slowdown in demand" for the poor quarter.
The job and other cost cutting is expected to save $75
million a year, beginning next year, Continental has
estimated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the financial bleeding from Continental's First
Options of Chicago unit continued. For sale since last year,
First Options' value was marked down another $9 million
during the second quarter. That brings to well over a quarter
billion dollars the losses from the options and futures
clearing firm since Continental bought in it late 1986.</p>
<p>First Options had big losses during the 1987 stock market
crash and its revenue has dwindled since.</p>
<p>Continental's nonperforming loans to highly leveraged
borrowers, such as in leveraged buy-outs, tripled to $251
million at June 30 from $83 million at the beginning of the
quarter. The bank wouldn't elaborate on the borrowers or
their problems or say how leveraged loans are expected to
perform in coming quarters.</p>
<p>While Continental's total nonperforming loans, at $673
million, are relatively low, it has a big highly leveraged
portfolio, $2.9 billion at year-end 1989, in comparison to
its shareholders equity of about $1.7 billion.</p>
<p>Continental's income from commercial lending and other
corporate finance transactions fell 25% to $111 million in
the second quarter, vs. $148 million a year ago. That
reflects the smaller number of acquisitions and refinancings,
as well as the fact that today's more conservative lending
environment also makes deals less lucrative for banks. "The
deals aren't yielding as much," a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>PNC Financial Corp.</p>
<p>PNC Financial, based in Pittsburgh, as expected, said
second-quarter profit fell 13% as domestic loans continued to
deteriorate. It was the third consecutive quarter that PNC,
known for years by its steady earnings growth, has seen
profit fall.</p>
<p>The bank took a huge $168.3 million in net charge-offs,
mostly foreign loans and domestic real estate loans. But new
problem loans replaced the old ones charged off; since March
nonperforming domestic loans have surged 16%, to $560
million.</p>
<p>"When you charge off that much and nonperformers don't go
down, it shows how sticky the problem is," said Dennis F.
Shea, analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co.</p>
<p>PNC increased its provisions for loan losses 88%, to $73.8
million, compared with the year-ago quarter. The jump follows
an even bigger increase in provisions last quarter, but PNC
said the moves are simply a sign of the times. "We have
eliminated LCD debt and are aggressively writing down real
estate values to dispose of these properties as quickly as
possible," said Thomas H. O'Brien, PNC's chairman and chief
exeuctive officer.</p>
<p>First Interstate Bancorp</p>
<p>First Interstate said profit would have been flat absent a
special tax credit in the 1989 quarter. The company cited
improved credit quality: nonperforming assets declined to
$1.88 billion at June 30 from $2.24 billion a year earlier.
Its provision for loan losses in the quarter declined to
$117.7 million from $166.5 million.</p>
<p>Much of the credit turnaround reflects a nearly tripling
of profit in operations at its Texas bank over the first
quarter. "We continue to make steady progress in improving
key areas of our business," said Edward Carson, chairman and
chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Los Angeles-based banking concern still
reported several sore spots in its interstate network. Its
Arizona bank continued in the red. The company said its banks
in California, Oregon, Washington and Nevada continue to
"perform well," although profit from consumer and
middle-market lending operations at those banks was
essentially flat from the first-quarter level.</p>
<p>And profit at its other 17 banks, primarily in the Rocky
Mountains, tumbled to $1.5 million from $16.8 million a year
earlier, reflecting increased loan-loss reserves at its
Denver bank.</p>
<p>Per-share net income fell more significantly because of a
major stock offering in February.</p>
<p>Shawmut National Corp.</p>
<p>Shawmut National's results were hurt by the continuing
slump in the New England economy, and its troubled real
estate sector. Nonperforming loans were up, and earning
assets were down.</p>
<p>Nonperforming loans and foreclosed property rose to $1.31
billion, or 7.72% of the total, from $1.16 billion, or 6.76%,
as of March 31. Shawmut's reserves for possible loan losses
were $748.3 million at the end of the second quarter compared
with $287 million at the end of the year-ago period.</p>
<p>The latest second-quarter's profit included an
extraordinary credit of $5.1 million from a tax loss
carry-forward. Total assets were $26.6 billion at the end of
the quarter, down 4.8% from the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Fleet/Norstar Financial</p>
<p>Fleet/Norstar's nonperforming loans rose to $756 million
from $653 million at the end of the first quarter.</p>
<p>Fleet's loan-loss provision for the second quarter was $90
million, nearly three times the year-ago provision. Its total
loan-loss reserve rose to $618 million.</p>
<p>The second quarter neverthless was a rebound from a $98
million loss in the first quarter due to a big increase in
the loan loss reserves. Fleet said its overall performance
was aided by a 31% increase in net income of its financial
services group to $31.2 million or more than half the bank
holding company's net income.</p>
