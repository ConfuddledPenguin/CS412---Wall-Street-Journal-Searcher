	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Two barges collided at an Exxon Corp. loading
dock, spilling 40,000 gallons of heating oil into a busy
shipping channel in New York Harbor.
   The accident occurred when one of the barges, which had
finished loading at Exxon's Bayway refinery, was being
maneuvered by two tug boats into the Arthur Kill shipping
channel and rammed another barge that was unloading nearby.
No Exxon personnel were involved.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Oil spewed from a gash at least 15 feet long as the vessel
was returned to the dock. Half of the spilled oil escaped
into the Arthur Kill before booms to contain it could be laid
out.</p>
<p>The barges and tug boats are owned by Maritrans Partners
L.P. of Philadelphia. Maritran Chairman Stephan Van Dyck,
visiting the site of the accident yesterday, said his company
is taking full responsibility for causing the accident and
would assume the full cost of cleanup.</p>
<p>Regulators said that fines could run into hundreds of
thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>The incident marks the 13th time oil has been dumped into
the busy harbor this year. Three of the spills have been
considered major, exceeding 100,000 gallons of oil. At least
three have occurred at or near Exxon's Bayway refinery,
including a massive spill of more than 500,000 gallons in
January, when an underwater pipeline at the refinery
ruptured.</p>
<p>The refinery was closed from late March until June for an
inspection to see if there was anything inherently wrong with
the facility or its operations. The results of that study
identified some operating problems and established procedures
to correct them.</p>
<p>Coast Guard Lt. Raymond Maher said he doubted that
yesterday's collision would spark a re-examination of
operations at the refinery.</p>
<p>Although only one of 10 storage tanks on the barge was
ruptured, the entire cargo was unloaded at the dock. A
Massachusetts company called Astro-Line owns the oil, which
it had just purchased from Exxon.</p>
<p>The spill didn't appear to cause significant damage to the
marine environment, according to a Coast Guard spokeswoman,
and booms were put around sensitive areas to keep the oil
out. "Because it's light oil, much of it will evaporate
quickly," she said.</p>
<p>However, that evaporation may have caused an air-quality
violation, according to Anthony McMahon, an official with New
Jersey's Department of Environmental Protection. He explained
that shortly after the accident, air-quality monitors near
the refinery registered a jump in the ozone level.</p>
<p>Although regulators expressed frustration with yesterday's
incident, they said the response was impressive. Shortly
after the spill occurred, a cleanup crew of 170 was on the
scene. Three Coast Guard boats showed up, and three skimmers
were scooping up the spilled fuel. Five vacuum trucks along
the shoreline were removing oil from the water as well. At
some other oil spills, Mr. McMahon said, "it's taken up to 20
hours to get a skimmer on the scene."</p>
