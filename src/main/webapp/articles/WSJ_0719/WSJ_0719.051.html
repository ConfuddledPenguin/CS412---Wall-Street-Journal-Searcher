	<p class="article-leader">American Petrofina Inc. registered record earnings for the
second quarter, suggesting that major oil companies with
large exposure to gasoline refining will also post gains but
that overall industry profits will be mixed.
   A roughly $3-a-barrel drop in the price of crude last
quarter from a year earlier depressed exploration and
production results across the board. Natural-gas prices and
sales were also down. But that same decline in crude prices
boosted refining and marketing profits because oil is the
primary feedstock for gasoline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With many refineries shut down for maintenance last
quarter, demand was strong enough to keep gasoline prices
fairly steady, said Warren Shimmerlik, a securities analyst
with County NatWest USA in New York. As a result, he
estimated that refinery margins on gasoline were about $4.60
a barrel, more than $1 greater than the 1989 second period.</p>
<p>Fina, based in Dallas, said net income rose 29% to $53.8
million, or $3.48 a share, from $41.8 million, or $2.71 a
share, a year earlier. Revenue declined 1.7% to $832.6
million from $847.4 million. "Lower crude-oil prices, only
partially offset by lower product prices, contributed to
higher refining margins," said Ron W. Haddock, chief
executive officer.</p>
<p>Of the nation's largest oil companies, Chevron Corp. and
Texaco Inc. could post record refining and marketing results
and year-to-year increases in overall net income, said Bryan
Jacoboski, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York. For
the industry, "it's going to be a mixed bag," he said.</p>
<p>Fina said results for petrochemicals, which also use crude
as their primary feedstock, were flat. However, analysts
expect most large oil companies to report declines in
petrochemical earnings. Through the first half of 1989
chemical profits and prices were at or near record highs but
have since fallen because of increased supplies.</p>
<p>Early in the third quarter it appears that exploration and
production profits will strengthen because crude prices have
recovered in recent weeks. But the quarter may be weaker than
the second, analysts said, because oil prices may not have
recovered enough to offset the expected declines in refining
and marketing.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading, American
Petrofina closed at $76, down 62.5 cents.</p>
