	<p class="article-leader">SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said
it placed about $566 million of Central Illinois Public
Service Co.'s long-term debt and preferred stock under review
for a ratings downgrade.
   The rating concern said it will examine "whether a recent
weakening in debt protection measures, continuing regulatory
delays, as well as growing business and operating risks in
the electric utility, will permit CIPS to maintain Moody's
highest rating."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moody's said it will look at a revenue-refund order the
company faces. It also noted that current industry and
regulatory trends mean "the ability of any electric utility
to maintain financial indicators supportive of the Aaa rating
may be in doubt."</p>
<p>Under review are Central Illinois PS's first mortgage
bonds and secured pollution-control bonds, rated triple-A;
unsecured pollution-control bonds and preferred stock, rated
double-A-1. The utility's commercial paper, rated prime-1,
isn't under review.</p>
<p>A Central Illinois PS official said that "within the last
two months, three of the five triple-A-rated utilities have
been downgraded," leaving only Central Illinois PS and
Citizens Utilities Co. of Stamford, Conn., with Moody's
highest rating.</p>
<p>"We're certainly concerned" about the possible downgrading
and the "uncertainty" it creates for shareholders, the
official said. At the same time, he said, "We also understand
Moody's interest in examining the entire electric utility
industry to determine if present-day business risks endanger
the triple-A rating of any company."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Central Illinois PS shares closed at $21.125, down 25 cents.</p>
