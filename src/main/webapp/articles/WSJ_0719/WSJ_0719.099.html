	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French stockbrokerage Tuffier-Ravier-Py &
Associes said it will file for bankruptcy following the
failure of its last-minute attempt to find a backer.
   The demise of Tuffier-Ravier-Py will be the largest
bankruptcy in the French stock market and provides the first
test for the bourse authorities' 200-millionfranc ($36.3
million) guarantee fund set up in 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The broker is one of the largest French stockbrokers and
is part of Tuffier & Associes, an independent diversified
financial services company controlled by Thierry Tuffier.</p>
<p>The Paris Bourse on Friday suspended Tuffier-Ravier-Py
from all stock trading because it was unable to pay its
bills. Mr. Tuffier said last week that the group's brokerage
arm had run up heavy losses this year due to a squeeze on its
margins since fixed commissions were abolished last year as
part of France's 1988 stock-market reforms. He said then that
all French brokers had been hit similarly by the lower
commissions and by a fall in volume this year on the stock
market.</p>
<p>But rival French brokers said that Mr. Tuffier's problems
spring in large part from his group's over-ambitious
expansion as it diversified into financial futures, corporate
finance, money-market trading and other new fields.</p>
<p>Mr. Tuffier said this week that his firm now needed loans
of up to 300 million francs to stay on its feet.</p>
