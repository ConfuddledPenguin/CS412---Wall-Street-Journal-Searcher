	<p class="article-leader">Supercomputing Solutions Inc. said its loss widened to
$1.1 million, or 17 cents a share in the second quarter, and
said it plans to cut its staff by 50% and take other
cost-cutting steps due to "an uncomfortable cash position."
   In the year-earlier period, the San Diego-based maker and
seller of supercomputers and software reported a loss of
$743,836, or 17 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the recent quarter, revenues more than doubled to
$738,723 from $360,752. The gains were due to the company's
completion of a subcontract for the initial phase of the
Direct Solution of Turbulence Program for the Department of
Defense and the completion and sale of the company's first
CAPPS-9064 supercomputer to TRW Inc.</p>
<p>However, the company said research and development costs
linked to the CAPPS-9064 resulted in significant losses,
leaving the company in an "uncomfortable cash position."</p>
<p>The company said its cost-saving efforts will include
cutbacks in travel and capital-equipment expenditures as well
as the curtailment of a research grant to Princeton
University.</p>
