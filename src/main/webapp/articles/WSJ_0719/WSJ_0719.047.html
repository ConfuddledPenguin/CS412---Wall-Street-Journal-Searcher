	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Chemical Banking Corp. said it structured an
asset-backed commercial-paper program for Allied Stores
Corp., the big retailer that is operating under protection of
the bankruptcy court.
   Chemical said it marks the first time that a company
operating under Chapter 11 would be able to sell commercial
paper. Investors usually buy commercial paper, or short-term
IOUs, only from the most credit-worthy corporations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chemical said Allied's commercial paper will be
securitized by the credit-card receivables of various Allied
retail stores, which along with Federated Department Stores
Inc. filed for protection against creditors in January. They
are both units of Canada's Campeau Corp., which is headed by
Robert Campeau.</p>
<p>The offering must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Cincinnati, which will meet to discuss the proposed
transaction on July 26, according to a Chemical Bank
spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Chemical said the new arrangement will replace Allied's
existing $700 million receivables loan facility with
Citibank, which was scheduled to expire July 31, and will
result in an annual cost savings to Allied of about $10
million.</p>
<p>Although Chemical is structuring the deal, it won't be
issuing the commercial paper. Mason Funding Corp., an
independent special-purpose corporation, authorized an
initial three-year program of $650 million in commercial
paper, which may be increased to $721 million.</p>
<p>The commercial paper will be backed by a surety bond
issued by Financial Guaranty Insurance Corp., a unit of
General Electric Co., and a 15% letter of credit from
Chemical Bank and a consortium of other institutions. Because
of these "credit enhancement" features, Allied's commercial
paper is expected to be rated A-1 plus by Standard & Poor's
Corp. and P-1 by Moody's Investors Service Inc.</p>
