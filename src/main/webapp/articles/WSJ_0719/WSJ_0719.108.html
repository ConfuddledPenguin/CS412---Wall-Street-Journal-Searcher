	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- U.S. companies' acquisitions of foreign
concerns declined in the first half because of tighter credit
conditions and fears about slower economic growth, according
to a survey by KPMG, the accounting firm.
   The number of acquisitions declined to 124 from 213 in the
1989 first half, and the dollar total fell to $8.1 billion
from $11.4 billion. The drop in dollars would have been even
steeper except for Philip Morris Cos.' plan to buy Jacobs
Suchard AG of Switzerland, an agreement that accounted for
more than a third of the total in the 1990 first half.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The number of acquisitions by foreign companies in the
U.S. also fell, to 338 from 392 in the 1989 half. The dollar
total, however, continued to dwarf the value of U.S.
purchases abroad, as it rose to $27.9 billion from $23.9
billion.</p>
<p>KPMG cited Swedish and Japanese companies as showing
especially large increases in cross-border acquisitions.
Swedish companies announced 71 transactions in the first half
totaling $8.5 billion, well above the year-earlier 51
transactions totaling $700 million. KPMG said it expects
Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland to be active on the
acquisition front in Europe to improve their position in
advance of the formation of a highly unified European market
in 1992. Japanese cross-border purchases increased to 114
from 70 and to $5.3 billion from $2.9 billion.</p>
