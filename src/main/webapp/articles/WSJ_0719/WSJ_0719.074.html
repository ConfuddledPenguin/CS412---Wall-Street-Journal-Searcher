	<p class="article-leader">U.S. Secretary of State James Baker emerged yesterday from
a meeting in Paris with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze with what's been greeted as a major policy
shift. He announced that the U.S. would drop its recognition
of the Cambodian resistance and start talking with Vietnam
about how to solve Cambodia's miseries. He explained, "We
want to talk to Vietnam because we think it has influence
with the Cambodian government to create conditions for
elections."
   Well, it's no secret that Indochina's political byways can
be confusing. And clearly Mr. Baker has in mind a worthy
goal: preventing the return of the Khmer Rouge, who conducted
genocidal terrors from the time of the U.S. withdrawal from
Indochina until the Vietnamese conquest of Cambodia. Our own
sources in Thailand support the State Department's conclusion
that right now the Khmer Rouge, who have been cultivating a
village-level support network in the rural countryside, stand
a good chance of again seizing power. The two non-communist
Cambodian resistance groups, led by Prince Sihanouk and
former Premier Son Sann, are far weaker and less
well-organized. While they have a claim to Western support as
the only conceivably democratic alternative, in fact they may
well be doing little more than smoothing the way for the
Khmer Rouge to make a hideous comeback in Phnom Penh.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But this is not a game that pits the bad Khmer Rouge
against the good Vietnamese-backed regime of Premier Hun Sen,
himself a renegade Khmer Rouge official. Both players are
monstrous villains by the lights of civilized conduct. It is
12 years of Vietnamese occupation that have made the vicious
Khmer Rouge, for all too many Cambodians, the only viable
defenders of the Cambodian nation. And despite the announced
pullout last fall, there have been reliable reports of the
continued presence of Vietnamese troops.</p>
<p>In any event, Vietnam's Communists have never, anywhere,
ever, done anything to create conditions for democracy -- not
even in Vietnam, and certainly not in Laos or Cambodia. The
idea that Vietnam is now going to help set up democracy in
Cambodia is one of the strangest we've heard yet. Cambodia
presents Mr. Baker with a choice of devils, but there's
little point in avoiding one by leaping into the arms of the
other. For the moment, Cambodia may be one of the world's
impossible problems.</p>
<p>It could be, of course, that the biggest shift here is
really an unstated U.S. step toward normalizing relations
with Vietnam. This would be quite a coup for Hanoi, which has
conceded nothing. Vietnam's Communists continue to run one of
the world's most repressive states, beggaring their own
people, bullying their neighbors and hosting a massive Soviet
military base at Cam Ranh Bay. Does America really want to
broadcast the message that these folks are now its chosen
champions in Indochina?</p>
<p>When it comes to helping Cambodia, indeed, we have a
radical thought. Granted that Vietnam sets the tenor for
Indochina, wouldn't the best hope for democracy in the
dominoes lie in holding real elections in Vietnam? Maybe Mr.
Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze could make that their next
project.</p>
