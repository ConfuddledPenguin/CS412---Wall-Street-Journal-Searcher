	<p class="article-leader">Investors poured another $3.2 billion into money-market
mutual funds in the latest week, as yields remained nearly
unchanged.
   Assets of 430 taxable funds totaled $382.4 billion at the
close of business Tuesday, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money
Fund Report. The average seven-day compound yield, which
assumes reinvestment of dividends, remained at 7.95%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Martha Wittbrodt, editor of the Holliston, Mass.-based
newsletter, predicted that yields will begin to slide in the
next few weeks, reflecting the Federal Reserve's recent
easing of interest rates. She said money-fund yields could
decline a tenth of a percentage point or so over the next
three to four weeks.</p>
<p>Average yields on taxable funds have been at or just below
8% for most of this year.</p>
<p>Most of the new money added to the funds in the week ended
Tuesday -- about $2.5 billion -- came from institutions,
Donoghue's reported. Ms. Wittbrodt said institutions that
took money out of the funds several weeks ago, when yields on
competing investments were slightly higher, may be putting it
back in now that those yields are falling. Yields on
three-month Treasury bills sold at Monday's auction, for
instance, were 7.88%, compared with 8.05% in late June.</p>
<p>Money-fund yields typically lag behind general
interest-rate trends by a few weeks because portfolio
managers can vary the maturities of their investments to take
advantage of the best yields. The managers typically lengthen
maturities when rates are falling and shorten them when rates
are rising.</p>
<p>Average maturity of the taxable funds grew by one day in
the week ended Tuesday, to 44 days. That's within the range
of the last few months; average maturity has been as short as
29 days and as long as 53 days in recent years. Money funds
invest in such things as short-term Treasury securities,
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and bank
certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.66% from 7.67%. The average 30-day simple yield
also eased to 7.66% from 7.67% and the average 30-day
compound yield dipped to 7.95% from 7.97%.</p>
<p>Yields on tax-exempt funds fell faster. The average
seven-day compound yield of 224 tax-free funds fell to 5.23%
from 5.30%, Donoghue's reported. The latest yield is
equivalent to a taxable yield of 7.26% for an investor in the
28% tax bracket and 7.81% for someone paying 33% in taxes.</p>
<p>Assets of the tax-exempt funds remained flat at $78.9
billion. Average maturity lengthened by two days to 51 days.</p>
