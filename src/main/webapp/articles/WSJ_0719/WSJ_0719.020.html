	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Securities and Exchange Commission member
Mary Schapiro offered mild support for proposed legislation
that would beef up regulation of the financial-planning
industry.
   The bill, proposed by Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.), would
force better disclosure by people calling themselves
investment advisers and toughen penalties the SEC could
impose on wrongdoers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The legislation won't be considered seriously in this
legislative session, particularly because Republicans on the
House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance oppose
several of the bill's provisions. For example, Rep. Matthew
Rinaldo (R., N.J.) expressed concern that the bill would put
burdensome additional rules on already regulated insurance
agents, securities professionals, accountants and lawyers.</p>
<p>Ms. Schapiro, representing the SEC in testimony before the
subcommittee, also expressed concern about regulatory
overkill, but offered the agency's backing for stepped-up
oversight of financial planners. She said the agency needs to
raise fees charged on planners so that the SEC can afford to
do more inspections.</p>
<p>A recent GAO report criticized SEC oversight of the
financial-planning industry, contending that registering
planners may be doing "more harm than good." Ms. Schapiro
argued that the SEC does what it can given the relatively
small amount of money allocated, a point the GAO report also
made.</p>
