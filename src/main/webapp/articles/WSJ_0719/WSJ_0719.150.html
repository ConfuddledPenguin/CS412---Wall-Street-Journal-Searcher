	<p class="article-leader">The struggle for hearts and minds in the black community,
which ultimately will be more important than the civil-rights
bill Congress is debating, has recently grown a lot more
complicated.
   Growing numbers of blacks are calling for self-help,
independence, progress through education and black
enterprise. In Milwaukee, for example, state legislator Polly
Williams conceived a school voucher program for the poor. Bob
Woodson, who has led an effort to convert public housing to
tenant ownership, this week was awarded a MacArthur
Fellowship, known in some quarters as "the genius grant."
Former EEOC head Clarence Thomas, now a federal judge, and
economists like Thomas Sowell voice similar sentiments.
Shelby Steele, an essayist and teacher, has lately garnered
considerable attention for writting on race and the harm done
by affirmative-action programs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, grass-roots members of the black community are
showing some impatience with racism as the all-purpose excuse
for misbehavior, and with calls for racial solidarity at all
costs. Most especially, as the trial of Washington Mayor
Marion Barry accumulates evidence of drug use, a recent poll
showed blacks viewing the mayor negatively by a margin of 47%
to 19%.</p>
<p>On the other side are the militants who are calling,
essentially, for a new black separatism. They include people
like minister Louis Farrakhan, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and
lawyers Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox, who gave us the Tawana
Brawley story. Include in this number, also, those calling
for an Afro-centered school curriculum for black children.</p>
<p>Both groups pose challenges to traditional civil-rights
groups. Perhaps inevitably, that challenge has led to some
confusion -- the sort that was on display last week at the
NAACP's 81st annual convention, particularly by NAACP head
Benjamin Hooks. Throughout his career, Mr. Hooks has been
nothing if not eloquent about the responsibilities of black
leaders and image-makers. To take just one example, he
recently delivered a scathing denunciation of 2 Live Crew,
excoriating them particularly for trying to "wrap the mantle
of black cultural experience" around their "vicious and
sadistic" works. And in the course of his speech, Mr. Hooks
strongly attacked those who would use racism as an alibi for
the ills of the black community, and called for "a moratorium
on excuses."</p>
<p>Yet in his fire-and-brimstone speech, Mr. Hooks charged
that black elected officials were being subjected to
victimization and harassment, comparable to the post-Civil
War Reconstruction era. The victimized official he apparently
had in mind was none other than Mayor Barry, whose
prosecution Mr. Hooks presented as a typical instance of
racial harassment, despite evidence that is nothing short of
overwhelming.</p>
<p>Matters became still more confusing when at the same
convention, Mr. Hooks lashed out at black scholars who have
pointed out the harms that accompany affirmative action.
Referring to the scholars as "some of the biggest liars the
world ever saw," Mr. Hooks told a reporter, "They're just a
new breed of Uncle Toms as far as I'm concerned." Mr. Hooks
said he particularly resented one "lowdown dirty rascal" for
writing "a big story in a white magazine."</p>
<p>The particular dirty rascal Mr. Hooks seems to have had in
mind was Professor Steele, who recently wrote a piece
published in the New York Times Magazine. In it, Mr. Steele
argued forcefully against racial-entitlement programs. He
noted that racial-preference programs did not teach skills or
educate, but that they did "encourage blacks to exploit their
victimization" while also stigmatizing them with an implied
inferiority.</p>
<p>Mr. Hooks offers a melange of black attitudes, but it is
not clear for whom he actually speaks. Other influential
blacks were quick to take issue with some of his statements.
Columnist Carl Rowan wrote that Mr. Hooks encouraged
thousands of black youngsters at that convention "to wallow
in the absurd notion" that Mayor Barry was on trial because
of selective prosecution of black leaders. Is this
leadership, Mr. Rowan asked, "Or is it pandering to black
frustrations and hatred that are being fanned by Farrakhan
and those of his mentality?"</p>
<p>The confusion coming out of the NAACP convention is part
of a larger ferment that signals an important turn in the
road toward black progress, and one that is a lot more
significant than the rhetoric wafted about the halls of
Congress. Over the past generation, blacks in general and the
NAACP in particular have won important and well-deserved
victories. But surely there's room for more players and new
thinking when as earnest a leader as Mr. Hooks finds himself,
in the name of the black community, attacking Professor
Steele and defending Mayor Barry.</p>
