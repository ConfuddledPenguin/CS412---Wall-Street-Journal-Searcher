	<p class="article-leader">There's an old joke that goes something like this:
   A burly fellow walks into the doctor's office and says he
feels terrible and wonders why.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"You're fat," says the doctor.</p>
<p>The fellow is outraged. "I want a second opinion," he
says.</p>
<p>"OK," says the doctor, "you're ugly, too."</p>
<p>That was funny when you first heard it 10 years ago.
Today, it isn't. At least it isn't to that little band of
lawyers and newsmen who keep a close eye on the health of the
First Amendment. To them, what was funny 10 years ago is
frightening today.</p>
<p>For as of last month, a person has to keep his opinions to
himself -- or risk being sued.</p>
<p>Historically in this country, there has been no such thing
as a false opinion. Without fear, I could write an editorial
that said you were the worst mayor in the history of my city.
You could write a sports column that likened my tennis game
to your aunt's butterfly chasing. A cartoonist could depict a
politician as sinister and evil. A critic could compare a
singer's performance to the baying of my otter hound.</p>
<p>And you and I and the cartoonist and the critic would be
quite safe in saying what we said. The politician, the
athlete, the performer -- or your aunt and my otter hound --
just had to grin and bear it. A person's opinions were all
part of the uninhibited, robust and wide-open debate that
characterizes free speech in this country.</p>
<p>At first, it was the common law that protected us and our
opinions. Later, it was some state supreme courts. Finally,
it was the Supreme Court itself. "Under the First Amendment
there is no such thing as a false idea," the court said.
"However pernicious an opinion may seem, we depend for its
correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on
the competition of other ideas."</p>
<p>That was in 1974, and the only problem left was trying to
determine what was an opinion and what was a fact. But courts
developed guidelines for that, too, saying you had to look at
the language, the context, the social environment, and the
like. That was a problem, but not one that really threatened
free speech. The rules were pretty clear, the lines well
drawn.</p>
<p>It was in 1974, too, that the Maple Heights High School
Mustangs and the Mentor High Cardinals squared off in an Ohio
wrestling match that led to a melee of sorts. Michael
Milkovich was the coach of the Maple Heights team, the home
team, and Ted Diadiun was a sports writer for the News-Herald
in Lorain. Mr. Diadiun thinks Mr. Milkovich ranted and raved
and egged on the crowd.</p>
<p>Mr. Milkovich was called before a high school sports
governing body, which put him on probation. He appealed to a
court, which overturned the board's ruling. Mr. Diadiun was
even less impressed with Mr. Milkovich's performance during
the proceedings than he was with the performance at the
wrestling meet. So Mr. Diadiun wrote a column -- it was
labeled "TD Says" -- that said the sad lesson of the whole
incident was this: "If you get in a jam, lie your way out."
The headline on the column said:</p>
<p>Maple beat the law</p>
<p>with the `big lie'</p>
<p>Mr. Milkovich sued Mr. Diadiun and his newspaper, and thus
began what the Supreme Court called "an odyssey of litigation
spanning nearly 15 years."</p>
<p>The odyssey ended, sort of, June 21. The court unanimously
said that it never really meant there was no such thing as a
wrong opinion. What it really meant, the court said, was that
there was no such thing as a wrong idea. If an opinion
contains or implies a fact, the court said, the opinion has
to be defensible in court.</p>
<p>How's that again?</p>
<p>"If a speaker says, `In my opinion John Jones is a liar,'
he implies a knowledge of facts which lead to the conclusion
that Jones told an untruth," the court said in explaining
that opinions based on facts are litigable. "Even if the
speaker states the facts upon which he bases his opinion, if
those facts are either incorrect or incomplete, or if his
assessment of them is erroneous, the statement may still
imply a false assertion of fact. Simply couching such
statements in terms of opinion does not dispel these
implications; and the statement, `In my opinion Jones is a
liar,' can cause as much damage to reputation as the
statement, `Jones is a liar.'" Thus, Jones can sue and maybe
win.</p>
<p>However, the court went on, "the statement, `In my opinion
Mayor Jones shows his abysmal ignorance by accepting the
teachings of Marx and Lenin' would not be actionable. . . . A
statement of opinion relating to matters of public concern
which does not contain a provably false factual connotation
will receive full constitutional protection." So Jones can't
win that one.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>What this means, apparently, is this: If I state my
opinion clearly and succinctly, you can sue me. I can't get
the suit dismissed on the ground that it was merely an
opinion. We'll go to trial to determine whether my opinion
was based on facts, which, indeed, is what Messrs. Milkovich
and Diadiun may now have to do. If you can prove the facts
were wrong or incomplete, you can win a lot of money from me.</p>
<p>What this will lead to, once it sinks in in newsrooms and
law offices around the country, is mealy-mouthed editorials,
wishy-washy sports columns, punch-pulling cartoons and
namby-pamby reviews. It will lead to sentences like, "In my
opinion Mayor Jones shows his abysmal ignorance by accepting
the teachings of Marx and Lenin," and away from sentences
like, "Mayor Jones is a dumb Red."</p>
<p>To be sure, this dumb decision -- excuse me, this
decision, which appears to be based on a historical
perspective that some might find misguided or troubling or
based on abysmal ignorance -- won't topple democracy. But
neither will it enhance that "free flow of ideas and
opinions" that the court just two years ago said was "at the
heart of the First Amendment."</p>
<p>"Permitting people to express their emotions as well as
their thoughts is . . . a central purpose of the First
Amendment," Robert Sack, a lawyer who represents this
newspaper, among others, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief
that the big media companies (including my employer, NBC)
entered on behalf of Mr. Diadiun.</p>
<p>Mr. Sack is old enough to have been a fan of the Brooklyn
Dodgers, and he says that Mr. Diadiun's column brought back
memories of Ebbets Field and the Dodger fans yelling "We wuz
robbed."</p>
<p>"We wuz robbed," he says, "is not so different from what
sports columnist Diadiun was saying. It cannot be put to a
true/false test without endangering the ability of reporters
and fans to get mad, to participate fully in the tumult and
shouting of American spectator sports."</p>
<p>That was written before the Supreme Court ruled, of
course. But the analogy is apt. For if there's one thing
that's clear from the decision, it's this:</p>
<p>We wuz robbed.</p>
