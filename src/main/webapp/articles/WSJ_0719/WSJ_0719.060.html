	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices sagged in response to news that
inflation is by no means whipped, helping drag stocks lower.
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell nearly one point,
or about $10 for each $1,000 of face amount. Trading was
frenzied in the morning but quieter in the afternoon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stocks also were hit by profit-taking and earnings
disappointments. The Dow Jones Industrial Average backed away
from its flirtation with 3000, dropping 18.07 to 2981.68. The
dollar ended mixed, reflecting currency traders' less-certain
interpretation of the inflation news.</p>
<p>The bond market was jarred early by news that the consumer
price index for June rose 0.5%, compared with an expected
increase of 0.3%. Later in the morning came comments from
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said, among
other things, that he is now slightly more concerned about
the risk of recession than about the risk of rising
inflation.</p>
<p>The remarks set bond investors to worrying that Mr.
Greenspan is responding to political pressure to ease
interest rates instead of sticking to his goal of reducing
inflation. While bond investors like to see interest rates
come down, which boosts bond prices commensurately, they fear
creeping inflation even more because it erodes real returns
on their investments.</p>
<p>Bond traders were puzzled that the CPI came in as high as
it did and a few hours later Mr. Greenspan suggested
inflation fell a notch on his priority list.</p>
<p>Though "the CPI report took a half-point {off bond prices}
right away," said Stephen Slifer, economist at Shearson
Lehman Hutton, traders also were concerned about a news
report that House Republican budget conferees decided to
oppose any tax increases as part of a deficit-reduction
accord.</p>
<p>"That could be a monkey wrench in the budget talks," Mr.
Slifer said. Hopes for further credit-easing moves by the Fed
have been tied to a successful deficit-cutting effort.</p>
<p>But anything that prevents further Fed easing is good news
for the dollar. Currency traders say falling U.S. interest
rates are a greater immediate threat to the dollar's strength
than inflation fears.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices fell in active trading, with 168.8 million
shares changing hands on the New York Stock Exchange, where
decliners swamped advancers, 1,030 to 483.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond
rose to 8.54%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6480 marks and 147.75 yen, compared
with 1.6440 marks and 147.80 yen Tuesday.</p>
