	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp. reported
second-quarter net income more than doubled, as expected, but
shocked analysts by saying third-quarter results may trail
last year's.
   In a meeting with analysts that ended after the close of
stock trading, Lotus said its forecasts are "a little bit
more cautious" than analysts' predictions of 10% to 15% gains
in the third quarter. Robert Schechter, chief financial
officer, said in an interview, "We'll have a relatively tough
time getting to" the year-earlier earnings level.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lotus stock fell $2.875 to $31.25 in over-the-counter
trading before Mr. Schechter made his announcement. Analysts
predicted that the stock will fall further today. Rick
Sherlund, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Co., said the
third-quarter prediction "was a big surprise to people in the
room." He added: "I would expect to reiterate my sell
recommendation tomorrow."</p>
<p>Lotus's results have been strong for the past four
quarters, in the wake of its introduction in June 1989 of
upgraded versions of its best-selling 1-2-3 software program.
However, analysts had cautioned that gains would be smaller
in future quarters.</p>
<p>Second-quarter net rose to $23.5 million, or 54 cents a
share, from $10.3 million, or 25 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales rose 33% to $175.2 million from $132.2
million.</p>
<p>Mr. Schechter said that Lotus found the market for
spreadsheet programs is "getting more competitive." Both
industry giant Microsoft Inc. and Borland International Ltd.
have been selling their own spreadsheets vigorously,
competing against Lotus's product.</p>
<p>Mr. Schechter said that in "our mainstream business, we
don't see significant loss in share." However, he said the
spreadsheet market has expanded, and in new market areas such
as small business, "there has been a little bit of share
loss, but not in a significant way."</p>
<p>He declined to provide market-share numbers. Most analysts
estimate that Lotus holds between 60% and 70% of the
spreadsheet market.</p>
<p>Robert Therrien, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. who had
previously predicted that Lotus would see an earnings decline
in the third quarter, said "I'm not panicked," by the
competition. "I think there's a reasonable probability that
Lotus will get an injunction," stopping Borland from selling
its spreadsheet. As reported, Lotus has filed suit against
Borland charging copyright violation.</p>
<p>Mr. Schechter said that international sales rose 50%,
accounting for 46% of Lotus's business in the quarter.</p>
<p>Mr. Schecter's caution about the forthcoming quarter
reflects the continued strong competition and his assumption
that Lotus won't see significant revenue from its next
revision of 1-2-3 in the quarter. He also said he expects a
seasonal sales slump in Europe this year, in contrast to last
year, when revenue from upgraded versions offset the normal
summer slowdown.</p>
<p>Mr. Schecter said that after the third-quarter slump, he
expects fourth-quarter results to show improvement from the
year-earlier figures. However, Mr. Sherlund of Goldman Sachs
said, "It's very questionable whether the fourth quarter will
be up."</p>
