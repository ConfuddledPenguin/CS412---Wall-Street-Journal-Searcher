	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The credit quality of American companies fell
at a record pace in the first half, as soft real-estate
markets, weak junk-bond issuers and a sluggish economy
undercut corporate creditworthiness, Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said.
   Corporate downgrades led upgrades by a margin of 4.2 to 1
during the period. In 1989, downgrades led upgrades 2.5-1,
and during the 1982 recession year they led 2.8-1, according
to Moody's, a unit of Dun & Bradstreet Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The credit-rating concern said there are signs that the
quality of borrowers may start improving. Moody's said it's
reviewing 41 companies for possible downgrade and 15
companies for upgrade. That ratio, 2.7-1, is below the 3-1
ratio of possible downgrades to possible upgrades on Moody's
Watchlist at the start of the year.</p>
<p>"While both the economy and earnings growth may remain
lackluster for the remainder of 1990, a recession that could
put considerable stress on credit quality appears unlikely,"
said John Lonski, Moody's senior economist. "The frequency of
downgrades to upgrades may thus have bottomed out, although
there are few signs that any marked improvement in corporate
creditworthiness is at hand," he said.</p>
<p>In the first six months of 1990, rating downgrades
affected 217 companies and $235 billion of long-term debt,
while ratings of 52 companies were raised, affecting $50.5
billion of debt.</p>
