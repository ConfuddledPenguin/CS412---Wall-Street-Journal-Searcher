	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Two major newspaper publishers reported lower
earnings for the second quarter, reflecting a nationwide
slump in advertising so persistent it is now hurting one of
the industry's best performers.
   Gannett Co. and the New York Times Co., publishers of
daily newspapers in major cities as well as smaller markets,
had been expected to report lower earnings. Yet while the
falling ad market has battered the industry for at least a
year, Arlington, Va.-based Gannett's results were especially
noteworthy: It was the first time since going public in 1967
that it reported a quarterly earnings drop from the
comparable period a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gannett earnings were $105.3 million, or 66 cents per
share, compared with $112.1 million, or 70 cents, a year
earlier. Revenue fell 1% to $893.8 million from $904.2
million.</p>
<p>Gannett sold a radio station in Seattle, but it
represented only a "minor" gain, the company said.</p>
<p>Gannett executives blamed "continuing restructuring in the
retail industry and a deteriorating consumer economy" for
stalling the revenue growth. Major department stores, some
hit by bankruptcy reorganizations and consolidations, are
traditionally among Gannett's largest advertisers.</p>
<p>Troubling for all newspapers is that classified
advertising continues its fall, after years of robust growth
in the 1980s. Gannett said classified volume at most of its
83 daily newspapers declined for cars, real estate and help
wanted.</p>
<p>At Gannett's flagship, USA Today, the number of ad pages
in the first six months fell 9% to 1,780. Gannett said,
though, that ad rate increases and higher circulation
resulted in a revenue gain of 3% for the first half.
Gannett's outdoor advertising unit, the largest billboard
company in North America, reported an increase in revenue but
the broadcasting division, including radio and TV stations,
reported a decline.</p>
<p>Peter Appert, analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell
Inc., called Gannett's drop in revenue troubling. "Earnings
will continue to be under pressure if revenues continue in
this range," he said. "And there's nothing in the next
quarter that says it will turn around."</p>
<p>For the six months, Gannett said net fell 4% to $180.3
million, or $1.13 a share, from $187.0 million, or $1.16 a
share. Revenue for the first six months dropped 1% to $1.7
billion.</p>
<p>At the New York Times Co., still reeling from slumping ad
linage at its flagship daily, the earnings drop wasn't as
steep as some analysts had expected.</p>
<p>The company reported earnings of $26.8 million, or 35
cents a share, compared with $39.2 million, or 50 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter rose to $468.9
million from $460.3 million.</p>
<p>"We thought they might come in at about 27 cents, so it's
better than we expected," said Jeffrey Russell, an analyst
for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "They are holding the
margins as well as they can, considering the poor ad climate
in New York."</p>
<p>New York Times executives said the earnings drop was
largely a result of lower ad linage at the Times, brought on
by a weak New York area economy. Earnings also suffered from
the acquisition of McCall's magazine, and increased
depreciation and interest expense related to completion of
the Times's color printing plant in Edison, N.J. and a newly
constructed facility for the Gwinnett (Ga.) Daily News.</p>
<p>About 60% of the loss in ad linage at the Times was in
classified ads for help wanted, real estate and automotive.</p>
<p>For the six months, net income was $43.4 million, or 57
cents a share, compared with $70.7 million, or 90 cents a
share, last year. Revenue for the period grew by 2% to $900.1
million.</p>
