	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A senior executive of Freedlander Inc., the
Mortgage People, pleaded guilty to fraudulently obtaining
more than $200 million from the Federal National Mortgage
Association and other investors, the Justice Department said.
   Eve Freedlander, a member of the family that founded the
Richmond, Va.-based second-mortgage lender and that continues
to control it, filed the guilty plea yesterday in federal
court in Richmond, according to the Justice Department.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Neither Ms. Freedlander nor the other members of her
family who run Freedlander Inc. could be reached for comment
yesterday. Freedlander Inc. is the nation's fourth-largest
second-mortgage lender, the Justice Department said. It made
second-mortgage loans and packaged them into securities,
which it sold to institutional and private investors. The
company also serviced these loans on behalf of the investors
by collecting monthly payments and foreclosing on loans that
weren't repaid.</p>
<p>In a statement, U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson said that the
scheme involved the submission of false loan-performance
information to the Federal National Mortgage Association,
also known as Fannie Mae, and other buyers to induce them to
purchase the loans originated by Freedlander. He said the
company hid "the nonperforming nature of many of the loans
which it sold to encourage investors to continue to purchase
those loans."</p>
<p>Fannie Mae has filed a civil lawsuit against Freedlander
Inc., seeking more than $20 million in damages. Fannie Mae,
which runs a secondary market in home loans, purchased more
than $200 million of these loans from Freedlander Inc. from
November 1982 through August 1985. The suit is still pending,
Fannie Mae said.</p>
<p>Ms. Freedlander faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in
prison and $750,000 in fines.</p>
