	<p class="article-leader">Union Pacific Corp. said second-quarter earnings were flat
at $153 million, or $1.53 a share, compared with $152
million, or $1.41 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue climbed 9.2% to 1.78 billion, from $1.63 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Bethlehem, Pa., company said net income from its
railroad rose 4% to $141 million, despite a softer economy
and the non-recurrence of last year's favorable retroactive
tax claims. But the railroad's higher profit was partly
offset by a 21% drop in earnings from Union Pacific
Resources, the company's energy and mineral business, which
fell to $43 million from $55 million.</p>
<p>Union Pacific said the sharper rise in net earnings per
share reflects the effect of its stock repurchase program;
average shares outstanding declined to 100.4 million from
110.6 million.</p>
<p>For the first half, the company's earnings fell 3% to $281
million or $2.80 a share, from $290 million or $2.63 a share.
Revenue rose 10% to $3.51 billion, from $3.18 billion.</p>
