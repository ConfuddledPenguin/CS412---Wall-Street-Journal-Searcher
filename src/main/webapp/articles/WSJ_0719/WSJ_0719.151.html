	<h3>Politics & Policy: S&L Cleanup Law's Measures Weakened By Court Rulings, Relaxed Regulations</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- As political accusations over the
savings-and-loan mess build, the tough measures in last
year's S&L cleanup law intended to ward off a future disaster
are quietly being undermined by court rulings and eased
thrift regulations.
   The S&L cleanup law, passed last August, forced thrifts to
abandon accounting rules that had allowed them to hide losses
for years. The law also wiped out contracts between the
government and buyers of S&Ls in which buyers believed they
had special dispensation to continue using the accounting
rules. But in isolated cases, both are being weakened.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I think it's significant," says Karen Shaw of the
Institute for Strategy Development, a Washington banking
consultant. "Those are relatively unrelated events decided
for different reasons, but they are happening."</p>
<p>In return for hitting up taxpayers for $130 billion -- not
including hundreds of billions of dollars more in interest --
the S&L cleanup law racheted up capital standards. The
capital represents the investment that thrift shareholders
have at risk, and it acts as a cushion to protect the
taxpayer-backed deposit insurance fund.</p>
<p>But already, four federal judges have blocked the Office
of Thrift Supervision from seizing insolvent institutions,
based on contracts that those thrifts had with the federal
government. And recently, the thrift office delayed a
provision of the S&L bailout law that limited a thrift's
exposure to loss from any one borrower. The thrift office
then delayed for review a proposed regulation to increase the
amount of capital to be held for certain loans backed by the
Department of Veterans Affairs.</p>
<p>The thrift office, which contends that capital standards
haven't been eroded, said it was appealing the four cases. A
spokesman said that the office has prevailed in four suits
filed by other thrifts seeking to block federal takeover.</p>
<p>"The Office of Thrift Supervision believes that capital is
king," Director Timothy Ryan said yesterday. "We will do
nothing to erode the (cleanup law) capital standards, which
we view as the most important provision of the statute."</p>
<p>The most recent court ruling was Monday, when federal
Judge Thomas G. Hull in Tennessee issued a permanent
injunction blocking regulators from seizing Franklin Federal
Savings Bank of Morristown, Tenn., with $107 million in
assets.</p>
<p>The court ruled that the thrift had a solid contract with
the government in which the S&L was permitted to count
certain losses as capital and therefore couldn't be seized as
insolvent.</p>
<p>Some industry-watchers say the courts are just recognizing
what they have contended for the past year -- that Congress,
in a vengeful mood over the costs of the cleanup, went too
far. They say that the law set standards too high and that
the thrift office is inflexible. The Resolution Trust Corp.,
the new bailout agency, has so many insolvent thrifts to sell
that, to cut its losses, it is trying to find buyers for
failing S&Ls even before they are seized.</p>
<p>"You can sit in your ivory tower and dictate what should
be true, but when you are out there in the trenches, you have
to recognize reality," says Richard Kneipper, a Dallas thrift
attorney.</p>
<p>Seven other court cases contesting capital rules are
pending in federal courts across the country, and more are
certain to be filed. Attorneys say that many of the suits are
frivolous but that some thrifts make a compelling case that
they were induced by the government to acquire failing S&Ls,
based on the special capital provisions.</p>
<p>"The law was passed in a spirit of blunt-edged machismo,"
says Ms. Shaw. "The regulators are now in between a very hard
rock and a very hard place."</p>
