	<p class="article-leader">Your July 16 editorial "The Price of Silence" makes a very
valid point that "the essential cause of the S&L debacle is
in danger of being lost amid the political name-calling."
Unfortunately, you revive and give currency to a grossly
inaccurate bit of name-calling in which I was the unhappy
target.
   You cite a singularly contemptible charge "that Mr. Wright
threatened to expose one S&L regulator as a homosexual and
browbeat others to go easy on Democratic campaign
contributors."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That charge is untrue. To make a threat of that kind would
be totally alien to my character. I did not do anything of
that sort and I would not. Nobody who knows me well at all
would believe that I had ever been so crude as that.</p>
<p>My judgment, like that of other mortals, is imperfect. I
have made my share of mistakes, no doubt. But I do not want
that particular bit of calumny left unanswered in the public
record.</p>
<p>Jim Wright</p>
<p>Member of Congress, 1953-1989</p>
<p>Speaker of the House, 1987-1989</p>
<p>Fort Worth, Texas</p>
