	<p class="article-leader">ROSEMONT, Ill. -- Convenient Food Mart Inc. said it has
settled lawsuits out of court with four of its regional
franchisers: Convenient Industries of America Inc. in
Louisville, Ky., CFM Enterprises of Albany, N.Y., C.F. Marts
of California, and Ohio Valley CFM. The settlement involves
present and deferred payments to CFMI and allows the four
regional franchisers to rename their stores and have no other
payment obligations to the national franchiser, CFMI said.
   CFMI, which through its subsidiaries and independent
regional franchisers has about 500 stores operating under the
Convenient Food Mart name, is currently in Chapter 11
reorganization.</p>
