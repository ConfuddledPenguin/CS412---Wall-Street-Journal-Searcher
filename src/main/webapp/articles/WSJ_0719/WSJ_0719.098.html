	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade said it "believes"
Stotler & Co., the futures brokerage unit of Stotler Group
Inc., is in compliance with industry minimum capital
requirements.
   The terse exchange announcement late yesterday averts a
crisis for the old-line grain-trading firm whose chairman,
Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, is also Board of Trade chairman. But
exchange members said the firm, while a survivor for now,
will be a drastically smaller operation with an uncertain
future if customer and investor concerns about its financial
health aren't quickly assuaged.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stotler officials didn't return calls for comment.</p>
<p>To slash costs, the company this week instituted sharp
salary cuts for salaried employees earning more than $20,000
annually. An internal company memorandum from President and
Chief Executive Officer Thomas Egan to the staff says
salaried employees' base pay over $20,000 annually
effectively would be halved, at least through Sept. 30. For
example, the memo says employees earning $30,000 annually
will have their pay cut to $25,000 a year. The memo said
futures brokers' commissions weren't affected by the salary
cuts.</p>
<p>Stotler, with more than 300 branches and affiliates
scattered across the Midwest, has been transferring millions
of dollars worth of customer accounts to other futures
brokers this week in a frantic effort to reduce its
regulatory capital requirements, exchange members said.</p>
<p>The Board of Trade last week determined that Stotler's
capital levels didn't meet industry standards, and had given
Stotler until the close of business today to shore up its
capital position.</p>
<p>Neither the exchange nor Stotler said what caused the firm
to slip below the minimum requirement. Exchange members said
the problem may be tied to a rumored dispute with regulators
over the counting of certain assets within Stotler Group and
its subsidiaries, possibly about $11 million in commercial
paper issued by Stotler as capital.</p>
<p>If Stotler hadn't met the minimum regulatory capital
requirements -- capital on hand equal to 4% of segregated
customer funds -- it could have been forced to only let
customers trade to liquidate positions, or all of its
customer accounts could have been transferred by regulators
to other brokerage firms.</p>
<p>The exchange didn't say what amount of capital Stotler had
to support its customer accounts as of late yesterday, nor
did it reveal the amount of funds in the accounts. Exchange
members, who asked to remain anonymous, estimated that
Stotler's segregated customer funds peaked at between $250
million and $300 million a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week Stotler confirmed that it was
transferring customer accounts to other firms and said it was
seeking a capital infusion to satisfy regulatory demands for
capital. The company said that without a capital infusion,
"Stotler Group may be unable to meet its debt obligations
unless those obligations are refinanced or restructured."</p>
<p>The company also said that transferring accounts would
reduce revenue and net income for Stotler Group. For the
first quarter ended March 31, the company had net income of
$370,000, or 17 cents a share, and commission revenue of
$28.4 million.</p>
