	<p class="article-leader">HomeFed Corp., stung by a surprisingly large increase in
bad assets turned up by a special credit review, reported a
second-quarter loss of $108.2 million, or $5.04 a share.
   San Diego-based HomeFed, which until recently had been
considered fairly healthy, earned $28.1 million, or $1.30 a
share, a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>HomeFed said it added $234 million to its reserve for loan
losses in the quarter, increasing its reserves to $338
million at June 30, compared with $161 million at March 31.
The swelling reserves reflected a leap in nonperforming
assets, mainly bad loans and repossessed real estate, which
totaled $708 million at June 30, or 3.38% of assets.
HomeFed's nonperforming assets as of March 31 totaled $454
million, or 2.5% of assets.</p>
<p>HomeFed has been announcing surprise increases in bad
assets on a monthly basis since April, when the thrift's
nonperforming assets rose by $44 million. In May, HomeFed's
bad assets jumped an additional $81 million, and last month
it announced a special credit review it said was likely to
turn up more bad assets. However, the size of the latest
increase, $129 million, surprised even HomeFed management.
"Sure it's a bit surprising," said Robert Adelizzi, president
and chief executive officer. "The whole thing is a surprise,
starting with April."</p>
<p>The bulk of HomeFed bad assets are outside of California
and underscore how even relatively strong thrifts are being
hammered by troubled real estate markets in Texas, Arizona
and other states. They represent the apparent failure of
HomeFed's strategy of expanding outside its California turf.
"Normally, it's believed that geographic expansion reduces
risk, but it didn't work for us," Mr. Adelizzi said. As a
result, he said the thrift has halted almost all loan
originations outside of California and Nevada.</p>
<p>Though most of the problems are in other states, some 37%
of HomeFed's bad assets are in California, a level which
raised the specter that the heretofore powerhouse California
market may be beginning to sour. But Mr. Adelizzi said that
market, while slowing, remains strong.</p>
<p>HomeFed's announcement came after the market closed.
Still, rumors that the thrift might have bad news to report
drilled its stock earlier in the day and reflected what
management conceded was a loss of investor confidence. In New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, HomeFed
closed at $19, down $1.75.</p>
<p>HomeFed remains fairly well-capitalized, although the
quarterly results trimmed its tangible capital to assets
ratio to 3.68% from about over 5% as of early June.</p>
<p>Mr. Adelizzi said the special credit review that led to
the big boost in reserves was HomeFed's idea and wasn't a
response to any regulatory pressure. He said HomeFed feels
comfortable with the current level of reserves but said the
thrift couldn't guarantee that further additions might not be
forthcoming.</p>
