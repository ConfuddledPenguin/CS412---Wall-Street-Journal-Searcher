	<p class="article-leader">In a boost for the employee effort to buy UAL Corp.,
United Airlines' 26,000 non-union workers agreed to provide
wage concessions to help finance the buy-out.
   Support from the non-union workers offers a sign of
progress when the buy-out group's efforts to obtain bank
financing appear to be moving slowly. Only 3 1/2 weeks remain
until the Aug. 9 financing deadline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the moment, bank negotiations seem to be taking a back
seat as the buy-out group, led by the unions representing
United's pilots, machinists and flight attendants,
concentrates on trying to obtain capital for the $4.38
billion transaction from various airline suppliers.</p>
<p>The group has contacted a number of companies to provide
financing, including aircraft makers Boeing Co. and Airbus
Industrie; engine makers General Electric Co., Rolls-Royce
PLC and the Pratt & Whitney unit of United Technologies
Corp.; and aircraft leasing companies and European airlines.</p>
<p>In an interview, Gerald Greenwald, the buy-out group's
leader, confirmed that talks are continuing with several
suppliers. He declined to comment further, saying the
negotiations are "in a very delicate time."</p>
<p>The agreement with the non-union workers should help the
financing effort. Banks had expressed concern about the
prospect of labor discord at the airline if the non-union
workers didn't participate. The accord with the non-union
employees "eliminates a negative," said one person familiar
with the effort.</p>
<p>The reservations agents, customer-service representatives
and middle-level managers who make up the non-union group
agreed to one-time wage concessions amounting to $45.9
million, or an average 5.9% pay cut. The group also gave up
certain premium pay and rarely used medical benefits valued
at an additional $4.6 million in cost savings.</p>
<p>In return, the non-union workers will receive a 14.26%
stake in Chicago-based UAL, as well as some improvements in
their pension plan. In all, UAL employees have agreed to
provide $300 million in wage concessions for the first year
and a total of $2 billion over five years if the buy-out
succeeds.</p>
<p>The non-union workers agreed to support the buy-out after
Mr. Greenwald assured them in a letter that their accord with
the unions would become part of the actual agreement with
UAL.</p>
<p>Just a month ago, the non-contract workers had threatened
to upset the buy-out effort unless the unions met its
conditions. In a statement yesterday, the group said it
concluded that "the interest of all employees are best served
by trying to work together." In an unusual move, UAL hired
First Chicago Corp. and the law firm of Fried Frank Shriver
Harris & Jacobson several months ago to advise the
non-contract employees on the buy-out.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald disagreed with assessments that the
financing effort is moving slowly. "This process is on track
with my own timetable," he said.</p>
<p>The former Chrysler Corp. vice chairman said the unions
are currently working to develop "very definitive {financing}
proposals with some banks so that we can go with definitive
proposals to a larger group of banks."</p>
<p>He added that the banks are reviewing large amounts of
information so that they can "decide for themselves whether
or not to make {financing} commitments."</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald said he felt that the current financing
deadline of Aug. 9 "has always been a little tight,"
suggesting the buy-out group may seek an extension. He said,
however, there are currently no plans to ask for one.</p>
<p>Five major New York banks -- Citicorp, Chemical Banking
Corp., Manufacturers Hanover Corp., Bankers Trust New York
Corp. and Chase Manhattan Corp. -- agreed two weeks ago to
assist in the financing effort. But the banks want the unions
to obtain subordinated financing from other sources before
they agree to commit bank funds.</p>
<p>The extra layer of junior financing would give the banks
more comfort about the safety of their investment.</p>
<p>Separately, the buy-out group also declined to comment on
whether United's pilots union had agreed to use $200 million
from one of its pension funds as equity for the transaction.
Pilot leaders concluded a three-day meeting yesterday but
apparently arrived at no decision on the pension fund.</p>
