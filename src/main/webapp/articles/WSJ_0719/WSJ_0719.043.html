	<p class="article-leader">DES PLAINES, Ill. -- DeSoto Inc. said it agreed to sell
its domestic consumer paint business to Sherwin-Williams Co.
for about $80 million.
   The Sherwin-Williams pact is the latest in a series of
agreements which, taken together, represent a near-total
liquidation, with proceeds to be distributed to shareholders.
DeSoto, a maker of paints, chemical coatings and detergents,
has since last November been fighting off a hostile
$50-a-share tender offer from Sutton Holding Corp., a New
York investor group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week DeSoto announced that it had agreed to sell its
industrial coatings business and its surfactant and
emulsifier lines for about $200 million. The company
disclosed then that it was "very close" to an agreement on
the sale of its paint operation.</p>
<p>The paint unit's operations have been estimated at more
than $150 million in 1989, but competitive pressures have
generated operating losses in recent quarters.</p>
<p>As with the earlier unit-sale agreements, the planned sale
of the paint operation is subject to approval by shareholders
and regulators. DeSoto said it will distribute the net
proceeds -- expected to be around $60 million, or about
$14.97 a share -- to shareholders. Combined with the $27.84
the company has said it expects to distribute from proceeds
of the agreements announced earlier, DeSoto holders stand to
receive about $42.81 a share from the agreements so far.</p>
<p>Still unsold is certain proprietary technology, which is
on the block but not expected to garner a significant price,
and the company's household-detergent business, which had
revenue last year of about $72 million. DeSoto has said it
will "for the present" retain the detergent operation.</p>
<p>DeSoto undertook the sale of the company's principal lines
after a Delaware court, in the course of the company's legal
dispute with Sutton, ordered it to take steps to maximize
shareholder value.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, DeSoto
shares closed at $46, up 12.5 cents.</p>
