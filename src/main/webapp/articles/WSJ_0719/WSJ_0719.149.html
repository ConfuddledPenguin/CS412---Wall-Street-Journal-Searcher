	<h3>Taxing Sin -- As Bad As Taxing Virtue</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">When Washington becomes desperate in its search of new tax
revenue, it inevitably moves toward "sin" taxes. Taxes on
alcohol, tobacco, oil, gasoline, firearms and a host of other
sources are always fair game to politicians. Sin taxes help
politicians to avoid hornet nests -- income taxes for example
-- and to dodge the wrath of special interest groups that
contribute generously to re-election campaigns, such as the
financial and securities industries that would be singled out
by the proposed tax on securities transactions.
   At first blush it might appear that only a few industries
or individuals -- those directly in harm's way -- would
suffer greatly from sin tax hikes. Not so. Because items that
carry sin taxes are included in the U.S. Labor Department's
monthly survey of prices, higher "sin" taxes drive up the
Consumer Price Index. Everyone whose wages are tied to the
CPI by cost-of-living (COLA) clauses -- government workers,
veterans, Social Security recipients and unionized workers --
is exempted (partially or wholly) from the effect of sin tax
increases. Their advocacy of such taxes becomes self-serving
at the expense of the rest of the tax-paying public.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In fact, because some 30% of federal outlays -- $400
billion -- is tied to the CPI, sin taxes can drive federal
spending upward in perverse ways. It might at first seem, for
example, that a 50 cent increase in the current 9 cent per
gallon federal excise tax on gasoline and gasohol would
generate an added $30 billion for Uncle Sam's coffers.</p>
<p>That 50 cent tax hike, though, translates into a 51.4%
increase (on average) in prices of gasoline at the pump. And
"motor fuels" get a 3.3% weight in the CPI. So, that 50 cent
tax hike boosts the CPI by 1.7 percentage points. Funneled
through the federal government's COLA clauses, those 1.7
percentage points would add some $6.8 billion to federal
spending. If the federal government chose, as it likely
would, to offset the regressive effects of higher excise
taxes with bigger tax credits for low-income people, the cost
would be even higher.</p>
<p>The combination, substitution or addition of other sin
taxes could alter the magnitudes of the results, but not the
principle. Worse, not only do sin taxes cost money -- they
habitually fail to raise as much as projected.</p>
<p>Excise taxes on cigarettes were doubled in 1982. Revenue
from tobacco taxes (99.1% of which comes from cigarettes) at
first jumped nicely: to $4.14 billion in fiscal 1983 and then
to $4.66 billion in fiscal 1984 from $2.58 billion in fiscal
1981. But as consumers cut back their cigarette use, and as
the black market in untaxed cigarettes grew, tobacco revenues
contracted. By fiscal 1989, tobacco tax revenues had slumped
to $4.29 billion.</p>
<p>Other examples are even starker. Over the past three
years, one excise tax rate after another has been raised.
Taxes that were due to expire -- such as the 3% tax on
telephone services -- have been retained. And yet total
federal revenues from excise taxes in fiscal 1990 are
estimated to be $35 billion -- no more than they were in
1987. Simply put, excise taxes are too easy to evade and
avoid to be very lucrative.</p>
<p>And all of this analysis skips over the biggest problem of
all: The harm this artificial spurt in the CPI does to the
economy as a whole. COLAs pervade the private economy too,
and the higher labor costs that sin taxes impose on industry
will slow consumption and investment. In turn, a general
economic slowdown will reduce the federal government's take
from corporate and personal income taxes. A tax remains a
tax. Even the sin taxes that Washington contemplates so
eagerly would burden the productive economy.</p>
