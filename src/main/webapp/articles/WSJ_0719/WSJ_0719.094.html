	<p class="article-leader">Washington Bancorp., reporting a second-quarter loss of
$80 million, or $11.28 a share, said its ability to continue
operating is in doubt unless it can find new capital,
restructure assets and reach an accomodation with its
creditors.
   In the 1989 second quarter, the Washington, D.C.-based
bank holding company posted net income of $3.5 million, or 51
cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Much of the loss for the quarter ended June 30 came from
an increased provision for loan losses. After reviewing
Washington Bancorp.'s assets with federal regulators, the
company added $61 million to loan loss reserves, compared to
a $2 million provision in the year-ago period. The company
also realized losses of $15 million on asset sales and
write-downs.</p>
<p>The tremendous loss seems to have torpedoed the company's
plan to refinance its debt by issuing $45 million in new
secured notes. The debt restructuring was announced in May,
after the company determined it wouldn't be able repay $36.7
million in commercial paper. That program is "no longer
feasible," the company said.</p>
<p>The company said it hopes to come up with another plan to
improve its capital ratios and repay its debt. However, "No
assurances can be given that commercial paper holders or
other creditors will be repaid in full," said Chairman John
J. Mason.</p>
