	<p class="article-leader">Congratulations, you've arrived]
   Perhaps you're a prosperous professional with a
well-established law or medical practice. Or an
entrepreneurial genius who just sold your company for $20
million. Or maybe you just inherited $2 million or so.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Whatever the case, you have achieved a level of affluence
where you want a lot more from a bank than a checking
account.</p>
<p>A growing number of banks are eager to oblige, with
"private banking" services that mix highly personalized
attention with access to hefty loans and professional
investment management. Finding the right one can pay off in
coming years through improved financial performance, fast and
accurate service, and confidence that your financial
well-being is a crucial concern of your banker.</p>
<p>But finding the right private bank can be a chore. The
likes of Brown Brothers Harriman & Co., J.P. Morgan & Co. or
U.S. Trust Co. may be just the ticket for some people. Others
may prefer to have their wealth watched over by the
ever-so-discreet Swiss. Still others could find that their
local bank's recently created private banking service offers
just what they need.</p>
<p>Be wary of "image" advertising featuring posh offices,
some advisers say. After all, you probably won't spend much
time sitting in the overstuffed chairs, casually reading a
newspaper. Rely instead on referrals from wealthy colleagues
and friends who already use private banking facilities. Word
of mouth is much more reliable than fancy advertising
campaigns.</p>
<p>Don't be put off by advertised minimum financial
standards. "Every bank publishes minimums, and every bank
breaks them," a private banker says. "It all depends on the
potential of the relationship for the bank."</p>
<p>Even within private banks, there are various rankings of
wealth. At Citicorp, the private bank generally divides
clients into two categories: those with assets of $1.5
million to $10 million and those with more than $10 million.
But the difference in fees and levels of service is virtually
nil, says David Gibson, group executive in charge of
world-wide private banking. For example, the bank's art
service reports to the executive in charge of the $10
million-and-over group in the private bank, but the art
service -- investment advice on the acquisition of art works
-- is available to any client.</p>
<p>"It becomes a question of how much they need a particular
resource," Mr. Gibson says. "Somebody with less than $10
million will need less of the art service than somebody with
more than $50 million."</p>
<p>Still, advisers say it is a good idea to try to match your
qualifications to the size and clientele of the bank. "You
want to be at least a medium-sized fish in their pond," Larry
Biehl, a San Mateo, Calif., investment manager, says. "If you
decide you want to go to a J.P. Morgan, you want to be a good
salesman who can convince them that you're a rising star.
That's one way to get better service than you deserve."</p>
<p>After targeting two or three banks as likely choices,
schedule interviews -- and be prepared to bare your financial
soul. Private bankers will want to see detailed financial
information, including income tax returns for at least one or
two years.</p>
<p>"Give them all the financial data they need and sign your
name once," Mr. Biehl says. "If they start telling you later
that you need to fill out an application for this or that
service, you're in the wrong place."</p>
<p>When you interview the person who will handle your
account, find out all you can about his or her background and
abilities. But the most important question is how much credit
your private banker is authorized to extend without going
through a loan committee.</p>
<p>"That's evidence of seniority and how well you're being
treated," Mr. Biehl says. "If the limit is $10,000, you're
not high enough up yet. It should be at least $250,000."</p>
<p>If the private bank is part of a bigger institution, find
out to whom it reports. This is a good indication of how
seriously the parent bank approaches private banking,
financial advisers say. Ideally, they say, it should report
directly to senior management.</p>
<p>If you're a professional, find out whether the bank has
specialists on handling financial affairs for your
profession. A physician, for example, might want someone who
is up to date on the comparative benefits of leasing or
buying an expensive new piece of diagnostic equipment.</p>
<p>The objective is to pick a bank that will provide one
person who can handle all your banking needs, no matter what
department of the parent bank is involved. "You don't want to
be sent off to wander through the bank's halls," David Ross
Palmer, a New York-based private bank consultant, says. "You
want someone who is not only your personal financial adviser,
but who is also your representative to the bank."</p>
<p>The cost of private banking services varies widely. Some
banks provide the essentials for as little as $350 a year,
says Marilyn MacGruder Barnewell, a consultant who advises
banks on establishing private banking operations. But many
banks also require compensating balances -- deposits equal to
some part of any loan you may receive -- to help boost the
bank's profit. And the interest rates on these loans will
vary, depending on the nature and collateral of the loan,
from the prime rate to as much as the prime plus three
percentage points.</p>
<p>Mr. Biehl suggests that specific fees for specific
services often can be more economical for a private banking
client than compensating balances. "You can probably earn
more on your money if you have it somewhere else, so you can
pay their fees and still be ahead," he says.</p>
<p>But specialists argue that shopping for low prices in the
private banking arena can defeat the whole purpose of the
exercise. "If you're paying a low fee for crummy service,
what have you accomplished?" Ms. Barnewell says.</p>
