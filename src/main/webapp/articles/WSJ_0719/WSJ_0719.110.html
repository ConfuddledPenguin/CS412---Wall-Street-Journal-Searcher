	<p class="article-leader">Warfarin, a blood thinning medicine, reduced the risk of
heart attacks and death in people who had survived a previous
heart attack, Norwegian researchers reported in the latest
issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Their new study is the strongest evidence that the drug,
which has been available for years, may be useful in
preventing a second heart attack. Warfarin is sold as
Coumadin by DuPont Pharmaceuticals, a unit of DuPont Co., and
is also marketed by several other companies in generic form.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Over the years, several research teams tried, but failed,
to show that the drug's ability to prevent the formation of
blood clots could prevent second heart attacks. Doctors have
been fearful that the drug's long-term use might increase the
risk of cerebral hemorrhaging. Therefore, many doctors
prescribe aspirin to heart attack survivors based on recent
studies showing that aspirin reduced the risk of future
attacks.</p>
<p>In the latest study, doctors at Ulleval University
Hospital in Norway followed 1,214 heart attack patients,
giving half of them warfarin and the other half a placebo for
an average of three years of therapy. The warfarin-treated
group had 94 deaths, compared with 123 in the placebo group,
meaning that the drug reduced the risk of death by 24%.</p>
<p>The group taking warfarin had a 34% lower risk of having a
subsequent heart attack.</p>
