	<p class="article-leader">Wavetek Corp. posted disappointing fiscal third-quarter
profit and said it retained a financial adviser to explore
various options to maximize shareholder value, including a
possible sale of the San Diego company.
   John F. Kessler, chief executive officer, said
"operational results weren't adequate" although net income
more than doubled to $515,000, or six cents a share, in the
June 30 period from $234,000, or three cents a share. Revenue
rose 9% to $22.9 million from $21 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pretax earnings of $522,000 were about half of what the
company had hoped for, Mr. Kessler said. New orders in the
quarter fell to $17.4 million from $23.7 million in the
year-ago period. He said the main problem is erosion in
demand for the company's electronic test-and-measurement
equipment, which accounts for about 60% of sales.</p>
<p>Mr. Kessler said Wavetek expects to dismiss about 100
people, or about 10% of its work force, by the end of the
week, reflecting the company's lowered sales and profit
expectations. After the cuts, the company will have 850 to
900 employees.</p>
<p>Wavetek retained Peers & Co., a Chicago investment banking
concern, to assist it in arranging a "strategic alliance" or
sale of the company.</p>
<p>Wavetek closed yesterday at $4.25, up 37.5 cents, in
over-the-counter trading.</p>
