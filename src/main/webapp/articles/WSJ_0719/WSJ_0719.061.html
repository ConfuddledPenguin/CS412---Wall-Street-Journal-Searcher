	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- Cathy Nolan has a difficult job: Teaching her
neighbors the often-puzzling rituals of curbside recycling.
   "The toughest part is having the courage to knock on the
doors of people you don't know and talk to them about
changing their behavior without seeming nosy," she says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>She tells them that cereal boxes, minus plastic liners,
can be recycled, but microwave food containers, though also
paper, can't. She explains why the city won't pick up plastic
yogurt containers and milk jugs deposited at the curb; they
are made of the wrong kind of plastic. She gives tips: How
she composts cardboard meat trays in her backyard bin and
recycles plastic bottles at dropoff centers. Instead of
finger-pointing, she talks about her own recycling mistakes:
How she used to mix rubber-lined tops and lids with metal
cans.</p>
<p>"I haven't had anybody slam the door in my face," Ms.
Nolan says. "Recycling has drawn us closer as a
neighborhood."</p>
<p>In the war against waste, Cathy Nolan is a recycling block
captain, a foot soldier in a small army of eager volunteers
who have helped Seattle achieve the highest recycling rate of
any major U.S. city. Seattle already recycles 37% of its
waste and is ahead of schedule in its campaign to reach 60%
by 1998.</p>
<p>The volunteers, by teaching, cajoling and trying to set
strong examples, seek to reduce the trash going to landfills,
which often cause pollution. Their tactics are critical to
the success of a drive that doesn't compel participation.</p>
<p>They are helped by peer pressure, especially among
retirees unaccustomed to recycling. After talking to
neighbors, Dorothy Wiggins, a 69-year-old widow, reduced her
garbage by more than half. "They figure it's helpful, so I go
along with it. But I'm also saving money" through lower
trash-collection bills, she says.</p>
<p>Ms. Nolan, armed with a two-inch-thick recycling manual
issued by the city, casually checks up on 25 households on
her block. So far, all but one have signed up for recycling.</p>
<p>Her low-key suasion recently worked with one holdout. Jim
Green, 43, says he became a refusenik when the city's
contractor wouldn't pick up his garbage in the old metal
cans. Despite his numerous phone calls, he says, the
contractor failed to deliver special plastic containers
required under the city's new pay-by-the-can system.</p>
<p>"I threatened to dump trash in the middle of the street,"
Mr. Green says. New containers suddenly appeared. Fearing
another "bureaucratic shuffle," he threw out forms for
ordering recycling bins. Although he wouldn't call the city,
he was receptive when Ms. Nolan stopped by to chat. "She's
someone we know, and she made it easy," he says.</p>
<p>Although the program isn't yet saving the city money,
Seattle offers the first large-scale, practical demonstration
that recycling can be a cost-effective alternative to
incinerating or landfilling most waste. By providing a model
and an answer to skeptics, Seattle's experience is expected
to lend force to proposals to double federal, state and local
recycling goals to the 40% to 60% range. Those targets, in
turn, are likely to reduce the size and number of new
incinerators.</p>
<p>"What Seattle is doing could be replicated in almost any
major city," contends Bruce Weddle, the Environmental
Protection Agency's solid-waste director. But the nation now
recycles only about 17% of its waste, and many communities
are struggling to meet the federal goal of 25% by 1993.</p>
<p>One key to Seattle's success is garbage rates that, in
effect, pay people to recycle. Residents pay a separate bill
based on how much garbage they produce. Monthly charges
increase steeply from $10.70 for a 19-gallon "mini-can" to
$31.75 for three full-size, 32-gallon cans. Recycling of
plastic soda bottles, glass, cans, newspaper and mixed waste
paper, including junk mail, is free. The result: Almost nine
out of 10 households have reduced their garbage to one can or
less per week, cutting tonnage going to landfills by nearly
30% since 1987. Four out of five Seattle households now
recycle.</p>
<p>Innovative programs have helped. The city requires
residents to separate yard clippings from other trash but
charges only $2 a month for collection. It is distributing
10,000 free bins to encourage backyard composting and offers
opportunities to recycle some plastic bottles, mattresses,
motor oil and even lawnmowers. Old latex paint is collected,
and light colors are blended and sold for $5 a gallon as
"Seattle beige." In all, the city spends $7 million a year
for recycling, including collection and $500,000 for
advertising.</p>
<p>But Seattle's success "may not be entirely transferable to
other parts of the country," warns Allen Moore, president of
the National Solid Wastes Management Association, an industry
trade group. Surrounded by the natural beauty of Puget Sound,
old-growth forests and snow-clad Mount Rainier, Seattle
residents are imbued with environmental fervor. The city was
already recycling 24% of its waste before curbside service
began in 1988. Moreover, Seattle's ready access to the huge
Asian market has made recycling more economic.</p>
<p>To reach its own ambitious goal, Seattle must persuade
residents to separate 85% of what is recyclable. Instructions
stuffed into utility bills aren't enough to prompt the
necessary life-style changes; so neighborhood volunteers
teach by example.</p>
<p>The family of one volunteer, Toni Reineke, loves chocolate
syrup, but she won't buy it in nonrecyclable squeeze bottles.
Instead, she makes her own from ingredients packaged in paper
and glass. "It's cheaper and tastes better," she adds. The
Reinekes still send out for pizza, but Mrs. Reineke's
husband, Robert, rips the cardboard box in two, saves the
clean part for recycling and burns the rest in the fireplace.
Their eight-year-old daughter, Robin, won't buy toys in
excessive packaging. "It's not kind to Mother Earth," she
says.</p>
<p>Norma Davidson, a 65-year-old volunteer, practices a
waste-reducing life style that she calls "living lightly."
She brushes her teeth with baking soda to avoid disposable
toothpaste tubes, reuses tinfoil and sandwich bags and heats
her home with discarded lumber. Her 60-by-120-foot city lot
is a laboratory of natural recycling. Food scraps and yard
waste are composted into fertilizer for "edible landscaping,"
such as the brilliant yellow calendula flowers that go in her
salads.</p>
<p>Obstacles remain, however. The recycled latex paint hasn't
sold well because beige isn't popular, and some contractors
worry that it might not hold up well. Some miscreants think
"yard waste" includes things like engine blocks and tires.
Fewer than half the households in some poor neighborhoods
recycle; the city is hiring a minority consultant to help
reach blacks and Asians.</p>
<p>More significantly, Seattle's two recycling contractors
are sustaining losses because newsprint and mixed-paper
prices have collapsed. That could lead to higher garbage
rates unless the paper industry adds enough recycled-paper --
using capacity to shore up the markets. Furthermore,
businesses and apartment buildings aren't served by the
city's program, and commercial garbage rates, set by the
state, don't provide strong incentives to recycle. Only a
third of Seattle's public schools recycle paper because costs
are high, although officials plan to extend recycling to more
schools.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, employees accustomed to recycling at home are
demanding to do it at work. Allen Daniel, who manages the
Pioneer Building, got many requests from his business
tenants, but he didn't have the time or know-how to organize
a program for 85 offices. "Recycling isn't my priority," Mr.
Daniel says.</p>
<p>He turned to Carol Olsen, a consultant hired by the city.
She contacted more than 50 tenants, distributed fliers and
found a contractor willing to pick up mixed waste paper free
of charge. The contractor, the nonprofit Seattle Drug and
Narcotic Program, teaches recovering addicts new work skills
by recycling paper for 400 businesses.</p>
<p>With nearly all tenants recycling paper, aluminum cans and
bottles, the Pioneer Building has cut trash by a third and
saved $300 a month. But there have been tradeoffs. Now,
garbage is picked up from offices every other day, prompting
minor complaints about odors.</p>
<p>Of 50 businesses assisted through the city's pilot
program, however, 30 didn't start recycling, mostly because
they were too small to get pickup service or couldn't
organize their buildings.</p>
<p>However, the city must make "significant strides" in
commercial and apartment recycling to achieve its interim
goal of recycling 50% of all waste by 1993, says Diana Gale,
director of Seattle's Solid Waste Utility. Using government
funds, the Greater Seattle Chamber of Commerce is hiring two
full-time employees to promote recycling and use of products
such as 100%-recycled office paper. One reason: "Business
people aren't comfortable with the city coming in to tell
them what to do," says Susan Fife, who heads the chamber's
recycling committee.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy has also been a problem. Ruth Hardy, who
manages two adjacent four-unit apartment buildings, is
begging to recycle. Her dumpster is overflowing. But for
three months, the city declined to deliver bins, contending
her operation actually is eight units; only buildings of up
to four units are eligible. Eventually, the city relented,
and it promised to deliver the bins.</p>
<p>Although recycling has become a way of life in most
Seattle neighborhoods, David Chamberlain, another block
captain, says he did have a problem -- his two teenagers. It
took a year to hit upon a system requiring only minimal
cooperation: recycling containers strategically located
throughout his house.</p>
<p>Tearing himself away from Nintendo, Andrew, 14, points to
the large box in his bedroom with a sign admonishing:
"Recycle Paper." Says he: "When my room fills up with junk,
that's where I throw my magazines, school papers and pop
cans."</p>
<p>His brother, John, 19, is a strapping softball player who
consumes cases of soda pop, boxes of pizza and gallons of
milk from his bedroom refrigerator. "He's getting better" at
recycling, his mother says, although he forgets to remove the
plastic liner from his four-pound Grape Nuts boxes. His
recycling container is overflowing, but he admits he is
usually too lazy to carry it downstairs. "I just don't see
getting all hyped up about it," he says.</p>
<p>His parents are perfectionists: They separate everything.
Plastic milk, detergent and shampoo bottles go to a dropoff
at the local supermarket. Glass, separated by color to
increase its value, helps support local charities. Andrew
hoards aluminum, including printing plates from his father's
business, and sells them privately to help support his video
mania.</p>
<p>Mr. Chamberlain also deals with midnight dumpers cruising
back alleys. Determined to avoid the $5 charge for every bag
of garbage that won't fit in prepaid cans, they have stashed
trash and heaps of cigarette butts in his recycling bin. Now,
Mr. Chamberlain rolls out the container only on pickup day.</p>
<p>Ms. Nolan, the North Seattle block captain, computer
analyst and mother of three-year-old Tyler, avoids packaging
wherever possible. She stuffs a canvas bag with grocery
sacks, produce bags and plastic containers before driving to
a Puget Consumers' Co-Op, which sells everything from honey
and spices to peanut butter and shampoo in bulk. Using
gravity-fed bins and barrels fitted with pumps and spigots,
she fills her reusable packaging. Milk comes in returnable
glass bottles.</p>
<p>But what to do with all the corn cobs, husks, chicken
bones and other remains from summer barbecues? Ms. Nolan
relies on a 4-foot-by-2-foot plywood box in her back yard
that looks vaguely like a coffin. It is her worm composting
bin, home to a one-pound, writhing ball of red manure worms
that digest almost any organic matter, even paper plates.
Opening the lid, her husband digs into the waste, which is
steaming hot from decomposition. On the left side, he buries
barbecue waste, moldy pita bread, orange peels and coffee
grounds. On the right, he scoops out a soil-like material
that fertilizes the garden.</p>
<p>His wife doesn't consider herself an environmental nut.
"What motivates me more is saving money," she says. Growing
up in an Irish-American family of 12, she says she learned
the "value of reusing."</p>
<p>The environmental use of worms is catching on among the
neighborhood's young families. Debra Revere, 36, a family
therapist, got her first worm box recently at a birthday
party. Neighbors pitched in to build her a deluxe model,
designed as a garden bench and painted in beige and red to
match her house.</p>
<p>But some choices aren't easy. Ms. Nolan and her husband
disagree on how to stain the exterior trim of their bungalow.
He says solvent-based stain will last longer, but she prefers
a less-polluting latex. Convenience, too, is a factor: They
use an electric dishwasher. Says Ms. Nolan: "I have a debate
going on in my head at all times: What's the lesser evil?"</p>
