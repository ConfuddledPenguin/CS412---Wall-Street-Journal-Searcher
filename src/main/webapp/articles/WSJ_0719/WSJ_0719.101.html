	<p class="article-leader">Syntex Corp., Palo Alto, Calif., said it will ask a trial
judge to overturn a jury's verdict against the company in a
lawsuit. The suit involved charges that the drug manufacturer
terminated an employee because he objected to alleged efforts
to conceal evidence of harmful side effects from an
experimental drug.
   A jury sitting in Superior Court in San Jose, Calif., last
week held that Syntex wrongfully terminated one of its
researchers, awarding the former employee $2.5 million in
compensatory damages and $15 million in punitive damages.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Syntex said it disputes the charges and "strongly
disagrees" with the jury's verdict. It said it plans to ask
the trial court judge to render a judgment in its favor.</p>
