	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Georgia Gulf Corp., in its first earnings
report since it recapitalized to thwart an unwanted takeover,
said second-quarter net income plunged 68% on a 25% drop in
sales.
   The chemical company reported net income of $15.7 million,
or 50 cents a share, compared with $49.3 million, or $1.91 a
share, a year earlier. The latest results reflected
recapitalization costs, including such items as legal fees,
of about $15.2 million. The quarter's earnings also included
$16.9 million in interest expense related to the
recapitalization.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Georgia Gulf adopted the recapitalization plan in April,
ending a protracted and bitter takeover battle with Dallas
investor Harold C. Simmons.</p>
<p>Sales dropped to $218.7 million from $292.3 million.
Georgia Gulf attributed the decrease largely to the recent
sale of its Freeman Chemical Corp. subsidiary.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
exchange yesterday, Georgia Gulf fell 12.5 cents to close at
$10.375. The company released its earnings after the market
closed.</p>
<p>For the first half, earnings fell 49% to $53.1 million, or
$1.90 a share, from $104.7 million, or $4.04 a share, a year
earlier. Sales dropped 23% to $470.4 million from $610
million. "Considering that in the first six months of last
year the chemical industry experienced some of its strongest
markets ever, the current level of earnings, while down,
represents a good performance," a company news release said.</p>
