	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. restructured
its board so that outsiders now officially run what remains
of the once-powerful securities firm.
   Drexel said its new chairman will be current board member
Ralph S. Saul, formerly chairman of Cigna Corp., head of
First Boston Corp.'s management committee and president of
the American Stock Exchange. He succeeds John Shad, who
remains a director.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>John F. Sorte remains chief executive officer, and was
elected to the additional post of president, succeeding
Frederick Joseph, who was Drexel's longtime leader and who
becomes vice chairman. Mr. Sorte will also be chairman of the
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. brokerage unit, succeeding Edwin
Kantor, who becomes a senior executive vice president.</p>
<p>Drexel filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection in
February. Although most of the firm and its units have been
liquidated, Drexel has said that it plans to emerge from
bankruptcy proceedings as a going concern.</p>
<p>Three new outside directors were elected to the Drexel
board: Fletcher L. Byrom, former chairman of Koppers Co.;
Deborah Hicks Midanek, a managing director at Solon Asset
Management Corp. and former Drexel employee, and Frederick W.
Zuckerman, vice president and treasurer of Chrysler Corp. who
has announced plans to leave the auto maker.</p>
<p>The board now includes eight members, five from outside
the firm.</p>
<p>Mr. Sorte said the board's restructuring reflects "our
determination to protect the creditors and preserve equity
values."</p>
<p>Mr. Hills, a former SEC chairman, resigned from Drexel's
board, citing a conflict of interest with his law firm.</p>
<p>The only three Drexel employees who remain on the Drexel
board are Mr. Joseph, Mr. Sorte and Richard J. Wright, chief
financial officer. Others leaving the Drexel board include
Joseph Vitanza, Howard Brenner and Robert Linton.</p>
