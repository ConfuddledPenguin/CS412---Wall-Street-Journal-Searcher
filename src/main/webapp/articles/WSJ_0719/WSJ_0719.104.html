	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The grueling long-distance phone battle is
starting to wear on American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s
rivals as the war shifts from price-cutting to costlier
salesmanship.
   Long-distance rates, which have fallen almost 45% since
1984, are stabilizing as evidenced by recent price boosts on
certain consumer and business services by market leader
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There also is a growing reluctance by MCI Communications
Corp., AT&T's principal nemesis, to cut price at the expense
of profits.</p>
<p>MCI yesterday posted an 18% gain in second-quarter
earnings, but its stock was hammered after revenue growth
fell below expectations. Net income was $177 million, or 67
cents a share, compared with $150 million, or 56 cents, the
year before. Revenue rose 17% to $1.87 billion from $1.59
billion.</p>
<p>MCI's shares dropped $1.875 to $36.50 in national
over-the-counter trading after trading as low as $36.125
during the day.</p>
<p>MCI said revenue growth was strong in the residential and
big business sectors but slower in the general business
sector.</p>
<p>Daniel Akerson, MCI's chief financial officer, said that
during the second quarter, the company was preparing to roll
out MCI Vision, a product that offers to small and
medium-sized businesses some voice and data transmission
services previously only available to big businesses. Also
during the quarter, he said, MCI froze hiring in the spring
to avoid sizable layoffs after MCI acquires Telecom USA. The
acquisition is expected to win regulatory approval soon and
could be completed this summer. Telecom USA's major strength
is in the general business sector.</p>
<p>Mr. Akerson, who heads the effort to combine the two
companies, said MCI still won market share in the general
business segment but was "willing to accept a slower rate of
growth to facilitate the integration" with Telecom USA. "We
didn't have a product as competitive or as targeted as we
have today," Mr. Akerson said, referring to MCI Vision.
"Without the right weapon -- or product -- and a full team on
the field, then you might hold for a quarter."</p>
<p>AT&T is expected to post lower second-quarter earnings
today. Nonetheless, Sprint's and MCI's results could pose a
sticky timing problem for AT&T. The company has been trying
to convince the Federal Communications Commission that the
industry is sufficiently competitive and that its
classification as "dominant" carrier should be dropped in
favor of looser regulation.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Sprint, which has traditionally been the
telephone industry's biggest price discounter, posted a $42
million second-quarter operating loss. This caused its parent
United Telecommunications Inc.'s second-quarter net to drop
55% to $40.6 million, or 18 cents a share. Revenue rose 12%
to $2.07 billion.</p>
<p>United Telecommunications' stock is still reeling from the
Sprint debacle: Yesterday, its shares closed at $27.25, down
$2.25 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
after falling 24%, or $8.75, to close at $29.50 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>United was also the volume leader, with more than 11.8
million shares traded Tuesday and 10 million shares
yesterday. MCI led in volume in over-the-counter trading
yesterday with about 13 million shares traded.</p>
<p>Sprint and MCI are pushing to cut costs, but costs may be
the least of their problems, said Jack B. Grubman, analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. He said AT&T's size and market presence
makes it easier for the company to cut costs while keeping
marketing outlays high.</p>
<p>"In a starvation diet, the fat lady wins," said Mr.
Grubman. "This is going to squeeze competitors to death."</p>
<p>Robert B. Morris III, analyst at Goldman Sachs & Co.,
noted that "Sprint has its eye on one ball -- cost-cutting --
while the industry has moved into an intensified mode of
marketing and sales."</p>
<p>AT&T and MCI have moved aggressively on Sprint's
bread-and-butter accounts: consumer and small business. To
win these accounts over, AT&T and MCI have fueled their sales
and marketing with new pricing promotions and advertisements
about quality and service reliability aimed at consumer and
business customers for domestic and international
long-distance calls.</p>
<p>"Right now our goal is to stabilize our market share,"said
Victor A. Pelson, senior vice president and group executive
of communications services at AT&T. "We're on track with
regard to residential and business customers."</p>
