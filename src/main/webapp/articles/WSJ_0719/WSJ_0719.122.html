	<p class="article-leader">Most Americans don't know that Dudley Moore pitches
free-range chickens for a British supermarket chain.
   What's more surprising is that the ads are amusing. In
fact, after just weeks on the air, they're fast becoming a
cult favorite in advertising circles.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The off-the-wall commercials, in which Mr. Moore as a
supermarket flunky pokes about rural France in search of
chickens, are the work of Lowe Group, a well-regarded British
agency. Now, Lowe wants to do as well or better in the U.S.
with its Lowe & Partners agency.</p>
<p>In a rare interview, Frank Lowe, the Briton who founded
and heads the parent company, talked about his U.S. game
plan, including ambitious expansion plans. Lowe & Partners,
with about a dozen blue-chip clients from Prudential
Insurance to Coca-Cola, currently bills about $300 million
annually, squeezing it into that awkward spot of being bigger
than a boutique but smaller than a major player.</p>
<p>"I'd like it to double {in size} in the next five years,"
said Mr. Lowe, a 47-year-old in blue jeans and a Rod Stewart
hairdo who chain-smoked small cigars throughout the two-hour
interview. He also wants to improve Lowe & Partners' solid,
if unremarkable, creative reputation, which doesn't match up
to that of its British counterpart. "We'd like people to say
five years from now, as they have the last five years about
Chiat, that it's the best agency in the States."</p>
<p>Lowe & Partners has already been on something of a hot
streak. Earlier this year, it emerged as the long-shot winner
in snagging the $60 million Prudential account away from
Backer Spielvogel Bates. Currently, it is in the running for
a piece of the Xerox account, another major Backer client for
which Lowe handles some direct response advertising.</p>
<p>"Their work is getting noticed. They're becoming the
creative agency they want to be," said Leslie Winthrop of
Advertising Agency Register, which helps clients choose ad
agencies.</p>
<p>But Mr. Lowe's grand vision nevertheless remains, for now,
nothing more than that. Mr. Lowe said he doesn't intend to
make acquisitions in the U.S., but to grow the agency
internally. Yet industry consultants say the agency will
first have to digest the big Prudential business before it
can launch on an aggressive new-business warpath.</p>
<p>The agency is also still adjusting to a merger. Lowe &
Partners was created just last month from the marriage of
Lowe Marschalk and its much smaller sister agency Lowe Tucker
Metcalf. Lowe Marschalk's chief executive officer, Andrew J.
Langer, became chief executive of the merged company, while
the agency's new co-creative directors, David Metcalf and
Dennis D'Amico, hail from Lowe Tucker.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lowe, the merger has been relatively
painless, with no professionals and only a few support staff
members leaving. Still, the merger followed a number of other
changes. Last year, Mr. Langer's predecessor left after
sometimes clashing with Mr. Lowe over the agency's direction.
The agency also saw a change in ownership, when Interpublic
Group swapped its interest in Lowe Marschalk for a larger
interest in Lowe Group; it now owns 35.4% of Lowe Group.</p>
<p>Bringing the agency's creative work up to the level he
wants, meanwhile, will take five years, Mr. Lowe estimates.
The agency's current fare includes such standards as the "I
like the Sprite in You" campaign for Coca-Cola and the "Pass
the Grey Poupon" commercial in which one Rolls Royce
passenger asks another for mustard.</p>
<p>"There's a body of good work," Mr. Lowe said. "What's
missing, and not just in this agency, is that not too many
people scale the peaks."</p>
<p>In Mr. Lowe's view, American advertising was clearly
leading the rest of the world until about 1973, when the oil
crisis hit and ad agencies, frightened of losing their
clients, tamed down their acts. Stubborn clients, afraid of
taking risks, made the advertising that much worse, he said.
"Advertising was invented here. But somehow, it lost it's
nerve," Mr. Lowe said. "The agency shouldn't be terrified of
the client."</p>
<p>As for Lowe & Partners, "What we have to do is advertising
that Americans call breakthrough," he said. He reels off the
type of advertising he aspires to: Chiat/Day's Energizer
bunny commercials, Hal Riney's Bartles and Jaymes spots, and
Wieden & Kennedy's "Bo Knows" campaign for Nike.</p>
<p>To move things in the right direction, Mr. Lowe, who
started his career at age 18 in the J. Walter Thompson
mailroom in London, currently spends about half his time in
the U.S. In the London agency, he still approves every
commercial script, and he often informally checks up on works
in progress here.</p>
<p>His leadership can sometimes turn, well, loud. After
spending his early years working his way up through several
agencies, where his colleagues included such volatile
personalities as Charles Saatchi, he concedes that he learned
by example.</p>
<p>"We have a saying in England that the good is the enemy of
the great," he said. "I get volatile only because so often .
. . there's a kind of a conspiracy of mediocrity. That's when
I get excited. Somebody has to have some passion about the
whole thing."</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>ADVERTISER APPEAL: The Allied Printing Trades Council,
which represents 10 unions at the Daily News in New York,
yesterday sent letters encouraging the paper's advertisers
not to buy ads until new contract agreements with Daily News
staff members are reached. The unions' contracts expired in
March, and labor negotiations have been tense and largely
unproductive. "We expect advertisers to give the Daily News a
dose of tough love," the unions' letter said. A spokesman for
the Daily News called the unions' appeal "unfortunate and
misguided."</p>
<p>BBDO PUCHASE: The Atlanta office of Omnicom's BBDO agency
said it agreed in principle to acquire Hutcheson-Shutze, a
five-year-old Atlanta agency with $46 million in billings.
The acquisition, whose price wasn't disclosed, would create a
$200 million office that would be the second-largest U.S.
BBDO outpost after New York. Don Mitchum, president and chief
executive of BBDO's Atlanta office, will retain his title,
while HutchesonShutze's Virgil Shutze becomes chairman and
chief creative officer. His partner, Don Hutcheson, is
leaving the agency business.</p>
<p>WHO'S NEWS: J. Phillip Samper, president and chief
executive officer of KinderCare Learning Centers, was
appointed to the board of Interpublic Group of Cos. Mr.
Samper is a former vice chairman at Eastman Kodak.</p>
