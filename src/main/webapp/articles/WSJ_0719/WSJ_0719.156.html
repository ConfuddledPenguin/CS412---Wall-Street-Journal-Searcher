	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- When the subject of the budget process came
up at the deficit talks recently, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady was out of town, Budget Director Richard Darman came in
late and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) slipped out early
to go to a ball game.
   Clearly, "budget process" is a topic that bores even the
most devoted of the budget negotiators. In two months of
talks, they've devoted precisely one day to it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But don't be fooled. Changing the process is critical to
getting a budget accord because the White House has made it a
top priority. Many congressional Republicans, convinced that
past bipartisan accords have failed to limit spending, agree.
The House Republican Whip, Newt Gingrich of Georgia, told
fellow negotiators the other day that if he had to walk out
of the room uttering the "T-word," they would have to utter
the "C-word" -- control of spending.</p>
<p>What President Bush and the Republicans are looking for is
some guarantee that any tax increase will go to reduce the
deficit -- not to fuel more spending. That means pushing
Democrats to establish in advance firm spending totals for
defense and domestic programs for the next five years, and
then finding a way to make that promise stick. "Whatever we
come to agreement on would have to be enforceable on a
multi-year basis," says Mr. Darman. "That has never been
possible before."</p>
<p>In speeches, Mr. Bush has highlighted the need for a
line-item veto -- a change favored by conservatives that
would give the president the power to pluck wasteful
porkbarrel projects out of massive spending bills.</p>
<p>But the line-item veto isn't considered a realistic
solution. In private, Bush administration officials concede
that Congress isn't about to surrender so much power to the
president. Moreover, it isn't clear that the veto would be
much help in cutting the deficit. "It's symbolic," says
political scientist Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution,
a Washington think tank. "The president would find it
extraordinarily difficult to do anything with the line-item
veto that would add up to numbers that would make any
difference as far as the deficit is concerned."</p>
<p>Efforts to change the budget process to enforce a
bipartisan deficit-reduction accord are undeniably arcane.
"The public doesn't understand the process, and you can't
explain it to them," says Sen. Bennett Johnston (D., La.).
But the process can be immensely important. The Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law has been driving tax and spending
policy for the past five years. And because any change in the
process tends to alter the balance of power in Congress, the
resistance to altering the budget process is substantial.</p>
<p>Any agreement at the budget talks to raise taxes or save
money on benefit programs like Medicare or Social Security
will be written into law and won't require new enforcement
mechanisms. But the spending levels for the Pentagon and for
domestic programs ranging from space to sewers are less
certain. Those spending levels are set annually and, as a
result, the congressional appropriations committees can
easily undo any agreements made by the summiteers.</p>
<p>Republicans want guarantees that that won't happen. "I
want assurance that, but for absolutely unexpected events,
the end result is achieved," says Sen. Pete Domenici of New
Mexico, senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.</p>
<p>Participants in the talks say Mr. Darman has proposed
fixing by law five years of spending totals for defense,
overall domestic programs and foreign aid, a step that
basically would prevent any changes to the summit
understandings without the president's consent.</p>
<p>An alternative plan being circulated by the private
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget would alter the
Gramm-Rudman law to target automatic spending cuts
specifically at appropriations subcommittees that overspend
their allocations. A subcommittee that overshot its target
one year would be penalized the following year. The
Gramm-Rudman deficit targets would be dropped in favor of the
new spending ceilings.</p>
<p>Democrats are resistant to all these proposals. "I don't
want to be a party to any mechanism that diminishes the
constitutional authority of Congress to control spending
bills," says Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser
(D., Tenn.). Some Democrats say they might go along with new
parliamentary hurdles for spending bills that exceed
summit-set totals, but the summit isn't likely to resolve the
process issues until after it strikes a compromise on a
package of spending cuts and tax increases.</p>
<p>Much of the disagreement isn't about how much the
government spends in total, but what the money goes for. The
administration, for instance, wants the summit to set a floor
under defense spending to protect it from attempts to make
deeper cuts in the future. Some Democrats complain that the
world is changing too fast to lock in a five-year commitment
now.</p>
<p>In the end, though, the issue is one of power rather than
policy. Democratic and Republican members of appropriation
committees cherish their role in divvying up the federal
spending pie. Negotiators from both sides expect Sen. Robert
Byrd (D., W.Va.) and Rep. Jamie Whitten (D., Miss.), chairmen
of the appropriations committees, to be among the last
obstacles to an agreement on writing rules to enforce a
summit agreement.</p>
<p>Even convening the ad hoc congressional-White House summit
steps on their toes. Indeed, Rep. Whitten occasionally rises
from his chair at the summit talks -- the only participant
who stands to speak -- and protests that the entire
enterprise is improperly encroaching on his turf.</p>
