	<p class="article-leader">FINDLAY, Ohio -- Cooper Tire & Rubber Co. directors voted
a 2-for-1 split of the common stock and raised the dividend
by 33%.
   The producer of replacement auto and truck tires also
reported a 9.2% rise in second-quarter net, in spite of tire
price discounting. Net was $16.4 million, or 80 cents a share
on current shares, up from $15.1 million, or 74 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales rose 2.3% to $234.7 million from
$229.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dividend on the new shares will be six cents
quarterly, equal to 12 cents on current stock, an increase
from the nine cents paid in each of the past four quarters.</p>
<p>Additional shares will be distributed on Aug. 20 to shares
of record July 30. The initial dividend on the split stock
will be paid Sept. 30 to stock of record Sept. 7.</p>
<p>Cooper directors think there will be a better market for
the stock at the lower price resulting from the split, said
Ivan W. Gorr, chairman and chief executive officer. The
company last split the stock, also 2-for-1, two years ago,
and has raised the dividend every year since 1979. Cooper
stock close yesterday at $36.625, up 37.5 cents.</p>
<p>Second-quarter net was in line with analysts'
expectations, said Harry W. Millis, tire and rubber analyst
with McDonald & Co., Cleveland. He expects the company to
earn about $3.25 a share on current shares for the full year,
up from $2.84 in 1989.</p>
<p>Tire producers slashed prices last spring because of
excess inventories arising from the first-quarter plunge in
auto and truck production. Although Cooper doesn't sell tires
to the auto makers, it was affected because other tire makers
dumped into the replacement market tires that they had
produced for the auto plants.</p>
<p>The worst of the discounting appears to be over, Mr.
Millis said. Also, most tire producers have announced
increases in list prices for replacement tires averaging
about 3.5%, effective during August and September.</p>
<p>Profit for the first half rose 19% to $30.2 million, or
$1.47 a share, from $25.4 million, or $1.24 a share. Sales
increased 4.3% to $443.3 million from $425 million.</p>
