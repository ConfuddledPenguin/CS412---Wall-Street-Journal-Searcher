	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For 40 years, TV's Nielsen ratings have been
the only show in town.
   The data on television viewing gathered by A.C. Nielsen
Co. have been the unquestioned currency of the business,
dictating how billions of advertising dollars are spent and
determining which shows survive and which ones falter.
Customers didn't mind the monopoly: One set of numbers from a
single supplier made things less complicated.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But now television has turned the tables: It is rating the
Nielsens -- and it's not pleased with the result.</p>
<p>The company is under fire, its numbers are suspect, and
new rivals are lining up to exploit the tumult. A growing
number of television executives claim that the Nielsen system
-- particularly the remote control "people meter" device
Nielsen families use to log who watches what -- has
fundamental flaws. New studies contend the ratings
significantly understate viewing in a number of ways,
especially by children and young adults and people in bars,
hotels and on vacation.</p>
<p>Nielsen's trouble began a few months ago, when its
numbers, based on 4,093 homes that are supposed to represent
92.1 million households, showed millions of people suddenly
ceasing to watch TV. Network viewing had been slowly
declining for several years, but overall television viewing
had remained steady for decades. This sudden, severe falloff
in total TV viewing was unprecedented.</p>
<p>The networks went ballistic, rueful over having to give
sponsors $100 million in free commercials to cover the
ratings decline of the first quarter alone. Something had to
be wrong, they argued. They later imposed the first major
change in how ratings are guaranteed to advertisers, using
eight-year trends instead of just the current year's
Nielsens.</p>
<p>"As a researcher, I've got to have confidence in the
numbers, and I don't," says Alan Wurtzel, senior vice
president of research at Capital Cities/ABC Inc. "We continue
to do business based on numbers that are suspect, and we can
only do that for a short time."</p>
<p>Nielsen officials defend their system as proven, accurate
and rigorously tested. John Dimling, executive vice president
at A.C. Nielsen's rating service, Nielsen Media Research,
notes that despite network complaints, the ad industry's
major trade group has endorsed the system.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, would-be rivals see an opening.
Britain-based Pergamon AGB PLC says it will re-enter the U.S.
market soon; two years ago, it racked up losses of $67
million in an effort that Nielsen soundly stomped. Arbitron
Co., Nielsen's only major rival in local-market TV ratings,
has set a fall start for a much-delayed system it wants to
take nationwide by late next year.</p>
<p>But any dive into Nielsen's domain may well belly-flop.
"It's anyone's prerogative to come into this market," says
William G. Jacobi, executive vice president of Nielsen Media
Research. "But if they do, we are going to fight them tooth
and nail. This is a business we love, and we're going to
defend it with every resource we have."</p>
<p>The sometimes sleepy giant is known for aggressive and
shrewd tactics when challenged. Acquired by Dun & Bradstreet
Corp. in 1984, Nielsen has annual sales of more than $600
million. Yet only about $50 million comes from national
television ratings. (About two-thirds of the company's total
revenue is from tracking the sale of packaged goods at retail
stores.) So it is questionable whether the market can support
more than one major player.</p>
<p>After the networks screamed about the measured drop in
viewing, Nielsen reviewed its procedures and pronounced the
system healthy. Maybe, the company said, the drop was due to
normally sedentary sofa spuds heading outside to enjoy
unusually warm winter weather. But anomalies kept cropping
up.</p>
<p>In some cases, curiously, the households watching
television held steady with a year ago, yet in specific age
groups the viewing fell sharply. In March, Nielsen noted only
a 2% drop in households watching all channels in prime time,
but women aged 18 to 34 inexplicably had a deeper decline of
8%. In April, late-night viewing fell only 3% in homes, yet
plunged 13% for men under age 35, the Nielsen ratings showed.</p>
<p>How, the networks demanded, could overall viewing be about
the same yet decline so sharply in specific groups?</p>
<p>The national numbers, moreover, contradicted Nielsen's own
local-market ratings derived from 200,000 diaries in the
nation's 200 television markets. In February, the local
markets saw no real change in TV viewing from a year before
-- but the national numbers logged a 5% drop.</p>
<p>In May, according to the local surveys, "NBC Nightly News"
was in second place among the three network newscasts, with
an audience of 9.2 million people. Yet in the national
numbers, NBC was mired in third place, with 1.7 million fewer
viewers.</p>
<p>Television executives and even some people in the ad
industry have been quick to take note. "There's some
suspicion the numbers are flawed," says Paul Isacsson,
executive vice president at Young & Rubicam Inc. He worries
that they make it look as if ad agencies are paying higher
prices for fewer and fewer viewers.</p>
<p>If the numbers are flawed, the culprit may be the people
meter, the newfangled device that Nielsen introduced --
reluctantly -- for national ratings in late 1987. Before
then, Nielsen had used diaries. Diaries were a lot cheaper,
but they were prone to error, especially as the number of
channels expanded with the rise of cable in the mid-1980s.
Viewers forgot what they had watched and simply guessed.</p>
<p>Nielsen had tested the people meter since 1977 without
ever using it. Nielsen might have waited years more before
switching, but for a rare outbreak of competition in 1985.
British upstart AGB had entered the U.S brandishing the
people meter as a major selling point.</p>
<p>The people meter works like a remote control. Each viewer
presses some buttons when he or she starts or stops watching
TV. When the set is on, a separate meter automatically
records the channel the set is tuned to. But even if the set
is turned on, what matters most is that someone has pressed
buttons showing that there's really a viewer, or several
viewers. Even the youngest tots are expected to use the gizmo
when they tumble out of bed at dawn for Saturday cartoons.</p>
<p>For adults, too, this is an onerous burden of
button-pushing, especially when a Nielsen home is expected to
do it diligently for up to two years. That may be why almost
half of homes refuse when Nielsen asks them to join its
people meter sample, and why only 47% stay on as members of
the Nielsen system.</p>
<p>The rate of cooperation may distort the random nature that
the system needs to represent an entire nation's viewing.
Viewers who agree to use the people meter may be
systematically different in their television habits from
those who refuse. "It's an enormous potential source of
bias," says Persi Diaconis, a statistician at the University
of Illinois.</p>
<p>Nielsen's Mr. Jacobi, however, says getting 47% of homes
to cooperate "is an admirable achievement."</p>
<p>Nielsen still uses diaries alone in 175 of the 200 TV
markets for local ratings, because people meters would be too
costly to install everywhere. Critics say this might help
explain the difference between the national ratings and
figures derived from local reports.</p>
<p>For households that agree to use a people meter in the
national sample, "user fatigue" may understate viewing.
Nielsen data show the longer some viewers, particularly
younger ones, have the time-consuming device, the less they
use it.</p>
<p>Among men aged 18 to 34, for example, newcomers using the
people meter only three months appear to watch 17% more
television than the Nielsen sample overall, a new study by
the firm Statistical Research Inc. finds. At the one-year
point they watch about the same load as the overall sample, a
sign that they may have grown lax in their button-pushing
duties.</p>
<p>That argument is strengthened by a new phone survey the
firm did of 26,000 homes, says William Rubens, a longtime NBC
ratings executive who now consults to the networks. The
survey indicated that 26% more men aged 18 to 34 and 33% more
kids were watching TV than Nielsen showed for the same
period. "It's an inescapable conclusion," he says, that some
parts of the Nielsen system are a biased representation of
the public's viewing.</p>
<p>Nielsen's Mr. Dimling says that the phone survey, like any
survey, may have its own problems and adds that the survey
results closely followed Nielsen figures for the broad
category of viewers aged two and above.</p>
<p>The phone survey also showed 52% more visitors watching
television in other people's homes than Nielsen reported. And
Nielsen appears to understate other "out-of-home" viewing.
Because its people meters are based only in homes,
TV-watching in bars, hotels and other public places isn't
counted. Nor does Nielsen count viewing once a family turns
off the set and heads for a vacation. About 20% of the U.S.
public is on vacation during any given week of the summer
months, and studies find 80% of people on vacation watch TV.</p>
<p>In addition to griping about Nielsen's numbers, some
customers are growing weary of dealing with a monopoly and
are looking for alternatives, such as AGB's failed effort two
years ago. "The real killer was aborting the competitive
process before it bore fruit," says CBS Inc. senior vice
president David Poltrack, who supported AGB's effort.</p>
<p>AGB failed in its first attempt partly because it didn't
anticipate the huge investment required and the complexity of
tracking thousands of hours of programs. But counter-moves by
Nielsen hurt too. In October 1985, just as AGB was unveiling
the results of its first test, Nielsen announced its own
people meter plans -- though Nielsen didn't switch to the
contraption for two years. The company dealt another blow by
hiring away AGB's U.S. president, Joseph Philport, months
before the AGB service was to go nationwide.</p>
<p>Last month, AGB announced plans to re-enter the
U.S.market, saying it had been "invited" by the three
networks. The fight could be nasty -- and petty. Nielsen's
Mr. Jacobi accused AGB of "false pretenses" because, he
notes, no formal invitation had been issued to the company.</p>
<p>"The attack is really quite ridiculous," says Robert
Maxwell, the Britain-based tabloid publisher and chairman of
Maxwell Communication Corp., who bought AGB 18 months ago. He
calls Mr. Jacobi a "monopolist" and adds: "We are in
discussions with the networks and continue to be."</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell says AGB can set up in the U.S. on an
investment of up to $40 million and an annual budget of $30
million. But others say $100 million is a more likely
start-up figure. And so far, only the three networks are
interested in AGB.</p>
<p>"If AGB is considered the handmaiden of the networks, even
if they're doing things right, the effort will be tainted,"
says consultant Norman Hecht, a former AGB executive.</p>
<p>It also raises revenue questions. The Big Three now pay
Nielsen only $15 million combined, less than one-third of the
$50 million a year in revenue Nielsen gets for its national
television ratings service. The rest comes from ad agencies,
advertisers and cable channels, which so far aren't
expressing much interest in AGB.</p>
<p>Nor are Nielsen's customers clamoring, as yet, for a new
service called ScanAmerica, from Arbitron. The service would
track both TV viewing and product purchases by the same
sample of families.</p>
<p>Arbitron plans to be in 1,000 homes in five major cities
by year-end and have a national sample of 2,000 homes by late
1991. That will take an investment of $125 million, and
Arbitron will lose money on the service well into the
mid-1990s, says Kenneth Wollenberg, executive vice president.</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb has signed up, eager to match TV
viewing to product purchases. The Nielsen people "just aren't
moving fast enough for our purposes," says Marianna Reges, a
media manager for Bristol-Myers's in-house advertising.</p>
<p>Still, many television executives doubt that two ratings
services can survive. "It would be like having two monetary
systems," says John Hunt, a vice president at ad agency
Ogilvy & Mather. If two suppliers turned in different
numbers, it would raise conflicts as to which set was right.
Yet if the numbers were the same, he says, why pay for two
services?</p>
<p>Marshall Cohen, executive vice president at Viacom Inc.'s
MTV Networks subsidiary, says the networks would abandon a
new rival as soon as Nielsen's numbers got better. They
blamed a loss of audience two years ago on Nielsen's switch
to the people meter; a year later they cited the long strike
by script writers; now it's the people meter again. "Next
year," says Mr. Cohen, "they'll blame it on the bossa nova."</p>
<p>But the networks say their complaints are legitimate and
that their desire for a new and better service is real. CBS's
Mr. Poltrack says when he first got into the television
business, he couldn't believe billions of dollars were based
on so fragile a system as Nielsen's. "I still can't believe
it," he says. "The whole thing is crazy."</p>
