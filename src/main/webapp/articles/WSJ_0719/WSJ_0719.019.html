	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Home Products Corp. said
second-quarter net income advanced 13%, but excluding the net
effect of a gain on the sale of its household-products unit
and a charge for a number of expenses, net dropped 18%.
   The charge surprised analysts and traders, who knocked a
couple of dollars off American Home's stock price.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, three other major pharmaceutical makers
reported increases in net: Merck & Co., 19%; Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co., 21%; and Warner-Lambert Co., 20%.</p>
<p>Late last month, American Home closed the $1.25 billion
sale of its Boyle-Midway division to Britain's Reckitt &
Colman PLC. American Home, which sold the assets to further
focus on pharmaceuticals, posted a $1 billion pretax gain on
the sale.</p>
<p>But the company also charged $697 million for a number of
items; the effect of the gain and the charge added $73
million to net income. Sales inched up 1.1% to $1.61 billion
from $1.59 billion.</p>
<p>"Part of (the surprise) is related to the fact that
American Home is somewhat uncommunicative in terms of their
dealings with the financial community," said Ronald M.
Nordmann, analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc.</p>
<p>But Mr. Nordmann also said the company carefully manages
its books, and despite the special items, American Home's
per-share net came in as expected. The company hasn't had a
down quarter for earnings in 37 1/2 years. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, American Home fell
$2.125 to $52.25.</p>
<p>A spokesman for American Home said results were held back
by softer sales of over-the-counter medicines; retailers
found that the cost of carrying larger inventories exceeded
the benefits of buying larger quantities of items at
discount. Introductions of some competitive products also
were a negative factor, he said.</p>
<p>A major issue, the spokesman said, was that sales of the
pain reliever Advil were hit by a study at Johns Hopkins
University, linking ibuprofen, Advil's key ingredient, with
side effects in kidney patients. "Sales have come back, and
we've recovered 60% of the drop," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>American Home took the $697 million charge, the spokesman
said, in part to write off good will from two acquisitions: a
hospital-supply business from Chesebrough-Pond's in 1986; and
VLI Corp., a maker of contraceptive sponges, in 1987.</p>
<p>The charge also covers costs to reorganize and consolidate
European operations when the European Community drops its
trade barriers in 1992. Certain hospital-supply unit plants
also will be closed; the move won't require substantial job
cuts, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Also, American Home booked what it expects will be the
costs of providing medical benefits for its current retirees.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board is considering a
proposal to require companies to account for such costs by
1993.</p>
<p>And like others in the pharmaceutical industry, American
Home boosted its reserves for costs of possible product
liabilities and environmental cleanup.</p>
<p>As for the other drug companies, sales at Merck, Rahway
N.J., grew 20% to $1.9 billion from $1.59 billion, and many
of the same new products that drove the first quarter
continued into the second. Second-period sales climbed 30%
for Vasotec, which reduces high blood pressure and treats
congestive heart failure, and 39% for Mevacor, which cuts
cholesterol levels, Mr. Nordmann said.</p>
<p>In foreign markets, Zocor added $70 million in sales, up
from $15 million a year ago, Mr. Nordmann said. Zocor, which
also cuts cholesterol, isn't approved for sale in the U.S.</p>
<p>The analyst expects Losec, which posted sales of $20
million in the second quarter, to make "a huge contribution"
in the future; the drug wasn't on the market last year's
second period. The drug has been approved to treat
inflammations of the windpipe, but a Food and Drug
Administration panel has urged approval of the drug's use for
short-term treatment of certain ulcers, a potentially much
wider group of patients. Merck licenses the drug for U.S.
marketing from AB Astra, a Swedish research firm.</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb said in a brief statement that U.S.
sales grew 7%, international sales added 17%, drug sales
growth was "particularly strong," and currency-exchange rates
added 1% to sales. A spokesman wouldn't elaborate, but
analysts said that one product driving results is Capoten,
which treats heart disease. The company's sales grew 11% to
$2.48 billion from $2.24 billion.</p>
<p>Warner-Lambert, where sales climbed 13% to $1.15 billion,
saw "particularly good growth" -- 27% higher sales -- from
its Lopid cholesterol regulator, Mr. Nordmann said. As a
group, sales of prescription drugs at the Morris Plains,
N.J., company were up 17%, while sales of over-the-counter
products, led by Listerine mouthwash and Halls cough drops,
among others, advanced 14%. "The mix of business was very
favorable," emphasizing higher-profit-margin items, Mr.
Nordmann said.</p>
<p>In Big Board composite trading yesterday, Merck rose 12.5
cents to $90.125, Bristol-Myers Squibb fell 50 cents to
$64.25, and Warner-Lambert dropped $1.875 to $67.25.</p>
