	<p class="article-leader">British Steel PLC said it agreed in principle to acquire
40% of Spain's Aristrain steelmaking group, with La
Corporacion Banesto, the industrial conglomerate of Spain's
Banesto banking group, buying another 40%.
   The purchase price wasn't disclosed in a statement
released by British Steel, which also said that provision had
been made for Ensidesa, the Spanish national steel company,
to acquire a shareholding up to a maximum 10%. The balance
will be retained by current shareholders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A British Steel spokesman said it was premature to discuss
the acquisition price. The current family shareholders will
retain 20% of the concern under the accord. Any Ensidesa
purchase would come jointly from British Steel and LCB's
holdings.</p>
<p>Aristrain, based in Madrid and the Basque country, is
Spain's largest specialist producer of steel sections for the
construction industry. Its annual output is about 1.5 million
tons, which is marketed through its national distribution
network.</p>
