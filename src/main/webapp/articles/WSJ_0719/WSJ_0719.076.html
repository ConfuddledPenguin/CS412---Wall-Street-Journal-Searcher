	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan,
testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, signaled that
no further easing of credit is imminent.
   Mr. Greenspan labored to explain that the Fed eased credit
"slightly" last Friday not because it sees the economy
deteriorating but because it became convinced that the credit
crunch "is beginning to have very real, unwelcome effects."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The distinction is important, Mr. Greenspan said. If the
Fed were "looking at a more profound change . . . in either
economic activity or inflationary pressures," Friday's action
would have been the first of a series of moves, he said. "We
were not looking to fundamentally change the underlying
credit conditions in the country."</p>
<p>Pressed by Sen. Paul Sarbanes (D., Md.), Mr. Greenspan
said that the economic odds are "perhaps a shade more toward
recession than they were earlier in the year," but he
attributed that almost entirely to the reluctance of banks to
make business loans. "We have offset most of that with the
action we have taken," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan didn't slam the door completely on another
move by the Fed if it sees evidence that the credit crunch is
growing worse. He said the Fed "must remain alert to the
possibility that an adjustment . . . might be needed," and he
pledged "continued scrutiny" and "a flexible approach to
policy making."</p>
<p>He also held out the prospect of additional Fed easing
should Congress and the White House agree to "major,
substantive, credible cuts in the budget deficit" of between
$50 billion and $60 billion for next year. In apparent
response to Bush administration concerns that the Fed might
not move fast enough, Mr. Greenspan said, "We can decide that
a policy adjustment is appropriate and implement it fully,
all in the same morning if need be, and the effects of the
change will show through interest rates . . . almost
immediately."</p>
<p>The Fed had been holding short-term interest rates steady
for more than six months. And as recently as a month ago, Mr.
Greenspan said that he saw no "broad-based tightening" by
lenders that was harming the national economy. But he changed
his tune last week, telling the Banking Committee Thursday
that the Fed was poised to ease because of "cumulating
evidence" of a credit crunch. Yesterday, he confirmed that
the Fed moved Friday to lower the short-term interest rate it
controls by a quarter of a percentage point, to 8%.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan said it had become apparent "only in recent
days" that Fed action was warranted. He cited surprisingly
slow growth of the money supply as well as surveys and other
indications that banks are tightening lending standards and
increasing the spread between the rates they pay depositors
and those they charge lenders. "If you wait until you get
published numbers, you'll always be acting much too late," he
said.</p>
<p>The Fed chairman said that for months he had welcomed
growing conservatism among banks and other lenders as a
prudent reaction to the excesses of the 1980s, but now he
fears banks have gone too far. "It is difficult to discern
the dividing line between lending standards that are still
healthy and those that are so restrictive as to be
inconsistent with the borrower's status and the best
interests of the lender in the long run," he said. "In recent
weeks, however, in my judgment, we may have slipped over the
line."</p>
<p>Not only are banks reluctant to make real estate and
merger-related loans, Mr. Greenspan said, but they are
tightening lending standards for small and medium-sized
companies as well as weaker big companies. "In some cases,
loans have been simply unavailable," he said. Mr. Greenspan,
always precise in his language, said he "wouldn't call this
change technically `a credit crunch'" because it isn't a
"contraction of lending on a major scale." But he conceded
that to borrowers this distinction may be perceived as "a
semantic nicety."</p>
<p>In its semiannual report to Congress, the Fed said that
forecasts by members of the reserve board and presidents of
district Federal Reserve banks anticipate that the economy
will grow by about 1.5% to 2% between the fourth quarter of
1989 and the fourth quarter of 1990, after adjusting for
inflation. The Fed policy makers now see consumer prices
climbing between 4.5% and 5% in the same period; in February,
their price forecast was between 4% and 4.5%.</p>
<p>For next year, the Fed policy makers see a pickup in
growth and a slowdown in inflation. They expect the economy
to grow between 1.75% and 2.5% after inflation and expect
consumer prices to climb between 3.75% and 4.5%.</p>
<p>The Fed expects unemployment, currently at 5.2% of the
work force, to climb to between 5.5% and 5.75% by the end of
this year and to between 5.5% and 6% by the end of next year.
Mr. Greenspan said the jobless rate has remained as low as it
has because of "a surprising decline" in young people,
particularly women, who are working or looking for work. He
said this may be a statistical fluke, but he suggested that
slower-than-anticipated growth in the labor force could be a
constraint on economic growth.</p>
<p>As part of its long-run objective of reducing the
inflation rate, the Fed also said that its goal is for the M2
measure of the money supply to grow between 2.5% and 6.5%
next year, down a notch from the 3% to 7% range set for 1990,
a range it reaffirmed recently. M2 includes currency,
checking accounts and most savings accounts.</p>
<p>The target growth range for M3, which includes M2 plus
large certificates of deposit and some other instruments, was
lowered to between 1% and 5% for both 1990 and 1991; in
February, the Fed set this range at 2.5% to 6.5%. Mr.
Greenspan said this revision reflects the consolidation of
the thrift industry rather than a policy change.</p>

<p>Forecasts by members of the Federal Reserve Board and
presidents of district reserve banks center around these
ranges.</p>
