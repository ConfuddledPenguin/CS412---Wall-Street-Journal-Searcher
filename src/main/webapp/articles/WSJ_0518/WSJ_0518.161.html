	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Two major rating concerns lowered their
ratings on about $2 billion of the senior debt of Dayton
Hudson Corp.
   They said the moves reflected the increased financial risk
associated with the planned acquisition of the Marshall Field
department store chain for $1.04 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Standard & Poor's Corp. downgraded Dayton Hudson's senior
unsecured debt to single-A from single-A-plus and removed it
from CreditWatch where it was placed April 23.</p>
<p>S&P said the Minneapolis-based retailer's debt to
capitalization ratio has edged progressively higher in recent
years, a result of share repurchases and debt-financed
acquisitions. It said the purchase of Marshall Field,
expected to be financed with long-term borrowings, will
increase the company's leverage even more.</p>
<p>Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered the company's
senior debt ratings to single-A-3 from single-A-2 and its
commercial paper to Prime-2 from Prime-1. Moody's said the
downgrading recognizes the "increased debt levels, reduced
cash flow coverage, and the challenges of integrating the
Marshall Field acquisition into the company's existing
department store operations."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Dayton Hudson couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
