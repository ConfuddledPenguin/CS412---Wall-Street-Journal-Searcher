	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Assets of the nation's 507 money-market funds
fell $1.78 billion to $381.71 billion in the week ended
Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute, a
Washington trade association.
   Assets of 245 general-purpose funds fell $640.3 million to
$131.53 billion; assets of 102 broker-dealer funds fell $1.41
billion to $158.43 billion; and assets of 160 institutional
funds rose $270.1 million to $91.75 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Yields on money-market funds inched up, and the yield
differential favoring money-market funds over alternative
investment vehicles available to individuals widened by a
few" hundredths of a percentage point, said Jacob Dreyer,
vice president and chief economist for the institute. "And
yet assets in individual accounts declined again as
individuals have drawn on their money-market-fund balances to
pay for stepped-up purchases of equities and equity-fund
shares as well as for Treasury bills and notes bought at last
week's auction."</p>
<p>The latest drop was the eighth-consecutive week of decline
for money-market-fund assets. The total drop for the eight
weeks was about $10.5 billion, and "I think there are a
couple of pretty good reasons," Mr. Dreyer said. "Until
recently, you had a slight creep-up of
{certificate-of-deposit} rates, which means individuals were
shifting money," he said.</p>
<p>During the eight-week period, "institutional balances
barely changed," he said. "The whole bloody thing happened in
broker-dealer and general-purpose funds," which are geared to
individuals.</p>
<p>The second reason Mr. Dreyer cited was tax season, when
"people like me who owed money to the {Internal Revenue
Service} paid at the last moment." And third, "in the past
couple of weeks, we've had an excellent stock market, and
people are dabbling" in stocks and stock funds.</p>
<p>Mr. Dreyer said that in the first three weeks of January,
assets rose a total $15.5 billion, "so this is not the end of
the world."</p>
