	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- World sugar futures declined following an
increased estimate of global production.
   The July contract ended with a loss of 0.22 cent a pound
at 14.46 cents after trading as low as 14.36 cents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>F.O. Licht, the West German sugar statistical firm,
increased its estimate of world sugar production for the
1989-90 season ending Aug. 31 by 1.2 million metric tons from
its January estimate, to 107.7 million tons. A metric ton is
equal to 1.1 U.S. short tons, or 2,204.6 pounds.</p>
<p>The firm said declines in output in some areas were more
than offset by a one-million-metric-ton increase in Indian
production. Licht also noted that supplies will remain tight
next season, despite a production increase of between three
million and five million tons.</p>
<p>After the close of trading, Reuter reported that Brazil is
not expected to produce enough ethanol from its 1990-91 sugar
crop, which will begin being harvested June 1, to satisfy
domestic demand, according to the director of the Society of
Alcohol Producers in Brazil.</p>
<p>The official estimated that Brazil would produce 12.8
billion liters of sugar-based ethanol from the 1990-91 sugar
crop, up 7.6% from 11.9 billion liters during the current
season. However, he said ethanol use during 1990-91 is
estimated at 13.5 billion liters. A liter is equal to 0.264
gallon.</p>
<p>Brazil is scheduled to buy three million hectoliters of
wine alcohol from the European Community on May 29. Pedro
Luis Toddling, sugar adviser at Brazil's Trader Coordinating
Bureau, would not comment on reports that Brazil might seek
to buy another three million hectoliters later on, Reuter
said. A hectoliter is 100 liters.</p>
<p>The report that Brazil would buy wine alcohol from the EC
first circulated on Wednesday. It might have had some
price-depressing effect on sugar prices, on the belief that
importing alcohol could help the release of Brazilian sugar
for export, analysts said. However, one analyst said
yesterday that countering this rumor was the belief that
Brazil had pledged not to increase its sugar exports. No
mention was made of Brazilian sugar exports in yesterday's
news report.</p>
<p>Stephen Platt, analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago,
observed that Brazil's action in importing alcohol makes
sense, because "it frees up sugar for exports, and they can
make a greater profit from sugar at current prices."</p>
<p>The expansion of alcohol use in Brazil has far outstripped
available supplies, Mr. Platt said, and the imports will
relieve the situation somewhat.</p>
<p>However, Brazil still continues to have a serious problem
in trying to satisfy the sugar producers and exporters, which
want to have sufficient sugar to export but are losing a lot
of it to alcohol, as well as the alcohol industry, which
represents a heavy investment and also wants to draw from the
same sugar supply, he said.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Pork belly futures prices closed up
the two-cent-a-pound daily price limit for the second day in
a row, and the rally isn't over yet, analysts said. The rally
was a continuation of the similar move Wednesday in the most
heavily traded monthly contracts; that rise was sparked by a
weekly report on pork belly stocks in commercial freezers
outside Chicago that indicated a tightening of belly
supplies. "There's been panic buying the past two days as
people have tried to get back into the market" following a
sustained sell-off last week, said Thomas Morgan, a principal
of Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. Pork
belly futures for July delivery gained two cents to close at
66.37 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Hog
futures prices also rallied. "Hog marketings haven't been up
to expectations," said Walter Kowalski, a futures analyst
with Lind-Waldock Inc. in Chicago. "There's no surplus to
talk about, and that situation could prevail for the rest of
the year," lending support to both hog and pork belly futures
prices, he said. July hog futures gained 0.75 cents a pound
to close at 64.42 cents.</p>
<p>ENERGY: It was a lackluster day in the petroleum pits
yesterday as the June crude oil contract on the New York
Mercantile Exchange drifted 16 cents a barrel lower in light
trading. Products finished slightly higher, with heating oil
outpacing gasoline, perhaps because it has lagged behind
gasoline in moving higher in recent trading sessions,
analysts said. Some traders said the gains in product prices
helped keep crude prices from dropping further. June crude
closed at $18.87 a barrel. Outer months were higher. Trading
seemed unaffected by reports that Shell Oil, a unit of Royal
Dutch/Shell Group, shut down a crude oil pipeline system
following a tanker-barge collision. The pipeline, which moves
crude oil from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest, is expected to
be operating again this afternoon.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose, particularly
platinum, which reacted to reports of labor unrest in South
Africa, the world's leading producer of the metal. July
delivery platinum was up $5.30 an ounce to $492.90. Analysts
said there were reports that platinum miners had walked off
their jobs on Wednesday and that gold miners did the same
yesterday. One analyst said the labor unrest that had been
feared apparently is materializing and added that if the
trend increases, platinum could be strongly affected. South
Africa accounts for over 80% of the world's platinum
production and any disruption would seriously be felt, he
said, more than for gold, which is produced in larger
quantities by a greater variety of countries. South Africa is
also a major gold producer. A significant feature in gold,
the analyst said, was that it had divorced itself from its
relationship with the dollar that had prevailed most of last
year and is now responding more to more-traditional
supply-demand factors.</p>
