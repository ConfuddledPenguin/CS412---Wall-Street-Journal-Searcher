	<p class="article-leader">PacifiCorp resumed its pursuit of Pinnacle West Capital
Corp. with a substantially sweetened $1.82 billion takeover
bid that's all cash and that drops conditions that made it
easier for Pinnacle to reject three previous offers.
   PacifiCorp said its $21-a-share offer includes assumption
of Pinnacle debt of about $1.1 billion and, by removing the
earlier conditions, is intended to be as "clean and clear to
understand" as possible.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the bid is accepted, the combined company would sell
power in eight states and would realign power production and
transmission in the lucrative western U.S. markets.</p>
<p>A.M. Gleason, PacifiCorp president and chief executive
officer, said in a letter made public after being sent to
Richard Snell, Pinnacle's chairman, that "it is time to bring
to a conclusion PacifiCorp's expressions of interest."</p>
<p>Mr. Snell said in an interview that Pinnacle's financial
advisers are studying the proposal, which will be "seriously
considered by the board." Pinnacle might have a response "in
a few days," he said. The next regular board meeting is set
for Wednesday after the annual meeting, but Mr. Snell said a
board meeting might be held before then.</p>
<p>The proposal follows a meeting Tuesday between Messrs.
Gleason and Snell in Portland, Ore., where PacifiCorp is
based. While no formal offer was presented, Mr. Gleason "gave
me a range," Mr. Snell said. In response to a reporter's
question, he said that "in times past (Mr. Gleason) has said
he wouldn't do a hostile situation; there was some intimation
that he might," now.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Pinnacle shares jumped $3.50 to $16.25 on volume of 2.2
million shares. PacifiCorp shares fell 75 cents to $22.25
with 362,000 shares changing hands.</p>
<p>Phoenix, Ariz.-based Pinnacle's principal asset is Arizona
Public Service Co., the state's largest utility. The company
also owns two small investment units and recently sold its
unprofitable uranium-mining operations. PacifiCorp is an
electric utility whose service territories cover parts of
seven states.</p>
<p>Pinnacle had rejected PacifiCorp's earlier offers as
inadequate and not in the best interests of shareholders; but
the tone of Mr. Snell's remarks yesterday seemed somewhat
more receptive, analysts said. They suggested that the cash
terms and amount of the latest offer make it very attractive
and thus difficult for Pinnacle's board to reject.</p>
<p>In February, PacifiCorp offered to swap 0.88 new
PacifiCorp common share for each of Pinnacle's 86.8 million
shares. PacifiCorp valued the bid at $1.69 billion, or $19.47
a share, but Pinnacle said a number of conditions sharply
reduced the offer's value. One analyst said he valued the bid
as low as $10 a share.</p>
<p>PacifiCorp first emerged as a bidder for Pinnacle's
Arizona Public Service unit in November, when Pinnacle stock
was trading at $5.25 a share. The company was considering a
bankruptcy-law filing because of the financial drain from its
MeraBank thrift unit. In March, Pinnacle was released by
regulators of all financial obligations to the thrift after
making a $465 million infusion of capital into it.</p>
<p>"I don't see how (Pinnacle) can refuse" the latest offer,
said Daniel Rudakas, an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc. in
Chicago. "Maybe it's possible to build a case" for $21 a
share, "but I'm amazed." Some of the conditions that were
dropped effectively guaranteed the value of certain Pinnacle
assets, he said.</p>
<p>Other analysts were less worried that PacifiCorp might be
paying too much. "It's a very fair value for Pinnacle even
assuming that the company might accomplish some financial
recovery on its own over the next few years," said Barry
Abramson at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Last year, Pinnacle had a net loss of $551.4 million,
including a $676 million loss from discontinued operations,
on revenue of $1.51 billion.</p>
<p>From the perspective of PacifiCorp holders, Mr. Abramson
said that the proposed acquisition might be "a bit dilutive"
but strategically sound in the long run. PacifiCorp's
territory isn't growing much and despite Arizona's
real-estate problems it has one of the fastest-growing
populations in the country, the analyst said. Last year,
PacifiCorp posted net income of $465.6 million, or $3.62 a
share, on revenue of $3.72 billion.</p>
<p>PacifiCorp has said that the proposed acquisition would
give it new routes to transmit power to rich California
markets. In addition, PacifiCorp's Northwest markets need
peak power during winter months, while the Southwest needs
peak power during summer months, allowing more efficient use
of peak-power generation.</p>
<p>PacifiCorp's reputation as one of the nation's most
aggressive thrifts is underscored by its dogged pursuit of
Pinnacle. PacifiCorp said it has discussed its bid with its
banks and other lenders and they have indicated that "this is
a feasible transaction."</p>
<p>Any bank borrowings made in connection with the offer
would be paid down with proceeds from equity offerings, the
company said. Pinnacle's financial advisers are First Boston
Corp. and Salomon Brothers Inc.</p>
