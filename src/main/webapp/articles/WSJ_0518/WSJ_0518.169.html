agreed to end their association." Mr. Balson, 48 years old,
had been Lear's top executive for a year. He couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>

industry and becoming part of a larger group of magazines,"
the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Ms. Lear said no replacement will be named for Mr. Balson
and she will reassume the duties of chief executive.</p>
