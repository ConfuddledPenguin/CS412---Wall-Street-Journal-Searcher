	<p class="article-leader">Swedish appliance giant AB Electrolux said pretax profit
plummeted 41% in the first quarter and warned that weak
demand in several key markets is likely to persist for the
rest of the year.
   Electrolux's pretax profit skidded to 511 million kronor
($85 million) from 871 million kronor a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Electrolux Chief Executive Anders Scharp told shareholders
at the Stockholm-based company's annual meeting that plunging
aluminum prices -- which hurt the company's Granges metals
unit -- and fierce price competition in U.S. appliance
markets accounted for most of the profit decline. And he
remained skeptical about a rapid recovery, citing in
particular hefty cost increases that are eating into profit
margins in countries where Electrolux has concentrated its
production.</p>
<p>As a result, Mr. Scharp said Electrolux would make fewer
acquisitions and reduce the heady level of capital
expenditures it has maintained in recent years. But in an
immediate exception to that cautious policy, the company
separately announced its first major step into Eastern
Europe.</p>
<p>Electrolux said it agreed with the Hungarian government to
acquire a majority stake in the country's biggest appliance
maker, Lehel.</p>
