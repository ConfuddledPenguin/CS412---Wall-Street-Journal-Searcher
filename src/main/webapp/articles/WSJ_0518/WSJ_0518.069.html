	<p class="article-leader">The boom years may be over in the mutual fund industry,
according to a confidential report prepared for the
Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group.
   The final report won't be released until this summer. But
already, word of it is causing a stir among fund executives
because it predicts a slower growing and less profitable
mutual fund industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among the conclusions: In the 1990s, the annual boost in
fund industry assets coming from new money will amount to
3.1% a year, down from nearly 10% in the past 15 years.</p>
<p>The report's author is Heidi Fiske, a New York financial
consultant and former reporter with Institutional Investor
magazine. She was hired by the Investment Company Institute
in early 1989 to prepare a special report on "The Environment
for the Investment Company Industry in the 1990s."</p>
<p>"We conclude . . . that the extraordinary boom which the
industry experienced in the 1980s was in many respects an
aberration, created by factors such as the long rise in the
stock market and the explosion of money market funds," Ms.
Fiske wrote in a confidential interim report dated Jan. 15.
"The industry can look forward to moderate growth . . . but
to expect that the growth rates of the 1980s will persist
into the next decade appears unrealistic."</p>
<p>Until Ms. Fiske's final report is out this summer, the
Investment Company Institute is allowing only a small group
of fund executives to see the report. But Ms. Fiske presented
some of the report's highlights at last week's ICI general
membership meeting.</p>
<p>"Virtually all observers expect a margin squeeze in the
decade ahead," Ms. Fiske wrote. She expects intensified
competition from banks, insurers and foreign firms,
particularly the Japanese.</p>
<p>Many fund executives might hope that a slowdown in the
number of new funds would ease pressure on profit margins.
But Ms. Fiske reckons the proliferation of new funds may
continue, and that the fund industry will also face
intensified competition from other financial products such as
bank common trust funds and "wrap" accounts that allow
investors to hire a personal money manager even though they
have relatively small amounts to invest.</p>
<p>Fund industry assets jumped tenfold in the 1980s, but Ms.
Fiske's report predicts much slower growth over the coming
decade. The report suggests that fund industry assets will
grow from $1 trillion today to $3.5 trillion in the year
2000. Money will pour in at a rate of just $58 billion a
year. That means three-quarters of the industry's asset
growth will come from appreciation of existing assets.</p>
<p>Though money-market funds now account for almost half of
fund industry assets, Ms. Fiske's report suggests they will
shrink to 31% of assets by the end of the decade. Stock and
bond funds will account for the remaining 69%, though the
report doesn't spell out exactly how industry assets will
divide up between bonds and stocks.</p>
<p>But Ms. Fiske clearly thinks stock funds could turn out to
be the industry's big winner in the 1990s. She reckons
investors, worried about money for retirement and their
children's college education, will turn to stocks in search
of higher investment returns.</p>
