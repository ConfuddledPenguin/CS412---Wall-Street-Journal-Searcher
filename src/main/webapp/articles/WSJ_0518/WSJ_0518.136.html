	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Joining the noisy parade of green claims, a
unit of Unilever Group says it's testing recyclable packaging
in the U.S. for its Snuggle liquid fabric softener and Wisk
liquid laundry detergent.
   Procter & Gamble Co. already has announced plans to
package its Tide, Cheer and Era liquid laundry detergents and
liquid Downy fabric softener in bottles made partly from
recycled plastic, starting this fall. Colgate-Palmolive Co.
is also beginning to use recycled plastics in its bottles of
Palmolive dishwashing liquid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lever Brothers, a U.S. subsidiary of the Anglo-Dutch
consumer-products maker, said it is looking at packaging
one-gallon sizes of the liquid laundry products in a
corrugated paper box lined with a plastic bag. The new design
uses 75% less plastic than the traditional heavy plastic
bottle. Once the container is empty, the plastic liner can be
separated from the carton, so the pieces can be recycled.</p>
<p>Lever has been shipping the new boxes since February to
retailers in eight states in the upper Midwest and Northwest.
If the test is a success, the company will introduce them
nationally. Lever has no results from its tests yet. "We're
still waiting to hear what the consumer has to say about it,"
said Greg Creed, environmental marketing category manager.</p>
<p>Despite the interest in protecting the environment, green
packaging isn't risk-free. U.S. consumers have been loath to
sacrifice convenience for environmental benefits. When
Wendy's International Inc. attempted to replace foam plates
with flimsier paper plates, for example, consumers balked.
Consumers also resisted PepsiCo Inc.'s plan to sell some soda
in three-liter plastic bottles. The jumbo bottles, which cut
down on trash, didn't fit easily into refrigerators.</p>
<p>There are some signs of change. Late last year, P&G
cautiously began testing refill pouches for liquid household
products in Washington, D.C., and Baltimore. P&G officials
expected consumer resistance, even though some refills
require 75% less packaging. But sales have been surprisingly
strong, and now the company is expanding its test of pouches
of liquid Downy concentrate to six states in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Lever officials said they weren't expecting an adverse
consumer reaction to the "bag-in-box" packaging, which has
been used in the past by the beverage industry. The packaging
is not refillable, and is relatively simple to use. To
pursuade skeptical consumers, Lever rolled out the new boxes
on a carpet of coupons, offering $1 off on Wisk and $1.50 off
on Snuggle. "We believe these brand names, with their
inherent strength, will reassure consumers who are worried
about the change," said Mr. Creed.</p>
