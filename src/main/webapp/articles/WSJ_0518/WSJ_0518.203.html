	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Scientific-Atlanta Inc., in a move to build the
audience for high-definition television, said it will supply
a HDTV system to Comsat Video Enterprises.
   Comsat, a unit of Washington-based Communications
Satellite Corp., will use the system to broadcast live events
to selected locations, particularly its current stronghold,
pay-per-view TVs in hotels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Scientific-Atlanta didn't disclose the value of the
contract, but the HDTV system is the third that it has agreed
to provide during the past year, said William E. Johnson, the
company's chief executive officer. The previous two were with
Canadian companies that planned to use the technology for
live broadcasts to movie theaters, he said.</p>
<p>In HDTV systems, Scientific-Atlanta transmits signals
between TV studios or sites where events originate and the
point at which they are distributed to movie theaters or
closed-circuit TV sets. The company provides the equipment to
beam the signal to a satellite and back to receiving
stations, converting it for local broadcast.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Comsat order gives a boost to U.S.
efforts in one area of the international competition to
develop HDTV technology. "It shows we're not conceding the
field to the Japanese," said Eric C. Buck, an analyst with
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.</p>
<p>Comsat, which provides pay-per-view television to about
1,700 hotels, will first use the new system to broadcast
singer Dionne Warwick's AIDS benefit concert, scheduled for
June 30, to hotels in 20 cities across the country, said
Robert J. Wussler, Comsat's president and chief executive
officer. He said the hotels will be supplied with monitors
capable of receiving the high-definition signal.</p>
