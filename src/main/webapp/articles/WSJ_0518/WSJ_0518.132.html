	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- If it's dirt Jesse Helms is after, then the
North Carolina senator ought to check out a certain
second-floor art gallery in a SoHo apartment building here in
lower Manhattan.
   Unlike some of the artworks Sen. Helms has attacked
recently, the display has nothing to do with naked men, icons
submerged in urine or even bad language. It is, however, the
ultimate filth -- a room full of dirt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In gallery lingo, the New York "Earth Room" is an
installation. Artist Walter De Maria installed in a long,
narrow space a lumpy carpet about two feet deep of rich,
black, pungent soil.</p>
<p>At 3,600 square feet, the display is bigger than the
average New York apartment. And it affects people deeply . .
. or leaves them cold.</p>
<p>Visitors walk down a corridor and stop in a wide doorway,
where they confront 280,000 pounds of soil, nothing more,
held back by a knee-high clear-plastic barrier.</p>
<p>Some Japanese tourists stop in the doorway and take
pictures. German art students stare, rapt. (Their professor
had told them not to miss this.) A middle-aged New York
couple bicker about whether it truly is art.</p>
<p>"Art is supposed to be uplifting; this does nothing for
me," says John Cartafalsa, a lawyer. "Oh, honey," replies his
wife, Lydia. "If you'd just let your imagination run . . ."
In an aside, she says: "I would love to `run' through it
barefoot."</p>
<p>Nearly 200 people -- the biggest turnout ever -- showed up
on the eve of Earth Day this year. (The place is closed
Sundays.) It seemed so right, symbolically.</p>
<p>"They were such a respectful crowd," says Bill Dilworth,
who counts visitors from a desk in the back room and who
waters the dirt weekly to keep it from turning to dust.
"Normally on Saturday," he says, "I get a stunt at least
once, like someone throwing a dirt ball against the wall. But
not these people." They are environmentalists.</p>
<p>Mr. Dilworth is responsible for keeping the dirt wet,
raked and plant-free. He puts on his boots to water and, at
the same time, dig out the mushrooms that have burst forth.
Mr. Dilworth says he likes to do the dirt chunky-style. He
understands that's what the artist prefers.</p>
<p>More than 70,000 visitors altogether have made the trip to
see the Earth Room, which has been here -- free of any
admission charge -- for more than 10 years. And it is not
about to close: It is supposed to go on and on -- like "The
Fantasticks."</p>
<p>The artwork is owned and operated by the Dia Art
Foundation, originally backed entirely by the oil-rich de
Menil family and now also supported by public and private
contributions. The foundation owns the space and devotes
itself to art that nobody else will touch, either because of
"its nature or scale." The Earth Room is both weird and big.</p>
<p>The questions people most often ask about the Earth Room
are: "Why?" and "What does it mean?"</p>
<p>But don't expect an explanation from the foundation, or
from Mr. De Maria, the artist. He is a shy fellow in his 50s,
and he draws the line at discussing his work. The Earth Room
is actually one of his more accessible pieces, if only
because it is in New York: Mr. De Maria's "Las Vegas" is a
rut in the Nevada desert four miles long, eight feet wide and
a foot deep. For "Lightning Field," 400 stainless-steel poles
were stuck straight up in a remote patch of New Mexico. That
installation, which is also maintained by the Dia Foundation,
is supposed to be experienced by visitors for 24 hours
straight, the better to get a flash . . . of insight.</p>
<p>Critics, as is usual with critics, don't all agree about
the Earth Room. Hilton Kramer, editor of the journal New
Criterion, says it has "absolutely no artistic merit" and is
"a waste of time. . . ." Kenneth Baker, author of the book
"Minimalism: Art of Circumstance," says, "It's a major piece.
When you spend some time there, your whole idea of what's
inside and outside and up and down are completely shaken."</p>
<p>One afternoon not long ago, a fellow came by, whipped out
his harmonica and played a happy tune to the empty room.
After about 10 minutes, he left without applause and without
uttering a word. Over the years, visitors have thrown coins,
planted marijuana seeds, and done other things in the
relative privacy they enjoy here. Dancers repeatedly have
asked to perform. One woman inquired: "Is this really
permanent?" because she wanted to scatter her brother's
ashes. Permanent perhaps. Eternal is another matter.</p>
<p>Nobody could have been more disoriented by the prospect of
all this dirt than the Japanese businessman who arrived
clutching a scrap of paper on which was written: "141 Wooster
Street 2B. Best Thing to Do in New York." The man didn't know
if he was looking for a restaurant, a massage parlor or what.
"I explained," says Mr. Dilworth, "and he started coming
regularly and staying longer. After a month, he said he had
to go back to Japan, and he would miss it." Mr. Dilworth
figures the Earth Room must be famous in Tokyo, because a
Japanese film crew was here once, making a movie.</p>
<p>Many visitors have been unable to suppress the urge to get
down and dirty. The exhibit can't be seen by the man at the
desk, and there are no surveillance cameras. So mischief is
always a possibility. "There were always stories about people
having sex in there," says Donald Baechler, a painter who
worked the desk in 1980. "I can't remember anymore if they
really did."</p>
