	<p class="article-leader">Call it the first Fax of Independence.
   Last June, secessionist rebels on the bejungled South
Pacific island of Bougainville closed down one of the world's
largest copper mines, the Panguna mine principally owned by
CRA Ltd., Australia's largest mining company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On Thursday, Reuters news agency reported, the rebels
declared their independence from the nation of Papua New
Guinea by sending a facsimile message to government offices,
foreign missions and to the news agency.</p>
<p>It began: "I, Francis Ona, interim president of the
Republic of Bougainville, do hereby proclaim" the island to
be "a sovereign democratic and independent nation."</p>
<p>Government officials say they'll ignore it.</p>
<p>Mr. Ona, a former mine surveyor, is a 35-year-old
Bougainvillean and rebel leader. Fighting between the rebels
and government troops over the last 18 months has taken
nearly 100 lives.</p>
