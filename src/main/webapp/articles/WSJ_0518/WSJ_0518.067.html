	<p class="article-leader">Ragu Fresh Italian, the newest combatant in the
spaghetti-sauce wars, has rivals and regulators in a stew
over what constitutes freshness.
   Ragu Foods Inc.'s $20 million campaign to promote the
product includes splashy print ads and prime-time television
spots of plump red tomatoes being sliced for the bottled
sauce. But the Food and Drug Administration is vigorously
challenging the freshness claim, and all of Ragu's hard work
could go down the drain if the agency persists.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sauce itself, made from heat-processed tomato
concentrate reconstituted with water, is fine, says the FDA.
But calling it "fresh" isn't accurate. Indeed, the term is
"false and misleading," the FDA wrote in a recent letter to
Ragu, a unit of the Anglo-Dutch Unilever Group.</p>
<p>Agency rules prohibit use of the term "fresh" for any
heat-processed food that isn't refrigerated. So the FDA has
ordered Ragu to correct the violations promptly or face
"regulatory sanctions such as seizure and/or injunction."</p>
<p>Ragu, the leader in the keenly competitive pasta-sauce
market, with a 45.9% share by volume, is sticking by its
sauce. The battle is important: Americans spent about $1.1
billion on pasta sauces last year, and since the mid-1980s
the market has been growing by about 7% yearly.</p>
<p>Ragu maintains that "Fresh Italian" is just a trade name,
like the trade names of other products, such as Poppin' Fresh
biscuit dough, made by Pillsbury Co., a unit of Grand
Metropolitan PLC, of Britain; and Contadina Fresh
refrigerated pasta sauce, made by Carnation Co., a subsidiary
of Nestle S.A., of Switzerland.</p>
<p>To bolster its claims, Ragu has given the FDA a list of
about 500 processed products that use "fresh" in their names.
If the FDA refuses to allow Ragu to use "fresh," hundreds of
other products may have to be renamed, the company says.</p>
<p>Besides, boasts Ragu, the Fresh Italian version is thicker
and fresher than competing brands and other Ragu products.
Consumers apparently agree. In the first six months of its
national rollout, the Fresh Italian line has captured about
8.2% of the spaghetti-sauce market. It also has become the
centerpiece of Ragu's strategy to recoup market share from
Campbell Soup Co.'s Prego, the No. 2 brand with a 24.9%
share. Since Campbell introduced Prego in 1981, Ragu has lost
an average of one percentage point of market share a year.</p>
<p>Ragu accuses Campbell and a group of small tomato
processors of seeking to use the FDA to bolster their
competitive positions. "The complaints are coming from folks
who are using the same processes," the Ragu spokeswoman says,
adding that Campbell markets a Prego sauce with "fresh"
mushrooms. "We think it's very unfair to single out Ragu."</p>
<p>Campbell concedes it put the FDA onto Ragu in the first
place -- but only to prevent Ragu from gaining an unfair
advantage. When Campbell saw early samples of Ragu's "fresh"
product last summer, the company asked the FDA if Campbell
could use "fresh" on its Prego line of sauces, which are also
made from concentrate. When the FDA said no, Campbell
complained. "How come they can do `fresh' and we can't?" asks
Robert Subin, sector general manager for grocery products.</p>
<p>After an investigation, the FDA warned Ragu in September
that the sauce would violate labeling regulations. Ragu,
convinced it was in the right, went ahead with the
introduction anyway.</p>
<p>Since then, however, several consumer organizations and
small tomato processors have complained. And at least four
states -- Texas, New York, Florida, and Tennessee -- have
threatened to take their own legal actions if the FDA doesn't
do something soon.</p>
<p>With several food-labeling bills also being considered in
Congress, the FDA concedes that it is obliged to give Ragu
and its parent, Unilever, more than a slap on the wrist.
"There is such pressure for the agency to do something on
food labeling," says an FDA spokeswoman. "And the FDA is
right: This is not a fresh product."</p>
<p>But the agency says it is still mulling its options,
ranging from negotiating a mutually satisfactory name or
label change to outright impounding of the sauce.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the prospect of Ragu wasting $20 million to
establish a brand that may soon be pulled off the shelves has
Campbell licking its lips. "We were astounded," says Mr.
Subin. "With that kind of forewarning" from the FDA, "it was
probably a foolish effort to go through and spend that much
money."</p>
