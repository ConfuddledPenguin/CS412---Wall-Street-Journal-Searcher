	<p class="article-leader">Ashland Oil Inc. said its exploration unit agreed to buy
natural gas properties from an Occidental Petroleum Corp.
unit for $107 million.
   The Ashland, Ky., company said it will acquire about
550,000 acres of producing and undeveloped properties in West
Virginia and Kentucky from Los Angeles-based Occidental's OXY
USA Inc. subsidiary. Production averages about 16 million
cubic feet a day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ashland said the acquisition, which is subject to certain
government approvals, will double its acreage of gas
properties. The company already produces 39 million cubic
feet a day from about 500,000 acres in Appalachia. Many of
the new sites are contiguous to Ashland's properties.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Appalachian properties are valuable
because of their proximity to Eastern U.S. markets, among
other things. "Producers in the region will be in a good
position" as reserves in other areas are depleted, said
Bernard Picchi, an analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. in New
York.</p>
