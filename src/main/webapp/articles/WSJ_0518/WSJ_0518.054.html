	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Amrep Corp., a builder of communities and
international distributor of magazines, said it agreed to
sell water and sewer utility systems serving Rio Rancho and
Santa Fe, N.M., to a subsidiary of GWC Corp., a Wilmington,
Del., water utility holding company, for more than $36
million.
   Of the proceeds, about $20.5 million will be used to repay
utility debt, and part of the remainder will be applied to
reduce other debt, with the balance to be added to working
capital.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale, subject to approval by the New Mexico Public
Service Commission, includes the Rio Rancho water and sewer
system and the small water utility serving Amrep's Eldorado
subdivision in Santa Fe.</p>
