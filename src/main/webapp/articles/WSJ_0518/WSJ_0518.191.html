	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Robert Campeau, chairman and chief executive
officer of Campeau Corp., was ordered by the Supreme Court of
Ontario to repay $12.6 million Canadian dollars (US$10.7
million) of personal loans owed to Bank of Nova Scotia,
according to court documents.
   The bank sued Mr. Campeau in February, claiming that he
defaulted on personal loans against which he had pledged
1,125,000 shares of his Campeau stock. The court order allows
the bank to seize the shares or any other assets held in Mr.
Campeau's name. Bank of Nova Scotia declined to comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bank of Nova Scotia is one of three big Canadian banks
that have sued Mr. Campeau over defaults on C$192.3 million
of personal loans. In April, Bank of Montreal obtained a
court judgment ordering Mr. Campeau to repay C$26.7 million
of loans, but it hasn't seized any of his assets.</p>
<p>National Bank of Canada sued Mr. Campeau in February,
claiming that he defaulted on about C$153 million of personal
loans. But last month, National Bank agreed to settle the
loans for C$80 million and to return to Mr. Campeau the
Campeau shares and convertible debentures it had seized from
him in January. Mr. Campeau has until May 31 to pay National
Bank the first C$40 million and regain the securities, which
would again make him the largest shareholder in the company
that bears his name. He has until Jan. 31, 1991 to pay
National Bank the remaining C$40 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Campeau's Toronto lawyer, John DesBrisay, said he
hopes to conclude negotiations regarding the Bank of Montreal
and Bank of Nova Scotia loans before the end of this month.</p>
<p>"We're trying to reach an accommodation like the one we
reached with the National Bank," Mr. DesBrisay said.</p>
<p>Mr. Campeau had used funds from the bank loans to buy
Campeau stock. He stopped making payments on the loans last
fall when the price of Campeau stock began to plummet on news
that its U.S. retailing units, Federated Department Stores
Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., were in financial difficulty.
In January, Federated and Allied sought protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</p>
