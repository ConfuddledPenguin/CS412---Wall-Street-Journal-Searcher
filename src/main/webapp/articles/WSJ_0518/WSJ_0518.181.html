	<p class="article-leader">Outboard Marine Corp., a Waukegan, Ill., maker of marine
engines and recreational power boats, said it will take a $3
million charge in its third quarter ending June 30 from the
closing of one of its outboard-motor assembly plants this
fall.
   Outboard also said it will idle its eight other U.S.
marine power-products plants for several weeks during the
remainder of its year ending Sept. 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-earlier quarter, Outboard earned $6.8 million,
or 35 cents a share, on sales of $465.9 million.</p>
<p>The company said it will close its Rutherfordton, N.C.,
plant in November to reduce costs and increase operating
efficiencies, and idle the other plants to avoid building
excessive inventories of marine engines during the continuing
industrywide sales slump. The Rutherfordton plant, which has
290 employees, assembles Johnson and Evinrude outboard
motors; assembly operations there will be consolidated at
Outboard's other outboard assembly facility in Calhoun, Ga.,
creating as many as 200 jobs. The company expects that the
consolidation could save as much as $3 million annually.</p>
