	<p class="article-leader">Royal Dutch/Shell Group said first-quarter net income
dropped 36% to #816 million ($1.37 billion) from #1.28
billion a year earlier, within analysts' expectations on a
historic-cost basis, accounting for changes in values of
inventories.
   On a current-cost basis, valuing the company's oil
inventories at current market prices, profit fell 26% to #826
million from #1.11 billion. Operating profit edged up 2.8% to
#1.48 billion from #1.44 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earnings per share for Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., the
Dutch arm, fell 45% to 3.03 guilders ($1.64), and for Shell
Transport & Trading Co., the British segment, dropped 36% to
9.1 pence a share.</p>
<p>Sales rose 22% to #17.5 billion from #14.3 billion a year
earlier. Excluding taxes and excise duties, sales rose 24% to
#14.2 billion from #11.4 billion.</p>
<p>Shell's exploration and production operations surged 73%
to #508 million. Refining and marketing lines fell 15% to
#290 million, hurt by a #14 million loss in the U.S. from
higher raw material costs. In the 1989 first quarter, Shell
had a #57 million gain in the U.S. Chemical profit plummeted
56% to #159 million; U.S. chemical sales fell. Coal and
metals earnings were flat.</p>
