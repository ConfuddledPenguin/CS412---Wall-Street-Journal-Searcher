	<p class="article-leader">BOGOTA, Colombia -- A senior official of Colombia's
beleaguered government charged that restrictive U.S. trade
policies and failure to deliver on aid is impeding Colombia's
ability to fight the drug war.
   In an interview here, the official, who requested
anonymity, disclosed that Colombia sent the Bush
administration a "package of trade, technical and financial"
assistance requests more than two months ago and has received
no reply from the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plan, the official said, was sent in the wake of an
anti-drug summit in the Colombian coastal city of Cartagena
in February that brought together President Bush and the
leaders of the three Andean nations, Colombia, Peru and
Bolivia. At the summit, the U.S. agreed to place more
emphasis on trade and aid to help wean the Andean countries
from their economic dependence on cocaine, rather than
provide mostly a military and police response. But, the
official said, the U.S. isn't living up to its promise.</p>
<p>"We were very hopeful, especially after Cartagena," the
official said. But now, Colombia feels a "negative attitude"
from the U.S., he said, adding, "It looks like they're not
interested." Alluding to recent U.S. decision to start a $35
million military aid program in Peru, the official said: "The
response of the U.S. is the traditional response to these
problems -- more military, more U.S. troops, more aircraft
carriers, not practical solutions on the ground."</p>
<p>In Washington, the White House disputed claims that the
administration hasn't followed through on commitments made in
Cartagena. "We have been communicating with the Colombians
and doing things for them, so to imply that we haven't been
responsive is incorrect," said a White House spokesman.</p>
<p>He said the requests alluded to by the Colombian official
are a "very broadbased list of things, most of which would
require special legislation to give special advantages to the
Colombians." The suggestion that these requests, many of them
trade-related, can be accomplished in a matter of months
"shows a lack of understanding of the U.S. political system."</p>
