	<p class="article-leader">BEIJING -- The cost of living in Chinese cities rose 4.6%
in April, compared with April 1989, China's State Statistical
Bureau reported. It was the biggest monthly inflation climb
so far this year.
   The bureau said the increase was caused mainly by a 14.1%
rise in vegetable prices and a 15% rise in service charges.
The cost-of-living increase for the first quarter was 4.4%
over the 1989 level.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A brief report on the bureau's statistics carried by the
official Xinhua News Agency didn't link the stepped-up
inflation to a recent government loosening of its tight
credit policy. The government pullback was credited for a
slight pickup in industrial production in April after a
stagnant first quarter.</p>
