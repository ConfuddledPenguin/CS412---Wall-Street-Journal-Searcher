	<p class="article-leader">In your April 25 article on Michael Milken ("Reactions to
Milken: Villain or Victim?"), lawyer Joe Jamail explained
that he would be troubled by a stiff prison sentence that
punished "for vengeance's sake." As a law student, I do not
wish to presume more knowledge than a practicing lawyer.
However, my understanding of modern criminal law is that we
do punish for punishment's sake. The notion of
rehabilitation, while noble, has long since been abandoned as
the primary goal of the U.S. punishment system. In this
light, Mr. Milken clearly deserves more than a financial slap
on the wrist.

<p>I predict that someday -- when laws that make it a crime
to succeed at business are gone -- Michael Milken will be a
hero in the history books as the most spectacularly innocent
victim of a witch hunt.</p>

<p>A few reactions to the "Reactions:"</p>
<p>For Charles H. Keating Jr., executive: Of course "you
don't put Michelangelo or da Vinci in jail." But Michael was
no Michelangelo, and you're no da Vinci. Maybe you and
Michael can be cellmates.</p>
<p>For Rabbi Arnold Wolf, who commented, "He should be hung
by his thumbs for years and years and years. He's a very
terrible person." Come on, Rabbi -- don't hold back, tell us
what you really think.</p>
<p>For Stephen A. Wynn, CEO, Golden Nugget, who says Michael
doesn't belong in prison: You roll the dice and take your
chances.</p>
<p>For Rep. John Dingell, who questions the settlement: The
Milken crimes pale in comparison with the fraud committed by
the U.S. Congress on the American public in cooking the
government's books each year. Our children and grandchildren
should have us all put away.</p>
<p>For The Wall Street Journal: I missed your reaction, or
perhaps you were too busy wiping the egg off your faces with
your old editorials.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>As always, history as written will be what the historian
says it is. It is to be hoped that the reason of gentlemen
like H. Ross Perot will be the loudest -- "Don't govern your
life by what's legal or illegal, govern it by what's right or
wrong." Simple but clear words that can be used as a guide to
live by.</p>
<p>With thoughtfulness and honesty, history will, I hope,
expose the rationalization of gentlemen such as Mr. Keating
as what it truly is -- pure and unadulterated bunk. To
suggest that the monkeys be put in charge of the peanuts is
to deny the reality of the situation. Mr. Milken did not cop
a plea because he is faultless. For his crimes he must be
held accountable. After he pays his debt to society he very
well may be able to contribute to worthwhile causes. To cast
him as a victim, suggest he be placed in a position of public
trust and place him in the category of Michelangelo and da
Vinci is at best weak and self-serving.</p>
