	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French computer maker Cie. des Machines Bull
denied a French press report alleging that France's
intelligence service carried out industrial espionage against
International Business Machines Corp., Texas Instruments Inc.
and other U.S. technology companies.
   The report, in the news magazine L'Express, said the
French foreign espionage service, the Direction Generale de
la Securite Exterieure, recruited senior officials at the
U.S. companies' French subsidiaries. The article claimed that
senior French government officials were worried that, without
the espionage, Bull would have trouble catching up with the
competition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It said the theft of research and marketing secrets began
around 1987 and ended late in 1989 when the U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation and Central Intelligence Agency
confronted the spies. The executives in question were fired,
the magazine said, and the news covered up to avoid scandal.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for IBM in Armonk, N.Y., and for Texas
Instruments in Dallas declined to comment, as did the French
government. The head of security at Texas Instruments' Nice
headquarters said he wasn't aware of any espionage. He said
that there is a regular turnover in management officials at
Texas Instruments' French subsidiary but that he isn't aware
of anyone being fired for stealing secrets.</p>
<p>A Bull official said the company posted a loss of 267
million francs ($48.1 million) last year, compared with
profit of 303 million francs in 1988. But the official said
Bull is on the mend, is advancing through an aggressive
acquisition strategy and operates entirely independently of
the French government.</p>
<p>"We formally deny this report," said the Bull official.
"We haven't any relationship with the DGSE."</p>
