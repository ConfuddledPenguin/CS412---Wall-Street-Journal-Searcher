	<p class="article-leader">For many years tax policy played little or no role in
development economics. Textbooks barely mentioned the
subject. To a large extent, this followed from a lack of
attention paid to the incentive effects of taxation in the
industrialized nations following the triumph of Keynesian
economics. Many developing countries simply adopted wholesale
the tax systems of their colonial rulers without ever asking
themselves whether a tax system that may be appropriate to an
advanced industrial country is really appropriate to the
special problems of a small developing country.
   As a consequence, most developing countries, as well as
the industrialized nations, have had extremely high marginal
tax rates on both capital and labor. Although little, if any,
revenue was collected by such rates, they satisfied the
political desire to be egalitarian and justified the
imposition of high tax rates on the general population. Until
a few years ago it was not at all uncommon to find top
marginal tax rates of 90% or more throughout the
industrialized world. Even the U.S. had a top marginal income
tax rate of 91% until 1964.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This has now changed, partly as the result of the decline
of Keynesian economics and changing intellectual fashions,
and partly because of real world experience. It is now very
rare to find top marginal income tax rates above 50% in the
major industrialized countries. Even Sweden hopes to get its
top rate down to this level shortly. Many Third World
countries also have adopted important tax reforms that
lowered the marginal tax rate, broadened the tax base and
rationalized the tax treatment of capital and labor. In this
respect, Bolivia, which now has essentially a 10% flat-rate
tax, may be the quintessential example.</p>
<p>"Worldwide Tax Reform: Case Studies of Developed and
Developing Countries" (ICS Press, 332 pages, $29.95),
published under the auspices of the International Center for
Economic Growth in San Francisco and edited by Michael J.
Boskin and Charles E. McClure Jr., tells the story of how
this radical change in policy happened. The editors are
particularly well-suited to the task: Mr. Boskin was a leader
in the analysis of the incentive effects of taxation while a
professor of economics at Stanford and is now chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, while Mr. McClure was deputy
assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax analysis during
the Reagan administration, during which time he helped
develop the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which lowered the top
marginal income tax rate to 28%.</p>
<p>Messrs. Boskin and McClure have assembled some of the
leading tax experts from around the world to examine cases of
tax reform in developed and developing countries. Among the
former are the U.S., Australia, Canada, Israel, Japan, Sweden
and the United Kingdom. The latter includes China, Colombia,
Indonesia and Mexico.</p>
<p>Of special interest is an introductory essay by Arnold
Harberger of the University of Chicago on "Principles of
Taxation Applied to Developing Countries: What Have We
Learned?" Mr. Harberger has long been recognized as one of
the world's leading authorities on taxation and development
economics. The theme of his essay, as well as the individual
case studies, is that high marginal tax rates, heavy taxation
of capital, and distortionary tax systems are deleterious to
growth. The goal of tax policy, in developed and developing
nations, should be to have low marginal tax rates, low
taxation of capital, and as level a playing field as possible
so that different assets, factors of production and forms of
income are taxed similarly. In general, the authors have high
praise for the value-added tax and strongly support
integration of the corporate and individual income tax
systems, inflation indexing of tax systems, and elimination
of distortionary tax incentives, such as tax holidays.</p>
<p>The essays are generally of high quality and for the most
part free of economists' jargon and mathematical equations.
As such, they are accessible to policy-makers as well as
academic tax experts. To the extent there is an unevenness in
the essays, it is due to the unevenness of the tax reform
efforts surveyed. In Sweden, reform efforts are still under
way, while in China they are in the midst of being undone.</p>
<p>One would have preferred to see more of a discussion of
tax reform in the Third World. The tax reform efforts of the
major industrialized countries are fairly well known and have
been well-covered in other recent books. Tax policy in the
less developed countries, however, is an area where little is
known and where the greatest need for reform exists. There
are far too many cases, among them Zambia, where the
economically active population faces tax rates of 70% or more
at the margin, contributing to misallocation of resources,
growth of the underground economy, capital flight, and a
"brain drain" from the Third World.</p>
<p>Although much more needs to be done, "Worldwide Tax
Reform" is an excellent introduction to what has been done
and what we now know about designing a tax system to
encourage growth.</p>
