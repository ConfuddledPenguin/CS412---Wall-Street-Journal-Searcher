	<p class="article-leader">The Pratt & Whitney division of United Technologies Corp.,
Hartford, Conn., said it signed a cooperation agreement with
a Soviet agency that could lead to joint production of
aircraft engines.
   The agreement, also signed by the aircraft engine unit of
Daimler-Benz AG of West Germany, follows the establishment of
several new business relationships between Western and Soviet
aerospace concerns recently. These new links are driven in
large part by Soviet demand for Western technology and an
eagerness in the West to gain access to the huge Soviet
aviation market that is opening up as East-West relations
defrost.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite the West's shifting political posture toward
Moscow, the new links between the Western and Soviet
aerospace concerns face questions about possible technology
transfers of potential military significance. "This is all so
new to everyone, we're writing this book as we go along,"
said a Pratt & Whitney spokesman in East Hartford, Conn.</p>
<p>He said Pratt & Whitney's agreement with the Soviet
Ministry of Aviation Industry and Daimler-Benz's Motoren-und
Turbinen-Union, known as MTU, is aimed at the eventual
development and co-production of jet engines for two new
Soviet passenger planes. The aircraft are the Ilyushin Il-96,
a long-range, four-engine airliner with about 270 seats, and
the Tupolev Tu-204, a twin-engine plane with about 170 seats,
the spokesman said. The accord formalizes and advances
earlier discussions about supplying Pratt & Whitney engines
for these planes, he said.</p>
<p>Under the cooperation agreement, Pratt & Whitney will
consider joint ventures with the Soviets on all but the
biggest commercial jet engines, those producing 50,000 or
more pounds of thrust to power wide-body planes, the
spokesman said. In addition to jet-power plants, the Soviets
want to talk about co-production of turboprop engines, he
said.</p>
<p>The cooperation pact is Pratt & Whitney's latest move in
its hunt for Soviet business. Earlier this year, when the
Soviet airline Aeroflot announced its first purchase of
Western aircraft from Airbus Industrie, a European aircraft
consortium based in France, Pratt & Whitney pressed its case
to the Soviets for fitting the wide-body planes with engines
from East Hartford. But in March, Aeroflot said it would buy
the engines from Fairfield, Conn.-based General Electric Co.
instead.</p>
<p>"They have a very large potential (engine) market," the
Pratt & Whitney spokesman said of the Soviet Union. The
cooperation pact "opens the door for us for further
discussions," he said. He added that the agreement "is more a
market-driven decision than a technology-driven decision, on
our part, in any case."</p>
<p>Besides the Aeroflot purchase of Airbus planes and GE
engines, the recently launched Soviet-Western aerospace
industry relationships include an agreement between
London-based Rolls-Royce PLC, a maker of aircraft engines,
and the Sukhoi and Syulka design bureaus to develop an engine
for a supersonic executive jet that is under joint
development by Sukhoi and Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. of
Savannah, Ga.</p>

in building systems and automotive products, closed at
$57.375, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday.</p>
