	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Kroger Co. said Joseph A. Pichler, president
and chief operating officer of this food store operator, was
elected chief executive officer and will assume the post June
17.
   Pichler, 50, succeeds Lyle Everingham, who has held the
position since 1978. Mr. Everingham, 64, will continue as
chairman until his planned retirement in early 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the company's annual meeting Mr. Everingham told
shareholders that the changeover is "part of an orderly
process designed to ensure continuity and direction. Joe and
I share the same goals and objectives for Kroger."</p>
<p>In 1989 Kroger posted a loss of $72.2 million, or 92 cents
a share, after a charge of $56.5 million related to early
retirement of debt. Sales last year were $19.1 billion.</p>
<p>Kroger took on debt of more than $4 billion two years ago
in a recapitalization that fended off two unsolicited bids.</p>
<p>Mr. Pichler has been president and chief operating officer
of Kroger since October 1986. He was named to Kroger's board
in January 1983, following the company's merger with Dillon
Cos.</p>
