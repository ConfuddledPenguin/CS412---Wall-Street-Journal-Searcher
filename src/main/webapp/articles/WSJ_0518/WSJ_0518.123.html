	<p class="article-leader">AMSTERDAM -- Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV, in an
announcement that was expected, said it is set to expand its
stake in European American Bancorp of the U.S. to 66.3%.
   The Dutch group confirmed it is in advanced negotiations
to acquire the 23.15% stake in EAB now held by Generale de
Banque of Belgium.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Amro holds 20% of EAB and is in the process of acquiring a
23.15% stake from Deutsche Bank of West Germany.</p>
<p>EAB owns a general bank with 88 offices in the New York
City-Long Island region and had a loss of about $80 million
in the first quarter. Factors blamed for the first-quarter
loss were the substantial provisions EAB had to make for
risks related to developments in the real estate market. In
1989, EAB had profit of $61 million.</p>
<p>Amro said the acquisition of a majority interest would
enable it to enhance decision-making processes at EAB.</p>
<p>Amro is seeking approval from the U.S. for its planned
share acquisitions. If effected, EAB will be 66.3% held by
Amro with 23.45% owned by Societe Generale of France and
10.25% held by Creditanstalt Bankverein of Austria.</p>
