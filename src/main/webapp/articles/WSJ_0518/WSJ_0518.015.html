	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Toyota Motor Corp. announced it will manufacture
commercial vehicles in Colombia in a joint project with a
subsidiary of France's Renault and Mitsui & Co., a major
Japanese trading house.
   Toyota officials said their company, Japan's biggest car
maker, has signed agreements with Sociedad de Fabrication de
Automotores Renault S.A. (SOFASA-Renault) and Mitsui. They
said Toyota has also obtained necessary government approval.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement, they said, Bogota-based
SOFASA-Renault will add Toyota's Land Cruiser and Hilux
models to the line of Renault cars it has been producing.</p>
<p>The partners plan to make 4,000 Land Cruisers a year,
beginning in October 1991. Production of the Hilux model is
set for April 1992, at a rate of 3,000 a year, according to
Toyota officials.</p>
<p>The two Toyota models will be marketed through a new
Toyota dealership network that SOFASA-Renault will set up in
the future.</p>
<p>Under the accord, Toyota and Mitsui will also acquire
stakes in SOFASA-Renault. Toyota will pay $10.5 million, and
Mitsui $4.5 million. As a result, Toyota officials said,
SOFASA-Renault will be 74.7% owned by Renault, 17.5% by
Toyota, 7.5% by Mitsui, and the rest by others.</p>
<p>Investment in plant and equipment totaling some $7.3
million will be made for production of the Toyota models,
according to officials.</p>
<p>SOFASA-Renault, employing about 1,600 people, produced
approximately 11,000 cars last year.</p>
