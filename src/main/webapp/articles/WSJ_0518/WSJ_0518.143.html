	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Aca Joe Inc. said it named
retail-clothing veteran Mark Shulman as president and a
director of the company, succeeding Peter Muller, who
resigned.
   Mr. Shulman said Mr. Muller resigned to pursue other
interests. However, Mr. Muller couldn't be reached for
comment on the move.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The casual-apparel company said the 41-year-old Mr.
Shulman, who served since 1987 as president and chief
executive officer of Henri Bendel of New York, will add the
chief executive position to his list of duties at Aca Joe on
June 19. As chief executive, he will succeed Alice Lam, who
will remain chairman and a director.</p>
<p>Before his tenure at Bendel, Mr. Shulman was president and
chief executive of Ann Taylor. He has also served in
retailing positions with Bloomingdale's in New York and I.
Magnin in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Mr. Shulman said he plans to take the next 30 to 60 days
to evaluate what needs to be done with the clothing retailer,
which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings just
over a year ago.</p>
<p>"The first order of business is to get the stores looking
the way they should," he said. Better visual display, better
sales associates, and better merchandising lead the list of
tasks, he said. "I think people will tend to see a change in
merchandise around the holidays," he added.</p>
