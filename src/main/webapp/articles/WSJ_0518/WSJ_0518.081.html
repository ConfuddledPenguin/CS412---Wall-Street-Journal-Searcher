	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- The U.S. government intends to push for far
broader moves by Japan to open its financial markets, and the
tack could spur greater political opposition here than
previous discussions.
   In the past, the U.S. has primarily sought specific
openings for U.S. banks and securities firms into Japan's
financial markets on a case-by-case basis. But this time
around, the U.S. is seeking broad deregulation of deposit
rates, widespread direct dealings in the currency markets and
greater opportunity for foreign financial institutions to
manage Japanese cash.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Washington's wider approach may have the potential for big
payoffs to U.S. financial institutions, but there is also
greater risk of the U.S.-Japanese negotiations getting bogged
down in special-interest politics in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The U.S. negotiating team will be headed by David Mulford,
the Treasury's undersecretary for international affairs,
while Japan's delegation will be headed by Makoto Utsumi, the
Finance Ministry's vice minister for international affairs.
The talks are scheduled for Monday and Tuesday; informal
discussions have been going on for some time.</p>
<p>Washington's latest demands are viewed as threats by
Japan's smaller banks, its intimate network of money dealers
and its investment management industry. These institutions
have many allies in parliament, the Bank of Japan and the
Finance Ministry.</p>
<p>"Japanese small- and medium-sized financial institutions
are strongly opposed to quick deregulation of interest
rates," says a bank regulator at the Finance Ministry, noting
that many feel they'll be unable to compete.</p>
<p>He says the smaller Japanese banks "are very much afraid
that they will follow the path of U.S. savings and loan
institutions," many of which have collapsed in recent months.</p>
<p>Then there is the question of how Japan's government-run
postal savings system would set rates if they were
aggressively deregulated, officials say.</p>
<p>If the system chose to compete with the big banks by
jacking up rates, the move would hurt smaller financial
institutions, especially those outside the cities. If the
system set its rates lower, as the less competitive markets
outside the big cities allow, then it would lose market share
in urban centers to big banks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the prospect of higher yields in the postal
savings system isn't comforting to the government. If the
postal savings system has to pay higher yields, it
conceivably would have to collect more from its investments,
including the money it lends to the government.</p>
<p>The potential cost to Japan's government of higher yields
in the postal savings system is just one example of the risk
of deregulating interest rates. Rising yields throughout the
financial system would threaten to push up the government's
cost of borrowing.</p>
<p>Even though there is talk of a three-year timetable to
allow Japanese institutions to adapt to broad deregulation of
interest rates, that may not be long enough given the number
of Japanese institutions affected and the wariness of
regulators.</p>
<p>In addition, the alarm of Japanese regulators about the
impact of futures and program trading on the stock market
makes them leery of aggressively pursuing another foreign
initiative. Stock-index futures were lobbied for by U.S. and
other foreign firms and governments, and foreign companies so
far have dominated use of the instrument.</p>
