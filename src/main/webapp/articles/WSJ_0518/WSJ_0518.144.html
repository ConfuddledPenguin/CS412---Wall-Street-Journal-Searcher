	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks continued to crawl higher as
traders gave mixed reviews of the degree of enthusiasm among
small investors.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 2.81 to 445.74, a 0.63%
gain. Advancing shares broadened their lead over declining
stocks, 1,111 to 836, as volume accelerated to 171.4 million
shares from 152.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Small investors' orders for OTC stocks picked up at
PaineWebber, according to Richard Bruno, head of OTC trading
there. "I think people on the sidelines have come in," said
Mr. Bruno, who estimated that the brokerage firm's orders
from "retail" customers are up 25% to 30% this month.</p>
<p>However, Jack Bayer, head of OTC trading at Oppenheimer,
said the market for smaller OTC stocks "remains stagnant."
Similarly, Lawrence Rice, national manager of OTC trading at
Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles, said, "It seems
like a lot of people are still sitting on their wallets." Mr.
Rice's firm handles trading between securities industry
professionals.</p>
<p>Larger issues attracted most of the attention yesterday at
Robinson Humphrey's New York office, according to Jim
O'Neill, co-manager of OTC trading. Among the more active
issues was Sensormatic Electronics, which gained 1 to close
at a new 52-week high of 14 1/8 on 1.4 million shares. Mr.
O'Neill said he wasn't aware of any particular news or
comments fueling interest in the Deerfield Beach, Fla., maker
of electronics equipment.</p>
<p>Quantum also was among the day's most-active shares,
advancing 1 1/8 to 19 on 2.1 million shares. The Milpitas,
Calif., maker of disk drives said it reached a new supply
agreement with Leading Edge Products of Westborough, Mass.,
valued at $20 to $25 million over the next year.</p>
<p>However, other technology stocks weren't as strong,
including Intel, up 1/8 at 44 7/8, and Apple Computer,</p>
<p>MCI Communications, the day's most active stock, rose 7/8
to 41 3/4 on 2.7 million shares, and helped fuel a 0.86% gain
in the Nasdaq utility index.</p>
<p>DST Systems jumped 1 7/8 to 14 5/8 after Kansas City
Southern Industries said it plans to begin a $14-a-share
tender offer for the 12.9% of the Kansas City, Mo., software
concern that it doesn't already own.</p>
<p>L.M. Ericsson rallied 6 1/8 to 182 7/8 after Japan's
Nippon Telegraph & Telephone announced that it chose the
Swedish telecommunications company, along with Motorola, AT&T
and seven Japanese companies, to jointly develop NTT's
digital mobile telephone system.</p>
<p>Reuters's American Depositary Receipts joined a broad
rally in other, exchange-listed British issues, gaining 1 7/8
to 59 7/8.</p>
<p>Nature's Bounty rose 1 1/4 to 7 after the Bohemia, N.Y.,
maker of vitamins, nutritional supplements and personal-care
items reported late Wednesday that operating profit for the
second quarter ended March 31 was 33 cents a share, up from
19 cents a share a year earlier.</p>
<p>Samna reached a new 52-week high, rising 1 5/8 to 9 1/2.
John Throckmorton, chief financial officer of the Atlanta
software maker, told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report
that on May 15 the company licensed its Ami executive word
processing product to Software Publishing. On Wednesday, he
added, the firm began shipping another product, the Ami
Professional 1.2, which is compatible with Microsoft's new
Windows 3.0 operating system. The product is expected to be
unveiled Tuesday. Samna's stock has nearly doubled since the
beginning of the month, as investors awaited both the launch
of both its own and Microsoft's products.</p>
<p>Software Toolworks gained 1 7/8 to 17 7/8. The Chatsworth,
Calif., developer and distributor of software said Wednesday
that it plans to file next month for a July offering of as
many as four million shares, with about half to be sold by
the company and half by certain shareholders. The company's
proceeds will be used for working capital and general
corporate purposes.</p>
<p>One Swedish issue didn't fare so well. AB Electrolux lost
1/2 to 39 3/8 after the home appliance group said that its
pretax profit in the first three months of 1990 fell 41.3%,
more steeply than market expectations.</p>
<p>Secor Bank lost 5/8 to 3 7/8 after the Birmingham, Ala.,
bank suspended its 10-cents a share quarterly dividend on
common stock and its dividends on series A and B preferred
shares. The bank said that its dividends paid have exceeded
net income before dividends for each of the last three
quarters.</p>
<p>Optical Coating Laboratory fell 3/4 to 4 1/8 after the
Santa Rosa, Calif., maker of optical thin film coatings
reported net income for the second quarter ended April 30 of
six cents a share, down from 17 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Corrections tumbled for the second consecutive day after
articles in two Texas newspapers said there's a chance state
prison officials might cancel operating contracts for two
prison facilities built by the Nashville, Tenn., company,
according to DJPIR. A company spokeswoman called the
speculation premature. Corrections, which fell 1/2 Wednesday,
dropped 7/8 yesterday to 9.</p>
<p>Asiamerica Equities lost 2 to 5 1/4. The Vancouver,
British Columbia, investment and real estate trust attributed
recent volatility in its shares to "investor margin
pressures," but didn't specify which investors might be
having trouble meeting their margin calls. Asiamerica said
there haven't been any recent material changes at the
company.</p>
