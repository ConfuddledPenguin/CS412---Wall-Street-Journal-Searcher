	<p class="article-leader">New York -- As clothes horses go, we would have to put
ourself a furlong or two behind the nattier newsroom nags we
know, but not nearly as close to the glue factory as some of
them suggest that we routinely venture, dudswise.
   It's true that we've gone through life by and large
questionably "accessorized," as they say in the rag trade:
Our ties were narrow in wide-tie times and vice versa; we
broached braces but never really embraced them; we wear
loafers too much.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So, naturally, we were more than a little nervous the
other morning as we stared into our closet and tried to
figure out what to wear to a midday rendezvous with the man
who dressed Gordon Gekko.</p>
<p>It was no time for a Full Cleveland.</p>
<p>Mr. Gekko, you recall, was the corporate raider played by
Michael Douglas in the 1987 movie "Wall Street" who somehow
came across as a slimeball greedhead instead of the
public-spirited American hero free-marketers knew him to be.</p>
<p>OK, so he said stuff like, "I bought my way in and now all
these schmucks are sucking my kneecaps." And, after a
big-profit real estate deal, "It was better than sex." And,
of course, the classic, "Greed is good."</p>
<p>But he didn't really have to say those things. He didn't
have to open his mouth to talk. His clothes talked. They said
something we can't say here, but it consists of two words
that imply a somewhat hostile negative response. People
called it the {Expletives Deleted} look.</p>
<p>The man who made those clothes talk is a 44-year-old
menswear designer named Alan Flusser. We had an appointment
with him -- for our '90s fashion update -- at his new Wall
Street (actually 50 Trinity Place) shop, above a McAnn's bar
and a My Daddy's Pizza parlor across the street from the rear
of Trinity Church.</p>
<p>Downstairs, a Sicilian slice costs $1.50, and the
atmosphere is canned mushrooms and pepperoni. One flight up
is another world -- a world in which a custom-tailored
Flusser suit starts at $1,195. You'll want to finish off your
Sicilian slice before climbing those stairs because Mr.
Flusser's store looks more like a 1930s men's club, with old
chairs and tables, than a store. It has a cognac-and-cigars
sort of feel to it, a hide-out for men who hate to shop.</p>
<p>While Mr. Flusser is a very nice man, he did make us
fidget a bit when he characterized suits sold in Barney's,
Brooks Brothers and Dunhill as "serviceable body cover" and
dismissed Hong Kong suits as lacking in grace, thereby
consigning our entire wardrobe to Nerdland. (We really don't
have a Full Cleveland, which, for you bicoastals, consists
more or less, of white belt, fake white Gucci loafers,
burgundy stretch doubleknit polyester trousers and a white
and burgundy houndstooth doubleknit sport coat.)</p>
<p>Mr. Flusser's meat-and-potatoes suit made its debut in
1982 as a chesty British-looking, soft draped single or
double-breasted 1930s style garment first worn by the then
Duke of Windsor. It had side vents, pleated trousers, an
egg-shaped arm-hole. He sold 3,000 of them -- with subtle
refinements -- last year.</p>
<p>Today's version of that suit is even more conservative,
and it's hot, mainly because FASHION GARMENTOS are trying at
this very moment to ram slouchy double-breasted Italian
stallion suits down our throats and the Flusser version is --
as we fashion lingoists say -- an elegant safe haven.</p>
<p>"What we really sell today is very understated stuff," he
says. "People come for elegance, but they don't want to
scream it."</p>
<p>Mr. Flusser didn't design Gordon Gekko's clothes for
safety. He went for sartorial arrogance and overkill: wide,
bead-striped single-breasted suits with peak-lapels and
turned back rollback cuffs; the shirts with bold, heavy and
wide stripes and extra-long and spread white collars; French
cuffs; foppish braces; and ties. Outfits that said, to clean
up the language a bit: "I've got it made. I don't have to
dress to please anybody but ME."</p>
<p>After the movie came out, Mr. Flusser's phone started
ringing. In the next year or so, his business doubled. A lot
of men out there wanted the ED look -- men OUT THERE, in
small towns in places like Kansas and Idaho, who wanted that
look NOW and were ready to jump on a plane to New York for
fittings. Some did, and we could imagine them out there --
little Gekko echoes -- running around the country saying,
"Greed is good."</p>
<p>Then things changed.</p>
<p>Mr. Flusser's business is still booming, with a new shop
just opened in Washington, D.C., a Bergdorf Goodman space in
New York and Neiman-Marcus space in San Francisco coming
soon. But it turns out that your average high-powered Wall
Street tycoon of the '90s doesn't want his clothes to say
what Gordon Gekko's said.</p>
<p>We thought this might be because the '90s is supposed to
be the DECENCY DECADE. Then somebody explained to us that in
this new post-Drexel, post-junk-bond, post-Milken world,
there's a lot of hiding going on out there, but not
necessarily less stealing.</p>
<p>Say you're running a company, and Securities and Exchange
Commission sleuths are strip-searching your data bases and
the feds are readying indictments and you just gave yourself
a $4.2 million bonus and the board of directors wants to know
why. Do you want your clothes at that meeting to say what
Gordon Gekko's said?</p>
<p>Just to get a second opinion, we called up another
sartorial swami for advice on today's outfit. Said he:</p>
<p>"It should say strong, serious, tasteful, demure. It
should speak of being together, not sloppy. It should be
about caring and carefulness. Not fastidiousness. Not drab.
But not indistinct. Not fey or flighty, and not as if you're
reaching out to be fashionable.</p>
<p>"Sincere colors, nothing that looks slick. No retro or
art-deco ties. Shoes dark and polished. No heavy gold cuff
links and chunky watches. No rings with gemstones. No pinkie
rings. No bracelets. No sunglasses indoors. No suntan."</p>
<p>Not all of today's CEOs will want to follow that advice,
but it is what Stanley S. Arkin, a New York criminal lawyer
who has defended a lot of Wall Street guys accused of abusing
the free-market system, wants his clients' outfits to say
when they are presented to a jury.</p>
