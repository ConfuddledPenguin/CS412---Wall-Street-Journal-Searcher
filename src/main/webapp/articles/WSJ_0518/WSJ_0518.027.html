	<p class="article-leader">SINGAPORE -- The Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(Asean) wants more trade and investment from Australia,
Acting Foreign Minister Peter Sung said yesterday.
   Trade between Australia and Asean has risen to 6.7 billion
Australian dollars (US$5.1 billion) in 1988-89 against A$2.9
billion in 1980-81.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, Australia's trade with the U.S., Japan, Europe,
South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong has grown much more than
with Asean, he said but did not give figures.</p>
<p>Mr. Sung said, "Asean's exports to Australia have
continuously faced stringent import regulations such as
import licensing; labeling, packing, health, and safety
standards; quarantine restrictions; and antidumping and
countervailing action."</p>
<p>Singapore, Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines,
and Thailand are members of Asean.</p>
