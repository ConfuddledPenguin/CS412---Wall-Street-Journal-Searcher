	<p class="article-leader">SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Foreign-owned automobile plants,
leading players in Brazil's industrial development, are under
fire from a government that wants to open up the market.
   Brazil recently announced plans to allow the installation
of new automobile plants. The country's big four --
Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co., General Motors Corp. and Fiat
S.p.A. -- suddenly have found themselves at a crossroads,
independent automobile industry analysts say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Complicating the situation is a drastic anti-inflation
program that has dried up consumers' money and forced
existing auto makers to slash production and send workers
home.</p>
<p>Brazil's automobile industry, the world's 11th largest,
"will have to choose between producing better and cheaper
vehicles that can compete internationally or be squeezed out
of the market, most likely by Japanese automobile makers,"
said Amedeo Scabbia, of the Sao Paulo office of Technomic
Consultants International, a consulting firm based in
Evanston, Ill.</p>
<p>The four automobile companies "have a kind of gentlemen's
agreement to not rock the boat," Mr. Scabbia said. "Since
there is no real competition among them, they don't have to
bother with developing more modern or fuel-efficient cars."</p>
<p>Before taking office in March, President Fernando Collor
de Mello described Brazilian-made cars as "horse carts"
compared with those in other countries. On May 1, he ordered
a study on the feasibility of having other automobile
manufacturers operate in Latin America's largest country.</p>
<p>"We have already been informally advised of the interest
of some industries, namely Japanese, to set up operations in
Brazil," said Marcos Caramuru, press spokesman for the
Economy Ministry.</p>
<p>Mr. Caramaru said the entry of new automobile
manufacturers would break the cartel-like grip Volkswagen,
Ford, GM and Fiat have on the market.</p>
<p>But industry leaders, such as Jacy Mendonca, president of
the National Automakers Association, say an invasion of
foreign auto makers is unlikely in the short run.</p>
<p>"When we sold more than one million vehicles in 1979 no
one showed any interest in coming to Brazil," said Mr.
Mendonca, the local auto makers' main spokesman. "Why would
outsiders want to come now, when we expect to sell less than
700,000 units?"</p>
<p>Mr. Mendonca said Japanese auto makers he consulted
"showed no interest in investing in Brazil. They are more
interested in the U.S., Asia, Mexico and Western and Eastern
Europe."</p>
<p>Tadatsugu Tanaka, administrative director of the local
subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp., said that "although we hope
to one day produce passenger cars in Brazil, that day won't
come for quite a while."</p>
<p>Since starting operations in Brazil in 1958, Toyota has
produced only jeeps and light-duty trucks here.</p>
<p>Mr. Tanaka said Brazil's local market was too small to
warrant massive investments needed to set up automobile
plants similar to others around the world.</p>
<p>"For the moment, the investment priorities of Toyota,
Japan are in Europe, the U.S. and Asia," Mr. Tanaka said.</p>
<p>To produce cheaper and more competitive cars the
government needs to lift a ban on imports of high-tech
components, and lower taxes, which currently represent more
than 40% of the final cost of a vehicle, Mr. Mendonca said.</p>
<p>Brazil exports approximately 30% of its production, but to
enter First World markets, the Brazilian vehicle must include
several high-tech components that can only be imported if the
automobile is made for export.</p>
