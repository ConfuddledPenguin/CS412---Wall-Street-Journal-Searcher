	<p class="article-leader">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysia's coal reserves of
about 770 million tons, mostly located in Sarawak in Borneo
island, should be tapped to meet energy demands, an official
at the Ministry of Energy said.
   The Secretary-General of the Ministry of Energy,
Telecommunications and Posts, Helmi Mohamad Noor, said that
until now, Malaysia was not a significant consumer of coal,
and effort should be made to tap and use this resource.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He said, "The cement industry began converting to coal in
the early 1980s, and by 1987, imported coal and coke
contributed 3.3 % to the final energy mix. However, it was
reduced to 1.8% in 1988 due to cement plants reverting to
cheaper fuel oil."</p>
<p>Mr. Noor said the development of domestic coal brought
benefits in the form of support for regional development and
the creation of employment.</p>
