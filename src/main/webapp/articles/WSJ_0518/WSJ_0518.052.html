	<p class="article-leader">BRISTOL, Conn. -- Thomas S. Murphy, presiding over his
last annual shareholders meeting as chairman and chief
executive officer of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., handed over the
chief executive duties to his longtime No. 2, Daniel B.
Burke, as expected.
   Capital Cities/ABC's board, meeting privately after an
uneventful annual meeting at the company's ESPN sports
channel, approved Mr. Murphy's recommendation to give the
chief executive title to Mr. Burke, who remains president and
chief operating officer. The duo has run the company together
for 18 years, and Mr. Murphy will remain chairman and will
stay active in the affairs of the ABC Television Network, in
particular.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Burke told shareholders that ABC this year is expected
to log the highest sales and profits of any year since the
merger four years ago of the former Capital Cities
Communications Inc. and the old American Broadcasting Cos.
ABC earned about $165 million in pretax profit for 1989.</p>
<p>But ABC, which earlier this year agreed to pay $900
million for four more seasons of "NFL Monday Night Football,"
may run a loss on the football contract. "We aren't certain
we can recover all the costs. It is just too early to say
what the financial ramifications will be," Mr. Burke said.</p>
