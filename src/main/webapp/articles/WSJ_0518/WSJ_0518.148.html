	<p class="article-leader">Nikon Corp., the big Tokyo-based manufacturer of cameras
and other optical instruments, said unconsolidated pretax
earnings in fiscal 1989, ended March 31, grew 8.7% to 20.28
billion yen from 18.66 billion yen in fiscal 1988.
   Net profit jumped 59% to 10.87 billion yen, or 29.63 yen a
share, from 6.86 billion yen, or 18.86 yen a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales rose 10% to 241.12 billion yen from 218.95 billion
yen.</p>
<p>Nikon officials said healthy personal consumption helped
push up sales of cameras, binoculars and certain other
products.</p>
<p>Net surged as the company posted 1.18 billion yen in
extraordinary gains from the sales of corporate assets,
compared with 992 million yen in such profits in the previous
fiscal year. Extraordinary losses, including those from sales
of assets and foreign-exchange losses involving long-term
foreign currency loans, shrank to 497 million yen from 1
billion yen and also helped improve the financial balance.</p>
