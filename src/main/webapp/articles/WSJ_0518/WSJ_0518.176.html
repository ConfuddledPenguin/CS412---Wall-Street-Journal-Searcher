	<p class="article-leader">GORBACHEV MET with Lithuania's premier to discuss
Vilnius's secession bid.
   In what was considered a major breakthrough in a
two-month-old confrontation over the Baltic republic's
proclamation of independence, the Soviet leader held two
hours of talks in the Kremlin with Lithuania's Prime Minister
Prunskiene, who traveled to Moscow with an offer of new
concessions. The official Tass news agency reported that
Gorbachev reaffirmed that the republic must rescind its
declaration, saying Lithuania's proposal to suspend its
secession drive and remain part of the Soviet security system
didn't address the issue.</p>
