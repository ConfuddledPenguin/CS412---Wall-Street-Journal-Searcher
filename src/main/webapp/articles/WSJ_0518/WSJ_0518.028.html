	<p class="article-leader">KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.
said it plans to make a $14-a-share, or $34.5 million, tender
offer for the 12.9% of DST Systems Inc. that it doesn't
already own.
   The railroad and financial services data-processing
concern said the offer for the Kansas City financial services
company is subject to certain conditions, but won't include a
requirement for tender of any minimum number of shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kansas City Southern said certain of its officers and
directors holding 1.3% of DST shares plan to tender their
shares in connection with the offer.</p>
<p>Kansas City Southern said that since DST went public in
1983, the public market for DST shares hasn't met
"expectations for providing liquidity or in causing a
transfer value to be reflected in the market for Kansas City
Southern stock."</p>
<p>The company, which owns 16.6 million shares, or 87.1% of
DST, said that upon completion of the offer, it will acquire
all remaining shares, also at $14 each.</p>
<p>DST said its board will make its recommendation regarding
the proposed tender offer following receipt of the opinion of
a special board committee's investment adviser.</p>
