	<p class="article-leader">Southmark Corp. said in Dallas that it expects to report a
net loss of $59 million for the third quarter, ended March
31, compared with a net loss of $1.04 billion after massive
asset write-downs in the year-earlier period.
   The real estate and thrift concern, which is operating
under bankruptcy-law proceedings, said it has notified the
Securities and Exchange Commission that it will file its Form
10-Q late. The company said the competing demands of the
bankruptcy proceedings have kept it from getting its
financial report prepared on time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the third quarter last year, Southmark reported a loss
from continuing operations of $936.4 million, including more
than $800 million in asset write-downs. Its loss from
discontinued operations was $104.3 million.</p>
