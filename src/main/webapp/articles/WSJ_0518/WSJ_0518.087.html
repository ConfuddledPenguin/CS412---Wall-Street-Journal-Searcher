	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Columbia Savings & Loan
Association said that $243.3 million in retail deposits have
been withdrawn since it reported a huge 1989 loss last month
and that it is omitting a semiannual payment due this week on
$38.8 million in subordinated debt.
   In addition, the S&L said that the Office of Thrift
Supervision has joined the list of regulatory bodies
investigating its junk-bond ties to Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. and that the probe includes a look at "certain expenses
and activities of former association officers." All the
disclosures were made in the company's first-quarter report
to the OTS.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The April deposit outflow, combined with total
first-quarter withdrawals of $200 million, means the thrift
has lost about 16% of its $2.8 billion retail-deposit base at
year end.</p>
<p>Columbia experienced an additional $733.4 million in
withdrawals through April because of maturing brokered
deposits and faces a further $1.2 billion in withdrawals of
such deposits in the rest of the year. Retail deposits are
considered a more crucial indicator of investor confidence,
however, and are also a generally cheaper and more stable
source of funds.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Columbia officials said the thrift is highly
liquid and does not foresee a cash squeeze.</p>
<p>"Columbia and its subsidiaries have liquidity which is
nearly two times the legal requirement," said a spokesman.
"We continue to be encouraged by the confidence shown by our
depositors at this time. We believe we have sufficient
liquidity to meet all foreseeable liquidity requirements."</p>
<p>Columbia had about $1.1 billion in cash or cash
equivalents at March 31 to cushion further withdrawals. The
company is also raising cash by selling assets. It is also
believed to be examining other strategies for raising funds
in light of a number of new restrictions placed on the
institution because of its financial troubles. Under federal
law, Columbia, insolvent since Feb. 28, is prohibited from
taking or rolling over brokered deposits, which have
historically accounted for about 60% of its deposits. In
addition, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco
recently put restrictions on its ability to obtain further
advances from it.</p>
<p>The payment omission on its 11.5% subordinated debt could
be more ominous for the company's common shareholders than
the debt holders themselves, some of which have already
marked down the debt about 90% of face value.</p>
<p>Some analysts believe Columbia will likely attempt to swap
the debt for equity in an attempt to help boost capital
levels. In the OTS filing, for instance, the thrift confirmed
previous reports that it plans to offer to swap some $72.9
million in other subordinated debt outstanding for new
preferred stock, a plan that could further gut the interests
of common shareholders. The spokesman declined to comment on
any plans for the 11.5% debt.</p>
<p>The company also declined to comment on the OTS
investigation, which according to the filing, was initiated
late last year but only recently came to Columbia's
attention. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Manhattan U.S. attorney's office have been inquiring into the
possible existence of an illegal "stock-parking" arrangement
between Drexel and Columbia. Parking is essentially a sham
sale of a security that is designed to hide the true owner
for tax or disclosure purposes. Columbia was one of Drexel's
biggest junk-bond clients.</p>
<p>The company also declined to comment on the OTS expense
probe. According to proxy materials for the company's June 5
annual meeting, Columbia paid its top executives $4 million
in bonuses last year, the huge operating loss
notwithstanding. Former Chief Executive Thomas Spiegel's pay
as a consultant to the company has been reduced to $1 a year
-- from a $500,000 annual rate -- because of regulators'
objections.</p>
<p>For 1989, Columbia reported a net loss of $591.1 million,
or $30.11 a share. It reported a net loss for the first
quarter of $293.3 million, or $14.62 a share. The company
hopes to stem the flow of red ink by selling its $2.9 billion
junk-bond portfolio, which has eroded in value by about $1
billion since last year, triggering all the losses.</p>
