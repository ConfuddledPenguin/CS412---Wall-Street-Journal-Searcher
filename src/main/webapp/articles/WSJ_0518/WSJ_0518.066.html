	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Britain's seasonally adjusted jobless total rose
in April, the first monthly increase in nearly four years and
further evidence that the government's policy of high
interest rates is damping the country's economic growth.
   However, other data show that the slowdown isn't yet
having any impact on high wage pressures. Along with other
recent figures showing relatively firm retail sales and rises
in factory gate prices, the latest batch of reports tended to
confirm that inflation pressures remain strong. "These
inflation problems are going to be with us through this
year," said David Owen, an economist at Kleinwort Benson &
Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The unemployment data showed a 1,200 increase in the
number of unemployed to approximately 1.6 million, the first
rise recorded since the jobless total started to fall from a
high of more than 3.1 million in July 1986.</p>
<p>Mr. Owen said most of the losses came in the manufacturing
sector, which is being hardest hit by the slowdown. Elsewhere
in the service sector, he noted, the labor market remains
"quite tight."</p>
<p>Michael Howard, the Secretary of State for Employment,
pointed out that the rise wasn't unexpected given the lower
economic growth forecast this year. Nevertheless, Mr. Howard
added, "the interruption in the downward trend in
unemployment need only be short term, but much depends on the
behavior of wage negotiators."</p>
<p>So far, though, there is little sign that wages are
anywhere near starting to fall in line with the leaner
economic outlook, economists said.</p>
<p>The underlying annual rate of average earnings for March
held firm at 9 1/2% in March as it had in February. The
underlying rate remained high although several large wage
boosts announced in March have yet to be included in the
figures.</p>
<p>Several economists, including Mr. Owen, say the strong
trend for high wage settlements, both in the service and
manufacturing sectors, will probably push the underlying rate
up to 10% in the next few months and keep it up there for
some time to come.</p>
<p>"We will need to see a larger shakeout in the job market"
before wages settlements start falling, he said, forecasting
that unemployment could rise to as much as 1,750,000 by the
end of this year and head for two million next year.</p>
