	<p class="article-leader">Nobel Industrier Sverige AB agreed to buy the chemicals
division of Stora Kopparbergs Bergslags AB, buttressing its
position as a global leader in chemicals used by the pulp and
paper industry.
   The acquisition is the fourth proposed by Nobel this
month. If successful, the transactions valued at 5.95 billion
Swedish kronor ($989.5 million) would boost the acquisitive
Swedish concern's annual sales by more than 25%. Nobel said
it would pay 1.93 billion kronor for Stora's chemicals unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shedding that chemicals business opens an asset-disposal
program by Stora, prompted by last month's takeover of West
Germany's Feldmuehle Nobel AG. Industry analysts also expect
Stora to put its foundering Akerlund & Rausing packaging unit
on the block-in addition to recouping as much as half of the
sum it paid for Feldmuehle Nobel by disposing of the West
German concern's non-forestry divisions.</p>
<p>Nobel's Eka Nobel division and Stora's chemicals unit are
both among Europe's leading producers of forestry chemicals.</p>
