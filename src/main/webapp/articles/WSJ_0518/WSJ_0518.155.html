   The Dallas company also said it plans to skip its August
dividend payment, but expects to resume regular quarterly
dividends in November. The company, which pays a dividend
based on its earnings, already has declared a 21
cents-a-share quarterly dividend to be paid May 25 to stock
of record last Monday.</p>
