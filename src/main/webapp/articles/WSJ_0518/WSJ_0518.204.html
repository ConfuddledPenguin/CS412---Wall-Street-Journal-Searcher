	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said it
will cut long-distance, evening-hour charges 2.5% -- or $100
million a year -- starting July 1.
   In a filing with the Federal Communications Commission,
the company said the reduction relates to prices of
direct-dialed interstate calls between 5 p.m. and 11 p.m.,
Sunday through Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under FCC price-cap regulations, AT&T files price
adjustments annually. This reduction was made possible in
part by anticipated savings from further cuts in the access
fees charged by local telephone companies. Another factor is
a change AT&T is making in directory assistance: AT&T said it
will eliminate the free call to interstate directory
assistance now offered each month, saying only one in four
residential customers use directory assistance during a
three-month period. The price of a directory assistance call
is 60 cents.</p>
<p>When the July 1 decrease takes effect, a 10-minute
direct-dialed call anywhere in the continental U.S. will cost
$1.53 or less, compared with the current $1.58 or less. The
decrease is AT&T's 11th since 1984, when the Bell system was
broken up.</p>
<p>A spokesman for US Sprint Communications Co., a subsidiary
of United Telecommunications Inc. of Kansas City, Mo., said:
"We haven't seen the filing yet and can't comment
specifically. But we are competitive and will take whatever
steps are necessary to remain competitive."</p>
<p>An MCI Communications Corp. spokeswoman said the company
is studying AT&T's moves, "and, as is our tradition, MCI will
remain competitive."</p>
<p>AT&T added that it expects in the future to be able to cut
prices an additional $60 million in other long-distance and
operator services.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AT&T closed at $42.875 a share, up 87.5 cents.</p>
