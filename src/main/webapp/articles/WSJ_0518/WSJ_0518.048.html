	<p class="article-leader">It has become fashionable to complain that less than half
of Americans now vote in national elections. We share that
concern, but we can't subscribe to the spreading theory that
national apathy is primarily the fault of the voters. Rather
it's a natural reaction to a political system that has
increasingly isolated itself from the electorate.
   The latest example of the "blame-the-voters-first"
syndrome is a report recently issued by the Markle Commission
on the Media and the Electorate. It claims that American
democracy is threatened by voters who are so indifferent and
apathetic that we face a "citizen abdication of the electoral
process."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The commission members have their own ideas on how to fix
the system, such as establishing an American Citizens
Foundation (to "monitor American political conduct") and
having Congress "direct the FCC to call upon the networks" to
educate the electorate on the democratic process. Candidates
should also "pledge to conduct clean campaigns." (The
commission members conclude that the Bush campaign
advertising set a tone voters found "distasteful.")</p>
<p>But the commission's report is more interesting for its
tone than for its analysis or recommendations. "American
voters today do not seem to understand their rightful place
in the operation of American democracy," the commission says.
"When the nation was founded, the looming question was
whether a ruling class would be perpetually in control of the
new government, not whether the people would some day abandon
it."</p>
<p>Well, an increasing number of Americans believe a separate
class has indeed developed in this country. A political
complex has grown up around Washington for the purpose of
transferring money from the taxpayers to targeted interest
groups. As a Wall Street Journal reader wrote us recently in
defense of this new system, "We are now a nation of pressure
groups." She may be right.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, says, "People don't
feel any sense of ownership over the federal government. It
isn't them and it isn't theirs."</p>
<p>A new book, "Politics By Other Means" by Cornell
University political scientists Benjamin Ginsberg and Martin
Shefter, says there is a reason why voters no longer feel
connected to the political process. They argue that the U.S.
is entering a "post-electoral" political order as electoral
competition declines. Rather than engage the voters directly,
competing interests have taken political combat inside the
Beltway, using weapons such as congressional investigations,
media revelations and judicial proceedings. The authors term
the most popular tactic RIP: revelation, investigation and
prosecution.</p>
<p>These new arenas of political conflict have little room
for the average voter. The American people have responded to
being sidelined from the real political struggles in
predictable fashion: They stay home on election day.</p>
<p>At the same time that fewer voters are bothering to
involve themselves in national politics, one party has
controlled the House of Representatives for 36 straight
years, a dominance rivaled only by Mexico, South Africa and
the Soviet Union. The average House incumbent won 73.5% of
the vote in 1988, and one in five was not opposed by a
major-party candidate.</p>
<p>However, none of this is to say that people are no longer
interested in their community or country. Citizen activity
and interest may have declined in national politics, but it
is vibrant and growing at the local level, where
volunteerism, charitable giving and neighborhood associations
are thriving. The American people are fulfilling their civic
duty in areas where they believe they can have an impact.
Washington, on the other hand, might as well be Mars.</p>
<p>But there are also hopeful signs that voters may start to
insist that political power once again be decided by
elections and not by special prosecutors, federal lawsuits or
abstruse regulatory proceedings. A bumper crop of initiatives
will appear on state ballots this year on everything from
cutting taxes to allowing voter confirmation of judges. The
developing campaign to limit terms of Members of Congress is
supported in polls by two-to-one, with backing from liberals
and conservatives, blacks and whites, the rich and poor.</p>
<p>The American people aren't naturally apathetic and
indifferent to civic concerns. They no doubt would very much
like to have more control of their government. The more
relevant question is whether the Beltway ruling class will
let them.</p>
