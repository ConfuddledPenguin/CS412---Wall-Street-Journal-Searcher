	<p class="article-leader">Faced with conflicting economic signals, the Federal
Reserve apparently decided to leave credit policy unchanged
at its meeting on Tuesday.
   Edward G. Boehne, president of the Philadelphia Federal
Reserve Bank, said yesterday that the Fed hasn't changed
monetary policy since right before Christmas. Other Fed
officials wouldn't comment directly, but didn't challenge Mr.
Boehne's comments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A few weeks ago, signs of rapid inflation were leading
some Fed officials to talk as if they might be ready to
tighten policy, and nudge up interest rates. But government
statistics released over the past week suggested the economy
was weaker and inflation less threatening than previously
thought.</p>
<p>As a result, Fed officials now seem to think their best
policy may be to stay put. "The risk to the economy is fairly
even between a further slowdown and inflation," Mr. Boehne
told the Philadelphia Association of Retired Bankers.</p>
<p>Mr. Boehne is currently a voting member of the Fed's key
policy committee, which is made up of five district reserve
bank presidents plus the members of the Fed's board of
governors.</p>
<p>Some market analysts have in recent days begun to
speculate that the Fed may soon ease credit to help boost the
economy. But for his part, Mr. Boehne seems pleased with
current slow-growth rates. He said the economy has achieved
the hoped-for soft landing, and is now growing "at a moderate
pace that is sustainable."</p>
<p>"I am reasonably optimistic about the whole economy as we
go forward," he said.</p>
<p>The Fed eased monetary policy several times late last
year, with the most recent move occurring shortly before
Christmas. At the time, Mr. Boehne said, there was
considerable concern about recession. But despite the recent
weak economic numbers, he said, fears of recession have
receded.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Fed was under heavy pressure from
the Treasury to bring down interest rates. Treasury officials
thought high U.S. rates were partly responsible for
attracting foreign investors and thus driving up the value of
the dollar relative to the Japanese yen. In the last few
weeks, however, the dollar's value has fallen significantly
against the yen, easing the Treasury's concerns.</p>
<p>Mr. Boehne said that when the Fed does decide to move
again, it will continue to be in the small steps that have
characterized the central bank's action under the
chairmanship of Alan Greenspan. "Federal Reserve policy is
one of prudence," he said, "steady as she goes."</p>
