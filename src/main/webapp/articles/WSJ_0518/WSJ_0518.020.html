	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Despite recent worsening investment conditions,
including higher interest rates and falling stock prices,
many Japanese companies plan to spend more money in fiscal
1990 in upgrading production and other equipment, a
government advisory panel said.
   In a report submitted to Minister of International Trade
and Industry Kabun Muto, a subcommittee of the Industrial
Structure Council said its survey of 1,466 companies
conducted between February and March showed equipment
investment will climb 13.1% in fiscal 1990 that began in
April from the previous fiscal year to 17.715 trillion yen
($116.8 billion).</p>
