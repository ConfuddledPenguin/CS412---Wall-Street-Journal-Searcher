	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Like a labyrinthine lawsuit out of Charles
Dickens's "Bleak House," the case of Inslaw Inc. v. U.S.
Department of Justice threatens to drag on forever, growing
more opaque with age.
   The story began happily enough in 1982, when William
Hamilton, a computer software inventor who owns and runs
Inslaw with his wife, Nancy, landed a $10 million contract to
provide the Justice Department with a computer program to
track court cases. The dispute over precisely what happened
next has spawned a cottage industry for Washington lawyers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In seven years of claims and counterclaims, two federal
courts have affirmed the Hamiltons' basic assertion: The
Justice Department under Attorney General Edwin Meese stole
Inslaw's "Promis" case-management software, which almost half
of the regional U.S. attorneys' offices continue to use. The
Hamiltons' tiny Washington, D.C., company was awarded more
than $6 million in compensatory damages, but the government
hasn't paid a penny while it has appealed the case for a
second time.</p>
<p>After years of no-holds-barred legal defense, the Justice
Department has lately shown interest in quietly resolving the
case. It now proposes turning the dispute over to a
court-appointed mediator.</p>
<p>But the Hamiltons refuse to settle. They want a public
airing of their allegations that a conspiracy reaching all
the way to then-Attorney General Meese's office aimed to
drive Inslaw out of business and make off with its software.
The department, Mr. Meese and other current and former
officials have denied the charges.</p>
<p>The Hamiltons' best hope for a complete hearing may come
from the House Judiciary Committee, which has been
investigating the Justice Department's computer-procurement
practices. In addition to the Inslaw dispute, the committee's
staff is examining alleged irregularities in the Justice
Department's biggest high-tech overhaul ever. Project Eagle,
as it's known, is expected to cost at least $212 million over
eight years, and possibly much more.</p>
<p>In Judiciary Chairman Jack Brooks, the Hamiltons have a
potential champion. The crusty Texas Democrat likes nothing
better than a good scrap with a big bureaucracy --
particularly during a Republican administration. The Inslaw
mess, he contends, has already set back computer
modernization at the Justice Department by "as much as 10
years."</p>
<p>Widely considered a technological backwater, even by
government standards, the Justice Department badly needs
outside supervision of its computer operations, contends
Terry Miller, a Falls Church, Va., high-tech consultant.
"Justice ranks among the worst" federal agencies in this
regard, he asserts.</p>
<p>Though they claim things are improving, department
officials admit that most of the agency's numerous bureaus
and subdivisions use incompatible equipment, resulting in
lost time, money and occasionally even lawsuits. Until
recently, some prosecutors "were getting whipped in court" by
private lawyers armed with more sophisticated research and
word-processing support, says Stephen Colgate, a senior
department administrator.</p>
<p>The department hired Inslaw in 1982 to begin to address
the problem with its Promis computer software, which remains
the leading commercially available legal case-management
program. Almost immediately, the contract became tangled in
technical disputes, prompting Justice to cease certain
payments and ultimately driving Inslaw into bankruptcy court.</p>
<p>The Judiciary Committee is investigating whether this was
an example of hamhanded federal procurement or, as the
Hamiltons allege, evidence of a massive conspiracy.</p>
<p>The courts, without directly addressing the role of Mr.
Meese or his top aides, have ruled for Inslaw. In 1987, a
federal bankruptcy judge found that midlevel Justice
Department officials, by means of "trickery, fraud and
deceit," stole the Promis case-management software and
purposely tried to force Inslaw's liquidation. Judge William
Bryant last November affirmed the decision, noting
enigmatically that testimony and depositions indicated
"Inslaw performed its contract in a hostile environment that
extended from the higher echelons of the Justice Department."</p>
<p>The department has exonerated itself in two internal
reviews, prompting conflict-of-interest allegations from the
Hamiltons. They have asked the federal court here to order a
new criminal investigation. (A Senate government affairs
subcommittee investigation last year failed to find proof of
a criminal conspiracy against Inslaw. But the subcommittee's
staff said they had been hindered by Justice Department
employees fearful they'd lose their jobs if they talked.)</p>
<p>Based on privately funded detective work, the Hamiltons
say they believe that investors with personal links to the
Reagan administration conspired with Meese Justice Department
officials to ruin Inslaw. The investors' alleged goal was to
acquire Promis -- possibly at Inslaw's liquidation sale --
and use the valuable software to win a bigger prize: the
Project Eagle contract to deliver at least 12,000 new
computer workstations, complete with software, to some 200
Justice Department sites nationwide.</p>
<p>"This is corruption, and it deserves to be prosecuted,"
contends Mr. Hamilton, who, with his wife, has resuscitated
Inslaw, which now sells updated versions of Promis to private
and municipal customers.</p>
<p>The Hamiltons' conspiracy theory is receiving
point-by-point attention from the House Judiciary Committee
investigators, in part because of Rep. Brooks's belief that
government agencies periodically punish contractors who cross
them. The committee staff also is considering questions the
Hamiltons have raised about Project Eagle.</p>
<p>Among these are why, after the protracted battle over
acquiring the Promis software, Project Eagle doesn't include
a uniform case-management program for all of the Justice
Department's branches. "It just doesn't make any sense at
all," says Mr. Miller, the private computer consultant.
Lawyers in the department's Washington headquarters can't tap
into a common data base to tell if someone in a regional
field office is working on the same case, confirms Tony
Salvemini, a technology analyst with the General Accounting
Office, a congressional watchdog agency.</p>
<p>Taking a dark view, the Hamiltons allege that the missing
case-management system was supposed to be the pilfered
Promis. Justice Department officials insist that the Eagle
contract, awarded last June to Tisoft Inc. of Fairfax, Va.,
doesn't include a uniform case-management system for a more
mundane, bureaucratic reason: Each of the department's major
components wants to design its own.</p>
<p>Frustrated to find his own small company under
congressional scrutiny and associated with the Inslaw
controversy, Tisoft's owner and chief executive officer,
Patrick Gallagher, says he doesn't know anything about the
Hamiltons' charges or about their software. He adds, "I feel
like we're caught up in a storm that has a life of its own."</p>
