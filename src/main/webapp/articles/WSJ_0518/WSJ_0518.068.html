	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said
he hasn't "made up my mind yet" about exactly when he will
retire from the No. 3 U.S. auto maker.
   But he told shareholders at the annual meeting here
yesterday that his contract with the Highland Park, Mich.,
company expires at the end of 1991, and that sticking to the
contract is "the plan I have at the moment."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Iacocca turned 65 years old last year, but agreed in
1987, when he signed his current employment contract, to stay
on as chairman and chief executive officer beyond that age.</p>
<p>In answer to a shareholder's question, Mr. Iacocca said
Chrysler doesn't anticipate sweetening pension payments for
its executives. General Motors Corp. recently proposed
changes in its plan that would nearly double pensions for
3,350 executives, including Chairman Roger B. Smith, who is
to retire this summer. "We do not intend to follow GM," Mr.
Iacocca said.</p>
<p>Replying to another question, Mr. Iacocca said he is "not
interested" in a leveraged buy-out and "I don't think our
board's interested in it." Rumors of such a move have
circulated periodically in the past few years.</p>
<p>Mr. Iacocca also said Chrysler doesn't plan to cut its
quarterly dividend, despite a widespread cost-cutting program
at the company. Chrysler's current annual payout rate is
$1.20 a share, which Mr. Iacocca said translates into about a
7.1% return. Chrysler shares closed yesterday at $16.50, down
37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
"Barring a disaster," he said, Chrysler doesn't "intend to
touch the dividend."</p>
