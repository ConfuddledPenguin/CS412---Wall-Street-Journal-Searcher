	<p class="article-leader">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysia's first-quarter
industrial production rose 11.1% from the same period last
year, the Statistics Department said.
   The department added that the March index at 160.8, was
15% higher than the February index at 139.8, and 10.4% above
the March 1989 index of 145.6.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The department attributed the increase in the index to
significant gains in all three major divisions. The
manufacturing index rose 16.3%, to 172.0 in the first
quarter, from 147.8 in 1989's first quarter; while the
electricity index rose 12.8%, to 153.8 from 136.4; and the
mining index rose 2.4%, from 129.5 to 132.6.</p>
<p>Fourteen of the 16 industrial groups under the
manufacturing division recorded increases in first-quarter
production indices. The leader was transport equipment,
followed by electrical machinery and nonmetallic mineral
products.</p>
