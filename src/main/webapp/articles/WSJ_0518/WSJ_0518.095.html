	<p class="article-leader">With regard to John F. Budd Jr.'s April 16 Manager's
Journal: Plaudits to Mr. Budd for an excellent article. It
should be required reading for every corporate executive.
Clearly, when even senior managers do not trust their CEOs,
we have a serious problem.
   This is, however, not difficult to understand. When we
have been exposed to the arrogance of Exxon following the
Valdez incident and the incompetence of the Drexel Burnham
Lambert crowd, how can we feel kindly toward large
corporations? When we have seen some of our major trademarks
sold at auction by the likes of Henry Kravis, T. Boone
Pickens and Frank Lorenzo, is it not difficult to believe in
the social conscience of businessmen? When GM lost more than
10% of the world auto market in the past decade, how do we
continue to accept that "What is good for General Motors is
good for the USA"?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The reputation of our politicians was damaged seriously by
the Watergate incident. Will the believability of our
executives suffer the same fate as a result of incidents such
as those mentioned above? Yes, corporate America needs to
improve its image. It also needs to improve its act or its
attempts at image enhancement will be only meaningless PR
gestures.</p>
