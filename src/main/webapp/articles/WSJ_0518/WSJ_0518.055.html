   After 45 years of shutting out new investors, the nation's
second-oldest stock fund has finally opened its doors again.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the move by the $575 million State Street Investment
Trust, which was launched in 1924 and has been closed to new
money since 1945, raised eyebrows among some mutual-fund
executives. That's because it comes just as the stock market
has climbed a wall of worry to record highs.</p>
<p>Met Life-State Street Investment Services Inc., the fund's
distributor, plays down the timing; officials say investors
simply were clamoring for them to reopen the ancient fund.</p>
<p>"It's not immune to market cycles, and we recognize that
it can't time the market short-term with precision," said
portfolio manager Peter C. Bennett. But he added, "This fund
has been through thick and thin."</p>
<p>Mr. Bennett, who has run the Boston-based fund for two
years, said investors who plunked down $10,000 in the fund in
1924 would have $28 million today. Last year, the fund rose
32.1%, compared with the 31.6% gain in the Standard & Poor's
500 stock index. But in the 10 years ending March 31, the
fund rose 289%, far less than the 410% gain in the S&P index,
according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc.</p>
<p>When State Street Investment Trust closed, the nation was
still in World War II, and the fund's assets stood at a
then-bloated $55 million. With the New York Stock Exchange
trading just one million shares a day, the fund had the
equivalent of a $6 billion portfolio today, fund executives
said. The 45-year hiatus is the longest period a fund has
been closed to new investors; many stock funds haven't been
around for that long.</p>
<p>The fund's 10 largest holdings make up 45% of assets; the
fund holds just 50 stocks. Its biggest holding, Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co., represents 7% of the fund. Overall, Met
Life-State Street manages a total of $16 billion, mostly in
pension funds; it manages about $3 billion in mutual funds
spread among 25 portfolios.</p>
<p>The fund's reopening has stirred a debate as to which fund
actually is the nation's oldest. Massachusetts Investors
Trust, incorporated in May 1924, is widely considered the
first. But the founders of the State Street fund, which
incorporated in July 1924, were managing money in 1923, State
Street officials say.</p>
<p>"We actually had the money first; our three founders were
managing an investment club that later became the fund," said
William P. Rich, Met Life-State Street president.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter when you started managing money,"
countered a spokesman for Massachusetts Financial Services,
adviser to Massachusetts Investors Trust. "What matters is
when you started an open-end mutual fund -- and Massachusetts
Investors Trust was the first."</p>
