	<p class="article-leader">French media group Havas SA announced that its
consolidated net profit after payments to minority interests
rose by 30% in 1989 to 975 million francs ($175.8 million)
from 751 million francs a year earlier.
   Consolidated revenue was up 20% for the year at 18.9
billion francs compared with 15.8 billion francs in 1988.
Both the revenue and the profit figures confirm preliminary
estimates that Havas released in February.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Havas said it plans to raise its net annual dividend to
5.75 francs a share, a 39% increase from the 4.13 francs paid
out last year. It will be paid beginning July 17.</p>
<p>Speaking to analysts, Havas Director of Development Michel
Boutinard-Rouelle said the company has targeted Europe as its
1990 primary growth market.</p>
<p>"Europe is on the rise," he said, noting that the region
is expected to represent 28% of Havas's total investments by
1992, up from 24% in 1988. The North American share,
meanwhile, is seen falling to 51% from 55%, while investment
in the rest of the world remains fairly steady.</p>
