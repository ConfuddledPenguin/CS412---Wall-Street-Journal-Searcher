	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said it will indefinitely
idle its Lakewood, Ga., assembly plant beginning Aug. 6
because of slow sales of the 1990-model Chevrolet Caprice
full-sized car and the Buick Estate Wagon station wagon.
About 2,200 workers will be affected.
   The No. 1 auto maker had announced its plans to idle the
Lakewood plant in September, but didn't specify then when the
closing would take place.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GM said it has scheduled daily and weekend overtime at its
Janesville, Wis.; Lordstown, Ohio; Orion, Mich., and Lansing,
Mich., assembly facilities.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. has planned overtime at its Wixom, Mich.;
Kansas City and St. Louis, Mo.; Twin Cities, Minn., and
Louisville, Ky., assembly plants.</p>
<p>Overall, the 10 major U.S. car makers planned to build
138,967 this week, down 11.2% from 156,524 a year ago.</p>
