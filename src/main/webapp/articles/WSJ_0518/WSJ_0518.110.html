	<p class="article-leader">The state of Alaska is preparing to impose tough new
environmental regulations on Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. in
an attempt to force Alyeska into anti-pollution improvements
the oil industry has spent years and millions of dollars
trying to avoid.
   Alyeska, a consortium owned by British Petroleum Ltd.,
Exxon Corp., Atlantic Richfield Co. and four other big oil
companies, operates the 800-mile Trans-Alaska pipeline and
the tanker and the oil-storage terminal in Valdez, Alaska,
where tankers take on loads of Alaskan crude bound for U.S.
refineries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new regulations mostly relate to a long-running
dispute over air pollution, both along the pipeline and at
the marine terminal. In conjunction with moves by the state,
the Environmental Protection Agency intends to issue findings
that Alyeska over the years frequently violated provisions of
federal environmental statutes. Ray Nye, director of the
EPA's Seattle office's air-quality section, said the agency
believes the violations have significantly increased
emissions of potentially dangerous hydrocarbon vapors, which
contain such toxins as benzene and toluene.</p>
<p>Ivan Henman, Alyeska's vice president for environmental
operations, said the consortium believes it has not violated
any environmental regulations and that its operations are
environmentally sound. "We are extremely interested in
protecting the environment," he said. "And we've said
repeatedly that if there are problems, we'll correct them."</p>
<p>The regulatory moves could prove a costly blow to Alyeska
and its owners; one EPA official estimated that meeting just
one element of the new regulations could cost "many tens of
millions of dollars." They could also signal a turning point
in more than a decade of generally fruitless or half-hearted
efforts by environmentalists and state and federal regulators
to force Alyeska to meet higher environmental standards.</p>
<p>The actions are more fallout from the Exxon Valdez oil
spill, which continues to reverberate 14 months after the
supertanker ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound.
Alyeska came under fierce public criticism for its
unsuccessful efforts to contain the 11-million gallon spill,
the nation's largest. Many environmentalists and state and
federal regulators say that response reflected what critics
allege is Alyeska's blase attitude toward the environment,
and a history of resisting proposals to upgrade its
operations for environmental reasons. For its part, Alyeska
always has maintained that its environmental record is
excellent.</p>
<p>But state and federal officials say the state's Department
of Environmental Conservation now is in the final stages of
drafting new air quality permits based on joint state and
federal investigations that have found that Alyeska has
frequently violated federal pollution statutes over the years
by modifying equipment -- such as incinerators for burning
off toxic vapors and turbines used to power pumps along the
pipeline -- without conducting required reviews of how the
modifications would effect hydrocarbon emissions. State and
EPA officials have concluded that the modifications increased
air pollution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, state officials say the state intends to
require that Alyeska set up a system for capturing and
disposing of toxic vapors that stream out of vents on tanker
decks as oil is pumped from storage tanks into the ships'
cargo holds. Alyeska has vehemently rejected past suggestions
from regulators that it should do that, but its case may have
been weakened by a recent Arco study that found that as much
as 750 tons of benzene escape into the air each year during
loading operations. One state regulator described the benzene
levels as "shockingly high." The EPA's Mr. Nye said the
benzene emissions are high enough to "warrant concern about
potential health problems."</p>
<p>Indeed Alyeska, which for years had argued that tanker
loading emissions weren't significant, now has a policy
requiring employees involved in tanker loading and certain
other operations at the terminal to wear respirators.</p>
<p>Alyeska's Mr. Henman said Alyeska doesn't believe the data
from the Arco study is sufficient evidence upon which to base
regulatory decisions. And he said Alyeska still maintains its
longstanding legal position on tanker-loading emissions, that
Alyeska can't be required to capture and dispose of the
emissions because Alyeska doesn't own the tankers. Regulators
find that stance disingenuous, noting that many of the
tankers are owned by the same big oil companies that own
Alyeska.</p>
<p>Mr. Henman also said Alyeska will soon begin an
air-monitoring program that will test air quality in the
Valdez area. The study, financed and designed by Alyeska, has
been in the works for at least two years, but has been held
up by disputes between regulators and Alyeska over the
placement of monitoring devices, among other things. "If this
program finds any problems, we will do whatever it takes to
fix them," he said.</p>
<p>State officials don't intend to wait. They said they hope
to inform Alyeska of the new regulations officially by June
1, when a temporary air permit issued two months ago expires.
"We have been going around and around with them for years,
and now we are finally throwing down the gauntlet," said one
state regulator.</p>
