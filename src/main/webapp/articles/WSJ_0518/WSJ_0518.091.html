	<p class="article-leader">Xerox Corp. will post lower profit in 1990 than in 1989,
even before taking into account a $375 million post-tax
write-off for bad real-estate investments, chairman and chief
executive officer David Kearns told the company's annual
meeting in Rochester, N.Y.
   In a separate statement, President Paul Allaire, who will
take over from Mr. Kearns as chief executive Aug. 1, made
Xerox's first public comments about a new line of
multi-functional office equipment that the company plans to
unveil later this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kearns was also bullish on the Stamford, Conn.-based
company's future, but conceded that continued growth in
Xerox's core office-equipment business won't offset a rapid
deterioration in its financial-services arm in 1990.
First-quarter revenue from financial services sagged 5% from
year-ago levels, while profit plummeted 84%, from $67 million
to $11 million, on weak results from insurer Crum & Forster
Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Kearns, whose remarks didn't come as a surprise to
analysts, said this weakness in financial services will
continue, and added that Crum & Forster's capital gains
aren't likely to reach the heights of last year, when they
contributed $359 million to Xerox's bottom line.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he said Xerox's financial-services
subsidiaries aren't for sale, and are well-positioned for
improved profitability when the battered insurance sector
recovers. But he noted that "alternatives to our strategy may
or may not be necessary."</p>
<p>On the office-equipment side, Mr. Kearns said the effects
of recent government austerity measures in Brazil, where
Xerox does substantial business, remain unclear. Xerox did
better than expected in Brazil during the first quarter, he
said, but will likely do worse for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, Xerox reported a
larger-than-expected loss of $254 million, or $2.93 a share.
That included the $375 million charge, which related to
Xerox's abandonment of its investments in VMS Realty
Partners, a troubled real-estate concern.</p>
<p>Since those results, most analysts have forecast a drop in
1990 earnings. In 1989, Xerox earned $704 million, or $6.41 a
share, on revenue of $17.6 billion. In composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Xerox shares closed
unchanged at $49.875.</p>
<p>Mr. Allaire's comments focused on Xerox's future strategy,
and in particular on a new line of multi-functional office
equipment slated to be announced later this year. Though he
gave few details, he said these machines will be a departure
from Xerox's current copiers, which view documents as
transient images.</p>
<p>Instead, he said, the new devices will store documents in
digital form -- as a series of electronic impulses
representing ones and zeroes. Users will be able to
manipulate these "digital documents" with computers, then
print them out in different locations.</p>
<p>In essence, the technology will combine copying, scanning,
printing and facsimile capabilities in one machine that may
be called a Hydra.</p>
<p>In a related development, Xerox said it will unveil
Tuesday four models of a multifunction machine that can copy
and fax, with some document-editing features. While the
machine demonstrates many of the features Mr. Allaire spoke
of, a Xerox spokesman said emphatically that "this isn't the
Hydra."</p>
