	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- A sharp rise in imports caused Japan's April
trade surplus to drop 51.4% from the year before, reversing a
widening of the surplus in March.
   The April trade surplus, measured on a customs-cleared
basis, fell to $3.54 billion from $7.29 billion a year
earlier, the Finance Ministry said. Exports fell 5.8% to
$21.87 billion from $23.22 billion, while imports rose 15% to
$18.33 billion from $15.93 billion. In March, the trade
surplus increased for the first time in nearly a year, rising
7.2% to $7.09 billion from $6.61 billion in March 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ministry officials said that both April's sharp decline
and March's increase in the surplus were in large part due to
distortions caused by the imposition of a 3% consumption tax
in April 1989. Imports were unusually low in April last year,
as consumers were discouraged to spend after the new tax made
prices higher. That heightened the increase in the
year-to-year comparison of imports. But a rush of last-minute
purchases in March 1989 had increased imports for that month,
and one result was the upturn in the surplus in March 1990.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the narrowing surplus came as a relief to
the Japanese government, which continues to receive U.S.
pressure to correct the bilateral trade imbalance. Both
countries are trying to improve their trade relationship by
removing structural impediments in their economies that
supposedly prevent Japan's surplus and the U.S. deficit from
shrinking.</p>
<p>In April, the trade surplus with the U.S. declined a hefty
46.2%, to $2.45 billion from $4.54 billion a year earlier.
Exports to the U.S. fell 15.1% to $6.72 billion, while
imports rose 26.8% to $4.27 billion.</p>
<p>The drop in the trade surplus last month convinced some
economists that the surplus will continue to narrow for a
while longer. Although Japan's surplus had been steadily
shrinking for most of the past year, many had feared that the
drop in the value of the yen against the dollar until
recently would encourage companies to step up exports again,
since dollar-denominated prices of Japanese goods would be
lower. The Ministry calculated April exports at 157.2 yen to
the dollar, compared with 132.12 yen a year earlier.</p>
<p>The drop in the surplus "lets a little steam off the
argument that the weaker yen will lead to an export boom,"
said Paul Summerville, an economist for Jardine Fleming
Securities Ltd. Pressure from the Japanese government and
slower growth in the U.S. economy will also keep exports from
rising too quickly, Mr. Summerville said.</p>
<p>But other economists noted that by a different measure,
Japan's trade surplus has been increasing gradually this
year. Seasonally adjusted figures for the first four months
of 1990 showed the surplus to be growing at an annualized
rate of $60 billion, said Hirohiko Okumura, chief economist
for Nomura Research Institute Ltd. In the final quarter of
1989, he said, the surplus grew at an annualized pace of $50
billion.</p>
<p>In addition, said Mr. Okumura, "the surplus is expanding
despite a recent government import promotion program. That is
something to watch out for."</p>
<p>Exports in April were especially weak to the U.S.
Shipments of autos to the U.S. fell 33.7% to $1.5 billion,
reflecting slow demand in the American market and increased
local production by Japanese auto makers, ministry officials
said. Exports of videocassette recorders to the U.S. also
dropped sharply.</p>
