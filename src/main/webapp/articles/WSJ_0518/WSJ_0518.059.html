letter of intent to cooperate with
Starkstrom-Anlagenbau-Rostock, an East German
power-technology company, in the field of electricity
distribution.
   The West German electronics group said SAR has a strong
presence in the northern parts of East Germany. Last week,
Siemens signed virtually the same accord with

in southern East Germany.</p>
