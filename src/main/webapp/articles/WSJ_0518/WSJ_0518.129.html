	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Mesa Limited Partnership will be able to make
its 1990 interest and debt payments without having to sell
assets, though "It'll be close," T. Boone Pickens Jr.,
general partner, said after the annual meeting.
   He said that Mesa still would like to sell at least $100
million to $200 million of assets this year to aid its cash
flow but that cash flow and the company's cash and marketable
securities portfolio are sufficient to make roughly $160
million in interest payments and about $111 million in debt
payments that are due this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Still, in its quarterly report filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the oil and gas partnership warned
that either gas prices must improve or it must sell oil and
gas properties to remain in compliance with its debt
covenants. Mesa, which has been hurt because of continued low
natural gas prices and a heavy debt load, had about $1.63
billion in long-term debt as of March 31.</p>
<p>The company also said in its filing that it hopes to repay
$300 million in debt during the next two years.</p>
<p>Citing the lack of cash flow to support distributions,
Mesa said last month it would suspended its annual preferred
distribution of $1.50 a unit. Earlier this month, it omitted
its common distribution. It also abandoned a plan to raise
$300 million to $400 million by selling royalty interests in
its prized Hugoton Field properties, citing unexpected delays
in the offering and disappointing market reaction.</p>
<p>In speaking to more than 300 unit holders at the meeting,
Mr. Pickens said he hopes natural gas prices will recover
enough so that Mesa can resume its distributions by 1992 or
1993. But Mesa said it needs sustained natural gas prices of
$2.50 for each 1,000 cubic feet to maintain an annual
preferred distribution of $1.50 a unit, and sustained prices
of $3.50 for each 1,000 cubic feet to pay a common
distribution of the same amount. Mesa is committed to paying
its preferred holders a distribution of 37.5 cents a unit for
five quarters before it can resume the common payout.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickens also acknowledged that while Mesa has paid out
about $1.1 billion in distributions since the partnership was
formed in 1985, it probably paid out "$400 million to $500
million too much," in light of continuing depressed demand
for natural gas. But he defended his decision to borrow funds
and sell assets to make those payments, saying that Mesa
didn't waste the money on unnecessary exploration. "We sent
it to you," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Pickens said Mesa expects natural gas prices to
average about $1.65 for each 1,000 cubic feet this year,
about the same as last year, but is predicting the prices
will climb to $3 in 1993.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Mesa also disclosed that a group of former
Unocal Corp. shareholders sued it and more than 100 others in
March, seeking $750 million in damages in connection with
Mesa's 1985 investment in and tender offer for Unocal. Mr.
Pickens said Mesa intends to defend itself vigorously against
the suit.</p>
