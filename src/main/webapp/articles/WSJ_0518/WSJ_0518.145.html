	<h3>Heard on the Street: Rockwell, One of the Stocks Gorbachev Sent To the Doghouse, Flexes Muscles for Comeback</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">When is a defense stock not a defense stock? When it is
Rockwell International.
   Rockwell today is a mixed bag, getting about 40% of its
revenue from electronics, 32% from aerospace, 19% from
automotive operations, mainly axles and brakes for trucks,
and 9% from graphics, chiefly big printing presses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many people still view Rockwell mainly as a military
contractor, and defense stocks are pariahs in the prevailing
cut-the-budget-and-deal-with-Gorbachev climate. A few years
ago, Rockwell was dependent on defense; the B-1 bomber was
its most important product. Today, however, military business
accounts for less than 25% of sales.</p>
<p>With defense stocks in the doghouse and conglomerates not
in fashion on Wall Street either, shares of the
Pittsburgh-based company are trading for a very modest 10
times the past 12 months' earnings. The stock, which reached
30 7/8 in 1987, has traded in the low to mid-20s for most of
this year. Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange, it closed at 25 3/8.</p>
<p>Yet the company is solidly profitable, has shown increased
earnings in most years recently and sports a muscular balance
sheet: Its total debt is less than 20% of total capital.</p>
<p>Proponents say the out-of-favor stock could provide
handsome capital gains to long-term investors. Rockwell "has
managed pretty well through adversity," says Hanspeter Giger
of First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C., which recently
bought more than 100,000 shares. When Rockwell's big B-1
bomber program was cut way back in 1988 and 1989, "everybody
in the world thought they would lose a substantial amount of
their sales," Mr. Giger says. But the company found
sufficient new business so that sales fell only slightly.</p>
<p>Rockwell's nonmilitary divisions "are really doing quite
well," says Eric Miller, chief investment officer at
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "They're not well known. And
the company is continuing with a major share-repurchase
program."</p>
<p>Donaldson analyst David Moore likes Rockwell's position as
the largest supplier to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, or NASA. Long term, he thinks Rockwell "will
continue to dominate the space industry," including the
National Aerospace Plane project and the lunar and Mars
programs.</p>
<p>Even though defense spending is being cut, space spending
is growing. A 24% increase in NASA budget authority to $15.2
billion is proposed for 1991. Congress may chip away at that,
Mr. Moore says, but probably will let NASA's budget grow at a
10%-to-15% annual clip for the next five years.</p>
<p>Not everything in the outlook for Rockwell is rosy. Paul
Nisbet, a Prudential-Bache analyst who rates the stock a
hold, notes that a big chunk of sales are to the auto
industry, which is "not extremely robust." As for printing
presses, he says, "we don't see much growth in that. They've
pretty well saturated the world with these big multicolor
presses for newspapers."</p>
<p>Mr. Nisbet thinks Rockwell's sales will creep up only
slowly during the next few years, to $13 billion in 1994 from
about $12.5 billion in fiscal 1989. Even though he likes the
way chief executive Donald R. Beall is steering the company
into high-technology businesses and selling off some smaller
and lower-tech operations, Mr. Nisbet doesn't think earnings
will rise rapidly. Most analysts look for flat earnings this
year and next.</p>
<p>But Wolfgang Demisch, director of research for UBS Philips
& Drew, and for many years a highly regarded Wall Street
defense analyst, thinks Rockwell shares will reach 32 by year
end, which would be a 28% gain from recent levels.</p>
<p>Mr. Demisch likes that unglamorous truck-part business. "I
would say they are clearly the world leaders" in truck axles
and brakes, he says, adding that Rockwell is building its
truck-parts business in Europe, where big trucks are becoming
more common. "Europe didn't use to have Godzilla trucks, but
nowadays they do."</p>
<p>At Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co., a big Boston
money-management firm with a strong stock-picking record, a
complex computer model spat out advice to buy Rockwell late
last year. The firm bought about 200,000 shares then and
early this year but isn't buying any right now. Co-founder
Jeremy Grantham says that Rockwell looks good on the model's
value and momentum measures, but that investor interest in
the stock is higher than Grantham Mayo prefers. He won't say
what measure of investor interest is used.</p>
<p>It certainly couldn't be Wall Street recommendations. Most
of Wall Street couldn't care less about Rockwell. Of 14
brokerage firms whose opinions were tallied recently by Zacks
Investment Research, only two rated the stock a buy.</p>
<p>That's just fine with Mr. Giger of First Union, who says:
"We're attracted to names that are not today's hot idea."</p>
