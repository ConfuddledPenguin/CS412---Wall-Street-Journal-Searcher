	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- After years of trying to mesh its warring
parts, Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. is about to
reshape itself, splitting its investment banking business
from its big brokerage network.
   Shearson, the nation's second-biggest securities firm, is
expected as soon as next week to announce a series of
organizational changes that could include a new corporate
name and the uncoupling of Shearson's two main businesses:
its brokerage business for individual investors and its
investment-banking and institutional trading operations. The
new investment-banking unit is likely to resurrect the
magical Lehman Brothers name, employees briefed on the
realignment said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We need a new identity," said one senior manager, one of
many who have been briefed and debriefed in recent weeks by
McKinsey & Co., a management consultant that has encouraged
the splitting of Shearson into two main business halves.</p>
<p>People familiar with Shearson's plans say that the firm
probably will change its name to Shearson Lehman Holdings
Inc. or SLH Holdings Inc., with two separate divisions under
it, and that each might eventually have its own internal
profit-and-loss statements.</p>
<p>One division probably would be Shearson's retail brokerage
business for individual investors; it would have nearly
10,000 stockbrokers and retain the Shearson name. The other
division, which would include investment-banking and
capital-markets operations, might operate under a resurrected
name of Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Shearson, the struggling American Express Co. unit,
acquired the venerable Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb Inc.
investment bank in 1984; that was after Lehman's traders and
investment bankers split the firm in a civil war. Former
Lehman partners never fully integrated into Shearson's
corporate culture; some still announce themselves as "Lehman
Brothers" bankers. And Shearson retains a separate Lehman
brokerage operation for rich investors.</p>
<p>Some Lehman veterans -- there are about 1,000 still at
Shearson, including brokers -- aren't hiding their desire to
resurrect their old firm, at least in name. "The Lehman name
stands for something in investment banking and capital
markets," said James Stern, a Shearson Lehman investment
banker and Lehman veteran. "As for the Shearson name, I'm not
sure it's the greatest name in the world. It's better than
the ayatollah's."</p>
<p>But some senior managers of Shearson are against the
splitting of the brokerage business from investment banking,
if only because it will fan speculation that Shearson's
parent, American Express, is splitting up Shearson as a
precursor to selling it.</p>
<p>Shearson executives briefed on the expected changes said
such speculation is erroneous, although the timing of the
split-up is nevertheless unfortunate. "I think the timing is
wrong, but the philosophy is good," said one senior manager.</p>
<p>As part of the reorganization. Sherman R. Lewis Jr.,
Shearson's head of investment and merchant banking, and
Richard S. Fuld Jr., head of capital markets, are expected to
head the Lehman Brothers entity, people familiar with the
plan said. (Mr. Lewis has Shearson roots, and Mr. Fuld is a
Lehman veteran.)</p>
<p>The realignment would play down a separate identity for
what remains of E.F. Hutton & Co., the well-known but deeply
troubled brokerage firm that Shearson acquired in 1988, just
after the stock-market crash. About 6,500 Hutton employees,
mostly stockbrokers, remain at Shearson; many of them, too,
have chafed at being part of Shearson. Most of the new
Shearson names under consideration don't include "Hutton."</p>
<p>Howard L. Clark Jr., a former American Express official
installed as Shearson's chairman earlier this year, is known
to favor a decentralization of authority at Shearson similar
to the management philosophy at American Express. He declined
to comment yesterday. A Shearson spokesman said: "We are
considering a number of options on how we could regroup our
businesses. We're still considering options."</p>
<p>In recent months, Shearson has been struggling to deal
with financial and management problems, made worse by Wall
Street's recession. American Express was forced to inject
more than $1 billion into Shearson to prop up its capital
levels. The parent has also had to increase its stake in
Shearson, buying virtually all of it, rather than pulling
away, as American Express has long wanted.</p>
<p>American Express plans to acquire the remaining publicly
traded shares of Shearson, subject to a shareholders' vote
expected in June.</p>
<p>Shearson took a huge restructuring charge in the first
quarter to pay for thousands of layoffs, the closing of 67
U.S. branch offices and other cost-cutting efforts. That gave
Shearson a $915 million first-quarter loss, a record for a
U.S. securities firm. Shearson said that no new restructuring
charge will be required for its latest changes.</p>
<p>Shearson officials said that under the expected
realignment, Shearson's big Boston Co. money-management unit
probably will report directly to the new Shearson holding
company. A number of Shearson administrative staffers would
report directly to the holding company as well.</p>
<p>How will the Shearson split-up play on Wall Street? The
stock market has hammered Shearson's stock price to less than
half of its 1987 issue price of $34. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, Shearson stock closed
at $13.875 a share, down 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>The initial reaction from a top securities-industry
analyst was positive. "You know, one of their goals is to
keep good people," said Lawrence Eckenfelder of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "Well, if you create a
seperate investment bank, like the old Lehman, you could give
guys incentives to stay. By giving them an identity, I just
think you would help, longer term, as far as stemming some
defections."</p>
<p>Some Lehman bankers are already hoping that Lehman is
eventually taken public by American Express. "It gives
{American Express} a hell of a lot more flexibility" as far
as splitting off Lehman down the road, said Mr. Eckenfelder.
American Express has vehemently denied it currently has any
plans to sell Shearson or any of its parts.</p>
<p>American Express stock closed at $29.50 a share, up 25
cents in Big Board trading yesterday.</p>
<p>Mr. Eckenfelder said the Shearson changes should be "a
positive" for American Express stock. American Express stock
rallied earlier this week on renewed rumors that Shearson or
part of it might be sold. American Express "categorically"
denied the speculation.</p>
<p>Shearson's Mr. Clark also has discouraged such
speculation. In an interview last month, he said: "I was not
sent down to Shearson by American Express to fix it, package
it and sell it; I was sent to run it."</p>
<p>Still, one top Shearson manager said he wishes the
reconfiguration plan were put off. "Why now, when we have so
many other problems?" he said. "There should be some good
news {about Shearson} first." Some Shearson investment
bankers said that some corporate clients recently have denied
Shearson investment banking business with the explanation
that they are just too unsure of where Shearson is headed.</p>
<p>In recent months, finger-pointing has abounded within
Shearson Lehman as various divisions blame the firm's overall
losses on other departments. "I don't want to start the war
between the investment bankers and the traders or the retail
business all over again," said one former Lehman partner.
"But each group here thinks it's been successful. Everyone
thinks they made money last year. They all believe
{Shearson's troubles} are the other groups' fault."</p>
<p>The McKinsey study is being led by McKinsey director Peter
Flaherty. McKinsey earlier had persuaded Merrill Lynch & Co.,
the nation's biggest brokerage firm, to separate its Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets operation from the retail-brokerage
side of the firm. But Merrill's separation is much more
cosmetic than the one envisioned at Shearson. Mr. Flaherty
didn't return phone calls.</p>
<p>Shearson is expected to break even for the second quarter,
analysts said. Even without the big $787 million
restructuring charge, the firm would have lost money on an
operating basis in the first quarter.</p>
