	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- West Coast Video Enterprises Inc. has sued
MCA Inc. and its subsidiary Universal City Studios for
allegedly breaching an exclusive promotion agreement, after
MCA's "secret" talks with West Coast Video competitor
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp.
   The complaint, filed in state court, says the exclusive
nature of the promotion, set to coincide with the opening of
MCA's Universal Studios Florida in Orlando next month, was
particularly important to Philadelphia-based West Coast Video
because rival Blockbuster is based in Ft. Lauderdale,
Florida. The promotion agreement would have given West Coast
Video a marketing presence in Florida.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The promotion was to have featured game cards given to
video store patrons -- with prizes, including trips to
Orlando and free video rentals -- West Coast Video said.</p>
<p>After allegedly disavowing its agreement with West Coast
Video last December, MCA this spring announced a "Blockbuster
Video $10 Million Game" with Blockbuster.</p>
<p>West Coast is seeking at least $1 million in damages and
an injunction barring any promotional campaign coinciding
with the opening of the theme park. Blockbuster is not named
as a defendant.</p>
<p>In Universal City, Calif., MCA general counsel Robert Hadl
said the company hadn't yet been served with the suit, and
therefore, he couldn't comment.</p>
