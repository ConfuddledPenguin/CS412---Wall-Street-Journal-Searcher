	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- With American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s new
credit card attracting strong consumer interest, four of the
nation's largest card issuers attacked its legality.
   The banking companies -- Citicorp, Chase Manhattan Corp.,
BankAmerica Corp. and MNC Financial Corp. -- asked the
Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Communications Commission
and the Georgia state Banking Department to examine whether
the AT&T venture violates banking and communications law.
Three of the companies also have raised banking issues with
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The complaints come as card-industry analysts estimate
that AT&T has received more than 10 million inquiries so far.
They say that AT&T has approved and issued between 200,000
and 300,000 of its Universal credit cards since the unveiling
on March 26, numbers that AT&T won't confirm.</p>
<p>But James L. Bailey, group executive for Citicorp's U.S.
credit cards, said, "We would welcome any competition. We're
not trying to keep anyone out. But there are questions about
how AT&T has entered the business and how the Universal Bank
is structured."</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Bailey said the Universal card has had no
impact on Citicorp. "Our sales in May are over our forecast,
and our account acquisitions are on target."</p>
<p>"The issues that have been raised {are} nothing that we
didn't anticipate. . . . {They} are without merit," said
Peter Gallagher, senior vice president in charge of
regulatory and consumer affairs for AT&T Universal Card
Services Corp. "We feel we did our homework and anticipated
what the possible questions would be. We're in this business
to stay."</p>
<p>AT&T has teamed up with the second-largest processor of
credit cards in the country, Total Systems Services Inc., a
subsidiary of Synovus Financial Corp., a Columbus, Ga., bank
holding company. Another Synovus subsidiary, Universal Bank,
is the issuer of the cards and handles billing on card
transactions.</p>
<p>The banks have charged that AT&T, in effect, controls
Universal Bank and is therefore violating federal banking
laws, which forbid commercial and industrial companies from
owning commercial banks. AT&T owns a small stake in Universal
Bank and buys the bank's credit card receivables.</p>
<p>The banks also allege that Universal Bank is no more than
a funding vehicle for an unregulated affiliate, namely AT&T,
and that Universal is grossly undercapitalized, given that it
has only $3 million in capital, but has ambitions to reach
five million customers in the next few years.</p>
<p>In the FCC complaint, the banks argue that the 10%
discount on long-distance calls that AT&T is giving its
cardholders amounts to "predatory pricing" against other
telecommunication providers and a tariff reduction that the
FCC hasn't sanctioned. What's more, say the banks, if AT&T
were to contend Universal Bank is giving the discount, then
the banks would argue Universal is reselling long-distance
service without FCC sanction.</p>
<p>AT&T has refused to give figures on how many of its
customers have been issued the cards. But Mr. Gallagher said
the company received 250,000 inquiries from its customers in
the 24-hour period after announcing its Universal bank card,
about 15 times what it had been expecting the first day.</p>
<p>"From March 26 to May 17, our expectations have been
exceeded by 250%," Mr. Gallagher said. "It has exceeded our
wildest expectations."</p>
<p>The big challenge for AT&T will be to turn these Universal
card customers into late-paying credit card customers. The
company already has 46 million users of its long-distance
calling card, but its customers are notorious on-time payers,
an anathema to a credit issuer that seeks to profit from
finance charges.</p>
<p>Moreover, the big banks have a huge head start over AT&T.
Citicorp is the largest issuer of credit cards, with more
than 37 million card holders world-wide. Chase, BankAmerica
and MNC, the parent of Maryland National Bank, are second,
third and sixth, respectively.</p>
<p>Still, some experts expect AT&T to be one of the top
players within a few years. AT&T Universal Card has set up an
operation in Jacksonville, Fla., that can handle the
back-office and telemarketing needs of a financial services
company with millions of customers.</p>
<p>"AT&T won't make any money on this for two to three
years," said Spencer Nilson, who publishes the Nilson Report,
a newsletter on the credit industry. But "within five years,
they'll have 35 million cardholders. They're terribly
efficient. I'd say they're issuing about 7,500 cards a day. I
got my card within seven days, compared with more than three
weeks with some other cards."</p>
<p>At least one credit card expert saw the bank action as an
attempt to stifle the card's success. "It's a harassment
action," said Elgie Holstein, executive director of the
Bankcard Holders of America, a nonprofit consumer credit,
education and advocacy group. "This is an attempt to do in a
major new competitor by . . . companies that are engaged in
acquiring portfolios of smaller and medium-sized players.
They're the primary movers in the increasing consolidation
and decreasing competitiveness of the industry."</p>
