	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- International business leaders expect sales
and profits to rise this quarter, reversing a recent trend of
pessimism, according to Dun & Bradstreet Corp.'s latest

   The prospects were felt to be bleakest in Brazil,
Australia and England; while optimism ran highest in Italy,
Switzerland and West Germany.</p>
