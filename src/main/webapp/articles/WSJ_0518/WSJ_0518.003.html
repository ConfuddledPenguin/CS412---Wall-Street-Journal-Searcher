	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. named the
companies selected to help it develop a digital mobile
telephone system. The inclusion of two U.S. concerns raised
U.S. hopes for greater access to Japan's multibillion-dollar
telecommunications market.
   NTT, after reviewing proposals from domestic and foreign
firms, invited American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s AT&T
International Inc. unit and Motorola Inc., along with Telefon
AB L.M. Ericsson of Sweden, to join seven Japanese concerns
in developing base-station equipment and telephone sets for
the system.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There was concern that NTT wasn't living up to a
procurement accord with the U.S., dating back to 1981.
However, NTT's announcement prompted U.S. officials to praise
the company for trying harder to abide by its commitment to
order equipment in a "nondiscriminatory" manner.</p>
<p>"This is another signal that Japan is providing adequate
opportunities for foreign companies to participate in this
sector," said Juan Benitez, deputy assistant secretary of
commerce for science and electronics. "At the very least, I'd
welcome it."</p>
<p>In Tokyo, an NTT spokesman denied that the contract
represented any change in the company's procurement policy.
NTT has been seeking foreign suppliers since the Japanese
telecommunications market was deregulated in 1985, he said.
"The policy is fair and open procurement," the spokesman
added. "We will procure from domestic and overseas companies
if they have good products and cheap products."</p>
<p>NTT plans to finish the development phase of its digital
system by 1992, but the spokesman said the company doesn't
know when it will begin procurement. The spokesman said it is
possible that the foreign companies that received the
development contracts will receive procurement contracts as
well.</p>
<p>The U.S. isn't likely to have more than a modest share of
the project, whose value hasn't been disclosed. However,
Allen Frischkorn, president of the Washingtonbased
Telecommunications Industry Association, predicted the
project could earn U.S. concerns substantial collateral
business as they gain experience in the hardto-crack Japanese
market.</p>
<p>Some U.S. officials, however, said they want to see
further indications of a widening Japanese market. "This is
something that the Commerce Department will be looking at
very carefully as the process continues," said Michael
Farren, undersecretary of commerce for international trade.</p>
<p>In December, the NTT procurement accord was renewed for
three years despite some complaints that it wasn't
stimulating enough purchases of U.S. equipment. NTT ordered
$350 million in U.S. equipment in the Japanese fiscal year
that ended in March, but this amount was equivalent to only
4% of NTT's total procurement of $8.75 billion. Mr.
Frischkorn said he hopes U.S. vendors eventually will attain
20% of NTT's procurement business.</p>
<p>Japan's mobile phone market is still relatively
undeveloped, with penetration only about one-fourth that of
the U.S. and Britain, according to some studies. Analysts say
that opening up the market to more competitors, in addition
to moving to the more advanced digital technology, may help
cut prices and spread use.</p>
<p>Traditionally, NTT has rarely publicly disclosed
development projects, instead quietly farming them out to
Japanese companies. But, under U.S. pressure, NTT in recent
years has been trying to demonstrate publicly it is opening
up its procurement process to foreign companies.</p>
<p>The Bush administration also is encouraged by NTT's
apparent willingness to give U.S. concerns a role in
supplying future-generation equipment. "This aspect is as
significant as the money involved," said another U.S. trade
official.</p>
<p>Tom L. Powers, president of AT&T's Network Systems'
Cellular Systems unit, said that while the "initial contract
awards will be small, {about} $10 million over the next few
years," getting a piece of the NTT project is still an
important win. "This is the way you solve trade problems," he
said. "Not by big contracts but an accretion of hundreds and
hundreds of smaller deals such as this."</p>
<p>The AT&T unit has been chosen to supply radio
transmitters, receivers and amplifiers, which are used to
pass calls from one phone to another in a cellular network.</p>
<p>The agreement on cellular equipment is not AT&T's first in
Japan. In the past few years the company's Network Systems
Group has received orders from NTT totaling $350 million for
computerized network management systems and fiber-optic
transmission gear. It is also one of several owners of Japan
Enhanced Network Services, a data network service.</p>
<p>A Washington-based Motorola spokeswoman said the company's
part in the project could involve supplying NTT with its
newest voice-coding and decoding technology. U.S. vendors
previously complained that NTT reserved such high-value
orders for its domestic suppliers.</p>
<p>AT&T and Motorola already are among NTT's leading U.S.
suppliers, along with International Business Machines Corp.
and Digital Equipment Corp. However, Ericsson's participation
represents an even bigger symbolic win for European
suppliers. The company said its share of NTT's order was the
biggest so far for a European telecommunications concern in
Japan. It didn't provide further details about the contract.</p>
<p>Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson chief executive officer, said the
order "is of utmost strategic value since Japan was the only
large important market in the world where Ericsson isn't
present with mobile phone systems."</p>
<p>Ericsson had been one of the leading suppliers of analog
cellular systems and claims a 40% global share of such
cellular systems installed to date. Some analysts had
expected that share to dwindle amid tougher competition for
new-generation digital cellular systems.</p>
<p>The U.S. trade official said NTT's increasing purchases of
U.S. equipment are a direct result of trade negotiations.
"This didn't happen by itself," he said.</p>
<p>In addition to nondiscrimination, the NTT procurement
accord commits the corporate giant to conduct its contract
awards in a "transparent" manner.</p>
