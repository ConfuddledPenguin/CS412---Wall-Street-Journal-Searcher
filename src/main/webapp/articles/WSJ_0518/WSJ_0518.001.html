	<p class="article-leader">SOWETO, South Africa -- To get a good look at the
economics of black South Africa, join the party at Thulane
Siza's house.
   Music tumbles out into the street. Empty bottles of beer
and soft drinks overflow in the trash can. Steaks sizzle on
the grill out back. In the kitchen, the host adjusts his bank
balance.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I should collect at least 2,000 rand (about $800) today,"
says Mr. Siza, a factory worker. "First thing tomorrow, it's
all going into the bank."</p>
<p>It may look like an ordinary party, but this is a stokvel,
a rotating credit union among Mr. Siza and his friends. On
this Sunday, Mr. Siza collects at least 75 rand from each of
the other 11 members of his stokvel, in addition to the
profit from the sales of drinks and food to anyone from the
neighborhood who drops by. Next week, another member will
host, and so it goes every Sunday until each member has had
his turn. Then the cycle starts again. In a good month of
work, with overtime, Mr. Siza will earn about 1,000 rand. A
good stokvel will double that.</p>
<p>"It's the only way we're able to save," he says.
"Individually, with my wages, it is very difficult. But with
the help of the group it is easy." By the end of the year,
Mr. Siza hopes to have put enough away for a down payment on
a better house.</p>
<p>Stokvels are a traditional means of selfhelp in the
impoverished black community: friends and neighbors banding
together to make ends meet. (Stokvel is an Afrikaans word
meaning "cattle fair," an old rural bartering system.) But in
the past few years, stokvels have become sophisticated
instruments of high finance, helping South Africa's black
majority crash the gates of First World economics, long the
exclusive domain of the privileged white minority.</p>
<p>Until very recently, the country's apartheid, or racial
segregation, laws prevented blacks from owning property,
which meant they had no collateral, which in turn meant they
had little access to capital. Stokvels give them this access
and are the major financing method for everything from
washers and dryers to cars and houses. Many black
entrepreneurs use stokvel savings as the venture capital that
banks are unwilling to provide. In one stokvel, called the
High Flyers, six women, all of them nurses or teachers, save
money for an annual vacation. Last year, they jetted off to
Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"We have to pull ourselves up with our own bootstraps,"
says Jabu Mabaso, the coordinator of the National Stokvel
Association. "The stokvels are our major bootstrap."</p>
<p>For South African whites, who dominate the country's
business sector, the success of the stokvel system has been a
real eyeopener, illustrating the black community's economic
clout. A recent survey by a market research group estimated
that 24,000 stokvels in the major urban areas accumulate more
than 50 million rand a month. The stokvel association says
this amount is only the tip of the iceberg, considering the
legions of rural stokvels. Perm, a division of NedPerm Bank
Ltd., is the first white-owned institution to set up a
special "club account" to deal with stokvels; it has more
than 50,000 such accounts with about 100 million rand in
savings. Soon, Perm may accept club account membership as
security for loans.</p>
<p>With the purchasing power of the black majority finally
pulling even with that of the white minority (by the turn of
the century, blacks are expected to possess the greatest
share of disposable income), many white businessmen view
stokvels as their source of future growth. I&J Ltd., a
frozen-foods company, has in the past dealt with the black
market through wholesale agents. Now, it is thinking of
dealing directly with stokvels.</p>
<p>"It's a matter of pure logic and statistics," says Tim
Goudie, I&J product manager, quoting figures on purchasing
patterns and population growth, all of which favor blacks.
While handing out food samples at a recent stokvel
association fair, he whistles and shakes his head as he
thinks of the potential. "It really is a big, big market," he
says.</p>
