	<p class="article-leader">CoreStates Financial Corp. said it will close 29 branch
offices by year's end as part of its consolidation effort
after acquiring First Pennsylvania Bank.
   The Philadelphia company said most of the consolidations
would occur in the late fall. The plan envisions a network of
approximately 116 branches, operating under the First
Pennyslvania name, serving retail and commercial customers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Through consolidation of the two banks' operations,
CoreStates said about 1,200 jobs will be eliminated this
year.</p>
<p>Reiterating its promise that there would be no layoffs as
a result of the consolidation, the bank said most employees
have been placed in other jobs inside the company and 139
employees have been placed in an internal transitional
program awaiting new assignments. Of these 139 employees, 34
have accepted severance packages, 23 have already been placed
in new jobs at the company and three have taken a leave of
absence.</p>
