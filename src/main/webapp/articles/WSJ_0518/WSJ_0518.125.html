	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- After narrowing in February to its smallest
point in more than six years, the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit reversed course in March, widening by more than $2
billion to $8.45 billion, the Commerce Department reported.
   The trade balance deteriorated despite record exports of
$33.28 billion, up 4.6% from February.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A 10% jump in imports eclipsed that gain. Increases in
shipments of foreign-made cars, electrical machinery and
telecommunications equipment helped push imports to $41.72
billion, the department said.</p>
<p>The March deficit was still narrower than the $9 billion
average monthly trade gap of last year. In fact, the first
quarter deficit, $23.87 billion, was the smallest in six
years.</p>
<p>Analysts for the most part were heartened by the growth in
exports, and many dismissed the rise in imports, predicting
the slowing U.S. economy would diminish the American appetite
for foreign goods.</p>
<p>"It looks pretty good to me. I think the most encouraging
thing -- and the thing the economy needs very badly -- is the
rise in exports," said Sam Nakagama, chairman and chief
economist of Nakagama & Wallace Inc., a Wall Street advisory
firm.</p>
<p>Nearly every major category of exports posted increases in
March, including cars, scientific instruments, industrial
machinery, chemicals and agricultural commodities. Airplane
exports, which have been a big source of U.S. strength in
foreign markets recently, declined.</p>
<p>In contrast, February's big improvement in the trade
deficit, to a revised $6.10 billion, reflected a steep fall
in imports and a slip in exports. Aircraft exports were one
of the few categories that showed marked gains.</p>
<p>Overall, during the past two years, exports have grown
significantly, helped by a general decline in the value of
the dollar against foreign currencies, which made U.S. goods
cheaper abroad.</p>
<p>More recently, the sharp gains in exports have slowed.
Some economists believe they have been hurt by a climb in the
dollar, although the U.S. currency remains lower than in the
mid-1980s when the trade deficit ballooned.</p>
<p>Sung Won Sohn, chief economist of Norwest Corp. in
Minneapolis, predicted that exports will continue to improve
this year because of the vigorous economies of the country's
most important trading partners. "I think economic expansion
in Japan and Germany is pretty strong, so I think our exports
will continue to be reasonably strong," he said. "Imports
might slacken because we are seeing economic weakness here."</p>
<p>Expanding exports are particularly important now, given
signs of softness in other sectors of the economy. If exports
are strong, the country's sluggish manufacturing sector will
stay busy, despite weak demand at home. "Overall the trade
sector at this moment is perhaps the most encouraging sector
in the whole U.S. economy," Mr. Nakagama said.</p>
<p>Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher predicted the deficit
this year will register below $100 billion for the first time
since 1983. Last year it was $109 billion, down considerably
from a record $152 billion in 1987. But Willard Workman,
director of international policy and programs at the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce, said the latest trade figures "confirm
that there will be only marginal improvement in the U.S.
merchandise trade deficit for 1990."</p>
<p>"Discounting February's low figure as an aberration," he
explained, "the January and March figures indicate a 1990
deficit of about $104 billion, only a 4.6% improvement over
1980."</p>
