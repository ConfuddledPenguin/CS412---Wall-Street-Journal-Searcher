	<p class="article-leader">Chesapeake, Va. -- Dale Eggeling, who makes her living on
the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour, has some tips
for how you golfers out there might improve your games. She
says you should keep your heads down, bring your clubs back
low and slow, and have a baby.
   OK, I know that some of you, especially you men, might
have trouble following all of her advice. Nevertheless, the
36-year-old pro, a sun-tanned brunette who laughs easily,
says it is heartfelt and backed by results.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Before she gave birth to Dustin Elias E. on March 1, 1988,
Eggeling's best money-winning year in her 14 on the LPGA tour
was 1982, when she earned $57,691. But she nearly equaled
that last year, and with this year scarcely one-third gone,
she's already pocketed $67,887, including her largest single
check -- $27,750 for finishing second in the Oldsmobile LPGA
Classic in Lake Worth, Fla., in February. She's 14th on the
tour's current list, her highest position ever.</p>
<p>"People ask me what's my secret. I tell them there is none
-- it's just that I've grown up a lot these past couple
years," said Eggeling during last week's Crestar Classic
here. "Having a baby changed my whole perspective. Something
was always missing from my life, and I never knew what it
was. Now I have it.</p>
<p>"I'm more responsible and spending my time better. I'm
focused and really practicing for the first time. It's
showing up in my scores, and -- you know what? -- it actually
seems kind of easy. I should have thought of it long ago."</p>
<p>Eggeling's paean to motherhood is swelling throughout the
LPGA's ranks. Time was when moms were about as rare as
pedal-pushers in women's golf, but now quite a few players
qualify. The tour counts 17 regulars who travel with their
kids much of the time. To its "official" hairspray, shampoo,
anti-perspirant and beautician-image consultant, the LPGA has
added an official child-care provider. That's Kinder-Care
Learning Centers Inc., whose branches provide free pickup and
delivery for golfers' tots at tournament sites.</p>
<p>The tour's most illustrious mom is Nancy Lopez. An LPGA
Hall of Fame member at age 33, she has won 42 tour events, 15
of which have come after the birth of her first child in
1983. She and husband Ray Knight, the ex-baseball player,
have two children, Ashley, 6, and Erinn, almost 4.</p>
<p>Laura Baugh just gave birth to a daughter, Haley, making
her the LPGA's fertility champ among active or
soon-to-be-active players with three children. Cathy Gerring
shares with Eggeling 1990's "most-improved" title. The mother
of a 20-month-old, she has jumped from 90th on the money list
last year to 12th currently, with winnings of $78,470.</p>
<p>Needless to say, being a mom on the golf tour ain't all
baby powder and cuddles. Gerring says that sleepless nights
caused by her son Zachary's ear infections, caused her to
miss the cuts in 10 of her first 11 tournaments last year.
"When you're practicing, you feel you should be with your
children, and when you're with your children, you feel you
should be practicing," testifies Baugh.</p>
<p>It helps to have a husband in the business, or, at least,
along for the ride. Moms Baugh, Gerring, Juli Inkster and
Judy Dickinson all are married to golf pros who sometimes
accompany them on the links. Cathy Reynolds's husband, Dana
Deroux, is her caddy. Myra Blackwelder's husband, Worth, is
Inkster's caddy. How's that for a potential conflict of
interest?</p>
<p>Dale Eggeling's hubby, Mike, also is a LPGA tourist. He
travels the circuit on behalf of Taylor Made Golf, a club
maker whose products Dale uses. The two met in 1975 at the
University of South Florida, where Dale played on the women's
golf team and Mike was captain of the men's unit. He, too,
turned pro after leaving school and tried twice without
success to qualify for the PGA tour.</p>
<p>"We took stock and decided to put all our eggs in what
seemed to be our best basket, which was my career," says
Dale. "Mike's been great about it."</p>
<p>After a few lean years getting started, Eggeling has been
a steady if not spectacular performer, with average annual
winnings of about $45,000. She's won just one tourney, a l980
event in Boston, and says that it was so long ago that about
all she remembers about it was that she was ill with walking
pneumonia.</p>
<p>She notes that she had an infection that caused her right
knee to swell during her two best 1990 showings -- the second
at Lake Worth and a third place the next week at the Phar-Mor
Inverrary Classic in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., at which she
earned $21,666, and wonders if there's a connection.</p>
<p>"Lately, when Mike asks how I feel and I say `Fine,' he
says, `Too bad,'" she smiles.</p>
<p>Unlike some LPGA parents, the Tampa, Fla.-based Eggelings
don't travel by van, choosing planes and hotels even though
they're more expensive. "I enjoy having someone make up my
room," Dale notes. Mike's mother sometimes accompanies them
as a baby sitter, and they've also used take-along nannies
and commercial day care. They pitch in, too, of course.</p>
<p>"Don't let anybody kid you; no matter how much help you
have, motherhood is work," declares Dale.</p>
<p>But she goes on that less time has, for her, been more.
"Mike and I used to have a lot of `lazy time,' but we sure
don't any more, and we've had to cut back on hobbies and
social things that were distracting," she says. "Now, when
I'm at a tournament, that's where my mind is."</p>
<p>The sweetest fruit of Eggeling's new regime came in her
February finishes. She shot final rounds of 67 and 69 to tie
Pat Bradley for the 72-hole lead at the Oldsmobile before
losing in a playoff, and the next week, at the Inverrary,
started off with rounds of 69 and 68.</p>
<p>Eggeling promised to buy Dustin a gift every time she
broke 70, and admits to being hard-pressed during her streak.
"I got him an outfit after the 67 and a toy after the 69, but
the next week I gave him IOUs until we got home," she says.
"When you travel, you can't lug too much stuff."</p>
