	<p class="article-leader">As the Journal's Peter Keresztes writes nearby, there are
good reasons to doubt that Romania's elections Sunday will be
a genuine expression of popular will. (See related editorial:
"Darker Forces Behind Romania's `Front'" -- WSJ May 18, 1990)
The National Salvation Front, the main force in ousting the
Ceausescus last December and now in control of the
"transitional" government, seems to have made sufficient
arrangements to keep itself in power.
   We are great believers in the democratic process and
therefore careful about challenging anything that looks to be
a fair vote. But we also weren't born yesterday and are well
aware that communist countries have been having elections for
years, with highly predictable outcomes. You can't beat
somebody with nobody and the Front called elections early to
sharply reduce the chances for opposition parties to organize
themselves.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Front would appear to have had no organizational
problems of its own. As Mr. Keresztes reports, its leaders
seem to have been far better prepared to unseat Ceausescu
than appeared to be the case at the time, when most of the
world assumed that the uprising was spontaneous. Having
accomplished that, the Front seems also to have drawn heavily
on the Ceausescu bureaucratic, military and police
infrastructure for purposes of operating a provisional
government. So while it may have appeared that Romanians
overthrew communism, they appear to have been left with a lot
of the same people who were in places of power before the
overthrow.</p>
<p>There is a message in that for everyone who thinks that
the path of European democracy will be an easy one. After
bloody events of the type that took place in Romania in
December, it is no longer politic for a Romanian to call
himself a Communist. Similar disavowals have occurred in
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and East Germany despite more
peaceful transitions. But individuals who have held positions
of power in Communist regimes don't just disappear. Nor are
they necessarily changed overnight into democrats and
free-marketers.</p>
<p>President Violeta Chamorro in Nicaragua, for example, is
learning that even after you defeat Communists in a free
election, their adherents can still cause a lot of trouble
through strikes and obstruction of government policies.</p>
<p>We hope not, but it is possible that Romania is
experiencing the most serious manifestation of that
phenomenon that we have yet seen -- an entire government that
disavows communism but retains many of the previous
government's personnel and characteristics.</p>
<p>Romanian politics are relatively primitive, so the give
and take of democratic politics may yet have to be learned.
If so, those violent scenes that flared across the world's TV
screens last December may well be repeated.</p>
