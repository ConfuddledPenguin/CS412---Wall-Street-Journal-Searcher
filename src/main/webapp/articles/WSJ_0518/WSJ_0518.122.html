	<p class="article-leader">The Soviet Union has something that American business
schools want.
   Students.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Not that the business schools don't have enough of their
own. But as U.S. companies line up to enter the huge Soviet
market and business schools themselves try to take on more of
an international flavor, Soviet students are becoming a hot
commodity.</p>
<p>Programs for Soviet students, faculty and managers are
sprouting on business school campuses from Harvard to Pacific
Lutheran. Business school professors jet to Moscow
prospecting for candidates. Deans swap tips on everything
from post-perestroika telecommunications to reference
checking in Siberia.</p>
<p>"Everyone is into this business," says Ben Burdetsky, dean
of the business school at George Washington University, which
is sponsoring a two-year program starting this fall for 20
Soviet managers. "The minute we announced the program, our
phone {began} ringing off the hook, and people have been
dropping in from all over."</p>
<p>Interest is high on the Soviet side. Would-be students
eager to gain knowledge, to improve their standing in their
own country -- or simply to travel to the U.S. -- are
scrambling to be considered for programs. Since Northeastern
University ran a 15-week session for 16 Soviet managers last
year, it has been besieged with requests for more programs,
says David Boyd, dean. Four Soviet delegations have visited
the Boston campus, and three Soviet universities have asked
to develop joint programs.</p>
<p>Says Mr. Burdetsky of George Washington: "If you go to the
U.S.S.R., you will get more proposals than you can handle."</p>
<p>American business school deans say these programs help the
schools develop contacts in the Soviet Union and make it
easier to send American students there. They say the programs
also give U.S. students valuable exposure to their Soviet
peers and deepen their understanding of the Soviet economy.</p>
<p>Moreover, an almost messianic zeal fuels some programs.
Many "think they are contributing to world peace" by helping
educate Soviet managers, says Thomas Keller, dean of Duke
University's Fuqua School of Business. "I've heard them say
it often enough." Last fall, J.B. Fuqua, senior chairman of
Fuqua Industries Inc., gave $4 million to the school, which
is named for him, to support management programs for Soviet
students.</p>
<p>But not everyone is enthusiastic. The programs are
expensive and complicated to set up. The U.S. side often
winds up footing most of the bill, and on the Soviet side,
companies that help to arrange educational exchanges often
profit.</p>
<p>What's more, some educators question the value of rushing
in while the Soviet economy and political situation are still
in turmoil. "Money is a scarce resource, and it's too early"
to spend much of it on Soviet programs, says Roy Herberger
Jr., president of the American Graduate School of
International Management, Glendale, Ariz. "You could put a
lot of money in and get caught flat-footed." The school,
known as Thunderbird, has a five-person exchange program with
the Soviet Union that Mr. Herberger calls "a resume stuffer."</p>
<p>Programs for Soviets range from minimalist to elaborate.
Harvard's business school simply admitted four students to
its regular M.B.A. program; its only extra effort was sending
a dean to Moscow to interview applicants. "Our idea was to do
this in the same way other M.B.A.s were admitted," says a
spokesman.</p>
<p>George Washington University, on the other hand, spent a
year and over $65,000 preparing a specialized program for 20
Soviet managers. The program, to start this fall, includes
intensive English training, cultural immersion and an
internship with an American company.</p>
<p>Most of the programs aim to give the Soviet participants a
working knowledge of a free-market economy. Last fall, 22
Soviets spent three weeks at Wake Forest University in
Winston-Salem, N.C., hearing -- via translation -- lectures
on accounting, operations, marketing, organizational behavior
and strategy.</p>
<p>"The thing they liked least was financial management,"
says J. Kendall Middaugh, an associate professor at Wake
Forest's Babcock school of management. At home, "they aren't
accountable for profit or cost, so they found it tedious and
of little relevance." Others found the Soviets craved even
more basic stuff: "They asked for Samuelson's `Economics,'"
says Mr. Burdetsky, referring to the introductory economics
text.</p>
<p>Many Soviet students also function as business emissaries
of their ministries or companies. "As soon as they got off
the plane, they started making deals," Mr. Middaugh says. For
instance, he says the director of a glass factory in
Leningrad got a lead while at Wake Forest that led to a joint
venture with a Canadian company.</p>
<p>U.S. schools say the programs pay off in public relations
and international exposure. "In business schools today, you
have to run just to stand still," says Mr. Boyd, the
Northeastern dean. "An innovative program . . . has a ripple
effect" on a school and how people perceive it.</p>
<p>Soviet students yield great publicity. Wake Forest's Mr.
Middaugh says, "We had a three-page spread in Fortune
magazine, we got 20 minutes {on a major Canadian news
program} and a guy flew in from the largest-circulation
newspaper in South America and gave us a full page."</p>
<p>But Mr. Keller, dean of Duke's Fuqua School, cautions that
some less-than-ideal students -- possibly ranging from spies
to party officials along for the ride -- may slip in. "We
suspect there may be people who may not be legitimate
managers," he says, looking ahead to a monthlong program
starting in August for 30 Soviet managers. "We hope they
won't disrupt the educational process."</p>
<p>Andrey Manoukovsky, director of the International Business
School in Moscow, concedes: "We have corruption all over, and
in this field as well."</p>
<p>Fuqua has contingency plans for defectors: Turn them over
to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI and the
Central Intelligence Agency already have checked the campus
for security risks.</p>
<p>Some universities have been criticized for spending on
Soviet education while other projects languish. "There are
things people have been fighting for for several years," says
Wake Forest's Mr. Middaugh, but the program for Soviet
visitors quickly won over $50,000 in funding. The cost "is a
valid concern," he says, noting that the school has since
turned its attention to "less broad-scale, more limited
programs."</p>
<p>In some cases, the Soviets have paid hard currency for all
their expenses. But often the U.S. side has covered most
costs. Fuqua will pay for all Soviet expenses in the U.S.,
"including medical insurance," says Mr. Keller, the dean. The
Pacific Lutheran University exchange program is subsidized by
the U.S. Information Agency. For the program at Wake Forest,
the local community donated about $25,000 of goods and
services, from meals to new vans.</p>
<p>Sometimes the U.S. hosts subsidize more than they intend.
At Wake Forest last fall, some Soviet managers hoarded the
$425 stipend the school gave each for meals and incidentals
during their stay, using the money instead to buy toys and
personal computers.</p>
<p>Some Soviets have quickly assimilated lessons in
international business. Leonid Evenko, president and chief
executive of Amscort International, a Soviet-American joint
venture, says one company he worked for that arranged
educational exchanges invested its profits from the programs
in making videocassette recorders in the Soviet Union for a
return of "20 to 1 -- or something like that."</p>
<p>"If you have dollars," he says, "you are winning."</p>
