	<p class="article-leader">SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California's timber industry, facing
two ballot initiatives to restrict clear-cutting, turned in
enough signatures to qualify its own initiative for the
November ballot.
   The proposed measure, backed by the Timber Association of
California and numerous industry groups, is dubbed the
"Global Warming, Clear Cut Reduction, Wildlife Protection and
Reforestation Act of 1990." It would limit clear-cutting of
virgin redwood forests, reduce clear-cutting in other forests
and authorize $300 million in bonds to finance reforestation
projects in urban areas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Enviromentalists quickly ridiculed the proposition as "Big
Stump" and charged that it is an industry smokescreen to
deflect voter support away from more sweeping reforms
proposed by the state's conservation community. Timber
industry officials say the most sweeping of the
conservationists' initiatives will cost the state and local
governments about $420 million annually.</p>
<p>A timber association spokesman said petitions submitted to
the California secretary of state office contained about
700,000 signatures, double the number necessary to get on the
ballot.</p>
