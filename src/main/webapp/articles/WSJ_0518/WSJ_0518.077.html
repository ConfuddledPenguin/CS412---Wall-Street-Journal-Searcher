	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stocks resumed their latest rally, sending the
Dow Jones Industrial Average to another all-time high.
   Pinnacle West climbed 28%, or 3 5/8, to 16 3/8 after
acknowledging that tireless PacifiCorp had presented it with
yet another acquisition proposal. Pinnacle has rejected three
previous PacifiCorp merger proposals in the past seven
months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Eric T. Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette, says the Pinnacle story is an illustration
that corporate buying is still the most important source of
demand for stock, whether it be through mergers, share
repurchases or the occasional leveraged buy-out.</p>
<p>Pinnacle's news came against a backdrop of rising stock
prices as the market shrugged off a wider-than-expected trade
deficit for March, reported before the opening.</p>
<p>Computer-driven buy programs spurred the industrial
average up 25 points before it settled back down to a gain of
12.03 points for the day, ending at 2831.71, a new closing
high for the index.</p>
<p>Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index added 0.47 to 354.47,
while the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.35
to 193.49.</p>
<p>Big Board volume totaled 164,770,000 shares, up from
Wednesday's 159,810,000 shares. Advancers led decliners, 832
to 649.</p>
<p>Donaldson Lufkin's Mr. Miller said the momentum may carry
over today. Others said, however, that May stock options and
future contracts expire today, leaving the market vulnerable
to unexpected swings.</p>
<p>The next big psychological hurdle for equity investors
won't come until early June, when the Labor Department
releases data on the nation's May employment.</p>
<p>The numbers are likely to clarify the economic picture
that was clouded by seasonal factors earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Alcan Aluminium led the most active list, down 1/8 at 21
1/8 on volume of 5.3 million shares in apparent
dividend-related trading. The stock, which went ex-dividend
on Monday, led the most active list Wednesday on volume of
more than nine million shares.</p>
<p>Traders said Texas Utilities was also high on the active
list because of trading tied to its dividend. The stock,
which carries an 8% dividend yield, goes ex-dividend May 29.
It rose 1/4 to 36 7/8 on volume of more than 2.2 million
shares. More than two million shares of the stock changed
hands Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sotheby's Holdings was also high on the list with a 1/4
point gain to 18 7/8. The company held a huge auction of
impressionist and modern paintings last night.</p>
<p>Safecard Services soared 1 to 8 3/4, a new 52-week high on
heavy volume after Wertheim Schroder recommended the stock.</p>
<p>Philip Morris was active, easing 1/8 to 44 3/8. The
company's German subsidiary has agreed to acquire a cigarette
plant in East Germany, according to a report by the East
German news service ADN. Terms weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>Trading in American Stores closed at 69, up 3 1/2 after a
delayed opening. The company has agreed to sell most of its
Alpha Beta stores, ending a 1 1/2 year antitrust battle with
the state of California over American Stores's $2.5 billion
acquisition of Lucky Stores. American Stores will continue to
operate Lucky but will sell 152 of Alpha Beta's 175 stores in
Southern California within the next five years.</p>
<p>National Westminster Bank added 1 1/8 to 33 5/8. The U.K.
clearing bank is in "exclusive discussions" to buy Europeenne
de Banque from Credit Commercial de France, according to the
Financial Times. The acquisition, if completed, would more
than double NatWest's network in France, where its presence
has lagged behind Barclays and Midland.</p>
<p>Federal National Mortgage Association added 5/8 to 38 3/4.
An important measure of the association's profitability
widened in April, suggesting that the company's profits got
off to a good start in the second quarter.</p>
<p>SmithKline Beecham's American depositary receipts gained 1
1/2 to 41 3/4. Prudential-Bache Securities upgraded its
rating on the stock to a "buy" from a "hold," according to
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>Shares of Digital Equipment Corp. slid 1, or 1.8%, to 87
3/8. Traders said the computer company's shares fell because
a trade magazine reported that shipments of Digital's new
VAX-9000 mainframe computer could be delayed a month or more.
A Digital Equipment spokesman acknowledged some delay in the
shipping schedule for the company's VAX-9000 but said it
would have "no revenue impact." Dallas Kirk, director of
public relations, said "the schedule has shifted somewhat,
but it's nothing significant." He also said orders for the
9000 "have been great."</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard continued to slide, losing 3/4 to 45 3/8
after dropping 1 7/8 Wednesday. The company's executives were
said to have taken a "cautious" tone in a conference call
with analysts after the release of fiscal second-quarter
results Wednesday, said the investor report. It said several
analysts lowered their 1990 earnings estimates over concern
about Hewlett's shift toward selling more lower-margin
products.</p>
<p>New Jersey-based First Fidelity Bancorp. jumped 1 7/8 to
19 1/2. The company announced it will pay a reduced quarterly
dividend of 30 cents a share due to an expected loan-loss
provision in the second quarter of as much as $300 million.
The company said its internal loan portfolio review is near
completion.</p>
<p>Shareholders of HomeFed had a different reaction to news
of a rise in nonperforming assets at HomeFed Bank. HomeFed
fell 2 to 30 after reporting that nonperforming assets rose
10% in April.</p>
<p>Westpac Banking slid 1 5/8 to 18 5/8. The company reported
that its six-month operating profit fell 8% from a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Tucson Electric Power fell 1/8 to 10 7/8. The company
raised the possibility that it might be forced to seek
bankruptcy-law protection from its creditors if various
financing plans aren't successful, The Wall Street Journal
reported.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 1.26
to 354.94. Volume totaled 13,760,000 shares compared with
12,190,000 Wednesday.</p>
