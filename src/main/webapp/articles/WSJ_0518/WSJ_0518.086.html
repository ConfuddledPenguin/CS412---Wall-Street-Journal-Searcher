	<h3>Index Funds Emerge as Hot Turf of 1990 --- Marketing Efforts Target Individuals</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Just as money-market funds were the hot
product in 1989, so stock-index funds are quickly becoming
the scene of this year's biggest mutual-fund marketing
battle.
   Following the stellar performance of Vanguard Group's
index funds, both Dreyfus Corp. and Fidelity Investments have
weighed in with index funds of their own. In recent weeks,
both funds groups have come out with unmanaged portfolios of
the stocks that make up the Standard & Poor's 500-stock
index; these funds are designed to closely track the S&P
500's performance.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Small investors are just waking up to the virtues of index
investments, which have already attracted about $250 billion
from giant institutions. The oldest and largest of the index
mutual funds, Vanguard's Index Trust-500 Portfolio, notched
up an annualized total return of 17% in the 1980s, putting it
in the top quarter of all stock mutual funds. At the same
time, the average stock fund returned just 15.5% a year.</p>
<p>As reported here earlier this year, the investment success
of Vanguard's index funds was long ignored by Vanguard's
competitors. Not any more. Both Dreyfus and Fidelity are now
running full page advertisements as they seek to wrestle a
share of the index-fund business away from Vanguard.</p>
<p>"As far as a mutual-fund manager is concerned, an index
fund is a magical product," says one analyst. "It already has
a performance record -- that of the index. I'm hard pressed
to figure out why they didn't bring these funds out earlier."</p>
<p>Though it's still early, it seems that Dreyfus's and
Fidelity's index funds are proving a tough sell even though
they are holding down fees. So far, Dreyfus's Peoples Index
Fund has assets of just $3.3 million (including $3 million of
the company's own seed capital). And Fidelity's Spartan
Market Index Fund has $16 million (including $4 million in
seed capital).</p>
<p>If Dreyfus and Fidelity thought that this year's index
funds would match the popularity of last year's money-market
funds, they have clearly been disappointed. Early in 1989,
both Dreyfus and Fidelity brought out low-cost, money-market
funds, jumping into an area previously dominated by Vanguard.
Dreyfus's Worldwide Dollar Fund has since pulled in $7.3
billion. Fidelity's Spartan Money Market Fund has snagged
$8.3 billion.</p>
<p>"They are jumping onto the index fund bandwagon, and
they're trying to get some attention by waiving the fees,"
says John Bogle, Vanguard's chairman. "Fees are the only
thing that distinguishes one money-market fund from another.
When you get to an index fund, fees are just one of the
things that affect return. Only a moron would buy a stock
fund to avoid a 0.5% expense ratio for two weeks or two
months. Apparently the market place is smarter than the fund
sponsors."</p>
<p>Dreyfus Chairman Howard Stein concedes that the Peoples
Index Fund may not be the immediate success that the
Worldwide Dollar Fund was. "Yes, there is an education
problem," he says. "Yes, it will take time." A spokesman for
Dreyfus notes that while the fund group has been advertising
the Peoples Index Fund for some time, prospectuses only
became available on May 4.</p>
<p>For years, Vanguard has had a virtual stranglehold on the
index-fund market. It offers index funds that track a
bond-market index, two international stock indexes and two
small-company stock indexes. But its biggest winner has been
the 500 Portfolio, which now has assets of $2.2 billion and
so far this year has been the fund group's best selling stock
fund.</p>
<p>As with its other funds, Vanguard's edge in the index-fund
business comes from its extremely low annual-expense ratios.
The 500 Portfolio charges just 0.2% of assets annually, well
below the 1.5% typically charged by an actively managed stock
fund.</p>
<p>To compete, both Dreyfus and Fidelity are holding down
expenses on their index funds. Dreyfus is absorbing all
expenses until the end of the year or until the fund hits
$100 million in assets, whichever comes first. Fidelity has
promised to keep its expenses at 0.28% of assets until May 1,
1991.</p>

<p>After years of being ignored by the fund industry, index
funds are starting to proliferate. Here are some of the
