	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- In a battle over how the market for Belgian
government bonds should be structured, major banks have
ordered Reuters Ltd. to cut off access of Belgian
stockbrokers to electronic pages quoting their local bond
prices.
   Reuters -- a unit of Reuters Holdings PLC -- and several
banks confirmed yesterday that the measure would be effective
today, the day Belgium's stock market is scheduled to begin a
new, automated bond trading system available only to
stockbrokers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The system, known in shorthand as Obli-CATS, would enable
stockbrokers to trade bonds on the bourse's computerized
trading network.</p>
<p>Banks are protesting the new system. A handful of
commercial banks conduct the bulk of trading in Belgian
government bonds in off-bourse transactions. Several act
effectively as market-makers for the bonds.</p>
<p>Under current Belgian law, however, the banks aren't
allowed to participate directly in the Belgian stock market.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Reuters, meanwhile, said the company
"regrets this situation, which has arisen from a dispute
among customers."</p>
<p>The spokesman said the Reuters was implementing the banks'
requests by putting Belgian stockbrokers on "selective
access" to Reuters monitors.</p>
