	<p class="article-leader">At the outset of his April 13 Potomac Watch column, Paul
A. Gigot acknowledges that the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) is a job "that sounds obscure but
has real power." On this point, his analysis is impeccable.
Indeed, I have long believed that OIRA and more generally the
Office of Management and Budget, of which OIRA is a part,
hold a position of power perhaps second only to the
president's. I dare say this fact is not fully appreciated
"outside the Beltway."
   But Mr. Gigot significantly errs in the remainder of his
piece. He asserts that I am "pushing legislation that would
strip {OIRA} of much of its power." The OIRA bill, authored
by Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D., N.M.), is currently before the
Committee on Governmental Affairs, which I chair, and would
provide for the funding of OIRA through the reauthorization
of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bill, according to Mr. Gigot, "would in effect cancel
{OIRA's} current power to review paperwork demands every
three years." Nothing could be further from the truth. The
bill contains language that provides for OIRA to cancel
automatically a federal agency's information-collection
authority at the end of three years, unless the agency seeks
renewal for that authority from OIRA. I made changes to the
bill that would make this "sunset" provision more explicit,
including a clarification that it covers all such
information-collection authority, i.e., whether engendered by
a regulation or not.</p>
<p>I have sought to keep OIRA intact, indeed to make it more
effective. But at the same time, have I attempted to make
sure that this "regulation cop" walks his beat out in the
open? You bet I have. I strongly believe there is a need for
a single entity to coordinate and manage the executive
branch's making of regulatory policy in line with statutes as
they are passed by Congress and signed into law by the
president. Like other areas of government, regulatory
initiatives often overlap with or work at cross purposes to
one another, with the result being diminished American
international economic competitiveness, endangered public
health and safety, or other consequences.</p>
<p>But in exchange for bestowing on OIRA this type of
powerful franchise, OIRA's actions, like those of a utility,
must be publicly accountable. Accordingly, the bill provides
for greater "sunshine" over OIRA's activities. Importantly,
by the same token, I have made changes to the bill that will
cast greater "sunshine" over regulatory agencies' activities
as well.</p>
<p>Apparently Mr. Gigot, and possibly others, believes that
greater public accountability will "gut" OIRA. I believe that
not only is public accountability required to make OIRA more
effective, but also that it is the proper system of
governance.</p>
