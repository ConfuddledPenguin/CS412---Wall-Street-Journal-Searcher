	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- U.S. bond prices gyrated yesterday, rising on
speculation that the Federal Reserve was on the verge of
lowering interest rates then falling when it became apparent
that Fed credit policy was unchanged.
   The story overseas was far different as prices of British
government bonds, called gilts, surged in the biggest bond
market rally in 2 1/2 years. Some long-term gilts rose as
much as three points, or #30 ($50.79) for a gilt with a
#1,000 face amount.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The surge in gilts helped lift other European bond markets
but had little effect on the U.S. market, where prices ended
modestly lower.</p>
<p>In early U.S. trading, the Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond rose 1/4 point. The buying began when investors
interpreted a decline in the federal funds rate as a sign
that the Fed was ready to push interest rates lower. The
funds rate, which banks charge each other on overnight loans,
slipped to 8 1/8%, which is below the Fed's target level of 8
1/4%. The rate is closely watched by market participants
because the Fed often uses it to signal changes in the
direction of interest rates.</p>
<p>But hopes of a Fed easing were dashed when the central
bank drained reserves from the banking system by executing
overnight matched sale-purchase agreements, a technical
trading procedure.</p>
<p>The open market operation "was a statement that the Fed
hadn't changed policy," said Joel Kazis, manager of
government trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "That
took the wind out of the market," he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Philadelphia Fed President Edward G. Boehne
told a group of retired bankers that the Fed hasn't changed
monetary policy since right before Christmas, when members of
the Federal Open Market Committee voted to ease the funds
rate to 8 1/4%.</p>
<p>Mr. Boehne's comment strongly suggested that the Fed took
no action on rates at Tuesday's committee meeting.</p>
<p>Analysts and traders now believe the bond market has
settled into a holding pattern, where it is likely to remain
until the Labor Department releases the May employment report
in two weeks.</p>
<p>Britain's bond market rally was triggered by reports that
the country might be on the verge of joining the exchange
rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, the agreement
for stabilizing European Community currencies.</p>
<p>In yesterday's edition of this newspaper, Chancellor of
the Exchequer John Major said Britain is intent on entering
the agreement. The statement was considered positive for the
bond market because it suggests that the British government
will move swiftly to reduce inflation.</p>
<p>"London wants to be the European Community's financial
center, but right now it appears that West Germany" has that
distinction, said Francis H. Schott, senior vice president
and chief economist at Equitable Financial Cos. To become a
major financial center, some analysts believe that Britain
must become a member of the European Monetary System. But to
do so, "the British will have to adjust inflationary habits
to those of the other Common Market members, and that means
inflation must come down," said Mr. Schott. Lower inflation
should lead to lower interest rates and higher bond prices.</p>
<p>Britain's inflation rate has ranged between 7% and 10% in
recent years and was at an annual rate of 9.4% in April.</p>
<p>The gilt market was also supported by a labor report that
said unemployment rose in April for the first time since
1986.</p>
<p>Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% Treasury bond was quoted late
at 100 18/32, up 2 3/8 points, to yield 11.66%.</p>
<p>Yesterday's rally capped a steady climb in the market that
has pushed yields one percentage point lower in one month.
However, some analysts are skeptical about any near-term
entry of the pound into the exchange rate mechanism and
believe the recent rally has been overdone.</p>
<p>"Unless we do enter the ERM shortly, the gilts market is
going to resemble one of those cartoon characters who has run
off the edge of a cliff and suddenly realizes there's nothing
holding him up," said economist Mark Franklin of Credit
Suisse First Boston Ltd.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>For the second time in a month, a foreign unit of a U.S.
company raised money in the U.S. rather than the Eurobond
market because of lower U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>Dow Capital BV, the Dutch-based finance unit of Dow
Chemical Co., made its debut in the U.S. market with a $150
million offering of 20-year debentures.</p>
<p>"With the drop in rates that has happened in the last week
to 10 days, it appeared to be advantageous to issue today,"
said Myk Fenstermacher, financial manager at Dow Chemical.
"We feel there was a slight advantage to do it here, in terms
of cost as well as ease of issuance."</p>
<p>Although Dow Capital BV has tapped the medium-term note
market before, the new debt sale represented the first time
the finance unit has offered debt in the underwritten public
debt market.</p>
<p>Also in the corporate debt market was Asian Development
Bank, which sold $300 million of 10-year notes priced to
yield 9.25%. An official at lead underwriter Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. said the securities were primarily purchased by
domestic money managers. The Triple-A-rated bank is one of a
number of Yankee issuers that taps the U.S. credit markets
periodically. Yankee issuers are foreign entities that sell
dollar-denominated securities in the U.S. debt market.</p>
<p>In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate
debt, prices of widely quoted issues finished 1/8 point
lower.</p>
<p>The junk bond market continued to show strength, but
activity in the $200 billion high-yield sector was muted.
Overall, speculative-grade securities with low credit ratings
or no credit ratings, advanced about 1/4 point.</p>
<p>Among the gainers were zero-coupon bonds of Hospital Corp.
of America, which rose one point to end at 70, and
Owens-Illinois Inc.'s 12 3/4% subordinated debentures, which
added one point to end at 91.</p>
<p>Also higher were junk bonds of Ralphs Grocery Co., a
healthy unit of Toronto-based Campeau Corp. Ralphs' 14%
senior subordinated debentures, maturing in 2000, finished at
86 1/4, up 1/4.</p>
<p>Shortly after Campeau's two U.S. retailing units,
Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp.
filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law, Ralphs bonds tumbled on fears that the
company would end up having to pay for Campeau's problems.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities ended narrowly mixed but fared better
than the Treasury market amid continued demand for derivative
mortgage-backed offerings.</p>
<p>Goldman, Sachs & Co. issued two separate $300 million real
estate mortgage investment conduits backed by Government
National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities, and other
deals are rumored.</p>
<p>Ginnie Mae 9% securities for June delivery ended at 95
17/32, down 1/32; 9 1/2% securities were at 97 31/32, up
1/32; 10% securities were at 100 15/32, up 2/32; and Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 1/2% securities were at 97 15/32,
down 1/32.</p>
<p>The Ginnie Mae 9% issue was yielding 9.78% to a 12-year
average life assumption, as the spread above the Treasury
10-year note narrowed 0.02 percentage point to 1.10.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Following the lead of Treasurys, tax-exempt issues were
off 1/8 to 1/4 point in very light trading.</p>
<p>Traders reported that about $100 million worth of bonds on
sell lists traded during the session.</p>
<p>In new-issue activity, an issue of $85.1 million of Nassau
County, N.Y., various purpose revenue bonds was won by a
Prudential-Bache Capital Funding group.</p>
<p>Among actively traded bonds, New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was 1/8 lower at 97 7/8 bid
to yield 7.37%.</p>
<p>No large municipal issues are expected to be priced today.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury prices ended lower after a day of seesaw trading.
The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 101, down 6/32
from 101 6/32 on Wednesday. The issue's yield, which moves in
the opposite direction from its price, rose to 8.64% from
8.63%. The latest 10-year notes were also lower, with prices
falling to about 101 5/32 to yield 8.68%, compared with 101
9/32 to yield 8.66%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were higher. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills was quoted late at 7.69% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.93%, while the rate on six-month
Treasury bills rose to 7.70% for a yield of 8.10%.</p>
<p>In when-issued trading activity, the two-year notes
scheduled to be auctioned by the Treasury on Wednesday were
quoted late yesterday at a yield of 8.58%. Five-year notes,
which will be sold on Thursday, were quoted at a yield of
8.64%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Britain's powerful bond rally was the major focus of most
European trading. The price of Britain's benchmark long-term
government bond jumped 2 3/8 points.</p>
<p>The bullish sentiment in the British bond market spilled
over to West Germany, where the price of the benchmark
10-year government bond rose 0.38 point to 94.33 to yield
8.62%.</p>
<p>The West German market also was supported by news that the
federal government is forecasting an extra 8.2 billion marks
($4.98 billion) in tax revenue this year.</p>
<p>In Japan, government bonds ended weaker because of a
slight drop in the value of the yen.</p>
