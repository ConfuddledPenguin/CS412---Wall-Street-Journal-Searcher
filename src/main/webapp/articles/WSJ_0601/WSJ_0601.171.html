	<p class="article-leader">New York -- "Smoke on the Mountain" and "Forever Plaid,"
two new musical comedies playing off-Broadway, employ the
same happy formula for success: String together a couple of
dozen snazzy songs from a neglected niche of Americana, add a
skeletal plot and a handful of engaging characters. In each
case, the result is finger-snapping, laugh-out-loud fun.
   The more substantial of the two is "Smoke on the
Mountain," which tells the story of the Sanctified Sanders
Singers, a family country gospel choir that's making its
comeback at the first ever Saturday night sing at the Baptist
church in Mount Pleasant, N.C. The time is June 1938.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There are 21 rousing numbers: old hymnal standards ("The
Church in the Wildwood" and "Bringing in the Sheaves");
country schlock ("Christian Cowboy" and "I'm Using My Bible
for a Roadmap"); and sweet ballads ("Meet Mother in the
Skies" and "Everyone Home But Me"). The seven cast members
accompany themselves on two dozen instruments both ordinary
-- banjo, piano, guitar -- and kitchen variety -- oatmeal
box, wooden spoons, washboard.</p>
<p>In between songs, the family "witnesses." Pa Sanders
(Reathel Bean) recounts his skirmish with the devil over
whether to sell beer at his grocerette. Pa's ne'er-do-well
brother Stanley (Dan Manning) tells about his sinful fondness
for liquor. And Ma (Linda Kerns), a bit too sanctimonious for
her own good, launches into Bible-quoting competitions with
the family's host, the earnest Rev. Mervin Oglethorpe (Kevin
Chamberlin). Then there are the three nearly grown children.
Timid Dennis (Robert Olsen), who wants to be a preacher,
practices his sermons on his dog. The family firebrand,
Denise (Jane Potter), announces that there's nothing wrong
with Christians watching movies not made by Disney. The
eldest, June (Connie Ray, who's also the author), can't sing
but spreads the Good Word by translating her family's songs
into sign language.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"Forever Plaid" is more loosely organized than "Smoke on
the Mountain" and is much more of a variation on "Name That
Tune." The tunes are the mawkish pop hits of the late '50s
and early '60s ("Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing," "Three
Coins in the Fountain," "Heart and Soul"). They are sung in
unctuous, overweening harmony by "The Four Plaids," four
boy-next-door types who specialize in high school proms and
airport hotel lounges.</p>
<p>The quartet are graduates of the "Osterizer school of
harmonic theory." They have names like Sparky and Jinx and
say things like "holy cannolli." They wear boss red plaid
dinner jackets with matching cummerbunds and bow ties. Perry
Como is their hero.</p>
<p>As the Four Plaids, Stan Chandler, David Engel, Jason
Graae and Guy Stroman are adorable teen angels. They also are
delicious hams, and accompany their crooning with hilarious
bits of business as they try their amateurish best to be
suave.</p>
<p>One of the funniest numbers is the early Beatles hit -- "I
Wanna Hold Your Hand," which, in their saccharine rendition,
becomes, "I Want to Hold Your Hand, Yes Sirree Bob." Another
is a spoof of "The Ed Sullivan Show," the Sunday-night
television staple 30 years ago. In a frenetic three minutes
and 11 seconds, they parody one of Ed's really big shows,
playing such guests as clapping seals, acrobats, jugglers,
fire eaters, Charlie McCarthy and Edgar Bergen, and the
Mexican mouse who always begged Ed for a good-night kiss.</p>
<p>Off-Broadway theaters aren't normally notable for the
refreshments they offer at intermission. About the best you
usually can hope for is a cup of coffee and a day-old cookie
wrapped in cellophane. But both "Forever Plaid" and "Smoke on
the Mountain" are unique in this respect. "Forever Plaid" is
playing at Steve McGraw's, an Upper West Side bistro that
offers a dinner-theater package, a staple of the suburbs, but
not common in Manhattan. Over at Lamb's Theater, where "Smoke
on the Mountain" is playing, intermission brings the
atmosphere of a church social. Ethel and Harold Bakewell,
imported from Danville, Ohio, sell homemade sweet potato and
chess pies and peach cobbler and tell you to help yourselves
to coffee or lemonade.</p>
<p>A word about Lamb's Theatre: A national historical
landmark, it was built at the turn of the century in the
neo-Georgian style and used as a club until 1975, when it was
bought by the Manhattan Church of the Nazarene. Besides
operating two theaters there, the church uses the building
for worship and for social services for the needy of the
Times Square area.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Ensemble Studio Theatre's annual marathon of one-act
plays is in full swing. A dozen plays -- culled from more
than 1,000 submissions -- are divided among three series,
running through June 17 and including offerings by David
Mamet, Joyce Carol Oates and John Ford Noonan.</p>
<p>My favorite on the current bill, which ends Sunday, is
Shel Silverstein's "Hamlet." It's a merry monologue in verse
delivered by a jive-talking, middle-aged black man (Melvin
Van Peebles), who, with a cigar as his only prop, gleefully
recounts the tragic tale.</p>
<p>In Mr. Silverstein's marvelous invention, the ghost of
Hamlet's father wears a tattoo that says "Gertrude Forever,"
and the adulterous queen herself has cellulite and varicose
veins and is going through a midlife crisis. The actor who's
putting on the play within the play demands limo service and
his name above the title. Hamlet's beloved Ophelia is a sassy
social climber who brags she has "got the dude writin' poetry
and talkin' 'bout the moon." Fortinbras sums it all up when
he comes in just before the final curtain and surveys the
bloody scene: "You got a punctured king and a poisoned
queen/And a dead sweet prince on the mezzanine."</p>
<p>Yes, Shakespeare speaks a universal tongue.</p>
