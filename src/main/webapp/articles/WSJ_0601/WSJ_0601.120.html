	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Corp. said it will buy
back as many as 20 million common shares, or roughly 7% of
its shares outstanding in the next 12 to 18 months.
   The broadcasting, financial services and power generation
concern also said directors voted to exempt Westinghouse from
the protection of Pennsylvania's anti-takeover law that went
into effect on April 27. The move apparently is aimed at
making Westinghouse stock more attractive to institutional
investors even though the large company isn't considered a
likely takeover target.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, Westinghouse said it sold its combustion
control business to Rosemount Analytical Inc., of
Minneapolis. Terms weren't disclosed. Rosemount is a unit of
Emerson Electric Co., of St. Louis, Mo., a maker of
measurement, control, analytical and valve products.</p>
<p>Westinghouse also said it is part of a consortium that was
awarded a $358 million contract to build a coal-fired power
generating unit for Old Dominion Electric Cooperative and
Virgina Power. Other members of the consortium are Combustion
Engineering Inc., H.B. Zachry Co. and Black & Veatch
Engineers-Architects.</p>
<p>The contract calls for a 393-megawatt pulverized coal unit
to be built at the Clover Power Station in Halifax County,
Va.</p>
<p>Westinghouse stock rose $1.375 to close at $38.375 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Analysts who follow the company said the announced
buy-back of more than $700 million of stock all but ends
speculation that Westinghouse might want to launch a bid for
Sundstrand Corp., an aerospace-parts concern based in
Rockford, Ill.</p>
<p>Westinghouse's top officials have declined to comment
specifically on the Sundstrand rumor. But in a story in this
newspaper earlier this week, the officials cast doubt on
whether Westinghouse would undertake a more than $2 billion
acquisition that would dilute earnings.</p>
<p>Sundstrand on Wednesday tumbled $4.25. Yesterday the stock
closed at $74, down 12.5 cents in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Westinghouse said it considers its stock an attractive
investment. Initial funding for the buy-back will come from
existing cash, internally generated funds or through the
issuance of short-term debt.</p>
<p>Separately, the company said it is negotiating a contract
to build and operate a waste-to-energy plant in Waukesha,
Wis.</p>
<p>The plant will process as many as 600 tons of municipal
solid waste daily to fuel a 20-megawatt power plant. Power
from the plant will be sold to Wisconsin Electric Power Co.
Construction will begin next year with commercial operation
scheduled to begin in early 1994.</p>
<p>Waukesha County will finance the plant with project
revenue bonds, Westinghouse said.</p>
