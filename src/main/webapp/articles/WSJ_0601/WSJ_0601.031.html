	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks finished higher in active trading, as
investors dismissed evidence of the yen weakening and
demonstrated faith in the market's ability to recover,
observers said.
   Meanwhile, London stocks bounced back from their
midafternoon lows to end moderate trading broadly unchanged.
Dealers attributed the recovery purely to Wall Street's
reversal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 204.54 points to
33130.80 yesterday, after rising 108.59 points Wednesday.</p>
<p>In early trading Friday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index fell
74.24 points to 33056.56.</p>
<p>Thursday's volume on the first section was estimated at
800 million shares, off slightly from Wednesday. Advancers
outnumbered decliners 612 to 346, while 160 issues were
unchanged.</p>
<p>According to Mahmoud Ghaemmaghami, manager of research and
a portfolio adviser at WestLB Securities Pacific Ltd.,
forecasts for the market, as well as for the yen, remain
strong.</p>
<p>"This recovery should continue; not judging by the
Nikkei-Dow alone . . . but looking at the whole market," he
said.</p>
<p>Indeed, the overall market's strength was evident in
healthy progress on both the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all
issues listed in the first section and the second section
index.</p>
<p>The Topix advanced 18.65 points, or 0.77%, to 2435.74,
while the second section index gained 35.96 points, or 0.92%,
to 3938.28. The second section index has fallen only two days
since April 26. Volume on the second section was estimated at
17.8 million shares, up from 14.5 million shares.</p>
<p>Despite a strengthening of the dollar over the yen
yesterday, investors apparently are confident that the yen is
on a firming trend, observers said.</p>
<p>Much of the dollar's gains have been interpreted as a move
out of Deutsche marks, equity traders said.</p>
<p>"The dollar has been stronger for the past few days
because of Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev's meetings over arms
cuts," WestLB's Mr. Ghaemmaghami said. "I think this is kind
of a temporary reaction, and the yen should strengthen over
the next couple of weeks."</p>
<p>Various undervalued sectors -- including shipping,
warehouse, railways, oil and real estate -- firmed as
investors were driven by faith in the market's fundamentals,
participants suggested.</p>
<p>"The main pillars of strength for the whole market are the
yen and good corporate results" for fiscal 1990, Mr.
Ghaemmaghami said.</p>
<p>Moreover, investors are shedding fears of yen depreciation
on earnings, with many companies making bullish forecasts for
the current year, he said. And Japan's economy has continued
to expand in terms of gross national product data.</p>
<p>Speculative groups have also become more active, several
traders noted.</p>
<p>Strong performers yesterday included many oil companies,
helped by optimism on the yen. Mitsubishi Oil led the sector,
up 100 yen to 1280 yen (66 cents to $8.45).</p>
<p>Nippon Oil rose 60 yen to 1260 yen and Teikoku Oil rose 40
yen to 1260 yen.</p>
<p>Tokyu group companies rose again on speculative interest,
stemming from talk that the group's cross-shareholdings are
being increased. Tokyu Corp. soared 120 yen to 1970 yen,
Tokyu Construction added 30 yen to 1350 yen, and Tokyu
Department Store rose 60 yen to 1820 yen.</p>
<p>Shipbuilders, including Ishikawajima Harima Heavy
Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, were firmer.</p>
<p>But most high-technology shares were softer, despite the
implications of a stronger dollar on their export-oriented
businesses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, London's performance was volatile, with initial
gains swiftly eroded by profit-taking, futures selling and a
general lack of momentum.</p>
<p>"The market ran out of steam," said one dealer.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index ended
down 1.1 points at 2345.1, after falling to a low of 2333.7.
The peak of 2357.2 was reached shortly after the start of
official trading.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index was down 2.4 points at
1855. Volume was 466.2 million shares, compared with the
556.4 million issues Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traders generally agreed that, in the near-term, the
market could consolidate recent gains at yet-lower levels.
"It's been too far, too fast," said one trader.</p>
<p>With London's near-term performance seen hinging on Wall
Street, institutional investors may remain sidelined for a
time. But fund managers are heavily underweighted, traders
noted, suggesting that London could also benefit from their
entry into the market.</p>
<p>The market generally appears to want to test the upside,
traders said. "Any hint of good news, an acute shortage of
stock, an absence of sellers or a strong Wall Street" will
propel the market upward, said one trader.</p>
<p>Featured stocks yesterday included Guinness, which gained
27 pence to 769 pence (46 cents to $13.04) on Moet Hennessy
Louis Vuitton interest, and Enterprise Oil, which rose 34
pence to 663 pence on continued speculation that Elf
Aquitaine will mount a takeover bid.</p>
<p>Other shares to rise included Bass, which gained 15 pence
to #10.86 on what one trader termed "a good old-fashioned
squeeze." Carlton Communications rose 29 pence to 565 pence
on renewed interest.</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce rose 6 1/2 pence to 223 1/2 pence on
speculation that something is afoot with the company. Traders
said they couldn't suggest what this may be.</p>
<p>On the downside, Glaxo eased 12 pence to 785 pence on
concern about competition in the U.S. for that company's
leading products. Traders generally cautioned that stocks
with high dollar earnings may be soon hit by the strong
pound.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, stocks closed higher in Milan; lower in Paris
and Zurich; and mixed in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Stockholm.
South African markets were closed for a holiday.</p>
<p>And prices ended higher in Sydney, Hong Kong, Taipei,
Manila, Wellington and Seoul, and were lower in Singapore.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
