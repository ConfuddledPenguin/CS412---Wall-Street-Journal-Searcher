	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. has expanded the
duties of two men who apparently become the leading
candidates to succeed Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, although the
timing of the 65-year-old chief executive officer's
retirement remains as ambiguous as ever.
   The moves, which constitute Chrysler's fifth management
restructuring since 1985, came in the wake of Vice Chairman
Gerald Greenwald's abrupt resignation to lead a proposed
employee buy-out of United Airlines. The action divided Mr.
Greenwald's duties between Robert S. Miller Jr. and Robert A.
Lutz.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Miller, 48 years old, becomes vice chairman, a title
he previously held from 1985 to 1988. In addition to
supervising all of Chrysler's financial activities and the
office of the general counsel and secretary, he now adds
responsibility for Chrysler Financial Corp., Chrysler
Technologies and international operations. He will report to
Mr. Iacocca; he previously reported to Mr. Greenwald.</p>
<p>Mr. Lutz, 58 and president of Chrysler's automotive
operations, assumes responsibility for quality and
productivity, along with Acustar, Chrysler's parts-making
subsidiary. He also will report to Mr. Iacocca. He had
reported to the Office of the Chairman, which consisted of
Mr. Iacocca and Mr. Greenwald but now has been dissolved.</p>
<p>Succeeding Mr. Miller as chief financial officer and
executive vice president of finance is Jerome B. York, 51 and
previously vice president and controller. Mr. Greenwald's
departure didn't generate much excitement on Wall Street,
even though he's the third top Chrysler official in as many
weeks to announce his resignation. Mr. Greenwald also was
considered Mr. Iacocca's most likely successor. In moderate
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Chrysler
stock fell 25 cents to close at $15.375 a share.</p>
<p>"The loss {of Mr. Greenwald} isn't changing anything,"
said Philip K. Fricke, an auto analyst with Prudential-Bache
Research. "There's no sign his departure signals a change in
course or anything different in product development."</p>
<p>Analysts also noted that Chrysler's shares already have
been deeply discounted for bad news. "It would take an
earthquake in Highland Park for the stock to get much lower,"
said Scott Merlis, an auto analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald said the United Airlines unions first
approached him about six weeks ago, but he didn't seriously
consider their offer until they assured him that the company
they will own if their buy-out succeeds will be "run in a
normal way" with a majority of "independent directors."</p>
<p>He made his final decision early Wednesday morning, "after
spending a day and a half privately" with Mr. Iacocca in the
chairman's Tuscany, Italy, villa. The two men then flew back
together on a Chrysler corporate jet.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald held news conferences in Detroit and New
York yesterday, but he didn't disclose much about what he and
Mr. Iacocca discussed. He did say Mr. Iacocca asked him if
"there was uncertainty in my mind" about Mr. Iacocca's plans
to retire, and was such uncertainty "influencing my decision,
and I said absolutely not and we left it at that."</p>
<p>In response to persistent questioning from reporters about
whether Mr. Iacocca will retire when his contract with
Chrysler expires in October 1991, Mr. Greenwald said:
"Frankly, I really didn't want to get in that close on that
subject with Lee."</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald said there's "no operating assumption" among
Chrysler's top executives about when Mr. Iacocca will
actually leave, but he insisted this hasn't created any
problems. "Nobody inside that team is trying to outguess
who's going to go where, when and how. . . . Maybe this is a
little hard for you to believe, but there isn't that kind of
speculation going on inside our company."</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald said he sees himself pursuing opportunity
rather than fleeing frustration. "There's been some
speculation that I didn't want to wait for the day when I'd
{become} CEO at Chrysler," Mr. Greenwald said. "That really
didn't enter into it at all. . . . I've always felt if I
performed well that the time would come when I would get the
chance to run Chrysler." However, the prospect of leading the
world's largest employee-owned company "was just too much a
challenge, or a temptation, to say no to."</p>
<p>People close to Mr. Greenwald, though, say he was growing
impatient because Mr. Iacocca hasn't ever made it clear,
despite his contract, when he'll retire.</p>
<p>When Mr. Greenwald returned to Chrysler headquarters late
Wednesday afternoon, the buildings were abuzz with rumor.
Officially, Chrysler's spokesmen had been saying since last
Friday that Mr. Greenwald was visiting a sister in
California, and that there was "nothing to" rumors of his
departure.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald apologized for the deception yesterday, but
said it was unavoidable. "It wasn't until 10 days ago that I
took this really seriously," he said.</p>
