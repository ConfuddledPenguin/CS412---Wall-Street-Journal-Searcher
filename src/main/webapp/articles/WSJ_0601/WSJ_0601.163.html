	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission voted
to approve a pilot project allowing stock exchanges to trade
some over-the-counter stocks.
   The project, passed by the commission 3-1, is designed to
foster competition in stock trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The SEC approved the plan as a pilot to run about a year
before evaluation.</p>
<p>Under the plan, exchanges would apply to the SEC for the
right to trade OTC stocks under "unlisted trading
privileges." That would allow the exchanges to trade the
shares without having the issues go through the exchanges'
standard registration or listing requirements.</p>
<p>"This is one of the steps the commission is taking to
create a national market system," an SEC spokeswoman said.
She added that the action follows a 1975 congressional action
asking the SEC to help create such a system.</p>
