	<p class="article-leader">Helping Fast-Trackers
   Stay on the Track</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>FAST-TRACK managers often get derailed as they scamper up
the corporate ladder, especially at fast-growing companies
where promising young people rise swiftly.</p>
<p>Psychologists say this happens because fast-trackers are
psychologically out of sync with older peers. "They're
bright, clever and creative, but they often lack the breadth
of experience in dealing with people that makes them wise,"
says Kenneth Settel, a psychiatrist at the Levinson
Institute, Belmont, Mass. Colleague Tim Havens says their
youthfulness makes such managers more vulnerable to harsh
self-criticism.</p>
<p>Chubb Corp. finds that the fast-track process doesn't
always give those in the fast lane the competence necessary
to do a job well, so an up-and-coming manager's
self-confidence erodes. "If you put fast-trackers in the deep
end of the pool too early, they'll drop to the bottom," says
David Fowler, Chubb's senior vice president for human
resources.</p>
<p>Bosses can help reduce the risk of problems by recognizing
that a young manager is out of sync. "Listen hard to grasp
issues and viewpoints that are foreign to you," Dr. Havens
urges.</p>
<p>Some companies send fast-trackers for special training in
how to deal with people. At others, young managers benefit
from peer groups of fast-trackers, which provide support and
"relief from that odd-duck feeling," Dr. Havens says. At
Chubb, young managers in distress may be reassigned to areas
where they can restore their confidence.</p>
<p>Handling Bad News</p>
<p>In Annual Reports</p>
<p>FOUR MAJOR accidents forced airline managers to face the
sensitive topic of how to treat the crashes in their latest
annual reports to shareholders. Some bit the bullet. One
carrier decided it was better to say nothing.</p>
<p>USAir Group Inc.'s report mentions the troubles that
Hurricane Hugo and the California earthquake caused to its
operations. But there was no mention that one of its
airplanes ran off a runway at New York's LaGuardia Airport in
September, killing two passengers and injuring 21. A USAir
spokesman says the company's decision against mentioning the
crash was "no attempt to sweep anything under the rug."</p>
<p>By contrast, UAL Corp.'s annual report details the
"tragic" United Airlines accidents last year over the Pacific
and in Sioux City, Iowa. It said rescue work by its flight
crews and Sioux City residents are now "a part of United
Airlines' legacy." A United spokesman said there was "never
much debate" whether to mention the fatal accidents.</p>
<p>In a letter to shareholders, Pan Am Corp. Chairman Thomas
G. Plaskett refers to the "senseless murders of 270 innocent
people" who died in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 in December 1988. He said their deaths "were personally
devastating . . . to the people of Pan Am."</p>
<p>Generally, investor-relations consultants favor disclosing
bad news with the good. "The issue is credibility," says
Denver consultant Carl Thompson. "If you don't address the
bad news, people won't believe your good news."</p>
<p>Computer Aids May Hurt</p>
<p>In Decision Making</p>
<p>COMPUTER programs designed to assist managers in making
decisions don't always help, and sometimes can hamper
performance, a team of researchers finds.</p>
<p>Jeffrey E. Kottemann, assistant professor of computer
information systems at the University of Michigan, simulated
a manufacturing-production process in a growth industry. He
had M.B.A. students decide on output and staffing, given
uncertain demand, over 24 mock quarters. One group used a
spreadsheet-oriented computer aid that helped members
evaluate alternatives. The other group was on its own,
relying on intuition and experience.</p>
<p>Contrary to Mr. Kottemann's expectations, the
computer-assisted people significantly underperformed the
unaided, in the initial experiment as well as two follow-ups.
With the computer aids, he says, people appear to have sought
short-term results by understaffing and underproducing. But
those decisions, over time, meant lost sales and extra costs.</p>
<p>Oddly, the computer-aided group didn't recognize that
using the programs led to poor decisions. "They were
significantly more confident in their performance than the
unaided group," Mr. Kottemann says. He and two colleagues,
Fred D. Davis Jr. and William Remus, plan further work to
help explain when and how computer aids affect actual and
perceived performance.</p>
<p>Companies Do More</p>
<p>Than Test for Drugs</p>
<p>DRUG TESTING by employers soared in the 1980s, but signs
emerge that companies are looking to other methods to curb
drug abuse by employees.</p>
<p>The number of employers that test for drugs rose only 7%
in the latest survey by the American Management Association,
after jumping 33% in 1989.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of big companies that train
supervisors and managers to spot behavior that might indicate
drug use jumped 24% this year. Now 36% of respondents provide
such training, including one in five that train managers but
don't test for drugs.</p>
<p>Companies that provide drug education and awareness
programs surged 38% in the latest survey, and more than half
-- 51% -- of major firms now support employee-assistance
programs for drug abusers, up from 42% in 1988. "The small
increase in the number of companies that test, and the larger
increase in the number pursuing other initiatives, is a
positive finding," says Eric Greenberg, editor of the
management group's research reports.</p>
