	<p class="article-leader">In the art of politics there is a craft called Advance.
These are the men and women who prepare an area for a visit
by a leader or politician. Advance men and women are a loose
fraternity with their own lore ("Remember the kid they told
to find a speech site for a speech by Kefauver" -- or
Kennedy, or Romney -- "and he asked the locals what's the
most popular nightspot in town, and he booked it, and that
night he gets there all proud with Kefauver and it's a strip
joint? And Kefauver makes the speech?"). They have their own
traditions and even language ("When is the candidate
leaving?" "Wheels up 4 p.m.")
   Advance makes sure the man who heads the receiving line
isn't a convicted child molester; they make sure the sound
system works, the press can file, the crowd shows. They are
among the indispensables of politics, and generally
underappreciated. Good Advance means only that Brit Hume will
not lead with "In a haphazardly planned event that never
really got off the ground" -- cut to picture of presidential
candidate tripping over exposed cables on way to podium and
knocking over row of girl scouts. Bad Advance means, in a
beneficent campaign, one more and you're out. And so Advance
people take on the tics of the trade: a certain jut-jawed
intensity, an addiction to jogging and junk food, and a
desire to carry on three conversations at the same time on
the car phone, the cellular phone, and the radio.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When Mikhail Gorbachev visits Minneapolis and St. Paul,
Minn., this Sunday (ETA lunchtime, wheels up early evening) a
small army of a few dozen Advance veterans called in by the
governor's office and the business community will have paved
the way. I spoke to one just after midnight Wednesday. After
the negotiations -- "Don't put my name in, I'm no big deal,
you can quote but not for attribution, and check all spelling
with your desk" -- the Advance person settled in to chat
while waiting for room service.</p>
<p>What's happening?</p>
<p>"Right now we're waiting for the Twins to beat the Orioles
so we can roll a few hundred tables onto the Astroturf. The
International Press Center is the field of the Hubert H.
Humphrey Metrodome. There'll be hundreds of phones and copy
machines and faxes. The Russians particularly asked for
faxes. The filing center is in right field. The press office
is on the right field foul line. The technician's lounge is
in center field. The food's in left field. They may need new
turf there when it's over."</p>
<p>How are things going?</p>
<p>"We're tearing our hair out. Reporters are calling and
saying `Three days out and you don't have a schedule, oh ha
ha.' We don't know how many events we have. Normally at this
point in the trip Americans would be going over the schedule
with a fine-toothed comb. But we don't have a schedule. The
Russians won't tell us what they want to do. They're not
being secretive or balky; they just don't know. Or they can't
get Gorbachev's people to sign off. They're still
`considering' everything."</p>
<p>This is what they're considering: Mrs. Gorbachev may visit
a typical American family in south Minneapolis. (So far the
designated family is that of Karen and Steve Watson and their
four children. A local paper said of them Wednesday: "They're
the Watsons, not the Cleavers. Their home is modest and well
kept, but not too modest or too well kept." He's an
elementary-school art teacher, she's a nurse. Their dog is
half Irish setter and half golden retriever. Mr. Watson is
thinking of showing Mrs. Gorbachev the dishwasher and the
laundry room.) Both Gorbachevs may attend an ecumenical
service in the big Roman Catholic cathedral in St. Paul. They
may visit an art museum. They may briefly get out of the
city. "The Soviet and American advance, Soviet security and
the Secret Service went off on a bus today to look at farms."</p>
<p>What have the Soviets said yes to? An airport arrival
ceremony, which is to include every member of the Minnesota
congressional delegation; a luncheon in the governor's
mansion -- "So far the Soviets want it private, no press";
and a meeting with business leaders, probably featuring Q&A
with Mr. Gorbachev. Who will be there? "All the hitters and
CEOs. This is definitely a business trip, no question."</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>"You can tell when you talk to them." Who? "The Russian
Advance guys. They came in last week." Are they like American
Advance guys? "No, not the same manic attention to detail."</p>
<p>Minnesota is the headquarters of Cargill, a company that
sells grain to the Soviet Union. Minnesota is also home to 24
Fortune 500 companies, including 3-M, Honeywell, Pillsbury,
General Mills and Control Data Corp. Control Data is probably
the touchiest of these names. The Soviets have an order in
with the firm to buy $32 million of Cyber 962 mainframe
computers -- computers that some say could have the kind of
military applications that used to be blocked under
technology-transfer rules. But the Russians are expecting to
get Washington's approval on the hardware deal shortly.
Advance people, for their part, sometimes refer to the
transaction as "selling the Soviets computers that have
something to do with nuclear tests."</p>
<p>One senses the state's attitude toward the Gorbachev visit
is not unlike that of a wife who has been hastily informed
that tomorrow night the husband's best potential customer
ever is coming to dinner; the silverware's out, the flowers
have been ordered and the tablecloth is being ironed. From
the moment the Soviets accepted Gov. Rudy Perpich's
invitation, boosters and businessmen went into high gear.
Within 24 hours they had a Gorbachev Visit Office in a new
downtown office building -- 7,000 square feet of office space
donated by Carlson Co., a local holding company. IBM came in
and donated all computer operations. U S West, the local
phone company, donated all cellular and desk phones, pagers,
beepers and radio phones.</p>
<p>"You should see the people out there. Every business in
town is offering people and products and calling in to help.
It's incredible. It's like Super Bowl fever. On local TV
they're showing kids learning Russian songs and Russian
phrases in the schools. I don't mean Berlitz is gonna get
bought out on language tapes, but the spirit is incredible.
I'm blown away by the business community. It's Gorby fever.
It's like when people are psyched up for a Super Bowl. I'd
like to see people get this psyched up over a president."</p>
<p>What about the local political implications? There was
talk recently that the Gorbachev coup would re-elect Rudy
Perpich this fall.</p>
<p>"Listen, let me run this down for you. Perpich is bringing
to Minnesota in 1991, for the first time, the U.S. Open. Also
in '91 he's got the International Special Olympics. In '92
he's got the NCAA final four and the Super Bowl. And he got
Gorbachev. So I don't know what his problems are but he must
be feeling pretty good." Wednesday night, when Mr. Perpich
walked into the daily Advance countdown meeting in a
conference room at the Radisson Plaza Hotel, he got a
standing ovation.</p>
<p>Has the Advance person been told of anything special Mr.
Gorbachev is going to do, such as, oh, speak a sentence or
two of English for a perfect seven-second bite on the
networks? Something homey and American and aimed also at the
folks back home, like, "Don't change horses in midstream"?
"No, no speech is planned."</p>
<p>Who is in the Russian party?</p>
<p>The Advance person sighs. "We don't know, we're trying to
find out exactly from Washington." Do you know how many
people are in the Russian party? "No, but it's not like five
to six, not like 100. A few dozen."</p>
<p>Anything more on the schedule?</p>
<p>"No. But it'll be whirlwind."</p>
<p>When will the Gorbachevs get to rest?</p>
<p>"That's called `private time.' It's built into the
schedule. The Radisson Hotel's got rooms for them. So you
know, Mrs. Gorbachev can go into the bathroom if she wants to
get the governor's wife out of her face. Oh, this is
interesting. The Russians know Gorbachev's spontaneous. They
know their guys like we know our guys. They're telling us
they don't know what he'll do. They're not even asking about
the motorcade route -- you know, so we could help them
arrange a crowd for a spontaneous jump out of the limo. We're
finding out the spontaneous thing is genuine."</p>
<p>With Lithuania unresolved, with Moscow bracing for panic
buying in a K mart without inventory, with Yeltsin rising,
any contingency plans for a Gorbachev defection?</p>
<p>The Advance person pauses.</p>
<p>"Actually, a woman at yesterday's meeting said, `What do
we do if when he gets to the cathedral he asks for
sanctuary?' Everybody laughed."</p>
