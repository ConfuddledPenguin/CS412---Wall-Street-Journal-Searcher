	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, a French
spirits and luxury products group, said it is offering to buy
an additional 6.8% of Guinness PLC through a tender offer.
   The company said it is offering to pay as much as 825
pence ($13.99) a share to acquire as much as 59.4 million
shares in Guinness, a British spirits group. The purchases
would lift LVMH's holdings in Guinness to 24.1%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>LVMH's current holdings include 42.8 million shares, which
the company acquired yesterday. Guinness shares are currently
trading at 762 pence, up from 742 at Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>The intended enlarged holding would draw LVMH's stake in
Guinness roughly even with the 24.1% fully diluted stake
Guinness holds in the French group. The two companies agreed
in 1988 to allow each to hold equivalent stakes in the other.</p>
<p>If LVMH receives more than the required shares under the
tender, it said it will drop its offer price to the lowest
price at which the full number of shares can be acquired.</p>
<p>Should the tender fail to attract enough shares to lift
its stake to the target level, LVMH said it will buy
additional shares in the market through U.K. brokers S.G.
Warburg & Co.</p>
