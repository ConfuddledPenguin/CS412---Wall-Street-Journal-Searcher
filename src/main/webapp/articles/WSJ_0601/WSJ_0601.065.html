	<p class="article-leader">Airline coupons that offer $35 discounts have triggered
wide interest -- and a cat and mouse game between consumers
and carriers.
   While consumers are scrambling to get copies of newspapers
with the $35-discount coupons run by UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines unit, some airlines accepting the coupons are trying
to make as few fares as possible eligible.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The United coupons are so popular that many carriers have
been forced to honor them for fear of not being competitive.
But the airlines aren't honoring the coupons on tickets
already purchased -- a provision consumers think should be
changed.</p>
<p>"That's the only fair thing to do," says Harry Gourevitch,
a Washington, D.C., lawyer who hammered United with
complaints after it refused to redeem the $35-off coupons on
tickets he bought before the promotion began May 21. "I
called United reservations this morning. I got a fellow
called Chris, and he said he had a lot of calls already but
he couldn't do anything. It's fraud on consumers." United
says the restriction is part of its publicized rules.</p>
<p>The gimmick is so big that many carriers fear being
swamped by it. Some, such as AMR Corp.'s American Airlines
unit, Pan Am Corp.'s Pan American World Airways unit and
Delta Air Lines, refuse to participate. Others are sneakier.</p>
<p>On May 23, two days after United started advertising its
coupons, one of its commuter carriers dropped a $176
round-trip fare between Los Angeles and Monterey, Calif., to
$174. Although small, the fare cut typically would be good
news for travelers. This time, it wasn't. By cutting the
fare, the United commuter line made the fare ineligible for
the $35-off coupon. The promotion's rules say the coupon
can't be applied to fares below $175.</p>
<p>With the $176 fare, fliers could redeem a coupon and fly
for $141. "I couldn't believe it," says Jean Burgess, manager
of House of Travel in Los Angeles, who was trying to book the
$176 fare.</p>
<p>WestAir Holding Inc., which operates the commuter line,
acknowledges the sleight of hand. "We had what might be
described as an overzealous pricing person who, thinking that
he was looking out for the company's best interest, reduced
the fare," says a spokesman. "As soon as our senior people
became aware of it, they changed it." Last Friday, the fare
was returned to $176.</p>
<p>USAir Group Inc. didn't back off so quickly. As of
yesterday, it still had the $174 fare.</p>
<p>Airlines were just as crafty on the Los Angeles-Reno,
Nev., route. Over the past several days, United, USAir and
America West have all introduced a $174 fare that doesn't
qualify for the $35-off coupon.</p>
<p>In addition to USAir and America West, the airlines
accepting United's coupon on their flights include:
Continental Airlines, a unit of Texas Air Corp., NWA Inc.'s
Northwest Airlines, Midway Airlines and, on a limited basis,
Trans World Airlines.</p>
<p>"The coupons have stimulated business quite a bit," says
Gwen Wells, manager of Century Travel in Denver. She says
business is up 10% to 15% since United started its coupon
deal.</p>
<p>For their part, consumers are besieging newspapers and
libraries with requests for issues of papers that carried the
ad containing three clip-and-save coupons.</p>
<p>In Orlando, Fla., a public library official says somebody
ripped the coupon page out of two newspapers on file.
United's coupons were run in only one issue of various
newspapers across the country -- on May 21 in some and May 23
in others -- and the number is limited because photocopies
aren't accepted. United wouldn't disclose the number of
coupons published.</p>
<p>In Seattle, the two daily papers were forced to slap a
one-paper limit on the May 21 issue after a local travel
agent snatched up 75 copies. June Saty, who works in the
Seattle Times and Seattle Post-Intelligencer's circulation
department, says, "I've had people come in and just about
jump over the counter at me."</p>
