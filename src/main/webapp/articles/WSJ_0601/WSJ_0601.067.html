	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices turned in a mixed performance, as
investors took profits in blue-chip issues that have led the
recent rally and then bid for stocks that are catching up.
   Bond prices, meanwhile, extended this week's string of
gains by drifting higher in light trading, and the dollar
rose.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 1.90 points to
close at 2876.66 in active trading, but the broader Standard
& Poor's 500-stock index nudged ahead to a third consecutive
record close, up 0.37 at 361.23.</p>
<p>Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose more than an
eighth of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount. The
dollar gained against most other major currencies on concern
over instability in the Mideast and questions about how a
reunified Germany would be aligned politically.</p>
<p>Economic indicators are strengthening the case for slow
but stable growth in the U.S. economy and low inflation, both
of which tend to make fixed-rate investments such as bonds
attractive. But slow growth -- rather than a recession -- is
also relatively good for stocks. That's why investors haven't
been eager to jump off the blue-chip bandwagon; the Dow Jones
industrials have posted new highs in eight of the past 13
sessions.</p>
<p>"I like the market," said Philip Roth, chief technical
analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, "but I don't rule out a
correction for a few days." Over the summer, however, he
expects stocks to move modestly higher. One reason is a
decline in commodity prices, a further sign that inflation
need not be feared. As a result, interest rates should fall,
meaning bond yields will drop, which in turn should lure more
investors into stocks.</p>
<p>But David Bostian, chief investment strategist at Jesup &
Lamont, said stock market investors may discover that growth
is slowing faster than they thought. "Investors' perceptions
have become divorced from the economy," he warned.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell in early trading in reaction to regional
surveys of purchasing managers that suggested the
manufacturing business is improving. But then dealers began
buying back bonds to replace those they had sold, in effect
betting that prices would fall-which drove prices higher.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices fell. Trading was moderately active, with
165.7 million shares changing hands on the New York Stock
Exchange. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners, 801-682.</p>
<p>Bond prices climbed. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.57%.</p>
<p>The dollar gained slightly. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6965 marks and 152.10 yen, compared
with 1.6830 marks and 151.45 yen late Wednesday.</p>
