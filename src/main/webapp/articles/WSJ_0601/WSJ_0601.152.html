	<p class="article-leader">The over-the-counter market stepped timidly toward today's
employment figures.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index edged up 0.20 to 458.97, or
0.04%, as advancing stocks narrowly led decliners, 979 to
941. Volume slowed to 157.3 million shares from 169.4 million
Wednesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I imagine some people are sitting back and waiting to see
what the unemployment data is," said William Rothe, managing
director of OTC trading at Alex. Brown & Sons, Baltimore. The
Labor Department will release data on jobs growth and
unemployment before trading begins this morning.</p>
<p>"The market seems to be getting tired," Mr. Rothe added,
suggesting that OTC stocks might be due for a rest. However,
Mr. Rothe said that he thinks there remain a number of money
managers on the sidelines with cash to invest in stocks.</p>
<p>One of the OTC market's more bearish market professional
shares that opinion. Walter Carucci, vice president of Carr
Securities, said, "There's still so much cash on sidelines,
you could almost create a bullish scenario if you want to."
Mr. Carucci said that last week he began to see buying
interest in smaller issues across-the-board "for the first
time in a long time," adding that "our volume has picked up
quite substantially." However, pointing to such economic
troubles as the savings and loan crisis, Mr. Carucci said,
"I'm still very bearish, but would like to be proven wrong."</p>
<p>Traders said they were kept busy much of the day by a new
issue of Mr. Coffee and a secondary offering of Urcarco.</p>
<p>The most active stock was Mr. Coffee, which sold an
initial public offering of 4 million shares at $10 each.
Trading under the stock symbol JAVA, more than 4.2 million
shares of the Bedford Heights, Ohio, coffeemaker company said
changed hands and closed unchanged  at 11 1/8. Proceeds from
the offering will be used to reduce debt incurred by Mr.
Coffee in a leveraged buy-out.</p>
<p>Second on the most-active list was Urcarco, up 3/4 at 20
5/8. A secondary offering of 5 million shares of the Fort
Worth, Texas, retailer of used cars and trucks was priced at
$19.875. Urcarco went public last November at $11 a share.</p>
<p>Tyco Toys gained 2 3/4 to 27 3/8 on more than 18 times
average volume. The Mt. Laurel, N.J., toy maker said late
Wednesday it received an unsolicited acquisition offer. Tyco
Toys, which didn't identify the possible buyer, said the two
parties have had discussions but gave no assurance that an
agreement will be reached.</p>
<p>Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said that Hasbro is
rumored to be the suitor among Wall Street analysts and
arbitragers. Hasbro Chief Financial Officer John O'Neill
declined to comment.</p>
<p>SynOptics Communications added 6 1/4 to 45 1/4 after the
Mountain View, Calif., maker of computer network systems said
late Wednesday that it expects net income for the second
quarter ending June 29 will be about 35% higher than
first-quarter net income of 43 cents a share. SynOptics
earned 26 cents a share in the year-ago second quarter.
However, the company added that although product demand is
strong, it doesn't expect to repeat that growth rate in
future quarters.</p>
<p>Seagate Technology rose 3/4 to 15 5/8. The Scotts Valley,
Calif., disk-drive maker unveiled its second-generation disk
drive for small computers, such as laptop computers. Shares
of Maxtor, a San Jose, Calif., disk-drive maker, rose 3/8 to
16 3/8 on volume of 1.4 million.</p>
<p>Software Toolworks jumped 1 5/8 to 22 3/4 on nearly 1.7
million shares after the Chatsworth, Calif., software
developer reported net income for the fourth quarter ended
March 31 of 12 cents a share, including extraordinary items,
up from five cents a year earlier. The company also said that
it signed a letter of intent with Canon Inc. to develop a
software program for use in an IBM-compatible Canon product
to be released later this year.</p>
<p>Sequent Computer Systems rose 1 1/4 to 31 3/4 and Pyramid
Technology dropped 2 1/4 to 32 3/4 following comments by
Goldman Sachs computer analyst John C. Levinson, according to
DJPIR. Mr. Levinson concluded that American Telephone &
Telegraph might choose the Beaverton, Ore.-based Sequent,
rather than Pyramid, of Mountain View, Calif., to provide a
multiprocessing element for a new version of AT&T's Unix
system, which is slated for release late next year, DJPIR
said. Mr. Levinson wasn't available for comment, but a
Goldman employee confirmed the analyst repeated a
long-standing "buy" opinion on Sequent and removed a "trading
buy" opinion on Pyramid and now rates it a near-term "hold."</p>
<p>A Sequent official called Mr. Levinson's report
"speculation" and declined to comment on AT&T's intentions,
DJPIR said. AT&T and Pyramid officials weren't available for
comment.</p>
<p>Occupational Urgent Care Health Systems gained 1 1/4 to 24
1/2. David A. Edelstein, chief financial officer of the
Sacramento, Calif., provider of cost containment and other
health care services, told DJPIR there weren't corporate
developments to explain the move. However, the company's
chairman, James W. Cameron, was scheduled to appear last
night at an informal meeting with portfolio managers arranged
by Hambrecht & Quist, DJPIR reported. Occupational Urgent
Care also is one of several companies scheduled to appear
June 4 at a Morgan Stanley conference on growth stocks.</p>
<p>Life Technologies fell 3/4 to 15 3/4. Late Wednesday, the
Gaithersburg, Md., developer of life-science products said it
might sell all or part of its diagnostic operations and plans
to cut its participation in the molecular diagnostics
business.</p>
<p>Chips & Technologies lost 1 1/4 to 19 after the San Jose,
Calif., maker of microcomputer chips said it settled a trade
secrets lawsuit with Elite Microelectronics Inc. The
agreement doesn't involve any payments, but the companies
agreed that a jointly appointed inspector will periodically
review Elite's operations.</p>
<p>NESB tumbled 7/8 to 1 1/2 after the New London, Conn.,
thrift said that holders of its $50 million long-term senior
notes due June 1, 1995, are seeking immediate repayment
following negotiations to amend the terms of the note
agreements. The thrift said that it's willing to work out an
acceptable agreement, but is uncertain whether negotiations
will resume.</p>
<p>Washington Scientific Industries fell 1/2 to 6 5/8. The
Minneapolis maker of precision equipment said late Wednesday
that it expects to report a loss for the third quarter ending
June 3 of about 15 cents a share, compared with restated net
income from continuing operations of 18 cents a share a year
earlier.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>LIFE TECHNOLOGIES Inc.'s stock rose 3/4 Thursday to 15
3/4. Friday's OTC Focus column gave an incorrect closing
price.</p>
