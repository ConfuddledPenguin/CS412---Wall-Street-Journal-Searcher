	<p class="article-leader">CHATSWORTH, Calif. -- Software Toolworks Inc. said net
income more than tripled in its fourth quarter ended March
31, bolstered by its recent acquisition of Mindscape Inc. and
strong sales of computer game products.
   The maker of entertainment, educational and office
software said net rose to $2.3 million, or 12 cents a share,
from $740,000, or five cents a share, a year earlier.
Per-share amounts are adjusted for a 2-for-1 split paid April
4.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest period includes an after-tax charge of $1.2
million related to costs of the Mindscape acquisition and
$677,000 in tax credits for previous losses.</p>
<p>Revenue jumped 78% in the quarter, to $21.9 million from
$12.3 million. Shares outstanding averaged 20.3 million in
the latest period, compared with 16 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>The company acquired Mindscape on March 15 in a stock swap
valued at about $40 million. Because the transaction is being
accounted for under the pooling-of-interests method, the
latest period's results as well as the earlier ones include
those of Mindscape, a company official said.</p>
<p>Mindscape, based in Northbrook, Ill., has a license to
produce game cartridges for Nintendo Co. computer game
system. Software Toolworks said its latest results were
boosted by the company's release of an "Infiltrator" game for
the Nintendo system as well as sales of older game products
including "Paperboy," "Road Blaster" and "The Hunt for Red
October."</p>
<p>Software Toolworks said it signed a letter of intent with
Canon Inc. of Japan to develop software for the Canon
Navigator IBM-compatible personal computer to be released
this year.</p>
<p>For the year ended March 31, Software Toolworks' net was
$2.5 million, or 14 cents a share. It had a net loss of $4.3
million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue swelled
96% to $68.7 million from $35.0 million. Average shares
outstanding, adjusted for the 2-for-1 split, rose to 18.3
million from 14.8 million.</p>
