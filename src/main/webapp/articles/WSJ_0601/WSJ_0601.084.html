	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- The Canadian dollar strengthened yesterday on
news that Prime Minister Brian Mulroney will convene a
weekend meeting to address Canada's constitutional impasse.
   The Canadian currency rose in Toronto to 85.30 U.S. cents
from 85 U.S. cents Wednesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Mulroney summoned the country's 10 provincial premiers
to Ottawa Sunday for negotiations to overcome the
constitutional deadlock. Financial markets interpreted the
announcement as a sign of possible progress toward a
settlement.</p>
<p>The impasse has renewed demands from some in Quebec for
independence for their largely French-speaking province and
has unsettled Canada's markets.</p>
<p>The Ottawa meeting follows weeks of intense negotiations
between the federal government and individual provinces that
have narrowed but failed to settle the differences. The
dispute involves proposed constitutional amendments that
which would recognize Quebec as a "distinct society" within
Canada. The accord would also extend new powers to the
provinces.</p>
<p>Edward Neufeld, executive vice president of the Royal Bank
of Canada, estimated that political uncertainties have pushed
up short-term Canadian interest rates by at least a full
percentage point.</p>
