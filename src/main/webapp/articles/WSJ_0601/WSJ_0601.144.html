	<p class="article-leader">AUSTIN, Texas -- Dell Computer Corp., citing competitive
pressures from the computer marketplace, said it cut the
prices on its computers by $50 to $1,100, effective Monday.
   The direct-seller of computer products said the price cuts
affect its laptop computers, and its computers built around
the Intel Corp. 286, 386 and 486 microprocessors. The actual
price changes, however, depend on the computer, the amount of
memory in it and the memory capability of the machine's
hard-disk drive.</p>
