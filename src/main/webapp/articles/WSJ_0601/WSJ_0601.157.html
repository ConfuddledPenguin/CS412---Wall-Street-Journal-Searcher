	<p class="article-leader">EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Rockwell International Corp. said
that James L. Churchill, president of Rockwell's avionics
group since 1981, has decided to retire at the end of the
year.
   Mr. Churchill, 60 years old, has held various executive
posts over 21 years at the group, based in Cedar Rapids,
Iowa. During his tenure as president, group sales more than
doubled to $984 million last year from $455 million, Rockwell
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Churchill's duties will be divided between two
executives as part of a realignment that spins off the
group's government division into Rockwell's defense
electronics segment. "This brings all of our defense
electronics under one umbrella," a Rockwell spokesman said.</p>
<p>John R. Girotto, 52, who will immediately assume most of
Mr. Churchill's duties, was named president of the group's
air transport and general aviation divisions. He was formerly
vice president and general manager of the air transport
division. John A. McLuckey, 50, continues as president of the
defense electronics segment, with additional duties.</p>
