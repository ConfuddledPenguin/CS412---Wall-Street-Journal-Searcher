	<p class="article-leader">The new consensus this summit week is that Mikhail
Gorbachev is a besieged man. The consensus is finally
catching up with Vladimir Bukovsky.
   Years ago, the famous former dissident was saying that the
seemingly mighty Soviet Union was in fact a ramshackle
edifice built on lies and terror. Months ago, he was saying
that the mighty Mikhail championed in the West was a failure
at home. Now he's saying that both Russian and Western
interests are best served not by more schizophrenic Gorbachev
"reform," but by U.S. support for Soviet democracy. Amid the
summit hoopla, it's worth listening to one of the few who's
been right from the start about the Soviet crackup.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Soviet Union is now in a "runaway revolution," with
Mr. Gorbachev as the laggard, says Mr. Bukovsky from his
Cambridge, England, home-in-exile. Mr. Gorbachev is
yesterday's man, a transitional figure. He will get credit
for creating the process of revolution that he, as a product
of the old regime (the Communist Party), was ill-prepared to
master. Mr. Bukovsky's analogy is the Russia of 1905-17, when
the czar was promoting reform that became a revolution he
lost control of.</p>
<p>The failure is evident in the contradictions of the
Gorbachev reforms -- a "regulated market economy,"
"productive socialism." He understands the necessity of
change but not the means. His latest economic reform could be
the Red Queen's: pain first (higher prices), incentives later
(private property). The man who once presided over Soviet
agriculture -- defined as 73 years of bad weather -- is not
the man to preside over Soviet renewal.</p>
<p>The Communists, Mr. Bukovsky goes further, quoting former
Hungarian Communist Imre Poszgay, "cannot reform themselves.
They cannot liquidate themselves." They must be swept away,
toppled by an alternative force, as they were in Eastern
Europe. Even if Mr. Gorbachev were to become a radical
democrat tomorrow, he could succeed only by dismantling his
own rule. And even if he tried that, says Mr. Bukovsky, "the
people wouldn't trust him." He has too much Communist history
in his past.</p>
<p>"What you need now in the Soviet Union is a clean, clear
break from the past," he says.</p>
<p>Ah, but what about the threat from Mr. Gorbachev's
"right," from Pamyat, or Russian ultra-nationalists? The
State Department sponsored a visit of these types recently,
and they scared the Gorbo-skepticism out of even so savvy an
observer as columnist Charles Krauthammer.</p>
<p>Mr. Bukovsky says, don't fret. The U.S. spent taxpayer
money "to bring in six idiots. . . . They are nothing,
nothing] People don't vote for them. They can't even get
elected to city councils]" And it's true -- even in the
Russian republic nearly every candidate from the lunatic
right has been trounced in elections.</p>
<p>George Bush nonetheless says the enemy is "instability,
unpredictability," so Mr. Gorbachev is our man. But Mr.
Bukovsky replies that Mr. Gorbachev has become the enemy of
stability. He's the one stirring up ethnic Russian agitation
in the Baltics. His Politburo sent in the troops who gassed
nationalists in Soviet Georgia. His failure to understand
free markets is sending the country into depression. The KGB
is stirring up the ultra-nationalists -- the better to let
Mr. Gorbachev appear as the indispensable centrist.</p>
<p>"The Baltics are peaceful now. But if they fail in getting
independence, there will be a radicalization," Mr. Bukovsky
predicts. "The non-violent forces would lose credibility.
Remember, Lithuanians were still fighting in the forests in
the 1950s." This argument would be common wisdom if the
government in turmoil were in the Philippines or South
Africa. But Mr. Gorbachev always gets the benefit of the
American doubt.</p>
<p>"The current position of the American administration is
untenable," he adds. "On the one hand, they say the changes
in the Soviet Union are irreversible, so you can sign arms
agreements. On the other hand, they say you can't recognize
Lithuania because it might lead to a reversal. You can't have
it both ways."</p>
<p>The West must rethink its strategy. "Is it in the interest
of the West to see the disintegration of a huge country,
one-sixth of the globe going into protracted civil war and
famine? If it is, then they should support Gorbachev," he
says. "If it's not, then they must support the democratic
forces in the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>Russia has never had a democracy, but Mr. Bukovsky says:
"Look at the results. Everywhere there has been a vote, the
democratic reformers have won." Boris Yeltsin ("more sincere
than Gorbachev but still very much tied to his Marxist past")
of the Russian republic is in the headlines this week, but
others will soon become known too -- Moscow Mayor Gavriil
Popov; the Ukraine's Vyacheslav Chornovil. They offer the
only alternative, he says, to the current spiral of
disintegration -- strikes, food riots, rebellion. They would
be able to do what Mr. Gorbachev so far won't: Defuse revolt
in the republics by dismantling the empire.</p>
<p>In his memoir of prison life (12 years in all), Mr.
Bukovsky wrote that to keep sane he built a castle in his
mind. His suffering then may provide his advantage over
Western Sovietologists now: He remembers how much people have
suffered. His next book, due out this month in France, is
entitled, "U.S.S.R.: From Utopia to Disaster." His timing
seems about right.</p>
