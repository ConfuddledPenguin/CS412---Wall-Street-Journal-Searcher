	<p class="article-leader">COPENHAGEN -- Although not traditionally known as one of
Europe's peppier exchanges, the Danish stock market could be
the scene of some clever bidding ahead of European Community
market unification at the end of 1992.
   But while takeover moves are pushing the Copenhagen bourse
higher, individual investors may find it hard to capitalize
on the speculation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Foreign companies, and especially those of Denmark's
non-EC neighbors to the north, are expected to show
increasing interest in Danish companies in coming years, with
Denmark acting the role of bridgehead into the single
European market, some analysts suggest.</p>
<p>"Investors are looking strategically at Denmark," said
Claus Anderson, assistant general manager at Bikuben Bors
Borsmaeglerselskab AS, a bank-owned broker and member of the
Copenhagen Stock Exchange. "Swedes, Norwegians and Finns are
very interested in the Danish market as a way into 1992. . .
. "If you can't be there directly, you can be there by buying
Danish companies."</p>
<p>The bidding already has sent the Danish market motoring
higher. Last year, the 300-stock Copenhagen Stock Index
gained a hearty 33%. It advanced a more modest 10% during the
first four months of this year, held back, market observers
say, by rising Danish interest rates, which are closely
linked with West German ones.</p>
<p>But Bikuben Bors said he expects prices to rise further
and the rising prices to spur more new listings on the
Copenhagen exchange. While only 31 companies listed their
shares on the exchange during the first half of the 1980s, 72
did so in the second part of the decade.</p>
<p>"There's no doubt that more companies will come to the
Danish Stock Exchange this year and next as they see the
common market in 1992 as a business opportunity," said
Carsten Nielsen, chief of block trading at Unibors
Borsmaeglerselskab AS in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>As the only Nordic country belonging to the 12-member
arrangement, Denmark already has attracted more than just a
curious glance from some large Swedish and Norwegian
companies.</p>
<p>During the past year, Finland's Kemira Oy bought the
fertilizer unit of Superfrost AS; Sweden's Nobel Industrier
Sverige AB bought paint-maker Sadolin Holmblad AS; Norway's
Nora Industrier AS netted Danish Fancy Food Group AS;
Sweden's Hexagon AB bought a slew of small Danish food
companies, and Foervaltnings AB Ratos of Sweden bought Dahl
Invest International AS, a subsidiary of building-products
maker Broedrene Dahl AS.</p>
<p>A number of strategic alliances have been forged between
Danish concerns and others in Europe, giving small to
medium-sized Danish companies a chance against bigger players
on the post-1992 stage.</p>
<p>Dutch electronics giant N.V. Philips Gloeilampenfabriken
in May bought a 25% stake in advanced audio-video designer
and manufacturer Bang & Olufson AS for 340 million Danish
kroner ($53.2 million).</p>
<p>Also, Britain's Blue Circle Industries PLC, a cement
maker, bought a 50% interest in Denmark's only cement maker
Aalborg Portland for 980 million kroner.</p>
<p>But some say the EC link is tenuous at best. "The euphoria
is a bit overdone," said Claus Gregerson, an institutional
salesman at Stockholm-based brokerage Alfred Berg UK Ltd.
"There's a big tradition for cross-border trade in
Scandinavia but the same doesn't hold for Denmark."</p>
<p>For stock-market investors, tapping into Danish takeovers
is made difficult by the exchange's makeup. Although Denmark
adopted a screen-based trading system two years ago,
eliminating dealing on the stock-exchange floor, there are
huge obstacles that make quick and easy settlement difficult.
Because of its substantial delivery problems, the Danish
market is "diluting potential foreign interest by having an
inflexible system which keeps a lot of people from thinking
about investing there," said Mr. Gregerson.</p>
<p>Part of the problem, say some Danish market watchers, is
the inability in practice to deal in short positions or take
up a role similar to the market makers and specialists in
London and New York. Because there are no guaranteed sellers,
getting hold of securities to cover short positions can be
costly, traders note.</p>
<p>In addition, takeover opportunities among Danish companies
are severely limited because many Danish businesses are
protected by two-tiered share capital, making it virtually
impossible to obtain a controlling interest in a company by
buying up only one class of its stock.</p>
