	<p class="article-leader">ST. LOUIS -- Thomas M. Gunn was named president of
McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. He succeeds William P.
Brown, who resigned last month in the wake of the company's
poor financial performance.
   Mr. Gunn, 46 years old, was most recently vice president
of program development at McDonnell Aircraft Co. The
helicopter company, based in Mesa, Ariz., and the aircraft
company, based in St. Louis, are units of McDonnell Douglas
Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Gunn has held various marketing, strategic planning
and government-affairs posts with other McDonnell Douglas
affiliates since joining the company in 1975. He also holds a
law degree. Mr. Brown, 57, has been a consultant to the
parent company since he resigned.</p>
<p>Last year, the helicopter company had a $137 million
write-off mainly related to the Apache program, which
accounted for about 80% of the company's revenue.</p>
