	<p class="article-leader">GORBACHEV'S GLITTER seems sure to fade further once the
summit ends.
   This week's superpower meeting may be the last in which
the Soviet leader holds undiluted power. He soon may have to
dump his prime minister, Nikolai Ryzhkov, as a scapegoat for
his widely criticized economic-reform plan. Already,
opponents are gunning for the post, with a view toward
sharing power.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Conservatives could have a candidate in fiery young
Leningrad party chief Boris Gidaspov, but many bet a
successor would come from among reformers. Contenders include
Moscow Mayor Gavriil Popov and Leningrad radical Anatolii
Sobchak. While Gorbachev's political reform plans are still
expected to prevail at July's Communist congress, his
weakened domestic clout threatens his party grip.</p>
<p>White House officials worry that Yeltsin even could
challenge Gorbachev's control of foreign policy.</p>
<p>BUDGET TALKS resume next week, but insiders expect little
progress.</p>
<p>Negotiators plan only a general survey of the entire
federal budget, and no hard bargaining is likely. Texas Sen.
Gramm describes the early sessions as "mind-numbing." Sununu
attends every session, but says little and reviews unrelated
paperwork. Without a crisis to prompt action, frets House
Budget Chairman Panetta, the talks could drag on.</p>
<p>Democrats want a five-year deficit-reduction package; the
longer perspective makes a cut in capital gains taxes less
attractive. Most negotiators lean toward excluding thrift
cleanup costs and the Social Security surplus from new
deficit calculations. Participants eye next week's California
gas-tax referendum for clues on whether voters are willing to
pay higher taxes.</p>
<p>BUSH WIELDS the veto weapon effectively -- so far.</p>
<p>He nixed 11 bills in his first 16 months -- more than
Presidents Carter and Reagan -- and Congress has yet to
override him. He outbluffs Congress by using the veto weapon
even against popular legislation, forcing lawmakers to strip
unwanted provisions. Aides warn that he won't be afraid to
torpedo a child-care bill he deems too costly.</p>
<p>But some veto threats start to sound hollow. The
administration backed away from a threat to kill the civil
rights bill, and its fulminations on the Clean Air bill
aren't believed. The White House fails to carry out a plan to
issue a line-item veto as a test of presidential authority.</p>
<p>Parental-leave legislation remains veto bait, but Bush's
threat to ax cabinet status for the Environmental Protection
Agency isn't taken seriously.</p>
<p>BUREAUCRATIC JOCKEYING between the White House and
governors is slowing work on new education goals. The
governors and the administration can't agree on how to set up
a bipartisan commission to measure progress toward achieving
the goals. At issue is how much influence the White House
will have.</p>
<p>GREENSPAN WORRIES that the credit crunch will spread
beyond real estate to other business loans, even though it
doesn't show up in overall bank lending data. "The anecdotal
evidence is so extraordinarily large," he says. The Treasury
ponders issuing a statement to show it is monitoring the
situation, but it worries about causing undue alarm or a
regulatory easing.</p>
<p>DEFENSE GAP: Defense chief Cheney completes his high-level
reviews of weapons systems and still refuses to seek major
weapons cuts. Lawmakers widely agree sharper reductions are
needed. But after his latest reassessment, Cheney continues
to champion Star Wars, the Army's scout helicopter, and the
Navy's Seawolf submarine.</p>
<p>MOMENTUM BUILDS to force a House vote on a constitutional
amendment to balance the budget. Backers of a petition to
force the amendment out of committee say they had 153
signatures when they filed the petition last week, and they
expect many more. They need 218 signatures.</p>
<p>DEMOCRATS' PROSPECTS brighten in gubernatorial races.</p>
<p>Strategists believe former Sen. Chiles, the decided
favorite in the Florida Democratic primary, can beat
Republican Gov. Martinez. Polls show Texan Ann Richards
gaining on gaffe-prone Clayton Williams, whose new handlers
make him less available to reporters. California Republicans
are uneasy; they worry especially that stylish Dianne
Feinstein will face staid Sen. Williams in the fall.</p>
<p>The GOP fails to find strong challengers to Democratic
incumbents in New York and Maryland, is still looking in
Tennessee and has given up in Nevada. But it takes heart at
embarrassing flaps surrounding Democratic candidate
Celebrezze in Ohio. Republicans target Arkansas Gov. Clinton,
who won only 54% of the vote in his primary.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Democrats grow more confident they'll capture
state houses in Maine, Rhode Island and Kansas, all currently
Republican bastions.</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: Fly America: Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, Trade Ambassador Hills and Commerce Secretary
Mosbacher took the Concorde back from a trade meeting in
Paris to make the state dinner for Gorbachev last night;
Agriculture Secretary Yeutter, who also attended the dinner,
left early and flew back on Pan Am. . . . Arguing for better
vocational education, Texas gubernatorial candidate Williams
says many students drop out of school "because they are bored
with Shakespeare."</p>
