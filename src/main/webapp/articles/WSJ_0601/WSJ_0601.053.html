	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Eurotunnel PLC may be seeing a glimmer of light
at the end of the tunnel.
   The Anglo-French consortium said its four lead banks
agreed on terms to lend an additional #2 billion ($3.39
billion) -- needed to cover still higher costs for the
beleaguered cross-channel link. In exchange for increasing
Eurotunnel's #5 billion credit lines to #7 billion, the banks
insisted that the company arrange standby underwriting for a
#530 million equity rights offering planned for this fall.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new financing arrangements clear a hurdle toward
completion of the tunnel project, which has been beset by
revised cost estimates, reworked funding arrangements and
disputes with its contractor consortium. Eurotunnel's
protracted difficulties have made investors skittish. Some
skepticism undoubtedly will linger until the latest financing
proposal wins approval this summer from the full consortium
of 208 banks backing the project.</p>
<p>"There have been a lot of doubts (about Eurotunnel) and
there will continue to be doubts as cost figures are
revised," said William Beazington, an analyst at Shearson
Lehman Hutton Securities in London. But with extra funding
apparently lined up, he added, "I might guardedly say that
now is the time to start considering buying" Eurotunnel
stock. In late trading on London's Stock Exchange yesterday,
Eurotunnel shares were off five pence at 543 pence ($9.21).</p>
<p>Eurotunnel yesterday raised the project's estimated cost
to #7.66 billion, citing higher inflation, higher interest
rates and lower projected revenues. That's up from its April
estimate of between #7.5 billion and #7.6 billion -- and way
above Eurotunnel's projected total cost of about #4.9 billion
set in 1987. Eurotunnel officials also said the project
likely won't pay a dividend until 1999, four years later than
initially expected.</p>
