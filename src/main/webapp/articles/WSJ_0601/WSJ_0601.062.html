	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. says it's
introducing the first answering machines that respond to
rotary-dial phones, making it easier for people to call home
or office to get their messages.
   Owners previously were limited to using touch-tone phones
or beepers when calling home for messages. The new answering
machines now have a human-speech synthesizer that responds to
a voice command to retrieve messages, getting around the
touch-tone problem.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The machines also are the first to store as many as four
different outgoing messages to callers, the company said. Two
models of the answering machine have two lines, permitting
one caller to leave a message while another is given a signal
to wait and then leave a message. AT&T said the two-line
models are designed for the growing number of households,
home offices and small businesses with two telephone numbers.</p>
<p>AT&T is introducing the machines at the Consumer
Electronics Show, which opens tomorrow in Chicago. Among
other products, the telecommunications giant is introducing a
two-line cordless telephone and a caller identification unit,
which can be used with caller identification services
provided by local phone companies. Users who have the local
service can use the Call Display 64 to view the numbers of
incoming calls. The unit stores the numbers and times of the
most recent 64 calls, whether or not they were answered.</p>
<p>Separately, AT&T Capital Corp. said it completed its
acquisition of Encore International Inc., a computer leasing
concern. Encore will operate under the name AT&T Systems
Leasing Corp., and current management will remain intact in
its Bloomfield Hills, Mich., headquarters, AT&T Capital said.</p>
<p>AT&T earlier this year divided its AT&T Credit Corp.
subsidiary into five business units and renamed it AT&T
Capital. The unit offers equipment leasing and financing
services for AT&T and non-AT&T equipment.</p>
