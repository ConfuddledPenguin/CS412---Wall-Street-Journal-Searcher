	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it rated a $100
million issue of Hertz Corp. medium-term notes triple-B,
noting that the car-rental company's U.S. rental operations
continue to face competitive pressures.
   "Although commercial pricing is improving gradually,
competition in the leisure market is expected to remain
intense this year," S&P said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The report said Hertz's competitive position should be
strengthened over time by fees being imposed on off-airport
renters at some locations and state laws forcing elimination
or advertising disclosure of separate collision damage waiver
charges.</p>
<p>Hertz was acquired by Park Ridge Corp. at the end of 1987;
Park Ridge is 49%-owned by Ford Motor Co., 26% by Volvo North
America Corp., 20% by Hertz management, and 5% by Commerzbank
AG.</p>
<p>S&P said, "Hertz's credit strength is limited by the need
to service acquisition debt at Park Ridge, and consolidated
financial measures are weaker than those for Hertz alone.
However, Ford's strategic interest in preserving the
financial health of its largest single customer provides
significant credit support. During 1989, Ford bought $150
million of Hertz subordinated notes, allowing repayment of a
like amount of Park Ridge acquisition bank loans and
increasing Ford's total investment."</p>
