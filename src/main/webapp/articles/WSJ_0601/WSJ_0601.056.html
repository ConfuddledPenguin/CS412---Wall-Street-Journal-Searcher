	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- United Asset Management Corp. expects
second-quarter earnings and revenue to be about the same as
the first quarter, when the company reported net income of
$4.3 million, or 26 cents a share, on revenue of $40.1
million.
   If results match the first quarter, UAM would be posting
gains above the 1989 second quarter. In that period, the
company had net income of $3.6 million, or 23 cents a share,
on revenues of $35.6 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>UAM President Norton Reamer, in an interview, said he
expects assets under management to reach a record high at the
end of May, of about $39 billion, up from $37.7 billion at
March 31.</p>
<p>Net asset growth is coming from market appreciation, and
not new invested funds. Mr. Reamer said customer cash flow --
or new cash added vs. cash taken out of portfolios -- was
negative so far this year, but only by about 1% to 2% of
portfolio assets.</p>
<p>"We're bucking the trend" of greater losses in the rest of
the industry, Mr. Reamer said. Because pension plans have
appreciated to a size larger than that required to pay future
benefits, employers have been net withdrawers from plans for
several years. UAM's portfolios are 60% invested in stocks
and 40% in fixed-income securities.</p>
<p>Mr. Reamer said he returned recently from Japan, where he
has been exploring UAM's interest in forming a joint
money-management venture with Japanese financial concerns.
UAM, which has acquired 22 money-management concerns since
1983, also is shopping for acquisitions, generally among
firms managing at least $300 million, in the United Kingdom
and on the European continent. Another sector where UAM hopes
to make acquisitions is U.S. money-management concerns that
specialize in foreign stocks and bonds or domestic real
estate, Mr. Reamer added.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to manage all asset classes in all parts of
the world," Mr. Reamer said. Acquisitions that would bring in
foreign clients and investments to UAM are a priority now, he
said because of "huge amounts of capital being generated in
Japan," and the desire by institutional investors globally to
expand the geographic diversity of portfolios. UAM currently
has negligible assets under management.</p>
<p>"Britain is the most logical shopping place," the UAM
president reckons, because a British purchase would kill two
birds with one stone -- bringing in new foreign customers and
assets invested outside the U.S. But UAM also has found
strong German and French bank interest in U.K
money-management concerns, bidding up prices for potential
buy-out candidates in London.</p>
<p>Mr. Reamer said he thinks UAM is capable of acquiring a
money-management concern with as much as $15 billion in
assets -- which would add nearly 50% to the company's current
portfolios. Asked whether he thought UAM would make an
acquisition before the end of 1990, he said "it would be
normal to expect that we would. We have a great appetite for
deals."</p>
<p>UAM wants to "strike an alliance" with a Japanese partner,
perhaps a trust bank or insurer, that will enable UAM to
manage a U.S. equities portfolio for the partner's customers.
Mr. Reamer said he believed that buying a Japanese money
manager isn't possible or desirable because of heavy market
concentration and cultural resistance to foreign ownership.
But he said that Japanese investors are beginning to show
greatly increased interest in the U.S stock market, providing
opportunities for U.S. managers.</p>
<p>In addition to its interest in getting foreign customers
and assets, UAM also continues to shop for U.S. money
managers. Mr. Reamer said many U.S. banks, under regulatory
pressure to raise capital, currently are interested in
money-management divestments. He said UAM had reviewed
several for purchase, but declined to identify them.</p>
