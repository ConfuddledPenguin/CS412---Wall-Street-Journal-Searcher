	<p class="article-leader">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Chips & Technologies Inc. said it
settled its trade secrets suit, filed in January, against
Elite Microelectronics Inc. and several former Chips
employees.
   The settlement involves no monetary payment, which Chips
had originally sought. Instead, the agreement stipulates that
an independent inspector make periodic visits to Elite's
facilities to be certain the company isn't using Chips' trade
secrets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The lawsuit had charged that former Chips engineers and
design managers, who went to work for Elite, were misusing
privileged information about their former employer's VLSI
semiconductors and chip sets.</p>
