	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Art-buying fever was chilly at Christie's
International PLC's auction house, as Rembrandt van Rijn's
"Saint Peter Repentant" failed to find a buyer.
   Bidding stopped at $9.5 million for the 17th-century
masterwork, which had, until recently, hung in the
Metropolitan Museum of Art on loan from its owner. The piece
had been expected to sell for $10 million to $15 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Overall, 43% of the 149 works offered did not sell. The
auction raised $8.1 million, vs. pre-sale expectations of $23
million to $33 million.</p>
<p>The mediocre results of the Old Masters auction appear to
dash hopes that that type of artwork will be the next "hot"
market now that prices for Impressionist and Modern paintings
seem to be leveling off, based on recent auction results. Art
dealers said concerns about authenticity of many Old Master
paintings are keeping collectors from that slightly more
affordable sector of the market.</p>
<p>The top lot of the Christie's auction was Pieter Brueghel
the Younger's, "A Peasant Wedding Feast." The colorful 1603
scene sold for $1.4 million, vs. a pre-sale estimate of $1.5
to $2 million.</p>
<p>Sotheby's Holdings Inc.'s Old Masters paintings sale is
scheduled for today. Up for sale are two views of Venice by
Il Canaletto. The pair is expected to bring about $10
million.</p>
