	<p class="article-leader">The Illinois Supreme Court ordered Commonwealth Edison Co.
to refund more than $300 million the Chicago utility
collected under an earlier rate increase designed to pay for
three nuclear plants.
   The court also ordered the utility to roll back current
rates to 1988 levels, an action that will cost Commonwealth
about $235 million in revenue annually.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It was the second time in six months the court dealt the
utility a major blow. In December, it ruled Commonwealth
couldn't implement a $245 million rate increase scheduled for
1990.</p>
<p>The latest order obligates Commonwealth to refund the
approximately $285 million it received under the 1989
increase -- as well as the funds collected to date in 1990.</p>
<p>The state court found that when the Illinois Commerce
Commission agreed to the rate rises, it "went beyond the
scope of its authority." The court also said the commission's
approval of the rise, which was designed to end a fight
between the utility and various public-interest groups,
represented an "illegal settlement."</p>
<p>The court remanded the case to the ICC for further
proceedings, including a determination of the exact amounts
to be refunded, and the mechanism for issuing funds to
customers.</p>
<p>Commonwealth said it hasn't taken any reserve to cover the
refund; an official said the company hasn't yet determined
whether it will take a charge to this year's earnings, or
possibly restate 1989 earnings, or a combination of both.
While the company said it is "committed to protecting our
dividends at current levels," and doesn't currently envision
trimming its payouts, the official said a final determination
won't be made until next month's board meeting.</p>
<p>Because "it doesn't appear that the legal case has much
life {left} in it," the spokesman said, the utility is
"unlikely" to appeal the matter further. He added, "We're
turning our attention to other avenues of rate relief."</p>
<p>Commonwealth in April asked state regulators for about
$982 million in rate rises, although it doesn't expect a
response before March 1991. Among the options the company
will now consider, the spokesman said, is a request for an
"emergency interim rate relief" while that request goes
forward, under legal provisions established to help
financially troubled utilities.</p>
<p>Commonwealth remains mired in regulatory problems
associated with its costly nuclear buildup, under which it
built a total of 12 nuclear plants that now provide 83% of
the utility's generating capacity.</p>
<p>Its latest request covers expenses associated with its
three newest plants. In addition, it is appealing an August
1989 state court order to repay customers about $250 million
in costs deemed "unreasonable" related to a fourth nuclear
plant.</p>
<p>Prudential-Bache analyst Barry Abramson said that the
court's order "does create more short-term financial pressure
on the company," but "doesn't alter the longterm financial
picture" for it.</p>
<p>He thinks the company could "justify the need for the
capacity" for at least a majority of the newest units to
regulators, eventually.</p>
<p>Aiding such a request, he notes, is the fact that
Commonwealth is "surrounded within a small radius by a dozen
utilities that are going to be impacted by clean-air
legislation," and might find it cheaper to buy Commonwealth's
excess capacity, than to refit their own coal-burning plants.</p>
<p>Taking into account the rollback and assuming the company
takes a charge in the current year for the refund, Mr.
Abramson is cutting his earnings projection for Commonwealth
to about $1.80 a share from $3.05. But he noted that until
the new plants get some kind of rate coverage, 1990 earnings
"aren't reflective of the company's true earning power."</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Commonwealth shares closed off $1.25, at $31.50.</p>
