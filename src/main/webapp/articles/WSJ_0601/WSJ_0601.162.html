	<p class="article-leader">British Gas PLC reported that net income on an
historic-cost basis for the year ended March 31 rose 3% to
#926 million ($1.57 billion) from #899 million a year
earlier, as gains from exploration and production activities
offset softened demand from the warm European winter.
   The historic-cost net, which values inventories at their
acquisition cost, was slightly below analysts' expectations,
ranging from #930 million to #970 million. On a current-cost
basis, in which inventories are valued at replacement cost,
net rose 9.7% to #680 million from #620 million. Earnings per
share increased 2.4% to 21.7 pence from 21.2 pence. Sales
rose 6% to #7.98 billion from #7.53 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chairman Robert Evans reiterated the company's commitment
to seeking opportunities beyond its traditional hold on the
domestic market. He cited the potential for British Gas to
develop natural gas reserves and distribution systems in
unserved areas globally. The company is in the midst of a 1.1
billion Canadian dollar (US$935.3 million) friendly takeover
bid for Consumers' Gas Co. of Canada, which is being
contested by a Canadian investor group.</p>
