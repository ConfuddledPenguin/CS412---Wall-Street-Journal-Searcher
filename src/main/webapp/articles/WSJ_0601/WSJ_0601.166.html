	<p class="article-leader">Carolco Pictures Inc. said a unit of Pioneer Electronic
Corp. of Tokyo agreed to buy a 10% stake in the Los Angeles
movie company and appoint two members to its board.
   Pioneer LDCA will pay $60 million for a new Series C
convertible preferred stock that will pay a 5% yearly
dividend until redeemed. The stock will be convertible into
3.24 million shares of Carolco common stock at $18.50 each, a
considerable premium to Carolco's close at $13 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pioneer LDCA also will buy a warrant entitling it to buy
300,000 Carolco common shares for $18.50 each. The agreement
grants the unit the right of first refusal to world-wide
rights to Carolco titles on laser disk format.</p>
<p>Peter Hoffman, president and chief executive officer, said
the transaction will help pay down some of the debt incurred
by Mario Kassar, Carolco's chairman, when he bought out his
partner, Andrew Vajna, last fall.</p>
<p>Carolco also said it signed an agreement with another
Pioneer unit, under which it will license all Japanese rights
to several new Carolco movies including "Terminator II" and
"The Doors."</p>
