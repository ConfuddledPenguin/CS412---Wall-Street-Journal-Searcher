	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Home Products Corp. named Bernard
Canavan president, strongly emphasizing its effort to focus
on health-care businesses.
   The 54-year-old Dr. Canavan, who has been executive vice
president of the parent and chairman of the Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories subsidiary, succeeds John R. Stafford, 52, who
continues as chairman and chief executive officer of American
Home.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a natural progression of events," said Ronald M.
Nordmann, analyst at Paine Webber Group Inc. Dr. Canavan "had
been there for over 20 years. He'd run the major
pharmaceutical operations of the company, and it sends a
signal that American Home Products wants to be recognized as
a {prescription} drug company rather than an over-the-counter
drug or consumer-product company."</p>
<p>American Home took a giant step in that direction in
mid-March, when it agreed to sell its Boyle Midway
consumer-product operations, which include prominent brands
such as Black Flag insect repellent and Woolite cleanser for
delicate fabrics, for $1.25 billion to Reckitt & Colman PLC
of the U.K. American Home said it expects to close that sale
shortly.</p>
<p>Dr. Canavan declined to comment on specific moves he plans
to make. But he said he aims to build American Home's strong
franchises in prescription and over-the-counter
pharmaceuticals and veterinary-care and hospital products.</p>
<p>Even with the focus on health care, American Home has no
plans to shed its foods division, which has "good consumer
brands and recognition," Dr. Canavan said. The division, with
some $900 million in annual sales, includes products such as
Chef Boyardee Italian foods and Pam antistick cooking spray.</p>
<p>American Home's 1989 sales were $6.75 billion.</p>
<p>Dr. Canavan's former positions at the parent and
Wyeth-Ayerst won't be filled. Fred Hassan, president of
Wyeth-Ayerst, will continue to report to Dr. Canavan. The
company's prescription-drug research and development
activities, which had reported to Dr. Canavan, now will
report to Mr. Hassan.</p>
