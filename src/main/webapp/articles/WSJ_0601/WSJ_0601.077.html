	<p class="article-leader">BURBANK, Calif. -- Tomorrow night a galaxy of stars and
movie moguls will be heading down the freeway to the Burbank
Studios for a black-tie wingding thrown by Warner Bros.
   Ronald Reagan, the star of more Warner movies than any
other actor now living, is supposed to be there, among the
many honored guests. Impresarios Steven Spielberg, David
Wolper and Jack Haley Jr. will fill two sound stages with
hundreds of singers, dancers and actors, who will do their
stuff for the thousand invited. And, as a finale to this
talent-intensive affair, the studio's water tower, covered at
the moment by a tarp, will, with great fanfare, be undraped
to display the famous WB logo -- white initials on a blue
shield -- which identifies every company property from Bugs
Bunny cartoons to the movie "Batman." Now the emblem will be
visible for miles.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After two decades of sharing the place with Columbia
Pictures, Warner is reclaiming the entire 140-acre sprawl,
originally acquired by the founding Warner brothers -- Harry,
Albert, Sam and Jack -- in 1928. This celebration of success
will also be a final, triumphant rebuke to Columbia's new
parent, Sony Corp., forced to vacate the premises as partial
settlement of the $1 billion breach of contract suit Warner
filed against the Japanese electronics giant for luring away
"Batman" producers Peter Guber and Jon Peters last year.</p>
<p>The Warner Bros. chairman, Robert Daly, and president,
Terry Semel, have much to celebrate this weekend. While the
Guber-Peters team must start from scratch at struggling
Columbia, Warner has just enjoyed one full year as the
box-office king of the movie business, thanks not only to the
caped crusader but to "Lethal Weapon II" and "Driving Miss
Daisy." Now that it has digested its 1987 purchase of
Lorimar-Telepictures Corp., Warner has also become a leader
in TV production and syndication, another gold mine for the
company.</p>
<p>But when the party is over, Warner Bros., for all its
recent flashy success, will have to face certain tough
realities. The studio is a unit of the highly leveraged giant
created by the merger last year of Warner Communications Inc.
and Time Inc. Record profit at Warner Bros. can hardly stem
its parent's losses, which amounted to nearly $1 billion in
1989. Time Warner doesn't expect to report a profit for
another two or three years.</p>
<p>And the studio's hot streak has barely registered on Wall
Street, where Time Warner shares have suffered from
skittishness about the company's $11 billion debt and the
looming prospect of federal regulation in its cable
television business. Though the stock has rallied to its
current $105.875, it recently had traded at half its 52-week
high of $182.75.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. itself can't yet count on the success of its
plan to back Pathe Communications Inc.'s $1.2 billion
purchase of MGM/UA Entertainmnent Co. Warner has agreed to
guarantee a $650 million loan to Pathe in return for
distribution rights to the MGM/UA film library, but Pathe
must still come up with another $400 million or more to close
the deal. This is a mixed blessing for Time Warner. Standard
& Poor's has the company's long-term public debt on its
CreditWatch list, having concluded that the arrangement with
Pathe could increase Time Warner's "already substantial
financial risk."</p>
<p>Still, given the explosion in global demand for
American-made TV programs and movies, Warner Bros. is in
position to become the foremost distributor of filmed
entertainment in the world. The studio says the merger hasn't
had any effect on its plans: It can expand without dipping
into Time Warner's resources, without significant risks and
without diminishing its own cash flow.</p>
<p>If all that's true, Warner Bros. will bolster Time
Warner's claim that crushing debt won't keep it from becoming
a global media and entertainment colossus. With the studio's
reputation and its library of movies and TV shows as a lure,
Time Warner is looking for expansion capital from outside.
According to Time Warner's chairman, Steven J. Ross, the
company is discussing joint ventures, partnerships, and even
the sale of minority stakes in Warner Bros. and other units.</p>
<p>"We've been inundated with proposals from companies all
over the world who would like to be partners in our various
businesses," Mr. Ross says. But he says Time Warner has the
cash flow to cover its debt payments, so would-be partners
must bring something to the party -- like access to an
overseas movie or TV distribution operation.</p>
<p>Currently the most prolific of Hollywood's seven major
studios, releasing 20 to 25 movies annually, Warner Bros.
aims to nearly double its output by acquiring distribution
rights to films produced by others in the U.S. and elsewhere.
Not only did the company get real estate from Sony in its
settlement of the Guber-Peters matter, it also made a deal to
distribute all of Columbia's movies to cable TV. Warner
already distributes all of Walt Disney Co.'s movies outside
the U.S.</p>
<p>The MGM/UA transaction would give Warner's high-volume
distribution strategy yet another boost. Warner -- which
already distributes United Artists movies on videocassette
overseas -- would get a 15% fee for distributing the 1,000
existing United Artists movies and any new films produced by
Pathe in all markets world-wide. And the film library would
be collateral: Should Pathe default on its loan, Warner could
end up owning films valued at $1.2 billion for about half
price.</p>
<p>Quite apart from the Pathe arrangement, says Mr. Semel,
"there are plenty of big and small independent producers who
need . . . help in marketing and distribution." Warner is the
only U.S. studio that fully controls all of its own
distribution operations world-wide. And, says Mr. Daly, "the
more {movies} we service through that organization, the
better off we are."</p>
<p>Warner's voracious appetite for movie rights impresses and
worries observers. "Warner knows that software is king," says
Sumner Redstone, chairman of theater chain National
Amusements Inc., which has an 84% stake in Viacom Inc. He
thinks Warner may yet be challenged on antitrust grounds by
other studios, "but I don't think that will stop them."</p>
<p>Mr. Redstone and other Warner watchers agree that the
studio has one particular advantage in realizing its plans: a
stable executive team in an industry in which constant
management turnover is the rule. Mr. Daly, 53, and Mr. Semel,
47, have together run Warner Bros. for nearly a decade, with
the support of Mr. Ross through good times and bad. Planning
requires continuity, he says, and a willingness to make
short-term sacrifices for the sake of the long haul. "Bob and
Terry . . . know they are going to be around for a long
time," says Mr. Ross.</p>
<p>Warner decided to sacrifice the short term with the
purchase of Lorimar. Write-offs of some of Lorimar's troubled
operations forced the studio to restate its $203 million 1988
operating income as an $82 million loss. But Messrs. Daly and
Semel knew Lorimar was strong in the one business Warner
hadn't been able to crack: first-run TV syndication, the sale
of programs directly to TV stations. Warner and Lorimar,
merged, became the world's largest distributor of TV
programming, licensing over 13,000 hours of shows in more
than 100 countries and in a dozen languages.</p>
<p>With the likes of "Murphy Brown," "China Beach," "Life
Goes On," "Full House," and "The Hogan Family," Warner will
have about 20 series on prime-time television in the fall.
And Warner continues to milk profits from Bugs Bunny and
other Looney Tunes characters, sold to TV and otherwise
licensed and merchandised. In collaboration with Mr.
Spielberg, Warner is gestating "Tiny Toons," a new generation
of characters (Buster and Babs Bunny, for instance).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in the movie business, hitting a grand
slam like "Batman" was a fresh experience for the Daly-Semel
regime. But Warner Bros. had hit enough "singles and
doubles," as Mr. Daly calls them, to rank it first at the box
office four years in the past 10. While Warner enjoys its
current pre-eminence, the studio knows it will be difficult
to match a year in which "Batman" alone grossed more than
$250 million in the U.S. Mr. Daly insists the company would
be satisfied merely to be "consistently profitable."</p>
<p>Warner learned the pitfalls of bankrolling too many movies
a decade ago, adds Mr. Semel, when it put up money for movies
produced by Orion Pictures and the Ladd Co. "That was a hard
business to be in -- we were like the bank, footing the bill
for three different companies," Mr. Semel says. "Ten years
later we are saying, why bother having two or three different
labels of films that we fully finance? What we'd really like
to do is make the movies every year that we really believe
in, and finance as many of those as we care to or can, then
take on these servicing or distribution deals."</p>
<p>Even when it helps finance production of a movie, Warner
is known for cutting deals that limit its risk. Messrs. Daly
and Semel say they will occasionally acquire a movie
expecting it to lose money at the box office, if, for
example, their international home-video executives believe it
can turn a dollar in that market with the aid of publicity
from a theatrical release.</p>
<p>That strategy has definitely produced some box-office
dogs. Last year Warner Bros. released 18 less than memorable
films, including 10 clinkers inherited from Lorimar. So it
wasn't all "Tango and Cash" and "National Lampoon's Christmas
Vacation," two of its hits last year. That doesn't mean they
lost money. "We may have 10 movies that add up to nothing
from a domestic theatrical standpoint, but we can make it up
in all the other ancillary markets," Mr. Daly says.</p>
<p>"Driving Miss Daisy" is a case of underestimating the
potential of a film -- and cleaning up in the process.
Producers Darryl and Lili Zanuck were rejected by every other
studio they approached when they said they wanted to make a
$12 million movie based on the play about an elderly Southern
Jew and her black chauffeur. Warner persuaded the moviemakers
to prune their budget back to $7.5 million, and agreed to put
up $5 million of that for the domestic film rights. "We saw
it at the time as a good little movie for America, but we
were concerned about the potential overseas," Mr. Semel says.
British producer Jake Eberts agreed to put up the rest of the
budget in return for the foreign rights.</p>
<p>To everyone's astonishment, the film was a hit in its
early, limited release. That spurred Warner to put the movie
into more theaters and to throw its famous marketing muscle
behind it. In the end, Warner spent almost three times as
much to market and expand the release of the movie as it did
to produce it. The tactic paid off. "Driving Miss Daisy" has
sold more than $100 million in tickets so far and is still
going strong after winning Academy Awards for best picture
and best actress.</p>
<p>While Warner has a reputation for being a tough
negotiator, it can also throw some money around when it wants
to. It has a fleet of planes and helicopters and a house in
Acapulco that it puts at the disposal of stars, producers and
executives. And the autonomy and job security Mr. Daly and
Mr. Semel evidently enjoy enable them to take the long view
with creative types that Mr. Ross of Time Warner takes with
them. Thus they get high marks for loyalty and patience.
"They are as supportive in failure as they are in success,"
says Mr. Spielberg, whose Amblin Entertainment has put out
hits ("Gremlins") and misses ("Empire of the Sun") for
Warner. "There have been thin moments when they have stood by
us when other companies might have been quick to move on."</p>
<p>Clint Eastwood, for example, has made his last 19 movies
at Warner, without anything resembling an exclusive contract.
Warner produced Mr. Eastwood's successful "Dirty Harry"
movies but also backs him in less-commercial efforts like
"Bird" and his current "White Hunter, Black Heart." Says Mr.
Eastwood: "Like any studio, they like to make movies that
make money. But I've never found them resistant to long-shot
projects that might not be commercial now but that they might
be proud to have in their library 10 or 20 years from now."</p>
<p>Mr. Eastwood is an asset Warner appreciates. Though he has
never produced a blockbuster, his action films do respectable
business in the U.S. and overseas, and are profitable because
he brings them in on time and under budget. He is getting
rather long in the tooth (yesterday was his 60th birthday) to
appeal as an action hero to young moviegoers. Perhaps for
that reason, Warner is pairing him with the youthful Charlie
Sheen in a new movie, "The Rookie," betting the chemistry
might be similar to the Dustin Hoffman-Tom Cruise pairing
that made a hit of "Rainman."</p>
<p>Warner does have strong contractual relationships with a
range of Hollywood talent: Richard Donner, who directed the
two "Lethal Weapon" movies; comedians Chevy Chase and Dan
Aykroyd; and former Columbia chief David Puttnam, who made
"Chariots of Fire" and "The Killing Fields." Still, Hollywood
rivals bet the loss of Messrs. Guber and Peters will hurt
Warner's output, and they note the company has lost out in
recent efforts to make long-term deals with hot producers.</p>
<p>For example, Warner was one of the studios competing for
the services of James Brooks, who had produced "Terms of
Endearment" and "War of the Roses." He took the highest bid,
from Messrs. Guber and Peters at Columbia. And even after
their experience with "Driving Miss Daisy," the Zanucks
decided to move their production company to Paramount, where
they have a longstanding relationship with studio boss Frank
Mancuso. David Geffen's movie company, long with Warner
exclusively, will terminate that arrangement at the end of
this year.</p>
<p>Messrs. Daly and Semel say there are few producers in
Hollywood who won't work for Warner Bros. for the right price
and in the right project. Even when talent goes elsewhere,
Mr. Daly insists, they don't burn their bridges. Mr. Geffen,
for example, who recently sold his record company to MCA
Inc., is among the richest people in Hollywood. He says he
doesn't need the money that an exclusive arrangement can
bring and doesn't like to be tied down, unable to make a
movie he wants to make for a rival studio. But he says he
will continue to make movies at Warner "because I have a good
relationship with them and they are gracious and easy to deal
with."</p>
<p>Warner executives currently play down the loss of Mr.
Guber and Mr. Peters, noting that the two made only one or
two movies a year for Warner -- and none that came close to
the success of their movie "Batman," to which Warner owns all
sequel rights. (In the settlement with Sony, Warner won
assets it values at more than $600 million, which just might
be more than Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters could have earned for
Warner Bros. over the life of the contract they broke.)</p>
<p>Mr. Daly and Mr. Semel did very well personally in the
Time-Warner merger, thanks to Warner's stock and option
plans. They reportedly have cashed in their chits for about
$50 million apiece. Power is more heady in Hollywood than
money. Still, some people wonder whether with all their
money, these two will be inclined to work their exhausting
schedules. In addition to running the studio, Mr. Daly is
leading Hollywood's fight against the networks in Washington
over rerun rights; Mr. Semel recently held business meetings
in six Eastern European countries and hit the Cannes film
festival while also negotiating with Pathe over MGM/UA.</p>
<p>Mr. Daly dismisses the idea that he and Mr. Semel don't
need to work so hard anymore: "If we were the kind of people
who wanted to retire and play golf, we wouldn't have been
here in the first place."</p>
