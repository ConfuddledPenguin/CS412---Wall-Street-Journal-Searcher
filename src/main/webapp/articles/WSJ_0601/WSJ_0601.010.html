	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Salomon Inc. offered a novel way for investors
to bet on a rise in Belgian share prices without the
complications of dealing on the Brussels Bourse.
   The New York-based investment banking firm offered 500,000
warrants representing a basket of six blue-chip Belgian
shares at 283 Belgian francs ($8.17) each, or a total of 142
million Belgian francs ($4.1 million). Such share warrants
have proliferated in several other European countries in
recent years, but bankers here said they believed Salomon's
issue was the first of its kind in Belgium.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Each 100 warrants represents the current value of two
shares of Barco N.V., one of Bekaert N.V., one of S.A.
Cimenteries CBR, four of Delhaize "Le Lion" S.A. Belgium,
three of Petrofina S.A. and two of Solvay & Cie. Based on
yesterday's share prices, the warrants are priced at a
premium of 18.6%. That means that, if the warrant is held for
its full 18-month life, the value of the underlying shares
would have to rise at least 18.6% to make it profitable for
holders.</p>
<p>The warrants can be exercised from June 29, 1990, through
Nov. 29, 1991. They will be listed on the London and
Luxembourg stock exchanges. The issue is being distributed by
Salomon's London investment banking unit as well as Dumenil
Leble Bank (Belgium) S.A. and Banque Bruxelles Lambert S.A.</p>
