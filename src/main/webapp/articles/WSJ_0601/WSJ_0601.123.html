	<p class="article-leader">A LOAN FROM SOUTH KOREA</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>South Korea is considering making a $4 billion loan to the
Soviet Union, news reports in Seoul said.</p>
<p>The Hankook Ilbo newspaper, quoting unidentified
government sources, said the Soviet Union has requested $5
billion at low interest rates, but South Korea wants to offer
$4 billion in government and bank loans. The Chosun Ilbo
newspaper didn't give any figures but said the government is
considering extending loans to help the Soviet Union make
payments for purchases of South Korean goods.</p>
<p>The loan reports came as South Korean President Roh Tae
Woo prepared to meet Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in San
Francisco on Monday and South Korea's Samsung Group signed an
agreement with Soviet authorities to cooperate in various
telecommunications projects including high-definition
television.</p>
<p>A report by the South Korean news agency Yonhap said South
Korean companies doing business with the Soviet Union, China
and other communist nations are faltering due to delayed
payments and a worsening business environment.</p>
<p>TAX CHANGE FOR FRANCE?</p>
<p>The French government is studying the possibility of
increasing taxes on long-term capital gains by corporations,
Economics Minister Pierre Beregovoy indicated. Asked whether
he favored a uniform corporate-tax rate of 33% for reinvested
profits and long-term capital gains, Mr. Beregovoy said "that
might not be a bad idea." French businesses are now taxed at
a rate of slightly less than 20% on most long-term capital
gains.</p>
<p>NORTH PACIFIC DISPUTE</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has lodged protests with the North Korean
and Japanese embassies in Moscow over salmon poaching in the
north Pacific, Soviet diplomatic sources said. In its protest
to the Japanese Embassy, the Soviet Foreign Ministry
expressed "deep displeasure" with what it called continued
cases of "malicious poaching," the sources said. They said
one protest came over the recent seizure of six Japanese
fishing boats in Soviet-claimed waters off the island of
Sakhalin in the north Pacific.</p>
<p>SAVING FUEL IN CUBA</p>
<p>Cuba's communist government is introducing fuel-saving
measures in 45 major industrial companies to reduce
consumption of oil, most of which is imported from the Soviet
Union. The official Communist Party daily Granma said the
measures would initially save 150,000 tons of oil a year.
Cuba imports annually nearly 13 million tons of oil from the
Soviets, but President Fidel Castro has warned Cubans to be
prepared in case events in the Soviet Union lead to a cutting
off of the fuel lifeline.</p>
<p>TV VIOLENCE IN AUSTRALIA</p>
<p>The Australian government moved to reduce the violence
shown on television, particularly in news programs. Transport
and Communications Minister Kim Beazley said he supported a
recommendation in an Australian Broadcasting Tribunal report
on television violence that the television industry draw up a
uniform code on how to treat violence. The report said there
was widespread worry about the repetition of violent images,
close-ups of blood and intrusion on grieving people.</p>
<p>SOVIET-TURKISH MEDICAL ACCORD</p>
<p>Turkey and the Soviet Union signed an agreement calling
for the exchange of medical experts and Soviet purchases of
medical equipment and drugs from Turkey. Under the agreement,
the Soviet Union would buy $200 million of medicine and
medical equipment from Turkey during the next two years.
Turkey also planned to open a credit line of $500 million to
the Soviets for construction of health facilities in that
country.</p>
<p>WHO VS. SMOKING PARENTS</p>
<p>Stepping up its campaign against tobacco use, the World
Health Organization warned that parents who smoke put their
children's health at risk.</p>
<p>Smokers' children have more respiratory infections than
those whose parents do not smoke, WHO said in a report
marking its annual World No-Tobacco Day yesterday. Studies
showed that a child living at home with tobacco-addicted
parents was exposed to exhaled smoke equivalent to 80
cigarettes a year, or the nicotine of a quarter of a
cigarette per day, the WHO report said.</p>
<p>"In some developed countries, if all women stopped
smoking, fetal and infant deaths would drop by approximately
10%," the United Nations agency said.</p>
<p>Juan Roberto Menchaca, the Cuban physician who is head of
the agency's tobacco program and who is credited with
persuading President Fidel Castro to give up his Havana
cigars, said the number of people who smoked was dropping
annually by 1.1% in industrialized countries but increasing
by 2.1% in the developing world. "This is due in part to
advertising aimed at the young," Dr. Menchaca said.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Train traffic throughout Belgium yesterday was disrupted
by the start of a two-day engine drivers' strike. Air-traffic
controllers at Brussels' international airport were set to
start intermittent strikes today. . . . Blessing the Rome
stadium where the World Cup soccer final will be played, Pope
John Paul II noted that modern sport was threatened by "an
obsessive search for wealth, commercialization, doping and
other forms of fraud and violence."</p>
