	<p class="article-leader">COLUMBIA, S.C. -- A federal bankruptcy judge approved the
sale of the PTL television network for $7 million to Morris
Cerullo World Evangelism, a San Diego-based ministry.
   Morris Cerullo's ministry, which has operations in Canada,
Mexico, Brazil, Britain and the Philippines, among other
sites, also has made a $45 million offer for the balance of
PTL's assets, including 2,200 acres of land, and a hotel and
theme park.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>PTL's founder, Jim Bakker, was convicted of numerous
federal fraud charges in connection with the operations.</p>
<p>Morris Cerullo World Evangelism said it intends to operate
the complex, known as Heritage Village Church and Missionary
Fellowship Inc., as a family resort. The TV network, it said,
will be run as a 24-hour-a-day, family-oriented, global
satellite network.</p>
<p>Dennis Shedd, a court-appointed trustee for the PTL
ministry, said the bankruptcy court is expected to consider
the offer for the balance of the estate in about a month,
after proper notice is given to the parties.</p>
<p>The sale of the network is subject to the approval of the
license transfer by the Federal Communications Commission.
The trustee said the buyer placed $7 million in escrow to
cover the purchase.</p>
<p>A rival bidder, Oral Roberts University, had offered about
$6.3 million to $6.45 million for the TV network, which
includes production facilities and a satellite lease, Mr.
Shedd said. He added that only Morris Cerullo had made an
offer for the balance of the failed religious empire.</p>
