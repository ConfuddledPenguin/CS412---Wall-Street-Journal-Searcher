	<p class="article-leader">OSLO -- Norway's unemployment rate was 3.9% at the end of
May, down from 4.2% at the end of April but up from 3.5% a
year earlier, Arbeidsdirektoratet, the government's labor
agency, said.
   The jobless rate peaked at 4.7% in January, when 101,900
people were out of work. The May total was 84,800 -- 52,200
men and 32,600 women -- down 6,700 from one month earlier but
up 8,500 from a year earlier. The rate data excluded 45,600
people employed in extraordinary state work programs, down
4,800 from last month and up 9,300 from 12 months earlier.</p>
