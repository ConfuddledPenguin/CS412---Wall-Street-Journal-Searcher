	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- As change sweeps East Europe, many of America's
biggest companies have been debating how to tap a potential
market of 140 million people.
   Talk now is turning to action.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In recent weeks, nearly a dozen American corporations have
announced multimillion-dollar investment programs in the East
bloc. Some of America's biggest companies are involved,
including General Motors Corp., Dow Chemical Co., Eastman
Kodak Co., S.C. Johnson & Son Inc. and Xerox Corp.</p>
<p>The projects chiefly are of two types: marketing ventures
-- with or without local partners -- to establish domestic
sales organizations, or more-ambitious joint ventures for
local manufacturing.</p>
<p>The opening of Eastern Europe "is a major, significant
move," says Edwin Buehlmann, American Express Co.'s senior
vice president, Eastern Europe. The financial-services
company already markets dollar-denominated charge cards in
several East bloc countries and plans to spend $2 million
more this year to open travel centers in Budapest, Prague,
Warsaw and East Berlin. General Motors is investing more than
$150 million in the region and last Friday announced an East
German car-making venture and its second Hungarian production
investment. GM's strategy is to gain "a foothold in the
market," says spokesman Ron Theis.</p>
<p>The best barometer of U.S. investment objectives is the
Washington-based Overseas Private Investment Corp., a U.S.
agency that provides political-risk insurance to U.S.
companies abroad. James Hall, a spokesman, says there has
been "an explosion" in new registrations for East bloc
investments, primarily in Hungary and Poland. OPIC is now
processing insurance requests for 100 investment projects
valued at a total of $1.5 billion, up from 45 projects valued
at $500 million at the end of 1989, Mr. Hall says. OPIC also
has received feelers for an additional $500 million in
investments, he says.</p>
<p>Of course, pitfalls abound. Enthusiasm about inexpensive
East bloc labor is tempered by problems of supply, quality
and currency convertibility. Instability in such areas as
Romania and the Soviet republics places a big question mark
over the safety of investments. Some executives, mindful of
previous disappointments in China, believe it may be years
before Eastern Europe becomes a lucrative market.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many companies are investing now in order
not to miss an opening. "The initial, few large deals were
opportunistic. Now, you are seeing the results of people
having done some market research, and acting to fulfill a
strategic plan," says Colin Berry, a London-based director at
investment bankers Morgan Grenfell Group PLC. He has seen
particular East bloc interest among telecommunications
companies and such hotel chains as Marriott, Hyatt and
Intercontinental.</p>
<p>Three sorts of U.S. investors dominate East European
activity. The first is the U.S. multinational, more than 40
of which joined an OPIC investment mission to Hungary and
Poland last month, including Olin Corp., Marathon Oil Co.,
Warnaco and TRW Inc. The second category is ethnic, companies
led by people who have East European family ties. The third
category is small or medium-sized businesses that find
special expertise, as well as cost advantages, in East
Europe.</p>
<p>An example of the latter category is Erie Scientific Co.,
a Portsmouth, N.H., maker of laboratory glass that opened a
microscope-slide venture in Budapest in March. Frank
Jellinek, president, says Erie cut its average wage costs 90%
from a comparable unit it operates in West Germany, with no
loss in quality because of the skills of Erie's Hungarian
glassmaking joint-venture partner. The venture took less than
six months to organize and was profitable in its first
quarter; Erie plans to double the size of the $1 million
investment.</p>
<p>Major recent U.S. investments include:</p>
<p>-- General Motors is investing more than $150 million in
two Hungarian ventures to make engines, wiring assemblies and
vehicles. The auto maker also said last Friday it plans to
start building Opel models in East Germany this year. The
East German operation, a joint venture with Automobilwerke
Eisenach, is the first step in GM's plan to increase European
capacity by 25% by the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>-- S.C. Johnson, the Racine, Wis., consumer-products
company, is spending "tens of millions" of dollars on
expanding its East bloc sales and manufacturing efforts, says
Gianni Montezemolo, vice president for new markets. Johnson's
biggest project is a planned manufacturing joint venture in
the Ukraine, with about 500 employees, to supply the Soviet
and East European markets with such brand-name products as
Pledge and Raid.</p>
<p>Johnson has several East bloc sales offices and has been
importing its products from factories in Holland for 20
years. But the company concluded that Eastern Europe "is a
big market. You need to manufacture locally," says Mr.
Montezemolo.</p>
<p>The company, along with other East bloc manufacturers,
faces tough problems including quality control, absenteeism
and differing working practices. At Johnson, plans call for
additional training for new workers. The company is already
working to instill Western working practices. For example,
after months of grappling with inefficient responses to phone
calls or telexes by Soviet staff, Johnson "made a rule that
whenever we send a communication, they have to acknowledge
it, even if is to say that nothing has happened," says Mr.
Montezemolo.</p>
<p>-- Dow Chemical, Midland, Mich., is spending $16 million
to build a plastic-foam insulation plant adjacent to an
existing chemical plant on Hungary's Lake Balaton, about 60
miles outside Budapest. The plant, a joint venture with
Hungary's state chemical company Nitrokemia and Chemolimpex,
the state chemical-marketing organization, is scheduled to
come on stream in the first or second quarter next year, says
William E. Cornelius, Dow's director of trade policy.</p>
<p>Dow's plans for a $1 billion Soviet plastics plant have
been stalled by recent political uncertainty in the Soviet
Union. Some Western experts say Moscow increasingly wants big
projects to be based in the Russian republic, rather than in
independence-seeking outlying republics. In the meantime, Dow
is content to focus on beefing up local staff in its East
bloc sales and marketing arms. Its East European sales
currently total $300 million annually.</p>
<p>-- Among other companies, Xerox's U.K.-based Rank Xerox
office-equipment affiliate expects to spend about #11 million
($18.7 million) over the next 18 months boosting sales and
service operations in Eastern Europe. The company sees sales
growing to #200 million annually in five years from #50
million, a growth rate that won't be seen "anywhere else in
the world," says David Thompson, Rank Xerox's executive
director.</p>
<p>Eastman Kodak has set up Hungarian and Polish
film-processing works and is expanding such operations in the
Soviet Union. And consumer-products maker Procter & Gamble
Co. is trying to set up local marketing operations.</p>
