	<p class="article-leader">HSINCHU, Taiwan -- Bobo Wang was a rising young star at
Xerox Corp. when he decided to pick up his computer chips and
start a company here. The Taiwanese government was happy to
oblige.
   It gave him low-interest financing and tax incentives. It
also set him up in a Silicon Valley-clone industrial park
between the capital city of Taipei and the two best
engineering schools. The park has cheap rent, clean water,
dependable electricity and even a bilingual school for
children, on winding streets with names like Innovation Road
and R&D Road.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The help paid off. Several months ago, the company Mr.
Wang founded, Microtek International Inc., scored a coup. It
hit the market with a device that feeds both black-and-white
and color photographs into a computer -- a boon for desktop
publishers because it's almost like getting two machines for
the price of one. Not only did it get to the market ahead of
the Japanese, but the scanner sells for less than half the
price of a comparable Japanese product.</p>
<p>By the time Japan's Sharp Corp. scrambled its version onto
the market, Microtek was far ahead. The result: In about six
months, little Microtek sold 11,000 of the $2,700 scanners --
more than Sharp will probably sell in a year.</p>
<p>Microtek is an example of the new Taiwanese economy --
moving from imitation to innovation. The past generation of
Taiwanese businessmen were content to copy existing products
of the West and Japan. With cheap labor, a weak currency and
an export-or-die philosophy, they made Taiwan famous for
cheap knock-off electronics, toys and tennis shoes. Now that
economic conditions are shifting, Taiwan's industry is
quickly pushing into high-technology products that sell
because of their sophisticated features, not just lower
prices.</p>
<p>Its move is being closely watched in the Pacific Rim.
Newly industrialized nations such as South Korea have
neglected innovation -- and now they fear they won't be able
to make the transition. They are examining the Taiwanese
model of government support for entrepreneurs and
engineering.</p>
<p>At Microtek, Robert Hsieh, head of office automation
products, spends much time traveling abroad to industry
conferences and workshops, where he listens for new-product
ideas in the conversations and complaints of computer
hobbyists, newsletter editors and office managers. He also
encourages his staff to leave Taiwan and find new things. An
American-educated image-processing expert, Mr. Hsieh keeps a
small staff of technical people in the U.S. to watch trends
in research and consumer behavior. "We feel it when something
exciting comes along," he says.</p>
<p>And they're prepared to take advantage of those feelings.
"We move fast," says Mr. Hsieh. "Japan has committees,
committees and committees to decide something. We can jump
right on things because all I need is one signature."</p>
<p>Taiwan's new attitude was the result of some brutal
realities. Wages are up 40% since 1986, and the New Taiwan
dollar has been up as much as 50% against the U.S. dollar. No
longer low-cost producers, companies were faced with raising
prices overseas or cutting profit margins.</p>
<p>But the Taiwanese have turned the situation to their
advantage, forcing themselves to change the way they do
business. They are moving toward high technology and
higher-value products. "The only solution is to add value to
our products," says Stan Shih, chairman and chief executive
of Acer Group, Taiwan's leading computer maker.</p>
<p>Microelectronics Technology Inc. was making components for
microwave receiving equipment; now it makes complete systems
for ships -- and a portable unit that weighs just 65 pounds.
Inventa Electronics Co., which made almost-disposable
calculators, now builds personal computers as well as clocks
and telephones. Kennex International Corp. is designing
high-end sporting goods. And Vidar-Sun Moon Star Co., which
used to produce electronic parts, now makes mobile phones and
digital microwave radios.</p>
<p>Taiwan's governmental and private R&D spending has doubled
in just five years, to about 50 billion New Taiwan dollars
($1.8 billion). About half of that is spending by the
government, which often funnels money to research projects
that can be shared by many small companies, such as
artificial intelligence software or computer chip design.</p>
<p>The government encourages the substitution of machines for
workers; that costs about $35,000 an employee initially, but
the government estimates the payback comes in two years. It
is also letting labor-intensive and low-tech factories close
or move offshore. "We are responding to the reality," says
Frederick F. Chien, chairman of the Council for Economic
Planning and Development, a cabinet-level post. "The
high-growth days are over."</p>
<p>That's relative, of course. Taiwan still expects annual
growth of about 7% -- down from an average of 7.9% in the
1980s, but more than double a level that would be considered
excellent in the U.S. Exports are expanding vigorously, 9.3%
last year and probably more than 8% this year, thanks to the
shift to higher-value products. Per capita gross national
product will hit $8,500 this year, making Taiwan one of the
most affluent Asian lands.</p>
<p>Taiwanese companies also are starting to buy into the U.S.
A Taiwanese business and government consortium recently
bought Wyse Technology Inc. for $156.7 million. Companies
that hardly anyone outside Taiwan has heard of are buying
small Silicon Valley concerns, as well as hotels like the
Mandarin Oriental in San Francisco (for $60 million) and even
eight insolvent Texas savings and loans ($37 million).</p>
<p>The movement of investment offshore, about $4 billion in
the last two years, is invigorating the economies of
Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. An additional $1 billion
has leaked to mainland China, which is still officially at
war with the Nationalist government on Taiwan.</p>
<p>Korea, impressed with the Taiwan model, is setting up a
science park for entrepreneurs and is studying ways to
attract engineers, particularly Koreans in the U.S., to start
their own small companies in Korea. Seoul says it will invest
$5.89 billion over three years in R&D. "We have to develop
the tendencies such as you find in Taiwan," says Kim
Chong-In, the Korean president's top economic adviser.
"Korean entrepreneurs are not so good at adapting to
technological change. We have to become more flexible and
adaptive."</p>
<p>Taiwan isn't out of the woods yet. With a population of
nearly 20 million and small, albeit rich, companies, Taiwan
will find it hard to compete against giants in the U.S.,
Europe and Japan. Its companies lack experience and name
recognition. Revenues and profits are soft during the
transition. Says Mr. Chien: "This is a very exciting period,
but it is also a very dangerous period."</p>
<p>One advantage for Taiwan is that its economy has been
built largely by small entrepreneurial companies that can
change quickly. "To be successful you don't have to be the
biggest, you have to be the fastest," says Klaus C. Wiemer,
president of TSMC, Taiwan's largest computer-chip maker.</p>
<p>That is certainly Microtek's strategy as it finds niche
products to exploit. And how this company has succeeded shows
how Taiwan's policies jump-started its high technology.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, a Taiwanese immigrant to the U.S., developed a
device called a micro in-circuit emulator (MICE). It enabled
a computer programmer to debug a program at the same time the
basic instructions for the program were displayed.</p>
<p>He could have started a company in the U.S. to develop and
market the MICE, but following the trend of thousands of
educated Chinese-Americans, he and four other young engineers
and entrepreneurs headed for Taiwan in 1980.</p>
<p>The Microtek MICE -- smaller and cheaper than any other
debugger -- got to the market before U.S. or Japanese
competition. It proved a hit and the company was profitable
within two years. Mr. Wang plowed 35% of the first year's
$200,000 in revenue into R&D. Since then, the level of
investment has never dropped below 10%. He started hiring
engineers from Taiwan and the U.S., many of them
Chinese-Americans who once worked for Xerox.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, the company had a ready pool of engineers to
choose from. Taiwanese are well-educated. Some estimates say
almost 10% of Taiwan's work force has engineering training;
Taiwanese schools turn out about 10,000 engineers a year.</p>
<p>With 30% of Microtek's 435 employees assigned to R&D, the
company came up with other niche products. It makes
computer-controlled machine tools and the software to run
them. And it now is building its scanners in the U.S. for the
U.S. military. Slip a special board of computer chips in the
computer -- Microtek makes that, too -- and you can shoot
documents from one office to another, bypassing photocopier
and facsimile machines. Next up: Multi-function machines that
will be able to copy, scan, print and fax.</p>
<p>Smallness can help innovation, but it has its decided
disadvantages. With sales of only $38.39 million last year,
Microtek can't possibly invest like a Xerox or Canon, which
are aiming at the same objective. So it recently formed joint
ventures with small U.S. and Japanese companies to develop
new products, such as a new kind of printer called a photon
page printer, which uses light to print. Another joint
venture will work on an optical "mouse" for computer control.
Yet another will develop software for processing images and
technology that compresses the data of images into smaller
space.</p>
<p>Acer, Taiwan's premier personal computer maker, is taking
a similar tack. With sales of slightly less than $1 billion a
year, Acer can easily be muscled by competitors and
suppliers. So it teamed with National Semiconductor to
co-design and sell devices to build processors for personal
computers. It joined Texas Instruments to build dynamic
random access memory chips so neither company is at the mercy
of the Japanese and Koreans, who control most of the world's
chip supply. Acer is also buying companies in the U.S. and
Europe to expand its sales network.</p>
<p>A steady stream of merger and acquisition specialists
troop into the office of Mr. Shih, the CEO. Their proposals
now sit in a foot-high stack on his desk. "Merger and
acquisition activity is on the increase," says Alvin H. Tong,
executive vice president of Acer and a former IBM executive.
"People are starting to realize that we have money."</p>
<p>That's good, because Taiwan still needs a lot of outside
help. "They don't have the sophistication to be a player in
the world market," says Mr. Wiemer of TSMC, the chip maker.
It doesn't help that few people outside Taiwan have ever
heard of any Taiwanese company -- and even inside Taiwan only
about 35 companies say they have recognizable brand names.</p>
<p>Acer, which shipped about 400,000 personal computers
around the world last year, is probably the best known name
of all the Taiwanese companies. But even then, maybe a few
thousand Americans and Europeans recognize it. Mr. Shih,
Acer's founder, changed the name in 1988 from the
undistinctive Multitech in hopes of building recognition.
"The big limitation is brand recognition and marketing
expertise," he says.</p>
<p>That said, there is an air of optimism now in Taiwan.
"Every industrialized country has encountered these problems
and overcome them. I don't think that we will have any reason
not to overcome them, too," says Yang Shih-Chien, an economic
ministry official. "Maybe it is more cost-effective to solve
all the problems at the same time."</p>
