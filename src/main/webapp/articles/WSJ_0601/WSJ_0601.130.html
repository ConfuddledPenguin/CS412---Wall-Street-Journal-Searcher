	<p class="article-leader">After seven months of concerted pressure from AIDS
activists, Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. has agreed to expand access
to its experimental drug dideoxycytidine (DDC).
   The plan, approved yesterday by the Food and Drug
Administration, allows expanded access in the form of an
"open-label safety study," which means that recipients will
be carefully monitored for safety and toxicity of the drug.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement is "purely a result of activism, of our
pressing and begging," said Jesse Dobson, a San Francisco
member of Act Up, an AIDS activist group. The program, set to
begin on June 25, is a port of last resort for people who
can't take other antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>Roche, based in Nutley, N.J., is a U.S. unit of the Swiss
pharmaceutical giant, Roche Holding Ltd.</p>
<p>Despite a tough, adversarial tone in the negotiations
between activists, the company and the FDA,, Roche's
assistant director of public policy, Paul Oestreicher, said
yesterday, "We think this is good news."</p>
<p>Eligible patients will include people with AIDS and
advanced AIDS-related complex (ARC), who either can't
tolerate or failed to improve while taking the drug AZT made
by Britain's Wellcome PLC, or DDI made by Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. Roche estimates 1,000 to 2,000 people may fall
into this category.</p>
<p>Some activists criticized the plan as too restrictive.
"The way they've planned it, as a last resort for people
who've failed AZT and DDI, it's guaranteed to help almost no
one. These patients are all but unrecoverable," complained
Martin Delaney of Project Inform, a San Francisco activist
group.</p>
<p>However Roche says the caution is necessary due to DDC's
past history of toxicity -- a painful neuropathy or nerve
damage to the feet.</p>
<p>"It's a balance between safety concerns and compassion,"
said Whaijen Soo, director of the clinical virology program
at Roche. Admission, he said, will be expanded gradually from
50 patients in the first month, to 200 patients in the first
16 weeks. Thus, he said he hopes to limit the drug's main
toxic side effects.</p>
<p>"This is a very sick population," he explained. "In
addition, they have been primed with two other toxic drugs,
AZT and DDI," a fact that he said might magnify DDC's
toxicity. Moreover, Roche's move follows an uproar over
expanded access of the drug DDI to very sick patients whose
death rate prompted renewed scrutiny of such giveaway
programs in academia and in the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>Thus, only doctors who have experience in the use of DDC
will be allowed to administer the drug at first, followed by
doctors with experience in treating AIDS. Only when four
months of safety data are collected on the first 100 patients
will the program be opened up to all eligible patients.</p>
<p>Pressure to open up DDC's distribution began last
November, when James Driscoll, a San Francisco activist,
began trying to help two friends who were among a group of 20
patients at this city's Ralph K. Davies Hospital. "They
failed AZT and DDI, and have advanced AIDS," he explained,
orchestrating a media campaign and eliciting intervention
from the local Roman Catholic archdiocese.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, studies of DDC's effectiveness had been under
way for months, and its dose has been slashed to one-sixth of
the original level to bring toxicity under control. When
first tested, Dr. Soo said, patients received an average
daily dose of 12 milligrams, and "Everybody at that dose
would develop painful peripheral neuropathy." Occasionally
the tingling pain and numbness was intense, irreversible, and
required heavy narcotics to control the pain.</p>
<p>Now, the average dose is two milligrams a day, and
incidence of neuropathy has shrunk to about 10%. "It is also
milder and reversible, if you detect it early," Dr. Soo said.</p>
<p>However, he said doctors should remain vigilant, watchful
for early signs of toxicity. "That's why we wanted to start
with experienced physicians, to balance the enthusiasm of the
patients," he explained. He offered a sobering case history
to underscore his point.</p>
<p>"We have a flight attendant {taking the two milligram
dose} who developed early signs of neuropathy -- tingling in
the soles of his feet," Dr. Soo said. "He should have told
his physician right away, but he decided to hide it. He
continued to work, walking and standing. Unfortunately, the
condition progressed and now he requires narcotics. Now the
condition will be more difficult to reverse."</p>
<p>Activists like Mr. Dobson acknowledge desperate patients
may try to minimize side effects "when they know they're on
their last antiviral."</p>
<p>Still, he contended, "Whether DDC does {some good} for
patients is less an issue than the fact that they're in a
desperate place, and should be allowed to take this risk. It
is a risk we acknowledge."</p>
<p>Roche has one of the highest profiles of any major
corporation in the field of AIDS drug development. In
addition to DDC, its AIDS portfolio includes experimental
drugs to inhibit the viral TAT gene and the viral protease,
an enzyme that is part of the AIDS virus. It also has a major
stake in AIDS diagnostics using the PCR or gene-amplification
technology. Through its proposed merger with Genentech Inc.
of South San Francisco, Roche may gain control of yet another
therapeutic drug known as CD4.</p>
<p>"Roche is going to be a very big player in AIDS," Mr.
Dobson said. "That's why we want to be in their board room
when they talk to the FDA."</p>
