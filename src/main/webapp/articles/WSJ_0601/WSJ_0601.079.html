	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In the wake of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
collapse, the New York Stock Exchange is tightening up its
rules regarding member firms' and floor traders' capital.
   The Big Board has proposed a rule requiring written
notification within 24 hours of any transaction between a
broker-dealer and its parent that reduces broker capital by
20% or more.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When Drexel collapsed in February, it was disclosed that
its parent company, Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., had
been raiding the broker-dealer's capital to stay afloat after
the parent became unable to get short-term financing. The
Drexel situation disturbed regulators.</p>
<p>The Big Board now also wants its specialists, or dealers
on the floor of the exchange who are assigned to make markets
in individual stocks, to notify the exchange in writing
within 24 hours when their net liquid assets drop by 20% or
more.</p>
<p>The rule changes have been filed for approval with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
