	<p class="article-leader">What an example of killing the messenger. Your April 23
article "`Tracking' of Minority Pupils Takes Toll" shines the
spotlight on the outrageous differences in percentages of
white students vs. minority students in high-achievement
classes in schools throughout the country. The article
deduces (I assume a reflection of the Rand Study deduction)
that, because there are so many more minority students in
low-achievement groups, tracking should be abolished because
it is racist policy.
   But the tracking is only the barometer, not the cause, of
the discrepancies among students' ability to learn.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>You point with horror to the fact that in many schools
tracking of students begins as early as kindergarten. As a
parent involved in an integrated public-school system for
eight years, I feel qualified to report that the differences
in a child's ability to learn are every bit as pronounced in
kindergarten as they are in high school.</p>
<p>By eliminating tracking or by trying to make tracking the
villain of a painful scenario, what do we accomplish?
Education designed to serve the lowest common denominator?</p>
<p>Instead, let us address all of our energies and resources
toward the soul of the problem. Let us commit ourselves to
early-childhood programs, mentoring programs, programs for
teen-age parents and dropouts, and every other creative
approach available to combat the conditions that are keeping
minority children prisoners of their own fates.</p>

<p>I spent 30 years teaching students ages 11 to 15. In my
opinion, the main reason for poorly educated students is the
propensity of the educational bureaucracy for mixed-ability
classes. Forcing students to take a course when they do not
have the prerequisite knowledge is a cruel and insidious way
of perpetuating segregation. Yet it happens daily in the name
of desegregation.</p>
<p>Until the people who control our schools learn to use
objective measures of achievement (not ability) and to group
students accordingly, we will continue to have such problems
as low self-esteem and a high dropout rate.</p>
