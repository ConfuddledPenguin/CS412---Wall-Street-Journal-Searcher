	<p class="article-leader">I appreciate the attention given to our environmental
activities in your April 23 article "Salamander Draws Fire
From Developers."
   The salamander pond on the Bridgewood, N.Y., parcel was
found without prior knowledge of a proposed subdivision. As
to the statement "No one was there to witness the find," I
was accompanied by James Ash, a noted Long Island naturalist.
The salamander was kept in a refrigerator to duplicate the
outdoor temperature at that time of year. Southhampton town
officers verified the find the following day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The issue of balancing the needs of developers and
endangered species is an urgent global problem. As a
businessman, I understand the need for a responsible balance
between economic necessity and environmental protection.
However, once a species is extinct, any possibility for
balance is lost forever.</p>
