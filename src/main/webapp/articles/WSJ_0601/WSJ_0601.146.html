	<p class="article-leader">Adobe Systems Inc., Mountain View, Calif., filed suit
against Electronics for Imaging Inc. in federal court
Wednesday, seeking a court declaration that it hasn't
infringed on an EFI patent for color printing systems.
   In January, EFI accused Adobe of infringing on the patent
and the two software companies began negotiating the dispute.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In response to the suit, EFI, a San Bruno, Calif.-based
firm that develops color printing for desktop publishing,
said it will file a counterclaim, charging Adobe with
infringement. EFI holds the license to the color-printing
patent from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>EFI contends that Adobe is using the patented process in
its PostScript Level 2 software with color extension. An
Adobe spokesman called EFI's allegations "completely without
merit."</p>
