	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A California court dismissed a lawsuit that
would have forced Pfizer Inc. to notify about 60,000 people
that they had received a potentially defective artificial
heart valve.
   In March, Public Citizen, a consumer group associated with
Ralph Nader, filed a lawsuit in state court in Los Angeles
asking that Pfizer's Shiley subsidiary be required to contact
valve recipients, advise them of the valves' history of
defects, and pay for medical consultation and psychological
counseling. Pfizer has argued that the recipients should be
told about the valve by their doctors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ruling, by Los Angeles superior court Judge Ronald M.
Sohigian, is the latest in a series of lawsuits related to
the Shiley-Bjork convexo-concave heart valve that have cast a
shadow over Pfizer, raising questions about the size of its
financial liabilities stemming from the valve.</p>
<p>Pfizer's announcement of the court's decision buoyed the
company's shares, which closed at $65.875 a share, up $2.25,
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.</p>
<p>Pfizer said the court ruled that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration regulations pre-empt California state law
regarding medical devices. Although the FDA has ruled that
patients should be advised about the valve's potential
problems by their doctors, it is holding hearings to consider
whether to change its position.</p>
<p>Pfizer has told the FDA that 394 of 85,000 heart valves it
sold world-wide between 1978 and 1986 are known to have
failed because of the fracture of a particular part. The flaw
has resulted in 252 reported deaths. The two models in
question are Shiley's 60-degree and 70-degree convexoconcave
Bjork model heart valves. The FDA banned the use of one model
in 1986; the company also stopped selling the other model.</p>
<p>In its suit, Washington-based Public Citizen charged that
despite the problem, neither Shiley nor Pfizer has directly
alerted recipients of the valves or their personal doctors.
The consumer group said people ought to be advised of the
symptoms of a failing valve in order to have it treated
quickly.</p>
<p>Brian Wolfman, a Public Citizen lawyer, said the court's
ruling was "wrong," noting that California law can require
direct patient notification despite the FDA position.</p>
<p>He said the group will appeal the court's decision.</p>
<p>Steven Kany, a Pfizer lawyer, said the company believes
that most, perhaps all, valve recipients already know about
the valve's problems from their doctors, or from news stories
and advertisements by product-liability lawyers. Moreover,
"Public Citizen knows that we don't have the names of about
half the people who received the valves," Mr. Kany said,
"That is known by the doctors who implanted the valves or
treat recipients."</p>
<p>The issue of notification may become more important
pending the outcome of another lawsuit by a woman who is
seeking damages from Pfizer due to anxiety about the valve's
performance. In early May another California court ruled that
the recipient can sue Shiley even though her valve hasn't
failed.</p>
