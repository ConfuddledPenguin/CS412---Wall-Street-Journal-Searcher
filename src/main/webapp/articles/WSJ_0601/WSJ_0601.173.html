	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Jack R. Meyer, the Rockefeller Foundation
treasurer picked to oversee Harvard University's $5 billion
endowment, is careful not to confuse his investing skills
with the bull stock market.
   When Mr. Meyer joined the Rockefeller Foundation in 1983,
a decade of inflation had cut the real value of the
foundation's assets in half. In the following seven years,
the foundation's assets more than doubled to $2.1 billion,
even while the foundation gave away $500 million in grants.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Meyer attributes that record to "a lot of good luck
and a little skill" during history's greatest bull market
run. But Mr. Meyer also did far better than other
institutional investors during the run-up: the foundation
earned an average of 19.5% a year on its assets in the five
years ended Dec. 31, compared with 16% a year for the average
institutional fund during that period.</p>
<p>As expected, the 45-year-old Mr. Meyer was named to become
president of Harvard Management Co., the investment arm that
manages Harvard's endowment, the biggest of any private
university in the U.S.</p>
<p>He will assume the post Sept. 1, succeeding Walter Cabot,
who has been Harvard Management's president since its
formation in 1974. Mr. Cabot will remain with Harvard
Management "on a part-time advisory kind of role in the
private placement area," according to Harvard University
Treasurer D. Ronald Daniel.</p>
<p>Mr. Daniel rejected speculation that Mr. Cabot, who missed
several months of work in 1989 because of a heart attack, was
being forced from his post following subpar investment
returns last year, when the Harvard endowment missed much of
the stock market's 31.7% increase. "If he had not had that
heart attack, he would still be there" as president, Mr.
Daniel said of Mr. Cabot.</p>
<p>Mr. Meyer has a reputation as an aggressive money manager
who led the Rockefeller Foundation into areas such as short
selling and index arbitrage. He said he is leaving the
foundation for the professional opportunity offered by
Harvard Management, which has more than double the assets and
15 times the investment staff of the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>
<p>"Harvard Management is not broken, so it isn't my job to
fix it," said Mr. Meyer. "It's clear they didn't have a good
1989, but they are solidly in the first quartile {of returns
for institutional investors} over the last five years," he
said.</p>
<p>Harvard Management was a pioneer among big institutions in
nontraditional investments, spending more than $1 billion, or
20% of the overall fund, on such areas as venture capital,
oil wells and leveraged buy-outs. Its $70 million commitment
to the buy-out fund of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., is the
largest by any endowment.</p>
<p>These private investments, whose true value can be
difficult to determine, have been controversial. "I'm pretty
uneasy about having 20% of the endowment in illiquid
investments," said money manager John Train, a Harvard
alumnus whose book, "The New Money Masters," includes a
chapter on Harvard Management.</p>
<p>Mr. Daniel said Harvard Management looked at hundreds of
candidates for its presidency before a list of four finalists
was prepared. The job is considered one of the most
prestigious in the money-management industry. Among those
turning down a request to apply was Peter Lynch, the famed
portfolio manager who is retiring from Boston-based Fidelity
Investments.</p>
<p>Mr. Meyer, a graduate of Denison University and Harvard
Business School, was New York City deputy comptroller before
joining the Rockefeller Foundation. His duties included
overseeing $20 billion of city pension funds.</p>
<p>Previously, he worked at the Wall Street firms of Lionel
D. Edie & Co. and Brown Brothers Harriman & Co.</p>
