	<p class="article-leader">Setting the stage for a big battle with advertisers,
Capital Cities/ABC announced a new plan for setting ad rates
that virtually factor out recent declines in audience
ratings.
   Under the complex plan, ABC is attempting to limit the
audience guarantees it usually promises advertisers. With
audience levels shrinking, the networks have been forced to
make good on those guarantees by giving advertisers free
commercial time. Under the new plan, a falling audience level
will no longer in itself ensure that an advertiser gets free
time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposal immediately drew fire from advertisers and ad
agency executives. "This is unconscionable, it's a ridiculous
proposal. You're going to have a lot of resistance to this,"
said Steven Sternberg, a vice president at ad agency Bozell.</p>
<p>With its plan, ABC is attempting to save itself money
while transforming the business of buying television ad time
-- a leap all three networks are hoping to make this season
following another year of disappointing ratings. Typically,
the networks guarantee advertisers that their programs will
reach a certain number of viewers. If the ratings fall below
the levels guaranteed by the networks, the networks must make
up the difference with additional free commercial time,
called "makegoods."</p>
<p>The problem the networks have with the traditional system
is that this TV season, according to A.C. Nielsen, viewers
have been deserting the networks in droves. In the first half
of this year alone, TV executives estimate the value of
makegoods at the three networks reached $150 million to $200
million.</p>
<p>The networks insist that decline is just plain wrong, and
blame a bug in Nielsen's measurement system, which was
changed from a diary method to a people meter system three
years ago. ABC's plan, which compares current ratings with an
average of the three previous years, attempts to factor out
the declining overall audience. "We shouldn't be responsible
for their measurement problem," says John Abbattista, an ABC
vice president. "We're trying to get this yolk off our
shoulder that Nielsen has put on it due to the inconsistency
in their measurement."</p>
<p>But advertisers aren't buying the plan. While the networks
insist Nielsen's measurement system is faulty and largely to
blame for the shrinking audience, the advertisers contend
Nielsen's figures are just fine. And they say the plan has
virtually no upside for them, basically taking away from them
the eyeballs that they paid for -- and deserve. "The declines
in the first quarter are real, they aren't phony," says
Bozell's Mr. Sternberg.</p>
<p>The other two major networks are expected to follow with
plans of their own to change the longstanding practice of
guarantees, while neutralizing the Nielsen declines. NBC
executives couldn't be reached, but at third-ranked CBS,
Jerry Dominus, a senior vice president, said: "We certainly
aren't happy just accepting the existing system, so we're
looking for something that would be more representative of
true performance. I'm not sure we know what it is yet." Fox's
fledgling network, meanwhile, has said it will stick with the
standard guarantee system.</p>
<p>The mishmash of different approaches promises to wreak
havoc when the so-called upfront buying spree, during which
advertisers buy ad time for the fall season, kicks off in the
next few weeks. Advertisers and agencies say they'll deal
with the mess largely by ignoring it, and by attempting to
negotiate separate deals on their own terms.</p>
<p>"As far as I'm concerned, everything in the network
business is essentially open to discussion," says Philip
Guarascio, executive director of advertising for General
Motors, perhaps the largest prime-time advertiser. He adds
that if ABC or any other network changes the terms of buying
ad time, "then those terms have to be offset in another way .
. . a prudent advertiser will seek some compensation. It's as
simple as that."</p>
<p>ABC's complex plan is based on the fact that, after 15
years of steady increases, the number of homes using TV as
measured by Nielsen began declining in 1987. ABC contends
that, since Nielsen has been unable to adequately explain
that decline, ABC shouldn't be held accountable for it. The
new plan attempts to factor out the decline altogether. ABC
is "trying to take responsibility for the underdelivery if
it's attributable to our program performance," but not for
shortfalls that result from Nielsen's "measurement problem,"
says ABC's Mr. Abbattista.</p>
<p>The plan calls for ABC to offer the standard guarantee of
a certain number of viewers in a particular age group
watching a program. Where it differs from past years, though,
is that it uses a calculation involving the number of people
using TV. If the number in a given month differs from the
average of that figure for the previous three years,
adjustments are made accordingly.</p>
<p>Under the plan, for example, if the number of people using
TV declines from the average of the previous years, ABC won't
have to offer makegoods to an advertiser unless a particular
TV program's ratings shortfall is bigger than the decline in
people using TV. So, if an advertiser buys time on
"thirtysomething" and the show's rating is 5% below the
guarantee, but the people-using-TV figure is off 6% from
previous years, the advertiser gets nothing.</p>
<p>ABC's plan attempts to offer an upside to advertisers,
too. If the people-using-TV figure increases above the
previous years' average, for example, ABC will offer
makegoods to advertisers in some cases. But advertisers
scoffed at that part of the plan, saying the people-using-TV
figure, which has been trending steadily downward, is
unlikely to climb above the three-year average. "There's no
doubt" the measurement won't increase, claims Bozell's Mr.
Sternberg. ABC "knows that's not going to happen."</p>
<p>Bozell, among other ad agencies, has studied Nielsen's
system and concluded -- not surprisingly -- that the audience
declines it shows are accurate. The American Association of
Advertising Agencies last week came up with the same
conclusion following a two-year review. A spokeswoman for
Nielsen, meanwhile, said, "We've examined our system and
found no evidence that the system is contributing to declines
in viewing. Ultimately, it's the buyers of advertising that
will have to decide the validity of ABC's proposal."</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>PRAVDA AD: The Twin Cities Gorbachev Visit Committee, a
group coordinating the Soviet leader's brief stay in
Minnesota this Sunday, has taken out an ad in Pravda with the
headline "Welcome." The ad, which was created by
Minneapolis's Campbell-Mithun-Esty agency, also features a
Russian translation. The copy at the bottom of the ad: "Thank
you, Mr. Gorbachev, for visiting our state."
Campbell-Mithun-Esty, a unit of Saatchi & Saatchi, said the
ad is the first U.S.-produced ad to appear in Pravda.</p>
