	<p class="article-leader">First Bank System Inc. agreed to sell a 16.7% stake to an
investor group for $175 million in a move to increase its
capital base and speed the banking concern's recovery.
   At the same time, John F. Grundhofer, First Bank's new
chairman, president and chief executive officer, said that,
following a "thorough review" of the loan portfolio, a $390.6
million reserve for loan losses was "adequate." One of the
big uncertainties hanging over First Bank's depressed stock
price since Mr. Grundhofer was hired four months ago has been
whether he would make another big addition to the reserve
after going through the loan files.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Grundhofer said yesterday that he hopes his positive
review, along with the commitment of a Lazard Freres &
Co.-sponsored investment fund to buy a big stake in First
Bank would begin to re-establish the company's credibility.</p>
<p>First Bank has been hurt by big bond and loan losses in
recent years, as well as from a management strategy that
didn't emphasize the Minneapolis-based concern's big market
share in consumer banking in the upper Midwest.</p>
<p>The Lazard fund, Corporate Partners, would put up $145
million, and one of the investors in the fund, the State
Board of Administration of Florida, would put up $30 million.
Together, they would buy 12.6 million newly issued First Bank
common shares at $13.875 each; that price was agreed during a
due-diligence period when First Bank's average price was
$13.50, the company said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, First Bank common closed at $14.50, off $1, on
volume of 334,200 shares.</p>
<p>The sale would increase First Bank's shares outstanding to
about 75.4 million from 62.8 million, but because of tax
benefits the company has and its relatively modest profit,
the higher number of shares wouldn't immediately cut into
per-share profit much. "A few cents a share this year," said
Richard A. Zona, chief financial officer, adding: "It will be
more as the earnings pick up."</p>
<p>First Bank had first-quarter profit of $28.5 million, or
37 cents a share.</p>
<p>First Bank said Lester Pollack, the Lazard partner who
manages the fund, approached the banking concern about the
investment. Another so-called friendly, minority stake fund
also approached First Bank, but it preferred the terms
offered by Mr. Pollack.</p>
<p>A public sale of stock didn't seem feasible. "Most of our
investment banking friends were not very optimistic," Mr.
Grundhofer said.</p>
<p>The private placement of the stock is subject to Federal
Reserve Board approval, which First Bank expects could take
about 45 days.</p>
<p>As part of the investment, the Lazard fund would designate
a nonvoting "observer" to First Bank's board. The fund
couldn't raise its stake beyond 150% of what it would be
under this investment, couldn't launch a proxy fight, and
couldn't sell more than a 5% stake to another single
investor.</p>
<p>The investors also would get what Mr. Grundhofer called
"disaster scenario" warrants that would help protect their
investment should First Bank's stock, or its net worth, not
live up to expectations, or should its dividend be cut or
omitted.</p>
<p>The money will boost First Bank's common equity-to-assets
ratio to 4.8% from 4%, as of March 31, on a pro forma basis.
That will make it a lot easier for the company to expand its
consumer banking business, which is Mr. Grundhofer's
priority. He said the stock sale was better than having to
sell some businesses to raise capital.</p>
