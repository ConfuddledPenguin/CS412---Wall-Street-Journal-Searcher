	<p class="article-leader">CARACAS -- Perhaps the most famous hotel in this city is
known for its beautiful white tower on top of the Avila
Mountain overlooking the valley of Caracas. However, the
hotel -- connected to the city only by cable car -- does have
a problem: It has stood empty for more than a quarter of a
century, a constant reminder of the virtues of government
planning.
   The last military dictator of Venezuela, Gen. Marcos Perez
Jimenez (no kin of the current president, Carlos Andres
Perez), was responsible for getting the state involved in
many grandiose investment projects. The most infamous of
these include the disastrously inefficient iron and steel
complexes, the nationalized telephone company (formerly
British-owned) and a chain of hotels that has been losing
money for more than 30 years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now, in keeping with world trends, President Perez has
announced intentions to "privatize" hotels and and other
state holdings. But even though practically everyone is
convinced of the inefficiency of state-run enterprises, there
are ominous signs that genuine privatization may not be just
around the corner. Start with the example of the state
telephone company.</p>
<p>The state takeover of the telephone company was perhaps
the most tragic and costly nationalization project, in terms
of slowing down economic development. During working hours it
is practically impossible to call Valencia, the main
industrial city, just 100 miles to the southwest of the
capital. According to a World Bank study leaked to the
Venezuelan press last month, less than 50% of all local calls
are completed, while only 30.4% of intercity and 20.6% of
international calls, in turn, get through. That means that
you have to dial an average of five times before reaching
your overseas number. In some areas of the capital, you
automatically get a busy signal even if the person you are
calling is not using the phone. The obsolete exchanges in
those areas simply cannot handle the volume.</p>
<p>To get a new phone is a difficult task indeed, requiring a
combination of money, patience and shrewdness. There are four
ways to get a phone installed in Venezuela: (1) Place an ad
in the local newspaper, offering to pay $1,000 or more for a
number; (2) stop the first phone-company truck you see in the
street and negotiate with the crew; (3) get a cellular phone
and pay outrageous rates; (4) fill out an application and
wait from one to five years, visiting the phone office
periodically to replace lost forms.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a fifth way, but this one requires
you to be a member, in good standing, of the "nomenklatura":
Just call the Communications minister or the president's
private secretary and you will have a telephone within days.
And, if you are important enough, tapping is added at no
extra cost.</p>
<p>In 1988 -- the last year for which figures are available
-- the Venezuelan Telephone Co. (CANTV) lost $22 million on
revenues of $210 million. In all, CANTV would seem an
excellent candidate for privatization.</p>
<p>However, two recent public announcements spell trouble for
privatization efforts: (1) CANTV's president proudly
disclosed that a decade-old debt with AT&T had been paid and
soon Venezuelans in the U.S. will be able to call home
collect (they can now do so); (2) a telephone-union official
said that the company would be privatized "over my dead
body."</p>
<p>The CTV, Venezuela's equivalent of the AFL/CIO, is the
backbone of President Perez's ruling party, Democratic
Action. In the face of growing dissension between government
officials and party officials over economic policy, it is
extremely important for both groups to enjoy union support.
Thus, telephone privatization may well have to take a back
seat to politics for some time.</p>
<p>The hotel-privatization plan is a very different matter.
It has the enthusiastic backing of the CTV, ruling party
members and the executive branch of government. Only the
political opposition, the independent unions and the
Federation of Tourism Chambers are against the deal.</p>
<p>However, the plan can be described as "privatization" only
in a surrealist, corporatist sense, conforming to the
traditional Latin American "menage a trois": big government,
big business and big unions. Crony capitalism, by another
name.</p>
<p>In 1987, a "privatization" law was passed. And while not a
single company has been sold in three years, it allows for
creative new ways to bleed the country. This law allows the
sale of state assets without public bid, if labor groups,
unions or cooperatives buy at least 30% of the company or
assets being sold by the government.</p>
<p>Under such a convenient law, a deal to sell three of the
state-owned hotels came to the surface last fall. The hotels
in question are three of the better ones: the Barquisimeto
Hilton, the Melia Caribe and the Melia Puerto La Cruz. The
purchaser is Traemel, a joint venture of the Spanish group
Melia (49%), a CTV labor-federation subsidiary (40%) and
Inversiones 42309 (11%). (Since the registry has run out of
corporate names, new companies often choose a number as an
official name.)</p>
<p>Inversiones 42309 was incorporated 15 months ago with a
$600 capitalization, and it is owned by one of the principal
partners of the local Baker & McKenzie law firm, the reported
deal-maker. The terms were very sweet indeed, even by
standards applied to friends of the party: 10% down, a
three-year grace period, and 20 years to pay at an 8%-9% rate
of interest, when recent rates in Venezuela have fluctuated
between 31% and 48% (in face of last year's 81% inflation and
a 30% estimate for the current year).</p>
<p>After intense public criticism of the deal, the government
ordered a new appraisal of the hotels and is demanding
payment in cash. However, union participation must remain at
the same level. Traemel has the right of first refusal or
must come up with the money by June 30. Melia, the Spanish
connection, already has offered to lend the union its share
of the purchasing price, supposedly to be paid back from
future profits.</p>
<p>This means that Melia is buying 49%, but paying for 89% of
the deal, which can be explained either by Melia's deep love
for labor unions, or by the fact that it is getting such a
good bargain for its share that it wants to avoid the highly
inconvenient alternative of a public bid. Any criticism of
the deal is rejected outright as anti-labor. But, of course,
no common laborer is going to benefit from this or has any
chance of staying at one of the three luxury hotels; it is
only the union bosses who will be able to afford bigger
yachts.</p>
<p>This is privatization, Venezuelan style.</p>
