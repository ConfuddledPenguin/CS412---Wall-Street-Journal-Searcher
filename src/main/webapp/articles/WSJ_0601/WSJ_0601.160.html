	<p class="article-leader">Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., the leading shipbuilder in
Japan, posted a 25% increase in unconsolidated pretax profit
for the fiscal year ended March 31 to 17.17 billion yen
($113.4 million) from 13.77 billion yen a year earlier.
   Net income rose 55% to 12.35 billion yen, or 9.28 yen a
share, from 7.97 billion yen, or 5.99 yen a share. The
improvement allowed the company to resume its dividend, at
five yen a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales grew 5.9% to 812.81 billion yen from 767.07 billion
yen, owing to strong growth in the three largest divisions.
Sales rose 8.1% to 236.44 billion yen in the aircraft and
jets division, 23% to 190.67 billion yen in the machinery
unit, and 17% to 151.96 billion yen in consumer products. But
steel structure sales declined 12% to 124.25 billion yen.
Increased attention to profitability continued to buffet the
shipbuilding unit, where sales dropped 19% to 42.17 billion
yen. But shipbuilding orders for the year soared 181%,
reflecting boosted demand for Japanese ships amid rising
prices in competing nations. The company had 153.11 billion
yen in orders at the end of March.</p>
