	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration is investigating complaints that rear seats in
1986-89 Chrysler minivans may collapse and eject passengers
during accidents.
   The agency on May 7 began a preliminary evaluation, its
lowest-level investigation, of the vans after receiving six
complaints alleging that the seats had failed in three
accidents, resulting in four injuries and the death of a
two-year-old Pennsylvania boy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The investigation, which was made public by the Center for
Auto Safety and confirmed by the NHTSA, covers Dodge Caravans
and Plymouth Voyagers. The Center for Auto Safety, a consumer
group, said that one million minivans were covered by the
inquiry, but NHTSA couldn't confirm the number.</p>
<p>According to the Center for Auto Safety, the two-year boy
in Washington County, Pa., was killed when the seat in his
mother's 1987 Plymouth Voyager collapsed backward in an
accident. The child reportedly was thrown from the van into a
creek 35 feet away, where he died of hypothermia.</p>
<p>A Chrysler spokesman said the auto maker is aware of the
investigation. "We don't have a problem with our seats, which
comply with federal standards. And we are cooperating with
NHTSA in its investigation," the spokesman said.</p>
