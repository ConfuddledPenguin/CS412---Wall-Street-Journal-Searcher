	<p class="article-leader">China's Civil Aviation Administration ordered 33 Boeing
Co. airplanes valued at $2 billion and took options on 36
others, marking the second big booking for the world's No. 1
jet maker in the past week.
   "It seems like the good orders just won't stop," said
Jerry Cantwell, an aerospace analyst who follows
Seattle-based Boeing for Wertheim Schroder & Co. "It seems
like the stock won't stop going up either."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Indeed, Boeing shares closed in composite trading on the
New York Stock Exchange yesterday at $82.375, up 37.5 cents.</p>
<p>The stock had climbed more than a point earlier in the
day, but it fell back as the entire market retreated. Mr.
Cantwell noted that details of the Chinese order weren't
disclosed until just minutes before the final bell, meaning
the Big Board might not have had time to react to the latest
good news. Boeing's high for the past 52 weeks is $82.75,
reached last week.</p>
<p>The firm orders consist of five 747-400 four-engine
jumbo-jets, which cost about $130 million apiece; one
747-200F freighter; four 767 wide-bodies; 10 757
narrow-bodies; and 13 737-300 twinjets.</p>
<p>The aviation authority oversees the purchasing of planes
for China's airlines, and the aircraft ordered will be used
by Air China, Guangzhou CAAC, China Southwest Airlines and
other carriers.</p>
<p>The agency has picked PW4000 engines, a new, powerful
model made by United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney
unit, to propel the 747-400s and 767s. And a Pratt & Whitney
JT9D-7R4G2 will be used on the freighter. That order is
valued at about $250 million.</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce engines were tapped for the 757s, and engines
made by CFM International, a joint venture of General
Electric Co. and Snecma of France, will be used on the
737-300s.</p>
<p>Although Boeing has, as a matter of policy, ceased
providing delivery dates for its planes, Pratt & Whitney said
the first aircraft will begin being shipped to Air China in
the first quarter of 1992. That is earlier than when many
other Boeing customers are set to receive their jets, and
there has even been some speculation that Boeing earlier this
week lost a Mexicana Airlines order to rival Airbus Industrie
because its delivery schedule is stretched so far.</p>
<p>Boeing has been negotiating seriously with the Chinese for
the past eight months, and the company said the purchase of
the 69-plane package had nothing to do with President Bush's
decision last week to renew most-favored trade status with
that country. Outside experts concurred, explaining that such
a designation is designed to give China low tariffs on its
exports to the U.S.</p>
<p>It wasn't immediately clear how many other companies were
in the running for the Chinese order. McDonnell Douglas Corp.
has a good relationship with the nation, whose airlines have
ordered MD-11 tri-jets in the past and which actually
assembles some MD-80s in Shanghai.</p>
<p>A spokesman at McDonnell Douglas's transport aircraft
division in Long Beach, Calif., said he didn't know whether
the firm had actively bid against Boeing for the latest
order. But one source said the company may not have been "in
a particular campaign on this one."</p>
<p>Boeing, for its part, stressed its own longstanding
relationship with the Chinese. Since 1972, the nation has
purchased 101 Boeing airplanes, including three additional
757s last October.</p>
<p>The company's orders for the year for all models now stand
at 187 valued at about $16.2 billion. Only a week ago, Japan
Airlines ordered 20 747-400s valued at $3.1 billion and
placed options for 34 others.</p>
