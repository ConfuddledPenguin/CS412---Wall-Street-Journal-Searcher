	<p class="article-leader">Cutting costs by $100 million in the next 100 days will be
painful, but Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. has
decided that it has few other options.
   Shackled by a substantial shortage of capital, the U.S.'s
third-largest life insurance company has decided it must get
a grip quickly on its out-of-control expenses. That means
streamlining corporate management, cutting sales commissions
to agents and slashing the dividend the firm pays
policyholders. The challenge is especially tricky for
Equitable, which must make sure the next austerity moves
don't drive away too many of its 11,000 agents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An internal company memo from a recent meeting quotes
Robert Barth, president of Equitable's largest unit, as
saying: "While there is still a residue of distrust among
agents, it's reassuring to see the support by agency managers
to recent cutbacks in commissions, etc. We will lose some
agents and business, but we'll have to live with it."</p>
<p>Equitable's array of problems, reflected in the departure
two weeks ago of its president and the resignation last week
of its chief financial officer, are dogging the company in
the marketplace. Never a triple-A-rated insurer, Equitable
faces fresh concerns about its junk-bond holdings.</p>
<p>Executive shake-ups in the past two years and the poor
public-relations job the company has done in managing these
changes have caused the company's reputation to slip among
its peers and among consumers. Some agents complain that they
now have to spend as much time selling the company name as
they do peddling Equitable's life insurance and financial
products.</p>
<p>Insiders say morale is very low. Nowhere is it worse than
among Equitable's agents, which some industry observers see
as one of the company's most valuable assets. As part of its
cost-savings moves, Equitable has cut agents' commissions as
many as 10 percentage points on some products, as well as the
dividends paid to policyholders. Industry analysts say the
investment yields Equitable pays on some investment-type
policies have been reduced by about a half-percentage point
below the going rate among the company's chief competitors.</p>
<p>While these actions save money for Equitable, they don't
make the agents' jobs any easier. Lower dividends and
investment yields make it all that much tougher to close a
sale, agents say.</p>
<p>The next 12 to 18 months promise to be particularly
difficult for the company. Industry peers as well company
insiders hope the new management has the stamina and courage
to make the hard choices needed to get Equitable back on
track.</p>
<p>Michael Puccia, head of Standard & Poor's Corp.'s life
insurance rating analysis group, says Equitable had relied on
superior investment performance "to bolster earnings and to
mask problems such as its bloated expense structure." Now, he
says he expects new management will shift the company's focus
toward "product profitability."</p>
<p>Equitable "hasn't shown solid {companywide} earnings
performance in many years. The company needs to get control
of its operations so most of its cylinders are clicking at
the same time," Mr. Puccia says.</p>
<p>Since John B. Carter's sudden departure as president and
chief executive officer, Equitable Chairman Richard H.
Jenrette has intervened to assume those duties and to push
for rapid change. Commenting on his self-imposed deadline of
100 days, he says, "If you don't make changes then, you don't
do them later on."</p>
<p>But the 61-year-old Mr. Jenrette recognizes the anxiety he
is stirring up. "All this talk of cost-cutting has engendered
some apprehension around here. But I do feel people are
genuinely pulling for me," he says. "We want to be lean and
smart, not lean and mean."</p>
<p>Thomas M. Kirwan, whom Mr. Jenrette has picked as chief
financial officer, noted in a recent internal memo that
combining Equitable's three financial areas into one unit
should save the company some $14 million. In addition, there
have been discussions of proposals to cut about $40 million
in sales-agent expenses. But Mr. Jenrette stressed that no
cost-cutting plans for agents have been finalized.</p>
<p>Even so, there are some costs that Mr. Jenrette and his
new team won't be able to whittle down soon. For instance,
company insiders say Equitable has leased hundreds of
thousands of square feet of prime office space in Manhattan
that the company isn't using and can't dispose of. The first
of the leases doesn't expire until 1996. In one building,
Equitable can't find any takers for its offer to sublet at
$14 a square foot, while the company continues to pay $28.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of Mr. Jenrette's cost-cutting
mission is to help Equitable build up capital. Analysts say
other insurance giants such as Prudential Insurance Cos. and
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. are nearly 50% better
capitalized than Equitable.</p>
<p>Mr. Jenrette concedes that Equitable must "demonstrate a
high level of earnings" on its $61.7 billion of assets to
build capital and win a higher claims-paying rating from the
Wall Street houses. In the past few years, lack of capital
has made Equitable downplay a joint venture with Merrill
Lynch & Co. known as Tandem Financial. Similarly, Equitable
was forced to sell Integrity Life Insurance Co., an Arizona
concern that marketed Equitable products through banks and
brokerage firms. In the mid-1980s, while Equitable was
involved in these ventures, it eliminated several product
lines that were attractive to investors because the company
lacked sufficient capital to support them.</p>
<p>But Mr. Jenrette believes Equitable still has some hidden
assets. He contends that the company's stake in its
investment units, including Alliance Capital, Equitable
Capital Management, and Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, is
probably worth about $1 billion more than what the insurer
lists on its balance sheet. He adds that Equitable has equity
positions in various start-up companies, which it carries on
the books at about $200 million.</p>
<p>"Over time," he says, "these could be worth a good bit
more."</p>
