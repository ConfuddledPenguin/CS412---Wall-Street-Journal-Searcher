	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stocks eased yesterday as the closing bell
approached, with investors backing away from the market ahead
of today's economic reports for May. But while blue-chip
stocks ended lower, the broader market held onto fractional
gains.
   U.S. employment figures for May will be released at 8:30
a.m. EDT today, and the purchasing managers report for the
month also is to come out. Both reports will be scanned for
signs of continued softening in the economy, adding credence
to the theory that inflation is under control and interest
rates have peaked.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After sharp gains in the stock market last month, however,
many market players turned cautious yesterday. Any sharp
deviation in the data from expectations could spark a round
of profit-taking, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.90 points to
2876.66. The blue-chip index opened lower, as traders reacted
to weaker prices overseas. While the DJIA soon recovered, the
day's gains evaporated late in the session.</p>
<p>Tonka crashed early, losing more than 30% of its value
with a 3-point decline to 7. Trading in the issue opened
late, as sellers rushed to dump the stock after the company's
announcement late Wednesday that it expects to report a
"significant loss" for the second quarter, on lower sales.
The company also said the loss could result in violations of
some covenants in its bank loan agreement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the broader market ended higher, with Standard
& Poor's 500-Stock Index inching ahead to yet another
all-time high. The index has climbed nearly 10% from its
late-April low, yesterday adding 0.37 point to 361.23.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.19
point to 196.94, while the Dow Jones Equity Market Index
added 0.31 point to 335.98.</p>
<p>Though the market's altitude is making some investors
queasy, Guy W. Courtney, senior vice president of David A.
Noyes, is undaunted. "I'm not nervous at all," he said. "This
market has got plenty of upside left in it."</p>
<p>Advancing issues led decliners, 801 to 682, and 534 stocks
ended unchanged. Big Board volume totaled about 165.7 million
shares, down from Wednesday's robust 199.5 million shares.
Yesterday's volume was bloated by a huge block of Armstrong
World Industries and dividend-related trading in Texas
Utilities and other stocks, however.</p>
<p>Steven A. Kroll, president of SLH Asset Management,
Shearson Lehman Hutton's money management operation, said
that while the market paused ahead of today's data, stocks
won't begin "a new leg of the bull market" until the Federal
Reserve has eased credit. Until then, Mr. Kroll believes,
stock prices will remain locked in a trading range with a
ceiling at about the 2900 level on the Dow industrials.</p>
<p>Many market watchers expect today's employment report to
show a strong increase in job growth for May, with the
nation's nonfarm payroll having increased by 253,000
employees. This anticipated increase includes newly hired
census workers, however, meaning that actual job growth is
estimated to have been a more modest 135,000.</p>
<p>Stronger job growth could cue some investors to sell
stocks. Edward J. Laux, head of block trading at Kidder
Peabody, said the DJIA could drop 70 to 100 points if the
number is disappointing. As for any gains, Mr. Laux sees room
for only about a 30-point move by the Dow industrials.</p>
<p>Among the blue chips, Procter & Gamble rose 5/8 to 82 5/8
yesterday. Morgan Stanley has repeated its buy recommendation
on the stock.</p>
<p>International Business Machines eased 7/8 to 120. The
stock opened lower, following weakness in Europe because of
concerns that Hitachi of Japan will soon unveil a mainframe
computer that will be faster than IBM's competing models.
Hitachi is scheduled to introduce a mainframe product next
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Data General added 1 1/4, or 11.5%, to 12 1/8. The company
said Smith Barney, Harris Upham raised its rating on the
stock, after analysts met with Data General executives
Wednesday, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report.</p>
<p>But L.A. Gear continued to tumble, closing off 4 3/8 at 39
1/4, on volume of more than 2.2 million shares. Profit-taking
has hit the issue since Kidder Peabody cut its rating on the
stock earlier this week, citing the recent sharp rise in the
shares' price. The stock lost 20% so far this week.</p>
<p>Philip Morris led the most-active list, on volume of more
than 2.7 million shares. The stock eased 3/8 to 42 1/8.</p>
<p>Westinghouse Electric jumped 1 3/8 to 36 3/8. The company
said it will begin a buy-back of as many as 20 million common
shares in the next 12 to 18 months. Westinghouse has about
294 million shares outstanding. Separately, Westinghouse's
board voted to exempt the company from coverage under a
recently passed Pennsylvania anti-takeover statute.</p>
<p>Armco rose 7/8 to 8 3/4, after Goldman Sachs upgraded its
rating on the stock, according to Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report.</p>
<p>Ashland Oil dropped 1 1/4 to 38 3/8, after the company was
ordered to pay $10.3 million in damages to residents near its
Catlettsburg, Ky., refinery. The residents had sued Ashland,
complaining that emissions from the plant had damaged their
health and property. Ashland said it plans to appeal the
award.</p>
<p>Pfizer gained 2 1/4 to 65 7/8. A judge dismissed all
claims against the company in a lawsuit stemming from the
sale of faulty heart valves marketed by Pfizer. A consumer
group brought the suit in March, seeking to require Pfizer
and Shiley, maker of the valves, to communicate directly with
all recipients of the valves.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Edison slid 1 1/4 to 31 1/2. The Illinois
Supreme Court has ruled that the utility should refund more
than $300 million to customers. The revenues were collected
under a rate increase awarded by the Illinois Commerce
Commission. In its ruling, the court said the commission
acted without jurisdiction.</p>
<p>First Bank Systems dropped 1 to 14 1/2. The company said
it will sell 12.6 million newly issued shares in a private
placement to an investment group. M/A-Com rose 1/2 to 5 1/4,
after it definitively agreed to sell its government systems
unit to Titan Corp. Titan closed unchanged at 2 3/8.</p>
<p>Air Products & Chemicals rose 5/8 to 56 3/4. The company
said it agreed to sell its polyvinyl chloride buisness to a
unit of Pacific Western Extruded Plastics for an undisclosed
amount.</p>
<p>Florida Progress eased 1/2 to 36 3/8, on volume of 1.1
million shares; much of the trading took place on the
Philadelphia Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Analysts identified Hasbro, the largest U.S. toy maker, as
a likely bidder for Tyco Toys, which said Wednesday it
received an unsolicited acquisition approach from a party
that wasn't identified. Tyco declined to elaborate yesterday.
Hasbro wouldn't comment on the report, though an official
said the company remains interested in potential
acquisitions. Tyco shares jumped 2 3/4 to 27 3/8 in national
over-the-counter trading, with more than 1.3 million shares
changing hands. Hasbro's shares also advanced on heavy
volume, closing up 3/8 at 21 1/4 in American Stock Exchange
trading of 617,900 shares. Paul Valentine, an analyst with
Standard & Poor's Corp., said that Tyco "may be trying to put
itself into play," and that the stock "has had a great run"
since going public at $6 in 1986.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.15
point to 363.06. Amex volume totaled about 15.9 million
shares, down slightly from 16.3 million shares a day earlier.
Advancing stocks led those retreating, 291 to 269, and 264
issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>Thermo Process Systems fell 1 to 13 1/2. Yesterday's
"Heard on the Street" column in The Wall Street Journal said
the stock is getting pricey, after appreciating 72% since the
start of 1989.</p>
<p>Heritage Media added 1/2 to 5 3/8. Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette initiated coverage of the stock with a "buy"
recommendation, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report.</p>
<p>Brown Group gained 2 1/2 to 27 1/8. The company reported
first-quarter net income of 51 cents a share, up from 42
cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Sanifill surged 1 1/2 to 19 3/8, after Tucker Anthony
raised its earnings estimates for the company and repeated a
"strong buy" rating on the stock.</p>
