	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices ended modestly higher in quiet
trading as investors braced for today's release of the May
employment report.
   "It's the calm before the potential storm of the
employment report," said Robert T. Falconer, a senior vice
president at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. "Everyone is gun-shy."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Surprises in the employment data, considered the most
important of the government's monthly statistics on the
economy, often roil the bond market.</p>
<p>That was certainly the case when the much
weaker-then-expected April jobs report issued on May 4
ignited a bond market rally that lifted the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond 1 1/2 points, or $15 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>What little activity there was yesterday generally
involved position-squaring, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>"There's been a last-minute adjustment of positions in
anticipation of the employment report," said Charles
Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover
Securities Corp.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose more than 1/8
point. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, eased to 8.57%.</p>
<p>Bonds got off to a weak start after increases in the
indexes of regional surveys of purchasing managers in Chicago
and Detroit raised speculation that the national survey, also
due out today, would show more strength in the manufacturing
sector of the economy than many economists have forecast.</p>
<p>Analysts said market participants were especially
concerned about the report by the Purchasing Management
Association of Chicago. Its index of business conditions in
May rose to an unadjusted 56%, compared with 54.2% in April.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, the index was 55.3%, compared
with 50.2% in April.</p>
<p>"People thought that the surprisingly strong Chicago
purchasing management survey might transfer to the national
figure," said Christopher Rupkey, a financial economist at
Mitsubishi Bank.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Detroit Purchasing Management Association
index rose to 48.8% in May from 45.6% in April.</p>
<p>The national purchasing agents' survey is closely
monitored by the bond market because, like the jobs report,
it provides one of the first readings of how the economy
performed in a given month.</p>
<p>After the initial flurry of selling on the regional
reports, "there was no follow-through to the downside," a
dealer of government securities said. As a result, players
who have established short positions, in a bet that prices
would decline further, then covered those shorts, he said.</p>
<p>A consensus of economists polled by Dow Jones Capital
Markets Report expects an acceleration of employment growth
in May, with nonfarm payrolls seen having increased 253,000,
with a gain of 135,000 seen if census workers hired in the
month are excluded.</p>
<p>The May civilian unemployment rate is expected to have
been unchanged at 5.4%.</p>
<p>In April, nonfarm payrolls grew a paltry 64,000, with
payrolls decreasing 14,000 if census workers hired that month
are excluded.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the index of the National Association of
Purchasing Management is expected to have declined to 49.5%
in May, according to the average of estimates of economists
surveyed by Capital Markets Report. A reading above 50%
indicates an expanding industrial sector, and a reading below
50% suggests the sector is contracting.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>Consolidated Rail Corp., the Philadelphia-based freight
railroad, drew a sell-out crowd when it offered $250 million
of notes.</p>
<p>The sale of the 10-year notes, which were priced to yield
9.785%, marked the first public debt offering by Conrail
since its recapitalization earlier this year.</p>
<p>"We were very pleased to get it done at these spreads
without any event-risk protection," said treasurer John
McKelvey.</p>
<p>Strong investor demand prompted underwriters led by Morgan
Stanley & Co. to boost the offering from $200 million.</p>
<p>About 50 accounts participated in the deal, and investment
bankers said the notes were snapped up primarily by
institutional buyers such as pension funds and mutual funds.</p>
<p>The noncallable securities were priced at a spread of 1.15
percentage points above the Treasury's 10-year note. Proceeds
from the offering will be used mainly to refinance commercial
paper borrowings incurred in connection with the company's
$1.1 billion self-tender offer.</p>
<p>Mr. McKelvey said Conrail is likely to tap the market with
at least $500 million more in new debt later this year.</p>
<p>In trading, most actively traded investment-grade
corporate bonds ended unchanged to slightly stronger.</p>
<p>In the junk bond market, high-yield bonds of R.H. Macy &
Co. weakened significantly as investor skittishness about the
giant retailer mounted.</p>
<p>Macy's 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures due in 1998
were quoted at a bid price of 65, down three points from
Wednesday, while the 14 1/2% subordinated debentures maturing
in 2001 ended at a bid price of 54, after trading as high as
58 Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the broader high-yield market, junk bonds finished
about 1/4 point higher on light volume.</p>
<p>Junk bonds of Bally Manufacturing Corp. continued to
strengthen after surging five points Wednesday. Bally's 13
5/8% subordinated debentures, due in 2001, added three points
to close at 61.</p>
<p>Bally Manufacturing bonds began climbing Wednesday after
the company announced an exchange offer under which
bondholders would receive 57 shares of Bally common stock for
each $1,000 principal amount of debentures tendered.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Slightly firm prices were being quoted for most mortgage
securities.</p>
<p>The focus of the Government National Mortgage Association
market was a Public Securities Association decision yesterday
afternoon to restrict trading in high-coupon Ginnie Maes with
rates of 11% and higher issued from Jan. 1, 1989, to July 1,
1990, effective in the next session.</p>
<p>This move is intended to stem the issuance of so-called
live-free mortgages, which have soured the entire $50 billion
market for high-coupon mortgages.</p>
<p>Certain mortgage originators have been issuing mortgages
to homeowners at above-market rates for refinancing purposes,
agreeing in advance to refinance the mortgages at lower
rates.</p>
<p>For the investor, the unusually quick prepayment rates
often resulted in losses on the securities they were willing
to pay premiums for in anticipation of prepayments later on.</p>
<p>Under the reported agreement, the bond trade group has
deemed these high-coupon Ginnie Maes ineligible for delivery
for "to-be-announced" trades, which are standard mortgage
securities trades in which the buyer doesn't know the exact
pool he will receive at settlement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ginnie Mae President Arthur Hill sent a letter
to mortgage securities market players stating that
high-coupon loans originated with these pre-arranged
refinancing provisions aren't eligible for inclusion in
Ginnie Mae mortgage securities pools effective immediately.</p>
<p>Ginnie Mae 9 1/2% securities for June delivery were up
3/32 at 98 19/32.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities
</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at
101 24/32, up from 101 18/32 on Wednesday. The latest 10-year
notes ended at 101 25/32 to yield 8.59%, compared with 101
22/32 to yield 8.60%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were little changed to modestly higher.
The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills was little
changed at 7.76% for a bond-equivalent yield of 8%. The rate
on six-month notes rose to 7.74% to yield 8.15%.</p>
<p>Yesterday the Treasury sold $10 billion of 52-week bills.
Here are details:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>
<p>                    52-Week Bills</p>
<p>Applications                              $25,562,265,000</p>

<p>Coupon equivalent                                   8.24%</p>
<p>The bills are dated June 7 and mature June 6, 1991.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Advancing to mostly unchanged levels after slim declines
on new economic data, municipal bonds were flat to up 1/8
point in thin late trading.</p>
<p>New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was
unchanged at 98 bid to yield 7.36%.</p>
<p>Some municipal issues had traded down about 1/8 point
after the release of the Chicago Purchasing Management
Association's index for May, traders said.</p>
<p>In addition, news that President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev may agree on the major elements of a
strategic arms reduction treaty today, buoyed the market,
some traders said.</p>
<p>In slim new issue dealings, a $50.9 million issue of New
Jersey certificates of participation was won by a Dillon,
Read & Co. group. The bonds were priced to yield from 5.90%
in 1990 to 6.65% in 1997.</p>
<p>No large municipal issues are expected to be priced today.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Japanese government bonds ended stronger on news that
Japanese wholesale prices declined.</p>
<p>The Japanese government said wholesale prices fell 0.4% in
the second 10 days of May from the first 10 days. Traders
said most buyers Thursday were dealers.</p>
<p>The price of Japan's benchmark 10-year government security
rose to 88.14 points to yield 6.94%. (The yield is calculated
in local terms, but it would be 6.56% if calculated by the
semiannual compound measure used in the U.S.)</p>
<p>In Britain, government bonds ended moderately lower as
speculation faded again about an imminent entry by Britain
into the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism.</p>
<p>Prices had surged Wednesday on renewed speculation that
British authorities were about to make an announcement
concerning the mechanism, which is the European Community's
currency stabilization arrangement. But in comments made on
Wednesday, Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major didn't say
anything regarding the country's entry into the arrangement.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto
Poehl also discouraged expectations. He said "Britain can't
and shouldn't participate in the EMS" because of its high
inflation and balance-of-payment problems.</p>
<p>Britain's 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 fell 9/32 to 99 27/32
to yield 11.76%.</p>
