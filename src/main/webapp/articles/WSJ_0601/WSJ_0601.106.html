	<p class="article-leader">URCARCO Inc. said it completed an offering of five million
common shares at $19.875 each, more than 2.5 times the
company's initial stock offering price last November. The
Fort Worth, Texas, high-flying operator of used-car lots said
it will use the proceeds to buy cars for inventory, to expand
its business, reduce debt and for general corporate purposes.
Urcarco had about 25.6 million shares outstanding before the
offering. It went public at $11 a share late last year and
has since paid a 3-for-2 stock split. Yesterday, in national
over-the-counter trading, the stock was the second most
active issue on volume of 3.3 million shares; it closed at
$20.625, up 75 cents. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. led
the underwriting group.</p>
