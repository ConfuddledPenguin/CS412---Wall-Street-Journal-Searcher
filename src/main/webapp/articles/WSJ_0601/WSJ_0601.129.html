	<p class="article-leader">ECI Environmental Inc., a San Leandro, Calif., asbestos
cleanup firm, said that cost overruns and a decline in new
projects probably depressed fiscal third quarter net income.
   The company estimated net at about $180,000, or four cents
a share, for the quarter ended yesterday, down from $672,000,
or 19 cents a share, the year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ECI estimated that third-period revenue ranged between
$5.6 million and $6 million, compared with $5.5 million the
year earlier.</p>
<p>The company said that a drop in new projects from San
Francisco commercial high-rise owners and high development
costs in its Southern California operations probably also
will hurt fourth-quarter net, causing it to trail the $1.9
million of a year earlier.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in composite trading on the American Stock
Exchange, ECI common plunged $2.125 a share to close at $4.75
each on volume of 33,600 shares.</p>
