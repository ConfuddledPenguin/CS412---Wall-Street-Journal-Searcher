	<p class="article-leader">CALGARY, Alberta -- Shell Canada Ltd., facing shrinking
earnings and hefty spending plans, said it will restructure
its oil refining, marketing and chemical businesses, which
last year generated 87% of the company's 4.92 billion
Canadian dollars (US$4.17 billion) in revenue.
   The reorganization will mainly affect the company's
downstream, or refining and marketing, business, the company
said, and will result in the elimination of about 800 jobs,
or about 11% of the full-time staff, by the end of 1991. The
cuts also will result in a second-quarter net charge against
earnings of about C$25 million, or about 22 Canadian cents a
share. In the 1989 second quarter, Shell Canada earned C$60
million, or 54 Canadian cents a share, on revenue of C$1.21
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shell Canada, the third-largest petroleum refiner and
marketer in Canada with 16% of the national market, said it
"will also undertake a staged divestment of underperforming
assets," including company-owned service stations and
distribution facilities. It didn't say how much it expects to
raise from the asset sales.</p>
<p>About one-third of Shell Canada's 3,500 service stations
are company-owned, a spokesman said, and the company intends
to sell an unspecified number of these to independent
operators, who run the bulk of the stations. Some
distribution facilities and other plants also will be sold,
he said, though the company's four oil refineries will be
retained.</p>
<p>The corporate makeover includes realigning the downstream
business, which is organized on a regional basis, into four
separate businesses, all based in Calgary. These will include
retail operations, commercial and industrial sales, private
brands, and manufacturing and trading. Shell Canada's styrene
and polypropylene plants, which make up its chemicals arm,
will remain intact as a fifth division.</p>
<p>Shell Canada, which is 78.2%-owned by Royal Dutch/Shell
Group, an Anglo-Dutch concern, said the moves "will
contribute to achieving significant, sustained improvement in
earnings and return on investment." It didn't offer specific
estimates, but the company previously said it aims ultimately
to double last year's dismal 4.4% rate of return on
investment in its downstream arm.</p>
<p>Such an improvement would effectively boost downstream
profit to about C$150 million annually, using current asset
figures, up from C$79 million last year.</p>
<p>"You can't continue in a business in the modern world,
especially in Canada, with its {high} interest rates being
what they are, with a 4% return on investment," the spokesman
said. "That's what is driving this {restructuring}."</p>
<p>Investors and analysts didn't show much enthusiasm for the
restructuring announcement, which followed earlier statements
by the company that it was considering such a move. In
Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Shell Canada shares
closed at C$38.125, down 12.5 Canadian cents, and just
slightly above its 52-week low of C$37.50.</p>
<p>"In many respects, the company is walking away from its
downstream problems, instead of fixing them," said David
Stenason, an analyst with Levesque, Beaubien Geffrion Inc. He
said the company has trailed its competitors in upgrading
refineries and improving underground storage tanks at retail
stations, and faces about C$3.5 billion of capital outlays
through 1994, largely in its upstream, or oil and gas
exploration and production, operations.</p>
<p>Mr. Stenason estimated that Shell Canada will generate
cash flow -- earnings plus depreciation allowances -- of
about C$550 million this year, or about C$200 million less
than its capital spending requirements, forcing it to take on
additional debt. He sees debt rising to about 30% of
capitalization within 18 months, up from 20% now.</p>
