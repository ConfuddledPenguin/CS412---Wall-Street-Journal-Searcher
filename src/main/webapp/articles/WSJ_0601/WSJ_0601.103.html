	<p class="article-leader">Publishers and bookstore owners heading to the annual
convention of the American Booksellers Association, which
starts today in Las Vegas, predict strong sales this fall and
plentiful best sellers after a year that was disappointing
for many.
   "Our sales were soft for most of last year, but I think
you're going to see a pretty upbeat community of booksellers
and publishers," says Ronald Jaffe, senior marketing director
for the Waldenbooks unit of K mart Corp. "It's like night and
day. Our sales are terrific right now, and from what we've
seen about new books coming out this fall, we're very
excited."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I think the doom and gloom has receded," says Brigitte
Weeks, editor in chief of Time Warner Inc.'s Book-of-theMonth
Club. "People are feeling more secure, and there are going to
be some really big books this fall, including new novels by
Jean Auel and Colleen McCullough. There are some really
classy, important books coming out, too, from authors like
John Updike and Gabriel Garcia Marquez."</p>
<p>At this annual gathering, hundreds of publishers of all
sizes tout their forthcoming books to thousands of bookstore
owners, hoping to boost sales for the fall season, the
biggest in publishing. "We use this as a forum, to find out
what kind of season to look forward to," says Bernard Rath,
executive director of the association. Although many New York
publishers complained that their high-brow industry is
meeting in a low-brow town, attendance is expected to be
about 25,000, says Mr. Rath, slightly ahead of last year's
convention in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The association recently said bookstore sales jumped 63%
between 1982 and 1987, and sales reportedly rose about 11% in
1989. However, a recent report by the American Association of
Publishers showed only a 4.1% increase in sales of adult
hardcover books in the first quarter of 1990. Various surveys
predict that growth will be better than that in the next few
years, but not as strong as during the boom years of the
mid-1980s.</p>
<p>Despite a consensus among publishing executives that this
fall will bring more blockbusters than last year's
disappointing lineup, there are still some jitters in the
industry after tumultuous times. During the past six months,
several big publishers took substantial write-downs against
earnings, several small publishers were put up for sale and
an earlier wave of big mergers was followed by consolidation
and staff cuts at many houses. At the same time, growth of
the big bookstore chains was slowing down.</p>
<p>"I'd say the mood is optimistic but far from euphoria,"
says David Godine, a small, independent publisher based in
Boston. "You can't look around and say this industry is in
terrific shape."</p>
<p>"We're fairly bullish as we head into the summer, but I'm
cautious," says Jack Hoeft, president of Bantam Doubleday
Dell Publishing Group, a unit of Bertelsmann AG. The
company's Doubleday unit had an especially difficult year in
1989 -- racking up losses, switching top management and
cutting back the list of titles sharply. "The cautious part
is because I'm getting some reports from customers that the
bookselling market in general is still pretty soft," says Mr.
Hoeft.</p>
<p>"It has been a sobering time, but there is an optimism
again," says Joni Evans, publisher of Random House, which is
owned by the Newhouse family's Advance Publications Inc. "We
all feel a bit like Gorbachev: Things are better, but at any
moment, they could take a wrong turn." Ms. Evans said that,
as part of a new conservatism in publishing, "the bubble has
definitely burst on advances."</p>
<p>Allan Lang, an agent and consultant, adds, "Sales and
marketing and editorial departments are being trimmed all
over the industry. Publishers aren't publishing fewer titles,
but they are publishing smaller initial print runs and paying
for fewer author tours."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, booksellers and publishers are ready to
celebrate in Las Vegas, with dozens of author lunches and
lavish cocktail parties at local casinos and mansions. "The
mood will definitely be good: This is always a happy
convention," says Mr. Lang. "Publishers are eternal
optimists, or they couldn't remain sane in this business."</p>
