	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Net income of the nation's property and
casualty insurers declined 34% in the first quarter.
   Earnings, including investment income, fell to $2.26
billion from $3.46 billion a year earlier, according to the
Insurance Information Institute, a trade group. The figures
are compiled from reports of insurers representing about 97%
of the nation's property-casualty insurance business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decline in profitability reflected "basic economics,"
with costs rising faster than premiums, the institute said.</p>
