	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev failed to settle deep differences over Germany on
the opening day of their summit meeting, and a new superpower
dispute emerged that threatens to torpedo a lucrative
U.S.-Soviet grain deal.
   As the summit opened yesterday, Soviet negotiators hinted
they might not sign the five-year pact to buy American grain,
apparently in an effort to get President Bush to sign a new
U.S.-Soviet trade treaty. Mr. Bush has said he is reluctant
to sign the new trade treaty because of Moscow's continuing
resistance to Lithuanian independence. Both agreements were
negotiated earlier and await only the leaders' signatures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Late yesterday, U.S. officials said the chances of signing
either treaty were poor -- unless Messrs. Bush and Gorbachev
themselves can break the logjam by this afternoon. The
president said trade would be on the agenda today.</p>
<p>The grain and trade dispute was carried out behind the
scenes of the summit and wasn't referred to by either leader
or their spokesmen. The public focus of the summit's first
day was a spirited debate the two leaders held on the more
important matter of German unification and whether a united
Germany should join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev caused a stir by suggesting the session had
produced progress on the German issue, and the two presidents
issued a statement saying they had assigned Secretary of
State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze to discuss the matter further.</p>
<p>But American officials close to the session said neither
side put forward any fresh schemes for resolving the German
problem. They said Mr. Gorbachev repeated earlier suggestions
that a united Germany could belong to both NATO and the
Warsaw Pact and that full German sovereignty be deferred. Mr.
Bush repeated U.S. assurances, already conveyed by Mr. Baker,
that NATO will change into a more political grouping and that
the West will support a cut in German armed forces in later
negotiations.</p>
<p>In addition, the Soviets delivered a letter to the Bush
administration repeating a proposal that the 35-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe be
transformed into a full-blown security system that might
replace NATO. The U.S. has repeatedly rejected that idea.</p>
<p>The U.S. officials said the decision to ask the two
foreign ministers to discuss Germany further was a
face-saving measure adopted to imply that more progress was
possible. But the two presidents conceded Germany wouldn't be
settled at this summit, and no Baker-Shevardnadze meetings
specifically on Germany were scheduled as of last night. Mr.
Bush plans to call West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
to reassure him that no deals were cut.</p>
<p>On the trade issue, American officials said Mr.
Shevardnadze and other top Gorbachev aides emphasized
repeatedly in yesterday's meetings that a signed trade treaty
was of special political importance to Moscow, even though it
wouldn't result in an early expansion of trade.</p>
<p>The trade pact would be a valuable political symbol for
Mr. Gorbachev, who needs to demonstrate at home that he can
improve economic relations with the West. But failure to
conclude the pending five-year grain deal would have a much
greater immediate economic impact, casting doubt on whether
U.S. farmers will be able to sell Moscow 10 million metric
tons or more of grain annually, as planned.</p>
<p>Today, the two superpower leaders are expected to sign a
raft of other treaties and agreements. The most important of
these is a statement setting out the major elements of a
strategic nuclear-arms control pact to be signed later this
year and establishing goals for a further nuclear-arms treaty
to be negotiated, starting immediately thereafter.</p>
<p>In addition, the two leaders will sign treaties to slash
into their chemical-weapons arsenals and set up rules for
verifying curbs on nuclear testing. Other officials will sign
accords increasing air and maritime links and student
exchanges.</p>
<p>Right from the summit's opening, Mr. Bush coupled progress
in superpower relations to the U.S. plea that Moscow start
negotiating an independence deal with Lithuania.</p>
<p>"The agreements we've reached cannot cause us to lose
sight of some of the differences that remain," he told Mr.
Gorbachev minutes after greeting the Soviet leader on the
White House lawn. "Lithuania is one such issue. We believe
that good-faith dialogue between the Soviet leaders and
representatives of the Baltic peoples is the proper approach,
and we hope to see that process go forward."</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev appeared bitter about Lithuania's decision
to declare independence from the U.S.S.R. At a Soviet Embassy
luncheon, he told a group of U.S. intellectuals and film
stars: "Only in Lithuania, they can overnight decide a
question about seceding from the Soviet Union, and after that
they are at a loss what to do, and we are at a loss what to
do."</p>
<p>The Soviets badly want better trade ties with the U.S.
"It's quite unnatural that we, being almost the two biggest
powers in the world with a huge economic and scientific and
technical potential are having so little in trade and
cooperation," said Arkady Maslennikov, President Gorbachev's
spokesman.</p>
<p>The Soviets are arguing that their Lithuanian policy is an
internal Soviet matter and therefore shouldn't interfere with
U.S.-Soviet cooperation. Beyond that, they are asserting
that, contrary to U.S. charges, the Kremlin isn't blocking
Lithuania from seceding from the Soviet Union but only
insisting that it do so through the slow process outlined in
Soviet law.</p>
<p>Those arguments aren't enough to satisfy the U.S. Yet Mr.
Bush has enough sympathy for Mr. Gorbachev's position that he
has tried to prevent it from disrupting superpower
cooperation on broader political and arms-control matters.
But Mr. Gorbachev, by balking on the grain agreement, appears
to be trying to demonstrate that a failure to cooperate on
economic matters can harm the U.S. as well as the Soviet
Union.</p>
<p>U.S. officials believe Moscow has chosen to use the grain
deal as a weapon because the Soviet harvest has been good and
U.S. farmers can be expected to press Washington to save the
deal by signing the trade pact.</p>
<p>Even if the trade agreement were to be signed, it would be
more of a political prize than an economic one for the
beleaguered Mr. Gorbachev. Administration officials say
President Bush could sign the pact but refrain from sending
it to the Senate, which has warned that it won't be ratified
until the Lithuania crisis is settled.</p>
<p>What's more, the treaty merely would establish the legal
framework to permit increased trade. Unless it is accompanied
by the granting to the Soviets of most-favored nation tariff
treatment, it will have little impact.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Bush won't grant such treatment to Moscow
until the Soviet Legislature gives final passage to a
liberalized emigration bill. The bill was supposed to come to
a vote yesterday in Moscow, but has been removed from the
Soviet legislative calendar, and U.S. officials don't expect
it to be passed during the summit, despite continuing rumors
to the contrary.</p>
<p>The grain accord, which is to take effect Jan. 1, would
increase the minimum amount of U.S. wheat, feed grains,
soybeans and other commodities that Soviets would buy from
the U.S. each year and would give the Soviets greater
flexibility in their purchases.</p>
<p>Among other things, the new deal calls for an 11% rise in
Soviet purchases to 10 million metric tons of grain a year
from about nine million currently; of this amount, at least
four million tons would have to be wheat and another four
million tons would have to be corn and other feed grains. For
the first time since the inaugural 1973 agreement, barley and
sorghum grain would count as feed grains.</p>
<p>In addition, the new accord would allow the Soviets to buy
as much as 14 million tons of grain a year without having to
clear it with U.S. officials beforehand. The previous limit
was 12 million tons.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is the largest foreign market for U.S.
grain.</p>
<p>Bush administration officials said that even if a grain
agreement isn't signed at this summit, it could be completed
later this summer if the impasse over Lithuania and the
broader trade treaty is broken.</p>
