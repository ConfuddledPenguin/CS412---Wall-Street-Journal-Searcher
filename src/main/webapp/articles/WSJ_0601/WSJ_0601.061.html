	<p class="article-leader">The union effort to acquire United Airlines receives a
substantial boost with the adddition of former Chrysler Corp.
Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald as leader of the buy-out
group, but a successful deal remains a long way off.
   During the federal bailout of Chrysler, Mr. Greenwald
played a key role in negotiating with the many lending
institutions that helped keep the company from bankruptcy.
Through that experience, he built up strong bonds with a
number of banks, including Japanese institutions that could
prove crucial to the success of the bid for Chicago-based UAL
Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With a big loan to pay off and aircraft purchases to
finance, Mr. Greenwald's financial expertise could be
invaluable at United.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the buy-out is far from a sure thing. The
climate for such highly leveraged transactions is poor, and
widespread concerns remain that banks, which scorned an
earlier labor-management bid, won't finance the current $4.38
billion offer. Ultimately, lending institutions will have to
decide whether to participate based on the merits of the deal
itself.</p>
<p>UAL's stock rose $4.625 to $155.50 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, reflecting generally positive
reaction to Mr. Greenwald.</p>
<p>However, the stock is still trading at a sharp discount to
labor's $201-a-share offer, suggesting takeover stock traders
don't want to take larger positions with the deal still a
long way from completion. The offer includes only $155 a
share in cash; the rest is in debt and securities whose value
may change with time.</p>
<p>Although he waffled several times over his decision, Mr.
Greenwald exuded confidence yesterday at his first public
appearances as the buy-out's leader. Before accepting the
post, he said he consulted with several commercial bankers.
"I did my own form of due diligence," he added, using a
banking term for investigating a transaction's potential
problems.</p>
<p>"I'm convinced (the deal) will be done," he added. He said
he also was influenced by Goldman, Sachs & Co.'s recent
decision to join the financing effort, citing Goldman's
reputation for success.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald will get a big fee whether or not the deal
succeeds. Although he declined to discuss the fee, a person
familiar with the arrangement said it would amount to a
percentage of the $1.1 million annual salary the unions
agreed to pay him. Mr. Greenwald agreed to run UAL for five
years if the buy-out succeeds.</p>
<p>Despite his considerable strengths, some bank officials
expressed concern about his lack of airline experience. "I
don't think they've resolved the management issue by bringing
in Greenwald," said the chief executive officer of one of the
nation's largest leveraged buy-out lenders.</p>
<p>The banker notes that Mr. Greenwald's experience is in
manufacturing, a business quite different from the
service-oriented airline industry.</p>
<p>Acknowledging his shortcomings in this area, Mr. Greenwald
said airline executives will comprise United's "key
management" team. The unions have said they want to keep
substantially all of UAL's 40 current senior managers. They
have asked an executive search firm to find an executive from
within the industry to serve as Mr. Greenwald's chief
operating officer, a post not currently held at UAL.</p>
<p>The more thorny questions facing Mr. Greenwald concern the
deal's financial merits. Banking officials are concerned
about the absence of a major equity investor. They also
question whether a highly leveraged airline can survive in a
cyclical industry that requires heavy capital expenditures. A
heavy debt load, they say, will make United particularly
vulnerable to fare wars launched by stronger competitors.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald said the banks' wariness is "normal at this
point." Lenders, he noted, haven't yet seen detailed
financial data on the transaction. Union advisers said they
will begin circulating that information now that Mr.
Greenwald is on board. Mr. Greenwald will personally pitch
the transaction to lenders.</p>
<p>Union advisers recently discussed the transaction with
representatives of eight banks. The bankers' reaction left
them "optimistic," one person familiar with the discussions
said. The unions have to overcome the specter of last
October's failed labor-management bid. Privately, union
officials acknowledge that market conditions for leveraged
buy-outs haven't improved much since then.</p>
<p>The advisers say Mr. Greenwald will try to convince the
banks that the current transaction is far different from the
one that collapsed. They cite the lower purchase price, $201
a share compared with the earlier bid of $300 a share, that
will require less debt financing.</p>
<p>They also stress the fact that as a venture involving
employee ownership, both banks and UAL will receive
significant tax benefits. Because the current deal calls for
100% employee ownership, those benefits will be even greater
than in the earlier deal involving a 75% employee stake.</p>
<p>One problem is that the syndication market, in which large
banks lend vast sums and then parcel out portions of the loan
to various banks, "is dead," one U.S. banker said. That could
leave Mr. Greenwald with the tough task of convincing 20 or
so banks to lend relatively large sums.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old executive cites his experience in getting
400 banks to sign a Chryler agreement, all on the same day.
"I don't remember that as having been easy," he said. He also
noted that he was forced to run Chrysler at a time when the
company had no net worth.</p>
<p>"I've learned you do what you have to do," he said. One
difference, though, between the Chrysler bailout and the UAL
bid is that Chrysler's lenders knew the federal government
was backing Chrysler with a loan-guarantee program. Chrysler
ultimately paid back the loans without government help.</p>
<p>Bankers have also expressed concern about how much
involvement UAL's oncewarring unions will have in running the
company. "Are they going to get in the way of management?"
the top lending officer of a large New York bank asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwald said he is convinced UAL's labor leaders
will let him run the company. They agreed to a five-year
nostrike clause. At Chrysler he wrenched major labor
concessions when the company was failing.</p>
<p>He said he made no specific promises on how he would run
UAL, although he agreed he wouldn't diversify the company.
United's pilots union played a large role in forcing the
company to sell off its hotel and car rental businesses three
years ago.</p>
<p>Over the last five years, UAL has endured a bitter pilot
strike, three changes in chairmen and a major restructuring.
"The employees have gone through hell. The whole purpose of
employee ownership is to stabilize the company," Mr.
Greenwald said.</p>
