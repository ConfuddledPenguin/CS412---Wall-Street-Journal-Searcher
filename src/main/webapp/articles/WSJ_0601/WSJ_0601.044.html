	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Harlyn Products Inc., encouraged by strong
sales for Mother's Day, expects per-share net income of more
than 14 cents on sales of about $8 million for the fiscal
fourth quarter ending June 30, said Harold Weisbrod,
chairman, and Edward Dudziak, president.
   In an interview, the executives didn't give net income
estimates in dollars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-earlier fourth quarter, the jewelry maker had
indicated net income of $569,000, or 16 cents a share, on
sales of about $5.8 million. Harlyn doesn't normally break
out fourth-quarter results from its year-end numbers.
Year-earlier fourth-quarter results were arrived at by
subtracting sales and earnings for the first nine months of
fiscal 1989 from the year-end numbers.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1990, Harlyn expects earnings of more than 50
cents a share on sales of more than $30 million, Messrs.
Weisbrod and Dudziak said. That compares with fiscal 1989 net
of $1.5 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $24.8
million.</p>
<p>Harlyn is also in talks for a possible acquisition of a
jewelry company that the executives declined to identify. "It
would fit in very well with our sales, marketing and
manufacturing . . . and it wouldn't require any additional
costs other than the purchase price," Mr. Weisbrod said.</p>
<p>Last year, Harlyn acquired George Hoffman Jewelry
Manufacturing Inc., a Beverly Hills, Calif., maker and
marketer of diamond jewelry. "We've controlled the costs
there, and sales have increased slightly," Mr. Dudziak said.</p>
<p>Of Harlyn's continued earnings performance, Mr. Weisbrod
said, "We're very optimistic. . . . Even though the jewelry
business hasn't been so good, ours has been superb." He said
sales of family jewelry, adorned with birthstones of various
family members, "is stronger than it has ever been." The
company experienced unusually strong sales of its rings for
Mother's Day.</p>
<p>Mr. Weisbrod said Harlyn has reduced the average delivery
time for its rings to under two days, from three or more days
last year. (Harlyn now guarantees delivery within three days
after a customer places an order.) The company has also
implemented various cost-cutting measures to improve the
bottom line.</p>
<p>Business for Harlyn's Bangkok manufacturing plant has
increased as a result of higher sales in Europe and Japan.
The plant's sales are expected to more than double this year
from last year's $1.2 million and to double next year, Mr.
Dudziak said.</p>
