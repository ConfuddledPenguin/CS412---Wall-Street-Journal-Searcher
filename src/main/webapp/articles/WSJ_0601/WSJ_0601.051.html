	<p class="article-leader">Few Americans know much about Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and
their five siblings, but they should. These
government-sponsored enterprises have piled up $863 billion
in off-budget borrowing, up from only $37 billion in 1970.
While these operations are generally regarded as sound,
policy makers have finally awakened to the fact that the idea
of federal guarantees, as in "federal deposit insurance,"
deserves a rethinking.
   Yesterday, the Treasury Department issued a 400-page study
calling for these off-budget corporations to meet tougher
capital standards and to obtain triple-A credit ratings
without factoring in their implicit taxpayer guarantees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Government-sponsored enterprises, or GSEs, are private
corporations chartered by the federal government to channel
credit to agricultural, housing and student borrowers. In the
1980s, as the federal budget deficit constrained new
spending, Congress created several new GSEs to shove
commitments off-budget. The latest entity is "Farmer Mac,"
the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp., which this year
began packaging and selling farm loans, much as Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac do for home mortgages. Another entity,
"Connie Lee," began in 1987 to guarantee college-construction
loans. Many legislators now want to set up a "Velda Sue" to
buy and package small-business loans.</p>
<p>The federal government doesn't formally guarantee the debt
of any of these entities, but the market operates on that
assumption. In 1985, the Farm Credit System, a GSE set up
back in 1917, became insolvent and asked for a federal
bailout. Congress, of course, passed a $4 billion rescue
package. In an eerie parallel to the S&L disaster, the Farm
Credit System got into trouble after 1971, when Congress gave
it permission to broaden and expand its lending to non-farm
rural homeowners and liberalized loan requirements to
farmers. Congress repeated this cycle in 1982, when it
enabled marginal S&Ls to invest billions in risky ventures.
In short Congress has repeatedly shown itself willing to
undermine the prudence of the underlying loan commitments.</p>
<p>Richard Glauber, Treasury undersecretary for finance, says
it's time to rein in and better supervise the GSEs. Mr.
Glauber thinks GSEs should increase their capital base since
he says some are now "the most thinly capitalized of major
U.S. financial entities." Fannie Mae, which provides a
secondary market for many federally guaranteed mortgages, has
$3 billion of equity backing up $336 billion worth of home
mortgages.</p>
<p>It now turns a healthy profit and its head, David Maxwell,
promises to increase its capital in the future. However, a
senior HUD official believes a shaky housing market could
make Fannie Mae "the country's biggest insolvent savings and
loan." This may be arguable, but it's encouraging that
federal officials are finally focused on these exposures.
Treasury wants all GSEs to earn a triple-A bond rating
without consideration of their taxpayer backing within five
years, or face growth restrictions.</p>
<p>Another reason Treasury wants the GSEs to earn their own
credit rating is that the data generated in the process would
finally allow the government to quantify the size of its GSE
subsidies -- something that cannot be done now.</p>
<p>Even some Members of Congress have become interested. Rep.
Jake Pickle of Texas has held a series of hearings on the
risks inherent in GSEs. Rep. Major Owens, who represents a
liberal New York City district, says the S&L crisis was
caused by "socialized banking." He says disasters in other
federal loan programs could occur if "we refuse to
acknowledge their threat to the economy and general moral
code of our society."</p>
<p>Reform won't be easy. Many in Congress think capital and
credit standards will restrict credit for contributors and
favored constituencies. Last year, Senator Alan Cranston, one
of the Keating Five and a backer of raising the mortgage
exposure of the loss-plagued Federal Housing Authority, tried
to block approval of the Treasury's study of GSEs. He did
succeed in making it a one-time-only study, instead of an
annual report.</p>
<p>Others in Congress say shaping up Fannie, Freddie and the
other GSEs isn't necessary because most are profitable. "If
it ain't broke, don't fix it," was the advice some Senators
gave at a recent Banking Committee hearing. After the S&L
crisis, no one should buy that don't-worry, be-happy line
from Congress. If the S&L mess has taught us anything, it is
that the appropriate time to fix a problem is before rather
than after we wake up to discover a disaster.</p>
