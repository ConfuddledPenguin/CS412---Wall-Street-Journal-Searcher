	<p class="article-leader">Storehouse PLC of Britain said pretax profit for the year
ended March 31 rose 13% to #12.8 million ($21.7 million) from
#11.3 million a year earlier, despite widespread setbacks for
the retailer as increased costs and competitive pressures
hurt profit margins.
   Still, the results were below market estimates of #15
million to #25 million. Profit after taxes, less an
extraordinary loss, or profit attributable to shareholders,
plunged to #1.1 million from #58.8 million. Per-share
earnings, including special items, rose 40% to 2.1 pence from
1.5 pence. Profit from retail operations fell 38% to #39.4
million from #63.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An extraordinary loss of #7.4 million in the latest period
resulted from disposal of the Storecard credit-card business
and closure of the Anonymous fashion chain. Year-earlier
results included a #52.8 million one-time gain, mainly from
surplus from the sale of an investment. Sales rose 8.3% to
#1.3 billion from #1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Storehouse is recommending a final dividend of 2.5 pence a
share, making the total payout five pence, down 43% from 8.8
pence a year earlier.</p>
