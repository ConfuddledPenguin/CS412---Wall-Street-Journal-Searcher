	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- With Greyhound Lines Inc. scrambling to avoid
bankruptcy, its striking employees have enlisted a prominent
investment adviser to organize a union bid to buy the
troubled bus company.
   Brian M. Freeman, who recently guided a proposed union
buy-out of UAL Corp., sent a letter Tuesday to Greyhound
Chairman Fred Currey asking him to discuss a possible
purchase of the strike-hobbled unit of GLI Holding Co. by
Amalgamated Transit Union members.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Freeman declined to discuss the union proposal but in
the letter to Mr. Currey, he called " 100% employee
ownership" the only "feasible and practical" means of
assuring the company's long-term viability although he
indicated that new investment by a third party could also be
an acceptable "variant." He indicated the union would proceed
with a proposal regardless of the company's response.</p>
<p>Saying that the company isn't for sale, Greyhound
officials said they don't plan to discuss the proposal with
Mr. Freeman.</p>
<p>"We are surprised the group that has brought about the
company's current financial crisis through an unprecedented
wave of violence now proposes to profit from its own criminal
activity by buying the company," said P. Anthony Lannie,
Greyhound executive vice president.</p>
<p>The ATU, which represents about 9,400 Greyhound employees,
went on strike against the bus company last March 2.
Strike-related violence led to a $55.8 million loss in the
first quarter, compared with a year-earlier $14.4 million
loss.</p>
<p>Staggered by the losses, Greyhound has missed $5 million
in lease payments due April 30 and a $9.8 million May 15
interest payment on its 13% senior notes due in 1995. The
company has said it may have to file for bankruptcy
protection if it cannot complete a financial restructuring.</p>
<p>A union buy-out bid would be complicated without the
company's cooperation. A majority of the stock, which is not
publicly traded, is owned or controlled by an investor group
led by Mr. Currey.</p>
<p>Holders of the company's publicly traded notes are said to
be grumbling over a recent tender offer from the company to
redeem about $191 million in face amount of debt for about
$86 million in cash. Although the tender offer is the
lynchpin of its financial restructuring, Greyhound says it
hasn't found a source to finance it.</p>
<p>The union, which has held informal discussions with at
least one bondholder, could make a counter offer but some
bondholders questioned whether the ATU could find financing
if the company cannot. "Nobody on the street thinks they'll
get the money," said Robin Rodriguez, chairman of Anglo
American Investors Services Corp., a holder of Greyhound
bonds.</p>
<p>Mr. Rodriguez said he has hired an attorney and begun
organizing other bondholders with an eye toward forcing
Greyhound into Chapter 11 if the company does not improve its
tender offer.</p>
