	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard Breeden said that the current debate over stock-index
futures is similar to the dispute over the savings and loan
crisis and that "people have been warned."
   Mr. Breeden, who is battling with the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission for regulatory control over the
commodity-exchange products, also contended that the U.S.
regulatory structure is "not a strongly successful model that
the whole world tries to emulate. We are losing market share
{in stock-index futures} at a very rapid rate." He added:
"Volume is down in the last three years {in index futures}.
It's not this rapidly growing product."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The arguments, in an interview, were some of the strongest
to date by Mr. Breeden, who has stepped up his rhetoric in an
effort to win support for a Treasury Department proposal to
shift jurisdiction of index futures.</p>
<p>Citing the thrift crisis, Mr. Breeden said, "People have
said, `Why didn't somebody warn us?' Well, here you have a
bunch of people warning." Specifically, he argued that the
leverage created by low margins in the futures industry
causes excess volatility. Noting that margins on index
futures stood at 2.2% before the stock market's plunge last
Oct. 13, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.9%, he
said, "Even thrifts don't have 97.8% leverage."</p>
<p>He said that Congress should move to create federal
oversight of futures margins, which currently are set by the
commodity exchanges and can be changed by the CFTC only in
specific emergencies. Those exchanges are dependent on volume
encouraged by lower margins, Mr. Breeden said. "We have
thought that is something very prudent to try to correct."</p>
<p>Moreover, he argued that the securities markets have been
more innovative in the past decade than the commodities
markets, largely aided by regulators. He cited off-board
trading and upstairs trading in the securities markets, while
commodities markets can only trade by the open outcry method.</p>
<p>Those who argue that innovation has been only in futures
are offering "a complete mischaracterization," Mr. Breeden
said.</p>
