	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Developing stock markets in the Asian-Pacific
region grew faster and performed better than established
markets over the past five years, according to the
International Finance Corp.'s latest survey of emerging
equity markets.
   The report also shows that manufacturing and financial
stocks dominate trading in the region's emerging markets, and
that some of these markets are among the most active and
volatile in the world.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new edition of the IFC's annual emerging-market fact
book shows that the region's developing exchanges have turned
in impressive results over the period. The IFC Asia index,
which tracks stocks in Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan and
Thailand, shot up 558.4% from the end of 1984 to the end of
1989.</p>
<p>By comparison, Standard & Poor's index of 500 U.S. stocks
rose 251.9% in the period. The Europe, Australia and Far East
index, which is calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital
International Perspective and covers developed markets
outside the U.S., rose 474.1%. (All the indexes are
calculated in terms of dollars and are expressed in terms of
total return, including stock-price rises and dividend
payments.)</p>
<p>The IFC, the finance arm of the World Bank, maintains one
of the largest data bases on emerging stock markets. The
organization also helps develop and underwrite international
investment in emerging markets; in Asia, it has been
instrumental in launching numerous single-country mutual
funds, such as the Korea Fund, listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.</p>
<p>The advance of Asian-Pacific emerging markets during the
past half-decade has been even more impressive in terms of
the growth in capitalization. The combined capitalization of
seven developing markets -- India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand -- jumped 850%,
to $485.24 billion. The capitalization of the region's
developed markets -- Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia
and New Zealand -- rose 338%, to $4.66 trillion.</p>
<p>The giant Tokyo market accounted for much of the developed
markets' increase. Its capitalization jumped 363%, to $4.4
trillion, though losses in 1990 have trimmed the gain. The
value of shares on the Singapore market rose 225%, to $35.9
billion. Market capitalization in Australia and Hong Kong
each jumped about 125%, to $136.6 billion and $77.5 billion,
respectively. New Zealand's market value grew the least,
rising 53.9%, to $13.5 billion.</p>
<p>Among the developing markets, Taiwan's capitalization
skyrocketed 2,172%, to $237 billion. The much smaller
Indonesian market jumped nearly as much, rising 2,049%, to
$2.51 billion; most of the increase came in 1989 as the
Jakarta market was opened to more foreign investment.</p>
<p>The capitalization of three other emerging markets each
rose more than 1,200% during the five years: South Korea, to
$140.95 billion; the Philippines, to $11.97 billion; and
Thailand, to $25.65 billion. Capitalization of the Malaysian
market rose 145.5%, to $39.84 billion, while that of India
rose 90%, to $27.32 billion.</p>
<p>Emerging markets in the region also outpaced developed
markets in terms of new listings. Combined listings on the
five developed markets grew 12.9% during the five-year
period, to 4,016 issues. New Zealand's market was the only
one that lost issues over the five-year period; in 1985, 317
issues were listed, but that figure fell 23.7%, to 242
issues, at the end of 1989.</p>
<p>Among the seven developing equity markets, new listings
jumped 40.4%, bringing the total to 7,438 issues. The number
is distorted by India's estimated 6,000 listed issues at the
end of 1989; foreigners currently are barred from investing
in Indian shares.</p>
<p>Three markets that have attracted growing foreign
investment -- Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand -- had mixed
results in their efforts to bring new issues to market. In
the five-year period, the number of issues on the Bangkok
exchange rose 75%, to 175; in neighboring Malaysia, listed
issues climbed only 13.1%, to 251 companies. Listings on
Indonesia's market jumped 154% in 1989 alone. The market had
only 24 listed issues from 1985 through 1988, but a further
37 companies were listed last year as the government
encouraged the market to expand.</p>
<p>The number of listed companies in South Korea grew 83%, to
626, while Taiwan's listings rose 42.5%, to 181. In the
Philippines, the number of listed shares rose just 4.3%, to
144.</p>
<p>According to the IFC report, financial and manufacturing
shares dominate the region's emerging exchanges. At the end
of 1989, a broad sector that includes banks, real-estate and
insurance shares accounted for 44.8% of combined
capitalization; bank shares alone accounted for 27.4%.</p>
