	<p class="article-leader">Nissan Motor Co. said consolidated pretax profit for the
year ended March 31 rose 66% to 333.11 billion yen ($2.2
billion) from 200.82 billion yen a year earlier, and sales
surged 17% to a record 5.645 trillion yen from 4.812 trillion
yen.
   Net income also set a record, 116.01 billion yen, up 1.2%
from 114.63 billion yen a year earlier. Per-share net was
46.25 yen, down from 46.27 yen because of an increase in
shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nissan also posted record unconsolidated pretax profit of
184.27 billion yen, up 19% from 154.77 billion yen. Net rose
34% to 85.377 billion yen from 63.61 billion yen, and
per-share earnings increased to 34.03 yen from 25.68 yen.
Unconsolidated sales increased 12% to a record 4.006 trillion
yen from 3.58 trillion yen.</p>
<p>Nissan vehicle sales rose 5.7% to 2,372,000 from
1,978,000. Demand exceeded production capacity, an official
said, but conceded that the U.S. operations' profit was
"worse than mediocre," because of weakness in that market.</p>
