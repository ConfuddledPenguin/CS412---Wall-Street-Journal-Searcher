	<p class="article-leader">SADAAN, Indonesia -- The funeral of Mantigi, owner of a
bus company in this scenic section of Sulawesi, is fittingly
embellished by a fleet of minibuses parked at the field where
his rites will be held.
   Emerging from the vehicles aren't Mr. Mantigi's relatives
or friends -- they are present already -- but rather a gaggle
of camera-toting, middle-aged European tourists whose
ignorance of the deceased doesn't damp their desire to join
his bier party.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We couldn't visit Sulawesi without going to a funeral," a
French woman says. "There's nothing like it in Europe."</p>
<p>There's nothing like Toraja, a hilly district offering
breathtaking panoramas and bizarre traditions for celebrating
death. Life in this area is intriguing, but death is a
cabaret that draws an ever-growing crowd. Mortuary tourism,
as one scholar calls it, is alive and thriving.</p>
<p>Strangers didn't need to call Mr. Mantigi's bus company to
get the schedule of his rites. Staff in local hotels spread
the word to guests. There's also a bulletin board outside the
tourist office in Rantepao, the district capital, listing the
week's funerals -- and sometimes the number of buffaloes
slated for slaughter.</p>
<p>The buffalo is far more than a beast of burden to Toraja's
350,000 residents. Beyond playing a central role in seeing
someone off to the Land of Souls, the animal often functions
as the local currency and key indicator of social status.</p>
<p>At Mr. Mantigi's rites, some buffalo meat will be set
aside for his future nourishment. Much will be distributed to
funeral guests under a complex allocation system reflecting
the recipient's social standing.</p>
<p>The richer the deceased, the more buffaloes get
slaughtered; about 40 shuffle off for Mr. Mantigi. As the
cost of a prize buffalo can reach two million rupiah
($1,100), the ceremonies can easily wipe out family savings.
In a province with per capita income of about $300, it's not
uncommon for funerals to cost more than $25,000. The 1978
funeral of a nobleman -- traditional Toraja society was made
up of nobles, commoners and slaves -- cost more than
$200,000.</p>
<p>Slavery has long been abolished, but keen competition
among families to throw bigger feasts is chaining many
Torajans to a lifetime of debt. Neighbors help out at funeral
time by contributing buffaloes, knowing that the expensive
favor must be returned.</p>
<p>The death fests are only one of an elaborate series of
steps most Torajans follow over months or even years to mark
the departure of a family member. Some ceremonies are
private, and allow relatives to express grief. But at the
Mantigi gathering, there's no sign of mourning or
bereavement.</p>
<p>For the foreigners, though, there's a notable loss of
enthusiasm when blood spurts and the buffaloes lay dying in
the grass, emitting pitiable sounds. Hardly any of the
tourists train their cameras on the sight. The French woman
has found that weavings sold nearby are more to her taste.
But she can't browse for long, as her group has realized it's
time to head for burial sites inside cliffs about 15
kilometers away.</p>
<p>By pulling out early, they miss most of the party. Meat is
distributed, potent palm wine flows freely, bullfights begin
and Mr. Mantigi officially loses his status as one among the
living. In Toraja, a deceased person isn't considered truly
dead until the buffaloes are slaughtered.</p>
<p>These days, foreigners are one small reason funerals are
so costly. The presence of visitors from afar gives status to
the deceased's family, which wants to flaunt wealth --
whether it has some or not -- through a big feast.</p>
<p>Government officials worry that local attention to social
standing will destroy the finances of many Torajans. The
governor of South Sulawesi province, Achmad Amiruddin, says
some families are "overdoing" the funerals. "Traditionally,
even the higher-class people were asked to bring only 24
carabao. Now it's hundreds. It's a waste, done for show," the
governor says. Mr. Amiruddin has tried, so far without
success, to get village headmen to limit the number of
buffaloes killed. "They told me that as long as the old
generation is around, it's tough to change," he says.</p>
