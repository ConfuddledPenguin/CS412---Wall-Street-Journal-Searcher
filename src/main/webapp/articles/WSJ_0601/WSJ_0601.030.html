	<p class="article-leader">Julie Salamon's review of the movie "Longtime Companion"
(Leisure & Arts, May 10), while positive in general overview,
harbored underlying prejudices that I found disturbing. The
implication that homosexuals are other than familiar and
likable, and that they live on the fringe, serves only to
emphasize the point that society seeks to isolate those
largely affected by acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   It is precisely this bigoted attitude that promotes
superficial judgment and obliterates one of the major health
concerns in this country. It is unfortunate that more
deliberate attention will not be made toward conquering this
fatal disease until it either begins to ravage the
heterosexual population or until heterosexuals begin to
accept the fact that homosexuals do indeed lead respectable,
middle-class lives, no different from their own.</p>
