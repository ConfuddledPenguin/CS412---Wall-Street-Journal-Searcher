	<p class="article-leader">Schering-Plough Corp., Madison, N.J., said it will spend
$20 million over the next five years to acquire the rights to
new technology aimed at treating Alzheimer's disease and
other degenerative brain disorders.
   Schering, a pharmaceutical and health products company,
said it will fund projects under way at Cephalon Inc., a
small, research-based company in West Chester, Pa., that is
developing drugs to treat neurological illnesses. The
agreement is expected to help Schering jump into the search
for drugs to fight brain-related disorders, one of the most
attractive and fast-growing research areas in the
pharmaceutical industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Specifically, Schering will get access to two Cephalon
projects designed to develop novel types of drugs against
Alzheimer's disease, a progressive illness that causes
premature senility and death. Cephalon's scientists have
developed several prototype drugs that block the action of an
enzyme in the brain. The enzyme, called clipsin, is involved
in the formation of plaque deposits in the brain that
scientists believe cause the destruction of important nerve
cells.</p>
