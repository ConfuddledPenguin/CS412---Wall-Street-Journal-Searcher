	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Hounded by two new investigations and under
increasing pressure from the Federal Reserve, the Bank of
Credit & Commerce International is planning to close most of
its U.S. operations.
   An internal status report prepared by B.A. Palkhiwala,
general manager of the Luxembourg-based bank's U.S. branches,
said that its problems include a large batch of "classified
loans," or loans of questionable value. The report added that
these loans will complicate "contingency plans" of the once
fast-growing bank to close its Florida and California offices
and consolidate operations in its New York City office. A
copy of the report was obtained by The Wall Street Journal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The report said the New York office is being investigated
by the district attorney's office in Manhattan, which has
issued subpoenas for records of six accounts. It added that
there is a separate investigation under way by federal
prosecutors in Miami that poses a "very serious danger" of a
new indictment against the bank and some of its U.S.
officers.</p>
<p>A statement issued yesterday from BCCI's London
headquarters said that Mr. Palkhiwala's report presented a
limited view of the reorganization alternatives being
considered and that it represented Mr. Palkhiwala's views and
not necessarily those of the bank. BCCI, which has $21
billion of assets, added that it has more than enough assets
to cover classified loans and that it is "completely
confident" it won't be indicted in Miami.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, BCCI pleaded guilty to an indictment
accusing it of drug-related, money-laundering charges brought
by U.S. prosecutors in Tampa, Fla. According to federal
officials, BCCI is one of the targets of a separate
investigation under way in Miami that is examining why the
bank temporarily injected $25 million into CenTrust Bank of
Miami in 1988 at a time when federal examiners were
questioning CenTrust's soundness.</p>
<p>CenTrust went into receivership in March and is expected
to cost U.S. taxpayers about $2 billion. BCCI attorneys have
said there was nothing illegal about the transaction.</p>
<p>The report stated that Zafar Iqbal, who is head of the
management reorganization committee for BCCI's new owners in
Abu Dhabi, will meet this month with Federal Reserve
officials in New York and Washington who have been applying
"pressure" to meet with a top BCCI official.</p>
<p>The bank currently is working on plans to close offices in
Miami, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The report said that
these plans are complicated by a bad-loan portfolio that the
Federal Reserve has said can't be transferred to another
branch within the U.S. "The substantial portfolio of
classified loans," the report stated, "will need handling in
order to prevent massive write-offs."</p>
<p>In its statement from London, BCCI said that $29 million
of its $152 million loan portfolio in Miami is classified --
which is banking jargon for loans that may not be repaid in
full. The bank said a recent infusion of more than $600
million is "more than adequate" to cover any losses, both in
Miami and elsewhere. Mr. Palkhiwala's report noted that
federal and state regulators are concerned that BCCI records
may be destroyed or lost during a consolidation. It suggested
that all records be microfilmed and kept in a central
repository.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the New York district attorney's office
said it could neither confirm nor deny that it was
investigating BCCI's New York office, which runs most of the
bank's U.S. operations.</p>
<p>In April, BCCI announced it was being reorganized after a
large cash infusion from Sheik Zayed al-Nahyan, president of
the United Arab Emirates and the ruler of oil-rich Abu Dhabi.
Previously it had been controlled by a group of Pakistani
bankers in London who experienced large losses in 1989 as the
result of unsecured or poorly collateralized loans.</p>
