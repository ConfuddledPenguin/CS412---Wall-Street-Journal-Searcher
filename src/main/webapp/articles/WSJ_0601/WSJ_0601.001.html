	<p class="article-leader">LANDOVER, Md. -- Hechinger Co. expects its Home Quarters
Warehouse subsidiary to become "the primary growth vehicle
for the company," John Hechinger Jr., president and chief
executive officer, told Dow Jones.
   The retailer of home-improvement products and equipment
currently operates a total of 108 outlets, including 16 Home
Quarters units. Nine more Home Quarters outlets are scheduled
to open in the next few months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Certainly, opening new stores will have a dampening
effect on earnings" for the near term, Mr. Hechinger
conceded. He said the company will open four Home Quarters
units in Boston and will enter the markets of Columbus, Ga.;
Birmingham and Montgomery, Ala.; and Newport News, Va.</p>
<p>Last year, the company opened four Home Quarters outlets
and 13 Hechinger stores. This year, it will open only two new
Hechinger stores.</p>
<p>Home Quarters stores, which have about 105,000 square feet
and are nearly twice the size of traditional Hechinger
outlets, carry fewer items and take a more aggressive
discounting approach.</p>
<p>"One of the big misconceptions with our business is that
it is affected by housing starts," Mr. Hechinger said. The
company targets owners of existing, single-family homes for
do-it-yourself improvements.</p>
<p>In general, the home-improvement industry is "highly
fragmented," Mr. Hechinger said. "The top 25 chains represent
a small portion of the total business done in the category."
He predicted there will be "fewer and fewer larger players."</p>
<p>For the fiscal year ended Feb. 3, Hechinger reported
earnings of $34.2 million, or 95 cents a share, on revenue of
$1.23 billion. On Tuesday, Hechinger reported that
first-quarter profit rose 15% to $8.4 million, or 23 cents a
share, from $7.3 million, or 21 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue rose 20% in the latest quarter.</p>
<p>Mr. Hechinger declined to make a specific projection for
fiscal 1991, but he expressed confidence in the outlook. "I
feel good about our company's prospects for the future," he
said. "We've grown at 25% a year for 20 years, and I expect a
continued 20% growth range in new markets."</p>
