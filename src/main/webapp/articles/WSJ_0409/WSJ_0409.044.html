	<p class="article-leader">Not once in "Here's The Bad News on The Underclass"
(editorial page, March 8) does Charles Murray mention the
primary reason for nonparticipation by many young black men
in the U.S. labor force. It is illiteracy. More than 40 out
of 100 American blacks leave school after six to 12 years,
unable to make sense out of printed pages or labels. And it
is a reasonable guess that 30 to 35 out of that 40 are young
black men.
   Thirty-five years ago, Rudolph Flesch (doctorate from
Teachers College at Columbia University) told us in "Why
Johnny Can't Read" that four out of five who cannot learn to
read with whole-word recognition or "see and say" reading
instruction (used in 80% to 90% of our first-, second- and
third-grade classes since 1950) are males. That is why the
title of his best seller did not include "Jane."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Single mothers, low income and increased crime may
accompany unemployment, but they do not cause it. Illiteracy
produces unemployment, single mothers, low incomes and
increased crime. Illiterate black men, unable to support
themselves, do not marry the mothers of their children.
Young, illiterate black men, unable to hold legal jobs, often
take illegal jobs. Literacy is not a requirement for selling
drugs. Crime bosses are among the few equal-opportunity
employers for illiterates.</p>
<p>Black leaders must stop blaming whites, and white leaders
must stop blaming society for unemployed and unemployable
young black illiterate men. Both groups should look at the
majority-black, English-speaking islands of Barbados,
Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Caymans, St. Helena,
Ascension, Trinidad and Dominica for a solution. For these
are all islands where 95% to 98% out of 100 blacks can read
just about anything they want to read. And literacy produces
employment just as surely as illiteracy produces
unemployment.</p>
<p>In his 1983 book, "The Economics of Politics and Race,"
Thomas Sowell notes that black families in the U.S. from the
West Indies produce almost 40% higher incomes than black
families from any state in America. Why? Caribbean blacks
have similar genetic and historical backgrounds. The British
abolished slavery in the West Indies and Bermuda only 34
years before the Civil War ended it in the U.S.</p>
<p>The answer must be that British-trained teachers in those
islands have never stopped teaching children to read by
matching sounds with letters that spell sounds. They never
abandoned phonics. They never adopted "see and say" -- which,
according to Mr. Murray, apparently doesn't work well for
young white males either. For 20 out of 100 young white men
are in that same unbudgeable, unemployed and unemployable
group -- the illiterate young men who don't even ask for
jobs.</p>
