	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Mesa Limited Partnership said it dropped efforts
to sell interests in some of its prime properties for up to
$400 million, a move that was intended to reduce the
company's heavy debt load.
   The natural-gas producer, led by outspoken investor T.
Boone Pickens Jr., said Friday that it has abandoned a plan
to sell about 16 million units in a new Hugoton Royalty
Trust, made up of some of its top natural gas properties,
because of the market's disappointing reaction to its
offering. Mesa said its underwriters indicated the price
would be lower than the $23 to $26 a unit it had hoped for.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We're simply not going to sell a portion of our premier
properties at an inferior price," Mr. Pickens said.</p>
<p>But scrapping the plan leaves the company with a huge debt
burden, which stood at $1.52 billion on Dec. 31, and annual
interest costs that ran to $183 million last year, or more
than half of Mesa's $356 million in 1989 revenue.</p>
<p>A Mesa spokesman said that the company is continuing to
explore alternatives to shrink its debt. Meanwhile, he said,
dropping the offering won't leave Mesa in a liquidity bind
because it had about $350 million in cash and marketable
securities at year end and another $150 million in borrowing
capacity.</p>
<p>But Sal Ilacqua, an analyst at Rothschild Inc., said that
Mesa may have to reconsider whether to continue paying its
preferred distribution of $1.50 a unit for the time being.
The distribution is guaranteed until next year, but Mesa
could delay the payout, he said.</p>
<p>At the least, Mr. Ilacqua said, Mesa should begin
liquidating its marketable securities portfolio of about $243
million. For several years, Mesa has relied on profits from
stock-market trading to improve its cash flow. But Mr.
Ilacqua noted that "the takeover game has not been that
rewarding" of late and Mesa should use part of its portfolio
to reduce its debt.</p>
<p>To improve its cash flow, Mesa recently eliminated its
annual common distribution of $1.50 a unit and sold or agreed
to sell about 1.5 million shares of Edisto Resources Corp.,
reducing its stake in that energy company to about 15%.</p>
<p>Mesa, one of the nation's largest natural gas producers,
has repeatedly bet that natural gas prices would improve and
has watched the gamble fail as prices remained stubbornly
low. In hopes that prices would rise, Mesa previously
borrowed to make its common distribution and, in 1988, paid
$715 million to acquire some properties from Tenneco Inc. A
company spokesman said Mesa believes the market reaction to
its Hugoton offering was lukewarm because natural gas prices
currently are lower than they have been for several years at
this time, and the weakest season for natural gas demand is
just beginning.</p>
