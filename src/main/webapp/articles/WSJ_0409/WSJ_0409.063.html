	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The World Bank is pressuring Zairean
President Mobutu Sese Seko to spend more money on programs
for his impoverished people and less on security, political
institutions and presidential perks.
   To that end, the international financial institution is
holding up disbursing about $100 million in non-project loans
to the Central African government, according to persons
familiar with the decision. They said the funds won't be
disbursed until Mr. Mobutu shows a willingness to spend more
on health, education and other public services. Some World
Bank funds earmarked for specific projects will continue to
be disbursed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The World Bank's action surfaced as some in Congress
stepped up their attacks on Mr. Mobutu, whose regime often
has been attacked on Capitol Hill for corruption and
human-rights abuses. Mr. Mobutu, a close ally of the U.S., is
thought to be among the world's richest men, with estimates
of his wealth reaching as high as $5 billion. The average
Zairean earns less than $200 a year, according to World Bank
figures.</p>
<p>Last week, Howard Wolpe (D., Mich.), the chairman of the
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Africa, and another
prominent House Democrat, Stephen Solarz of New York, called
on lawmakers to cut off all military aid to Zaire and to
further restrict economic assistance. Both testified before a
House appropriations subcommittee that is considering the
Bush administration's request for $56 million in economic and
military aid for Zaire.</p>
<p>The U.S. gives Zaire only about $4 million a year in
military assistance. But if the Congress cuts off such aid,
some Mobutu congressional critics believe, it would be a
powerful signal that U.S. support for the Zairean strongman
was weakening. Last year, Mr. Mobutu embarked on an expensive
public relations campaign to influence Congress.</p>
<p>The World Bank, meanwhile, isn't likely to restore
non-project assistance for many months. World Bank figures
show that less than 8% of Zaire's $1.2 billion budget is
spent on health and education, while the bulk of the money
goes for presidential spending, foreign-debt service,
security, defense and political institutions Mr. Mobutu
controls. Last year, Mr. Mobutu's congressional critics cited
U.S. and World Bank reports that the Zairean government
hadn't accounted for $400 million in export earnings.</p>
<p>In recent months, the World Bank hasn't been able to reach
agreement with the Zairean government on a new spending
program, according to persons familiar with the discussions.
World Bank officials, these persons say, emphasized to Zaire
that much more money needed to be spent on education and
other programs that would promote economic growth in the
country.</p>
<p>They said that even if the World Bank reaches an agreement
with Zaire, it isn't likely that the $100 million in loans
will be disbursed for at least six months. In the past, the
Mobutu government has reneged on promises after funds were
released, these sources said.</p>
