	<p class="article-leader">TROY, Mich. -- MLX Corp. said that its Refrigeration & Air
Conditioning Group has agreed with its senior lenders on a
plan to restructure its credit facilities.
   Under the agreement, the senior lenders will exchange
$33.5 million of the group's $163.5 million term loan for MLX
junior subordinated notes and shares of MLX common stock. The
senior lenders will also extend the final maturity of the
remaining term loan and reduce the amortization of that debt.
The pact also calls for the senior lenders to reduce the
interest rates on the remaining term loan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement, approved by MLX's board, is subject to
approval by senior lenders and is contingent on other closing
conditions.</p>
<p>MLX said the agreement will allow senior management to
return the focus to running this distributor of commercial
refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.</p>
