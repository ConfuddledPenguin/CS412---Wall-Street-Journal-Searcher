	<p class="article-leader">The thrift industry sold or wrote down an estimated 22% of
its junk-bond holdings in the fourth quarter, incurring large
and controversial losses that are helping to swell the
overall cost of bailing out the sick industry.
   At Dec. 31, the total amount of junk bonds held by savings
and loan associations fell to $10.59 billion, or $2.93
billion less than the $13.52 billion held at Sept. 30,
according to government data collected by Sheshunoff
Information Services, an Austin, Texas,
financial-institutions research firm. The reduction reflects
outright sales of junk as well as write-downs to reflect
their deteriorating market value over the last several
months. Such write-downs are in effect required as part of
the thrift bailout law that Congress passed last August.
Under the law, thrifts must also divest their entire holdings
by the end of 1994.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, the reduction is proving increasingly painful
and costly. Of the 198 thrifts holding junk bonds at year
end, 36 have failed, including seven of the top 15, according
to the Sheshunoff report. Several other junk-bond-holding
thrifts are considered in imminent danger of a federal
seizure, including Columbia Savings & Loan Association of
Beverly Hills, Calif., the largest S&L holder of junk bonds
with $3.69 billion at year end. Columbia said last week that
junk-bond losses through February had left it insolvent.</p>
<p>As a result of federal takeovers of troubled institutions,
the federal Resolution Trust Corp. is now one of the nation's
biggest holders of junk bonds, with roughly $3.6 billion, or
enough to rival top-rated Columbia, according to the
Sheshunoff data. Lately, the government has been assembling a
junk-bond team to sell the portfolio, although it says it has
no plans to dump the junk quickly.</p>
<p>Junk-bond losses are also rapidly adding to the estimated
government tab for resolving the S&L crisis. On Friday, the
Congressional Budget Office revised to $325 billion from $257
billion its estimate of cleaning up the mess over a 30-year
period. Other analysts suggest that amount of loss will occur
in the next decade alone. Junk bonds are also accounting for
a growing share of the industry's on-going operating losses,
according to Kenneth Thomas, a Miami thrift consultant. Mr.
Thomas estimated that junk-bond losses alone accounted for
about 17%, or $1.2 billion, of the S&L industry's $6.5
billion aggregate net losses in the fourth quarter. He also
said losses could increase because many thrifts have been
selling only their "best" junk bonds lately and holding onto
their most troubled issues.</p>
<p>"I am sure the regulators rue the day they ever permitted
S&Ls to buy junk bonds," said Allan Bortel, a San Francisco
thrift analyst and consultant.</p>
<p>The issue is a bitter pill for some managers of junk-laden
thrifts to swallow, and it is also creating some rather
strange anomalies. Many such executives believe the
requirement to write down their holdings to market prices is
arbitrary and unfair because other thrifts and banks aren't
generally required to carry their assets at market. They said
the write-down and sales requirements are further depressing
an already weak market for such bonds.</p>
<p>"When you make decisions based on holding assets to
maturity and then the rules change in the middle of the
ballgame, it is very difficult to be able to react," said a
spokesman for Mississippi Savings Bank, of Batesville, Miss.
About 17% of the thrift's $185 million in assets are junk
bonds. Recent write-downs left it in violation of minimum
federal capital standards. "We are not optimistic," the
spokesman added.</p>
<p>Government regulators may also have exacerbated the
dilemma by allowing new private owners of once-failed thrifts
to continue buying junk bonds. Such institutions as American
Savings Bank, of Stockton, Calif., and Far West Federal Bank,
of Portland, Ore., built up significant junk-bond portfolios
following government-arranged private takeovers. American
Savings, which had about $493.6 million in junk bonds at
year-end, couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Officials of Far West Federal said its roughly $130
million portfolio was closely regulated, that its write-downs
have approximated only about 5% of the total portfolio
through March 31, and that it has suffered no actual defaults
on any of its holdings. "It is not a junky junk portfolio,"
asserted David Nierenberg, Far West's chairman. The thrift
has nonetheless sued the federal government in Portland
federal court, alleging that it improperly backed out of a
rescue plan aimed at allowing Far West to rebuild its capital
through a series of complicated financial transactions known
as risk-controlled-arbitrage.</p>
<p>By contrast, United Savings Assocation of Texas, has
reduced its junk-bond portfolio to about $129 million
currently from more than $500 million at the time the thrift
was taken over in late 1988 by a group including former
Salomon Brothers Inc. executive Lewis Ranieri, a spokesman
for that thrift said.</p>
<p>But actual losses have been increasing, also. In a filing
last week with the federal Office of Thrift Supervision,
Columbia Savings, for example, said its non-accural junk
bonds had grown an additional $431.4 million just since Dec.
31, or 80% more than the $521.6 million in troubled junk it
reported at year-end. Columbia is basing its survival plan on
trying to sell its entire portfolio in a single transaction,
possibly as soon as the third quarter.</p>
