	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- McKesson Corp. said its unit, MCK
Acquisition Corp., extended until this Friday its previously
announced $20-a-share cash offer for the shares of PCS Inc.
that it doesn't already own. The tender offer was set to
expire today.
   In December, McKesson, which already held 86.2% of PCS's
14.5 million shares, offered to buy the rest of the company.
The transaction is valued at about $40 million. McKesson, a
drug-distribution concern, said that as of last week, 346,061
shares had been tendered. PCS processes thirdparty
prescription drug claims for insurers.</p>
