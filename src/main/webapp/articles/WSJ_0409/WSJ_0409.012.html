	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Japonica Partners said it filed suit against
Allegheny International Inc. in federal bankruptcy court in
Pittsburgh seeking to disallow all votes cast in favor of a
reorganization plan proposed by Allegheny and to deny
confirmation of the plan.
   Allegheny is seeking an arrangement with creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. Japonica, a New
York investment and merchant-banking firm, is pressing its
own plan for reorganizing Allegheny, a maker of appliances
and other products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier last week, Japonica prevented Allegheny from
obtaining the necessary two-thirds approval of all classes of
creditors for its plan, and Allegheny said it would sue to
disallow the votes of Japonica.</p>
