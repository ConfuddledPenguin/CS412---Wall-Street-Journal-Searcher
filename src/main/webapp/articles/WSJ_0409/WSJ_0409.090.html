	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- The Soviet Union announced its first trade
deficit in 14 years amid growing signs President Mikhail
Gorbachev is considering big purchases of Western consumer
goods to cushion the impact of his economic overhaul program.
   According to official statistics published over the
weekend, the Soviet trade balance swung to a deficit of 3.3
billion rubles ($5.4 billion) in 1989 from a surplus of 2.1
billion rubles in 1988. A drop in exports of oil and other
raw materials and increased imports of Western goods were the
main causes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government statistics office also issued preliminary
figures for the first three months of this year that showed
continued deterioration of the economy. Industrial production
dropped 1.2% before adjustment for inflation in the first
quarter, largely because of strikes and ethnic unrest in
parts of the country. At the same time, inflation showed no
sign of slowing, with average wages rising by 9%, according
to the Izvestia newspaper.</p>
<p>Faced with such economic problems and widespread
shortages, Mr. Gorbachev is expected to unveil a package of
economic reform measures soon, perhaps this week. He has
called for a "radicalization" of economic overhaul involving
a push toward setting up a market economy, but few details of
his plans have leaked out.</p>
<p>But a senior West German banker who met leading Soviet
officials last week said the Kremlin is clearly looking for
new credits to finance a big import program. The banker, who
asked not to be identified, said Moscow is hoping for
substantial assistance from Western Europe and the U.S.,
particularly following next month's superpower summit.</p>
<p>The Soviet government so far has been reluctant to embark
on a crash import program, which Prime Minister Nikolai
Ryzhkov has warned would further weaken the economy. But some
of Mr. Gorbachev's advisers say the planned reforms, which
are expected to include big price increases for many goods,
must be accompanied by measures to win public confidence and
curb potential unrest.</p>
<p>"The president and his cabinet must be ready to take
several painful and unpopular decisions, and at the same time
they must keep the trust of the people," Nikolai Petrakov, an
economist who has become a personal adviser to Mr. Gorbachev,
told a Soviet newspaper last week. He advocated taking out
large credits to buy consumer goods, and even raised the
prospect of seeking large-scale assistance from the West
along the lines of a Marshall plan.</p>
<p>If Mr. Gorbachev follows such advice, he will be picking
the worst time in years to embark on a credit-financed
spending spree. The cost of Soviet borrowing on Western
financial markets has soared in recent weeks, largely because
of political upheaval in the U.S.S.R. and long delays on
payments by Soviet organizations to Western companies.</p>
<p>Mr. Petrakov and several other leading Soviet economists
spent the weekend in a dacha outside Moscow, working out
details of the program that will be submitted to Mr.
Gorbachev and his council of presidential advisers this week.
Soviet officials say privately that several versions could be
submitted, enabling the president to choose between drastic
Polish-style measures to free prices and sell off state
industries and more cautious moves involving a gradual
transition to a market economy.</p>
<p>Leonid Abalkin, a deputy prime minister in charge of
economic overhaul, said last week that the Soviet Union won't
copy the Polish model because of substantial differences
between the economies of the two nations. But he and other
officials concede that speedy moves are needed to shake off
the old system of bureaucratic economic management, put more
goods into Soviet stores and curb a runaway money supply that
could spark serious inflation. Soviet economists estimate
people are sitting on about 165 billion rubles that they
would spend if they could find something to buy.</p>
<p>Soviet officials say opposition to a rapid move toward a
full-fledged market system is strongest among members of the
Communist Party Central Committee and the labor unions. If
Mr. Gorbachev goes ahead with a radical option, he would also
be undermining the position of his prime minister, Mr.
Ryzhkov, who only last December presented a more cautious
economic program to parliament.</p>
<p>But the gloomy trade figures paint a picture of an economy
in need of an urgent fix. The Soviet Union last year was
forced to import 360 million rubles worth of soap and
detergent, more than six times the amount of the previous
year, after panic-buying broke out among consumers. Moscow
tripled purchases of coffee and vegetable oil to make up for
domestic shortages, while grain imports jumped almost 6% to
37 million metric tons. The major beneficiaries of the boost
in imports were West Germany, the U.S., Italy, Britain and
other West European nations.</p>
<p>By contrast, oil exports, the Soviet Union's largest
foreign-currency earner, dropped almost 12% to 127.3 million
metric tons, and coal and steel sales were also far below
levels of the previous year. Although Moscow increased its
exports to Western industrialized nations, it cut back on
deliveries to Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Overall, imports soared to 72.1 billion rubles from 65
billion rubles in 1989, while exports rose only slightly to
68.8 billion rubles from 67.1 billion rubles.</p>
