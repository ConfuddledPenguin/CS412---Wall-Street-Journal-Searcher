	<p class="article-leader">SAN DIEGO -- Financially troubled Computer &
Communications Technology Corp. said it agreed in principle
to merge with closely held Sunward Technologies, resulting in
new, 55% majority control of the company by Sunward
shareholders.
   Computer & Communications Technology also disclosed that
it has technically defaulted on $8.7 million of debt and that
it expects to report a $12.4 million fourth-quarter loss,
largely because of one-time charges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue for the latest quarter was about $17.6 million.
The loss for 1989 totals about $17.3 milllion on revenue of
$61.5 million, the company said.</p>
<p>The proposed merger is subject to shareholder and bank
approval. Both companies make magnetic recording heads for
computer disk drives and jointly represent about 40% of the
world-wide non-captive market for such products, said Gary
Hall, chief financial officer of Computer & Communications
Technology. Both companies are based in San Diego.</p>
<p>The merged company will adopt the Sunward Technologies
name. However, Computer & Communications, technically the
continuing entity, will issue 14.5 million new shares to
Sunward holders. Computer & Communications Technology
currently has about 11.3 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Everett Bahre, chairman, president, and chief executive
officer of Computer Communications & Technology, said the
merger will "substantially reduce manufacturing and operating
expenses" as well as add about $6.5 million of cash at
Sunward to the combined balance sheet. Sunward had revenue
last year of $42.1 million.</p>
<p>Sunward has manufacturing operations in the Philippines,
and about 1,500 employees. Computer Communications &
Technology, with manufacturing operations in South Korea and
Puerto Rico, has about 2,000 employees.</p>
