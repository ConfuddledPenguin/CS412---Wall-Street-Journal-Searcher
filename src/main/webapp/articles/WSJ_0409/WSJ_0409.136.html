	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Given foreigners' high-profile purchases of
U.S. real estate and U.S. companies, foreign investment
sometimes seems a one-way street. Foreigners, especially the
Japanese, are accused of buying up America.
   This is a half-truth at best. Foreign investment is
flowing into the U.S., but capital also is flowing out
rapidly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>American companies are spending more and more on
acquisitions overseas, especially in Europe. Moreover, they
are raising their foreign spending on plant and equipment at
a record pace. One recent example: General Motors' Opel unit
plans to spend more than $500 million on a car-building joint
venture in East Germany.</p>
<p>The larger issue is whether U.S. companies are likely to
be leaders or laggards in the trend toward the globalization
of markets and industries. Companies operating in the major
markets of North America, Europe and Asia are far more likely
to prosper in the 1990s than those that don't, experts say.
So, U.S. companies' stepped-up activity abroad is an
encouraging sign.</p>
<p>For many U.S. companies, the spending increases are a
matter of building on their past success. Large American
companies have long been important in Europe; some are even
more competitive than their European and Japanese rivals.</p>
<p>"IBM and Digital Equipment are very strong. They made most
of their money in Europe last year," notes Todd Hixon at
Boston Consulting Group.</p>
<p>Much of such profits is being plowed back into operations
overseas. Last week, the Commerce Department estimated that
U.S. plant-and-equipment spending overseas would rise 13%
this year to $54.9 billion.</p>
<p>Western Europe and the newly industrialized countries of
Asia are the big investment targets. "Increases in Europe
have been in double digits since 1987," says Raymond J.
Mataloni at the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.
"And spending in the NICs during the last three years has
been up 37%, up 31% and up 24%."</p>
<p>Another form of investment into Europe is acquisitions of
European companies. Translink's European Deal Review notes a
big upturn in intra-European takeovers. And smaller U.S.
companies are rushing to buy companies, both in Britain and
on the Continent, with 185 acquisitions valued at $15.2
billion last year, about double the 1988 level.</p>
<p>Such figures are only partial measures of foreign
investment, however. Direct foreign investment in the U.S. is
increasing faster than Americans' direct investment overseas.
And in 1988, for the first time, the total book value of
foreign holdings in the U.S. in 1988 exceeded U.S. holdings
overseas. At the end of 1989, the foreign holdings totaled
$390 billion, compared with U.S. overseas holdings of $368.1
billion. However, since inflation leaves book values far
below market values, the true worth of the U.S. holdings,
which are far older on the average, is greatly understated.</p>
<p>Japanese investors have emerged as some of the most
aggressive investors in American real estate and American
companies, and their purchases of "trophy" assets -- such as
Sony's acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment and
Mitsubishi Estate's purchase of a controlling interest in
Rockefeller Center -- has sparked a political outcry on
Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>However, another view suggests that foreign investment
flows to the economies with the strongest growth prospects.
During much of the 1980s, the economy in the United States
expanded rapidly and thus sucked in foreign capital. But what
about the 1990s? "The U.S. will attract investment, although
more slowly," says John Rutter, a senior economist at the
Commerce Department.</p>
<p>The rate of growth in foreign investment in the U.S.,
including that by the British and Japanese, slowed a bit last
year. "European and Japanese buyers are choosing to focus
more heavily on Europe," says Ilan Kaufthal, managing
director at Wertheim Schroder & Co.</p>
<p>The one area where investment flows remain lopsided is
Japan, which historically has been inhospitable to foreign
investment. Acquisitions of Japanese companies are still
rare, partly because selling a company is repugnant to many
Japanese. Less than 1% of Japanese corporate assets were in
foreign hands in 1986, according to a study by the
London-based Royal Institute for International Studies. The
U.S. figure was 5%, and Britain and West Germany had in
excess of 10% in foreign hands.</p>
<p>Last week, U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators reached an
agreement for Japan to relax its investment rules. If the
investment inflow does expand, it could increase trade and
reduce tensions across the Pacific. But if investment remains
largely one way, protectionists may well try to close the
investment street or at least limit the traffic from Japan.</p>
