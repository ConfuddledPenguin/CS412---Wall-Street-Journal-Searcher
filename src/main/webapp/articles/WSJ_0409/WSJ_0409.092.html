	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Repap Enterprises Inc. "isn't as confident" as
it was six weeks ago that it will at least match 1989 net
income this year, said George Petty, chairman and chief
executive, after a presentation to analysts here.
   Last year, Repap had net income of 93.1 million Canadian
dollars (US$79.7 million), or C$1.79 (US$1.53) a share, on
revenue of C$1.22 billion. In February, Mr. Petty said in an
interview that the pulp and coated paper producer expected to
at least match 1989 net income this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Petty said the first half looks
"tougher-than-expected," but Repap is "still very optimistic"
about the second half. He said the Canadian dollar and
interest rates are higher than anticipated this year, both of
which hurt earnings.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading Friday, Repap closed at $7.50,
up 12.5 cents.</p>
