	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- General Electric Co. filed a $1.15 billion
suit against Daimler-Benz AG, charging the West German
industrial group with breaking an agreement to develop
high-thrust commercial jet engines.
   The suit stems from Daimler-Benz entering "a memorandum of
understanding" with United Technologies Corp. on a wide range
of commercial engine programs between their jet engine units.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GE charged in the suit, filed in federal court here, that
Daimler-Benz broke the exclusive and binding relationship in
this area with the company. GE, a Fairfield, Conn.,
manufacturer, claims that proprietary and other sensitive
information it shared with Daimler will find its way into the
hands of its competitor, United Technologies.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz said it is studying the suit but as yet sees
no basis for it.</p>
<p>In the suit, GE said that for more than 25 years its
aircraft engine unit and Daimler's Motoren-und Turbinen-Union
unit, known as MTU, have been "parties to a series of
contracts" in which they have shared "highly confidential
technological information, revenues and costs in the
development and sale of commercial jet engines."</p>
<p>According to the court papers, in 1981 GE entered into a
contract with MTU under which GE shared a variety of
information in connection with the development of a subsonic
jet engine for commercial aircraft. That engine is now a
major source of revenue for GE's aircraft engine business.
Then in 1988, GE and MTU signed a letter of agreement to
cooperate in a program to develop the next generation of
high-thrust commercial jet engines.</p>
<p>The latest agreement on high-thrust engines also stated
that "for the life of this program, MTU will not participate"
with competitors of GE in programs involving engines in the
thrust range over 50,000 pounds, GE said. GE's cooperative
arrangement with MTU on the new generation of jet engines,
known as GE90, intended to ultimately have thrust of 95,000
pounds or greater. These engines are aimed at powering
next-generation widebody planes.</p>
<p>GE said it has shared detailed design specifications,
thrust ratios, parts configurations and fuel efficiency and
materials data with MTU. "The extent of the proprietary
information provided to MTU enables MTU or a competitor of
General Electric to plan and eventually develop and market
the new high-thrust jet engine being developed by General
Electric," the company said in its complaint.</p>
<p>GE said that on March 20, MTU told GE about its plan to
develop with Pratt & Whitney engines that would directly
compete with GE's.</p>
<p>A spokesman for United Technologies declined to comment on
the suit, noting that the company wasn't named in the
litigation. But he said the company's Pratt & Whitney unit
has had "a close partnership with MTU since the early 1970s
on several engines" and that its alliance with MTU was a
"logical outgrowth of that."</p>
<p>As for the issue of GE's proprietary information in the
hands of MTU, he said Pratt & Whitney doesn't "need or want
any GE confidential information."</p>
