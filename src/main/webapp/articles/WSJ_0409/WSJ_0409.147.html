	<p class="article-leader">A. Copeland Enterprises Inc. said it had a net loss of
$35.9 million in 1989 and said it is trying to refinance some
of its debt.
   The owner of Popeyes Famous Fried Chicken and Biscuits,
which last year acquired Church's Fried Chicken Inc. for
about $392 million, said the loss resulted primarily from
about $55.6 million in interest expense related to the
Church's purchase.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Copeland said in New Orleans that last month it received
modifications to certain covenants in its loan agreements, a
reduction in the interest rate on its bridge loan and a
deferral of $7.5 million in bank-debt amortization due in
1990. It said it requested the changes after a deteriorating
junk-bond market prevented it from refinancing some of its
current debt with high-yield subordinated debt, as planned.</p>
