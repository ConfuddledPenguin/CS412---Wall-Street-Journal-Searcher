	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department ruled that Mexican
companies are exporting hydraulic cement to the U.S. at
unfairly low prices.
   The preliminary anti-dumping decision will require
importers of Mexican cement and clinker, an intermediate
material, to post bonds or make cash payments to cover
penalty duties that may be assessed later.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The department's final ruling is due by June 19, after
which the U.S. International Trade Commission would decide
within 45 days whether the imports were injuring a domestic
industry. If both findings are affirmative, penalty duties
would be assessed.</p>
<p>The department said the imports of cement and clinker
totaled about $111 million last year. The dumping margins,
and thus the potential duties, range as high as 56.68% for
cement produced by Cemex S.A.. The margin is 51.73% for
Apasco S.A. de C.V. and 51.16% for most other companies.
However, one Mexican producer, Cementos Hidalgo S.C.L.,
hasn't exported cement or clinker to the U.S. at unfairly low
prices, the agency said.</p>
<p>Under the Anti-Dumping Act, the Commerce Department can
find a violation if imports are reaching the U.S. market at
prices below the producer's home-market price for the same
products.</p>
