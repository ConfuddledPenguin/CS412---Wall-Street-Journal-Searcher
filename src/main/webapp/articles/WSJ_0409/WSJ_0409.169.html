	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The head of the General Accounting Office
said a tax increase is needed to pay for the savings-and-loan
bailout, which the GAO says will cost far more than
originally forecast.
   The investigative arm of Congress said the cost over 30
years should reach $325 billion rather than the $257 billion
it previously estimated. The added costs include additional
S&L insolvencies, a higher estimate of what previous bailout
deals actually cost, additional interest costs, and larger
administrative expenses. Under the current plan, most of the
costs will be borne by the taxpayer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The often-cited 10-year cost, previously estimated by the
Bush administration at $166 billion, is expected by the GAO
to be roughly $243 billion.</p>
<p>The GAO report, released Friday, called for Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady to consider legislation to determine
the source of new funds and also to report current S&L
restructuring costs to Congress semiannually in order to
avoid big surprises in the future.</p>
<p>Yesterday on NBC's "Meet the Press," Charles Bowsher,
comptroller general, said the administration's early
estimates of the plan's costs were artificially suppressed so
that the government could appear to meet its
deficit-reduction targets.</p>
<p>The higher new S&L estimates could make more likely an
overall congressional budget deal to reduce the deficit,
including a tax increase. "You are still going to have to
look at the revenue side of the budget," said Mr. Bowsher,
adding that it would take more than congressional consensus.
"You have to have White House leadership," he said.</p>
<p>It's impossible to know yet the final cost of the
savings-and-loan bailout, which was devised to protect
depositors in S&Ls that made bad investments. The cost --
bigger than all previous U.S. bailouts of private industry or
municipal governments combined -- won't be known until the
bad investments that the S&Ls made have been liquidated.</p>
<p>Economists have been skeptical about the Bush
administration estimates, which projected 7% deposit growth
at a time when thrift deposits are shrinking rapidly, almost
no inflation, and no recession for 10 years. Economic
projections that are less sanguine push cost estimates even
higher.</p>
<p>"If we had a strong economy working against us, interest
rates going up much higher, some people are making estimates
of half a trillion dollars" over 40 years, said Mr. Bowsher
at a Senate hearing Friday.</p>
<p>The GAO, moreover, sounded an ominous warning about the
deposit insurance fund that protects banks, at a time when
banks are reporting higher losses associated with sliding
real-estate markets nationwide. The Federal Deposit Insurance
Fund reported its first loss ever in 1988 and is expected to
report another loss for 1989.</p>
<p>The GAO said it is considering recommendations of
extraordinary auditing requirements, particularly for large
banks. Those would include more frequent on-site examinations
by banking regulators as well as double teams of outside
auditors. The GAO has cited past, superficial audits of S&Ls
as a major factor in allowing thrift insolvencies to grow to
the present size.</p>
<p>"I don't think we can afford to let much time go by before
we deal with these issues," said Donald Chapin, assistant
comptroller general.</p>
<p>The higher estimates occur at a time when the
administration has been scrambling to salvage the S&L
restructuring plan. So far, it has been bogged down, finding
far fewer buyers of insolvent thrifts than anticipated, as
well as more S&L insolvencies with greater losses than
expected.</p>
<p>Resolution Trust Corp. is gearing up to sell or liquidate
140 thrifts by July 1 -- a blistering pace compared with the
52 S&Ls it has sold since last August -- by using more
flexible terms. The sales are likely to leave the government
with the bulk of bad assets for later sale. The government,
however, is likely to receive better bids from buyers for the
thrift deposits if they are sold before their value
diminishes.</p>
<p>After several weeks of inactivity, several thrift sales
are expected to be announced this week, said an RTC
spokesman.</p>
