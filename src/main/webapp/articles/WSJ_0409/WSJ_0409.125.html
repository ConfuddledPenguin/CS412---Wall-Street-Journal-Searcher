	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The takeover business may be in the doldrums,
but the stock market doesn't seem to care.
   Six months ago, the collapse of a proposed deal to take
over UAL Corp. battered the already shaky
merger-and-acquisition business. It also sent the Dow Jones
Industrial Average plunging more than 190 points to 2569.26
on Oct. 13, 1989, effectively eliminating what many analysts
termed "the merger premium" built into stock prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since then the deal business has remained depressed. Data
compiled by Birinyi Associates, a stock-market strategy firm,
show that the value of mergers and acquisitions announced in
the first quarter of 1990 totaled $12.5 billion, down from
$23.3 billion a year ago, and $68.5 billion in the first
quarter of 1988.</p>
<p>Yet in the six months since the UAL debacle, the Dow hit a
new high, slipped again, and now stands at 2717.12; that is
within 93 points of its record high of 2810.15, an overall
decline of less than 3%.</p>
<p>No one is claiming this is a roaring bull market. But the
fact that stock prices are holding their own while takeover
deals have seemingly disappeared does give some analysts a
bit more confidence in the U.S. stock market.</p>
<p>"Deals were one of the two principal sources of capital
for the financial markets in 1988 and 1989," says Hugh
Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "For
us to be able to hold together as well as we have is pretty
impressive."</p>
<p>One reason stock prices haven't collapsed, he points out,
is that while the high-profile leveraged buy-outs and
acquisitions that drew so much attention in 1988 and 1989
have virtually disappeared, corporations still are buying up
stock through stock buy-backs. He cites Federal Reserve data
that show corporations purchased shares at the annual rate of
$143.33 billion for the first three quarters of 1989, and
that those purchases continued at a $93 billion annual rate
in the fourth quarter of 1989, the latest period for which
the Federal Reserve provides data.</p>
<p>"The point is, while corporations are certainly buying a
lot less stock, they're still buying," Mr. Johnson says.
"Corporate stock purchases didn't just disappear."</p>
<p>Beyond that, Mr. Johnson points out that foreign
investors, the other big source of capital in 1988 and 1989,
are still putting their money into U.S. financial markets.
Indeed, he contends that the troubles afflicting the Japanese
stock market since the beginning of this year are giving U.S.
stocks and bonds a boost as international portfolio managers
divert money away from Japan and into the U.S. and West
Germany.</p>
<p>Although there isn't yet solid data to support this
contention, Mr. Johnson cites the dollar's increasing
strength against the Japanese yen as evidence that funds are
flowing this way. And while much of that money is aimed at
the U.S. bond market, it indirectly bolsters the stock market
by producing lower interest rates than would otherwise be the
case.</p>
<p>"If you help the bond market, you help the stock market,"
he says.</p>
<p>New money from individual investors, much of it funneled
into the stock market through mutual funds, also has helped
offset the decline of corporate stock purchases in the past
six months. For the first nine months of 1989, mutual funds
were net sellers of stock at an annual rate of $5.8 billion.
But in the fourth quarter of 1989, just as corporate stock
purchases were slackening, mutual funds were net purchasers
of stock to the tune of $22.4 billion on an annualized basis.</p>
<p>Finally, the first quarter of 1990 brought a modest upturn
in the economy, effectively allaying fears among many
investors that the U.S. was headed for a recession. The
prospect that corporate profits later this year will reflect
the modest rebound in the economy is bolstering stock prices,
especially in the so-called cyclical stocks that move with
the economic cycle.</p>
<p>Yet while Mr. Johnson is encouraged that those various
props are supporting stock prices, he cautions that if one or
more of the props falls away, prices could fall, too.</p>
<p>"If for some reason or another mutual funds don't like the
outlook or the Japanese market stabilizes, we might not get
the kind of nourishment we need from that money flowing into
the market," he says. "That makes it kind of a risky period."</p>
<p>And some analysts argue that the Dow industrials don't
really reflect what has happened to the broader stock market
following the slump in takeover deals. The broader market is
where the loss of the "merger premium" has been felt the
most, they say.</p>
<p>"The Dow may be at 2700, but to conclude that the rest of
the market has come back that far is an illusion," says
Suresh Bhirud, chief portfolio strategist at Oppenheimer.
"You can look at the Dow and say it hasn't been a bad market
since last October, but if you're running a broad portfolio
of stocks, you've been in more or less a bear market." In
particular, he points to the Nasdaq over-the-counter index,
which has lost some 15% since last October.</p>
<p>Mr. Bhirud says the big problem with the merger boom in
1988 and 1989 is that it persuaded many investors to abandon
conservative forms of stock valuation based on earnings in
favor of such methods as "breakup value" and "price to cash
flow ratios."</p>
<p>"If you look at the market prior to Oct. 13, you'll find
at least a couple of dozen stocks that were rumored to be
takeover targets selling at 20 to 30 times earnings," he
says. "Those kinds of values were not really justified except
under some immensely rosy circumstances."</p>
<p>And investors who chased some of the stocks that were
supposedly targets of takeover attempts last year have been
burned this year. Birinyi Associates compiled an index of
speculative stocks, including such names as USX, Hilton, Mead
and Unisys, that were the targets of takeovers that were
never consummated. So far this year, the index is down 11.9%.</p>
<p>"That tells us that investors have to be a little more
disciplined," says Mr. Birinyi. "It isn't going to pay to be
an ambulance chaser."</p>
<p>Joseph A. Feshbach, Prudential-Bache's chief technical
stock-market analyst for six years, has been hired by
Shearson Lehman Hutton. He is related to, but unconnected
with, the Feshbach brothers of Palo Alto, Calif., well-known
shortsellers who aim to profit from stock price declines. His
Prudential-Bache market comment Wednesday said the "next
test" for the industrial average will be 2600. "All the trend
measures are extremely negative," he said, citing a
"breakdown in the Dow Jones Utility Index" and "extremely
high over-the-counter volume" compared with Big Board volume.
But he expects "good support" when the industrial average
hits 2580 to 2600.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Stock prices drifted lower in slow trading as investors
continued to dump regional bank stocks and other issues
considered vulnerable to earnings problems.</p>
<p>The latest bout of selling came after the March employment
report provided an indication of possible weakness in the
economy -- a rise in nonfarm payrolls that was considerably
smaller than expected.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 4.05 to 2717.12,
but managed to record a gain for the week of 9.91 points.
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index dropped 0.65 to 340.08
while the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell 0.37
to 186.78 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index fell 0.78 to
316.62.</p>
<p>Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 137,490,000
shares. Declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of
advancers 860 to 622.</p>
<p>The employment data, released before the opening, showed
that payrolls rose just 26,000 last month -- well below the
consensus forecast of a Dow Jones Capital Markets survey of
economists, which projected an increase of 178,000. The
jobless rate fell 0.1 point, to 5.2%.</p>
<p>Although economists said the report eased concerns that
the Federal Reserve might tighten monetary policy in order to
keep inflation under control, a round of sell programs
resulting from stock-index arbitrage sent prices lower in
early trading. The selloff in regional banks' shares then
regained momentum, keeping pressure on the broad market.</p>
<p>The sector's downturn began Thursday, when analysts turned
negative on the group after meeting with federal banking
regulators who indicated that the companies face extensive
reviews of their loan portfolios.</p>
<p>Banks are expected to begin reporting first-quarter
results this week, and the tough talk on loans has spurred
expectations that the banks' lending problems will translate
into weak earnings.</p>
<p>PNC Financial, which estimated that its nonperforming
assets rose about 43% during the first quarter, plunged 3 7/8
to 34. Because of an increase in its provision for loan
losses, the concern said it expects to report net income for
the quarter fell 35% to 40% from the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Bank of New York fell 1 1/4 to 30 as 1.4 million shares
changed hands. Other regional bank stocks that were hit with
selling included NCNB, which dropped 3/4 to 35 3/8; National
City, which fell 1 1/4 to 33 3/8; Mellon Bank, down 1 1/8 to
24 1/8; Citizens & Southern, down 5/8 to 24 5/8; Sovran
Financial, down 5/8 to 32, and Signet Banking, down 1 1/4 to
23.</p>
<p>Fears of shaky loans also sent Federal National Mortgage
Association, the most active Big Board issue, retreating 2
5/8 to 32 on 3.7 million shares. First Boston cut its
estimate of 1990 earnings slightly, citing its belief that a
widening of the difference between its loan rates and its
borrowing costs has peaked. Meanwhile, Federal Home Loan
Mortgage fell 3 1/2 to 65 1/4.</p>
<p>Shares of big commercial banks closed mixed. Citicorp rose
3/8 to 22 7/8, Chase Manhattan slid 1/4 to 27 5/8,
Manufacturers Hanover added 3/8 to 31 1/8, BankAmerica fell
7/8 to 25 1/2, Chemical Banking slid 1/8 to 22 7/8 and J.P.
Morgan lost 3/8 to 34 5/8.</p>
<p>Aluminum Co. of America dropped 1 3/8 to 62 on 1.4 million
shares, contributing to the decline in the Dow industrials,
as analysts at Prudential-Bache Securities and First Boston
made unfavorable comments on aluminum stocks. Reynolds Metals
dropped 5/8 to 53 1/2 after Prudential-Bache cut its estimate
of the company's first-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>The technology sector, which has already delivered some
disappointing earnings estimates for the first quarter, came
in for some selling as well. International Business Machines
eased 1/4 to 105 7/8, Digital Equipment fell 1 1/4 to 78 1/2,
Compaq Computer declined 7/8 to 96 1/8, Hewlett-Packard
declined 1 1/8 to 43 3/4 and Motorola fell 3/4 to 65 1/8.</p>
<p>UAL dropped 2 to 163 1/2 even though its board agreed in
principle to a buy-out bid, valued at $201 a share, from a
group of unions at its United Airlines subsidiary. The unions
said they are contributing $2 billion of labor concessions to
the offer -- but no cash -- and haven't yet obtained any
outside financing.</p>
<p>Browning-Ferris Industries, which put its hazardous
waste-disposal business up for sale, climbed 1 1/2 to 36 7/8
as 1.8 million shares changed hands. The company said its
results for the March quarter would include a charge of $295
million related to the pullout.</p>
