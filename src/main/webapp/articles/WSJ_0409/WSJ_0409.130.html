	<p class="article-leader">He is a victim of a concerted action by Congress, working
hand-in-glove with the independent counsel's office to try to
do something with this political battle.
   -- Richard Beckler, lawyer for John Poindexter, to the
jury.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>{Do not consider} who was right in political disputes
between Congress and the president, between Democrats and
Republicans or between liberals and conservatives.</p>
<p>-- Judge Greene, instructing the jury.</p>
<p>{There's no question that even being charitable to Admiral
Poindexter, he did it because he wanted to protect the
political viability of Ronald Reagan. And I consider that to
be a selfish motive.}</p>
<p>-- Independent counsel prosecutor Dan Webb after the
verdict.</p>
<p>What has been resolved by the Iran-Contra trials, what has
been established? Congress and the Democratic Party have
achieved a victory of sorts. A jury has declared that John
Poindexter violated congressional law by not being frank
enough in his dealings with Congress. Politics goes on,
though, and it's a little ironic how far away politics has
moved from the original substance of this dispute.</p>
<p>For example, is the Poindexter verdict a repudiation of
President Reagan's Nicaragua policy? Judge Greene's directive
notwithstanding, that of course is a political question. On
the evidence, the policy is a success. Congressional policy
was to stop the Contras from pressuring the Soviet-supported
Sandinista government. Despite the five anti-Contra Boland
amendments, the White House did keep the Contras alive body
and soul, and they made Sandinista consolidation impossible.
When the Nicaraguans got to vote, they removed the
Sandinistas from power.</p>
<p>On the legal side, if the Iran-Contra convictions are
upheld on appeal we will have some very curious precedents.
President Reagan was forced to testify, but Judge Greene
refused to subpoena 65 congressmen. Mr. Poindexter's lawyers
wanted to show that Members were not deceived because they
knew before Mr. Poindexter's testimony about aid to the
Contras and the missile shipment to Iran. In other words, we
may never know what congressmen knew and when they knew it.
Those who say the Poindexter case shows that the President
isn't above the law profess no concern that Congress is far
above the law.</p>
<p>Treating criminal trials as an extension of partisan
politics leaves the President's political status vis a vis
Congress pretty much where it was. Congress will keep trying
to commandeer presidential power by any means so long as the
President fails to guard his office. One likely change is
that on advice of counsel, executive-branch officials will
almost certainly be less frank in their congressional
testimony, lest in difficult matters they become the target
of a congressman's demand for a special prosecutor.</p>
<p>This congressional criminalizing of policy differences
with the executive branch will probably only end when the
Democrats think they have some prospect of regaining the
presidency. They now pay no price for substituting litigation
for politics. They are happy for judges and juries to become
a proxy for the electorate -- except that in the Ollie North
and Poindexter trials the juror-voters had to convince the
court that they knew nothing whatsoever about the political
life of the country. The judiciary might ask itself if it
really wants to play the top role in this brutal political
game.</p>
<p>For the larger electorate, Iran-Contra will be remembered
for the televised hearings which gave ample opportunity for
the public to form its opinion of the matter. For President
Reagan and his treatment by history, Iran-Contra will likely
be a footnote against the fall of communism -- including in
Nicaragua.</p>
<p>President Bush now has the opportunity of the post-Cold
War era to find a modus vivendi with Congress that doesn't
drive politics into courtrooms. He should seriously consider
a pardon for the Iran-Contra defendants, veto any more
special prosecutor laws and tell Congress that foreign policy
will again be set the old-fashioned way, by give and take
between the two political branches of government.</p>
