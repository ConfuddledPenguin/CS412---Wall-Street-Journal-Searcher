	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Looks aren't everything in the
over-the-counter market. Scratch beneath the surface on any
trading day and you'll find that what you see isn't exactly
what happened.
   For instance, the OTC market's overall volume is
frequently overstated. There is "double counting" and even
"triple counting" of stock trades. Less often, closing prices
of thinly traded stocks suggest a big swing up or down when
there really isn't any change in the range of prices that
buyers and sellers are willing to accept.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"As a rule of thumb, we assume the actual trading volume
of a stock is two-thirds of the reported volume," says
Lawrence Auriana, a portfolio manager of the $37-million
Kaufmann Fund, which invests in small growth companies for
individual investors.</p>
<p>The New York and American stock exchanges also sometimes
have discrepancies between actual and reported volume and
prices. But it happens far less often -- a fact exchanges
sometimes exploit as they compete for business with the
growing OTC market.</p>
<p>The OTC market's oddities are old hat to the pros. But
small investors need to be aware of them, too. "It's just the
reality of the marketplace," says portfolio manager Morris
Smith of Fidelity Investments, who in May will leave the helm
of the $720 million Fidelity OTC fund to succeed Peter Lynch
as manager of the $13 billion Magellan Fund.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of some eccentricities of the OTC market:</p>
<p>The middlemen's role: Volume can be misleading because of
the multiple-dealer trading network used in the OTC market.
Buyers and sellers meet and negotiate prices through
brokerage companies' "market makers," who communicate by
telephone and electronically. There are at least several --
occasionally dozens of -- OTC market makers for each stock,
rather than the single floor "specialist" assigned to an
exchange-listed security.</p>
<p>OTC bid and ask prices are posted and trades are executed
through the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotations system, or Nasdaq. Sometimes a broker
will act as a client's agent, telling his company's trading
desk to go into the market to buy or sell an OTC stock. More
often, if a company makes a market in an OTC stock it will
simply buy or sell that stock itself.</p>
<p>By contrast, on an exchange, specialists usually don't
need to buy and hold stock until a purchaser appears. The
exchange floor functions more like an auction house, with
brokers physically present to convey their terms to the
single specialist in a particular stock. The specialist acts
like an umpire to maintain an orderly market, keeping an
order book to match up buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>"Double counting." About 85% to 90% of OTC trading goes
through a dealer, according to Gene L. Finn, chief economist
for the NASD, the self-regulatory body that runs Nasdaq.
Under NASD rules, each seller must report its trade, and this
can lead to "double counting" of volume.</p>
<p>For example, suppose Jill Investor wants to sell 5,000
shares of the fictional Everglow Utilities. Her account
executive at EastCoast Securities sends an order ticket to
the company's OTC trading department, which makes a market in
Everglow. It turns out that the department has a client, Jack
Investor, who wants to buy the shares. So EastCoast buys the
shares and then sells them to Jack. Volume: 10,000 shares
(the 5,000 EastCoast sold to Jack, plus the same 5,000 it
bought from Jill).</p>
<p>"Triple counting." Suppose EastCoast doesn't have any
clients interested in Everglow shares. The company then finds
another dealer, Midwest Market Makers, ready to step up and
buy the stock. Midwest calls up Frank Investor and interests
him in the shares. Frank agrees to buy, and another
5,000-share trade is reported. Total volume: 15,000 shares
(5,000 from Jill to EastCoast, the same 5,000 from EastCoast
to Midwest, the same 5,000 from Midwest to Frank).</p>
<p>Price anomalies. The closing price reported each day is
the last trade -- whether it occurs at the highest "bid" or
the lowest "asking" price. With thinly traded stocks, there
can be a difference -- a "spread" in trading jargon -- of 3/4
point or more between the highest bid and lowest ask being
quoted. OTC stocks with more competition among buyers and
sellers typically have smaller spreads of 1/8 to 1/4.</p>
<p>Let's say the highest bid quoted for Everglow is 18 1/4
and the lowest "ask" 19. If today's final trade occurs at the
highest quoted bid -- say, 18 1/4 from Jack -- the closing
price will be shown as 18 1/4. But suppose that tomorrow the
quoted bid-and-ask range for Everglow remains the same and
the final trade occurs at Midwest's asking price of 19. On
paper, the stock now has closed up 3/4.</p>
<p>Volume is a concern mainly for big institutions, which
must worry about whether a particular investment pool is big
enough for them to swim in. "The individual will be able to
buy and sell 100 shares or 1,000 shares in all but the
smallest companies," says Elliott Schlang, executive vice
president of Prescott, Ball & Turben, Cleveland.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange runs a distant third behind
Nasdaq in terms of reported volume of stocks traded. But Amex
President Kenneth Leibler says the reporting discrepancies
make it difficult to compare the two markets. "Whenever I
look at the OTC market, I automatically halve the volume," he
says, though he calls the OTC system "the most efficient way
to report . . . given the structure of their market."</p>
<p>In wooing new clients, Mr. Leibler argues that the public
auction system provides greater ease in trading securities
than the OTC market's multiple dealers. But Mr. Auriana of
Kaufmann Fund bet differently last year. "We feel very
strongly there's less volatility on Nasdaq, because you have
a fairly large number of firms making markets," he says. Last
year the fund encouraged T2 Medical Inc. to delist its Class
A shares from the Amex and trade on Nasdaq instead. The
company accounts for 12% of Kaufmann's $37 million portfolio.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Declining software stocks helped push down the Nasdaq
Composite Index by 2.52, or 0.58%, to 430.90 on a day when
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index eased only 0.2%.
OTC advancers trailed decliners, 874 to 1,031.</p>
<p>National Market System volume totaled 102,138,400 shares,
about even with Thursday's 102,057,100 shares.</p>
<p>Oracle Systems dropped 1 1/2 to 16 1/8, a 52-week low.
Angry shareholders have sued the company alleging that it
misled them regarding fiscal third-quarter earnings. A late
March disclosure about the quarter previously sank the stock
30% in one day.</p>
<p>Novell tumbled 4 1/8 to 38 3/4 though the company said it
had agreed to be acquired by Lotus Development in a stock
swap. Lotus slid 2 to 34 1/4. Microsoft lost 1/4 to 114 1/4
and Ashton-Tate fell 5/8 to 12 1/2.</p>
<p>Bank stocks nationwide got hammered on continuing concerns
over weakening loan portfolios. The Nasdaq 100 Index, which
tracks the biggest OTC technology stocks among other
non-financial issues, lost 3.10, or 0.72%, to 425.02. But the
Nasdaq Financial 100 Index, including the largest unlisted
bank stocks, tumbled 4.65, or 1.2%, to 379.84.</p>
<p>Sun Microsystems was also on the most active list, down
5/8 to 22 following its call for the redemption or conversion
of its 5 1/4% convertible debentures. Conversion should
result in the issuance of as many as five million new shares.</p>
<p>Hotelecopy gained 1 to 9 1/2. William K. Woodruff & Co.
initiated coverage of the company with a "buy"
recommendation. Hotelecopy, based in Miami, provides
telephone facsimile services in about 1,800 hotels
nationwide. The company also recently began offering
self-service credit card-operated fax service in post office
lobbies throughout the U.S.</p>
