	<p class="article-leader">MANAMA, Bahrain -- Iran signed a 15-year agreement to
supply the Soviet Union with natural gas, the official
Islamic Republic News Service reported.
   The accord calls for Iran to supply three billion cubic
meters of gas annually through its pipeline link to the
Soviet Union. Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said
annual revenue from the gas will amount to about $300
million, the news agency said. Gas deliveries are set to
begin today and may be increased to 10 billion cubic meters
annually at a later date, IRNA said.</p>
