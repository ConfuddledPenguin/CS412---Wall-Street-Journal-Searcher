	<p class="article-leader">For the first time in more than a decade, a television
network has won first-run TV rights from a major movie
studio, bypassing the usual sales to cable TV.
   Industry officials say an as-yet undisclosed pact signed
between CBS Inc. and MCA Inc.'s Universal Pictures unit will
provide the third-place network with all of Universal's
direct 1989 releases, including the box-office hits "Field of
Dreams" and "Born on the Fourth of July."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Details of the agreement weren't available. People in the
industry speculate that CBS will pay about $50 million for
rights to run the films during its 1990-1991 season. Network
officials couldn't be reached. A spokesman for Universal
declined to comment.</p>
<p>Analysts said the pact is a striking departure from recent
industry patterns, in which rights to feature films (after
theater showings) are sold for video distribution, then cable
broadcast, and finally -- at a sharply reduced price -- to
the three major TV networks.</p>
<p>"This is going back to the good old days," said Alan
Kassan, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton.</p>
<p>Although Universal's contract with CBS appears a marriage
of convenience impelled by unusual circumstances on both
sides, the pact may foreshadow changes in relationships
between the major movie studios and cable TV services, some
analysts say. "I fully expect that the networks will be
bidding heavily with pay TV for movie rights in the next few
years," said Steven Rosenberg, head of his own consulting
firm, Rose Media Corp., in Pebble Beach, Calif. He says
networks are relying increasingly on major sporting events
and perhaps blockbuster movies to promote other parts of
their programming lineups.</p>
<p>CBS's purchase of the film rights raises questions about
the strength of its programming lineup. "The network, with
its weak prime-time ratings, needs to look for a new
strategy, particularly for the sweeps," said Mr. Kassan. The
sweeps are the four-times-a-year rating periods that test the
relative popularity of television programming.</p>
<p>For MCA and Universal, the agreement fulfills a
longstanding drive to circumvent Time Warner Inc.'s Home Box
Office and Viacom Inc.'s Showtime/The Movie Channel, whose
dominance of pay television gives the two cable empires
paramount positions in bidding for movie rights.</p>
<p>That dominance not long ago led MCA's mercurial president,
Sidney J. Sheinberg, to threaten that the company not only
would try to sell movies directly to the major networks, but
might even seek informal networks of local stations to
exhibit Universal films.</p>
<p>Antipathies between MCA and the cable barons apparently
remain high. MCA and Universal's talks with Home Box Office
to renew a recently expired five-year movie-rights pact were
particularly difficult, people in the industry say. Analysts
believe the pay-TV company paid far too much for rights in
the earlier pact for what proved a weak movie lineup and thus
was determined to keep the price down on any new arrangement.
Home Box Office officials couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>At the same time, the popularity of Universal's film
offerings improved markedly last year, convincing the studio
that it should be paid more for any new contract.</p>
<p>The 10 1989 movies CBS will pick up first-run rights to
include producer-director Spike Lee's critical success "Do
the Right Thing;" "Sea of Love," with Al Pacino; "Uncle
Buck," starring John Candy; "K-9," starring Jim Belushi; as
well as "Field of Dreams" and "Born on the Fourth of July."
Also included in the package are less popular features:
"Fletch Lives," "Renegades," "Shocker," and "The Wizard," a
dud about a youthful video-game whiz.</p>
<p>The agreement apparently excludes movies by Imagine Films
Entertainment Inc., which under a separate arrangement have
been sold to Showtime, with subsequent broadcasts arranged
with CBS. Imagine, a separate company, has close ties to
Universal in its feature film production and distribution.
Imagine's 1989 movies include "The Burbs," "The Dream Team,"
and "Parenthood," one of the year's better-grossing films.</p>
<p>Also excluded are movies of Steven Spielberg's Amblin
Entertainment Co., including "Dad," "Back to the Future, Part
2" and "Always."</p>
<p>It's not clear whether MCA will win or lose revenue in the
short term with its prospective end run around pay
television. Mr. Kassan estimated that the company took in
about $120 million in revenue last year from pay cable
licensing. Of that total, about $85 million came from Home
Box Office and the remainder from Showtime, he said.</p>
<p>If industry speculation is correct that revenue from the
CBS pact will be around $50 million, then the television
broadcast rights may fall short of last year, although
revenue from Imagine Films and Amblin Entertainment may fill
in much of the gap.</p>
<p>An equally important question remains for CBS: Will it get
an audience response that justifies its outlays -- whatever
they may be?</p>
<p>Before home video rentals and pay TV entered the equation,
networks could count on big ratings for blockbuster movies.
But analysts question whether a prospective audience, gorged
on $2 home video rentals, will sit through a critically
esteemed movie interrupted by commercials. In some cases,
research suggests audiences accept only certain "franchise"
films, such as Sylvester Stallone's beefcake melodramas or
James Bond movies, with commercial breaks.</p>
