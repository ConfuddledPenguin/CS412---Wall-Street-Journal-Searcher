	<p class="article-leader">TUCSON, Ariz. -- Tucson Electric Power Co.'s auditors
cited a host of contingent liabilities and uncertainties.
   In a letter to shareholders, the auditors, Deloitte &
Touche, noted that the company faces various regulatory and
legal decisions as well as contractual matters.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1989, Tucson Electric had a loss of $89.9 million, or
$3.55 a share, on $593.7 million in revenue.</p>
<p>Tucson Electric said it decided not to take charges that
last year would have resulted in a $74 million widening of
the loss. The utility said that it may decide to record a
liability for the potential charge, which involves a gain
posted years ago, a portion of which regulators now are
saying belongs to rate-payers. Tucson Electric is challenging
that ruling by the Arizona Corporation Commission.</p>
<p>Also troubling the company is the $722 million investment
in the Springerville 2 coal-fired generating station. The
unit is nearing completion. However, Arizona regulators have
questioned the need for the capacity, which could result in
Tucson Electric's being barred from recovering some or all of
the unit's costs from rate-payers.</p>
<p>Tucson Electric warned that "either substantial retail
rate increases or additional wholesale sales {or a
combination thereof} will be required to recover such costs"
of Springerville 2. Without recovery, "the company will
suffer increasingly deteriorating financial results, will be
unable to earn a reasonable return on its utility investment,
and will continue to have negative cash flow."</p>
<p>Tucson Electric eliminated dividend payments on its common
stock earlier this year. The company has said it expects to
post losses and sees no chance of restoring the dividend in
the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Based on certain coverage tests, the company is barred
from issuing additional preferred stock. A net earnings test
also limits to about $70 million the amount of additional
first mortgage bonds that can be sold by the company, which
added that the amount of bonds it can issue under the
earnings test is expected to dwindle through this year, as
anticipated operating losses are reported.</p>
<p>However, Tucson Electric said it can issue as much as $118
million of bonds by current calculation without meeting the
net earnings test, based on bonds retired after the most
recent filing of a net earnings certificate with the bond
indenture trustee.</p>
<p>The company currently is trying to negotiate a new master
credit agreement that would provide as much as $350 million
of borrowing capability and would supplant all existing
short-term credit facilities.</p>
<p>Current company short-term financial facilities include a
$150 million revolving bank credit agreement that expires in
May 1991, and $100 million in various bank lines expiring
from March 30 to July 31 of this year. Tucson Electric said
it is seeking a renewal of these lines until a master credit
agreement can be negotiated. Four banks holding $40 million
of debt refused to extend and were paid in December and
January.</p>
