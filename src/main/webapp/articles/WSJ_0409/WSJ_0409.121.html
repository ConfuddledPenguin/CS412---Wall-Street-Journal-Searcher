	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc., citing USAir
Group Inc.'s planned expansion effort and "reduced cash
flow," lowered its ratings on the carrier's long-term debt of
approximately $875 million.
   Moody's said it expects the company's "debt-protection
measurements will remain depressed over the intermediate term
in the wake of the difficulties in integrating Piedmont into
USAir." USAir acquired Piedmont Aviation Inc. in 1987.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A "cyclically weaker operating outlook for the industry,"
Moody's said, will limit USAir's ability to return to its
"historical earnings levels." The airline's ability to reduce
its currently high leverage may be limited by USAir's plans
to spend more than $1 billion annually during the next two
years to modernize and expand operations, Moody's said.</p>
<p>A USAir spokeswoman said the report "speaks for itself as
a fair reflection of the company's current situation."</p>
<p>The rating concern lowered the parent company's commercial
paper to Prime-3 from Prime 2. Ratings on equipment-trust
certificates and pass-through certificates issued by the
airline's USAir Inc. unit were downgraded to Baa1 from A3;
USAir Inc.'s senior debentures and industrial-revenue bonds
were lowered to Baa2 from Baa1.</p>
<p>Also lowered were the ratings on equipment-trust
certificates issued by the company's Piedmont Aviation unit,
to Baa1 from A3; Piedmont industrial-revenue bonds were
reduced to Baa2 from Baa1.</p>
