	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Bechtel Group Inc. said it signed an
agreement to conduct a preliminary study aimed at turning a
Soviet Union research community into an area similar to
California's Silicon Valley.
   Bechtel said the study is part of a plan to convert
Troitsk, located about 20 miles from Moscow, into a
"entrepreneurial, high-technology city." Troitsk is now the
site of the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy, where much
of the country's scientific research is conducted.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bechtel said there are plans to upgrade the area's
airport, and install advanced telecommunications facilities
at Troitsk. Also, Bechtel said it's hoped that a conference
center, an international hotel, "U.S.-style housing" and
recreational facilities will be developed. Terms of the
agreement weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>The closely held engineering and construction concern said
it's too early to estimate the cost of the project, but said
the Soviets have indicated they plan to spend $100 million a
year to build a series of such high-tech communities. With
the plan, Bechtel said, the Soviets "hope to convert their
purely research facilities at Troitsk into a series of
entrepreneurial ventures capable of jump-starting their
nation's faltering economy."</p>
