	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- To his policeman's hat and bureaucrat's
green eye shade, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh has added
the diplomat's black bowler.
   In the coming issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, Mr.
Thornburgh holds forth on "The Soviet Union and the Rule of
Law." The article is replete with allusions to his personal
mission last year to Moscow, where he preached to Soviet
leaders about the values of the U.S. legal system. In
frequent speeches, the attorney general contends that
Washington has an obligation to export our legal principles
to fertilize democracy movements in the East.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Anything that we can do to expostulate upon our own
experience, and to share with . . . the framers . . . of
these nascent constitutions, I think will be in our long-term
interest," he told a meeting of the Federalist Society, a
conservative legal group based here.</p>
<p>Beyond proselytizing, Mr. Thornburgh has dedicated himself
to a number of foreign-policy projects that are unusual in
scope and variety for an attorney general to undertake. He
has helped orchestrate Senate approval of treaties to
facilitate cooperative law enforcement efforts with other
countries. He has visited numerous foreign counterparts to
apply personal pressure in attempts to ease foreign-bank
secrecy and extradition rules. And at home, he is supervising
a rethinking of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's foreign
counterintelligence strategies in light of the opening of
relations with previously hostile East European nations.</p>
<p>Mr. Thornburgh's efforts add up to "building the
infrastructure for international law enforcement," says his
top aide, Robert Ross. Translated from the bureaucratese,
that means scrambling to keep up with high-tech criminals who
are no longer limited by national borders and who can
transfer ill-gotten gains from one bank account to another
just by punching a computer key.</p>
<p>Some observers are impressed by the attorney
general-turned-diplomat. "I'd give him a good grade," says
Barry Carter, an international law professor at Georgetown
University and a Democrat. "He clearly surpasses {Reagan
administration Attorney General Edwin} Meese, who took a lot
of junkets but really didn't distinguish himself in this
area."</p>
<p>Mr. Carter has one main concern: the Thornburgh Justice
Department's determination that the FBI can snatch U.S.
fugitives in foreign countries without getting the host
government's permission. "If we were to act unilaterally in
that fashion, we could undermine a lot of cooperation," says
the professor.</p>
<p>Others are suspicious of Mr. Thornburgh's motives, noting
his much-discussed ambition for higher office. Referring to
the attorney general's busy schedule of international travel,
Jack Blum, an international lawyer and former special counsel
to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says, "It makes
him look like a vice presidential candidate."</p>
<p>Mr. Blum's former boss, Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.),
praises the Bush administration's anti-drug diplomacy, but he
argues that some Justice Department projects abroad are
ill-advised. He points to Operation Snowcap, in which armed
U.S. agents are leading paramilitary helicopter squads to
destroy cocaine facilities in the Peruvian and Bolivian
jungles.</p>
<p>"This has the makings of another Vietnam," says the
lawmaker. "You leave a lot of people hanging out there and
taking a lot of risks without the resources or the strategy
to win."</p>
<p>There is, however, widespread agreement that some
countries are cooperating more with U.S. law enforcement, at
least in part because of Mr. Thornburgh's international
offensive. His pressure helped prompt Swiss authorities to
honor their earlier treaty agreements and open previously
secret bank accounts where international drug dealers stash
their profits.</p>
<p>The attorney general also played a role in convincing the
Colombian government to begin extraditing people facing U.S.
drug charges. After years of inaction from Bogota, 15 members
of Colombian cocaine trafficking organizations have been
extradited since last summer.</p>
<p>Critics point out that these defendants aren't Colombia's
top drug lords and therefore are easily replaced by the
cartel heads. But Mark Richard, a senior career official in
the Justice Department's criminal division, contends that
"even the level of success we've had breaks the pattern of
rhetoric with little action."</p>
