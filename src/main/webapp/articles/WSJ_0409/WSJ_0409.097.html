	<p class="article-leader">Can the magic continue without the magician? That's the
question that faces any organization that loses a superstar.
   The loss of an extraordinary leader can mean wrenching
changes in a company's culture. Anguish and uncertainty often
ensue. For those who succeed superstars, there is opportunity
-- but also the pressure of high expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consider the daunting tasks facing Morris Smith and
Malcolm S. Forbes Jr. Mr. Smith was named last month to
succeed Peter Lynch, who's retiring after winning renown --
and a reputation as one of the nation's top stock-pickers --
while running Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund. Now the
nation's largest stock mutual fund, it exploded to $13
billion in assets from $20 million under Mr. Lynch's 13-year
guidance.</p>
<p>And Mr. Forbes took the reins at Forbes Inc. last month
after the death of his flamboyant father. Malcolm S. Forbes
Sr., a masterful self-promoter, had gained enormous
recognition for his magazine -- and attracted advertisers and
subscribers -- by exploiting the publicity value of his
wealth and personality.</p>
<p>Fidelity and Forbes won't fade away because their
charismatic chiefs are gone, but both companies have a
problem. Beyond coping with emotional strain, they must
regain their footing with employees, clients, advertisers and
investors, among others. "You worry, when one person has been
so responsible for business practices, that when they leave
they create an enormous void," says William A. Sahlman, a
Harvard Business School professor.</p>
<p>The stakes are often highest in small companies,
especially start-ups or family businesses where there isn't a
clear successor or a strong enough management team. But major
companies can be vulnerable too. How critical is Lee A.
Iacocca to Chrysler Corp.? Could Trump Organization survive
without developer Donald? What about Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
without investment genius Warren E. Buffett?</p>
<p>When a company and its star are synonymous, the star's
fall can throw the business into crisis. Since the 1986 death
of designer Perry Ellis, the fashion house that bears his
name has lost many important employees, gone through several
management changes and struggled to maintain its prestige --
and sales -- in light of criticism that the quality and
appeal of its clothing lines have dropped. Michael Milken,
one of the business world's most acclaimed stars for much of
the '80s, almost single-handedly created the market for junk
bonds and fueled Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s success in the
decade. But federal charges of racketeering and securities
fraud pulled the plug on Mr. Milken -- part of a swirl of
events that led to the junk-bond market's woes and Drexel's
recent collapse.</p>
<p>Companies needn't always plummet when a star exits. It
often depends on timing. Apple Computer Inc. forced out
founder Steven Jobs when his entrepreneurial vision and style
were judged incompatible with its needs as a mature
organization. The company remains a major player in its
industry. But if Mr. Jobs were to leave his nascent Next Inc.
now, that company might have a short future, says Harvard's
Mr. Sahlman, because Mr. Jobs is clearly its greatest asset.</p>
<p>Big companies normally insist that potential successors
are in place to carry on. Such planning is critical for any
company to avoid serious damage from the abrupt loss of a
superstar, visionary or veteran leader, management
specialists say. They must also move quickly to put
contingency plans in place and make them public, lest
speculation grow that the ship will sink because its rudder
is gone.</p>
<p>Malcolm Jr. had been president and deputy editor in chief
of Forbes, and his ascension was no surprise. Still, he led a
news conference at Forbes headquarters on a Sunday, the day
after his father's death, to get out word of a smooth
transition.</p>
<p>When Mr. Lynch went public with his plans to leave,
Fidelity announced the same day that it had selected Mr.
Smith to succeed him and began publicizing his solid record
running another Fidelity stock fund. The company braced for a
flood of investors to redeem their Magellan shares, but it
turned out to be "a fairly meaningless number," says George
A. Vanderheiden, a Fidelity vice president who will oversee
Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>Management specialists say Mr. Smith will be under heavy
scrutiny for months, and probably longer, as investors assess
whether he's worthy of handling their money. If he
underperforms the market, "the media, the public will begin
to say life without Peter Lynch just won't work," says Jay A.
Conger, professor of organizational behavior at McGill
University.</p>
<p>Companies shouldn't expect miracles from a superstar's
successor, Mr. Conger says. Truly exceptional business
personalities are rare, he says, and they seldom cultivate
others to have the same vision or inspirational skills. For
one, they may not want the competition. They also can be so
imposing that they drive away or stifle those who otherwise
might shine.</p>
<p>This is often the case in family operations, where
children may never feel free to be their own person. "Very
few children have outperformed their fathers," Mr. Conger
says. The late Mr. Forbes, who inherited the empire his
father started, and Mr. Trump, whose father got him going in
real estate, are notable exceptions.</p>
<p>More typical is Frederick Wang, who never managed to carry
Wang Laboratories Inc. in the style of his father, founder An
Wang. The elder Mr. Wang, who died last month, forced his son
to resign as president and chief executive officer last year
after a string of losses and other problems.</p>
<p>When companies lose an important figure, specialists
suggest, they should quickly remind employees and others that
the organization lives on, that "no one individual can create
success or failure for the whole," says Mary Anne Devanna, a
Columbia University management professor.</p>
<p>After years of plugging Mr. Lynch and his record, Fidelity
is careful now to stress that Magellan represents just 11% of
its assets and that investors needn't worry. "This is a
well-oiled machine," Mr. Vanderheiden says.</p>
<p>At Forbes, Editor James W. Michaels says there is "a
determination to show that there is a lot more to this
organization and this magazine than simply one person."</p>
<p>At the same time, management specialists say companies
would be wise to preserve some of the values of extraordinary
figures, in part to help perpetuate their charisma. "This is
where an artful leader will jump in and gain a sympathetic
edge" before advancing a new agenda, says John L. Ward,
professor of private enterprise at Loyola University of
Chicago.</p>
<p>But guiding philosophies must be selected with care.
"Think" remains part of the culture at International Business
Machines Corp., a legacy of founder Thomas Watson Sr. He also
dictated that IBM salesmen wear blue suits and white
button-down shirts. Neither preaching has harmed the company,
but "if he had said `mainframes,' that would have killed
them," Mr. Conger contends.</p>
