	<p class="article-leader">Commercial Intertech Corp. said it repurchased 573,100
shares of its common stock at $28.625 a share from Bear
Stearns & Co., New York.
   The Youngstown, Ohio, producer of hydraulic equipment and
fluid purification products said previously that an unknown
investor was accumulating the company's shares. It now
appears that the investor was Bear Stearns, Commercial
Intertech said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At Bear Stearns, there was no one available who could say
whether the stock had been accumulated by Bear Stearns or if
Bear Stearns sold the stock for another investor.</p>
<p>The repurchase was made under a board authorization last
Feb. 15 to repurchase up to 2.5 million shares. The company
said it has repurchased a total of 1,463,210 shares under
that authorization.</p>
<p>The company had 12.4 million common shares outstanding
before beginning the repurchases. However, including
convertible preferred stock, the total number of shares
outstanding on a fully diluted basis remains above 13
million, a spokesman said.</p>
