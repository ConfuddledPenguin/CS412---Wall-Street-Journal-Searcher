	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Coastal Corp. said it will build an oil storage
and trans-shipment facility in San Nicolas, Aruba, where it
is restarting a former Exxon Corp. refinery.
   Coastal, a diversified energy company, said the facility
would include construction of storage tanks that could hold
as much as eight million barrels of crude. That would be in
addition to 3.4 million barrels of storage capacity already
built or under construction at the refinery.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company also said it plans to build a dock capable of
handling ocean tankers that can carry as much as 3.5 million
barrels of crude.</p>
<p>"The facility gives flexibility in buying crude in large
volumes and shipping it out as needed," a Coastal spokesman
said. The Aruba refinery, scheduled to begin processing
150,000 barrels a day of crude by this summer, will initially
make diesel fuel and heating oils. It will also make
low-sulfur feedstocks that can be shipped to U.S. refineries
for the production of gasoline.</p>
<p>The Coastal spokesman said the company didn't yet know
what construction costs would be until bids were received.
One industry official estimated the price would exceed $40
million.</p>
