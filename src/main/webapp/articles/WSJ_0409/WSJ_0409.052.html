	<p class="article-leader">Cambior Inc. is "very actively" seeking acquisitions,
Louis Gignac, president and chief executive officer, said
after a presentation to analysts in Montreal.
   Mr. Gignac said the Val D'Or, Quebec, gold mining concern
would prefer to make one major acquisition rather than a
number of smaller purchases and is particularly interested in
buying a U.S. gold property. He said that with more than 100
million Canadian dollars (US$86 million) in cash Cambior can
consider an acquisition of around C$200 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Gignac said Cambior's objective is to roughly double
its gold production to about 500,000 ounces annually by the
end of 1994 from a forecast 220,000 ounces this year.</p>
