	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. said it is changing
the trading symbol for its Granite City Steel convertible
subordinated debentures to NII94, from GRC94.
   The change is being made with the New York Stock Exchange,
effective April 9, the company said, to avoid confusion with
another firm's trading symbol on the American Stock Exchange.</p>
