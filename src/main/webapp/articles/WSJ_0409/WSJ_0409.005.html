	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Will your Easter bonnet have a discount on it?
   Early reports on March retail sales indicate that
important spring-apparel lines are selling with minimal
markdowns-so far. That's a far cry from the massive
discounting that afflicted inventory-laden retailers at
Christmas and from last year's soft Easter results.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It looks like, at least through March, most retailers
were able to push new merchandise out with normal prices,"
said Brian J. Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu
Economics, New York. Still, he and others concede that the
book on spring merchandise won't be closed until April
results are known, as Easter arrives late this year.</p>
<p>March retail sales, due out Thursday, are expected to show
a small gain, buoyed by strength in apparel, a high-profit
line for stores, particularly if they maintain full price
markups. A sharp, 3.3% jump in February clothing prices
pushed up the consumer price index that month in a move at
least partly attributable to firmer pricing. Automobile sales
lately have been stirred only by incentives and other
big-ticket goods, such as furniture, have been lifeless. The
week's other indicators include March producer prices and
February business inventories.</p>
<p>Discounting on Easter goods is still possible. "If they
have a really lousy weekend, retailers may choose to have a
one-day or two-day sale," said Stacy Dutton, retail analyst
at Morgan Stanley & Co., New York. She noted Friday that
cold, rainy weather was in the offing for much of the Midwest
and East. "But I don't sense there's a huge panic out there,"
she added.</p>
<p>Others aren't so sure. "This is a very competitive retail
market with pressures on margins and bargain-conscious
consumers in the stores," said Allen Sinai, chief economist
of Boston Co. "Americans are great mall-walkers, not
necessarily shoppers," he added.</p>
<p>"Inventories may be lean, but with costs rising on the
wage side, that means profit pressure," Mr. Sinai added,
alluding to Friday's March employment data, which showed
another increase in average hourly earnings.</p>
<p>Overall March retail sales are expected to rise 0.2%,
according to MMS International Inc., a unit of McGraw-Hill
Inc., New York. Excluding the weak auto component, retail
sales show a larger, 0.4% rise, the survey indicates.</p>
<p>Discounting may be on the way out as a viable marketing
strategy anyway, said Daniel D. Barry, retail analyst at
Kidder, Peabody & Co. "There is a secular trend toward less
promotion and less discounting and more every-day low
pricing," he said. Sears, Roebuck & Co. recently made a major
thrust in that direction and Mr. Barry noted that others,
including Dayton-Hudson Corp., are trying the policy. He said
new technology, such as computer-aided inventory control, is
making cost-management easier to achieve at the front of the
selling process, helping retailers avoid disaster sales at
the rack.</p>
<p>Retailers save by stabilizing their cost-of-carrying goods
and eliminating the often-panicky closeout expenses of a
sale. And the consumer "has the feeling coming into the store
where you can save money on a regular basis rather than
coming in just to buy on sale. There's more good will," said
Mr. Barry.</p>
<p>Friday's report on February business inventories is
expected to register a flat reading, according to MMS,
corroborating the view that retailer stocks are trim.</p>
<p>As for consumer pocketbooks, economists said not to expect
much of a clue from Friday's release of March producer
prices. The producer price index is expected to rise 0.1%,
the MMS survey said. Excluding volatile food and energy
components, it's expected to jump 0.3%.</p>
<p>Economists said the consumer price index, which isn't
reported until next week, could benefit in a backlash from
February's sharp jump in apparel prices as well as from lower
energy prices that weren't fully passed through the previous
month. The early consensus view from MMS pegs the CPI with a
rise of 0.2%. But Midland Montagu's Mr. Fabbri notes that if
the mitigating apparel and energy factors are present,
"there's a real good chance the CPI could be a negative
number."</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch says in the firm's weekly commentary that
economic activity in the first half now "appears to be
stronger than we originally projected." The firm now expects
first-half real gross national product to grow by about 2.5%.
Treasury bond yields could rise by more than one-quarter of
one percentage point to 9% by the end of the quarter, the
report says. Still, Merrill notes that much of the first-half
growth was due to quirks of nature, statistics and auto
makers. It adds, "The underlying state of the economy remains
soft" and real GNP may rise by only 1.5% by the fourth
quarter.</p>
