	<p class="article-leader">Your March 2 story on the nation's air-capacity problem
("FAA Predicts Big Jump in Air Traffic . . .") made an
oblique reference to the airlines blaming part of the problem
on the government's refusal "to get tough with noise
restrictions at individual airports."
   Individual airports have had to implement noise
restrictions because neither the airlines nor the government
has been sensitive to the environmental consequences of
stuffing more routes into the nation's already-saturated
skies. As a result of the airline industry's awesome
political clout and overflowing political-action coffers, it
has been allowed to spread noise and air pollution with
virtually no legislative constraints. Its incestuous
relationship with the FAA is legend, even to the extent that
the last FAA head came from Federal Express.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And the government's typical lack of long-range planning
and political courage is as much to blame. Why, for example,
has the government not invested in a bullet-train system, as
in Japan and Europe? Why isn't the government considering
tougher restrictions on noisier, older, less-safe Stage 2
aircraft, as is being done by the European Economic
Community?</p>
<p>It is estimated that nine million Americans suffer
intolerable levels of jet noise, and the number is increasing
dramatically each day. In New Jersey alone, where 50% more
routes were added three years ago, more than 4,000 square
miles of land and three million people are being bombarded by
the constant roar of jet aircraft, night after night, day
after day.</p>
<p>As a business executive who has learned that concern for
the environment is good business, I hope the airline industry
wakes up before it's too late. Deregulation has given the
industry opportunities for growth. With that opportunity
comes social responsibility.</p>
