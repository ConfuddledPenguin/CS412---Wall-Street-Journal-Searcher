	<p class="article-leader">Computer Horizons Corp. officials estimated that
first-quarter net income fell 57% from the year before, but
excluding a year-earlier gain from an accounting change,
earnings advanced 50%.
   The computer-systems integrator cited new contracts and
the benefits of a fourth-quarter 1989 restructuring for the
improved operating results. The company expects
second-quarter results to exceed the first quarter's and it
projects, without being specific, a "very strong" year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Computer Horizons also rejected a major shareholder's
request for board representation and for a standstill
agreement.</p>
<p>Computer Horizons, based in Mountain Lakes, N.J., expects
to report net of "better than 25 cents a share," or $600,000,
compared with $1.4 million, or 59 cents a share, John J.
Cassese, president and chief executive officer, said in an
interview. But year-earlier earnings before the accounting
change, which was related to deferred taxes, were $401,000,
or 16 cents a share.</p>
<p>Revenue exceeded $23 million, up at least 17% from $19.7
million, Mr. Cassese estimated.</p>
<p>In 1989's fourth quarter, Computer Horizons charged $3.3
million to restructure and $600,000 to cover bad debts and
for other reserves. The revamping "opened us up in 1990 with
reduced costs," said Bernhard Hubert, senior vice president
and chief financial officer.</p>
<p>"We closed or downsized seven offices," cutting selling,
general and administrative staff 15%, Mr. Hubert said.
Computer Horizons wrote off a few small balance-sheet items
and "downsized some compensation plans," Mr. Hubert said.</p>
<p>Full-year 1989 "is blurred by the restructuring charge.
But for that {charge}, we'd have made 40 cents" a share, Mr.
Hubert said. For 1989, Computer Horizons posted a loss of
$291,000, or 55 cents a share.</p>
<p>The business of integrating computer systems has plenty of
players, big and small. One of the company's strategies is to
work in partnership with the majors, Mr. Cassese said, noting
that the company is working with International Business
Machines Corp. to put together a system for an IBM client.</p>
<p>And contracts Computer Horizons itself has signed recently
include systems work for Exxon Corp. and the A.C. Nielsen
unit of Dun & Bradstreet Corp. The company also continues to
do significant work with General Electric Co., Mr. Cassese
said.</p>
<p>Recently, Compagnie Generale d'Informatique, a Paris
company with systems-integration interests, boosted its stake
in Computer Horizons to 16.8%, bumping up against the level
at which Computer Horizons' poison-pill anti-takeover rights
would kick in. Such rights are designed to make a hostile
takeover prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p>In a March 22 letter to Mr. Cassese, CGI President Bernard
Chapot said CGI regrets Computer Horizons managers'
"persistent refusal . . . to discuss areas of common
interest. . . ." Mr. Chapot calls the poison pill
"unwarranted."</p>
<p>CGI then proposed a six-month standstill accord. CGI said
it wouldn't make a tender offer or wage a proxy fight for
Computer Horizons. In return, Computer Horizons would add one
CGI representative to the board and name an additional
director independent of both companies.</p>
<p>But in a letter dated April 5, Mr. Cassese told Mr.
Chapot, "If, as you have been holding out, you have any
suggestions that will benefit" Computer Horizons and its
shareholders -- "not just CGI -- we want to hear them. We
keep meeting with you to hear them, but we've heard nothing
yet."</p>
