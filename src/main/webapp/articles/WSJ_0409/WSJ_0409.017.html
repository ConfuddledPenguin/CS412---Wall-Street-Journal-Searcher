	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Westinghouse Electric Corp. said it received
an expanded contract to build a $170.2 million
waste-to-energy plant at Auburn Hills, Mich.
   A year ago, Westinghouse received a $123.3 million
contract from Oakland County to build and operate the plant.
However, the new contract calls for a plant that will burn
2,000 tons of municipal solid waste each day, up from the
1,500-ton capacity originally envisioned.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The county is negotiating with Detroit Edison Co. on an
agreement under which the utility would buy the 62,000
kilowatts of electric power the plant would generate,
Westinghouse said.</p>
