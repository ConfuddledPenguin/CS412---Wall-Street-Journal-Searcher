   From Remote Hospitals</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>SMALL HOSPITALS soon may be able to bring distant
cardiologists to patients' bedsides instantly -- with a
computer and a phone.</p>
<p>Such facilities often don't have a cardiologist who can
examine patients' hearts on video screens attached to
ultrasound machines, interpreting the subtle signs that can
tell whether chest pains call for emergency bypass surgery or
for Alka-Seltzer. Doctors at small hospitals must mail the
videotapes to big-city heart specialists for detailed
diagnoses, a process that can take days.</p>
<p>Claritek Corp., a San Diego start-up, has developed a
computer system called HeartLink that sends live images of a
beating heart over a phone line to a specialist's computer
screen, circumventing the problem that ordinary video signals
are too big to fit into phone lines. Claritek's system uses
copyrighted mathematical algorithms in an encoder device that
takes a heart's image from the ultrasound machine and
translates critical heart movements -- such as a valve's
opening and closing -- into digital codes that fit into phone
lines.</p>
<p>A decoder in the heart specialist's personal computer at
the other end of the phone translates the code into a color
image of a heart. The computer-generated heart precisely
mimics the patient's heart, allowing the cardiologist to
diagnose problems and give prescriptions as if the patient
were in the same room.</p>
<p>Claritek, whose developers include a TRW Inc.
mathematician and a Hollywood cartoon animator, has installed
a pilot HeartLink system at the University of California, San
Diego, where cardiologists say early results are promising.
It plans to place other machines, which it expects to sell
eventually for $350,000 to $700,000, in California, Kentucky,
Pennsylvania and Massachusetts university hospitals.</p>
<p>Video Standards Grow</p>
<p>Passe Before They Exist</p>
<p>MULTIMEDIA proponents, who want to conduct video
conferences over phone lines and send movies into PCs, are
waiting for standards-setting groups to agree on common ways
to compress those video images so they fit on such equipment.</p>
<p>But standards are having trouble keeping up with
technology. The world telecommunications body, CCITT, for
example, is expected to adopt this year a standard formula to
compress video images into phone lines for teleconferences
and TV phones. But, says an executive at video-conference
equipment vendor PictureTel Corp., the standard already "is a
few generations behind the latest technology."</p>
<p>The CCITT standard needs the equivalent of about four
phone lines to transmit images that don't blur if a conferee
moves his head or gestures, PictureTel says. The company
sells equipment using new compression algorithms that give
equal quality over two phone lines -- and soon will work on
one phone line. Because the CCITT standard is already
obsolete, the company says, it was forced to turn to its own
proprietary algorithms, which aren't able to talk to other
vendors' equipment cheaply.</p>
<p>Similarly, the International Standards Organization is
mulling standards for PCs to process moving pictures, but the
standards aren't expected out until 1991 or later. Intel
Corp. couldn't wait, and last year introduced a set of chips
using a proprietary way to compress video images. Intel's
chips can be programmed later to conform to standards.</p>
<p>Speeding Flow of Data</p>
<p>With Indium Phosphide</p>
<p>THERE'S ALWAYS a greed for speed among companies that
transmit information, whether it's over wires, airwaves or
satellites. Cable-TV concerns, for instance, will need faster
transmission speeds to send high-definition television
channels on fiber-optic cables.</p>
<p>The solution could come from a chip material called indium
phosphide, which is far faster than older materials and
creates half the electronic "noise." The latest development
comes from Varian Associates Inc., which built an
indium-phosphide chip with seven transistors that turns on
and off 100 billion times a second. At that rate, the chip
will transmit and receive more than 50 times as much
information through optical fibers as today's silicon chips,
which typically oscillate at fewer than two billion cycles a
second.</p>
<p>The Varian chip uses high-electron-mobility-transistor
technology (HEMT), which speeds up electrons by clearing
impurities out of their paths. Varian says the chips can be
made with standard chip-making equipment and could be on the
market in two years.</p>
<p>General Electric Co. expects indium-phosphide HEMTs to be
used in direct-broadcast satellite systems that beam TV
signals down to plate-sized home satellite dishes. General
Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft Co. unit, which built an
indium-phosphide transistor that oscillates 250 billion times
a second, expects auto companies to use the devices in
collision-avoidance radar. TRW is developing such chips for
"smart" weapons, such as missiles that use millimeter-wave
radar to look through fog and recognize a target's shape.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>THE KEY to cheap chips is in squeezing more circuits onto
them. The average microprocessor chip unveiled at a recent
international chip conference contained 580,000 transistors,
up from 150,000 at 1987's conference. . . . Don't toss that
slow, aging fax machine: Electronic Modules Inc. has a new
$499 device that lets an old fax machine scan documents, but
takes over the task of transmitting the image, sending a fax
at speeds rivaling today's fastest machines.</p>
