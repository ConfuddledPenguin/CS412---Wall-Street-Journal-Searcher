	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush nominated Wendy Gramm for a
second term as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.
   During Mrs. Gramm's two years on the panel, she and the
CFTC have faced a steady barrage of criticism for not
policing the Chicago commodity exchanges more closely. But
defenders say Mrs. Gramm has allowed the exchanges to expand
their product lines and develop into the most innovative
markets in the world.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu met
with officials of the Chicago commodity exchanges and
Illinois Gov. James Thompson to discuss the battle over
regulation of the futures markets. The meeting was billed as
a chance for futures-markets leaders to take their case to
the White House.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department and the Securities and Exchange
Commission are lobbying to move regulation of some financial
futures to the SEC from the CFTC, a move the Chicago
exchanges have said would produce tighter supervision that
would hurt their markets.</p>
