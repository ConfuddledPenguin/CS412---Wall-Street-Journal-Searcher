	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canada's House of Commons is expected to approve
by Wednesday legislation to introduce a 7% consumption tax,
effective Jan. 1.
   The contested bill also needs to be approved by the
Senate, an appointed body. The Senate, which is controlled by
the opposition Liberal Party, is expected to eventually pass
the legislation, but only after a lengthy fight with Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Party
government.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed tax has provoked widespread protests.
Anti-tax demonstrations are to be held in Toronto tomorrow to
coincide with Mr. Mulroney's scheduled meeting in the city
with President Bush.</p>
<p>The planned levy, known as the goods and services tax, has
contributed to a sharp fall in the Conservative Party's
popularity. According to a recent Gallup Poll, only 17% of
decided Canadians support the Conservatives, the lowest
rating for a governing party in the 48-year history of Gallup
party-preference polling in Canada.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulroney told the House of Commons Friday that "doing
what is right for the nation oftentimes means doing things
that are difficult and unpopular."</p>
<p>The planned tax will replace an outmoded and more narrowly
based 13.5% manufacturers' sales tax. The new levy is similar
to the value-added tax systems that have been introduced in
48 other countries in the past 20 years. The Bush
administration has ruled out such a tax for the U.S.</p>
<p>Canadian businesses are to levy the new tax on their
domestic sales. They are to be allowed to claim a credit for
any tax they pay on their purchases of goods and services.
The burden of the tax is to fall on the consumer.</p>
<p>Critics of the planned tax claim it would be inflationary,
would weigh more heavily on the poor than on the rich, and
would dissuade the government from cutting spending. The
government estimates it would boost consumer prices 1.25%
next year.</p>
<p>Supporters of the tax say that, in replacing the existing
sales tax, it would foster savings, encourage manufacturing,
and strengthen exports.</p>
<p>The tax isn't to be applied to basic groceries,
prescription drugs, and medical services. Credits will be
paid to low-income Canadians to offset the tax's impact.</p>
<p>Labor unions are already demanding compensation for the
inflationary impact of the tax, and consumers are expected to
increase their spending later this year to beat the tax's
introduction. Housing construction this year will remain
"relatively buoyant" as builders rush to complete and sell
houses prior to the imposition of the tax, said Toronto
Dominion Bank. Some auto buying, however, is expected to be
deferred until next year because the planned tax will be less
burdensome on cars than the existing sales tax. An Ottawa
funeral home, in radio advertisements, recommends making
arrangements for prepaid funerals before Sept. 1 to avoid the
tax.</p>
