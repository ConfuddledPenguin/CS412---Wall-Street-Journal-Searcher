	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush said he plans to prevent oil
drilling in "certain highly sensitive areas," but aides say a
formal decision still is weeks off.
   Mr. Bush, who made his comment in response to questions at
a convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors,
has been debating for months whether to allow drilling in
three environmentally sensitive tracts off the coasts of
Florida and California. A task force Mr. Bush formed to study
the question sent him a series of options early this year,
but Mr. Bush hasn't announced a decision.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In response to a question about whether he would consider
banning all offshore drilling, Mr. Bush said he wouldn't
approve of any general ban, but then added: "We will be
announcing a policy that prohibits drilling in certain highly
sensitive areas." He didn't refer specifically to the
controversial Florida and California tracts under
consideration, but seemed to be referring to them.</p>
<p>Administration aides said a final decision about the
tracts appears to be several weeks off. Mr. Bush has asked
for additional information about the offshore areas and
possible options before making his decision, but he hasn't
received that information yet, officials said.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush's task force recommended a series of options,
which aides said would have the effect of delaying a federal
sale of drilling rights on the tracts for periods ranging
from two to 10 years. But officials said the administration
also is considering the possibility of subdividing the
sensitive tracts so that drilling could be blocked in the
most environmentally fragile areas while it proceeds in other
areas.</p>
