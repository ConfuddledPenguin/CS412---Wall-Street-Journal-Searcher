	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Hurt by substantially lower earnings at its
forest products subsidiary, Canadian Pacific Ltd.'s net
income this year "is going to be down from 1989" net from
continuing operations of 664.6 million Canadian dollars
(US$568.7 million) or C$2.09 (US$1.79) a share, said William
Stinson, chairman, president and chief executive officer.
   After a presentation to analysts, Mr. Stinson said that
while earnings at 79.7%-owned Canadian Pacific Forest
Products Ltd. will drop substantially, it's "too early to
tell on balance" how Canadian Pacific's other businesses will
perform.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Including income from discontinued operations, Canadian
Pacific had net income of C$745.2 million, or C$2.35 a share,
last year. Revenue was C$11.02 billion.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Canadian Pacific closed unchanged at $20.875.</p>
<p>Mr. Stinson told analysts that first-quarter revenue was
up about 5% at wholly owned CP Rail, but earnings will be
"about flat with '89." He said grain traffic, which accounts
for about 25% of CP Rail's business, still isn't "up to the
levels anticipated."</p>
<p>Mr. Stinson said 87.1%-owned PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd.
will report higher first-quarter earnings due to higher oil
prices. He said Canadian Pacific's Fording Coal Ltd. unit, is
"going to do better {in 1990} than the C$40 million after
tax" it earned in 1989.</p>
<p>Canadian Pacific is a Montreal-based transportation,
natural-resources, telecommunications and real estate
concern.</p>
