	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Despite higher crude oil prices, most major oil
companies are expected to report flat to lower first-quarter
earnings. And the profit outlook for the current quarter
isn't any better.
   "For the industry, last year's first quarter is going to
be tough to match," C.J. Silas, chairman of Phillips
Petroleum Co., said in a recent interview.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Specifically, the 18 largest oil companies are expected to
post first-quarter operating earnings totaling about $5.56
billion, down 2.2% from a year earlier, according to Bernard
Picchi, a securities analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>"The big negative factor is chemicals," Mr. Picchi said.</p>
<p>Petrochemical profits were exceptionally high in the 1989
first half but have plummeted since that time. Weakened
demand and rapid overbuilding of capacity have created a glut
of many chemicals. Ethylene, for instance, a commodity
petrochemical used to make more sophisticated materials, now
sells for around 24 cents a pound, 22% below the year-ago
price.</p>
<p>The rapid decline in chemical prices had even sparked some
industry concern that a long-term drop might be in the works.
For the moment, it appears that isn't happening. "Prices have
leveled off and come back up some," Sir Peter Holmes,
chairman of Shell Transport & Trading, said. "We don't expect
to see the early '80s happening again" when a glut drove the
industry into a depression.</p>
<p>The chief beneficial factor for oil company results in the
just-ended period was the price of crude, which averaged
around $19.50 a barrel, up $3 from a year ago.</p>
<p>Natural gas prices rose only slighty, disappointing many
companies that were hoping last winter that gas would break
out of its long price depression. Gas supplies were extremely
tight during the freeze in December and prices shot up, but
then the weather suddenly became warmer-than-normal, and
prices tumbled back down even faster.</p>
<p>Gasoline refining and marketing margins in the first
quarter were anemic. "They were very weak early in the
quarter and didn't come back much," Frederick Leuffer, a
securities analyst at C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.,
said. Margins were also weak in the 1989 first quarter, so
refining results will be flat to slightly lower.</p>
<p>For the current quarter, refining and marketing is the
industry's big profit question mark. "Right now, margins are
low," said a spokesman for USX Corp. "But I would expect
margins this summer to improve."</p>
<p>That feeling isn't universal, however. Crude prices have
been falling lately, which generally helps margins because
oil is the feedstock for gasoline refining. But many industry
economists think gasoline demand for the critical summer
driving season could be weaker than it was last year,
countering that possible margin improvement.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, most oil company exploration and production
earnings probably won't compare well with last year's second
quarter. "We're in that weak demand part of the season and
{crude oil} prices could drop another $1 or $2," from current
levels, said Eugene Nowak, a securities analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, comparable year-ago prices were
unusually high for the period, breaking the seasonal pattern
in part because of the Alaskan oil spill and disruptions in
the British North Sea. Those events temporarily reduced the
supply of certain desirable crudes, driving prices up during
much of the quarter. In last year's second quarter, in fact,
some crude prices eclipsed $24 a barrel. Currently, they are
around $19 a barrel.</p>
