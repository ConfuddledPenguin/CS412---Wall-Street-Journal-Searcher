	<p class="article-leader">B. Manischewitz Co.'s burst in sales every Passover used
to seem like a blessing. Lately it seems more like a plague.
   The Jersey City, N.J., company's Passover business has
drawn the kind of attention no enterprise wants: from a
federal prosecutor brandishing criminal antitrust charges and
from investors hoping for a management ouster.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The matzo maker has denied the charges and promised
prosperity and growth. But some investors and analysts and
the only outside director of Manischewitz say the company is
oblivious to the surging year-round demand, even from
non-Jews, for new kosher products.</p>
<p>"It's a no-brainer to double the size of this company, but
nobody has addressed the issue," says shareholder Lawrence
Goldstein, a principal of Santa Monica Partners, a New York
investment firm. "This company needs a fresh management
approach. I would have said the same prior to" the indictment
last month of Manischewitz by a federal grand jury in Newark,
N.J., on charges of conspiring to fix Passover matzo prices.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Herr, a 20-year veteran of the Manischewitz board,
says: "This is a company that, in my estimation, has missed
many great opportunities." Mr. Herr is senior vice president
of Chicago Corp., an Illinois investment-banking firm.</p>
<p>Manischewitz -- which declined to comment for this article
-- makes matzo and other kosher foods. For this Passover,
which begins at sundown today, Manischewitz will record an
estimated $7.5 million in sales of matzo alone. The company
commands some 80% of the U.S. matzo market, half sold at this
time of year.</p>
<p>Observant Jews have eaten the unleavened bread for
Passover, an annual eight-day festival marking the Biblical
exodus from Egypt, for more than 3,000 years. Manischewitz,
which has never strayed far from tradition in 102 years,
expects to rake in money for years to come.</p>
<p>Yet, while many companies mistakenly venture outside a
lucrative niche, Manischewitz shows how refusing to leave a
niche can also be damaging. "Either you move forward or
backward in business," says shareholder J. Morton Davis,
chairman of D.H. Blair & Co., a New York securities firm.
"You have to exploit opportunity when it's there, and they're
not," he says of Manischewitz.</p>
<p>Robert M. Starr, 61-year-old president and chief executive
officer of Manischewitz, declined to comment. But last
October, in the wake of an abortive management-led buy-out
bid, he said Manischewitz was no longer for sale, and added:
"The company remains strong. Our position in the marketplace
is solid."</p>
<p>Manischewitz had sales of $32.5 million for the fiscal
year ended last July 31. But heavy legal expenses and costly
efforts to sell the company slashed net income to $286,861,
or $5.41 a share, from $2.9 million, or $55.08 a share, a
year earlier.</p>
<p>The more than two-year-old federal antitrust investigation
of Manischewitz, which sells through some 50 distributors,
has taken a toll. Last year, the company endorsed the
management-led buy-out bid, valued at $44.6 million, or $841
share, but the plan crumbled after outsiders in the buy-out
group were unable to get Manischewitz to disclose details of
the investigation. (The shares, thinly traded on the
Cincinnati Stock Exchange, were quoted most recently at $700
bid.) Last year, Manischewitz turned away at least two other
suitors.</p>
<p>If found guilty of the price-fixing charges, the company
could face millions of dollars in penalties and possibly a
backlash from indignant consumers. Manischewitz, which
earlier defeated one competitor's civil antitrust lawsuit
over the gefilte-fish market, has said its matzo prices are
fair.</p>
<p>Founded in 1888 by a rabbi, the company has always served
observant Jews; it adheres strictly to kashrut, ancient laws
that govern food preparation. The company has three of the
four major matzo brands in the U.S: Manischewitz, Horowitz
Margareten and Goodman's. (The fourth is Streit's, made by
Aron Streit Inc., New York.) Besides matzo, which accounts
for more than 40% of sales, Manischewitz makes soup, cookies,
cakes and processed fish.</p>
<p>A big bite of the profit is passed on to four
Manischewitz-family members, with a 36% stake. On top of a
total of nearly $200,000 a year in consulting fees, the four
(three of whom are directors) together receive $750,000 a
year in dividends.</p>
<p>While stressing dividends, the company has largely ignored
fundamental changes sweeping through its market, investors
and analysts say. No longer dominated by a few firms making
only a few items, the kosher-food industry has moved into new
and expanding markets. Not only are more young Jews keeping
kosher, but the perception among non-Jews that kosher
products are very healthy is rising as well, marketing
consultants say.</p>
<p>The new kosher foods include such diverse fare as pizza,
tacos, egg rolls and pollack, a fish. Menachem Lubinsky, a
New York marketing consultant, says marketers have launched
an estimated 1,000 new kosher products in the past year
alone. He says kosher-food sales probably exceed $1.5 billion
a year in the U.S. and are growing at least 15% a year. Sales
at Manischewitz grew half that fast during the past four
years.</p>
<p>Investors say adopting modern marketing techniques would
spur growth. National Foods Inc., New York, which was one of
the bidders for Manischewitz last year, has $150 million in
annual sales-- quadruple Manischewitz's volume -- partly by
promoting its Hebrew National franks on television (which
Manischewitz shuns).</p>
<p>They also point to Manischewitz's performance in the wine
business. Manischewitz licenses others to use its name on
traditional kosher wine, which is sweet. But consumers have
swung toward dry wine, and the company's once-healthy royalty
stream is now a trickle. In contrast, Royal Wine Co.
introduced kosher dry wines in 1978; now they account for two
of every three bottles that the New York company sells.
Manischewitz's licensee finally rolled out a dry table wine
last year.</p>
<p>Even in its matzo business, Manischewitz has missed
chances. In an era of soaring health-consciousness, many food
companies might like to proclaim that their principal product
is served for breakfast in the celebrated Pritikin diet
program. Manischewitz's matzo is, but Mr. Goldstein, the
shareholder, says the company's marketers have ignored that
fact.</p>
