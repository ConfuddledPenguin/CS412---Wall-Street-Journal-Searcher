	<p class="article-leader">ASHLAND, Ky. -- Ashland Oil Inc. said it sold 58% of the
stock of Ashland Technology Corp. to a newly formed employee
stock ownership plan. The company said there will be no
impact on earnings.
   Ashland said it will receive cash, stock and subordinated
debt of the new company. Total value received for engineering
businesses was $97 million, Ashland said, but that sum
includes proceeds from the sale last February of Williams
Brothers Engineering Co., a subsidiary of Ashland Technology,
to Fluor Corp., Irvine, Calif.</p>
