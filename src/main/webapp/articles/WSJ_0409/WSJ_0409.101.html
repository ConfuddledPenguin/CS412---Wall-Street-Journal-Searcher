	<p class="article-leader">No question about it, they're cute. But is the spotted owl
so cute that thousands of families of men, women and children
have to abandon their jobs and homes on its behalf? That's a
rhetorical question. Anyone who follows modern American
politics and the environmental movement knows that if it's a
choice between people and animals today, the animals will
probably win. That was the clear message of a federal report
released last week on an issue that sets about 1,500 pairs of
spotted owls against the people who make their living cutting
down trees in the Pacific Northwest.
   The spotted owl is being used to try to achieve a longtime
environmentalist goal of stopping all logging in the
"old-growth" evergreen national forests that stretch from
Northern California to British Columbia. A team of government
wildlife biologists spent six months studying the creatures
and last week presented its conclusions to a meeting of no
fewer than three subcommittees on Capitol Hill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Inter-Agency Scientific Committee on Spotted Owl
concluded that the owls are threatened. Currently, mankind
has set aside "SOHAs", or Spotted Owl Habitat Areas, of 300
or so protected acres for each pair of owls. But the SOHAs
apparently aren't big enough, because it turns out that the
spotted owls aren't all that wise.</p>
<p>They wander into open, already lumbered areas and get
killed by, of all things, the great horned owl. The face of
the horned owl is cute, too, at least to human eyes. But
apparently the horned owl's natural instincts don't respond
to anthropomorphism. Other spotted owls become separated,
don't reproduce or start inbreeding. "By some estimates
(perhaps conservative), spotted owl habitat has been reduced
by about 60% since 1800," said the report. The wildlife
biologists acknowledged, however, that some owl pairs have
been found in "new growth" areas.</p>
<p>To save the owl, the biologists recommended new "HCAs," or
Habitat Conservation Areas, of at least 12 miles for each 20
owl pairs. In effect, however, that would mean ending all
logging in as much as 40% of the Northwest's national forest
land, some three million acres. This strikes us as a somewhat
unbalanced solution.</p>
<p>But Congressman Jim Jontz, who represents Kokomo, Indiana,
has adopted the owls as an issue of concern to him, and he
declared how pleased he was by the recommendation. Also, the
man from the Wilderness Society located in Washington, D.C.,
felt vindicated: "The spotted owl is in grave danger and by
extension therefore the ancient forest is also in grave
danger." The Society hadn't made much progress stopping the
loggers in the ancient forest until it adopted the owl as the
basis for a series of lawsuits.</p>
<p>The environmentalists have won many of their courtroom
victories before federal judges in the Ninth Circuit, in the
wilderness called San Francisco. With the biologists' report,
the Fish and Wildlife Service now won't have much choice but
to list the spotted owl as a formal endangered species this
June. Even more logging will have to cease.</p>
<p>People in California, Oregon and Washington stand to lose
anywhere from 9,000 to 60,000 logging jobs, not to mention
the thousands of other jobs serving the timber industry
(there isn't much else to do in these timber areas). John
Hampton, president of Willamina Lumber Co., figured the
recommendation would set aside between four million and five
million acres for owl habitat, about $95 million in timber
for each pair of spotted owls. Rep. Bob Smith of Oregon told
the hearing, "To those of you who are unfamiliar with the
spotted owl, I say welcome to the demise of the Pacific
Northwest."</p>
<p>Logger Jerry Lappell of Forks, Wash., captured the class
nature of the dispute: "We all like spotted owls. The gripe
we've got is with preservationists. I think they're
overeducated and they drive through and judge us in three
hours instead of living here all their life."</p>
<p>The publicity around these battles that environmentalists
start tends to get presented to the public in all-or-nothing,
good-vs.-evil terms. There's obviously a lot of gray in this
one. Of the 5.1 million acres of national forest inhabited by
the owls, nearly 40% is already protected from or unsuitable
for logging. As for the old-growth forests of 100-year-old
Douglas fir, spruce and hemlock, at least 900,000 acres are
already protected wilderness and can't be logged.</p>
<p>We just don't see that the environmental lobby should be
accorded the moral high ground on this one. The land area at
issue here is huge. If this nation's land laws, its courts,
its federal agencies and Congress have arrived at the point
that Americans have to leave their jobs and homes on behalf
of 3,000 owls, then the political system is not functioning
as it was intended to.</p>
