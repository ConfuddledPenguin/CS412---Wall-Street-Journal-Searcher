	<p class="article-leader">VIENNA -- To return to this city after 20 years is to
discover revitalization. On a sunny spring day, sidewalk
cafes are in full bloom on the stylish pedestrian malls that
wend through rococo grandeur. Newly scrubbed buildings
contrast sharply with the lingering postwar drabness of 1969.
It is no longer hard to imagine what Vienna's "fin de siecle"
heyday must have been like, and to wonder whether it is on
the verge of something like that again.
   Some have argued that the Hapsburg empire fell precisely
because it was too liberal, too relaxed, too frivolous, too
cosmopolitan and too multinational to cope with the 20th
century's explosion of militaristic nationalism. Could be.
Partly because it had all those qualities, gay Vienna at the
turn of the century was a haven for individuals who would be
leading protagonists in the century's great, bloody
historical dramas. Austrian politician-banker Hannes Androsch
listed them in a 1987 anthology called "Austria Past and
Present" (Christian Brandstatter Verlag & Edition):</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"While Leo Bronstein, later known as Trotsky, was playing
chess at the Cafe Central, another exile from Russia, Joseph
Dzhugashvili, called Stalin by his fellow revolutionaries,
lived in a modest flat in Schonbrunnerstrasse busy working on
a paper examining the nationality question of the monarchy, a
work commissioned by his mentor, Vladimir Ulyanow, or Lenin.
At the same time one Josip Broz, who had still a long way to
go before achieving fame as Tito, worked as a toolmaker at a
factory in Wiener Neustadt, while in a night shelter in
Meldemann Strasse in Vienna's 20th district, a part-time
post-card painter named Adolf Hitler delivered political
speeches against Zionism, a movement initiated in Vienna a
few years earlier by the staff writer of the daily `Neue
Freie Presse,' Theodor Herzl, under the influence of the
Dreyfus affair.</p>
<p>"At the same time there sat in the Reichsrat, the
monarchy's legislative body, the Czech, Thomas Masaryk, later
to become his country's first president, and the Italian,
Alcide de Gasperi, who after World War II was to rise to be
one of Europe's dominating political figures.</p>
<p>"Confronted with this bundle of fateful parallelisms, one
is somewhat hard put to discard it all as mere coincidence.
Meanwhile, keeping aloof from politics as well as from
`official' medical science, Sigmund Freud, in his doctor's
office in 19 Bergasse put his patients on the couch and
psychoanalysis on the map, thereby laying bare the secret
dimension of a society dancing on the top of the volcano."</p>
<p>It is hard to imagine such an incredible cast of fame's
fledglings assembled in today's Vienna, or any other city.
But it is not so hard to conjure a new role for Vienna itself
in Europe. The empire built by the Vienna post-card painter
collapsed long ago and now the one assembled by the scribbler
of Schonbrunnerstrasse may be crumbling as well. If Europe is
to become a kinder and gentler place in the 1990s -- and that
still is more a hope than a certainty -- quite possibly
Vienna can help make it happen.</p>
<p>Mr. Androsch writes that "at the bottom of their hearts
the Austrians have not yet come to terms with the downfall of
their empire." But no one seriously talks of trying to
reassemble Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia into a new
mini-Austro-Hungarian empire. For one thing, Austria's
ambitions mainly turn it westward. It very much wants to
become a part of the European Community and share in the
benefits of the EC's reduced barriers to trade and capital
flows. It can't imagine why its 1955 declaration of
neutrality, which helped it escape the Soviet grip, should
remain a barrier in a Europe that is becoming less polarized
politically.</p>
<p>But Austria is not neglectful of its former empire
partners as they emerge from their long night of communism.
Interestingly enough, the thing it has to offer that might be
most valuable to them is its pragmatism, something for which
Austrians have been criticized more often than they have been
praised. Austrians like to point out that they did not go
socialist for ideological reasons, but simply because state
ownership seemed the quickest way to rebuild the country's
war-shattered industry in the postwar era.</p>
<p>Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, a tall onetime basketball
star, makes this point during an interview in the parliament
building office he uses part of the time when Parliament is
in session. He is proud of Austria's success in weaning state
industries of subsidies, selling off interests in them to the
private sector, and at the same time allowing a vigorous
private sector to develop. The results show it. Austria's
economy is one of the world's best performers, with real
growth last year of 4%, inflation of 2.6% and unemployment of
3.4%.</p>
<p>Mr. Vranitzky doesn't expect miracles in the East, but
Austria is doing what it can to help. "We can't supply them
with billions of dollars or deutsche marks, but the size of
our own industry fits very well with the structures of East
Europeans.</p>
<p>"We try to expand cooperation with them beyond business,
money and economics. We cooperate in party politics. That
means we exchange experts and assist them in how to run a
party, how to run a campaign, how to raise funds, how to
educate the younger people in the party." Austria has been
governed by a grand coalition for the past four years. Its
parties have counterparts in Hungary, which is just emerging
from a second round of elections, and the Austrian coalition
might well serve as a model for Hungary's new government.</p>
<p>"The first and foremost step they must take is to find
political bearings," says Chancellor Vranitzky. "After that
we will see what kind of government they have and the work --
the very painful and very burdensome work -- to remodel and
restructure and redo their systems will be brought forward.
My perspective is that this will take quite some time. This
will not go smoothly and quickly."</p>
<p>Austria may be able to help with this process by sharing
some of its own experiences. Modernizing Hungarian industry
will mean laying off workers. But Austria has done just that
and has come out of it with a vote of confidence from labor,
which welcomed the security greater efficiency provides.</p>
<p>But Austria was in darkness only seven years. It was able
to return to former owners much of the private property the
Nazis and Russians had seized. Agriculture snapped back
quickly. But privatizing after 40 years is complex.</p>
<p>"Some think one or the other country could become a member
of the EC, or EFTA, {European Free Trade Association} very
soon, but I do not think this is possible within the
foreseeable future," says the chancellor.</p>
<p>There can be surprises, however. Other great cities, such
as Prague and Budapest, could snap back faster than expected
now that freedom is returning. The villains that "fin de
siecle" Vienna hatched failed to kill it. That is cause for
much hope.</p>
