	<p class="article-leader">PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Stanford University President Donald
Kennedy called for the university to make teaching, rather
than research, its top priority.
   In an annual address last week to the university's
Academic Council, Mr. Kennedy said both teaching and research
are important to the university, but "the relative weight has
shifted over time" toward research. He said Stanford
educators "need to talk about teaching more, respect and
reward those who do it well, and make it first among our
labors."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stanford needs to pay more attention to students,
particularly undergraduates, he said. There is a "suspicion
that we have lost focus in designing and delivering a well
planned, challenging and inspiring education to our
undergraduates," Mr. Kennedy said. He criticized faculty
members who reduce teaching duties to concentrate on
research, leaving "too many of Stanford's classes" taught by
visiting or temporary staffers.</p>
<p>Mr. Kennedy's remarks come at a time when educators around
the nation are calling for colleges and universities to
commit more resources to students, and move away from the
"publish or perish" mentality that often results in teachers,
eager to secure tenure, emphasizing their research
activities.</p>
