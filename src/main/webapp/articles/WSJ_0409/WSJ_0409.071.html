	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department suspended Bell
Atlantic Corp. from receiving future business from the
federal government because the telecommunications company
allegedly misled the agency on a telephone bid.
   The Treasury, in a letter dated last Tuesday, informed
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic that it believes a Bell
Atlantic subsidiary, Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co., made
"material misrepresentations" in a bid for a $100 million
contract to modernize the Treasury's telephone system in the
Washington area. American Telephone & Telegraph Co. also is
bidding for the work, in the latest of a series of bitter
contests to update the federal government's phone system
after the breakup of the old Bell system.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Treasury spokesman said the allegations of
misrepresentation had been forwarded to the agency's
inspector general for an investigation. Until the
investigation is completed, Bell Atlantic is barred from
receiving future contracts from any federal agency.</p>
<p>It's unclear how the ban will affect Bell Atlantic, which
estimates its revenue from the federal government at more
than $250 million annually. Bell Atlantic is set to begin
service this week on a telephone contract, valued at tens of
millions of dollars annually, to hook Washington-area federal
agencies together. The telecommunications company also has
won a big Pentagon telephone contract, but that award is
being appealed.</p>
<p>Bell Atlantic denounced the Treasury decision as showing
"clear bias" in favor of AT&T. It also accused the agency of
trying to "eliminate C&P {Chesapeake & Potomac} from the
bidding." The Treasury denied any bias; AT&T declined
comment.</p>
<p>The allegations of misrepresentation focus on whether Bell
Atlantic based its bid on telecommunications equipment that
wasn't "commercially available," as required by the Treasury.
Bell Atlantic said it had successfully challenged two
attempts by the Treasury to award the contract to AT&T by
making the same allegations -- that AT&T hadn't used
commercially available equipment.</p>
<p>The Treasury telephone contract was supposed to have been
awarded in 1987, but is now three years behind schedule
because of the wrangling between Bell Atlantic and its former
parent, AT&T. The latest Treasury decision will delay the
award at least until the end of the inspector general's
investigation. If history is any guide, the final contract
award will probably be challenged by the loser.</p>
