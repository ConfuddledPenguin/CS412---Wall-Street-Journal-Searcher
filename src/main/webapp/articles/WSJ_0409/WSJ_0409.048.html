	<p class="article-leader">In your Feb. 21 Law-column item "Declaring Insolvency
Called a Bad Solution," St. Louis lawyer Donald B. Kramer
asserts that filing a bankruptcy petition can be a terrible
error.
   With proper counsel, bankruptcy is a sound and effective
strategy and can be beneficial, improving one's
credit-worthiness and reputation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kramer's assertion suffers basic flaws:</p>
<p>A Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition can be filed only once
every seven years. In most bankruptcies, the debtor gets a
"clean slate" and thus is a more attractive candidate for
credit. While filing a bankruptcy petition may result in a
temporary "black mark," the benefits outweigh the negatives.</p>
<p>Mr. Kramer implies that all problems can be worked out
amicably. However, many times it is either impossible or far
too costly in terms of legal fees to negotiate with
credit-card companies. If creditors established "workout
departments" specifically for consumer debts -- similar to
the departments that exist for commercial loans -- the
likelihood of amicable resolutions might be increased.</p>
