	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Home Products Corp. definitively
agreed to sell its household-products business for $1.25
billion to Reckitt & Colman PLC, a London consumer-products
company.
   Closing of the previously announced transaction still is
subject to antitrust clearance and other regulatory filings
and approvals. American Home said the definitive agreement
targets May 31 as the closing date for at least the U.S.
operations involved. If sales of other lines are cleared on
that date, they will be completed as well.</p>
