	<p class="article-leader">The oasis of rationality that you find in various
proposals to control air pollution in San Francisco is one
that would reduce smog by taxing it directly ("Paying the
Tailpiper," Review & Outlook, Feb. 28). Presumably your
favored solution to a famine would be to charge a special
levy on food. Those who could not afford the resulting higher
prices would expire, thus neatly solving the problem. You may
not have come to bury San Francisco in ridicule, but if the
solution you advocate is adopted, the rest of the country
will do it for you.
   I am not at all surprised that the scheme is being
promoted by a cabal of local business interests, for it is
replete with all the features that would appeal to such a
group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>First, it socks it to consumers rather than business, as
it seeks to reduce pollution by curbing the number of miles
driven, rather than the development of cars that are less
polluting.</p>
<p>Second, it is designed to be a bonanza for all those
companies that will be selling tuneups, cleaner fuel,
anti-smog devices and replacements for junked old cars, as
consumers struggle to keep the smog tax within the bounds of
what they can afford. If they lose the battle, they will have
to walk or use public transportation.</p>
<p>Third, those who use employer-provided cars or have the
resources to replace their vehicle every few years (in which
number we should probably count the CEOs of the illustrious
companies you name) will either pass the smog tax on to the
consumer through their product prices, or pay it from their
pocket change. Meanwhile, they will drive by the walkers and
those waiting at the bus stop at 48 mph on properly priced
highways.</p>
<p>No doubt the proposal would solve the highway and
fresh-air famine, but somehow I prefer a scheme that would
give everyone fair usage of the nation's infrastructural
resources. Even-numbered license plates on the roads on
even-numbered days sounds good to me.</p>
