	<p class="article-leader">BANK OF NEW ENGLAND (Boston) -- Moody's Investors Service
Inc. lowered ratings on about $750 million of long-term debt,
subordinated debt and preferred stock. The rating agency said
Bank of New England's increase in problem loans during the
first quarter has "raised greater uncertainty regarding the
viability of the institution." Moody's lowered Bank of New
England's senior debt to Caa from B3, its senior subordinated
debt to Ca from Caa, its shelf registration for senior debt
to (P)Caa from (P)B3 and its preferred stock to `ca' from
`caa.' Moody's confirmed the "not prime" rating for
commercial paper. Moody's also confirmed the ratings of Bank
of New England's subsidiary banks for deposit obligations,
based on its view that depositors would receive
"substantially better" regulatory protection than holding
company creditors. Bank of New England N.A. and Connecticut
Bank & Trust remain rated at Ba3 for long-term deposits and
"not prime" for short-term deposits. The banks' obligations
backed by letters of credit remain at Caa.</p>
