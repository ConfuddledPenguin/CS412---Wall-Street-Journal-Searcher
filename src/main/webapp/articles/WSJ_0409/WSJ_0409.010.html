	<h3>This State May Be Penny-Wise, But It Sure Looks Pound-Foolish</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- At last count, Massachusetts is facing a budget
deficit this year of $800 million.
   Make that $799,999,999.99, thanks to a punctilious
computer that figures a penny taxed is a penny earned.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Part of the credit for reducing the state's megadeficit
also goes to Anne Eustis, the exceedingly scrupulous town
treasurer of Princeton, Mass. In February, during a year-end
review of the town's books, Mrs. Eustis found she'd
shortchanged the state 10 cents on town payroll withholding
last July. "So I called {the state revenue department} up and
asked them if they wanted it paid," Mrs. Eustis notes.</p>
<p>She needn't have asked. "They said yes, they did." Off
went a letter explaining the error and a check for the 10
cents.</p>
<p>Her fiscal good nature was soon to be taxed, however. Two
weeks later, the state responded with a bill seeking an
additional penny for interest due on the 10 cents. "I
literally got a bill for a penny," she says, noting that it
seems rather ridiculous that the state would spend a quarter
on postage to collect a penny.</p>
<p>The state blames the dunning notice on a computer. Once an
adjustment has been made to a payment, explains spokeswoman
Betsy Houghteling, it automatically goes into a computer
system, and the state issues a notice of assessment. The
computer, in kicking out a notice of assessment for the 10
cents, even though it had already been paid, tacked on a bill
for the penny interest.</p>
<p>The taxpayer-assistance person who originally advised Mrs.
Eustis to pay the dime was probably just trying to help, and
had Mrs. Eustis talked to a different person she might have
been told to forget about it, Ms. Houghteling says. She adds:
"I'm sure it was a sincere attempt to keep her on the right
side of everything, but it ended up generating a lot of paper
around it."</p>
<p>Ms. Houghteling says the Princeton case is a "once in a
blue moon" situation and Mrs. Eustis can rest assured the
state won't pinch Princeton for the penny. "It's good that
she's so careful with her accounting, but she needn't worry
that anything will happen subsequent to this," Ms.
Houghteling adds.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eustis says she won't write a check for the one-penny
interest, which is due on April 15, but will probably tape a
penny to the bill and send it back.</p>
