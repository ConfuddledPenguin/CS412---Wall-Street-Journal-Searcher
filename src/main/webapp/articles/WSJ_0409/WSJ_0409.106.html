	<p class="article-leader">Six months ago, Stephen M. Wolf was flying high.
   The chairman and chief executive officer of UAL Corp. had
just secured an arrangement that would make him part owner of
the nation's second-largest airline -- and very wealthy as
well. His stock options had soared in value to $76 million
when UAL directors agreed to sell the company to a group led
by Mr. Wolf and United Airlines' pilots union.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But since that bid suddenly collapsed last Oct. 13,
prospects have gone from bad to worse for the man who once
was a darling of Wall Street. His crash landing came Friday
with the UAL board's acceptance of a new offer from United's
three unions -- one without Mr. Wolf. Though there still may
be a long-shot chance of a comeback, it's likely the
48-year-old Mr. Wolf will lose his job.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf's slide has been one of the surprising features
of the UAL saga. The airline executive, an intensely private
person, won't talk about the events of the past several
months. But others close to the lengthy UAL negotiations,
including some of Mr. Wolf's allies, say that his personal
style served to exacerbate his troubles.</p>
<p>According to the portrait they paint, Mr. Wolf squandered
opportunities and alienated all three of the airline's
unions.</p>
<p>When the labor-management bid collapsed last October, the
pilot union had expected Mr. Wolf to take the lead in
reviving the buy-out effort. A few days after the collapse,
Frederick C. Dubinsky, the pilot-union chairman, conferred
with Mr. Wolf. He found Mr. Wolf subdued.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf then "essentially went into hiding," Mr. Dubinsky
says.</p>
<p>The pilot union's advisers, meanwhile, forged ahead on a
new bid of $220 to $240 a share to replace the failed
$300-a-share proposal. At least the sharp drop in UAL's stock
price, they told the pilots, meant the unions wouldn't have
to provide as many concessions.</p>
<p>But UAL management had other ideas. On Dec. 4, the pilots'
advisers traveled to UAL director Ralph Strangis's law
offices in Minneapolis. Mr. Wolf had asked Mr. Strangis, a
longtime friend, to present management's new buy-out
proposal. In exchange for his participation, Mr. Wolf still
wanted the pilots to make the same $200 million in
concessions they had before.</p>
<p>"We said this is preposterous," recalls pilot attorney
Stuart Oran. "The objective of the union wasn't to provide
concessions for the sake of it, but to provide adequate
concessions to finance a deal." When the advisers told Mr.
Dubinsky the details of the management proposal, he was
livid. After that meeting, the pilots began intense talks
with the International Association of Machinists, whose
opposition had helped torpedo the earlier bid. "We knew we
either needed the IAM or Wolf" to put together a new offer,
Mr. Dubinsky says. But the machinists, still smarting over
previous battles with Mr. Wolf, had one condition: Mr. Wolf
and senior management couldn't be a part of the plan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Coniston Partners, UAL's largest shareholder,
was threatening to oust the board in a proxy fight if
directors didn't sell or refinance the company. The UAL board
was growing weary with Mr. Wolf's failure to put together a
new bid with the pilot union.</p>
<p>In early January, an executive committee of UAL's outside
directors met. Longtime directors Frank A. Olson, chairman of
Hertz Corp. and former UAL chairman, and John F.
McGillicuddy, chairman of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., were
particularly critical of Mr. Wolf. The committee gave Mr.
Wolf a one-week deadline to show progress.</p>
<p>But when the deadline passed with little progress, the
board placed in charge one of its lawyers, Lewis Kaden of
Davis Polk & Wardwell, and investment banker Michael Goldberg
of First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>Progress then came swiftly. At a board meeting Jan. 25,
Mr. Kaden announced all three of United's unions -- the
pilots, machinists and flight attendants -- had agreed to
work on a new buy-out effort.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf, who had appeared sullen at the meeting, then
began a behind-the-scenes effort to block the unions' bid. A
turning point came Feb. 21, when Mr. Wolf had a private
dinner meeting with the board. The next day, directors told
their advisers to stop trying to negotiate a buy-out with the
unions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on March 19, the unions announced an offer
valued at $185 a share, or about $4 billion. The kicker was
that they had teamed up with Coniston to try and oust the
board at UAL's April 26 annual shareholders meeting.</p>
<p>With the deadline looming for the start of the proxy
battle, UAL's board was pressed to make a decision.
Throughout a 21-hour board meeting that began last Thursday
and ended 6 a.m. CDT Friday, Mr. Wolf unsuccessfully tried to
block an agreement by placing a number of conditions on the
deal, people familiar with the talks said.</p>
<p>Apparently convinced of the inevitable, Mr. Wolf voted for
the agreement in principle to permit the employee buy-out.</p>
