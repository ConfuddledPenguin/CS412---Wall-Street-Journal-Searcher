	<p class="article-leader">One of the feuding siblings battling for control of the
Gallimard publishing house gave up the fight Friday and
announced she will sell her shares to a bank.
   Isabelle Gallimard, 39, will give up nearly her entire
12.5% stake in the family business to Banque Nationale de
Paris (BNP) for an undisclosed price, according to a
statement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move leaves her sister Francoise, 49, and brother
Christian, 46, alone trying to wrest control from another
brother, Antoine, 42, the firm's president and largest
shareholder.</p>
<p>The sale also effectively blunts efforts by the giant
Bouygues construction company from bidding for Gallimard. BNP
said it would hold the shares for several years. The sale to
BNP increases outside shareholdings in the family-controlled
business to about 30%.</p>
<p>Ms. Gallimard said she based her decision on the inability
of the siblings to agree on how the firm should be operated.</p>
