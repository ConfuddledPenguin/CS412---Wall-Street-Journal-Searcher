	<p class="article-leader">Inco Ltd. said it expects net proceeds of $250 million
from a public offering of 20% of P.T. International Nickel
Indonesia, resulting in an after-tax gain of about $125
million.
   The Toronto nickel producer said proceeds will be used to
pay debt and for general corporate purposes. Inco had $925
million in long-term debt at Dec. 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Inco said the offering, which will reduce its stake in
P.T. Indonesia to 58% from 78%, is part of an agreement
signed in 1968 with the Indonesian government. The shares are
expected to begin trading on Indonesia's stock exchanges next
month, the company said. Inco said in November that it was
considering an offering.</p>
<p>P.T. Indonesia, which produced 64 million pounds of
semifinished nickel last year, is 20%-owned by Sumitomo Metal
Mining Co. of Japan and 2% by a group of other Japanese
companies.</p>
