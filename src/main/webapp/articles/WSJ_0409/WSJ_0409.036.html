	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- A U.S. District Court judge here said he expects
by Wednesday to rule on a suit by BTR PLC seeking to block
Norton Co. from delaying its annual meeting.
   BTR, a London-based international conglomerate, last month
made a $75-a-share, or $1.64 billion, hostile bid for Norton,
a Worcester, Mass., maker of abrasives and engineering
materials. Norton rejected the bid as inadequate and delayed
its annual meeting to June 26 from April 26, saying it wanted
more time to consider its options.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BTR then sued Norton to have the canceled meeting
reinstated for April 26, charging that Norton's management
plans to use the delay to "change Norton's shareholder base"
in order to win an expected proxy fight. Norton said it would
vigorously defend against the suit and filed a countersuit to
enjoin BTR's tender offer and to stop BTR from soliciting
proxies.</p>
<p>In a hearing Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Joseph
Tauro said he hopes to issue a ruling on the annual meeting
date by Wednesday.</p>
<p>BTR earlier said it would start a proxy fight to unseat
Norton's board "quite soon" if it prevails in its suit to
reinstate Norton's original annual meeting date. BTR
indicated it wouldn't proceed with its planned proxy fight
for some weeks if the new meeting date were allowed to stand.</p>
