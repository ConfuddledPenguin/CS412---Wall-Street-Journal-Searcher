	<p class="article-leader">The social sciences, including my discipline,
anthropology, have made it clear that any ambitious human
enterprise must take into account cultural variations among
groups. But the concept of cultural difference has been
over-applied and misapplied, particularly in the form of the
notion of "corporate culture."
   Too often, this concept has been an excuse for
inefficiency and managerial stupidity. When Ford had 22
levels of management and Toyota five, the difference was not
in corporate culture but in sheer competence. Is the
existence of the executive dining room upstairs from the
staff canteen also corporate culture? No -- it is simply an
unintelligent personnel practice and a sign of inappropriate
privilege that costs companies money in employee morale and
is likely to encourage executive complacency.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some background: Early in the history of anthropology
there were two complementary goals. One was to try to
understand "human nature" by studying the fossil record of
early humans and our physical evolution. The other was to
document and understand the enormous range and variety of
human social arrangements.</p>
<p>In recent times the two goals have become largely
separated. The main energy of the discipline has been
concentrated on studying cultural variation and the
phenomenon of culture itself. Cultural relativity has been
elevated to a certainty -- virtually every social pattern is
taken to be of equal value, standing and naturalness to any
other. Even gender has been defined as a social construct,
and fierce antipathy greets anyone who asserts that some
measure of sex-related behavior has biological roots.</p>
<p>Enter corporate culture. Of course, each business or other
human group may enjoy what William Whyte in "The Organization
Man" called "the unique spirit" of the organization. Members
of robust organizations share a sense that their group is
special and that a definite loyalty and spark unite people.
Such unique spirit makes groups fun, and offers people a
workplace with which they can identify and from which they
can draw both personal security and occupational challenge.</p>
<p>The problem that concerns me does not arise from the
natural feelings of community that decent, sensible people
develop when they work toward a common goal. It emerges when
people confuse these healthy feelings with the managerial and
technical means employed to achieve that common goal. Ford's
22 layers of management were supported by a series of
entrenched practices that were not only ways of doing work
but also signs of affiliation to the group: "This is how we
do it at Ford." Or British Motors. Or U.S. Steel. Or General
Motors. Or any other organization that has had to change its
M.O. drastically to compete in a marketplace unforgiving of
fat, slack and imprecision in linking resources to
production.</p>
<p>Simply put, undue confidence and complacency can be subtly
but consequentially supported by the agreeable notion of
corporate culture. It can inhibit the concrete steps
necessary to compete -- especially to compete with producers
who think their process through afresh and who do not confuse
loyalty to an organization with loyalty to its particular
practices and traditions.</p>
<p>This is particularly compelling in manufacturing, because
a car is a car is a car; there are relatively few culturally
expressive ways of doing the actual work involved in making
one. Cultural relativism does not apply. Different
socio-productive patterns are not equally likely to yield
good cars at prices that suit the market. While it is a human
characteristic to try to keep things the same, technology is
immune to sentimental familiarity.</p>
<p>Of course, strong values about internal moral order and
community relations do characterize many successful
enterprises. I recently had considerable contact with the
Toronto-based Four Seasons Hotels company while doing
research for a book. It was clear that this enterprise -- a
consistently innovative luxury hotel group -- functions
effectively because it treats its work as an expression of
both its social and financial responsibility. For example, it
is building a hotel in Nevis in the Caribbean, and after
Hurricane Hugo hit it organized a relief shipment that was
the first on the scene from any source, including government.</p>
<p>All employees eventually hired, even dishwashers, are
interviewed some four times, finally by the general manager
of the hotel in which they will work. This system is designed
not only to find out about the potential employees but also
to let them know that the organization is concerned about
them personally. This surely contributes to a labor turnover
rate less than half the industry average. No one employed
five years or more can be dismissed without review by Isadore
Sharp, the chairman and CEO.</p>
<p>My discussions with senior executives about the future
revealed that their predominating concern was less about the
company's external business environment -- will people
continue to sleep in their expensive rooms? -- than it was
about becoming complacent and thoughtlessly sanctimonious
about the company's current M.O. -- would its corporate
culture overwhelm its corporate success?</p>
<p>The possibility that this would happen was reduced in the
late 1980s. As Mr. Sharp has said: "I sat down with every
senior person in the company. `This is what we stand for. If
you are not happy with it, this is the time to say so.' I had
to fire people right at the top." Now, company policies on
large initiatives and the tiny details on which good hotels
depend can be efficiently hammered out at weekly meetings of
senior managers at which no holds are barred, but during
which people know that they conclusively share a central
commitment to the company and its values. Corporate culture
is an attitude, not a structure. Evidently, the result works.</p>
