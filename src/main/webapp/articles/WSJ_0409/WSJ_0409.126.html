	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Counsellors Tandem Securities Fund Inc.
reached an accord with a large investor designed to raise the
price of shares in the closed-end equity mutual fund.
   Counsellors Tandem said it plans to offer to buy as many
as two million shares of the fund at 95% of net asset value a
share; however, if at least 2.5 million shares are tendered,
which would be more than half of the fund's 4.9 million
shares outstanding, the tender offer will be canceled.
Instead, the fund will hold a special shareholder vote on a
proposal to liquidate the fund, which management would
support.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sequoia Partners L.P., which with other investors holds
about 1.2 million, or almost 26% of the fund's shares, has
been pressing for measures to boost the fund's price, and
considering replacing the fund's board of directors.
Closed-end funds sell a limited number of shares, and
typically trade at a discount to net asset value. Timothy
Hurley, general partner of Sequoia, said, "We feel it's a
fair resolution. Our aim was to try to get the discount
eliminated, and this (agreement) goes a long way" toward that
end.</p>
<p>Tandem also will tender about 33% of the outstanding
preferred shares at $49.50 a share; it has about 880,000
shares of preferred outstanding.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, two-thirds of each class of shares
would have to approve the liquidation proposal for it to take
effect.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, John L. Furth, Tandem president, and
Mr. Hurley said, "We believe we have fashioned a creative
solution that will benefit all of Tandem's stockholders."</p>
<p>Mr. Furth said, "We are going to recommend to our
shareholders they remain in the fund." Mr. Furth said those
who don't tender would gain "an immediate enhancement in net
asset value of 4%" over the current net asset value. As of
March 30, the per-share net asset value of Counsellors Tandem
was $11.90. He said the fund had "an outstanding record" in
the past few years, and was up more than 60% in 1989.</p>
<p>Although Tandem's portfolio, which focuses on utility
stocks, has been ranked as one of the top-performing
closed-end equity funds, it has been trading at a discount to
net asset value. In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange Friday, Tandem shares closed at $11, unchanged.</p>
<p>Mr. Furth said the fund's manager, Warburg, Pincus
Counsellors Inc., wouldn't tender any shares, and that it
would recommend to its clients against tendering. Those
interests together hold 700,000 to 800,000 Tandem shares, Mr.
Furth said.</p>
<p>Under an agreement between Tandem and Sequoia, Tandem
postponed its combined annual and special meeting, which was
to have been tomorrow and Sequoia agreed to withdraw its
slate of nominees to the board. The combined annual and
special meeting will be postponed until after the tender
offer is consummated or terminated. If a special meeting is
needed to consider liquidation, election of directors and
selection of Tandem's independent auditors will occur at that
meeting. Sequoia agreed to back the management slate. It also
agreed not to purchase any more shares of Tandem for five
years.</p>
