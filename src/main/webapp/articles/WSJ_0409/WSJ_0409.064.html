	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The proposed $4.38 billion buy-out of UAL Corp.
would make the parent of United Airlines the world's largest
experiment in employee ownership. But before lenders agree to
fund the landmark transaction, they might want to take a
close look under the hood of the once-dominant carrier.
   The union proposal, approved Friday by UAL directors, does
have some appealing elements. It requires $2 billion less
debt than last year's failed bid by a group that included
management and the pilots union. There are plenty of assets
to serve as collateral and, notably, United's unions agreed
to substantial wage cuts to make the plan work.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the risks loom large as well. This is a company
consumed -- and exhausted -- by buy-out fever. Over the last
three years, the UAL board has considered a total of five
separate bids for the company. Even if this latest proposal
is completed, it might require an additional six to eight
months of wrangling and further distraction. Moreover, the
unions involved in the latest deal aren't exactly an example
of like-mindedness: They tend to squabble with each other as
much as they squabble with management. Thus, employee morale
has been sinking and, with management absorbed with bids and
counterbids, UAL has simply squandered many business
opportunities.</p>
<p>United was so preoccupied with a proposed buy-out a few
months ago, for instance, that it had to withdraw from a
competition for what might have been its first route to
Europe -- between Chicago and Glasgow, Scotland. Although
United appeared to have the early edge, it was so busy with
internal battles it ended up unable to prove to the
Transportation Department that it had enough planes for the
new route. American Airlines picked up the business by
default, and acknowledges that it wouldn't have won if United
hadn't been so distracted by buy-out proposals.</p>
<p>British Airways, which has extensive marketing ties with
United, also has grown fidgety. At a Chicago luncheon last
week, Lord King, British Air's chairman, expressed concern
about the partnership and said he hoped United could soon
return to focusing on the airline business.</p>
<p>Indeed, while rivals like American have grown rapidly,
United has stagnated. Ever since its pilots union first
broached the idea of a buy-out three years ago, its share of
the domestic airline business has remained stalled at 17%.
United has lost ground to competitors at some of its key
hubs, and now American is even threatening to usurp United's
dominance on its home turf: Chicago's O'Hare Airport. In the
last six months alone, United has trimmed its revenue
projections for future years by as much as $1.5 billion
annually.</p>
<p>If the employee bid succeeds, it is likely that United
will lose many of its top managers. The unions already have
said they will replace UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, who
fought behind the scenes to sink their plan. If he departs,
many of the executives he recruited will undoubtedly leave,
too. That has led people in the airline industry to wonder
whether the unions will be able to assemble a competent
management team on their own.</p>
<p>"The costs of this transaction are more than meet the
eye," says Karen Firestone, manager of the Fidelity Air
Transportation Fund, which owns UAL stock. "It's not just the
purchase price; you have to look at what's been happening to
the airline-management distraction, lack of immediate
competitive planning during the past year, and a demoralized
employee base."</p>
<p>Passengers sometimes felt the brunt of the company's
internal chaos. In the past 12 months, United ranked next to
last in terms of on-time performance. Its worst period was
last summer, when the pilots and flight attendants, working
without a contract, refused to volunteer any overtime. The
result: unprecedented flight delays and cancellations.</p>
<p>It is possible, of course, that an employee buy-out could
cure many of these ills. Despite some highly publicized
failures of employee-owned firms, such as the 1986 bankruptcy
filing of bearings-maker Hyatt Clark Industries Inc., worker
ownership has proven at least as successful as other forms of
corporate takeovers, according to Joseph R. Blasi, professor
at the Institute of Management and Labor Relations at Rutgers
University. He estimates employees currently are majority
owners of about 1,500 companies in the U.S.</p>
<p>For their part, United's unions predict the transaction
will end the bickering that has divided the carrier. "We
believe {the acquisition} will stabilize this company,
especially in view of all the turmoil that it's been going
through for all these months," says John Peterpaul, a
national vice president of the International Association of
Machinists, who is representing the United machinists in the
transaction. Mr. Peterpaul forecasts that "a new type of work
ethic" will emerge at the carrier if the plan goes through.</p>
<p>But the proposal also would take United into uncharted
air. Most employee buyouts have involved one major union plus
salaried employees. In United's case, the owners would be
three big unions -- the pilots, the machinists and the flight
attendants -- each with different interests and different pay
levels for their members.</p>
<p>With so many competing groups, "You have to be careful you
don't wind up with six different agendas" for the company,
says Ed Sambuchi, chief executive of McLouth Steel, a big
employee-owned company in Trenton, Mich. Every month, McLouth
managers clear a large garage in the plant to brief a group
of 60 to 70 workers on the same information given to the
board of directors two days earlier. But that kind of
communication and togetherness won't be possible at a
far-flung operation like United.</p>
<p>There is also a good chance the deal will fall through
entirely. Although UAL's board gave the three unions up to
four months to secure financing -- plus another four months
to complete the deal -- some lenders believe the chances of
obtaining the needed backing are only slightly better than
50%, especially now that many lenders are turning up their
noses at highly-leveraged transactions. "I wouldn't want to
be raising $4 billion right now," says one executive at a
major U.S. bank.</p>
<p>Even though employee ownership yields major tax
advantages, those benefits would be more than offset at UAL
by the additional debt the unions plan to carry. Kevin
Murphy, airline analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co., estimates
the buy-out will require $4 billion in bank financing on top
of the $750 million note the unions are giving shareholders.
That will add $500 million in extra annual interest costs.</p>
<p>To help fund that expense, the unions have pledged $300
million in annual pay cuts that would grow to $500 million in
1994. But those cuts are calculated off a hypothetical wage
base that rises 4% annually; so the cuts are less than they
appear. United's shrinking profit leaves little room for
error. Net income last year totaled $325 million and this
year is expected to decline to $240 million. The buy-out
would increase United's debt sixfold, from $800 million to
more than $5 billion.</p>
<p>Skepticism over financing the transaction on Friday
contributed to a $2-a-share decline in UAL's stock price.
Shares closed at $163.50 in trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. That was well below the unions' proposed buy-out
price of $201 a share, but the discount also reflects the
length of time investors would have to wait to get their
payout, as well as the fact that only $155 a share of the
purchase price is cash.</p>
<p>As might be expected, the union plan also calls for an
egalitarian approach to corporate governance. Senior
management would get to name three directors and there would
be one board seat for each of the unions. In addition, the
unions would choose eight outside directors. The pilots would
own 37.9% of the stock, the machinists 35.7% and the flight
attendants 12.2%. The remainder would be held by noncontract
employees.</p>
<p>One factor the unions may have going for them is the
growing weariness of UAL's board. Six months ago, the
directors toasted what they thought was their last meeting
together: the session at which they approved the $300-a-share
buy-out led by UAL Chairman Wolf. But that deal collapsed,
triggering one of the biggest stock market plunges in
history.</p>
<p>Since then, sources say, the board has been anxious to
resolve matters. Many of its members, such as John F.
McGillicuddy of Manufacturers Hanover Trust or Frank A. Olson
of Hertz Corp., have little sentimental attachment to the
airline business. In January, they grew so irritated with the
slow progress being made by Mr. Wolf that they ordered him to
step aside as the chief negotiator with the unions. The board
turned the job over to one of its legal advisers, Lewis Kaden
of the New York law firm of Davis Polk and Wardwell.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, employee morale continued to sink. As details
of the proposed buy-out became public, company newsletters
blasted the union's proposals as unfair to management and
other non-union employees. Mr. Wolf was particularly critical
of the unions on a number of points, saying they had
overvalued their concessions and were asking for unreasonable
job guarantees. Union leaders responded with public salvos of
their own.</p>
<p>Throughout January and February, the company delayed
releasing confidential financial projections that the union
needed to set the price of its bid. When UAL finally provided
the projections, they were so pessimistic that the union
would have had difficulty convincing lenders to finance the
deal, says one person who saw the data. The unions were
especially angry because the numbers were vastly more
negative than projections management supplied to banks to
support its own bid last September. When the union
complained, First Boston Corp., the board's adviser, agreed
to recalculate the revenue projections; the numbers ended up
higher.</p>
<p>A UAL spokesman referred questions on the episode to First
Boston, which declined to comment. One person familiar with
the projection process, however, said management ordered up
conservative numbers after being criticized, after its own
buy-out collapsed, for its earlier, overly rosy forecasts.
Moreover, the projections compiled in February were lower
partly because of increased fuel and maintenance costs, he
said.</p>
<p>As the battle between management and the unions grew more
strained, the unions ultimately linked arms with Coniston
Partners, UAL's largest shareholder, and threatened a proxy
fight to oust the board. In the end, that didn't prove
necessary. But the animosity stirred within the company was
substantial.</p>
<p>United reservation agent Iris Racataian says employees
have tried hard to keep the corporate turmoil from affecting
their dealings with the public. But she acknowledges the
situation "sure affects your pysche." Ms. Racataian says she
believes uncertainty about the airline's future "has hurt us
in terms of our ability to get and keep the most productive
employees."</p>
<p>The turmoil is visible from the outside, as well. "There's
been this restiveness over there for a long time," says
Jeffrey Kreindler, a Pan American World Airways vice
president. "It's not as if they've had a long period of
stability."</p>
<p>Thus, while American continues to amass jets, United has
moved more slowly. American now has 500 aircraft to United's
429, enabling it to expand domestically and make significant
inroads in Europe. Indeed, American used United's own hub at
Chicago to help build its European network.</p>
<p>When it came time to expand its profitable routes in the
Pacific, United again discovered the price of preoccupation.
For some time, management has been fighting with its pilots
union over buying new planes: The union wants them, partly to
assure that there will be an ever-increasing supply of jobs
for its members. Management, in turn, held out, intent on
using potential purchases of planes as a bargaining chip to
win concessions from the pilots.</p>
<p>As a result of the internal wrangling, United didn't have
the planes it needed when it came time to expand its Asian
routes. So the airline has been forced to scavenge around,
clipping a plane here and there from its domestic routes. It
has covered its Pacific expansion, but at the cost of
business domestically.</p>
