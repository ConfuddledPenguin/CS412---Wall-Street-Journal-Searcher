	<p class="article-leader">Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. reorganized its North American
tire marketing organization and named two new vice
presidents.
   By midyear, the Akron, Ohio-based company will have plans
for the exact structure of the new organization, which may
involve a reduction in employment, Goodyear said. "Changing
competitive conditions demand a more flexible and
customer-responsive organization," the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company established separate units to handle sales of
passenger car tires to consumers through independent dealers
and for sales to commercial accounts, such as truck and auto
fleets. The latter organization also will handle sales of
truck, farm and off-road tires through dealers.</p>
<p>Donald E. Salyers, formerly general manager sales, was
appointed vice president of the consumer division. H.J.
Wilson, formerly vice president Asia-Africa, was named vice
president commercial division.</p>
<p>And R.M. Morrison, who was general manager of the
company-owned retail operations, was promoted to vice
president.</p>
<p>All three will report to Louis DiPasqua, vice president
tire sales and marketing, Goodyear said.</p>
