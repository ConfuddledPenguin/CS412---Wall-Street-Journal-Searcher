	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Abbott Laboratories asked a court to dismiss
ousted chairman Robert Schoellhorn's lawsuit against the
company, calling it "a cry of wounded vanity" rather than a
legitimate complaint.
   Abbott's motion, filed Friday, capped a week in which the
company stepped up a vituperative counterattack against Mr.
Schoellhorn's charges that he was wrongfully dismissed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier in the week, Abbott alleged for the first time
that Mr. Schoellhorn violated his fiduciary obligations and
repeatedly defrauded the company during his lengthy tenure.
In addition, it officially fired Mr. Schoellhorn, after a
court modified the terms of a restraining order. Abbott,
based in North Chicago, is a pharmaceutical and
hospital-products concern.</p>
<p>The company took pains to disclose last week that Mr.
Schoellhorn, within days of being turned out as chairman, had
exercised 253,022 stock options, garnering what the company
said was a profit of $9.3 million. Still to be determined is
whether Mr. Schoellhorn must forfeit 51,600 shares of
restricted Abbott stock, which is valued at $3.5 million
based on Friday's closing price.</p>
<p>Abbott's latest filing says the lawsuit demonstrates Mr.
Schoellhorn's "inability to distinguish between his personal
interests and those of the corporation he was ostensibly
pledged to serve." A hearing is set for today; an immediate
ruling is thought unlikely.</p>
<p>In a remarkable suit filed last month, the 61-year-old Mr.
Schoellhorn claims the company forced him out at a December
board meeting he characterized as an "ambush." His complaint
alleges that a committee of outside board members misled him
through a "campaign of deception" that masked their
intentions to unseat him.</p>
<p>He asked the court to force Abbott to retain him as
chairman, or, failing that, to pay him undetermined damages
for breach of contract.</p>
<p>Cook County Circuit Court Judge Anthony Scotillo issued a
temporary restraining order last month, under which Abbott
was allowed to depose Mr. Schoellhorn as chairman but
required to maintain certain aspects of his employment
contract. The company had continued paying him, albeit at
half the $1.6 million rate he received last year.</p>
<p>Last week, Abbott said in court documents it had
discovered through an investigation, which began a month ago,
that "during much of the past decade Schoellhorn has
repeatedly misappropriated Abbott corporate assets for his
personal use" and committed fraudulent acts.</p>
<p>The documents contain, among other things, allegations
that Mr. Schoellhorn had on a number of occasions used the
company's corporate aircraft for "purely personal purposes,"
and then ordered subordinates to make "false entries" to
conceal the wrongdoing. It also claims he "submitted false
expense reports" and was reimbursed by the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Schoellhorn, in a response filed with the court,
denies all the charges, calling them "direct and overt
retaliation" to his suit.</p>
<p>Abbott said that Mr. Schoellhorn had been "terminated
without cause" Wednesday. The move cuts off his pay, and
deprives him of the office space he had been granted before
the judge relaxed part of the restraining order.</p>
<p>Although the board determined Mr. Schoellhorn's actions
constitute reason to terminate him "with cause," the court's
order doesn't permit that now. If the company eventually is
permitted to declare him fired with cause, he loses the right
to the restricted shares.</p>
<p>In a response to Abbott's filing earlier last week, Mr.
Schoellhorn's attorney, John H. Mathias Jr., said that an
Abbott attorney contacted him in late March and "announced
Abbott's intention to charge Mr. Schoellhorn publicly with
fraud, misappropriation and personal improprieties" unless he
dropped his suit and forfeited the restricted stock. "Counsel
for Abbott made other remarks that Mr. Schoellhorn could
avoid the personal humiliation that would follow from these
charges if he capitulated to Abbott's demands," Mr. Mathias
said in the response.</p>
<p>An Abbott spokesman denied the comments were made.</p>
