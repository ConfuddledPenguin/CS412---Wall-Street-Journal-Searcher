	<p class="article-leader">Ford Motor Co. and the Fiat Group of Italy confirmed they
are holding talks that could lead to world-wide arrangements
involving their tractor and farm equipment operations, while
preserving their product and market identities.
   The two companies also said they are exploring, in
separate discussions, possible areas of cooperation in the
heavy-truck business. Both companies said they have agreed
that no further announcement will be made until there are
definitive agreements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Friday's announcement followed reports that Dearborn,
Mich.-based Ford and Fiat are discussing the possible sale of
Ford's New Holland farm-equipment subsidiary to Fiat. Such a
sale would be consistent with Ford's recent strategy of
shedding non-automotive operations; for example, the auto
maker has put its aerospace unit up for sale.</p>
<p>Ford and Fiat are partners in the heavy-truck business in
Europe.</p>
