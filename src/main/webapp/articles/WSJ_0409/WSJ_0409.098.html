	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. appears headed for a tougher policy
toward the brutal regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Some administration officials argue privately that it's
time to abandon Washington's soft-glove approach to Iraq.
They want to put Baghdad on notice that the U.S. will tighten
the economic screws unless Iraq radically alters its
behavior, specifically by curtailing its efforts to develop
nuclear and chemical weapons.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The tougher stance is most evident in Congress, especially
the House, where a drive to impose economic sanctions already
is under way. The ever-cautious Bush administration will
oppose these efforts, White House officials say, because it
believes quiet diplomacy is more effective than legislation.
But even some administration Mideast analysts concede that
the U.S. has little to show for its attempts to prod Baghdad
toward moderation.</p>
<p>Arguments for a tougher policy were fueled by the recent
reports that Iraq tried to smuggle nuclear-bomb trigger
devices out of the U.S., and even more so by President
Hussein's threat to use chemical weapons against Israel if
his country is attacked.</p>
<p>In addition, an Iraqi-American was indicted Friday by a
federal grand jury in California for allegedly participating
in an Iraqi plot to kill two foes of the Iraqi government in
the U.S.</p>
<p>Recent concerns about Iraq were first aroused by a speech
Mr. Hussein delivered in Jordan in February. For the first
time since the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988, the Iraqi
president questioned the need for the continuing U.S. naval
presence in the Persian Gulf. Moderate Arab states told
Washington privately that they disagreed with that view, and
they voiced worries that the Iraqi leader was trying to give
himself a freer hand to dominate the region.</p>
<p>Before the Iran-Iraq war, Iraq regularly threatened its
neighbors. Kuwait faced Iraqi claims to part of its
territory; Jordan encountered pressure from Baghdad whenever
it became involved in efforts to achieve an
Israeli-Palestinian peace; and Saudi Arabia worried about the
vulnerability of its oil fields to the huge Iraqi military
machine to its north.</p>
<p>Iraq moderated its behavior and improved its relations
with the U.S. when it was bogged down in its war with Iran.
The U.S., in turn, softened its stance, and American policy
since then has been designed to keep Baghdad in the moderate
fold. But some analysts say the February speech signaled that
Mr. Hussein really hasn't altered his long-term intention to
dominate the region. These officials suggest that the mild
U.S. policy now may be jeopardizing Washington's Arab
friends.</p>
<p>While the accommodative U.S. policy appears to have
failed, there are reasons to believe that Saddam Hussein
could be vulnerable to increased U.S. pressure.</p>
<p>Iraq is trying to rebuild its war-torn economy and badly
needs Western help. Sanctions legislation proposed by Rep.
Howard Berman (D., Calif.) would deny the Iraq credit from
the U.S. Export-Import Bank, ban exports of items that could
have a military use and commit the U.S. to oppose any loan or
other assistance to it from international financial
institutions.</p>
<p>But the sanctions bill wouldn't ban agricultural credit
guarantees, even though farm sales are the bulk of U.S.
exports to Iraq. An aide to Rep. Berman says such a
restriction would make the bill unacceptable to grain-state
legislators. The aide argues that the bill, nevertheless,
would impede Iraq's rebuilding efforts.</p>
<p>Iraq also may be susceptible to pressure because it soon
could be involved in the kind of international dispute that
pushed it toward moderation in the past. Turkey is building a
dam on the Euphrates River, which supplies water further
downstream to Syria and Iraq. Turkey refuses to commit itself
to a water-sharing agreement, and Syria is a bitter enemy of
Baghdad. So water, the Middle East's most precious commodity,
could produce new tensions and put Iraq, once again, in need
of friends.</p>
<p>The U.S., meanwhile, may feel compelled to get tough with
Iraq to further its claim to a leadership role in a world of
resurgent democracies. U.S. allies who want to see that
happen could cite the State Department's own words. In its
report this year on human rights, the department calls Iraq's
record "abysmal." The report says that the country uses
torture and summary execution to deal with dissidents and
that freedoms of press, speech, assembly and association are
"virtually nonexistent" under Mr. Hussein's regime.</p>
