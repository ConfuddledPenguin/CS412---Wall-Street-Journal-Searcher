	<p class="article-leader">AMSTERDAM -- As Heineken N.V.'s mainstay beer markets in
the U.S. and Europe become saturated by its traditional
pilsner brand, the Dutch brewer is turning to new types of
beer and a restructuring of its operations to boost sales and
market share, the company said in its annual report.
   However, despite the changes, the Dutch brewer issued only
a cautious forecast for 1990.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We take a positive view with regard to the long-term
profit growth. . . . At the present moment, however, it is
not possible to express a well-founded expectation regarding
the results for the current financial year," Heineken said.</p>
<p>The forecast comes after a relatively strong year in 1989,
when net income rose nearly 12% to 325 million guilders
($169.8 million) from 291 million guilders a year earlier.</p>
<p>Heineken said its move to new varieties of beer reflects
changes in demand and changes in the social attitude toward
alcohol consumption in general.</p>
<p>"The beer market is affected by a number of different
social developments, such as increasing individualization on
the part of the consumer . . . and reflection about the use
of alcohol," Heineken said.</p>
<p>The response by Heineken is to offer more varieties of
beer, especially low or no alcohol beers. A Heineken
representative confirmed in March that the Dutch brewer is
aiming to introduce two beers a year, with the first new beer
in 1990 scheduled to come out this summer. However, the
representative declined to say what type of beer it will be.</p>
<p>This isn't to say that Heineken is giving up on its most
popular pilsner brand of beer. Pilsner sales continued to
maintain Heineken's third-place position in the global beer
market and its leading position in the European market,
according to the company.</p>
<p>In fact, global beer sales at Heineken last year rose 6.8%
to 6.419 billion guilders from 6.008 billion guilders in
1988. However, its global soft-drink sales rose at an even
faster clip of nearly 15%, to 811 million guilders in 1989
from 707 million guilders in 1988.</p>
<p>These two sales figures accounted for the majority of the
brewer's total 1989 turnover of 7.820 billion guilders, with
hard liquor, wine and other revenue making up the rest.</p>
<p>As the 1992 goal of an integrated European market comes
closer, Heineken said it will study restructuring its
operations to fit a Pan-European market.</p>
<p>"Heineken has for a number of years been active in
numerous important markets in Europe. We are accordingly
studying whether the future situation in Europe should also
have consequences for the organization of our production
activities, the logistical structure and our marketing,"
Heineken said.</p>
<p>Some of the these changes have already been apparent.</p>
<p>Heineken attempted to implement a restructuring plan for
its Dutch operations earlier this year but was blocked by
strikes. The company said it will again attempt a
restructuring after consultations with its labor unions.</p>
<p>Also in response to 1992, Heineken said in March that it
would switch its European advertising account to J. Walter
Thompson of the U.S. Prior to this, Heineken used individual
ad agencies in its separate European markets.</p>
<p>By geographic region, Heineken's 1989 sales and earnings
from its mainstay product, beer, were improved overall, but
there were important exceptions.</p>
<p>In Europe, Heineken's most important market, beer sales
are showing signs of flagging with a rise of only 4.4% from
1988. In addition, Heineken attributed part of the growth to
unusually warm weather last summer.</p>
<p>In its largest European market, the Netherlands, the trend
to a more fragmented market was apparent. Sales of Heineken's
traditional pilsner brand decreased, but the Dutch brewer was
able to boost its overall market share through its purchase
of Koninklijke Brand Bierbrouwerij B.V., a specialty beer
producer that had a 4% market share. Adding to its sales,
Heineken also introduced its Dry 100 beer, and boosted the
sales of its Ridder beer.</p>
<p>However, competition also became more intense, resulting
in higher costs and decreased margins, Heineken said.
Earnings rose through its increased sales.</p>
<p>Although per-capita consumption of beer in the Netherlands
increased in 1989, this was due at least in part to the
weather. In several recent years, per-capita consumption of
beer has been steadily declining and consumption of normal
alcohol beers, such as its pilsner brand, as part of that
consumption is also down.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Heineken's sales were hit by a weaker dollar,
a decrease in the popularity of imported beers and more
competition from specialty beers from the small U.S.
breweries. Although Heineken gave no indication what effect
this had on its earnings, the company did note that while its
overall sales in the U.S. declined, it maintained its leading
position in the imported beer market.</p>
<p>In Canada, both earnings and sales from its Heineken and
Amstel brands were lower after Heineken's market was hit by
increased competition from lower-priced U.S. imports and from
Canadian breweries.</p>
<p>Heineken chalked up gains in the Caribbean and Latin
American markets despite problems stemming from political
instability in several markets, inflation, and Hurricane
Hugo, which disrupted some Caribbean economies.</p>
<p>Despite these problems, sales in the Caribbean and Latin
America increased enough to offset the depressed market
conditions in North America. The results were that overall
sales in the Western Hemisphere showed the most rapid growth
of all of Heineken's major market areas by rising 12%.</p>
<p>In Africa, Heineken's third-largest market, beer sales
declined 1.5% as economic difficulties cut consumption in
several countries. Also disrupting operations in Africa were
more stringent restrictions for obtaining the foreign
currencies needed for raw materials, machinery and spare
parts.</p>
<p>In Australia, Asia and Oceania, Heineken's smallest market
area, overall sales grew 7.7%. However, on a
country-by-country basis, the results were mixed with sales
and earnings improving in Malaysia, Singapore and New
Zealand. Competition cut market share and sales in Australia,
while the political crackdown in China curtailed operations
there.</p>
<p>In Japan, Heineken's sales dropped, and as a result, the
brewer decided to restructure its operations there by
incorporating marketing and sales efforts into a single
operation.</p>
