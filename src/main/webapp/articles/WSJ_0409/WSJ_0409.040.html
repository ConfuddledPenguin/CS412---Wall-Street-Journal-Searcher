	<p class="article-leader">U S WEST Inc. (Denver) -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it
lowered its senior debt ratings of three U S West units --
BetaWest Properties, U S West Capital Funding Inc. and U S
West Financial Services -- from A-plus to double-A-minus. S&P
also downgraded the senior debt ratings of U S West
Communications Group to double-A-minus from double-A. S&P
affirmed U S West Capital Funding's commercial paper at
A1-plus and U S West Communications Group's commercial paper
at A1-plus. S&P said the change reflects 1989 consolidated
debt leverage of 51.8% of total capitalization, of which
about 53% consists of U S West Communications debt
obligations. Moreover, S&P said U S West has been
diversifying into higher-risk ventures, such as financial
services and cellular telephone. S&P also attributed the
downgrade to increasing business risk in the company's
telephone service areas, which the rating firm said hadn't
been offset by improved financial support for credit.</p>
