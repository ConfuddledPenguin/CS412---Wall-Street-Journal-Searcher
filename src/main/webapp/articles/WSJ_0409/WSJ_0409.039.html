	<p class="article-leader">Analyst projections that Valmont Industries Inc. will
report per-share net income in the range of 33 cents to 36
cents for its first quarter, ended April 1, represent a "fair
estimate," William F. Welsh II, president and chief executive
officer, said.
   Those results would equal or fall slightly below the
Omaha, Neb., company's year-ago net of $4.2 million, or 36
cents a share, on revenue of $189.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Valmont makes irrigation systems, industrial products
including steel poles and tubing, and additionally holds an
82% stake in ValCom Inc., a reseller of personal computers.</p>
<p>The company's irrigation business will have an "excellent
year" in 1990, but "not quite as strong" as it has been in
the past couple of years, when drought conditions spurred
sales in the Farm Belt, Mr. Welsh said in an interview. The
improved health of the general farm economy this year, he
said, will help offset the absence of a "drought situation."
Domestic demand remains "strong," he said, adding that the
company's export market -- which covers some 70 nations -- is
also "quite good."</p>
