	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- First Interstate Bancorp said its unit,
First Interstate Bank of California, has secured licenses for
employees at 12 branches to begin selling annuities.
   First Interstate is entering the insurance market, after
Proposition 103, a voter initiative, allowed California banks
to directly sell insurance products. The bank holding concern
said it has reached an agreement with Essex Corp., a New York
independent third-party vendor of annuities, under which
Essex will train bank employees to sell the products, and
provide marketing support.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>First Interstate said it expects to be selling annuities
in 65 more branches by the end of the year. First
Interstate's fixed-rate annuities are interest-earning
insurance contracts, marketed at customers over 50 years old,
and are intended to supplement retirement income.</p>
