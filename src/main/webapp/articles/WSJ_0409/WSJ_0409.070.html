	<div class="article-body"><p>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is the most unpopular
British leader since the Gallup Organization began polling
more than 50 years ago, according to a new Gallup survey.</p>
<p>The opposition Labor Party, with a massive 52.5% support,
now holds a record 24.5 point lead over Mrs. Thatcher's
Conservative Party, the survey indicated.</p>
<p>Battered by economic troubles and a backlash against an
unpopular new local government tax levied on almost all
voters, Mrs. Thatcher's ratings have been declining for
nearly a year. The Gallup poll, published in London's
pro-Conservative Daily Telegraph, showed only 24% of voters
questioned approve of the prime minister's performance.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thatcher's rating outstrips the Gallup unpopularity
ratings of other British leaders in their darkest times. In
May 1940, Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, his policy of
appeasing Hitler a failure and Britain in danger of a Nazi
invasion, recorded 32% support.</p>
<p>EAST EUROPE'S PRICE CONTROLS</p>
<p>The preferable path to economic reform in Eastern European
countries would be through removal of price controls in one
quick stroke, said Gyoergy Szapary, the International
Monetary Fund's chief representative in Hungary. "The
problems associated with the transition are daunting," he
said, adding that "people's expectations for dramatic
improvements in availability of goods have increased
sharply." He warned, however, that immediate removal of all
price controls could trigger dangerous inflation.</p>
<p>A CAPITAL FOR UNITED GERMANY</p>
<p>Most West Germans would like to see Berlin, not Bonn, as
capital of a united Germany, according to a survey conducted
for the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. Nearly 52%
of 1,000 West Germans questioned last month favored Berlin as
the capital while 26% preferred Bonn. The survey said the
Bonn supporters were mostly among the young generation while
older people generally favored Berlin, capital of the former
German Reich. About 20% of those questioned were undecided.</p>
<p>EC STUDIES FOOD POISONING</p>
<p>Food poisoning is massively underreported throughout the
European Community, according to a study by EC researchers.
Looking into occurrences of poisoning from salmonella and
botulism, the researchers found that illnesses fre quently
stemmed from dirty kitchens. "Dishcloths are teeming with
salmonella," said Paul Gray, senior EC official in charge of
food policy. "My grandmother used to boil them every day."</p>
<p>CENTRAL AMERICAN PATROL BOATS</p>
<p>The United Nations accepted an Argentine offer to provide
four patrol boats and their crews to help monitor irregular
cross-border movements in Central America. The boats will
serve in the Gulf of Fonseca, between Nicaragua, Honduras and
El Salvador, as part of the U.N. Observer Group in Central
America. The group was set up last November to check on the
cross-border movement of arms and men to irregular forces
operating in the region.</p>
<p>WHAT ROMANIA NEEDS</p>
<p>Romania needs $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year in foreign
aid, investment and export credits to modernize its
infrastructure and rebuild its economy, a top economist said.
Eugen Dijmarescu, the head of a commission formed to set
priorities for foreign aid and investment, said emergency aid
in the form of medical supplies, food, clothing and fodder is
still essential almost four months after the revolution that
toppled dictator Nicolae Ceaucescu. He said Romania hopes to
move swiftly from emergency aid to investment and credits
that would rebuild the economy.</p>
<p>LIFE AND DEATH</p>
<p>Japan is at the top of rankings of life expectancy in 33
developed nations, according to new figures from the Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta.</p>
<p>The average life expectancy in Japan is 79.1 years, 4.1
years ahead of the U.S. figure of 75.0 years; the lowest of
the 33 was Hungary, where the average citizen lives 69.7
years. Japan was also best among the 33 nations in death
rates from all causes, with 628.8 deaths for each 100,000
people each year. The U.S. ranked near the middle, with 828.4
deaths, and Romania was worst, at 1,242.</p>
<p>On average in the 33 countries, heart disease accounted
for 30% of deaths, with cancer causing 21% and stroke causing
14%. Fourteen percent of deaths in the 33 countries -- about
1.5 million a year -- are attributed to smoking, the CDC
said.</p>
<p>Fewer Americans smoke, compared with the other countries;
31% of U.S. males and 26% of American females smoke, compared
with 41% of men and 29% of women in the other countries.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>John McCleery, from Floreat, Western Australia, will
celebrate his 103rd birthday at Turkey's Gallipoli
battlefield on April 25 during ceremonies marking the 75th
anniversary of the epic World War I campaign. He landed at
Gallipoli on April 25, 1915 -- his 28th birthday. . . . The
Japanese government pardoned two men convicted of attempted
murder -- the final two of more than 10 million pardons
issued to commemorate Emperor Hirohito's death in January
1989. Most of the pardons were for minor offenses such as
traffic violations.</p>
