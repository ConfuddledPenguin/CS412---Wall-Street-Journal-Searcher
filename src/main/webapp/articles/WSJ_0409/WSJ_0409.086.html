	<p class="article-leader">Genentech Inc. won a major victory for its flagship
product, TPA, when a jury found that the Wellcome Foundation
and Genetics Institute Inc. infringed on three Genentech
patents.
   The jury also denied antitrust claims filed by Wellcome
against Genentech and a claim by Genetics Institute of unfair
competition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>TPA is a blood clot-dissolving drug used in the treatment
of heart attacks. Genentech said it plans to file for an
injunction to prevent London-based Wellcome PLC from
marketing its own form of TPA, called Duteplase, and to
prevent Genetics Institute from marketing its
second-generation version of TPA in the U.S.</p>
<p>"The victory was as complete as it could be," said Stephen
Raines, Genentech's vice president of intellectual property.
The jury, however, didn't award any monetary damages to
Genentech, which is based in South San Francisco, Calif.</p>
<p>Mr. Raines said the jury's verdict shows Genentech holds
"exceedingly broad patents" for TPA and predicted the
decision would "have a chilling effect on companies that want
to take a patented product and try to market it after making
minor revisions."</p>
<p>Martin Sherwood, a Wellcome spokesman, said the company is
still reviewing the decision, reached Friday in U.S. District
Court in Delaware. He noted that a 1987 decision by British
courts, later upheld on appeal, "deemed a Genentech patent
invalid for essentially the same compound and processes." The
U.S. decision "is therefore the opposite of the U.K.
decision, and we'll have to consider whether to appeal."</p>
<p>Genetics Institute officials couldn't be reached for
comment yesterday.</p>
<p>Genentech, which spent five years and $200 million
developing TPA, began marketing the drug -- which it sells
under the brand name Activase -- in 1987. The next year,
Genentech brought a patent infringement suit against Wellcome
and its subsidiaries, including Burroughs-Wellcome, and
against its U.S. collaborator, Genetics Institute. Wellcome
responded with an antitrust action against Genentech;
Genetics Institute, of Cambridge, Mass., filed an unfair
competition suit against Genentech.</p>
<p>Genentech's sales of TPA in 1989 grew 30%, to $196.4
million. But the outlook for TPA this year is clouded by
competition from a recently approved drug -- called Eminase
-- from SmithKline Beecham PLC, and a study last month which
found that Hoechst AG's streptokinase, an older, much less
expensive treatment, prolongs life as well as TPA.</p>
<p>Wellcome is best known for its AIDS drug, AZT.</p>
<p>Genentech, a biotechnology concern, recently agreed to
sell a 60% stake to Roche Holding Inc. of Switzerland for
$2.1 billion.</p>
<p>In composite trading Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Genentech closed unchanged at $26. In national
over-the-counter trading, Genetics Institute fell 25 cents to
$37.75.</p>
