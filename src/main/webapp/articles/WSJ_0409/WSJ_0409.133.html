	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar is expected to continue its climb
against the yen, despite any turbulent trading that may be
ahead.
   Any profit-taking and central-bank intervention that may
occur probably wouldn't be enough to knock the dollar off
course, currency analysts say. They cite skepticism about the
new trade accord between the U.S. and Japan and low
confidence in Japan's financial markets as influences working
on the dollar's behalf.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"To stay cautiously long dollars" is how many traders may
try to play the market, says David Lapin, national
foreign-exchange sales manager at Bank of America, Los
Angeles. "We're still looking for a stronger dollar."</p>
<p>In late afternoon New York trading Friday, the dollar was
at 157.65 yen, up from 157.40 late Thursday. But the dollar
was below the 39-month high of 160.30 yen it reached Monday
before retreating on profit-taking before this weekend's
Group of Seven meeting of major industrial nations in Paris.
G-7 nations include the U.S., Japan, Britain, West Germany,
France, Italy and Canada.</p>
<p>In early trading Monday, the dollar briefly sank below 156
yen, responding to optimistic Japanese news coverage about
the G-7 meeting. The dollar later regained some ground and
closed Tokyo's morning session at 156.70.</p>
<p>The dollar traded at 1.6950 marks late Friday, off from
1.6995 marks. Sterling was at $1.6425, slightly higher than
$1.6422 late Thursday.</p>
<p>Because of the yen's incessant weakness during the past 15
months, the dollar's relationship to the Japanese currency
has become the primary concern of the foreign-exchange market
and global-monetary officials. While the dollar has soared
against the yen recently, it has barely budged against the
mark and other major foreign currencies.</p>
<p>Since February 1987, market participants have believed
that the G-7 is content when the dollar is in a trading range
of 120 to 140 yen, a band that would foster stable exchange
rates and help diminish inflationary pressures and trade
imbalances in the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p>Another round of profit-taking could hit the dollar if it
surges to 160 yen, and central banks may fight to keep it
from soaring above that level with more concerted sales, some
traders say.</p>
<p>Even so, the dollar's uptrend isn't seen crumbling anytime
soon.</p>
<p>Traders are still on the lookout for "the best place to
buy" whenever the dollar slips, says Takaharu Fukawa, a
treasury officer at Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co.</p>
<p>There were some suspicions that the dollar would come
under pressure as soon as the U.S. and Japan hammered out an
agreement to solve their sticky trade problems. But that
probably won't be the case, even though U.S. criticism of
Japan is abating.</p>
<p>U.S. and Japanese officals agreed on a tentative plan
Thursday, the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative,
that aims to topple trade barriers in Japan and help the U.S.
compete more in that nation's markets. But until the
agreement is completed and Japan is out of political hot
water with the U.S., the trade accord probably won't be used
as an excuse to sell dollars, some currency analysts say.</p>
<p>External and internal pressures on Japan to fix its trade
imbalance contributed to the lessening of confidence in that
nation and the battering of the yen.</p>
<p>"I don't see any reason for a sea change in sentiment"
because trade relations between the U.S. and Japan are
warming, says Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High
Frequency Economics Ltd., an international economic-research
firm in New York.</p>
<p>The U.S. trade deficit with Japan, the largest with any
single country, contracted to $2.86 billion in January from
$3.49 billion in December. Last year, the total shortfall was
$49 billion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the battery of bearish yen fundamentals is
expected to keep the stronger dollar's motor running.</p>
<p>Capital continues to leak out of Japan, where the stock
and bond markets have been in turmoil for months; interest
rates remain relatively low, and land prices are
astronomically high. "There's no real good place to put money
in Japan right now," says Mr. Weinberg.</p>
<p>Despite the growing belief that Japanese investors will
have a big appetite for European investments this year, any
diversification of portfolios probably won't be very
detrimental to the dollar, Mr. Weinberg contends.</p>
<p>There is a "growing pie" of Japanese capital, he says,
adding that the slice for the U.S. should be enough to keep
the dollar "comfortable" at high levels.</p>
<p>But despite the dollar's impressive 11% rise against the
yen so far this year, there remains an undercurrent of doubt
among some traders about the potential of the currency to
climb in the near term.</p>
<p>"I think we're going to have temporary dollar weakness,"
says Christiane Mandell, a trader at Security Pacific
Merchant Bank in Los Angeles. The dollar, she says, may head
toward 150 yen soon.</p>
<p>On New York's Commodity Exchange Friday, current-delivery
gold settled at $380.70 an ounce, up $5.90. Estimated volume
was a moderate 2.6 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, gold opened Monday at $380.10 an ounce.</p>
