	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said
the U.S. and Czechoslovakia reached a bilateral trade
agreement that will be signed Thursday.
   Mrs. Hills said the agreement clears the way for each
government to lower its tariff rates for imports from the
other country, by offering "most favored nation" tariff
treatment under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, or GATT.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mrs. Hills said Czechoslovakia will extend "national
treatment" to U.S. companies that establish bank accounts and
pay for goods within that country and will permit U.S.
companies to repatriate hard currency earnings from trade
without any delays. Czechoslovakia also agreed to strengthen
its system protecting patents, copyrights and other
intellectual property rights.</p>
