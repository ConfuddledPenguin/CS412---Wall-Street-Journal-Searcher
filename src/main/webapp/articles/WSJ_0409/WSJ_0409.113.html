	<p class="article-leader">Jury selection begins today in the child-molestation
retrial of Raymond Buckey, the former California preschool
teacher whose first criminal trial was the longest and
costliest in U.S. history.
   Mr. Buckey, who was indicted in March 1984, will be tried
on eight counts of child molestation involving three girls
who were once pupils at the now-defunct Virginia McMartin
Preschool in the upscale California community of Manhattan
Beach.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier this year, after nearly three months of
deliberations in the 28-month trial, a jury in Los Angeles
Superior Court acquitted Mr. Buckey and his 63-year-old
mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, on 52 out of 65 counts of
child molestation. But Mr. Buckey's victory was cut short by
the prosecution's decision to retry the remaining 13 counts
on which the jurors had become hopelessly deadlocked. Since
then five of the unresolved counts have been dismissed.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles district attorney alleged that from 1978
to 1983, Mr. Buckey, the grandson of the school's founder,
and Mrs. Buckey, the school's director, molested 11
youngsters at the once-prestigious school. The children also
accused their former teachers of a litany of horrific
misdeeds including satanic rituals, child-pornography rings
and animal mutilations.</p>
<p>Mr. Buckey, 31, has steadfastly proclaimed his innocence.
His lawyer, Danny Davis, has argued that the case grew out of
mass hysteria resembling the Salem witch hunts of 1692. If
convicted, Mr. Buckey, who has spent nearly five years in
prison, faces a maximum 15-year prison term. A representative
of the Los Angeles district attorney said time served would
likely be subtracted as time and a half.</p>
<p>Jury selection is expected to take at least a month
because of the difficulty of finding individuals who aren't
opinionated about the case. The trial is expected to take at
least six months.</p>

<p>IMELDA MARCOS ASKS JUDGE to lift her bail restrictions.</p>
<p>Benjamin Cassiday, an attorney for Mrs. Marcos, told U.S.
Judge John Keenan that she wants to return to the Philippines
for the deposition of defense witnesses.</p>
<p>He also said he will seek a deposition from Corazon
Aquino, who became president of the Philippines in early 1986
after Mrs. Marcos's husband, the late Ferdinand Marcos, was
ousted from power. The deposition is necessary, the lawyer
stated in an affidavit, to authenticate a taped radio
broadcast in which Mrs. Aquino said she directed the former
U.S. ambassador to the Philippines to remove the Marcoses
from that country.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marcos, whose trial began last month, is charged with
stealing more than $160 million from the Philippines and
concealing most of the money through real-estate purchases in
the U.S. She has sought to have her trial in federal court in
New York thrown out on the grounds that she was brought to
the U.S. against her will during the revolution that brought
President Aquino to power. Judge Keenan previously rejected
that claim. Federal prosecutors say Mrs. Marcos came to the
U.S. voluntarily.</p>
<p>In his affidavit, Mr. Cassiday, who was in the Philippines
last month, said a "general atmosphere of intimidation in the
Philippines" makes it impossible for many potential defense
witnesses to come to the U.S. to testify. "Every witness that
I interviewed demonstrated . . . that he or she was
intimidated by the combined power of the Aquino
administration in the Philippines and the U.S. government,"
he said in the affidavit. "As a result of this pervasive fear
it was necessary for me to change hotel rooms repeatedly so
that witnesses that I interviewed couldn't be identified by
Filipino government agents."</p>
<p>Potential witnesses say they believe they may be jailed by
the U.S. or that the Aquino administration won't permit them
to return home if they come to the U.S. to testify, Mr.
Cassiday wrote.</p>

<p>WINDMERE WINS $30 million judgment from N.V. Philips.</p>
<p>After a six-year battle, Windmere Corp. won the judgment,
which will be trebled, in antitrust litigation involving
Philip's Norelco shavers. The award was made Friday in U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Florida.</p>
<p>In 1984, Dutch-based Philips and its North American
Philips Corp. unit sued Windmere, a personal-care-products
maker in Miami Lakes, Fla., and one of its suppliers. Philips
alleged unfair competition and patent infringement related to
Windmere's rotary electric shaver.</p>
<p>Windmere filed a counterclaim alleging that Philips drove
it out of the three-head rotary-shaver market by offering 35%
to 40% discounts on old models of its Norelco shaver,
underselling Windmere by 25% to 30%. Windmere, represented by
the Chicago law firm of Winston & Strawn, said it suffered
damages of between $13 million and $39 million and abandoned
the market as a result. U.S. officials of Philips and lawyers
at Sullivan & Cromwell, the New York law firm representing
the company, couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Upon hearing the verdict, David M. Friedson, Windmere
president and chief executive officer, sent employees home
early Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>ARBITRAGERS CONVICTED of insider-trading charges.</p>
<p>A federal jury in New York convicted Wall Street
arbitrager Victor Teicher and Ross Frankel, former head of
arbitrage research at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The two
were implicated in the "Yuppie Five" case in 1986 in which
five young Wall Street professionals were charged with
trading on inside information about corporate-takeover plans.</p>
<p>Mr. Teicher, 38, and his securities firm, Victor Teicher &
Co., were convicted of one count of conspiracy and eleven
counts of securities fraud. Mr. Teicher also was convicted of
two counts of mail fraud.</p>
<p>Mr. Frankel, 33, was convicted of one count of conspiracy,
one count of securities fraud, one count of mail fraud, one
count of perjury and two counts of obstruction of justice.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the defendants said they would appeal.</p>
<p>The defendants each face maximum fines of $250,000 on each
count and substantial prison sentences. The Teicher firm
could be fined a maximum of $500,000 on each count.</p>
<p>The trial was the second half of a case that also included
as defendants Marcus Schloss & Co. and Ronald Yagoda,
formerly head of the arbitrage-trading room at Marcus
Schloss. In July, the New York arbitrage firm was convicted
of two insider-trading related charges and Mr. Yagoda was
acquitted.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission last week settled
its civil charges against Mr. Yagoda. That settlement
includes an unusual provision for Mr. Yagoda, who didn't
admit any wrongdoing: After a one-year suspension from the
securities industry, he will have to keep a log for three
years recording all communications he has about any companies
in which he trades or causes trading.</p>
<p>The log will be available to the SEC for review.</p>
