	<p class="article-leader">The pharmaceutical industry is expected to report profit
growth of about 15% in the first quarter, reflecting
continued strong sales of leading products and the benefits
of a harsh flu season.
   Revenue growth generally was only in the high single
digits, indicating profits are advancing with the help of
cost-cutting and the success of high-margin products,
analysts said. The industry's performance was somewhat
tempered, they added, by comparison with a strong first
quarter a year ago, and by a strong dollar in Japan, an
important market for most major drug companies, particularly
Merck & Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unfavorable currency translations could depress results
during the rest of the year, especially if the dollar rallies
in Europe. And sales will be hurt when Japan imposes a 9.2%
across-the-board cut in drug prices this month.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, analysts expect the industry's strong
performance to continue in the rest of 1990, aided by
comparisons with weaker quarters. Ronald Nordmann, an analyst
at PaineWebber Inc., sees an 18% increase in industrywide
earnings for 1990 from 1989. Richard Vietor, drug industry
analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co., forecasts 16% annual growth.</p>
<p>Merck, long the leading performer, faltered slightly, with
profit estimated at 15% to 18% above the $340.4 million, or
86 cents a share, reported in the 1989 first period, analysts
say. In comparison, rivals Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.,
Warner-Lambert Co. and Eli Lilly & Co., are expected to post
gains of at least 18%.</p>
<p>"If there was a company we might be a little nervous
about, it would be Merck," Mr. Vietor says. "Merck probably
has the most exposure to Japan and has been accelerating
spending as they have been bringing on a new sales force. But
we're still talking about a 15% increase." Marc Mayer,
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. sees Merck as having
had a 17%-18% quarter. In Rahway, N.J., Merck said it doesn't
comment on analyst projections.</p>
<p>Lilly is expected to post a 20% rise in profit, from
$284.7 million, or 99 cents a share, adjusted for a stock
split a year earlier. The company's profits were driven by
brisk sales of its anti-depressant drug Prozac, plus growth
in its catheter business, which was bolstered when a
competitor had to withdraw its catheter products from the
market. "Everything seems to be going Lilly's way right now,"
Mr. Mayer says. Lilly, based in Indianapolis, declined to
comment.</p>
<p>Analysts said the October merger at Bristol Myers Squibb
Co. brought cost savings that contributed to probably an 18%
profit increase, as compared with the earnings of Bristol
Myers and Squibb. On a pro forma basis, the two companies had
year-ago first-quarter profit of $344 million, or 66 cents a
share. Sales of Capoten, a drug for blood pressure and
congestive heart failure, helped fuel growth. The New
Yorkbased company declined to comment.</p>
<p>Warner-Lambert said its first-quarter earnings would rise
about 20% from the $101.1 million, or $1.49 a share, a year
earlier. The results were driven by strong sales of its
anti-convulsant Dilantin and its Lopid cholesterol drug, as
well as by demand for flu products. The company said it was
on target for at least 15% to 16% earnings growth for the
current year.</p>
<p>Schering-Plough Corp., Madison, N.J., said it is
"comfortable" with analysts' first-quarter profit estimates
of $1.30 to $1.33 a share, an increase of 16% to 19% from
last year's $125.7 million, or $1.12 a share.</p>
<p>American Home Products Co. earnings look to be up about
11% from $263.8 million, or $1.80 a share, a year earlier,
according to Mr. Nordmann. American Home wouldn't comment.</p>
<p>Trailing the pack are Upjohn Co. and Pfizer Inc. "Upjohn
is underperforming its peers because of continued softness in
its major line of tranquilizers and sedatives," Mr. Nordmann
said. These include the prescription drugs Xanax and Halcion.
Upjohn, Kalamazoo, Mich., is expected to report that profit
rose about 7% from the year-earlier $103.0 million, or 56
cents a share.</p>
<p>Analysts see Pfizer reporting a flat first quarter, with
the aid of a 13-cent-a-share gain from the previously
announced sale of a unit. "Pfizer has a very good new product
flow," Mr. Mayer says, and Procardia XL, a sustained-release
version of its Procardia heart drug, is doing well. But the
company is spending heavily for marketing and research. A
year ago, New York-based Pfizer earned $240.8 million, or
$1.43 a share. Pfizer declined to comment.</p>
