	<p class="article-leader">SCOTTS VALLEY, Calif. -- Seagate Technology Inc. said it
received a statutory notice from the Internal Revenue Service
that it may owe up to $112 million in taxes.
   The maker of disk drives said it was notified of a
"possible deficiency" for the taxable years 1981 to 1987.
Seagate said it believes it has "meritorious defenses" to the
IRS adjustments. The company said it is preparing a petition
to the U.S. Tax Court.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Seagate said it believes the likely outcome of the
litigation won't have a material effect on its financial
position.</p>
<p>A Seagate spokeswoman said the company wouldn't explain
why the government believes it owes the money. "There isn't
anything further I can say. We have no comment beyond the
press release. That's all the information that's available."</p>
<p>In the six months ended Dec. 31, Seagate had net income of
$59.2 million, or $1.03 a share, on revenue of $1.07 billion.</p>
<p>The dispute is believed to involve how Seagate accounts
for its profits from overseas operations. Seagate has
manufacturing facilities in Asia, and can increase and
possibly defer overseas profits depending on the prices it
charges its domestic units for overseas production.</p>
