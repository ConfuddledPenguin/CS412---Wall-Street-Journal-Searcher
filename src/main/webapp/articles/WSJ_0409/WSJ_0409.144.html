	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- With just seven weeks to go before the May
30 U.S.-Soviet summit meeting and superpower relations
strained by the Lithuania crisis, the two sides will have to
struggle to settle the major arms-control issues they have
pledged to resolve by that conference.
   During three days of preparatory meetings here last week
between Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, little progress was made on
important strategic-arms differences that are supposed to be
overcome by the summit. Indeed, U.S. officials privately
complain that Soviet negotiators, especially those from the
military, appeared to backslide on some commitments the U.S.
thought it had won at the Baker-Shevardnadze meeting in
Moscow in February.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Soviet officials also continued to express strong
opposition to a united Germany's membership in the Western
alliance. They conceded that neutrality for Germany isn't the
only solution, but openly admitted they had no alternative
proposal for the status of Germany, leaving that issue also
in the air as the two German states race toward unification.</p>
<p>But the U.S. added to the negotiators' task by floating a
new plan to eliminate some or all land-based multiple warhead
missiles in favor of less-dangerous single-warhead models.
Some elements of the ban might be included in this year's
proposed treaty, officials indicated, while others might
await a follow-up agreement. But the Soviets were cool to the
suggestion, which strongly favors the U.S. because most
American missile warheads are based on submarines, not land.
Yuriy Nazarkin, the chief Soviet strategic-arms negotiator,
publicly said such a complex new plan couldn't be worked out
in just seven weeks.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker will fly to Moscow May 16 for another round of
pre-summit meetings to try and bridge the gaps. Unless that
session succeeds, the summit could come up short of the most
important goal set for it by President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev when they last met on Malta in
December: resolution of all the major issues leading to the
signing of a strategic arms reduction treaty, called Start.</p>
<p>The internal Soviet crisis over Lithuania's bid for
independence has placed a chill over the whole U.S.-Soviet
relationship, which has been remarkably smooth for about a
year. The Bush administration has been forced to warn the
Soviets that any drastic crackdown there would disrupt
superpower ties. Moscow has been preoccupied with Lithuania
and anxious to look tough, just when full attention and a
willingness to compromise are required for pre-summit deal
making.</p>
<p>Several senior State Department officials who participated
in the meetings last week said they had the strong feeling
that top Soviet officials, including Messrs. Shevardnadze and
Gorbachev, have been so distracted by the Lithuanian
challenge that they aren't imposing sufficient pressure on
lower-level bargainers to reach compromises. In addition,
they said they sensed a new resistance to compromise by
military officials, which they speculated might reflect a
cooling of relations between Mr. Gorbachev and the military
leadership.</p>
<p>Anxious to remove Lithuania as an obstacle to superpower
progress, the U.S. has decided for now to limit itself to
stern warnings against further armed intervention there. It
continued to press for the summit and for superpower
agreements. Mr. Shevardnadze hailed the American
business-as-usual attitude, saying "when two powers, such as
the Soviet Union and the United States, continue to expand
their cooperation, even at a more difficult juncture, the
world breathes more quietly."</p>
<p>Mr. Baker and President Bush urged Mr. Shevardnadze to end
the crisis by holding a referendum in Lithuania on
independence and then negotiating a peaceful economic and
territorial separation if it passes. Those proposals sound
similar to key portions of Mr. Gorbachev's proposed new
secession law and would be a much slower route to
independence than Lithuania's new non-communist leaders
originally hoped to take.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker denied the U.S. was siding with Moscow in the
dispute, and said Lithuanian leaders, under Soviet armed
pressure, have said they might accept a referendum and
lengthy talks rather than insisting that their March 11
declaration of independence was the last word on the issue.</p>
<p>But the impact of the Lithuania crisis pervaded last
week's meetings, especially on the Soviet side. The lack of
focus by top Soviet leaders was evident beyond armscontrol
matters, U.S. officials said, and showed itself on political
and economic issues.</p>
<p>On the issue of a unified Germany, the Americans found the
Soviet position confused. Mr. Shevardnadze privately
concedes, they said, that neutrality isn't the only possible
status for Germany.</p>
<p>But, at a news conference after the meetings, the Soviet
foreign minister continued to praise the longstanding Soviet
demand for a "neutral and demilitarized Germany" and strongly
rejected as "one-sided" the U.S. demand that the new Germany
belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. He welcomed
alternative suggestions, but said, "I have no specific
answers or proposals at this point in time."</p>
<p>Two vague ideas mentioned by Mr. Shevardnadze as worthy of
study have both been rejected in the West. One, a proposal
that Germany belong to NATO and the Warsaw Pact, was
dismissed by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl after a
meeting with President Bush in February. The other, a hazy
notion gaining popularity across Europe for a new security
alliance to replace both military pacts, was rejected by Mr.
Baker Friday as a threat to NATO.</p>
<p>On economic issues, Soviet specialists confirmed during
the talks news reports that Mr. Gorbachev hopes to have ready
a radical economic program, including price and currency
reforms, by the time of the next Communist Party Congress
July 2. But the Soviets were vague about how far the package
would go and whether it would survive political attacks. The
Soviets also weren't able to guarantee passage by May 30 of a
liberalized emigration law, the key condition for waiving of
U.S. trade restrictions at the summit.</p>
<p>The U.S. call for a new move against multiple-warhead
missiles is partly designed to assuage Senate Armed Services
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), who has insisted the
Bush administration pursue such curbs if it wants new missile
funding. In addition, it appears aimed at avoiding the
growing impression that the Start treaty won't drastically
cut nuclear weapons stockpiles.</p>
<p>But the American plan is heavily tilted towards U.S.
interests. It would trade the fully deployed Soviet SS-24
mobile-missile system for the unbuilt rail-mounted MX
missile. It wouldn't touch the most potent new weapon in
either arsenal -- the U.S. Trident II or the D5, a
multiple-warhead submarine-based missile that is the first
sea-launched weapon to match the pinpoint accuracy of
land-based missiles.</p>
<p>The key remaining differences on strategic arms control,
include limits on air and sea-launched cruise missiles. In
addition, the two sides remain far apart on a critical issue
in conventional arms control: limits on aircraft in Europe.
But the conventional arms disputes aren't scheduled to be
settled by the summit, so more time remains to resolve them.</p>
