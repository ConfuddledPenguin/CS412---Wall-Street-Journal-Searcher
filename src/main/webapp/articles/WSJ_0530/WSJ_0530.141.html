	<p class="article-leader">CASEY, Iowa -- Back in the early 1960s, the worn soil in
Guthrie County barely produced enough corn to feed the local
cattle herds. But then Burdette H. Ruppert began promoting an
elixir called anhydrous ammonia, a nitrogen fertilizer that
could double a field's yield. Local farmers who bought the
elevator manager's new product were soon shipping corn to big
grain export houses along the Mississippi.
   In Casey, it was the start of agriculture's chemical age.
Mr. Ruppert's business surged with the harvests. And when the
huge crops drew rootworms, he sold the farmers insecticides,
too. He crisscrossed the county in a Cadillac, vacationed in
Hawaii, and earned profits so fat that when the local bank
faced a squeeze, he could help bail it out.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But this spring, Mr. Ruppert is selling out. The reason:
He figures the farm chemicals industry he has been part of
for two decades is headed for rough times. "Burdette just saw
the handwriting on the wall," says a local crop consultant,
Douglas Peterson.</p>
<p>As environmentalism steadily gains ground across America
this spring, one of the movement's unbending targets has been
chemical farming -- witness recent stormy debates over
residues in foods and over groundwater purity. By and large,
U.S. farmers have deflected these protests, citing U.S.
agriculture's vast productivity and arguing that economics
simply leaves them little choice. But this year, as spring
planting nears completion in the Midwest, a gradual shift is
becoming apparent. Thousands of farmers are doing all they
can to reduce the use of chemicals.</p>
<p>Fertilizer use per acre of corn planted dropped 8% last
year, and insiders estimate it is down again this year, by
anywhere from 2% to as much as 10%. Prices are down, a blow
to chemical companies used to selling about $8 billion of
fertilizer in the U.S. each year. The $5 billion-a-year
pesticide business is harder to measure, because its products
are changing, but usage is basically flat. Best estimates are
that overall volume will grow at maybe 1% to 2% a year
through the 1990s -- half the rate in the 1980s.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for the shift. Most notably,
farmers themselves worry about overuse of man-made
substances. Their views started to shift in recent years
after surveys began showing widespread contamination of
water. In Iowa, pollsters discovered that nearly three of
every four Iowa farmers now believe that agriculture depends
too much on weedkillers, insecticides and commercial
fertilizers. Nationwide, nearly half of all farmers say they
are increasingly concerned about their own safety.</p>
<p>Farmers also are using new tillage practices that reduce
the amounts they need to buy. Application methods have the
same effect, by putting the chemicals only on the row and not
between rows.</p>
<p>And as soil tests get more precise, farmers are learning
that they may have been using more chemicals than they needed
all along. Thirty miles down the road from Casey, farmer Ron
Dunphy last year used a new soil test developed at Iowa State
University that persuaded him to slash his fertilizer use in
half. Yet he still grew 183 bushels of corn an acre --
winning a local corn-yield contest. University of Nebraska
researchers have just concluded that U.S. farmers could cut
their fertilizer and pesticide use by 10% over four years
with little impact on harvests.</p>
<p>Fertilizer dealers have long tested farmers' soil to see
what it needed. But, says farmer Scott Benton with
skepticism, "it seems like whichever fertilizer dealer did
the test always said there wasn't any nitrogen in the soil"
in order to sell fertilizer. Nitrogen is the nutrient
supplied primarily by anhydrous ammonia, although it can also
be put back in the soil with manure or by rotating a corn
crop with a "nitrogen-fixing" crop like soybeans or alfalfa.</p>
<p>Awareness of the water-purity issue is clearly on the rise
in Iowa. Last week, high levels of nitrates in water forced
officials in Iowa City to warn parents for the second time
this planting season not to use local water in baby formula.
Nitrates can weaken an infant's ability to carry oxygen in
its blood, causing something called blue baby syndrome.</p>
<p>Farmers are concerned not only about the water but about
inhaling the chemicals as they apply them. Of 800 U.S.
farmers polled in August by Jefferson Davis Associates, a
Cedar Rapids firm, about half said they worry that their use
of crop chemicals is dangerous to themselves. At the same
time, they're concerned about how it all plays among
city-dwellers. Some 83% said they fear that townspeople blame
them for polluting the environment.</p>
<p>All this is quite a change for dealers like Mr. Ruppert,
and not a particularly welcome one. A stout gray-haired man
with a florid face and a booming voice, he sits in his office
at Casey Mill & Elevator Inc., at a desk adorned by a
three-inch stack of for-sale notices by other chemical
dealers. "This is a lot tougher business than it used to be,"
he says. "The housewife in Manhattan thinks I'm a dope
peddler."</p>
<p>According to an Iowa trade group, the number of
farm-chemical dealers in the state is expected to drop by 25%
in the next two years. Like Mr. Ruppert, many will sell to a
big farm cooperative better positioned to finance the
chemical business in an era of meager growth. He frowns at
the sound of workmen mounting a time clock on the wall for
the new owner, Crestland, a fast-expanding $50 million
cooperative.</p>
<p>It will take work to put the Crestland look on this dusty,
slightly worn business. The elevator, which looms over the
tiny town, sports a purple-and-white sign for the town's
Lutheran Church. Inside the white clapboard office, the sales
counter is papered with notices for pancake fund-raisers and
farm auctions. Rat poison, rubber gloves and pesticide jugs
line one wall. Slumped on wooden chairs, four farmers are
dissecting high-school basketball prospects.</p>
<p>There was a time when Mr. Ruppert, 56, seemed like a
miracle worker around here. He grew up on a farm outside of
Casey, did a stint in the Army and became a tire salesman.
Then in 1963, his father-in-law made him manager of the
financially troubled grain elevator in town. Soon, he helped
outfit it with a 12,000-gallon tank to hold anhydrous
ammonia.</p>
<p>Initially, many farmers were afraid of putting something
into the ground that could knock them dead if they inhaled
it. Mr. Ruppert urged the few who agreed to try it not to
treat the five rows next to the road. That way anyone driving
by could see the treated plants towering over the
traditionally grown corn.</p>
<p>It worked. Anhydrous ammonia not only made corn more
robust, it enabled farmers to grow it year after year in the
same field. Corn, the fuel of the meat industry, was the
best-paying crop to grow, but it sucked so much nitrogen out
of the soil that farmers previously could grow it on a given
field only every other year. Anhydrous ammonia replenished
the nitrogen. In eight years, Guthrie County's corn
production jumped from 6.7 million bushels to 10 million.</p>
<p>In 1967, however, corn stalks in the area began
collapsing. Growing corn year after year in the same soil had
provided a steady diet for root worms. But this only meant
more business for Mr. Ruppert: He shipped in 10,000 pounds of
pesticides.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruppert became one of the leading citizens of Casey,
population 473. He had its biggest payroll, nine. He was a
Lutheran church elder, fire chief, Lions Club president and
school official.</p>
<p>In 1987, the harvest was so big he had to store corn on
the ground. His elevator reaped a windfall storing it for the
government. But the huge stockpiles (which were due to
subsidy programs and foreign-trade trends as well as to the
higher yields) were driving down crop prices.</p>
<p>That's when the tables began to turn. In one respect, his
chemicals were too effective. They were increasing the amount
of money that the government needed to pay to compensate
farmers for low prices. The government tried to reduce the
surpluses by paying farmers to idle millions of acres of
land. In a hilly county like Guthrie, where the soil is
highly erodible, 25% of the farmland was idled. That meant
fewer sales for Mr. Ruppert.</p>
<p>Environmental concerns also began to mount. While
surveying landfills for evidence of groundwater
contamination, scientists found traces of pesticides. Dairy
farmers in northeast Iowa discovered nitrate (a form of
nitrogen) in their water troughs. In 1987, Iowa slapped a tax
on fertilizer, with proceeds used to find ways to minimize
chemical usage. The state required farmers to pass a test
showing they could apply the chemicals safely, and it forced
dealers to spend tens of thousands of dollars making sure
products were stored safely.</p>
<p>Things got tighter when more-precise soil testing began to
hold fertilizer usage down. "I must have been wasting a lot,"
says Mr. Dunphy, of Creston, the farmer who cut his use in
half and still won the crop-yield contest.</p>
<p>Practices like those adopted by Mr. Benton cut further
into usage. He sprays chemicals in a band on top of his corn
and soybean rows, instead of everywhere, thus cutting his use
of herbicides by 64% and his fertilizer use by 20%.</p>
<p>Mr. Benton, 31, gives another reason for cutting back: "I
want to farm here for 30 years. I can't afford to poison the
well."</p>
<p>The government also is beginning to require farmers on
hilly land to adopt conservation techniques if they wish to
continue receiving price-support payments. Instead of turning
over the soil completely, some farmers are building up their
seed beds into ridges. The ridges are permanent -- and only
they will need to be treated with fertilizer. Debris left in
between the ridges prevents weeds from getting sunlight,
reducing the need for herbicides. Researchers now suspect
that the old practice of turning over the soil probably
helped more to plant weeds than to prevent them from growing.</p>
<p>Farm chemicals unquestionably will continue to serve as a
major tool for farmers. There is little incentive for farmers
to cut deep enough into their use to reduce harvests
substantially. In addition, the Agriculture Department's
best-paying price-support programs are for chemical-dependent
crops such as corn, wheat and cotton.</p>
<p>At the same time, the era of heady growth is clearly over.
Fertilizer prices are down 10% to 15%. Manufacturers project
nationwide fertilizer consumption to rise about 3% from a
year ago, but this is on an estimated 4% to 5% greater
acreage of corn, the crop on which nearly half of fertilizer
is used.</p>
<p>An anhydrous ammonia plant hasn't been built in the U.S.
in a decade. W.R. Grace & Co. has shed its fertilizer
operations, and a Mississippi phosphate plant closed in
December. By some estimates, one-third of North American
pesticide manufacturers evaporated in the 1980s. "It's a
no-growth business," says Paul T. Leming, an analyst at
Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>Last year, Mr. Ruppert wrote a letter to himself analyzing
his business prospects. The big crop production days of the
county are over and fertilizer prices are slipping, he noted.
Then he typed: "Look for more co-op mergers and further
weakening of profits in the future."</p>
<p>He also noted that the fertilizer tax Iowa started cost
him $1,226. Insurance costs had grown to $56,197 in 1988 from
$15,983 in 1978, in part because of rising worries by
insurers about the liability of dealers. Required
improvements to his dealership would cost at least another
$50,000. Meanwhile, the paperwork was building: The list of
licenses and permits he needed had grown to 25.</p>
<p>"Too much risk-margins too low," he wrote. It was time to
sell out.</p>
