	<p class="article-leader">Six months after my first vote for Richard Nixon I'd
concluded it was a mistake. Dashing young president. Soaring
rhetoric. Stylish First Lady. Intellectuals in the White
House. Bear any burden. Country moving again. Enough of
Midwestern plain; let's all become beautiful people.
   November 1963 was bye-bye, Miss American Pie. The month
opened with the assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem. The U.S. had
sanctioned a coup against its ally; better to win the hearts
and minds of the people, the beautiful people said. The month
closed with the assassination of John F. Kennedy -- perhaps
in retaliation, I have come to suspect, for faux-tough plots
to assassinate Fidel Castro.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>(Later, of course, we also were to learn that Camelot had
its Pompadour, Judith Campbell Exner.) Lyndon Johnson, not a
beautiful person, had opposed the Diem coup, but he was left
to deal with its consequences -- battlefield chaos and a
vastly deepened American commitment. And guess what? The
beautiful people cut and ran.</p>
<p>LBJ knew the Tet offensive was coming, but neglected to
warn the rest of us, so battlefield victory was perceived at
home as defeat. To deal with the mess, the American political
system searched deepest oblivion and found Richard Nixon. He
got out of Vietnam, more or less. He won a landslide
re-election, but tripped at Watergate. The beautiful people
finally got him; their reward was Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p>This brief history of our times is prerequisite for coping
with Richard Nixon's new book, "In the Arena: A Memoir of
Victory, Defeat and Renewal" (Simon & Schuster, 384 pages,
$21.95). President Nixon, of course, published an extensive
memoir, "RN," back in 1978, as well as five quite successful
books since. His new book might more aptly be described as
his reflections at age 77. And it might be understood as a
final foray, now that he's won a measure of rehabilitation,
in his life-long battle with the beautiful people.</p>
<p>For at first blush, the overwhelming impression of the
book is banality. An elderly man draws on his rich
experiences to sketch McGuffey-reader lessons about family,
or religion or wealth or politics. All wrapped in
archetypical Nixon prose, a cross between a legal brief and
Reader's Digest, graceless but highly effective. And nowhere
is there a real surprise, a departure from the Nixon we've
alternately elected and hated.</p>
<p>Nor is there any answer to questions we might like to ask
from the hindsight of the '90s: With a 30-point lead over the
hapless George McGovern, why didn't he confess everything
about the Watergate break-in and let it be washed away in the
electoral landslide? Given the part President Reagan's "Star
Wars" speech played in cracking the Soviet Union, was the ABM
treaty really a good idea? Given the damage still lingering
from the 1970s world inflation, any second thoughts about
scrapping the Bretton Woods monetary system? (In "RN," Mr.
Nixon described the closing of the gold window and floating
the dollar as, "one of the best things that came out of the
whole economic program" so fatefully formulated at Camp David
in August 1971.)</p>
<p>In the end, though, the book's predictability becomes its
peculiar virtue. For at least in Mr. Nixon's mind his public
persona was stamped, and much of his subsequent career
foreordained, when he took on the establishment, the
administration and the media over Alger Hiss. He tells of a
newsman warning him, "The worst thing you can do to a member
of the press corps is to prove that he has been wrong on a
major issue"; and he observes, "That is precisely what I did
on the Hiss case, and it would not be the last time."</p>
<p>He quotes a friend as saying that without the lingering
negative press from the Hiss case, he might have won the
presidential election in 1960. And he alludes to his wife:
"Losing in 1960 was a disappointment. But in her case, it was
doubly so because she believes to this day that the election
was stolen through vote fraud in Illinois and Texas." The
book does not mention the account of Earl Mazo, then of the
New York Herald-Tribune, that a defeated Nixon personally
persuaded him not to pursue this theme because it would
damage the presidency.</p>
<p>"For bringing `peace' by accepting Communist domination of
Indochina, I might even have won the Nobel Peace Prize," Mr.
Nixon writes of opposition to his policy of gradual
withdrawal from Vietnam. "Ironically, anti-war critics still
label the Cambodian incursions, which saved lives and reduced
the Communists' ability to continue their attacks on our
forces, an `expansion' of the war." And with the Christmas
bombings of Hanoi, "one ex-prisoner told me, `we knew we were
finally going home.'" In the end, he writes, "The war was
winnable. We won the war but lost the peace"; by slashing aid
to South Vietnam and proscribing American bombing, "Congress
destroyed our ability to enforce the Paris agreement and left
our allies vulnerable to Hanoi's invading forces.</p>
<p>"In retrospect, I would say that Watergate was one part
wrongdoing, one part blundering, and one part political
vendetta." He faults himself chiefly for not taking charge
and for deciding, while ill, not to burn the White House
tapes. He agrees that the famous "smoking gun" tape caught
him in "inexcusable error" in ordering the CIA to tell the
FBI that too much investigation of the break-in might reveal
national-security secrets, but says the order came to nothing
when CIA chiefs balked. He takes deep affront at a variety of
charges -- income-tax disputes, for example -- that swirled
in the vortex, and in particular at allegations against his
friends Bebe Robozo and Robert Abplanalp.</p>
<p>Various readers will find this variously persuasive. As
some reviews of "In the Arena" already show, it will call the
beautiful people to the old ramparts. There also will be
doubts among those of us who, limited to that choice, take
the Nixon side. After reading his book, it's not easy to
accept that he has achieved the "inner peace" he claims in
his final chapter.</p>
<p>Mr. Nixon himself must have suspended disbelief when he
wrote that, because since his resignation, he's not been
working at his personal rehabilitation, only serving a higher
cause. He obviously was delighted with Newsweek's "He's Back"
cover following his speech to publishers; as I recall, the
speech worked to ingratiate himself with the beautiful people
at the expense of the Reagan foreign policy.</p>
<p>The rehabilitation has in fact been managed so
consummately that now Richard Nixon can once again speak his
mind. If he won't make his own brief, who will? In a way,
it's comforting to have back the Old Nixon, bloody but
unbowed.</p>
