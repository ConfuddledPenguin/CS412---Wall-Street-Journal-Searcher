	<p class="article-leader">THE MIDWEST IS TO TEST electronic filing of balance-due
returns next year.
   People who owe tax will get fewer benefits from filing
computer-ready returns by wire than did the 4.2 million
electronic filers whose 1990 refunds arrived faster. But they
will get receipts for their returns and help reduce errors.
The IRS is eager for the processing advantages. So it plans
in 1991 to have its Cincinnati center accept balance-due
returns from preparers filing electronically from West
Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Michigan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the test works, the program will be made national in
1992. The returns can be filed early; preparers will supply
taxpayers with payment vouchers to mail with their checks by
April 15. Thus, payment won't be paperless; but the IRS is
experimenting with that. Its Andover, Mass., center this year
accepted six returns reporting taxes paid by wire transfers
from a bank. The bank advanced the funds for six customers
and billed their credit-card accounts.</p>
<p>The IRS isn't allowed to take credit-card payments. Banks
may lend money for taxes in any form they choose.</p>
<p>EMPLOYERS' ERRORS in wage reports to Social Security
muddle many accounts.</p>
<p>Social Security runs on records: It credited over $2
trillion in 1988 earnings to 130 million workers -- relying
on 265 million wage and self-employment-pay reports. But each
year, it faces over a million discrepancies between reports
to it and to the IRS. Three million more reports are shunted
to a "suspense file" while the agency tries to clear up
missing or faulty employer and employee ID numbers and to
correct other errors, so many workers lose credits for the
Social Security taxes they pay.</p>
<p>Social Security Commissioner King says the agency is
taking many steps to instruct employers on filing correctly
and workers on checking their accounts. The IRS is starting
to assess penalties on employers who file withholding-tax
reports late, improperly, or not at all. And new rules
require employers to certify that they are reporting the same
information to both agencies.</p>
<p>PAPERLESS PAYMENTS of state business taxes by wire are
spreading widely.</p>
<p>Fourteen states require businesses to make certain large
payments by electronic transfers between banks; the number
adopting the more efficient and accurate systems may double
by 1991, officials say. Indiana collects $3 billion a year
this way from concerns owing at least $20,000 a month in
corporate-income, sales, payroll-withholding, and fuel taxes.
New Mexico gets over $80 million a month from 503 concerns
remitting sales, withholding, and oil-and-gas taxes.</p>
<p>Electronic transfers help states manage cash flow and
raise interest-earning bank balances. But multistate
corporations worry about coping with a different system in
each state. So uniform standards are being developed and
promoted jointly by the Federation of Tax Administrators, a
state officials' group; the Committee on State Taxation, a
corporate group, and the National Automated Clearing House
Association. Most states are adopting these standards.</p>
<p>In New England, the IRS is about to start testing
electronic collections of corporate federal tax deposits.</p>
<p>INTENSIFIED AUDITS of small pension plans have pension
designers and their clients fuming. But the Supreme Court has
refused to review a seventh-circuit appeals-court ruling on
which the IRS relies. In that case, the IRS discredited
assumptions used in the tax-deductible funding of a plan for
Jerome Mirza & Associates Ltd.</p>
<p>A FOURGONE CONCLUSION? In a fourth straight case, the Tax
Court imposed damages of $5,000 on Orian E. Wright of
California for filing frivolous tax-protester pleas. He
appealed the three prior rulings to the ninth-circuit appeals
court; it has upheld two and recently ordered Wright to pay
$1,500 for a frivolous appeal.</p>
<p>SALES TAXES are climbing again. Oklahoma's rose to 4.5%
from 4% on May 1. On July 1, Kentucky's goes to 6% from 5%
and New Mexico's to 5% from 4.75%. Nebraska's rises to 5%
from 4% on July 10. North Dakota voters will decide June 12
whether to raise their tax to 6% from 5% for a year.</p>
<p>THEY WORKED IN deductible business losses when they laid
plans to work out.</p>
<p>Bill Upton, Wayne E. Schirmer, and other professional men
of Moberly, Mo., formed an S corporation in 1982 to own a
health club for them. S concerns are taxed much like
partnerships; the founders noted that the 25 stockholders not
only would get free family memberships for their $8,000
investments, but also could deduct personal shares of the
club's losses. They sold some other memberships, mainly by
word of mouth; but the losses ranged from $13,954 to $21,352
in the club's first five years.</p>
<p>The IRS denied the holders' 1982 deductions, saying the
club didn't have a profit motive. Now Tax Court Judge Shields
has upheld the IRS; the tax and recreational benefits show
the club wasn't run for profit, he says. The owners had no
expertise in running a club, didn't get expert advice, and
didn't hire a staff. They did "virtually nothing" to recruit
paying members.</p>
<p>Indeed, the judge notes, the club didn't even put up a
sign to show the public what was available inside.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: The IRS plans a hearing June 11 on proposed tax
rules for employee-expense reimbursements. . . . Kenneth
Ralph Barger of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, may not deduct a loss
from mortgage foreclosure on a house he bought for his son,
the Tax Court says; Barger's motive in buying the house was
to help his son, not to make a profit.</p>
