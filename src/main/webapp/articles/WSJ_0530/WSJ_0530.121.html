	<p class="article-leader">West Germany plans to block the proposed takeover by MAN
AG and Daimler-Benz AG of 80% of Empresa Nacional de
Autocamiones S.A., or Enasa, the Spanish state-owned truck
company, MAN said.
   The federal anti-cartel office informed MAN, an
engineering concern, that it can't approve the acquisition in
its current form, MAN said. MAN and Daimler have until next
Wednesday to respond to the objections. The agency is
expected to make its final ruling by July 15. A denial may be
appealed to the economics minister.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The antitrust agency declined to comment, noting that the
investigation isn't complete. People in the industry said the
agency objects to the cooperation of MAN and Daimler, the two
main West German truck makers; MAN agreed to acquire 60% of
Enasa and Daimler-Benz 20%, with 20% to remain in Spain's
state industrial holding company, Instituto Nacional de
Industria, which also is to acquire an 8% interest in MAN.
MAN would gain control of the heavy-truck lines and Daimler
the light-truck plant, but they want to exercise joint
managerial control and take responsibility for all of Enasa.</p>
