	<p class="article-leader">WIESBADEN, West Germany -- West German wholesale sales
fell 2% after inflation in April from April 1989, the result
of a steep decline in sales of raw materials and semifinished
goods that weighed against steady sales of finished goods,
the Federal Statistics Office here said.
   A total of 71 billion Deutsche marks ($42.2 billion) of
wholesale sales were recorded in April.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The statistics office said that virtually all sectors of
raw material and semifinished goods experienced declines in
wholesale sales in April.</p>
