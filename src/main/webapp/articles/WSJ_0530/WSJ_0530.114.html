	<p class="article-leader">Mediq Inc., a New Jersey hospital equipment supplier, sued
Kinetic Concepts Inc., claiming that Kinetic obtained
confidential information about Mediq during negotiations for
a proposed buy-out, and then bought a competing supplier
instead.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia,
asks the court to halt Kinetic's acquisition of Salt Lake
City, Utah-based Medirec and to enjoin Kinetic from using any
Mediq confidential information. It also asks for unspecified
damages.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kinetic, a specialized bed manufacturing and rental
concern, agreed earlier this month to buy Medirec for about
$26 million in cash and $10 million of preferred stock, which
is convertible into common at $10 a share. Medirec, a
privately held medical equipment rental concern, competes
with Mediq/PRN Life Support Services of Pennsauken, N.J., a
health-care services and equipment manufacturing and leasing
unit of Mediq.</p>
<p>Mediq claims that during buy-out talks with Kinetic, it
disclosed confidential information including marketing
methods, cost and pricing information and bidding strategies.
Kinetic abruptly terminated the buy-out talks in April, and
three weeks later disclosed its purchase of Medirec. Mediq
claims Kinetic's possession of the information puts Mediq/PRN
at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for Kinetic and Medirec denied Mediq's charges.</p>
