	<p class="article-leader">Hungry for fees, Wall Street brought out so many new
publicly traded bond funds that prices plunged. But now that
the bond funds are in the cellar, the smart money is moving
in to buy.
   Among the buyers is Ronald Olin of Houston's Deep Discount
Advisors. Usually, he keeps most of his clients' money in
stock funds. But in recent months he has switched one-third
of it into bond funds. Mr. Olin is one of the few money
managers specializing solely in publicly traded, or
"closed-end," funds, a type that has mushroomed to a $50
billion market even while disappointing many small investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Olin makes money from others' misery, waiting
patiently for funds to lose their luster and then scooping
them up at rock bottom prices. He is able to play this game
because closed-end funds -- so called because they are closed
to new investors after their initial offerings -- can trade
in the market at prices that differ widely from the market
value of the securities they own.</p>
<p>There are certainly plenty of bond funds to choose from.
At the start of 1988, there were just 46 of these publicly
traded bond funds. In the past two years, 88 new bond funds
have been sold to investors. "After the crash, that was one
of the few products that could be sold to a shell-shocked
public," recalls Mr. Olin. "They brought out gobs and gobs of
these bond funds."</p>
<p>Unlike regular mutual funds, the closed-end funds make
only one offering of shares, which then trade on an exchange
like any other stock. The shares are sold to small investors
at what amounts to a 7.5% premium to the value of the
underlying portfolio. That's because of the brokerage
commissions charged on a new closed-end. For every $1 anted
up by investors at the IPO, seven cents goes to the fund's
underwriter and the selling broker. The remaining 93 cents is
actually invested for the benefit of the fund's shareholder.</p>
<p>Once the IPO hoopla has passed, closed-end funds usually
slip to trade at a discount to the value of their portfolios.
That's when bargain hunters like Mr. Olin turn up. And right
now, Mr. Olin is taking a warmer view of the closed-end bond
funds.</p>
<p>Stock prices of closed-end bond funds now are slipping so
fast that some funds are moving to shore up their fund's
stock price. Only last week, Massachusetts Financial
Services, which manages seven bond funds and one fund that
buys a mixture of stocks and high-yield junk bonds, says its
funds may start buying back their own shares if the discounts
get wider than 10%.</p>
<p>But Mr. Olin reckons the bond funds deserve these steep
discounts. "If a bond fund has a 1% expense ratio and its
portfolio is returning 10%, then it should be at a 10%
discount just to be fairly priced," contends Mr. Olin.</p>
<p>Here's his reasoning. Because his imaginary fund owns
bonds yielding 10% but the fund also has a 1% annual expense
ratio, the portfolio is only returning 9% after expenses,
which is less than the 10% you could earn if you bought the
bonds directly. So Mr. Olin figures that, for the closed-end
to be fairly priced, its stock should also yield 10%. For
that to happen, the fund's stock has to trade at a 10%
discount to the value of the fund's portfolio.</p>
<p>But on that basis, true bond fund bargains are scarce. If
you cast your eye down the list of closed-end bond funds that
appears in this newspaper every Wednesday, you won't find
many trading at 10% discounts.</p>
<p>Mr. Olin, however, isn't just hunting for the funds with
the fattest discounts. He is also looking for those discounts
that are almost certain to narrow.</p>
<p>Take $520 million Prudential Strategic Income, which
splits its assets between U.S. government bonds, junk bonds
and foreign government bonds. The fund came public at $10 in
January 1988, but closed yesterday in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange at $7.125, unchanged, a 5%
discount to its portfolio value of $7.48 a share.</p>
<p>Because of the discount, the fund's board has proposed
that the fund convert to a regular ("open-end") mutual fund,
which means the discount will be eliminated and shareholders
can sell their shares and get the fund's full net asset
value, as the fund's portfolio value is usually known.
Shareholders will vote on the proposal on Aug. 1, and Mr.
Olin reckons shareholder approval is a sure thing. "I'm
estimating that it will open-end by the end of October, based
on my experience," says Mr. Olin.</p>
<p>Lately, Mr. Olin has been loading up on $1.3 billion
Comstock Partners Strategy Fund Inc., the top performing
closed-end bond fund for the past 12 months. "They have a
provision to tender for their shares at net asset value in
the second quarter of next year." says Mr. Olin. "This one is
a little less attractive on an annualized basis compared to
Prudential Strategic, but it's a safer portfolio." In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Comstock
Partners closed yesterday at $9.375, unchanged, a 6% discount
to the fund's $9.93 net asset value per share.</p>
<p>Mr. Olin is betting that $66 million Flexible Bond Trust
Inc. will convert to a mutual fund. The board is in favor of
the change, and a shareholder vote is slotted for Sept. 6.
"The board thinks the open-ending will be effective by the
end of the first quarter of 1991," says Mr. Olin. Between now
and then, shareholders will earn whatever the fund earns,
plus also gaining from the closing of the fund's discount,
which now stands at 7%.</p>
<p>But because Flexible Bond Trust is so small, Mr. Olin says
buyers should be wary. "You should never put in a market
order," warns Mr. Olin. Instead, he advises putting in a "buy
limit order" at a price slightly below the current market
price. "These closed-ends generally trade at between $6 and
$12, so paying an extra 1/8th is significant," he says.</p>
<p>If you do decide to buy at the market price, Mr. Olin
suggests using an "immediate or cancel" order, just in case
the market price spikes upwards before your order is
executed.</p>
<p>Despite his recent foray into bond funds, Mr. Olin has
made most of his money from stock funds. Since turning his
hand to money management in 1981, he has returned 20.8% a
year for clients, versus 17.7% for the Standard & Poor's
500-stock index.</p>
<p>When digging among stock funds, Mr. Olin also looks for
discounts that he reckons are certain to narrow. He's
currently betting on Clemente Global Growth Fund, which
closed yesterday at a 17% discount to the value of its
portfolio. In 1992, Clemente's shareholders will get to vote
on converting the fund into a regular mutual fund, which --
if approved -- will effectively close the fund's discount. In
composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange,
Clemente closed at $10.125, up 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>Mr. Olin's biggest position is the income shares of Quest
for Value Dual Purpose Fund Inc. A dual purpose fund has two
classes of shares outstanding, income shares and capital
shares. The income shares get all the dividends pulled in by
the fund, while the capital shares benefit from any capital
appreciation in the portfolio stocks.</p>
<p>Quest for Value will be liquidated in early 1997, at which
point income shareholders will get back $11.60 a share. With
Quest's income shares closing yesterday in composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange at at 13.25, down 25 cents,
the shares might seem pricey.</p>
<p>Not at all, says Mr. Olin. "Those shares are probably as
safe or safer than AA corporates, which are yielding 9.4%,"
says Mr. Olin, who reckons the yield to maturity on Quest's
income shares will be at least 11.9%.</p>
<p>How so? As the fund's assets appreciate, it's not just the
capital shareholders that benefit. Income shareholders also
gain, because they receive the growing stream of dividends
that is kicked off by an ever-larger pool of assets.</p>
