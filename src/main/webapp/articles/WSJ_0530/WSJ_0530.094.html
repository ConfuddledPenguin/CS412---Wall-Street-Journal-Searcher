	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks rebounded in quiet post-holiday
trading, but trailed the gains of exchange-listed issues.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 3.82 to 457.51, a 0.84%
gain, compared with the 1.76% jump in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. Advancing shares led decliners, 1,014 to
868, as volume slipped to 133.9 million from 152.2 million
Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It was a typical bounce back on a quiet day," said
Richard Bruno, head of BUSY OTC trading at PaineWebber,
adding that some investors appeared to still be out for the
long Memorial Day weekend. Mr. Bruno said he saw a number of
institutions buying technology shares in the wake of Friday's
1% decline in the OTC market, led by the 15 1/4 plunge of
Adobe Systems.</p>
<p>Adobe rebounded 2 5/8 to 37 7/8 yesterday, joining other
technology shares in a surge led by the 3 1/2 point advance,
to 119 3/4, of International Business Machines. Apple
Computer rose 1 to 41; Intel added 1 1/8 to 48 5/8; Oracle
Systems gained 3/4 to 19 7/8; Seagate Technology advanced 1/2
to 14 1/4 and Sun Microsystems climbed 1/4 to 30 1/2.</p>
<p>Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst David Nelson said he is
sticking with the brokerage firm's top investment rating on
Adobe. Mr. Nelson said he believes the shortfall in the
Mountain View, Calif., software maker's revenue is temporary.</p>
<p>The analyst, who Friday cut his 1990 and 1991 earnings
estimates for the company by 30 cents a share, yesterday
added 15 cents a share to Friday's estimates after reviewing
the company's earnings outlook in more detail over the
weekend.</p>
<p>Mr. Nelson said he now estimates Adobe will earn $2 a
share this year and $2.75 in 1991, compared with $1.55 in
1989.</p>
<p>Cabot Medical rose 13/16 to 5 5/8 on more than 11 times
average volume. Warren G. Wood, president and chief executive
officer of the Langhorne, Pa., medical-instrument maker, told
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report there weren't any
corporate developments to explain the increased trading
activity. W.H. Newbold's Son & Co. analyst Edward J.
Stevetski suggested Cabot Medical's recent quarterly earnings
report and an advertisement about the company in Monday's
edition of Barron's might have drawn investors to the stock.</p>
<p>Harris & Harris Group gained 5/16 to 2 7/8 on more than
1.1 million shares after Worms & Co. reported that it cut its
stake in the New York insurance brokerage and financial
management group to 4.6% of its common shares outstanding.
Worms didn't give a reason for reducing its holdings. Stocks
sometimes gain after the sale of stock removes downward
pressure on the shares.</p>
<p>Sun Sportswear tumbled 2 1/8 to 10 5/8 on more than 18
times average volume. Deborah Skiles, vice president of
finance for the Kent, Wash., clothing designer and marketer,
said in an interview the stock apparently fell in reaction to
a report by Piper Jaffray Hopwood analyst Richard E. Pyle,
who cut his earnings estimates for the company's second
quarter by 33% and full year projection by 15% because of
sluggish order rates, according to DJPIR. However, Mr. Pyle
continues to rate the stock a "buy," DJPIR said. Ms. Skiles
said she agreed with "the trend" of Mr. Pyle's downward
revisions, but declined to comment on his specific estimates.</p>
<p>Big B dropped 1 3/8 to 9 7/8 after the Bessemer, Ala.,
operator of drug and food stores reported net income for the
first quarter ended May 12 of five cents a share, down from
30 cents a year earlier. Big B attributed the profit fall
primarily to financing costs and operating losses from 85
stores it acquired in February 1989.</p>
<p>Bio-Logic Systems stumbled 3/4 to 4 1/4 after the
Mundelein, Ill., designer and marketer of computerized
diagnostic systems reported net income for the 1990 fiscal
year ended Feb. 28 of 13 cents a share, down from 21 cents a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Statewide Bancorp slid 1 1/4 to 7 1/2 after the Toms
River, N.J., bank said late Friday that it increased its
allowance for loan losses by $30 million, suspended its
quarterly 20-cents-a-share dividend and agreed to a close
review of its main subsidiary under an agreement with the
comptroller of the currency.</p>
<p>Silk Greenhouse slid 1/4 to 4 1/2 after PIR said that some
analysts are concerned about inventory levels and credit
conditions outlined by the Tampa, Fla., operator of
artificial flower stores in its latest quarterly filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Analyst Harry G. Katica of Raymond, James & Associates,
which co-managed Silk Greenhouse's initial public offering
two years ago, told DJPIR that he now recommends investors
sell their Silk Greenhouse holdings. However, Alex. Brown &
Sons analyst Fred E. Wintzer Jr. said he continues to hope
the retailer can turn itself around, although he has a "hold"
opinion on it. Silk Greenhouse Chairman and President Jere L.
Bradwell declined to comment.</p>
