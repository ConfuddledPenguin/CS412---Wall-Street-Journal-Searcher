	<p class="article-leader">When Mikhail Gorbachev arrives here tonight he will be
pursuing more than trade and arms agreements. He, like other
leaders from nonmarket economies, is seeking techniques to
move to a market system. Here is one idea for privatizing
East Bloc industry.
   To initiate a market system, these countries must create
private owners for enterprises previously owned by the
people. No capital market exists, however, for selling stock
in existing enterprises. Moreover, few, if any, citizens can
purchase even a limited amount of government-owned plants.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although selling these operations to foreign interests is
technically feasible, it raises two major obstacles. First,
there is no good way to value the assets. Second, the public
would fear that foreigners were buying up the nation. To
succeed, a privatization must establish a process that
appears to be fair to the public, the people who, in theory,
own these assets now. My modest proposal would meet these
objections.</p>
<p>It is not enough for the government to privatize. In most
of these countries, the state has, over time, established
major conglomerates with numerous subsidiaries. If these
combines were simply transferred to private hands, the result
would be a handful of gigantic monopolies that would fail to
provide a competitive system.</p>
<p>The first step for the government, therefore, would be to
divide each conglomerate into as many potentially viable
enterprises as possible. Business relations among the former
parts of the conglomerate should continue, as before, until
the privatization is complete.</p>
<p>Once the government ministries create separate firms, each
manager of an enterprise would determine the number of shares
of stock to be offered to the public. The actual number is
unimportant since the market will set the value of each
share. To provide for widespread ownership, a minimum of
10,000 shares would seem reasonable. The managers would also
publish a financial report with as much information as
possible about the business. To minimize the temptation to
manipulate the data, the law should prohibit managers and
their families from bidding on shares in their own
enterprises. This, however, would not prevent managers from
buying into other firms, or buying into their own after this
first phase.</p>
<p>The government would prepare a schedule of a limited
number of facilities to be privatized each week. Although it
is important to privatize as much of the economy as quickly
as possible, individuals who fail to secure shares in the
first round should have an opportunity in later rounds.</p>
<p>Under this plan, the state would give each adult a voucher
for 1,000 units. Again, the actual number is not important.
(I would recommend giving children age five to 17 half the
allocation of adults; younger children, 10%. Parents would
exercise these units.)</p>
<p>The units would be good only for purchasing shares of
government facilities. Individuals would bid for shares --
e.g., 10 units per share for 50 shares of XYZ Co. After the
bids, the firms would allocate the equity according to the
highest bids. The lowest price that cleared the market would
be the price for all. If no one bid on the shares for an
enterprise, the government would give the equity to the
workers.</p>
<p>Individuals could sell their units, but only to other
nationals. Those that did not want to participate in the
bidding could sell their units to the more entrepreneurial.
Ideally, some people would come forward to make a market in
these units. However, if that failed to happen, the
government would provide a clearing house where buyers and
sellers could trade units. Alternatively, the government
could contract with a Western securities firm to make a
market in the units and perhaps to start making a market in
the stock after the initial allocation. The trading would lay
the foundation for a stock exchange.</p>
<p>The 10 largest stockholders, together with the three top
administrators of the facility, would become the original
board of directors. These directors would have the authority
to hire and fire the management and make general policy for
the enterprise. This would provide for both continuity and
new blood. If stock were too evenly divided to have 10 large
stockholders, the directors could be chosen by lot from the
largest stockholders. In any case, the original directors
would hold office only until an election of directors within
the first year of privatization.</p>
<p>Once the shares in an enterprise were distributed, the
stock could be sold for cash. For two years, the law would
limit foreigners to 49% of the equity. After two years, no
limit on foreign ownership would be imposed.</p>
<p>If there is a strong need for revenue, the government
could use this approach to privatize only a portion of the
ownership of enterprises. The state would retain minority
ownership until a genuine market in the shares has developed.</p>
<p>This proposal would resolve many of the difficulties that
the former communist states must overcome in moving assets
quickly into the private sector. Until East European
countries privatize a significant portion of their economy
they will be unable to secure the benefits of a market
economy. Eliminating the need to value the assets would
accelerate the process. The market would do that task.
Endowing everybody with a claim on the firms to be privatized
would mitigate opposition and build support. In the process,
the rudiments of a stock exchange would develop.</p>
