	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Economic officials from 24 major industrial
countries will try to boost faltering multilateral trade
talks when they gather here today for the annual meeting of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
   The U.S. is especially eager to galvanize the talks. "Our
window of opportunity is now," said White House Trade
Representative Carla Hills in a meeting with reporters here
yesterday. "It's just going to take the political will to do
it."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Similarly, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, speaking in
London before flying to Paris, said, "We are determined to
see these negotiations completed on time and with concrete
results."</p>
<p>The trade talks, called the Uruguay Round, are designed to
establish rules to govern the approximately one-third of
world trade that isn't covered by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. Accomplishing that goal would mean
bringing agriculture, services, intellectual property,
textiles and trade-related investment under GATT's
jurisdiction, toughening GATT rules and fully integrating
developing countries into the 96-nation organization.</p>
<p>The Uruguay Round talks are scheduled to be completed by
year end, but there are growing concerns that negotiators
won't be able to meet that timetable. Under U.S. law, the
talks must be finished by then or any legislation to put new
rules into effect won't qualify for streamlined, "fast-track"
consideration by Congress; that would be a severe blow to the
prospects for an accord.</p>
<p>U.S. leaders are concerned that the European Community
won't be willing to commit itself to reduce agricultural
subsidies substantially. "I think it's important for {the EC}
to understand that agriculture is a key to the success of the
round," Mrs. Hills said.</p>
<p>Just last week, President Bush said the U.S. sees
agricultural-trade reform as fundamental to the success of
the GATT talks, which began in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in
1986. And he pointedly added that the U.S. would prefer
having no agreement to a bad one.</p>
<p>Besides dealing with the GATT talks, economic officials
meeting here are expected to review recent developments in
the world economy, the transition to market economies in
Eastern Europe and environmental concerns. They also are
likely to discuss so-called tied-aid, which the U.S. is
trying to curtail. Tied aid is foreign assistance that
governments provide to developing countries on the condition
they buy goods from companies in the donor country.</p>
<p>There also may soon be new members of the club of 24 rich
nations; both South Korea and Singapore are possible
candidates, according to OECD officials.</p>
<p>Meanwhile yesterday, Treasury Secretary Brady and his
counterparts from about 40 other countries formally launched
the new European Bank for Reconstruction & Development in a
ceremony at the Elysee Palace. The EBRD, which will lend to
the new democracies in Eastern Europe and, to a very limited
extent, to the Soviet Union, is to be based in London.</p>
<p>French President Francois Mitterrand's adviser Jacques
Attali will head the new institution, and an American is
expected to fill the No. 2 slot. But at his breakfast address
in London, Mr. Brady said "no decision has been made" on an
American deputy for Mr. Attali.</p>
<p>President Mitterrand said he expects the bank to play a
"catalytic role" in helping the East bloc nations build
market economies. He called for the parliaments of the
participating nations to ratify the articles of agreement
promptly. The bank will begin formal operations once
two-thirds have done so.</p>
<p>Separately, OECD Secretary General Jean-Claude Paye this
week took a positive view of the state of the global economy,
but he added that there are "dark spots in the picture." In
its annual forecast released for the meeting, the OECD
predicted the economies of the 24-nation group will grow 2.9%
this year and next, after inflation. It forecast inflation at
4.4% in each of the next two years.</p>
<p>The OECD isn't worried that German unification will
rekindle inflation. Indeed, the OECD predicted that even with
full economic unification, German inflation would rise to 3%
this year and 3.4% next -- comfortably below the OECD
average.</p>
<p>But the OECD forecasts a rise in U.S. inflation to 4.2%
this year and 4.5% in 1991 from 4.1% in 1989. The
organization doesn't foresee a recession in the U.S. soon. It
predicts the U.S. economy will grow 2.3% this year and 2.5%
next year, after inflation.</p>
