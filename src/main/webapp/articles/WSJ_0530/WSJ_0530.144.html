	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Software Publishers Association said
domestic software sales grew at a surprisingly healthy rate
in the first quarter.
   North American sales grew 26%, and international sales by
U.S. software companies jumped even higher -- by 50% -- in
the same period. The news is a major departure from 1989,
when the annual growth rate in domestic software sales slowed
to 12% from the previous year; in 1988, by contrast, the
annual growth rate was up 40% from 1987.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bright figures "shocked us," said the association's
research director, Ann Stephens, who said that the first
quarter is generally the software industry's slowest season.</p>
<p>Ms. Stephens attributed the growth largely to the
introduction of a plethora of new products and upgrades and
to improved distribution controls. Most encouraging, she
said, is evidence that the sales surge is highest in
traditional categories like spreadsheets and word processors,
"which shows that fundamentally the industry is doing well."</p>
<p>Word processors had the largest and fastest growth for the
period, with $117 million in sales, an 88% rise. The SPA data
are based on monthly sales information from 150 leading PC
software publishers.</p>
<p>"The popular wisdom was that domestic sales have stalled,"
said SPA executive director Ken Wasch. "But this is the best
quarter we've had in years." And preliminary numbers for
April, he said, suggest that the sales improvement will
continue.</p>
<p>Mr. Wasch partly credited a crackdown on illegal software
copying -- an anti-piracy campaign that was spearheaded by
his association last year and reinforced by several recent
and hefty court settlements on the issue.</p>
