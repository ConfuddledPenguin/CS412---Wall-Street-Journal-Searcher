	<p class="article-leader">Downers Grove, Ill. -- A perusal of the sports calendar
for Memorial Day weekend revealed lots of baseball, the
middle games of the penultimate NBA playoff round, a bunch of
routine-looking golf "classics" and the Indianapolis 500, an
event in which cars and drivers vie to see which can carry
the most advertising stickers.
   I rejected that last thing out of hand (I went once and
found it gastly), and reasoned that I could catch up with the
others at other, more critical times. I chose instead to
attend the National Underwater Hockey Championships at the
Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine in this western
suburb of the Windy City.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I did so for several reasons. One is that I'm a sucker for
anything with "national" in its title. Another is that I'd
never seen anyone skate underwater. Finally, I hadn't seen
Brent Musberger in awhile, and was hoping he'd be covering it
for ABC.</p>
<p>I was disappointed in two of those quests. They didn't
skate here, they swam -- in a pool -- and Brent and ABC were
elsewhere. The event, however, was quite national, with 12
teams representing 10 cities. The winner was Club Puck, from
San Francisco, which defeated a Seattle team in the Sunday
afternoon final of the single-elimination tournament.</p>
<p>En route to the crown, the team from the bottom of the Bay
also beat Club Psychopuck, from St. Louis, and the gang I was
rooting for, Club Fred, from Chicago, the 1987 champs. The
Freds recouped somewhat by winning the unofficial
congeniality award for providing a covered truck in the
parking lot equipped with two battered sofas, a boom box, a
large keg of beer and chairs for tanning.</p>
<p>"Our guys got older, and a bit out of shape, but our pre-
and post-game parties have held up well," noted Club Fred
stalwart Heinz Werning, who sported a Mohawk-style hairpiece
taped to his bald pate.</p>
<p>Inside, though, the sport was spirited and altogether
serious. Underwater hockey is played by six-person teams (the
tourney was co-ed) equipped with fins, masks and snorkels.
They use 14-inch, unbladed sticks to try to shoot or push a
leaded puck about the size of a can of tuna fish into a
three-meters-wide (10-foot) goal at the pool's bottom.
Besides general athleticism and the usual aquatic skills, it
requires strong lungs, the better to stay submerged long
enough to do some good.</p>
<p>The idea, however, isn't to see who can stay down the
longest. "The best work is done in 5-to-12-second bursts,"
explained mustached Joe Grandov, a Club Puck member and coach
of the U.S. men's all-star team that will compete in the
sport's world championships next month in Montreal. "You dive
under, pass the puck to a teammate, and get back to the
surface to catch your breath and track play until you can be
useful again."</p>
<p>He added: "Positioning and teamwork count most. We can't
be Wayne Gretskys and take the puck the length of the pool
alone to score. We have to come up for air; Wayne never
does."</p>
<p>The tourney was conducted by the Underwater Society of
America, which oversees a number of sports. There's also fin
swimming, which includes above- and below-surface events;
free and scuba diving; underwater rugby (]); spearfishing;
and underwater photography. In that last activity, each
contestant gets a roll of film and four hours to paddle
around a defined area and shoot underwater scenes, with a
panel of judges determining the winner.</p>
<p>The society is an affiliated member of the U.S. Olympic
Committee, and, as such, would like to see underwater events
in future O Games. Interestingly, underwater swimming does
have an Olympic past. The 1900 Games, in Paris, gave medals
for an event in which two points were awarded for every meter
a competitor covered underwater, and one point for every
second he stayed down. The winner, France's Charles de
Vendeville, got 188.4 points for traversing 60 meters in 68.4
seconds. By contrast, the third-place finisher, a Dane,
stayed under for 90 seconds, but managed to swim only 28.5
meters.</p>
<p>The 1904 Olympics, in St. Louis, included a plunge for
distance that measured how far swimmers could get on a single
dive without surfacing or further movement. The U.S.'s
William Dickey won at 62 feet, 6 inches, but his triumph was
ascribed largely to the absence of a couple of Englishmen
who'd previously bettered 75 feet. Alas, that was to be that
for underwater events, and they joined things like the
100-meter freestyle for sailors (Athens, 1896) on the
Olympic-swimming reject pile.</p>
<p>If any underwater sport makes the Games, it probably will
be fin swimming, which features both speed and athlete
visibility. Underwater hockey is notably short on the latter:
Neither the puck, nor much significant underwater activity,
can be glimpsed from poolside. Sans underwater video or
windows below water level, the sport resembles nothing so
much as feeding time in the shark tank.</p>
<p>That's kind of what it's like where the action is, too,
players say. "There are rules against rough stuff, but
there's still plenty. We all have bruises," averred Mary Jo
Ferris of Club Fred. "It's like NBA basketball -- a
non-contact sport with contact."</p>
<p>Club Puck, featuring several U.S. world-team members,
cruised through the tourney with relative ease, beating St.
Louis in the semis, 9-1, and Seattle in the final, 7-3. The
pool in which the contests took place measured the proper 25
meters long, but, unlike venues for international
competitions, varied in depth from six to 12 feet, with a
down slope at the deep end that strongly favored teams
attacking in that direction.</p>
<p>That edge was balanced because teams changed ends for each
15-minute half, but it was a mark of Club Puck's dominance
that, defending the deep end, it held the Seattleans to a 2-2
tie in the first half of the championship go.</p>
<p>"We did some nice work, or at least I think we did,"
smiled Grandov, an engineer at Stanford University's linear
accelerator lab. "In underwater hockey, you're never really
sure what's going on unless you're down there yourself."</p>
