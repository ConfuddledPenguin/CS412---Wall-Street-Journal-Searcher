	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Consumers looking to buy a Ford might want to
consider a better idea: Wait until this fall.
   Ford Motor Co., in a letter to dealers, says it may nearly
double the incentives it now offers on 1990 model cars after
new 1991 models begin to appear in showrooms this October.
The move is aimed at encouraging dealers to stock up now on
new 1990 cars by assuring them that Ford will protect them
from taking a bath should the cars sit in showrooms past
Sept. 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the disclosure of Ford's year-end clearance strategy
could undermine the auto maker's efforts to boost its lagging
sales now. While Ford declined to comment on its incentive
plans, which were disclosed yesterday in the trade journal
Automotive News, one Ford spokesman acknowledged that
publicity about the company's fall incentive program could
hurt sales this summer. "It depends to a large extent on the
degree to which {the plans are} reported," he said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, several dealers who confirmed details of the
incentive program say they don't like the letter's
implication that if they don't beef up orders, they might not
get the vehicles they need later this summer.</p>
<p>"We aren't going to be moved by threats," says Jim Hoffer,
general sales manager for Jordan Ford in Mishawaka, Ind. Mr.
Hoffer said he was paid an unusual sales call last week by
Ford officials, who strongly suggested that his dealership
increase its order level. It didn't.</p>
<p>Currently, Ford offers cash and financing incentives
averaging about $1,000 a vehicle. But Ford's letter to
dealers says it plans to boost cash incentives this fall on
1990 models by between $400 and $1,500 a vehicle under the
model year-end clearance program.</p>
<p>Such a round of price cutting by Ford, particularly in the
current soft market, could spur further industrywide
discounting, analysts say. "When someone as big as Ford gets
aggressive on incentives, then everyone is going to have to
follow," says John Casesa, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder.
"I don't think there's any way around that."</p>
<p>Year-end clearance sales aren't unusual in the auto
industry. In recent years, generous year-end discounts have
sent sales soaring during the fall and winter months. But
Ford appears to be telegraphing its strategy earlier and in
more detail than it has in the past.</p>
<p>The move comes at a time when Ford is struggling to firm
up its sagging market share and keep its U.S. factories
running at full speed. Ford's share of U.S. car sales dropped
to 21.5% from 23.2% through the first four months of this
year. The slippage results in part from the limited
availability of the new Ford Escort subcompact, traditionally
one of Ford's best-selling models.</p>
<p>More importantly, dealer reluctance to order new cars has
forced Ford since April 1 to order one-week shutdowns at four
North American car assembly plants, including the two
factories that build the popular Taurus and Sable midsized
cars. Ford warned dealers in the letter that if they continue
to hold back on orders, "it could lead to substantial dealer
{product} flow interruptions," particularly when the
company's plants take scheduled two-week vacations in July.</p>
<p>Some dealers describe Ford's effort as heavyhanded and say
it could backfire. "I'm not going to change my ordering
habits because of what Ford says," according to Frank Meccia,
general sales manager of Al Piemonte Ford near Chicago. In an
effort to save on inventory carrying costs, Mr. Meccia's
dealership is trying to maintain a 45-day to 60-day supply of
cars, almost half of what it has during times of strong car
sales.</p>
<p>Ford has been trying in recent weeks to reduce the amount
it's spending for consumer incentives. Ford officials laid
some of the blame for lackluster first-quarter earnings on
heavy discounting in the U.S. In early May, the auto maker
cut its average rebate by about $200 a vehicle, to about
$1,000.</p>
<p>Ford dealers say the letter indicates consumers will see
bigger discounts in the fall. But it isn't clear that Ford
will spend more money for the proposed program of rebates
than it has for its traditional year-end clearance tool:
giving dealers a 5% discount on cars left on the lots after a
new model year begins. That program, now discontinued, was
more popular with dealers because it gave them the
flexibility to offer discounts to consumers or bonuses to top
salesmen -- or to pocket some of the money themselves.</p>
<p>By using varying amounts of cash incentives, instead of a
flat percentage, Ford may improve its ability to move
vehicles that have bigger inventories or are in more
competitive markets.</p>
<p>Ford's letter to dealers also says the company may offer
enhanced incentives as early as this summer to clear out 1990
models in advance of the 1991 model year. Such a move might
fuel a growing problem with buyer incentives: Their constant
ups and downs bewilder consumers, who want to buy when the
rebates are the highest but don't know when that will be.
Says Martin J. McInerney, who has several dealerships in
Detroit and Florida: "The programs are so confusing that it
takes a Philadelphia lawyer to figure them out."</p>
