	<p class="article-leader">San Francisco -- It is a civilized city in which one can
step out of one's hotel and purchase excellent cappuccino on
the street in brilliantly sunny May weather. But San
Francisco also is a nervous city; the young woman at the
espresso stand looked white as a ghost as she, zombielike,
ignored my order. A streetcar had just passed, slightly
shaking the ground underfoot, and she had imagined an
earthquake.
   Although the ground has been shaking a lot with small
tremors lately, that is not all that is shaking in a San
Francisco fighting to maintain its sophisticated image. For
one thing, the hotel I walked out of is a towering new
Marriott downtown that lights up a night skyline like a gaudy
jukebox. Then, across the Bay, there is the controversial
competition for a memorial to commemorate the 25th
anniversary of the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley. A
conceptual artist has proposed declaring a cylinder of air
rising from a six-inch hole drilled into Sproul Plaza on the
University of California campus as air space that will not be
subject to any government.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>No one, of course, could call into question the
uncompromising artistic purpose of the San Francisco Symphony
and its commissioning of a work from one of America's most
distinguished composers, Elliott Carter. Mr. Carter has
contributed something rare and dear to American music, a
major violin concerto. But even its premiere early this month
did not entirely escape gaudy commercialism and a bit of
rebellious anarchy.</p>
<p>The anarchy came in the form of one patron who decided
that Davies Hall should not have to be a musically sovereign
space, choosing instead to listen to his loudly audible
walkman during the performance, until he was evicted.</p>
<p>The commercialism issue was more bothersome and less
easily resolved. Mr. Carter's new concerto was sandwiched
between a program of classical chestnuts, Schubert's
"Unfinished" Symphony and Brahms's Second Symphony, works
that any orchestra knows well and should hardly have to
rehearse, leaving time to work on the very difficult new one.
But the San Francisco Symphony, which has been making some
splendid recordings lately with its music director, Herbert
Blomstedt, also was slated to record the "Unfinished"
following the concerts. So it was Schubert who received more
nuanced and caring attention than Mr. Carter.</p>
<p>Still, the San Francisco Symphony is a classy operation,
one that often does live up to the cultured image that the
city loves to project. Mr. Blomstedt, for instance, can be
partially excused for accommodating his record company,
London Records, by devoting Carter time preparing for an
unnecessary "Unfinished." Apparently, even with 38 versions
of the Schubert symphony in print, a new one nonetheless
still can finance discs of composers such as Hindemith and
Nielsen, to whom the conductor is devoted. And probably
nothing better projects a sophisticated image for the
orchestra than Michael Steinberg's program notes.
Concert-goers come early to read them.</p>
<p>In fact, it was Mr. Steinberg's luminous descriptions that
left one slightly disappointed with the performance, which
was capable but not poetic. Mr. Carter wrote the concerto for
the Norwegian violinist Ole Boehn because he liked Mr.
Boehn's fiery way with his Duo for Violin and Piano. But the
new concerto -- with its rapturous, soaring long solo lines
-- certainly will sound better when a violinist of less
coarse tone gets his bow on it.</p>
<p>The half-hour work itself is, as one would expect from Mr.
Carter, difficult. Everywhere throughout the three movements
are zillions of details to absorb. But no composer organizes
confusion like Mr. Carter, and there are few experiences as
rewarding in modern music as the coming to terms with a
Carter score. It takes time, but as one eventually begins to
distinguish shapes throughout the intricate textures, as one
starts to piece together the whole of the broken solo violin
lines of the slow movement, one has the ineffable feeling of
comprehending something really important, the kind of feeling
astronomers must get when they begin to master the nighttime
sky.</p>
<p>Such feelings remained rare for this listener with only
two hearings of the new concerto (a rehearsal run-through and
the first performance). It was hard to settle into the music
when the orchestra itself was not yet comfortable with it.
And although Mr. Boehn knew his notes, his was a crabbed,
eyes-to-the-page playing, occasionally exciting in a crude
way, but he never rose to the emotional grandeur of role Mr.
Carter created for him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Boehn was a co-commissioner of the
concerto. That means that while we owe him a debt for
convincing Mr. Carter to write the work, we must regret that
Mr. Boehn has rights for all performances over the next year,
and he expects to take full advantage of them.</p>
<p>The concerto will be performed by Mr. Boehn this weekend
at the Ojai Festival, near Los Angeles, where Mr. Carter will
be composer-in-residence. But there the circumstances will be
quite different. Instead of being squeezed between old
chestnuts, he will be paired with his present-day opposites,
the minimalists. The violin concerto will share the bill at
Ojai with Steve Reich's "The Desert Music."</p>
<p>San Francisco is hopelessly uneasy with this mixing of yin
and yang (the new Marriott's occasional postmodern touches
are so cautiously applied to its basically anonymous interior
that they seem silly). But it goes down much easier in
Southern California. And maybe Mr. Boehn will lighten up a
little in that softer air.</p>
