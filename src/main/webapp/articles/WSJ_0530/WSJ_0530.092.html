	<p class="article-leader">GREAT LAKES BANCORP, Ann Arbor, Mich., said it filed a
registration statement for an offering of as many as 1.5
million preferred units, each consisting of 1/10th share of
noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series A, and one
warrant to purchase one-fourth of a Great Lakes common share.
The underwriters also have been granted a 30-day option to
buy as many as 225,000 additional preferred units. The price
will be $10 a unit; the minimum purchase will be 100 units.
Quarterly dividends will be paid, if declared, at an annual
rate of $10 a preferred share through June 30, 1995.
Subsequently, the dividend rate will adjust quarterly to 250
basis points over the one-year Treasury bill rate, multiplied
by the $100 stated value of the preferred stock; a basis
point is equal to 1/100th of one percentage point. But the
dividend rate for any quarterly period won't amount to less
than $10 a year or greater than $15 a year. The offering will
be underwritten by Roney & Co., Detroit, and Ohio Co.,
Columbus.</p>
