	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices fell back under pressure from
profit-taking and some arbitrage selling, posting their first
loss in six trading days.
   Meanwhile, in London, prices finished mostly higher,
although traders didn't attach too much importance to the
rise, given the thin trading conditions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 373.94 points to
32817.67 Tuesday, after advancing 397.73 points Monday.</p>
<p>In early trading Wednesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index rose
52.52 points to 32870.19.</p>
<p>Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 800
million shares, up from 765 million shares Monday.</p>
<p>Decliners outnumbered advancers 650 to 327, while 154
issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 22.39 points, or 0.92%, to 2411.66, after
gaining 14.11 points Monday.</p>
<p>The second section index, after shedding 8.47 points
Monday, rose 1.99 points, or 0.05%, to 3886.37. Volume was
estimated at 17 million shares, up from 14 million shares
Monday.</p>
<p>After opening just below Monday's closing level, the
Nikkei Index remained on the minus side all day yesterday
before closing near its intraday low.</p>
<p>Declines in index futures preceded those in cash prices.
Sentiment was also hurt by lower bond prices, which fell back
after posting gains for five consecutive trading days, and
the rise of the dollar in the afternoon over the 150-yen
level, traders said.</p>
<p>But profit-taking was prompted mainly by investors'
caution about the fast-paced advances of both the yen and
stock prices in the past week, said Shigeru Akiba, head of
equity trading at UBS Phillips & Drew International.</p>
<p>Traders expected active buying yesterday, the first
trading day for transactions recorded on June accounts. Those
expectations met with active profit-taking, especially by
institutions, the Phillips & Drew trader said.</p>
<p>Some traders said they welcomed the decline after the
Nikkei Index had gained a total of 1426 points, or 4.5%, in
the previous five trading days. "To be honest, the fall was
good for the market," said a senior trader at Wako
Securities.</p>
<p>The selling will result in lower selling pressure in the
future, providing more space for the market to advance, the
trader said.</p>
<p>Steel makers, shipbuilding companies, electric utilities
and construction issues fell yesterday, after advancing
strongly the past week.</p>
<p>Sumitomo Metal dropped 26 yen to 629 yen (17 cents to
$4.20), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries fell 20 yen to 1030 yen.
Tokyo Electric Power slipped 180 yen to 4810 yen.</p>
<p>Among construction issues, Ohbayashi fell 30 yen to 1710
yen, while Taisei shed 30 yen to 1380 yen. Shimizu, however,
added 50 yen to 2090 yen as the company's bright earnings
outlook for the current fiscal year attracted investors,
traders said.</p>
<p>Bank shares were sold following their earning reports
Monday that showed the 13 Tokyo banks posting an average
19.9% decline in annual pretax profits for the latest fiscal
year.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Bank dropped 40 yen to 2530 yen. Fuji Bank
plummeted 60 yen to 2790 yen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, investors hunted for high-technology
shares with strong earnings prospects, traders said. Sony
gained 60 yen to 8660 yen, while Kyocera was up 160 yen to
7870 yen. Sharp added 40 yen to 1840 yen.</p>
<p>In other stock market-related news, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange said that in the week ended Friday, the balance of
margin buying increased 6.8 billion yen to 7.717 trillion
yen. The balance of short positions outstanding, meanwhile,
declined 49 billion yen to 571.5 billion yen.</p>
<p>In London, most of the buying in morning trading was
confined to stock futures, while the market's late afternoon
surge was fueled by Wall Street's rise.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
30 points to 2295.6 points, the intraday high. The index fell
to a low of 2258.7 just after the start of official trading.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index rose 23.3 points to
1823.3. Volume was 330 million shares, compared with 385.6
million issues Friday, the previous trading day.</p>
<p>Traders ascribed the low trading volumes in part to
Monday's public holiday in the U.K., with many participants
apparently extending holiday weekends.</p>
<p>Traders were divided on whether the market can sustain the
robust gains. Some traders pointed to the continued negative
factor of high British interest rates and the onset of
summer, while others noted that trading sentiment is
"reasonably firm."</p>
<p>The latter expected that if the Dow Jones Industrial
Average held steady to the close yesterday, London's FT-SE
100 index could easily breach the psychologically important
2300 mark later in the week.</p>
<p>The few stocks that posted losses yesterday went
ex-dividend. These alone would normally account for a
collective four-point fall on the 100 share index, traders
said.</p>
<p>Gains were broad-based, with no one sector benefiting the
most. Those stocks showing the largest gains included ICI,
which rose 19 pence (32 cents) on speculation that it will
soon dispose of its 25% stake in Enterprise Oil, and British
Aerospace, which benefited from an absence of sellers.
British Aerospace rose 16 pence.</p>
<p>The rise in some other stocks, such as Reuters, which
gained 23 pence, appeared large, but on a percentage basis
was in line with the remainder of the market.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prices closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Brussels, Amsterdam and Milan; and lower in
Stockholm. South African gold stocks closed higher.</p>
<p>In Asian and Pacific markets, stocks closed lower in Hong
Kong and Manila; higher in Sydney, Taipei, Wellington and
Seoul. Singapore shares ended mixed.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
