	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Four major banks have restructured a pending
$1.8 billion loan to Revlon Inc., in the latest sign of
lenders' nervousness about making new loans to heavily
indebted companies.
   Although the changes in the Revlon refinancing are
relatively minor, bankers say they occurred partly in
response to regulatory pressure on banks to limit loans for
highly leveraged transactions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revlon, controlled by New York investor Ronald O.
Perelman, has operated under a heavy debt load ever since a
company controlled by Mr. Perelman acquired Revlon in 1986 in
a hostile takeover financed by high-risk, high-yielding junk
bonds.</p>
<p>The Revlon debt restructuring, first disclosed yesterday
in the American Banker, a trade publication, was forced on
the company and the four banks after other U.S. banks balked
at terms of the new loan. The four banks, units of Chase
Manhattan Corp., Chemical Bank Corp., Citicorp, and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., were seeking to resell parts of
the loan to other banks.</p>
<p>The changes in the borrowing will boost the fees paid to
some banks that participate in the loan, and accelerate the
repayment of part of the loan by Revlon, a maker of
toiletries, cosmetics and other beauty products. The Revlon
borrowing refinances existing Revlon bank debt.</p>
<p>The bulk of the new loans carry an interest rate of 1 1/2
percentage points above the prime rate, a common benchmark
for bank loans; the prime is now 10%. The interest rate
wasn't affected by the restructuring. Revlon has another $800
million in junk bonds outstanding, which yield more than 18%
based on their market prices, indicating some uncertainty
among investors about the company's finances.</p>
<p>The new Revlon debt package consists of $1.25 billion in
term loans plus a $550 million revolving credit without any
set maturity. Originally the term loans had a four-year
maturity, meaning they had to be repaid or refinanced in
1994. To help the banks resell the loans, Mr. Perelman agreed
to repay half the term loan in 1992.</p>
<p>A statement by the four banks said of the Revlon loan: "In
order to respond to current market conditions, Revlon and the
co-agents are making certain structural and pricing
adjustments to the $1.8 billion transaction currently in the
marketplace." The loan is expected to close in June.</p>
<p>Although Revlon confirmed that the terms of the loan have
been changed, a spokesman stressed that the refinancing is
voluntary and that the four lead banks have committed to lend
all the money.</p>
<p>An individual close to the company said the new bank debt
will reduce Revlon's bank interest costs by about one-half a
percentage point. The same person said Revlon's projected
1990 revenue is $2.8 billion, with expected operating cash
flow -- before interest, depreciation, and amortization -- of
more than $400 million.</p>
<p>The amicable revamping of the loan's terms stands in sharp
contrast to a $7 billion bank borrowing for a proposed
takeover of United Airlines parent UAL Corp., which collapsed
last October amid wrangling between two lead banks and UAL
management.</p>
<p>The market for bank loans for leveraged transactions has
grown increasingly wobbly in the past year, during which many
heavily indebted companies have suffered financial reversals
and some have been forced to seek bankruptcy-law protection.
Bank regulators have since launched a crackdown on loans for
highly leveraged transactions.</p>
<p>One banker familiar with the loan said, "There was tougher
going than expected in placing the loan. It's a leveraged
transaction with all the complications therein in a
marketplace with a difficult tone."</p>
