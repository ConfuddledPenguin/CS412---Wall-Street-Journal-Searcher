	<p class="article-leader">Cadbury Schweppes PLC of Britain agreed to buy most of the
soft-drink business of Source Perrier S.A. for #125 million
($211 million). Paris-based Perrier had put the business on
the block long before contamination forced a world-wide
recall of its trademark bubbly water in February.
   Cadbury, a major candy and beverage concern, acquired
almost all of Perrier's non-cola soft drinks for what
analysts say was a slightly higher-than-expected price.
Although Perrier Chairman Gustave Leven said last year that
he sought at least 1.7 billion francs ($300 million), Paris
analysts said they hadn't expected the business to fetch more
than one billion francs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I think that they {Perrier} got a pretty good price,"
said Alain Kerfourn of the brokerage house Sellier S.A., a
Paris unit of Britain's National Westminster Bank. He said
the sale would help Perrier cover the cost of its bubbly
water recall and relaunch, but he added that the benzene
contamination probably didn't affect either the decision to
sell or the price received.</p>
<p>The deal, which is conditional on clearance by French
authorities, is in line with the strategy of both companies.
Perrier has been selling many of its smaller subsidiaries in
recent years, concentrating in areas of strength such as
water and Roquefort cheese. Cadbury, meanwhile, has been
expanding aggressively, with the recent purchase of Procter &
Gamble Co.'s Crush International and of soft drinks in
Portugal and Spain.</p>
<p>Chris Milburn, a Cadbury spokesman, said the deal "gives
us a critical mass in the French soft-drinks market,"
increasing the company's market share there to 16% from just
over 6%. He added that soft-drink consumption in France is
low by U.S. and European standards, "so there is room for us
to develop it."</p>
<p>The acquisition, being made through the purchase of shares
in a Perrier subsidiary, Cie. d'Exploitation de Boissons
Rafraichissantes, includes noncarbonated drink brands called
Oasis, Bali and Atoll, as well as the French bottling rights
to Gini, a lemon-flavored brand Cadbury acquired as part of
the P&G deal. These brands accounted for sales of #91.3
million in 1989, contributing #18 million to Perrier's
soft-drink division. The deal doesn't include Perrier's
license to bottle Pepsi, which is the subject of a legal
tangle between Perrier and PepsiCo Inc.</p>
<p>Cadbury shares were up 13 pence to 347 pence ($5.87) in
late trading in London yesterday.</p>
