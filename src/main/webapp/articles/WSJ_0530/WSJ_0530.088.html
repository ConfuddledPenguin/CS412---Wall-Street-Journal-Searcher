	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Barely a year ago, shipping U.S. computers to
the Soviet nuclear-power industry would have been
unthinkable.
   The U.S. and its allies have blocked sales of such
high-tech gear for years, lest it help Soviet defense. Soviet
weapons designers could log onto the computers, says Frank
Gaffney Jr., a former Pentagon official who currently runs a
conservative Washington think-tank.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We've got to be very chary of providing technology that
is manifestly related to military purposes," he says.</p>
<p>But Mr. Gaffney is fighting a losing battle. A major
liberalization in East-West technology trade is in the works
in Washington, Paris, Bonn, Tokyo and other Western-alliance
capitals. Barring any sudden hitches in superpower relations,
Washington appears likely to approve the sale of six Control
Data Corp. computers to Moscow to analyze safety at Soviet
reactors.</p>
<p>Bush administration officials "are very sympathetic toward
trying to help out" the Soviets on nuclear-power safety, says
a person close to the deliberations. "Nobody wants another
Chernobyl to happen."</p>
<p>The Control Data order is the first of what is likely to
become a flow of technology to the East. With the Cold War
declared over, a secretive organization of the U.S. and its
16 main allies plans to meet June 6-7 in Paris to authorize a
major relaxation in trade restrictions.</p>
<p>For 41 years, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral
Export Controls, or Cocom, has dictated what can be legally
shipped to Communist countries. Though not always fully
enforced, the Cocom guidelines have blocked large-scale
shipments of computers, machine tools and other technological
products to the East, and have hampered Eastern efforts to
acquire Western know-how.</p>
<p>At the Paris meeting, Western officials plan to maintain
the embargo on key technologies but deregulate trade in many
others. East Germany, several Cocom participants say, will
likely be designated a special trade zone, freed from all but
the most important controls. West German companies will be
able to export products to East Germany except those with
obvious military uses, such as certain radars, ultrasonic
sensors for ships and supercomputers. The plan risks allowing
re-export to other Eastern countries, but it is motivated by
pragmatism. With the two Germanys unifying, says one Bonn
official, customs officials couldn't successfully police the
old, strict embargo.</p>
<p>The East-bloc countries will also get new trade
privileges, though not as great as East Germany. Cocom
negotiators tentatively have agreed to allow unregulated
trade in most personal computers, up to 386-model PCs with a
data-processing speed of 275 megabits a second; that is a
nearly four-fold rise in Cocom standards.</p>
<p>More important, the negotiators plan to grant "favorable
consideration" on a case-by-case basis to licensing shipments
of more-powerful computers with processing speeds up to 1,000
megabits; that covers all PCs, most engineering workstations
and minicomputers, and many mainframe computers. Still
undecided is whether to go even further for Poland, Hungary
and Czechoslovakia, to a processing speed of 2,000 megabits,
covering all models except supercomputers and special
mainframes with so-called vector arrays for high-speed number
crunching.</p>
<p>Next week's Paris meeting will also deregulate trade in
many telecommunications products and machine tools; other
products may be liberalized later this year. The Paris
meeting, though important, "is just the beginning," says
another European government official.</p>
<p>In 1987, the U.S., Japan, Britain, France, Italy and West
Germany shipped $1.12 billion of technology products to the
Soviet Union and its allies, according to a recent study by
the Economist Intelligence Unit, a London-based consulting
firm. About a third of that was in computers; nearly half was
from West Germany. Some economists forecast a doubling of
East-West trade.</p>
<p>One certain, immediate result of Cocom liberalization will
be a further surge in joint ventures between East and West
technology companies. Such ventures cost the East-bloc
companies little, and offer Western ones a chance to cash in
later on a reconstructed East. U.S. computer-maker Digital
Equipment Corp., for instance, began its first East-bloc
venture three months ago in Hungary. With Cocom
liberalization coming, "We plan to be moving aggressively
into the rest of Eastern Europe," a spokesman says.</p>
<p>"U.S. companies that come in {to the Soviet Union} for
joint ventures don't want to mess around with Soviet junk"
for computers, says William McHenry, a specialist in Soviet
computing at Georgetown University's School of Business
Administration.</p>
<p>But it isn't all junk in East-bloc computing. The Soviets
make mainframe computers that approach Western speeds, and
the Bulgarians make a supercomputer. But Eastern computers
break down easily, are scarce, and often can't use
performance-boosting Western software. Mr. McHenry says
Soviet mainframes typically need repairs after running for
250 to 500 hours, a fraction of Western standards. He
estimates the Soviets have 500,000 to one million PCs; the
U.S. has about 40 million.</p>
<p>Thus, even a relatively modest rise in East-West computer
trade could make a big difference to some Soviet industries.
The Soviet nuclear-power industry is a prime example. At the
Ignalina nuclear-power station in Lithuania, operators rely
on a Soviet SM-2 computer system that was already six years
behind the West when it was installed in 1981. At a
reactor-training school in Smolensk, operators learn accident
responses on a computer simulator that runs at five million
instructions a second, the power of a moderate Western PC,
Soviet officials say.</p>
<p>Indeed, Western and Soviet nuclear experts say inadequate
computers contributed to the 1986 Chernobyl accident. Says
Nikolai Shteinberg, deputy chairman of the U.S.S.R. State
Committee on Supervision of Nuclear Power Safety: "If the
plant personnel had had enough information {from computers}
on what was happening, I guarantee there would have been no
accident" at Chernobyl.</p>
<p>The Control Data order is for six Cyber 962 mainframes,
five for the country's main reactor-design labs and the sixth
for post-accident research at Chernobyl itself. Mr. Gaffney,
the ex-Pentagon official, contends the computers could end up
being used by military researchers.</p>
<p>But Control Data says it plans safeguards against such
misuse. These include having company staff visit the
computers to check for signs of military usage, and may also
include a software "log" to record the number-crunching being
performed on a machine. Such measures, a spokesman concedes,
can't guarantee against misuse, but they reduce the odds of
it going undetected.</p>
