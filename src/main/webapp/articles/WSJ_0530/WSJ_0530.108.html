	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.'s brokerage
subsidiary and 14 other Drexel units filed under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, joining the parent company and
two other affiliates that previously had filed.
   Meanwhile, Drexel said that John F. Sorte, previously
co-leader of the corporate finance department, is succeeding
Frederick Joseph as chief executive officer of the brokerage
unit, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest filings put practically all of Drexel empire's
assets and liabilities under the control of the federal
bankruptcy court in Manhattan. The filing by the brokerage
unit also opens the door for creditors to more closely
scrutinize -- and possibly recover -- the $250 million in
bonuses Drexel executives received just weeks before the
parent company filed for bankruptcy-law protection. The
bonuses were paid by the brokerage unit and were off-limits
to creditors as long as the unit didn't file a bankruptcy
petition.</p>
<p>"The filing in bankruptcy court will make it easier for
creditors to recover the millions in bonuses that were paid
in the dying days of the empire," said Barry Dichter, of
Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, an attorney for the central
bank of Portugal, a major Drexel creditor.</p>
<p>The parent company filed under Chapter 11 on Feb. 13. At
the time, Drexel said it would liquidate all its assets and
go out of business. In the filing by the brokerage unit,
however, Drexel raised the possibility that it may emerge
from the bankruptcy proceedings as a going concern.</p>
<p>A Drexel spokesman said that under a Chapter 11
reorganization plan, the company now is planning to resume
operating in at least one area of its past financial
services. Although he declined to say what areas might be
considered, he said it wouldn't be as a stock brokerage firm
or commodities broker.</p>
<p>Mr. Sorte, 42 years old, also was elected a director and
senior executive vice president of the parent; Mr. Joseph
continues as president of the parent. Because Mr. Joseph has
come under much criticism for Drexel's demise, the change in
top management lends credence to talk of a Drexel revival
after the bankruptcy proceedings. "This is an indication that
they are serious about emerging as a going concern," Mr.
Dichter said.</p>
<p>In its bankruptcy petition, the brokerage unit -- Drexel's
largest subsidiary -- said it had $2.1 billion in assets and
$1.09 billion in liabilities. The assets include $304 million
owed by the parent company.</p>
<p>The filing said the brokerage firm's largest creditors,
excluding any claims by other Drexel entities, are Equitable
Life Assurance Society, which is owed $20.8 million; New
England Mutual Life, $18.8 million; and Citibank, a unit of
Citicorp, $13.2 million. The claims also include $1 million
owed to Paul Weiss Rifkin Wharton & Garrison, the law firm
representing Mr. Milken, who recently pleaded guilty to
insider-trading related charges.</p>
<p>In connection with the filing, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Howard Buschman III approved the separation of $88.7 million
in funds from the brokerage unit's other assets. The Drexel
spokesman said the funds represent the potential liability
Drexel may owe in possible claims by former customers. In its
filing, the Drexel unit said the Securities and Exchange
Commission informed the company that it wouldn't object to
the Chapter 11 filing as long as the customer funds were
separated and other requirements met.</p>
<p>The filing also said that the brokerage unit and the other
subsidiaries are named as defendants in about 400 lawsuits.
The company said it wouldn't be able to resolve the mounting
litigation unless it reorganizes under Chapter 11. It said
the maturing of obligations to creditors also made the
Chapter 11 filing now necessary.</p>
