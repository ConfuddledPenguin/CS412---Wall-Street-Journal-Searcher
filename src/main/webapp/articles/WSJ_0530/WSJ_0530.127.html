	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- The Canadian government decided to extend a 500
million Canadian dollar (US$423.7 million) credit line to the
Soviet Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs (Vnesheconombank) to
assist the export of Canadian goods and services to the
Soviet Union.
   The decision was announced yesterday, the first day of a
two-day Canadian visit by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
The Soviet leader is to fly to Washington later today for a
five-day U.S. visit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two-year credit line will be "a major asset to develop
trade with the Soviet Union," said Canadian Trade Minister
John Crosbie. It will be provided by a Canadian government
export financing agency, the Export Development Corp.</p>
<p>The corporation will provide financing for as much as 85%
of the value of Canadian goods and services sold to Soviet
customers. Repayment will be made over periods ranging from
three to 8 1/2 years at fixed or floating interest rates.</p>
<p>A Canadian trade official said the credit line will
replace a less-flexible supplier credit protocol with the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Don Mazankowski also disclosed that
Canada and the Soviet Union have held preliminary talks on
the renewal of a grain sales agreement. The existing
five-year agreement, which expires July 31, 1991, calls for
the Soviet Union to buy at least 25 million metric tons of
Canadian wheat and feed grains during the period of the
agreement.</p>
