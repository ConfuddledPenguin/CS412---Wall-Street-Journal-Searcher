	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- William Farley, still pinched by a shortage of
cash in his $1.56 billion acquisition of West Point-Pepperell
Inc., may soon have to battle his bondholders over voting
control of the company.
   Ironically, his most potent weapon in such a fight may be
an outside evaluation suggesting he overpaid for the 1989
acquisition -- making it less advantageous for his creditors
to force him into bankruptcy. West Point-Pepperell is a West
Point, Ga.-based textile company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kidder, Peabody & Co., financial adviser to some of Mr.
Farley's bondholders, suggested to its clients last week that
they seek voting control, one person close to the situation
said. Officials at Kidder declined to comment, except to say
that "no consensus" on strategy has yet been reached among
bondholders. Officials at Farley Inc. declined comment.
Farley Inc. is Mr. Farley's closely held manufacturing
concern, and the overall umbrella company for his business
empire.</p>
<p>Further, Kidder has surprised some bondholders by
estimating West Point-Pepperell's breakup value in the range
of only $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, or up to $500 million
less than its total debt load, sources said. The low
valuation may eliminate one of the bondholders' possible
tactics: forcing Mr. Farley into bankrupcty and liquidating
West Point-Pepperell to recover their investment.</p>
<p>Troubles worsened for Mr. Farley and his creditors in
March when West Point Acquisition Corp., the unit he set up
to buy West Point-Pepperell fell into default on $796 million
in bank debt and missed bondholder interest payments.</p>
<p>Last month, Mr. Farley offered to surrender majority
ownership of West Point-Pepperell, which he fought so hard to
win in a takeover battle last year. But Mr. Farley's offer
would leave him in control of West Point through his
ownership of a series of so-called super-voting privilege
common shares, sources said.</p>
<p>In April, according to people on Wall Street, Mr. Farley
offered certain debt holders a combined stake of 65% in a
restructured version of West Point-Pepperell. The transfer of
the equity stake would help reduce and delay certain interest
payments, sources said.</p>
<p>Though a major setback for Mr. Farley's once-burgeoning
industrial and investment empire, the exchange offer to
bondholders nevertheless may be the only strategy to keep him
out of bankruptcy-law proceedings. But if Kidder's low
valuation of West Point-Pepperell is accurate, Mr. Farley may
avoid a bankruptcy-law filing for now because he apparently
overpaid for his takeover target.</p>
<p>Mr. Farley has completed his tender offer on 95% of West
Point-Pepperell, but he is about $83 million short of the
cash needed to complete the transaction for 100% control.
Sources close to the transaction said his bankers, led by
Wells Fargo & Co., San Francisco, and Bankers Trust Co., are
likely to loan him the cash needed to close the deal if
holders of West Point Acquisition bonds agree to the
debt-for-equity exchange. Bankers Trust is a unit of New
York-based Bankers Trust New York Corp.</p>
<p>Kidder's recommendations to bondholders are generally
conciliatory, sources said. They added that bondholders'
negotiations with Mr. Farley over restructuring ownership of
West Point-Pepperell may take several months.</p>
<p>Mr. Farley's financial strength ebbed earlier this year
with the collapse of his investment banker, Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. His Farley Inc. had a pretax loss of about $40
million in 1989, analysts estimate.</p>
