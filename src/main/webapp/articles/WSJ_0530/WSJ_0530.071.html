	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Britain's first-quarter real gross domestic
product, measured by the output of goods and services, rose a
preliminary 0.4% from the fourth quarter and 1.5% from a year
earlier, the Central Statistics Office said.
   The output-based GDP is considered the most reliable guide
to short-term movements in the economy. Britain also
calculates GDP based on expenditure and income data, and
publishes an average estimate of the three GDP measures,
which is considered the best guide to long-term movements in
the economy.</p>
