	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Tired of listening to your broker? Try your
banker.
   In a bid to capture another slice of the securities
industry's customer base, Chase Manhattan Corp. is embarking
on a plan to open a nationwide system of "investment service
centers" where well-off -- but not truly wealthy --
individuals can go for investment advice. The first of 10
planned offices opened recently in Dallas, with others
scheduled for this year in upscale locales such as Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., Beverly Hills, Calif., and San Francisco.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The idea is to attract to the somewhat more spartan
offices of Chase Investment Services individuals who would be
persona non grata in the plush environs of so-called private
banks at Chase and other banking institutions. The basic
entry fee is a net worth of $100,000, excluding a house. This
is considerably less than that needed to open the door at
Chase's private banking department -- $250,000 in annual
income, or $1 million in net worth, or $500,000 in investable
assets.</p>
<p>Some banks already offer discount brokerage services for
investors who make their own investment decisions, and many
will manage your money, if it is sufficiently large, through
their trust departments. What Chase will offer at its centers
is investment advice.</p>
<p>"There are very large numbers of people out there who are
making a good salary and all of a sudden have a couple of
hundred thousand dollars, but nobody to tell them who they
should have managing it or why," says Leonard Spalding, the
head of Chase's investment services division. He is a former
executive vice president at Kemper Financial Services who
joined Chase earlier this year.</p>
<p>While Chase won't manage those individuals' funds, it will
tell them who should. Mr. Spalding has an agreement with RCB
International Inc. in Stamford, Conn., which evaluates and
selects money managers for pension funds, to provide the same
kind of advice for Chase clients.</p>
<p>Using RCB's ratings, Chase will steer a new client to the
mutual fund or money manager that best suits the client's
investmest philosophy. With Chase backing them, investors
will have access to some top-flight money managers who might
not otherwise deign to take on such paltry sums. Once
invested, clients will receive quarterly statements from
Chase not only summarizing their account balances, but also
giving the money manager's views on what is happening in the
stock market and the economy.</p>
<p>"The bulk of clients we'll have are serious about their
money, and they're not into `get rich quick' schemes," Mr.
Spalding says. "They're looking for a lot of advice. They
want to know who is managing their money and how. If a money
manager doesn't want to provide us with that information,
then we wouldn't use him."</p>
<p>Chase will charge about the same fees for putting clients
into mutual funds as brokers would. For individuals who want
a money manager, the fee is 2% to 2.5% of assets under
management. Chase also will sell Treasury and municipal bonds
in the investment centers. Unlike private banks, Chase
Investment Services won't make loans.</p>
<p>Performance? Don't expect top-of-the-heap returns. "We're
looking for performance, obviously, to be adequate and
probably superior to others offering similar products," Mr.
Spalding says. "But they don't have to be the best, because
in many cases, the best returns are achieved with a lot more
risk than most people would be willing to accept if they
understood what was happening."</p>
