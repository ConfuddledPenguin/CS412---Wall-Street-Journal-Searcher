	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The new head of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s
brokerage and money-management businesses said he aims to
restore morale of his 10,000-broker sales force.
   Jonathan S. Linen, currently a top executive at American
Express Co., Shearson's parent, was named to the new position
at struggling Shearson; the move officially takes effect next
week. The appointment by American Express was expected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"You've got a great institution here with a lot of great
people who've been struggling in an environment {on Wall
Street} that's a little bit debilitating, without a great
deal of consumer confidence," Mr. Linen said in an interview.</p>
<p>He said it was too early to discuss if Shearson might
close more than the 67 brokerage offices it already has this
year, leaving 450. But Mr. Linen added: "All bets are open
right now."</p>
<p>Mr. Linen, 46 years old, was head of the traveler's
checks, direct marketing and publishing group of American
Express Travel Related Services Co. At Shearson, he will have
the title of president and chief executive officer of the
Private Client Group and asset management businesses.</p>
<p>Mr. Linen's appointment anticipates the planned split-up
of Shearson into two halves: its brokerage network and
money-management businesses that he will head, and its
investment banking and trading operations. The split-up is
part of American Express's efforts to reorganize and revive
Shearson, which had an industry record loss of $915 million
in the first quarter because of retrenchment expenses.</p>
<p>After talking with many of Shearson's 10,000 brokers
yesterday, Mr. Linen acknowledged that broker morale isn't
ideal. "My perception is, based on a day on the job, that
things aren't settled down yet," he said. His goal: "Make
money and have fun."</p>
<p>Mr. Linen will report to Howard L. Clark Jr., a former
American Express chief financial officer, who remains
Shearson's chairman. Mr. Clark said in a statement that Mr.
Linen's "customer and quality driven management philosophy
will find a receptive audience here at Shearson Lehman, as we
all work to strengthen our position as a premier securities
firm."</p>
<p>Mr. Linen said that he has "no illusions" about his lack
of brokerage-industry experience, but that his
consumer-marketing experience will help him. Asked if he can
hold his own with Shearson's independent-minded brokers. Mr.
Linen said he thought he could. "Try dealing with 1,500
travel agents," he joked.</p>
<p>In his new post, Mr. Linen succeeds Hardwick Simmons, head
of the Private Client Group, who resigned last week. The
asset-management businesses had been reporting to Shearson
Vice Chairman Herbert Freiman, who remains head of Shearson's
capital-commitment committee.</p>
<p>American Express this year has shaken up Shearson
management, pumped more than $1 billion into the brokerage
firm to replenish its capital base and announced plans to
acquire the Shearson common stock that it doesn't already
own.</p>
