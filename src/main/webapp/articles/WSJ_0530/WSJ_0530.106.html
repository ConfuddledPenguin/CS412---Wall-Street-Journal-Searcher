	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Washington Bancorp. said it plans to issue
$45 million in new secured debt to private investors to ease
the bank holding company's current liquidity crunch.
   The new debt will be secured by virtually all the assets
of the company, and the investors will receive warrants to
acquire a "major" stock interest, the amount of which is
still being negotiated. John M. Toups, chairman and chief
executive officer, said he was not pleased about the likely
dilution of the common stock, but added, "You've got to offer
something."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier this month, Washington Bancorp. said it wouldn't
be able to repay about $36.7 million of unsecured commercial
paper obligations because certain credit lines were cut off.</p>
<p>While purchasers for all of the new bonds have not yet
been found, those committed to buying a portion of the notes
include Wafic Said, whose family trust and related entities
own about 27% of the company, and John J. Mason, who owns a
6.4% stake.</p>
<p>After the immediate liquidity needs of the company are
met, Washington Bancorp. plans to raise additional funds by
issuing more equity, probably through a rights offering, Mr.
Toups said.</p>
<p>Mr. Toups added that the company is scaling back its
operations to reduce its capital needs, particularly by
getting out of the mortgage banking and venture-capital
businesses. "We're going to stay close to home," Mr. Toups
said.</p>
