	<p class="article-leader">BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Tektronix Inc., the embattled
electronics testing and measurement concern, said it will lay
off at least 1,300 employees by August, sell or shut down
several of its business lines, and take a $70 million charge
in its fiscal fourth quarter as a result of this major
restructuring.
   Tektronix also said that negotiations have fallen through
in its efforts to sell its Grass Valley Group subsidiary to
Sony Corp. The company couldn't get Sony to agree to an
acceptable price.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is one of those companies that really got swallowed
and chewed up by the '80s," says Stephen Balog of Shearson
Lehman Hutton, who follows Tektronix closely.</p>
<p>The company failed years earlier to jump into areas like
computer-aided software and workstations when it had the
chance, Mr. Balog says, adding, "The whole Apollo-Sun
Microsystems thing could have been them."</p>
<p>Instead, the company's earnings have been declining since
1985, and in its last year the company sustained its first
annual loss since the company was founded in 1946. In its
latest fiscal third quarter, Tektronix reported a $25 million
net loss. Its stock fell to a 14-year low this winter, where
it currently remains. And in April, its president David
Friedley resigned under pressure, when the board decided he
wasn't reorganizing the company fast enough.</p>
<p>Tektronix won't reveal which business lines it
specifically intends to sell for several weeks, but a company
spokesman said all will be in "non-core" fields in the
company's test and measurement and non-television related
communication groups. Depending on which divisions the
company sells, the number of layoffs may be higher, the
spokesman said.</p>
<p>The layoffs, which represent 10 percent of Tektronix's
work force, comes on the heels of labor cuts of 1,400 other
jobs in the last fiscal year. The company shut down its plant
in Guernsey, one of the U.K.'s Channel Islands in January,
dismissing 220 employees. Then its facilities in Clark
County, Wash., were closed; about 50 employees lost their
jobs and the rest were transferred.</p>
<p>The layoffs will be especially painful for the Portland,
Ore., area, where 1,000 of the latest dismissals are expected
to take place. Tektronix is the largest manufacturing
employer in the state and the second largest private
employer.</p>
<p>Laid-off employees, who will be notified by the end of
June, will range from managers to production line workers to
support staff, a company spokesman said. They will receive
one week's pay for every year of service.</p>
<p>The last few years has brought the greatest travails for
Tektronix as its new products generated killer costs,
production snafus and a cool reception from customers. The
company belatedly entered the workstation business, for
example, only to be 18 months late in bringing its product to
market.</p>
<p>The effort to finance new products has taxed the company's
resources. "To cap it all off, the enormous levels of funding
have probably hurt their ability to manage their
bread-and-butter business," says Richard Chu, an analyst who
follows the company for Cowen & Co. And the nearly $200
million a year the company is spending on research and
development has so far yielded little in the way of lucrative
business opportunities.</p>
<p>Ironically, in the 1970s, Tektronix designed what was one
of the first engineering workstations ever, but the company
never got it off the production line. "The product was
reasonably successful and they went on to do a more powerful
version, along the lines of Apollo," recalls Thomas Bruggere,
chief executive officer of Mentor Graphics, who was a
software engineer manager at Tektronix at the time, in the
division designing the workstation. "They had, at least,
enough vision to realize this was a product worth doing. But
they didn't have enough execution to get it out the door."</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Tektronix rose to $15.375, up $1.</p>
