	<p class="article-leader">BROOKLYN UNION GAS Co. (Brooklyn, N.Y.) -- Standard &
Poor's Corp. said it reduced its ratings on this utility's
senior secured and senior unsecured debt and preferred stock
to single-A from single-A-plus. The rating concern also
downgraded Brooklyn Union Gas's commercial paper rating to
single-A-1 from single-A-1- plus. S&P said, "The downgrades
reflect the company's weak financial profile relative to the
former ratings, in large part due to less than supportive
regulatory decisions by the New York State Public Service
Commission."</p>
