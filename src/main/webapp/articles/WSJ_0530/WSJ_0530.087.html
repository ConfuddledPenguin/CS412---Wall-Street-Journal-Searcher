	<p class="article-leader">DES MOINES, Iowa -- Former state Senate Majority Leader
Lowell Junkins lost the gubernatorial race here four years
ago but settled on a second career: He became a political
strategist and lobbyist and today roams the Capitol on behalf
of a chemical company, a pharmaceutical giant, some banking
interests and the Iowa Community College Trustees
Association.
   Such a transformation has long been a staple of Washington
life, but only recently have legislative leaders, governors
and other political officeholders found that the road from a
political loss can lead directly to the lobbies of the state
capitols.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The explosion of lobbying at the state level is a
testament to the growing roles that the state legislatures
are facing in an era when the idiom of deregulation is being
spoken in Washington, when federal funds are drying up and
when the stakes in state issues -- the environment, consumer
affairs, business issues -- are growing. The prospect that
the state might institute new regulations on automobile
rentals in Florida, for example, prompted car-rental
companies to hire more than 40 lobbyists in Tallahassee this
spring.</p>
<p>"Any large company that isn't represented in the Capitol
is running around nude," says Richard Thornton, a Des Moines
lobbyist whose clients include Allied Mutual Insurance Co.,
American Express Co., Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., and Delta
Queen Steamboat Co. "With deregulation and all of these
issues floating around, there's always someone who's ready to
take a shot at you -- or to tax you."</p>
<p>This year, Hill & Knowlton, the public-relations
powerhouse that has long had a lobbying presence in
Washington, opened offices in Tallahassee; Albany, N.Y.;
Sacramento, Calif.; Springfield, Ill.; and Austin, Texas.
More offices in state capitals are planned for next year.
"The stakes are higher," says Alan Rosenthal, director of the
Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, "and
people know they can do better with lobbyists than they can
do themselves."</p>
<p>Political reforms have been instituted in recent years to
clean up state legislatures. No longer, for example, do
lobbyists from the Farm Bureau and the Iowa Association of
Business and Industry stride into the legislative chambers
here and give hand signals to instruct lawmakers how to vote.</p>
<p>But now the growth of lobbying is fundamentally altering
the character of these legislatures, which for a long time
were popularly regarded as unsophisticated citizen assemblies
and political backwaters. "We're witnessing the
congressionalization of state legislatures," says Iowa House
Speaker Donald Avenson, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate
in next month's primary.</p>
<p>Moreover, the growth in state lobbying -- the number of
registered lobbyists in Iowa has doubled since 1984 -- is
prompting a growing skepticism of lobbyists here and in other
state capitals. "I won't have anything to do with them," says
Democratic state Rep. Dennis Black of Newton, Iowa. "There
are too many people working on us, and no good can come from
all these people running around the hall."</p>
<p>The changes that lobbyists are bringing to state
legislatures are worrying even some of the former lawmakers
who have profited by the lobbying boom.</p>
<p>"Candidates for state offices are turning to lobbyists for
money," says Mr. Junkins, the former Senate leader who now
does lobbying and political strategy for Du Pont Co. and
Pfizer Inc. "I don't see people who are making commitments
for the money, but the day will come."</p>
<p>Mr. Avenson, for example, has accepted about $44,000 from
various interests, primarily labor groups. GOP Gov. Terry
Branstad, drawing primarily on business and industry groups,
has accepted about $17,000. "People aren't saying that
they'll do something if you give them money," Mr. Junkins
says. "But if you ask for $5,000 from a stranger, it's
relatively clear there's an understanding. They wouldn't be
giving the money if there weren't."</p>
<p>Lawmakers dismiss the notion that the role lobbyists are
playing is tainting votes in the chamber.</p>
<p>"We all raise money -- we have to -- but we don't tie it
to votes," says Florida Senate President Bob Crawford, a
14-year veteran of the legislature. "Lobbyists who try to tie
votes to campaign contributions can inflict a lot of damage
to the institution." Willie Brown, speaker of the California
Assembly, adds: "The advice given by lobbyists is usually to
pay them first and contribute to campaigns later."</p>
<p>Indeed, lobbying has turned into a growth industry. "I'm
amazed at the amount of money you can make," says Bruce
Bereano, who lobbies in Maryland's capital of Annapolis for
53 clients ranging from the Tobacco Institute to Weight
Watchers International. Last year Mr. Bereano reported fees
of $1,034,158.</p>
<p>As the lobbying surge continues at the state level, a
number of organizations have sprung up to take advantage of
new business opportunities in state capitals.</p>
<p>The Legislative Information Network Corp., an Austin-based
company, is creating a computer data base to track bills,
amendments and even committee votes in all 50 state
legislatures. Multi-State Associates, a Great Neck, N.Y.,
company, has developed a network of 1,500 professional
lobbyists across the country and last year did close to $5
million in lobbying services.</p>
<p>Businesses turn to these lobbying companies because they
can't keep up with government activities in 50 separate
arenas.</p>
<p>"At the state level, things move with frightening speed,"
says Stephen Lisson, the president of Legislative Information
Network Corp. "At the federal level committees are kicking
out one bill a year. In individual states, you have dozens of
committees kicking out hundreds of bills within a few
months."</p>
<p>Some of those involved in the new lobbying believe that
the increased attention devoted to lobbying efforts has
cleansed the process, stripping away the mystery and the
secrecy that surrounded lobbying for decades.</p>
<p>"There's more lobbying, but the lobbying is more open than
it was in the old days," says Edward Campbell, a former Iowa
Democratic chairman who today lobbies for companies such as
Anheuser Busch Cos., IBP Inc., First Banks of Minneapolis and
Star Coal Co. "There used to be only the railroads and the
bankers and the utility companies and people like that," says
Mr. Campbell. "They ran the show. They walked on the floor.
Now there are more than 400 of us, and we can't walk on the
floor."</p>

<p>                 The Lobbying Surge</p>
<p>The number of registered lobbyists has increased in many
states. Because lobby registration regulations are loose and
vary from state to state, these figures in many cases
substantially understate the number of lobbyists working in
the state capitals. Some of the figures are estimates.</p>
