	<p class="article-leader">It was interesting to read "Texas Receives a Counter
Offer: It Can Have the Salem Witch Trials" (April 30).
Interesting, because on April 28 a few members of the
Hispanic Family History Researchers based in Orange County,
Calif., presented a dramatic re-enactment of "Thanksgiving
1598." Eight members of the cast are descendants of those
original Onate colonizers, with some of us playing the parts
of our 13th-great-grandparents.
   As a native of New Mexico, I have done considerable family
research in tracing my roots back four centuries in America.
Through my research, I learned about the first Thanksgiving.
Mimi Lozano-Holtzman wrote the script for "Thanksgiving
1598," and with the cast in full costume we entertained the
audience with the "first act of Thanksgiving recorded in the
continental United States by Europeans."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The spokesman whom you quote is correct in saying "The
Pilgrims were never there," but could have elaborated and
said that they were still in England being persecuted for
their religious beliefs. In 1608 they fled to Holland, and it
would be an additional 12 years before they could get passage
to the East Coast of this continent.</p>
<p>I agree, we don't have a Plymouth Rock in New Mexico, but
we have a Mount Robledo, and it was in the shadow of this
peak that my 13th-great-grandfather is buried. His name was
Pedro Robledo, born in Maqueda, Spain, in 1539.</p>
<p>With the Quintcentennial around the corner, it is my wish
that the many contributions of the Spanish finally will be
manifested, and I for one will be delighted to celebrate the
first Thanksgiving on April 30 and the second one in
November.</p>
