	<p class="article-leader">Mark IV Industries Inc. said its Dayco subsidiary reached
a five-year agreement with the United Rubber Workers to end a
24-day strike at its Waynesville, N.C., plant.
   Mark IV said it expects first-quarter earnings to be
reduced by about $650,000, or four cents per fully diluted
share, from the strike. But the quarter's earnings should
"compare favorably" to last year, said Sal H. Alfiero, Mark
IV chairman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-ago quarter, the Amherst, N.Y.-based maker of
industrial products earned net income of $6.1 million, or 58
cents a share. On a fully diluted basis, the year-ago net was
50 cents a share. The year-ago figures include a gain of
$700,000 on the sale of securities.</p>
<p>No terms of the labor pact were disclosed, but company
officials called it a "non-inflationary" pact that would make
the Waynesville facility more competitive.</p>
