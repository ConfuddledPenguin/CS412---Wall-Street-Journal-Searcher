	<p class="article-leader">Federal Express Corp., overcoming a hurdle that has caused
inefficiencies for the struggling company, said a government
arbitrator cleared the way for the merger of its pilot
seniority list with the seniority list of pilots acquired
with Tiger International Corp.
   But the good news for the company isn't being greeted that
way by some of the affected pilots.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Memphis, Tenn., air express giant has been operating
with two separate pilot lists since buying Tiger last year,
pending arbitration. The company's inability to merge its
roughly 2,000-person pilot force -- comprised of roughly half
former Tiger aviators -- has hampered Federal Express's
efforts to meld the Tiger fleet into its own air operations,
costing the company as much as $150 million a year in
possible savings, analysts have estimated.</p>
<p>"The decision will now permit the company to integrate the
two pilot groups and achieve greater efficiencies in its air
operations," said Frederick W. Smith, Federal Express's
chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>But arbitrator George Nicoloau's ruling hasn't ended the
bitter strife within the company over the pilot
seniority-list question. Many longtime Federal Express pilots
fell hundreds of places on the new, merged list, fanning
already bitter feelings over a promise they say Federal made
to them several years ago to "end-tail" -- or put at the
bottom of the list -- aviators acquired in future mergers or
acquisitions. The issue has become a staple gripe at informal
meetings being held on the possible organization of an
independent pilots' union at the company.</p>
<p>"I feel like we got cheated again," said Richard Sowers, a
Boeing 727 first officer who fell from 642 on the old list to
1,143 on the merged list. "The Fed Ex pilots are the nicest
guys in the world to fly with, but they're so naive it's
embarrassing."</p>
<p>Mr. Sowers has filed suit against Federal, claiming the
company violated its employment contract with pilots by not
end-tailing the Tiger aviators and by agreeing to let the
arbitrator merge the new pilots into Federal's list. A U.S.
district court judge in Reno, Nev., is expected to rule next
month on a Federal Express motion to dismiss the case.</p>
<p>But yesterday, as the arbitrator's seniority list arrived
at pilots' homes by mail, Mr. Sowers's lawyer, Leo Donahue of
Sacramento, Calif., said he received calls from some 15
disappointed Federal pilots inquiring how they can join the
suit. Yesterday's calls were on top of dozens of prior
inquiries from pilots in recent weeks, he said.</p>
<p>"If we get through the motion {for dismissal}, we estimate
we'll have the majority of the crew force in the suit," said
Mr. Donahue.</p>
<p>A Federal spokeswoman declined to comment on the
litigation, but Mr. Smith has said the contract with the
company's pilots wasn't meant to limit Federal's flexibility
in a merger.</p>
<p>Gregory Chappars, a 727 captain who went from 284 on the
old list to 515 on the merged list, praised the fairness of
the arbitrator's list, but said some Federal pilots are angry
with the company's recent attempts to change work rules. In
the wake of five consecutive quarters of falling year-to-year
profits, the company has moved to revoke some of the very
vacation perks that management praised so heartily during a
union-affiliation drive last fall, Mr. Chappars said.
Pro-union pilots were trounced in that election.</p>
<p>"As soon as the union vote was over," said Mr. Chappars,
who said he voted against the union, "they started seeking to
modify those various policies to make working conditions more
onerous." Federal Express officials couldn't be reached for
comment late yesterday evening.</p>
