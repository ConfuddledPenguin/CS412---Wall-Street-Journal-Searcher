	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Judith E. Fellheimer resigned her top
management position at Equimark Corp., bringing a surprise
end to the bank holding company's controversial husband-wife
management team.
   The departure of Mrs. Fellheimer, who is credited with
helping her husband, Alan S. Fellheimer, save Equimark after
he became chairman in 1985, comes several months after she
was promoted to vice chairman of the bank's main subsidiary,
Equibank. And it comes amid growing turmoil at the bank. In
recent weeks, Equimark has had to abort its nine-month effort
to acquire a Texas bank, has dismissed a half-dozen senior
managers and has seen its stock price continue to erode.
Rumors have also circulated that the bank will be put up for
sale, but Mr. Fellheimer says he has no such plans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday's announcement marks a stunning personal change
for the Fellheimers. When the couple married 15 years ago,
they pledged they would be business partners forever, and
until yesterday had kept that vow.</p>
<p>In separate interviews, the Fellheimers said the
resignation reflects broad cost-cutting measures that the
bank, which had a $15.4 million loss in the last quarter, has
been forced to take. A total of about 20 managers had already
been dismissed, but more cuts were needed.</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer said his wife "technically agreed to be
terminated, but without cause." He indicated that she would
be given a yet-to-determined severance package from the
board.</p>
<p>The Fellheimers said yesterday's decision was made
jointly.</p>
<p>"What kind of pigs would we be in letting all these good
people go and the Fellheimer family keeping two salaries?"
Mr. Fellheimer asked. "It will be the first time since we've
been together that we won't be working together, and I'm not
happy about it."</p>
<p>Mrs. Fellheimer, who was one of the company's highest paid
executives with a $319,952 annual salary, said: "It just felt
wrong for both of us to stay at the company when it meant
that someone else who is loyal wouldn't be able to stay. It
just didn't have that evenhanded feel to it."</p>
<p>The 47-year-old Mrs. Fellheimer, a tough, self-confident
and hard-driving executive, has served in numerous high-level
positions at Equimark. Prior to her promotion to vice
chairman of the bank's main unit, Mrs. Fellheimer, a lawyer
by training, was head of two Equimark units: Equimanagement,
which turned around several small ailing banks, and Treasure
Valley Bank in Idaho.</p>
<p>The Fellheimers joined Equimark as turnaround specialists
in 1985 when federal regulators were threatening to shut down
the bank unit. Mrs. Fellheimer's high-level profile in the
company stirred controversy among some investors and analysts
who believed a husband-wife management team created a
conflict of interest. The Fellheimers always defended the
arrangement, saying that as principal shareholders in the
company no one had a greater stake in its management than
they. Together, the Fellheimers hold nearly 13% of the
company's voting stock.</p>
<p>But Mr. Fellheimer acknowledged yesterday that criticism
of the husband-wife team had intensified since the recent
layoffs began. The retrenchment followed Equimark's aborted
$116 million acquisition of National Bancshares Corp. of
Texas. Equimark, which has about $3.8 billion in assets, had
built a staff assuming the National Bancshares deal would be
completed. When it fell through, the bank had to slim down.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fellheimer said she'll try to find a job in
litigation or real estate. Her husband dismissed the notion
that she left the company because of any problems in their
personal lives. "Judy and I are very much in love," he said.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Equimark shares closed at $8.125, unchanged.</p>
