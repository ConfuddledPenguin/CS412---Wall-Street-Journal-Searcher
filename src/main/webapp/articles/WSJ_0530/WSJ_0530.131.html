	<p class="article-leader">CANTON, Ohio -- Timken Co. purchased MPB Corp. for $185
million, moving the big maker of tapered roller bearings and
specialty steels into the precision aircraft bearings market.
   MPB, which has annual sales of more than $120 million and
employs 1,850 people at plants in Keene and Lebanon, N.H., is
a major supplier of ball and roller bearings for aircraft
engines and aircraft and missile control systems. Its
bearings also are used in computer disk drives, X-ray
equipment and other precision instruments, but aircraft is
the major market, Timken said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Timken's bearings are used in automobiles, trucks,
industrial machinery and other equipment, but the company
hasn't previously participated in the precision bearings
business, said Joseph F. Toot Jr., president. He said Timken
is aware that a defense spending cutback may cut into MPB's
business, but he said strong commercial aircraft sales and
increased applications in other precision equipment will
offset any loss of defense business.</p>
<p>Timken bought MPB for cash, and the price included the
cost of retiring the concern's debt, Mr. Toot said. He said
the acquisition won't dilute Timken's earnings.</p>
<p>There are no plans to move any of the MPB operations nor
to change the company's management, said Peter J. Ashton,
Timken executive vice president, bearings. Thomas Uhlig is
president and chief executive officer of MPB, Mr. Ashton
said.</p>
