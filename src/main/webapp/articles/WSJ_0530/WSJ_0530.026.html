from March, but were up 3.5% from a year earlier, according
to Statistics Sweden.
   The national statistics agency said export prices also
remained unchanged in April from March, but were up 2.1% from
the previous year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, import prices slipped by 0.5% in April from
March and were down 0.4% from the year before. The drop in
import prices was mainly a result of falling crude-oil
prices, Statistics Sweden said.</p>
