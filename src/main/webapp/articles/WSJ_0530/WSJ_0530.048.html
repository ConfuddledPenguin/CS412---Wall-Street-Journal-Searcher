	<p class="article-leader">Derek Bok said he will step down as president of Harvard
University at the end of the next academic year, ending one
of the longest-running tenures at the helm of a major
university.
   Mr. Bok, 60 years old, became the latest in a string of
top Harvard managers to announce their resignation over the
last year or so, and left a major question as to who his
successor will be. One person formerly thought of as a
leading candidate for the post, A. Michael Spence, resigned
as dean of Harvard's faculty of arts and sciences in March to
be dean of the business school at Stanford University,
perhaps Harvard's closest rival for eminence among U.S.
colleges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bok, who has been president since 1971, said that at
the end of 20 years, he believed Harvard needed fresh energy
to see it through a major fund-raising drive for about $2
billion that is expected to start within the next few months.
He said he hasn't yet settled on his plans after next year,
although he is tenured on Harvard's law faculty and has been
offered a University Professorship that would give him
freedom to teach in other areas.</p>
<p>"With the prospect of a major fund-raising campaign coming
up, I think it's best to get some new leadership that will
see us through that effort," said Mr. Bok. "I really didn't
think I wanted to spend another seven or eight years in this
position."</p>
<p>Asked whether the fund-raising drive wouldn't be
handicapped by the loss of him and Mr. Spence, Mr. Bok said
he believed it was better for him to leave now than in the
midst of the campaign. Two of Harvard's top graduate schools,
government and law, also changed leadership in the last year,
creating an unusual number of new faces in management posts.</p>
<p>Some outsiders, who had expected Mr. Bok to see through
the fund-raising drive, said the timing of the resignation
was unexpected.</p>
<p>"It's really surprising. There's no real milestone that
would explain this now," said Leon Botstein, the president of
Bard College in Allandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. Mr. Botstein and
others credited Mr. Bok with steering Harvard successfully
through a difficult period, characterized by radical student
protest at its beginning and serious attacks by the federal
government in more recent years.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Bok, Harvard revamped its curriculum for
undergraduates, creating a much-copied "core" of required
classes in the sciences and humanities that required about a
quarter of students' time. He also guided the development of
the Kennedy School of Government into a major graduate school
and created a new office to manage the university's
endowment, which grew to over $5 billion from $1 billion
during his tenure.</p>
<p>In 1986, Mr. Bok debated William Bennett, then U.S.
secretary of education, who argued that Harvard and other
prestige schools were charging too much and weren't
adequately teaching the classic tenets of Western
civilization. Last year, the U.S. Justice Department began an
investigation of possible tuition and financial-aid
price-fixing at Harvard and about 50 other private schools.</p>
<p>Harvard said it will form a committee to search for Mr.
Bok's successor. Handicappers said a leading candidate could
be Henry Rosovsky, Mr. Spence's predecessor as dean of the
faculty of arts and sciences, who also has been acting in
that capacity since Mr. Spence left.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Bok, Mr. Rosovsky helped design the core
curriculum and was well-liked by senior faculty for upholding
Harvard's tough tenure policies, which have been criticized
as being too restrictive to junior faculty and hard to
overcome by minorities and women.</p>
