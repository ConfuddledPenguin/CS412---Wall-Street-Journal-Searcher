	<p class="article-leader">A Connecticut state court judge allowed Kollmorgen Corp.'s
issuance of some preferred stock to an investor group, but he
ordered the company to pay legal fees for Vernitron Corp.'s
attempt to block the transaction.
   Vernitron, a closely held Deer Park, N.Y., manufacturer of
motors and controls, has been trying to gain control of
Simsbury, Conn.-based Kollmorgen, which has similar
interests. Vernitron, which controls almost 6% of Kollmorgen,
has made a $15-a-share takeover proposal for half of
Kollmorgen's remaining shares outstanding and is waging a
proxy fight for control of its board. The companies are also
locked in litigation over a merger they earlier had agreed
upon; the plan collapsed last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In March, Kollmorgen sold the preferred, which is
convertible into 11.9% of the company on a fully diluted
basis, for $23.2 million to the investors. Vernitron sued to
block the issuance.</p>
<p>Superior Court Judge Nicholas Cioffi said that the
investor group could vote the preferred at the annual meeting
tomorrow, but he said Kollmorgen should have submitted the
stock-issuance plan to the court for review before it was
completed. Kollmorgen plans to appeal the award of legal
fees.</p>
<p>In allowing the stock issuance to stand, Judge Cioffi
followed the recommendations of a panel of special masters he
had appointed to help resolve the dispute over the preferred.</p>
<p>The next step in the matter is tomorrow's vote by
Kollmorgen's shareholders for a board of directors. One
question is how Mario Gabelli, the New York money manager,
will vote the 16.29% Kollmorgen stake he controls.</p>
<p>Mr. Gabelli couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Vernitron said yesterday that if its slate of directors is
elected, the new board would allow possible buyers of
Kollmorgen to submit takeover proposals either to the board
or directly to shareholders.</p>
<p>Vernitron said that Kollmorgen currently requires
interested buyers to submit their proposals to the board, but
Kollmorgen called the assertion incorrect and said the
current board gives potential suitors the same two options.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Kollmorgen shares closed at $10.75, down 25 cents.</p>
