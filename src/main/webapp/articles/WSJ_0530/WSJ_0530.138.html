	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Cie. Generale d'Electricite's unfriendly effort
to control Framatome S.A., France's large builder of nuclear
power plants, may be fading.
   Credit Lyonnais, a large state-owned bank allied with
Framatome management, announced that it has begun an effort
to restructure Framatome's shareholding. Government and
business officials here say the effort has the Finance
Ministry's backing, and is aimed at keeping Framatome
independent of CGE. Credit Lyonnais said CGE's departure from
Framatome is just one working hypothesis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CGE, an electric-equipment company, specializes in
telephone equipment, high-speed trains and electric power
equipment. In that last capacity, it works closely with
Framatome, and CGE long has viewed Framatome as a logical
subsidiary.</p>
<p>CGE, in a surprise announcement, said it is prepared to
discuss all proposals, including the sale of its current 40%
Framatome stake. Government sources say CGE Chairman Pierre
Suard is expected to meet with Finance Minister Pierre
Beregovoy to discuss possible terms for CGE to sell some or
all of its stake to Credit Lyonnais.</p>
<p>Various government and business officials stressed that a
solution hasn't yet been reached. But if CGE were to sell, it
would reflect a defeat for the huge company, which for years
has sought to control Framatome.</p>
