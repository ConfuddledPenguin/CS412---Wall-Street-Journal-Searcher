	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The yen reversed its recent course, falling
against the mark and dollar on the belief that its gains late
last week were overdone in light of lingering uncertainty
about yen investments.
   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quoted
at 1.6740 marks, down from 1.6824 marks late Friday, and at
151.25 yen, up from 149.40 yen late Friday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6940, up from $1.6905.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At mid-morning Wednesday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading
at 150.75 yen, up a bitfrom Tuesday's Tokyo close of 150.70
yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6738
marks.</p>
<p>The yen was little changed against the mark and dollar
Monday in the absence of U.S. and British participants from
the market.</p>
<p>While dealers generally agreed the yen will appreciate
against the dollar and mark over the long term, some
nervousness persists about Japan's stock and real-estate
markets, leading to what traders expect will be a fitful,
gradual rise of the yen.</p>
<p>The yen will rise on the strength of Japan's robust
economy, which appears attractive in light of the U.S.
slowdown and the economic uncertainties surrounding German
unification, participants said.</p>
<p>But short-term nervousness over Japan was highlighted by a
373.94-point drop of the Nikkei stock index to 32817.67
points Tuesday in Tokyo after several straight days of
advances, they said. The Nikkei gained 397.73 points Monday.</p>
<p>"Japan still is not a tremendous arena for investment"
owing to nervousness over the stock market, which dropped 23%
in the first quarter before rebounding; the large amount of
debt secured by overpriced real estate; and the country's
recent political problems, said Carl Amendola, a vice
president at Bayerische Hypothekenund Wechsel-Bank AG in New
York.</p>
<p>Despite signs that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has
consolidated power and has the strength to provide Japan with
effective leadership, some in the market are still wary
because of Mr. Kaifu's lack of a well-established power base
within the Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Concern about Japanese financial institutions' large
exposure to real-estate secured debt has waxed in recent
weeks amid reports that the high Japanese land prices of
recent years may have peaked.</p>
<p>The lack of a high confidence level in yen investments has
been masked somewhat by the current wave of bargain-hunting
for Japanese stocks after the Tokyo stock market's recent
losses, Mr. Amendola noted.</p>
<p>Dealers in Tokyo said that yen selling against the mark
gained steam in early Tokyo trading on rumors that an Asian
central bank had bought marks and that the West German
central bank would soon raise interest rates.</p>
<p>Helping the mark to post gains against the dollar and the
yen were a series of encouraging inflation reports for May
released over the past few days by the most economically
important West German states, participants said. The mark
finished at 90.34 yen, up from 89.01 yen late Monday in
Frankfurt.</p>
<p>The moderate inflation news helped the mark because the
market is more interested in seeing German unification
proceed as smoothly as possible than it is in seeing
inflation push up interest rates, said Kevin Logan, chief
economist at Swiss Bank Corp. in New York.</p>
<p>Higher cost-of-living rates would have reinforced the
notion of inflation as a potential danger to the smooth
conclusion of economic integration, Mr. Logan said. The drive
toward integration has been a bullish factor for the mark.</p>
<p>Activity in the dollar is expected to remain muted until
Friday's employment report for May, traders said. The lack of
any real chances for a change in the Federal Reserve's
neutral stance on U.S. interest rates is seen leaving the
dollar becalmed for lack of trading impulses.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $367.40 an ounce, down 80 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $366.65 an
ounce.</p>
