	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- The Canadian House of Commons passed abortion
legislation that allows doctors to decide whether an abortion
should be performed.
   Canada has been without an abortion law since the Canadian
Supreme Court struck down the previous one more than two
years ago, because it was deemed to infringe upon women's
constitutional rights. Under the former legislation,
abortions had to be approved by a hospital abortion
committee, which often caused delays in the abortion
procedure.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new bill would allow an abortion if a doctor believes
that a woman's "physical, mental or psychological health"
would be threatened should the pregnancy continue.</p>
<p>The new law has been criticized by anti-abortion groups,
who say it is too lax, and by abortion-rights advocates, who
claim it will discourage doctors from performing abortions.</p>
<p>Canadian Justice Minister Kim Campbell said the bill was
drafted "to achieve a delicate balance between the
conflicting views" on abortion. She said it provides
safeguards for Canadian women and reflects "society's
interest in the protection of the fetus."</p>
<p>The bill, which was approved by a vote of 140 to 131 in
the House of Commons yesterday, must be approved by the
Senate, the appointed chamber of Parliament.</p>
