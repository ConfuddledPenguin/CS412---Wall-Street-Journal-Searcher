	<p class="article-leader">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- A class-action shareholder
lawsuit was filed against Adobe Systems Inc. in federal
court, alleging violations of federal securities laws.
   The suit was prompted by the software company's disclosure
last Thursday that earnings and revenue for the second
quarter would be much lower than expected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Adobe had blamed the revised figures on a 23% decline in
the company's sales to customer Apple Computer Inc. But Apple
disputed the claim and issued a counter news release a day
later, asserting that the sales decline was far less.</p>
<p>The suit, filed by investor Richard Clotier in U.S.
District Court in Northern California, charges Adobe with
failure to disclose information and insider trading. On the
insider trading count, the suit names Adobe's chief executive
officer, John Warnock, Charles Geschke, its president, and
Bruce Nakaw, chief financial officer.</p>
<p>An Adobe spokeswoman called the lawsuit "completely
without merit" and said the software maker intends to contest
it. She added that the company "would not be surprised" if
several other shareholder suits were filed shortly.</p>
<p>Following disclosure of the revised forecast, Adobe's
stock plunged $15.25, or about 30%, to $35.25 a share on
Friday. The revised estimate predicted earnings of 29 cents
to 37 cents a share, on revenue of $33 million to $36
million. This report was well below analyst estimates for net
of 51 cents a share and revenue of about $42 million.</p>
<p>Adobe insiders sold 501,153 shares from Jan. 1 to April
30, compared with 293,032 shares in all of 1989, according to
Invest/Net, a North Miami, Fla., firm that tracks insider
buying and selling. In April, 90,000 shares were sold by Mr.
Warnock at between $37.75 and $38.25, and 40,000 were sold by
Mr. Geschke at between $39 and $40 each.</p>
<p>The company spokeswoman said "there was nothing
extraordinary" about the sales. "They were all consistent"
with the executives' sales in previous years, she said.</p>
