	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson
said in an interview that he is watching the country's credit
situation "very carefully" and has been trying to encourage
lenders and regulators to "use reason."
   So far Treasury officials don't see indications of a
nationwide credit crunch. But Mr. Robson, the second-highest
Treasury official, said, "There is a clear indication that
the credit availability of the real estate market is very
low, particularly with respect to commercial real estate."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The evidence of a credit squeeze seems contained to real
estate so far, Mr. Robson said. But he cautioned, "Remember
that if you look at credit data it is to some extent driven
by demand, and it's very hard to separate what loans aren't
being made because people aren't asking for loans that they
want very badly," but fear may be denied to them.</p>
<p>Recent widespread reports that banks are tightening
lending standards have caused concern among some government
officials and private economists that credit could become so
pinched as to tip the economy into a recession. A number of
people believe that federal regulators' increased scrutiny of
lending practices, in the wake of the savings and loan
fiasco, has led banks to cut back on even prudent lending.</p>
