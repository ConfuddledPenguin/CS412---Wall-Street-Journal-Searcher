	<p class="article-leader">In a big push into Europe and the Pacific Rim, Tyco
Laboratories Inc. said it will buy the operating assets of an
Australian maker of fire-protection equipment for about $600
million in cash and stock.
   Tyco, which has a commanding share of the fast-growing
fire-protection market, said it will pay $350 million in cash
and five million shares of common stock for Wormald
International Ltd. The stock, valued at $242 million at
current prices, will represent 10.6% of shares outstanding
after closing the deal, a Tyco statement said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, Irving Gutin, senior vice president, said Tyco
will report revenue of $2.1 billion for the fiscal year
ending Thursday, up from $1.97 billion in 1989. Mr. Gutin
also forecast revenue of $3.45 billion for the next fiscal
year, reflecting the Wormald acquisition.</p>
<p>Investors reacted positively. In active New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, Tyco closed at $50.75 a share, up
$2.50.</p>
<p>"This clearly gives Tyco the No. 1 position in the world
as a fire-control provider," said Laurence C. Baker, an
analyst with Dillon, Read & Co. Based on Tyco's history with
acquisitions, the deal probably will be non-dilutive of its
stock, he said. But he added: "The question is what happens
in the short term, and we don't have enough information yet
to tell."</p>
<p>The Wormald acquisition gives Tyco a strong presence in
Europe and the United Kingdom, where fiscal 1991 sales should
rise to $600 million from approximately $35 million before
the acquisition, Tyco said. In Pacific Rim nations, Tyco
projects a sales increase to $340 million from $15 million
before the acquisition. Wormald's fiscal-1991 sales in the
U.S. and Canada are projected to rise to about $210 million.</p>
<p>Fire protection-making and installing sprinklers, alarms
and industrial fire-suppression systems -- is Tyco's largest
business, accounting for $1.7 billion of the projected 1991
sales of $3.45 billion. Industrial flow-control system sales
are forecast at $900 million, with electronics and packaging
accounting for the rest.</p>
<p>L. Dennis Kozlowski, president and chief operating officer
and president of Tyco's Grinnell Corp. fire-protection unit,
said the fire-detection market "has grown dramatically in the
U.S. and Canada" as laws require such systems in public
buildings. He projected increased profitability as a result
of the acquisition.</p>
<p>Under terms of the Wormald agreement, Tyco also will issue
a five-year warrant to buy five million additional Tyco
shares, at $70 each. Tyco said the firms agreed to appoint
representatives to their respective boards and will enter an
agreement whereby Wormald may not acquire additional shares
except under specified circumstances. Tyco also said
completion of the transaction is subject to government
approvals and a vote by Wormald shareholders.</p>
