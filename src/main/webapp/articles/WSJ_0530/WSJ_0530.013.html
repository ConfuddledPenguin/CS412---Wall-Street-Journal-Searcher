   Hurdle in Switching
   To Private Financing</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Treasury has created a major stumbling
block for the Postal Service's plan to raise money in the
private credit market.
   The department has told the service that it can't switch
its borrowing to the private market from the Federal
Financing Bank unless the service gives up its special ties
to the government, including a $2 billion line of credit to
the Treasury.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Comer Coppie, senior assistant postmaster general for
finance, made it clear that the Postal Service isn't prepared
to relinquish its Treasury credit line. Another benefit, the
ability to request a federal guarantee for its debt, isn't
something the Postal Service contemplates using, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Coppie said the Treasury's position on Postal Service
borrowing was spelled out in a recent letter from Under
Secretary Robert Glauber. A copy of the letter wasn't
available, but a Treasury spokesman confirmed the
department's stance.</p>
<p>Mr. Coppie said the Postal Service remains committed in
principle to changing its relationship with the Treasury, and
reiterated the agency's desire to borrow in the private
market rather than from the FFB, a financing entity within
the Treasury that raises money for many agencies.</p>
<p>"We continue to have open communications" with the
Treasury, Mr. Coppie said. Still, he said, it seems clear at
this point that the Postal Service's next round of borrowing
will be done from the FFB.</p>
<p>The Postal Service was taken out of the federal budget by
last year's budget reconciliation bill. It maintains that
borrowing in the private market would be consistent with the
off-budget treatment, that it would have more flexibility in
the private market, and that the discipline imposed by the
marketplace would be beneficial.</p>
<p>The Postal Service is being supported in its quest by some
Wall Street firms interested in potential business
opportunities, officials said.</p>
