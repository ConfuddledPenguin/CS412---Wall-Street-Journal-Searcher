	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- Scat Hovercraft Inc. said its board voted to
remove Ronald R. Molina as president, chairman and chief
executive officer and as a director.
   The maker of recreational hovercraft vehicles gave no
reason for the action. Neither company officials nor Mr.
Molina could be reached for comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The board elected Jordan R. Finn, secretary and a
director, as interim president and interim chief executive
officer until a new president is chosen.</p>
<p>Scat said Mr. Molina had resigned from his positions, had
terminated his employment agreement and had resigned as a
board member. Last Friday, however, during a special meeting
of the board, Mr. Molina attempted to withdraw his
resignation, Scat said.</p>
<p>At that point, the board voted to remove Mr. Molina from
his positions and to terminate his employment agreement "in
the event {Mr.} Molina's prior resignation and termination
were ineffective," the company said in a news release.</p>
