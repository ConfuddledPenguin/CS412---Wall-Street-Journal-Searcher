	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- As Mikhail Gorbachev headed for a warm welcome
at the summit meeting in Washington, he suffered a stunning
defeat at home with the election of populist Boris Yeltsin as
president of the Russian Federation parliament.
   The victory enables Mr. Gorbachev's outspoken rival to
establish an opposing center of power in the Soviet Union's
largest republic. A longstanding critic of Mr. Gorbachev's
moderate efforts at economic overhaul, Mr. Yeltsin can use
his new platform to whip up public sentiment for his own
demands for more radical and speedy change.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After his victory, Mr. Yeltsin got a standing ovation from
the federation parliament, and his election led the evening
television news, while Mr. Gorbachev's arrival in the West
was buried 25 minutes into the broadcast.</p>
<p>Still, it was hardly a sweeping victory -- three rounds of
voting were held in the parliament before Mr. Yeltsin scraped
by with a margin of only four votes. And in his new role, Mr.
Yeltsin will have to restrain his bombastic manner and seek
compromise in the fiercely divided 1,060-seat legislature.</p>
<p>Indeed, political analysts say it was a promise by Mr.
Yeltsin to build a coalition in the parliament that finally
swayed some conservative hard-liners to his side. Under such
constraints, the 59-year-old Mr. Yeltsin could be an engine
forcing Mr. Gorbachev into riskier reforms.</p>
<p>"Maybe in this combination, Gorbachev will have more
chances to be decisive and radical," said Rair Simonyan, a
senior economist at the Institute of World Economy. "He needs
a person who can call a spade a spade."</p>
<p>Mr. Yeltsin immediately extended a conciliatory hand to
Mr. Gorbachev. "I'll build our relationship on a
business-like basis, on the basis of dialogue and
negotiation, not confrontation," he told Interfax news agency
after his victory.</p>
<p>Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev used to be allies in the
early days of Mr. Gorbachev's leadership. Handpicked as first
secretary of the Moscow Communist Party in 1985, the brusk
former builder bullied officials for corruption and purged
dozens of top city officials. Mr. Yeltsin helped Mr.
Gorbachev by proposing the most radical reforms, leaving Mr.
Gorbachev the middle road.</p>
<p>But by 1987, he had become too great a risk for Mr.
Gorbachev and was ousted from the party job. Last spring, in
a remarkable comeback, Mr. Yeltsin won a place in the Soviet
national parliament with 89% of the vote in his constituency.
Lately, as Mr. Gorbachev faces rising fury over the lack of
goods in stores and demands for independence by some
republics, Mr. Yeltsin has been accused of stirring up
discontent for his own gain.</p>
<p>Mr. Yeltsin stood for election in a brand-new parliament
whose members, including himself, were elected only recently
in the first free election for the Russian Federation. Mr.
Yeltsin leads the Democratic Bloc, an alliance of liberal,
pro-reform members, but more than half the members of the
parliament are conservative members of the party.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev campaigned hard against Mr. Yeltsin, at one
point telling the Russian parliament that Mr. Yeltsin was
leading the Soviet Union away from socialism. Two rounds of
votes were held in which Communist Party-backed candidates,
the Russian Federation's standing Prime Minister Alexander
Vlasov and then hard-liner Ivan Poloskov, failed to gain a
majority, as did Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
<p>Mr. Yeltsin's final victory is largely credited to his
last-minute pledge to build a coalition. Some analysts say
Mr. Gorbachev approved the Yeltsin option only late Monday on
the guarantee that a conservative would be deputy chairman.</p>
<p>As president of the Russian Federation, Mr. Yeltsin now
leads the biggest Soviet republic, stretching 5,000 miles
from Kaliningrad on the Baltic to the Far East, and home to
about half the nation's population. A major theme of his
campaign was greater political and economic autonomy for his
republic within the Soviet Union. He isn't known as a
dedicated supporter of secession movements in the Baltic
republics, but his increased power could strengthen the
nationalist movements that threaten to fracture the nation.</p>
<p>More immediately, his opposition to Mr. Gorbachev's
halting economic reforms could undermine the leadership's
program. The presentation last week in parliament of the
program included three stages of price reform, starting with
price rises for bread from July 1. The program is still under
debate by parliament, but the presentation immediately
sparked a new rash of hoarding. Reports of panic-buying were
hard to confirm, but during the weekend, lines seemed longer
than usual.</p>
<p>On Monday, rationing was imposed in Moscow to stem the
hoarding; shoppers must present internal passports. The
controls seem to have brought a slight improvement. Still,
many Soviets fear rationing will be permanent even though the
government says it is temporary.</p>
