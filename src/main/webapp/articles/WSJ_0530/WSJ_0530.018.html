	<p class="article-leader">R. Cort Kirkwood, in his review of John Aird's book
"Slaughter of the Innocents" (Leisure & Arts, May 14), tries
to link "the population control lobby" with the forced
abortions and sterilizations of China. It's hard to know if
this is sheer ignorance on his part, or the calculated
propaganda of someone trying to make points in the
anti-abortion war here at home.
   Let's go through it one more time: The issue is choice,
and who chooses. China says the state chooses, and enforces
that policy. The anti-choice types here in the U.S. also say
the state chooses: They want to make sure women can't choose
abortion. Some of them want to make sure women can't even
choose birth control. What those of us in the "population
control movement" want is for each woman to choose how and
when to have a family, of the size that she wants.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the state may have an interest in the size of its
population, we believe the limits of state policy should be
to provide incentives to encourage one behavior or another.
For example, our tax code provides deductions and credits for
children, child care, etc.</p>
<p>Just as the ACLU sometimes defends the rights of free
speech of hate groups in order to uphold the rights of all of
us to speak freely, we defend the right to abortion in order
to uphold women's right to choose. But no one in any
pro-choice or population-control group supports the actions
described in this review, of forced abortions and state
control of women's bodies. That's precisely what we are
fighting against.</p>

<p>It's easy for someone sitting amid the bounty of U.S. food
production to criticize China for its family-planning
practices, and to imply that vague "economic development
objectives" were responsible for such programs. In fact, as
the Chinese leaders knew and Mr. Kirkwood should have known,
the limiting of births in the late 20th century was done to
prevent a greater tragedy -- deaths by starvation of
already-born children in the early 21st century.</p>
<p>We are fortunate that our society has not been faced with
such a difficult set of options. But our harsh judgment of
one that has is unwarranted.</p>
<p>Further unwarranted is the condemnation of coerced family
planning and abortion in China by Americans who favor coerced
childbearing by limiting access to contraceptives and
abortion in the U.S.</p>
<p>In the ultimate irony, U.S. anti-abortionists used the
example of China to seek to limit funds for birth-control
programs in Third World countries that are trying to avoid
reaching the crisis point that forced China to turn to
unpalatable solutions.</p>
