	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In yet another indication of anxiety about the
creditworthiness of R.H. Macy & Co., an insurance company
decided to tighten its policy for clients doing business with
the giant retailer.
   Charles Marks, American Credit Indemnity Co.'s corporate
secretary, said the firm is limiting its exposure to Macy.
American Credit, based in Baltimore, insures accounts
receivables. Manufacturers typically buy such insurance to
minimize their risk should their customers become insolvent.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We've reviewed the account and are establishing new
guidelines as to our credit criteria for insurance," said Mr.
Marks. "We aren't, however, cutting Macy off." He declined to
disclose the financial limits the company has set for Macy or
its current exposure to Macy.</p>
<p>"What this means is that we may impose different
conditions relative to the terms under which new merchandise
can be shipped to Macy," added Mr. Marks. He said American
Credit decided to review Macy because it is concerned over
Macy's continued losses. For the third quarter ended April
28, Macy reported a net loss of $63.1 million against a $64.1
million loss a year earlier.</p>
<p>"We're not saying anything is wrong with Macy's, but we
are concerned about the losses," said Mr. Marks.</p>
<p>A Macy spokesman declined to comment. However, he stated
that Macy doesn't anticipate any problems with receiving new
merchandise.</p>
<p>Yesterday Macy met with several major factoring companies
to ease their fears that Macy was having unexpected financial
setbacks. Last week, several factoring companies, which buy
accounts receivables from manufacturers, said they were
tightening standards on future shipments of new merchandise
to Macy.</p>
<p>Separately, prices of Macy's high-yield, high-risk junk
bonds weakened slightly yesterday. The retailer's 14 1/2%
subordinated debentures due 2001 were quoted at 59 cents on
the dollar, down about one cent from Friday's prices.</p>
<p>"From a strictly financial perspective, we've seen a lot
worse," said Richard Reubenstone, a junk-bond analyst at
Delaware Bay Co. He estimates that Macy's cash flow will fall
about $25 million short of the amount needed for interest
payments, debt repayment and capital spending in the fiscal
year ending July 31.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1991, Mr. Reubenstone expects that gap to widen
to about $140 million. Still, Mr. Reubenstone says, the
retailer appears to have adequate bank borrowing lines to
cover its cash needs the next two years.</p>
<p>"So far, we are providing full support for Macy's," said
Hajime Yoshitake, a banker at Japan's Kyowa Bank, which
helped finance the Macy buy-out.</p>
<p>A Macy spokesman strongly disagreed with Mr. Reubenstone,
saying the company doesn't anticipate any cash-flow shortfall
in meeting either short or long-term obligations.</p>
