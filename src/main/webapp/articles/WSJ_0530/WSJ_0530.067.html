	<p class="article-leader">Something about this Summit has the air of an antique.
American Presidents and Soviet leaders have been meeting like
this for three decades, and as with previous Summits this one
nominally has to do with an arms-control agreement. But
somehow the agreements that Secretary of State Baker has so
arduously prepared for this meeting between George Bush and
Mikhail Gorbachev seem to be at the periphery of the events
now driving the world.
   The Mikhail Gorbachev who arrives today in the U.S. may
have been the catalyst for many of these forces (he didn't
create the forces named Solidarity and Sakharov) but it can
hardly be said that he controls them. He is trying to control
them, and they are trying to control their own destinies. The
world's cameras may focus on another U.S.-Soviet Summit, but
the real game is elsewhere.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yeltsin</p>
<p>Boris Yeltsin's election to the presidency of the Russian
Federation yesterday moved the Soviet Union another large
step toward political fragmentation. President Yeltsin wasted
no time in challenging the authority of President Gorbachev,
declaring that his victory marks the "blossoming of Russia as
a sovereign, independent government in the framework of the
union." He immediately tested that proposition, calling on
the Russian Federation parliament to reject the economic
reform announced by the central government last Thursday.
Again, Mr. Gorbachev had offered too little, too late.</p>
<p>If Mr. Yeltsin is able to take Russia down an independent
path, Mr. Gorbachev's own recent elevation to the newly
created presidency of the Soviet Union would look rather
hollow. The Soviet President would find himself to be the
President of a "union" no longer united.</p>
<p>The Baltic states will continue to press their bids for
independence. Georgia wants out, too. Armenia is engaged in
armed revolt. Resentments are smoldering in the Islamic
republics and could burst into flames at any moment. Ukraine
is restive and also has rejected the economic plan. Now the
presidency of Russia itself, with half of the population of
the entire union, has fallen to Mr. Gorbachev's most
important rival.</p>
<p>The contest between Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev has not
yet been decided, of course. President Gorbachev will attempt
to renew his party support at the important all-union party
congress scheduled for early July, but no one yet knows how
that will turn out.</p>
<p>The Soviet Economy</p>
<p>Mr. Yeltsin's victory yesterday was directly attributable
to the half-baked government economic program presented to
the Soviet parliament. By announcing future price increases,
it touched off a consumer panic, further depleting already
barren store shelves. Because it was yet another ineffectual
step toward the "market economics" Mr. Gorbachev keeps
promising, it played directly into Mr. Yeltsin's claims that
his rival is a "lover of half measures and half steps."</p>
<p>The Soviet Union may be facing both fragmentation and
economic collapse. It may in fact be necessary for both of
those two things to happen if the death grip of the Communist
Party and its associated bureaucracy is ever to be broken.
Already, local authorities are taking more and more economic
matters into their own hands, not just in the smaller
republics but within the Russian republic itself. Moscow's
new mayor, Gavriil Popov, seems serious about conducting the
city itself down an independent path. Russian cities and
regions talk much these days of withholding the fruits of
their local economies from Moscow.</p>
<p>In other words, Mr. Gorbachev's main opposition is coming
from parties and factions that want a more liberal and
democratic Soviet Union, not from forces that threaten to
install a new tyranny. He was given his sweeping powers by a
Communist Party that is trying to do the impossible, retain
communism and at the same time bring about an economic
reform. Since that cannot be done, it is quite possible that
economic collapse is inevitable. And if it is, there may be
little the West can do to prevent it.</p>
<p>Germany and Europe</p>
<p>If as seems likely Presidents Bush and Gorbachev plan to
bargain over a reunified Germany's membership in NATO, they
are behind the power curve. Both reunification and NATO
membership are, for all practical purposes, a fait accompli.</p>
<p>Germany effectively reunified on May 18 with the signing
of a German-German treaty that, by various estimates, moves
two-thirds to three-quarters of the way toward full
unification. Economic integration, one of the most
significant steps, will begin July 2. Germany already is
speaking with one voice, saying that it has no intention of
leaving NATO.</p>
<p>More quietly, out of consideration for Soviet
sensibilities, it is saying as well that the Russians need
not expect much German economic cooperation so long as Soviet
troops remain on German soil. That point, made by the
strongest economic power in Europe, is not lost on a Soviet
leadership trying to head off an economic crisis.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Gorbachev are in a good position
to bargain over something the German people already have
decided. Indeed, peoples throughout central Europe are taking
a good many decisions out of the hands of the superpowers.
But this does not mean Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev have
nothing to talk about. The Soviet foot-dragging in the
conventional forces reduction talks in Vienna, plus the
suspension of their troop withdrawal from Germany, are worthy
of serious discussion. When Poland, after a long struggle,
broke its ties with the Soviet Communist Party, a certain
chain of events was inevitable. Today, the Warsaw Pact,
through which the Soviets legitimized their control over much
of central Europe, is a hollow shell. National governments
are taking command of Warsaw Pact armies, breaking the
command and control chain that previously led to the defense
council of the central committee of the Soviet Communist
Party.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Soviet ineffectuality is only an
assumption. Armies are trained to fight. Soviet troops still
occupy key territories where they are not wanted. Soviet
missiles and warheads are just as destructive as ever. But
countries that were Soviet "satellites" a short while ago are
making their own decisions, not to mention the Soviet
republics themselves. The United States cannot protect Mr.
Gorbachev from these powerful forces. Mr. Bush should make
that clear this week. It can only support positive steps
toward peace, such as Germany's decision to stay in NATO, and
discourage negative ones, such as the delay in Soviet troop
withdrawals.</p>
<p>The West's Response</p>
<p>As counterpoint to the cacophony in the Soviet Union we
are beginning to hear a new version of an old song in the
West. It says, in effect, that the U.S. and Western Europe
shouldn't take undue advantage. Don't threaten to exclude the
Soviets from the new Europe. Don't excite the Soviet marshals
and generals into doing something rash. There is even talk of
a "Weimar Russia," a weak and ravaged state that would spawn
some new tyrant.</p>
<p>There is as yet no evidence that the Soviet Union is in
any danger of being excluded from Europe. Europe extends to
the Urals and even a singular Russia, denuded of all its
empire, would remain the strongest military power in Europe.
With its tank armies, missiles and nuclear warheads, it looks
nothing at all like a forcibly disarmed Weimar Germany.</p>
<p>That does not mean that the U.S. and the West need be
vindictive toward Mr. Gorbachev or the peoples who live under
Soviet rule. It is indeed important for the West to encourage
all the positive impulses it can discover in the new order
that surely must emerge from the wreckage of the Russian
empire.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Europe can best defend the cause of peace by
continuing to uphold liberal, free-market democracy and by
retaining a military defense capable of dissuading even the
most radical Soviet general from trying to solve the
country's problems with a new military adventure.</p>
<p>At Kennebunkport this past weekend, reporters pressed Mr.
Bush with questions along the newly emerging theme that the
West might try to take advantage of a weakening Soviet
leadership. We liked Mr. Bush's responses. He admitted that
Mr. Gorbachev has "enormous problems," but said it was not
the business of the U.S. to try to sort out those problems.
"It is our business to make clear to him what we can do and
those things we can't do."</p>
<p>Throughout the post-war period, the Soviet Union has acted
apart from history, a state that contributed nothing to
mankind other than fear of its presence. Often in recent
years, the West's favored means of response to this status
quo was to periodically sign an agreement over arms that bore
little relation to political events on the ground. Now that
is changing, and if the meeting over the next several days
between President Bush and Mr. Gorbachev seems a bit beside
the point, it is because the Soviet leadership has at last
climbed down from the Summit and rejoined a world of real
politics and real economies. The fall of the Summit's
importance is itself a symptom of progress.</p>
