	<p class="article-leader">My compliments for the interesting article (page one,
April 12) on the subject of former hippies now joining
country clubs.
   Perhaps you are not familiar with the old French saying,
"If a man is not a socialist at 20, he has no heart. If he is
not a conservative at 40, he has no head."</p>

<p>People quoted in your article about the resurgence of
country clubs came across as the shallow, elite yuppies that
are so reviled by most of society today. Their reasons for
joining the clubs and the importance of being accepted said
much about their priorities.</p>
<p>The most absurd quote, however, was by Kelvin Perry when
he complained that these overwhelmingly white country club
applicants "are shunning the melting pot that promotes racial
harmony." What makes this statement so absurd is that Mr.
Perry is president of the Black Chamber of Commerce of Kansas
City. Not exactly embracing the "melting pot" ourselves, are
we, Mr. Perry?</p>
