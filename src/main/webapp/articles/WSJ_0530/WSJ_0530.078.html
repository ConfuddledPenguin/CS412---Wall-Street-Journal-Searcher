	<p class="article-leader">Japan Air Lines and All Nippon Airways carried 52.2
million passengers in the fiscal year ended March 31, up 11%
from year-earlier levels.
   JAL, Japan's former flagship carrier, maintained its lead
over ANA in kilometers flown for each passenger, but the
smaller company flew more passengers than any Japanese
carrier. ANA's net income more than doubled as a result.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Air Nippon net was 15.02 billion yen ($100.5 million), up
from 7.4 billion yen the previous year. Per-share net was
10.9 yen, up from 5.4 yen. Air Nippon carried 30.5 million
passengers for the year, up 11% from 27.5 million.
Passenger-kilometers totaled 29.82 billion (18.49 billion),
up 15% from 25.83 billion.</p>
<p>JAL net fell 4.4% to 16.57 billion yen from 17.330 billion
yen because of a 5.12 billion yen provision for future tax
payments. Per-share net was 100.75 yen, down from 110.75 yen.
JAL carried 21.7 million passengers in the year, up 11%.
Passenger-kilometers rose 7.4% to 54.25 billion.</p>
