	<p class="article-leader">Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc. named John S. Herrington, a
former U.S. Secretary of Energy and an unknown in the
publishing industry, as chairman, succeeding William
Jovanovich, the iconoclastic publishing legend.
   At the same time, Peter Jovanovich, president and chief
executive officer of the debt-laden publishing and insurance
concern, succeeded the elder Mr. Jovanovich, his father, as
chairman of the executive committee at a board meeting in New
York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Industry experts said the moves may signal a recognition
at Harcourt that it must take steps to deal with its debt
problem. "Bill Jovanovich is a legend, and he's a very astute
publishing executive, but he's not a financial executive and
this company is deeply mired in financial problems," said
Charles Elbaum, president of Publishing Economics Inc., a
consulting firm in New York. "It's a different situation
now."</p>
<p>Under the stewardship of William Jovanovich, Harcourt grew
from a company with $8 million in annual sales and 125
employees in the mid-1950s to one with more than $1.27
billion in sales and more than 11,000 employees when he
stepped down last year as chief executive. In 1987, however,
his stellar career turned a corner when he saddled the
company with more than $2 billion in debt in an effort to
fend off a hostile takeover effort by British publisher
Robert Maxwell.</p>
<p>Many industry experts see his strong-willed triumph over
Mr. Maxwell as a Pyrrhic victory that may yet spell the
demise of Harcourt. To reduce debt, Harcourt has already had
to shed assets, including its Sea World theme parks that it
sold last year for $1.1 billion, a price that Wall Street
analysts called disappointing.</p>
<p>Most recently, Harcourt considered a possible sale of
assets to Thomson Corp., a Toronto publishing and travel
concern, but according to those familiar with the matter, the
possibility of a deal was dashed by a rise in bond prices
that made it prohibitively expensive for Harcourt to buy back
certain debt, a linchpin of the planned transaction.</p>
<p>In interviews, Mr. Herrington and Peter Jovanovich said
they face twin challenges: restoring the company's
pre-eminence as a textbook publisher and fashioning a
solution to its staggering debt load. While their projects
will overlap, the 51-year-old Mr. Herrington said he expects
to focus on resolving the financial problems, while Mr.
Jovanovich said he will dedicate himself to "meeting the
challenge of editorial excellence."</p>
<p>Mr. Herrington, who was energy secretary under President
Reagan from 1985 to 1989, conceded that he knows little about
publishing, but he anticipates that his skills in managing
big budgets and large staffs as well as balancing conflicting
interests should help in straightening out the company's
money problems.</p>
<p>"In structuring a debt solution, we have a lot of issues
-- none of which are publishing-related but, rather, are
mainly financial," Mr. Herrington said.</p>
<p>Mr. Herrington, a California real estate developer and
business lawyer, is a member of Harcourt's executive
committee and finance committee. Mr. Herrington was
associated with Mr. Reagan during the latter's California
administration and served as special assistant to the chief
of staff at the White House. Mr. Herrington is currently
treasurer and chairman of the building committee of the
Reagan Foundation and is overseeing the construction of a $60
million presidential library.</p>
<p>Some Wall Street analysts were skeptical of his prospects
for helping Harcourt. "It's all very well to have Mr. Energy
come out of the woodwork on a flaming chariot, but it doesn't
make very much sense," said Ivan Obolensky, senior vice
president of Josephthal & Co. and a longtime bear on
Harcourt.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Herrington and the younger Mr. Jovanovich said
they will explore all options in approaching the debt
problem, but they emphasized the company's goal of being a
strong, independent and U.S.-owned publisher.</p>
<p>Both men also took pains to emphasize that the departure
of the elder Mr. Jovanovich, who is 70 years old, was simply
an orderly transition of power, not a sign of rough times in
the board room. "My father has chosen a rather natural
process," the 41-year-old Peter Jovanovich said. "In 1988, he
stepped down as president, in 1989 he stepped down as CEO,
and in 1990 he's left as chairman."</p>
<p>The departure of William Jovanovich is also seen by some
observers as allowing Peter Jovanovich to emerge from his
father's shadow and to consolidate his authority at the
company. The younger Mr. Jovanovich wouldn't comment on that
speculation.</p>
<p>Mr. Herrington, a Walnut Creek, Calif., attorney and
businessman who joined the Harcourt board in 1989, said the
elder Mr. Jovanovich approached him about a month ago to
inquire whether he would consider becoming a candidate for
the chairman's post when it came open.</p>
<p>As is characteristic, William Jovanovich declined through
company spokesmen to be interviewed. However, in what appears
to be a shift from its typical media-shy nature, Harcourt
retained the public-relations firm of Hill & Knowlton to
assist in making the announcement about the changes.</p>
<p>The elder Mr. Jovanovich, born in a Colorado coal camp to
immigrant parents in 1920, started out as a textbook salesman
and editor in 1947 and in eight years rose to the post of
president. He has written numerous essays and five books,
including four novels and plans to publish another novel,
"The World's Last Night," in August. He has edited works by
Mary McCarthy, Milton Friedman and Charles A. Lindbergh,
among others, and plans to keep a hand in editing.</p>
