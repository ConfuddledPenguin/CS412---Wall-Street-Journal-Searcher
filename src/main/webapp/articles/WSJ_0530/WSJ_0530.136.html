	<p class="article-leader">Your April 23 Advertising column on Seagram's development
of Mount Royal Light, a 54-proof whiskey, requires comment.
   Seagram is not yet "beginning a national rollout" of this
new product. Mount Royal Light, which has been in two test
markets in the Northeast since last September with some
success, is adding three more test markets, in Southern,
Midwestern and Western states. The operative word is "test"
and will remain so for the time being.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>You are also wrong, as is the beverage consultant Tom
Pirko, in stating the consumer can already control the amount
of alcohol in a drink by merely adding mixer or water. The
typical serving portion of about an ounce and a half of
80-proof liquor contains a half-ounce of alcohol. That
half-ounce of alcohol remains in the drink, whether the drink
is taken neat, on the rocks or topped off with water, soda or
fruit juice. Dilution will alter the taste and make a bigger
drink, but it can't and won't reduce the quantity of alcohol
(or calories either, for that matter).</p>
<p>By contrast, the unique process by which Mount Royal Light
is produced does reduce by one-third the amount of alcohol
(and calories) in the serving, but it does not dilute the
whiskey or weaken the taste and body of the product. You
can't do that at home.</p>
<p>Our extensive research indicates a strong consumer
interest in a lower-proof, thus "lighter," spirits product.
If Mount Royal Light continues the test well, the Nobel Prize
may well elude us, as Mr. Pirko predicts, but so far
consumers and distributors, whom you and Mr. Pirko apparently
neglected to canvas, are telling us we have developed a very
promising product.</p>
