	<p class="article-leader">GORBACHEV EXPRESSED concern over Yeltsin's win as Russian
president.
   Arriving in Canada for an overnight visit on his way to
Washington for his second summit with Bush, the Soviet
president said he was "somewhat concerned" about the election
of the populist politician as president of Russia's
parliament. The victory, which came amid growing domestic
unrest, enables Gorbachev's outspoken critic to establish a
platform in the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics.
In Washington, U.S. and Soviet negotiators held pre-summit
talks on reducing long-range weapons and conventional forces.</p>

<p>THE SUPREME COURT AGREED to review federal rules on
abortion counseling.</p>
<p>Acting on a ruling by a federal appeals court in New York,
the justices agreed to decide whether U.S. officials may bar
federally funded family planning clinics from counseling
women about abortion. The lower court had upheld the
prohibition adopted in 1988 by the Reagan administration. The
case, to be argued in the fall and probably decided next
spring, provides the justices with a vehicle for further
restricting abortion rights.</p>
<p>The court agreed to decide whether states may impose
mandatory life prison sentences without the possibility of
parole for those convicted of possessing large amounts of
drugs.</p>

<p>South Africa's president has postponed a planned visit to
the U.S. next month because of objections from apartheid foes
over the timing of de Klerk's meeting with Bush, reportedly

complained that the meeting would be a snub to Mandela, who
is to arrive June 20 in the U.S.</p>

<p>NASA scrubbed today's scheduled launch of the space
shuttle Columbia after it detected a leak of liquid hydrogen
into the orbiter's rear fuselage shortly after fueling began.
A new date wasn't immediately set for the mission, in which
the spacecraft's seven-member crew planned to use a $150
million observatory to examine stellar radiation.</p>

<p>Thornburgh asked the special prosecutor investigating
former HUD Secretary Pierce to study new allegations of
favoritism at the housing agency. The attorney general's
request came in response to testimony by a Pierce ex-aide,
DuBois Gilliam, who said politics was an important criteria
in awarding federal grants.</p>

<p>Arab leaders decided against sending a memorandum on the
Mideast conflict to the Bush-Gorbachev summit after moderates
failed to temper criticism of the U.S. in the draft. The
meeting in Baghdad had been called as a show of Arab unity,
and to discuss an influx of Soviet Jews in Israel.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Shamir appealed for calm after
dozens of Israeli youths hurled stones at Palestinian
vehicles following the funeral of an elderly Israeli man who

groups claimed responsibility for the explosion.</p>

ministers, meeting in Paris, came after eight months of talks
on a proposal by French President Mitterrand.</p>

<p>Pakistan's Bhutto ordered the army to help restore peace
to Sind province. More than 170 people have been killed in
Karachi and in nearby Hyderabad in four days of ethnic
violence, and the prime minister is under mounting pressure
from opposition politicians to dismiss the provincial
government and rule directly from Islamabad.</p>

<p>Nicaragua's Contras renewed talks in Managua with aides to
President Chamorro, and a rebel leader said an agreement was
near on a suspended disarmament plan. The discussions focused
on mapping out resettlement areas inside Nicaragua, where the
government will provide land and economic assistance to the
insurgents.</p>

<p>Soldiers in Gabon regained control of Port Gentil, the
western African nation's oil-production center, after clashes

Bongo's government has imposed a state of siege.</p>

<p>Chile's President Aylwin has ordered former military ruler
Pinochet to relinquish records of the nation's disbanded

Pinochet said he would provide the "necessary information,"
but later denied holding any data.</p>
