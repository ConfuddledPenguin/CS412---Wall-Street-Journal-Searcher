	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices rocketed higher, sending the Dow
Jones Industrial Average and the Standard & Poor's 500-Stock
Index to records.
   The industrial average closed with a gain of 49.57 points
to 2870.49.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some analysts thanked Mikhail Gorbachev for the unexpected
rally, while others thanked IBM.</p>
<p>The Soviet president arrives in Washington today for a
four-day summit beginning tomorrow. Some market minders say
summit meetings often spark stock rallies, and that Mr.
Gorbachev has a particularly strong effect on the market.</p>
<p>But International Business Machines was clearly the leader
in the stock market. IBM soared 3 1/2, or 3%, to 119 3/4,
more than compensating for the 2 1/2 point loss incurred in
Friday's sell-off. The stock's strength was attributable in
part to this week's Barron's, which featured Big Blue in its
cover story.</p>
<p>IBM's early strength appeared to rally stocks from their
weak opening to move higher throughout the day. The gains
surprised many, who had expected Friday's steep sell-off to
carry over into yesterday.</p>
<p>"We deserved a down day," says Ralph J. Acampora, head of
technical research at Kidder Peabody.</p>
<p>A late spate of computer-driven buy programs kicked the
market to new highs.</p>
<p>The final upward surge also broke the S&P 500 index above
its previous all-time high. The index of the market's 500
largest stocks closed at 360.65, on a 6.07-point advance,
surpassing its high set last October.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 2.86 to
196.57, and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 5.08 to
335.42.</p>
<p>Advancers led decliners by 1,107 to 434, with 462 stocks
ending unchanged. Volume rose to 137,410,000 shares from
120,250,000 shares Friday.</p>
<p>Don R. Hays, director of investment strategy at Wheat
First Butcher & Singer, said the S&P 500 record may give the
market added assurance.</p>
<p>He said the rally might carry the industrial average above
the 2900 level before it runs out of steam, despite the fact
that many of the blue-chip stocks have risen too high, too
fast.</p>
<p>A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research, said
stocks may get another boost from economic data due at the
end of the week.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Labor Department will release its report
for May U.S. employment.</p>
<p>Mr. Moore believes that data will strengthen the belief
that the economy is slowing and that interest rates ought to
come down. The bond market should react favorably to the
news, giving bonds further room to rally, he said.</p>
<p>Many market watchers noted that the one ingredient missing
from yesterday's rally was strong volume. Trading was
particularly quiet until the final half hour, they said.</p>
<p>IBM surged to a 52-week high for the stock. Other
technology stocks followed. Computer maker Compaq rose 1 3/4
to 120 3/8.</p>
<p>Philip Morris was high on the most active list, ending
unchanged at 42 1/2. The stock came under pressure late last
week as some money managers began cutting their exposure to
tobacco companies after a government agency proposed new
restrictions on cigarette sales.</p>
<p>Time Warner gained 3 3/8 to 109. In this week's Barron's,
money manager Michael Price calls the stock "undervalued."
The stock had fallen with other cable television shares over
fears of new regulation in that industry. But market players
now expect any regulation to be less stringent than
originally feared.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch slipped 5/8 to 24 1/8. The company may need
to add as much as $200 million to reserves this year to cover
soured bridge loans and other forms of junk-bond exposure,
The Wall Street Journal reported. The company took a $470
million pretax charge last year.</p>
<p>Tektronix added 1 to 15 3/8. The company said it expects
to take a $70 million restructuring charge in its fiscal
fourth quarter ended Saturday. The restructuring will involve
the layoff of about 10% of its employees. The company also
says it ended talks to sell its Grass Valley Group unit to
Japan's Sony.</p>
<p>L.A. Gear fell 1 3/4 to 47 3/8 as investors began slicing
fat off the stock. Kidder Peabody cut its rating on the
athletic footwear maker's shares to "hold" from "current
buy," saying that the stock has run about as far as it can go
for now.</p>
<p>Rival Reebok International, meanwhile, added 5/8 to 19
1/4, while Nike rose 1 3/4 to 81 3/4 in over-the-counter
trading.</p>
<p>Bank of New England eased 3/8 to 3 1/8. The Journal
reported that James F. McNally, chairman of the bank's
Connecticut Bank & Trust unit, intends to retire this summer.
Mr. McNally's successor has yet to be named.</p>
<p>Tyco Laboratories added 2 1/2 to 50 3/4. The company said
it expects to report sales of about $2.1 billion in the year
ending tomorrow, up from sales of $1.97 billion last year.
Tyco also agreed to buy the operating assets of an Australian
maker of fire protection equipment for $350 million in cash.
The added revenue from Wormald should boost fiscal 1991 sales
to $3.45 billion, Tyco said.</p>
<p>Corning Glass Works dropped 1 3/8 to 48 3/4. Donaldson
Lufkin Jenrette turned neutral on the stock, after having
recently rated it as "moderately attractive," according to
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 2.72
to 362.56. Amex volume totaled 11,440,000 shares, compared
with 11,400,000 shares Friday. There were 300 issues
advancing, 239 declining and 241 issues were unchanged.</p>
