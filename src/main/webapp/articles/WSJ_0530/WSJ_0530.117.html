	<h3>WPPSS's Legacy: Premium Yields Still a Fact of Life</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">The credit-rating agencies that are cracking down on banks
and overleveraged companies are boosting ratings on bonds
issued by the biggest defaulter in the municipal market.
   These ratings boosts -- by Moody's Investors Service Inc.
yesterday and by Standard & Poor's Corp. last week -- come
just as Washington Public Power Supply System prepares to
sell $600 million of bonds next week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But even with the higher ratings, market analysts said
WPPSS's offering of bonds maturing in two to 27 years will
require premium yields to attract investors. That is because
WPPSS, known on Wall Street as "Whoops," still bears the
black eye of defaulting on $2.25 billion of bonds in 1983.
And the onus persists even though the bonds WPPSS is selling
with the higher ratings are for power plants for which there
wasn't any default.</p>
<p>While WPPSS bonds have been well-received by institutions,
individual investors still shy away from the name. "The
average guy on the street still doesn't want to own {WPPSS}
bonds," said Bruce Whiteford, a vice president and manager of
the fixed-income department of Chase Manhattan Bank's U.S.
Private Banking Group.</p>
<p>Prices of WPPSS bonds didn't move yesterday in reaction to
the ratings news because of the impending offering, which
adds still more new supply to the marketplace. WPPSS, a
quasi-government agency that supplies electricity in the
state of Washington, sold $721 million of bonds last
September.</p>
<p>That offering was the first time WPPSS raised money in the
public debt market since its default on nuclear units 4 and 5
bonds. The September sale consisted of refunding bonds for
nuclear units 1 and 3. Premium interest rates offered on the
refunding securities resulted in strong demand at the time.</p>
<p>Moody's said it upgraded to double-A from single-A about
$6.32 billion of revenue bonds related to WPPSS's nuclear
plants 1, 2 and 3. The new double-A rating also applies to
the $600 million of refunding revenue bonds for nuclear units
2 and 3, scheduled to be sold next week through a group lead
by First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>Also boosted to double-A from single-A was $26 million of
miscellaneous securities of WPPSS -- $17 million issued for
the Hanford Generating Project, and $9 million issued for the
Packwood Lake Hydroelectric Project.</p>
<p>Bonds related to WPPSS's nuclear units 1, 2 and 3 are
guaranteed by Bonneville Power Administration and weren't
part of the 1983 default, the biggest municipal default ever.</p>
<p>Moody's said its upgrade reflects "continued strong
performance at Bonneville Power Administration," the
federally created agency left to pick up some of the pieces
from WPPSS's giant miscalculation of the need for nuclear
power in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>Moody's noted that Bonneville's "role is a critical
ratings consideration, given the fact that it operates in a
region where public power issues have a long history of being
particularly volatile and political." The ratings company
said Bonneville has demonstrated a "capacity and willingness
to establish itself institutionally as a competitive,
self-supporting enterprise, with sound resource-planning
policies."</p>
<p>Last week, Standard & Poor's raised the rating on WPPSS's
revenue bonds for nuclear units 1, 2 and 3 and related
securities to double-A from double-A-minus, citing similar
conclusions as Moody's.</p>
