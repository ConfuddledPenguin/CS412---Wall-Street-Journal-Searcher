	<p class="article-leader">TAIPEI -- Taiwan's economic performance has shown signs of
a slowdown as the coincident-composite index dropped in April
for the third consecutive month and more manufacturers became
pessimistic toward the local economy.
   The Council for Economic Planning and Development said the
coincident-composite index, which measures economic activity
for the current month, fell in April to 130.33, against 131.9
the previous month and 133.96 in April 1989. The
month-on-month decline of 1.19% compares with a drop of 0.58%
and 0.02% in the March and February data respectively.</p>
