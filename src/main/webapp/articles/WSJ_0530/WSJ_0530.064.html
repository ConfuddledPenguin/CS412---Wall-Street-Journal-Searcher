	<p class="article-leader">Two regional government groups took another collaborative
step toward regulating marketers' claims that consumer
products and packaging are recyclable, recycled, reusable or
waste-reducing.
   The Coalition of Northeastern Governors and the Northeast
Recycling Council, which represent 10 states and various
industry interests, proposed model definitions and rules on
the use of recycling labels. The final regulations, likely to
be adopted in some form throughout the Northeast, are
expected to influence similar efforts in other states.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The state officials and industry representatives reached
broad agreement on the need for uniform labeling standards to
promote recycling and waste reduction while protecting
consumers from false or misleading environmental claims.
However, proposed definitions of what is "recyclable" and
what is "recycled" have prompted disputes between industry
officials who say they are too strict and environmentalists
who say they aren't tough enough.</p>
<p>"There is no consensus right now," says Shelley Dresser,
executive director of the recycling council. The council and
the coalition are sponsoring a "labeling summit" meeting next
month to resolve disputes and refine regulatory proposals
that later this year will be submitted to the states for
adoption.</p>
<p>Under current proposals, a product or packaging could wear
a "recyclable" label if it is recycled in a given state at a
20% rate this year, 35% by 1995 and 50% by 2000. To be called
"recycled," most products would have to contain 50% secondary
material, including 15% to 40% consumer waste. Plastic
packaging would have to contain 35% secondary material,
including 15% consumer waste. Secondary material also
includes manufacturing waste.</p>
<p>Procter & Gamble Co. says the proposals could actually
discourage recycling because many products that are being
recycled won't qualify for labels. Tom Rattray, a P&G
packaging executive, says the 35% recycled content
requirement for plastic packaging is too high because there
isn't enough plastic waste being collected.</p>
<p>However, Environmental Action Foundation, a Washington,
D.C., advocacy group, is pushing for a 50% recycling rate and
higher consumer-waste content to force industry to invest in
recycling. "We want the label to be hard to get so that
manufacturers have an incentive," says Jeanne Wirka,
foundation policy analyst.</p>
<p>There is also disagreement among the states. New York, for
example, is proposing a 25% recycling standard, while Rhode
Island would grant the label to any material covered by its
mandatory recycling law. The groups are seeking to avoid
state-by-state inconsistencies that would impede recycling.</p>
