	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms remained largely unchanged in the
week ended yesterday.
   Changes in average yields were mixed for
small-denomination CDs, while they remained at or above 8%
for maturities of six months and longer. The average yield on
a one-year consumer CD eased to 8% from 8.02%, while yields
on two-year consumer CDs were up to 8.12% from 8.10%,
according to figures compiled by Banxquote Money Markets, a
New York information service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>None of the banks in Banxquote's 18-bank survey offered a
yield as high as 9%. The highest yield for a
small-denomination consumer CD was 8.76% for a five-year CD
offered by Chase Manhattan Bank in New York.</p>
<p>Small-denomination CDs sold by leading broker-dealers were
also little-changed, with average yields remaining above 8%
for all maturities. Average yields on six-month CDs eased to
8.30% from 8.32%, while average yields on five-year CDs
remained at 8.63%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were
down slightly for all maturities. Average yields on six-month
jumbo CDs slid to 7.89% from 7.91%, while one-year maturities
fell to 8.06% from 8.11%.</p>
