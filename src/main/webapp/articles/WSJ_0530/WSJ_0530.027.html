	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Sony Corp. introduced what it claims is the
lightest and smallest camcorder on the market.
   Sony said its new TR-45 model weighs 690 grams, or about 1
1/2 pounds. The company said it trimmed 100 grams from the
weight of its popular TR-55, introduced last summer, by
developing a smaller image sensor and lens, and by reducing
the weight of other parts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The fully automatic TR-45 goes on sale in Japan on July 1
for 130,000 yen ($868), Sony officials said. It will be
introduced in the U.S. later in the summer and in Europe in
the fall, they said.</p>
<p>Introduction of the compact TR-55 last year greatly
boosted world-wide demand for 8mm camcorders, and Sony
officials said they expect to sell more than three million
8mm machines this year.</p>
