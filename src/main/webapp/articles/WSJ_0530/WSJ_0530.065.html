	<p class="article-leader">The California coast has become the front line in the war
among the nation's airline superpowers.
   On Friday, Delta Air Lines will become the fourth carrier
to offer shuttle service between the state's two largest
airports, San Francisco International and Los Angeles
International. The launch follows United Airlines' expansion
of shuttle service to half-hourly departures, and with two
other leading carriers, American Airlines and USAir, the
route will have 168 flights a day. Some think that rise in
capacity will finally force widespread fare discounting on
intrastate travel in the nation's most populous state, a
market that accounts for one of every 20 domestic passengers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Delta fired the first shot with a $198 promotional
round-trip fare, quickly matched by rivals, down from the
posted $372. "It sounds to me like it's going to be a big
bloody battle," says Continental Airlines' top marketing vice
president, John Nelson, who says the Texas Air unit is
"absolutely delighted not to be in the market."</p>
<p>But the major California combatants are intent on avoiding
fare wars, stressing service and spruced-up gate areas
instead. "We've made it abundantly clear that these fare cuts
are temporary" and give way to the $372 fare again on July
31, says Whitley Hawkins, Delta's senior vice president,
marketing.</p>
<p>United, too, expects to be able to avoid long-term fare
wars, and American expects only "continuing downward pressure
on fares through the summer." The $198 unrestricted fare,
paid by business travelers and others who can't book much in
advance, is still 37% above the $145 fare available to Los
Angeles-San Francisco fliers who can book in advance.</p>
<p>Because of the promotional fares, a round of fare cuts
that swept the country last week largely skipped California.</p>
<p>For years, United battled fare-cutting regional rivals
such as Pacific Southwest Airlines and AirCal while other
giant national airlines steered clear of the California
market. "Carriers were terrified of the fare environment,"
says John C. Pope, United's executive vice president and
chief financial officer.</p>
<p>But the regionals were snapped up in the mid-1980s
following airline-industry deregulation, taking a lot of the
pricing pressure off the remaining players. When United
doubled its Los Angeles-San Francisco schedule, for instance,
it didn't cut fares at all. (It and others do pass out
frequent-flier benefits, however, which airlines consider
tantamount to price cutting.)</p>
<p>Mr. Pope believes the industry has "rationalized" the fare
structure, which for travelers means the disappearance of
once-plentiful under-$100 round trip tickets. United says it
would like to dominate the "Bay-to-Basin" corridor --
including Oakland and San Jose to the north and Burbank,
Ontario, Long Beach and Orange County to the south -- that is
the nation's busiest metropolitan pairing.</p>
<p>But some Californians fume over the fare-hiking ways of
the invading nationals that swallowed up Pacific Southwest
Airlines, AirCal, Western Airlines and others.</p>
<p>"I get a lot of disbelief when I quote fares," says Susan
Lundell of Lande Travel, who has learned to use a few
"oddball carriers" offering lower intrastate fares: $63 on
TWA's one Los Angeles-San Francisco flight, or $29 for a
Southwest Airlines 21-day-advance Burbank-Oakland ticket.
(Southwest's $59 Burbank-Oakland full fare on the route,
matched by rivals who previously had charged $186, is the
rare case in California in which a low-fare carrier claimed
enough airport space to start its own shuttle.)</p>
<p>Instead of cutting fares, airlines are peppering local
media markets with ads claiming superior California service.
And they are preparing long-term strategies for waging the
war of attrition they see developing out West.</p>
<p>The ads for Delta, based in Atlanta, picture cattle
boarding a presumed rival shuttle with the caption: "Have You
Herd the Moos?" The ads promise a touch of Southern
hospitality. Free wine also will be served on flights.</p>
<p>A bigger challenge, though, is simply to build name
recognition in California. By buying struggling Western
Airlines in 1986, Delta overnight won a big Los Angeles
presence, but one that lacked a cohesive strategy. The
shuttle, and Los Angeles-New York nonstop service also
starting Friday, help fit California into Delta's national
and international plans. To convince locals it's here to
stay, it has used supermarket ticket promotions and become
the official Dodgers and Disneyland airline.</p>
<p>American, a unit of AMR Corp. of Dallas, has focused on
service, too, expanding food and drink service to all
flights, rather than just morning ones, and keeping open the
extra Los Angeles check-in counter it normally shuts after
the busy Easter holiday. It also made major scheduling
sacrifices to keep up. After cutting back its hourly Los
Angeles-San Francisco schedule, for example, it recently
restored it, and now aims for departures every 45 minutes.</p>
<p>American reversed itself because it didn't "want to send
the wrong signal" as rivals increase service, says Joseph
D'Ambrosio, vice president of the airline's Western division.
"We know that California and the Pacific Northwest is the
gateway to the Pacific, and that's our future." He adds that
"we're not losing money but we're not making any" because so
many airlines split the market.</p>
<p>A year ago, American and others did slash intra-California
fares. But fares generally have climbed since then. Mr.
D'Ambrosio predicts an eventual industry "pulldown" as
carriers flying so many flights discover that "it's not going
to be a profitable market for most carriers."</p>
<p>UAL Corp. of Chicago is adding planes to United's
California fleet to help it dominate the market vacated by
PSA, AirCal and Western. The service will be profitable,
United believes, because its calculations show the recent
rise in Los Angeles-San Francisco capacity does little more
than return the total number of flights in the market to
levels prevailing several years ago, and because shuttles
bring in more full-fare business. "The beauty about a
shuttle, and about half-hour service," Mr. Pope says, "is
that there's a lot less concern on the part of the public to
ticket in advance, or to make sure you're there early."</p>
<p>United is adding special baggage facilities and amenities
for business travelers, Mr. Pope says, but "the real seller
has got to be that you've got a plane leaving every half
hour." There is some question, however, about how well United
has promoted itself, especially in the face of Delta's catchy
new campaign.</p>
<p>When USAir Group bought PSA in 1987, it hardly expected
the kind of competition it is now facing. And being caught by
surprise may be the reason that, by most estimates, USAir
isn't doing well there despite a heavy level of service.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that "the competition has increased
significantly with Delta and American and United," Seth
Schofield, executive vice president of operations at USAir,
says a buildup is under way. USAir next month begins moving
450 flight attendants and 50 pilots to Los Angeles from North
Carolina.</p>
<p>Another airline on Californians' minds is still only a
gleam in the eyes of some state legislators. At first airline
industry executives joked about Golden State Air, the
state-run airline being proposed by Sen. Art Torres (D., Los
Angeles), but the bill advanced. Now that proponents want to
finance startup with a one-cent-a-gallon airline fuel tax,
industry opposition is taking off.</p>
