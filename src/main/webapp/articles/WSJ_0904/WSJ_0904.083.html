	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- Axel Springer Verlag said first-half net
income rose 7% to 60 million Deutsche marks ($38.3 million).
   The Hamburg, West Germany, publisher didn't provide
comparable figures for the year-earlier period. The company
said it achieved the results despite its cooperative ventures
in East Germany, which the company said demanded considerable
expenses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it expects the positive earnings
developments to continue in the second half. The company
publishes West Germany's largest mass circulation tabloid
newspaper, Bild.</p>
<p>Sales rose 14% to 1.67 billion marks, with all of the
company's sectors contributing to the increase.</p>
<p>Newspapers sales rose 83 million marks to 369 million
marks, while magazine sales climbed 34 million marks to 369
million marks.</p>

102 million marks in the first half.</p>
