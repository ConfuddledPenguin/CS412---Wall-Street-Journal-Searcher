	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Sales of cars, trucks and buses in Japan climbed
12% in August from a year earlier to 356,312 units, a record
for the month, the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association
said.
   Car sales rose 10% to 252,033 units. Sales of medium-size
cars soared 46% to 25,207 units, maintaining a sharp upward
trend that officials said has resulted in part from a growing
preference among the Japanese for upscale models. Small-car
sales showed a 7.1% gain from the previous year, totaling
226,826 units.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Truck sales rose 15% to 102,532 units, the highest on
record for the month. Bus sales grew 18% from the previous
year to 1,747 units.</p>
<p>Most car makers registered considerable growth in August
sales. Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's biggest car maker, sold
141,872 cars, trucks and buses, up 20% from a year earlier.
Sales by Nissan Motor Co., the second biggest manufacturer,
rose 5.1% to 82,245 units. Mazda Motor Corp. reported sales
of 31,019 units, an 11% gain. Sales by Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. jumped 19% to 26,983 units.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Honda Motor Co. posted a 3.8% drop,
with sales totaling 27,699 units. Honda officials said the
decline was a result of brisk sales the previous year on the
introduction of a popular new model.</p>
<p>Separately, Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses rose
2.9% in July from a year earlier to 489,804 units because of
growing car shipments, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers'
Association reported.</p>
