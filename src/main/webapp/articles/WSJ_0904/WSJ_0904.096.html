	<p class="article-leader">TORRANCE, Calif. -- Toyota Motor Corp.'s U.S. sales arm is
raising the base price of its 1991-model Lexus LS 400 luxury
sedan to $38,000, up 8.8% from the introductory price last
fall.
   The increase is the second price rise for the LS 400 since
it was introduced. In May, Toyota raised the sedan's price by
$1,000 to $36,000. Toyota attributed the latest increase,
which takes effect in the middle of this month, in part to
new standard equipment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 1991 LS 400 will have a new feature that allows
drivers to operate the power windows with the ignition turned
off, new remote control door locks, and new equipment to
ensure that the car will pass emission testing anywhere in
the U.S., Toyota said.</p>
<p>Despite the price increase, the LS 400 remains less
expensive than several of its European luxury car rivals,
such as the Mercedes-Benz 300 E model. Late last month,
Mercedes raised the 1991 300 E sedan's price to $47,200, up
2.7% from a year ago.</p>
<p>Toyota also increased the 1991 base price of its smaller
and less-popular Lexus ES 250 model to $21,300, a 1.2%
increase from the year-ago starting price of $21,050.</p>
<p>Separately, the U.S. sales arm of Hyundai Motor Corp.
raised prices of its 1991 model cars as much as 7%.</p>
<p>The Korean auto maker boosted the price of its most
expensive model, the V-6 powered Sonata with four-speed
automatic transmission to $12,170, up 6.9% from a year ago.
The Sonata model equipped with a standard five-speed manual
transmission now starts at $10,700, up 7% from $9,999 a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Hyundai increased the price of its cheapest subcompact
Excel hatchback to $6,275, up 6.4% from $5,899 a year ago.
The price of the four-door Excel model rose to $7,410, up
5.9% from $6,999 a year ago.</p>
<p>Hyundai said the price increases reflect in part new
standard equipment such as power steering, seat-height
adjusters, side molding, and body-color bumpers.</p>
