	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL, South Korea -- Last year, foreign-bank managers in
Korea worried about militant workers holding them hostage for
higher wages. This year they worry about militant regulators
throwing them out of the country.
   Korean banking authorities have spent the summer
tightening restrictions on the way foreign banks can operate
in South Korea. The result for foreign banks is plenty of
confusion, lower profits and doubts about their future in the
growing Korean market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Much attention has been focused on threats by the Bank of
Korea, the central bank, to discipline expatriate bank
managers who they conclude are engaging in off-limits
business and playing fast and loose with the rules. A study
submitted to Korea's National Assembly found that the Office
of Bank Supervision and Examination had disciplined foreign
banks 34 times in the past 18 months.</p>
<p>"We have repeatedly found many {instances of} irregular
business," said Shin Bok Young, assistant superintendent of
banks for the Bank of Korea. "We made simple warnings, but
these kinds of violations haven't been stopped."</p>
<p>So officials want to extend Korea's "personal rebuke"
system to foreign banks. It would let regulators force a
foreign manager from his post -- and, for an unemployed
expatriate manager, that means out of Korea. The personal
rebuke system has been used to remove Korean bank managers,
most notably the head of Hanil Bank, one of Korea's largest.</p>
<p>It isn't clear if the Bank of Korea will go that far with
the foreign banks, though authorities haven't ruled out such
a move. Regulators leaked to Korean reporters the name of a
U.S. bank that, according to the reports, may be the target.
Concerned U.S. officials have met with the Bank of Korea.</p>
<p>When Korea was developing its export-led economy, it
desperately needed foreign banks to bring in capital to
jumpstart industrial growth. Foreign banks made a lot of
money in those days and enjoyed favored treatment. But now
that Korean industry is no longer totally dependent on
foreign banks, Korean banks, whose profits were down 28% in
the first half, see the outsiders as competitors.</p>
<p>Many foreign bankers and diplomats are beginning to wonder
if the crackdown on sources of profit for foreign banks is an
attempt to force foreign banks out of Korea. Foreign bankers
complain they can't bring in capital to fund operations or
make loans. To raise capital locally they try to make money
on services, such as foreign-exchange transactions -- a
special target of the regulators. Citicorp's Citibank says it
is going the retail route to raise money from deposits, but
contends the government has been slow to allow it the
branches and automatic teller machines that Korean consumers
demand.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is cultural. The Westerners assume
that if a service isn't specifically outlawed, it is legal.
But Koreans say that if it isn't specifically outlawed, then
it may or may not be legal.</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea recently circulated a list of 16 areas
in which it said foreign banks were violating rules, among
them charging interest in advance and accepting blank checks
as collateral. But the focus was foreign exchange, one of the
few areas where foreign banks made money.</p>
<p>Bank of Korea doesn't want foreign-exchange transactions
used for speculation. For instance, every forward purchase
contract must have an underlying foreign commercial contract.
But bankers complain that Korean conglomerates won't provide
the documents. World-wide, foreign-exchange volume is about
40 times larger than foreign commercial transactions, but
Korea wants a 1-to-1 ratio.</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea also no longer wants banks to use
historical-rate rollovers on forward contracts of foreign
exchange purchases. This vehicle lets a client company hedge
its currency bets and extend a contract if it thinks the rate
will be more favorable later. Several Korean companies have
lost large sums of money on forward purchases recently. In
addition, revenue is down and costs are up substantially,
particularly wages and office rents.</p>
<p>The upshot: Foreign banks' profit growth is slowing.
Earnings grew only 3.8% in 1989, compared with 24% in 1988
and about 30% in 1987. Bankers expect a sharp decline this
year.</p>
<p>No banks have pulled out of Korea because of worsening
business conditions. And the Bank of Korea says it doesn't
want foreign banks to leave. "Foreign banks can be useful for
the introduction of new financial technologies," says Mr.
Shin of the Bank of Korea.</p>
