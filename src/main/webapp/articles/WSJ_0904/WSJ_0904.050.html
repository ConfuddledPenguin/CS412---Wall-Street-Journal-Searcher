	<p class="article-leader">CALGARY, Alberta -- Alberta energy regulators approved an
825 million Canadian dollar (US$719.2 million) plan by Shell
Canada Ltd. to develop its big Caroline sour gas field,
rejecting a rival plan of Husky Oil Ltd.
   The decision followed weeks of public hearings this spring
on the competing proposals, and months of rancorous debate
about the environmental impact of developing the Caroline
reservoir, which is generally regarded as the largest gas
find in Canada in years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shell Canada is a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, an
Anglo-Dutch concern.</p>
<p>Caroline is expected to produce C$10 billion of natural
gas, natural gas liquids, gas condensate and sulfur during
its 30-year life. The reservoir's "sour" gas designation
stems from its high content of deadly hydrogen sulphide.</p>
<p>"We're delighted with the decision," said Ray Woods, Shell
Canada's vice president, resources development. He said site
development work will start this fall at Caroline, 75 miles
northwest of Calgary, pending final approval from Alberta's
minister of environment. Production is scheduled to begin by
the first quarter of 1993.</p>
<p>Husky, whose plan called for construction of a 30-mile
pipeline to transport Caroline's sour gas to Husky's
under-utilized Ram River gas-processing plant, said it will
now work hard to bring Caroline into production as soon as
possible. "We accept the board's decision and we are now
prepared to work with Shell and the other partners," said a
spokeswoman for Husky, 43%-owned by Nova Corp. of Alberta. A
group of 14 companies holds interests in Caroline, led by
Shell Canada, with 62%. Husky owns 12%.</p>
<p>The Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board -- the
quasi-judicial body that issued the ruling -- said that
although Husky's plan had some advantages, they were
outweighed by those offered by Shell Canada.</p>
<p>Among other things, it said Shell Canada's plan would
yield greater economic benefit, reduce safety risks and be
more reliable, as Shell Canada plans to process gas from
Caroline at a new plant, whereas Husky's proposal depended on
upgrading its aging Ram River plant. "While both projects
offered substantial benefits, the Shell proposal was the most
desirable in terms of overall public interest," it said.</p>
<p>Caroline is expected to have a major impact on Shell
Canada's production, cash flow and earnings. "It's an
enormously important project to Shell," said Wilf Gobert, an
analyst with Calgary-based Peters & Co. The field's daily
output is expected to total about 93 million cubic feet of
natural gas, 27,000 barrels of natural gas liquids, 17,000
barrels of condensate -- a very light-gravity crude that
sells at a premium price -- and 4,000 metric tons of sulfur.</p>
<p>Denis Mote, an analyst with Toronto's Maison Placements
Inc., estimates that Caroline will generate for Shell Canada
about C$143 million of additional annual cash flow and C$96
million of additional earnings. For 1990's first half, Shell
Canada had cash flow of C$289 million and earnings of just
C$58 million, on revenue of C$2.53 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Mote said the Caroline development would also help
Shell Canada develop its nearby Bearberry sour gas field more
cheaply.</p>
