	<p class="article-leader">Exposure to polluted air can provoke life-threatening
irregular heart beats in people already suffering from
coronary artery disease, a study says.
   The report adds to a growing body of evidence that carbon
monoxide -- a common urban pollutant emitted in auto exhaust
and by industrial smokestacks -- has a pernicious effect on
the heart. Such findings are particularly troubling for urban
residents and their doctors as well as for policy makers
charged with setting air pollution standards, health
researchers say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the most recent study, published in the current issue
of Annals of Internal Medicine, scientists found that heart
patients exposed to high levels of carbon monoxide suffered
three times more complex irregular heart beats during
subsequent exercise than when they were exposed to regular
room air.</p>
<p>Such complex arrhythmias are the most common cause of
sudden death from coronary artery disease. "Cardiac patients
should avoid exercise in or around areas of high pollution,"
said David S. Sheps, professor of medicine at the University
of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and the lead author of the
report.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide is attracted to hemoglobin, the blood's
oxygen-carrying protein, and as its levels in the blood
increase, it restricts the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the
heart and other organs. Previous studies have shown that at
levels of 2% to 4% carbon monoxide exacerbates symptoms of
coronary artery obstruction that lead to heart attacks.</p>
<p>The study by Dr. Sheps and colleagues at the University of
North Carolina and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
is among the first controlled trials to show that carbon
monoxide also increases the occurrence of irregular heart
beats.</p>
<p>In the experiment, 41 non-smoking heart patients -- 36 men
and five women with an average age of 62 -- were exposed on
separate days to non-polluted air, and air with carbon
monoxide concentrations to raise so-called carboxyhemoglobin
levels to 4% and 6%. The researchers said some people who
exercise for an hour or more in air that marginally exceeded
certain EPA standards could achieve such levels of carbon
monoxide in their blood. In nonsmokers, normal
carboxyhemoglobin levels range from 0.5% to 1.5%, Dr. Sheps
said. Smokers commonly have chronic levels from 4% to 6%.</p>
<p>Under double-blind testing procedures, neither the
patients nor the researchers knew the exposure levels during
each session. The patients then exercised on stationary
bicycles for about 15 minutes in non-polluted air.</p>
<p>Patients experienced significantly more single abnormal
heart beats and more complex arrhythmias at 6%
carboxyhemoglobin levels, but not at 4% levels, the
researchers found. Dr. Sheps said the link with complex
arrhythmias was the most important finding because they are
most directly associated with cardiac arrest and other
"adverse events." Older patients, and those who exercised
longer and at higher workloads were more likely to experience
the complex irregular heart beats, the researchers said.</p>
<p>Without significant effects at 4% levels, Dr. Sheps said
that exercise for heart patients in relatively low air
pollution probably wasn't troublesome and he cautioned
against extending his study's findings too far. But he noted
that the researchers found no correlation between irregular
heart beats and symptoms from coronary artery obstruction,
indicating that carbon monoxide may cause heart damage in
different ways, triggering some adverse responses at lower
levels than others.</p>
<p>In an editorial accompanying the report, two heart
researchers from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
said that in light of mounting evidence of the dangers of
carbon monoxide, doctors should consider a patient's level of
carbon monoxide exposure in managing their disease.</p>
<p>Sandra M. Walden and Sidney O. Gottlieb, of the school's
division of cardiology also described as "alarming" the
number of days some cities exceed EPA limits for common
pollutants (about 80 days a year in New York City) and urged
doctors to "firmly and collectively {encourage} medically
responsible environmental regulation."</p>
