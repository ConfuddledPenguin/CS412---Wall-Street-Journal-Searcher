	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Mothers will recycle newspapers or car pool to
help the environment, but ask them to do without disposable
diapers and most say, "No way."
   That's according to a Gallup Organization survey of more
than 800 mothers with children three years of age or younger.
The survey was conducted at the request of the Diaper
Manufacturers group of the American Paper Institute, a trade
group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The survey, conducted in June, found that only one in four
mothers was willing to switch to cloth diapers to help
improve the environment, though nearly three of four would
recycle newspapers, and about 45% would car pool or build a
backyard compost pile to dispose of trash.</p>
<p>Gallup said most mothers cited health reasons for using
disposable diapers. Tops on their list were: Disposable
diapers prevent leakage (85% of respondents), keeps baby's
skin drier (83%) and helps prevent spread of germs and
disease (62%).</p>
<p>The findings didn't go over well with the National
Association of Diaper Services, proponents of cloth diapers.
According to the association, the cloth-diaper business has
been growing at an annual rate of 38.5%. "Somebody must be
changing," said John Shiffert, the association's executive
director.</p>
