	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators took over Ensign Bank, a
New York thrift controlled by Ted Arison, chairman of
Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines Inc.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision said Ensign became
insolvent because "poor underwriting, inadequate appraisal
policies and, to a lesser degree, the softening New York-area
real estate market" left the thrift saddled with a high level
of nonperforming assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As of June 30, Ensign had assets of $1.78 billion,
liabilities of $1.79 billion and tangible capital of negative
$174.8 million, for a capital-to-assets ratio of negative
14.48%.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr. Arison said in a statement that Mr.
Arison was "shocked and outraged" by the regulators' actions.
Ensign was in the middle of negotiations with federal
officials to recapitalize the thrift and to bring it into
full compliance with regulatory requirements, the spokesman
said.</p>
<p>"There are problems with the bank -- no one denies that,"
the spokesman said. "But the bank wasn't going to fold."
Under plans being developed with regulators, Mr. Arison was
prepared to add "substantial amounts of new capital" to the
thrift, he said.</p>
<p>Ensign's president and chief executive officer, Alan
Master, said the move by regulators was a "terrible and
unnecessary loss not only to the American taxpayer but also
to the communities served by Ensign and to Ensign's
employees."</p>
<p>In 1985, the thrift, which has 19 branches in New York,
New Jersey and Florida, began "markedly" expanding its
construction, land and commercial real estate lending, the
OTS said. Nonperforming assets increased from $16.2 million,
or 1.58% of total assets, on Dec. 31, 1985, to $174.5
million, or 9.14% of total assets, on Dec. 31, 1989, the
agency said.</p>
<p>The OTS said a whopping $416.7 million, or 22.2% of total
assets, were classified as "substandard, doubtful, or loss"
as of March 31. Ensign had net losses of $38 million in 1989
and $34.4 million for the first half of this year. Since May,
the thrift had been operating under an agreement with the
regulators restricting its loan and investment activities.</p>
<p>The institution will remain open under the control of the
Resolution Trust Corp., the agency set up last year to sell
failed savings and loans.</p>
