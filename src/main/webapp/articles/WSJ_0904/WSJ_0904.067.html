	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- New York newspaper unions, locked in difficult
negotiations with Tribune Co.'s Daily News, will ask
advertisers today to boycott the newspaper.
   In a related development, the 10 unions are preparing a
citywide outdoor advertising campaign, using billboards and
city buses to attack what they say is the "anti-labor" stance
of Daily News management. The ad campaign is to begin next
week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The call for an advertiser boycott against the tabloid
follows months of rancor at the bargaining table. The paper's
10 unions, representing about 2,800 employees, have been
working without contracts since March 30. Little progress has
been made, and tensions have escalated.</p>
<p>The unions have publicly ridiculed Daily News Publisher
James Hoge, while Tribune Co. has prepared extensive
contingency plans in case of a strike, with replacement staff
from pressmen to reporters ready to step in.</p>
<p>The unions have prepared, too, sending out two letters in
recent months to 75 top Daily News advertisers, asking them
to suspend advertising in the paper when they are asked. A
recent letter said that "we will be boycotting to force the
Daily News to abandon its anti-labor strategy."</p>
<p>Large advertisers that ignore the boycott could feel the
wrath of the unions, said Deborah Friedman, vice president of
Kamber Group, a public relations firm that represents the
unions. Uncooperative advertisers will be targeted by union
members, who will pass out leaflets outside their stores
"telling people what the store is doing to hurt working
people," she said. "Hopefully it won't get to that point."</p>
<p>John Sloan, Daily News vice president, called the boycott
"a pathetic attempt at disinformation and diversion. It's a
misguided campaign of intimidation and threats and coercion
against our advertisers."</p>
<p>The Daily News has taken its own steps. After five of the
unions authorized strike votes, it advertised last spring for
replacement workers, attracting at least 15,000 applicants.</p>
<p>It's unclear how successful the boycott will be, but if it
works, it will worsen an already difficult year at the
newspaper. The Daily News, like other major metropolitan
newspapers, is struggling with steady declines in local ad
linage. In the first half of 1990, Daily News full-run ad
linage fell 14%. The poor advertising market and costs
related to labor strife have led analysts to predict the
Daily News could have a loss of as much as $45 million this
year on revenue of more than $400 million.</p>
<p>"The unions are directing their efforts toward business
people who have the same objectives that we have: to run an
efficient operation," Mr. Sloan said. "It's doomed to fail."</p>
