	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Emigration from Hong Kong will leap almost
50% in 1990 because of fears of China's takeover in 1997, the
British colonial government announced.
   The government said 62,000 people are expected to leave
the territory this year, compared with 42,000 last year, a
jump of 48%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A government spokesman said emigration was expected to
level out at about 60,000 people a year, or 1,150 people a
week. In 1991, he predicted, 58,000 will leave the colony.</p>
<p>Most of those leaving are members of Hong Kong's
well-educated middle class, who have turned this
1,063-square-kilometer patch of islands and peninsula on the
southern Chinese coast into an economic powerhouse. Their
departure has sparked fears of economic and social problems
in Hong Kong once China resumes control of the territory in
1997.</p>
<p>Interest in emigration has skyrocketed since China cracked
down on a movement for freedom in Beijing in June of last
year. The crackdown convinced many in the territory that
China could easily break its promise to maintain the colony's
freewheeling economic and social system for 50 years.</p>
<p>London's refusal to give its colonial subjects the right
to live in Britain had a role in stimulating emigration.</p>
