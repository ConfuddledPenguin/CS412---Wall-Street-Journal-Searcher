	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Archer-Daniels-Midland shares have wavered
along with the rest of the stock market since the Persian
Gulf crisis raised the specter of an oil-shock recession.
   But if oil prices stay up, Archer-Daniels might have a
silver lining: ethanol.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Decatur, Ill., processor of agricultural commodities
controls about 60% of U.S. ethanol capacity, according to
securities analysts. Made primarily from corn, ethanol is the
fuel additive that was trumpeted after the 1970s oil shocks
as a way to extend gasoline supplies.</p>
<p>The public's interest waned in the 1980s as petroleum
prices eased. But the ethanol industry was nursed by a
partial exemption from the federal tax on gas.</p>
<p>Now Wall Street expects the ethanol industry's fortunes to
rise again.</p>
<p>Even before the Persian Gulf crisis rejuvenated interest
in alternative fuels, Congress was mulling whether to require
several big cities to use cleaner-burning fuels, such as
ethanol blends, as a way to reduce harmful auto emissions.</p>
<p>Passage of clean-air legislation might double the demand
for ethanol, figures James G. Joyce, an analyst at Prescott
Ball & Turben in New York.</p>
<p>The recent jump in oil prices increases the chance that
Washington will extend past 1993 the controversial tax
exemption on ethanol-blended gasoline. The exemption amounts
to an effective subsidy of 60 cents on a gallon of ethanol.</p>
<p>Without the tax exemption, ethanol isn't cost competitive
with gasoline until crude oil prices are at least $40 a
barrel, according to an Agriculture Department study.</p>
<p>"This could be the watershed event that could lead to
Americans realizing the importance of ethanol," said Clinton
O. Mayer III, an analyst at Bear Stearns in New York.</p>
<p>In the short term, ethanol producers are already reaping
some gains. Ethanol emulates changes in the price of
gasoline. Since Iraq invaded Kuwait a month ago, the
wholesale price of ethanol has climbed by roughly 15%, or 20
cents a gallon, in some markets.</p>
<p>Another windfall for ethanol producers is that the price
of corn, which is one of the biggest expenses of making
ethanol, slipped 6% in August amid forecasts for a good-sized
harvest this autumn.</p>
<p>"The people in the ethanol industry are printing money,"
said Richard T. Gadomski, chief executive of Memphis,
Tenn.-based PSI Group of Cos., which builds ethanol plants.</p>
<p>Archer-Daniels probably stands to benefit the most from a
boost in the ethanol industry because it is widely seen as
the lowest cost producer. It has state-of-the-art facilities
and, unlike some competitors, it can switch three mills
between ethanol and high fructose corn syrup, a sugar
substitute used by the soft drink industry. That flexibility
allows it to run its mills at full capacity.</p>
<p>After Archer-Daniels, the ethanol industry gets small
fast. According to analysts, the second-largest producer is
Pekin Energy, a venture between Texaco and CPC International.
Pekin markets about 80 million gallons annually;
Archer-Daniels's annual ethanol capacity is 700 million
gallons.</p>
<p>It is difficult for analysts to calculate ethanol's effect
on Archer-Daniels' bottom line. Ethanol generates less than
10% of its revenue and the company is tight-lipped about its
numbers.</p>
<p>According to George S. Dahlman, an analyst at Piper
Jaffray & Hopwood, Minneapolis, some investors use the rough
rule of thumb that, on an annual basis, the after-tax
per-share profit of Archer-Daniels increases by 1.5 cents for
every penny-a-gallon increase in the price of ethanol.</p>
<p>An Archer-Daniels official scoffs at the formula, noting
that investors can't know the price of the corn the company
buys nor of the byproducts it sells.</p>
<p>But analysts are intrigued by the possibilities.
Archer-Daniels's annual ethanol capacity works out to about
2.36 gallons for each Archer-Daniels share outstanding.</p>
<p>To be sure, there is reason to be wary about any ethanol
play. Any jump in corn prices could eliminate profits, and
the Midwest crop is unusually vulnerable to a yield-damaging
frost this month because the wet summer slowed its maturity.</p>
<p>Several analysts said oil prices would have to remain high
for several months before they consider revising their
earnings estimates for the company.</p>
<p>Until then, analysts are recommending purchase of
Archer-Daniels for other reasons, such as the prospects for
increased exports to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, and
strong domestic demand for the company's vegetable oil.</p>
<p>Mr. Mayer of Bear Stearns said he is continuing to predict
that the company will earn $1.85 a share for the fiscal year
through June 1991, up 13.5% from fiscal 1990.</p>
