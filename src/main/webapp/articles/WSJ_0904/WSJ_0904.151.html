	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Roger Holtback, president of AB Volvo's car
division since 1984, resigned abruptly to accept a senior
executive post at Sweden's biggest bank, Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken.
   The move comes less than a week after Volvo reported
plunging pretax profit for the third consecutive quarter and
announced plans to slash roughly 15% of the jobs at its
Swedish car plants by the end of next year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said the departure of Mr. Holtback, 45 years old,
reflected a top managment reorganization last year. At that
time, Volvo tapped Stockholm banker Christer Zetterberg as
its new chief operating officer and heir apparent to longtime
chairman and chief executive officer Pehr Gyllenhammar.</p>
<p>The choice of Mr. Zetterberg was a big surprise as Mr.
Gyllenhammar previously pledged his successor would be chosen
from inside the company. Mr. Holtback was considered a
leading contender for the post.</p>
<p>Other industry analysts suggested that the prospects of
diminished autonomy for Volvo's car division under its
planned strategic alliance with France's Renault probably
hastened Mr. Holtback's exit. "It won't be exactly a junior
partnership. But freedom of maneuver for Volvo on the car
side will be much more constrained under the Renault
alliance," said John Lawson, a London-based auto analyst for
Nomura Securities Co.</p>
<p>Volvo said Lennart Jeansson, an executive vice president
heading group financial operations, will succeed Mr.
Holtback. Mr. Jeansson, 49, is a 24-year Volvo veteran who
has spent much of his career at the car division. Most
recently, he was the division's vice president for purchasing
and materials from 1983 to 1986, before assuming control of
group financial operations.</p>
<p>Mr. Jeansson also had strong backing within the company in
last year's contest for the chief operating officer post. He
has been a member of Volvo's executive committee since 1986.</p>
