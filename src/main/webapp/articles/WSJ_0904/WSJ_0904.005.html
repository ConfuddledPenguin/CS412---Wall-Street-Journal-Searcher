	<p class="article-leader">The upturn in business failures that began this spring is
gaining momentum, adding to fears that the U.S. is heading
for a recession.
   Dun & Bradstreet Corp. says the number of business
failures has shot up 11.7% so far this year from the same
1989 period, to 37,400 from 33,500, reversing last year's
strong 13% drop.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Business failures had been on the decline for three years,
a trend that continued through the early months of this year.
But the failure rate rose abruptly in April. Overwhelmingly,
the failed companies are small businesses.</p>
<p>The increase is "almost a straight line, week by week,"
says Dun & Bradstreet chief economist Joseph Duncan. In the
exceptionally grim week ended Aug. 25, the most recent week
recorded, failures totaled 1,348, the highest number this
year and a 46% rise from a year earlier.</p>
<p>The trend suggests that the rise for all of this year
could reach 15%, Mr. Duncan says. But even the depressing
figures don't tell the whole story, he says, because until
fairly recently many failures were new businesses that just
couldn't make a go of it. But now "we're getting real stress
on the balance sheet" of established companies, he says.
"This is a new phenomenon."</p>
<p>Perhaps the sharpest turn for the worse has occurred in
New England, which experienced exceptional growth through the
1980s, economists say. Dun & Bradstreet doesn't have a
breakdown by region. But William Dunkelberg, dean of Temple
University's School of Business and Management, says that
entrepreneurs in New England and elsewhere, infected with the
"exuberance" of an economic expansion, created a glut of
businesses that can't be sustained in hard times. Thus, a
shakeout is inevitable.</p>
<p>"The reality isn't all that bad, but compared with the
dream world they've been in, it's pretty tough," he says.</p>
<p>One example is Hot Heads Haircare Inc., a Topsfield,
Mass., firm selling women's hairpieces to beauty salons. Hot
Heads folded this summer when it defaulted on $170,000 of
debt. Its assets were turned over to the company's creditors.</p>
<p>Richard Nicolo, who helped start the company three years
ago, says Hot Heads' annual sales reached $1.3 million by its
second year. But costs were growing even faster. Instead of
concentrating on controlling costs, Mr. Nicolo spent most of
his time trying to raise money to grow faster. "We were
gearing up for projected sales rather than the sales base
that we had," he says. "We spent a year losing focus."</p>
<p>Dun & Bradstreet's gauge of failures covers only companies
whose collapse entails a loss to creditors. Firms that cease
operations without inflicting such damage outnumber those
that do 4 to 1, it estimates. This would mean that a total of
about 187,000 businesses have closed their doors so far this
year.</p>
<p>Cynthia Latta, senior financial economist at DRI/McGraw
Hill Inc., says she was surprised by the magnitude of the
increase reported by Dun & Bradstreet, though not by the
upward trend itself. With both companies and consumers
cutting spending, and banks getting stingier on lending,
small businesses are getting squeezed, she says. New or
struggling enterprises "haven't been able to accumulate the
capital you need to carry you through hard times," she says.</p>
<p>"All the numbers suggest the economy is on the verge of a
recession," Ms. Latta adds. "This is one more piece of
evidence."</p>
<p>Recession was on the minds of other economists, too. The
Small Business Administration's Bill Whiston rates the chance
50-50 that the economy will contract for two consecutive
quarters, the generally accepted definition of a recession.
And Gordon Richards of the National Association of
Manufacturers says his group has just reversed its position
that an economic "soft landing" will avert a downturn, and is
now forecasting that a mild recession will begin in late
September and last eight months.</p>
<p>Jeff Malone, president of the International Association of
Businesses, which represents about 140,000 small family
concerns, complains that even productive businesses are
finding it hard to compete against price-cutting rivals as
labor and insurance costs go up and the expense of complying
with government regulations rises.</p>
<p>Although economists debate the impact of the credit crunch
on small businesses, Raleigh Minor, a consultant with New
York turnaround-consulting firm Allomet Partners Ltd., says
getting loans has become next to impossible for many
concerns. In the aftermath of the savings-and-loan crisis,
regulators are increasing pressure on banks to tighten credit
standards. Banks in turn are giving small borrowers "a
horribly hard time," Mr. Minor says. "Any firms associated
with real estate . . . smell as if skunks have been all over
them." The recent spurt in oil prices is bound to hurt
businesses such as plastic molders that are dependent on the
petroleum industry for supplies, he adds.</p>
<p>With times getting tougher, experts urge companies to
increase efforts to protect their financial strength. For
instance, some urge intensifying scrutiny of customers'
creditworthiness. Donald Kramer, a St. Louis collection
attorney with more than 100 employees in four offices, says
some credit executives accept orders from companies they know
nothing about, often letting a "fancy-sounding name" fool
them. "A large, unsolicited order is a red flag," he
cautions.</p>
