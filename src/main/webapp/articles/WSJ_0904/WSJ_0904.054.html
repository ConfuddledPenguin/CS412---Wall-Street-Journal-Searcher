	<p class="article-leader">MILWAUKEE -- "People outside Milwaukee have no idea how
important Sept. 4 could be for parents everywhere," says
Polly Williams, the gutsy state legislator who pushed through
the nation's first experiment in educational vouchers for
low-income children. Today, several hundred Milwaukee
children will begin attending a half-dozen or so nonsectarian
private schools, with the state of Wisconsin paying up to
$2,500 of their tuition costs. Public education in America is
about to feel the bracing winds of competition.
   Ms. Williams makes it clear that she doesn't want to
undermine the public schools, just force them to do a better
job. "This is telling public schools that if you want to keep
students, fine. Just educate them. If you can't, let's let as
many hostages out of there as possible."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Teachers unions and educrats understand exactly what Polly
Williams's modest experiment could lead to. The Milwaukee
public schools spend an average of $6,000 a year per student.
The inner-city private schools involved in the choice plan
spend barely half that, and consistently provide a better
education -- even for underachieving students from broken
homes. If the students in the choice program do well, it will
threaten the very foundations of the bureaucratic empire the
public schools have become. They will either have to change
or perish.</p>
<p>Just how bad are the Milwaukee public schools? The 97,000
students in the system (70% black) have a grade point average
of 1.62 (D+). For black students the average GPA is 1.35; for
whites it's 1.98. Almost half of the public school students
drop out without graduating from high school.</p>
<p>Even worse, the system has no quality controls. Not one
teacher out of 6,000 has been fired for poor teaching in at
least five years. Not one of the 1,000 teachers hired since
1985 has been denied tenure.</p>
<p>"It's nearly impossible to get rid of a teacher unless he
or she is involved in a criminal act," says Robert Peters,
principal of Custer High School. A teacher who sexually
abused a female staff member was fired in 1987, but only
after 20 months, $11,000 in costs and a 13-day hearing.</p>
<p>But numbers can't fully convey the problems. An
eye-opening series last year in the Milwaukee Journal put
flesh and blood on the statistics. Priscilla Ahlgren, the
newspaper's education reporter and a former teacher, spent
one week teaching English at Vincent High School, one of 271
schools nationwide recognized for excellence by the U.S.
Department of Education in 1987. Its white enrollment was
43%, one of the highest in the city.</p>
<p>Ms. Ahlgren was amazed at what she found. "The first day,
my lesson plan proved irrelevant," she said in an interview.</p>
<p>Her classes were small, only 15 to 25 students. Even so,
she counted it a success if she just kept order. Students
routinely talked, walked around, and combed the hair of
friends. Some didn't show up all week -- "ghost" students.</p>
<p>She had entered what educators call a culture of low
expectations. "One teacher told me that my first mistake was
assigning homework," she recalls. When Ms. Ahlgren assigned
15 students to read a short story, only two did. Only seven
out of 25 in another class turned an essay in on time. Many
teachers kept their own supplies of paper and pencils, since
few students came to class prepared.</p>
<p>Reading skills at Vincent High were in jeopardy. The
chairman of the English department told Ms. Ahlgren, "When
you give them a reading assignment, they're at Blockbuster
the same night to rent the video." Many teachers go with the
flow and use videos in class, assigning students only a
"sample chapter" of the work. But even this isn't enough:
"Some students refuse to watch black-and-white adaptations
and put their heads down on their desks." After Ms. Ahlgren's
series ran, Vincent High's principal commended her for
"presenting an accurate picture of our school."</p>
<p>Contrast Vincent with Harambee Community School, a private
school only a short drive from Vincent, but a world apart in
atmosphere. It has 160 black students in its grades K-8
program. It stresses the development of a positive self-image
in all aspects of a child's life. Students at Harambee score
between the 75th and 80th percentile in national reading and
mathematics tests. "We don't have better students," says
Principal Callista Robinson. "We have students who are
encouraged to do their best."</p>
<p>Across town from Harambee is the private Urban Day School,
which is governed by the parents whose children attend the
school. Donations and fund-raising allow Urban Day to charge
only $650 a year; some children get full scholarships.
Parents must perform 20 hours of volunteer work or pay an
extra $300.</p>
<p>Zakiya Courtney, Urban Day's executive director, dismisses
arguments that educational choice can work only for parents
who already care deeply about education. "Many of our parents
are single mothers and don't know about quality education,"
she says. "We train them to care about that. They become very
motivated. If a child doesn't show up in uniform or follow
the rules, we send him home." Some 98% of Urban Day graduates
finish high school, and more than 50% go on to college.</p>
<p>There are two public elementary schools within a few
blocks of Urban Day. Both were closed for the summer, but to
even a casual visitor the contrast could not be more
striking. 27th Street School has the look of a prison. Every
entrance door is made of steel; every window has heavy grates
covering it. The signs on the building tell their own story:
One orders visitors to report to the office immediately.
Another offers a $10 reward for the arrest of any "person
found climbing or damaging" the building. In a chilling
metaphor for failure, the American flag is wrapped forlornly
around a flagpole, as dirty and torn as if it had been
carried into a losing battle.</p>
<p>Only a few blocks away is Brown School, closed for years
but reopened last year as a special magnet school to attract
white students into the city's busing program. A visitor is
stunned at its appearance, too, but for entirely different
reasons. Rising out of a poor, gritty neighborhood is a
modern, attractive building. Brand-new playground equipment
beckons invitingly to passing children. The signs "request"
that a visitor go first to the main office.</p>
<p>As a visitor marvels at the attractive hallways glimpsed
through windows, four neighborhood black children walk by
with their mother. When asked if they go to Brown School, one
says: "Oh, no. We go to Lancaster," 30 minutes by bus to the
north. "Brown School is nice, but it's for other people," the
mother, Erica James, says. When asked if she would like her
kids to go to Brown, she replies, "Sure, but they've decided
to bus my kids to Lancaster." Does she think that's fair?
"Not really, but I don't have any say in the matter," Mrs.
James says with a shrug.</p>
<p>Magnet schools like Brown are a skewed byproduct of
Milwaukee's misguided attempts to put integration ahead of
education. They offer specialized instruction and superior
teaching. However, many minority students are shut out of the
magnet schools because they would disturb their carefully
calibrated racial balance. Brown, for example, draws many of
its students from white families who drop their kids off on
the way to work in downtown Milwaukee. Unlike other public
schools, it offers pre- and after-school "program
enrichments" that amount to free day care from 7 a.m. to 6
p.m. (Milwaukee school officials did not return phone calls
about Brown.)</p>
<p>George Mitchell is a Milwaukee consultant who says the
contrasts between Brown and 27th Street have turned him into
a crusader for radical education reform. In the early 1980s
he served as acting state budget chief, and in 1984
Democratic Gov. Tony Earl appointed him to chair a
blue-ribbon commission on the Milwaukee schools.</p>
<p>But his real epiphany came when he moved his family from
the calm state capital of Madison to Milwaukee. As a sincere
liberal, he wanted to send his children to the city's public
schools. He first arranged a meeting to have the city's
school busing program explained to him.</p>
<p>"It was complicated, but I was told my kids would have a
wide range of options, including good magnet schools," he
recalls. But as the meeting ended, Mr. Mitchell casually
mentioned that while he was white, his children, both
adopted, were Asian and black. "Suddenly, everything
changed," he said. "The fellow sighed and said that, of
course, everything would be different because my children
were nonwhite." Mr. Mitchell listened in mounting horror to
the details. "My wife and I did the only rational thing," he
says. "We moved to the suburbs."</p>
<p>Howard Fuller is a black educator who is now director of
the Department of Health and Human Services in Milwaukee. He
graduated from North Division High School in 1959, and felt
he got a fine education even though his school lacked many of
the resources of suburban schools. Asked to pinpoint the most
significant change at North Division since he left, he names
athletics. "When I went there you had to have good grades to
be on a team. Now you have kids who barely have a D average
playing. When parents asked for a minimum C average to play,
they were roundly criticized by the coaches for demanding the
impossible."</p>
<p>Mikel Holt, editor of the largest black newspaper in the
state, graduated from North Division 10 years after Mr.
Fuller. He says he too got a good education, but that changed
for students in the 1970s. "The reason is desegregation, to
some extent," he says. "That and the teachers unions got much
more powerful. Schools lost their autonomy."</p>
<p>Teachers union members may have won the battle for control
of the public schools, but they are conscientious objectors
when it comes to sending their kids to them. A 1987
University of Wisconsin survey found that 62% of Milwaukee
teachers wouldn't want their children to attend the school at
which they teach. It's no wonder then that nearly half of the
children of Milwaukee's public school teachers attend private
schools, double the average for all school-age children. Few
send their children to non-magnet public schools.</p>
<p>Polly Williams says there is a simpler method than choice
to force Milwaukee schools to improve. She thinks it's time
that teachers and administrators fully experience the system
they have created. She is about to introduce legislation
requiring everyone who works in the public schools to send
their children to neighborhood public schools. "We already
make police officers and teachers live in the city they work
in," she says. "Why shouldn't teachers have a more direct
stake in the schools they teach in?"</p>
<p>If Ms. Williams is surprised at the backlash her
educational choice program has generated, she should just
wait until the school bureaucracy hears about her latest
idea.</p>
