	<p class="article-leader">ST. LOUIS, Mo. -- Apex Oil Co. emerged from Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceedings, significantly smaller than when it
filed for protection from creditors on Christmas Eve, 1987.
   The closely held concern grew from a tiny oil-trading and
transportation operation to become, partly through its highly
leveraged 1981 acquisition of Clark Oil & Refining Co., a
petroleum conglomerate with annual revenue of about $13
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But after the company had big losses in oil futures
trading, and the value of its oil inventory tumbled because
of the petroleum market's mid-decade slump, Apex's lenders
pulled the plug on vital loan agreements.</p>
<p>Apex cleared its debts with secured lenders in full in
1988, by selling its Clark Oil unit to a partnership composed
of Horsham Corp., Toronto, and Apex owners Paul A. Novelly
and Samuel R. Goldstein.</p>
<p>Under the court-approved reorganization, Messrs. Goldstein
and Novelly will together lend $15 million to Apex. Banque
Indosuez of Geneva and Banque Paribas of New York each loaned
Apex $15 million in the reorganization.</p>
<p>Apex's unsecured holders will receive as much as $20
million in cash, $20 million in seven-year notes secured by
Apex assets to be sold over two years, and $20 million in
10-year notes secured by a portion of anticipated profits
from Clark Oil Trading Co. Clark Oil Trading, owned by
Messrs. Novelly & Goldstein, isn't associated with the bigger
Clark Oil & Refining unit that was sold, nor did it ever come
under Chapter 11 protection.</p>
<p>The settlement with unsecured debtholders represents
payment of 64 cents to 86 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>Apex, which said it operated profitably throughout the
Chapter 11 period, now plans to focus on its oil trading, oil
terminal and shipping operations.</p>
