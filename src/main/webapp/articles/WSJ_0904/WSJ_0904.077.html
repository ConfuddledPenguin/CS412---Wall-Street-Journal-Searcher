	<p class="article-leader">If the United Nations is indeed interested in restoring
its relevance, there is an increasingly urgent project that
world leaders might take up in Burma. It is now more than
three months since the Burmese people voted overwhelmingly to
end the socialist repression that over the past 28 years has
wrecked their once-thriving nation. But the military
dictators in Rangoon haven't budged. Instead, they've kept
their security forces busy with tasks such as shooting to
death at least four peaceful demonstrators on August 8 in
Mandalay, according to Amnesty International.
   The signs are that the ruling military junta, apparently
led by General Khin Nyunt, miscalculated in allowing
relatively fair polling in the May 27 elections. Though some
of the opposition's strongest leaders were hampered in the
campaign by being held in prison or under house arrest,
voters gave some 80% of the seats and 60% of the popular vote
to the opposition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So far, the Rangoon junta hasn't even offered the winners
office space. The main opposition party's secretary-general,
Aung Sun Suu Kyi, remains under the house arrest imposed more
than a year ago. Its chairman, Tin Oo -- reportedly ailing --
is still serving a three-year sentence of hard labor, imposed
last December.</p>
<p>Burma's dictator, Ne Win, officially stepped down when the
junta took over to crush huge street protests in 1988. But Ne
Win is widely believed to be keeping a hand in the
organization's policies of gulag government. These have
recently included big resettlement programs, reminiscent of
Khmer Rouge tactics in the 1970s in Cambodia, apparently
aimed at breaking up pockets of political unrest. Tens of
thousands of Burmese have been moved from the cities to the
countryside. One Western diplomat based in Rangoon told us
earlier this year that in some cases entire neighborhoods in
the capital had been moved out. The resettlement areas are
officially off-limits to outsiders.</p>
<p>Burma's sad experience should leave us all leery of
trusting the sweeter promises offered by the tyrants of
Asia's similarly bleak Marxist nations -- Vietnam, Cambodia,
Laos, China and North Korea. But if the junta can somehow be
forced to honor the opposition victory at the polls, Burma's
example could yet help inspire an East European-style sweep
in Asia. Asia's tragedy is that the revolts in China and
Burma have rattled but not yet broken the chains.</p>
