	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Hong Kong watchmakers believe they may be on
the cusp of a major export spurt, thanks to the anticipated
easing of a local labeling rule.
   The change would permit Hong Kong manufacturers to stamp
such designations as "Swiss" or "Japan" on the faces of
locally assembled watches whose movements originated in those
places.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The relaxed rules, expected early next year in the
government's code covering point-of-origin designations, may
boost foreign watch sales some 30% to 40%, according to
leaders of the local industry. Hong Kong made roughly
two-fifths of the 260 million timepieces sold last year, they
said.</p>
<p>Producers from Japan and Taiwan are likely to shift some
operations to the colony, where their major parts suppliers
are located, once the looser rules are implemented, they
claim. And local makers should find new market niches opening
to them.</p>
<p>The new labeling rule is considered a major easing in the
current stringent guidelines that apply to Hong Kong's 1,300
watchmaking companies. They require that if an origin label
is prominently used, it must reflect where the final assembly
work was done. Consequently, even if a watch's key parts came
from Switzerland, the final product couldn't bear the
European label if the labor-intensive final packaging work
was done by a local company either in the colony or
neighboring Guangdong Province, where many of its factories
are located.</p>
<p>Industry executives say origin labeling is a critical
marketing tool.</p>
<p>Bob Chong, president of the Hong Kong Watch Manufacturers
Association, a leading trade association, conceded that while
Hong Kong producers have come a long way since the early
1960s when watches first took on local industrial
significance, the colony's products still don't have much
panache.</p>
<p>"We have an image problem here, being associated with
cheap watches," he conceded. "We should be more appealing
after the change."</p>
<p>He and others have battled for looser labeling rules since
the mid-1980s. But the government had resisted their pleas
until last year when Switzerland finally codified its own
watch-labeling rules, according to Patrick Li, a trade
department official involved in the issue. Once Bern's rules
were established, Hong Kong began the process of drafting
roughly parallel regulations, which are in line with those in
most other countries.</p>
<p>Mr. Chong said the move would provide a badly needed shot
in the arm for the industry. While some believe it could
ultimately lead to a doubling in total foreign sales, he said
an increase of 30% to 40% within the first year is more
realistic.</p>
<p>Hong Kong sold approximately 110 million watches in 1990
valued at 16.3 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$2.09 billion).
But the value was down 1% on the year, following jumps of 20%
to 40% over much of the decade, industry and government data
show.</p>
<p>And things aren't shaping up much better this year. While
sales were up 4% in the first half to HK$7.7 billion, Mr.
Chong said Middle East buyers started scrapping orders when
the Persian Gulf crisis began. Further cancellations are
likely from the U.S., Europe and Japan if the global economy
slows further.</p>
<p>He added, however, that locally produced watches should be
less sensitive to a recession than other consumer goods
because they retail at a relatively modest price, generally
in the range of $15 to $100.</p>
<p>Executives said the increased production would be
accounted for partly from foreign producers relocating
production to Hong Kong and southern China.</p>
<p>A large number of them remain outside Hong Kong chiefly
because foreign origin labels are important to their
marketing strategy, according to Samson Sun, who has spent
more than 30 years in the industry and churns out more than a
half million watches a month in conjunction with Japan's
Citizen Watch Co. But the Hong Kong-southern China region
should draw many producers after the change goes into effect
because they could retain their existing point-of-origin
designations and still benefit from being close to their
local suppliers, as well as China's extremely low wages.</p>
<p>Mr. Chong added that local producers will also benefit
from the changes by being able to produce more upscale
products whose faces bear the origin of their foreign
movements.</p>
