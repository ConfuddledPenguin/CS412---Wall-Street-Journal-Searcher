	<p class="article-leader">The two largest Dutch banks, Algemene Bank Nederland N.V.,
or ABN, and Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank N.V., or Amro, which
merged Aug. 24 to form ABN-Amro Holding N.V., reported that
their joint net income for the first half rose 1.9% to 703
million guilders ($398.3 million) from 690 million guilders a
year earlier.
   The profit was in line with analysts' expectations.
Earnings per share fell 5.5% to 2.77 guilders from 2.93
guilders. As part of the merger, shares in ABN and Amro were
exchanged for ABN-Amro Holding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two banks also declared an interim dividend of 1.40
guilders a share in ABN-Amro Holding. This compares with
interim payouts in 1989 of 1.40 guilders from ABN and 2.60
guilders from Amro. ABN-Amro Holding shares were priced on
par with ABN shares.</p>
<p>Income, including categories such as interest income and
commissions, rose 4.7% to 4.93 billion guilders. Pre-tax
operating profit slipped less than 1% to 1.55 billion
guilders, but this was offset by a lower tax burden that was
reduced to 234 million guilders from 272 million guilders.</p>
