	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Since last year's World Series I have
refrained from making jocular references to earthquakes, but
I could have sworn the stadium wobbled a bit here Friday when
Linda Ferrando, the 82nd-ranked women's tennis player,
defeated No. 3 Monica Seles in a third-round match at the
U.S. Open. Women's tennis in recent years has been a decorous
affair, with the common folks giving their betters their due,
and then some.
   At the least, Ferrando beating Seles was comparable to
Kansas State beating Nebraska at football, and the upset
remained an exception here. Thirteen of the 16 seeded ladies
advanced in stately fashion to the fourth round, including
numbers 1,2,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To one observer, however, the match merely affirmed what
she has been saying for years. "We've got lots of girls who
can really play -- it's a misconception that a few dominate,"
declared Billie Jean King.</p>
<p>Well, okay. I guess that shows one needn't be right about
everything to be worth listening to, and King certainly is.
If anyone can speak authoritatively about women's tennis, she
can.</p>
<p>For starters, she was quite a player, the winner of 39
Grand Slam singles and doubles titles over a 21-year span
that ended in 1981. For seconds, she was an organizer while
still playing, and in a few weeks will mark the 20th
anniversary of the day that she and a few other hardy females
ceased being the caboose on the tennis train and launched
their own tour, beginning with a tournament in Houston.</p>
<p>She continues as a honcho in the sport, serving as
commissioner of a professional team tennis league that
survives if not prospers, and a related, grassroots
organization that has brought the joy of the game to
thousands. She's a TV commentator, employed at the Open by
the USA cable network. She helped coach Martina Navratilova
to an unprecedented ninth Wimbledon singles title a couple
months back. When Life magazine recently took it upon itself
to choose the 100 "most influential" Americans of this
century, she was one of four athletes to make the list, along
with Muhammad Ali, Jackie Robinson and Babe Ruth.</p>
<p>Most impressively, she was, perhaps, the only person ever
to singlehandedly launch a popular boom in her sport. That
happened on Sept. 20, 1973, when her nationally televised
trouncing of Bobby Riggs, a sixty-something male ex-champ,
loosed millions of new racquet wavers onto the courts of an
unprepared land.</p>
<p>"Ah, the boom -- we really messed that up, didn't we?"
sighs King, now 46 years old, thinking back to tennis's
short-lived heyday. "We finally got the people out, and we
didn't know what to do with them. Instead of trying to teach
them the game, and find ways they could enjoy it at any
level, the clubs tried to sell them clothes.</p>
<p>"I think if we'd had our team-tennis recreational leagues
then, it might have turned out differently. The team format
gets people involved in ways that regular tournaments don't,
and we use divisions so that people can compete against their
peers. We run events where the 20 best players can't play,
and you should see the fun everyone has] People don't care if
they're double-faulting as long as the other guy does it once
in awhile, too."</p>
<p>King says she promotes tennis partly in the name of
physical fitness. "It's not boring, like jogging or aerobics,
so once people get involved in it, they stay," she asserts.
But the upper reaches of the game still beckon, and, thus,
she joined the skilled but emotionally fragile Navratilova,
33, a fourth-round victim to ninth-seeded Manuela
Maleeva-Fragniere here Sunday, as a sort of ego coach.</p>
<p>"Martina and I used to play doubles together, and a couple
years ago she came to me when she was getting frustrated
about her game and not being able to beat Steffi {Graf, the
new No. 1}," King says. "I asked her why, with all she'd
accomplished, she was still playing at all, and she shrugged.
I told her that unless she had a reason, maybe she should
quit, and that she'd better confront herself about it.</p>
<p>"I told her that once she set her own goals, her other
coach, Craig Kardon, and I could help her reach them, but
that we couldn't supply her with motivation. She thought
things out, and decided she wanted to win a ninth Wimbledon
and a Virginia Slims championship in November. Those have
been her goals this year."</p>
<p>King smiles and adds: "Martina's taking things one at a
time now, and doing better -- as long as we take precautions
like clipping out any stories about her in the newspapers
before we let her read them."</p>
<p>King keeps her hand in with her game's younger set, too;
when Jennifer Capriati, the 14-year-old marvel, made her pro
debut at a Florida tournament last spring, Billie Jean was
there to team with her in the doubles. She found in the
strapping youngster a kindred soul.</p>
<p>"Jennifer didn't stop talking the whole time we played;
she's just like me when I was a kid," King chuckles. "She's
got a great game -- wonderful, strong ground strokes -- and a
marvelous attitude. This kid just loves tennis. Anybody who
thinks her parents are pushing her to play are crazy. She's
pulling harder than anybody could push."</p>
<p>I noted that, during a telecast last week, King
consistently referred to Capriati as a "child." She nodded.
"I got some calls on that from people who thought I was
saying it disapprovingly, trying to make the point that
Jennifer shouldn't be playing as a pro so young. That
couldn't be further from the truth.</p>
<p>"I guess, knowing Jennifer, I'm impressed with the
childlike enthusiasm she brings to tennis. She's like we all
should be when we play -- totally into it. We're never more
like children than when we're playing games, you know. Maybe
that's why some of us try to stay around them as long as we
can."</p>
