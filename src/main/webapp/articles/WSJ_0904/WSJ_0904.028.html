	<p class="article-leader">STAMFORD, Conn. -- Vestron Inc. reported a narrower loss
for the second quarter and said it wasn't able to make
interest payments due last Saturday on certain debentures.
   The video distributor and movie maker, which has agreed to
be acquired by Live Entertainment Inc., reported its loss
shrank to $12.4 million, or 33 cents a share, from $65
million, or $1.73 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Revenue dropped 36% to $33.9 million from $52.7 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Vestron also reported that because of insufficient funds
and other conditions in its credit facility with Chemical
Banking Corp., its agent, it couldn't meet interest payments
on its 9% convertible debentures due 2011.</p>
<p>The company said it doesn't expect to satisfy conditions
that will allow it to make interest payments "in the
foreseeable future." Vestron added that its banks may at any
time issue a notice of default, which would prohibit interest
payments for 120 days.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Vestron closed at 31.25 cents, down 9.375 cents.</p>
