	<p class="article-leader">The attorney general of Colorado is investigating charges
that Adolph Coors Co., leader of a national campaign to clean
up the nation's waters, knowingly hid the fact that it had
leaky pipes at a can plant, pipes that allegedly contaminated
nearby springs in the 1970s and early 1980s.
   The investigation means that Coors, which already faces
civil charges of water-law violation, could be slapped with
criminal charges as well. Both could result in financial
penalties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Already, though, the allegations represent a
public-relations disaster. Coors, based in Golden, Colo., has
long boasted in its advertisements about the pureness of its
beer because it contains Rocky Mountain spring water. And
these days Peter Coors, brewery division president, can be
seen on national television encouraging viewers to follow
Coors in its support of Pure Water 2000, an environmental
organization to which the company last year decided to donate
$1 million.</p>
<p>The company's credibility as a clean-water crusader isn't
helped by the water-pollution charges, acknowledged Coors
spokesman Jon Goldman. "We're facing some embarrassment," he
said.</p>
<p>The alleged contamination by Coors was first disclosed
early this year by a Colorado television station after
receiving a tip.</p>
<p>In response, Coors hired an attorney to investigate, and
the resulting report confirmed that contamination had
occurred, but not to a degree that posed any health hazard.</p>
<p>Coors presented its findings to the Colorado Department of
Health's Water Quality Control Division, which conducted its
own investigation and in June brought civil charges against
the company. The agency contended, among other things, that
groundwater contaminated with organic chemicals, including
one probable carcinogen, was released from a well under the
company's can plant into Clear Creek, a source of water for
five municipalities, from 1982 to 1985.</p>
<p>The violations carry civil fines of up to $10,000 a day,
and Coors' illegal discharges continued for more than 4,000
days, the agency's report said. In contamination cases of
long duration, fines are usually negotiated, or else
determined by a judge.</p>
<p>In June, Sandra Woods, Coors vice president for
environmental affairs, predicted that within 30 days a
penalty would be negotiated that she said would be "very fair
to Coors."</p>
<p>But more than two months later, no agreement has been
reached, and though Coors officials say they still hope to
settle the matter out of court, an investigator for the water
agency, Patricia Nelson, said last week that she saw little
chance of that. "We are going forward with plans for a formal
hearing" before a judge, she said.</p>
<p>Now, with the attorney general having instituted his own
investigation, Coors could find itself under attack in two
separate legal arenas.</p>
<p>For their part, Coors officials said the attorney
general's investigation came as no surprise. "When we brought
this problem to the attention of the state we expected these
investigations, and we are fully cooperating," Mr. Goldman
said.</p>
