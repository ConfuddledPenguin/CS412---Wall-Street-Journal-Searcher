	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American International Group Inc., a
multinational insurer, said it completed its acquisition of
International Lease Finance Corp. on Friday, shortly after
shareholders of the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based jet-leasing
company approved the transaction, valued at $1.3 billion.
   International Lease holders accepted American
International's cash-and-stock offer, even though American
International shares had traded for several days below
$66.40, a level in the acquisition agreement that would have
allowed either company to walk away from the deal. Officials
at both companies had said they were eager to complete the
transaction.</p>
