	<p class="article-leader">When economic storm clouds gather, investors often seek
cover by switching out of stocks and into bonds. But a look
at history shows that bonds don't always live up to their
reputation as sturdy shelters in tough economic times.
   Even money managers who strongly recommend bonds warn that
investors must be careful about which types of bonds they
buy, what maturities, and how they time their purchases
during periods of economic sluggishness.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Generally speaking, it's probably safe to predict that
bonds will do well in recessions," says Richard Berner, an
economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. "But remember, no two
recessions are identical."</p>
<p>Long-term bonds were spectacular investments in the
1981-1982 recession. As inflation and interest rates fell,
investors in long-term Treasury bonds earned a total return
(income plus price change) for the recession period of 43.93%
and those holding long-term corporate bonds earned 43.74%,
statistics compiled by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. show.
Stock-market investors, meanwhile, had to be content with a
total return of 9.9%, as measured by Standard & Poor's
500-stock index.</p>
<p>But in the brief 1980 recession, at a time when inflation
was very high, stocks proved better investments than
long-term government bonds. Shearson's index of long-term
government bonds showed a total return of about 6.05%,
compared with a return of 8.86% on the stocks in the S&P 500.</p>
<p>Looking back further, to the 1973-1975 recession, bonds
produced higher returns than stocks did. But short-term
Treasury bills did better than either stocks or long-term
bonds. Statistics compiled by BARRA, a Berkeley, Calif.,
investment research firm, show short-term Treasury bills
returned 10.35% over that period. That compared with 7.34% on
long-term Treasury bonds and 0.98% on long-term corporate
bonds, according to Shearson.</p>
<p>The 1973-1975 slump is being re-examined with special
attention these days, since it came amid surging oil prices
and higher inflation.</p>
<p>History also underscores the importance of paying close
attention to credit quality. For example, investors who
bought low-rated corporate bonds in the 1973-1975 recession
suffered sizable losses, says Virginia Henneberry, first vice
president at Shearson. Those who bought Treasury issues did
much better.</p>
<p>Timing can be tricky, too. As the accompanying chart
shows, bond yields frequently rise and prices tumble in the
very early stages of recessions (see accompanying
illustration -- WSJ Sept. 4, 1990). Then, as the economic
downturn becomes more fully established, yields fall and
prices rise. Thus, investors who rush to bonds for safety
shortly before the onset of a recession can get burned. Bond
traders say it's frequently better to wait to buy bonds until
after the recession has started.</p>
<p>Don't assume, though, that interest rates will always be
lower after a recession than beforehand. Although bond yields
fell sharply in 1981-1982, that didn't happen in 1973-1975;
yields actually ended the recession higher than they were
before the slump began.</p>
<p>So where does all this leave jittery investors seeking a
haven from what appears at least to be a weakening economy?</p>
<p>Those who are unsure where the economy is headed, but fear
that inflation is about to soar, may prefer short-term
Treasury bills and bank certificates of deposit. Either could
be a better bet in coming months than long-term bonds or
stocks if inflation should rise.</p>
<p>For investors who suspect the recession will be more
severe and prolonged than generally expected, history does
favor bonds. Even though bond prices frequently drop in the
very early stages of recessions, several analysts say a
severe economic slump would eventually quash inflation
pressures and make bonds sparkle once again, as they did in
1981-1982.</p>
<p>Investors who do decide to buy bonds will probably come
out best with Treasury issues, many leading money managers
and economists agree. "Stick with Treasurys, Treasurys and
Treasurys -- nothing but Treasurys," advises William H.
Gross, a managing director of Pacific Investment Management
Co. in Newport Beach, Calif.</p>
<p>An important reason for favoring Treasurys over corporate
bonds is corporate America's huge borrowing spree in the
1980s, several money managers say. They argue that so many
companies sank so deeply into debt that the next recession
will bring severe financial strains. When that happens, they
argue, Treasurys will offer better total returns than
corporates, especially lower-rated corporates.</p>
<p>Several investment managers also recommend
intermediate-term and long-term, top-rated municipal bonds.
That's partly because they fear Congress will raise taxes to
close the budget gap, increasing the attractiveness of
tax-free bonds.</p>
<p>Utility bonds may also have a place in the portfolios of
investors who want higher yields than those offered by
Treasurys. Statistics from Shearson and Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets show intermediate and long-term utility bonds
produced very high returns in the 1981-1982 recession,
topping both comparable Treasurys and industrial bonds.
Utility bonds also did well in the 1980 recession,
outperforming both Treasurys and industrials, although they
didn't fare as well in the 1973-1975 slump.</p>
<p>Money managers disagree about whether intermediate-term
bonds (those maturing in five to 10 years) or long-term bonds
(with maturities of 10 to 30 years) will prove to be the most
rewarding. Several fear long-term bonds won't perform nearly
as well as the shorter-term issues for at least the next few
months.</p>
<p>Intermediate-term bonds "have often been a better place to
be than long bonds" during the past three recessions, says
Thomas Sowanick, senior strategist at Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets. In each of the past two recessions, the yield curve
steepened, meaning that short-term and intermediate-term
rates fell more than longterm rates.</p>
<p>Some individual investors use a diversification strategy
known as "laddering." That approach involves buying bonds of
widely varying maturities, ranging from short-term to
long-term. Short-term bonds look best when interest rates
surge, while longer-term bonds are better when interest rates
tumble. These investors typically arrange their holdings so
that they have a certain amount of their bonds coming due
each year, providing new cash to reinvest.</p>
