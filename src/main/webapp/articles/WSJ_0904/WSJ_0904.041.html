	<p class="article-leader">Oxford, England -- The slim, boyish man wearing round
granny glasses opened the door of his large Victorian, North
Oxford house to me. The inner door had a big no-smoking sign
posted on it. The house itself is a very desirable piece of
real estate, probably now worth $1 million, with its vast
garden divided into five or six separate "rooms," one of
which contains a swimming pool. It was built sometime after
1880, when Oxford dons were first allowed to marry, as a
modest home for a university teacher with a family and the
necessary servants.
   The owner, Ian McEwan, one of England's most critically
praised authors, can afford to keep this domestic
establishment because he received an advance of #250,000
(about $486,000) for his latest novel, "The Innocent"
(Doubleday, 271 pages, $18.95). The book has been near the
top of the British best-seller list for more than three
months and it's earned Mr. McEwan wide critical attention in
the U.S. for the first time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The Innocent" is a love story, with the atmosphere and
structure of a spy thriller, set in Berlin in 1955, in which
the lovers' relationship echoes and is affected by the
just-starting Cold War. The story culminates in the death and
dismemberment, related at length and in graphic detail, of
the woman's former husband.</p>
<p>Anyone who read Mr. McEwan's earlier novels would have
expected gore and perversity. In "The Cement Garden," four
orphaned children entomb their dead mother in concrete in a
trunk in the basement of the house they do not wish to leave.
"The Comfort of Strangers" is the story of a beautiful young
man killed as an act of love by a sadomasochistic older
couple; and in the superbly crafted "The Child in Time," a
five-year-old child is snatched from her father in a
supermarket.</p>
<p>In Mr. McEwan's short stories a writer makes love to her
pet ape, a businessman copulates with a shop-window dummy,
and child abuse and incest are ordinary events. In 1979 the
BBC lost its nerve and canceled a McEwan teleplay because one
of the essential props was a jar containing a large pickled
penis.</p>
<p>The man behind these eldritch provocations is a
respectable, middle-class husband and family man of 42 years.
He and his wife, Penny, have four children, two boys and two
teen-aged girls by her first marriage. The seven-year-old boy
will be starting at the nearby Dragon School, England's
smartest "prep school," in the autumn. Father and son are
often to be seen swimming and socializing at its handsome
pool during this exceptionally hot summer, "just for a change
of scenery" from their own pool.</p>
<p>It was so hot and sunny when I called on Mr. McEwan that
we had difficulty finding a shady spot in the garden to drink
the tea that he had made in a good china pot. His mother
probably would have prepared tea for a visitor in just this
way, and served it, too, with proper cups, not mugs. Mr.
McEwan was born into an army family -- his father retired
with the rank of major -- and had a conventional English
education, majoring in English at the University of Sussex
and acquiring a master's degree from the University of East
Anglia. There, in 1970, he fell into the orbit of the
novelist Malcolm Bradbury, and it is often said that he is a
Bradbury protege, but this is not entirely correct: "The
course had not yet taken form -- nobody else had applied --
and I was influenced by the presence of other writers, as
well, such as Angus Wilson."</p>
<p>Mr. McEwan had never written any fiction, but managed to
produce two short stories in as many weeks, and had finished
most of the stories that make up "First Love, Last Rites" in
a year. He had found his metier, and critical success came
rapidly. By 1975 the stories were between hard covers, and by
the mid-'80s he'd had two television plays produced, written
the libretto of an oratorio, and won no fewer than three film
credits as well as the valuable Whitbread Award (for "The
Child in Time," 1987). He has just completed the screenplay
of "The Innocent."</p>
<p>Mr. McEwan enjoys the literary life, and sees a lot,
socially, of the writers of his generation. In Oxford this
includes the poets Craig Raine and James Fenton, the travel
writer Redmond O'Hanlon and the novelist Candia McWilliam;
only a couple of days after he gave me tea, I saw him at a
party for Julian Barnes at London's literary establishment,
the Groucho Club. While he doesn't think of himself as
political, he was a founding member of Lady Antonia Fraser's
anti-Thatcherite salon socialists, who called themselves the
June 20th Group, after the date of their first meeting. More
significantly, Mr. McEwan was an early supporter and is a
frequent public speaker for Charter 88, a group that wants
constitutional reform and a written bill of rights for
Britain. He has been brave enough to join those of his fellow
writers who have spoken out in defense of Salman Rushdie.</p>
<p>It doesn't really add up. Pleasant-looking, "bien
pensant", clean-living and soft spoken, he is apparently
guileless. Open and easy to talk to, a good host, a constant
and thoughtful husband, an adoring and active father of small
children. How can such nightmare visions be constructed by
such a mild-mannered chap? How can such a balanced and by all
accounts loving person display such affection for mayhem and
mutilation?</p>
<p>Did he, I asked, have as much difficulty in writing the
dissection scene of "The Innocent" as I did in reading it?
No, he said, he never flinched from the task of describing
how to cut up a body efficiently in a cold-water flat. It was
essential, not only to the plot, but to the effect of comic
relief as the hero, Leonard, struggles to dispose of the
large and heavy suitcases in which he has packed the remains,
and that attract the unwelcome attentions of a hungry dog.</p>
<p>In order to make this ghastly scene as anatomically
correct as possible, he consulted Dr. Michael Dunhill, the
Oxford University lecturer in pathology. But he declined to
take up Dr. Dunhill's invitation to attend one of his routine
8:30 Monday-morning post-mortems.</p>
<p>Of course, as Mr. McEwan reminds me, fiction proceeds from
the imagination, not necessarily from experience. This
obviously implies, he hastens to add before I make the point
myself, that his own imagination is peopled with these
unlovely and badly behaved characters, and of course, the
blood and the lust, the pus, the snot and excrement, must all
be there, somewhere in his unconscious. He only deploys them,
lovingly though his narrators may dwell upon their details,
as adjuncts to craftsmanship, to achieve literary effects.
What those who accuse him of sensationalism overlook is that
almost everything he has ever written is a love story. What
concerns him, almost exclusively, is love between men and
women (though both are sometimes under-age or in some other
way ineligible). Few other living writers are capable of
writing as tenderly about the act of love, few others are so
genuinely interested in the emotion of love. There is a sound
Gothic tradition in English letters, from "Monk" Lewis to
Mary Shelley, where writers, often on the left, occasionally
dip their nibs in gore. Though he denies that he feels "much
affinity with these late 18th-century novelists," Ian McEwan
may well be our last Romantic.</p>
