   To Catch the Uncounted</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ONCE preliminary data from the 1990 census are subjected
to a series of crosschecks and comparisons with public
records, any shortfall in the numbers will be largely
corrected, the Census Bureau says.</p>
<p>Now that the census is computerized, the count can be
compared with birth, death and other records to assess its
accuracy. These comparisons show that past censuses missed
minority men in poor central-city neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Census Bureau officials say they have enough safety nets
in place to catch the people who fell through the broad mesh
of this year's mail questionnaire and personal follow-up
calls. One is a detailed review by local officials currently
under way against local records such as utility hookups.
Another is a series of computerized checks of completed
census forms. Statistician Clifford Clogg of Pennsylvania
State University told a recent congressional hearing, "In my
judgment, our Census Bureau is the world leader on such
technology for checking data."</p>
<p>Mr. Clogg and other statisticians who participated in the
annual meeting of the American Statistical Association last
month said they are satisfied with the census procedures.
These include a check provided by a nationwide sample survey
just drawing to a close. This survey would provide numbers to
adjust the final counts statistically, as several large
cities and states have requested.</p>
<p>Next July 15, the secretary of commerce will announce his
decision for or against such an adjustment. Given the
criteria his office has developed, many experts say a
negative decision is inevitable. That will send the cities
and states back to court and delay the release of detailed
census data. Meanwhile, the broad, presumably final counts
that the bureau will deliver for reapportionment to Congress
by Dec. 31 will carry a warning that they are subject to
adjustment.</p>
<p>Figures Confirm Trends</p>
<p>In Migratory Patterns</p>
<p>BEFORE Washington considers the census numbers final, the
tally will rise. But in some places, it's already plenty
high.</p>
<p>The preliminary census figures confirm the diagonal
movement of Americans from North and East to South and West.
The winners get political power in the form of more seats in
Congress. California alone will gain seven seats, giving it
52. New York, now barely the second largest state, will
probably drop to 31 seats, according to the Washington, D.C.,
consulting firm Election Data Services.</p>
<p>But California, now home to nearly one in eight Americans,
isn't crowing. Its water and road systems are already
strained by population growth. Even laissez faire Los Angeles
has a corps of water police this summer, watching for signs
of illicit lawn watering. So, many Californians wonder when
the migration will end.</p>
<p>The answer appears to be: not anytime soon. Nearly 60% of
California's growth in the 1980s came from migration, double
the national rate, Census Bureau estimates show.</p>
<p>Much of this migration comes from abroad. Justice
Department figures show California is by far the preferred
destination of immigrants. The state has a built-in magnet in
its large Hispanic and Asian-American populations. Immigrants
generally go where their fellow countrymen have gone before
them.</p>
<p>No matter how bad its water or air problems, California
will still attract migrants so long as opportunities there
outweigh opportunities elsewhere. It may not be the paradise
it used to be, but it will have to become a purgatory before
potential migrants decide to stay home.</p>
<p>Businesses May Find</p>
<p>Limited Use for Data</p>
<p>DETAILED census data probably will be delayed by the
adjustment-for-undercount debate. This delay will limit the
usefulness of the 1990 census for business.</p>
<p>Even if the current schedule is met, tabulations linking
demographics and dollars by neighborhood won't be available
until 1992. And unlike wines, data for business use don't
improve with age.</p>
<p>Moreover, users are beginning to question just how
accurate the detailed data will be. New York City demographer
Evelyn Mann says the emergency procedures the Census Bureau
used to boost its response rate "thinned" the sample of
households that filled out the detailed questionnaire. One in
eight households was supposed to fill out the longer
questionnaire in neighborhoods that contained 2,000 or more
housing units, one in six households elsewhere.</p>
<p>But the emergency procedures, such as taking the census
over telephone hot lines, or getting information from
neighbors about housing units that didn't respond to repeated
calls, limited the number of units in the long-form sample.
Ms. Mann says the data will be biased toward those who
cooperated with the census -- namely older, better-educated
Americans.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>THE COST of counting each housing unit in 1980 dollars
rose from $5 in 1950 to $12 in 1980, and will reach an
estimated $17 in 1990, according to the General Accounting
Office. . . . General Motors marketing executive Vincent
Barraba, who directed the 1980 census, recently said, "The
ultimate indignity was being sued by the city of New York for
incompetence and inefficiency."</p>
