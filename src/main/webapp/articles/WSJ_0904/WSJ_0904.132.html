	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Supreme Court blocked
release of a psychologist's tape-recorded conversations with
the two sons of slain Live Entertainment Inc. Chairman Jose
Menendez and his wife, Kitty.
   The tapes, due to have been released to prosecutors today,
could be a key piece of evidence in the case against the
sons, Lyle and Erik Menendez, accused of murdering their
parents last year. They have denied the charges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The court issued a stay pending its review of the
brothers' petition to overturn a recent lower court ruling
that ordered release of the tapes. The high court will act on
the petition before Oct. 26, a court clerk said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Judge James Albracht accepted
prosecutors' arguments that the brothers allegedly threatened
psychologist Leon Jerome Oziel, thereby invalidating the
confidentiality of doctor-patient communications. The judge
indicated that none of the recorded sessions were privileged
because the psychologist had reason to believe that the
brothers were a threat to him that should be disclosed to
avoid danger.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the ABC television show "Prime Time Live"
featured an interview with a woman identified as a former
girlfriend of Mr. Oziel's, who claimed the brothers confessed
to the murders in sessions with the psychologist last fall.
The woman said she overheard the sessions because the
psychologist had asked her to listen to them from outside his
office, allegedly because he was concerned for his safety.
The woman later told police about the sessions and the
existence of the tapes, according to the program.</p>
<p>Jose Menendez and his wife were shot Aug. 20, 1989, in
their Beverly Hills, Calif. home. Their sons alerted police,
saying they had discovered the bodies on their return from
the movies. However, the sons were later charged with the
murders, and the tapes played a prominent role after Los
Angeles County district attorney Ira Reiner said they
contained "very important" evidence supporting allegations
that the brothers killed their parents to gain access to a
$14 million estate.</p>
