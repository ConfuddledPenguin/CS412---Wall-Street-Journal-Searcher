	<p class="article-leader">Outboard Marine Corp., citing an "industrywide slump in
marine products sales," plans to take a $33 million
restructuring charge in the fourth quarter ending Sept. 30.
   That will bring the total of such charges in this fiscal
year to about $47.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The actions involve closure of facilities, including three
retail outlets. Outboard said it is also in the process of
closing three U.S. boat manufacturing plants and an office
facility, as well as an Australian outboard motor assembly
plant.</p>
<p>The boat-manufacturing plants scheduled for closure will
have their production consolidated into other plants, the
company said, and Australian dealers will be provided with
outboard motors made in the U.S. and other countries.</p>
<p>The Waukegan, Ill.-based company's nautical-fashion
apparel, formerly sold through its retail outlets, will now
be sold through boat dealerships and a catalog sales
operation.</p>
<p>Included in the charges for the current quarter are $16
million in one-time charges and write-offs. Additional
charges are under consideration, the company said.</p>
