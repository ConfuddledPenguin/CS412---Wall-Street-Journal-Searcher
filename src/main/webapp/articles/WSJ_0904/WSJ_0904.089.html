	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- For the second time in a year, Britain's Thorn
EMI PLC was jilted at the altar as talks to sell its big
European lighting business to U.S.-based GTE Corp. ended in
failure.
   A Thorn spokeswoman said GTE ended the three-month-old
negotiations after being unable to reach agreement on sales
terms. The Thorn division, valued by analysts at about #350
million ($671.3 million), is a struggling player in a tough
market that Thorn was eager to exit. GTE had coveted the
Thorn business, the world's fifth largest light-bulb maker,
to expand its own, far-bigger world lighting business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the match didn't work out. Thorn declined to specify
why the talks failed, but the spokeswoman cited several
factors that may have cooled GTE's ardor. They included
economic fears arising in the Middle East; GTE's efforts to
digest its planned $6.2 billion purchase of U.S.-based Contel
Corp.; and a continuing decline in the Thorn lighting
business. The Thorn division's operating profit dropped 19%
to #32.9 million in the year ended March 31, on revenue of
#573.4 million. Since March, market conditions have worsened.</p>
<p>A GTE spokesman confirmed that the talks failed because of
inability to agree on terms, but denied that GTE's decision
was influenced by its Contel purchase. He added that the
company is "committed to the global lighting business" and
remains interested in other acquisitions or alliances. GTE's
electrical products division, of which lighting is a part,
posted operating income of $222 million on revenue of $2.2
billion in 1989.</p>
