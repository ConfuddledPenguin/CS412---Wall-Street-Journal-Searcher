	<p class="article-leader">PEORIA, Ill. -- Connie Cook tickles her electric piano
keys and strives to sing above the happy-hour chaos in
O'Leary's, a singles bar. She fails. Her recital, preceded by
a lingerie show and an Elvis Presley impersonator, is tuned
out by most of the 100 or so patrons while a televised
Chicago Cubs game drones on.
   This crowd couldn't hear a message sent by aliens from
outer space -- and that, Ms. Cook asserts, is precisely what
her music is. In 1981, she says, she saw an undentified
flying object whose passengers later entered her
consciousness and inspired the music.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What kind of music do aliens like? No punk or heavy metal,
thanks, but instead a dreamy sort of jazz and soft-rock
fusion with lyrics -- translated from the lingo of the
Pleiades star cluster where the aliens claim to hail from --
like this:</p>
<p>"By and by we learn to fly</p>
<p>Within each other's heart.</p>
<p>Space and time the ancient rhyme</p>
<p>Is overcome in our heart."</p>
<p>Solid platinum it isn't. The record industry is beating no
path to Ms. Cook's door. But some critics, musicologists and
record-industry people who have listened to her tapes find
her music intriguing. "I don't know who her collaborators
are, but there's something other-worldly about her songs,"
says David Wild, a senior writer at Rolling Stone magazine.</p>
<p>"She's using some notes that seem to come from somewhere
else; a few don't even translate to music paper," says Jim
Van Petten, a Chicago record producer and musicologist.
"Technically, they don't exist," he says -- on this planet,
at least. Ms. Cook has had her pianos tuned to produce notes
that sound vaguely Far Eastern, or even from beyond.</p>
<p>Ms. Cook says her first close encounter came late one
night in November 1981, when a gleaming, globe-shaped craft
hovered silently outside her bedroom window for about 90
minutes. Mesmerized, she returned to bed when it left. Soon
after, she dreamed of seeing four shiny people with
indistinct features "sort of standing in the sky." She later
dreamed the four beings were at her bedside, stroking her
hands and predicting a time of "good will for the earth's
peoples." They explained they were appearing in human form so
as not to frighten her.</p>
<p>A month later, inspired telepathically, sometimes in
dreams, she began compulsively composing music, she says.
Previously without a piano, she now has two. "Before that I
couldn't play `Chopsticks,' and I still can't. But sometimes
music just flows out of me, and I write it down."</p>
<p>Are there musical Martians? Virtuosos on Venus? Orchestras
beyond Orion? Will little green men someday demand to be
taken to our band leader?</p>
<p>Military and aerospace officials doubt it, but concede
they're not really trying to detect music from the spheres.
"We don't even take reports anymore, even if you said a
flying saucer just landed in your yard," says Capt. Sigmund
Adams of the Air Force Readiness Support Branch. After
chasing down 12,618 reports of UFOs between 1948 and 1969,
the Readiness Support Branch has packed it in -- even though
701 sightings remain unexplained by ordinary phenomena.</p>
<p>"Budget restraints keep us from listening" for signals
from space, says Michael Klein, project manager of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence. "NASA is not at this time
carrying out a search, even though people think we are."</p>
<p>NASA's two unmanned Voyager missions, launched in 1977,
carry music recordings to the outer edges of the galaxy, four
billion miles away, in case anybody out there wants to
listen. Songs on the gold-plated albums aboard include Chuck
Berry's "Johnny B. Goode," the "Pigmy Girl's Initiation Song"
from Zaire and a Mexican mariachi melody.</p>
<p>Any beings who track that music to Earth should steer
clear of Peoria's environs, however, says Ms. Cook's mother,
Genevieve Cook, a retired office worker. She says aliens just
wouldn't play in Peoria. "The yahoos around here would blast
away with their shotguns at anything that moved if they
thought aliens were out there," she says.</p>
<p>Except for her space music thing, Connie Cook is Ms.
Middle America: a 42-year-old divorced housewife raising a
sixth-grader. Pretty and plump, she favors print dresses and
strawberry cheesecake. Her father was a postman. She twirled
the baton in high school, where she banged a snare drum in
the band. After eight piano lessons from a teacher who rapped
her knuckles for frequent mistakes, she quit music until her
strange inspiration nine years ago.</p>
<p>"I believe too much in science and religion to swallow
UFOs, so I would think Connie's pulling something if I didn't
see her play," says her sister, Carolyn Cook. "Those just
aren't her fingers on the keys."</p>
<p>But astronomers such as Carl Sagan don't want to hear it.
"Grandma Moses took up painting at about 70, and she didn't
see aliens," he says.</p>
<p>Ms. Cook sings some of her alien songs to children in
Sunday school at Unity Church of Peoria. Says the Rev. Eddie
Edwards, "Connie is a sincere and stable person who has had
some kind of an experience. I don't know what."</p>
<p>Jon Engberg, associate director of academic affairs at the
University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music, has
listened to a Cook tape supplied by a reporter. "I think she
has had some serious musical training," he says. Another tape
listener, Wahaba Heartsun, publisher of Heartsong Review, a
new-age music magazine, says Ms. Cook's music "is moving and
inspired, with a very sweet quality of innocence."</p>
<p>So why aren't record companies swooping to sign her up?
One reason is given by a spokesman for Narada Productions
Inc., a Milwaukee record company. He says too much popular
music is already accused of being inspired by devil worship
or other cults. "Any notion that the company is selling music
inspired by UFOs would be too controversial."</p>
<p>Ms. Cook says she wants to share the aliens' music, not
profit from it. That may be a good thing, too, because she
might find it hard to comply with U.S. copyright law, which
requires that income from music be split between composers
and inspirational collaborators. But if Ms. Cook ever has a
hit, says Todd Brabec, spokesman for the American Society of
Composers, Authors & Publishers, "We would help the aliens
get paid, like anyone else. If we have their address." The
only one Ms. Cook has is the Pleiades star cluster -- with no
ZIP code yet.</p>
<p>If history is any guide, Ms. Cook has some chance of
landing in the top 40. After all, Sheb Wooley made it to No.
1 with "The Purple People Eater" in 1958, the Ran-Dells to
No. 16 with "Martian Hop" in 1963, and the Five Blobs to No.
33 with "The Blob" in 1958. None of these performers had the
benefit of inspiration from outer space. As far as is known.</p>
