	<p class="article-leader">CALGARY, Alberta -- Alberta Natural Gas Co. said it plans
to secure control of its troubled magnesium production joint
venture with Houston-based Magnesium International Corp.
   Norman Wagner, Alberta Natural's chairman and newly
appointed chief executive officer, said the company expects
to invest a further 50 million Canadian dollars (US$43.6
million) or so to win an unspecified majority interest in
Magnesium Co. of Canada, the joint venture that operates the
plant at High River, Alberta.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Wagner wouldn't say by how much Alberta Natural plans
to raise its stake. But he said its effort to secure control
of the venture, which has been hurt by construction and
engineering snags since modest output began in February,
shows "our confidence and our faith" in it. He predicted the
plant could be profitable within a year.</p>
<p>The 12,500-metric-ton-a-year magnesium plant, originally
conceived as phase one of a three-phase, C$370 million
facility ultimately capable of producing 62,500 tons of
magnesium annually, is currently producing "exceptionally
high-quality product in an appropriate volume, but we are
working our way through some start-up problems," Mr. Wagner
said.</p>
<p>Magnesium, a silver-white metallic element, is mainly used
as an alloy for producing aluminum.</p>
<p>He didn't specify how much of the plant's capacity is
currently being used. It was previously expected to reach
commercial production levels by the current quarter. "We'll
let reality determine whether we have the capability here of
developing full-scale production," he said.</p>
<p>Rumors have circulated that the resignation last month of
Alberta Natural's former president and chief executive,
Douglas Fenton, was tied to start-up problems at the
magnesium plant. Mr. Wagner wouldn't comment. Mr. Fenton
couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>The plant was built as part of an ongoing diversification
strategy by Alberta Natural, whose current core businesses
include natural gas pipelines, gas processing and specialty
chemicals. The company is 49.2%-owned by Pacific Gas &
Electric Co.'s gas pipeline unit, Pacific Gas Transmission
Co.</p>
<p>Despite problems with its magnesium arm, Mr. Wagner said
Alberta Natural still has "a very good chance" of matching
last year's earnings, before special charges, of C$26.9
million, or C$1.26 a share. He didn't offer a specific
forecast. Final net last year was C$23.6 million, or C$1.11 a
share, on revenue of C$366.8 million.</p>
