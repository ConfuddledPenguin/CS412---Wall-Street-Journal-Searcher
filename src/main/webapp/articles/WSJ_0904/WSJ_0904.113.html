	<p class="article-leader">AB Skandia said first-half pretax profit plummeted 87% as
financial costs ballooned in the wake of a recent acquisition
spree and as a string of natural disasters in Sweden and
abroad caused heavy losses in underwriting operations.
   Scandinavia's biggest insurer didn't issue a full-year
profit forecast. But the Stockholm company's chief executive,
Bjoern Wolrath, was skeptical about chances of a rapid
turnaround. "It's going to take a while before big
investments we've been making in international expansion
begin to produce the profits we expect," he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Skandia said pretax profit in the first half plunged to
344 million Swedish kronor ($59.7 million) from 2.56 billion
kronor a year earlier. Operating profit tumbled 99% to 12
million kronor from 1.02 billion kronor the previous year.</p>
<p>The year-to-year comparisons were distorted somewhat by
the fact that 1989 was generally considered one of the best
ever for Swedish insurers.</p>
<p>Skandia said premium revenue in the first half surged 34%
to 12.36 billion kronor from 9.25 billion kronor in the 1989
half. But insurance operations posted a loss of 88 million
kronor, down from a profit of 221 million kronor a year
earlier.</p>
