	<p class="article-leader">BASKING RIDGE, N.J. -- Crum & Forster Inc. said it intends
to get out of the automobile insurance business, selling one
unit to General Motors Corp. and putting another on the
block.
   The troubled unit of Xerox Corp. said it wants to raise
money so it can focus on its commercial insurance business.
Xerox's new chief executive, Paul Allaire, has decreed that
any such moves must be funded without help from the parent
company's more-healthy units.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Crum & Forster said it signed a memorandum of
understanding regarding the sale of its Navco Corp.
subsidiary to Motors Insurance Corp., a unit of General
Motors Acceptance Corp., GM's finance arm. Terms weren't
disclosed, and the transaction is subject to definitive
agreement and various approvals.</p>
<p>Navco offers auto policies tailored for specific groups
and associations. MIC writes auto insurance for GM employees
only, though it offers a range of other auto- and
mortgage-related lines.</p>
<p>Crum & Forster said it also intends to sell its other auto
insurance unit, Viking Insurance Co. of Wisconsin. Viking and
Navco each had annual premiums of $147 million in 1989, the
company said. Together, the units make up about 9% of Crum &
Forster's business.</p>
<p>In April, Crum & Forster stopped writing all insurance
lines, including auto policies, because the business was
having losses and wouldn't be profitable anytime soon. A GMAC
spokesman said he didn't know if Navco is profitable
individually; a Crum & Forster spokeswoman didn't return
calls.</p>

<p>CRUM & FORSTER Inc. stopped writing in April all personal
insurance lines, including auto policies. In yesterday's
edition, it was incorrectly stated that the company stopped
writing all insurance lines.</p>
