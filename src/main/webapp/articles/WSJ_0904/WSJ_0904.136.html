	<p class="article-leader">BAGHDAD TOLD nations with citizens trapped in Iraq to send
them food.
   Although Baghdad permitted the weekend departure of
several hundred foreigners, including Americans, it then
balked at allowing more airlifts, and solicited food
shipments for the hostages. The Iraqi government also
suspended payment of its foreign debt, conservatively
estimated at between $30 billion and $35 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. is expected to announce a plan to forgive much of
the $7 billion in military debt owed by Egypt, a stalwart
American ally. And in another move to shore up support for
anti-Iraq action, Bush will confer Sunday with Gorbachev.
Meetings between the U.N.'s chief and Iraq's foreign minister

in little more than a year.</p>

<p>Soviets lined up for bread at stores across Moscow for the
first time in years, with many blaming President Gorbachev's
policies for shortages of a growing list of products that
includes tobacco, paper, cheese and gasoline. The last time
Soviets could remember long bread lines was under Premier
Khrushchev, ousted in 1964.</p>
<p>A radical economic plan was presented to Soviet leaders
Friday, as Gorbachev and Russian republic leader Yeltsin
seemed ready to scuttle most of a prior plan that was
prepared by Premier Ryzhkov. The new package calls for
earlier deregulation of most prices, along with large-scale
privatization.</p>

<p>The Phnom Penh government said the Khmer Rouge guerrillas
want to sabotage a Cambodian peace settlement and are

U.N. the power to oversee a cease-fire.</p>

<p>East and West Germany signed a landmark unity treaty
Friday covering the merger of their legal and political

laws, is expected to be approved by both parliaments
following debate over the next few weeks.</p>

<p>NASA began its third countdown for space shuttle Columbia,

problems with the shuttle's $150 million observatory prompted

<p>The South African government freed 11 African National
Congress prisoners, the first of many due for release as a
precondition for talks between Pretoria and the
anti-apartheid group. As many as 3,500 political prisoners
are to be released by the government over the next five
months.</p>

<p>A study found that exposure to polluted air can provoke
life-threatening irregular heartbeats in people suffering
from coronary artery disease. The report is further evidence
that carbon monoxide -- an urban pollutant emitted in auto
exhaust and by industrial smokestacks -- is harmful to the
heart.</p>

<p>Rebel leader Charles Taylor declared war on a West African
peacekeeping force in Liberia, calling it a band of foreign

The troops have been welcomed by rival guerrilla leader
Prince Johnson and by President Doe.</p>

<p>Somalia's president dismissed the East African nation's
prime minister and his seven-month-old government as
diplomats reported that fighting between security forces and
rebels was intensifying in central regions of the country.
Siad Barre, who faces severe economic and social problems,
gave no reason for his action.</p>

<p>About 135,000 public employees began a planned weeklong

the reservation, and at a second Indian settlement, in a
dispute over a land claim involving a golf course.</p>

<p>Ethnic Albanians staged a one-day strike to protest
Serbian rule in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province. Tensions have
