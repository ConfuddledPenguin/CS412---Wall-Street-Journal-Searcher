	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Jeffrey Ellerbe ordered a Coke at a Roy
Rogers restaurant on the city's northeast side. It was 6:30
p.m. on July 17, 1988. When he paid the clerk with a dollar
bill, he also gave her a note: "Give me all the money."
   He took about $500, got in his 1986 blue Ford Tempo and
drove to a police station. "I went and I told them I just
robbed Roy Rogers," Mr. Ellerbe says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the police there hadn't yet received word of the
crime. "They looked at me like I was crazy and told me to get
out. So I went and got high with the money."</p>
<p>Two hours after failing to get busted, Mr. Ellerbe waited
his turn at a crowded McDonald's restaurant in nearby Seat
Pleasant, Md., then handed the cashier the same robbery note
he had used before. He left the restaurant with a black
cash-register box containing about $140 and tried to turn
himself in at another police station.</p>
<p>"They didn't believe me, either," he says. So he got high
again. "I wanted to get high," he says, "but I wanted to get
caught, too."</p>
<p>He wanted to get caught because he was addicted to crack
cocaine. He says he had called more than a dozen drug
treatment programs, but all had long waiting lists. He says
his crime spree was designed more to get help for his
addiction than to finance it.</p>
<p>"I wanted to go to jail, to get off the streets, to get
into a drug program," says Mr. Ellerbe, who is 30 years old.
Police, who confirm the robberies, have no comment on the
specifics of his confession attempts, but they do say
officers would be unable to arrest someone before they had
received a report of a crime.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellerbe's story demonstrates not only how far some
addicts will go to seek help when they finally get the
courage to fight their addiction; it also shows one of the
major frustrations of the war on drugs: At public drug
treatment programs, there often is no room to get in.</p>
<p>A May survey by the Therapeutic Communities of America --
the trade association for non-profit, long-term drug
treatment facilities, which can accept public funding and
indigent patients -- showed waiting lists that average four
months. (By contrast, many private facilities now have empty
beds because of corporate cutbacks in insurance coverage for
residential drug treatment.)</p>
<p>"Society says, `Clean up your act, get a job, get
treatment,'" says Douglas Chiapetta, the trade group's
national office director. "When they try to change, they're
told there's a three- or four-month waiting list."</p>
<p>A survey by the National Association of State Alcohol and
Drug Abuse Directors indicated a year ago that there were
nearly 67,000 people on drug treatment waiting lists for
programs of various kinds. According to the House Select
Committee on Narcotics and Control, only one-fifth of the
people who need treatment get it.</p>
<p>The others may have missed what drug treatment
professionals call the "treatable moment." An addict who
doesn't get treatment when ready and willing to accept it may
not try again.</p>
<p>In the past two years Congress has approved $140 million
specifically to try to reduce waiting lists. Non-profit drug
treatment facilities apply to the government for the funds,
which can be used for expanding treatment capacity through
hiring staff, remodeling or leasing facilities, but not for
construction. About 350 programs share the money.
Profit-making facilities serving those with money or
insurance aren't eligible.</p>
<p>But those funds have an odd effect: "As word gets out that
there's available treatment, the waiting list grows" because
some who had been discouraged from applying then do so, says
Heddy Hibbard, a Department of Health and Human Services
official.</p>
<p>There are some demands in Congress to provide the
resources that would allow people like Mr. Ellerbe to get
drug treatment on demand. Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel of
New York has introduced a bill to have Medicaid pay for drug
treatment. "It is unconscionable that we now turn away
thousands of people who finally aid themselves enough to ask
for assistance," he says. The bill has passed the Senate,
where New York Democrat Patrick Moynihan sponsored it, and
remains in committee in the House. In any case, the Medicaid
program covers only some of the poor.</p>
<p>Democratic Sens. Joseph Biden of Delaware and Edward
Kennedy of Massachusetts have introduced legislation that
would provide $3 billion for a variety of treatment programs.</p>
<p>Messrs. Rangel, Moynihan and some others in Congress are
critical of the Bush administration's emphasis on law
enforcement over treatment in its anti-drug efforts. But Bush
administration drug czar William Bennett says the distinction
between law enforcement and treatment may be a phony one
because many people enter treatment through the courts. His
Office of National Drug Control Policy says an on-demand
policy "would create a costly, unbalanced system that brings
no guarantee of higher treatment success rates."</p>
<p>In the end, Mr. Ellerbe, whose story has been confirmed
through a variety of sources and records, felt the
criminal-justice system was his only hope of getting help.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellerbe grew up in Washington, D.C., and says he first
got high on marijuana when he was 14 or 15. He was skipping
school then, he says, because his family was poor and he was
ashamed of his clothes. The youngest of six boys and two
girls, he had little contact with his father after his
parents divorced when he was six or seven, he says.</p>
<p>He started smoking PCP after he was discharged from the
Army in 1983. After he began working as a maintenance man at
a university, his employer's insurance company helped him get
into a 30-day drug treatment program in the summer of 1987.</p>
<p>When he completed the program, he was given a clear
marble, a symbol that he should stay "clear away" from dope.
"I thought I was well, but I wasn't," he says. Within three
days, he relapsed.</p>
<p>The marble became a joke. He put it in the bowl of his
dope pipe.</p>
<p>That November, he had his first hit of crack. "I'll never
forget that day," he says. His left hand was swollen and
painful, he says, because two months earlier it had been
crushed in a trash compactor at the university. Mr. Ellerbe
recalls a friend coming to visit who told him: "Smoke some of
this. It'll take all the pain away." It did.</p>
<p>He continued to smoke crack because he thought it eased
the pain. "I didn't really think I was hooked until my hand
went down," he says. "My hand got well and I kept on buying
it."</p>
<p>Mr. Ellerbe started stealing from his mother to finance
his habit. One day he took her bank card, he says, and
withdrew about $100 from the $3,000 she had deposited. He did
this every day until she had only $120 left. "I used to be
crying at night. I wanted to stop, but I couldn't stop. I'd
be praying and everything, asking God to help me. This stuff
is something else."</p>
<p>During this period Mr. Ellerbe attended Narcotics
Anonymous meetings, where he got a list of 15 centers
offering various types of treatments. "I called every last
one of them on that list," he says. All he got were reasons
they couldn't help him. "We got 500 people in front of you,"
he says he was told. "We got 300 people in front of you.
There's no bed space. We're only taking females this month."</p>
<p>Mr. Ellerbe created a test to focus his will power for
quitting drugs. He was expecting a $401.62 workers'
compensation check for his job-related injury, and he was
determined to hold himself back from spending the money on
dope.</p>
<p>One day, the check arrived in the mail at 11:30. Mr.
Ellerbe immediately failed the test. "It seems like as soon
as I got that check, everything I had thought about was
gone," he says.</p>
<p>He cashed the check at a liquor store and spent the day
smoking crack. But the higher he got, the more depressed he
became about breaking his promise not to get high anymore. "I
didn't like that life," he says. "I was hurting my mama."</p>
<p>Frustrated that he couldn't shake his habit and angry that
he had smoked up all his money, Mr. Ellerbe went home and sat
on his porch, crying, thinking of his sister, who had
committed suicide by jumping off a bridge four years earlier.
"I felt like I was useless," he says, "like I didn't have
anything to live for."</p>
<p>He says he contemplated suicide, but he couldn't think of
a way to do it. "What I came up with was getting locked up,"
he says, "to get off the streets and maybe I could get some
help in jail."</p>
<p>In the summer of 1988, he says, he threw a chair through
the window of a police station, and police officers took him
to a psychiatric hospital. He stayed there for a week and got
counseling, he recalls. But he was told the hospital's drug
program was full. He left with a bus token and his addiction
intact.</p>
<p>Within months of being discharged from the hospital, Mr.
Ellerbe and his mother recall, he sold television sets, a
video cassette recorder and a microwave oven that belonged to
his family and used the money to buy crack. "I just gave up
on myself," he says. "If I can't get in a drug program, I may
as well get high."</p>
<p>But he decided to try again and began his one-day robbery
spree. After failing in his first efforts, Mr. Ellerbe
finally did get arrested after one more robbery that same
day. According to a Maryland District Court document, he
pulled his car alongside a pedestrian in suburban
Bladensburg, Md., and robbed her of $245 in personal
property, including a blue linen jacket and high heels. He
pleaded guilty to that robbery and to the two restaurant
hold-ups.</p>
<p>As part of his sentence, he is enrolled in Rap Inc., a
Washington-based long-term treatment program with a residence
in the countryside of suburban Laurel, Md. Even after getting
arrested in July, he had to wait. He finally entered in
November 1988. If he successfully completes his treatment
program, Mr. Ellerbe may apply for a governor's pardon to
wipe his criminal record clean because he was convicted of
only "one day of crime in his entire life," said his lawyer,
Leonard Kuentz.</p>
<p>He has undergone nearly two years of one-on-one
counseling, group sessions and peer pressure that promote
cooperation rather than confrontation. As a result, Mr.
Ellerbe has come a long way from the hot-tempered, "pretty
confused dude" he was when he entered the program, says Rap's
executive director, Ron Clark.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellerbe's treatment is funded by local and federal
governments at about $40 a day. Two years is longer treatment
than usual. "There were some setbacks for him," says Mr.
Clark. "That happens from time to time."</p>
<p>Mr. Ellerbe is a member of Rap's acquisition team, which
requires him to promote the program -- and himself -- to
businesses that may donate goods to the facility. The pride
and confidence that drugs destroyed have returned, he says.
While demonstrating his new, half-frame reading glasses, he
likes to discuss Nelson Mandela and U.S.-South African
politics. He has had job interviews in preparation for his
drug-free life.</p>
<p>When Mr. Ellerbe graduates from Rap this November, his
spot will be filled immediately. Rap is treating 87 people
and has 380 on its waiting list.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellerbe knows his adjustment to a drug-free life will
be difficult when he is on his own. "I notice now that when I
go home I don't have any friends at all," he says, because
his buddies still use drugs.</p>
<p>The man who first turned Mr. Ellerbe on to crack still
gets high, according to Mr. Ellerbe. But that man also
provides a kind of incentive: He looks so bad -- skinny, with
no color -- that he helps Mr. Ellerbe stay clean by allowing
him to "remember all the things you've been through."</p>
