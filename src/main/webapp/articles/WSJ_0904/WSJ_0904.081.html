	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Prices for the market's newly arrived stocks
last week plunged to what some say is the weakest level in 2
1/2 years. Now some investors say there are a few fallen
angels worth noticing.
   A seller's bazaar just two months ago, the
over-the-counter market for initial public stock offerings
crumbled as investors shaken by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
and an uncertain economy fled to more seasoned investments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"That's why {new} OTC stocks do poorly in bad markets.
They require seasoning," says Bruce Bredehoft, director of
research at Sit Investments, Minneapolis. Investors who
couldn't get enough of new offerings in mid-July now deliver
quick and brutal blows to recently debuted companies that
hint of disappointments -- particularly those with short
track records.</p>
<p>The collapse in the IPO market sheared heady premiums from
many offerings that were stiffly priced by eager investment
bankers and their clients. "The new issues market was so
strong that the recent correction essentially eliminated the
premiums," says Norman Fosback, editor of New Issues
newsletter, Fort Lauderdale, Fla. Some stocks such as
In-Store Advertising, they add, collapsed for good reasons.</p>
<p>In-Store Advertising last week lowered its earnings
outlook less than two months after a July 19 initial offering
at $19 a share. By the end of the week the stock had lost
more than half its market value in a dive to $5.75. That
casualty helped fuel a 9.1% drop in the IPO 100 Index to its
lowest level in 30 months, according to the IPO Reporter, a
New York newsletter published by Investment Dealers Digest.
The index measures the average price change in shares of the
most recent 100 IPOs.</p>
<p>Others, such as energy shares buoyed by higher oil prices,
are still trading above their offering prices and offer very
few bargains. But among the fallen issues there are some
values, although not a basement full, say Mr. Fosback and
several money managers. Among the shares some managers are
buying are:</p>
<p>Arctco: Offered at $11 apiece on June 26, shares of the
Thief River Falls, Minn., snowmobile maker reached a high of
12 1/2 before skidding. They closed Friday at 8. "If gasoline
goes up 10 cents a gallon, you won't stop using your
snowmobile," says Ralph Wanger, president of the $800 million
Acorn Fund of Chicago. "It's perfectly reasonable at these
prices." The company averaged 59% a year growth in net income
over the past five years, with 1990 earnings of $1.13 a
share. Suzuki Motor retains a 27% beneficial ownership; the
state of Wisconsin Investment Board has an 8.4% stake.</p>
<p>Bird Medical Technologies: Companies such as Bird Medical
that weathered the 1981 recession are attractive to Richard
Carney, president of Cramblit & Carney, a Los Angeles manager
of $900 million of institutional assets. The Palm Springs,
Calif., maker of respiratory equipment went public Aug. 2 at
8 and closed Friday at 6. Mr. Carney says he likes the
company's 31% average annual growth rate and its balance
sheet. But not everyone is a fan: Mr. Fosback says that at
about 25 times earnings, he's advising his clients the stock
is still too dear.</p>
<p>Dynasty Classics: Offered in May at $11.25 apiece, shares
of the retailer of lighting fixtures and Christmas
decorations soared to 18 3/4 before the market peaked and a
cautious article in Barron's put a damper on the stock. With
1989 pro forma earnings of 34 cents a share, Mr. Fosback says
he, too, found the stock's offering price too rich. But he
recommended purchase at 10 1/2 or lower. Friday, the stock
closed at 9.</p>
<p>Horsehead Resources: Mr. Carney also likes the record
established by zinc and waste recycler Horsehead Resources.
Owners Horsehead Industries and B.U.S. Berzelius Umwalt of
Germany sold a 9% stake to the public June 29 at $14.50 a
share. The stock soared to 22 1/4 before falling with the
market and amid some analysts' concerns about regulatory
risks. At Friday's close of 13 3/4, Mr. Carney says he is
adding to his position.</p>
<p>VeriFone: Offered in March at $16 apiece, shares of this
Redwood City, Calif., provider of credit-card handling
technology for retailers and other companies have traded as
high as 26. Friday the stock closed at 15 3/4, a level
attractive to Mr. Bredehoft of Sit Investments. The 46%
closely held company has few major competitors, he notes.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Bredehoft says for the most part he is
advising clients to steer clear of this year's rocky market.
A 30-year follower of IPOs, he says it usually takes three to
six months for the IPO market to stabilize after a collapse.</p>
<p>Others, however, are choosing cheap stocks -- but not
telling. Pressed for some tips, mutual fund managers at T.
Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore are playing coy. "There
were some diamonds in the rough that were rich and very
attractive," says a spokeswoman for the fund.</p>
<p>With last month's collapse, she adds, "we are actively
buying now in some issues." But T. Rowe Price's fund managers
aren't tipping their hands. "It complicates our buying," she
explains. In other words, more buyers drive prices out of the
bargain basement.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Over-the-counter stocks gained in light volume in advance
of the Labor Day weekend.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index added 2.53 to 381.21, a 0.7%
rise, as volume dropped to 79.9 million shares from 106.3
million Friday. Advancing shares outpaced decliners, 984 to
789. However, only 13 issues reached new highs, while 86 fell
to new lows.</p>
<p>Envirosafe fell another 3 3/8 after Thursday's 4 7/8-point
tumble. At its current price of 7, the stock is trading at
about half of its 52-week high set less than two months ago.
Thursday, an Ohio agency denied an application by one of the
company's subsidiaries to construct an additional
waste-disposal site in the state.</p>
<p>Intel was the most active stock Friday, adding only 1/4 to
33 3/8 after losing 1 7/8 Thursday. Investors continued to
worry about a patent recently granted to a California man
covering many of the electronics industry's most lucrative
chips.</p>
<p>Among other large OTC stocks, MCI Communications rose 1
3/8 to 34; Apple Computer added 3/4 to 37; and Oracle Systems
gained 7/8 to 11 5/8. Conner Peripherals eased 3/8 to 20 5/8.</p>
