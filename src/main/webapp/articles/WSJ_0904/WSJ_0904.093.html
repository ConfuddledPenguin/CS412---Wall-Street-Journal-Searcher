	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canada's gross domestic product in the second
quarter declined an inflation-adjusted 0.4% from the first
quarter, raising fears that the country has entered a
recession.
   The GDP decline, which was reported by the government
Friday, followed 7 1/2 years of economic growth.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Finance Minister Michael Wilson told reporters the economy
was "catching its breath," after a longer-than-usual period
of strong growth.</p>
<p>The minister said that he wasn't ruling out a recession,
but that it is too early to predict one. A recession is
usually defined as involving at least two consecutive
quarters of GDP decline. GDP is the total value of a
country's output of goods and services. In the first quarter,
Canada's GDP rose 0.5%.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada, the government agency that compiles the
GDP data, said all major components of domestic demand
declined in the second quarter. Corporate profits and
personal disposable income also fell.</p>
<p>Business spending on plant and equipment declined an
inflation-adjusted 2.9% from the first quarter. Consumer
spending on goods and services shrank 0.4%, the first such
decline since 1982.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada attributed the decline in consumer
spending to high interest rates, a drop in disposable income,
and recession fears. It said high interest rates also damped
business spending.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar declined Friday in Toronto to 86.43
U.S. cents from 87.18 cents Thursday, on speculation that the
second-quarter GDP decline would prompt the Bank of Canada to
relax its monetary restraints to prevent a recession.</p>
<p>The central bank's monetary curbs have kept short-term
interest rates more than five percentage points above U.S.
rates in recent months, attracting a heavy flow of foreign
funds into Canada.</p>
<p>Ted Carmichael, an economist at Burns Fry Ltd., a
Toronto-based securities company, said the Bank of Canada now
"has evidence that the economy is falling into a recession."
But he predicted the central bank will be cautious in
lowering interest rates, to avoid a flight of foreign capital
from Canada.</p>
<p>Gerard MacDonell, a Royal Bank of Canada economist, said
he expects the central bank to respond cautiously to the
latest GDP data, because of concern about persisting
inflationary pressures in Canada. He said labor income has
continued to grow strongly, despite the economic downturn. He
said the central bank also is concerned about the
inflationary effect of a 7% consumption tax that the
government proposes to introduce Jan. 1.</p>
<p>A Bank of Nova Scotia economist, Aron Gampel, said:
"Policymakers face a challenging outlook. Activity is
slumping, while inflation pressures are being aggravated by
higher taxes and escalating labor costs."</p>
<p>Statistics Canada reported separately Friday that Canada's
deficit on the current account of its international balance
of payments narrowed to 4.49 billion Canadian dollars
(US$3.88 billion) in the second quarter from a C$5.02 billion
gap in the January-March period. The seasonally adjusted
current account is an accounting of trade in goods and
services. It also includes payments and receipts of interest
and dividends.</p>
