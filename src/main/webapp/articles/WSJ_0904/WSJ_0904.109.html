	<p class="article-leader">EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Rockwell International Corp. said it
completed the realignment of its defense-electronics group by
combining several businesses and naming new executives to
head two reorganized divisions.
   The realignment, which began in March, is designed to
allow Rockwell to bid more effectively on Pentagon contracts
and overseas work, the company has said. The latest moves
affect about half of the defense-electronic's group's 16,000
employees. Some of them may move, but there aren't any job
reductions planned at this time, a Rockwell spokesman said.</p>
