	<p class="article-leader">Reporting on the July retirement of Associate Justice
William J. Brennan Jr., several news organizations used a
pungent one-liner attributed to President Eisenhower to the
effect that he had made two mistakes as president, and both
sat on the Supreme Court, in reference to Earl Warren and Mr.
Brennan. Eisenhower probably never made the statement.
   The source of this error may likely be traced to Elmo
Richardson's 1979 book "The Presidency of Dwight D.
Eisenhower." The author discusses a conversation Eisenhower
had with Republican leader Ralph Cake about the appointment
of Warren. Mr. Richardson's parenthetical phrase -- "It's one
of the two biggest mistakes I made in my administration" --
is not a quotation, nor does he suggest that Eisenhower ever
said it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Then in 1985 Henry J. Abraham, a professor at the
University of Virginia, wrote in the introduction to
"Justices and Presidents": "After having made what he would
later categorize as `my two biggest mistakes -- and they are
both on the Supreme Court,' President Eisenhower insisted on
being fully "au courant" of the characteristics and
qualifications-in-his-image of the other three appointments
fate permitted him." He footnoted Mr. Richardson quoting Mr.
Cake, thus appropriating a "joke" about presidents rather
than a statement by Eisenhower. Next, Elder Witt of
Congressional Quarterly placed the quotation in the standard
reference work, Guide to the U.S. Supreme Court, footnoting
Mr. Abraham.</p>
<p>Most readers rely on the accuracy of a historian's
footnotes, and the old joke gained new life as an actual
Eisenhower statement -- and American folklore. But perhaps
Eisenhower did include the appointment of Mr. Brennan when he
told Mr. Cake he had made "two" big mistakes. But it doesn't
look that way.</p>
<p>Fred Greenstein of Princeton University, an expert on
Eisenhower and the modern presidency, has never found the
comment in any of Eisenhower's written works. Moreover, in
1961, Eisenhower told William Ewald, a research assistant for
his memoirs, "Eisenhower the President," that "the two worst
appointments I ever made came out of recommendations from the
Justice Department -- that fellow who headed the Antitrust
Division, Bicks, and Earl Warren."</p>
<p>Furthermore, when Mr. Cake asked what the other big
mistake was, Eisenhower responded sharply, "None of your
business]" Finally, Herb Pankratz of the Eisenhower Library's
Oral History project has not discovered the quotation in any
interview.</p>
<p>Surely Justice Brennan did not turn out to be the sort of
justice Eisenhower had hoped to appoint. Indeed, Warren
himself reports in his memoirs that Eisenhower told him that
he was "disappointed in Justice Brennan and me." In
Eisenhower's own memoirs, the former president takes pains to
emphasize that he knew very little about William Brennan
before appointing him, and relied on his advisers for the
selection. Yet to say that Eisenhower's self-professed
"worst" mistake was choosing Mr. Brennan is not supported by
the record.</p>
