	<p class="article-leader">SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- A chip maker, threatening one of
Silicon Valley's most lucrative monopolies, is preparing to
clone Intel Corp.'s cash cow, the 80386.
   Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is expected this fall to
unveil the clone of the 80386 microprocessor, the "brain" of
choice for the world's new personal computers. At least two
other semiconductor companies are expected to make chips next
year that could be used to replace the 80386.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, the outcomes of two legal disputes could make
it easier for AMD to compete with Intel's star chip. An
arbitrator is expected to issue a ruling in September that
may let AMD make exact copies -- not just reverse-engineered
clones -- of the Intel chip. And next year a U.S. district
court will decide whether AMD may use Intel copyrights in
chips it sells.</p>
<p>The would-be cloners certainly have a juicy target: the
huge market Intel has cornered by refusing to let anyone make
its 80386 chip, which analysts expect to bring nearly $1
billion in revenue to Intel this year. And the cloners have
an eager potential clientele among computer makers, many of
whom are irate at Intel for not making enough 80386 chips.</p>
<p>Intel expects to meet demand by the end of the year, but
supply is so far behind that an unofficial spot market has
developed in which a version called the 80386SX typically
sells for 2.5 times the list price of $65.</p>
<p>"The marketplace today absolutely needs something that
looks like a 386, works like a 386 and, hopefully, plugs into
a 386 slot," says Vinod Mahendroo, marketing director at
Chips & Technologies Inc., which analysts say plans to sell
an Intel clone next year. He declined comment about that, but
added, "Intel's monopoly is absolutely hurting the
marketplace right now."</p>
<p>No one expects clones to deal a lethal blow to Intel,
which has a knack for staying ahead of competition
technologically and is sure to fight tooth and nail to defend
its intellectual property against AMD and others.</p>
<p>Still, the specter of even a little competition has given
Wall Street the jitters about Intel. The company's stock
price dropped 3.3% one day in mid-August after Bear, Stearns
& Co. analyst Andrew Neff lowered his rating on the stock,
partly because of possible competition from 80386 knock-offs.</p>
<p>Analyst Michael Gumport of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
suggests that investors hold a share of AMD for each Intel
share, in case Intel loses the arbitration or litigation
against AMD. "It doesn't make sense to own Intel without
owning AMD as a hedge," he says.</p>
<p>On Friday, AMD stock rose 12.5 cents to $5.375 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, while Intel shares rose 25
cents to $33.375 in national over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>AMD has little to lose and much to gain from battling
Intel. A sure-fire winner such as an 80386 clone would
breathe life into AMD's moribund product line, which helped
plunge the company into a net loss in its latest quarter.
AMD's version of Intel's older 80286 chip, which AMD makes
under license, has been a big moneymaker. But computer makers
are switching to the faster 80386, which can handle a broader
range of applications.</p>
<p>AMD's battle plan to break into Intel's turf will play out
over the next several months:</p>
<p>-- In September, an arbitrator is expected to rule on
AMD's charges that Intel reneged on a 1982 deal that was to
give AMD the right to make exact copies of the 80386. Under
the agreement, which set rules by which the companies were to
barter chip designs, Intel was to trade the rights to its
microprocessors for the rights to certain AMD chips. AMD
claims that Intel unfairly refused to accept AMD's chip
designs; Intel says AMD didn't create acceptable chips.</p>
<p>-- AMD launched a second attack last June when it unveiled
a chip that mimics an Intel chip called the 80287. AMD's
knockoff copies Intel's copyrighted "microcode," or internal
instructions, which AMD claims it has the right to use under
a 1976 agreement. Using a chip's microcode provides a
valuable short cut in cloning the chip. Intel sued, arguing
that AMD can only copy the code for internal use or publish
it in manuals.</p>
<p>A U.S. district court is scheduled to hear the case in
February. If it rules in AMD's favor on the 80287, AMD also
would be free to use Intel's microcode for the 80386.</p>
<p>-- Meanwhile, AMD is expected to unveil a clone of the
80386, probably in November, regardless of the arbitration
and litigation. AMD won't talk about the chip but doesn't
deny it has one in the pipeline. The clone would probably be
a reverse-engineered chip -- one built to mimic the Intel
chip without infringing on Intel-owned technology.</p>
<p>AMD is likely to show its new chip within a month of the
arbitration's results, says analyst Daniel Klesken of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "It won't be a worldbeater,"
he says, "But it's going to be an important chip for AMD."</p>
<p>The enormous profit margins of the 80386 would allow even
a late-coming AMD chip to provide AMD with healthy, though
thinner, profits, analysts say. Intel's 80386 provides gross
profit margins of as much as 80%, analysts estimate, compared
with the 35% typical of chips. Intel sold about five million
of the chips in 1989, analysts estimate, and will sell over
eight million this year. The chip helped push Intel's net
income up 72% in the latest quarter.</p>
<p>And although AMD is the biggest combatant, other chip
makers are looking at the wealth, too. Besides the expected
Chips and Technologies product, tiny V.M. Technology Corp. of
Japan says it expects to unveil a 80386 clone by year end.
NexGen Microsystems Inc. of San Jose, Calif., plans to
complete a set of chips early next year that let companies
build personal computers that mimic 80386-based machines
without using the chip.</p>
<p>Even Intel allies say they would consider buying a clone.
One test will be whether the clones can run unaltered
software from companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Lotus
Development Corp. "If those companies give it a clean bill of
health, the market will accept it and manufacturers like us
will take it as a second source," says Safi Qureshey,
president and chief executive officer of AST Research Inc., a
major personal computer maker and a loyal Intel customer.</p>
<p>Chip experts caution that would-be cloners face a
monumental task in creating a truly compatible chip without
infringing on Intel's intellectual property rights. Still,
concedes Ronald Whittier, Intel's marketing vice president:
"The realities are that when you get to a critical component,
a customer would like to see a multiple source."</p>
