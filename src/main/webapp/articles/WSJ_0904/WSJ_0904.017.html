	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Average farm prices in August fell 1.3% from
July, as an across-the-board slump in grain prices more than
offset record high prices for beef cattle and milk, the
Agriculture Department said.
   Still, average prices received by the nation's farmers
last month were 3.4% higher than in August 1989, the
department said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wheat prices dropped 20 cents to $2.59 a bushel in August,
approaching the lows of mid-1987, and rice prices slipped 19
cents to $6.76 a hundredweight. The decreases reflect the
prospect of bumper crops of spring wheat and rice this fall,
as well as the price-depressing effects of the enormous
winter wheat crop earlier this summer and growing wheat
stockpiles.</p>
<p>The loss of Iraq as a major market for U.S. commodities
also has hurt food-grain prices, according to agricultural
analysts. Before the Persian Gulf crisis, Iraq had been the
largest overseas buyer of U.S. rice and it was an important
buyer of U.S. wheat, purchasing 1.3 million metric tons last
year. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.</p>
<p>The slide in feed-grain prices last month was almost as
steep as the drop in food-grain prices, the department said.
Corn prices averaged $2.46 a bushel, down 16 cents from July,
and barley prices averaged $2.10 a bushel, down six cents.
Sorghum grain fell 29 cents last month to $4.15 a
hundredweight, the department said. Department analysts have
forecast a 1990 corn harvest of 7.85 billion bushels, up 4%
from last year.</p>
<p>Beef cattle prices climbed $1.80 last month to a record
$75.40 a hundredweight, the department said. The previous
record was $74.60, set in April 1990. Cow prices averaged
$54.10 a hundredweight in August, up $1.30 from the previous
month, and steers and heifers averaged $78.80, up $2.20. Calf
prices jumped $2 to $98.50 a hundredweight.</p>
<p>The surge in cattle prices is "the culmination of
relatively tight supplies and strong demand during first half
of 1990," said Charles Lambert, economist for the
Denver-based National Cattlemen's Association. The industry
also views the record as another sign that beef is gaining in
consumer acceptance, after years of losing ground to poultry.
The industry has lowered the fat content of beef by putting
out "a closer-trimmed product," Mr. Lambert said.</p>
<p>Milk industry analysts were somewhat taken aback last
month, as the average milk price jumped 30 cents to $14.40 a
hundredweight, a record for August, the department said. The
previous high was $13.50, set in August 1981. At $14.40, milk
was $1.20 higher than a year earlier.</p>
<p>"We were surprised," said James Barr, chief executive
officer of the National Milk Producers Federation, mostly
because the U.S. hasn't been exporting any powdered milk
lately and milk production has been growing steadily in
recent months. It was up 5% in July from a year earlier. But
unusually strong demand -- particularly for milk and cheese
-- continues to drive raw milk prices up, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, hog prices declined sharply, the department
said. Hogs averaged $56 a hundredweight, down $4.80 from
July. Barrows and gilts averaged $56.90, down $5.30, and sows
averaged $48.80, up $1.30.</p>
<p>Vegetable prices rose 6.8% in August, and fruit prices,
led by grapefruit, dropped 11%, the department said.</p>
