	<p class="article-leader">He is a general, a poet, a legendary lover. Yet he has
become a grotesque, losing not only weight, but height, as
though he were already dead. Wracked by fever, occasionally
delirious, followed by an adoring entourage, he makes his
tormented way toward death at age 47.
   Gabriel Garcia Marquez has invented some of the magic
characters of our age. His general, however, is not only
magic, but real. Simon Bolivar fought for 20 years to wrench
an empire five times larger than Europe from Spain. He
dreamed of unity, but by 1830 as the wasted, dying Bolivar
traveled down the Magdalena River, the dream was dead. His
giant new nation had been built on sand. Or rather, on the
backs of people savagely divided among themselves. Colombia
alone had 49 civil wars in the 19th century.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Garcia Marquez's "The General in His Labyrinth"
(Knopf, 285 pages, $19.95) is a novel imagining the
little-documented final days of Bolivar. It is a horror story
like "Heart of Darkness," but with a hero at the center of
its blackness.</p>
<p>By the final eight months of his life, liberator Bolivar
had become part monster as well. He had tried to pretend away
his disease for years, saying, "You can't win two races at
the same time." But it did him in just as his people finally
rejected him, and his race to build a nation was lost.</p>
<p>The book is a narrower novel than Mr. Garcia Marquez's
"One Hundred Years of Solitude" or "Love in a Time of
Cholera" because it covers a relatively short period of time
and concentrates so intensely on Bolivar that the many other
characters are only figures in the general's mind. It also is
a darker work, foreshadowing death from its first sentence.
Americans unfamiliar with or uncaring about Bolivar may find
parts of it slow, but many sections share the prose rhythms
and imaginative brilliance that are Mr. Garcia Marquez's
hallmark. It is all the more powerful for being based on
fact.</p>
<p>When "The General" was published in Spanish, it sparked
controversy in South America. Mr. Garcia Marquez, the maker
of modern myths, had turned myth-destroyer. This is not the
schoolbook Bolivar.</p>
<p>It is troubling for South American nations to confront
these last days of the liberator Bolivar. Their statues are
of the hero erect, usually mounted, always gallant. No town
square bronze portrays an 88-pound shrinking Bolivar, at
times too weak to walk, coughing, sweating, sometimes raving.</p>
<p>His power is made manifest, but so is his cruelty, his
imperiousness, his lust for women and the ugliness of his
end. Imagine the difference in the psyche of the U.S. if
George Washington had been accused of tyranny, attacked
several times by assassins, rejected by a vote of Congress
and driven in sickness to ride down the Mississippi and take
refuge on the Gulf Coast seeking passage to Europe.</p>
<p>"Now we are the widows. We are the orphans, the wounded,
the pariahs of independence," Mr. Garcia Marquez's Bolivar
says. With a ferocious pride, he fights to maintain his
dignity before everyone but his devoted slave Jose Palacios.
Sometimes he cannot. "He could not master his soul," Mr.
Garcia Marquez writes of one low point. "The color of his
skin had gone from pale green to mortal yellow. He was
feverish, and the pain in his head had become eternal."</p>
<p>The Magdalena, river of Mr. Garcia Marquez's boyhood
travels and of the journeys in "Love in a Time of Cholera,"
is a wonderful and mysterious territory once again. Passage
after passage shines with the brilliance of Mr. Garcia
Marquez writing about this riverine landscape.</p>
<p>On his last journey, Bolivar's memory is his final
dwelling place. His mind floats back over a life of triumphs,
of battles and of women. There were 35 loves, not counting
one-night stands, he and Jose Palacios reckon. "More than
anyone else in the world," is his ritual reply when women ask
if he loves them. It is always a lie. This Bolivar loves only
his dream and himself:</p>
<p>"For of all the women who passed through his life, many of
them for a few brief hours, there was none to whom he had
even suggested the idea of staying. In his urgencies of love
he was capable of changing the world in order to go to them.
Once satisfied, he was content with the illusion that he
would keep them in his memory, give himself to them from a
distance in passionate letters, send them extravagant gifts
to protect himself from oblivion, but, with an emotion that
resembled vanity more than love, he would not commit the
least part of his life to them."</p>
<p>"The General in His Labyrinth" is translated by Edith
Grossman, who also translated "Love in a Time of Cholera."
The language is almost always elegant, never more so than
when Bolivar finally succumbs to the pulmonary lesion or
malaria or both (the doctors weren't sure) that has been
working so hard for so long to overcome his great will to
live.</p>
<p>"He examined the room with the clairvoyance of his last
days, and for the first time he saw the truth: the final
borrowed bed, the pitiful dressing table whose clouded,
patient mirror would not reflect his image again, the chipped
porcelain washbasin with the water and towel and soap meant
for other hands, the heartless speed of the octagonal clock
racing toward the ineluctable appointment at seven minutes
past one on his final afternoon of December 17."</p>
