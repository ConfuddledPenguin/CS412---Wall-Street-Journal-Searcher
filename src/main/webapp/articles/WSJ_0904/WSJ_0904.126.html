	<p class="article-leader">Swire Pacific Ltd., a Hong Kong-based conglomerate, posted
a 17% decline in first-half profit to 1.09 billion Hong Kong
dollars (US$141.3 million) from HK$1.32 billion a year
earlier, citing an expected drop in property section earnings
in that operation's transition to a property investment
concern from a developer.
   Declines of 17% also were posted in pershare earnings for
Series A stock to 69.1 cents from 82.9 cents, and for Series
B to 13.8 cents from 16.6 cents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue increased 5% to HK$14.03 billion from HK$13.4
billion.</p>
<p>Directors proposed an interim dividend of 23 cents a
Series A share and 4.6 cents a Series B share, both
unchanged.</p>
<p>Swire's shipping and industries division did well in the
first half, but its aviation units, Cathay Pacific Airways
and Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering, were hurt by rising
operational costs. Cathay had a lower-than-expected 4%
growth, and the engineering unit's profit fell 8%. A downturn
in retail demand, especially in Taiwan, pared results of
trading operations.</p>
