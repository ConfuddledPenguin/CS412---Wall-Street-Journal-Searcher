	<p class="article-leader">A movement to create national examinations for elementary
and high school students is gaining momentum against
longstanding objections that such tests would violate state
and local rights.
   Supporters include President Bush's new Education Policy
Advisory Committee, a diverse group of educators and
businessmen that has endorsed national testing in the fourth,
eighth and 12th grades.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Advocates say children won't study harder until the
federal government -- or somebody with federal blessing --
tells their parents how they rank on a reliable test that
everyone takes. As a further motivation for students, many
proponents say, scores on the test must matter in deciding
such things as high school graduation or the kind of job a
student can get. Schools, districts and states also could be
ranked using national test data.</p>
<p>National tests drive the efforts of students in countries
such as Britain, Japan and West Germany, but would represent
a radical break with U.S. traditions of local control. They
also raise the possibility of a person's educational future
and career options being decided at an early age. In an Aug.
8 background paper, the U.S. Education Department's staff
called the concept a "dramatic shift from the last two
centuries of practice in education in the U.S." that would
represent a "de facto national agreement on what should be
taught."</p>
<p>Among the ideas favored by some on the president's
advisory group is a national high school graduation test. A
variation on that theme was recommended in June by the
Commission on the Skills of the American Workforce, a
foundation-funded group of education and labor leaders. The
commission proposed that all 16 year olds take a test to gain
a certificate that employers could require as a job
credential.</p>
<p>"My own view is that we ought to have a strict national
test that students have to study for, much as Europeans and
Asians do," says Thomas E. Kean, a former governor of New
Jersey and a member of both the advisory and work force
groups. "A lot of us are terribly frustrated with the current
system and feel we need to do something radical to change
it."</p>
<p>Paul O'Neill, chief executive officer of Aluminum Co. of
America and chairman of the presidential advisory group, says
he favors a national test because current indicators,
including report cards and scores on existing standardized
tests, give parents an overly rosy impression of students'
achievement. Says Mr. O'Neill, "The education world is full
of jargon and soft ideas, and we need to harden up."</p>
<p>Mr. O'Neill and other members of the advisory group argue
that national tests are the only way to fulfill the "national
education goals" set by the president and governors in a
much-ballyhooed exercise last March. The chief goal is that
students will show "demonstrated competency in challenging
subject matter" by the year 2000 in English, history,
geography, mathematics and science.</p>
<p>Other support has come from Albert Shanker, president of
the American Federation of Teachers union and a member of
both groups. In a memo to the presidential panel earlier this
month, Mr. Shanker proposed "an initial national investment
of between $200 million and $300 million to develop national
examinations."</p>
<p>Many testing critics disagree with these supporters of the
movement. They counter that the country is already
over-testing students. Walt Haney, a Boston College professor
and testing specialist, says his reaction is "largely
unfavorable" to the idea of mass tests. Mr. Haney says, "When
tests on individual students are used to measure the schools,
the results can be easily corrupted" by teachers who prompt
students on test questions and give them more time to finish
items.</p>
<p>It isn't yet clear what will emerge from current
proposals. Mr. O'Neill says the panel is still preparing
specific recommendations about which students would be
tested, which subjects would be treated and who would pay for
it. The Education Department, prompted by the group, also has
begun studying possibilities. Among other things, U.S.
researchers are looking at ways to report a standard national
test score that would give parents a new measure of their
children's school progress.</p>
<p>At the same time, behind-the-scenes debate on monitoring
national education goals has exposed a potentially
embarrassing problem for the Bush administration.</p>
<p>Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos is opposed to federal
sponsorship of a national test to monitor the goals, arguing
in a private Aug. 8 letter to Mr. O'Neill that "it would
alter two centuries of tradition" of states' education
control.</p>
<p>Others in the administration have been taken aback that
the O'Neill panel, laden with conservative businessmen and
Republicans, has proposed something Mr. Kean calls "not a
very conservative idea." At a July meeting of the O'Neill
group, according to people who were there, White House
domestic-policy adviser Roger Porter exchanged angry words
with David Kearns, chairman of Xerox Corp., when Mr. Kearns
suggested the Bush administration was dragging its feet on
following through with effective monitoring of the goals.</p>
<p>The Education Department's background paper, while
endorsing no particular option, suggests that the Bush
administration would accept some form of national testing, so
long as the federal government's role was limited. The paper
said alternatives to complete federal sponsorhip include a
schools' consortium similar to the ones that run college
entrance tests or a specially chartered group partly funded
by the states and federal government.</p>
<p>Under its most ambitious configuration, the paper said a
national testing program would have a huge impact on schools,
and take several years to implement. More than nine million
students in three grades -- roughly six times the number that
take the Scholastic Aptitude Test -- would be tested each
year. The paper warns, however, that curriculum variety could
narrow rapidly, as students and teachers focus on subjects
covered by the exam.</p>
<p>Under the only current federal examination program, the
National Assessment of Educational Progress, about 220,000
students will be tested this year. But NAEP merely measures
whether the nation's students as a whole are making progress
over the years and isn't used to measure individual students.
In its background paper, the Education Department says it
might be possible to expand NAEP into a national examination,
or to calculate a standard report to parents that would
equate state-mandated tests that students are already taking
with NAEP scores.</p>
<p>Chester E. Finn Jr., chairman of the panel that runs NAEP
and also a member of the presidential panel, says he hasn't
decided whether a new test is needed. But he adds that he's
convinced parents need new information because most of them
falsely believe their children are doing well. "Right now you
can't find out how your kid or school stands vis-a-vis
national goals, and if you can't find that out, you won't
change your behavior toward your kid, and nothing is going to
change."</p>
