	<p class="article-leader">PacifiCorp agreed to drop its pursuit of Pinnacle West
Capital Corp., ending a 10-month battle, in exchange for
seasonal "power swaps" with Pinnacle West's Arizona utility
unit in a pact potentially valued at $260 million.
   PacifiCorp would get about half the additional power
capacity it had sought in repeated attempts to acquire
Pinnacle West or its Arizona Public Service Co. under the
agreement. PacifiCorp had talked of a hostile bid after
Pinnacle West's board rejected its latest bid of $1.82
billion, or $21 a share, in May as financially inadequate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A.M. Gleason, PacifiCorp president and chief executive
officer, said he would rather have gained all of Arizona
Public, making PacifiCorp the country's biggest
investor-owned utility. "But we made a judgment based on
economics and concluded this was a satisfactory alternative."</p>
<p>For Pinnacle West shareholders, "this is a real shocker,"
said Edward J. Tirello, a utility analyst at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co. "It leaves them with a basketful of
promises and no money. I wouldn't be surprised if the stock
drops to $12 a share."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Pinnacle West shares closed at $16.125, up 12.5 cents and
PacifiCorp closed at $19.375, up 50 cents. The power swap was
announced after the close of trading.</p>
<p>During the weekend, Richard Snell, Pinnacle West
president, chairman and chief executive officer, said that
the pact doesn't include a formal standstill agreement with
PacifiCorp but that lawyers are drafting one.</p>
<p>Mr. Snell added that further hostilities would be
"inconsistent" with the new rapport between the companies'
chief executives. They and aides crafted the power swap over
the past two weeks, working mostly at a Las Vegas hotel to
ensure secrecy.</p>
<p>Pinnacle West, based in Phoenix, Ariz., is a holding
company whose Arizona Public is the state's largest utility.
PacifiCorp is a Portland, Ore., electric utility whose
service territories cover parts of seven states reaching east
from the Pacific Northwest to Utah, but which exclude Arizona
and Nevada.</p>
<p>Analysts quickly theorized that Nevada Power could be
PacifiCorp's next takeover target. "I wouldn't speculate on
whether we would or wouldn't do anything beyond this
transaction," Mr. Gleason said.</p>
<p>State and federal regulators must approve the 30-year
agreement, which could take several months. PacifiCorp would
gain a partial interest in two units of Arizona Public's
Cholla coal-fired power plant, giving it about 350 additional
megawatts of capacity during its peak winter season at
relatively low cost. Analysts said it is paying about $600 a
kilowatt hour to Pinnacle West for the Cholla capacity, far
less than the $2,000 a kilowatt hour cost of a new plant.</p>
<p>PacifiCorp would initially sell back half of its Cholla
capacity to Arizona Public between May and October, when that
utility's power needs are greatest.</p>
<p>After five years, the agreement would allow Arizona Public
to buy back all of that power during the hottest six months
of the year. The two companies also agreed to share some
transmission facilities.</p>
<p>If regulators approve the pact, PacifiCorp would
immediately pay Arizona Public $220 million. It would pay
Arizona Public another $40 million over the next five years
if Arizona Public added more transmission lines.</p>
<p>Although power-sharing is used by several Northeastern
utilities, "this is probably the first between regions this
far apart and with these kinds of climactic differences,"
said Mr. Gleason.</p>
<p>Pinnacle West would get badly needed cash from the
arrangement for its plan to pay about $600 million of debt by
the end of 1993 and restore its common-stock dividend. The
company suspended its payout of 40 cents a share last October
in the face of mounting losses from its MeraBank thrift unit,
which was seized by federal regulators in January.</p>
<p>The PacifiCorp pact "probably won't affect that
timetable," said Mr. Snell. But he added that Pinnacle West
will further reduce its requested rate increase. The company
revised its initial request for a 22% boost over the next
three years in June after unveiling a cost-squeezing plan.
The PacifiCorp agreement won't increase job reductions slated
in the plan for this year.</p>
<p>Mr. Snell said Pinnacle West remains uninterested in a
$500 million offer by Salt River Project, a
quasi-municipality, for some of Arizona Public's transmission
facilities. A Salt River spokesman said that, as before, it
wouldn't pursue its offer aggressively, "but we need time to
analyze what effect this agreement will have on us. Other
utilities in the Southwest will be doing the same thing."</p>
