	<p class="article-leader">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Singapore's trade deficit
widened 32% in June to 1.46 billion Singapore dollars
(US$829.9 million) from S$1.08 billion (US$610 million) in
May and grew 92% from S$761 million in June 1989.
   The June data, released later than expected, confirmed
economists' projections of weakening exports. Exports fell
1.6% in the month to S$7.62 billion from S$7.74 billion in
May, while imports rose 3% to S$9.08 billion from S$8.82
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Compared with their levels in June 1989, export values
grew 3.9%, while imports surged 12.2%. The figures are all
reported in nominal terms.</p>
