	<p class="article-leader">SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -- The Federal Trade
Commission ordered Roche Holding Ltd. and Genentech Inc. to
divest themselves of two tiny development projects. The
ruling paves the way for Roche, a Swiss-based pharmaceutical
concern, to gain control of Genentech, a biotechnology
company, on or about Sept. 7.
   A spokesman said the two companies were pleased with the
FTC ruling. "We think the restrictions required . . . are
well worth being able to complete the transaction in a timely
manner," he said, adding that neither of the two units to be
divested currently produces any revenue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the terms of the consent decree, San Francisco-based
Genentech must sell its half-stake in GLC Associates, a
Cleveland, Ohio, partnership, which has a unit based here
that produces vitamin C. Roche must sell its patents and
research involving a "releasing factor" for human growth
hormones.</p>
<p>The sales aren't likely to have much impact on either
concern. Roche already is a major supplier of vitamin C, and
the company's growth hormone project apparently is some years
from reaping products, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>In February, Roche stunned the U.S. biotechnology industry
by announcing a takeover of Genentech, the nation's biggest
biotechnology firm. Initially, the company will own 60% of
Genentech and will hold two of the 13 seats on the board. But
in the next five years, Roche has the right to buy the rest
of Genentech at $38 to $60 a share.</p>
<p>While the FTC can't rescind its approval of Genentech's
merger with Roche, the agency will accept public comment on
its ruling for the next 60 days before deciding whether to
make the ruling final.</p>
