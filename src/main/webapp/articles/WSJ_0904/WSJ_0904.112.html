	<p class="article-leader">MedChem Products Inc., Woburn, Mass., said a federal
appeals court hearing scheduled for Friday in its patent
battle with Pharmacia AB was postponed because the companies
"are close to an agreement in principle" to settle the
litigation.
   Pharmacia, a Swedish concern, won an injunction in
December in federal district court in Boston. The injunction
limits MedChem's production of hyaluronic acid-based products
used in eye surgery. The court earlier ruled that MedChem's
Amvisc product line infringes on a product to which Pharmacia
owns the license. MedChem has appealed the injunction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MedChem, a maker of biomedical products, said, "There are
still certain details to be worked out" before its dispute
with Pharmacia can be settled. "Discussions are expected to
continue in order to resolve these differences," the company
added.</p>
