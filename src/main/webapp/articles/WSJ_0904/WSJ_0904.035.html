	<p class="article-leader">GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- Gantos Inc. said it plans to open
five stores next year, well below the 30 stores it usually
opens each year.
   The women's clothing retailer said it is opening fewer
outlets because it needs to "pause and fine tune" its
existing operations. Gantos said it plans to remodel five of
its stores next year.</p>
