	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Scratch one men's magazine.
   Men, a magazine that was supposed to launch in early 1991,
will instead merge with Smart, a men's magazine published by
New American Magazine Co. Smart, which is 18 months old, will
carry a new, extended title -- Smart: for Men.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Peter Kaplan, the editor who had helped develop Men for
Fairfield, Conn.-based Norris Publishing, will be the new
editor in chief of Smart. The men's general-interest magazine
recently lost its founding editor Terry McDonell when he was
named editor of Hearst Corp.'s Esquire.</p>
<p>Owen Lipstein, chairman of New American Magazine Co., said
Christopher Kimball, one of the founders of Norris
Publishing, will become publishing director of New American
Magazine Co. Besides Smart, Mr. Lipstein's New York-based
company also publishes Mother Earth News and Psychology
Today.</p>
<p>Mr. Lipstein wouldn't say what he paid to acquire Men; he
did say that many of Mr. Kaplan's ideas for his magazine
would be incorporated into Smart.</p>
