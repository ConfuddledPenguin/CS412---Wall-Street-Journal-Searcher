	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canada's inflation-adjusted gross domestic
product declined at a compound annual rate of 1.6% in the
second quarter, Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.
   The downturn affected all major areas of domestic demand,
as well as corporate profits and personal disposable income.
In terms of 1986 prices, GDP was at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 571.33 billion Canadian dollars (US$498.09
billion) in the second quarter, off 0.4% from a first-quarter
rate of C$573.69 billion.</p>
