	<p class="article-leader">N.V. Philips is expected to abandon one of its most
cherished semiconductor projects in a bid to reduce losses.
   A senior executive familiar with the company confirmed
Dutch news reports that Philips will stop making static
random access memory chips, or SRAMs, after spending more
than $200 million in the 1980s to develop the technology.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dutch electronics company also is expected to reduce
its participation in the Joint European Submicron Silicon
project, known as JESSI, under which major European companies
are jointly developing semiconductor technology with
subsidies from national governments and the European
Community.</p>
<p>A Philips spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>The moves by Philips, one of the major pillars of
technology research in Europe, would be a blow to European
efforts to catch up with Japan and the U.S. in semiconductor
technology and sales said Bill Coleman, an analyst at the
London stockbrokerage James Capel & Co.</p>
<p>At the same time, the cost-cutting measures would
demonstrate that Philips's new chairman, Jan Timmer, is
willing to sacrifice some of the company's highest
technological ambitions in an effort to improve financial
results.</p>
<p>SRAMs, which retain their information even when the power
is turned off, are memory chips used in telecommunications
equipment, defense electronics and portable computers, among
other products.</p>
