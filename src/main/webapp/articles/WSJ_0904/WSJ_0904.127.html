	<p class="article-leader">ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- Hedged-Investments Associates Inc. and
its founder, James D. Donahue, filed for protection from
creditors under the federal Bankruptcy Code late Thursday.
   Hedged-Investments is managing general partner of Hedged
Securities Associates Inc., a limited partnership. On Aug.
23, Mr. Donahue told 500 Hedged Securities investors, via
videotape, that he had lost more than $100 million of their
money through stock-option trading, primarily involving
shares of UAL Corp. Attorneys for the firm say Hedged
Securities has only about $2 million in assets remaining.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hedged-Investments filed under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code, which gives businesses protection from
creditors while they formulate a reorganization plan. Mr.
Donahue filed under Chapter 13, which grants similar
protection to individuals. Aeroturbine Energy Corp., another
Hedged Investments subsidiary, also filed for Chapter 11
protection.</p>
<p>The Hedged-Investment filing listed more than 1,000
creditors but provided few details about the company's assets
and liabilities. Lawyers for the firm said such information
would be provided in future filings.</p>
<p>In a federal lawsuit filed last week, Weyerhaeuser Co.
said its pension fund lost an estimated $35 million by
investing in Hedged Securities. In separate suits filed in
state district court here, Paradigm Partners Inc., Chicago
said a pension fund it controls lost more than $15 million
through similar investments. Union Texas Petroleum Holdings
Inc., Houston, said its pension fund lost about $8 million.</p>
