	<p class="article-leader">The dollar is expected to falter further against most
major currencies this month and much of this autumn.
   Worsening U.S. economic fundamentals, which could lead to
lower U.S. interest rates when rates abroad are rising, will
erode support for the dollar, according to 10 economists and
traders surveyed by Dow Jones International News Service in
New York, Tokyo, Frankfurt and London.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, the crisis in the Persian Gulf hangs ominously
over the market, providing a constant source of volatility.</p>
<p>The narrowing U.S. trade deficit and the emergence of
problems besetting other economies could provide an
undercurrent of strength for the dollar in the long run,
economists say. But they disagree on whether these factors
will start to turn the dollar around before winter.</p>
<p>By the end of September, the dollar is expected to plumb
new depths against the German currency, sinking to 1.53
marks, according to those in the survey. The dollar's
all-time low against the mark, 1.5385 marks, was reached Aug.
27.</p>
<p>Despite one bullish analyst's forecast that the dollar
will rise to 1.60 marks by the end of September and as high
as 1.75 marks by the end of November, the average forecast in
the survey calls for the dollar to weaken to 1.51 marks in
the next three months, with one estimate as low as 1.45
marks.</p>
<p>The dollar also will weaken to 141 yen by the end of
September and to 140 yen by the end of November, according to
the average forecast. Forecasts stayed within the 140-yen to
143-yen range for the 30-day period but ranged from 131 yen
to 152 yen for the next 90 days. Predictions made about a
month ago called for the dollar to be at 1.6045 marks, 148.03
yen and 1.3598 Swiss francs at the end of August and for the
pound to stand at $1.8315.</p>
<p>In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at
1.5755 marks, 143.79 yen and 1.3084 Swiss francs. The pound
was quoted at $1.8905. There was no trading in New York
yesterday because of the Labor Day holiday. Late yesterday in
London, the dollar was quoted at 1.5837 marks and 143.53 yen.
In Tokyo, meanwhile, the dollar finished Monday at 143.55
yen.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday the dollar was quoted at
143.77 yen, down from 143.80 yen at the open but above the
143.53 yen in London late yesterday. New York markets were
closed for the Labor Day holiday yesterday.</p>
<p>Since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, developments in
the Persian Gulf have overshadowed economic indicators as
well as events in Eastern Europe. But as the threat of
hostilities in the Mideast waxes and wanes, and participants
adjust positions accordingly, attention has begun to shift
back toward fundamentals.</p>
<p>Most of the economists surveyed made their estimates on
the assumption the Mideast conflict will be resolved without
fighting. However, even a war there wouldn't necessarily
bring an economically shattering scenario, said Akira Suzuki,
chief manager of foreign exchange at Mitsubishi Trust &
Banking Corp. in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Tim Fox, treasury economist at Midland Bank PLC in London,
suggested that the dollar would shoot upward briefly if
hostilities were to erupt but would then continue its
downtrend.</p>
<p>The dollar's recent emergence as a less attractive haven
in an international crisis than its Swiss or British
counterparts reflects the bearish view that prevailed before
the U.S.-Iraqi confrontation in the Gulf began. This
bearishness is expected to persist in the next few months.</p>
<p>Central bank actions will continue driving currency
markets, traders and economists say. The dollar suffers from
U.S. interest rates that are relatively low in
inflation-adjusted terms, and it will probably become even
more unappealing as an investment currency, they say. An
early easing of rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve is seen as
likely, as are further rate increases by other central banks.</p>
<p>Michael Rosenberg, international foreign exchange
economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Group in New
York, said U.S. fiscal and monetary policy already is
shifting away from an anti-inflation stance and toward
recession avoidance, a move he said is undermining the U.S.'s
credibility as an inflation-fighter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan last week raised its discount
rate 0.75 percentage point to 6%. The increase in the rate
the central bank charges on loans to financial institutions
was the fifth in a series that began in May 1989, when the
rate was at a historic low of 2.5%.</p>
<p>"The interest rate gap in favor of U.S. rates will
reverse," said Mr. Suzuki.</p>
<p>One economist called 140 yen a firm support level for the
dollar and said he expects the dollar to begin edging higher
at the end of November.</p>
<p>The mark's outlook depends largely on the state of the
German economy as the country completes the process of
reunification this fall, traders and economists said. Allan
Leslie of Discount Corp. in New York said the process "has to
be inflationary," that "it would be unbelievable for it not
to have a major inflationary impact."</p>
<p>Rising inflation and a shrinking trade surplus are
expected to exert upward pressure on German interest rates.
Several economists predict an eventual rate rise by the
Bundesbank, although most said the central bank will try to
wait until after the all-German elections set for Dec. 2.</p>
<p>Ernest Pullmann, chief foreign exchange trader and vice
president for Deutsche Girozentrale in Frankfurt, suggested
that despite the shrinking of the trade surplus and high cost
of unification, the Bundesbank won't raise rates before next
spring.</p>
<p>Uncertainty in the Middle East will continue to provide
support to the pound, but as the threat of severe oil
shortages wanes, some of that strength could diminish.</p>
<p>Sterling's status as a high-yielding currency could also
be undermined by widespread expectations that Britain will
cut its interest rates shortly after the pound enters the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.</p>
<p>When sterling will join the mechanism, however, remains
open to speculation, with predictions ranging from as soon as
next month to well into 1991 by one account.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery dropped $4.40 to settle at $382.30 an ounce.
Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$387.75. an ounce.</p>
