	<p class="article-leader">Lone Star Technologies Inc., Dallas, said its American
Federal Bank subsidiary redeemed all of its preferred stock
held by federal regulators, giving Lone Star 100% control of
the thrift.
   Lone Star, which also owns a troubled steelmaking company,
said American Federal redeemed the $48 million Class A
convertible preferred stock issue by canceling a $48 million
note that regulators owed the thrift and by paying regulators
$3.7 million. Cumulative accrued and unpaid dividends due
regulators were canceled, resulting in income to the thrift
of about $3.7 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. resolution
fund purchased the preferred in 1988 as part of a $1.3
billion bailout that combined 12 insolvent thrifts into
American Federal. Lone Star paid $48 million for all the
common stock of the resulting institution.</p>
<p>A Lone Star spokeswoman said regulators also agreed to
give American Federal "more flexibility" to pay dividends.</p>
