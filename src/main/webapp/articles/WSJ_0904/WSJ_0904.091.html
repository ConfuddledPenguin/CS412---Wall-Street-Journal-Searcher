	<p class="article-leader">Borland International Inc. said an action it filed in
federal court in San Francisco against Lotus Development
Corp. was dismissed, thereby allowing the federal court in
Boston to decide where the case should be heard.
   In late June and early July, Borland, based in Scotts
Valley, Calif., and Lotus, based in Cambridge, Mass., filed
lawsuits in San Francisco and Boston both seeking to
determine whether Borland's spreadsheet software would
infringe on any Lotus copyrights covering its 1-2-3
spreadsheets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One analyst, who asked not to be named, said the ruling
was a blow to Borland, because the federal judge in Boston is
presumed to take an expansive view of Lotus's rights in the
case. Earlier this year, Judge Robert Keeton sided with Lotus
in a copyright infringement case involving another software
maker.</p>
