	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Iraqi invaders begin making inroads into
the indicators in what's likely to be a slack August
purchasing managers' index due out today. But important jobs
data first face a different enemy: downward revisions.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management's index
is expected to hover around 47.4%, the same level as in July,
according to MMS International Inc., a unit of McGraw-Hill
Inc., New York. But the reading remains well below 50%,
indicating a sliding economy. A reading above 50% indicates
an expanding economy. In June, the index stood at 51.1%.
August's unemployment rate, due out Friday, is also expected
to be flat following the previous month's deepening to 5.5%.
Furthermore, benchmark revisions are expected to slice
further into the softening payroll head count. The week's
only other major indicator is construction spending, also due
out today and also likely to remain soft.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The numbers are going to be weak," said Donald H.
Straszheim, Merrill Lynch's chief economist, who thinks the
purchasers' index may slip a bit further. "All this invasion
does is create uncertainty and that causes a lot of
businessmen to freeze in their tracks."</p>
<p>Ironically, the jump in oil prices may be a partly
positive influence on the August index by pushing up the
price component. And, the inventory segment may be plumped by
buyers trying to hedge against rising costs for fuel and
petrochemical-based supplies.</p>
<p>Some mixed signals came Friday from two smaller, regional
pruchasing managers' indexes: Detroit and Chicago. The August
Chicago index rose nearly one percentage point to 49.2%. But
the Detroit index fell sharply to 44.1% from 52.8% in July --
the largest one-month drop since November 1987, right after
the October stock-market plummet. Economists said the
diversified Chicago economy probably helped the Windy City
index hold up better than the auto-dependent Detroit area.
The Detroit purchasers cited the Mideast conflict as a source
of pessimism but noted that weakness in the auto industry was
a key factor.</p>
<p>"The purchasers' index tells the continuing story of the
end of the auto `miniboom,'" said Gary Ciminero, chief
economist at Fleet/Norstar Financial Group, Providence, R.I.
He and others believe that rising oil prices only add to the
mounting economic reasons why consumers aren't likely to rush
out to buy new cars, regardless of any incentives. He expects
auto makers to cut September and October production levels
because of the oil crisis.</p>
<p>But Mr. Ciminero believes that the government's benchmark
revisions to important past employment data are potentially
far more negative than whatever the national purchasers'
index discloses. "We can throw out all these jigs and jags in
monthly employment numbers. They were far weaker than we
thought," he says.</p>
<p>Downward adjustments in hourly wages may be particularly
significant, said Mr. Ciminero. Lower wage levels might ease
concerns over wage-push inflation and explain "why consumers
are so strapped."</p>
<p>David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI/McGraw Hill,
agrees that the jobs report will be negative. "We're looking
for a weak August following a massive drop in July," he said.
The consensus calls for an increase of only 75,000 non-farm
jobs in August -- excluding layoffs of temporary census
workers. Including the layoffs, nonfarm payrolls in August
fell by 33,000 jobs, according to the consensus view.</p>
<p>Rising oil prices, coupled with the downturn in
construction, prompted economists at Morgan Guaranty Trust
Co. to predict an imminent recession. Morgan said in a
statement Friday that the U.S. economy appears likely to move
into recession over the next few months.</p>
