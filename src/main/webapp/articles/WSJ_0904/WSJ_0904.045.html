	<p class="article-leader">BOISE, Idaho -- Mary Cunningham Agee insists she is doing
today what she was trying to accomplish at the former Bendix
Corp. a decade ago: help women gain options in their lives.
That wasn't understood then, she says, because her
relationship to the CEO -- now her husband -- was the stuff
of business gossip. She wants it clear now, in relation to
her four-year-old Nurturing Network.
   A feminist basis for the group might seem odd because its
mission is to provide alternatives to abortion, access to
which is a litmus issue for many female careerists. But Mrs.
Agee sees herself providing a truer "choice" for working
women than merely the desperate ending of a pregnancy to
salvage a personal future.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Before she gained notoriety in the early 1980s as the
personification of Ms. Fast Track -- Harvard Business School
to the corporate suite while still in her 20s -- Mary
Cunningham had been a logic major at Wellesley. That trained
her to realize, she says, that "the life vs. choice debate
will go on forever, because they are not opposites."</p>
<p>A miscarriage six years ago engaged her emotionally, she
says, in the tender trials of maternal loss. Her informal
surveys convinced her that most abortions are forced by job
demands, associates at school, family or mate. She is
outraged by this "ultimate violence to women," she says, and
the Nurturing Network is her response.</p>
<p>Mrs. Agee pulls from her desk a "data base" of employers
and colleges that will arrange quickly to maintain the career
or schooling of a pregnant woman while she escapes an
unaccepting or pressurized environment. If the woman wishes
to change addresses as well, a "nurturing family" resembling
the home in which she was raised can be found for her, rent
free, nearly anywhere in the country.</p>
<p>Building the network began with Mrs. Agee calling 15
contacts from her corporate days. William Agee, now the CEO
of Morrison Knudsen Corp., has provided names. The attraction
of more than 1,000 clients was largely by word of mouth.</p>
<p>For now, all calls come through a small suite of offices
on Main Street in Boise (208 344-7200). The Agees and their
two young children moved here in 1988.</p>
<p>It's not life in the big city but Mrs. Agee, 39, still
thinks of herself as a strategic planner. Before starting
Nurturing Network, she says, she did an "industry analysis"
to determine that most abortion-alternative programs were for
teen-agers, while 80% of those facing a "crisis pregnancy"
were older. Referrals to homes for unwed mothers were what
these women were offered. "Tell me that a 24-year-old
graduate of a good state university is going to think that's
viable," she says. "She's not. She's going to say, `Well, I
guess it doesn't happen to women like me. I have one
choice.'"</p>
<p>Mrs. Agee's counselors tell these women they are many, and
that they have other choices. Sometimes handholding is
enough: The woman has medical benefits through work and a
sufficiently supportive family, and chooses to stick it out.
When that won't do, the network is activated. Mrs. Agee cites
a recent client with a background not unlike her own. The
28-year-old Ivy Leaguer worked at a Wall Street investment
bank -- for the father of her baby-to-be. "And as far as he
was concerned, the baby went or she went -- and he could make
it happen," she recounts. "You go, `That's illegal, they
can't do that.' They do it. It happens all the time. Suddenly
your work history looks a little different. Your assignment
wasn't handled properly. We all know that you can be made to
fail. I know that better than anybody."</p>
<p>Nurturing Network seeks to empower its clients. In this
case, "We moved her 3,000 miles away to another
investment-banking house -- not as big, not as prominent, but
a good assignment working for a senior partner, where she is
going to work corporate finance, she's going to have some
interesting deals." The woman plans to have and keep the
child and stay on the West Coast.</p>
<p>Although most of the clients aren't in "glamorous" jobs,
Mrs. Agee says, and may only need secretarial work, the stars
stand out because those women are assumed to plan their
pregnancies as carefully as they would a sales presentation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Agee recalls helping a Fortune 500 riser relocate to
New Mexico, where she took one of the "assistant to the boss"
positions that is typically arranged. She gave her baby up
for adoption and returned to her old job. "Her current
employer has no idea what happened during those five months,"
Mrs. Agee says.</p>
<p>A parent's supposed illness might be a pretext for such a
personal leave. In such a situation, the woman "won't make a
financial killing but she won't need to," Mrs. Agee says.
"She wants to keep her resume intact. That's what's
motivating her."</p>
<p>Not all fast-trackers will avoid slipping a step or two.
"I can't guarantee that about anyone, much less someone with
a crisis on their hands," Mrs. Agee says. But she maintains
that, by influencing employment practices on the margin,
she's helping to overcome a "signal I saw being sent in
society, that women could either be mothers or working women.
The signal for me is so dangerous because it separates a lot
of women from an integral part of themselves. It was
something I almost made the mistake of doing. . . . It's a
very easy pattern to get into, because it reinforces itself
-- you surround yourself with other women making that
`choice.'"</p>
<p>Mrs. Agee says she hopes soon to be able to reveal at
least four employers that have been working with her quietly
while watching to make sure she stays clear of the politics
of abortion. She counts on greater support as "more and more
corporations that are running scared from organizations like
Planned Parenthood are looking at Nurturing Network and
saying this is great, because you're not in the middle of the
debate." Because she envisions "not steady growth, but major
growth," Mrs. Agee wants to franchise her concept around the
country.</p>
<p>Mrs. Agee portrays her husband as exemplary of enlightened
management and says that was what attracted her to him and
Bendix. "I was very idealistic," she says. "I thought that
you could accomplish wonderful societal reforms through
{corporate} organizations, not only by how you handle your
employees but by supporting a CEO who had those policies."
But her "iconoclastic" ways weren't understood. Now, she
says, she has adopted a more traditional service-group
approach.</p>
<p>Although Mrs. Agee is Catholic and arms of the church have
been among the most active promoters of her network, she
doesn't mention religion until prodded, and then says only,
"Catholicism is utterly consistent with what I'm doing but it
is not the motivation for what I'm doing."</p>
<p>Readers of her 1984 book, "Powerplay," found Mary
Cunningham driven by many things. It seems the searing
experiences in a male-dominated world linger, bubbling up
amid the passion of Mary Agee that powers the Nurturing
Network.</p>
