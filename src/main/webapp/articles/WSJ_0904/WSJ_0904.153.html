	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- The Canadian and Hong Kong parties that
agreed last month to buy Columbia Savings & Loan
Association's $3 billion junk-bond portfolio may back out of
the deal if the U.S. economy deteriorates further.
   In an interview, a top official connected with the
purchase said the prospective buyers, three groups controlled
by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing and Gordon Investment
Corp., a Toronto merchant bank, became concerned about the
transaction when the Persian Gulf crisis erupted.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We are monitoring the situation very closely," said
Richard Li, son of the tycoon and managing director of the
corporate fund management committee of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.
"We are aware of our options and would exploit our options if
necessary."</p>
<p>Mr. Li said his group and Gordon Investment have until
Oct. 2 to decide whether to go through with the purchase of
the portfolio from the Beverly Hills, Calif., thrift. If the
decision were made today, he said, they would go through with
the deal. But he said they would back out if it appeared the
U.S. economy would weaken to the point where the bond issuers
couldn't meet their obligations.</p>
<p>The groups wouldn't face any penalty if they were to scrap
the agreement before the deadline, Mr. Li added.</p>
<p>Late last month, the Li group said it would buy half of
Columbia's portfolio of junk bonds, believed to be largest
held by any U.S. savings and loan association, by taking a
50% stake in a partnership owned by Gordon Investment, which
had just agreed to acquire the portfolio. Hutchison, a major
local conglomerate, and sister company Cheung Kong (Holdings)
Ltd., a real estate group, each agreed to take 20% interests
in the venture, with a company controlled by the elder Li
taking the remaining 10%.</p>
<p>Together with Gordon Investment, the Li group agreed to
pay $300 million to acquire the portfolio and finance the
remaining 90% on a non-recourse basis at 10.5% interest. That
means that the partnership can drop the portfolio if its
losses exceed the down payment and Columbia would have to
take the portfolio back.</p>
<p>Mr. Li said the groups have retained a number of
U.S.-based investment and legal advisers to help determine
whether they should proceed with the transaction, but
declined to identify them. He also wouldn't say whether it
was possible to modify the agreement as an alternative to
pulling out altogether.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old executive said the parties are chiefly
interested in determining whether the economic slowdown,
which has been aggravated by soaring oil prices, would
prevent the 176 issuers from meeting their debt payments,
which carry yields ranging between 14% and 18%.</p>
<p>"It really depends on the general economic outlook and how
different industries would be affected," he said. "Based on
today's outlook, it would be a go, but a lot can happen in
the next 30 days."</p>
<p>As well as pursuing the junk-bond portfolio for its
investment potential, Mr. Li said the Hong Kong partners are
interested in using it to gain expertise on the U.S. market
as part of their goal to diversify its investments beyond
Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The possiblity that the deal could fall through didn't
greatly surprise several local securities analysts.</p>
<p>John Mulcahy, research director at Peregrine Brokerage
Ltd., said the prospect of high inflation and slow growth in
the U.S. would make it difficult for companies with
high-yielding bonds to make good on them. He also said it
wouldn't be much of a loss for the Li companies if the deal
fell through.</p>
<p>"I'd heave a sigh of relief, quite frankly," Mr. Mulcahy
said. "There (are) different ways to acquire an education
about the U.S. than this. There are high risks associated
with this investment, and junk bonds aren't something one
would invest in a Hong Kong conglomerate for."</p>
