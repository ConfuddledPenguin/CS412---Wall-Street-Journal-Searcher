	<p class="article-leader">Nestor Inc. said in Providence, R.I., that Sligos S.A., a
French financial services concern, bought "just under" a 5%
stake in Nestor and signed a letter of intent to finance the
development and licensing of certain Nestor financial
products and services in Europe.
   Nestor makes software based on neural networks, computer
systems that roughly mimic operation of the brain's neurons.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sligos purchased 352,064 shares of Nestor's Series A
preferred, convertible into an equal number of shares of the
company's common, for $704,128, Nestor said.</p>
<p>If Sligos doesn't reach a "satisfactory" agreement to fund
development and licensing of the Nestor products in Europe,
it may require Nestor to buy back the preferred stock, at
cost, Nestor said.</p>
