	<p class="article-leader">HARTFORD, Conn. -- A group including Heine Securities
Corp. of Short Hills, N.J., and Michael F. Price said it is
dissatisfied with what it described as the failure of Society
for Savings Bancorp's management to enhance shareholder
value.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Heine said
the management should actively seek to maximize shareholder
value, including the possible sale or spinoff of Society's
consumer finance business. William Kosturko, Society's
executive vice president, declined to comment on the group's
filing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The group holds 645,339 Society shares, or a 5.4% stake,
which was previously reported in an SEC filing as being held
for investment reasons.</p>
