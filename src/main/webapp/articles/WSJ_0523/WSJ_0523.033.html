	<p class="article-leader">School and employment testing is growing out of control
and needs a special regulator, according to a study
commissioned by the Ford Foundation.
   The report, the outcome of three years of work, says that
standardized multiple-choice tests in the schools are widely
misused, misreported and cheated on, with virtually no
meaningful regulatory monitoring. As a result, the report
said, minority groups and female students are unfairly
discriminated against, and all students are distracted from
learning.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although various groups have criticized the tests in the
past over particular issues, the study was the first from a
broad-based group of politicians, educators and businessmen
to be so critical of mass testing. Many of the new tests were
produced by state laws and other school-reform initiatives in
the 1980s.</p>
<p>The report estimated that U.S. students from kindergarten
to 12th grade are taking 127 million standardized tests a
year -- almost three per student and higher than any previous
estimate. The report said that from 1972 to 1989, the number
of statewide school testing programs grew to 50 from one. It
also said more schools are relying heavily on tests to decide
entry to and exit from kindergarten, promotion from grade to
grade, placement in remedial programs and graduation from
high school.</p>
<p>"Current testing, predominantly multiple choice in format,
is over-relied upon, lacks adequate public accountability,
sometimes leads to unfairness in the allocation of
opportunities and too often undermines vital social
policies," the report said.</p>
<p>Although no tests were named in the count, included in the
study were exams such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test for
college admissions, publishing-house products such as the
California Achievement Test and the Metropolitan Achievement
Test, and assessments created and given by state departments
of education. The study's authors, calling themselves the
National Commission on Testing and Public Policy, included
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Julius Chambers of the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund, and officials from Apple Computer Inc.,
Pacific Telesis Group, and Aetna Life & Casualty Co.</p>
<p>Testing-industry officials and others disputed the
report's claims and questioned the need for an oversight body
for testing.</p>
<p>"Based on your characterizations of what's in it I'd say
{the report} is doing a gross disservice to test publishers,"
said David Deffley, president of the test-writing unit of
MacMillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Co., a joint venture
of McGraw-Hill Inc. and Maxwell Communication Corp.'s
MacMillan subsidiary. Mr. Deffley, who said he hadn't yet
seen the report, added that test publishers shouldn't be
blamed when a school uses their tests for things they weren't
designed for, such as promotion or graduation decisions.</p>
<p>The report gave no estimate for the number of employment
tests being given, but concluded that they were growing
rapidly. Walter Haney, a professor at Boston College who
worked on the study, said that more than half of all
employers use some form of entry test to screen applicants,
and that more government authorities and professional groups
have mandated licensing and certification tests in recent
years.</p>
<p>The commission said it was most concerned with
over-reliance on multiple-choice tests as "gatekeepers" that
"allocate initial opportunities in education, employment and
the military." In addition to less testing, it advocated more
use of alternative assessments such as reviews of work
samples, essays, and oral presentations.</p>
<p>The study said that teachers and school officials are
being held more accountable for their students' test results,
even though the tests being used weren't designed for that
purpose. As a result, it said, schools are being driven to
exaggerate results, by couching scores that are disclosed in
the most favorable terms.</p>
<p>Christopher Cross, the head of research at the U.S.
Department of Education, said there shouldn't be a federal
role in regulating school testing, since education is a state
and local responsibility. He also said he wasn't sure of the
reliability of the study's estimates, noting that 127 million
tests might take more time to administer than the half-day
per year that the group estimated was being spent by each
student taking tests. But Cinthia Schuman, executive director
of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, a
Cambridge, Mass., anti-testing group, said "government
regulation is the only way we'll make the testing industry
accountable."</p>
