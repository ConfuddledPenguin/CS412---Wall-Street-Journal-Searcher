	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Philips N.V. shareholders filed two lawsuits
accusing the company of disclosing misleading information to
artificially boost its stock price before the company
reported a plunge in earnings May 3.
   The two class-action lawsuits were filed in federal court
in Manhattan. The suits allege that Philips, the Dutch
electronics giant, issued a series of false public statements
that made it appear that the company's business prospects
were promising. The suits claim that at the time of the
favorable statements, the company knew that the projections
were misleading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One of the suits claims that the allegedly misleading
statements were made as early as October 1989. The other suit
claims the company began misrepresenting its business
prospects in January 1990. The lawsuits seek unspecified
damages for the decline in the stock's value for investors
who bought Philips in recent months.</p>
<p>The suits claim that Philips led investors to believe that
sales and earnings would increase for 1990. According to the
lawsuits, the company was presenting a rosy but misleading
picture of its expected earnings as late as mid-April 1990.</p>
<p>The lawsuits say the company made no mention of problems
that might hurt its profitability until May 3, when it
reported that first-quarter operating profit fell to six
million guilders ($3.2 million), down from 223 million
guilders a year earlier. On news of the drop in earnings,
Philips common declined $2.875 to close at $17.125 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 3.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the Big Board yesterday, the stock
closed at $17.625, up 12.5 cents.</p>
