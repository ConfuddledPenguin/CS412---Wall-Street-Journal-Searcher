	<p class="article-leader">Westvaco Corp. reported fiscal second-quarter earnings
declined 21%, reflecting a slowdown in the paper industry
plus modernization work that took one of its paper machines
out of service.
   Net for the quarter ended April 30 fell to $46 million, or
71 cents a share, from $58.2 million, or 90 cents a share, in
the year-earlier period. Sales rose 3.8% to a record $583
million from $561.7 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Growth in the U.S. economy remains at only moderate
levels," said John A. Luke, president and chief executive
officer. He added that Westvaco, based in New York, took one
of its largest coated-paper machines out of operation for
most of April to modify it to make more-advanced products.
Without the effect of the modernization project, which
temporarily reduced plant capacity, second-quarter earnings
would have declined 10%.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Westvaco shares fell 50 cents to close at $26.125.</p>
