	<p class="article-leader">PARTY GETS THE BLAME</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping blamed poor party
leadership as the root cause of last year's pro-democracy
demonstrations, West German sources said.</p>
<p>The new Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, said he
couldn't rule out more such demonstrations this year, the
sources said. But a Chinese official said only police forces
would be used to quell any further unrest.</p>
<p>The comments came in talks this week with former West
German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. The sources said the
Chinese leaders were generally conciliatory toward students
in the demonstrations, which soldiers crushed in June.</p>
<p>The sources also said Mr. Schmidt exchanged letters with
former party chief Zhao Ziyang, who was purged in June for
being sympathetic to the students. It is the first time Mr.
Zhao, under house arrest in Beijing, is known to have
communicated with the outside world.</p>
<p>SPAIN DEMANDS GOLD CARD LIST</p>
<p>A Spanish appeals court ordered American Express Co. to
give the government a list of its gold card holders in Spain,
the latest twist in a drive against tax evaders. The court
rejected the company's appeal of a 1987 government request
for the list, saying the request didn't infringe on
constitutional rights to privacy. American Express officials
last night hadn't decided whether to appeal. American Express
doesn't say how many of its 270,000 members in Spain hold
gold cards, which provide extra services. There are about 35
million American Express cardholders world-wide.

<p>ROMANIA'S UNORTHODOX OFFER</p>
<p>A revolutionary group that helped topple Romanian dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu has an unorthodox offer for Communist Party
members to cover their political past. For just one lei (less
than one cent), Communists can buy a certificate saying the
holder doesn't want to be a member of the party or its youth
branch any longer. The Romanian Communist Party never
formally dissolved, but nobody claims membership anymore.
Before the revolution, there were 3.7 million Communist Party
members.</p>
<p>KOREAN FIRM VS. DU PONT</p>
<p>Korea Engineering Plastics Co. filed an anti-dumping suit
against Du Pont Co., Hoechst AG's Hoechst Celanese Corp. unit
in the U.S. and Asahi Chemical Industry Co. of Japan, the
South Korean Ministry of Finance said. Korea Engineering
claimed the foreign firms have dumped their polyacetal resin
products in South Korea since 1988. The government has six
months to investigate. South Korea's polyacetal resin market
totaled $35 million last year. Korea Engineering supplied 47%
of the demand; imports supplied the rest.</p>
<p>EAST GERMANS REDISCOVER FRUIT</p>
<p>For years, East Germany's Communist rulers neglected the
growing of fruits and vegetables; only the party elite had
regular access to citrus fruit. But while stores are finally
stocking veggies, people aren't familiar with them. So Ulrike
Hohmuth is writing a vegetarian cookbook, to address such
issues as how to tell when fruit is ripe. Because traditional
German cooking caters to meat eaters, Ms. Hohmuth has had to
borrow recipes from elsewhere, or make them up.</p>
<p>ISRAELI SUPERCOMPUTER</p>
<p>Israeli scientists are doing research on a supercomputer
system they say is more powerful than anything the U.S. has,
according to Israeli university officials. Three Israeli
institutions had applied for licenses to buy Cray Research
Inc. and International Business Machines Corp.
supercomputers, but the U.S. delayed the permits because of
concern Israel might use them to develop nuclear weapons and
missiles. Technion University is seeking funds in the U.S. to
build its own computers, and has started theoretical
research.</p>
<p>AUSTRALIAN MEDIA CURBS</p>
<p>Australia will limit aggregate foreign ownership of radio
and television companies to 20%, to prevent skirting of
existing rules. Individual foreign investors are limited to a
15% stake.</p>
<p>The toughening of foreign-ownership limits undermines
efforts by the country's three television networks to raise
funds. The TV industry had its first loss in 30 years last
fiscal year.</p>
<p>Foreign investors now have a large stake in one of the
three TV networks, but were expected to acquire stakes in the
others. Broadcasters have three years to comply with the
limits.</p>
<p>One of the three major networks, Bond Media Ltd.'s Channel
9, was negotiating for capital injections from companies
including Paramount Communications Inc. and CBS Inc. in
return for a 30% share in the Australian network.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Hong Kong Chinese executives attach more importance to
success in business than keeping their wives happy, according
to a survey of 1,000 men by Price Waterhouse Management
Consultants. The survey found a majority of businessmen
polled approved of having a mistress, and ranked impressing
their wives after impressing friends and business associates.
. . . One in six Japanese public junior high schools requires
male students to wear crew cuts, a lawyer's group survey
showed. Some respondents said crew cuts encourage good study
habits.</p>
