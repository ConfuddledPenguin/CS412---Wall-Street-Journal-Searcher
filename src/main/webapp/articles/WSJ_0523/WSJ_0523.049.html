	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Commerce Committee approved a
bill that would impose new federal limits on plaintiffs'
rights in lawsuits over injuries allegedly caused by
defective or dangerous products.
   The legislation would make it more difficult or, in some
cases, impossible for injured plaintiffs to recover monetary
punitive damages -- those assessed to punish a defendant
company, as opposed to damages that compensate a victim. The
committee voted 13-7 to approve the bill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The legislation would bar, in the absence of fraud,
punitive damages against makers of pharmaceuticals, medical
devices or aircraft if the products had received prior
federal regulatory approval. Most rules governing injury
suits are set by states, and thus may vary.</p>
<p>The Judiciary Committee is expected to consider the bill
before it goes to the Senate floor, where opponents promise a
fierce fight. A similar measure has been introduced in the
House, and the Bush administration supports such legislation.</p>
<p>For years, big business has pushed unsuccessfully for
federal product liability limits, claiming that injury suits
drive up insurance rates, inflate prices for consumer goods
and inhibit product development. In an effort to win
approval, proponents of the bill shifted their strategy by
stressing that current state product liability laws put U.S.
companies at a disadvantage when competing against foreign
counterparts.</p>
<p>Opponents of such legislation, supported by consumer
advocates and trial lawyer groups, have so far managed to
block enactment of federal product liability limits, arguing
that the restrictions would put injured individuals at an
unfair disadvantage when they sue companies. Public Citizen,
a liberal Washington advocacy organization, called the
legislation a "windfall for makers of unsafe products" and
"the most anti-consumer bill facing the U.S. Congress."</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Kasten (R., Wis.), who has sponsored such
legislation in the past, left out of this year's version
certain stringent limits on plaintiffs' rights in order to
gain broader Democratic support. Tacitly acknowledging the
modifications, Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest Hollings
(D., S.C.), the leading Senate foe of federal product
liability restrictions, agreed to allow the panel to vote on
the measure and send it to the full Senate.</p>
<p>But proponents of the legislation are expected to try to
add tougher provisions later. Perhaps the most controversial
of these is an amendment that would require a plaintiff to
prove that a corporate defendant had been negligent in making
or distributing a product. In many states, "strict liability"
laws require that a plaintiff prove only that a defendant's
product was defective or unreasonably dangerous, regardless
of whether a defendant had been negligent.</p>
