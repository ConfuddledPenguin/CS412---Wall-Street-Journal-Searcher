	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southmark Corp. said it had a narrowed net loss
of $58.5 million, or $1.22 a share, for its fiscal third
quarter ended March 31 as problems worsened at its San
Jacinto Savings Association subsidiary.
   In the third quarter last year, Southmark had a net loss
of $1.4 billion, or $23.30 a share, after more than $800
million in write-downs. Revenue for the quarter was $268.2
million, down 34% from $405.6 million last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The troubled real estate and thrift concern has proposed
reorganizing around San Jacinto, but the Houston-based
savings and loan's persisent troubles continue to raise
questions about whether such a reorganization will be
possible.</p>
<p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Southmark said that San Jacinto had a negative net worth of
$50.8 million at March 31, compared with an estimated
negative net worth of $12.1 million at Dec. 31 based on a
regulatory examination. In addition, the thrift failed to
meet new capital requirements and said it still hasn't
implemented its business plan, which calls for it to sell or
otherwise dispose of about $1 billion in assets.</p>
<p>According to Southmark's SEC filing, the thrift had losses
of $38 million in the quarter, more than the $10 million a
month in losses it had estimated it would have, and $140
million for the nine months.</p>
<p>Under an agreement between Southmark, San Jacinto and the
Office of Thrift Supervision, Southmark has agreed to
contribute $100 million more in assets to the troubled thrift
and to convert $112 million of subordinated debt into equity.
But even after that transaction, which must be completed by
mid-July, Southmark said that San Jacinto won't meet minimum
regulatory capital requirements, increasing the possibility
that federal regulators will choose to seize the thrift.</p>
<p>However, Southmark said that San Jacinto has filed an
application asking the Office of Thrift Supervision to grant
it an exception to regulatory standards or hold off sanctions
while it tries to implement its business plan.</p>
<p>For the nine months, Southmark had a net loss of $207
million, or $4.39 a share, compared with a net loss in the
year-ago period of $1.13 billion, or $25.76 a share. Revenue
was $791.5 million, down from $1.5 billion last year.</p>
