	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Economic uncertainty and surging Japanese
interest in U.S. futures markets are igniting trading in
Treasury-bond futures.
   Volume in T-bond futures has jumped more than 21% this
year at the Chicago Board of Trade as investors, daunted by
stock-market volatility and market jitters overseas, look for
safer bets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"When you have an economy that's risk-ridden, there's a
genuine flight to quality," says Jeffrey Priest, who heads
fixed-income trading for Miller, Tabak, Hirsch & Co. in New
York.</p>
<p>An average of 331,109 contracts a day are being traded in
the Board of Trade's T-bond pit, compared with a daily
average of 275,250 contracts during the first four months of
last year. A contract is for future delivery of a $100,000
face value Treasury bond. In practice, futures traders rarely
take delivery of Treasury bonds, and most trades are canceled
by making an offsetting trade. In all, 27.4 million contracts
have been traded for the period, compared with 22.5 million
contracts a year earlier.</p>
<p>Some institutional investors, worried that the economy
isn't strong enough to sustain the stock market's record
highs, are opting for bonds instead. Treasury-bond futures --
the most popular futures contracts -- are widely used to
offset the risk of bond holdings.</p>
<p>The strategy, known as hedging, works like this: An
investor who buys Treasury bonds risks losing money if
interest rates rise and the price of bonds falls. To reduce
the risk, the investor can sell bond futures on the CBOT,
essentially betting that rates will rise.</p>
<p>The investor sells T-bond futures contracts for the
prevailing price on the day of the sale. If bond prices later
decline, the price of bond futures also drops, enabling the
investor to buy back the futures for less. If bond prices
rise, the investor loses some money on the futures, but makes
more money on the bonds.</p>
<p>The economic factors prompting big investors to step up
T-bond futures trading coincide, analysts say, with the
discovery of U.S. futures and options markets by foreign
investors, particularly cash-rich Japanese.</p>
<p>Japanese securities firms, which bought memberships on the
CBOT about two years ago, are beginning to establish
themselves there. With growing success, they have been
recommending futures to their institutional clients in Tokyo.
"Our clients' use of financial futures has increased very
sharply, especially in T-bonds," says Masumi Yamaguchi,
executive vice president of Nikko Securities Co.
International in Chicago.</p>
<p>The dollar's recent declines against the yen make U.S.
bond futures a good buy for Japanese investors. And the
easing of restrictions on Japan's financial markets over the
past few years has stimulated Japanese interest in foreign
futures and options markets, including those in Chicago.</p>
<p>The presence of large investors, both Japanese and
American, is having a dynamic effect on the CBOT's T-bond
pit, an already frenzied throng of 500 screaming traders in
brightly colored jackets.</p>
<p>New money in the pit creates price volatility, and rapidly
changing prices mean opportunity for a quick profit in T-bond
futures. Traders on the top rows of the octagonal pit set the
pace, buying and selling large blocks of contracts for their
employers and large securities firms. Bottom-row "locals,"
trading for their own accounts, jostle for a piece of the
action. More and more speculators, enticed by the activity,
pour money into the pit.</p>
<p>For instance, on May 11 -- the day after the U.S. Treasury
completed its quarterly refunding of $30.5 billion in bonds
and notes -- a burst of trading hit the pit. The price of
T-bond futures, which normally fluctuates by only a few
hundred dollars a contract per day, rose $1,562.50 a
contract. More than 546,000 T-bond contracts changed hands
then, the second most active trading day in CBOT history.</p>
<p>"The overriding fear from the beginning of the year has
been that we were going into a recession," says Karen Gibbs,
an analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. "That
meant a lot of people turned to bonds," she says. Interest
rates usually fall in a recession, and bond prices rise.</p>
<p>Early this year, economic worries overseas -- particularly
in West Germany and Japan -- made U.S. bonds and bond futures
attractive to foreign investors. Now foreign bonds are
rallying world-wide, but some analysts expect interest in
U.S. T-bond futures to remain strong. They cite fears that
German reunification will spawn inflation there and doubts
that Japanese bond prices have truly stabilized.</p>
<p>And while U.S. inflationary fears have eased and the stock
market has surged, many investors still remain leery of
stocks. "Even as we were having this rally, there was a
shipment of speculative funds from the equity market into the
fixed-income market," and investors looked to hedge their
bonds with futures, says Samuel D. Kahan, senior vice
president and chief economist for Fuji Securities, Inc. in
Chicago.</p>
<p>The futures markets are drawing big investors who
previously might have shunned them, such as pension funds and
large companies. In growing numbers, financial advisers are
encouraging clients to trade T-bond futures, either as a
hedge or to control a large number of Treasury bonds for less
money than an outright purchase.</p>
<p>Pacific Investment Management Co., Newport Beach, Calif.,
a major bond manager, favors portfolios that include bond
futures. And Pacific Investment officials say they have
converted some of the firm's larger clients, such as Digital
Equipment Corp. and Kroger Co., to their thinking.</p>
<p>"We use {futures} on their own merits, because we find
that it's cheaper to buy whatever we're buying through the
futures markets," says Dean Meiling, a Pacific managing
director. "We also use them as a risk-management tool."</p>
<p>Miller Tabak's Mr. Priest tells of a client, a manager of
school trusts, who recently was converted to trading T-bond
futures. "He didn't want anything that looked like a
commodity, and T-bond futures don't," Mr. Priest says.</p>
