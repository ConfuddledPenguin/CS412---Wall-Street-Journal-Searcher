	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Harken Energy Corp. said its directors approved
a rights offering to raise more than $40 million to repay
debt, pay for capital expenditures and provide working
capital to two of the company's subsidiaries.
   Harken, an energy concern, apparently wants to raise the
funds in part to recapitalize its Harken Marketing Co. unit,
which at March 31 was in violation of certain bank covenants.
However, Harken said that Harken Marketing's bank group has
agreed to waive those covenants until July 31 if Harken and
Harken Marketing agree to make a $15 million principal
payment on its $76.3 million in bank debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under an agreement reached earlier this week, undisclosed
Harken stockholders have agreed to loan Harken Marketing $26
million, of which $15 million will be used to pay the bank
principal and the remaining amount will be used for working
capital. As part of that agreement, the stockholders will be
able to use their loan to buy shares under the rights
offerings.</p>
<p>The energy concern said that under the rights offering, it
would allow its shareholders to buy stock in Harken
Marketing, a gasoline wholesaler and retailer that had gross
profit of $9.1 million on revenue of $247 million for the
first quarter, and Tejas Power Corp., a natural gas gathering
and marketing concern that had first-quarter operating profit
of $2.5 million on revenue of about $27 million.</p>
<p>Separately, Harken Energy said it had a net loss for the
first quarter of $2.2 million, or 10 cents a share, compared
with a loss of $1.2 million, or six cents a share, last year.
Revenue increased almost 10%, to $279.7 million from $254.4
million last year.</p>
