	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The International Finance Corp., a World
Bank affiliate, and Algemene Bank Nederland signed an
agreement creating a $50 million co-financing facility for
projects in a number of Third World nations.
   Initially, the IFC and the Dutch commercial bank each will
commit $25 million for the facility, which will help finance
private business ventures in such nations as Indonesia,
Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Morocco and Turkey.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The World Bank affiliate said it will act as the lender of
record for the full amount of each loan, with ABN serving as
a 50% participant in such credits. The Dutch bank, through
its local branches and subsidiaries in developing countries,
will identify prospective borrowers, assess the feasibility
of projects and supervise them once loans are approved. Loans
will range from $3 million to $6 million.</p>
<p>"This new form of joint lending will provide much-needed
foreign currency financing for smaller projects in developing
countries where our partner ABN has a strong local presence,"
said Sir William Ryrie, the IFC's executive vice president.</p>
