	<p class="article-leader">Rhone-Poulenc S.A. said foreign exchange fluctuations
contributed to a 9.6% drop in first-quarter net profit after
payments to minority interests, to 1.37 billion francs ($245
million) from 1.52 billion francs a year earlier.
   The French pharmaceutical and chemical company said the
decline of the dollar and yen against European currencies was
particularly debilitating for its overseas income when
translated into francs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consolidated revenue grew 7.4% to 19.93 billion francs,
but the state-controlled concern noted that first-quarter
revenue was down 2.9% when recent acquisitions were excluded
from the balance sheet.</p>
