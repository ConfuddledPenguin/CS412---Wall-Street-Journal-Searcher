	<p class="article-leader">Caesars World Inc., Los Angeles, reported that earnings
for its third quarter ended April 30 declined 40% to $10.5
million, or 44 cents a share, from $17.4 million, or 70 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   Most of the decline came from Caesars' Nevada casinos,
particularly from low table-game win percentages at the Lake
Tahoe property and construction disruptions elsewhere.
Caesars' results, somewhat better than analysts had expected,
prompted a 75 cent rise, to $21.125, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday. Caesars faces major new
competitors in Atlantic City, N.J., and Las Vegas, Nev.,
which have been affecting its business in the past few
quarters.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue fell 1.7% to $217.9 million from $221.8 million.</p>
<p>For the fiscal first nine months, Caesars' net income fell
42% to $29.4 million, or $1.20 a share, from $50.5 million,
or $2.05 a share, a year earlier. Revenue declined 2.9% to
$646.6 million from $666.4 million.</p>
<p>Caesars also said it has bought back slightly more than
one million shares this year under a three million-share
buy-back authorization. It has about 24 million common shares
outstanding.</p>
