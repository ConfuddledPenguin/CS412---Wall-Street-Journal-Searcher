	<p class="article-leader">EMERYVILLE, Calif. -- Cetus Corp. said it won a round in a
patent dispute with Erbamont Inc. over a widely prescribed
anti-tumor drug that it imports.
   The biotechnology concern said a U.S. International Trade
Commission hearing officer rejected a claim by the Stamford,
Conn., affiliate of Erbamont N.V. of Italy, that Cetus is
violating Erbamont patent rights by importing the drug, known
as doxorubicin. Cetus, which has been selling a generic form
of the drug in the U.S. since last May, said the decision
"clears the way for us to continue providing a competitively
priced alternative to Erbamont's product," which is sold
under the brand name Adriamycin.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cetus said Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. has been importing and
marketing a generic version of doxorubicin, and was also
named in the trade dispute. The total U.S. market for the
drug is approximately $160 million.</p>
<p>Cetus noted that federal court litigation over possible
infringement of Erbamont's patents is still pending.</p>
<p>In Stamford, Erbamont said it "intends to continue to
fight to protect its patents from unauthorized use by others.
We are confident that the commission will support our belief
that our patent is valid and enforceable and that our
competitors' actions infringe our patent."</p>
<p>Separately, Cetus said it reached a cross-licensing
agreement with Genetics Institute Inc., of Cambridge, Mass.,
relating to a protein that is expected to be useful in
treating cancer and other diseases. Last year, the two
companies received separate patents covering aspects of what
is called macrophage-colony stimulating factor. The
royalty-free licensing accord allows the companies to
independently develop the protein.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading, Cetus closed at
$16.50 a share, up 75 cents.</p>
