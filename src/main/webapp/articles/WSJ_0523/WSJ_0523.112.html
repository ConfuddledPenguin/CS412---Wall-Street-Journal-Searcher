	<p class="article-leader">Trans World Airlines Inc., responding to a United Airlines
coupon promotion, slashed domestic round-trip fares, in some
cases by as much as 30%.
   The action, announced late yesterday, raises the ante in a
marketing war that has been brimming during the past several
days. It is also likely to put pressure on airline profits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>UAL Corp.'s United Airlines fired the first salvo Monday
when it ran newspaper ads that had coupons for $35 off the
price of round-trip fares of at least $175. The promo, a
popular industry tactic in recent years, wouldn't have
created a stir except that the ads were widespread and hit
big markets such as New York City. It essentially amounted to
a fare cut.</p>
<p>TWA and NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines swiftly responded by
announcing later Monday that they would accept United's
coupons. Other carriers said they were "studying" the
promotion. One, Texas Air Corp.'s Continental Airlines, said
it was "baffled" as to why United would issue discount
coupons during an otherwise strong travel season.</p>
<p>TWA contended that its fare cuts offered better, more
straightforward deals. "We would never have triggered this on
our own," said Robert B. Cozzi, senior vice president of
marketing at TWA. "United pulled out the gun, and they didn't
have any bullets in it. We shot out a bullet."</p>
<p>TWA said it was dropping the cheapest fares for travel
Tuesday through Thursday, considered an off-peak travel
period. Those fares are falling to $198 for flights of up to
1,500 miles and $298 for longer flights.</p>
<p>The least expensive fare between Chicago and New York is
falling to $198 from $275. The cheapest Boston-San Francisco
fare is decreasing to $298 from $428.50.</p>
<p>TWA's target market is clearly vacationers, who can afford
to buy tickets at least seven days in advance, stay over
Saturday nights and travel during the off-peak period, as is
required. United also requires seven-day advance purchases
and Saturday night stays.</p>
<p>Low fares, such as the ones TWA is offering, can cost the
airlines plenty. TWA appears to be trying to avoid potential
losses by offering the deals for a limited time only. Tickets
have to be booked by June 7. United's coupons are valid
longer, until Aug. 31. An airline spokeswoman wouldn't say,
however, how long ads containing coupons would run. The
carrier won't accept photocopies.</p>
<p>TWA's discounted fares are good for travel until Dec. 13,
the same expiration date as United's promotion.</p>
<p>The fare-cutting comes as airlines are indicating that
business is brisk. In April, United's load factor, the
percentage of seats filled, was among the highest in the
industry. Industry traffic in April grew a robust 11%.</p>
<p>Yet, consumers are suffering from a little sticker shock.
Consequently, the morning after United hit Des Moines, Iowa,
with its ad campaign, Iowa Travel Ltd. booked about twice as
many United flights as it usually does, said owner Arlene
Field. "People who were hoping fares would go down used the
coupons as the next best thing," she said.</p>
<p>Now United and other carriers are likely to match TWA's
fares. And the fare cuts could spread beyond TWA's routes.
Coupled with the coupons, that could mean more savings for
consumers -- and squeeze airline profit margins even further.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, UAL closed at $151.50, down $2.25.</p>
