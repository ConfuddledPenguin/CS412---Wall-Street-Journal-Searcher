	<p class="article-leader">MOLINE, Ill. -- Deere & Co. said that strong North
American retail sales contributed to a 10% increase in net
income for the second quarter ended April 30.
   The maker of farm and industrial equipment said net was
$144 million, or $1.90 a share, compared with the
year-earlier $130.5 million, or $1.74 per share. Sales rose
11% to $2.12 billion from $1.91 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the six-month period ended April 30, Deere's earnings
rose 24% to $222.5 million, or $2.94 a share, from $178.9
million, or $2.39 a share in the year-ago period. Sales
during the six-month period increased 14% to $3.76 billion
from $3.29 billion.</p>
<p>Deere attributed its second-quarter and year-to-date
improvements to increased sales, higher production volumes
and improved operating efficiency in the company's North
American operations. The company also noted that the
six-month results last year were adversely affected by the
manufacturing start-up costs of new combines and large
tractors.</p>
<p>"North American agricultural conditions continue to be
favorable, and our outlook for retail sales of John Deere
agricultural equipment remains positive," the company said.</p>
<p>The company said that improved moisture conditions should
stimulate demand for lawn and grounds-care equipment. Outside
the U.S. and Canada, the company said, retail sales of John
Deere farm equipment are expected to be "modestly" higher
this year.</p>
<p>Due to increased interest rates and slower construction
activity, particularly in the eastern United States and
Canada, the company said the outlook for North American
retail sales of John Deere industrial equipment has become
"cautious."</p>
<p>The company said its "overall outlook" for the remainder
of the year looks positive, but inflation and price
competition demands cost-control efforts and improved
operating efficiency.</p>
