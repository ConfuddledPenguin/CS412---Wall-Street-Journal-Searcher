	<p class="article-leader">ST. LOUIS -- The chemical units of Monsanto Co. and Exxon
Corp. agreed in principle to combine their thermoplastic
elastomers businesses, creating an independent company with
initial sales of about $100 million a year.
   The joint venture would merge St. Louis-based Monsanto's
strengths in manufacturing and marketing the rubber-like
materials with Exxon's knowledge of olefin-based raw
materials and fundamental polymer science.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We think this effort will show that one plus one is going
to equal three," said a Monsanto spokesman. "It's a chance to
grow faster than either of us could grow alone."</p>
<p>The new company, to be based in St. Louis, would have
comparable numbers of managers from New York-based Exxon and
Monsanto, but respective ownership stakes and other details
remain to be determined. Start-up is expected by year-end,
contingent upon the conclusion of negotiations and various
regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe and Latin America.</p>
<p>Thermoplastic elastomers are used widely in engineered
industrial rubber and soft plastics for automobiles,
appliances, and construction materials as well as in food
packaging and medical products. World-wide consumption of
such elastomers exceeds 600,000 metric tons a year,
representing sales of about $1.6 billion. Consumption has
been growing recently at an annual rate of about 10%,
according to industry studies.</p>
<p>Late this year, the new company is expected to introduce
two products that Monsanto has been developing. One has
high-temperature tolerance that makes it suited for
"under-the-hood" automotive uses; the other, a material with
low permeability, is intended for specialty medical
applications.</p>
