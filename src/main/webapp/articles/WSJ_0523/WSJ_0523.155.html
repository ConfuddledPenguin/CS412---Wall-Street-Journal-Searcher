	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- The Canadian dollar and Canadian bonds fell as
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's chief Quebec political
lieutenant, Lucien Bouchard, resigned over Canada's
constitutional impasse.
   Currency and bond traders said Mr. Bouchard's resignation
heightened fears about the government's ability to settle the
constitutional dispute and keep Quebec within Canada.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Canadian dollar closed in Toronto yesterday at 84.15
U.S. cents, down from 84.96 cents Monday. The Canadian unit
fell as low as 83.79 U.S. cents yesterday, but rallied in
later trading after buying support came from the Bank of
Canada.</p>
<p>Canadian bond prices were down as much as 2 3/8 points, or
C$23.75 for a bond with a C$1000 face amount, but cut part of
their loss in late trading. A 20-year bellwether government
bond closed off C$20 to yield 10.82%.</p>
<p>Michael Manford, chief economist at ScotiaMcLeod Inc.,
predicted that Canadian financial markets will remain
volatile until the constitutional uncertainties are settled.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a written comment by Treasury Under Secretary
David Mulford that the U.S. would welcome a stronger yen
under certain conditions cut short the U.S. dollar's rally
against the Japanese currency and sent the U.S. unit nearly 2
1/2 yen lower on the day.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar, however, continued its gains against the
mark amid deepening market nervousness about the eventual
cost of the Germanys' unification.</p>
<p>In late New York trading yesterday, the U.S. dollar was
quoted at 1.6736 marks, up from 1.6626 marks late Monday, and
at 151.20 yen, down from 153.72 yen late Monday. Sterling was
quoted at $1.6928, up from $1.6875 late Monday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted
at 151.65 yen, down from Tuesday's Tokyo close of 152.40 yen.</p>
<p>Canada's impasse developed over proposed constitutional
amendments that would recognize Quebec as a "distinct
society" within Canada and would extend additional powers to
the country's 10 provinces in such areas as immigration. The
amendments are opposed by three provinces, Newfoundland, New
Brunswick and Manitoba.</p>
<p>Mr. Bouchard told a news conference that he resigned
because he objected to current initiatives aimed at
overcoming the impasse by weakening the provisions of the the
proposed constitutional plan, known as the Meech Lake accord.
He said the distinct society designation was an important
"symbol" for the largely French-speaking Quebec and should be
left intact.</p>
<p>Mr. Bouchard, who was environment minister in Mr.
Mulroney's cabinet, said he didn't intend to back down from
his position. "Read our lips because we mean business," he
said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Mulroney told the House of Commons that
Quebec's constitutional demands were "reasonable." He said
Quebec "said yes" to Canada in a referendum in 1980. "Now is
the time for the rest of Canada to say yes to Quebec."</p>
<p>Mr. Mulroney, looking somber, said that current
discussions to settle the dispute haven't made much progress.
He said he wouldn't call a meeting of provincial government
leaders unless there were prospects for success. The proposed
amendments will die if they aren't ratified by all provincial
legislatures by June 23, a legal deadline.</p>
<p>Mr. Bouchard said he will remain in the House of Commons
as an independent member and will "use my newly found freedom
of speech in the best interests of Quebec and Canada." Two
other Conservative members of Parliament also announced they
will quit the party and sit as independents to promote
Quebec's interests.</p>
<p>Mr. Bouchard, a close friend of Mr. Mulroney, was
responsible for overseeing the Conservatives' political
interests in Quebec, the party's main power base. He agreed
to join Mr. Mulroney's cabinet in 1988 even though he had
campaigned in the 1980 Quebec referendum for the separation
of Quebec from Canada.</p>
<p>Bond prices and the Canadian dollar were further depressed
by a new public opinion poll that showed that a majority of
Quebecers support eventual separation of their province from
Canada.</p>
<p>Dan Gosselin, chief bond trader at Wood Gundy Inc., said
the bond price decline was the sharpest "in recent memory."
He said the selling pressure was broad and the price decline
was accentuated by an absence of buyers.</p>
<p>"Nobody is sure what would happen if Quebec decided to
separate," said George Hamilton, a senior trader of Hong Kong
Bank of Canada. "There are so many unknowns out there.
Foreign investors are just running for the hills."</p>
<p>Patrick Paridiso, a vice president of Deutsche Bank in New
York, said Canadian financial markets are in a state of
uncertainty because it is "very hard to quantify what would
happen if the constitutional accord isn't passed."</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty, Canadian share prices rose,
taking their signal from Wall Street's advance Monday.
Canadian stock exchanges were closed Monday because of a
national holiday. The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300-share
composite index rose 19.29 yesterday to close at 3540.54.</p>
<p>Stephanie Tramdack, a portfolio analyst at Levesque
Beaubien Geoffrion Inc., said the Canadian dollar's decline
also helped share prices because many Canadian companies
benefit from a lower Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery rose $2.30 to $375.60 an ounce. Estimated volume was
a heavy five million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $375.45 an
ounce.</p>
