	<p class="article-leader">NIKKEI PUT WARRANTS' potential gains in the event of a 30%
drop in the Nikkei index of 225 Tokyo stocks were understated
by 100 percentage points in a story and an accompanying table
in yesterday's edition because of a miscalculation. For
example, in the case of the Denmark put, the gain from the
May 18 level would be 148% (instead of 48%); in the case of
the newer PaineWebber put, the gain would be 242% (not 142%).
