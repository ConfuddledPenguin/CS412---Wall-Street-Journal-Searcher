	<p class="article-leader">Millicom Inc. received permission from the Federal
Communications Commission to construct a nationwide private
voice and data radio network for dispatchers.
   The network will use the 900 megahertz frequency now used
for private or Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) voice
communications. New York-based Millicom wants to combine
voice and data communications traffic on the same network.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Millicom Chairman J. Shelby Bryan said the company has no
system for actually combining voice and data communications
onto one SMR network, but is negotiating with three major
suppliers to design and build such systems. He declined to
identify the manufacturers.</p>
<p>FCC rules normally require SMR operators to construct
their networks within 12 months. Millicom received a 24-month
extension, to three years, because its network will involve
numerous major cities and will be linked to the public phone
network to carry traffic nationwide, said Richard J. Shiben,
chief of the Land, Mobile and Microwave Division of the FCC's
Private Radio Bureau.</p>
