	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A House-Senate conference approved a $4
billion fiscal 1990 spending bill that incorporates more than
$2 billion in cuts and transfers from military accounts to
help finance increased domestic appropriations and new aid to
Panama and Nicaragua.
   The action came as the House stepped back into the debate
on the long El Salvador war by signaling its support for the
withholding of substantial portions of U.S. military aid to
that country in an effort to spur both sides in the conflict
toward a settlement. The 250-163 roll call led Republicans
and the Bush administration to scuttle the underlying bill
244-171 minutes later, but behind the seesaw votes was a
clear coalition demanding conditions when fiscal 1991 aid is
debated this summer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last night's standoff only heightened the importance of
the appropriations bill reported from conference hours
before. With Congress scheduled to recess for the Memorial
Day holiday, it is the last remaining vehicle for releasing
the Panama and Nicaragua aid.</p>
<p>The $720 million in assistance for the two Central
American governments remains a major priority for the
president, and the domestic portion of the bill has grown
steadily under pressure from lawmakers and behind-the-scenes
lobbying by executive agencies.</p>
<p>More than $1.7 billion is provided to meet increased costs
for food stamps and veterans' programs, and current
appropriations for the Head Start preschool program for
low-income children would be raised 11%, or almost $166
million, in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.</p>
<p>Southern and Western states hit by recent flooding would
share in an estimated $216 million in new disaster
assistance, and lawmakers devised their own list of dire
political emergencies to win funding for everything from
their election-year mail to a $185 million down payment on a
costly new federal crime facility in the home state of Senate
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.).</p>
<p>Amid the final bargaining yesterday, proponents of
high-definition television succeeded in lifting restrictions
on $20 million in prior appropriations for Pentagon-financed
research, while in the atmosphere of defense cuts, lawmakers
maneuvered to salvage funds for Southern ammunition plants
and a new environmental center for the military in
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The domestic pressure bid up the cost of Pentagon cuts
required to stay within budget ceilings, and the
administration still faces a potentially explosive problem
because of an unresolved shortfall in military medical and
personnel accounts this year. House and Senate appropriators
had proposed shifting nearly $1.45 billion within Pentagon
accounts to address the problem, but House Armed Services
Committee Chairman Les Aspin balked yesterday at accepting
the list and demanded that more be taken first from strategic
programs.</p>
<p>The debate is colored by the politics of the current
budget negotiations, and Mr. Aspin argues that White House
Budget Director Richard Darman contributed to the personnel
shortfall by failing to protect these accounts from
Gramm-Rudman cuts, known as sequestration, last fall.</p>
<p>Modest transfers would be made from the Trident and MX
missile programs, but the Wisconsin Democrat argued that the
adjustments permit the administration to maneuver around the
very Gramm-Rudman mechanism it used against domestic programs
last year. "I want people to understand that sequestration
means pain," Mr. Aspin said.</p>
<p>Until now the fight has been confined to angry letters and
maneuvering between the Pentagon and individual lawmakers,
but Mr. Aspin's objections could force the issue into the
open when the compromise bill is taken back to the House and
Senate for final action this week. President Bush has
demanded passage of the Panama and Nicaragua aid before the
Memorial Day recess begins this week, but the Senate Armed
Services Committee leadership served notice last night that
it was prepared to ask for deeper cuts to head off the crisis
in personnel accounts this summer.</p>
<p>The $2.03 billion in reductions already incorporated in
the compromise bill are scattered among scores of Pentagon
and military construction accounts in an apparent effort to
minimize the policy impact of the budget exercise. Air Force
operations and maintenance faces a $380 million rescission,
and an estimated $258.6 million would be taken from a backlog
of Air Force procurement appropriations over recent years.
Among Navy accounts, $40.6 million would be cut from past
appropriations for procurement of the Tacit Rainbow missile
built by Northrop Corp., and Army research-and-development
accounts would be reduced by $82 million, including cuts from
armor and sensitive chemical-warfare programs.</p>
