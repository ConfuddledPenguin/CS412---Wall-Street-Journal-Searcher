	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Jonathan Kandell, a former assistant foreign
editor at The Wall Street Journal, sued Dow Jones & Co., the
newspaper's publisher, for allegedly libeling him.
   Mr. Kandell, who worked at the Journal for about two
years, says he was fired May 2 after a dispute over a Page
One article he wrote about Eastern European entrepreneurs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Journal, in its "Corrections & Amplifications" column
May 2, said that "Communist Entrepreneurs," a book by John W.
Kiser III, served in part as the basis for Mr. Kandell's
March 30 article. The correction said, "The article also
reflected substantial direct interviewing of the three
innovators by a Wall Street Journal reporter. The article
should have mentioned the book and its author."</p>
<p>In his legal complaint, filed in federal court in
Manhattan, Mr. Kandell alleged that Dow Jones libeled him in
a letter of apology it sent to Mr. Kiser.</p>
<p>Mr. Kandell alleged that Dow Jones damaged his
professional reputation and caused him to suffer future loss
of income. The lawsuit seeks compensatory damages of at least
$2.6 million and punitive damages of $10 million.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Dow Jones said, "We believe the suit is
utterly without merit, and the company intends to defend
itself vigorously."</p>
<p>Mr. Kandell's attorney, Martin Garbus, didn't return
telephone calls.</p>
