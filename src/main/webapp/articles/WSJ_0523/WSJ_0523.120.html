	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Democracy may be spreading in Eastern Europe,
but not on Wall Street.
   Playboy Enterprises is the latest company to find its way
around the corporate tradition of one share, one vote. The
Chicago publisher plans to issue three shares of nonvoting,
or B stock, for each voting A share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With a supportive nod from Shearson Lehman Hutton, Playboy
has touted its plan as a benign recapitalization that will
enable it to issue nonvoting shares without diluting Hugh
Hefner's 71% control.</p>
<p>Securities analysts accept the company line. "As a
business tool it makes sense. It doesn't matter whether the
shares vote or not," says PaineWebber's J. Kendrick Noble.</p>
<p>Others aren't so sure. Rex Sinquefield, chief investment
officer for Dimensional Fund Advisers, a big Playboy
stockholder, is rankled that Playboy's plan will be imposed
June 7 in a majority vote of all shares, including Mr.
Hefner's. "The most honorable thing to do would have been to
let the public holders decide" in a separate vote, he says.</p>
<p>As of now, the 64-year-old founder has to hang on to a
majority of the stock to keep control. But with two classes
outstanding, he or his estate could sell the nonvoting stock
-- cashing out 75% of his investment -- without changing his
71% voting control of the company. If Playboy stumbled later,
shareholders with the biggest economic stake in the company
wouldn't have the means to affect its future.</p>
<p>Some investors oppose all nonvoting stock. "You end up
with nonresponsive management," says Richard Koppes, general
counsel of the California Public Employees Retirement System.</p>
<p>In 1988, the Securities and Exchange Commission created a
barrier to issuing dual classes of stock; it prohibited stock
exchanges from listing shares of companies that "restrict or
reduce the per-share voting rights of {current} holders."
(Previously existing dual stock classes, including those of
Dow Jones, publisher of this newspaper, were allowed to
remain listed.)</p>
<p>Until recently, the 1988 rule seemed to protect the
one-share, one-vote principle. But nonvoting shares now are
on the rise.</p>
<p>Reader's Digest Association sold nonvoting shares in a
recent initial public offering and Viacom International has
an issue in the works.</p>
<p>Holders of voting stock at times have been offered
takeover premiums that weren't offered to nonvoting holders
-- as happened when Donald Trump went after Resorts
International. Playboy's plan has a feature to prevent such
tactics. Anyone buying 10% or more of its A stock would be
required to offer to buy an equal stake in the B stock, and
to pay at least as much per share.</p>
<p>Because of this clause, Shearson says, Playboy's A and B
shares should trade at about equal prices. However, the
clause isn't bullet-proof. If a raider first bought nonvoting
stock at the market price, he then could pay a premium for an
equal stake in the voting stock. Result: Holders of Playboy A
stock might receive a higher price.</p>
<p>Christie Hefner, the 37-year-old chairman and daughter of
the founder, says that, while creating dual stock "gives the
estate a vehicle for dealing with estate taxes," that wasn't
the purpose of the plan and she doesn't think her father is
likely to sell. "The notion that he would cash out and then
allow the value of the asset to decline isn't a real issue.
Hefner "doesn't have those intentions."</p>
<p>Creating nonvoting shares, she notes, won't increase her
father's control or give him additional rights. Playboy's
intent, she adds, was to give management "the most
flexibility."</p>
<p>Playboy hasn't issued stock in the past because Mr. Hefner
has been unwilling to dilute his control. Ms. Hefner wants
the freedom to do so -- first, for use in management options,
and later, perhaps, for use in acquisitions. As it stands
now, Ms. Hefner says she has the burden of managing a public
company without having its chief benefit -- access to public
markets to sell additional shares.</p>
<p>Few doubt that Ms. Hefner's intentions are honorable.
Since taking the helm in 1988, she has refocused Playboy
Enterprises on publishing, licensing and video; profit this
year is up.</p>
<p>"Reading between the lines, there is a tension" between
Ms. Hefner's needs as a manager and her father's desire to
retain control, Mr. Sinquefield says.</p>
<p>Ms. Hefner says that she doesn't expect the issue to be
controversial. Then why not let minority holders vote on it
-- separately? The founder's vote should count, too, she
says. "I'm sort of a believer in one share, one vote."</p>
