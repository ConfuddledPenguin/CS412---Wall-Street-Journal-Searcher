	<p class="article-leader">K mart Corp. shareholders bucked directors' wishes and
approved a proposal that seeks to have the company submit a
1988 "poison pill" rights plan to a binding stockholder vote.
   The proposal had been introduced by the State of Wisconsin
Investment Board, and it marked the second victory for the
big institutional holder this month. Last week, Champion
International Corp. holders approved a similar proposal
introduced by the investment board, which manages about $423
billion on behalf of state teachers and other employees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Such shareholder resolutions impose no legal obligation on
K mart's board. A spokeswoman for the Troy, Mich., retailer
said "the board will take up the matter for review in the
near future," and subsequently "make a recommendation as to
whether they will put it forward for a vote."</p>
<p>The Wisconsin institutional holder, among the top 10
employee investment boards, controls 2.9 million of K mart's
199.7 million shares, and it also has a substantial Champion
holding. The investment panel offered similar measures at
Pfizer Inc. and United Technologies Corp. this spring, but
lost with votes of about 38% and 41% respectively, an
official said.</p>
<p>The investment board has campaigned since 1986 against
what it sees as the improperly unilateral means by which
poison-pill anti-takeover measures are put in place, as
opposed to other measures that require shareholder approval.</p>
<p>Poison-pill measures are designed to deter hostile
takeovers by making them prohibitively expensive, typically
by allowing current shareholders to buy more stock of their
corporation at a large discount if a hostile bidder acquires
more than a specified percentage of the company's stock.
Supporters of poison pills contend that their adoption forces
bidders to negotiate with a corporation's directors, allowing
the board to better pursue the company's longterm interests.
But critics contend that they can be used to entrench
management, at the expense of stockholders who might
otherwise have received top-dollar bids for their holdings.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin investment board argued in its proxy
materials that poison-pill measures "so significantly affect
shareholder interests that shareholders should vote on such
plans."</p>
<p>Jacqueline Doeler, the investment board's investment
services manager, said "We aren't saying shareholder-rights
plans are good or bad." Rather, she said, "our concern is the
process of how they are adopted," exclusive of shareholder
input. Ms. Doeler pointed out that other anti-takeover
measures, such as staggered terms for directors or provisions
addressing two-tier price offers, typically require advance
approval by shareholders.</p>
<p>In its rebuttal to the resolution, K mart's board said it
considered the "proponent's view that plans such as the
company's rights plan deter legitimate acquisition proposals
and result in decreased stock values" before it adopted the
plan; the board concluded then, it said, that "such arguments
were speculative, at best, and did not outweigh the potential
benefits to stockholders" such plans afford.</p>
