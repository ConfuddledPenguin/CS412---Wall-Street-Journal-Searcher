	<p class="article-leader">Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan became Environmentalist
Enemy Number One this month when he suggested Congress
rethink the 1973 Endangered Species Act. He says the law
needlessly prohibits any development whenever it could damage
an endangered animal, even if it is found in other areas and
is only one of dozens of subspecies.
   Secretary Lujan quickly retreated under a firestorm of
criticism, and says he won't press for changes in the law.
However, he remains "very frustrated" by the species law's
byzantine requirements. This month he was told that the
Animas-La Plata water project in Colorado couldn't be built
because it would threaten endangered squawfish. The $582
million project would provide water for four Indian tribes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Lujan says the law allows no provision for the
hardships it imposes on the Indians. He also notes that
squawfish are found in many other areas. In Oregon, they are
predators that account for the loss of millions of migrating
steelhead and salmon smolts. To control the losses, state and
federal biologists there have just begun paying fishermen $1
for every squawfish they catch. Is the squawfish perhaps more
endangering than endangered?</p>
<p>The straitjacket rules of the Endangered Species Act are
also at the center of a holy war on Arizona's Mount Graham.
The University of Arizona, the Smithsonian Institution and
the Vatican Observatory hope to build a world-class $200
million observatory on the summit. It would put the U.S. in
the forefront of astrophysics.</p>
<p>But the area is also home to the last known examples of
the Mount Graham red squirrel. Until word of the telescope
project, environmentalists largely ignored the red squirrel;
it is only one of 25 subspecies of red squirrel, which is
common in the West.</p>
<p>Moreover, no one has shown persuasively that the project
would harm the squirrel, which has survived heavy logging on
the mountain, along with the presence of campers and
fishermen. Telescope backers promise to reforest the logged
areas and create a 1,700-acre refuge that would be off-limits
to humans. The observatory would take up only 26 acres.</p>
<p>None of this satisfies environmental extremists who are
masters at manipulating the Endangered Species Act -- not
merely to protect animals, but to block any and all
development. A dead squirrel has been sent to the project's
director, and the University of Arizona has been vandalized.
One pro-telescope biologist has received a death threat in
the mail.</p>
<p>The Rev. George Coyne, director of the Vatican
Observatory, believes that if some of his environmentalist
foes had been "present at the creation of the world, they
would have said to God, `OK, stop now. You've got all the
birds. Don't create man, because he's going to mess it all
up.'"</p>
<p>Rather than retreat, Mr. Lujan should ask that the
Endangered Species Law be amended so that factors such as job
losses and social costs are considered. The law shouldn't
make absolute protection a form of worship if the same
animals are found elsewhere, have many subspecies or can be
relocated. Speaking Monday in Portland, Oregon, on the
dispute over saving the spotted owl's habitat while putting
loggers out of work, President Bush said, "Common sense tells
us to find a needed balance." Mr. Bush's call for "balance"
is an important element that has been missing for too long
from the way this country thinks about the human species'
place in the environment.</p>
