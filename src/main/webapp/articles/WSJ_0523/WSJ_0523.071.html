	<p class="article-leader">Ivan F. Boesky, whose cooperation led to the government's
sweeping insider-trading investigation, finally made his
debut as a witness yesterday, testifying that he made illegal
arrangements to sell securities to John A. Mulheren Jr.
   Mr. Boesky avoided making eye contact with Mr. Mulheren
and seemed impatient and sometimes even angered by ques-
tions asked of him by assistant U.S. Attorney E. Scott
Gilbert and Mr. Mulheren's lawyer, Thomas Puccio. Mr. Boesky,
once Wall Street's best-known stock speculator, was
cooperating with the government as part of his 1986
insider-trading plea agreement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Neatly dressed in a dark grey suit and white shirt, Mr.
Boesky appeared gaunt and older than his 53 years. Shortly
before his release from prison earlier this year, Mr. Boesky
was photographed with long grey hair and a beard. But
yesterday, his hair was cropped short and he was
clean-shaven.</p>
<p>Under direct examination by Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Boesky told
of receiving inside information on various stock transactions
from investment bankers Dennis Levine and Martin Siegel, both
of whom have pleaded guilty to felonies relating to
securities fraud. Mr. Boesky, who spoke of agreeing to pay
for this information, said he often gave that information to
Mr. Mulheren in 1985, although he said Mr. Mulheren never had
"knowledge of my source." Nor did Mr. Boesky ever tell Mr.
Mulheren that his information was obtained illegally, Mr.
Boesky testified.</p>
<p>Based on the inside information Mr. Boesky provided him,
Mr. Mulheren bought stocks in companies that were takeover
targets, Mr. Boesky said. Mr. Boesky said he also advised Mr.
Mulheren when to sell stock. Mr. Boesky said he illegally
sold stock in Unocal Corp. to Mr. Mulheren to evade taxes and
later illegally agreed to buy back the shares and cover Mr.
Mulheren for any losses his securities firm might suffer on
the stock.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulheren is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy,
securities and mail fraud and keeping false records. He is
not charged with insider trading. The charges, brought
against Mr. Mulheren last year, were based largely on
information provided by Mr. Boesky.</p>
<p>Mr. Boesky, who spoke in a firm voice, said he was once a
close friend of the 40-year-old Mr. Mulheren, whom he has
known for about a decade. Mr. Mulheren once served as
co-trustee of the trust Mr. Boesky established for his
children. But after Mr. Boesky agreed to plead guilty in 1986
to a single felony count and to pay $100 million in fines and
cooperate with the government, he implicated Mr. Mulheren.
Mr. Boesky was recently released from prison after serving
most of a three-year term.</p>
<p>In response to questions from Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Boesky said
he is currently employed as a consultant to a company, which
he didn't identify. Mr. Boesky said he advises that company
on "different sorts of business planning that the company is
undertaking."</p>
<p>At times, Mr. Boesky seemed to want to take charge of the
questioning. When a juror complained that she couldn't hear
Mr. Boesky, he instructed Mr. Gilbert to repeat the question,
a task usually undertaken by the judge.</p>
<p>When asked by Mr. Puccio about certain records kept by his
brokerage firm, Seemala Corp., Mr. Boesky refused to answer
questions. "When were these records kept?" Mr. Puccio
inquired. "You'd have to ask the keeper," Mr. Boesky
responded. "Were these records retained by your company?" Mr.
Puccio asked. "You'd have to talk to the retainer about
that," Mr. Boesky said.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Mulheren described Mr. Boesky's
testimony yesterday as "pretty boring." He said: "When you
hear my testimony, you'll realize he wasn't much of a
friend." But Mr. Mulheren said that if Mr. Boesky's
performance as a government witness doesn't improve, Mr.
Mulheren may not have to testify at all.</p>
<p>Mr. Boesky testified that his securities firm, Seemala,
violated the net capital requirements of the New York Stock
Exchange by having too little capital between June and
October of 1985. But Mr. Boesky said he never worried much
about the violations because he always believed that his
accountants were underestimating the firm's capital position,
a practice referred to by Boesky employees as the "fudge
factor."</p>
<p>Mr. Boesky said that Stephen Conway, the president of his
holding company, warned in a June 1985 memo that Mr. Boesky
was "on a self-destruct course." Mr. Boesky said Mr. Conway
told him he was seriously below capital requirements and that
his business strategy was "reckless."</p>
<p>The net capital violations are important because the
government has alleged that Mr. Mulheren manipulated the
price of Gulf & Western Inc. shares and "parked" stock for
Mr. Boesky to help Mr. Boesky defeat net capital
requirements. Parking occurs when an investor sells
securities with the understanding that they will be
repurchased, usually at a prearranged time and price.</p>
<p>Mr. Boesky's cooperation with the government has led to
guilty pleas by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., former Drexel
junk bond wizard Michael Milken, Mr. Siegel, a former
investment banker at Kidder Peabody & Co. and Boyd Jefferies,
former chairman of Jefferies Group Inc., among others. Mr.
Mulheren is the only individual implicated by Mr. Boesky who
has chosen to fight the charges against him in court.</p>

<p>VERMONT CAN'T FORCE appointed judges to retire at age 70,
court rules.</p>
<p>The U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals said appointed
judges, like most other employees, are protected under
federal age-discrimination law. The appeals court panel
rejected Vermont's arguments that the judges were "appointees
on the policy-making level" and thus exempted from the law.
The court also rejected Vermont's claims that the
age-discrimination law violated constitutional protection of
state sovereignty.</p>
<p>The appeals court said, "We conclude that the language and
structure of the definition of `employee' {in the
age-discrimination law} suggest that Congress meant the
policy-maker category to comprise only policy makers working
closely with the elected official."</p>
<p>The decision, however, is at odds with rulings in similar
cases by two other federal appeals courts, each of which
found that Congress intended for appointed judges not to be
covered by the law.</p>
<p>William B. Gray, an attorney for the state of Vermont,
said a decision on whether to seek U.S. Supreme Court review
of the decision probably won't be made for several weeks.</p>

<p>LITERARY AGENCY is formed by Boston law firm.</p>
<p>The Palmer & Dodge Agency will review manuscripts, provide
editorial help, and negotiate contracts for authors and
writers, says Ronald Kessel, managing partner of 150-lawyer
Palmer & Dodge.</p>
<p>Since the early 1980s, many law firms have opened
non-legal affiliates in such areas as consulting, public
relations and real estate. But this is believed to be the
first time that an established law firm has opened its own
literary agency.</p>
<p>The agency's director is John Taylor Williams, a Palmer &
Dodge partner who co-authored a book about publishing law.
Its managing director is Jill Kneerim, a former editor and
publisher who is not an attorney.</p>
<p>The agency has signed up more than a dozen clients,
including former New England Patriots football player Brian
Holloway, who is writing a book about child rearing, and
adventurer Rory Nugent.</p>

<p>CAREER MOVES: Charles A. Shanor, general counsel of the
U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, will join the
Los Angeles law firm of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky and Walker,
which has more than 400 lawyers. Mr. Shanor will work in the
law firm's 36-lawyer Washington office in an "of counsel"
capacity, specializing in labor and employment issues. . . .
Noah H. Huffstetler III, a health-care attorney, joined the
Winston-Salem, N.C., law firm of Petree Stockton & Robinson
as a partner in its Raleigh office. Mr. Huffstetler, 39 years
old, was formerly a partner at the firm of Moore & Van Allen
in Raleigh, N.C. He is the primary outside counsel for the
North Carolina Hospital Association.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>LONDON-BOUND: Piper & Marbury said it plans to open a
London office in June to serve clients with investments and
businesses in Europe. George P. Stamas, a partner in the
Baltimore firm's corporate and securities department, will
coordinate the office, which initially will have one
full-time resident lawyer.</p>
