	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Energy Secretary James Watkins confirmed
reports that the Energy Department is weighing an offer to
buy uranium-enrichment services from the Soviet government.
   Speaking to reporters after giving a speech to a
nuclear-industry group here, Adm. Watkins broke his agency's
official silence on the offer, saying it was being considered
"very informally" and with the approval of the State
Department. "They {the Soviets} have a cash-flow problem and
we're sympathetic," he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nuclear-industry officials estimate that a deal between
Energy Department and the Soviet Ministry of Atomic Energy
and Industry could generate as much as $200 million a year
that, under one version of the proposal, would be spent by
the Soviet Union on goods and services in the U.S.</p>
<p>In the past, the department has exercised a near-monopoly
on uranium-enrichment services, which consists of increasing
the percentage of the unstable U-235 isotope that is found in
natural uranium. But the Soviet Union, using more modern
equipment, is able to sharply undercut the U.S. price for
such services, in some cases charging about half of the
Energy Department price.</p>
<p>One result is that the department has begun losing some of
its major customers among U.S. utilities to the spot market
for uranium-enrichment services, which is dominated by the
Soviet marketing agency V/O Techsnabexport, part of the
Soviet Ministry of Atomic Energy and Industry.</p>
<p>Although some people in the industry said they expect the
announcement of a deal as early as next week's summit in
Washington, Adm. Watkins said he is still studying the
political and economic aspects of such a trade. He pointed
out that he wouldn't approve it if it turned out to be a
political obstacle to efforts to develop more modern,
privately run enrichment plants in the U.S.</p>
