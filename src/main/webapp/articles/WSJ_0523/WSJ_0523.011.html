	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- National Broadcasting Co.'s Consumer News and
Business Channel, struggling to gain acceptance in an
overcrowded field of programming choices, will begin offering
cable operators a cash incentive to carry its service.
   At the National Cable Television Association conference
here, CNBC said it will pay $3 a subscriber to cable
operators who commit 75% of their subscriber base to carry
the 24-hour channel by July 1, 1991. The deal is being
offered until August 15.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CNBC's unusual move comes as the overpopulated cable field
is becoming even more cramped. A number of other new "basic
services," which are offered as part of the standard
programming package on a cable subscriber's bill, are vying
here for the attention of cable operators.</p>
<p>Although the newcomers are optimistic about the chances
for acceptance, there's a shortage of channel capacity in the
cable industry at present, and some cable operators are
putting expansion plans on hold until the industry has a
better idea of what new regulations Congress may slap on the
industry. Even the industry's most powerful players are
having a tough time: Time Warner Inc.'s Comedy Channel and
Viacom Inc.'s Ha] Channel are discussing a merger because of
the difficulty in selling cable operators on the idea of two
comedy networks.</p>
<p>Among the new channels being hawked at the cable
convention are the Career Television Network, or CTVN, which
will program tips on how to find jobs; the Cowboy Channel,
which boasts singer Willie Nelson as its chairman; and the
Golden American Network, which is targeted at older viewers
and plans shows such as "Satellite Bingo" and a "Dating Game"
for people over 50 years old.</p>
<p>There is also a "How-To" channel, as well as "Sci-Fi,"
which hopes to get off the ground by year end. Add to that
two channels programming legal shows and headline grabbing
trials.</p>
<p>Each programmer hopes to launch with at least five million
subscribers. That's a far cry from the most recent successful
launch, Turner Network Television, from Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. The 24-hour channel, which features films and
made-for-TV movies, began Oct. 3, 1988, with approximately 17
million subscribers and now boasts 45 million.</p>
<p>Thomas Rogers, president of CNBC, said the service,
launched last August, has 16 million subscribers, a level
that he characterized as "way ahead of schedule." Mr. Rogers
said the payment to cable operators, which he labeled as a
"marketing incentive plan," was being done to "accelerate
distribution." NBC's partner in CNBC is Cablevision Systems
Corp., an owner of cable systems and cable program networks.
NBC is a unit of General Electric Co.</p>
<p>CNBC's primary competitor, Financial News Network, which
has been on the air since November 1981, has 33.5 million
subscibers, said Gil Faccio, FNN senior vice president of
affiliate relations. Mr. Faccio said the service has no plans
to pay cable operators for subscribers. "We believe our
product should be product-motivated, not financially
motivated," he said.</p>
<p>While the major broadcast networks pay TV stations to be
affiliates and to carry network programs, it's usually the
cable operators who pay programming suppliers for the right
to carry a channel in the cable industry. Such payments are
determined by the number of subscribers a cable system has.
Only rarely has a cable channel paid cable operators for
space on their system.</p>
<p>For example, American Broadcasting Co., prior to its
acquisition by Capital Cities Communications Inc., and
Westinghouse Electric Co.'s Group W unit paid cable operators
six years ago to carry Satellite News Channel, an attempt to
compete in the all-news arena with Turner's Cable News
Network. The Satellite News Channel was unable to compete
effectively with CNN, which eventually bought it out and
folded it.</p>
<p>Mr. Rogers dismissed the charge that CNBC was desperate to
sign on cable operators. "This shows the confidence our
owners have in the service," he said, sitting in an elaborate
CNBC booth on the convention floor. "This shows we're here to
stay."</p>
