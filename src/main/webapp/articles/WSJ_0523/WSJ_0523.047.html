	<p class="article-leader">BETHESDA, Md. -- At a table in a packed banquet room, a
blind man adjusts his tie. At another, a female dwarf sits
with hands folded. Their attention is focused on a bearded
man in a wheelchair behind a dais covered in white linen.
   "What do we want?" he shouts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"A-D-A" roars back the audience, clamoring for
congressional approval of the Americans With Disabilities
Act.</p>
<p>"When do we want it?"</p>
<p>"NOW]"</p>
<p>The scene, at a dinner held last week by the National
Council on Independent Living, demonstrates a new political
restlessness by an interest group not recently known for its
clout: the disabled. And now, with the disabilities bill all
but signed into law, the disabled community intends to carry
its fervor into the workplace, using new legal tools to win
access to jobs.</p>
<p>Numbering 43 million and covering a variety of mental and
physical impairments, the disabled community is large and
diverse. Its interests often fragmented by a multitude of
state and federal programs serving each subgroup -- one
program here for the blind, another there for the deaf -- the
movement had little occasion in the past to unite. The new
law, though, is changing that, galvanizing this diverse
community into a more potent force.</p>
<p>The law will give the disabled a weapon to step up the
fight for access to public places, a campaign that activists
have waged since the early 1970s. Increasingly, though,
activists are setting their sights on a more ambitious goal:
employment.</p>
<p>"A tremendous percentage of people with disabilities
really want to work, and they have skills to work," says Paul
Marchand, chairman of the Consortium for Citizens With
Disabilities, a Washington-based coalition that represents
more than 70 organizations. Mr. Marchand cites McDonald's
Corp. and Du Pont Co. as two "islands of excellence" when it
comes to recruiting and hiring the disabled.</p>
<p>Among those with poor hiring records: the U.S. Postal
Service, which, according to John Wodatch, deputy section
chief in the Justice Department's civil-rights division, has
been the target of repeated complaints under the less
sweeping laws that currently protect the disabled. A Postal
Service spokesman points out that 36,000 of the service's
750,000 employees are disabled and asserts, "When you're as
big as we are . . . you would probably be a leading target
for almost any kind of litigation."</p>
<p>Disability-rights activists compare the progress of their
movement to American blacks' struggle for equality. First
came the push to integrate the schools, "mainstreaming," in
the jargon of the disabled movement. "If you can't get people
educated, you can't get them jobs," explains Pat Wright of
the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund.</p>
<p>Next comes the desegregation of public facilities. "You've
got to be able to get into the buildings to work," says Ralph
Neas, executive director of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights.</p>
<p>Then comes employment. Two-thirds of working-age disabled
people are unemployed, according to the President's Committee
for Employment of People With Disabilities. Most of them
depend on various forms of public assistance. "We're the
poorest single group" in the U.S., says Mary Lou Breslin, a
wheelchair user who is executive director of the San
Francisco-based Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund.</p>
<p>Under the bill, employment discrimination against the
disabled is akin to discrimination on the basis of race or
sex -- and employers who systematically refuse to hire the
disabled can be taken to court. Disabled-rights activists,
downplaying prospects of an eruption of lawsuits, insist that
many such conflicts will be settled through negotiation. When
pressed, however, they concede that conflicts will often end
up in court. Says Ms. Breslin: "Litigation is inevitable."
Business groups that fought against passage of the
disabilities bill didn't produce any studies showing how much
litigation was generated by the bill's precursor, Sections
503 and 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which outlawed
discrimination against the disabled by government contractors
and other recipients of federal funds. An informal survey
conducted last fall by the Senate subcommittee on disability
policy found there were fewer than 400 such employee lawsuits
in the previous 16 years.</p>
<p>"I'm not aware of a tremendous number of disabled cases
out there," acknowledges Edward Potter, president of the
National Foundation for the Study of Employment Policy, a
pro-business research group. But the previous law had "very
limited applicability to the private sector," he argues, and
didn't provide nearly as much access to the courts as the new
bill.</p>
<p>Under the earlier law, disabled individuals who worked for
federal contractors could seek redress from the Labor
Department, which in turn could sue the company on the
person's behalf. The new bill not only expands liability to
virtually all private employers, but also permits individuals
seeking redress to sue on their own.</p>
<p>Business groups fear the stakes in such litigation will be
considerable. The disability bill provides victims with
whatever remedies may be established in a civil-rights bill
that is now separately pending before Congress. Factoring
that in, Mr. Potter estimates the disability bill could
generate more than $3 billion annually in damages and court
costs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the disabled are plotting several moves ahead
to a battle for health insurance. Because insurance is
regulated by the states, the disability bill leaves
unanswered the question of how newly employed workers with
disabilities, no longer eligible for Medicaid and other
federal assistance programs, would pay for the additional
health insurance that their disabilities require.</p>
<p>Health insurance is "an area of great concern" to the
disabled, says Douglas Martin, a special assistant to the
chancellor for disabilities issues at the University of
California at Los Angeles. Mr. Martin, who uses a wheelchair
because of a childhood bout with polio, says that because of
health-insurance costs, he was unable to take a job as an
urban planner after receiving a Ph.D. in urban studies.</p>
<p>"That's when I decided there must be a better way," says
Mr. Martin, who, perhaps emboldened by the high spirits in
the Bethesda banquet room, says the ultimate solution is
national health insurance.</p>
