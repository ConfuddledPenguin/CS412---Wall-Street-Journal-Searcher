	<p class="article-leader">TCS Enterprises Inc. said it anticipates "substantially"
lower earnings for the near future.
   In a statement, Tom C. Stickel, TCS chairman and chief
executive officer, said the San Diego financial services
company will report earnings for its fiscal second quarter
that ended April 30 in a few weeks. Mr. Stickel couldn't
immediately be reached to comment on the reasons for the
expected earnings decline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1989's second quarter, TCS had net income of $538,000,
or 17 cents a share, on $3.8 million of revenue.</p>
<p>TCS also said it negotiated the purchase of 578,000 of its
shares held by the Resolution Trust Corp. for $867,000, or
$1.50 a share, and announced plans to buy more of its stock
in the open market.</p>
<p>The RTC acquired the TCS shares when it took over Lincoln

three million shares outstanding prior to the repurchase.</p>
