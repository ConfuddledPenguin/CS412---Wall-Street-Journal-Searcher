	<p class="article-leader">His judicial chambers are just over the hills from
Hollywood in Pasadena, but whatever the inspiration, Judge
Alex Kozinski found a way to grab the attention of antitrust
paranoids. He managed to weave the names of more than 200
movies into his court opinion declaring the innocence of a
movie-theater operator accused of being a dirty rotten
monopolist.
   Judge Kozinski deserves a special-category Oscar for the
style and substance of U.S. v. Syufy Enterprises. His 25-page
opinion, issued May 9, is a witty reminder that even the
free-market antitrust revolutionaries of the Reagan Justice
Department committed abusive prosecutions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To be fair, if we're going to have government review of
mergers it's not surprising that the business strategy of
Raymond Syufy sounded alarm bells. Mr. Syufy, who owns
several hundred movie theaters in the West, decided to enter
the Las Vegas market in 1981. He was a fierce competitor,
driving up bids to distributors for the rights to show top
films. By 1984, three competitors, including national chains
Mann and Plitt, sold out to Mr. Syufy, leaving only a small
competitor.</p>
<p>In a complaint signed by then-antitrust chief Douglas
Ginsburg, now a federal appeals-court judge, Justice accused
Mr. Syufy of monopoly by gobbling up competitors. But a funny
thing had happened by the time the case reached the courts.</p>
<p>Syufy may well have intended to become a monopolist, but
only results count. Syufy itself provided the best evidence
that there was no barrier preventing competitors from
entering the market. When Syufy cornered the first-run
market, it apparently tested its new market power by reneging
on a deal with Orion distributors. Orion responded by suing,
cutting off all Syufy theaters nationwide and giving
first-run films to the remaining Las Vegas competitor.
Quickly, Syufy's "utopia proved to be only a mirage," Judge
Kozinski wrote.</p>
<p>(Lawyers will probably read this case as much for movie
spotting as for its holding. A footnote hints there are 204
film titles secreted in the text, but I could find only 31.
Journal movie reviewer Julie Salamon, armed with her law
degree, managed to find 70 movies including the obscure
Static, The Gate and Avalanche. Try your luck with the
excerpts nearby, with the consolation that Judge Kozinski
says he's been a buff since he learned about America through
movies while growing up in Romania.)</p>
<p>Syufy went from locking up rights to more than 90% of the
first-run movies in 1985 to less than 40% by 1988. Judge
Kozinski wrote that the competing theater owner "evolved from
absolute beginners, barely staying alive, into a big
business." Within two years, the competitor had more screens
than Syufy. "Syufy's acquisitions did not short circuit the
operation of the natural market forces."</p>
<p>Judge Kozinski rejected the idea that Syufy somehow broke
any law by knocking the other theater operators out of
business by tough competition. He cited a classic judicial
opinion of this big-is-bad school, Judge Learned Hand's
opinion demanding the breakup of Alcoa in 1945 because it had
become too efficient. Alcoa's success may be "evidence of the
skill, energy and initiative with which it has always
conducted its business," Judge Hand wrote, "but we can think
of no more effective exclusion than progressively to embrace
each new opportunity as it opened. . . ."</p>
<p>Competing too well has now been decriminalized by several
Supreme Court cases interpreting the vague antitrust laws. As
Judge Kozinski noted, "While the successful competitor should
not be raised above the law, neither should he be held down
by law." Indeed, if Justice had followed its own merger
guidelines there probably would have been no case. Its test
is whether a new competitor is likely to enter the market
within two years. Even if a firm has a huge market share,
there is no violation of the Sherman Act if there's no power
to exclude competitors; there's no Clayton Act problem where
there are no barriers to entry for competitors.</p>
<p>This case earned the ultimate insult a court can give
government lawyers -- it was a waste of time. Judge Kozinski,
appointed by President Reagan in 1985, wrote that "It is a
tribute to the state of competition in America that the
Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice has found no
worthier target than this paper tiger on which to expend
taxpayer resources."</p>
<p>Indeed, if there is any barrier to competition it may be
this kind of government-instigated litigation. "Regulation
often helps entrench existing businesses by placing new
entrants at a competitive disadvantage," Judge Kozinski
wrote. "It is perhaps less well appreciated that litigation
itself can be a form of regulation; lawsuits brought by the
government impose significant costs." He said that "for
competitors in a free market to fear buying each other lest
they be hit with the expense and misery of an antitrust
enforcement action amounts to a burden only slightly less
palpable than a direct governmental prohibition against such
a purchase."</p>
<p>This prosecution means it's still what Judge Kozinski
might call high noon for the free-market revolution in
antitrust law. Monopoly seems impossible without some barrier
to entry created by the government, such as limiting landing
slots at airports or granting utility monopolies. Indeed, the
lesson of the Syufy case is that overenforcement may be the
greater sin.</p>
<p>How about a new approach? Why not require Justice first to
find some evidence that there is a government barrier to
competitors entering a market. Only if some government
interference is found should regulators or prosecutors even
begin to consider bringing an antitrust case.</p>
<p>There is no reason to go back to the days of bureaucrats
mandating the "correct" size of firms. Give the last word to
Judge Kozinski, with supporting roles by Ayn Rand and Gary
Cooper: "Personal initiative, not government control, is the
fountainhead of progress in a capitalist economy."</p>

<p>Federal judge Alex Kozinski inserted the names of 204
films into his opinion in favor of a movie theater operator.
Treat yourself to popcorn if you can find 10 or more titles
in these excerpts:</p>
<p>"unlike centrally planned economies, where decisions about
production and allocation are made by government bureaucrats
who ostensibly see the big picture and know to do the right
thing, capitalism relies on decentralized planning."</p>
<p>"The antitrust laws do not require that rivals compete in
a dead heat, only that neither is unfairly kept from doing
his personal best."</p>
<p>"Syufy always treated moviegoers fairly: The movie
tickets, popcorn, nuts and the seven-ups cost about the same
in Las Vegas as in other, comparable markets."</p>
<p>"Support is missing in the record for the Justice
Department's theory of a shakedown by a ruthless predator."</p>
<p>Movie titles: The Big Picture, Big, Do The Right Thing,
Dead Heat, Personal Best, Always, Popcorn, Nuts, The
Seven-Ups, Missing, Shakedown, Ruthless and Predator.</p>
