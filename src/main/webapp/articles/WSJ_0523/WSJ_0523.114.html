	<p class="article-leader">Church Avenue is a bustling commercial street in the
Flatbush section of Brooklyn. Last Saturday, it was crowded
with shoppers and sidewalk vendors, most of whom are
Caribbean immigrants. The street is cheerful, vibrant and
colorful. That is, until one reaches the block where police
barricades have cordoned off two Korean fruit markets that
have been the object of a boycott since mid-January.
Suddenly, the mood turns ominous.
   I went shopping on Church Avenue last weekend with a
friend. We wanted to see for ourselves the confrontation that
presented New York's Mayor David Dinkins with his first
crisis in office.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to press accounts, the dispute began when a
Haitian customer had an altercation with the owner of the Red
Apple market. The participants give different accounts of the
dispute's origin: either the customer refused to pay the full
amount for her purchases, and hostile words were exchanged;
or the shop's owner insulted and struck the customer. The
patron is suing for $6 million.</p>
<p>Whatever happened should be and presumably will be
resolved by the legal system. Meanwhile, Robert "Sonny"
Carson, a well-known figure in racial disputes in Brooklyn,
has led a movement to close down both the Red Apple and
another Korean-owned fruit market across the street, the
Church Avenue Fruit Market. Mr. Carson, who once was
convicted of kidnapping and is notorious in the city for his
anti-Semitic and anti-white views, claims these merchants do
not respect blacks and has determined to put them out of
business.</p>
<p>On the day that I visited the Red Apple, the block was
lined with police barricades, and the store was guarded by
dozens of New York City police officers in riot gear. About
50 demonstrators stood behind the barricades about eight feet
from the store, shouting at passers-by not to enter. The
lawyer for the fruit markets had obtained a restraining order
requiring the demonstrators to stay 50 feet from the stores,
but the demonstrators have ignored it and the police have
refused to enforce it.</p>
<p>At the street corner, several yards from the Red Apple, a
large booth with a loudspeaker system bombards passers-by
with recorded invective against whites, "Uncle Tom
preachers," the power structure, and a variety of other
enemies. The booth is festooned with black nationalist
paraphernalia. The atmosphere is surreal, like a carnival
where people are enjoying themselves by being enraged.</p>
<p>Thus, entering the store is like running a gantlet. Not
many people have been willing to do so. The Guardian Angels
have shopped there, and a black high-school teacher brought
his class one day. But the teacher has since asked for a
transfer from his school as a result of pressure by some
parents and fear for his safety.</p>
<p>Once inside, we found half a dozen Korean men and women
sitting quietly and dejectedly. The displays were filled with
fresh fruits and vegetables, but we were the only customers.
There was an eerie silence and a mood of grim determination.</p>
<p>Only one of the Koreans, a young man, spoke English. We
expressed our support, and he thanked us. My friend bought
some fruit. There was something terribly sad about the plight
of these people, sitting in their empty store, struggling to
make a living. It seemed to me that if they were prejudiced
against blacks, as Sonny Carson claims, they would be out of
business without his intervention, since almost all of the
avenue's shoppers are black, and there are many other fruit
markets on it.</p>
<p>As we left, the demonstrators muttered hostile comments,
but nothing more. Two blocks away, however, we encountered a
march of about 150 blacks, on their way to the two stores. It
was Sonny Carson's Flatbush Frontline Collective, shouting
slogans like "Boycott]" "No respect, no peace]" "Shut it
down]" and "No more Red Apple] No more Church Fruit]" The
marchers carried red-green-and-black pan-African flags and
shook their fists. They were protected by about 100 police
officers.</p>
<p>I thought about the Koreans. They no doubt feared not only
for their livelihood but their lives. Did they understand
what was happening, or the glib newspaper stories that
rationalized the conflict as "a clash of cultures"?</p>
<p>Having come to maturity in the 1960s, I pondered which
side of the barricades Martin Luther King Jr. would have been
on. He won great moral stature because he always pitted the
powerless against the powerful. He asserted the claims of
justice against unjust laws and practices. His actions and
words had moral force because he appealed to moral law, what
the Founding Fathers called natural law.</p>
<p>I could not see King railing against half a dozen
frightened Korean fruit vendors. He preached love and
forgiveness, not hatred and vengeance. I could not imagine
him leading the marchers on Church Avenue. They bore a
striking resemblance not to his followers, but to the white
bigots who screamed epithets at the frightened black children
who integrated schools in Little Rock 32 years ago.</p>
<p>Last week, Mayor Dinkins delivered an eloquent statement
against racism and prejudice, but he has avoided any direct
involvement in the confrontation on Church Avenue. His
commissioner of human rights is conducting negotiations that
have dragged on for four months. When the commissioner was
asked on television why the mayor did not personally break
the boycott, he said that the mayor was mediating the dispute
and did not find it useful to take sides.</p>
<p>Where are the champions of civil rights and civil
liberties? Where are our legislators, who are quick to vote
for civil-rights bills in Washington and Albany but absent
when civil rights are on trial in New York City? Why haven't
busloads of church groups and college students and labor
unions and others who care about human rights descended on
Church Avenue to support these powerless Korean fruit
merchants who seek nothing more than the right to earn an
honest living?</p>
