	<p class="article-leader">Xerox Corp. introduced, as expected, four new
multifunction office machines that can act as both digital
copiers and facsimile machines.
   The new devices, which will range in price from $4,295 to
$8,995, have been sold since last year in Japan by Xerox's
Japanese subsidiary. The most expensive machine -- a
free-standing, 11-page-per-minute digital copier with fax
capability -- also offers some cut-and-paste-type document
editing features. A similar machine is being gradually
introduced to the U.S. market by Japan's Ricoh Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Executives of the Stamford, Conn., company said add-in
cards, available later this year, will enable all the new
machines to be hooked up to computers so they can function as
scanners and laser printers.</p>
<p>But the executives added that these souped-up versions of
the devices introduced yesterday won't comprise the
mysterious "new family" of multifunction machines, also due
later this year, to which Xerox President Paul Allaire
alluded at last week's annual meeting.</p>
