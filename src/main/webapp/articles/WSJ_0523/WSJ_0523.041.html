	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The eight publicly traded funds originally
sponsored by VMS Realty Partners announced a return to
profitability but significantly cut their book values. Two of
the funds may resume distributions, according to a spokesman.
   VMS Mortgage Investment Fund, a real estate investment
trust, or REIT, traded on the New York Stock Exchange,
reported first-quarter net income fell 67% to $3 million, or
8 cents a share, from $9.1 million, or 23 cents a share, in
the year ago period. Although the fund's year-to-year profit
fell, the latest quarter's performance was a sharp
improvement over losses reported for the fourth quarter and
full year of 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The fund's managers claimed a per-share book value as of
March 31 of $4.75. All of the funds were issued with book
values of $10 a share or unit.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, the VMS Mortgage Investment Fund's stock closed at
$1.875 a share, up 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>The funds had been hit with losses since the empire built
by VMS Realty Partners, a syndicator of limited partnerships,
began crumbling last year. The funds were set up by VMS as
sources of mortgage cash and made loans exclusively to VMS
and its affiliates. VMS and its officers also reaped millions
of dollars in fees from the funds. Earlier this year, the
funds declared their independence from VMS and dumped the
firm as their advisers. They also suspended cash
distributions to share and unit holders.</p>
<p>Leonard G. Levine, president of the funds, said they made
no additional allowances for loan loss reserves. But Mr.
Levine said a provision for $8.46 million to cover accrued
and unpaid interest owed the Mortgage Investment Fund by VMS
and its affiliates cut into the announced earnings. Mr.
Levine said the fund had successfully negotiated the full
repayment of a $6.6 million loan from a VMS affiliate plus
about $388,000 of bonus interest. He said those funds were
being held in "short-term investments."</p>
<p>There are two VMS REITs traded on the American Stock
Exchange. VMS Hotel Investment Fund reported that net fell
53% to $968,478, or 10 cents a share, from $2.1 million, or
21 cents a share. VMS Short Term Income Trust reported net of
$595,752, or 9 cents a share, down 66% from $1.7 million, or
25 cents a share. The two funds had provisions for
uncollected interest of about $684,000 and $1.06 million
respectively. The funds now quote a per-share book value for
the hotel fund of $5.20 and $7.64 for the income trust.</p>
<p>The two REITs traded over-the-counter, VMS Strategic Land
Trust and VMS Strategic Land Fund II, showed the best
performance of any VMS funds and are considering resuming
distributions, according to a spokesman for the funds. The
land trust reported first-quarter net of $3.1 million, or 26
cents a share, down 7.7% from $3.4 million, or 28 cents a
share a year ago. The land fund posted earnings of $3.1
million, or 16 cents a share, down 49% from $6.1 million, or
31 cents a share.</p>
<p>Although the land trust and the land fund had to set aside
about $1 million and $3 million, respectively, to cover
potentially uncollectable interest, the land trust gained
full repayment of $67.3 million of VMS-related loans plus
$5.1 million in bonus interest and the Land Fund recovered
about $35 million in loans. These proceeds have yet to be
invested, Mr. Levine said.</p>
<p>The land trust now claims a book value of $6.85 and the
land fund quotes its value at $6.32.</p>
<p>The three master limited partnerships, or MLPs, originally
sponsored by VMS also reported profits. VMS Mortgage
Investors L.P. reported income of $733,224, or 10 cents a
unit, down 68% from $2.28 million, or 30 cents a unit. VMS
Mortgage Investors L.P. II earned $690,683, or 5 cents a
unit, down 78% from $3.2 million, or 25 cents a unit. VMS
Mortgage Investors L.P. III earned $2 million, or 18 cents a
unit, down 31% from $3 million, or 26 cents a unit, in the
year-ago period. All three funds said that they had made
provisions of about $1 to $2 million for potentially
uncollectable interest payments.</p>
<p>The three funds claim per-unit book values of $4.10,
$5.51, and $6.36, respectively.</p>
<p>Mr. Levine said that negotiations with VMS were continuing
and that auditors working for the fund had made a
"preliminary" report on the funds' interests in VMS
properties and the possibility of foreclosure and other
options for the properties. The funds also have retained Dean
Witter Reynolds, Cushman & Wakefield, Draper & Kramer, and
Grubb & Ellis to provide real estate and financial advice.</p>

<p>THE BOOK VALUES of the eight publicly traded funds
originally sponsored by VMS Realty Partners were largely
reduced in an announcement made last month. In yesterday's
edition it was incorrectly reported that the cuts were
announced Tuesday.</p>
