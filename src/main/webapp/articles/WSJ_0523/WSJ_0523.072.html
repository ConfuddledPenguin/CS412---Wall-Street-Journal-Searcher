	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Embattled London United Investments PLC
transferred management control to two court-approved
administrators after the big insurance holding company failed
in a seven-week effort to find new funds to meet potential
U.S. liability-policy claims.
   In a step akin to filing for Chapter 11 protection from
creditors under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, London United
entered a safe harbor for as long as three months while it
tries to form a plan to pay debt. People familiar with the
company have said it may need as much as #100 million ($168.7
million) or more to increase reserves for expected claims of
#750 million on U.S. policies such as officers' and
directors' liability, asbestos and medical-malpractice
insurance.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though an eleventh-hour savior for the major player in
London's substantial market for U.S. liability coverage can't
be ruled out, the administrators indicated they will focus
more on trying to assemble a rescue for some of the company's
insurance units to satisfy creditors, rather than try to keep
the holding company operating as a going concern. The
administrators, Colin Bird and Alan Barrett, partners at the
accounting firm Price Waterhouse, weren't available to
comment. London United officials declined to comment.</p>
<p>David Rowland, chairman of the British insurance brokers
Sedgwick Group PLC, said it and Marsh & McLennan Cos. of New
York, among others, have studied possible contributions to a
rescue effort.</p>
