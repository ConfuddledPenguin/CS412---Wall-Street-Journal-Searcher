	<p class="article-leader">A shareholder of Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd., Toronto, said he
plans to establish a group of holders to pursue a takeover
bid for the widely held gold mining company.
   The shareholder, Jacques Forget, who owns about 3% of
Agnico's shares, said he will seek the change in control as a
result of what he called "numerous errors in management." Mr.
Forget said he also will attempt to delay or prevent Agnico's
proposed offering of 40 million Canadian dollars (US$34
million) of shares and warrants. Agnico Eagle officials
weren't available to comment.</p>
