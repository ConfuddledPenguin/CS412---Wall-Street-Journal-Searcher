	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The National Transportation Safety Board
urged the government to require that small children be
strapped into safety seats during airline trips, effectively
ending their free rides.
   The board's action, by a 4-0 vote, steps up pressure on
the Federal Aviation Administration to order use of the
seats. The airlines, the Association of Flight Attendants
union, several members of Congress and several independent
safety experts have called on the FAA to require the
restraints.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If adopted by the FAA, the safety board's recommendation
would almost certainly increase the cost of flying for
families with young children. A parent flying at busy times
would have to buy an additional ticket to be sure of having
an airline seat to put a safety seat on. But airlines are
expected to continue to allow parents flying in non-peak
times to use empty seats for free for baby safety seats. And
some airlines might offer discounted fares for small children
as a marketing tactic, industry officials have said.</p>
<p>Under current regulations, airline passengers must be
strapped in during critical flight times. The only exception
is for babies under two years old, who may be held on an
adult's lap. That exception should be eliminated, the board
said, and a rule adopted requiring that all children who
weigh less than 40 pounds and are less than 40 inches long be
restrained in safety seats that have been approved for use in
cars.</p>
<p>The proposal didn't specify whether passengers or the
airlines would be responsible for providing the seats -- an
important economic issue that the FAA would have to resolve.</p>
<p>"It seems time to protect those persons who haven't been
protected before," said NTSB Chairman James Kolstad, who
noted that everyone and everything else in the cabin --
including coffee pots and luggage -- must be secured before
takeoffs and landings and during turbulence.</p>
<p>The board debated the exact wording of the recommendation.
Member Susan Coughlin argued that the FAA should require that
all children under two years of age be required to sit in
safety seats. But James Burnett, another board member,
prevailed with his recommendation based on the child's size
and weight.</p>
<p>He argued that most car safety seats are designed for
children up to 40 pounds and 40 inches long. Most are
suitable for aircraft use and should be required whether the
children involved are "two, three or four," he said.</p>
<p>The board also approved a related recommendation urging
accelerated research into whether standard airline seat belts
are adequate for small children who have outgrown safety
seats.</p>
<p>The NTSB's twin actions reflect heightened concern over
the safety of small children in the wake of two accidents in
the past year. In January, one infant was killed in the crash
of Avianca Flight 52 on Long Island, New York. Last summer,
two small children were fatally injured in the crash of
United Airlines Flight 232 in Sioux City, Iowa. None of the
three was restrained. Several children who weren't restrained
survived in the two accidents.</p>
<p>FAA officials yesterday said they are reviewing the child
safety-seat issue and will consider the NTSB recommendation.
A decision could come as early as this fall. In the past, the
agency has expressed concern about imposing an additional
financial burden on young families. Earlier this year, the
agency proposed barring airlines from prohibiting the use of
the seats -- a policy that airlines generally follow anyway.
But FAA Administrator James Busey has made clear that he
hasn't ruled out requiring safety seats.</p>
