	<p class="article-leader">NEW BRITAIN, Conn. -- Stanley Works and one current and
one former executive of the tool maker were among a number of
defendants charged with conspiring to fix prices on
architectural hinges.
   A federal grand jury in St. Louis indicted Stanley Works;
Richard G. Martin, president and general manager of the
Stanley Hardware division; and John F. Hollfelder, who was
vice president of sales for the division when he left the
company in 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also charged were Hager Hinge Co. of St. Louis; McKinney
Products Co. of Scranton, Pa.; David B. Gibson, president of
McKinney; Robert A. Haversat, a former president of McKinney;
Lawrence Brothers Inc. of Sterling, Ill., and its chairman,
John A. Lawrence.</p>
<p>The indictment charges the defendants with engaging in the
price-fixing conspiracy from at least April 1986 to April
1988.</p>
<p>For a corporation, the maximum penalty is as much as a $1
million fine; twice the gain the company derived from the
conspiracy; or twice the loss suffered by victims. For an
individual, the maximum penalty is three years in prison plus
as much as a $250,000 fine or the other two factors.</p>
<p>Stanley Works said it and Mr. Martin would vigorously
defend themselves against the charges.</p>
<p>Mr. Hollfelder was unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Lawrence declined immediate comment. The other
defendants couldn't be reached.</p>
