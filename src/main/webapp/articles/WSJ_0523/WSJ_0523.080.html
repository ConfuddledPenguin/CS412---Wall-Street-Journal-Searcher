	<p class="article-leader">SIMSBURY, Conn. -- Kollmorgen Corp. said it signed a
definitive agreement to sell certain assets of its
discrete-wiring business to the U.S. unit of Hitachi Chemical
Co., Tokyo, for about $12 million.
   The agreement includes patents, technology and certain
other operating assets of the business. The proposed
transaction doesn't include, however, a manufacturing plant
in Hicksville, N.Y., which remains for sale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed sale is part of the company's restructuring
plan, adopted last September, after the collapse of a merger
agreement with Vernitron Corp., a Deer Park, N.Y., motors and
controls company.</p>
<p>Kollmorgen, which has remaining interests in motors,
controls and an electro-optical business, currently is
resisting Vernitron's proposals to gain control of
Kollmorgen's board and to offer $15 a share for Kollmorgen.</p>
