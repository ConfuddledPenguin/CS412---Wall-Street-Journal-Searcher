	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Neil Bush, son of the president, will be
asked to explain publicly today why he and others approved a
series of transactions that led to the demise of a
Denver-based thrift. He is to appear before the House Banking
Committee to testify about his role as a director of
Silverado Banking, Savings & Loan Association.
   Mr. Bush didn't gain directly from the transactions but,
as a director, he approved loans to his outside business
associates. In at least one case, Mr. Bush didn't disclose on
financial forms that he had a business relationship with a
borrower, whose $106 million in Silverado transactions
eventually soured. Thrift regulators are pursuing an
administrative action against Mr. Bush, which he is
contesting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Silverado differed from other big thrift failures,
regulators said. For example, compared with Lincoln Savings &
Loan Association, Irvine, Calif., and CenTrust Savings,
Miami, whose failures may end up costing taxpayers twice as
much, Silverado's records and underwriting were more
complete. And it was less combative with regulators than
other more high-flying S&Ls.</p>
<p>But regulators accuse Silverado, whose losses could total
$1 billion, of requiring borrowers to also become Silverado
investors by tying Silverado loans to the purchase of
Silverado preferred stock that the thrift could count toward
capital. It also inflated appraisals and granted preferential
loans to officers, not including Mr. Bush. It also hid losses
by selling pieces of a loan pool to borrowers, who took
millions in Silverado's losses, which violates accounting
rules.</p>
<p>"Much of Silverado's high-flying was in the same
stratosphere with the Lincolns and the CenTrusts, but the
Denver thrift wins the title for the most creative
self-financing mechanisms," said Rep. Henry Gonzalez, (D.,
Texas), chairman of the committee.</p>
<p>As previously disclosed, JNB Exploration, Mr. Bush's
energy company, had oil and gas deals with two of Silverado's
major borrowers, real-estate developers Kenneth Good and Bill
Walters. Although Mr. Bush didn't vote to approve Silverado
loans to Mr. Good, in 1986 he did approve $106 million in
loans and other transactions to Mr. Walters.</p>
<p>So far, thrift regulators said they have made 11 referrals
of criminal activity to the Justice Department for possible
legal action. They declined yesterday to identify the parties
involved or the actions that are the subject of the
referrals.</p>
<p>Five former directors and officers of Silverado have
signed consent agreements barring them from working in the
financial industry without receiving permission from
regulators.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush, asserting he did nothing wrong, refused to sign
a consent agreement in January, and the matter is being
pursued in an administrative proceeding. That action would
prohibit Mr. Bush from engaging in similar lending agreements
if he were to serve on the board of any financial institution
in the future. At that time, Mr. Bush also said that he
didn't benefit directly or indirectly from the loans to Mr.
Walters.</p>
<p>The banking committee also said it plans to issue a
subpoena to Kermit Mowbray, former president of the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Topeka, Kan., who declined to appear
yesterday.</p>
<p>The committee, which asked Mr. Mowbray to testify, said it
wants to ask him why, as the top regional regulator, he
waited weeks after a staff recommendation to seize the
institution -- until after the 1988 presidential election.</p>
<p>Federal regulators said yesterday that hundreds of ailing
thrifts were being seized during late 1988, and that the
election and the presence of Neil Bush on the Silverado
board, didn't influence the timing of Silverado's takeover.</p>
<p>In December 1988, Silverado was sold to First Nationwide
Bank, the thrift subsidiary of Ford Motor Co.</p>
