	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Despite the well-publicized problems in the
banking industry, bank stocks remain popular with corporate
insiders. Reports filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission by officers, directors and other insiders who buy
shares in their companies continue to list bank stocks among
the most-bought issues.
   It could be a case of bargain-hunting. The stocks are
selling at prices well below what they were just a few months
ago. "Just about every bank stock is depressed," said George
Salem, an analyst who follows banks for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. "Some may be takeover targets, but it would
be because they're ailing, not because they're beautiful."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At Miami-based Southeast Banking Corp., SEC filings show,
Alfonso J. Fanjul Jr., a director, paid $3.4 million to buy
250,000 shares last month. While the stock was selling for
more than $20 at the beginning of the year, Mr. Fanjul paid
between $13 and $13.50 a share, the filings show. Southeast
Banking stock closed yesterday at $13.125, down 12.5 cents,
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Fanjul, who a Southeast Banking spokeswoman described
as an investor with a number of holdings, was out of the
country and couldn't be reached for comment. According to SEC
filings, his latest purchases bring his Southeast Banking
holdings to 251,584 shares held indirectly and 3,183 held
directly.</p>
<p>Insiders at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles also
bought company stock last month, SEC filings show. Director
William F. Miller bought 1,000 shares for $35.25 each,
bringing his holdings to 1,310 shares; Warren Christopher,
another director, bought 500 shares at $35.13 each, raising
his total holdings to 1,545 shares. First Interstate's stock
price, which was about $44 in early January, closed yesterday
on the Big Board at $38.50, down 25 cents. Mr. Miller and Mr.
Christopher couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Other banks where insiders have bought stock recently
include Boatmen's Bancshares Inc., St. Louis; Crestar
Financial Corp., Richmond, Va.; First Essex Bancorp Inc.,
Lawrence, Mass.; and Shawmut National Corp., Boston.</p>
<p>"The worry list is still out there," said James McDermott,
a bank analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. "But for
those willing to brave some of the near-term uncertainty . .
., there are some very attractive yields."</p>

<p>SELLING THE STORE: The chairman and the president of
Circuit City Stores Inc. sold significant portions of their
company holdings last month, SEC filings show.</p>
<p>Richard L. Sharp, president and chief executive officer of
the Richmond, Va.-based electronics retailer, sold 110,000
shares, about 19% of his holdings, for nearly $3 million.
Alan L. Wurtzel, chairman, sold 85,000 shares, about 30% of
his stake, for about $2.2 million.</p>
<p>Neither was available for comment. A company spokeswoman
said Mr. Sharp sold to diversify his personal holdings; he
still holds 454,530 shares. She said Mr. Wurtzel has been
gradually selling his stock since he retired from active
management of the company in 1986; he continues to hold
197,500 shares, plus options.</p>
<p>Mr. Sharp sold most of his shares at $27.25 each and the
remainder at $27 a share. Mr. Wurtzel sold at between $26.75
and $27.13 a share. The stock closed yesterday at $26.50,
unchanged, in Big Board trading.</p>
<p>Circuit City reported a 12% increase in earnings for the
year ended Feb. 28 and reported increases in sales for the
first two months of the current fiscal year.</p>

<p>SELLING MICKEY AND DONALD: Gary L. Wilson, who stepped
down as chief financial officer of Walt Disney Co. at the end
of last year, sold $17.3 million of Disney stock last month,
reports filed with the SEC show. Roy E. Disney, vice chairman
and a nephew of the company founder, sold about $3.6 million
of the stock, according to the filings.</p>
<p>The 150,000 shares Mr. Wilson sold were his entire stake
in the Burbank, Calif.-based entertainment giant, although he
continues to hold options to buy more than 300,000 Disney
shares. The executive, who remains a Disney director and
adviser, was part of the group that bought Northwest Airlines
for $3.65 billion last year.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson said the Disney shares he sold were bought
through the exercise of options in August. "You just can't
afford not to sell from an economic point of view," he said,
noting the tax advantages of selling six months after an
option-related purchase. "I have great confidence in {Disney}
and think it's one of the great companies in America," he
added.</p>
<p>Mr. Disney wasn't available to comment on his sale of
32,000 shares, which was just slightly more than 1% of his
total holdings. A spokesman said the sale was for estate and
tax-planning purposes and to help pay for a new house.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson sold his stock at between $115 and $115.38 a
share, Mr. Disney at between $112.13 and $112.50 a share. The
shares closed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange trading at
$119.50, up $3.25.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>BUYING IN: SEC filings show that nine Safeway Inc.
executives bought stock late last month in the company's
initial public offering of 10 million shares. The Oakland,
Calif.-based supermarket chain, which went private in
November 1986 in a leveraged buy-out led by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co., sold 10% of the company back to the public at
$11.25 a share. The stock closed yesterday at $12, down 12.5
cents, on the Big Board.</p>
<p>The nine executives, including seven vice presidents and
two divisional managers, reported buying between 100 and
15,200 shares each. A company spokesman said the purchases
were individual decisions and that he didn't know how many
employees bought stock in the offering.</p>
<p>In addition, James H. Greene Jr., a Safeway director and a
KKR associate, bought 7,000 shares. George R. Roberts, a KKR
partner, reported the purchase of 200,000 shares, held by a
trust for the benefit of his children, and Robert I.
MacDonnell, another KKR partner, reported the purchase of
30,000 shares held by a trust for the benefit of his
children.</p>
