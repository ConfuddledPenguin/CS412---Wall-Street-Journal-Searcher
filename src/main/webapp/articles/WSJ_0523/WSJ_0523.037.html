	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Commerce Committee approved a
bill that allows the Baby Bells to manufacture
telecommunications equipment, a long-sought but limited
victory for the seven companies.
   The measure, passed on voice vote, would lift the ban on
manufacturing contained in the consent decree that broke up
the Bell system. Only Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii) opposed
the bill in a brief discussion prior to the vote.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the legislation, introduced by Commerce Committee
Chairman Ernest F. Hollings (D., S.C.), doesn't touch consent
decree restrictions on the Bells entering computerized
information services and the long-distance industry. And in a
provision the Bells find onerous, the measure stipulates that
manufacturing is to take place within the U.S. from U.S.-made
parts. The bill leaves policing largely up to the Federal
Communications Commission, and gives the FCC authority to
waive the "domestic content" requirement if a phone company
can prove "extraordinary circumstances."</p>
<p>In addition, the measure requires the Bells to obtain a
portion of the financing for their manufacturing ventures
from outside investors.</p>
<p>The Bells' reaction was restrained. "It is an important
first step in the process," said Laird Walker, head of U S
West Inc.'s Washington office and the chairman of an informal
Bell committee that has been working to lift the antitrust
restrictions. "The domestic content language still needs
work," he said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, with a busy schedule and little time left to
consider complex telecommunications legislation, there is
only a slim chance that "free-the-Bells" legislation will
pass both the Senate and the House this year. For starters,
the Commerce Committee bill could be delayed by a possible
Judiciary Committee review or Finance Committee concerns over
its implications for international trade. Last week, Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), chairman of the Judiciary
Committee's antitrust panel expressed concern about the
Hollings measure.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, key House members would like to see a more
comprehensive package that would allow the Bells to enter
information services. The Energy and Commerce Committee's
telecommunications panel has been circulating a staff draft
of legislation, trying to get consensus on a measure that
could move quickly.</p>
<p>The vote comes after six years of intensive lobbying by
the regional phone companies to lift all restrictions in the
consent decree. This year alone, the Bells budgeted $21
million for a lobbying and advertising blitz aimed at
upsetting the decree.</p>
