	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its
credit ratings on Citicorp, including its commercial paper,
citing comparatively low reserve and capital levels and a
rising number of problem loans.
   The move, which follows a similar downgrading by Standard
& Poor's Corp. last month, affects an estimated $31 billion
in long-term and short-term debt. S&P had affirmed its rating
on Citicorp's commercial paper, a regular source of funding
for the nation's largest banking company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moody's dropped its ratings on senior debt to single-A-3
from single-A-1 and on commercial paper to Prime-2 from
Prime-1. Subordinated debt and preferred were reduced to
Baa-1 from single-A-2 and from single-A-3 to single-A-2,
respectively. Moody's said a two-notch reduction in a rating
is unusual.</p>
<p>The Prime-1 rating on the short-term deposits and letters
of credit of its flagship, Citibank, were confirmed. However,
long-term deposits and long-term letters of credit were
reduced to single-A-1 from double-A-2.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether investors have fully discounted the
downgrading. When the Moody's review was announced in April,
the pricing on Citicorp paper rose relative to other issuers.
Though Citicorp remains an investment-grade debtor, the lower
rating on its commercial paper will make the bank's paper
off-limits for some institutional investors.</p>
<p>Since the review was announced, Citicorp has downplayed
the significance of a downgrading, noting that the company
satisfies only about 2% of its funding needs through the
commercial-paper market. In addition, the bank has no plans
to issue long-term debt.</p>
<p>The company has defended its reserves and capital
positions, emphasizing its unique global character and its
rigorous underwriting standards in arguing why it shouldn't
be held to the standards of other banks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the downgrading, which comes on the heels of
similar reviews for dozens of other banks, could crimp
Citicorp when it raises funds in the future.</p>
<p>The announcement was made after the close of trading. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Citicorp
was down 12.5 cents at $23.75 a share.</p>
<p>Kenneth J.H. Pinkes, a Moody's vice president, said,
"They're still a strong company, but they have a low level of
capital for a bank with their old rating. The company has
always operated with a thin margin of safety, while pursuing
multiple business opportunities. There isn't much of a
cushion."</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Citicorp's nonperforming loans
and those loans 90 days or more past due amounted to 6.6% of
total loans. Meanwhile, its reserves totaled 44% of its
problem loans.</p>
<p>By comparison, the averages for U.S. banks with more than
$30 billion in assets are a 4.5% level of problem loans and
reserves totaling 89% of such loans. BankAmerica Corp.'s loan
problems, for instance, were 5.8% of its loans, and its
reserves stood at 70% of problem portfolio.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Moody's said that while Citicorp's
real-estate portfolio is geographically diverse and while its
underwriting standards appear to be sound, it is vulnerable
to the deteriorating national real-estate market.</p>
<p>In a statement, Citicorp said, "We're very disappointed
with Moody's action. We don't expect any significant increase
in overall funding costs. Increasing securitization of assets
has substantially decreased Citicorp's use of long-term debt,
while deposit growth has reduced commercial paper to 2% of
funding needs. Citibank retains the highest short-term
deposit rating."</p>
<p>As previously indicated, Citicorp said it will rebuild
capital throughout 1990 from retained earnings and sale of
non-strategic assets as well as what it called "vigorous
asset management."</p>
<p>Citicorp pointed out that the Aaa ratings on its most
recent offering of securities backed by credit-card
receivables aren't affected. Ratings on some mortgage-backed
pass-throughs were lowered one notch. Additionally, several
tranches of multiclass mortgage securities were reaffirmed.</p>

Citicorp's preferred stock to single-A-3 from single-A-2. In
yesterday's edition, the reduction was misstated.</p>
