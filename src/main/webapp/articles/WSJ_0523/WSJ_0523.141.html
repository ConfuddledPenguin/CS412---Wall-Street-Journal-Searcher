	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is set to unveil its
long-awaited proposal to expand the Securities and Exchange
Commission's clout, amid signs that the idea is in trouble in
Congress.
   The measure, which the Treasury Department had promised to
introduce two weeks ago, would shift oversight of stock-index
futures to the SEC from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. Those futures, which are used mostly by large
institutional investors, enable market players to bet on the
direction of a basket of stocks without buying those
securities. They are frequently used in program-trading
strategies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, the plan offers the first details of how the
administration would allow the SEC to regulate margins on
some futures products. It also would change commodity law to
allow easier introduction of new products on exchanges.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, a veteran of old-line
Wall Street, has been an outspoken critic of the CFTC's
oversight of stock-index futures. He contends that if the SEC
were granted expanded authority, it could better resolve
problems between the markets -- problems like those that led
to the October drops of 1987 and 1989.</p>
<p>But momentum appears to have drastically slowed in recent
weeks on Capitol Hill for the proposal, which is expected to
be introduced as an amendment to the Futures Trading
Practices Act. That act, which would beef up the CFTC, was
passed last year by the Senate Agriculture Committee but has
been held up by a provision that would have shifted
index-futures jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The problem, suggested one Capitol Hill aide who backs the
switch, is that "the easiest thing in the world for someone
up here to do is to avoid making a tough decision on
something as contentious as this." Vehement opposition by the
Chicago commodity exchanges and the Agriculture committees
appears to be having a ripple effect on other members who
haven't yet decided on the issue, individuals on Capitol Hill
added.</p>
<p>"The only ones who really want {the switch} is Treasury,"
contended William Mattea, an aide to Sen. Alan Dixon (D.,
Ill.), who staunchly opposes any shift. "There is no
coalition supporting it."</p>
<p>Even some who advocate the transfer now wonder where the
support might come from. "This measure is still lacking in
grass-roots support," said one aide. "Some folks in industry
are going to have to get motivated and start contacting
members."</p>
<p>Mr. Brady has begun knocking on Senate doors to lobby for
the measure, arguing that if senators won't support the
switch, they risk being blamed for the next sharp
futures-aided drop in the stock market. But that argument
hasn't been particularly persuasive, several Senate aides
contend.</p>
<p>To win on Capitol Hill, Mr. Brady will have to lean
heavily on both Republicans and Democrats to act. That won't
be an easy task, considering many natural allies are
skeptical. Says Republican Banking Committee aide Bradley
Belt, "It's one question I haven't resolved in my own mind."</p>
<p>According to the Treasury proposal, the SEC would regulate
stock-index futures under the Commodity Exchange Act.</p>
<p>Two other parts of the administration proposal should get
broader backing, however. One would amend the so-called
exclusivity provision of the Commodity Exchange Act. That
provision drew the SEC's ire after a federal appeals court
ruled that products with elements of futures and stocks must
be classified as futures and can be traded only on commodity
exchanges and regulated only by the CFTC.</p>
<p>Under the Treasury proposal, any exchange could trade a
product with both futures and securities characteristics
provided a regulator approved it. It could be regulated under
either commodities or securities law, the plan says. "The
intent of the new exception from the Commodity Exchange Act
is to overrule the decision" of the court because that ruling
impedes "the development of innovative financial
instruments," according to a draft version of the plan
acquired by this newspaper.</p>
<p>Moreover, the administration plan would grant the SEC the
right to "review and approve" margin levels of stock-index
futures. Margins, or the good-faith money needed to trade,
have been controversial because they are set by the commodity
exchanges with almost no federal oversight. When margins slip
too low, the SEC and Treasury have argued, they help
exacerbate market slides.</p>
<p>The new rule would allow the SEC to require unilaterally
that the exchanges change margin levels if "necessary or
appropriate for the protection of specified persons or to
insure fair dealing."</p>
<p>Another provision in the proposed legislation would
expand, for enforcement reasons, the definition of "security"
to include options and stock-index futures.</p>
<p>In an effort to minimize disruption during the transfer of
jurisdiction, the SEC would be required to consult with the
CFTC. That provision "is to promote the greatest degree of
cooperation between the two commissions," the draft said.</p>
<p>The administration's proposal is likely to be substituted
for the amendment proposed by Sen. Slade Gorton (R., Wash.).
So far, Mr. Gorton has emerged as the Senate's most avid
backer of the jurisdictional switch.</p>
<p>Although he is likely to be joined by members of the
Senate Banking Committee, that support doesn't appear to have
the firepower to overcome an increasingly well-organized
defense by supporters of the CFTC and the Chicago commodity
exchanges. In addition to other members of the Agriculture
Committee, who aren't eager to weaken the CFTC and in turn
their own clout, Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole (R.,
Kan.) has said he would oppose a switch.</p>
<p>Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), who heads the Senate Agriculture
Committee, asked in a recent letter to Majority Leader George
Mitchell that the administration proposal be moved to the
Senate floor for debate as quickly as possible. "The
arguments against the administration's proposal are
compelling," Sens. Leahy and Richard Lugar (R., Ind.) wrote.
"We are confident they will stand the scrutiny of fair and
open debate on the Senate floor."</p>
<p>That vote isn't expected to take place before mid-June,
Senate sources said.</p>
