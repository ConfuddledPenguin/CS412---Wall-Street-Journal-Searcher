	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian regulators are expected to authorize
this summer a Canadian unit of London & Scottish Marine Oil
PLC of Britain to develop the first oil fields off North
America's East Coast.
   The two fields, known as Cohasset and Panuke, are about 30
miles west of Nova Scotia's Sable Island.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is a very important first step for offshore Nova
Scotia and probably for offshore Canada," said Carey Ryan,
assistant deputy minister of the Nova Scotia Ministry of
Mines and Resources. "We're quite optimistic that it is going
to go ahead as planned."</p>
<p>Public hearings are to start next month on the proposed
project, a joint venture of London & Scottish, which is
called Lasmo, and Nova Scotia Resources Ltd., a provincial
government agency. Lasmo is a major independent oil and gas
producer.</p>
<p>A final decision on whether to approve the Lasmo proposal
is expected to be made jointly by the federal and Nova Scotia
energy ministers by August.</p>
<p>The fields are expected to produce about 35 million
barrels of oil over six years starting in 1992. They contain
a high-value condensate that can be used to make jet fuel and
can be blended with heavier crudes.</p>
<p>Development of the two fields is expected to cost 156
million Canadian dollars (US$132.5 million), less than 5% of
the estimated development costs for the big Hibernia oil
field off Newfoundland. Hibernia isn't expected to be brought
into production until 1996.</p>
<p>Lasmo, which has developed similar small fields in the
North Sea and elsewhere, will use a leased jack-up rig to
drill production wells in each field. The rig also will serve
as a production platform. The condensate will be piped to the
rig, pumped into a moored storage tanker and brought ashore
by a shuttle tanker.</p>
<p>Lasmo said several companies in Canada, the U.S. and
Europe already have expressed interest in buying the
condensate.</p>
<p>The proposed Lasmo development so far has encountered
little opposition. The fields aren't in prime fishing
grounds, and Lasmo said it won't operate its rig during the
rough winter months, to reduce the risk of an oil spill.</p>
<p>The company has met with fishermen to assure them of the
project's low risks. Condensate isn't "that tarry, sticky
substance that will cling to shorelines," a Lasmo spokeswoman
said. In the event of a spill, condensate, unlike heavy
crude, would evaporate quickly, she said. Nova Scotia
fishermen have blocked exploratory drilling in Georges Bank,
a fishing ground off the province.</p>
<p>Exploration has been conducted off the East Coast for 25
years, but no oil from the region has ever been brought to
market. The Lasmo development will be a "kick start" for
other offshore exploration and development ventures,
predicted Laurie Taylor, manager of the Canadian Petroleum
Association's Eastern region.</p>
<p>Cohasset was discovered in 1973 by Mobil Oil Canada Ltd.,
a unit of Mobil Corp. Shell Canada Ltd., a subsidiary of
Royal Dutch/Shell Group, drilled the first well in the Panuke
field in 1986.</p>
<p>The C$5.1 billion Hibernia project, which is several
hundred miles northeast of Cohasset and Panuke, has been
stalled because of low oil prices and protracted negotiations
with the federal and Newfoundland governments on government
financial support and guarantees. The governments and a
consortium of companies led by Mobil Oil Canada are expected
to sign by the end of June an agreement that would allow
construction of the project to begin. Hibernia is expected to
produce 110,000 barrels a day of crude oil.</p>
<p>Terra Nova, another big oil field off Newfoundland, also
is expected to begin production in the mid-1990s.
Petro-Canada, a government agency and leader of the
consortium developing the field, recently revised its reserve
estimate for Terra Nova to 300 million barrels from 132
million. The project is expected to cost C$2 billion.</p>
<p>Aside from some seismic work under way in Cohasset and
Panuke, one well is being drilled off the East Coast. The
well, near the Terra Nova field, is the first to be drilled
in the region in almost a year.</p>
