	<p class="article-leader">Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded the debt of
Household International Inc.'s main finance unit, but left
unchanged ratings on the parent company's debt and also that
of the main unit's big commercial-paper program.
   The decision by Moody's followed more than a month of
review by the debt-rating agency, which encountered strong
arguments from Household's management against a broader or
more severe downgrading. Moody's had considered as much as a
two-notch downgrading of the senior debt of the main unit,
Household Finance Corp., but lowered it instead by a single
notch, to single-A-2 from single-A-1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move, which also included downgrades on some other HFC
securities, affected in all about $8.7 billion of debt.</p>
<p>Donald C. Clark, Household's chairman and chief executive
officer, said he was "disappointed" by the HFC downgrade, but
"pleased" Moody's didn't go further. He pointed out that the
agency left alone the HFC commercial paper rating of Prime-1,
which covers about $4 billion and is perhaps most crucial to
the lending concern's funding.</p>
<p>Moody's said that while Household's big
commercial-real-estate and leveraged-buy-out loan portfolios
"remain a concern, they appear manageable." Also, Mr. Clark
has said the company's growth between now and 1993 won't
likely be as rapid as it was the past two years. For the five
year period, ending in 1993, Mr. Clark expects to double the
company's assets, which stood at $27.75 billion at March 31.</p>
<p>Despite the rapid growth, Moody's expects Household's
capital levels to improve.</p>
<p>The HFC downgrade brings its rating within one level of
the parent company's single-A-3 senior debt rating,
reflecting Moody's concern that the relatively stronger HFC
unit could be called upon to support weaker operations. Mr.
Clark called that "a backhanded compliment. HFC is very
strong -- the strongest part of the whole company."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Household
closed at $45.75 a share, up 12.5 cents.</p>
