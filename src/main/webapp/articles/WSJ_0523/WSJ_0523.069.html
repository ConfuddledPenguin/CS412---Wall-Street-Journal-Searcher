	<p class="article-leader">IRVING, Texas -- Imco Recycling Inc. said it received a
patent from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for a
process that treats spent aluminum reduction cell linings, a
smelter waste product.
   Imco, an aluminum-can recycler, said its process lowers
the raw material and energy costs associated with aluminum
recycling and reduces the unsafe elements in the linings.</p>
