	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, with a strong
assist from U.S. trade negotiators, agreed in principle to
install automated futures-contract trading terminals in Japan
by the end of June.
   But an exchange spokesman said plans for a June launch of
the system, called Globex, have been pushed back by at least
a few months to allow for further testing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move is a major victory for the Chicago Merc, which
had been counting on access to Japan to help make Globex a
world-wide trading system, complementing initial plans for
automated trading terminals in Chicago, New York and London.
Terminals will be added in Paris about six months after
Globex starts trading, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Japanese regulators earlier hinted they might delay
clearance for the system. The foot-dragging by the Ministry
of Finance was due in part, critics asserted, to fears that
Globex might siphon activity from Japan's fledgling
financial-futures industry.</p>
<p>The automated trading system is being developed by a
partnership formed by the Chicago Merc and Reuters Holdings
PLC, which is providing the communications-systems expertise.
The system, in which orders will be entered into a central
computer and then matched automatically with offsetting
orders, will function before and after the Chicago Merc's
regular trading hours.</p>
