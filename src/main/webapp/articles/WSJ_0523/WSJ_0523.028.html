	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Want a free mortgage?
   Mortgage-industry officials say a few lenders are offering
a new type of home-purchase loan dubbed the "live free"
mortgage. It allows home buyers to skip loan payments for as
long as two years. After that, the borrower begins paying off
the loan at market interest rate, without extra penalties for
the missed payments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So what's the problem? Industry officials claim those left
holding the bag with "live free" mortgages aren't the home
buyers or mortgage lenders. Instead, it's a problem for
unsuspecting investors, especially mutual funds, that often
buy packages of home mortgages in the form of mortgage-backed
securities.</p>
<p>The Public Securities Association, which represents
dealers selling mortgage-backed securities, wants "live free"
mortgages outlawed by the Government National Mortgage
Association. Ginnie Mae buys mortgages from lenders and
assembles them into pools for sale to investors.</p>
<p>Ginnie Mae officials say they don't consider "live free"
mortgages a significant problem. "This is a minor percentage
of a small subset," a Ginnie Mae spokesman said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Ginnie Mae said yesterday that it planned to
issue a "cease and desist" letter to all industry
participants prohibiting "live free" mortgages. The agency
also said it was considering a change of its official
rulebook on the subject.</p>
<p>After weeks of trying to get Ginnie Mae to change its
mind, the dealers' trade group earlier in the day had set a
deadline of Friday for Ginnie Mae to ban "live free"
mortgages from Ginnie Mae pools. Failing that, the Public
Securities Association said it would amend its guidelines for
delivering securities to weed out "live free" mortgages.</p>
<p>That move could have disrupted the market for many other
mortgage-backed securities. Estimates of the amount of "live
free" mortgages vary widely, ranging from $50 million to $500
million. About $900 billion in mortgage-backed securities are
outstanding.</p>
<p>The "live free" home mortgages carry premium interest
rates of at least one percentage point or more above the
market rate, currently about 10.5%. But the borrower never
has to pay the premium rate because the lender picks up the
tab while the mortgages are repeatedly paid off and replaced
with new mortgages.</p>
<p>Kidder, Peabody & Co., in a recent report, says a typical
"live free" mortgage might be issued with a 12.5% rate. The
lender agrees to pay the principal and interest on the
mortgage for a set period of, say, six months, after which
the borrower and lender agree that mortgage will be
refinanced.</p>
<p>The lender then sells the high-rate mortgage as part of a
Ginnie Mae mortgage pool. Because of the premium rate, the
mortgage commands a higher price for the lender, which more
than covers the monthly mortgage payments due to the eventual
buyer of the Ginnie Mae securities.</p>
<p>After six months, the first mortgage is prepaid and a new
mortgage is issued at 12%, according to the Kidder Peabody
example. This also is sold at a premium price into a Ginnie
Mae pool. The process is repeated until a market rate is
reached, at which point the borrower picks up the monthly
payments.</p>
<p>Kidder Peabody says the practice amounts to
"misrepresentation . . . since the premium mortgages are
prepaid at the end of six months, and the investor never has
a chance to earn the premium coupon for a long enough period
to justify the premium risk, even adjusting for normal
prepayment risk."</p>
<p>The Public Securities Association won't name the lenders
it says are making and then pooling "live free" mortgages for
sale.</p>
<p>While industry participants think the number of "live
free" mortgages outstanding is relatively small, the
mortgages may be concentrated in the hands of a few
investors, exposing them to potentially significant losses.
In particular, Kidder says Ginnie Mae mutual funds could be
attracted to the pools carrying high interest rates, not
knowing that these pools contain some "live free" mortgages
likely to be quickly prepaid.</p>
<p>One Ginnie Mae fund operator, T. Rowe Price Associates of
Baltimore, says it checked its holdings of mortgage pools
formed since 1988 and carrying interest rates over 11%,
trying to estimate how many might contain "live free"
mortgages.</p>
<p>"Our involvement would be very, very minimal," says
Heather Landon, vice president of T. Rowe's $360 million
Ginne Mae fund. "We do have a handful that are in question,
but it's not a problem for us."</p>
