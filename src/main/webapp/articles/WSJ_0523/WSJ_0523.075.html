	<p class="article-leader">EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Wyle Laboratories expects to report
fiscal first-quarter net income jumped threefold as its
five-year effort to refocus on semiconductor and computer
sales in its electronic business bears results, Charles M.
Clough, president and chief executive officer, said.
   Wyle stock rose sharply and traded heavily after a Smith
Barney Harris Upham & Co. analyst upgraded her opinion of the
stock to buy from hold. She cited stronger-than-expected
first-quarter earnings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Wyle closed at $14, up $2.</p>
<p>Wyle markets semiconductors and computer systems and
supplies research, engineering, and testing services to the
aerospace, defense, and nuclear energy industries.</p>
<p>Mr. Clough in an interview said that first-quarter net was
$2.9 million to $3 million, or 29 cents to 30 cents a share.
That compares with year-earlier net of $1.1 million, or 10
cents a share.</p>
<p>Mr. Clough said sales rose 6% to $108 million to $109
million from $102.6 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>"Surely," he said, "this is the best the company has been
operating in my eight years here," Mr. Clough said. He added,
however, that the company has no current plans to boost its
dividend payment.</p>
<p>Sales and profit increases came mostly from Wyle's growing
electronic business, which accounts for 79% of sales,
compared with 70% to 75% five years ago. The segment is
expected to become 80% to 85% of Wyle's sales in another five
years.</p>
