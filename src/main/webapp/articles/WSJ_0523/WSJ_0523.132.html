	<p class="article-leader">Siemens AG and Mannesmann AG said yesterday that they plan
to merge their respective office printing-machine businesses
effective October 1.
   The two big, diversified West German electronics groups
said the printer operations will be merged into Mannesmann's
current wholly owned Mannesmann Tally G.m.b.H. subsidiary, in
which Munich-based Siemens will take a 49% stake.
Dusseldorf-based Mannesmann will control the remaining 51% of
the new entity, the companies said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The merger, which is subject to antitrust review by West
Germany's Federal Cartel Office, will strengthen Mannesmann
Tally's position as Europe's largest manufacturer of office
printers. The concern also operates in the U.S.</p>
<p>The post-merger company will start out with around 770
million Deutsche marks ($463.2 million) of annual sales. Of
that total, the present Mannesmann Tally businesses will
account for around 520 million marks, while the Siemens
printer operations represent about 250 million marks of
sales.</p>
<p>The companies declined to discuss financial details of the
agreement for the merger. But a Mannesmann spokesman said
cash payments aren't involved in the transaction.</p>
