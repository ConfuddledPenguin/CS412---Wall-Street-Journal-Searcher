	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Congress is on the verge of passing
legislation to give the disabled sharply increased access to
services and jobs.
   Though hailed as a way to finally give equal rights to
people with disabilities, the legislation sends shivers
through many businesses that feel it will be burdensome to
comply. But some companies, mostly larger ones, have already
begun accommodating the disabled. They say it's less
expensive than feared and more rewarding than hoped.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The House yesterday overwhelmingly passed the Americans
With Disabilities Act by a vote of 403 to 20. The Senate had
already handily approved a disabilities bill. After a
House-Senate conference to resolve differences, President
Bush is expected to sign the bill into law.</p>
<p>The act, which makes up the most sweeping civil-rights
bill in more than 25 years, would bar employment
discrimination against people with physical or mental
disabilities. It also would require access to public
buildings, telephone service, mass transportation and
government services for the 43 million people in the U.S. who
have disabilities. Until the law goes into effect, disabled
people are protected by only a patchwork of state or local
laws and a 1973 law that sets requirements for federal
buildings, contractors and grant recipients.</p>
<p>Some employers are worried about whom they may have to
hire, but much of the opposition boils down to money. Critics
of the bill object to the wording, saying phrases such as
"reasonable accommodation" are too vague and could lead to
expensive lawsuits, although most of those terms are already
used in the 1973 law. Outright costs for building and systems
alterations are the other big concern. The White House
estimates the annual cost of employment and
public-accommodations requirements will be between $1 billion
and $2 billion a year. Many businesses worry that the burden
will fall unevenly.</p>
<p>Accommodating people with disabilities will be costly for
construction companies, injecting surprises into final bills
for clients, the Associated General Contractors says.
Contractors "can't build the cost into their price structure
because the cost is not foreseeable at the time when bids are
due," the trade group says.</p>
<p>Companies that have begun to meet disabilities-access
rules say most cost concerns are overblown, as does a federal
study by Syracuse University, which found that access
features, when designed into new construction, on average add
less than 1% to the total cost.</p>
<p>Marriott Corp. says the added expense of providing such
features as 40 wheelchair-accessible rooms and Braille panels
in the elevators at a multimillion-dollar hotel that it
opened in San Francisco last year was "insignificant." And
when Marriott hired James Burtnett, who uses a wheelchair, as
a telephone operator in its Bethesda, Md., headquarters last
year, the company needed only to widen a phone cubicle, at a
cost of less than $50.</p>
<p>While it costs more to revamp an existing building, the
new law wouldn't require "retrofitting" if it means an "undue
burden" for the business.</p>
<p>Many proponent companies say accommodation is worth it
because the customer base and labor pool are enlarged.
"Hiring and accommodating people with disabilities as well as
designing facilities accessible to all simply make good
business sense," says Richard E. Marriott, vice chairman of
Marriott.</p>
<p>After booking a meeting of 3,000 Disabled American
Veterans in 1985, the Sheraton New Orleans spent $5,000 to
build ramps to its pool deck and to the street, widen
meeting-room aisles and furnish office space for a medical
clinic. The hotel serves at least two organizations of
disabled persons a year and several disabled individuals
nightly, says Robert Foster, general manager. The hotel,
named the top Sheraton in North America last year, will add
new services, including sign-language interpreters for the
deaf, for meetings this year of the National Deaf Bowlers
Association and the Veterans Administration/Paralyzed
Veterans.</p>
<p>Transportation providers may have the most expensive job
ahead. The American Public Transit Association says that
lifts to raise people in wheelchairs onto buses add not only
$10,000 to $15,000 per bus to the purchase price, but also
tack on another $8,000 a year in operating and maintenance
expenses. To make commuter-rail and subway stations
accessible may run into billions of dollars, the association
believes.</p>
<p>Greyhound Corp., a unit of GLI Holding Co., says the bill
will cost the company $78 million a year in added expenses
and lost revenue, counting wheelchair-lift equipment for new
buses and lost seats on lift-fitted buses. Greyhound gained a
compromise provision in the legislation that will hold off
the lift requirement until after a feasibility study, which
could lead to less-costly solutions. (Democratic Sen. Tom
Harkin of Iowa, chairman of the Senate disability policy
subcommittee, who helped negotiate the compromise, says lifts
are available at less than a third of the $35,000 price
quoted by Greyhound.)</p>
<p>The Denver Rapid Transit District, giving in after a
protracted battle with activists, has been moving to equip
all new buses and some old ones with lifts, so that all
routes will have service for wheelchair users. Robert Bauman,
the general manager, says the Denver system made some design
and upkeep changes that have slashed the annual maintenance
cost to $980 a bus, from $5,000.</p>
<p>Mass-transit buses and rail cars purchased more than 30
days after the law is enacted must be accessible to the
disabled; "key" subway, light rail and commuter rail stations
must be made accessible to disabled people between 20 and 30
years after enactment. Paratransit services, such as
door-to-door vans for the severely disabled, must be made
accessible within 18 months.</p>
<p>Just providing access isn't enough, says Harold Jenkins,
general manager of the Cambria County Transit Authority in
Johnstown, Pa. After fitting its buses with lifts in 1983,
the system made the changes work for it by "selling" the
service. Because many people are "uncomfortable in dealing
with those who are different," disabled people often are
reluctant "to venture out into society," he explains. The
system now carries more than 3,000 passengers in wheelchairs
and 36,000 other disabled people each year.</p>
<p>Advocates for the disabled also stress that planning ahead
saves money. Ronald Mace, president of Barrier Free
Environment Inc., a Raleigh, N.C., architectural firm, says
he often sees buildings built before designers look at
municipal accessibility requirements. "We have been called in
on some major corporation facilities" to play accessibility
catch-up, says Mr. Mace, who is in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>Such advocates say reasonable access is vital to help
prevent discrimination against the disabled. Lisa Carl, 21
years old, was denied access to a movie theater in 1988
because she was in a wheelchair. When her mother called to
ask why, she was told, "She can't even open the door." The
Tacoma, Wash., human rights department ruled the theater
discriminated against Ms. Carl. The theater has gone to court
seeking to overturn the ruling and asking that, instead, an
aide be required to accompany Ms. Carl to the theater.</p>
<p>Paul Roth, president of Roth Cos., a theater chain based
in Silver Spring, Md., and government relations chairman for
the National Association of Theater Owners, says, "The local
Bijou isn't the newest Marriott hotel in San Francisco. If
compliance with the act is not made clear and easier, many of
these theaters will close," he says. "They do not have the
time, staff or resources to determine or argue, perhaps
before a regulatory agency or in a courtroom, what is
reasonable, readily achievable or an undue hardship or
financial burden."</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be that difficult, contends Patrisha
Wright, a lobbyist for the Disability Rights Education and
Defense Fund, in Berkeley, Calif. Businesses, she says, "can
either talk to the disability community and find practical
solutions, or they can . . . spend a bundle on things that
aren't necessary."</p>
<p>Beyond access to services, activists say the new law will
help provide access to jobs. Corporate aversion to hiring
people with disabilities is unfounded, they say, both in
terms of cost and worker ability. An analysis of more than
10,000 disabled employees by Job Accommodation Network showed
31% of these hirings required no added cost for special
training or facilities, 50% were under $50 and 69% cost less
than $500. Only 1% cost over $5,000.</p>
<p>"The biggest barrier to getting {disabled} people hired is
the attitude of managers, not the cost," says Kathleen
Alexander, Marriott's vice president for personnel services.
Because qualified workers are becoming harder to find or to
keep, employers must turn to such potential employees, she
says.</p>
<p>Arlene Mayerson, an attorney for the Disability Rights
fund in California, agrees. Mostly, she says, employers
either have misconceptions that disabled people can't work
well or are nervous about having them around, fearing, for
example, that they'll offend fellow employees.</p>
<p>Marriott knows of more than 6,000 disabled employees in
its 230,000 world-wide work force. Usually, they're
accommodated at no cost and 25% of the time the adjustment
costs an average of $100, the company says. They tend to stay
at Marriott longer than other employees; the reduced turnover
more than makes up for any added training expenses, it says.</p>
<p>At a Marriott restaurant in Philadelphia a few years ago,
then-manager Laura Davis was so impressed with the work of
retarded and other disabled employees that she filled most of
the staff with handicapped workers. In 1988, the restaurant
was named Marriott's top store.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck & Co. says that 5.8%, or 20,300, of its
350,000 workers have identified themselves as disabled. Sears
has long taken the attitude that someone with a disability
can do any job at the company until it's proven otherwise,
says Paul Scher, a personnel placement official, who himself
is blind. Most disabled employees are accommodated at no
cost; about 10% need some help, at a typical cost of $20 to
$350. Sears did pay $12,000 each for two machines that "look"
at written material and read it aloud, for Mr. Scher and
another blind employee.</p>
<p>At Southwestern Bell Corp., Darrell Lauer, the
consumer-relations manager, who is also blind, was hired for
his expertise in consumer-protection matters. His secretary
or others read his mail and other papers to him, and he reads
and takes notes in Braille, all at little cost. "I was hired
for my abilities," he says. "That's what people want. Not to
be hired for their disabilities."</p>

<p>        For the Disabled, Jobs and Access</p>
<p>People who are "disabled" under the law are those with
physical or mental impairments that substantially limit one
or more of the major activities of life, such as walking or
talking. The term also applies to people with a record of
such an impairment, such as someone who has recovered from
cancer, as well as people "regarded" as having a disability,
such as a person with a disfiguring injury.</p>
<p>The bill, in addition to the provisions below, requires
public transit systems to provide access to the disabled and
compels phone companies to make non-voice telecommunication
devices available.</p>
