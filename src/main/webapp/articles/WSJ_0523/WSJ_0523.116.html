	<p class="article-leader">Computer Associates International Inc. said net income in
the fourth quarter ended March 31 rose 58%, as the Garden
City, N.Y., company began to recover from problems in merging
with Cullinet Software Inc., acquired in September.

million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose
1.6% to $363.7 million from $357.8 million. The 1989 figures
have been restated to reflect the Cullinet acquisition on a
pooling-of-interests basis.</p>

that most of the issues surrounding the acquisition of
Cullinet are now behind us."</p>
