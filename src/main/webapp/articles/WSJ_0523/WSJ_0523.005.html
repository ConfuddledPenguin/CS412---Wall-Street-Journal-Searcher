	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Foreign investors flush with cash went on a
bond buying spree yesterday, pushing bond prices higher in
moderate trading activity.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 3/4 point
yesterday, a gain of $7.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, eased to 8.61% from 8.68% on
Monday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Traders said the market started to climb early in the
morning as Arab and Japanese investors used proceeds from
some maturing Japanese government bonds to buy U.S. Treasury
securities.</p>
<p>Raymond Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy
Research Associates, estimates that $22 billion of Japanese
securities matured yesterday, providing fixed-income
investors with a huge amount of cash to re-invest.</p>
<p>Bonds were also supported by a story in yesterday's
Chicago Tribune, which suggested that the federal budget
deficit was smaller than official forecasts. Such news can
boost bond prices because investors reason that a smaller
deficit would reduce the government's borrowing needs and
would eventually lead to lower interest rates.</p>
<p>The story, which traders eventually discounted and
economists discredited, said that 13 federal agencies had
accumulated $50 billion in unspent appropriations. By
afternoon, analysts had concluded that the $50 billion did
not represent cash that could be applied to the government's
deficit.</p>
<p>Still, prices continued to climb due mainly to
short-covering by dealers. Traders said the short-covering
occurred as bond futures on the Chicago Board of Trade moved
through technical resistance levels. In a short sale, dealers
and professional traders sell borrowed securities and later
seek to make a profit by replacing what was borrowed with
cheaper securities. Essentially, these dealers are betting
that prices will fall. But when prices rise instead, many
dealers rush to cover the short before prices move any
higher.</p>
<p>Bond dealers said that yesterday's trading activity could
cast a positive light over the Treasury's notes sales, which
are scheduled to take place this week. The Treasury will sell
two-year notes today and five-year notes on Thursday.</p>
<p>In when-issued trading, the two-year Treasury notes were
quoted to yield 8.55%, compared with 8.61% on Monday. The
five-year notes set for sale Thursday were quoted to yield
8.59% compared with 8.68% late Monday.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>Continued buying interest by retail investors helped
sustain momentum in the junk-bond market, forcing prices of
speculative-grade issues higher once again.</p>
<p>Most junk bonds, or high-risk corporate bonds that have
low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, gained 1/4 to
1/2 point.</p>
<p>Pay-in-kind bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. continued to
outshine the broader high-yield market, recording gains of as
much as 7/8 point. Pay-in-kind bonds, which are extremely
volatile, pay interest in the form of more securities instead
of cash.</p>
<p>Market participants say the bullish sentiment, which first
hit the market's top-tier issues, is rapidly spreading to the
middle-tier and lower-tier names, which also registered
impressive gains this session.</p>
<p>Among the leading winners were junk bonds of Charter
Medical Inc. and McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. Charter
Medical's 14% senior subordinated debentures due in 2000,
chalked up one point to finish at 52 1/2 while McCaw
Cellular's 12.95% senior subordinated debentures, due in
1999, surged two points to end at 80 1/2.</p>
<p>Joseph Bencivenga, director and manager of high-yield
research at Salomon Brothers Inc., said that since
"high-quality, high-grade names do not have the upside
potential of the other two tiers of the market," many
investors are focusing less on these names and concentrating
more on the middle-tier and lower-tier junk bond issues.</p>
<p>"The bottom two tiers -- that's where the real value
lies," he said.</p>
<p>High-yield analysts said the junk bond market's recent
rise has been fueled by the relative scarcity of new issues
in which investors can reinvest cash interest income.</p>
<p>According to Robert Long, managing director and head of
high-yield research at First Boston Corp., about $6.5 billion
of cash interest income was generated from outstanding junk
bond issues during the first quarter.</p>
<p>In the absence of a heavy new-issue calendar, most of
these funds will have to be reinvested in the secondary
market.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Canadian bond prices plunged as investors reacted to
uncertainty over the outcome of the country's constitutional
debate.</p>
<p>Reports that a key minister in the Canadian government,
Lucien Bouchard, would resign from the Progressive
Conservative Party triggered the rout.</p>
<p>In a letter to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Mr. Bouchard
said he was strongly opposed to any change to the proposed
Meech Lake constitutional accord, which recognizes Quebec as
a "distinct society" within Canada.</p>
<p>The announcement follows the resignations of two other
Conservative Members of Parliament from Quebec.</p>
<p>Investors are concerned that if the accord fails to pass
by the June 23 deadline, Quebec will begin serious talk of
separating from the rest of Canada. Quebec independance would
create a large gray area about currency value, debt and
stability, analysts said.</p>
<p>Canadian bond prices sank as much as 2 3/8 points by
midafternoon. The market recovered slightly and the Canadian
20-year bellwether bond closed about 2 points lower at 89.00
to yield 10.82%.</p>
<p>Dan Gosselin, chief bond trader at Wood Gundy Inc., said
selling pressure was broadly based, but trading activity was
thin. The thin market conditions, he said, exaggerated the
decline. He calls the drop "significant" and said a decline
of this size hasn't occurred in "recent memory. I can't
recall a day being this bad."</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 101 15/32,
up from 100 20/32 on Monday. Ten-year notes ended at 101
15/32 to yield 8.63% compared with 100 27/32 to yield 8.73%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were little changed yesterday. The
discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended unchanged
from Monday's average auction of 7.74% for a bond-equivalent
yield of 7.98%. The rate on six-month bills was slightly
lower when compared to Monday's average auction. The rate
ended yesterday at 7.76% for a bond-equivalent yield of
8.17%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities ended as much as 3/8 point
firmer, reflecting Treasury gains.</p>
<p>Spreads widened slightly from late Monday, with Government
National Mortgage Association 9% bonds for June delivery now
yielding 1.13 percentage point more than 10-year Treasurys,
compared with a spread of 1.11 percentage point late Monday.</p>
<p>Ginnie Mae 9% issues for June delivery were last quoted at
95 19/32, up 3/8 point, to yield 9.78%.</p>
<p>Two new issues priced this session are said to have been
well bid.</p>
<p>In the mortgage-derivative market, Fannie Mae issued a
$300 million real estate mortgage investment conduit offering
backed by its 8.5% bonds via Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.</p>
<p>In the asset-backed arena, Citicorp's $1.41 billion issue
of global credit card-backed bonds priced in the morning was
all sold soon after its launch.</p>
<p>More than $625 million of securities were sold to non-U.S.
buyers.</p>
<p>Citicorp has made other credit-card issues to
international buyers, but those deals didn't allow
settlements in different markets. This issue was the first
that could be settled through the U.S. Depository Trust and
both Eurobond clearing agents, Euroclear and Cedel.</p>
<p>The issue was lead-managed by Salomon Brothers
International, and consisted of $1.25 billion of Tranche A
bonds carrying a 9 3/8% coupon that were priced to yield 0.80
percentage point over five-year Treasury notes. A much
smaller Tranche B, $155 million of 9 5/8% bonds, yielded one
percentage point over the five-year Treasury.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>Most investment-grade corporate bonds ended between 1/4
point and 1/2 point higher yesterday.</p>
<p>The major news in the market yesterday was that Moody's
Investors Service Inc. reduced Citicorp's senior-debt rating
to single-A-3 from single-A-1 and its commercial-paper rating
to Prime-2 from Prime-1.</p>
<p>Moody's cited Citicorp's comparatively low reserve and
capital levels and rising number of problem loans.</p>
<p>Analysts say the Moody's downgrade, which came late
yesterday, may have only a modest impact on the bonds during
trading today. Some expect spreads on Citicorp debt to widen
by about 0.1 percentage point.</p>
<p>"I think the {market's} expectation was probably {a
downgrade} of one notch with some chance of two," said Jay
Weintraub, a director in the corporate bond research
department at Salomon Brothers Inc. "This represents the
downside but was not totally unexpected."</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Tax-exempt issues were up 1/8 to 3/8 point in quiet, late
dealings, as they underperformed U.S. Treasurys.</p>
<p>While an early report of $50 billion in surplus U.S.
government funds was later discounted, Treasurys continued to
exhibit strength, which helped to pull municipals higher,
traders said.</p>
<p>However, with more than $1 billion in new issues priced,
activity during the session focused on the new issue market,
traders said.</p>
<p>In one of the largest deals of the session, a Bear Stearns
& Co. group set the preliminary pricing for an issue of $250
million of Connecticut special-tax, general-obligation,
transportation-infrastructure bonds, to yield from 6.10% in
1992 to 7.23% in 2007.</p>
<p>The bonds are rated single-A-1 by Moody's Investors
Service Inc. and double-A-minus by Standard & Poor's Corp.
and Fitch Investors Service Inc.</p>
<p>Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was up 3/8 point at 97 7/8 to
yield 7.37%.</p>
<p>No large competitive deals are expected to be priced
today.</p>
