	<p class="article-leader">British Airways PLC reported a 29% rise in pretax profit
for the year ended March 31, though sales rose a more modest
14% and the company warned of increasing pressure from
competition and slower growth in some of its major markets.
   The London-based carrier, which is Britain's biggest
airline, produced a pretax profit of #345 million in the
latest year, compared with #268 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net attributable to shareholders, or profit after taxes
and minority interests, increased 41% to #246 million from
#175 million. There were no extraordinary items in either
period.</p>
<p>Despite the buoyant earnings, British Airways Chairman
Lord King sounded a note of caution for the year ahead,
during which the airline intends to expand its fleet by 10%
and is committed to raising staff wages by 9.5%.</p>
<p>"We are aware that our costs require constant scrutiny,
particularly in view of the increasingly competitive nature
of the market we serve, and the softening of Western
economies," he said.</p>
