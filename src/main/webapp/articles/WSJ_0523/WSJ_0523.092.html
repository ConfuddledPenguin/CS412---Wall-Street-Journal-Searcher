	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Unable to sell debt in the battered public
junk-bond market, a growing number of corporations are
selling junk bonds in the private-placement market.
   Investment bankers say more than a dozen new junk-bond
issues are being negotiated in the $170 billion private
market, where insurance companies and other big investors buy
and sell securities free from public disclosure requirements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among the issues are high-risk, high-yield junk bonds of
Ethan Allen Inc., Colorado Prime, CaterAir, Jack Eckerd Corp.
and Multimedia Corp., according to Anthony Napolitano, a
McCarthy Crisanti & Maffei Inc. analyst who tracks the
private-placement market. Also on the private calendar is
Caldor Corp., a discount retailer that is expected to
privately place $300 million in junk bonds tomorrow. If
completed, the Caldor issue would be the largest junk issue
privately placed so far this year.</p>
<p>Most of these junk bonds were expected to be sold
publicly. But ever since the public junk-bond market hit hard
times last summer, the number of new issuess sold to the
public has quickly dwindled. So far this year, just four new
junk issues have been launched, raising a total of $382
million for corporate borrowers, according to Securities Data
Co. That is down sharply from the 46 issues totaling $11.35
billion that were sold publicly by this time a year ago.</p>
<p>Away from the glare of the public and the media,
investment bankers are "quietly approaching the big investors
looking for lead buyers," said Mr. Napolitano of McCarthy
Crisanti. Rather than scouring the country for buyers for
publicly traded junk bonds, the bankers instead have limited
their search to "Newark, Hartford, Boston and New York,"
where the nation's biggest insurance companies are based, he
says.</p>
<p>The big investors who buy debt in the private-placement
market get more control over how the deals are structured,
giving them more protection if the issuer gets into financial
trouble. In turn, the investors are accepting interest rates
on new private deals that are slightly lower than the rates
paid on comparable junk bonds sold in the public market.</p>
<p>"In the past six months, we've {accepted} rates in the
private market that have been a bit lower than those we could
have obtained in the public market," said Charles Morss, an
executive vice president at Boylston Capital Advisors, a
money-management subsidiary of The New England insurance
company.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Morss, added, "we get substantially stronger
covenants," particularly in guarding against early repayment
of bonds and takeovers and other "event risk" that could hurt
the value of a company's bonds. For example, he said that
insurance companies have become nearly as strict as
commercial banks these days in setting limits on the amount
of debt issuers can have without violating covenants.</p>
<p>One drawback to the private market is that it can't absorb
the large billion-dollar offerings that once were easily sold
during the public junk-bond market's heyday. Most private
transactions are smaller than $200 million.</p>
<p>The growing move by borrowers to the private market
represents a return to the historic roots of junk bonds.
Prior to the development of the public junk market, chiefly
by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its former junk-bond chief
Michael Milken, most low-rated corporate bonds were sold
privately to insurance companies. "That's the old style; it's
creeping back," Mr. Morss said.</p>
<p>The private market operates differently from the public
junk-bond sales. "In the private market, it is normal for
potential buyers to sit down with {investment bankers} and
negotiate" how the deal should look, said Garrett Moran,
manager of the high-yield department at Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Co. "In that sense, it's more work," he
said. However, Mr. Moran said that the private market opens
the doors to a larger group of potential investors.</p>
<p>To entice private investors, investment bankers at
Donaldson Lufkin restructured the Caldor deal significantly,
adding sweetners such as an equity stake, or so-called equity
kicker. Also, the size of the issue was cut to $300 million
from the $460 million originally planned.</p>
<p>Donaldson Lufkin couldn't comment on Caldor because the
issue hasn't closed yet. However, according to talk in the
market, the Caldor transaction now consists of $100 million
of 15% senior subordinated notes that include warrants giving
bondholders the right to buy 12% of the company. The issue
also includes $200 million of senior secured notes, equally
divided among notes that float at a rate 2.75 percentage
points above the London interbank offered rate and fixed-rate
12 7/8% notes.</p>
<p>For issuers like Caldor, the private market clearly offers
several advantages over the public market. To lure private
investors, investment bankers can customize terms. For
instance, floating-rate debt can be sold to one set of
buyers, and fixed-rate debt to another group.</p>
<p>Also, an issuer's costs -- both in terms of time and money
-- are much lower in the private market.</p>
<p>Each time a company seeks to change the terms of a pending
deal in the public market, it has to register the change with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the private
market, by contrast, deals can be restructured and overhauled
without re-registering with the SEC.</p>
<p>Fred Sutherland, vice president of corporate finance and
development at ARA Group Inc., which tapped the private
market with a $125 million junk issue last month, agrees that
the private market can save on both time and money.</p>
<p>"The reason we went the private route is because of the
uncertainty in the public market," said Mr. Sutherland. Also,
by "going the private route we could get the deal done much
more quickly -- it's a more streamlined process."</p>
<p>Mr. Sutherland said he isn't prepared to give "last rites"
to the public junk market, but he believes "the private
market, going forward, will play a more important role than
it has."</p>
