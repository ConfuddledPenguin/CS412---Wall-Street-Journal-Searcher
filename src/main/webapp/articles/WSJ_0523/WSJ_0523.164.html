	<p class="article-leader">The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. plans to start
swapping, in negotiated transactions, five-year balloon loans
with monthly payments based on a 30-year repayment
reschedule.
   The loans are attractive to starter-home buyers, military
families and others who plan to stay in a house for fewer
than five years. Freddie Mac expects investors to find
mortgage participation certificates backed by the loans
attractive because of their shorter duration and more
predictable maturity.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The interest rate on the loans is lower than rates for
regular 30-year loans. After five years, a borrower can repay
the loan, extend it, or refinance at a new fixed rate for 25
years. New rates under the extension or refinancing options
will be set at half a percentage point over the current
Freddie Mac 60-day required net yield. The rate increase is
capped at five percentage points over the original loan.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac, based in Reston, Va., is a
government-sponsored, publicly traded company that operates a
secondary market for mortgages, buying loans from lenders,
packaging them into securities and selling them to investors.</p>
<p>Separately, Freddie Mac said it bought $131 million in
loans on multifamily properties from Citicorp Mortgage Inc.,
which exchanged the loans for the same amount in Freddie Mac
multifamily mortgage participation certificates. Freddie Mac
said the 630 loans are secured by apartment buildings, mostly
small buildings with five to 12 units, in the Chicago area.</p>
<p>The company said it bought a $37 million multifamily loan
-- the largest it ever purchased -- from Globe Mortgage Co.
of Hackensack, N.J. The loan is for rental housing in
suburban Chicago.</p>
