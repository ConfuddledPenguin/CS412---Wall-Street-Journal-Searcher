	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. shuffled top management of
its magazine unit and created a subsidiary to oversee the
company's regional and special-interest properties and
overseas media development.
   Reginald K. Brack, chairman of Time Inc. Magazines, said
the new subsidiary, Time Publishing Ventures Inc., also will
be used to study magazines offered for sale to Time Warner.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There are more magazines up for sale today, I suspect,
than ever in history," Mr. Brack said. "We want to be
organized so we can study these offers. With all that's for
sale out there, all of it starts here."</p>
<p>Time Inc. Magazines is the largest U.S. magazine
publisher. In the past five years, its number of magazines
has grown to 36 from eight, though some of the recently
acquired properties are jointly owned. Time last week said it
will close Southpoint, a regional magazine based in Atlanta,
but it continues to develop new magazines, such as Time For
Kids, European editions of Sports Illustrated, and Spanish
and German versions of Fortune magazine.</p>
<p>Christopher Meigher, executive vice president of Time Inc.
Magazines, was named president and chief executive officer of
Time Publishing Ventures. The division consists of the
Birmingham, Ala.-based Southern Progress Corp., publisher of
Southern Living, Cooking Light, and Southern Accent, among
others; it also includes many of the special-interest
magazines the company has acquired or established in the past
two years, such as Parenting and In Health, and Sunset, a
magazine Time Warner has said it will purchase from Lane
Publishing Co. for $225 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Brack said other shifts in the company's management
are being made to "revolve around customers' interests and
perceptions." Donald E. Elliman, an executive vice president,
will head a new "entertainment group," consisting of People
and Entertainment Weekly. Robert Miller, an executive vice
president, will be head of the "news, sports, and business
and money groups." The news group consists of Time and Life
magazines; the sports group, Sports Illustrated and Sports
Illustrated for Kids; and the business group, Fortune and
Money magazines.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Time Warner shares closed at $100.125, up 87.5 cents.</p>
