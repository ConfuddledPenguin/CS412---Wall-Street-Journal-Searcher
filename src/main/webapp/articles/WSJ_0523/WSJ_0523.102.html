	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Mitsubishi Industrial Group and Daimler-Benz AG
are quickly moving ahead with plans for global cooperation.
   Yesterday, Yoshio Taniguchi, vice president of Mitsubishi
Corp., the trading company at the center of Japan's largest
industrial groupings, said that the Mitsubishi Group has
received seven proposals for cooperation from the
Daimler-Benz side. In response, Mitsubishi Corp. said it will
establish a department within the trading concern to handle
project development with the West German conglomerate. Mr.
Taniguchi will head the new department.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The speed {of the talks} is much faster than we
expected," said Masao Takemoto, a Mitsubishi Corp. spokesman.</p>
<p>As a result, top leaders of the two international groups
may meet again as early as September to discuss further
plans. Originally, the two groups were slated to meet again
next March, one year after initial talks for the agreement
were announced. So far, all the proposals seem to have
originated with Daimler-Benz. Mitsubishi has been reluctant
to talk about its own ideas.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi officials confirmed that the West German
business giant has asked Mitsubishi to supply construction
and factory equipment for an auto production plant in the
Soviet Union. Daimler-Benz is negotiating with the Soviet
government to produce between 240,000 and 300,000 automobiles
annually at a plant to be built in Gorky, on the outskirts of
Moscow. Mr. Takemoto said Mitsubishi has agreed in principle
to the project and will support it as a supplier of material
and equipment.</p>
<p>In another request, Daimler-Benz has asked Mitsubishi
Motors Corp. to cooperate on technology transfer of small
truck production for a truck plant in East Germany.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz also wants Mitsubishi Motors to help it make
further inroads into the Japanese domestic market.
Daimler-Benz has asked the Japanese auto maker to help with
the production and sale in Japan of a new 2.5-ton to 3.5-ton
van that the West Germans are currently developing. Again,
Mitsubishi Motors said it is still considering the plan.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz has also asked Mitsubishi to supply auto
parts to its Asian subsidiaries. Mitsubishi officials said
the other proposals called for cooperation on semiconductor
factories, aerospace and aircraft leasing.</p>
