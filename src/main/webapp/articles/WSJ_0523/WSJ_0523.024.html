	<p class="article-leader">Undaunted by mid-day profit-taking, over-the-counter
stocks crept higher in the year's second busiest session.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1 to 453.89, a 0.2% gain,
after slipping 0.50 in profit-taking earlier in the day.
Volume rose to 190.1 million shares from 169.6 million
Monday. Advancing shares again led declining stocks, 1,091 to
901, and issues hitting new highs continued to outnumber
those reaching new lows, 205 to 63.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Every time the market rests, it seems to come back," said
Peter Coolidge, senior trader at Kidder Peabody. The prospect
of stable or even lower interest rates remains "the
overriding factor" reassuring investors, he explained.</p>
<p>As for OTC bargains, PaineWebber investment strategist
Mary Farrell said in an interview that she doesn't expect
small stocks to show a "terrific" performance
across-the-board. However, she cited evidence that companies
with a strong competitive position in specialty niches are
outperforming the OTC market and keeping up with the Dow's
blue chip stocks.</p>
<p>For example, she cited Allen Group, a maker of clean-air
testing equipment and cellular telephones, which is up 57%
since the end of 1989; A.L. Labs, a specialty pharmaceutical
concern, is up 18%; Giddings & Lewis, a maker of machine
tools, is up 17%; AST Research, which makes IBM-compatible
personal computers, is up 136%; and Centocor, a biotechnology
concern, is up 59%.</p>
<p>Ms. Farrell said she's advising investors interested in
smaller stocks to buy the shares of specialty companies with
high visibility and estimated earnings growth of 12% to 15% a
year. That's about double the growth she expects from the
stocks in the S&P 500 and well ahead of the 2% increase in
the gross national product she's expecting in both 1990 and
1991.</p>
<p>Technology stocks continued to fuel the market's gains.
Intel gained 1/2 to 46; Apple Computer rebounded 1 7/8 to 41
3/8 and Oracle added 1/8 to 18 3/4.</p>
<p>Microsoft, which unveiled its long-awaited Windows 3.0
software, climbed 1 1/4 to 71 1/2. Micropolis, a Chatsworth,
Calif., maker of disk drives, set a 52-week high after
Shearson Lehman Hutton analyst Doug van Dorsten raised his
short-term investment opinion on the stock to a "weak buy"
from a "hold," Dow Jones Professional Investor Report said.
The stock made the most actives list as 1.4 million shares
changed hands, nearly 10 times average volume.</p>
<p>Sensormatics Electronics lost 1 to 13 3/4 on 1.5 million
shares after a group including Fort Worth, Texas, investors
Sid and Lee Bass said it lowered its stake to 2.4% of
outstanding common shares in the Deerfield Beach, Fla.,
electronics equipment maker.</p>
<p>Astec Industries gained 5/8 to 6 1/8. A jury awarded $4.4
million to another company, CMI Corp., in a patent
infringement suit against a subsidiary of Astec, a
Chattanooga, Tenn., maker of construction equipment. CMI had
asked for $15 million to $38 million in damages.</p>
<p>American Film Technologies climbed 1 to 10 1/2 after the
Wayne, Pa., color imaging and film distributor said late
Monday that it hired investment banker Morgan Stanley & Co.
to assess strategic possibilities, including a merger.</p>
<p>Two of the eight publicly traded funds originally
sponsored by VMS Realty Partners of Chicago rose after a
spokesman said they may resume cash distributions. VMS
Strategic Land Trust rose 7/8 to 3 3/4; VMS Strategic Land
Fund II edged up 3/8 to 2 3/4.</p>
<p>Together, VMS Strategic Land Trust and VMS Strategic Land
Fund II gained full repayment of about $100 million of loans
to their former sponsor, according to Leonard G. Levine,
president of the eight funds. The land trust now claims a
book value of $6.85 and the land fund quotes its book value
at $6.32.</p>
<p>Immunex jumped 1 1/2 to 19 1/2 after a researcher
favorably reviewed data from trials of GM-CSF, a drug to
stimulate white-blood-cell production made by the Seattle
company, according to DJPIR. The review is part of this
week's meeting in Washington of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology.</p>
<p>But profit-taking sideswiped several stocks, among them
Immunex competitor Amgen, which slipped 1 3/4 to 71 1/4, and
Autodesk, down 1 1/4 to 51.</p>
<p>Kidder Peabody biotechnology analyst Robert Kupor lowered
his rating on shares of Amgen, a Thousand Oaks, Calif.,
biotechnology concern, to a "hold" from an "attractive"
because the stock had become too high-priced, Mr. Coolidge
said. However, PaineWebber analyst Linda Miller repeated her
"attractive" rating on the stock after a researcher favorably
reviewed Neupogen, Amgen's drug that stimulates
white-blood-cell production, according to DJPIR. The stock's
52-week high is 73 3/4.</p>
<p>Autodesk, coming off a 52-week high, dropped 1 1/4 to 51
after the Sausalito, Calif., maker of design and drafting
software reported net income for the first quarter ended
April 30 of 55 cents a share, up from 45 cents a year
earlier.</p>
<p>FSI International dropped 1/2 to 4 3/4. Citing a cyclical
slowdown in the market for semiconductor equipment, the
Minneapolis concern said Monday it expects to report an
unspecified loss for the third quarter ending Saturday,
compared with net income of 20 cents a share a year earlier.</p>
<p>ChemDesign tumbled 2 to 11\ after the Fitchburg, Mass.,
specialty-chemical maker said Tuesday it expects sales for
the second quarter ending in June will be flat with sales of
$10 million in the yearago quarter and of $10.4 million in
this year's first quarter. ChemDesign's chief financial
officer, Jay R. LaMarche, said the company doesn't expect to
continue the nearly 39% gross margin rate in the first
quarter, but still expects margin rates to be "generally
higher" than in 1989.</p>
<p>Southeastern Michigan Gas Enterprises slipped 2 1/4 to 15
3/4 after its Southeastern Michigan Gas utility received an
unfavorable ruling from the Michigan Public Service
Commission.</p>
