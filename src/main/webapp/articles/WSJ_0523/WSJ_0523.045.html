	<p class="article-leader">WINNETKA, Ill. -- People here love a good mystery.
   The Winnetka Paper, a biweekly, recently featured a
long-running mystery serial, "Manuscript for Murder." "It
lost me," says publisher Susan Murges. But Winnetkans
relished it, she adds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Then there is the conundrum involving a flock of flamingo
lawn ornaments, which appear, and disappear, in Melinda
Andrews's yard. That has been another good mystery for
Winnetkans to chew over.</p>
<p>But a real murder is different. It shocks and silences. Or
does it?</p>
<p>On the night of Saturday, April 7, this quiet, affluent
town along the shore of Lake Michigan became the scene of a
double homicide. The victims, Richard and Nancy Langert, had
gone to a birthday party in honor of her father, M. Lee
Bishop. The next day Mr. Bishop found their bodies in the
cellar of their rented townhouse, just 200 yards from
Winnetka police headquarters. Richard, 257 pounds and 30
years old, had been shot in the back of his neck. Nancy, 25,
was shot twice in the stomach.</p>
<p>The killer, or killers, left about $500 untouched in her
purse. There was no sign of sexual aim and no hint of motive.
Mrs. Langert had scrawled an unfinished message in blood
before dying. Only two letters were legible, and police won't
say what they are. The only other clues are some fingerprints
and a garment (which police won't identify), apparently left
behind by the murderer.</p>
<p>That's as much as anyone in town really knows. The rest is
speculation, theories as exotic as those in fiction, spun by
a troubled populace. Some conjecture that this seemingly
innocent couple, expecting a child and soon to move into a
new house, led a double life. Suspicions abound that the
Langerts were linked to an eerie substrata of intrigue and
violence. In a weird and sad way, it is almost as if
Winnetkans, accustomed to the prosaic and mundane, are
creating their own Midwestern version of "Twin Peaks," which
had its TV debut the day the Langerts' bodies were
discovered.</p>
<p>"It's the strangest case I have seen," says Herbert Timm,
the police chief here and himself a victim of the town rumor
mill. "We're shaking our heads. The more you know, the more
bewildering it is. I have to live with that, and a lot of
sleepless nights."</p>
<p>Mr. Timm has his own bizarre ideas of who killed the
Langerts. In one, he has them linked to a Colombian drug ring
through their employer, Gloria Jean's Coffee Bean Corp., a
gourmet coffee store franchiser headquartered nearby. Mr.
Timm wonders whether Gloria Jean's employees may have been
importing cocaine, hidden under coffee beans, and whether the
Langerts were either part of the scheme or about to blow the
whistle. A spokesman for the company says it doesn't import
coffee from Colombia, or anywhere else. It is also
cooperating fully with police.</p>
<p>Some locals talk up the Mafia "juice loan" theory: "They
could have borrowed a few thousand dollars from a loan
shark," says Barrie Heath, president of an antique store,
then been unable to pay back the exorbitant interest. The
police haven't ruled this out, either.</p>
<p>Winnetkans may be embracing these wild conjectures "as a
kind of denial," says Jeanne Bradner, president of the
village council. "People are relieved to have police say it
may be a professional hit man. At least we know we don't have
a homicidal maniac on our hands."</p>
<p>But such assurances don't go far, particularly with no
suspects in sight. Suddenly, many Winnetkans are worrying
that their refuge isn't what it seemed. Some are locking
their doors for the first time. Says Mr. Timm, "This has been
Camelot for a lot of years to many people. America, the way
it ought to be. But maybe it's just America the way it really
is."</p>
<p>Winnetka is usually far removed from the horrors of crime.
Its average household income of $100,000 is reputed to be the
highest of any town in the country. It has no industry. Many
among the 14,000 populace are lawyers, financiers or
securities brokers, who ride a double-decker train 20 miles
south to Chicago each day.</p>
<p>Banks serve coffee and doughnuts on Saturday mornings. The
McDonald's is appointed in stained glass. Police headquarters
offers brochures on such concerns as: "Parties" (a parental
guide), "Dealing With Problem Wildlife" (chipmunks) and
"Vanity and Personalized License Plates." A new village
council circular tackles the local deer menace, asking if
antlers are a threat to shrubbery.</p>
<p>Yet violence isn't a total stranger here. In 1988, a
30-year-old babysitter with a history of mental problems shot
six pupils, killing one, at the Hubbard Woods School, police
said. But that murder chase quickly ended when the babysitter
committed suicide. The Langert case, like the only other
unsolved murder the town ever had, in 1884, "leaves people
hanging," says Mr. Timm. "We must put it to rest."</p>
<p>But no one can. Winnetkans are consumed by the murder and
all its related intrigues. One rumor around town involves the
police chief. Gossip has it that Mr. Timm, of all people, is
the secret love child of the late Rock Hudson. The Star, a
supermarket tabloid, recently published a speculative story
that has residents buzzing.</p>
<p>Mr. Hudson, whose real name was Roy Fitzgerald, grew up in
Winnetka. Mr. Timm, whose new nickname is "Fitz," was born
about the time the movie star -- by some unnamed accounts --
fathered a child by a Winnetka woman he didn't marry. "It's
hilarious, but I look nothing like him. It would be more
believable if they said I was Jimmy Durante's secret son,"
says Mr. Timm.</p>
<p>Residents may be getting a little fanciful. But the same
accusation could be lodged against Mr. Timm, a 47-year-old
ex-Chicago cop with the sartorial tastes of a banker. He
shows little interest in routine resolutions to his case.
Already, he has sent investigators as far as to New York to
check leads, and his imagination seems boundless. "We're
ruling nothing out. We have several avenues -- each more
interesting than the next. This case has a lot of meat to
it," he says.</p>
<p>The chief won't comment specifically on all the trails he
is following, but one is known to involve some connection to
combatants in Northern Ireland. "It could be the Catholics or
the Protestants," says one of his aides.</p>
<p>Some in town say Mr. Timm has been reading too much
fiction. He is among the residents who crowd Scotland Yard, a
bookstore dealing exclusively in mysteries and featuring a
manikin dressed like Sherlock Holmes. Judy Duhl, the owner,
says mysteries sell big "because, unlike in real life,
there's a resolution to problems. Too often in the real world
there aren't answers -- like in the Langert case."</p>
<p>Mr. Timm buys mysteries for himself and his three
children. One of his recent purchases was "Fatal Command," a
potboiler about Mafia-connected crimes in a seemingly chaste
California burg. Joseph McNamara, the author and a police
chief himself, sympathizes with Mr. Timm's predicament. "Some
cases are so inexplicable they never get solved."</p>
<p>A year ago, Mr. Timm drew fire from the village council
for proposing that his men be equipped with Uzi submachine
guns. He later triggered a blast of bad public relations by
accidently firing a pistol into his office wall.</p>
<p>Now, though, locals must turn to him to solve this grim
crime.</p>
<p>Privately, some relatives of the Langerts scoff at Mr.
Timm's titillating explanations for the deaths of the couple.
Says a friend, "They were so square; they didn't even drink."
Nancy Langert comes from one of Winnetka's most respected
families. Her father is a corporate attorney; her mother is
among the community's leading volunteer workers.</p>
<p>So what happened? A legal source close to the case
theorizes that the solution may be the one Winnetkans dread
most: Burglars hopped the train up from Chicago and left at
the station a few feet from the darkened Langert townhouse.
They chose the secluded corner unit and broke the lock on the
rear patio door. Surprised by the returning Langerts, they
killed the couple in a panic.</p>
<p>Mr. Timm isn't buying that resolution. For now, he keeps
breakfasting on French toast at the Pretty Good Cafe, where
the murder is avidly discussed and dissected. Says Gail
Forsberg, the owner, "Winnetka people have their ducks in a
row. A double-murder moves those ducks around, and people
don't like that."</p>
