	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Galactic Resources Ltd.
proposed to acquire Cornucopia Resources Ltd. through a stock
swap, with an indicated value of about 33 million Canadian
dollars (US$28 million).
   Galactic, a gold producer with mines in South Carolina and
Colorado, said it proposed to issue half of one Galactic
common share for each share currently outstanding of
Cornucopia, an exploration concern with large land holdings
in Nevada's Carlin gold district.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Galactic currently has about 36.1 million common shares
outstanding; Cornucopia has about 19.4 million shares issued.
On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Galactic last traded
at C$3.40 a share, before trading was halted for the
announcement. Cornucopia's shares last traded at C$1.70 each.</p>
<p>Galactic said the final share ratio would be subject to
negotiation, receipt of a fairness opinion from Galactic's
financial advisers, and regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Galactic and Cornucopia are currently joint owners of the
Ivanhoe gold project in Nevada, which is expected to produce
about 60,000-70,000 ounces of gold next year, after a US$10
million development plan is completed.</p>
<p>Cornucopia officials weren't immediately available for
comment.</p>
