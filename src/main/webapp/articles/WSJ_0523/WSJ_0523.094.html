	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- In a victory for banking regulators, a federal
bankruptcy judge preliminarily accepted arguments by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. that First RepublicBank Corp.
improperly diverted assets from its subsidiary banks before
they failed in 1988.
   The ruling, by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Steven Felsenthal,
holds that First RepublicBank appeared to transfer
approximately $130.7 million in assets, through intra-company
dividends and other means, from certain subsidiary banks at a
time when their financial condition was deteriorating
rapidly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The immediate effect of the ruling was to increase
significantly the FDIC's voice in the pending vote on the
company's plan to emerge from Chapter 11 proceedings. The
FDIC earlier won the right to vote $51 million in claims
against the debtor. That vote will be increased by the $130.7
million in claims allowed by Judge Felsenthal.</p>
<p>The FDIC had asked that it be allowed to vote a total of
approximately $274 million in claims stemming from First
RepublicBank's alleged diversion of assets from the banks.
The judge allowed claims involving the payment of dividends
and the modification of certain contracts between the holding
company and the banks, but disallowed others, including the
claim that the holding company paid too little when it bought
the credit-card operations of its member banks.</p>
<p>The decision was made only for the purposes of determining
the FDIC's voting power and isn't binding on future disputes
between the agency and other parties to the bankruptcy-law
case.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the FDIC said the ruling plowed new legal
ground because the judge held that First RepublicBank had a
"heightened fiduciary duty" to preserve the value of the
banking units for the benefit of the banks' creditors and
depositors. First RepublicBank had argued that its fiduciary
duty was to shareholders and creditors of the holding
company.</p>
<p>"His rulings on the law were brave," said Jeffrey W. Hurt,
a lawyer for the FDIC who said previous case law stems from
bank failures in the 1890s and 1930s. "It's the clearest
delineation of the fiduciary duty of an owner to a subsidiary
{bank} that I've found," he added.</p>
<p>But attorneys for creditors and the company downplayed the
significance. "I think that's wishful thinking on the FDIC's
part," said Martin Bienenstock, a lawyer for certain
creditors. He said the company hasn't yet presented all the
facts in the case. "When the issue is fully litigated, I
think the FDIC will lose both factually and legally," he
added.</p>
<p>Hugh Ray, an attorney for the senior unsecured creditors,
said the creditors can take comfort in the judge's language
because he disallowed more of the FDIC's claims than he
allowed. "Basically, he {the judge} said there's no duty to
run a holding company for the benefit of the FDIC, and also
that {a holding company} can't strip banks of assets," he
said.</p>
<p>In a separate proceeding in U.S. district court here, the
FDIC is seeking to be allowed to vote an additional $1
billion in claims stemming from a loan the agency made to
First RepublicBank's Dallas and Houston banks before they
failed.</p>
<p>Apart from the FDIC claims, First RepublicBank and a
subsidiary, IFRB Corp., list senior unsecured claims totaling
$673.3 million. Creditors' attorneys said they believe the
company's reorganization plan will pass despite FDIC
opposition because all creditors committees have now approved
it. The plan would allow the company to emerge from Chapter
11 protection before paying any of the claims made by the
FDIC by setting up a fund to pay the agency after various
lawsuits are settled. Eventually, the plan calls for the
company to liquidate itself.</p>
<p>First RepublicBank -- which isn't related to First
Republic Bancorp. Inc. of San Francisco -- and IFRB list
assets, apart from claims that are contingent on the outcome
of litigation, totaling $384 million.</p>
