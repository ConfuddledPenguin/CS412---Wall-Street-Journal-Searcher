	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The prospects for a mandatory
seafood-inspection program improved greatly as a Senate panel
voted to put the nation's $30 billion seafood industry under
a triad of regulatory agencies.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee approved a bipartisan
bill that would give the Agriculture Department the lead in
inspecting 1,900 seafood processors nationwide. Currently,
only a fraction of the four billion pounds of seafood
consumed each year in the U.S. undergoes some form of
product-grading or inspection.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consumer advocates are optimistic that a mandatory
inspection bill will be passed this year. Yesterday's
unanimous vote marked the first time in more than 20 years
that they have succeeded in getting such a bill out of
committee.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it wasn't a complete victory for them. The
committee, in a 10-9 vote, deleted provisions designed to
protect from reprisals company whistleblowers who tip off
government inspectors about unsanitary conditions or
contaminated products. Ellen Haas, executive director of
Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, a consumer group,
assailed the lawmakers for weakening the legislation and
predicted a floor fight over the issue of whistleblower
protection.</p>
<p>The measure, sponsored by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell (D., Maine.) and co-sponsored by 29 other senators,
"has a lot of horsepower behind it," says Richard Gutting,
lobbyist for the National Fisheries Institute, the industry's
leading trade group. From his perspective, he adds, "it's a
good, solid bill" that can be improved upon.</p>
<p>Yet to be reconciled are differences between Mr.
Mitchell's measure and a seafood-inspection bill now pending
in the Senate Commerce Committee, which would make the
Commerce Department's National Marine Fisheries Service the
lead regulatory agency.</p>
<p>In the House, Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell
(D., Mich.) and Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la
Garza (D., Texas) are pushing rival bills. Their battle
essentially is a fight over turf. Mr. Dingell would give the
lead to the Food and Drug Administration, which his committee
oversees, while Mr. de la Garza would give the lead to the
Agriculture Department, which falls under the Agriculture
panel's jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Mr. Dingell's bill easily cleared the Commerce Committee
in March and awaits floor action.</p>
<p>The Agriculture Department already inspects meat and
poultry for bacterial and chemical contaminants, among other
things. The Mitchell bill would add fish and seafood to its
duties. It also would empower the FDA to set limits on
bacteria and other contaminants, and it would give the
Fisheries Service authority to close polluted waters to
fishing and to shellfish harvesting.</p>
<p>Currently, Agriculture Department inspectors are posted at
beef, pork, lamb and poultry slaughterhouses whenever they
are in operation. Under the Mitchell bill, there wouldn't be
continuous inspection of seafood processing plants. Instead,
inspectors would make unannounced visits at seafood plants
and focus mostly on so-called critical control points. They
would look to plant workers for information on improper or
unsanitary practices when they aren't there.</p>
<p>For this reason, consumer advocates regard whistleblower
protection as indispensible. "You either have to have
continuous inspection or you have to have protection of those
workers," asserted consumer advocate Carol Tucker Foreman.</p>
<p>But Sen. Thad Cochran (R., Miss.) persuaded his colleagues
to strike whistleblower protection from the bill. He argued
that the provision would delegate too much power to workers,
including the right to refuse to work if they believe there
was a food-safety violation.</p>
<p>Consumer advocates also criticized the committee for not
providing for inspection of fishing vessels, a task they
would entrust to the Fisheries Service.</p>
