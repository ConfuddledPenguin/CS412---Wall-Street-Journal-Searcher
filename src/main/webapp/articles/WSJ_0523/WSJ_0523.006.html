	<p class="article-leader">As the principal sponsor of the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, I
was surprised to read your claims that recent legislation I
introduced would "repeal the law's only reason for being, to
encourage development of drugs for rare diseases" ("Waxman
Threatens Orphans," Review & Outlook, May 8). Since 1983, the
law has worked very well in encouraging investment in drugs
for rare diseases -- those affecting fewer than 200,000
people. Today, 45 orphan drugs have been approved by the Food
and Drug Administration, and human trials are under way on an
additional 133.
   The theory of the act is that certain diseases have
populations so small the usual market incentives are not
enough to stimulate investment. The act provides grants, tax
credits and seven years of market exclusivity to any company
willing to make the investment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In most cases, companies investing in orphan drugs have
made at most a modest profit. In those instances, the act has
worked as intended. But at hearings held by our subcommittee,
witnesses identified two serious problems.</p>
<p>First, under the act, the determination as to whether a
disease is rare is made close to the time that research is
begun, rather than when the drug is placed on the market. In
the case of AIDS, which has a rapidly growing population,
drug companies have known for years that the population is
likely to exceed the 200,000 level in the near future. No one
can claim AIDS is an orphan disease for which we need to give
incentives to invest in this research. Therefore, we should
allow the FDA to look to the future in deciding whether the
200,000 threshold has been surpassed, for AIDS or any similar
disease. An amendment to do this should bring down the price
of certain AIDS drugs.</p>
<p>The second problem is trickier. In three instances, the
profit potential was so clear from the beginning that two or
more companies were eager to invest. In one case, sales will
reach $200 million in 1991, virtually all underwritten by the
federal government, and the other two products have
comparably large markets. These figures translate to very
high prices to patients.</p>
<p>If our only goal were research, then we would not be
concerned about the fact that the Orphan Drug Act creates a
seven-year monopoly for these blockbuster products. But we
also must be concerned about drug prices. The societal value
of innovative drugs is diminished drastically when they cost
more than most people can pay. Patent laws are in place to
protect drug innovators; a law for rare diseases should not
be distorted to give companies a windfall at the expense of
patients.</p>
<p>The act should continue to apply with full force to the
orphan drugs that have only one sponsor. It would continue to
stimulate research on drugs for rare diseases. But where a
drug's profit potential is so great that it has many parents
competing to invest in its future, it is no orphan and should
not have protection against price competition.</p>
<p>Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D., Calif.)</p>
<p>Washington</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>In a strained effort to deify profit you performed a grave
disservice to millions of sufferers from rare diseases. You
stated that the organization I represent, the National
Organization for Rare Disorders, is "delighted with the law
as it is." This implies we oppose the Waxman amendment, but
this is incorrect. Our directors and voluntary health agency
members voted unanimously to support the amendment.</p>
<p>You ignored the fact that while certain drug firms have
made a rich profit as a result of the law, some of that
profit has been at the expense of victims of certain rare
diseases who are forced to pay up to $30,000 a year for the
drugs.</p>
<p>The intent of the law is to give incentives to companies
to develop "drugs of little commercial value" for small
populations of sufferers who might otherwise be ignored. In
the main, it has worked very well. But in some cases, four or
more companies simultaneously developed the same drug (hardly
indicating a lack of commercial motivation), and the first to
push its application across the FDA finish line has been
granted a monopoly while patients have had to pay
monopolistic prices.</p>
<p>The Waxman amendment would close such unintended loopholes
while preserving all major incentives and thus would make a
very good law even better.</p>
<p>Abbey S. Meyers</p>
<p>Executive Director</p>
<p>National Organization for Rare Disorders</p>
<p>New Fairfield, Conn.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>You imply that research incentives are threatened by Rep.
Waxman's proposal to permit shared exclusivity where more
than one company has simultaneously developed an orphan
product. It is our belief at Memorial Sloan-Kettering that
the incentive to undertake research projects is much more
threatened by the prospect of being absolutely foreclosed
from the market simply because another company obtains first
approval from the FDA, possibly for reasons unrelated to the
quality of either the product or the supporting data.</p>
<p>In the case of aerosol pentamidine, Memorial
Sloan-Kettering researchers were the first to explore its use
as a prophylaxis for AIDS-related pneumonia and were ahead of
the competition at virtually every juncture. However, the
FDA, employing a standard far less stringent than that which
was required relative to Memorial's application, approved the
competitor's application first. As a result, under the
current terms of the Orphan Drug Act, the competitor has been
allowed seven years' exclusivity through 1996.</p>
<p>The net effect of the FDA's approving orphan-drug status
to the competitor is that AIDS patients who are at high risk
for pneumonia and the American public will now bear an
unnecessary increased cost for the drug and its delivery
system.</p>
<p>In these times of constricting research resources, many
institutions like Memorial Sloan-Kettering will certainly
give serious consideration to limiting institutional
resources for the support of research programs where the
likelihood of transfer of research results to patent
application is likely to be limited because of uncertainties
of the application of the law.</p>
<p>The Orphan Drug Act can be improved greatly by correcting
its few shortcomings. The Waxman amendment goes a great
distance in addressing these.</p>
<p>James S. Quirk</p>
<p>Senior Vice President</p>
<p>Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</p>
<p>New York</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>You were right on target. We are dismayed that Congress
would consider breaking its covenant with pharmaceutical
pioneers such as AMGEN, which did the crucial research to
create orphan drugs that now provide hope to thousands
suffering from rare diseases.</p>
<p>As you pointed out, debate now centers on the fact that
AMGEN and other companies are supposedly reaping undeserved
"profits" under the marketing-exclusivity provisions of the
Orphan Drug Act. Let me clarify AMGEN's situation.</p>
<p>AMGEN spent eight years and more than $100 million to
develop the genetically engineered drug Epogen (Epoetin alfa)
to treat anemia in kidney-dialysis patients. Epogen is the
only drug currently available to treat this type of anemia
and is also AMGEN'S only product on the market. Yet for the
first time this quarter, AMGEN will recover the remainder of
its prior losses and realize a profit, despite the enormous
investment of private capital and scientific effort we
devoted to developing Epogen. The expectation of orphan-drug
exclusivity was critical to our ability to attract the kind
of investment needed to pursue this breakthrough therapy, and
our investors should be allowed to receive a reasonable
return.</p>
<p>Finally, to argue that the Orphan Drug Act automatically
creates monopolies is not accurate. The exclusivity provision
granted any one company applies only to its use to treat a
specific condition and not to the drug itself. For example,
while AMGEN has an exclusive FDA orphan-drug license for the
use of Epogen for treating chronic renal failure anemia, our
competitors could obtain FDA licenses for the use of Epogen
on patients with cancer, AIDS or rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<p>The existing orphan-drug law encourages pioneers such as
AMGEN to develop drugs for rare diseases and discourages
copycat development of the same drug for the same rare
diseases. Rep. Waxman's bill would reverse these incentives,
encouraging copycat companies and discouraging pioneers.
Which is in the best interest of patients?</p>
