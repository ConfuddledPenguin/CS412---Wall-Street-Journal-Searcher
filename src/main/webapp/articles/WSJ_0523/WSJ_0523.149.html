	<p class="article-leader">Dayton Hudson Corp. said its planned purchase of Marshall
Field & Co. for $1.04 billion will be delayed because of a
request for more information from the Federal Trade
Commission, which examines such proposed combinations to see
if they violate antitrust laws.
   The Minneapolis-based retailer said that interest expense
and depreciation tied to the planned purchase of Marshall
Field would reduce earnings for the current fiscal second
quarter by an unspecified amount. But it said that "strong
profit improvement" from its core businesses would offset the
reduction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dayton Hudson said it was confident the purchase of
Chicago-based Marshall Field would be completed, despite the
delay.</p>
<p>For the first quarter ended May 5, the company said that
brisk sales at its three retail store operating companies
boosted earnings before accounting changes to $58 million, or
70 cents a fully diluted share, from $40 million, or 51 cents
a fully diluted share, a year earlier.</p>
