	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A powerful rally in bonds helped lift stock
prices that were sagging under profit-taking.
   The Dow Jones Industrial closed 7.55 points higher at a
record 2852.23 on heavy volume. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond
prices rose nearly three-quarters of a point, or $7.50 for
each $1,000 of face amount, also in active trading. The
dollar was mixed, rising against the West German mark as
traders reassessed the eventual cost of German reunification.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said bond prices rose sharply early in the day on
rumors that $50 billion in unspent congressional
appropriations might be available to trim the deficit. The
rally got another boost from buying by Mideastern and
Japanese investors who invested proceeds from maturing
Japanese government bonds in U.S. Treasurys.</p>
<p>The buoyancy in bonds sent stock prices shooting up at the
opening bell, but profittaking on the runup killed most of
the gain and left stocks trading in a narrow range the rest
of the day. A last-minute rally pushed the blue chips to
gains.</p>
<p>"The linkage between interest rates and stocks is
powerful," said Byron Wien, U.S. investment strategist at
Morgan Stanley. "When the long bond went through 9% {a few
weeks ago}, the bears got confident about their bearishness.
Then rates came back down. That, plus positive talk about the
{reducing the} budget {deficit}, started scaring the bears."</p>
<p>Jon Groveman, president of investment bankers Ladenburg,
Thalmann & Co., attributed the early stock surge to "a very
emotional, desperate opening on the part of investors who'd
been out of the market and were feeling left behind."</p>
<p>Besides profit-taking, which many analysts termed healthy,
stocks were held in check by declines in the Dow Jones
transportation and utilities average. Also, Kenneth Spence,
director of Salomon Brothers' technical analysis group, said
there is resistance in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index at
the 360 level; it closed yesterday at 358.43, up 0.43.</p>
<p>"The market is on cruise control, and that's where it'll
stay until a bullet comes along," James D. Wright, chief
investment officer at Banc One Asset Management, Columbus,
Ohio. "When the bullet arrives, it'll knock it down hard."</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose in heavy trading. Volume surged to 203.4
million shares on the New York Stock Exchange, where
advancing issues outnumbered decliners 816 to 689.</p>
<p>Bond prices jumped sharply. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond fell to 8.61%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6736 marks and 151.20 Japanese yen,
compared with 1.6626 marks and 153.72 yen Monday.</p>
