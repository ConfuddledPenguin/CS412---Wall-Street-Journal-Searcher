	<p class="article-leader">The poor Russians. They are playing the role of a "colony"
to their Comecon partners by letting them buy raw materials
cheaply, according to a Moscow weekly. For their generous
subsidization -- estimated at an annual $140 a person in the
case of Hungary -- the Soviets get less than nothing,
surmises the current issue of Novoje Vremja. In Eastern
Europe anti-Soviet sentiment is flourishing, and Moscow's
political and military influence is plummeting. Machinery and
equipment the Russians got from Comecon trade have been
obsolescent and overpriced, the paper complains. The Soviets
ignored their national interests by not insisting on
market-oriented relations in Comecon, Novoje Vremja suggests.
Where is it written that colonialists are immune to
colonialization by their own dogma?</p>
