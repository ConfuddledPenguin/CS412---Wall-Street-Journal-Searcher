	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Getting to the altar can be tricky when your
country may be heading for divorce.
   Jeff Lumby, who is from English-speaking Saskatchewan, and
Julie Lafontaine, from French-speaking Quebec, were happily
planning a bilingual wedding here when they hit a roadblock.
Ms. Lafontaine's parish priest won't allow English to be
spoken in his church.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We couldn't believe it," she says. "The gulf is getting
wider and wider, and soon we won't be able to build a bridge
across."</p>
<p>French-English nastiness is cropping up more and more in
Canada. President Bush saw it last month at a ball game in
Toronto. Blue Jays fans booed the French verses of the
Canadian national anthem.</p>
<p>Relations between Quebec and the rest of the country
haven't been this sour in decades. For the first time, polls
show that most Quebecers want some form of independence. And
an increasing number of English-speaking Canadians don't
care.</p>
<p>Ms. Lafontaine and Mr. Lumby solved their problem. They
found a more tolerant parish, where they plan to be married
next month. They also wrote and recorded a bilingual love
song that has become a hit on Montreal's CJFM-FM, where Mr.
Lumby is host of the morning show.</p>
<p>Fixing Canada's marriage won't be so easy. Language
hostilities have crystallized around a package of proposed
constitutional amendments, called the "Meech Lake accord,"
that would meet Quebec's longstanding demand to be officially
recognized as a "distinct society." The amendments will die
unless legislatures of all Canadian provinces ratify them by
June 23. So far, three have refused. Yesterday, Canadian
Environment Minister Lucien Bouchard resigned from the
federal government over the Meech Lake impasse, pushing the
Canadian dollar and Canadian bond prices sharply lower.</p>
<p>Quebecers see rejection of the Meech Lake accord as
rejection of Quebec. Even the province's business people, who
once strongly favored Canadian union, are changing. A poll by
a Quebec business magazine recently found 57% of its readers
in favor of independence.</p>
<p>"Even if Meech Lake is adopted, the damage is done," says
Claude Beland, president of Mouvement Desjardins, a sprawling
financial institution that counts nearly two of every three
Quebecers among its depositors. "Everybody is tired" of
talking about Quebec's place in Canada. "It's time to decide
if we should sleep in the same bed or in separate rooms," Mr.
Beland says.</p>
<p>Full-blown independence, with sullen customs guards
harassing travelers at a Quebec-Canada border, seems
unlikely. Quebecers talk about a vague concept called
"sovereignty-association." Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa
speaks about a "superstructure" modeled on the European
Community if the Meech Lake accord dies. "Whatever happens in
Canada, you will have {some} common institutions in a common
territory," he says.</p>
<p>The opposition Parti Quebecois wants independence whether
the accord is approved or not. But Jacques Parizeau, its
leader, says it would still want a common currency with the
rest of Canada.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, failure to pass the Meech Lake accord could
spark a constitutional crisis and rattle markets.
Scotia-McLeod Inc., a big Toronto securities dealer, figures
the Canadian dollar would quickly fall to 81 U.S. cents (from
84.15 cents now) and the interest rate on Canadian
three-month treasury bills would rise to 14.25% from 13.76%.
Longer-term effects could be worse, as investors fret about
Canada's $180 billion foreign debt, which nearly equals
Brazil's and Mexico's combined.</p>
<p>The uncertainty is already affecting business. Bonds of
Quebec's big power utility, Hydro-Quebec, trade at a discount
from comparable bonds of Ontario Hydro. The yield spread
between the two concerns' 10-year bonds has widened to almost
a quarter of a percentage point from a tenth of a point a few
months ago. Paul Desmarais, the chief executive of Power
Corp. of Canada, says two big deals involving "hundreds of
millions of dollars" are on hold because would-be foreign
partners of the big Quebec holding company are worried about
the Meech Lake accord.</p>
<p>Meech Lake itself is a placid body of water near Ottawa,
once better known for a nude beach than constitutional
crisis. Meeting there in 1987, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
and the premiers of the 10 provinces hammered out the
constitutional package. They thought they had finally solved
200 years of discord between French-speaking and
English-speaking Canada.</p>
<p>The French-English marriage had always been uncomfortable.
It was a shotgun wedding, imposed by British redcoats when
they scaled the cliff below Quebec City and defeated France's
garrison there in 1759. French-Canadians rose in armed
rebellion in 1837. During World War I, many refused to fight
for an English king. A Quebec cabinet minister was murdered
by independence-minded terrorists in 1970, and 40% of the
province voted for "sovereignty-association" in a 1980
referendum.</p>
<p>Quebecers often had good reason for resentment. Twenty
years ago, the French majority still had to speak English to
be served in some Montreal stores. Business was run by an
English-speaking elite.</p>
<p>The rest of Canada finally responded in 1969, when French
was given equal standing with English in the federal
government. Labels on cereal boxes and other consumer goods
had to be written in both languages. Bilingual bureaucrats
were favored for promotion. The theory was the French would
be happy if both languages were used all across the country.</p>
<p>But bilingualism didn't answer Quebecers' deep-seated fear
that their small French-speaking society would gradually be
absorbed by English-speaking North America. In 1977, a Parti
Quebecois government made French the province's only official
language. Quebec took down all the English road signs,
compelled new immigrants to send their children to French
schools and required big companies to handle internal
correspondence in French.</p>
<p>This discrimination irked many English-Canadians. They
felt they already had done enough by paying for federal
bureaucrats to learn French and struggling with bilingual
government forms. French words on cereal boxes still raise
hackles in English Canada. "I doubt if too many people have
learned another language by reading the back of a box or the
bottom of a bottle," says British Columbia Premier Bill
Vander Zalm. English Canadians felt Quebec kept asking for
more.</p>
<p>"For 30 years, you had the question, `What does Quebec
want?' When I took power in 1985, I said I want to solve that
question," Quebec Premier Bourassa says. His government
devised "the most moderate proposals" Quebec had ever
offered.</p>
<p>Meech Lake satisfied his minimum demands. All provinces
got greater powers in relation to the federal government. The
other nine premiers were pleased.</p>
<p>But Meech Lake catalyzed latent anti-French hostility and
triggered opposition by lobbying interests pushing their own
constitutional amendments. Indians and Inuit (Eskimos)
complained that the accord didn't promise them
self-government. Women's groups feared that the "distinct
society" clause might undermine the cause of women's rights
in Quebec.</p>
<p>Politicians in English Canada started getting complaints.
Then three provinces turned against Meech Lake when the
provincial governments that had signed it lost elections.</p>
<p>During the debate, Quebec shocked English Canada by
thumbing its nose at Canada's bill of rights and passing a
law forbidding stores to post signs in any language but
French. About 50 municipalities outside Quebec responded with
resolutions declaring English as their official or only
working language. Then last month, Quebec's largest school
board gave preliminary approval to a ban on students speaking
any language but French at school.</p>
<p>One incident, shown repeatedly on television, most enraged
Quebecers: Two well-dressed, elderly men stomped on the
Quebec flag at a pro-English demonstration in Brockville,
Ontario.</p>
<p>Now, angry and frustrated, 60% of Quebecers favor
sovereignty-association. That's a big jump from 48% in
January and the most, one polling concern says, since it
first asked the question in 1978.</p>
<p>Previously, Quebec has always drawn back from the brink of
separation because of economic worries. But a robust economy
and the growth of a French-speaking business class have
changed that.</p>
<p>Quebec "executives have more self-assurance now," says
Pierre Peladeau, the chief executive of Quebecor Inc., North
America's second-largest commercial printer. "We weren't
really scared before, but we lacked self-confidence." The way
East Germans and Czechoslovaks seized control from the
Soviets also bolstered support for independence, says Mr.
Parizeau of the Parti Quebecois.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch & Co., in a report that made headlines
across Canada earlier this year, said an independent Quebec
would hang onto its credit rating. Quebec's gross domestic
product, about $130 billion last year, would put it ahead of
Denmark and Austria, the report said. Quebec's population, at
6.5 million, is 26% of Canada's total of 25.3 million.</p>
<p>This newfound confidence has sharply changed Quebecers'
attitudes. In 1980, Madeleine Saint-Laurent, a housewife,
worked hard to defeat the sovereignty-association referendum.
Quebec was so divided that she still can't talk about
politics with her sister, who lives nearby in the coastal
village of Cap Chat. "We weren't ready in 1980. We've covered
a lot of ground since then. If we have to {separate}, why
not? I'm ready," Mrs. Saint-Laurent now says. Even
English-speaking Quebecers, though less than 20% of the
province's population and its only group overwhelmingly
opposed to independence, aren't kicking up much of a fuss.</p>
<p>The irony of the current crisis is that Quebec really is a
distinct society, even though the Canadian constitution
doesn't say so. French-speaking Quebecers are a close-knit
clan, most of whose members can trace their roots back to a
few thousand French settlers here in the 1600s. They have
their own customs, tastes and national holidays.</p>
<p>So, Quebec already has most of the institutions and
gadgets of a nation: A stock exchange, universities, fashion
magazines and a 24-hour music-video channel. French theater,
film, music and television are in much better shape in Quebec
than their English counterparts are in the rest of Canada.
Aside from news and sports, the top-rated shows in English
Canada are all American imports, but in Quebec, every top-10
show is a local product. "We want to see our own lives {and}
our own values reflected on television," says Michel
Chamberland, vice president for programming at Montreal's
leading TV station.</p>
<p>Quebec's music industry also is blooming, producing
everything from teen-age pop to heavy metal to rap.
"Quebecers have a need to assert themselves. Often we do it
through culture. It's a way of saying we're here to stay,"
says Richard Pelletier, a record-company executive.</p>
<p>Even in the grocery store, Quebecers stand out. The
province accounts for 26% of national grocery sales, but 54%
of the tomato juice sold in Canada, according to A.C. Nielsen
Co. Quebecers buy lots of yogurt but hardly any sour cream;
the reverse is true in English Canada. Quebecers love poutine
-- French fries smothered in hot gravy and soft cheese -- a
delicacy unknown in the rest of Canada.</p>
<p>Despite a vibrant culture and economic success, the notion
that Quebec is on the brink of melting into the North
American pot is an article of faith here. "French will always
be under threat," says Laurence Jalbert, a pop singer. "We
succeed because we have the energy of despair. You can hear
it in our songs," she says.</p>
<p>Commenting that "Quebec has the only French-speaking
government in North America," Premier Bourassa adds:
"Quebecers want it to be recognized as such in the Canadian
constitution."</p>
<p>Most Canadian politicians agree, but the three holdout
provinces are determined to block the Meech Lake accord
unless it's changed. Various compromises are being discussed,
but they all tinker with the "distinct society" clause.
"Unacceptable," Mr. Bourassa says. "Until Quebec is better
understood, I think it will be very difficult to reach any
agreement" with Canada.</p>
<p>If Meech Lake dies June 23, Quebecers will be braced for
trouble the following day. June 24 is St. Jean Baptiste Day,
Quebec's "national" holiday. In the 1960s, St. Jean Baptiste
Day celebrations were marred by separatist riots.</p>
<p>Julie Lafontaine and Jeff Lumby will be safely out of town
that weekend, on their honeymoon, celebrating their union
while Canada struggles with its own.</p>
