	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The average managed commodity fund gained 5.1%
in April, according to Norwood Securities, Chicago, which
tracks the performance of 132 publicly offered commodity
funds.
   Wide fluctuations in the prices of Treasury bond and
foreign currency futures, as well as grain futures during the
month enabled fund managers to profit on short-term price
swings in those markets, said Jay Klopfenstein, Norwood
president.</p>

average gain of 10.6%.</p>
