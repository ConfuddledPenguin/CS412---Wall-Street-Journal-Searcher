	<p class="article-leader">THE HOUSE APPROVED sweeping rights legislation for the
disabled.
   Voting 403-20, the chamber passed the Americans With
Disabilities Act, which gives equal access to employment,
transportation and buildings to about 43 million people in
the U.S. with physical or mental disabilities. The act is
viewed as the most sweeping civil-rights measure in over 25
years. The Senate has cleared similar legislation. After a
House-Senate conference to resolve differences, Bush is
expected to sign the bill into law.</p>

state or local laws and a 1973 law covering federal

<p>GORBACHEV WON approval for a transition to a regulated
market economy.</p>
<p>Soviet citizens faced the prospect of the doubling of some
food prices as early as July 1 as the president's advisory
council adopted a plan for a restructuring of the economy.
The program, which favors a massive overhaul of prices, is
expected to be presented to the legislature tomorrow. A
deputy minister, meanwhile, said Moscow is drawing on hard
currency reserves to help cover the Soviet Union's overdue
bills for Western goods.</p>
<p>Gorbachev met with the presidents of Estonia and Latvia,
but stuck to his demand that the republics either suspend or
revoke their independence bids.</p>

<p>NATO defense ministers met in Brussels and supported the
use of multinational military units in alliance nations, a
plan that could result in an overhaul of NATO's military
structure. The two-day session is aimed at reviewing the
alliance's defense strategy amid political changes in Eastern
Europe.</p>

<p>House-Senate conferees cleared a $4 billion fiscal 1990
spending bill that includes $720 million in assistance to
Panama and Nicaragua. The action came as the House signaled
its support for withholding half of U.S. military aid to El
Salvador, but Republicans succeeded in scuttling the
underlying legislation.</p>

<p>Congressional lawmakers expressed objections to Bush's
expected call for a renewal of China's most-favored-nation
trade status, citing Beijing's human-rights record. The
president reportedly will propose a one-year extension of the
benefits this week.</p>

<p>A U.S. appeals court ruled that any employer with more
than 15 workers must provide a man with unpaid child-rearing
leave if the benefit is offered to female colleagues. The
Pittsburgh court's decision is binding in Pennsylvania,
Delaware, New Jersey and the Virgin Islands, and could be
influential nationwide.</p>

<p>Thousands of Palestinians demonstrated in the
Israel-occupied territories and in Jordanian cities and
refugee camps in escalating protests against Sunday's
slayings of seven Arab laborer's near Tel Aviv. Four people
were reported killed in the latest unrest, which included a
rally at the U.S. consulate in mostly Arab eastern Jerusalem.</p>

<p>About 300,000 mourners buried Kashmir's senior Islamic
cleric, whose assassination Monday prompted secessionist
violence that left 58 people dead in the disputed territory.
India's security forces reportedly kept their distance during
the funeral in Srinagar, where Moslem militants exploded
bombs and fired rifles to honor the clergyman.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Romania's Iliescu offered to form a coalition with parties
defeated in Sunday's national elections. But as hundreds of
anti-government protesters rallied in Bucharest, one
opposition leader ruled out the proposal by the victorious
presidential candidate, and another vowed to challenge the
results.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>North and South Yemen merged to form a single nation, the
Republic of Yemen. The new Arabian Peninsula country,
unifying the pro-Western north with the socialist south,
recently has located oil reserves and occupies a strategic
entrance to the Red Sea.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A Philippine military court charged two generals and 19
other officers with murder and rebellion related to their
alleged roles in December's coup attempt against President
Aquino's government. They are the first defendants to stand
trial in the uprising.</p>

<p>Dissidents in South Korea fought with riot police and
burned a U.S. flag in the southern city of Kwangju. Students
in Seoul declared a week of protests against the U.S.
presence in South Korea, as police tightened security at
American installations.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Senate Agriculture panel voted for a
seafood-inspection program that would put the nation's $30
billion seafood industry under a triad of regulatory
agencies. Currently, only a fraction of the seafood consumed
each year undergoes product-grading or inspection.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>South Africa threatened to use the full force of law
against armed white extremists who have vowed a race war in
Orange Free State. Mandela, meanwhile, called Sunday's police
killing of seven blacks in the region a "massacre," and
warned that efforts to end apartheid would fail unless the
Pretoria government ends violence by security forces.</p>
