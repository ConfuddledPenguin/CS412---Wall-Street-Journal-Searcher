	<p class="article-leader">David Lynch has so finely tuned his hip subversiveness
he's verging on self-parody. In the publicity materials
promoting his latest movie, "Wild at Heart," for example, the
successful film maker ("Blue Velvet") and TV producer ("Twin
Peaks") cutely lists only one credit for himself: "Eagle
Scout, Missoula, Montana."
   The joke, of course, is that this Eagle Scout's work in
general, and "Wild at Heart" especially, takes considerable
glee in undermining everything represented by "Eagle Scout"
and possibly "Missoula, Montana." Mr. Lynch has become the
establishment's favorite naughty boy, whose familiarity and
even affection for American kitsch has allowed him to subvert
it on a mass-market scale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Still, Mr. Lynch specializes in shock, and after the
relative tameness imposed by network television on "Twin
Peaks," he now seems intent on pushing his specialty to the
limit, often with the shock being the only apparent purpose.
What else explains his decision to include in "Wild at Heart"
a closeup of flies slogging through a puddle of vomit? Or the
graphic shot of a man's head being blown off and the brains
spilling onto pavement?</p>
<p>With this movie, Mr. Lynch again demonstrates his uncanny
ability to be trite and dazzling all at the same time. "Wild
at Heart" comes at you like a thundering piece of rock 'n'
roll that gets your blood rushing so long as you don't
analyze the lyrics too closely. Sometimes it's difficult to
tell whether Mr. Lynch is mocking banality or if he's just
being banal -- but with such visual sophistication he cons
you into thinking maybe there is something profound going on
even when there isn't.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, "Wild at Heart" -- perhaps Mr. Lynch's most
sexually explicit and violent work -- also is his most
sentimental. There isn't any placid surface in his adaptation
of Barry Gifford's lithe little novel about two young lovers
called Sailor and Lula who take to the road. Mr. Lynch
dispenses altogether with an overlay of niceness; he charges
right at you with an opening round of eroticism and
brutality.</p>
<p>Sailor and Lula are a trashy pair of young people who wear
snakeskin jackets (him) and wildly patterned tights and not
much else (her). They keep back their bad memories by having
a lot of sex -- vividly chronicled on screen -- and dancing
and driving around. Sailor's conversation sounds a lot like
someone who learned to talk by listening to Elvis. "I'd go to
the far end of the world for you baby," he says to Lula. "You
know I would."</p>
<p>And yet there is something sweetly sentimental about these
two lost souls trying to lose themselves in one another
because being lost is the best place they've found. They are
the products of violence and neglect, so it isn't a surprise
that they are creatures of the present, not the future. Their
talk has a peculiar formality at times, as though their minds
are filled with random facts and phrases lifted from
advertising or magazine articles.</p>
<p>"I guess I started smoking when I was about four," says
Sailor to Lula as they lie in bed after sex. "My mom was
already dead of lung cancer."</p>
<p>Lula responds: "What brand did she smoke?"</p>
<p>Sailor tells her that his mom smoked Marlboros, then adds:
"I didn't have much parental guidance."</p>
<p>The material is perfectly suited to Nicholas Cage and
Laura Dern, two oddball actors who are both spacy and
intense. Sailor's the kind of no-luck man who ends up in the
middle of violence or watching it even when he doesn't mean
to. Lula's only 20, but the only thing in her memory is death
and assault. The two of them are pursued by Lula's mother,
played with eerie bombast by Ms. Dern's real mother, Diane
Ladd.</p>
<p>Mr. Lynch hurls Lula and Sailor's odyssey among the
weirdos and maniacs up onto the screen with the mix of
sophistication and primal force that is uniquely his. Angelo
Badalamenti, the perpetrator of the insidiously compelling
"Twin Peaks" score, gooses the charge with the music. Blood
flows, body parts get blown off and then the Wizard of Oz
kicks in. I'm not kidding, though David Lynch might be.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"Flatliners," a film about a group of medical students who
decide to experience near-death, takes the psycho-babble
approach to the dangers of mucking around with God's
business.</p>
<p>Kiefer Sutherland plays the group leader, a disturbed
young man who has a dark secret in his past that he wants to
expurgate by dying, briefly, then having his colleagues
revive him. Though his description of near-death is fairly
incoherent, his fellow students are so captivated they all
decide to risk real death so they, too, can get a glimpse at
the great beyond.</p>
<p>Director Joel Schumacher ("St. Elmo's Fire," "The Lost
Boys") has come to specialize in this kind of youth fantasy
picture, and he does have a certain style. He has shot this
film like one of those English horror movies in which doctors
rob morgues for clandestine experiments, all smoky and dark
with flames added for effect.</p>
<p>His young actors, who include Julia Roberts and Kevin
Bacon, are quite good, however, and the movie manages to be
effectively creepy.</p>

<p>VIDEO TIP: In "Wild at Heart" David Lynch put Isabella
Rossellini in a small part looking pretty, as though he's
trying to make up for the ugly way he photographed her thighs
in "Blue Velvet." Ms. Rossellini was at her best in "Zelly
and Me," a psychological drama about a rich orphan terrorized
by her unkind grandmother. The movie is of particular
interest to David Lynch fans; he appears in a small role.</p>
