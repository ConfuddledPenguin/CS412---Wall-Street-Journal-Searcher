	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Image Bank Inc., which licenses reproduction
rights to photos and film, expects to report a loss of about
$584,000, or 16 cents a share, for the third quarter ended
June 30.
   The loss stems from a $700,000 write-off of foreign tax
credits the company hasn't used. The write-off is required
for accounting reasons, but Image Bank still can use the tax
credits over five years, the company said. For the
year-earlier period, Image Bank, which went public in August
1989, reported pro-forma net income of $151,000, or seven
cents a share.</p>
