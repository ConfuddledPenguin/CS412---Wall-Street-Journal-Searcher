	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Penguin USA, a unit of London-based Pearson
PLC, announced the resignation of Morton Mint, chief
executive officer. Mr. Mint has only been in the post since
late October, after years of running Penguin's operations in
Canada.
   The resignation was abrupt and shocked the publishing
community. Mr. Morton couldn't be reached for comment, nor
was Peter Mayer, executive chairman of Penguin USA,
available. The company released a statement that said the two
executives had "policy differences with respect to management
of the company in the future."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Penguin named Marvin Brown, chief administrative officer,
to the chief executive post "for the time being." The company
said Penguin USA will move toward more decentralization
within the company, with each of the adult divisions having
its own president as well as publisher.</p>
<p>Penguin has been one of a number of publishing houses
experiencing turmoil in the past year after a time of rapid
growth by acquisition. Last fall, Penguin closed the adult
publishing division of E.P. Dutton, firing a number of
editors in what many in publishing felt was an insensitive
and abrupt manner.</p>
