	<p class="article-leader">George Bush has a bigger problem than Saddam Hussein: The
economy, slowing down even before the Iraqi oil shock, now is
slouching toward recession on his watch.
   Ronald Reagan inherited stagflation, turned it around and
kept the recovery going. President Bush inherited a healthy
economy, but now it's grinding down. Granted that recoveries
weaken with age and that rising oil prices hurt, but the
looming pain also says something about the Bush team's
economic policies. After all, the Bush administration has
supplanted the Reagan economic policies with its own.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The differences are of nuance, of course, but that's what
makes markets. The centerpiece of the Reagan economic
policies was tax cuts to provide incentives for growth; other
objectives were secondary. The Bush people want a
capital-gains tax cut too, but this is secondary to a
different holy grail: reducing the deficit.</p>
<p>This was evident even in President Bush's press conference
Tuesday. He was courageous in promising spending vetoes, and
made the right revenue-enhancing arguments for a lower tax
rate on capital gains. But even with the economy flirting
with recession, these measures were tethered to a
deficit-reduction agreement with the nabobs of Congress.
Treasury Secretary Brady, no doubt reflecting the private
sentiment of the administration as a whole, couples this with
a tie for easier money. We should have learned from the '70s
that monetary policy should not validate oil-price increases.</p>
<p>Now, preoccupation with deficits and interest rates might
be fine in an ideal world of brisk growth in the economy and
good will in Congress. Sooner or later the federal government
needs to get a handle on its liabilities, as the Brady-Darman
policy axis keeps insisting. A smaller deficit also would
increase the world's savings pool, a good thing.</p>
<p>But Brady-Darman has bought into a debt paranoia that
defies economic logic. The nearby chart compares the public
debt burdens of the major industrial nations. The U.S. debt
is hardly beyond the pale. And while the U.S. burden has
grown in the 1980s, it actually was much higher in the
post-World War II decades of rapid economic growth. Besides,
if Japan's debt experience is any guide, neither interest
rates nor growth depend on government debt.</p>
<p>Other things count for more, such as tax policies that
reward investment. Rather than force-feed savings to induce
investment, the better policy is to increase the
opportunities for return on investment, and savings will
follow. If some of those savings come from overseas, so what?
In today's global economy, savings will go where the best
opportunities are.</p>
<p>Jawboning the Fed for easy money, meanwhile is downright
harmful, curbing the Fed's flexibility to ease if it wanted
to. Secretary Brady's public call last week to "avoid an over
single-minded emphasis on inflation" sounded to us a lot like
Secretary Blumenthal of the Carter administration. To the
markets too, apparently, since gold shot over $400, while the
dollar sank to trade at a record-breaking low against the
German mark. As for interest rates, after the Fed nudged
short-term rates down a fraction of a point last month, the
bond market slumped. If nothing else, this is no way to fight
a war.</p>
<p>If the current White House debt preoccupation is
economically marginal, it may prove politically suicidal.
While the President tried to seize the offensive Tuesday, the
Democrats have played the budget summit beautifully,
appearing to be responsible by talking but opening up the
spending spigots on Capitol Hill. Despite veto threats,
appropriations bills have been coming in with double-digit
increases. Meanwhile, Republicans debate a tax-a-week among
themselves. The President's press conference offers some
reason to hope he will spotlight spending, but the
administration has often sounded as if it's talking itself
into a tax increase veiled with smoke-and-mirror spending
cuts. We would be a lot more confident that it won't revert
to this mode if it talked less about trimming the deficit to
lower interest rates and more about spending itself, to lower
the government's claims on the private economy.</p>
<p>The Iraqi invasion changes everything, providing the
occasion to get general economic policy back on track. The
oil shock pushes at once toward inflation and recession, and
the White House needs a strategy to push back against both.
Our answer is the same one we and others promoted to cure the
stagflation of the '70s. On the monetary side, that means
resisting the siren song of easy money. On fiscal policy it
means putting tax cuts back to the center of the policy
debate. While 28% is low enough as a top rate, the
capital-gains cut would do a lot to curb recession. If the
Democrats' price for a capital-gains cut is the Moynihan
proposal to cut the payroll tax, that would help low-wage
workers.</p>
<p>The Reagan policy mix helped elect George Bush on a
national ticket three times. By abandoning that mix, he risks
the fate of the candidates who offered high taxes and easy
money under the rubric of "responsibility."</p>
