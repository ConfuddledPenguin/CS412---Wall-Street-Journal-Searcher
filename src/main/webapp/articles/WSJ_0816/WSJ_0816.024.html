	<p class="article-leader">Robert L. Bartley's July 10 editorial-page article, "The
Great International Growth Slowdown," is brilliant. As one
option to establishing international monetary order, a return
to the gold standard seems sensible. In a follow-up article,
could you please expand upon the pros and cons of gold's
ability to bring back an era of international economic growth
-- which as a byproduct should contribute greatly to world
peace, a higher standard of living and a higher quality of
life for five billion people.
