	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Production by U.S. industry leveled off in
July after rising for two months, the Federal Reserve
reported, an indication that the economy continues to
stumble.
   Manufacturing production slipped 0.1% and utility output
dropped 0.4%, but mining posted a 1% increase.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>American industry has been encumbered by high interest
rates, and the new numbers show that it continues to be
frail, despite production increases of 0.4% in June and 0.6%
in May. Nevertheless, some economists took last month's flat
production as a sign that the industrial economy was still
strong enough to dodge a downturn.</p>
<p>The Fed also said that variations in motor vehicle
production have been influencing overall output numbers.
"Excluding motor vehicles, industrial output rose 0.2% last
month, about the same rate of growth that has been evident so
far this year," it said.</p>
<p>"When you put motor vehicles to one side, the industrial
economy keeps crawling upward," said Robert Dederick, chief
economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.</p>
<p>But S. Jay Levy, a partner at Levy Economic Forecasts in
Chappaqua, N.Y., said, "I think this little spurt in
production a few months ago was interpreted as stronger
demand for manufactured goods than was the reality."</p>
<p>The Fed also reported that industry used less of its
capacity in July production than it had in June, another
indication of slack. July's industrial operating rate was
83.4% of capacity, down from 83.6% in June. Manufacturing
operating rates dropped to 82.6% from 82.9%.</p>
<p>The lower operating rates could temper some of the
inflation pressure being created by oil price increases. When
factories are running flat-out they often encounter
production snags and shortages that can lead to price
increases.</p>
<p>Any sign of relief from price pressures will be welcome
news for the economy, which now faces an acceleration of
inflation provoked by rocketing oil prices in the wake of
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>A report from the Commerce Department also contained some
encouraging news for the prospect of continued economic
growth. Business inventories fell 0.4% in June, nearly
erasing a 0.5% rise in May, the department said.</p>
<p>With the economy growing very slowly these days, it is
particularly important for businesses to hold down
inventories. If unsold stocks pile up too high companies are
likely to cut back orders or production and even lay off
workers. The chain reaction can tip the economy into a
recession.</p>
<p>The drop in inventories left stocks of retailers,
manufacturers and merchant wholesalers at $797.30 billion in
June. At the same time sales of all businesses rose 1% during
the month, to $544.43 billion.</p>
<p>At that sales pace, it would have taken 1.46 months to
sell off June inventories, down from 1.49 months in May.</p>
