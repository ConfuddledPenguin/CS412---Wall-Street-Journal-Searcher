	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it downgraded its
ratings on Continental Bank Corp.s senior debt to Triple-B
from Triple-B-plus and on its preferred stock to
Double-B-plus from Triple-B-minus.
   Also, S&P said it affirmed the rating on the corporation's
commercial paper at Single A-2.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, S&P said it downgraded the ratings on
Continental Illinois Overseas Finance Corp. N.V.'s
subordinated debt to Triple-B-minus from Triple-B.</p>
<p>Also, Continental Bank N.A.'s senior notes, long-term
certificates of deposit, and letter of credit backed issues
were lowered to Triple-B-plus from Single-A-minus, and its
short-term certificates of deposit and letter of credit
backed issues are affirmed at Single A-2, the rating agency
said.</p>
<p>S&P said about $1 billion in term debt outstanding is
affected.</p>
<p>S&P said: "Continental is almost entirely focused on
wholesale banking lines of business, whose core profitability
has eroded as a result of a lower volume of transactions,
particularly for leveraged buyout financings. The company has
initiated a restructuring program to help rein in overhead
expenses that had gotten out of line in a slower business
environment.</p>
<p>"Even assuming full implementation of the restructuring
program," S&P said it "expects core profitability will remain
under pressure given the intense competition and industry
overcapacity in wholesale banking."</p>
<p>S&P also said it is "concerned about Continental's large
exposure to highly leveraged transactions and the recent
deterioration in that portfolio's asset quality."</p>
<p>"Partly offsetting these concerns are an adequate level of
capital and full reserves for the remaining exposure to
lesser developed countries," S&P said.</p>
