	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southland Corp.'s debt exchange offer and the
buy-out offer from its Japanese suitor both expired at
midnight last night without completion, but most observers
expect both offers to be extended at least a week.
   Investment bankers involved in the deals wouldn't indicate
how many of the bondholders have agreed to accept the
exchange offer. John Gordon, the chairman of the bondholder
committee, said he expects the offers to be extended.
Furthermore, he said, holdouts who oppose the latest debt
swap, while troublesome, won't kill the deal. "One way or
another, this deal will be done," said Mr. Gordon of Deltec
Securities Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, the parties negotiating the deals have
contemplated the possibility of a "pre-packaged" Chapter 11
bankruptcy proceeding as a way to eliminate the problem of
holdouts without substantially changing the terms of the
agreement. The offer, the fourth put forth by Southland and
the first approved by the bondholder committee, would give
bondholders about 25% of the common stock of the company. The
founding Thompson family of Dallas would get about 5% of the
stock and Ito-Yokado, operator of 7-Eleven stores in Japan,
would get about 70% for $430 million.</p>
<p>Southland, the troubled parent of the 7-Eleven convenience
store chain, went into default on its $1.8 billion publicly
traded debt in mid-July, but avoided being forced into
bankruptcy at that time by getting a tentative approval from
the bondholder committee for the most recent exchange offer.
Banks and other creditors would receive full payment under
the plan.</p>
<p>The Thompson family, which now owns slightly more than
two-thirds of the company, would see its stake shrink under
the offer to 5%, or about a $25 million investment from about
$163 million. The family members took about $200 million out
of Southland in the $4.9 billion leveraged buyout that took
the company private in late 1987 to avoid a possible hostile
bid by the Belzberg family of Canada.</p>
<p>According to the offering documents filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, John P. Thompson, Jere W.
Thompson and Joe C. Thompson Jr. will receive five-year
employment contracts from the new owners providing annual
base salaries of $600,000 each, plus an annual bonus equal to
about $360,000 each. In addition, Jere and John will receive
the benefits given other executives. Also, five-year recourse
loans of about $32 million will be provided to the Thompsons
at no interest.</p>
<p>Southland owns about 6,700 7-Eleven and other convenience
stores in the U.S. and Canada. Increased competition eroded
sales and profit margins and made it difficult for the
company to service the huge debt from the buy-out.</p>
