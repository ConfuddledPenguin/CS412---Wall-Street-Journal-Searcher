	<p class="article-leader">Telesphere Communications Inc. expects to report tommorrow
that net income for the second quarter soared to about
$700,000, or about three cents a primary share, on a 40%
revenue increase to about $62 million, Eugene Ruiz,
Telesphere executive vice president, said in a interview.
   In the year-earlier second quarter, the long-distance
telephone concern earned $90,000 on revenue of $44.2 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Ruiz said the company expects earnings for the full
year to exceed the 1989 profit of $789,000, or five cents a
share, which included a $624,000 gain from a tax-loss
carry-forward.</p>
<p>Last year was the first profitable year for Telesphere
since 1982.</p>
<p>Telesphere, Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., is the largest
supplier of interactive 900 services, which for the most part
have been used for so-called gab lines or to provide jokes
and updates on soap operas. About half of the company's
revenue is generated by 900 service, the rest comes from
supplying operator assisted long distance service to hotels
and small business.</p>
<p>Harry Thompson, Telesphere chairman, said the company is
trying to interest consumer products companies and retailers
to experiment with using 900 lines as marketing tool.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck & Co. and Montgomery Ward & Co. are among
the companies studying whether to use the service, a
spokesman said.</p>
