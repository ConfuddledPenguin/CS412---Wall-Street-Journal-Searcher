	<p class="article-leader">MIDDLETOWN, Pa. -- CCNB Corp. and Homestead Holding Corp.
said they terminated a previously announced proposal for CCNB
to acquire Homestead Holding in an exchange of stock valued
at $17.9 million.
   The proposed acquisition was terminated after CCNB
requested on July 17 to renegotiate the $15.48 a share price
it offered last June in a letter of intent to acquire
Homestead Holding. Under terms of the proposal, each share of
Homestead Holding would have been exchanged for 0.86 share of
CCNB. Homestead Holding is the parent company of
Middletown-based Homestead Savings Association. CCNB, New
Cumberland, Pa., is the holding company for CCNB Bank,
Gettysburg National Bank and Parent Federal Savings Bank.</p>
