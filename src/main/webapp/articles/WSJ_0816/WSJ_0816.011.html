	<p class="article-leader">WHEELING, W.Va. -- Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. said
certain creditors will receive less than expected under the
company's reorganization plan as a result of a tentative
labor settlement with the United Steelworkers of America.
   The steelmaker said the specific effect on distributions
will be included in an amended plan to be filed soon. The
amended plan will also include provisions to issue an
additional 1.5 million common shares to participants in the
company's existing employee investment plan.</p>
