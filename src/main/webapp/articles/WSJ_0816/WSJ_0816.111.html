	<p class="article-leader">LAWRENCE, Kan. -- For five days after the body of a
19-year-old Indian named Christopher Bread was found in a
ditch on the outskirts of town, it rained. Mr. Bread's
parents and other native Americans saw the downpour as a
sign, a washing away of evil.
   On the morning of the memorial service last March, as the
sun rolled across the prairie once more, mourners embraced
the sunshine as a harbinger of hope. Soon, they said among
themselves, the mysteries surrounding this death and the
deaths of several other native Americans here would surely be
solved.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But that hasn't happened. In the past year and a half,
four unexplained deaths of Indian men have occurred in this
eastern Kansas town. No witnesses have come forth to explain
them. There appear to be no suspects. And while police and
the local sheriff say they are doing everything they can to
crack the cases, fears that a serial killer is responsible
haunt the Indians.</p>
<p>Moreover, local Indian leaders worry that the deaths and
the way they've been investigated are manifestations of
racism. "We feel like an isolated community. We have felt
that the view outside our community is that these are just
some drunken Indians, that it's all an Indian problem," says
Donald Bread, the father of the late Christopher and a law
instructor at Haskell Indian Junior College here.</p>
<p>The first death came to light 16 months ago when canoeists
in the Kansas River, which flows through Lawrence, found the
body of 19-year-old John Sandoval. The young Navaho had
vanished months earlier.</p>
<p>Then last October, in a park along the banks of the same
river, hikers spotted a body floating among branches and
twigs. The dead man, 21-year-old Cecil Dawes Jr., had been a
West Point cadet. He was of mixed tribal background:
Cheyenne, Arapaho, Creek and Seminole. He had been missing
for 10 days.</p>
<p>In December, the body of an elderly Indian was found early
one morning on the city's main drag.</p>
<p>Finally came the death in March of young Mr. Bread, who
had last been seen at a local hangout where a band sponsored
by so-called skinheads was playing. Until repainted recently,
the front door of the place, known as the Outhouse, was
decorated with a big swastika.</p>
<p>Officially, the cases are labeled "unattended deaths."
Though the police and county sheriff say the investigations
remain open, they also say they have few fresh leads. And,
they insist, there is no evidence the cases are in any way
related.</p>
<p>Police Chief W. Ronald Olin sees fears among Indians as an
overreaction. A small, compact man with a crisp manner, he
met last fall with Indian leaders who included the senior Mr.
Bread -- just months before Mr. Bread's own son died
mysteriously. At the meeting, the police chief said there
were no common threads linking the deaths, and suggested that
drinking might have had as much to do with the deaths as
anything else.</p>
<p>Charlene Kelley-Johnson, who is director of the Lawrence
Indian Center here and was at the meeting, says, "They talk
about the drinking and they say there is no evidence to
connect the cases, but what is crucial is that there is no
evidence so far to dispel the idea of connections. And so the
native American community is filled with confusion and fear."</p>
<p>About 2,000 native Americans representing scores of tribes
live in this fast-growing city of 56,000 on the edge of the
prairie. Some attend the University of Kansas, but most are
either students or teachers at Haskell, a 106-year-old,
federally supported college that legendary athlete Jim Thorpe
once attended.</p>
<p>The fear that a killer of Indians may be at large has
caused some Haskell students to warn relatives and friends to
stay away. Last spring, some terrified students even tried to
hock their traditional dance costumes to raise money to go
home early.</p>
<p>Fears have been fed, too, by certain other incidents in
the past 18 months or so. Three Haskell students have been
struck and injured by hit-and-run drivers late at night on
well-lighted streets. Harry Oliver, a 72-year-old from the
Kickapoo Indian Reservation near Horton, Kan., was killed
after attending a powwow at Haskell. He also appears to have
been a hit-and-run victim, but the case is still open. An
autopsy showed his blood-alcohol level to be .18, well beyond
the legal limit for drivers of. 10.</p>
<p>And last September, the body of a Lawrence woman of Puerto
Rican heritage was found stuffed in a culvert west of town.
She was an avid walker who often trod deserted country roads.
The Indians, many of whom do a lot of walking because they
don't have cars, think she may have been mistaken for one of
them. That case is also unsolved.</p>
<p>Douglas County Sheriff Loren Anderson says that 1989 was a
most unusual year. There were 18 death investigations and
seven homicides. Five of the dead were Indians. The year
before saw just six investigations of deaths and one
homicide.</p>
<p>Students expressed their fears at a march and forum a few
weeks after young Mr. Bread died. Chanting "don't hesitate,
investigate," they marched from the police station to the
Haskell campus, carrying signs saying "Are you next?" and
"Will it ever stop?" At the forum, Mr. Bread's father
confronted Police Chief Olin: "When the body of Cecil Dawes
was found, I told you that if you don't stop this, it will
happen again. But Dawes's death was called `an unattended
death.' . . . Someone is thinking that it is okay to kill in
Lawrence -- that it will be called an `unattended death.'"</p>
<p>All this apparently put enough pressure on city
commissioners that in early July they announced a citywide
task force to study racism in Lawrence. Meanwhile, rumors are
rampant, especially on the south side of town where most of
Lawrence's native Americans live. Because the fourth victim,
Christopher Bread, was last seen at a local haunt of
"skinheads," most of the stories feature this group.</p>
<p>The term skinhead usually refers to young neo-Nazis with
shaved heads or close-cropped hair who wear jeans, suspenders
and heavy black work boots, and advocate violence in the name
of white supremacy. The sheriff confirms there are such
people hereabouts. But he says there also are "copycats" who
dress like skinheads but don't exhibit overt racism.</p>
<p>Some people here argue that the FBI should get involved
because of possible violations of federal civil rights law.
On behalf of Mr. Dawes, the Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes of
Oklahoma have asked the FBI to intervene. Sheriff Anderson
says he wouldn't mind the help.</p>
<p>In the Dawes and Sandoval cases, details are sketchy. The
coroner's report says Mr. Sandoval was last seen at a party
near the center of town. Friends say that when he left, he
was walking toward home, not in the direction of the river
where his body was found. Mr. Dawes's body, too, was found in
the Kansas River.</p>
<p>The river, known locally by its Indian name, the Kaw, can
be treacherous, says Sheriff Anderson. He doesn't have a
theory about Mr. Sandoval, whose body was decomposed when
found, but he believes Mr. Dawes got caught in an
undercurrent as he tried to swim the river.</p>
<p>The sheriff knows that Mr. Dawes, after leaving a bar late
at night, snagged a tire of his car on a railroad tie while
crossing the tracks. The rest is speculation. The sheriff's
theory goes like this: Worried that he'd get in trouble for
drinking and driving, young Mr. Dawes left the car on the
edge of the tracks and ran to the river. A superb athlete, he
may have thought he could swim to the other side and walk
home. His blood alcohol level was .186. Again, the legal
limit for driving is .10.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Dawes say their son would have thought twice
before jumping into the Kaw, whether he'd been drinking or
not. They think he was forced in.</p>
<p>Cecil Dawes Sr., a soft-spoken man who teaches graphic
arts at Haskell, is troubled that the police didn't notify
him when they found his son's car near the river the Saturday
night he disappeared. The police respond that it was the
son's car and thus there was no reason to notify his parents.
It wasn't until the following Friday that the father located
the car with the sheriff's help in one of the tow-yards the
police use.</p>
<p>Mr. Dawes found the contents of his son's wallet scattered
across the front seat and on the floor. Also clothes,
receipts, check stubs and books.</p>
<p>Why didn't the police connect the abandoned car, which
must have been listed in their computer, with the
missing-person report that Mr. and Mrs. Dawes later filed
with the police, the father asks now. Why didn't they examine
the car closely and take its contents in as evidence? The
car, he says, seems particularly important in light of the
fact that a woman who was riding with his son that night says
the young man thought he was being followed. After getting
stuck among the ties, he told her to get out and hide. She
has told investigators that from where she was hiding in the
bushes nearby, she thought she heard a car door slam and a
voice. But people close to the investigation say she has
changed her story at least once.</p>
<p>More is known about the Bread case. On a chilly evening in
March, young Mr. Bread took a taxi to the roadhouse called
the Outhouse, a one-story cinder-block building that looks
too urban to be nestled amid silos in the cornfields. On the
back wall of the hangout, between boarded-up windows, are
slogans and images. Surrounding a skull and bones are the
words "Hard Core Hate Trip." Near the words "Death Squad" are
big letters S that look like the lightning-bolt insignias on
the collars of Nazi uniforms.</p>
<p>Two heavy-metal bands were playing the night Mr. Bread was
there, the night he died. About 40 people attended. At one
point there is said to have been a scuffle between skinheads
and Indians, but Mr. Bread apparently wasn't involved. Two
skinheads manning the front gate have told police they saw
the young man leave, walking alone down a deserted county
road.</p>
<p>At what time he left hasn't been exactly established. Band
members told detectives they thought he left between 12:30
and 12:45 a.m. Shortly after 1 a.m., a motorist spotted his
body.</p>
<p>The victim's mother, Marilyn Bread, is a former
commissioner of the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation
and now teaches business at Haskell. She says her son "didn't
like to walk, especially on cold nights, and it was 19
degrees that night. We know that he had told the cab driver
who took him {to the dance hall} that he would want a ride
back and would call the cab company later. He never called."</p>
<p>Mr. Bread, who is Kiowa and Cherokee, died from head
injuries of unknown cause. Of the three coroners who examined
the body, two said the fractured skull and other injuries
were consistent with a hit-and-run accident. Coroners'
reports put his blood-alcohol at .127.</p>
<p>Detective Robert Van Hoesen was the first officer on the
scene that night. He says now, "It was my feeling that {the
death} had occurred somewhere else, that this was a body that
had been moved."</p>
<p>Police Chief Olin scoffs at the idea of a killer at large.
He displays his sheepskins on the walls of his office: a
doctorate in developmental psychology, a certificate from the
FBI National Academy, another from the
Polizei-Fuehrungsakademie, a leadership school for the German
police. "There is absolutely no indication of a homicide" in
the Bread case, he says. "Jeans, black jacket, long black
hair, walking in the middle of the road in the middle of the
night and on a county road and beyond the legal level of
intoxication. . . . There has never been a hit-and-run case
{before} where we've had 20 investigators working on it and
ordered three autopsies. I am at a loss to explain the
skepticism."</p>
<p>The chief also rejects the idea of calling in the FBI.
Why, he says, would the FBI be interested in two drownings
and some traffic accidents?</p>
<p>And he is quick to insist that any criticism of his
department concerning the cases of Messrs. Sandoval, Dawes
and Bread is misdirected. Because the bodies were found
either in the river or on a county road, the matters are the
responsibility of the sheriff, not the police.</p>
<p>In an office down the hall from the chief's, Sheriff
Anderson furrows his brow. "The 20 or so investigators in the
Bread case were dispatched for a homicide, not a hit and run.
We still don't know what we've got here," he says, tapping
his corncob pipe on the heel of his left cowboy boot. "There
are still some questions yet."</p>
<p>Both the sheriff and Detective Van Hoesen are puzzled as
to why there were no auto parts on the road, no skid marks
and no shards of glass. Among other things, they wonder why
two T-shirts Mr. Bread was wearing were rolled up from the
waist to his armpits. His back was scraped, as if he had been
dragged. There is nothing in any of the reports to suggest
that he was walking down the middle of the road, says the
sheriff.</p>
<p>Why also, if it was a hit and run, were there no flecks of
paint in his hair or on his leather jacket? Forensic experts
have told the sheriff the pressure of body against vehicle is
usually so great in a hit and run that it burns paint into
clothing. "The paint would typically come off at the point of
contact," says the sheriff. "And leather is known to pick up
paint very easily."</p>
<p>With his rancher's gait, easy style and talent for
listening, the tall, 47-year-old sheriff, who took his post
in January 1989, has earned a bit of trust among the Indians.
His demeanor has even inspired a certain calm in the Indian
community. But he is not calm.</p>
<p>"There are typically a few unanswered questions in cases
like these without witnesses, says the sheriff. "But what
bothers me is that here, mainly in the Bread case, there are
more than a few."</p>
<p>Leaning back and puffing on his pipe, he says, "We don't
know what happened to Christopher Bread. I'm not gonna be
surprised if we find out it's not a motor vehicle that killed
him. I'm also not skeptical of connections. We may someday
find a link."</p>
