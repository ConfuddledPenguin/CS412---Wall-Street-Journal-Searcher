	<div class="article-body"><p>LOS ANGELES -- Dennis Lidtke found out how rough it can be
to run a small business.</p>
<p>Two years ago, a gunman robbed $40,000 from the safe of
the Palace Nightclub here, which Mr. Lidtke operates. Only
two months later, masked gunmen held Mr. Lidtke and his wife
hostage at their home while accomplices cleaned out the club
safe again.</p>
<p>Next, two men allegedly told Mr. Lidtke to give up partial
control of his business and fork over $50,000 -- or face a
beating.</p>
<p>Such horrifying experiences aren't unprecedented. Small
businesses have long been targets for such crimes as
extortion, fraud, loan-sharking and money laundering --
sometimes committed by individuals and sometimes by organized
crime. Entrepreneurs often wonder how -- or if -- they can
fight back.</p>
<p>Mr. Lidtke paid the money the criminals demanded. But,
unlike many entrepreneurs, he also went to the police. He
didn't get total satisfaction, but he didn't waste his time
either. Three men were eventually indicted for extortion and
other crimes against Mr. Lidtke and other businessmen.</p>
<p>In a plea bargain, one defendant, John Scotto, pleaded no
contest to a felony count, possession of a forged document
with intent to defraud. He also agreed to resign from the
state bar and sell his interest in two restaurants, says John
Monaghan, the deputy district attorney who handled the case.</p>
<p>The other two defendants, Leonard Passafaro and Natale
Cardino, pleaded no contest to attempting to extort another
businessman. Each of the three agreed to prison terms of up
to 16 months and face formal sentencing within the next
several weeks.</p>
<p>Law enforcement authorities apparently fear that the
alleged extortion of Mr. Lidtke may have been part of a wider
Mafia move into Los Angeles in recent years.</p>
<p>According to an affidavit by a Los Angeles Police
Department organized-crime investigator, filed in connection
with the Lidtke case, police here three years ago launched an
investigation into "the suspected infiltration" by the Mafia
into Los Angeles area businesses, particularly restaurants,
nightclubs and bars.</p>
<p>Early on, the police came across Mr. Scotto, one of the
defendants in the Lidtke case, says the affidavit, filed in
county municipal court here. The 29-year-old Mr. Scotto, a
local attorney, is the son of Anthony Scotto, a former New
York labor leader, a convicted criminal and a captain in the
Gambino crime family, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>In January, 1987, Los Angeles police stopped John Scotto
while he was driving with a reputed East Coast Mafia figure,
the affidavit states. The alleged crime figure told an
undercover police informant that he was interested in Los
Angeles night clubs as a way to launder cocaine profits, the
document adds.</p>
<p>An attorney for Mr. Scotto declined to comment on any
aspect of this story.</p>
<p>The 54-year-old Mr. Lidtke says thoughts of mobsters were
far from his mind when he got involved with the Palace more
than a decade ago. Mr. Lidtke owned a graphic-design business
and had long been active in efforts to restore Hollywood's
badly faded glamour.</p>
<p>The Palace was built in the 1920s as one of Hollywood's
first legitimate theaters. "Just about every legend from
Sinatra and Garland to Armstrong and Crosby performed at the
Palace," says Mr. Lidtke.</p>
<p>Mr. Lidtke says he bought it in 1979 to help save it from
the wrecking ball. He turned it into an entertainment complex
with a nightclub, restaurant and film and video production
facilities.</p>
<p>Mr. Lidtke says that besides investing most of his
personal wealth in the project, he raised $1.5 million
through a limited partnership. The partnership, whose
investors were mainly New Yorkers, took title to the
building.</p>
<p>Despite its aesthetic successes, the project has had
serious financial problems. The company owned by Mr. Lidtke
that manages the Palace recently filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code,
its second such filing in the past six years. The company is
hundreds of thousands of dollars in arrears on rents to the
limited partnership, a matter that is part of litigation
between Mr. Lidtke and the partners in a Los Angeles state
court.</p>
<p>But Mr. Lidtke contends he was making progress in getting
the Palace on firmer footing when "all hell broke loose" in
early 1988.</p>
<p>For one thing, the limited partnership hired Mr. Scotto to
represent it in the festering rent dispute. He and Mr. Lidtke
initially worked out a new rent schedule and Mr. Lidtke
agreed to resign as general partner of the building
partnership if his company fell in arrears.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the Palace suffered the two major robberies.
In the first, Mr. Lidtke says his wife, Beverly, came to the
office one Monday morning to find an armed robber waiting,
who forced her to open the Palace safe.</p>
<p>As a result, Mr. Lidtke says he couldn't keep current on
the Palace's rent, and Mr. Scotto filed an action to evict
Mr. Lidtke's company. However, according to lawyers for Mr.
Lidtke and the limited partnership, the eviction effort
failed because Mr. Scotto served the wrong type of notice on
Mr. Lidtke.</p>
<p>About two months after the first robbery, the Lidtkes came
home to find two masked robbers with semi-automatic weapons,
says Mr. Lidtke. The Lidtkes were bound and held for eight
hours while the robbers ransacked the house and phoned a
confederate at the Palace with the new combination to the
safe.</p>
<p>During the ordeal, the two robbers cracked open a few
beers and chatted with their victims. "They told us they were
hired out of New York and paid $10,000 to clean us out," says
Mr. Lidtke. He says the two were familiar enough with the
Palace situation to suggest at one point that Mr. Lidtke sell
out to his partners in New York.</p>
<p>Though no one has been charged with the robberies, Mr.
Monaghan, the deputy district attorney, says he believes the
thefts were connected to the extortion effort. However, he
adds, there isn't any evidence that the limited partners were
involved in any wrongdoing. Mr. Monaghan says he believes Mr.
Scotto eventually hoped to take over the Palace himself.</p>
<p>In September 1988, two men claiming to represent the
interests of the limited partners contacted Mr. Lidtke and
requested a meeting, says the police affidavit. In his office
conference room, Mr. Lidtke and a partner met with the men,
whom police later identified as Mr. Passafaro and Mr.
Cardino.</p>
<p>The two demanded that Mr. Lidtke resign as general partner
of the Palace limited partnership and pay $50,000, says the
police affidavit. The two men told him to go see Mr. Scotto
to settle things, according to the affidavit. One also told
Mr. Lidtke: "I know where you live, where you go, your wife,
everything," adding that Mr. Lidtke might face a "beating."
Mr. Lidtke says he was scared enough to pay the $50,000.</p>
<p>But he and his partner also had the presence of mind to
provide the police with hard evidence of extortion. The two
secretly tape-recorded the meeting with Mr. Passafaro and Mr.
Cardino. Mr. Lidtke says he also had the conference table's
glass top cleaned beforehand to better pick up fingerprints
from the men.</p>
<p>After a lengthy preliminary hearing on the charges against
Mr. Scotto and Mr. Passafaro, a state court judge found
sufficient evidence of guilt to order a full trial. Then,
however, the three reached a plea bargain with the district
attorney.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Lidtke says he is still nervous enough to
keep an armed guard at his home.</p>
