	<p class="article-leader">By now I'm pretty sick and tired of people asking, "Who
would have thought a few years ago that Eastern Europe would
overthrow communism, and the Soviet Union would be in danger
of breaking up?"
   I would have thought of it. In fact, I did, in the novel
"Voyagers II: The Aliens Within," published in 1986. It is a
science fiction novel, of course.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It has always surprised me that people who pay attention
to stock market analysts and weather forecasters refuse to
read science fiction. They are missing the best technique
available for examining the future.</p>
<p>There is virtually nothing that has been discovered or
invented in this century that was not predicted in a science
fiction story. From computers to space travel, from organ
transplants to genetic engineering, robots, nuclear power,
the population explosion, the energy crunch, urban sprawl and
greenhouse warming -- all were subjects of science fiction
stories 20, 40, 60 years ago and more.</p>
<p>I am speaking of science fiction as it is published in
books and magazines, not the "sci-fi" of Hollywood. Most
"sci-fi" movies bear the same relationship to science fiction
that Popeye does to naval history. Even films based on solid
science fiction, such as the Schwarzenegger epic "Total
Recall," bury the science fiction ideas beneath an orgy of
mindless violence. Would you give the cops machine guns if
you lived in a glass dome? Come on]</p>
<p>(Incidentally, the term "sci-fi" is loathed by most
science fiction writers. It is a term of derision, used
mainly by publicity agents and desperate headline writers.)</p>
<p>Futurists, the professional scientists who make a career
of technological and/or sociological forecasting, are like
science fiction writers who have had the imagination beaten
out of them. If you have ever read a futurist's report five
years after it was published you know that their forecasts
are usually worthless. This is because they must labor under
a tremendous handicap: They must stick to the facts that are
known at the time the report is written. This means their
forecasts tend to be straight-line extrapolations of the
present situation that become more and more inaccurate the
farther into the future we go.</p>
<p>Science fiction writers, on the other hand, are not
hampered by the limitations of the present. They can create
crazy ideas, wild cards. They are free to invent anything
they can imagine, as long as it does not violate the basic
laws of science. (And, in some cases, even if it does.) If
you wait long enough, the wild card eventually shows up. The
Arabs do put an embargo on petroleum. The Soviet system does
crack apart. Ray guns become lasers. Invisible airplanes
become Stealth bombers.</p>
<p>Does this mean that you can foretell the future by reading
science fiction? Yes. And no.</p>
<p>Science fiction writers are really not even trying to
predict the future. Most of us do not believe there is a
single, immutable THE future to predict. The future is
plastic, unformed, capable of being shaped by all the things
each of us does -- and all the things we fail to do.</p>
<p>Science fiction stories examine possible futures. The
writer takes a set of ideas and asks, "What would happen if .
. ." And the game begins. What would happen if a flying
saucer landed on the White House lawn and gave us an energy
source that ran on water and produced no harmful pollution?
In science fiction, that is the beginning of a story. How
would the world change? Who would benefit? Who would get
hurt? Where should you invest your money?</p>
<p>By reading science fiction, you get a kaleidoscopic view
of many possible futures. The one that actually happens is in
there someplace. It may become reality because enough readers
liked that future well enough to make it come true. Most of
the men who walked on the moon started by reading science
fiction. So did most of the people who got them there.</p>
<p>This is not to say that every tale is a literary gem. Far
from it. The late science fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon
years ago coined Sturgeon's Law: Ninety percent of science
fiction is crud; but then, 90% of everything is crud.</p>
<p>At its best, science fiction acts as a sort of simulations
laboratory in which we test ideas about the future. "What
if?" is the question constantly being examined.</p>
<p>What if Saddam Hussein succeeds in his quest to develop
nuclear arms for Iraq? What if AIDS or a similar
immune-system disease spreads to the general population? What
if the greenhouse effect melts the polar ice caps?</p>
<p>Can a world divided into nations and blocs create an
effective International Peacekeeping Force with the power and
authority to prevent any nation from attacking any other
nation?</p>
<p>Will electronic books replace paper?</p>
<p>Will private enterprise finally move into space
development and create the industries in orbit that
government programs cannot? Or will space be left entirely to
politically motivated government efforts?</p>
<p>Will advances in biotechnology allow us to live for
centuries? Or become virtually immortal?</p>
<p>These are the kinds of questions that good science fiction
considers. Surely, if any field of literature can be said to
have any practical value, this ongoing examination of the
future's many pathways is as important as it is entertaining.</p>
