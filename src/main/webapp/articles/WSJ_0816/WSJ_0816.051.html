	<p class="article-leader">GARDEN CITY, N.Y. -- Cable Applications Inc. said that
Richard Capaldo, chairman and president, and Vincent Cestaro,
vice president, resigned their executive posts and
directorships.
   The company also said its auditors, Margolin, Winer &
Evens, had resigned. The auditor resigned, Cable Applications
said, because the company failed to file certain tax returns
and lacked supporting data for some expense reimbursements
and other matters. The auditors thus found it difficult to
confirm certain potential liabilities, Cable Applications
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cable Applications said it has taken steps including the
appointment of a financial consultant to monitor operations
and expenditures. Cable Applications supplies temporary
technical personnel to aerospace and other firms and installs
cable used in various telecommunications applications.</p>
<p>Messrs. Capaldo and Cestaro couldn't be reached for
comment. Cable Applications said Mr. Capaldo will continue to
assist the company in its telecommunications-installation
segment.</p>
