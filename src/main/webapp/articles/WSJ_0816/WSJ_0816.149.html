	<p class="article-leader">MEXICO CITY -- For a country that stands to bank a
providential $2 billion in this year's oil price run-up,
Mexico is in a surprisingly subdued, even apprehensive, state
of mind these days.
   Mexico's Bolsa de Valores, one of the fastest growing
stock markets in the world through most of this year, has
gone into a funk ever since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The
influential chief of the Mexican Senate's energy commision
spoke dismissively about "rarely reliable" fluctuations in
the oil markets. Employees of the state oil monopoly,
Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, still talk as skeptically as
though oil prices were in full retreat. "You can't count on
what's happening in the Middle East to improve things in
Mexico," says Javier Gomez, a Pemex office worker.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After nearly a decade of economic crisis triggered by
sinking oil prices, why aren't Mexicans toasting their sudden
gusher of good luck? For one thing, many Mexicans are worried
that rising oil prices will be the last straw that leads to a
recession in the U.S., the major market for Mexico's
manufactured exports and biggest source of Mexico's foreign
investment. The Middle East crisis has also pricked a soft
spot in the Mexican psyche -- the country's complicated
attitude toward oil.</p>
<p>"This has always been an oil country that doesn't think
like an oil country," says Jorge Diaz Serrano, who went from
the Pemex chief executive's suite during the oil boom of the
1970s to a penitentiary cell during the debt bust of the
1980s. Mr. Diaz Serrano spent five years in jail after being
convicted for embezzling $34 million from the government.</p>
<p>Foreign refiners, seeing oil reserves in Mexico that some
consider the equal of those in Saudi Arabia, certainly think
of Mexico as an oil country. Scrambling for crude supplies in
the hours after the Iraqi invasion, they quickly found their
way to Pemex, the fifth-biggest oil company in the world. But
Pemex's capital budget has been so constrained since the debt
crisis that the company could manage only a temporary
increase of 100,000 barrels in its daily 1.2 million-barrel
export output.</p>
<p>Still, if the rise in world oil prices sticks -- as it
well might with U.S. and Iraqi soldiers digging in --
Mexico's balance of payments could be substantially
strengthened. If prices hold at $25 a barrel, Mexico earns an
extra $14 million a day above budget estimates, or an
additional $2 billion through year end. The extra cash could
hardly come at a better time. The government's policy of
tearing down trade borders and stabilizing the exchange rate
has caused imports to almost double since 1987. This year's
deficit in the current account, the broadest measure of
trade, may reach as much as $6 billion.</p>
<p>But higher oil prices could also have some less beneficial
effects on Mexico's economy. Since oil prices collapsed in
the early 1980s, Mexico has made a great effort to promote
manufactured exports as an alternative source of foreign
exchange. Now, 65% of Mexico's export income is derived from
sales of manufactured goods and 35% from sales of oil, almost
the reverse of the proportion in 1985.</p>
<p>"Mexicans didn't celebrate these oil price increases for
very long, because they soon began to worry about what would
happen to manufactured exports if our major market {the U.S.}
fell into an oil recession," says Jorge Vazquez Costilla, an
economist at Grupo Visa S.A., a huge conglomerate.</p>
<p>Felipe Pablo Martinez, chief of a large Mexican shoe
exporter, Emyco S.A., got a sense of an impending U.S.
economic crunch at a shoe fair in New York two weeks ago.
"All the buyers were depressed and complaining about how bad
things look," he says. Yet Mr. Martinez had no trouble
getting U.S. retailers to check out his moderately priced
product. "There are many Mexican exporters like us, that have
niches that look more attractive during a recession than
during a boom," he says.</p>
<p>Middle-market exporters like Mr. Martinez, along with the
extra oil revenue, ought to get Mexico through a U.S.
recession in fair shape, according to Mauro Leos, vice
president of operations of Wharton Econometric Forecasting
Associates in Philadelphia. Mr. Leos does think a U.S.
downturn might hit some Mexican industries pretty hard,
particularly the automobile industry, a big producer of jobs
and foreign exchange for Mexico.</p>
<p>Yet "Mexico seems to end up with more dollars with higher
oil prices in most of the scenarios we've examined," Mr. Leos
says. Mexico would be a loser, he says, only if a U.S.
recession is far deeper than most analysts consider likely.</p>
<p>That being the case, some say Mexico's subdued response to
the oil-price rebound has more to do with psychology then
economics. In Mexico, oil has always been freighted with
symbolic significance -- what Mr. Diaz Serrano calls "the
black legend." It has never been viewed as just another
commodity.</p>
<p>After buccaneering foreign petroleum companies were
nationalized in 1938, oil became a symbol of Mexican
nationalism. When prices shot up during the late 1970s, oil
was viewed as Mexico's ticket to the First World. Today,
Mexicans think of oil as the catalyst for a reckless
government's borrowing binge that brought about Mexico's
worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>That last view will be slow to change. "In the late '70s
the president told Mexicans that the country's only challenge
was `administering the abundance.' It was like Santa Claus,"
says Federico San Roman, a psychiatrist and political writer.
"Today, the government is being very austere in its response
to higher prices. It probably knows that, by now, people will
believe it only when they see it."</p>
