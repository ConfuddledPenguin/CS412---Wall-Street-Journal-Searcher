	<p class="article-leader">AMMAN, Jordan -- In this Arab capital, the call has gone
out: Uncle Saddam Wants You -- every last one of you.
   A stern portrait of the Iraqi president hangs on the wall
of a recruitment center, where Wael Khayyat adds his name to
the long list of Jordanians volunteering to fight with Iraq.
"I want to kill Americans and Jews," says the slim, handsome
youth, writing his name in hesitant script. In the space
marked "year of birth," he enters 1983. Actually, he says
proudly, "I am almost seven-and-a-half." His three sisters --
aged nine to 14 -- have already signed up.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While U.S. troops mobilize for deployment in Saudi Arabia,
a very different sort of call-up is taking place in Jordan.
Under the banner of a group called the Popular Front in
Support of Iraq, Jordanians are signing up in droves to fight
in the desert. Though most are young men with military
training, this week's intake includes a cane-carrying
Bedouin, a suit-clad storeowner and two teen-aged sisters
from a wealthy Amman district.</p>
<p>"Today we shop," says 17-year-old Rabia Saddiq, slinging a
designer handbag over her shoulder. "Tomorrow we go to war."</p>
<p>Front organizers say 80,000 have joined, which if accurate
would make it almost as large as Jordan's standing army.
While the force is at present unarmed, and no recruits have
yet gone to Iraq, the war fervor alone may eventually spell
trouble for the U.S. and Israel. In the space on the
registration form marked "other comments," Mohammed Assad
writes the Arabic word "shaheed" -- martyr. Others follow his
example, including several who say they are Palestinian
commandos trained in Lebanon.</p>
<p>"I want a suicide mission," says the fiery-eyed Mr. Assad,
a mechanic and father of two. Asked if he is afraid of U.S.
forces, he says, "God has more bombs than America." Shouts
another man: "We have all seen Vietnam movies. These
Americans can't stand the heat."</p>
<p>Many would-be warriors are camping out at recruitment
centers in the hopes that orders and uniforms will be
distributed. One impatient man drove to the Iraqi border
Tuesday night, was turned back, and returned to an Amman
center, weeping and screaming, "I want to go now] I want to
die today]"</p>
<p>Faisal Ibrahim appears for his daily vigil in green
fatigues, with a fresh tattoo on his arm bearing the words
"Allah and Palestine" and a ten-gallon hat on his head. "I
want to stand tall like your Mr. Reagan," says Mr. Ibrahim,
who is 25 and unemployed. "I want to stand tall for Saddam."</p>
<p>This volunteerism is Jordan's most extreme symptom of
virulent anti-Americanism. In a country where both the king
and his foreign minister have American wives, and where
Little League, Boy Scouts and Pizza Hut all thrive,
demonstrators are burning U.S. flags and shopkeepers are
turning away American visitors with shouted obscenities about
George Bush.</p>
<p>This bile puts King Hussein in an extremely delicate
position as he meets today with President Bush to discuss the
Gulf crisis. The King is fast losing his image as a moderate
Arab leader, and if he continues to act as an apologist for
Saddam Hussein, he risks further isolation from both the West
and Arab states such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Yet if he
tilts decisively toward the U.S. -- for instance, by agreeing
to immediately halt truck traffic to and from Iraq -- he
could light a domestic bonfire that would be hard to
extinguish.</p>
<p>"I have never seen such collective zest in Jordan," says
Sari Nasir, a sociologist at Jordan University. Mr. Nasir
believes the volunteerism stems from a "tribal feeling" of
kinship with a neighbor under siege, coupled with deep hatred
of Israel. Jordan's population is roughly 60% Palestinian. If
shooting breaks out in the Gulf, Mr. Nasir adds, passions are
so hot that "the whole region could erupt, and God knows
where that will lead."</p>
<p>Much of the Popular Front's leadership is as unaccustomed
to battle as the army's new recruits. Hastily organized 10
days ago, the Front is operating from the offices of
professional unions: lawyers, doctors, pharmacists,
engineers. Most of these white-collar radicals have little
military experience, apart from two years' mandatory army
duty, and they appear to have been a bit overwhelmed by the
response to their call for volunteers.</p>
<p>Mohammed Semeih is a criminal defense lawyer and former
judge. These days, he has exchanged his black court robe for
olive-drab fatigues with epaulets, the unofficial uniform of
the popular army. "I am a lawyer, not a soldier," says the
57-year old. "But it is important that the troops see me
dressed this way."</p>
<p>The army's founder, at least, is battletested. Mohammed
Rashdan is a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine, a radical PLO faction. He says he has taken
part in commando actions, as well as having fought with
Iraqis against Iran as part of a volunteer Jordanian brigade.
Asked his specialty, the commando-turned-lawyer smiles and
answers, "Sniper."</p>
<p>According to Mr. Rashdan, the volunteer army has gathered
pledges of money and food and is ready to move as soon as the
Jordanians give permission to cross into Iraq. "We will fight
at any border," he says, sipping Turkish coffee and grinding
coral worry beads. "The Gulf, Palestine, Lebanon -- it is all
the same struggle."</p>
<p>The Jordanian government has thus far treated the popular
army with benign neglect. Some analysts speculate that
officials welcome the army as a way for citizens to blow off
steam that might otherwise be directed at the government.
With unemployment running at over 15%, pro-Iraq feeling isn't
the only source of potential instability in Jordan.</p>
<p>The Iraqis, for their part, haven't yet called for
reinforcements, and the popular army leader, Mr. Rashdan,
doesn't expect an Iraqi request until their own troops are
fully in place, probably in another 10 days, he says. But
Baghdad isn't exactly damping war fever. On the embassy's
front gate is a poster of a Jewish Star of David superimposed
on a U.S. flag, which is dropping bombs on a dove. The
embassy's facade is being rebuilt in a gaudy replica of
Babylon's Ishtar Gate, a reminder that Saddam Hussein regards
himself as an heir to Nebuchadnezzar, who enslaved the Jews
by the rivers of Babylon.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Arabs visiting Amman have signed on with the
popular army, as well as an estimated 15,000 women and
children. Wael, the seven-year-old recruit, arrived holding
hands with his father, a schoolteacher and fellow volunteer.
The two spent the previous night on a school project: a
relief map made of cardboard and colored sponge showing
Jordan and Israel as one country, labeled Palestine. Asked
what his young child will contribute to the Arab struggle,
Mohammed Khayyat says, "Maybe he can carry water."</p>
<p>Hasiba Hamdan has no such modest ambitions for her two
sons, aged five and seven. "We will all kill Americans," she
says, as her husband signs up the whole family. The
seven-year-old, wearing a Flintstones T-shirt, has no
comment, while his younger brother nuzzles sleepily against
Mrs. Hamdan's breast. Asked if the children understand what
is happening, Mrs. Hamdan responds: "It isn't important that
they understand. I will tell them what to do."</p>
<p>Nor is she frightened by U.S. forces. "Americans eat so
much junk food that they are made out of candy," she says.
"They will melt in the desert before we get there."</p>
<p>In contrast to Iranian zealots and Islamic fundamentalists
in Lebanon and Egypt, many of whom see themselves in a holy
war against all things Western, Jordanians direct their wrath
specifically at America (because of its unstinting support of
Israel) and to a lesser degree Britain (because of its former
colonial rule). A visitor touring Amman's souk, and
announcing himself as an American, finds some doorways
blocked as shopkeepers declare, "America not a friend
anymore," or "tell George Bush to {expletive deleted}."
Announcing himself as an Australian or Canadian, the same
visitor encounters no such hostility.</p>
<p>Many Jordanians say they would welcome the arrival of
Iraqi tanks in Amman as yet another step toward unifying the
Arab nation. But such pro-Saddam sentiment hasn't yet
supplanted worship of Jordan's royal family. While
recruitment centers are plastered with pictures of the Iraqi
president, shops and streets still are filled with portraits
of the Jordanian monarch.</p>
<p>An Egyptian watch seller named Mahmoud recently added
three souvenirs from Baghdad to his display: watches with
Saddam Hussein's face emblazoned on the dial. Thus far, there
haven't been any takers. But he predicts, in whispered tones,
that the Iraqi "madman" will occupy Jordan next, and then
such trinkets will sell fast.</p>
<p>"I just hope," he says, smiling wanly, "that I am not here
when it happens."</p>
