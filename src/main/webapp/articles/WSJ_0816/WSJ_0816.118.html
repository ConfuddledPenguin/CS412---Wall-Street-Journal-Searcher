	<p class="article-leader">DENVER -- E.W. Scripps Co. said it will spend $100 million
on a new production center for the Rocky Mountain News. The
company plans to buy seven eight-unit Goss Colorliner offset
presses and new distribution equipment that will be installed
at the News's satellite production center.
   Color production at the News, a tabloid newspaper, is
constrained by its current production facilities. The new
presses will allow the paper to print up to 48 pages with
full color each day. The company said the result will be a
"more vibrant and attractive newspaper."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The News has a daily circulation of about 365,000 and a
Sunday circulation of about 415,000. The competing Denver
Post, owned by William Dean Singleton and Richard Scudder and
operated by MediaNews Group of Houston, has a daily
circulation of 247,000 and a Sunday circulation of 409,000.
Mr. Singleton said the News' plans will "bring them into the
20th century where everyone else is."</p>
<p>Separately, the News reported that it is interested in
taking a minority position in a baseball-ownership group if
Denver is awarded one of the planned National League
expansion teams. In an election Tuesday, Denver voters
approved the levy of a one-tenth of 1% sales tax to pay for a
new baseball stadium. The levy won't be imposed unless the
city gets a team.</p>
