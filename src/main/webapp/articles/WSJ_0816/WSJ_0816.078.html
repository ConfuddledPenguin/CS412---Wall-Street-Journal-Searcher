	<p class="article-leader">A judge ordered a stockbroker and a former printing-plant
employee to pay $66,099 for committing securities fraud by
trading on information from advance copies of Business Week.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission sued former
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. broker Brian Callahan of
Anaheim, Calif., and former print worker William Jackson of
Long Beach, Calif., in January. In May, a jury found that the
men had traded on confidential information.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The SEC charged that Mr. Jackson, who worked at the
Torrance, Calif., printing plant of R.R. Donnelly & Sons Co.,
one of the companies that prints Business Week for
McGraw-Hill Inc., traded on information from the magazine
before it hit the newsstands, and then passed the information
on to Mr. Callahan.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson ordered Mr. Callahan
to repay the $1,148.19 he made, plus $8,000 in commissions he
earned by trading on the information. He was also fined
$27,444.57, three times the amount he was ordered to return
and the maximum allowed under securities laws. Mr. Jackson
was ordered to repay profits of $19,506.99 and was fined
$10,000.</p>
