	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Marsh & McLennan Cos., one of the world's
largest insurance brokers, said it will place all of its
world-wide reinsurance brokerage operations under its Guy
Carpenter & Co. subsidiary.
   Marsh & McLennan said Richard H. Blum, president of Guy
Carpenter, will become chairman of the unit, which will split
reinsurance responsibilities between the New York and London
offices. Reinsurance is the assumption by an insurance
company of all or part of a risk initially undertaken by
another insurer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This new structure will ensure that all of our global and
local expertise and resources are available to existing and
prospective clients everywhere in the world," Mr. Blum said.</p>
<p>A New York operating committee will handle reinsurance
business in the U.S. and Canada, and a London-based operating
committee will handle that elsewhere in the world.</p>
