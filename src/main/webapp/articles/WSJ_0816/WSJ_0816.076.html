	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Iraq has just invaded Kuwait, and Larry Brady
is thumbing through documents to gauge the effect on his
company, a far-flung conglomerate called FMC Corp. Halfway
through, he stops and looks up in horror. Five new FMC
street-sweepers, worth $400,000, are on a freighter bound for
Kuwait City -- and they're just hours from their destination.
   "Get that ship turned around]" Mr. Brady, the executive
vice president, barks to Joe Murdock, international business
manager at FMC's sweeper division in Pomona, Calif. "Saddam
Hussein isn't getting his hands on those sweepers."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Murdock is already phoning the freighter's captain
when Mr. Brady calls. Take a quick turn into Abu Dhabi, Mr.
Murdock orders the captain, just in time.</p>
<p>It's crisis management time at FMC Corp., as at hundreds
of businesses across the U.S. and the world. For the past two
weeks, FMC executives have been meeting and moving nearly
nonstop to prevent damage -- for instance, by planning Middle
East evacuation routes for employees -- and to take advantage
of opportunities, such as gearing up factories in Malaysia to
speed production of oil-field equipment.</p>
<p>FMC, a manufacturer with $3.4 billion in annual sales, is
the 48th biggest exporter in the U.S. and has one of the
largest involvements in the Middle East. It has long wooed
that part of the world as a market for its array of armored
fighting vehicles, oil production and shipping equipment, and
agrichemicals. As a result, the Iraq-inspired economic chaos
is sparking widespread action at the company.</p>
<p>FMC executives are clogging each other's phone-mail files
with about 2,000 messages a day, more than twice the number
before the invasion. Nha Hoang, FMC's director of
international business, is staying up two hours later until 1
a.m. for his messages. He gets up at 6 a.m. and typically
finds at least three messages related to the Middle East
waiting for him.</p>
<p>At night, he watches Cable News Network while janitors
work around him in the employee lounge; they stop dusting and
watch with him when cameras fall on Saddam Hussein or
arriving U.S. troops.</p>
<p>Robert Malott, FMC's chairman and chief executive officer,
now checks his phone messages from home by 7 a.m. daily and
right before bed. The crisis even follows him to the
executive suite bathroom, where autographed photos of him
socializing with a half-dozen desert kings adorn the walls.
In their midst hangs a huge painting of Elvis Presley,
appropriately shedding a tear. "He was the King," says the
63-year-old Mr. Malott, laughing.</p>
<p>It's a rare moment of humor during the crisis. Every FMC
department is on alert: checking all contracts for deliveries
within 2,000 miles of Iraq to make sure banks outside the war
zone will guarantee payment; tactfully suspending
negotiations of long-erm sales contracts for fear of
inflation; hedging on the futures markets for such supplies
as aluminum in case of oil-driven price spirals.</p>
<p>They're hurriedly reassessing expansion plans, reviewing
marketing strategy, and revamping expense and profit
projections.</p>
<p>William Schumann III, FMC's treasurer, gets on the phone
to one of his company's Middle East experts. "What has
happened to the Bank of Kuwait?" he asks into the phone. And
then he repeats the answer: "We don't know?"</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty, the FMC executives know it's
important not to panic. Abrupt canceling of contracts in a
troubled region may insult customers and frighten prospects
who can't be won again when the danger passes. So Mr. Malott
is promising customers in the Middle East he will stick with
them if possible.</p>
<p>Mr. Malott knows there are some ways that the crisis could
benefit FMC. Several of Suddam Hussein's potential targets,
including Saudi Arabia and Turkey, had already ordered FMC
armaments before the invasion of Kuwait, and their shopping
list may lengthen now. In fact, opportunities to sell more
armaments appear to give FMC "more options than a mosquito in
a nudist camp," says James McClung, vice president of
international business.</p>
<p>The company dispatched oil-equipment salesmen to Alaska
last week on the chance that producers there will soon want
to drill or pump more crude. FMC's former top equipment
salesman in Saudi Arabia, who recently retired to rural
France, was abruptly wooed back to work and ordered to the
kingdom. FMC expects the Saudis to order additional
oil-production equipment to make up for some of the lost
Kuwaiti supplies.</p>
<p>Further hostilities could damage expensive oil-field
equipment whose replacement would require expansion of FMC
factories. So a new plant to make oil-related machinery in
Malaysia will open this month, several weeks earlier than
planned.</p>
<p>FMC might also benefit because it has recently ventured
into mining gold, which often rises in value during times of
turmoil (it has gone up 8% since the Iraqi invasion). Gold
production accounted for about 16% of FMC's $136.4 million
profit last year, so Mr. Schumann has increased his profit
projections both short- and long-term. But not all of his
revisions are complete, frustrating the roughly 10 securities
analysts who call daily -- twice the number before the
invasion.</p>
<p>There are also worrisome dangers for the company and some
of its 24,000 employees. The FMC man in Kuwait, a Palestinian
who requests anonymity, had a dead phone line the morning of
the invasion. He wasn't heard from for nine days.</p>
<p>When he finally phones Mr. Hoang, the director of
international business, the Palestinian says an overturned
16-wheel truck, blown up by a rocket, had blocked the nearest
highway, so he'd escaped across the desert to Saudi Arabia in
a friend's Chevrolet Caprice.</p>
<p>"Chevy is the new ship of the desert," replacing camels,
he exults. He complains that his own Caprice, which has a car
phone, was stolen by Iraqi troops on invasion day.</p>
<p>Mr. McClung's 39-member international-operations staff
quickly dedicates itself to devising possible evacuation
routes for other FMC employees stationed in Egypt, Turkey,
Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Oman, Pakistan and even Greece. The plans
include buying advance tickets on more than one airline out
of the area, filling personal cars with gasoline, studying
maps for routes across the desert and topping off water
bottles in case employees are stranded in remote terrain.</p>
<p>And FMC orders that all company officials traveling within
2,000 miles of Baghdad furnish full daily itineraries,
including the phone numbers of restaurants where they plan to
take clients to lunch.</p>
<p>A week after the invasion, FMC oil-equipment salesman
Colin Jaring reroutes his trip into Oman to avoid a
commercial airline flight over Saudi Arabia, where he fears
there might be fighting. Instead, he flies in through Egypt
and flies out over the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>He reports that Oman continues to yield hot sales
prospects.</p>
<p>At 2 a.m. on invasion day, Aug. 2, Mark Ahn, FMC's foreign
exchange manager, was awakened by his message beeper. His
London currency adviser warned that he should be making
trades to protect FMC's monetary exchange portfolio in the
wake of nervous fluctuations in the yen and several other
currencies. By dawn, Mr. Ahn had spread FMC's exposure more
heavily into U.S. dollars and British pounds. By the time he
arrived bleary-eyed in his office at 9 a.m., his day was
already seven hours old.</p>
<p>Mr. McClung first heard of the invasion from the chauffeur
of his hired limousine as he left a performance by the
Bolshoi ballet. He didn't know it, but FMC Chairman Malott,
who was arranging a high-level meeting for the morning, was
trying to reach him at the same time from Aspen, Colo.</p>
<p>At first, Mr. McClung was speechless. He waited until
seeing the morning's TV news before starting to phone
subordinates, U.S. government officials and customers from
Washington to Khartoum, Sudan, seeking information on
conditions in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Mr. Malott, an executive who has dined with both George
Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev, also desperately began seeking
information, dipping into FMC's network of political and
economic advisers from Washington to Istanbul.</p>
<p>But fresh facts from the Middle East have been rarer than
raindrops in that region. One midnight last week, an aide of
Mr. Malott phoned FMC's representative in Dubai to get the
latest. All the Dubai representative could offer was his
interpretation of what he had just seen on TV.</p>
<p>When the company does get news, it's often bad. The United
Arab Emirates had been interested in buying dozens of FMC
armored vehicles for $1.5 million apiece, and the U.S. Air
Force had agreed to transport one of them to the Emirates
this week for a test drive. But the Pentagon informed FMC
late last week that its planes would be busy transporting
U.S. troops into Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>FMC officials notified officers in the Emirates' army that
their 10-day test drive must be postponed indefinitely. This
was a major disappointment for Mr. McClung, who had arranged
for a half-dozen U.S. Army experts and 12 FMC armaments
specialists to hold mini-war-games with the armored vehicles.
They would train Emirates soldiers to drive them over sand
dunes, blast away at a few junked cars and, of course,
demonstrate how to adjust the air conditioning -- "the whole
damned show."</p>
<p>FMC has many other concerns throughout the region. FMC
officials wondered briefly last week if their 200 industrial
orange-juice squeezers on lease to Israel are in danger,
should that country be drawn into the conflict. But Mr.
Brady, who recently returned from the squeezing site,
reported to Mr. Malott that the Israelis are prepared to
protect the area where the juicers are.</p>
<p>Then there's Iran. If Iran should somehow get involved in
the conflict, that could cause problems for FMC too, because
FMC recently accepted a $15 million job to rebuild
oil-shipping facilities in Iran -- a project that could
become an easy target for Iraq. Iranian involvement seems
less likely now, what with Iraq offering yesterday to
formally settle the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war. But before that
move, FMC officials reviewed the wisdom of proceeding with
the Iranian contract. They decided to tell Iran that they
won't abandon contractual obligations, but that a lengthy
postponement might be in order.</p>
<p>The contract could be canceled altogether if the Persian
Gulf conflict escalates. Mr. Malott wants no part of the
Middle East if Iraq starts using chemical weapons. "In my
judgment, that will quickly start a tactical nuclear war. The
whole area could blow up," he says.</p>
<p>Until the economic sanctions ordered by the U.S. (and many
other nations), Iraq had also been a customer for FMC's
oil-production equipment and herbicides. But Iraq owes FMC
about $100,000. Before sending Saddam Hussein a dunning
letter, FMC will seek payment from Iraq's European bankers.
Its finance department expects to decide how to handle this
in the next month, depending on whether Saddam Hussein's
staff is busy with a war.</p>
<p>As of invasion day, FMC was manufacturing equipment or
parts to fill about 40 contracts with Kuwait, most of them
for petroleum-related equipment. What do they do with that
equipment now?</p>
<p>FMC officials cross-checked hundreds of contracts with
customers in safer climes to see whether the parts made for
the Kuwaitis can be used by somebody else. Three days of
crash research by FMC's department of international business
revealed that out of a $4 million inventory destined for
Kuwait, all but about $500,000 worth can be used elsewhere.
Some of the equipment was too tailor-made to substitute on
other contracts.</p>
<p>Another issue faces the company: Should it close its
300-employee oil-equipment plant in Singapore? All of its
current orders are from Kuwait. But instead of closing the
plant, the company has decided to retool it to accelerate
orders in its distant backlog from India and Indonesia, which
have longstanding orders to be filled after the production
for Kuwait is finished. "You have to think that with oil up
to $25 a barrel from $15, our customers won't want to wait,"
says Joseph Netherland, vice president of FMC's petroleum
machinery business.</p>
<p>In fact, after studying rapidly changing world oil
markets, FMC officials decided to go ahead with a $6 million
plan to expand oil-related manufacturing operations, an idea
previously scheduled for discussion by directors in October.
The move makes Mr. Malott, the CEO, uneasy. "We haven't made
money in the oil business for 10 years, but now there's
opportunity," he reasons.</p>
<p>That chance could dim fast if the Iraq crisis eases, he
concedes. But FMC is betting on its customers' gearing up for
consistently higher oil prices.</p>
<p>Together with all of the international crisis management,
FMC is also preparing for economic consequences at home. For
now, Mr. Malott is more worried about being overrun by
inflation than Iraqi troops. The day of the invasion, he
ordered a halt to new long-term, fixed-price contracts
anywhere in the world. "I'm concerned that for the last
decade, too few of our people on the firing lines have been
thinking about inflation. That's what you don't want to get
caught in the middle of," he says.</p>
<p>The invasion is throwing a wrench into FMC's plans to
restructure about $150 million in adjustable-rate debt. On
Aug. 2, "interest rates were almost down to the level we
wanted to switch with the banks to a fixed interest rate. But
now the fixed rates have edged out of our desired range,"
says Mr. Schumann. "So we're looking at an inflationary pop
from rising energy costs while we also have considerable
floating-interest-rate exposure. It isn't where we want to
be."</p>
<p>Rising fuel costs may prompt conservative FMC into a rare
gamble on energy futures trading, Mr. Schumann says. Much of
the natural gas used in FMC factories is purchased in the
spot market, where prices are soaring. "We have to come to
grips with our options," he says.</p>
<p>And even though aluminum prices haven't jumped yet, Mr.
Schumann's staff is starting to buy long-term aluminum
contracts to ensure that it can make a profit on the promised
sticker price of armaments.</p>
<p>Mr. Schumann faxed orders to controllers at 30 plants from
California to Venezuela to tabulate dozens of scenarios for
their expected costs of natural gas and diesel fuel. He
ordered the calculations at oil prices from $15 to $35 a
barrel. Those estimates are still pouring in and it will
probably be several weeks -- depending on whether fuel prices
stabilize -- before he can estimate how much FMC's profit
margins will erode this winter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Hoang, the director of international
business, monitors the Middle East via 18-hour days on the
telephone. Mr. Hoang, a former pilot in the air force of
South Vietnam, fires off orders to FMC officials en route to
appointments in the troubled Persian Gulf region.</p>
<p>The night after the invasion, a salesman phoned from Paris
to ask whether he should keep an appointment to push
herbicides in the Sudan the next day. "Just get your business
done and get out of there," Mr. Hoang replied.</p>
