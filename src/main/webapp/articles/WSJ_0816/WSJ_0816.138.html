	<p class="article-leader">The New Jersey Casino Control Commission disclosed
previously confidential documents concerning Donald J.
Trump's empire that show that the developer could have a
negative net worth of as much as $294 million.
   The documents also show that even with a $65 million bank
bailout and partial suspension of debt payments, Mr. Trump's
operations are expected to have a negative cash flow of $106
million between May 1990 and April 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The report lists Mr. Trump's debts as totaling $3.21
billion and his assets ranging in value from $2.91 billion to
$4.62 billion. The lower number is the value of the assets if
they were forced to be sold today, while the higher number
anticipates values in a few years if the economy improves. If
the higher figure were applied, Mr. Trump would have a net
worth of $1.41 billion.</p>
<p>Essentially the report spells out just how leveraged Mr.
Trump became in amassing over the past decade the assets he
fondly calls his "trophies." While the Plaza Hotel, Trump
Shuttle and Taj Mahal contributed to building Mr. Trump's
image as a purveyor of glitz, the documents show that the
purchases contributed to his near ruin.</p>
<p>The report could also be embarrassing to Mr. Trump's
bankers because it details exactly how much each of them lent
to him. On Tuesday, the banks signed the final documents
securing the $65 million bailout.</p>
<p>Through a spokeswoman, Mr. Trump declined to comment.</p>
<p>The documents were filed as part of Mr. Trump's petition
to have the commission, which must approve any major changes
in a casino's financing, clear the $65 million bailout. Mr.
Trump's lawyers, who tried to stop the release of the
documents, had claimed that the information contained in the
report could prove damaging to Mr. Trump if it became public.</p>
<p>The commission is scheduled to hold hearings today and
tomorrow, and is expected to issue a decision tomorrow.</p>
<p>If the commission rejects the bank deal, the banks would
then either have to put together another loan or declare Mr.
Trump in default of numerous loans on which he is by now
overdue.</p>
<p>Among the thousands of pages of released documents, the
most sensitive material appears to be a review of Mr. Trump's
assets that was performed by the accounting firm of Kenneth
Leventhal & Co. on June 14, 1990. That firm is working for
Mr. Trump and the banks to devise a financial plan to put the
Trump Organization on sound financial footing.</p>
<p>The accounting firm arrived at the numbers based on its
independent analysis and data provided by Mr. Trump. "We were
asked by the company at the request of the banks to come up
with a plan for the Trump Organization," said Stan Ross,
co-managing director of the firm. "Mr. Trump is not unique
among developers with this kind of problem."</p>
<p>The Leventhal report shows that, without the bailout, Mr.
Trump would be expected to spend $6.2 million on personal and
household expenses from May 1990 to April 1991. Under the
bank arrangement, his personal spending is limited to
$450,000 per month in 1990 ($5.4 million), $375,000 a month
in 1991 and $300,000 a month in 1992 and thereafter.</p>
<p>The report also anticipates that the cost of maintaining
Mr. Trump's yacht, the Trump Princess, would be $9.3 million
a year. The Trump Regency Hotel is expected to have a loss of
$5.6 million, the Trump Castle Hotel and Casino is slated for
a loss of $21.5 million, and the upkeep on a 70-acre real
estate vacant parcel in Manhattan is expected to cost Mr.
Trump $18.7 million.</p>
<p>Of 22 assets owned by Mr. Trump listed, three, including
the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, are
expected to show a profit in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>The documents anticipate that Mr. Trump's recently
published "Trump: Surviving at the Top," will net the
developer $1.1 million. Royalties from his board game will
amount to $261,000.</p>
<p>One person close to Mr. Trump said that were the Leventhal
documents to be prepared today, the valuations of his assets
would likely be even lower.</p>
<p>As for the banks, the Leventhal report indicates that
Citicorp's Citibank unit is by far Mr. Trump's biggest
creditor, having lent Mr. Trump $993 million. Of that amount,
about $320 million was believed to be personally guaranteed
by Mr. Trump. Citibank sold the majority of its loans to over
50 other lending institutions.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump also took out a total of $135 million in
unsecured loans, of which $104 million was lent by Bankers
Trust Co., a unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp. All told,
the amount Mr. Trump is believed to have borrowed that is
either unsecured or personally guaranteed is about $800
million.</p>
<p>He also borrowed $47 million from Boston Co.'s Boston Safe
Deposit & Trust Co. unit for the purchase of his Florida
residences, his yacht and "personal use."</p>
