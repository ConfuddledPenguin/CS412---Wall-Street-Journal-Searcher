	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Allegheny International Inc.'s expected
emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection after 2 1/2
years was delayed at the 11th hour for technical reasons.
   The postponement of the closing -- and a halt in the
company's stock trading on the New York Stock Exchange --
came after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission raised some
questions about the company's Chemetron unit, a shell company
that apparently still retains a nuclear license. The NRC must
approve any transfer of ownership or control when a nuclear
license is involved.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The delay doesn't appear to pose serious problems,
however. The bankruptcy court has already given final
approval to Allegheny's reorganization under a new name,
Sunbeam/Oster Corp. And the prospective owners, Japonica
Partners, indicated yesterday that they plan to work toward a
resolution giving it control of the consumer products
company.</p>
<p>Directors expect to install new top management, led by
Chairman Paul B. Kazarian, once ownership is officially
transferred to Japonica.</p>
