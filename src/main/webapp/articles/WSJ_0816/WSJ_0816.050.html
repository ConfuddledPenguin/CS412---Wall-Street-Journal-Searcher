	<p class="article-leader">In times like these memory is the first casualty. No harm
then in pausing for a moment to look back at history as old
as a day, a week, even three months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Did the Gulf States declare economic war on Iraq, thus
provoking Saddam Hussein's subsequent military invasion?</p>
<p>In the London Financial Times for Aug. 8, Lamis Andoni
reported from Amman that at the emergency Arab summit in
Baghdad in May, both Jordanian and Iraqi officials argued
that Kuwait's insistence on boosting oil production above
OPEC guidelines was part of the Gulf States' attempt to
undermine Iraq's emergence as the major regional power. King
Hussein's concerns were further heightened by indifference to
his pleas that Jordan's existence was endangered unless more
political and financial aid was forthcoming from the Gulf
States.</p>
<p>"Some Jordanian politicians also believe that {King}
Hussein has given up the idea of receiving any serious
American backing," Mr. Andoni wrote. "`We would not be very
surprised if some circles in Washington pushed for
sacrificing Jordan if necessary to ensure Israel's stability
and security,' a former Jordanian minister said in reference
to widespread speculation in Amman that the U.S. might
concede to Israeli extremist calls for the transformation of
Jordan into a substitute homeland for the Palestinians."</p>
<p>At the OPEC meeting in Geneva in July, Saddam Hussein said
that every dollar off the price of oil cost Iraq $1 billion
annually. Iran was being similarly injured by the
overproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Even
Saudi Arabia added its voice to Iraq's and Iran's protests.
Why then did Kuwait push ahead with overproduction despite
Iraq's increasingly threatening posture?</p>
<p>Is Saddam a monstrous tyrant, and if so, how did he get
that way?</p>
<p>He certainly is a monstrous tyrant, and the parallels with
Hitler are not entirely misplaced. Iraq has long had one of
the most appalling human-rights records in the world. In
1985, Amnesty International reported that 300 children, aged
10 to 14, had been tortured to extract information about the
activities of their relatives. Two years later the bodies of
29 youths, arrested in 1985, were returned to their parents
bearing the marks of their interrogation. Mass executions of
civilians have been frequent. In December 1987, some Kurds
were killed with thallium, a rat poison. In 1988, around
6,000 civilians, many of them Kurds, were killed in
chemical-weapon attacks.</p>
<p>Yes, the U.S. helped Saddam become the leader he is today,
even leaving aside the belief of many in the Middle East that
the CIA assisted Saddam's Baath Party in seizing control in
1963, giving it lists of communists who were then murdered.</p>
<p>To help Saddam win his eight-year war against Iran, the
U.S. gave him satellite intelligence, helicopters,
agricultural credits and naval protection in the Gulf. The
reason that a U.S. Navy vessel, the Vincennes, was able to
shoot down an Iranian civilian Airbus filled with innocent
people, is that it was in the Gulf aiding Iraq.</p>
<p>The U.S. supported Iraq in this fashion, though perfectly
aware of Saddam's abominations, as were the French, who lent
him fighter-bombers, the Germans, who made him mustard gas,
and the British, with whom he was a major trading partner. On
March 7, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, in which the
U.S. is very influential, decided not to take action on a
draft to bring human-rights violations in Iraq before it,
despite a mass of information provided by Amnesty
International.</p>
<p>On July 29, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near
Eastern affairs, Richard Murphy, was asked by the
International Herald Tribune whether he thought Saddam
resembled Hitler. Mr. Murphy thought the comparison "far too
glib" and said Saddam was "a rough, direct-talking leader."</p>
<p>Is the U.S.'s sudden discovery of the virtues of the U.N.
and of collective sanctions via the Security Council
hypocritical?</p>
<p>Very much so. If the U.S. truly adhered to the principle
enunciated by George Bush that "the acquisition of territory
by force is unacceptable," then its behavior in recent years
would have been very different. It would have exerted itself
in the U.N. Security Council to condemn Israel, which
continues to occupy and settle the Jordanian (Palestinian),
Syrian and Lebanese territories it seized in 1967, 1973 and
1982. It would not have been complaisant to Turkey's
occupation of northern Cyprus, seized in 1974. It would have
condemned Iraq's invasion of Iran in 1980. In that instance,
the Security Council did nothing for two weeks and then, when
Iraq was 40 miles inside Iranian territory, called for a
"cease-fire in place."</p>
<p>If the U.S. was truly principled in opposing aggression
against small nations and interference in their affairs it
wouldn't have attacked Cuba, Grenada, Nicaragua, Libya and
Panama. It wouldn't have sponsored attacks on Angola and
Mozambique or encouraged Indonesia's occupation of and
genocide in East Timor. It wouldn't have sanctioned Israel's
occupation of Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>T.S. Eliot wrote, in "Murder in the Cathedral," that "The
last temptation is the greatest treason:/To do the right deed
for the wrong reason." It was right to organize a collective
response under U.N. auspices against Saddam's takeover of
Kuwait, but justice is compromised and degraded if it is not
evenhanded, and perceived by everybody to be so.</p>
<p>The average "Arab in the street" is well aware of the lack
of evenhandedness and principle. The U.S. wants oil on its
terms, not Iraq's. As Robert Fisk of The Independent, in
London, wrote recently, "Oil decides. If Saudi Arabia were
just tens of thousands of miles of sandtrap, its people
living in abject poverty, its demands a drain on the world's
generosity, not a single American soldier would be deployed
in the area, whatever Iraq's ambitions."</p>
<p>To the disgust of most Americans and the immense joy of
Israel, many Palestinians openly support Saddam. There's
tragedy here, because Palestinians know better than most the
nature of Saddam, since their PLO leaders were long the
targets of terror and assassinations instigated by him. They
were comparing him to Hitler a decade ago, when the U.S. saw
him as the bulwark against Iran.</p>
<p>But just as many Palestinians in the occupied territories
see their future as a U.S.-sponsored catastrophe and probable
eviction into Jordan, they and fellow Arabs see the actions
today of the U.S. and its allies as the most coarsened
realpolitik. So they turn in support of the opposing coarse
real-politicker, Saddam, who had a point when he said that
Iraq would withdraw from Kuwait if Israel withdrew from the
territories and from Lebanon, and if Syria likewise withdrew
from Lebanon.</p>
<p>The U.S. dismissed this negotiating posture as
"irrelevant," but Saddam's points are not irrelevant at all,
because for the United States to use the U.N. and the
Security Council as a club only against Iraq and then revert
to the contemptuous indifference of the past 20 years would
be to deal the institution a irreparable blow in the eyes of
the rest of the world.</p>
