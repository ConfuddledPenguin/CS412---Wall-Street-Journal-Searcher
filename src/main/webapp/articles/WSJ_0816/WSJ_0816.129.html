	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The power blackout in parts of lower Manhattan
is slowing the routine intraday transfer of billions of
dollars by some big banks.
   The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which handles about
$900 billion of financial transfers on an average day for
banks, has been operating its payment settlement system later
in the day than usual this week to accommodate banks affected
by the power failure, according to a New York Fed spokesman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since the power outage hit Monday, the New York Fed itself
has been running essential services on diesel backup power.</p>
<p>Bankers said that since the power outage, the New York Fed
has told banks that it is prepared to move its own bank
clearing, or settlement, operations to a backup computer
system located in Pearl River, N.Y., should there be further
difficulties. Up to now, the New York Fed spokesman said, the
bank's clearing operations have been functioning normally
under the backup power at the bank's Liberty Street
headquarters.</p>
<p>Fedwire, the Federal Reserve's funds and securities
transfer service, connects Federal Reserve banks and
branches, U.S. government agencies -- including the Treasury
Department -- and roughly 8,000 depository institutions. It
is the main electronic payments system in the U.S.</p>
<p>In addition to about $900 billion that clears through
Fedwire daily in New York, the New York Fed handles the
transfer of a few billion in currency, checks and savings
bonds every day.</p>
<p>"If the diesel goes out, they have a problem," said one
banker. But so far it hasn't.</p>
<p>As Consolidated Edison Co. of New York worked to restore
power to the downtown area, some banks began having
difficulty with their emergency backup generators. Citicorp,
for example, said one of six emergency generators serving
operations at its 111 Wall Street office, the bank's main
computer center, failed yesterday, forcing the bank to shift
operations to other locations. A spokeswoman said the shift
"is causing minor delays to postings and we're working
overtime to catch up."</p>
<p>John F. Lee, president of the New York Clearing House
Association, which runs the Clearing House Interbank Payments
System, or CHIPS, said that some of the 140 banks that are
participants in the network have had problems clearing since
Monday afternoon, when the power outage hit. But he added
that the situation was improving. CHIPS is a computerized
network, owned by 11 New York banks, that is used for
transferring international dollar payments. On a normal day,
just under $1 trillion is cleared through the system.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee said that 25 banks were slow in settling through
CHIPS on Monday, but that by yesterday, the figure had been
reduced to "maybe a handful, five or six." Normally, the
CHIPS system is closed at 4:30 p.m. EDT for settlement at
6:00 p.m. On Monday, the system was kept open until 9:00
p.m.; on Tuesday, there were no problems.</p>
<p>"The only difficulty is a delay because of the power
problem," said Mr. Lee. The CHIPS network itself -- the main
center is located in Manhattan, backed up by computers in
Weehawken, N.J. -- hasn't experienced any difficulties.</p>
<p>Any bank that is unable to clear through CHIPS or the
Fed's transfer systems is usually obligated to pay other
banks -- and possibly the Fed if it has to borrow from the
central bank -- for the use of the funds not settled for an
extra day.</p>
<p>As of late last night, bankers said that Citibank and a
few other banks were slow in clearing through the two major
payments systems. Bankers estimated that on an average day,
Citibank, the nation's biggest, clears about $50 billion
through the two payment systems.</p>
