	<p class="article-leader">Atlantic Richfield Co. said that in response to the Middle
East crisis, it would continue to freeze wholesale gas,
diesel and jet fuel prices.
   Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield initially froze gas
prices last week for one week. The company said it was now
extending the freeze for an unspecified period. "We want to
comply with President Bush's request to hold the line on gas
prices," said an Atlantic Richfield Co. spokesman. The
company's sales have increased 10% since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, he added.</p>
