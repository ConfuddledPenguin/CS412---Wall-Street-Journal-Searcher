	<p class="article-leader">EC'S MIDDLE EAST TIES</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Worried that Western intervention against Iraq is stirring
up Arab nationalism and support for Saddam Hussein, the
European Community is trying to strengthen its ties to the
Middle East.</p>
<p>EC foreign ministers said they are ready to extend more
aid to Jordan, where a large percentage of the population
supports Iraq in the current crisis. In a bid to maintain
good relations with the nation, the EC has reminded Jordan
that it is entitled to EC subsidies and loans under a
cooperation accord covering the years 1987 to 1992.</p>
<p>Egypt also could be a recipient of increased EC aid,
sources said.</p>
<p>The Italian, Irish and Luxembourg foreign ministers --
along with EC Commissioner Abel Matutes, who is in charge of
EC Mediterranean policy -- are on a mission to Cairo, Amman
and Riyadh. Mr. Matutes could obtain the political backing he
has long sought for more EC help for the Mideast and North
Africa.</p>
<p>"We should avoid giving the impression that we are against
the Arab world," said one high official of the commission.</p>
<p>JAPAN'S POPULATION GROWTH SLIPS</p>
<p>Japan posted its lowest annual population growth rate
since a government survey began in 1968, the Home Affairs
Ministry reported. The increasing role of women in the work
place and the high cost of educating children were major
reasons for the sluggish 0.33% annual growth rate, an
official said. The lowest previous rate was 0.38% in 1989,
and the high was 2.22% in 1973. The latest report, for the
year ended March 31, listed Japan's population at 122.7
million.</p>
<p>DISEASE ON THE DON
</p>
<p>Seven people fell ill with cholera in southern Russia
along the Don River, apparently the result of raw sewage
flowing into the waterway, the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda reported. The seven were stricken in the community of
Koluzaevo, near the city of Rostov, about 600 miles south of
Moscow. The paper said about 2.8 million cubic feet of raw
sewage is pumped daily into the Temernik River, a tributary
of the Don, causing bacterial levels to increase up to 100
times more than the permissible level.</p>
<p>CULL OF THE WILD</p>
<p>Australia should turn wild camels and donkeys into steaks
to get rid of some of the millions of feral animals -- 26
species of them, including horses, goats, pigs and cats --
that are overrunning the continent, an official report
recommended. "The great isolated continent of marsupials has
been invaded," said the Bureau of Rural Resources, calling
for increased culling of the descendants of escaped or freed
pets and stock of the Europeans who first settled Australia
200 years ago. There is a large market for donkey meat in
Europe and China, and if stronger demand for camel meat
developed, camels could be farmed commercially, the report
said.</p>
<p>NO PLACE FOR HITLER</p>
<p>Potsdam, East Germany, stripped Adolf Hitler of his
honorary citizenship, more than 45 years after the Nazi
dictator's death. Potsdam officials also revoked the honorary
citizenship of Hermann Goering, the Nazi official who
directed Hitler's air war against the Allies. Potsdam
officials made Hitler an honorary citizen in March 1933, an
action mirrored in dozens of other German cities. In 1988,
when officials discovered they hadn't revoked the honor, they
hushed up the oversight to avoid the wrath of hard-line
Communists.</p>
<p>FINNISH VENTURE IN IRELAND</p>
<p>Nokia Oy AB, a Finnish manufacturer, will link up with
Jefferson Smurfit PLC, of Ireland to sell Nokia products in
Ireland. Nokia, whose consumer-electronics division is
Europe's third-largest maker of television sets, said the
marketing pact covers TV sets, video recorders, satellite
equipment and audio products. Smurfit, a paper, packaging and
financial-services group, is Ireland's largest industrial
company.</p>
<p>SOUTH AFRICA-MADAGASCAR LINK</p>
<p>South Africa repaired a 15-year breach with Madagascar and
established trade and transport links with the staunchly
anti-apartheid Indian Ocean island.</p>
<p>South African President F.W. de Klerk and President Didier
Ratsiraka of Madagascar sealed a trade pact under which the
two nations will explore cooperation in areas ranging from
agriculture and finance and banking to travel and tourism.</p>
<p>Mr. Ratsiraka said Mr. De Klerk's visit, the first by a
South African head of state to the world's fourth-largest
island, was made possible by political reforms in South
Africa.</p>
<p>The Madagascan president said in April that he would
restore economic ties with Pretoria, but that full diplomatic
relations would be established only when apartheid had been
fully dismantled.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Doctors in Bangladesh called off a 19-day nationwide
strike after the government promised to review a ban on
private practice. Hundreds of patients were reported to have
died from lack of care during the strike by the country's
8,000 doctors. . . . Bishops of the Anglican Church in Uganda
have voted to accept the ordination of women priests, the New
Vision newspaper reported. The church, established in Uganda
by British missionaries 110 years ago, has a current
estimated membership of about five million.</p>
