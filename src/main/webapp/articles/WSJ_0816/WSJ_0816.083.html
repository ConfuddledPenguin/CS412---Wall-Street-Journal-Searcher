	<p class="article-leader">The Food and Drug Administration regulates and inspects
the goods and services on which Americans spend 25% of their
personal income. It struggles to monitor more than $700
billion of economic activity with a budget of just $700
million. The situation is steadily growing more critical.
Already, the biotechnology explosion and a rise in new drug
and device applications threatens to overwhelm the agency.
   For example, because of a shortage of manpower, it takes
the FDA about 30 months to decide whether to license a new
drug or medical device. That 30 months reflects just the
waiting period, not 30 months of testing. This period can be
difficult for even the largest companies to weather and
absolutely tragic for individuals needing treatment. At the
beginning of this year, the agency was behind on 67 new drug
applications and last year alone there were more than 7,000
new medical devices submitted for approval.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The number of full-time FDA employees, excluding those
focused solely on AIDS research, has dropped by 13% since
1980. The quality of personnel also is at risk now that the
gap between private- and public-sector salaries for medical
researchers is larger than ever. Top scientists can make
between two and five times their government salaries in the
corporate or academic world.</p>
<p>Growing delays in the arrival of new pharmaceutical and
medical products, coupled with a shortage of capable
scientists, could have a potentially staggering effect on the
public health, the health-care industry and the national
economy as a whole. Exports of U.S. medical products took
$1.8 billion off the trade deficit last year. America can't
afford to keep medically sound products locked in the lab.</p>
<p>The health industry can help revitalize the FDA by
implementing an idea most health companies and their
lobbyists vigorously oppose. (Indeed, a few years back I was
opposed to the idea as well.)</p>
<p>That idea is user fees. In view of the current budget
outlook, imposing these fees on companies submitting new
drugs and devices for approval is the best way to ensure the
FDA keeps up with its responsibilities. Regulated industries
must begin paying for some of the benefits they receive.</p>
<p>With so much at stake, I do not believe the
medical-products industry can risk working under a
permanently weakened FDA. User fees are an investment with
positive returns. User fees would speed up the review
process, enabling a company to get a new product on the
market faster.</p>
<p>The Bush administration has already proposed this remedy.
User fees would be paid to finance an FDA review of a new
medical product. The administration estimates that these and
other FDA-related fees could add $150 million to the agency's
annual budget. This would be a good start in alleviating many
of the staffing shortages, delays and unmet obligations now
limiting the agency's performance.</p>
<p>However, it is important that FDA user fees be used to
improve the FDA, and not be used as a bait-and-switch tactic
for other interests such as purchasing B-1 bombers or
balancing the budget. If the private health-care industry is
going to finance public review, then 100% of these fees
should go back into building truly adequate health-care
regulation, and that means these fees should be added to
current appropriations -- not be a substitute.</p>
<p>User fees are not the only once-forbidden idea the
health-care industry should support. Another public health
issue has been identified by Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.),
who has proposed closing a 1976 loophole that allows a great
number of new medical devices to enter the market without
ever going through the proper regulatory process. Under
current practices, many health products can be sold if they
are "substantially equivalent" to another device already on
the market in 1976 -- even though the equipment already for
sale was never formally approved.</p>
<p>Other than low-risk devices like bedpans, it is hard to
imagine that many new devices could be considered
"substantially equivalent" to one already on the market in
1976. Technology has changed too much since then.</p>
<p>Both health-product companies and the FDA rely on the
"substantially equivalent" rule, each for its own reasons.
Manufacturers can sell a product sooner and avoid the burden
of conducting extensive tests and the FDA can escape the
time-consuming process of reviewing those tests.</p>
<p>But substantial testing accomplishes more than just
keeping a few bad products off the market; it also allows
manufacturers to develop a more complete set of instructions
for physician and patient use. A well-designed but improperly
used device can be as dangerous as a device that has never
been tested. We need to close the "substantially equivalent"
loophole and put new medical devices, with real risks,
through at least some measure of FDA oversight while ensuring
that the agency has the resources to do it.</p>
<p>The health care industry needs to get on the side of an
agency it is used to fighting. Our public and economic health
depend on it.</p>
