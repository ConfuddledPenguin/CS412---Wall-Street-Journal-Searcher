	<p class="article-leader">DODGEVILLE, Wis. -- Lands' End Inc., hurt by discount
sales needed to clear out excess inventory, reported a
surprising loss of $2.2 million, or 12 cents a share, for its
second quarter ended Aug. 3.
   The catalog-sales concern, which in recent quarters has
been troubled by sluggish sales and swelling inventories, had
been expected to report a downturn in earnings from the
year-earlier period's $2.2 million, or 11 cents a share. But
the lowest estimates didn't foresee a loss.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest period's loss came despite a 12% increase in
sales, to $117.1 million from the year-earlier $104.2
million.</p>
<p>Liquidations of excess inventory represented about 16% of
overall sales during the latest quarter, compared with about
10% a year earlier. The company also said that selling,
general and administrative expenses climbed 22% --
significantly higher than the sales growth.</p>
<p>The announcement came after the stock market closed.
Analysts are likely to react today, cutting full-year
earnings estimates that had averaged around $1.25 a share
compared with $1.45 a share a year earlier.</p>
<p>But Sharon Rappaport, a Montgomery Securities analyst,
said the news isn't all bad. "They've taken the first step in
addressing their problem," she said. Ms. Rappaport has been
saying for some time that Lands' End's inventories are too
high and its merchandise is dull.</p>
