	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- First Executive Corp. said holders redeemed
about $1.2 billion of its insurance policies in the second
quarter, a slight decline from the previous period but an
indication that the insurance holding company remains under
financial pressure.
   The company also disclosed that it may cut or eliminate
dividends on its preferred stock and has approached senior
lenders about a financial restructuring.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, in an interview, William L. Sanders, the
company's recently named chief financial officer and vice
president, said First Executive's board yesterday declared
dividends on all classes of preferred stock. Mr. Sanders said
"our intent is to evaluate the payment of dividends every
quarter, depending on what happens to the company."</p>
<p>The latest, closely watched tally of redemptions at First
Executive, disclosed in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, is 17% lower than the $1.45 billion
reported for the first quarter but sharply higher than the
$389 million of the year-earlier second quarter. First
Executive said redemptions currently are at lower rates than
in the previous two quarters.</p>
<p>Policy redemptions or "surrenders" can be troubling to
insurance companies because they require cash payouts, affect
balance sheet ratios, and can force untimely sales of
investments.</p>
<p>First Executive's surge in surrenders has in large part
been prompted by an $859 million write-down announced earlier
this year on its junk bond-dominated investment portfolio.
That write-down was effective Dec. 31, 1989.</p>
<p>The company, which Tuesday reported a 40% drop in
second-quarter net income, said in its SEC filing that
surrenders, withdrawals and policy loan activity have
declined lately from peaks in the first six months of the
year. Moreover, the company has said repeatedly that it has
what it believes are more than sufficient reserves of cash
and short-term securities to meet redemption demands.</p>
<p>However, worries persist about the apparent onrush of
redemptions and the company itself has noted that its
investment options are constrained by increasingly stringent
regulatory oversight. Cash and short-term investments
declined to $1.83 billion at June 30, from $2.30 billion at
March 31, but were up sharply from the $741 million at June
30, 1989. First Executive has been selling longer-term
securities, amassing the cash cushion to meet redemption
demand.</p>
<p>In one analyst's view, the public continues to hold strong
concerns about First Executive. Surrenders in the latest
quarter "went from absolutely horrendous to merely
horrendous," said the analyst, William Bitterli of
Northington Partners Inc., an investment concern based in
Avon, Conn.</p>
<p>First Executive stock closed at $2.375 a share, unchanged
in national over-the-counter trading. The stock has declined
from a 52-week peak of $13.625 a share.</p>
<p>Concerning its preferred dividends, First Executive said
its ability to draw dividends and other cash from its
insurance units may well be constrained and that the holding
company can't be certain that it will be able to raise funds
from other sources.</p>
<p>First Executive said it may need relief from its financial
obligations. The company said it believes "it will likely be
necessary to reduce or eliminate its preferred stock dividend
obligations and to reduce or defer payments {on its bank debt
and senior notes} in the future, given the circumstances."</p>
<p>First Executive said it is in preliminary talks with
senior lenders concerning possible changes in the company's
structure, capitalization, or overall organization. It didn't
elaborate.</p>
<p>Last year, First Executive paid $44 million in preferred
stock dividends. It has about $156 million face value of
preferred stock outstanding in four issues. The parent
company has $100 million in bank debt and $175 million face
amount of senior notes outstanding. First Executive doesn't
pay a dividend on its common stock.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders, the new chief financial officer, said the
company hadn't presented firm proposals to its banks about a
financial restructuring but that it had offered various
suggestions, including possible new borrowings or easing of
terms on the existing debt. He said talks currently are
adjourned for a Japanese bank vacation period.</p>
<p>The company declared a dividend of 53.125 cents per
depositary preferred share of its Series E adjustable-rate
preferred stock, payable Oct. 1, to stock of record Sept. 14.
On its Series F cumulative preferred stock, the company
declared a dividend of 71.875 cents per depositary share,
payable Oct. 15 to stock of record Oct. 1. On its Series G
cumulative convertible preferred stock, a dividend of 39.0625
cents per share was declared, payable Sept. 17 to stock of
record Aug. 31. And on the Series H cumulative convertible
preference stock, the company said it will pay a dividend of
0.2919708 additional share of depositary Series H stock per
share on Sept. 30 to stock of record Sept. 15.</p>
<p>On another matter, First Executive said it had passed a
corporate bylaw reducing the number of directors to five from
six, following the July 30 resignation of E. Benjamin Nelson,
an Omaha, Neb., lawyer. Mr. Nelson, a gubernatorial candidate
in Nebraska, has been attacked by political opponents about
his tie to First Executive.</p>
