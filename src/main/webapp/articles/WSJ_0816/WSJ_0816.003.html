	<p class="article-leader">Makers of margarines and shortenings may be unwittingly
turning a benign fat into an unhealthy one.
   This is the implication of a Dutch experiment that found
that a form of fat, created when vegetable oils are
hydrogenated into margarine and shortening, tends to raise
blood levels of LDL, or "bad" cholesterol, and decrease HDL,
or "good" cholesterol. This type of change in blood
cholesterol levels has been linked to coronary heart disease.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The report by Dutch scientists, based on an experiment
with 59 health volunteers, is published in this week's New
England Journal of Medicine. In an editorial accompanying the
report from the Netherlands, a prominent U.S. nutrition
researcher called for a change in the way margarines and
shortenings are produced and labeled.</p>
<p>The U.S. scientist, Scott M. Grundy, urged that food
labeling be changed to list specific cholesterol-raising
fats. At present, food labels give the percentages and
calories of each of three classes of fats -- saturated,
monounsaturated and polyunsaturated. This labeling is based
on the assumption that polyunsaturated fats lower blood
cholesterol while saturated fats raise it. New research,
including the Dutch report, shows that this assumption is no
longer valid, Dr. Grundy wrote.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Procter & Gamble Co., the big
Cincinnati-based food processor and consumer products
concern, said, "We have a number of serious concerns about
whether the findings are relevant for people eating a typical
American diet." He explained that Dutch researchers used
several times as much of the implicated fat in their test as
the average American eats.</p>
<p>Elaine Ault, a spokeswoman for the International Food
Information Council, which is funded by the food industry,
suggested that "the public refrain from making any dietary
changes based on just one study in which the subjects
consumed extremely high levels" of fats "for a relatively
short time."</p>
<p>Ms. Ault said the amount of implicated fat given to the
subjects was about four times greater than is normally
consumed by Americans. Also, the study was three weeks long,
and it takes longer than that for blood cholesterol levels to
stabilize, Ms. Ault said.</p>
<p>The Dutch experiment was undertaken because of questions
about the health effects of changing the molecular geometry
of food when processors hydrogenate soybean, peanut,
sunflower and other vegetable oils. Hydrogenation hooks
hydrogen atoms onto carbon atoms of the fat, causing the
liquid vegetable oil to solidify.</p>
<p>Hydrogenation was developed early in this century to
prevent vegetable oils from becoming rancid. Partial
hydrogenation produced the semi-solid shortenings, epitomized
by P&G's Crisco, first marketed in 1911, that rapidly became
a cheap, plentiful and popular substitute for lard in
cooking. Margarines, peanut butter and a host of similar food
products, including the fats used in commercial baked goods,
also are partially hydrogenated vegetable oils.</p>
<p>In addition to hooking hydrogen atoms to carbon atoms,
hydrogenation causes a geometrical change in some fat
molecules. Fat molecules occurring naturally in vegetable
oils are in the "cis-" configuration that has a kink or bend
in the molecule. The kink prevents the oil from solidifying.
One effect of hydrogenation is to straighten out the molecule
by converting it to the "trans-" form.</p>
<p>One of the fats that undergoes this change, oleic acid, is
an unsaturated fat, the kind that until now has been used to
lower cholesterol levels. The Dutch experiment was undertaken
to see if the trans form of oleic acid had any different
effect on blood cholesterol than the cis form.</p>
<p>For their experiment at the Agricultural University in
Wageningen, the Dutch scientists, Ronald P. Mensink and
Martijn B. Katan had a research laboratory of the Unilever
Group, the big Anglo-Dutch food processor, partially
hydrogenate sunflower oil so that half its oleic acid was
converted to the trans form. They used this form of oleic
acid to make margarines and shortenings that were rich in the
trans form of the unsaturated fat.</p>
<p>The 34 healthy women and 25 healthy men were then asked to
eat the special foods for three weeks, during which time
their cholesterol levels were measured. The volunteers then
switched for three weeks to a diet rich in the more natural
or cis form of oleic acid. Then in the third part of the
experiments, the volunteers ate a diet rich in saturated
fats, the kind that raises cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>As expected, the saturated fat diet raised blood
cholesterol levels an average of 21 milligrams per deciliter
of blood plasma over the levels recorded when the volunteers
were eating the diet with the natural cis form of oleic acid.</p>
<p>The key finding, however, was that the diet rich in the
trans form of oleic acid created by hydrogenation raised
total cholesterol levels by an average of 10 milligrams.
Moreover, the level of HDL, the "good" cholesterol, dropped
by seven milligrams when the volunteers switched to the trans
diet from the cis diet. At the same time, the level of LDL,
the "bad" kind, rose an average of 14 milligrams.</p>
<p>In his editorial, Dr. Grundy, who is at the University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, noted that the
trans forms of fats make up only 3% to 4% of the total
calories in the average U.S. diet. "Superficially, they
appear to be of little importance," he wrote. But, he argued,
if Americans are going to be make substantial cutbacks in the
amount of cholesterol-raising fats they consume, then they
will have to cut back on a wide variety of foods, including
hydrogenated oils containing trans forms of unsaturated fats.</p>
<p>The nutritionist also noted that recent research,
including his own experiments, had found that, contrary to
previous assumptions, one of the saturated fats, stearic
acid, doesn't increase cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>"We are now faced with the paradox that a saturated fatty
acid, stearic acid, does not increase serum cholesterol
levels, whereas monounsaturated fatty acids of the trans
variety do," Dr. Grundy wrote. For this reason, he argued,
labeling fats in foods as merely saturated, monounsaturated
and polyunsaturated isn't meaningful any longer. "Instead,
the various culpable acids should be grouped together as
cholesterol-raising fatty acids."</p>
<p>Dr. Grundy also suggested that food processors could
reduce the amount of the trans fatty acids in margarines and
shortenings by reducing the degree of hydrogenation and by
blending more natural fats into the products instead to get
the desired consistency.</p>
