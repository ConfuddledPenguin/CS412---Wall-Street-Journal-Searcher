	<div class="article-body"><p>IN HARLEM, THE LAW IS "THE MAN" and the man is rarely
viewed as a friend. New York City's lawyers are trying to
change that by showing teen-agers that the law can help as
well as hurt, and offer a career as well. To prove it, three
Manhattan law firms opened their doors this summer to give
Harlem teen-agers a chance to experience the real world of
private practice.</p>
<p>Robert Stephan Cohen, managing partner of a 50-lawyer
firm, has long been concerned about the decline of the
quality of life in New York City. (When his children started
school on Manhattan's Upper East Side, for instance, he hired
bodyguards to escort them.) He was also convinced that
private business had to help find a solution. He discovered a
chance to do that with a Harlem school program called Legal
Outreach, which a Harvard Law graduate from Atlanta, James
O'Neal, had started seven years ago.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Neal, full-time director of Legal Outreach, has been
using Harlem schools to deliver his idea that "the law can be
used to better the quality of your lives" to 500 students a
year.  He tailors his teaching to Harlem's facts of life,
showing how the law relates to housing, to rents, to arrests
and to family relations. Three years ago, he began to offer
summer internships, first in the Manhattan district
attorney's office, later with the New York City Corporation
Council. Mr. Cohen gave him a chance to move his charges into
professional private practice.</p>
<p>Mr. Cohen and his partners got their first two interns
this July, and four more teen-agers spent six summer weeks
with two other medium-sized Manhattan firms. (All interns are
paid minimum wage during their stay.) Mr. Cohen's candidates
were both 16-year-olds, one from the Bronx High School of
Science, the other from the Manhattan Center for Science and
Mathematics. To supervise their summer, two of Mr. Cohen's
young associates, Frank McClain Sewer and Amy Reiss,
scheduled and shepherded the new arrivals through the firm's
various departments -- litigation, matrimonial, tax, labor,
etc.</p>
<p>The rationale, Mr. Cohen says, was to use the students,
not as go-fers, but as full-fledged legal assistants. They
accompanied lawyers to court (Messrs. Sewer and Cohen are
litigators), researched cases in the firm's library (a course
Legal Outreach has set up in the public schools), and in
general functioned like trained paralegals. All three firms
followed similar regimens, plus extracurricular dinners,
visits with judges in their chambers, museum trips and
theater parties.</p>
<p>The Legal Outreach program, financed by Harlem's School
District 5, the U.S. Department of Education and the New York
Community Trust, had already created cadres of teen-agers
with a potential interest in the law. Besides classroom
instruction, every year 64 of them are chosen to take part in
mock trials staged at Columbia Law School, with practicing
attorneys taking part and sitting judges from New York courts
presiding.</p>
<p>For the venture into private practice, Mr. Cohen and the
other participating lawyers arranged for a foundation grant
of $15,000 that Legal Outreach used to prep the chosen
interns in special Saturday training sessions.</p>
<p>The first six-weeks' venture of Legal Outreach into
private practice ended with a graduation bash at Penthouse
publisher Robert Guccione's East Side town house. (Mr.
Guccione's wife and co-publisher, Kathy Keeton, has made
Harlem her major avocation.) With Mayor David Dinkins's wife,
Joyce, presiding, the six young interns were turned loose to
return to their schools after experiencing what Outreach
director O'Neal called "another side of life."</p>
<p>Lawyer Cohen thinks that the three firms in the program
got as much out of it as did the interns. The intern plan, in
his view, has proved itself and next summer he hopes to see
perhaps 35 new interns take part in a two-month program. "New
York law firms," he says, "are lining up to have a share in
it."</p>
