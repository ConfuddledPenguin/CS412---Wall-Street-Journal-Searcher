	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Occidental Petroleum Corp. said its MidCon
Corp. subsidiary will redeem on Sept. 17 all $175 million
outstanding of two debenture issues at 100% of their
principal amounts.
   The company said the redemptions, which will result in
lower interest expense, are part of its continuing program to
lengthen maturities of long-term debt. The debentures being
called are the $100 million outstanding of 13% series due
Sept. 15, 1993, and $75 million of 13 3/8% series due Oct.
15, 1994.</p>
