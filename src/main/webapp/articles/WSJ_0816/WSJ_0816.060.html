	<p class="article-leader">NEW AUTO INSURANCE laws dent availability of coverage.
   Various states' rate-rollback orders cause some firms to
delay writing new policies until their rate disputes are
settled. "Insurance is still available, but at a very high
cost," says consumer activist Virginia Knauer. Some
Pennsylvania carriers write new policies only for kin of
existing clients. Assigned-risk plans, with rates 65% higher
than average, take up the slack. Assignments to California's
risk pool, where rates are actually low, rose 58% in 1989.
But drivers there who aren't "white, upper middle-class" find
coverage hard to get, says consumer activist Harvey
Rosenfield.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some consumers are benefiting, though. Pennsylvanians "who
couldn't afford insurance before are buying it now," says
Philadelphia insurance agent Robert Stevenson. But the road
ahead may get bumpy, if carriers exit markets where they say
premiums don't cover costs. New Jersey steps up pressure to
block an ITT Corp. unit from withdrawing; State Farm stops
writing new policies there. "It's going to get a lot worse,"
Mr. Stevenson says. A South Carolina agent loses three
carriers in a month.</p>
<p>Former insurance regulators in New Jersey set up a
reciprocal exchange, where drivers indemnify each other.</p>
<p>YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE JEWISH to buy kosher, food firms
discover.</p>
<p>Health-conscious folk see "benefits in the quality control
and lack of additives" in kosher foods, says Stephen F. Hall,
a consultant. Sales of the products, which are made according
to Jewish dietary law, approach $1.5 billion: growth is put
at about 10% a year. Coors is the first U.S. beer certified
kosher, although there's nothing inherently un-kosher about
beer. Thompson Medical's Slim-Fast diet aids also go kosher.
Most of the $1.7 billion of foods CPC International
distributes are certified kosher.</p>
<p>Kosher Club Inc. ships strictly kosher meals overnight;
firms "panic" when they learn they will be entertaining an
Orthodox Jewish client, says Stephen Ostrow, president. Rabbi
Yosef Wikler says kosher certification groups doubled to 97
world-wide in the past five years. Rep. Solarz (D., N.Y.)
introduces a bill to ensure kosher products are certified,
citing potential for abuse.</p>
<p>CREDIT-CARD BUYER protection plans grow popular, but
limits start appearing.</p>
<p>Firms lure customers by insuring card-purchased items
against loss, damage or theft. Citibank's Visa and MasterCard
customers consider the plans "one of the most important
services" the cards provide, says Richard Srednicki, business
manager. American Express gets 300,000 claims totaling $45
million since the plan started in 1987. Some banks extend the
plans to cover checking accounts and ATM cards. Among the
stranger claims: A shower stall lost on a highway and a
camera broken in a safari brawl with chimpanzees.</p>
<p>But costs to issuers can be substantial: Citibank spends
$20 million a year for the service, estimates Spencer Nilson,
who publishes an industry newsletter. "The number of claims
is alarming," he says, and fraud is increasing. As of Oct. 1,
American Express holders will leave home with less
protection: A claim will be limited to $1,000, from $50,000.
Items stolen from cars also will be excluded. Consumer group
Bankcard Holders of America warns of such restrictions.</p>
<p>Making a claim isn't easy. Serial numbers are required.
"It sounds good but it's a hassle," Mr. Nilson says.</p>
<p>DATA ON THE FLY: New York Telephone puts computer
information services at Kennedy Airport, and plans tests at
La Guardia. Services range from stock prices to plane
reservations. Cost is 25 cents to access. Other charges,
billed via calling card, vary. Nynex explores use of credit
cards.</p>
<p>DIAPER DILEMMA? IGI Inc. patents a diaper it says uses a
biodegradable material with enzymes that speed breakdown even
in landfill conditions. But environmentalists are dubious,
and still lean toward reusable cotton diapers.</p>
<p>ANIMAL FARM Petting Zoo in Manorville, N.Y., takes in
alligators, cattle, horses, parrots, rabbits, dogs and cats.
They come in for a fee, go out for a donation.</p>
<p>CAMPUS HEADHUNTERS arrive as turnover of top
administrators rises.</p>
<p>Fund-raising duties increase pressure, shorten tenure for
presidents. That boosts demand for recruiters to fill posts.
Among the hunted: new presidents at Johns Hopkins, Ohio
State. Heidrick & Struggles Inc. has 5,000 prospects; it ran
60 academic searches last year. Recruiters don't substitute
for internal search panels. But they generate "short lists,"
and help with advertising, paper work and background checks.
Fees run one-third of first-year salaries, which can top
$200,000.</p>
<p>Firms vie for prestige jobs, but Harvard won't say whether
it will use one in its presidential search. Brandeis will,
choosing from eight firms. Although no one wants to be seen
as a "jumper," deans or provosts who stay put more than five
years are "fair game" for recruiters, says John D. Phillips
of Korn/Ferry International. Gaining ground on the wish lists
for presidents: academic stature and public relations savvy.</p>
<p>Headhunting for professors may rise as academic
specialties narrow and Ph.D. pools shrink.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: New York exterminators concerned about how their
image flies with the public will discuss how they're
portrayed at a screening tonight of Arachnophobia. . . .
T.B.U. Racquet Sports Pro Shop takes calls 24 hours a day for
racquet restringing from New Yorkers who play at night.</p>
