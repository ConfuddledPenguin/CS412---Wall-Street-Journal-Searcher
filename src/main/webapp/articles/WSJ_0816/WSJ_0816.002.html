	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration unveiled its first
energy strategy to cope with oil-supply disruptions in the
Middle East and identified ways to reduce U.S. dependence on
foreign oil as much as 550,000 barrels a day by year end.
   But the reductions, which would replace much of the
610,000 barrels a day the U.S. bought from Iraq and Kuwait,
rely heavily on voluntary cooperation from industry, local
governments and consumers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plan, which puts inflating automobile tires at the top
of its list of energy-saving measures, steers clear of
mandating consumer behavior and of the most controversial
means of reducing the use of foreign oil, such as opening up
an Alaska wilderness area to oil drilling or tightening
fuel-economy standards for new cars.</p>
<p>"It sounds good, but it's marginal and it doesn't go far
enough," said Eli Bergman, head of the non-profit policy
group Americans for Energy Independence.</p>
<p>The measures announced by the Energy Department envision
that by the end of the year domestic energy supplies can be
increased 270,000 barrels a day and demand can be reduced
280,000 barrels a day. Energy Secretary James Watkins said
much of the savings could be made within 90 days, quickly
replacing the equivalent of 400,000 barrels of imported oil.</p>
<p>Mr. Watkins called the steps "prudent" but said there is
no energy crisis. "Today's supplies are adequate," he told
reporters.</p>
<p>He said the plan, which comes two weeks after Iraq shocked
world oil markets by invading Kuwait, is only the first
installment of steps under consideration by energy officials
and the White House. More could come as soon as two weeks, he
said.</p>
<p>Officials reiterated the White House's stand that there is
no need to dip into the government's Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, and they expressed confidence that other nations
will pump enough extra oil to make up for embargoed Kuwaiti
and Iraqi oil.</p>
<p>Still, officials called on U.S. consumers to do their part
to head off an oil shortage by making a few simple changes in
driving practices.</p>
<p>Inflating tires on vehicles to the proper pressure would
improve gasoline mileage and save 100,000 barrels of oil a
day. Surveys show about half of drivers' tires are
underinflated.</p>
<p>The government is also urging drivers to do more
car-pooling and van-pooling, saving 90,000 barrels a day with
only 20% more ride-sharing; observe speed limits to save
50,000 barrels a day; and drive the most energy-efficient car
if there's a choice. If one out of five two-car families in
the U.S. drove the car that gets the higher gasoline mileage,
the U.S. would save 40,000 barrels of oil a day, the
government said.</p>
<p>"It's the kind of things that are not really asking you to
turn off your air-conditioning or turn off your heat in
winter, but simple things that can have an impact," said
Deputy Energy Secretary Henson Moore.</p>
<p>On the supply side, officials said that British Petroleum
Co., Exxon Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co. have agreed to
boost production by 50,000 barrels a day from the North Slope
of Alaska, where they already produce 1.8 million barrels a
day. Those producers also said that an expansion project
under way in the Alaska oil fields can be counted on to boost
production a further 90,000 barrels a day starting in
November and as much as 140,000 barrels a day in six months.</p>
<p>The government will increase its production from U.S.
naval petroleum reserves by 5,000 barrels a day by October,
Mr. Watkins said.</p>
<p>But the bulk of measures the government is counting on to
replace Kuwaiti and Iraqi oil in the short term -- a total of
215,000 barrels under its plan -- aren't guaranteed to
succeed.</p>
<p>The Energy Department, as reported earlier, will mediate a
California dispute that is keeping 200 million to 300 million
barrels of oil locked under the ocean floor. Mr. Watkins said
top-level officials of Chevron Corp. "are encouraging our
coming in and acting as a facilitator" between oil producers
and Santa Barbara County officials.</p>
<p>Mr. Watkins said he hopes that the dispute over the Point
Arguello project can be resolved within six months and that
the three completed offshore oil platforms, which have been
sitting idle for 2 1/2 years, can be pumping 75,000 barrels a
day by year end. They eventually could produce as much as
100,000 barrels a day. The oil is caught up in a controversy
over whether to move it by tanker or pipeline to refineries
130 miles down the coast.</p>
<p>The Energy Department is ordering all its vehicles
switched to gasohol -- a blend of gasoline and 10% alcohol
fuel -- and other government agencies will be approached to
make the switch. The department is urging producers of
ethanol, an alcohol fuel, to produce at full capacity. The
department isn't taking any other steps to mandate wider use
of gasohol, but is counting on increased usage to replace
10,000 barrels of oil a day.</p>
<p>The government said it also intends to work with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and state utility
commissions to remove obstacles and possibly increase
pipeline capacity to allow more industries to switch from oil
to more plentiful natural gas. They are banking on the shift
to offset 100,000 barrels a day of foreign oil. Some
dual-fuel plants have already switched.</p>
<p>Officials also are counting on persuading oil-producing
states to relax regulations on "allowables" that restrict
certain well production, for an extra 30,000 barrels a day.</p>
<p>"It's wildly optimistic," said Ed Rothschild, head of a
Washington lobbying group on consumer and labor issues. "If
you want to talk about where the oil is and where you can get
immediate access to it, it's in the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. It was designed for this purpose and it ought to be
used for this purpose."</p>
<p>The Energy Department also urged independent oil producers
to increase production. But Mr. Watkins said he doesn't
anticipate a reversal in declining U.S. oil drilling unless
oil prices of about $25 a barrel persist for six months or so
and give drillers the incentive to make long-term
investments.</p>
