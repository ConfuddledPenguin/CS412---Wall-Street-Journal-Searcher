	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A presidential panel recommended significant
and potentially controversial changes to speed the
availability of new medicines to people facing death from
cancer and AIDS.
   Patients suffering from life-threatening illnesses "can't
afford the luxury of waiting for drug development and
regulation to move as slowly as they usually do," the
National Committee to Review Current Procedures for Approval
of New Drugs for Cancer and AIDS said in a report presented
to President Bush yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The panel urged the Food and Drug Administration to speed
the approval of new drugs by shortening required tests,
paying more attention to effectiveness when trying to balance
the benefits against the safety of a new drug and relying
more on outside reviewers financed by drug companies to ease
the agency's workload.</p>
<p>In addition, the panel said Medicare, Medicaid and private
insurers should cover the medical costs associated with the
use of investigational drugs that haven't completed the FDA
clearance process. The government and many insurers currently
don't cover such costs.</p>
<p>Because of pressure from patient groups, which support the
thrust of the report, some of the panel's recommendations
could get serious consideration. Administration officials
wouldn't say when they plan to consider the report, but the
FDA is already moving in the direction of some of the
recommendations.</p>
<p>The nub of the panel's report is that rapidly changing
medical technology demands a more flexible approach to
approving promising new drugs for desperately ill patients.
"Regulatory personnel in the FDA must adapt to these new
needs, and take a positive attitude toward such innovation,"
it said.</p>
<p>Adoption of the panel's recommendations could cut two
years from the average seven it takes to bring a new drug to
market, estimated Louis Lasagna, the panel's chairman and
dean of the Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences at
Tufts University.</p>
<p>While the FDA gradually has streamlined its procedures for
making new drugs available to patients with cancer and
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, "there's still room for
improvement," Dr. Lasagna said at a news conference. "The
agency has been more demanding on occasion than it needed to
be."</p>
<p>In addition, the report said the FDA lacks the money,
space and people it needs. The agency also lacks a leader;
Commissioner Frank Young resigned last year after the
agency's generic drug section was rocked by a bribery
scandal. No successor is in sight.</p>
<p>Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, who
must review the new report, already has set up a separate
committee to study FDA operations, and the new
recommendations could become part of that effort. However,
AIDS and cancer patients, who have become a powerful force in
spurring the accelerated availability of new therapies, are
likely to push for faster action on the panel's advice.</p>
<p>The panel questioned the FDA's conservative "safety-first"
philosophy and its traditional arm's length dealing with the
drug companies it regulates. Currently, companies test new
drugs in laboratories and on animals before seeking FDA
permission to start testing the safety of the drug on humans,
so-called Phase I trials. Phase 2 trials test the efficacy of
the drugs in larger human tests, and Phase 3 trials compare
the new drug with existing therapies.</p>
<p>"The public would benefit if more potential drug
treatments reached human study," the report said. "The cost,
complexity and paper work burdens of Phase 1 clinical studies
need to be reduced." The panel suggested that companies or
labs developing new drugs have the right to obtain a safety
review from an independent board of technical experts, rather
than the FDA.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of clinical trials, the panel said,
companies should have the option of paying the FDA "for
outside review by qualified experts who have no conflict of
interest" to recommend to the agency whether or not the drug
should be approved for use.</p>
<p>In general, the panel said drug development would be
accelerated by freer, less formal and more regular
communication between companies and the FDA. "The artificial
barriers that have been erected . . . have created a serious
threat to rapid development and approval of new drugs, and
can no longer be tolerated," the panel said.</p>
<p>This could be one of the panel's more controversial
suggestions. "Altering the relationship between industry and
the FDA isn't a good idea," warned Sidney Wolfe of
consumer-oriented Health Research Group. "The reason we have
drug safety and efficacy laws is that industry has
demonstrated beyond a shadow of a doubt that it's incapable
of any self-regulation. There should be an adversary
relationship."</p>
<p>In approaching the challenge of developing more drugs for
desperately ill patients, Dr. Lasagna said, "There is more
good than harm to come from an attitude that says the chief
job of the FDA is not to protect the public from drug
toxicity but to have benefits from drugs." In its report, the
panel noted that AIDS and cancer patients have made it clear
that they are willing to accept the higher risks inherent in
such an approach.</p>
<p>The FDA frequently focuses on whether drugs for terminally
ill people increase the length of survival, but the panel
recommended a new focus on "surrogate end-points," such as
the rate of tumor regression in cancer patients or CD4 white
blood cell counts in AIDS patients.</p>
<p>In addition, the panel recommended that the FDA do more to
expand access to promising new drugs in the early stages of
clinical trials. It also urged that the agency work more
closely with the National Cancer Institute and the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, where much AIDS
research takes place.</p>
