	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- A shareholder lawsuit alleged that Playboy
Enterprises Inc.'s recently implemented dual-class structure
is unfair to minority stockholders.
   The suit, filed in the chancery division of Cook County
state court here, claims the "true purpose" of the plan is to
"enable Hugh Hefner to retain voting control of Playboy while
disposing of up to threequarters of his Playboy holdings."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The suit charges Playboy and certain officials with breach
of fiduciary duty, among other things, and asks the court to
order a reversal of Playboy's recapitalization plan.</p>
<p>In May, Playboy announced plans to convert its common
stock into separate voting and nonvoting classes. The
publishing and entertainment concern touted the plan, which
was approved by holders, as a benign business tool under
which it could issue nonvoting shares without diluting
founder and former Chairman Hugh Hefner's 71% controlling
stake. Mr. Hefner's support meant passage of the measure was
a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>The shareholder suit says that Mr. Hefner, as a
"self-interested and majority shareholder, had the ultimate
power to determine the outcome of the shareholder vote."
Because he held that power, Playboy "had a heightened and
unflinching duty to look after the interests of the minority
shareholders when implementing the plan, which it failed to
exercise."</p>
<p>A Playboy spokeswoman said the company hadn't yet seen the
suit, but added, "We are extremely confident the court will
uphold the validity" of the recent move. The plan "provides
substantial benefits to all of the company's shareholders,"
she said, and "doesn't change Mr. Hefner's historic control
of the company."</p>
