	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, apparently
looking for military security and economic help in his
confrontation with the U.S., offered stunning concessions
toward ending his long dispute with Iran.
   His offer -- to concede disputed territory to Iran and
immediately exchange prisoners of war -- seemed to be an
effort in the short run to guarantee that Iran doesn't make
any military moves that would complicate efforts to protect
Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But in the long run, Iraq may well be hoping that Iran
will agree to open up their border to shipments of food and
other commodities, creating an enormous loophole in
international economic sanctions against Iraq. "There is very
clearly an Iraqi expectation that the Iranians won't go along
with international sanctions as part of this deal," said
Shaul Bakhash, an Iranian author and scholar. "And it poses
for Iran a very, very difficult dilemma."</p>
<p>Tehran doesn't want Iraq to emerge from the crisis as the
Persian Gulf's superpower, but also doesn't like the growing
U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf. In one sign that
Iran may be sympathetic to overtures from Iraq, Iranian
religious leader Ali Khamenei blasted the U.S. military
buildup in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as President Bush prepared for a long meeting
today with Jordan's King Hussein, a potential mediator, the
U.S. showed few signs of flexibility toward Iraq. The Bush
administration appeared headed toward activation of tens of
thousands of military reservists soon to ease strains created
by the big deployment of U.S. forces to the Persian Gulf
region.</p>
<p>And President Bush gave a tough speech in which he drew a
direct parallel between Saddam Hussein and Adolf Hitler.</p>
<p>"A half a century ago our nation and the world paid dearly
for appeasing an aggressor who should -- and could -- have
been stopped," Mr. Bush said in an appearance at the Pentagon
for briefings on the Iraq situation. "We're not about to make
the same mistake twice."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush, using rhetoric that may make it difficult for
him to ease into a negotiated settlement later, said Iraqi
soldiers who invaded Kuwait committed "atrocities" and
asserted: "Our jobs, our way of life, our own freedom and the
freedom of friendly countries around the world would all
suffer if control of the world's great oil reserves fell into
the hands of that one man, Saddam Hussein."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush plans to meet for as long as two hours today with
Jordan's King Hussein at the president's vacation home in
Maine, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. Various
Jordanian and Iraqi officials have suggested that the king is
carrying a personal message from Saddam Hussein to Mr. Bush,
but Mr. Fitzwater said the U.S. doesn't have any information
to confirm that.</p>
<p>(Late yesterday, the White House announced that Mr. Bush
would meet with Prince Saud-al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign
minister, after his meeting with King Hussein. The foreign
minister will be accompanied by Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the
Saudi ambassador to the U.S.)</p>
<p>Some Jordanian officials met with national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft to prepare for today's meeting,
although King Hussein himself kept a low profile in
Washington. And while various Iraqi and Jordanian spokesmen
have suggested that King Hussein is carrying a personal
message from Saddam Hussein to President Bush, U.S. officials
said the king has suggested he wants a more general
discussion of how the U.S. plans to pursue its campaign
against Iraq. "I have no reason to believe he's coming over
for anything but that -- a general discussion of the
situation," said a senior U.S. official.</p>
<p>President Bush is sure to emphasize his insistence that
Jordan shut down its Red Sea port of Aqaba to shipments of
goods destined for Iraq, officials said. But they also added
that Aqaba has been quiet in the past few days, suggesting
that while Jordan hasn't shut down the flow of goods, it has
been reduced. That route is one of a dwindling number of
Iraqi commercial links to the rest of the world --
particularly after reports indicated that Turkey, another
Iraqi neighbor, has stopped thousands of tons of food and
other goods from entering Iraq.</p>
<p>The worsening freeze on Iraqi commerce may have prompted
Saddam Hussein to gamble that he can win some relief from
Iran in return for concessions that could cause Iraqis to
call into question the sacrifices they made during eight
years of war with Tehran.</p>
<p>Specifically, Iraq announced that Saddam Hussein sent a
letter to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani offering to
settle the two nations' longstanding border disputes, to
withdraw Iraqi troops from the border starting tomorrow and
to exchange prisoners of war, which the Red Cross has
estimated at 50,000 Iraqis and 19,000 Iranians.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein's message essentially declared that Iran
and Iraq should settle their differences to focus on battling
the U.S. and other Western nations. He called for a "new life
of cooperation on the principles of Islam and respect of each
other's rights, so we can deter all those fishing in dirty
waters and cooperate to turn the gulf into a lake of peace,
free of foreign fleets that harbor ill intentions against
us."</p>
<p>Though it wasn't clear from the letter precisely how
Saddam Hussein was proposing to settle the border disputes,
Iraq seemed to have capitulated to longstanding Iranian
demands. The message suggested returning to a 1975 border
agreement scrapped by Iraq at the start of the Iran-Iraq war.
But it also referred to following some additional
"principles" spelled out in other, undisclosed messages. That
suggested there may be strings attached to Iraq's offer that
potentially could make it unacceptable to Iran.</p>
<p>Iraq still occupies some small pieces of Iranian territory
taken during the war. But far more important than return of
those lands is Iraq's apparent willingness to cede to Iran
partial control of the crucial Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's
only outlet to the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>A dispute over that waterway was at the heart of the
Iran-Iraq war. Under a 1975 agreement, Iran and Iraq agreed
to divide control of the waterway down its median line. But
Saddam Hussein abrogated that treaty in 1980 and asserted
full control of the Shatt, one of the actions that led to the
outbreak of war.</p>
<p>Iran immediately expressed glee over the Iraqi move,
declaring that it amounted to a victory for Iran. But Iran's
leaders also were waiting for a delegation of Iraqi diplomats
to explain details.</p>
<p>The overture toward Iran suggested that Saddam Hussein
feels vulnerable to the international forces arrayed against
him. He's in no position right now, for one thing, to worry
about a renewal of any military threat against him from Iran.</p>
<p>"He's doing the same thing Hitler did, deciding not to
fight a two-front war and protecting his flanks," said George
Carver, a former official of the Central Intelligence Agency
and the State Department. Saddam Hussein may be hoping simply
for a guarantee of peaceful relations so that he can free
thousands of troops from the border with Iran and direct them
toward Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the site of the big
international military buildup.</p>
<p>But a real military threat didn't seem likely from Iran,
which is economically and politically exhausted after its
long war with Iraq. So Saddam Hussein may be hoping for
broader political gains -- namely, Iranian help in getting
food past the international economic embargo. But Iran may
not be interested in helping an enemy out of a tight spot.
"If they go along with Saddam Hussein and help him break
sanctions, he might emerge as a very militarily powerful and
economically powerful gulf leader," says Mr. Bakhash. "My
sense is that they may not go along."</p>
<p>For their part, U.S. officials dismissed Iraq's overture
to Iran and were skeptical that Iran would be of much help to
Saddam Hussein. "It's something that's long been in the
works," said one senior U.S. analyst. "Both sides have
strategic reasons to want to calm that relationship." The
Iranians, he added, "may simply pocket this" concession from
Iraq without offering much in return.</p>
<p>In the long run, the concessions to Iran may make it even
more important to Saddam Hussein that he keep control of
Kuwait. He now has little to show for his attack on Iran, and
control of Kuwait may become increasingly important to
demonstrate that he has secured a payoff from his military
adventures.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the military pressure on Iraq doesn't
show any sign of easing. Bangladesh joined the military force
in Saudi Arabia, and the U.S. continued diplomatic
discussions with the Soviets and Western powers about forming
a United Nations naval command to conduct interdiction of
Iraqi shipping.</p>
<p>An expensive call-up of U.S. reservists grew more and more
likely, with Mr. Fitzwater noting that President Bush has the
power to call up 200,000 reservists for 180 days without
congressional action. Stressing that lawmakers always
intended heavy reliance on reservists during such a Third
World crisis, Secretary Cheney apparently thinks that a
presidential decision is necessary within the next week or so
to avoid disrupting the flow of troops and hardware to the
Middle East. "The decision simply hasn't been made yet," Mr.
Cheney told reporters this week.</p>
<p>The U.S. Customs Service, meanwhile, said two European
arms brokers were indicted for trying to buy and smuggle
10,000 TOW anti-tank weapons and 10,000 artillery shells for
shipment to Iraq, Iran and Libya. Carol Hallett, commissioner
of customs, said the shells -- ordered by the brokers from a
U.S. company -- were the type used to carry chemical weapons.
The company wasn't identified.</p>
<p>The two brokers, Claus Fuhler, 32, an opthalmologist from
Metten, West Germany, and Juan Martin Peche-Koesters, 43, a
businessman from Barcelona, Spain, were arrested in Florida
Monday. They were lured there as part of a yearlong federal
sting operation.</p>
