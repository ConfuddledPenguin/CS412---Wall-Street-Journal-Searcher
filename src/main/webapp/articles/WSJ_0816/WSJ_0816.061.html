	<p class="article-leader">LIMITED Inc. aims to be a $10 billion-a-year company with
10% after-tax profits by the mid-1990s. In some editions
yesterday, the percentage of the profit margin was misstated.
Also, Limited's same-store sales increased 5% in June and 6%
in July. In yesterday's What's News column, it was
incorrectly stated that same-store sales fell in those
months.
