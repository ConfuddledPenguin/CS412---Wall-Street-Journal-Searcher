	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Salomon Inc., one of the brokerage firms that
scored a success earlier this year with "Nikkei warrants" to
bet on the Japanese stock market, is trying to do the same
thing with the oil market.
   Salomon filed for Securities and Exchange Commission
approval for a new security that appears to be the first
equity issue, as opposed to a futures contract or option,
that allows investors to bet on the future price of oil. The
Salomon Phibro Oil Trust units would trade on the American
Stock Exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In May, Salomon tried to come out with a more complicated
version of the trust, but that offering was pulled when the
oil markets plunged. But now, with soaring oil prices caused
by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, Salomon's timing seems better
for a big sale.</p>
<p>A Salomon spokesman declined to comment, citing
regulations against public statements when an issue is
awaiting SEC approval.</p>
<p>The units, which are being underwritten by Salomon
Brothers Inc., the company's securities subsidiary, and Bear,
Stearns & Co., are designed for individual and institutional
investors. Each unit entitles the investor to a cash payment
based on the price of a quarter of a barrel of oil five years
from now.</p>
<p>But the offering isn't without big risks. At a time when
many oil experts aren't sure what oil prices will be tomorrow
or next month, the Salomon offering is geared to predicting
where oil will be in 1995. The trust will pay a single cash
distribution in November 1995, based on the price of oil at
that time.</p>
<p>If the price of oil isn't well over $20 a barrel then, the
investor won't make any money and could lose heavily if oil
prices have plunged from current levels.</p>
<p>Investors can cash out early by selling their units on the
Amex, although it's unclear yet how active trading will
become.</p>
<p>The units could have some advantages over oil futures.
Unlike oil futures contracts, with lifespans ranging from a
month to two years, the Salomon units can be bought and put
away by investors for five years. Also, if oil prices go
down, there won't be additional margin payments required as
there can be in the futures market.</p>
<p>With plans to offer 12 million units at a maximum of $5
each, Salomon could raise as much as $60 million from the
public in the offering, in which its Phibro Energy Inc. unit
will play a role and in which an oil broker for Phibro, PVM
Oil Associates Inc., will be paid as an adviser.</p>
<p>The Nikkei warrants that began trading earlier this year
were fortuitously timed. They were initially issued by
Salomon and several other U.S. securities firms as the Tokyo
stock market began falling sharply, and the value of the
warrants soared.</p>
<p>The first Nikkei warrants were designed by Goldman, Sachs
& Co. and issued by the Kingdom of Denmark on Jan. 12. Five
days later, Salomon issued its warrants, and others followed.

<p>In its registration statement for the proposed oil
offering, Salomon warns that investors "should understand the
risks of investments related to crude oil prices," which have
gyrated in recent years, from nearly $40 a barrel in the
early 1980s to as low as $11 later in the decade and back to
more than $20 last year.</p>
<p>Salomon isn't the only player coming up with new ways to
play oil prices. Bankers Trust New York Corp. is expected to
announce in London a U.S.-style warrant with a life of 18
months, which permits the holder to elect whether to bet oil
prices will rise or fall. The investor has 90 days from the
issue date to decide which way to bet. The offering isn't
likely to be available to Americans.</p>
