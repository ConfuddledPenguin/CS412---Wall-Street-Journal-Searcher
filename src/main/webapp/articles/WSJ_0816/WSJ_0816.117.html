	<p class="article-leader">Genentech Inc. and Abbott Laboratories Inc. reached an
out-of-court settlement of their two-year-old patent dispute
affecting Genentech's heart drug, tissue plasminogen
activator, or TPA.
   The settlement effectively sweeps away the last major
litigation clouding Genentech's marketing of its flagship
product, sold under the brand name Activase. In April, the
South San Francisco, Calif.-based biotechnology company
settled a similar dispute with Wellcome PLC of London.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the agreement reached with Abbott, the companies
agreed to dismiss all their respective claims. Other terms of
the agreement weren't disclosed, and a Genentech spokeswoman
declined to say whether any money changed hands in the pact.</p>
<p>In November 1987, the Food and Drug Administration
approved the marketing of Genentech's TPA as a treatment for
heart attacks. The U.S. Patent Office in 1988 and 1989
awarded Genentech patents covering TPA and its manufacture by
means of gene-splicing, or recombinant DNA technology.
Gene-splicing involves insertion of the gene for TPA or other
human proteins into micro-organisms, which then act as tiny
factories to churn out the product.</p>
<p>However, since 1978 Abbott Labs had been marketing a
natural clot-dissolving substance called urokinase, which is
extracted from urine. It also holds two patents covering a
drug it calls "plasminogen activator," which analysts at the
time speculated might refer to a gene-spliced version of
urokinase.</p>
<p>The squabble arose when Abbott claimed Genentech's TPA was
infringing its patents. The two companies tried to resolve
the matter throughout the winter of 1987-88, but talks broke
off when Genentech filed suit in March 1988 in federal court
in San Francisco. Genentech asked the court to declare the
Abbott patents invalid, and to rule that Genentech hadn't
infringed upon them.</p>
<p>Abbott countersued, charging Genentech with infringement
on its patents.</p>
<p>Ironically, the most formidable competition to Genentech's
TPA has come from neither Wellcome nor Abbott, but from an
older clot-dissolving drug, streptokinase, made by Hoechst
AG. Streptokinase, which sells for about $200 a dose, has
been shown in recent European studies to be about as
effective as TPA, which costs more than 10 times as much.</p>
<p>Genentech has waged an intensive marketing campaign to
discredit that study, arguing that the study failed to
observe the current standard U.S. medical practice of
administering TPA in conjunction with the blood-thinning
agent heparin.</p>
<p>TPA, while a strong revenue source for Genentech, never
realized the company's original dream of a billion dollar
product. In the second quarter ended June 30, TPA sales
totaled $48.3 million, about flat with the year-earlier
period, but down from 1990 first quarter sales of $54.9
million.</p>
