	<p class="article-leader">Boston -- The teenage girls knew exactly who he was. Then
again, it would be hard to mistake him for anyone else. In
his ersatz military dress uniform, resplendent with gold
braid, ribbons and medals, burly bodyguard doing a Mr. T
imitation at his side, there is only one Maurice Starr, the
man they call the General.
   So it was hardly a surprise when, every time the
middle-aged man sallied out from backstage at the Strand
Theater here to gain an audience-eye view of the action, the
girls would approach. They were asking for autographs -- not
a performer's but his.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To everybody who still adds "teen" to the end of his or
her age, Mr. Starr is a star. He's the man who gave the world
New Kids on the Block, the five Boston rockers who currently
reign as princes of pop.</p>
<p>And Mr. Starr definitely is the power behind the throne.
He's done everything from recruiting the band members to
writing most of their songs, doing backup vocals and
instrumentals on their recordings, and producing and
co-managing them. Their success has been very much his, too.
He laughingly admits to having earned more than $1 million
last year. In one recent week alone, he says, he received
checks totaling $6 million for Kids biz ranging from
management commissions to royalties. Such pay days recently
enabled him to purchase a stately, 12-bedroom, Georgian-style
brick home in affluent suburban Brookline for $1.5 million,
$576,000 of it in cash. Or was that for one of the other five
homes he's bought for family and friends? He can't remember.</p>
<p>Careers have been capped with less, but this night at the
Strand Maurice Starr was at work on his encore. In between
the hopeful competitors in the talent show he was hosting --
top prize a recording contract with CBS and $1,500 -- were
five "guest acts" from Mr. Starr's stable of newcomers. All
told, Mr. Starr has eight new acts under his tutelage.</p>
<p>Like New Kids, most were created by him. Mr. Starr is
their producer, manager or co-manager, and chief songwriter.
It is typically Mr. Starr or his handpicked coaches who teach
the youngsters to sing, play and dance -- often while the
group is recording an album.</p>
<p>All that, plus some of his groups' penchant for
lip-synching in concert, provides fodder for detractors who
deride Mr. Starr as a puppeteer orchestrating wooden
marionettes. The General defends his involvement as
"teamwork." And judging from their howls of puppy love, the
paying customers here tonight certainly don't object.</p>
<p>Mr. Starr points out that he's hardly the first to employ
this tutorial approach. Motown Records, for one, made great
successes out of acts that had been groomed -- including the
Supremes -- and Mr. Starr says he'd love nothing better than
to surpass the hit-parade count achieved by Berry Gordy and
Kenny Gamble, two gurus of that golden age.</p>
<p>The real distinction, Mr. Starr says, is his crossing
rock's color barrier. "No other black manager has managed . .
. acts that are white, the top acts in the world," says Mr.
Starr. "This will give other black promoters a chance."</p>
<p>Not so long ago, success of any sort seemed unlikely for
36-year-old Mr. Starr. Born Larry Johnson, he grew up in a
musical family in a Florida hamlet. In 1972, he and four of
his five brothers boarded a bus for Boston, where an uncle
had offered to manage them. The band struggled for
recognition, and broke up in 1976. Johnson, who by then could
play a bandful of instruments, emerged with little more than
a new name; he had changed his first to Maurice on the eve of
a trip to France and his last to Starr to reflect his lofty
goals. His subsequent solo career failed to take him out of
seedy nightclubs where, he recalls, "people were shootin'
bullets through the walls."</p>
<p>His break came in 1981 when he met four black youngsters
from a Boston housing project who called themselves New
Edition. He became their producer, songwriter and main backup
musician. They became stars. The youngest member, Bobby
Brown, has since spun off a successful career of his own
(without Mr. Starr), finishing behind only New Kids on
Billboard's 1989 ranking of top pop artists.</p>
<p>By 1983, though, New Edition had dismissed Mr. Starr in a
squabble over money. Mr. Starr had to start over, but
determined to do so with one big difference: The next band
would be white.</p>
<p>"There are more than 100 million white people in this
country and more than 30 million blacks," he says. "That's a
big difference in potential audiences, and each will support
its own." Mr. Starr hit the jackpot with New Kids, whom he
taught to perform in a black teen style.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Starr's strategy of total control has not
always worked. "Irving & the Twins never made it," he sighs,
recalling a group he produced in the early '80s. "One twin
gained weight and didn't look like a twin. Irving grew three
feet."</p>
<p>With his latest groups, Mr. Starr is sticking with the
familiar. Whether it's New Generation, a Hawaiian version of
New Kids, or Heart, Body & Soul, a female quintet that even
Mr. Starr characterizes as "sugar-coated," all of his new
acts sport a teen-oriented funk sound.</p>
<p>"I find all my performers on the street," says Mr. Starr,
who insists that the crucial ingredient he looks for is not
musical talent, but "the look." "I'm an image person," he
explains. "So if I don't see it, I lose my enthusiasm." He
saw it in each member of Heart, Body & Soul, which he
assembled last year. "I was looking for five beautiful girls,
in nice colors," Mr. Starr says. Typical was Lucy Gonzalves,
of Cape Verdean descent, spotted while modeling in a fashion
show at a Boston jazz club.</p>
<p>And Mr. Starr most certainly saw it in Craig Gendreau, a
lithe 17-year-old former model. Mr. Starr first noticed him a
year ago at a talent show in New Hampshire, where the
high-school sophomore from the old Massachusetts mill city of
Fall River was a spectator. No question, Gendreau is Mr.
Starr's personal favorite, the prospect he has unabashedly
touted as "the next Elvis."</p>
<p>"I saw it from his lips to his eyes to his face to that
small body the girls like," says Mr. Starr. Mr. Starr has
given Gendreau the stage name Rick Wes, and for months has
been teaching the heartthrob-in-training how to sing and play
guitar and, perhaps most important of all, move on stage.</p>
<p>"He makes those moves toward the girls with his acoustic
guitar; it kills them]" says Mr. Starr, shouting to be heard
over the amplified music and frenzied crowd at the Strand.</p>
<p>Mr. Starr pauses to watch his apprentice careen across the
stage, planting his feet for a few slow hip grinds before
letting go with two power pumps. The audience rewards the
doe-eyed kid in the baggy dark suit with whoops and screams.</p>
<p>"Just look at this," Mr. Starr beams with something akin
to parental pride. "This boy is gonna be a big star. Real
big]"</p>
<p>And why not? The kids eat up Wes's cotton-candy lyrics.
Their shrieks most certainly are not in protest against his
lip-synching and fake guitar-strumming. If it does happen,
the suspicion lingers that Mr. Starr already will be grooming
yet other green talent in his stable.</p>
<p>For other than this, the man they call the General would
be lacking in purpose, for the money and the success are only
half of it. To see this paunchy middle-aged man in the
studio, sporting a rhinestone-studded denim jacket and
lovingly crooning into a microphone, adding background yelps
and moans to an album by Homework, is to see Larry Johnson,
rock 'n' roller.</p>
<p>Over and again he works each track, quietly coaching
himself between takes. "Dreamier," he says one time. "Gotta
open your mouth more," he suggests next. Then, clenching a
fist, "Make it young, get that young sound]"</p>
<p>Finally, he plays back a version that satisfies him. He
can't help celebrate with a triumphant whoop: "I been waitin'
for this moment in my life so long, man]"</p>
