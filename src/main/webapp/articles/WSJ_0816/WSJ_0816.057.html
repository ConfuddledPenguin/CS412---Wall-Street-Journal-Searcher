	<p class="article-leader">BERLIN -- West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, increasingly
at ease with his nation's new political clout, is willing to
send German ships to a trouble zone for the first time since
World War II to help settle the Mideast crisis, a senior
government official said.
   Mr. Kohl privately told Italian leader Giulio Andreotti by
telephone that he would be willing to send five West German
minesweepers to the Persian Gulf, but only as part of an
international fleet that would be approved at next Tuesday's
meeting of the West European Union.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Bonn government has already dispatched the ships to
the eastern Mediterranean, replacing North Atlantic Treaty
Organization ships sent to the gulf in response to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>But Mr. Kohl's apparent willingness to go even further
underlines Germany's readiness to play a more active world
role, a readiness that is likely to increase after East and
West Germany's scheduled unification late this year.</p>
<p>"We are the largest country in Western Europe, and we
believe we have to join the common solidarity of the Western
world" regarding Iraq, says Horst Teltschik, Mr. Kohl's
national security adviser.</p>
<p>Mr. Teltschik wouldn't comment on what he called the
"theoretical possibilities" of sending the minesweepers into
the gulf, an act that would be expected to encounter
political opposition as well as constitutional impediments to
the use of German troops outside the territory of NATO. But
he said, "We have to prove the possibilities of what we can
do more than ever before because of the expectations of the
international community."</p>
<p>A year ago, Bonn would have faced a storm of internal
opposition for actions it has already taken: allowing the
U.S. to deploy forces to the gulf from German bases,
deploying its own ships and joining the sanctions imposed on
Iraq after its Aug. 2 invasion. But sending forces to a
potential war zone is a far more sensitive matter in Germany,
and Mr. Kohl might not be able to pull it off.</p>
<p>His own foreign minister, Hans Dietrich Genscher, says he
believes the country's constitution forbids it. The
opposition Social Democratic Party's contingent in the
Bundestag is likely next week to oppose any such deployment
but at the same time suggest a change in the constitution
that would allow German troops to be used outside NATO's
territory as part of a United Nations contingent.</p>
<p>No matter what becomes of the minesweepers, however, the
decision marks the growing pains of a new political power.
The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe turn to West Germany
first for economic assistance, the U.S. leans on it to rally
European support for Washington's actions, and Germany itself
is increasingly unmatched in political and economic power in
Europe.</p>
<p>Most of all, Germany's attitude has changed. After years
of being psychologically and politically handicapped by its
militaristic past and the resulting postwar division of the
nation, it has become more willing to stand up for its
national goals.</p>
<p>"Germany is going to be a more prickly country when she
defends her interests," says Thomas Kielinger, editor of the
West German weekly Rheinischer Merkur. "We will be less meek,
less like a lamb, more assertive -- not domineering, but in a
natural sense."</p>
<p>But where Germany's increased influence can be best
measured isn't in the gulf but in Eastern Europe, where its
formerly Communist neighbors are all seeking help. Here, Bonn
is held back only by its unfamiliarity with its new role and
by fiscal limitations imposed by the cost of absorbing East
Germany.</p>
<p>"The role that Germany is playing in the world has a new
quality," Mr. Teltschik says. "The problem is that most
Germans haven't recognized it yet. We must take more
responsibility ourselves. The world expects more of us.
However, we are of the opinion that the expectations are too
great. World-wide, people expect we can finance everything.
We just don't have the economic and financial resources to
meet those expectations."</p>
<p>That said, Germany has seldom been so well positioned
economically. In the first quarter alone, it was able to
expand its exports by 18% to nearly $100 billion and surpass
the U.S. as the world's largest exporter. After unification,
which will ultimately expand the country's potential by 25%,
experts say the country could hold onto that position for
years. West Germany's trade surplus in the first quarter was
nearly double that of Japan's at $22 billion.</p>
<p>Some officials say Mr. Kohl is using his minesweepers less
to flex muscle and more to pay a debt to President Bush for
his support of German unification. "There isn't a political
debt, but a moral and political obligation," Mr. Teltschik
says. "The Americans have shown strong solidarity for the
Germans not just during the last year, but over the last 40
years. Now we can't say it doesn't matter."</p>
