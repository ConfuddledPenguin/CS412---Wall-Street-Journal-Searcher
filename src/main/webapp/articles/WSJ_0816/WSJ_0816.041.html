	<p class="article-leader">My thanks to Jack Flam for speaking the embarrassing truth
about art as we approach the turn of this century and as I
unrelentingly struggle to experience whatever it is displayed
in galleries across the nation ("Mixed-Up-Media: The Same New
Thing," Leisure & Arts, July 25). To my dismay, I see this
trend taken to the Biennale and I continue to find myself at
the mercy of those with the power to honor and display what I
consider mediocrities.
   It seems that even the "shocking" pieces, monotonic in
their effect, fail in their alleged purpose as they move ever
closer to the saturated categories of violence and
pornography.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Are art experts playing the part of a Hans Christian
Anderson character, convincing themselves that these are
works of substance? And am I to feel the guilt of an honest
commoner as I am instructed to revise my understanding of
what art is?</p>
<p>Perhaps the Biennale should return to the noncompetitive
symposium it was in 1972. Only then might we be spared a
"mindless repetition" of Biennale 1990 in the years to come.</p>
