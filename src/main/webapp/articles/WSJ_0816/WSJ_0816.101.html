	<p class="article-leader">Medical researchers challenged the validity of a commonly
used skin test administered by doctors to diagnose and treat
food allergies.
   The test, known as provocation-neutralization, is most
often used by doctors known as clinical ecologists. They
believe a wide variety of ailments result from exposure to
food and chemicals in the environment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The challenge to the test, published in a study in today's
New England Journal of Medicine, is a setback to clinical
ecologists and underscores their differences with traditional
allergy doctors, who use a similar test in treating patients,
but who generally eschew provocation-neutralization.</p>
<p>The study, combined with previous research, "raises a very
severe question," says Don L. Jewett, professor of orthopedic
surgery at the University of California, San Francisco, and
principal author of the report. "Is this treatment doing
anything?"</p>
<p>Two years ago, federal health regulators withdrew coverage
of the test for Medicare patients, saying available evidence
didn't indicate the test and associated treatment were
effective.</p>
<p>Proponents of the test say the coverage decision is under
challenge. Aubrey Worrell, president of the American Academy
of Environmental Medicine, said several other studies vouch
for its value. He said he continues to use the test on
selected patients and finds it effective.</p>
<p>Under the technique, doctors inject patients with an
allergen extract. If symptoms are provoked, they administer
additional doses until they find a level that relieves or
neutralizes symptoms. The neutralized dose level serves as a
basis for treatment.</p>
<p>But Dr. Jewett and his colleagues determined that patients
undergoing the tests couldn't tell the difference between
active allergens and a dummy or placebo solution used as a
control. Indeed patients were just as likely to report a
reaction to an injection whether it was active or inert.</p>
<p>The researchers based their conclusions on 20 tests of 18
different patients in seven doctors' offices. The doctors
were proponents of the sensitivity tests and well-versed in
their use, the researchers reported. Only patients who
previously reacted to such tests were studied.</p>
<p>Each person was injected 12 times during the test, three
times with an active allergen extract and nine times with an
inert, control solution. The doctors, patients and
technicians administering the tests didn't know which
syringes contained active solutions.</p>
<p>Ten minutes after each injection, patients were asked to
decide whether the substance was active or inert. Substances
tested included chocolate, milk, yeast, and chicken.</p>
<p>The researchers said the patients accurately picked 16 of
60, or 27%, of active injections and judged 44 of 180, or 24%
of the inert injections to be positive. "The symptoms that
were provoked were generally unrelated to the contents of the
syringes," the researchers added. In addition, neutralizing
doses, when applied, were equally effective in treating
symptoms "provoked" by both active and inert solutions.</p>
