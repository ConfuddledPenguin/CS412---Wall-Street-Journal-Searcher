	<p class="article-leader">An insurance group within ITT Corp. edged back from a
confrontation with the state of New Jersey by agreeing to
continue writing auto insurance policies in the state if
necessary to keep the rest of its business there.
   ITT Hartford Insurance Group, which has said its total
premium volume in New Jersey last year was $224.6 million,
was responding to an order by the state insurance
commissioner, Samuel Fortunato, who ordered all ITT Hartford
units to surrender their certificates to sell insurance if
one of those units, Twin City Fire Insurance Co., withdrew
from the state's auto insurance market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Twin City, the only ITT Hartford unit selling auto
insurance in New Jersey, has protested that it would suffer
"severe losses" under the state's new auto-insurance law. The
unit had premium volume of $72.6 million last year, though
that figure includes premiums on homeowner lines as well as
auto coverage.</p>
<p>The state says Twin City insures about 1% of New Jersey
drivers.</p>
<p>ITT Hartford said it "will continue to operate within the
letter and spirit of the law." But the company signaled its
dispute with the state isn't over, saying it will seek
"administrative and legal remedies" to Mr. Fortunato's order.
The company has already been in litigation with the state
over the law.</p>
<p>The insurance commissioner was acting under what state
officials call a "long arm" provision in the law meant to
strengthen the state's position in dealing with insurers who
want to pull out of the auto insurance market.</p>
