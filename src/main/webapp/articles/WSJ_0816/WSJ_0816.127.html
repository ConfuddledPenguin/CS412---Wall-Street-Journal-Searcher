	<p class="article-leader">Union Valley Corp., citing reduced demand for new homes in
the New Jersey market, said it incurred a net loss of $2.9
million in the second quarter.
   That compares with year-ago net income of $536,000, or 11
cents a share. Revenue fell 53% to $12.2 million from $26
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a related matter, Howell, N.J.-based Union Valley, said
it may dispose of certain assets outside its main real estate
business under terms negotiated with First Fidelity Bank,
Newark, N.J., to pay back debt. First Fidelity asked for the
repayment of $84.1 million in debt due Aug. 1.</p>
<p>The commercial and residential builder said losses from
disposed assets may be added to its reserves for possible
losses on certain real estate assets.</p>
<p>In addition to possible disposition of assets, the company
said it is in talks with the bank to refinance the debt and
to obtain long-term funding for its core home building
business.</p>
<p>Sales backlog in the first half was $29.2 million, or 233
units, compared to $47.7 million, or 314 units, a year ago,
the company said. The backlog includes non-binding
reservations.</p>
