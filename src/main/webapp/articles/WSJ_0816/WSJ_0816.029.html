	<p class="article-leader">For foreign forces arriving in Saudi Arabia, the learning
curve is proving steep indeed. The first British crews
arriving from their base in Cyprus were astonished to hear
that their usual summer uniform -- shorts -- was banned in
Saudi Arabia under Islam's strict code of modesty, which
prohibits men from showing their knees.
   Multinational military missions are always fraught with
difficulties, but the delicate synthesis now under way in
Saudi Arabia is likely to prove more troublesome than most.
The U.S. troops now pouring into the Dhahran air base will be
working at a facility with the best infrastructure money can
buy -- and with an almost totally untested air force.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>They also are entering a Moslem society so closed and
conservative that the government never has issued tourist
visas, women are veiled, alien religious symbols such as
crucifixes are banned, and Jews are rarely admitted. Many
Saudis are appalled by the idea that U.S. forces almost
certainly contain some Jews, and the presence of U.S.
servicewomen working on aircraft violates every Saudi custom.
Misunderstanding can be total. "They blame us," says a male
military specialist. "They can't understand why we make our
women do such things."</p>
<p>Dhahran's underground command facilities and elaborate
shelters are better equipped than NATO's. The shelters, their
entrances shielded and camouflaged, can service four aircraft
at a time and house crews for 30 days without resupply.
Dhahran is "a base the U.S. would love to have," says one
military expert.</p>
<p>But opinion is divided on the quality of Saudi troops.
"The best help they could provide to the U.S. forces would be
to stay in their barracks," says one U.S. colonel who served
in Saudi Arabia. Others are more measured. "It's a spectrum,"
says a former key U.S. official in Dhahran. "If I had to go
into battle and I could pick {the pilots flying with me}, I
wouldn't mind at all."</p>
<p>A former White House security adviser says, "It's hard to
say how the Saudi air force will perform, because it's only
been tested once." In 1984, Saudi F-15s downed Iranian F-4s
that had penetrated Saudi air space. However, U.S. E-3A
aircraft helped target the Iranians and U.S. tankers refueled
the Saudi planes.</p>
<p>The Saudi air force hasn't been around long enough to
prove itself. Attempts to establish an air defense actually
began in 1930 but faltered until 1980, when a nervous Saudi
royal family, eyeing the fall of the shah in Iran, called on
the U.S. to help.</p>
<p>The Pentagon rushed in, challenged by the task of
providing a defense for Saudi Arabia's vulnerable oil fields.
In the flat, featureless desert, targets stand out as if
marked with bull's-eyes. A single strike on a major facility
such as the water-injection plant that pushes out the oil
could cripple production for as long as two years. In such
terrain, nature is merciless. In summer, thermal air currents
can blind radar, and sandstorms strafe delicate equipment.</p>
<p>The U.S. military came up with an exhaustive -- and
expensive -- plan, only part of which has been realized.
Opposition led by backers of Israel blocked several planned
sales of arms to the Saudis. Equipment that was delivered
often was modified to placate fears that Israel's security
would be compromised.</p>
<p>For example, Saudi planes weren't supplied with the
secure, jam-proof communications systems the U.S. Air Force
uses, which are invaluable in a dense air battle. Without
such units, Saudi pilots fighting an engagement alongside
Americans won't be able to communicate fluidly.
Theoretically, the inferior Saudi system can be swapped for a
U.S. kit in about four hours. The Pentagon won't comment on
whether this has yet been done.</p>
<p>In arguing for the Saudi arms deals, the Pentagon always
maintained that the close military ties forged by such sales
would be of vast benefit to the U.S. in a crisis such as the
one that sprang up when Iraqi forces invaded and took over
neighboring Kuwait two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Major arms sales certainly created contact. After Saudi
Arabia purchased sophisticated airborne radar planes known as
Awacs, around 1,000 U.S. technicians, trainers and advisers
headed for the desert. Their influence created an air force
patterned on its U.S. counterpart both in organization and in
tactical doctrine. Young Saudis went to Phoenix, Ariz., for
training and returned wearing U.S.-style nicknames on their
flight suits.</p>
<p>"Saudi pilots act a lot like U.S. Air Force pilots," says
a Pentagon official. "That's what happens when you have
ongoing relations with another force."</p>
<p>But a lot of misunderstandings happen, too. Being a
fighter pilot is a prestigious position for young Saudis.
Many royals, such as the Saudi ambassador to the U.S., Prince
Bandar, wind up in flight school, and such young men aren't
used to brusque military discipline.</p>
<p>"You can't say `You dummy, you did it wrong,' and you
certainly learn not to chew a guy out in front of his peers,"
says a former U.S. trainer. "I think the British" -- who also
supply aircraft and training to Saudi Arabia -- "are better
than us at making these kinds of cultural adjustments."</p>
<p>But Don Kerr, a Briton who worked for seven years as an
instructor at a Saudi air academy, recalls that he too had to
make adjustments: "A student would disapper for several
months and then turn up, explaining that his father had died
and, as eldest son, he had an irrevocable duty to go home and
take control of the situation."</p>
<p>He recalls classes containing both princes and humble
Bedouin tribesmen. In many ways, the Saudi pilot selection
system is more egalitarian than the West's; recruits are
selected straight from high school, without the requirement
of a college education. Most start with intensive
English-language instruction. Fluency is essential because
all technical manuals are printed in English and
international aviation works in that language.</p>
<p>"Arabic has few technical terms," a U.S. aircraft engineer
working in Saudi Arabia says. "If you try to talk about an
engine component, you're left with saying the equivalent of
`the machine inside the machine.'"</p>
<p>The engineer, whose job includes training, says many Saudi
youths don't have the kind of mechanical background that many
U.S. boys pick up almost casually. "In the States, if you're
a kid trying to change the wheel on your bike and you're
holding the wrench wrong, your dad'll reach over and put your
fingers into the right grip. These boys' dads never had a
bike, so they come to me starting right from scratch."</p>
<p>Given those constraints, Saudis' achievements are
remarkable. Pilots now fly some of the most sophisticated and
difficult fighter planes in the world. One Saudi astronaut
flew a mission with the U.S. space shuttle.</p>
<p>But the next few weeks could provide an acid test of Saudi
proficiency and U.S. training. They also will surely provide
a test of U.S. military diplomacy. As one young U.S.
helicopter pilot put it, "The people in this part of the
world can be awfully easy to offend."</p>
