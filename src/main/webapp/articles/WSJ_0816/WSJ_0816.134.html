	<p class="article-leader">Charter Medical Corp. reported a big drop in third-quarter
earnings.
   For the quarter ended June 30, Charter posted a net loss
of $40.6 million on revenue of $315.2 million, compared with
a net loss of $5.1 million on revenue of $308 million for the
year-earlier period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Macon, Ga.-based hospital chain also said it made a
scheduled $39 million interest payment on its 14.25% and 14%
subordinated debentures. "We're current with all our debt and
expect to remain so," said J. Rodney Laughlin, Charter's
executive vice president for human resources and development.</p>
<p>He said the company has been working since June to improve
cash flow by cutting costs, mainly through reducing
personnel. In addition, he said, Charter will receive $42
million from the sale and leaseback of 12 hospitals to Health
Care Property Investors Inc. of Los Angeles.</p>
