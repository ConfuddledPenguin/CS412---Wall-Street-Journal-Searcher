	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Fewer students who earned a master of business
administration degree this year found their way to Wall
Street, according to a new survey.
   The nation's top 14 investment banks hired 221 graduating
MBAs this year, an 8% decrease from the 240 MBAs hired during
1989, according to the study by the Whitney Group, a New
York-based executive search firm that specializes in
financial services. This year's figure is nearly 50% below
hiring levels in 1987, before the October market crash, the
survey said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Of the investment banking firms polled, eight said they
hired fewer MBAs than last year, including Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., Salomon Brothers Inc., Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc. and Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. Two of the
companies surveyed said they were hiring the same number as
last year.</p>
<p>Not all the firms queried said they were pulling back,
though. Four companies, including Kidder, Peabody & Co. and
Dillon, Read & Co., said they had hired more MBAs than last
year.</p>
<p>"Caution remains the trend, with most investment banking
firms moderately bearish on the number of deals they
foresee," said Gary Goldstein, managing director of the
Whitney Group.</p>
