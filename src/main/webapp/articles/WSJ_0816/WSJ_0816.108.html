	<p class="article-leader">AMC Entertainment Inc., Kansas City, Mo., said an
agreement under which TPI Enterprises Inc. was to purchase 34
AMC theaters was amended, largely cancelling the planned
purchases.
   TPI, under a 1988 pact, has already purchased the
interests in 56 theaters from AMC for about $128 million.
That agreement called for TPI to acquire another 34 AMC movie
houses, but those provisions have been terminated. Closure of
the now-cancelled sale was originally set for February, but
it had been pushed back a number of times.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>AMC, which holds an about 28% stake in TPI Enterprises,
said TPI told the company it had decided to focus on its
existing theater markets.</p>
<p>Had the deal been consummated as originally envisioned,
said an AMC official, the full 90-theater sale would have
been "on the order of $200 million." Under the new terms, TPI
retains the option to purchase five of the theaters.</p>
