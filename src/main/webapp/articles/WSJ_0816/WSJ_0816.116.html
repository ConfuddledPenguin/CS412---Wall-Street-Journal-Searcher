	<p class="article-leader">Carolco Pictures Inc.'s second-quarter net income soared
to $8.8 million, or 28 cents a share, from $2.6 million, or
nine cents a share, a year earlier, on the strength of the
box office hit "Total Recall."
   Revenue of the Los Angeles entertainment company more than
doubled to $81 million from $34.2 million, largely because of
"Total Recall," which has grossed $114 million so far.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We expect additional contributions from `Total Recall'
during the remainder of 1990 from both the domestic
theatrical marketplace and the home video release by Live
Home Video in December," said Peter Hoffman, president and
chief executive officer. The film's release in overseas
markets continues through the end of the year, and he said
foreign results are expected "to exceed the domestic
results."</p>
<p>Carolco's revenue from feature films rose to $67.9 million
from $27.9 million in the quarter, while television
syndication revenue rose to $10 million from $5.1 million.
Carolco recognized $1.1 million as its share of earnings from
Live Entertainment Inc., of which it holds a 54% stake, as
compared with $840,000 a year earlier.</p>
<p>For the six months, Carolco's net rose to $6 million, or
20 cents a share, from $812,000, or three cents a share,
while revenue increased 91% to $100.2 million from $52.5
million.</p>
