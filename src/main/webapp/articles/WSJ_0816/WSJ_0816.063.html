	<p class="article-leader">Anthony Sampson has a knack for writing about subjects as
they careen into the public consciousness. His classic on the
oil industry, "The Seven Sisters," appeared just as OPEC was
starting to shake the world. He turned to international banks
as Latin America went bust.
   What interests Mr. Sampson this time is money -- mainly,
who is making and spending very great amounts of money.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rich, of course, are good copy, but in "The Midas
Touch: Understanding the New Global Money Societies Around
Us" (Dutton, 256 pages, $19.95), Mr. Sampson aims higher than
the gossip columnists. His premise is that money is moving
around the globe in ways and at speeds heretofore unseen, and
with consequences that should alarm us. It has become the new
faith, he writes, displacing God, blurring national culture:</p>
<p>"If an ancestor were brought back to life in the twentieth
century he would surely assume that the world was under the
sway of a powerful new religion. He would see . . . hundreds
of acolytes sitting silently in front of flickering screens,
watching mystical patterns of digits taking shape and
pressing keys as if reciting ritual responses or telling
beads."</p>
<p>As money has become transferrable at the stroke of a
computer key, Mr. Sampson argues, it has become detached from
"ordinary goods and trade." Money -- rather than industry or
natural resources -- has become the chief tool for making
more money. It would be hard to name an era in which money
was unimportant, but Mr. Sampson argues that financial values
have, as never before, eclipsed other ones. Most ominously,
the short horizons of financial markets have diverted the
attention of corporate planners from problems, such as the
environment, which require longer investments.</p>
<p>Though his targets are familiar ones, what is interesting,
for a while, is how Mr. Sampson takes aim. The author, a
Londoner, trots around the globe to see how various societies
relate to money. In America, he finds that the rich, having
earned the privilege of leisure, rise at dawn, heady with the
prospect of work. He diagnoses Japan as insecure, but he is
fooled like everyone else into believing that the Japanese
government can "intervene more decisively" to prevent its
stock market from crashing.</p>
<p>Along the way, Mr. Sampson interviews a score of marquee
names, with mixed results. He is there when Donald Trump's
telephone rings and the great one "barks out curt replies and
instructions to someone who turns out to be his wife." He
lunches with the late Malcolm Forbes as the latter's yacht
sails through Shanghai harbor with cheerful Chinese
functionaries who gawk at his bedrooms -- not long before the
events of Tiananmen Square. And Thomas Hoving, the former
director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, reveals that the
secret of raising millions (for the Met anyhow) is to "appeal
to the inherent inferiority complex of the person."</p>
<p>Mr. Sampson also bashes art buyers, and consumers in
general, as slaves to Midas. Designer-label fashions are a
proxy for stitching a dollar bill to one's sleeve. Paint
something you love, a gallery owner said to a young Andy
Warhol. "Paint money." So he did.</p>
<p>At times, Mr. Sampson seems to confuse the communications
revolution, which is new, with people's instinct for profit,
which surely is not. He writes of "electronic funds that race
across the world" as if people weren't, in fact, causing the
money to race. The tone recalls the sci-fi horror films in
which machines run wild; only here the dollar is invested
with anthropomorphic powers. Citicorp's John Reed sees in the
creation of global foreign exchange markets, which handle
$400 billion a day, a likeness to "the physicist who created
the atomic bomb." But in his day, Charles Dickens viewed with
suspicion the spread of paper money -- "that mysterious paper
currency which circulates in London when the wind blows." The
winds are now electronic, but what of it?</p>
<p>Mr. Sampson's most arresting idea is that the mobility of
money is changing ordinary lives, but this, like much else,
is broadly brushed but not explored. And some of his
assumptions simply are wrong. The stock market crash of 1987
did not "expose the weakness of the American economy" -- only
the inefficiency of markets.</p>
<p>More troubling than the occasional slip is Mr. Sampson's
blurring of substance and form. Of the brand names on sale in
airports and hotels, he writes: "a parade of honored names .
. . they offer jewelry, accessories, electronics, clothes,
luggage, the instruments of both status and escape, as if all
the rich had become refugees." Mr. Sampson writes well enough
to almost pull it off, but in such passages there is less
than meets the eye.</p>
<p>At bottom, he is uncomfortable with the stuff itself --
money. Like Marx, he abhors "naked self-interest"; unlike
him, he proposes no real alternative.</p>
<p>Mr. Sampson is at his best examining societies, such as
Ghana, outside the sweep of modern financial markets. He
concludes that communist ideology doesn't fully explain why
China is so much poorer than Chinese communities overseas.
Rather, he lays much of the blame on cultural factors, such
as the mainland's historical disdain for merchants. "There
was the difference between a people at home -- with all the
constraints of their society, their families, and the weight
of the past -- and in exile."</p>
