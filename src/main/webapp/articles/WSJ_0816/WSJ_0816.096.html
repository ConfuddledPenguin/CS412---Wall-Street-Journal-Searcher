	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Fallout from the downgrading earlier this week
of two of the largest Japanese banks' long-term debt ratings
spread to the municipal debt market. Moody's Investors
Service Inc. downgraded $13.3 billion in the debt of many
U.S. municipalities backed by the Japanese banks' credit.
   The municipal debt downgradings were touched off by
Moody's downgradings earlier this week of long-term debt
ratings for Fuji Bank Ltd. and Dai-Ich Kangyo Bank Ltd. to
double-A-1 from triple-A. The reduction of long-term debt
ratings in turn triggered a similar reduction in the
letter-of-credit ratings at the two banks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Typically, American cities and towns that have poor credit
ratings find it worthwhile to pay a fee to better-rated banks
to back their debt with the banks' own name. The banks do so
by issuing letters of credit.</p>
<p>Moody's action yesterday affects only the debt backed by
the two Japanese banks and does not necessarily affect the
overall credit rating of the municipalities. However, the
downgrading of these two Japanese banks and several others
earlier reduces the number of triple-A rated institutions
available to back debt issued by American cities. As a
result, those cities may have to pay higher rates when they
borrow in future.</p>
<p>Dai-Ichi is the world's largest bank by asset size; Fuji
is the fourth largest.</p>
<p>Laura Levenstein, assistant vice president at Moody's,
said the letter of credit and subsequent municipal debt moves
were the logical outcome of the long-term debt changes.</p>
<p>"The letter of credit ratings rank equally with the
long-term debt ratings, so when long-term ratings come down
so do the letter of credit ratings," she said.</p>
<p>Moody's said earlier that it downgraded Dai-Ichi Kangyo's
long-term debt rating because of its relatively high
real-estate exposure in Japan, rising interest rates and high
overhead ratio. The credit-rating service reduced Fuji's debt
ratings because of its lower core profitability and higher
risk profile compared with its peer banks.</p>
<p>Japanese banks have been among the most aggressive issuers
of letters of credit and other guarantees in the U.S. in
recent years. To a large extent they capitalized on their
superior credit ratings to provide letters of credit at
prices that undercut U.S. banks, most of which aren't
top-rated credit risks.</p>
