	<p class="article-leader">Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it formed a new unit
to track U.S. companies that issue junk bonds, in response to
heightened investor concerns about the increasingly risky
business climate.
   The new speculative-grade unit, within this rating
service's industrial-company group, includes six analysts who
will monitor debt securities rated Ba-1 and lower.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>M. Douglas Watson Jr., director of industrial ratings at
Moody's, said the new team of analysts will focus on the
ability of speculative-grade securities issuers to "generate
cash and to tap external sources of liquidity."</p>
