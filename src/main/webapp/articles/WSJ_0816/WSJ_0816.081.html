	<p class="article-leader">The root cause of the S&L mess is the deposit insurance
system itself. While permitting private institutions to use
the federal government's credit without limit, it relies on
government supervision and regulation to correct for the fact
that depositors have no incentive to control how their funds
are used. Last week, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
Chairman William Seidman announced that his agency, which
insures bank deposits, may lose an additional $2 billion this
year. There is, unfortunately, reason to believe that this is
not the last FDIC loss we will see. Nor are the banks
themselves the beneficiaries of this flawed system. This week
the FDIC announced that it would raise premiums by 63% -- an
enormous charge to bank earnings. More increases are in
prospect.
   As shown by the S&L debacle, the deposit insurance system
tends to make disasters out of difficulties. In the real
economy there is a clearly understood relationship between
risk and reward, and for every category of investment --
commercial loans, home mortgages, junk bonds -- there is a
spectrum of return in which the riskiest investments are
perceived to produce the greatest rewards. Although
regulators can make rules limiting the kinds of loans
federally insured institutions can make, and supervisors can
inspect bank portfolios to assure that these rules are
observed, a loan committee or a board of directors that is
under pressure to produce high yields will almost always
prefer risky investments in the permissible categories to
prudent ones with lower yields.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This would not be a serious problem if the federal deposit
insurance system did not suppress natural market forces. In a
normally functioning credit market, investors deny funds to
institutions that have dim prospects for using them
prudently.</p>
<p>As long as the incentives for taking risks are small, the
federal deposit insurance system functions satisfactorily, as
indeed it did for 50 years. But when the S&Ls began to suffer
losses or diminished earnings, high-yield investments became
necessary for their continued prosperity or even survival. At
this point, the incentives to take risks overwhelmed the weak
restraints of regulation.</p>
<p>Now many banks may be in a similar predicament. And if so
the engines of speculation -- fueled by federally insured
dollars -- may be revving up. Under these circumstances, the
only thing standing between the taxpayers and another
S&L-type bailout is the willingness and ability of government
regulators to take tough and politically unattractive
measures when the chips are down. FSLIC blinked at the
challenge. We can only hope that bank regulators will behave
differently.</p>
<p>But all this raises deeper questions. Should the taxpayers
have to gamble at such high stakes on the judgments of a few
bank regulators? Is it necessary for the government to be the
front-line insurer of banks? The answer to these questions is
no. The risks taken on by banks and S&Ls can be controlled
and disciplined not by government regulators but by the
market itself -- that is, by giving someone other than the
government an incentive to assure that depository
institutions are investing prudently.</p>
<p>But market discipline is easier to conceive than to
achieve. Although federal deposit insurance makes depositors
indifferent to how their funds are used, it does not
necessarily follow that making depositors worry a little will
address the system's problems. Proposals have been advanced
by some, including the American Bankers Association, to
require depositors to suffer some minimum loss in any bank or
thrift failure. This, it is thought, will force depositors to
look carefully at the banks in which they invest and place a
limit on the resources they make available to managements
unlikely to use them profitably.</p>
<p>Depositors, however, are an inherently poor source of
market discipline. It is unlikely they are treating their
deposits as investments, subject to the usual risk/reward
analysis. Instead, they expect to take no risks with their
funds, and, if there are rumors of instability or possible
loss, will simply withdraw their deposits -- causing a "run."
Moreover, depositors have little effective power to
discipline management. They can withhold or withdraw funds to
be sure, but they lack the shareholders' power to remove
management and alter its policies.</p>
<p>The most promising form of market discipline is private
insurance, where the premiums are related to risk. This is a
direct and effective form of market discipline since risky
behavior by management results in higher insurance costs --
directly affecting management's risk/reward calculation. As
management seeks higher profitability through greater risk,
increasing insurance premiums tax away larger and larger
portions of the benefits management is seeking. Eventually,
decreasing profitability causes the company's equity capital
to lose value, stimulating a takeover or a recapitalization
in which the management is replaced or its policies
substantially altered.</p>
<p>Risk-based deposit insurance won't work, however, if it is
administered by the government. An effective system will
require the insurer to impose widely varying premiums on
institutions competing in the same market. Only if premiums
are modest at the low end and truly painful at the high end
will they have the intended effect of disciplining
management.</p>
<p>The history of the S&L crisis shows clearly that
regulators cannot impose differential treatment on
institutions without generating strong opposition in
Congress. When all of the current hoopla over the Keating
Five and Jim Wright blows over, we may be sure that members
of Congress will be back to putting pressure on government
agencies on behalf of constituents.</p>
<p>Risk-based deposit insurance -- if administered by the
government -- would be an inevitable victim of this process.
The government insurer that assessed significantly higher
deposit insurance premiums against Bank X than against Bank Y
would face the displeasure of Bank X's congressional
supporters. Since a differential premium is essentially a
matter of an insurer's judgment, it will inevitably appear
arbitrary. Add the complications that would arise if the CEO
of Bank X were a Republican and the CEO of Bank Y were a
Democrat.</p>
<p>Instead, any system of risk-based deposit insurance should
be left to the private sector, and administered through
negotiated contractual arrangements without the interference
of government. Indeed, the banking system could insure
itself, with associations or syndicates of banks formed to
guarantee the deposits of other banks in return for a
risk-based premium. The competition among syndicates -- which
would bid for the opportunity to insure particular banks at a
specified initial premium -- would assure that the premium is
based on the market's assessment of the insured institution's
inherent risk.</p>
<p>The premium would be reset frequently, according to a
formula established by contract between the guarantor and the
guaranteed institutions, and would be enforced by a
comprehensive monitoring system in which the day-to-day risks
taken on by the insured institution would be incorporated in
the premium rate. Management would be able to `price' its
risk-taking, because its decisions to take on or shed risk
would have predictable consequences in terms of premium cost.</p>
<p>Insurance is an option on the capital of the insurer, and
there is ample capital available in the banking system to
provide 100% insurance coverage for the deposits and other
liabilities of participating banks. The 550 largest banks and
S&Ls -- those with assets in excess of $1 billion -- have
aggregate capital of approximately $165 billion. This is more
than 10 times the reserves in the FDIC and 150% of all the
capital in the property and casualty insurance industry.
Placing this aggregate capitalization behind the deposits and
other liabilities of U.S. banks and S&Ls would increase their
stability and creditworthiness, lower their cost of funds,
and enhance their international competitiveness.</p>
<p>Moreover, once the banking industry itself has taken
responsibility for the solvency of its individual members,
the government can function as back-up insurer. In this case,
there would be little risk to the government or the taxpayers
and the ordinary depositor would continue to have the peace
of mind conveyed by the FDIC sticker on the door.</p>
<p>Thus, it is possible to design a system of real market
discipline that eliminates the current incentives for
management risk-taking, and places the risk of bank
insolvency on the private sector and not on the taxpayers.
Washington policy makers will have to understand, however,
that the federal deposit insurance system is inherently
unstable. No amount of tinkering with the current system will
eliminate the risk of a taxpayer bailout of the FDIC.</p>
