	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge harshly criticized lawyers working on the
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. bankruptcy case for
excessive legal bills in the first three months of the case
and cut their requested fees by about 14%.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Howard Buschman III said he
was reducing the fees to send a message to lawyers for Drexel
and its creditors. "I can appreciate the fact that at one
time Drexel was a money-machine, but in bankruptcy court you
worry more about expenses," the judge said at a hearing on
the fee requests.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The judge said that because it isn't clear that all
creditors will be paid in this case, "there must be more
control here." Drexel filed for bankruptcy-court protection
Feb. 13.</p>
<p>Judge Buschman approved legal fees of $2.1 million for
Weil, Gotshal & Manges, bankruptcy counsel for Drexel. Weil
Gotshal had requested $2.4 million in fees. The judge cut the
fee request of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, the law firm for
the creditors' committee, by a similar amount, to $1.9
million from $2.2 million.</p>
<p>The judge approved fees of $560,000 for Milgrim Thomajan &
Lee, the New York law firm for Drexel's shareholders'
committee. The law firm had requested $642,997. Milgrim began
working on the case about two months after Drexel filed for
Chapter 11 protection.</p>
<p>The fee request of Cahill Gordon & Reindel, special
counsel to Drexel on matters such as investigations by the
Securities and Exchange Commission and Congress, was reduced
to $90,000 from $126,492.</p>
<p>The judge also ordered that a fourth of the approved
payments be withheld until the case is completed, a common
step taken in bankruptcy cases. As a result, Weil Gotshal and
Jones Day will only receive about 65% of the fees they
requested at this time.</p>
<p>The total amount of approved fees, however, could be
changed when a final decision on fees is made at the end of
the bankruptcy proceedings, which is expected early next
year. As a result, the attorneys could end up with the total
they requested, although the cuts ordered by Judge Buschman
for now are likely to put pressure on the attorneys to hold
down spending.</p>
<p>Paul Merolla, Drexel's general counsel, told Judge
Buschman that the company was alarmed at the total fees being
sought in the case by attorneys and other professionals, such
as accountants and financial advisers.</p>
<p>"We are concerned that the professional fees in this
matter for the first year will exceed the $50 million mark,
and we believe that is a conservative estimate. . . . It's
staggering," Mr. Merolla said. "We're going down a road here
that is extremely exorbitant."</p>
<p>Judge Buschman also criticized attorneys for Drexel and
the creditors' committee for some of their out-of-pocket
expenses, such as $300,000 in copying expenses. He said much
of the excess spending was caused by unnecessary
contentiousness between Drexel and the creditors.</p>
<p>Judge Buschman also approved fees totaling $2.8 million
for accountants and financial advisers, down from the
requested $3 million.</p>

<p>COURT VOIDS a California law aimed at keeping politics out
of some elections.</p>
<p>The Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that a state
constitutional amendment approved by California voters in
1986 was a violation of the First Amendment's free-speech and
association guarantees. The amendment banned party
endorsements in judicial and other nonpartisan elections in
the state.</p>
<p>The 8-3 ruling overturned a decision by a three-judge
panel of the appeals court last year. The panel had said the
ban was justifiable because the state had a compelling
interest in ensuring nonpartisan election of local and
judicial officeholders.</p>
<p>Writing for the majority, Chief Judge Alfred Goodwin held
that the ban "burdens political speech without being narrowly
tailored to serve compelling state interests." In dissent,
Judge Arthur Alarcon asserted that the ruling could have a
"devastating impact" on the integrity of local officeholders
and on judicial independence.</p>
<p>The decision, if upheld, could significantly alter the
face of California politics, giving political parties the
edge in a battle with reformists that dates back 75 years,
when nonpartisan contests were first instituted.</p>
<p>The ruling arose out of a 1987 challenge to an attempt by
San Francisco election authorities to ban official party
endorsements in the wake of the 1986 voter-approved
constitutional amendment.</p>

<p>HOME SHOPPING NETWORK bondholders win court battle against
firm.</p>
<p>A Delaware Chancery Court ruled that the television
retailer was wrong in placing a notice on certain common
shares that it issued in exchange for its debentures, thereby
rendering those shares virtually worthless.</p>
<p>The ruling holds Home Shopping liable for damages -- as
yet undetermined -- to current and former bondholders who saw
a drop in the value of their securities. The decision also
means current bondholders will be entitled to swap their
securities at the reset conversion price set out by the
indenture.</p>
<p>Home Shopping said it will appeal the case to the Delaware
Supreme Court. The company's general counsel, Nando DiFilippo
Jr., said an in-house study indicated possible damages
wouldn't be "financially material to the company."</p>
<p>Richard Lilly, an analyst with JW Charles Securities Inc.,
concurred. "The potential liability is probably a fraction of
a penny" of per-share earnings, he said.</p>
<p>The case involves $100 million in 5 1/2% convertible
debentures sold in 1987 by the now defunct Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. Home Shopping later sued Drexel alleging, among
other things, that the firm defrauded Home Shopping by
inducing it to agree to a provision resetting the exchange
rate.</p>
<p>The bonds, when originally issued, were convertible into
common at $25.80 a share, but during the interim year, Home
Shopping's stock plunged in the market. As a result, when the
reset provision took effect in 1988, the bonds were
convertible at $7.05 a share. Instead of having to issue 38.8
shares for each $1,000 face amount of bonds, Home Shopping
had to issue 141.8 shares to bondholders seeking to convert
under the reset provision.</p>
<p>Home Shopping placed a notice on the extra shares issued
warning that if it won its suit against Drexel the shares
might be valueless.</p>
<p>In its ruling Tuesday, the Delaware Chancery Court said
the placement of the notice on the shares violated the bond
indenture and it held the company liable to a class of all
bondholders as of May 4, 1988, except the Drexel group.</p>
<p>The Chancery Court is expected to hold additional
proceedings to establish the amount of damages. David Parker,
an attorney at the New York firm of Kleinberg, Kaplan, Wolff
& Cohen who represents the bondholders, claims damages will
be "very substantial."</p>

<p>NEW YORK'S CON EDISON HIT with lawsuits arising from
Monday's blackout.</p>
<p>Within 48 hours after a substation fire caused a power
failure that crippled New York City's downtown financial
district on Monday, two consumers sued the utility.</p>
<p>The Harbor Lights Inc., a restaurant, sued alleging that
Consolidated Edison Co. of New York was guilty of gross
negligence in failing to have a backup system in place. Brian
O'Dwyer, a partner with the New York law firm O'Dwyer &
Bernstein, said his client stands to lose as much as $500,000
by Monday, when the power is expected to be restored to the
restaurant.</p>
<p>Sage Realty Corp., which manages a downtown building, also
sued Con Ed and filed a motion in state court requesting that
all records related to the fire at the substation be held for
discovery, or pretrial fact-finding. Rory Cutaia, a partner
in the New York law firm Shea & Gould, which represents the
realty company, said Con Ed offered his client a generator
until power is restored.</p>
<p>Frank Leonard, Con Ed's assistant general counsel, said
Mr. Cutaia can send in experts to inspect the damaged
substation.</p>
<p>A Con Ed official said the utility carries insurance to
cover the payment of damages from blackout-related suits. A
citywide blackout in 1977 led to numerous lawsuits.</p>

<p>JUDGE ORDERS ATTORNEY to pay $307,515 for "frivolous"
litigation.</p>
<p>The Houston attorney, Armando Lopez, had brought suit on
behalf of 24 investors who alleged they were defrauded in a
1984 oil and gas limited partnership offering. The suit
sought $30 million in damages from Ehrman Investment Group
Inc., a Houston-area company which sold the partnerships, and
several individuals.</p>
<p>But in ordering Mr. Lopez to pay defense attorneys' fees
and fines, U.S. District Judge Norman W. Black said the suit
was pursued "for the sole purpose of harassing" the
defendants. Moreover, he said Mr. Lopez had submitted an
altered document to the court, delayed proceedings, failed to
produce witnesses and refused to cooperate in discovery
matters.</p>
<p>Mr. Lopez said he was shocked at the action and would ask
the court to reconsider. He also said Judge Black knew the
suit wasn't frivolous because the Securities and Exchange
Commission had filed a similar action in his court against
many of the same defendants.</p>

<p>LEGAL STAFF OF THE RTC to be led by a Phoenix lawyer.</p>
<p>Gerald L. Jacobs, 51, a partner in the Phoenix law firm of
O'Connor, Cavanaugh, Anderson, Westover, Killingsworth &
Beshears, will join the Resolution Trust Corp. as special
counsel Sept. 1, overseeing 350 lawyers in the RTC's
Washington headquarters and four regional offices. The RTC is
a government agency managing and attempting to sell insolvent
savings and loan associations and their assets.</p>
<p>The special counsel's post had been held by Rex Veal, who
is leaving to return to private practice as a partner at
Powell, Goldstein, Frazer & Murphy, a 240-lawyer law firm in
Atlanta.</p>
