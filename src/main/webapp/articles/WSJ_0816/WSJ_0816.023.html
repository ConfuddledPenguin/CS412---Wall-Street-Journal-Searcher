	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Tembec Inc., a pulp and paper concern, said
its 50%-owned Patriot Paper Corp. agreed to acquire an idle
paper mill in Boston from James River Corp., a Richmond, Va.,
pulp and paper company. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Tembec said Patriot will invest about US$50 million over
the next 18 months to modernize the mill's equipment and
increase the capacity of its de-inking plant. Patriot plans
to produce office and printing papers, using pulp made from
recycled white, or office, papers collected in the Boston
area. The Boston mill can produce about 200 tons of paper a
day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tembec, which holds an option to increase its interest in
Patriot to 73%, said the remaining 50% of Patriot is held by
two U.S. businessmen.</p>
