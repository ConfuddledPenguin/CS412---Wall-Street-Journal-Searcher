	<p class="article-leader">The Internal Revenue Service, outgunned and outmanned, is
trying a little glasnost in dealing with big corporations.
   The tax agency is asking large corporate taxpayers for
more help and cooperation in handling major tax audits. The
idea is to speed up collections while eliminating contentious
disputes that can drag through the courts for years -- and
frequently result in losses for the IRS.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But welcoming the IRS embrace puts corporations in
something of a quandary: they applaud efforts to simplify
audits and eliminate delays, but fear the program ultimately
could result in more frequent audits, higher taxes and more
litigation.</p>
<p>A lot of money is at stake. The IRS already generates
about $10 billion a year in tax assessments from large
companies -- about half the revenue from all audits -- while
it devotes only 27% of its resources to the task.</p>
<p>The beefed-up program generally has the support of
accountants and corporate tax experts, but they remain
cautious on some points. William M. Burk, president of the
Tax Executives Institute Inc., composed of 4,300 corporate
tax executives, recently told the IRS that "unless taxpayers
can be convinced that the IRS's initiatives are quality- not
revenue-driven, the likelihood of long-term, systemic gains
is remote." Mr. Burk is director of domestic taxes for CPC
International Inc., Englewood Cliffs, N.J.</p>
<p>The IRS's new audit program "appears to be a virtual
assurance that the audit relationship between corporate
taxpayers (not just the largest companies) and the IRS will
become more adversarial," accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick
warned in a recent advisory to clients.</p>
<p>Concentrating on the biggest corporate taxpayers isn't
new. Since 1966, the IRS has run a Coordinated Examination
Program to audit large corporate taxpayers in a timely and
efficient manner. A team of IRS auditors can spend as much as
two years or more auditing a company. The program now
involves 1,565 companies.</p>
<p>But the effort hasn't been as productive as the IRS's top
management thinks it should be. Audits and disputes take too
long to resolve. Auditors assert huge claims in many cases
but actually recover a relatively low percentage of the
amounts claimed. "The IRS is outgunned," says Ann Witte, a
professor of economics at Wellesley College. "It's now trying
to overcome that."</p>
<p>The IRS says it currently has about 600 tax cases pending,
each seeking at least $10 million, and totaling $35 billion
in claimed deficiencies. Resolving disputes faster would
whittle down that sum, officials assert.</p>
<p>The agency hasn't done well in converting its audit
assessments into cash. Through appeals and tax court
proceedings the IRS recovers only about 20% to 25% of the
additional amounts it seeks, and critics say it could do
better. KPMG Peat Marwick calculates that increasing the
recovery rate by 10% would result in an additional $3.4
billion in federal revenue, enough to satisfy President
Bush's expectations for the IRS to raise $3 billion by fiscal
1991.</p>
<p>Complex cases stack up because IRS auditors don't have
enough expertise in the quirks of particular industries or of
new complex issues that may cross industry lines. And there
have been serious shortcomings in internal communication and
coordination of the IRS approach to different companies in
the same industry. IRS auditors tend to focus on the
immediate problems related to the company they're working on,
not knowing how similar issues are handled elsewhere.</p>
<p>Under the new program recently approved by top IRS
officials, the agency plans to spend about $4.6 million this
year to add 48 national and regional specialists; officials
think the program will "accelerate collection of revenue by
$550 million" in fiscal 1991. A key move will be the
appointment later this year of a national director to run the
new program.</p>
<p>The program will "significantly improve our ability to
identify emerging issues in difficult audits that are widely
dispersed and complex, reduce for us and the taxpayer the
time spent on unproductive issues and reduce the time of the
audit," says Marty Washburn, IRS deputy assistant
commissioner for examinations.</p>
<p>"Our intent in all of this is to improve the program and
build a relationship with the taxpayers," says Bill C. Roth,
director of examinations at the IRS. "If we implemented it in
our own way it would have been adversarial."</p>
<p>The IRS is calling for, among other things, a more
centralized program with better trained auditors; it proposes
creation of a national policy board which would "look at the
big picture of tax administration," a national director who
would be in charge of program development, more industry and
issue specialization among its agents and improved training
through outside help.</p>
<p>The plan would expand specialization by creating more
technical positions. For example, audits would take advantage
of technical experts who are familiar with a special issue,
such as foreign-tax credit, or who are knowledgeable about a
particular industry, such as textiles.</p>
<p>Such experts would be trained by increased use of outside
consultants and tax specialists. This would address a recent
criticism by the General Accounting Office that senior
staffers were spending too much time training rather than on
auditing cases.</p>
<p>Some critics argue that specialization might not resolve
the longstanding problem of a high employee turnover rate at
the IRS. Many auditors are junior-level employees paid far
less than their corporate counterparts and who tend to skip
to the private sector after several years. The IRS has
countered that the salary problem can't be solved by the
agency alone since it plagues the whole federal government.</p>
<p>The plan also calls for better communication between
regional offices. The IRS concedes that lack of communication
has hurt development of issues. Under the plan, a national
office would analyze issues so that a consistent policy could
be developed. Also, there would be movement of cases and
personnel between regions according to workload and issue or
industry expertise. Technical information would be posted on
an electronic bulletin board that auditors in the field could
look to for help.</p>
<p>To critics of the plan, the centralization of the audits
smacks of delays, not faster audits. They argue that problems
that could be resolved at the regional level may have to go
through another bureaucratic step, causing delays.</p>
<p>Corporate taxpayers are also concerned with the proposal
to have IRS lawyers readily available to give legal advice to
auditors from the start of the examination.</p>
<p>Critics argue lawyers would unnecessarily burden the
auditing process. "We don't think the legal side of the IRS
is very good at making quick decisions and move the process
through," said Neil P. Wissing, director of taxes for
Weyerhaeuser Co.</p>
<p>But Mr. Roth of the IRS contends that the purpose of a
legal counsel would be to give technical advice, not to
prepare for litigation. Nevertheless, "the fact that we have
counsel there would help in situations where a taxpayer is
trying to stonewall us," he said.</p>
