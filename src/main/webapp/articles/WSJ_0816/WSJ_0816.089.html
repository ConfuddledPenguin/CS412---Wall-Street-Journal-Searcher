	<p class="article-leader">The Federal Reserve Board denied Bank of New York Co.'s
petition to acquire Northeast Bancorp, ending a bitter
dispute between the two banks over what constituted a fair
price for Northeast.
   The Fed said that even at the $195.6 million price that
Bank of New York has said it would be willing to pay for
Northeast, the acquisition would hurt Bank of New York's
ability to maintain a strong capital position.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When the banks first reached a tentative agreement on the
purchase last year Bank of New York said it would pay 250% of
Northeast's book value. Northeast, which is the parent of
Union Trust Co., Connecticut's third-biggest commercial bank,
claimed a book value of $33.53 a share as recently as March
30, 1990, which would indicate a purchase price of about $500
million.</p>
<p>But Bank of New York has been arguing for some time that
Northeast's true book value was something more closely akin
to $12.31 a share, based on the deteriorating outlook for its
real estate loan portfolio. Some analysts suggested that Bank
of New York was more interested in calling off the deal than
proceeding. Earlier this year Northeast sued Bank of New York
in an effort to force it to complete the merger agreement or
pay damages.</p>
<p>During the course of the dispute Northeast's shares have
fluctuated from a high of $72, when the deal appeared
ironclad, to a low of $14.50. Yesterday's decision came after
the stock market closed. Northeast stock closed yesterday at
$17.50, up $2, in national over-the-counter trading. Bank of
New York said that in light of the Fed decision "the
acquisition cannot proceed." Officials of Northeast couldn't
be reached.</p>
<p>The Fed decision ends the dispute between the two banks,
but raises questions about the ability of Bank of New York
and other large banks to make acquisitions. The Fed noted in
its decision that it "expects banking organizations
contemplating expansion proposals to maintain strong capital
levels substantially above the minimum levels specified in
the board's capital adequacy guidelines. . . ." Bank of New
York's proposed acquisition of Northeast "is inconsistent"
with that policy, the Fed said.</p>
<p>Yet bankers and bank analysts agree that one of the basic
solutions to the banking industry's mounting problems is a
massive wave of consolidation that permits banks to slash
overhead costs while expanding their market reach. But that
consolidation may be jeopardized by the inability of many
proposed mergers to meet the Fed's capital guideline tests.</p>
