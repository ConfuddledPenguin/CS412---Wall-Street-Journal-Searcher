	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In a choice that seemed to come out of left
field, the New York Yankees named a theater owner and
producer to succeed George Steinbrenner as general partner.
   Robert Nederlander, president of the Nederlander
Organization and a limited owner of the baseball team, was
voted into the job by his fellow owners at a meeting in
Cleveland. Mr. Nederlander couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Steinbrenner said, "I have great confidence in Robert
as my selection. He comes from a family that has been
associated with my family for 20 years."</p>
<p>A Yankees spokesman said that Mr. Nederlander was
approached after Mr. Steinbrenner's son, Hank, told his
father "he wasn't interested" in running the Yankees.</p>
<p>The appointment of Mr. Nederlander, having been approved
by a majority of the 18 limited partners, must also be
approved by three-quarters of the American League owners and
a majority of the National League owners.</p>
<p>Mr. Nederlander, 57 years old, is described by New York
theater producers as soft-spoken, low-key and businesslike,
working behind the scenes in the family business. "Robert is
the quiet member of the family; very decent and well
respected," said producer Arthur Cantor. "He's a lawyer, a
good businessman and he won't do anything without weighing
it. He is temperamentally totally opposite from George
Steinbrenner."</p>
<p>"Anyone who can survive in the theater can survive in
baseball: the Nederlanders are very gutsy," said another
Broadway producer, David Brown. "Baseball is a kind of
theater: they have a lot in common."</p>
<p>Mr. Nederlander is one of five brothers and a sister, most
of whom are closely involved with the family business, run
primarily from New York and Detroit. The Nederlanders own or
lease about 30 theaters and concert venues around the country
and in London. Mr. Nederlander's more flamboyant brother,
James Nederlander, is chairman of the Nederlander
Organization in New York and directly involved with booking
the theaters and producing shows. Robert Nederlander handles
primarily financial and real estate aspects of the family
business, said Nederlander general manager Arthur Rubin.</p>
<p>The Yankees limited partners were asked not to talk to the
press about the appointment, but a source close to the team
said that Mr. Nederlander was "a tremendously popular
choice," adding, "It's going to be a whole different
ballgame."</p>
