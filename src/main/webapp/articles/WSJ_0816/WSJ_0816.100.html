	<p class="article-leader">GREENWICH, Conn. -- Howmet Corp., a maker of superalloy
castings and metals, and a unit of French state-owned
Pechiney Group, said it purchased a site in North Haven,
Conn., for a new plant to refurbish parts for jet aircraft
engines. The price wasn't disclosed.
   Howmet, which already operates two U.S. plants that
refurbish aircraft parts, said the acquisition includes a
building where the company plans to establish a facility for
coating and repairing parts for advanced jet planes, such as
blades and vanes.</p>
