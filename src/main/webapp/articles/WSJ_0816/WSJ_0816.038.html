	<p class="article-leader">Airlines' Fuel Bills
   May Have Mild Impact</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>AIRLINES HAVE been doing a lot of howling recently about
rising fuel costs. But a look at those costs suggests they
may not be quite so bad.</p>
<p>Most carriers now are paying about 70 cents a gallon.
That's about 20% more than a month ago, but it isn't all that
high compared with what airlines have paid before. Only seven
months ago, airlines were paying 78 cents a gallon. And in
1985 -- a year in which the industry had $860 million in
profits -- airlines paid 85 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>Moreover, consultants say airlines recently tried to push
through some fare increases that overcompensated for the
higher fuel costs. American Airlines, America West and Pan
American World Airways initially proposed 10% fare increases
last week. "American wants to be fair with its customers,"
the carrier said at the time. "We are especially sorry to do
this because we know that higher fares will create hardship
for many."</p>
<p>Consultants say, however, that because fuel accounts for
about one-seventh of an airline's expenses, fare increases of
10% would result in revenue increases much greater than the
added cost of fuel so far. "Fuel prices may go up 20%, but
the airlines' total expenses don't go up anywhere near that
much," says Theodore Harris, chairman of Airline Industry
Resources, a consulting firm.</p>
<p>At most, the industry would need fare increases of 2% to
3% to recover the added fuel costs so far, Mr. Harris
calculates. "Anything beyond that is pure profiteering," he
says.</p>
<p>Airlines say the fare situation isn't that simple.
American says it can't raise foreign fares quickly to recover
higher fuel costs because such changes must be cleared by
foreign governments. Airlines add that they've already sold
many seats at prices that don't reflect higher fuel costs.</p>
<p>Still, the proposed 10% fare increases didn't stick. Most
airlines now plan a 5.3% overall fuel-related increase and
are cutting some vacation fares.</p>
<p>At This Carrier,</p>
<p>The Green Eyes Have It</p>
<p>GREENAIR, a carrier in Turkey, has come up with an
eye-catching promotion: Women with green eyes get 50% off any
fare.</p>
<p>The carrier says it's trying to promote its name and
didn't expect the huge response it's received. Green-eyed
women are supposed to be rare in Turkey, but hundreds have
used the discount. "Maybe a lot of them are wearing green
contact lenses," says Besim Tibuk, president of Net Holding
Inc., a Turkish company that jointly owns GreenAir with the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The airline plans to offer the discount for a year. "I bet
you'd never see a U.S. airline do this," says Mr. Tibuk, who
has brown eyes.</p>
<p>Though extreme, the green-eyed discount points up how
foreign carriers are becoming more innovative in discounting
-- in contrast to U.S. carriers, which long ago abandoned the
"peanut" fares offered in the early '80s.</p>
<p>Air France recently offered a two-for-one deal on flights
from Newark, N.J., to Paris. To celebrate New Year's, Virgin
Atlantic Airways usually comes up with a bargain New
York-London fare. (In 1989, the fare was $89 one way; in
1990, $99.) Several other carriers, including Icelandair and
British Airways, periodically offer last-minute fares that
can be more than 50% below full coach fares.</p>
<p>Travel Dollars Visit</p>
<p>Out-of-the-Way Spots</p>
<p>MUCH OF THE MONEY people spend on travel doesn't go into
their trips.</p>
<p>According to a Runzheimer International analysis of a
typical trip, 26% of every dollar spent on air fares, hotels
and car rentals is used for federal and local taxes, travel
agent commissions, credit card fees, computer reservation
system charges and freebies to large corporate clients.</p>
<p>By far the biggest fee is travel agent commissions, which
absorb 13% of every travel dollar. Runzheimer also says
municipal taxes on hotels are rising rapidly. "It's much
easier for a town to raise taxes for out-of-towners than for
residents," says Ted Stephan, associate editor for Runzheimer
Report on Travel Management.</p>

<p>             Where Travel Dollars Go</p>
<p>Assuming a traveler spends $1,562 for a three-day trip
from New York to Los Angeles (including air fare, car rental
and hotel), here's where the money goes that isn't directly
part of the travel product:</p>
<p>Taxes                                    $129</p>
<p>Travel agent commissions                  201</p>
<p>Credit card fees                           46</p>
<p>Computer transaction fees                   8</p>
<p>Giveaways to travel agents</p>
<p>  and large customers                      23</p>

<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>IF THE CRISIS in the Persian Gulf creates world-wide
gasoline shortages, the Hyatt Lake Tahoe Resort, in Incline
Village, Nev., will be prepared. During the last energy
crunch in the '70s, the resort put in its own gasoline pumps
so it could guarantee guests a full tank to make the trip
home. The hotel chain says it kept the pumps -- just in case.
. . . The equivalent of automated bank tellers is coming to
the car rental industry. Budget Rent a Car Corp. is
experimenting with remote rental booths at such
unconventional sites as shopping malls and hotels. Customers
use a video booth to dial a reservation agent and receive a
car key. The rental car is in a nearby parking lot.</p>
