	<p class="article-leader">The Pentagon, signaling its continuing interest in
high-definition display systems, announced the selection of
six more contractors to work on military applications of the
advanced technology.
   The contractors are to pursue various aspects of this
technology, which can produce finely detailed images or
high-volume information through conventional electron tubes
or flat-panel screens.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Zenith Electronics Corp. of Glenview, Ill., one of the
largest of the companies, was chosen to work on enhancing the
capability of cathode-ray tubes that are commonly used in
television sets and computers. Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc. of
Troy, Mich., will make active-matrix liquid-crystal displays
for aircraft cockpits and other military uses.</p>
<p>The other companies selected are Norden Systems Inc.,
Norwalk, Conn.; MRS Technology Inc., Chelmsford, Mass.;
Microelectronics & Computer Technology Corp., Austin, Texas;
and Tektronix Inc., Beaverton, Ore. The amount of awards for
each of these companies will be announced after they complete
negotiations with the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, the Pentagon unit overseeing the program.</p>
<p>Though the Pentagon intends to use the advanced displays
only for its own purposes, the underlying technology
potentially has enormous commercial value in the future
manufacture of computers, medical imaging systems, and
high-definition television.</p>
<p>The selections confirm statements by senior Pentagon aides
that this and other programs associated with Darpa's former
director, Craig Fields, will continue. Mr. Fields reportedly
lost his job because his Pentagon superiors objected to his
advocacy of a strong U.S. effort to promote new technologies
to meet the challenge of other industrial nations.</p>
<p>The Pentagon said the selections complete the process of
identifying U.S. companies that are qualified to work in the
high-definition display field. Ten other U.S. companies,
including Xerox Corp. and Texas Instruments Inc., were
admitted to the program earlier.</p>
<p>Zenith said the federal government plans to spend at least
$1 million to finance part of the company's research on
displays for military computers. Though the award is
relatively small, it will be a boost for Zenith, which is
spending $10 million of its own money this year for research
on high-definition television systems, which promise sharper
pictures and sound than current television sets deliver.</p>
<p>The grant gives Zenith help in its effort to come up with
larger-screen versions of its so-called flat tension mask
color picture tubes. Zenith's clear, flat displays now are
used for computers, but the company hopes to use them for
HDTV sets in the future.</p>
<p>Zenith is battling larger and better-financed foreign
companies to come up with an HDTV system for the U.S.</p>
