	<p class="article-leader">Investors poured $3.5 billion more into money market
mutual funds in the latest week, amid continued uncertainty
about the stock and bond markets.
   Assets of 431 taxable funds rose $3 billion in the week
ended Tuesday, to $393.9 billion, a record, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Assets of 228 tax-free
funds grew $457.2 million to a record $79.9 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yields, meanwhile, were flat. The average seven-day
compound yield of the taxable funds stayed at 7.78%,
remaining at the lowest level since the fall of 1988.
Compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends.</p>
<p>The latest surge in money funds comes at a time when
investors are faced with considerable uncertainty in the
stock and bond markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has
fallen about 150 points since Aug. 2, when Iraqi troops moved
into Kuwait. Long-term bond prices have fallen significantly.
Total money fund assets had surged $6.8 billion in the week
ended Aug. 7.</p>
<p>Average maturity of the taxable funds' investments -- such
things as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs), bank
certificates of deposit, and short-term Treasury securities
-- remained at a fairly long 45 days, within the range of the
past few months and a sign that yields aren't likely to
change significantly anytime soon.</p>
<p>Noting that short-term interest rates have been "kind of
flat," Martha Wittbrodt, editor of the Holliston, Mass.,
newsletter, said there's no reason for fund managers to
change maturities. Average maturity has been as short as 29
days and as long as 53 days in recent years.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
remained at 7.50%. The average 30-day simple yield slid to
7.54% from 7.58%, and the average 30-day compound yield eased
to 7.83% from 7.87%.</p>
<p>The average seven-day compound yield of the tax-free funds
inched up to 5.21% from 5.19%. That's equal to a taxable
yield of 7.24% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket and
7.78% for someone paying 33% taxes.</p>
<p>Average maturity for the tax-exempt funds lengthened one
day to 55 days.</p>
