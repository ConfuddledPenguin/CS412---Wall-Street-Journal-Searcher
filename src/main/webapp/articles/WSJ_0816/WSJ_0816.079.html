	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Lowndes Queensway PLC, a U.K. retailing group,
said it has moved to seek court-appointed administrative
receivers.
   The move follows discussions with the company's bankers,
Lowndes said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lowndes Queensway, which was acquired by investment group
Lowndes Ventures in July 1989 through a leveraged buyout,
moved in January to refinance its debts. Its troubles were
exacerbated by rising U.K. interest rates and plunging
consumer demand for its furniture and household goods.</p>
