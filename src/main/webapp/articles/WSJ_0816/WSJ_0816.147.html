	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In federal court in Manhattan, the former
president of a Teledyne Inc. division was charged with making
false statements to the Defense Department in connection with
an alleged scheme to defraud the Navy on a helicopter
contract.
   The defendant, Cirino Giampapa, 69 years old, of
Massapequa, N.Y., was president of Teledyne Hydra-Power, a
division of the parent company's Teledyne Industries Inc.
unit. In a settlement with the Defense Department, the unit
last year paid $11.9 million to cover overcharges stemming
from the scheme, as well as interest and penalties, the U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Walter Bonner, an attorney for Mr. Giampapa, could not be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>Avraham Moskowitz, the assistant U.S. attorney in charge
of the case, said Teledyne Hydra-Power submitted false claims
totaling $4.5 million between 1980 and 1986. The alleged
scheme involved inflating the number of hours worked. The
figures were provided to the Defense Department and to its
general contractors to justify prices charged by the Teledyne
division for helicopter parts it made.</p>
<p>A Teledyne spokesman said the company's auditing staff
uncovered the problem in 1986, which was then flagged to the
Defense and Justice departments.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office said that Michael Rosenberg,
41, of Suffern, N.Y., a former controller at Teledyne
Hydra-Power, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to
defraud the U.S. in connection with the alleged scheme.
Morton Baine, 54, of New Rochelle, N.Y., also a former
controller at the division, was charged with participating in
the alleged conspiracy.</p>
<p>Carl Bernstein, an attorney for Mr. Baine, said his client
pleaded innocent.</p>
<p>Elkan Abramowitz, an attorney for Mr. Rosenberg, couldn't
be reached for comment. The U.S. attorney's office said Mr.
Rosenberg's sentencing is set for Oct. 17 before U.S. Judge
Vincent Broderick.</p>
