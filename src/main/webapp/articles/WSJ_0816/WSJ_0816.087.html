	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A year and a half after Barry Minkow was
sentenced to a 25-year prison term, the Securities and
Exchange Commission has slapped injunctions on him and
several other officers and associates of his collapsed
carpet-cleaning firm, ZZZZ Best Co.
   In response to an SEC suit alleging various fraudulent
representations in ZZZZ Best's registration and financial
statements, Mr. Minkow and eleven other defendants agreed to
decrees permanently enjoining them from violations of various
securities laws. Two other defendants, Maurice Rind and Mark
M. Roddy, haven't signed consent decrees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The SEC said it is seeking $700,000 from Mr. Rind, the
amount paid to him by ZZZZ Best for 22 electrical generators
that were listed on the company's books as worth $2 million.
By inflating the value of the generators, ZZZZ Best was able
to obtain a listing of its securities on the National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System,
the SEC said. An attorney for Mr. Rind couldn't immediately
be reached for comment. Mr. Roddy, who was sentenced to five
years for his role in the ZZZZ Best affair, is in prison in
Texas and couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Minkow, chairman and founder of ZZZZ Best, was
sentenced in March, 1989, to 25 years in prison and ordered
to pay $26 million in restitution for his role in the ZZZZ
Best fraud. An SEC spokeswoman said the delay in filing this
latest action came because several of the allegations weren't
in the original federal criminal case, and the allegations
took considerable time to investigate.</p>
