	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo share prices continued to soar on reports that Iraq
may withdraw its forces from Kuwait, with the Nikkei Index
posting its third-largest single-day advance.
   But trading was moderate, and analysts weren't confident
that the market's current bearish streak had snapped.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In London, meanwhile, shares firmed slightly in a choppy
session, aided by news that Imperial Chemical Industries sold
its 25% stake in Enterprise Oil.</p>
<p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index closed at 28112.12, up 1439.59, or
5.4%. Combined with the previous day's advance, the 225-share
index posted a gain of nearly 2000 points in two days. Prices
rose across the board, but turnover was a meager 450 million
shares, up from Tuesday's 363 million shares. Advancers
outnumbered decliners 952 to 71, while 50 shares were
unchanged.</p>
<p>At midmorning in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index was down
450.75 points at 27661.37.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues
listed in the first section gained 79.16 points, or 3.92%, to
2099.49.</p>
<p>The second section index rose 105.35 points, or 2.51%, to
4100.71. Volume in the section was estimated at 11.7 million
shares, up from 9.9 million shares.</p>
<p>Analysts say it is still uncertain whether the market has
bottomed out. "It is still too early to say the market has
turned around. It is still half-hearted," said Yasuhiko
Shinza, a fund manager at Nippon Life Insurance Co.</p>
<p>Toshihiko Yoshimi, a senior analyst at Yamaichi Securities
Co., agreed: "There might be another gain of 1000 points or
so {Thursday} but I don't think the market is ready to go
back beyond the 30000-point level." He described the gain as
"technical" over the steep decline in the past two weeks and
said the market doesn't have much energy.</p>
<p>Indeed, many analysts say the supply-demand situation
isn't favorable as institutional investors are waiting for a
chance to liquidate their holdings in time for the closing of
books for the first half ending next month. Analysts also
point to an unfavorable interest rate outlook. One analyst at
a major Japanese brokerage firm said, "There isn't any factor
at all in sight that might bring down interest rates."</p>
<p>High interest rates and the crisis in the Middle East were
two major factors behind the recent dive in share prices. In
the two weeks since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the market
had fallen more than 4000 points and at one point this week,
the index was down one-third from its peak at the end of last
year.</p>
<p>But a few analysts noted an increasing view that the
market might have hit bottom, observing the reversal in the
attitude of investors who had been selling futures or selling
shares on credit. These analysts also noted increased buying
in Wednesday's trading by institutional investors such as
life insurance companies and investment trusts.</p>
<p>The yen's advance on the foreign-exchange market
contributed to the sharp advance on the equity market,
boosting bond prices.</p>
<p>Benefiting from the broad-based support Wednesday were
medium-sized blue-chip issues, such as Hitachi, up 110 yen to
1390 yen (74 cents to $9.35). Fujitsu rose 80 yen to 1340
yen, while Matsushita Electric Industrial rose 90 yen to 1890
yen.</p>
<p>Sony rose 260 yen to 8080 yen, TDK gained 360 yen to 6620
yen, Fanuc rose 310 yen to 6490 yen, and Kyocera recovered
180 yen to 8180 yen.</p>
<p>Heavy industry shares jumped higher as well. Kawasaki
Heavy rose 29 yen to 688 yen, IHI added 37 yen to 867 yen,
and Mitsubishi Heavy rose 40 yen to 870 yen.</p>
<p>Trading house shares, which have been hurt badly by the
Persian Gulf conflict, recovered some losses. Mitsubishi
Corp. gained 60 yen to 1300 yen and Sumitomo Corp. rose 80
yen to 1130 yen.</p>
<p>In London, the ICI deal was done early in the morning,
with brokerage firms Warburg Securities Ltd. and Cazenove &
Co. confirming that they bought ICI's block of 113.3 million
Enterprise shares for 600 pence apiece, or #679.6 million
($11.39 apiece, or $1.29 billion).</p>
<p>The firms then sold the shares on the open market for
about 607 pence a share, dealers said. A total of 232 million
Enterprise shares changed hands, with the stock closing down
45 pence at 628 pence. Meanwhile, ICI gained 5 pence to 950
pence.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
5.3 points to 2239.3. Volume was 563.6 million shares,
compared with 330.9 million issues Tuesday. A large chunk of
yesterday's total came from the sale of the Enterprise stake.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index rose 5.6 points to
1748.2.</p>
<p>Dealers said that except for the Enterprise news, which
had been widely rumored, there wasn't much activity. Trading
conditions were sketchy as many investment decision makers
have closed their books for the summer holidays, the dealers
added.</p>
<p>Ultramar shed 3 pence to 341 pence. The oil and gas
company said it agreed to acquire certain marketing and
refining assets of Imperial Oil Ltd., the Canadian unit of
Exxon Corp., for about #60 million.</p>
<p>The oil majors also fell amid what one dealer termed
"shallow" profit-taking.</p>
<p>British Petroleum fell 5 pence to 359 pence, while Shell
Transport & Trading slid 9 pence to 475 pence. Both stocks
have advanced rapidly on the heels on developments in the
Middle East, market watchers said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Lowndes Queensway, a furniture and carpets
company, called in receivers after it asked for its shares to
be suspended at 1 3/4 pence. The company said it has been
hurt by high U.K. base rates and falling consumer demand.</p>
<p>Ferranti fell a penny to 25 pence. The electronics concern
said shareholders took up 47.3% of a 1-for-4 rights issue
offered as part of an efforts to gain better terms from bank
creditors.</p>
<p>At 25 pence a share, the offer gives Ferranti #22.1
million. The remainder of the issue will go to its
underwriters, including Baring Brothers & Co., the company's
financial advisers.</p>
<p>Also, shares closed higher in Frankfurt, Zurich and
Amsterdam and mixed in Stockholm. South African gold stocks
closed down. Brussels, Madrid, Milan and Paris were closed
for a holiday.</p>
<p>And stocks closed higher in Hong Kong, Taipei, Manila,
Singapore and Wellington, and lower in Sydney. Seoul was
closed for a holiday.</p>

as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
