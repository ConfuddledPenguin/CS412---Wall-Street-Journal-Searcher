	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Trump Shuttle, which has been on and off
the market once this year, may soon be up for sale again.
   Some of Donald Trump's bankers, holding $245 million in
senior Shuttle debt, suggested that Mr. Trump sell the
airline rather than lose money operating it, according to
people who attended a meeting of Shuttle lenders yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the banks do not expect the Shuttle to sell for
anything close to what Mr. Trump paid for it, some of them --
including lead lender Citibank -- said in the meeting that it
would be better to cut the banks' losses and sell the airline
anyway.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump borrowed $380 million to pay for what was the
Eastern Shuttle last year. Under last month's $65 million
bank bailout, interest on $135 million of Mr. Trump's Shuttle
debt was suspended. Last week, Mr. Trump told his bankers
that soaring fuel costs and a declining northeast economy
would cause him to miss interest payments on the senior $245
million loan, as well.</p>
