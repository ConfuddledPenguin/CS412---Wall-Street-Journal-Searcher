	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Salomon Brothers Inc. said it raised $500
million for what it called a "low risk" fund that will seek
to profit from currency-rate changes as Europe moves toward
its 1992 unification.
   The securities firm's EMS Strategies Fund is Wall Street's
latest attempt to sell products that are geared toward the
unification of the 12-nation European Community in 1992.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Executives at the Salomon Inc. unit said they were
somewhat surprised to be able to raise $500 million from
institutional investors in the currently skittish markets.
(The money was raised privately over the past three months.)
But they explained that the EMS fund was marketed as a
conservative alternative to high-yield, high-risk
instruments, such as junk-bond funds, that have soured over
the past year.</p>
<p>The EMS fund, unlike typical currency funds that promise
yields of 25% to 30%, might not be able to return much more
than 9.5% because it won't be highly leveraged, Salomon
executives said. But clients are satisfied because it's a
"risk-averse world" right now, said Peter Taggart, the fund's
manager.</p>
<p>Rather than dealing in world-wide currencies, Salomon
said, it will buy and sell only the currencies of EMS
markets, as the European Community attempts to establish a
single currency. The fund can make money by trading
currencies that briefly move out of line with the intended
EMS target, Salomon said.</p>
<p>"The risk is laid off mostly to the central banks because
they are going to have to get the currencies in line as we
move to 1992," said Michael Holland, head of Salomon's
money-management unit, the fund's adviser, which manages more
than $6 billion.</p>
<p>The EMS fund's base will be a portfolio of short-term U.S.
government bonds.</p>
<p>Eventually, if all the European currencies are united, the
Salomon fund must be dissolved because opportunities to
profit from fluctuations won't exist. But no one expects the
EC to unify all the currencies in 1992. Salomon said that its
fund may not have to be wound down for four to six years.</p>
