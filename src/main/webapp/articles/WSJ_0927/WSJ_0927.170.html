	<p class="article-leader">McALLEN, Texas -- A federal bankruptcy judge refused to
force Greyhound Lines Inc. to turn over financial data to a
potential buy-out group that includes the striking
Amalgamated Transit Union.
   Judge Richard Schmidt also extended to Nov. 19 from Oct. 2
the time during which Greyhound has the exclusive right to
present a reorganization plan to creditors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The union was seeking to force the bus company to open its
books to Blackstone Group, a New York investment banking firm
that has joined the union in an effort to buy the company, as
a condition of the extension. Blackstone Group had told the
union that it needed the financial data to proceed with its
plans. Shelby Jordan, who represents the union, acknowledged
in court that the judge's decision could "really freeze"
Blackstone's efforts.</p>
<p>But Judge Schmidt said, "I don't think that that's a
proper way to do that." He pointed out that Blackstone or any
other potential suitor could obtain financial information
when Greyhound files its disclosure statements and
reorganization plan in November.</p>
<p>In another setback for the union, major bondholders in the
case supported Greyhound's stand against making the
disclosures to Blackstone. Both the union and the company
have been engaged in aggressive efforts to obtain
bondholders' support. Moreover, the bondholders succeeded in
getting three seats on the unsecured creditors' committee,
which had previously consisted of union representatives and
trade creditors. Lawyers involved in the case said that could
dilute union influence on the committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Jordan, the ATU lawyer, said the union intended to
file additional motions asking the judge to release the
financial information to Blackstone.</p>
