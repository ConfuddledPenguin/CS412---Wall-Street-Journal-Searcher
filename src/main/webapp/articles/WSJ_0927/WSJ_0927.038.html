	<p class="article-leader">AYN ZIWAN, Israeli-Occupied Golan Heights -- Officially,
Israel is still maintaining its low-profile policy in the
Persian Gulf crisis, and life on Tel Aviv and Jerusalem
streets continues as usual. But when Iraq's President Saddam
Hussein threatened last Sunday to attack Israel if economic
sanctions "strangle" Iraq, Israeli politicians and soldiers
here redoubled their efforts to prepare.
   The stepped-up pace is readily apparent in the Golan
Heights, the closest point to Iraq's forces. Any Iraqi
missile or aircraft intended to strike Israel would likely
fly overhead. And any attack by ground forces would involve
the thousands of Israeli troops here. "We have to be ready
for anything," says an Israeli lieutenant colonel, pointing
to the area on a map. "We are doing everything we would
normally be doing, but more of it."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Israeli armored patrol vehicles zoom by in a non-stop
stream. The crews are beefing up the Israeli tank and
artillery bases that dot the Golan Heights like gas stations
along a U.S. highway. Across the valley that forms the
no-man's land, Syrian military activity, possibly involving
units that could be sent to bolster the Gulf multinational
force, is picking up as well.</p>
<p>Military installations across Israel are increasing their
already-heightened level of alert based on Saddam Hussein's
latest threats. "After several weeks of quiet, his latest
threat was somewhat different. It got our attention," says an
Israeli military officer. Previously, Saddam Hussein
threatened to strike only if Iraq were attacked. In response,
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told Israel's
Parliament: "We are preparing to forestall the threat,
prevent it (and if he does attack) to retaliate."</p>
<p>Israeli officials confirm an increase in the number of
sorties flown by Israel's first line of defense, its F-15 and
F-16 fighter jets, since the Gulf crisis began. The air force
continues to bolster resources needed to fend off an Iraqi
air strike. Israel also has deployed an unspecified number of
its Hawk surface-to-air missile batteries along the Jordanian
border.</p>
<p>Groups from the Israeli Defense Force's 55,000 air force
reservists have been called up to help augment the military
buildup. And Defense Ministry officials have warned that the
additional use of fuel, engines and resources is going to add
roughly $500 million, or roughly 10%, to Israel's annual
military budget, analysts say. That is already translating
into calls for more U.S. military aid.</p>
<p>The Israelis have put military deployment off-limits to
foreign reporters recently, as they try to keep a low
profile. Israel and the U.S. think everyone's best interests
are served if Israel lies low.</p>
<p>Says Avi Pazner, adviser to Prime Minister Shamir: "We are
trying to stay out of this. It isn't a conflict with us, but
Saddam Hussein will try to do anything in order to drag us
in. We have to be prepared for the worst, but not do anything
to bring it about."</p>
<p>In coming weeks, it is likely to become clearer that
Israel faces a dilemma as it assesses its strategic options.
Because it doesn't want to anger the Arabs and jeopardize its
relations with America, it has limited military alternatives
to forestall Iraqi threats. However, Israel also realizes
that the deployment of the multinational force in the Gulf
offers an unprecedented opportunity to remove its current No.
1 enemy: Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>"Anything short of a major attempt to dismantle that
monster will leave the entire region, not just us, with a
major problem," says Joseph Alpher, deputy director of the
Jaffee Center for Stategic Studies at Tel Aviv University.
"Otherwise, we are sitting with a ticking time bomb."</p>
<p>And Israel may be tempted to strike first against Saddam
Hussein if months from now the Gulf crisis appears to be
headed toward a resolution that would leave Iraq's forces
intact and few U.S. troops around. Israel proved with its
attack on an Iraqi nuclear installation in 1981 that is
prepared to strike first to avoid a threat later. "The bets
would be off if they (the multinational force) went home,"
says Mr. Alpher.</p>
<p>Israeli military officials and analysts are concerned by
the threat of Iraq's missiles, but say these missiles pose
only a moderate threat. In order to reach Israel,
conventional warheads would have to weigh one ton or less --
enough to damage an office building, but not destroy it. Even
if the missiles have chemical warheads, Israeli officials
seem to think the damage could be limited to no more than a
thousand casualties.</p>
<p>"There is a limited military risk" from a missile attack
but a huge strategic risk that such a move would embroil
Israel in a shooting war, says Gerald M. Steinberg, a
strategic specialist at Israel's Bar Ilan University. Mr.
Steinberg says the Israelis hope America's Desert Shield will
extend to Israel; a U.S. interception of an Iraqi attack
could keep Israel out of the conflict.</p>
<p>Some Israeli military officials believe the U.S. would
know about a possible Iraqi attack even before Israel. Iraq's
liquidfueled rockets, which require as long as 24 hours to
prepare before launch, could be detected by U.S. spy
satellites and eliminated before they are fired.</p>
