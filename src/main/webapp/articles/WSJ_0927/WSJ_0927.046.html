	<p class="article-leader">EMERGENCY ROOM "shopping" grows as inner-city residents
seek suburban care.
   Faced with long waits in overburdened city hospitals, some
people with non-traumatic illness travel to cleaner, quieter
ERs nearby. "The word in the ghetto is if you get injured,
don't call an ambulance. Call a taxi; get a friend to take
you," says David Langness of the Hospital Council of Southern
California. Frequent "ER gridlock" in Los Angeles hospitals
makes carpetbagging notable there. "But it's beginning to be
a national trend," Mr. Langness says. In Dallas, where ER
visits can last 12 to 20 hours, some patients head for
suburban Richardson Medical Center.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But health-care economics keep many patients in cities
like New York, where ERs must accept all walk-ins regardless
of ability to pay. That puts budgets under pressure at a time
when government aid is sliding and use of the ER for routine
care is rising. One help: walk-in clinics, like the one at
Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. Open 16 hours a day,
the clinic relieves the ER of many patients. In New Jersey,
where hospitals bill a percentage of uncompensated costs to
paying patients, a recent report backs a "fast track" system
to speed minor cases through the ER.</p>
<p>Parkland Memorial's emergency room manages to collect only
about 17 cents of every dollar it's due.</p>
<p>"SEATTLE BEIGE," a recycled paint, helps win a creative
government award.</p>
<p>The Ford Foundation and Harvard University's 1990
Innovations in State and Local Government Awards include
Seattle's major recycling program; Iowa's efforts to save
family farms through better debt management; Ramsey County,
Minn.'s program to dispense welfare payments through
automated teller machines and the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey's Xport progam, which helps small companies to
export. The 10 awards, to be announced tomorrow, include
$100,000 grants.</p>
<p>The Seattle program was born of necessity in 1987, when
environmental problems forced closing the city's two
landfills. Facing sharply higher disposal costs, it launched
a sweeping, recycling program. Now it runs 16 services
ranging from routine paper and glass pickup to turning junk
mail into fiberboard. It sells "Seattle beige," a blend of
old paints, for $5 a gallon.</p>
<p>GO WEST and East, young draftsman. Architects look abroad
for projects.</p>
<p>While development languishes in many U.S. cities,
architects envision building in Asia, and Eastern Europe.
Joseph A. Gonzalez, design partner in Skidmore, Owings &
Merrill, Chicago, says his firm's business mix is about half
and half these days, compared with about 30% overseas and 70%
domestic five years ago. "In the next two to three years it
may flip over" with foreign work dominating, he says.
Skidmore, which put the Sears Tower and the John Hancock
Building on the map, points to Asia, notably Japan, Korea and
Indonesia.</p>
<p>New York architect Alan Lapidus sees a future in
renovating the Old Country. With European unification
unfolding, he figures that in four years or so, "we would
have one-third to half our business overseas." First: tourist
accommodations. "Europe is under-hoteled," says Mr. Lapidus.
There's business in gutting and re-doing the "old, quaint and
crummy" hotels along with tastefully adding technology to the
grand, old classics. Next: the convention hotel.</p>
<p>Poland's press agency reports 17 hotels on the drawing
board in Warsaw.</p>
<p>SADDAM THERMOSTAT] Home heating-oil bills may jump 50% to
60% this winter, a future issue of Barnard's Retail Marketing
Report says. Homeowners who paid $1,000 last winter may pay
$1,500 or $1,600.</p>
<p>CLASS NOTES OF '91: Boston University School of Law
reports that environmental law is the vogue -- class
registration soars 400% in six years; St. Lawrence University
in Canton, N.Y., sends parents audio cassettes describing
historic sites along the interstate heading to the rustic
campus; the University of Connecticut student credit union
offers bonus interest for A grades.</p>
<p>PARK, SHOP, WORK, SHOP. A $37 million, 15-story parking
garage with stores, child care and shuttle service for
downtown workers is planned for Los Angeles. The idea: unlock
gridlock.
</p>
<p>NOTHING VENTURED, nothing developed, big drug firms find.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies increasingly provide capital for
fledgling biotechnology firms. Of the 262 alliances arranged
by drug concerns last year, 200 were related to biotech
research companies, according to accountants Ernst & Young.
And, 75% of all biotechnology firms have an average of three
strategic partners -- mostly international pharmaceutical
firms.</p>
<p>"The size and experience of the big pharmaceutical
companies is helping partners better focus on goals and
stepping up their development," notes New York venture
capitalist Walter Channing. Marion Merrell Dow, Bristol-Myers
Squibb, Eli Lilly, and Glaxo Holdings PLC, top the list of
biotech allies who offer both cash and research support. Last
month, Glaxo invested $20 million in three-year old Gilead
Sciences, Foster City, Calif., to develop anti-cancer drugs.</p>
<p>Still, too much capital can discourage ventures by hurting
entrepreneurial incentive, Mr. Channing warns.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: Winners on the game show "The Challengers" can
take cash or credit on Citibank MasterCard or Visa accounts.
