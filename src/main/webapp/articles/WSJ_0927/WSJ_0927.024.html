	<p class="article-leader">Your Sept. 4 editorial "Salmon Survive Oil Spill" cites
this year's strong return of pink salmon to Prince William
Sound, Alaska, as conclusive evidence that last year's
massive oil spill by the tanker Exxon Valdez had little
impact on the area's salmon. Unfortunately, editorial writers
often reach conclusions that scientists wouldn't touch with a
10-foot pole.
   While the pink-salmon return is encouraging, the
scientists we talked to warned against drawing any
conclusions until more information is gathered. Those
scientists argued that we must first understand what role the
various parts of Prince William Sound's complex ecosystem
might have played in producing the large return.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For example, as televised news reports repeatedly showed,
the heavy crude oil killed vast numbers of sea birds and
marine mammals. It is these same populations of birds and
mammals that prey on salmon fry and smolts. Remove the
predators from the food chain and the prey flourish. Clearly,
if a greater number of juvenile salmon survive to adulthood,
then there are more adults to return to their spawning rivers
and streams.</p>
<p>Your editorial appropriately argues against "the politics
of hysteria." Even more destructive, however, are public
apathy and misplaced confidence that could result from
simplistic -- and perhaps incorrect -- conclusions.</p>

<p>You were factually so far off that I wonder what you were
thinking about. Salmon hatch way upriver, which was probably
not in water reached by the Exxon oil spill. And most salmon
stay out for more than a summer or even a year. Most of them
caught this year should have been out in the ocean when the
spill occurred. Although it is interesting that a large
number came back through the spill area after a good deal of
cleanup, the effect of the spill itself may not be gauged for
a few years, when the real Exxon salmon come back.
Nonetheless, your last paragraph was pretty much on the mark
-- as regards zero-risk environmentalists.</p>

<p>Your editorial will cause your "credibility among informed
people," to borrow your phrase, to suffer a setback.</p>
<p>The effect of last year's spill on the salmon population
will be most apparent in spring 1993, when the first of the
young fish subjected to the toxic environment should be
returning from their ocean sojourn. An uncertainty is
introduced here by the differing times certain salmon remain
in fresh water before transitioning to salt, so the effect
may show up sooner because the four-year cycle is roughly
common in all Pacific salmon. The question remains as to the
subsequent years' populations, and the long-term effect the
spill will have on young salmon making their way to the
ocean. Your article serves only to confirm the long-held
notion that maturing salmon, some of which are the four-year
fish making up the record 1990 harvest, spend the greater
part of their lives in the deep ocean, not in Prince William
Sound.</p>
<p>The damage done by the spill may not be irreversible, but
as an ardent salmon fisherman I have seen the results of
devastating practices on salmon populations, and I know how
long and difficult it can be to restore them. The
environmentalists are right in being upset.</p>

<p>Before you start crowing too loudly, you may wish to
consider the following: When drought or other high-stress
situations threaten the well-being of a pine tree, it
marshals all of its remaining energy to set a massive crop of
seed. This way, the endangered tree increases the odds that
at least its progeny will survive.</p>
<p>Nature is rife with similar examples. They are not the
acts of healthy species, but of endangered ones.</p>
