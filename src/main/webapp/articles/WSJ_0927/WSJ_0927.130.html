	<p class="article-leader">Hexcel Corp., citing cutbacks in orders from the military,
said it expects to report lower-than-anticipated
third-quarter net income.
   The Dublin, Calif., maker of composite materials said it
expects to be only "marginally profitable" in the quarter
ending Sunday, with net income far lower than analysts'
minimum estimates of about $1 million, or 15 cents a share.
Net in the year-ago period was $1.6 million, or 24 cents a
share, on sales of $97 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hexcel blamed the revised outlook on military cutbacks,
poor profit margins and difficulties in starting its
manufacture of aspartame, the artificial sweetener. European
business was also slugish, Hexcel said.</p>
<p>The company's shares closed at $8.25 a share yesterday,
down 62.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
