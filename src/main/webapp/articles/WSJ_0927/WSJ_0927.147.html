	<p class="article-leader">Crude oil futures rallied on a strong heating oil market
and on rising expectations of supply disruptions from a
Middle East war.
   After falling more than $1 a barrel early yesterday in
U.S. futures trading, crude oil for November delivery
rebounded in the afternoon to break briefly through the $39 a
barrel mark.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The November crude contract failed by 15 cents to reach
the previous futures high of $39.20 a barrel that had been
posted during trading only Monday. But it was up $1.14 for
the day to settle at $38.67 a barrel -- the highest ever for
the closing price of a so-called prompt-month crude on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>In London trading, Brent crude for November delivery also
staged an afternoon rally to a record futures high of $38.20
a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange. The
November Brent then pulled back some to settle at $37.95, up
85 cents for the day.</p>
<p>Oil analysts credited war talk, unfounded rumors and
speculation concerning the Middle East crisis for the crude
oil rebounds on both futures exchanges. Among the factors
cited were the extension of the United Nations embargo
against Iraq to shipments by air, Iraqi statements that this
move was an "act of war" and comments by U.S. government
officials of the increasing likelihood Saddam Hussein would
use military force to retaliate against the sanctions.</p>
<p>There were also rumors -- all denied -- that an Iraqi
plane had been shot down in the Persian Gulf and that
President Bush had issued Iraq a new ultimatum to abandon
Kuwait.</p>
<p>Crude oil is affected more than fuels, but all prices are
being pushed higher than supply-demand fundamentals justify
by the growing concern about a possible war in the Middle
East, oil analysts said.</p>
<p>"The war premium is around $15 a barrel," said George F.
Friesen, a New York-based vice president and energy analyst
with the Deutsche Bank Group. "Once this crisis is resolved,
oil prices will come down to the low twenties again," he
said.</p>
<p>Downward pressures could start as soon as today, prompted
by President Bush's authorization of the sale of oil from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve. While there are no actual
shortages of crude to justify drawing on government
stockpiles, the theory is that economic damage could be
reduced if oil prices are brought down from the artificially
high levels.</p>
<p>Fuels prices were mixed yesterday. Heating oil remained
strong on the New York Mercantile Exchange with the October
contract rising 1.37 cents to nearly $1.03 a gallon. But
gasoline was further weakened, as expected, by the latest
industry report of higher U.S. gasoline inventories, which
suggests a slackening in demand. The futures price of
unleaded gasoline for October delivery fell 1.95 cents,
although it managed to settle a notch above $1 a gallon.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures prices were strong but
platinum and silver weakened. December delivery gold was up
$5.20 an ounce at $412.80. October platinum dropped $3.80 an
ounce to end at $448.00, after trading as low as $440.00.
This is the first time that the October price has broken
below the critical $445.00 support level, which had held
since the beginning of 1988. December silver was off 4.2
cents an ounce at $4.8730. Gold continued to reflect Middle
Eastern tensions, according to William O'Neill, senior
futures strategist for Merrill Lynch. Also, he said, there
were rumors of a coup in the Soviet Union, which added to the
political unrest that has been the principal price-supporting
factor in gold. Meanwhile, platinum was weighed down by
slowing industrial demand as well as a lack of investor
demand for bullion, Mr. O'Neill said. "Platinum is being
affected most directly by the slumping automobile industry,
but a world-wide economic slowdown that has hit base metals
is also having its effect on platinum," he said. There is
little demand from Japan, where platinum is the favorite
precious metal, and platinum output has increased in South
Africa, the leading producer, he said. "While this platinum
isn't sold into futures directly, it is sold to dealers who
eventually hedge it in futures, and the effect of the sales
is felt," Mr. O'Neill said. The biggest disappointment among
traders, though, is that the platinum market has failed to
respond to the increasing violence in South Africa in recent
weeks, Mr. O'Neill said. While silver has lagged, too, it
hasn't been as weak as platinum, he said. "If gold posts a
strong gain and it succeeds in thrusting above, say, the key
$425 level, it could touch off a sharp rally in silver," he
said.</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Wheat futures prices are likely to
get some support this morning from export agreements
announced after the close of trading yesterday. The U.S. will
sell 1.2 million metric tons of wheat to Morocco under the
government's export bonus plan, and an additional 500,000
metric tons to west African countries, futures analysts said.
In relatively light trading yesterday, wheat and corn futures
prices were supported by continued rumors that an agreement
is in the works to sell flour or grain to the Soviet Union. A
meeting of Soviet grain trading officials in Washington with
U.S. officials is sparking the as-yet unfounded rumors,
traders said. Wheat futures for December delivery gained 1.75
cents a bushel to close at $2.7650. December corn futures
added 0.5 cent a bushel to close at $2.2825. Soybean futures
prices declined in response to warm weather across much of
the Midwest and prospects for an excellent harvest. November
soybeans slid two cents a bushel to close at $6.1550.</p>
<p>COPPER: A very strong price for the September contract,
which expired yesterday, highlighted futures trading; other
deliveries showed only slight price changes. The September
contract ended with a gain of 4.60 cents a pound at $1.3380,
after trading as high as $1.35. Active demand for contracts
developed because of the large number of outstanding
September contacts that remained to be nullified by opposite
trades or delivery of the commodity compared with limited
deliverable supplies, according to analysts. "First there was
the weight of liquidation in London last week, and then the
focus switched to the tight deliverable supplies for
September contracts and the high open interest," one analyst
said. "With the September expiration out of the way, traders
now will concentrate more on fundamental supply-demand
considerations," he said. The world-wide economic slowdown
that could result in reduced copper consumption is a major
factor, he said.</p>
<p>COCOA: Futures prices eased. The December contract was off
$14 a metric ton to $1,274. Gill & Duffus, a major London
cocoa trading company, made its first estimate of the world
cocoa crop for the 1990-91 season, which will begin Oct. 1.
The company projected output at 2.4 million tons, about
unchanged from the current season. Consumption, it said, will
amount to almost 2.3 million tons, up from 2.2 million tons
this season. As a result, the surplus next season will narrow
to about 130,000 tons from 187,000 tons this season. This
will be the seventh consecutive surplus, Gill & Duffus said.
Although a smaller surplus is predicted, "it is hard to get
excited about that, considering that global stocks of cocoa
amount to 1.5 million tons, the equivalent of about eight
months usage, even though we are heading into the peak
consumption season," said Judith Ganes, analyst for Merrill
Lynch.</p>
