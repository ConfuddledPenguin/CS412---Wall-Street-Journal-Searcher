	<p class="article-leader">Genetics Institute Inc., Cambridge, Mass., said it was
awarded a U.S. patent covering human Interleukin-3 type
products.
   The patent covers proteins produced using all or part of
the Interleukin-3 DNA sequence. Last November, Genetics
Institute received patents on the process of making
Interleukin-3 using recombinant DNA technology. Interleukin-3
type is a blood cell growth factor that stimulates certain
cells in the body's host defense system. The company believes
it may be useful in treating blood cell deficiencies
associated with cancer treatment, bone marrow transplantation
and certain other blood disorders. Sandoz Ltd. has licensed
certain manufacturing and marketing rights for Interleukin-3
from Genetics Institute and has begun clinical trials with
the drug.</p>
