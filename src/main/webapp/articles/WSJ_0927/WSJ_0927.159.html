	<p class="article-leader">Avery Inc. said it completed a merger agreement with its
two controlling shareholders and top officers under which
they will acquire the shares they don't already own for about
$4 million.
   The two are Nelson Peltz and Peter May, who own 83% of
Avery. Avery said the two will acquire the remaining 9.5
million shares at 43 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Avery said its directors approved the merger agreement
following the recommendation of a special committee appointed
to evaluate the proposal.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading, Avery shares were quoted
yesterday at a bid price of 31 cents a share.</p>
<p>Avery started out as a coal company in 1984. In 1986, it
bought Uniroyal Chemical Holding Co. from Uniroyal Inc. for
$710 million and financed the acquisition through $910
million of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. It then sold
Uniroyal Chemical to a management-led group last year in a
transaction valued at $800 million.</p>
<p>Avery, which continues to operate a coal company, said
last November that after fees and repayment of debt the
company was left with about $24 million in cash and
securities from the Uniroyal sale.</p>
<p>When the company completed the sale of Uniroyal Chemical
last year it also completed a recapitalization in which
Messrs. Peltz and May surrendered warrants and preferred
stock in exchange for a larger stake in Avery's common
shares.</p>
