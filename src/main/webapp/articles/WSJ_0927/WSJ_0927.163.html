	<p class="article-leader">QUITMAN, Ark. -- Even boy wonders eventually turn
gray-haired and fortysomething.
   It's happened to Gov. Bill Clinton. Graying and 44, he's a
dozen years past those precocious days when he was the
nation's youngest governor and already being measured as
presidential timber. But if he's experiencing a midlife
crisis, he's confronting it with humor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I'm not hung up on being a boy wonder anymore," he grins.
"I'm lunging into middle age."</p>
<p>Bill Clinton also is lunging into the home stretch of a
difficult re-election campaign, one whose outcome could
rejuvenate -- or end -- his political career. He's bidding
for a fifth term and 14 years in the statehouse, which would
be an Arkansas record. Beyond that, he hasn't abandoned his
presidential hopes.</p>
<p>"Shoot, no," he says between campaign stops here on the
edge of the Ozarks. "I'd like to serve another term and run."</p>
<p>Another term would give Mr. Clinton, who combines a Rhodes
scholar intellect with an innately Southern gift of gab, an
opportunity to consolidate his state reforms and burnish a
faded national image. He's still living down a long-winded
1988 Democratic National Convention speech that, like some
runaway wagon, rolled right over frantic attempts by
convention officials to bring it to a close. Here at home, a
rebellious legislature has shredded key Clinton proposals,
including income-tax revision. The rejection of that
initiative, in turn, discouraged the governor from pushing an
education package, which would have raised teacher salaries.
But this year's Democratic primaries toppled some of the
governor's most stubborn legislative foes, bettering the odds
for new Clinton initiatives.</p>
<p>First, though, Mr. Clinton must get himself re-elected in
this traditionally rough-and-tumble state. (A "continual
succession of gentle, fertile, wooded scenery . . .
everything peaceful but man," author Washington Irving summed
up Arkansas in the 19th century.) Gov. Clinton's opponent is
Sheffield Nelson, a Democrat-turned-Republican who's the
former chief executive officer of Arkla Inc., owner of
Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Co. Mr. Nelson, 49, minces few words
in describing the governor as a man who has worn out his
welcome.</p>
<p>"Bill Clinton would rather climb a tree to tell you a lie
than stand on the ground and tell you the truth," says Mr.
Nelson. "The only reason he's running for governor is to
maintain a foothold on the White House. I think this election
alone will prove that Bill Clinton is not presidential
timber."</p>
<p>Billboards along the highways hammer home Mr. Nelson's
central theme: "Ten Years is Enough]]" Mr. Clinton was first
elected to a two-year term in 1978, lost his 1980 re-election
bid, then came back to win in 1982, 1984 and 1986, when
Arkansas went to a four-year term. Gov. Clinton acknowledges
that countering the billboard theme is his biggest problem.</p>
<p>The crux of his problem, says Mr. Clinton, is that polls
show that better than 60% of the voters like his performance
-- but more than 50% of the voters also agree with the
billboard. "I'm taking about a six to eight {percentage}
point hit on the tenure argument," he says. "In theory, if
everybody woke up in a bad mood on election day, I could get
46%. If everybody woke up in a good mood, I could get 60%."</p>
<p>Challenger Nelson is running straight at Mr. Clinton's
proudest boast, his claim to have been an "education
governor." He was the nation's first governor to impose
teacher-competency tests and has been in the forefront of the
effort to bring computers into classrooms. But Mr. Nelson
notes that Arkansas teacher salaries, always low, have
slipped to 50th in the nation, from 45th, during Mr.
Clinton's present term. Meanwhile, he says, per-capita income
in this chronically poor state was 48th in 1989, up only one
notch from 49th a decade earlier.</p>
<p>"People do not understand how he could have more than
doubled the state budget and not solved state problems," Mr.
Nelson maintains. Gov. Clinton, arguing that many problems
have been solved, parries the attack with everything from
old-time religion to self-deprecating humor.</p>
<p>"You know what the Bible says: We all have problems until
we're brought Home," he tells a solemnly nodding audience in
the courthouse square of Clinton, Ark. It is an almost 19th
century campaign scene -- the governor, holding forth beneath
an elm in front of the modest stone courthouse, quoting the
Bible to a gathering that includes old men with sunburned
arms, string ties and straw hats.</p>
<p>Bantering with another audience, he tells the
perhaps-apocryphal story of an elderly man he encountered on
a campaign stop.</p>
<p>"I'm going to vote for you," the man announced.</p>
<p>"I was afraid you might be tired of me by now," Mr.
Clinton responded.</p>
<p>"No, but everybody else I know is," the man replied.</p>
<p>Mr. Nelson, an earnest and less-colorful man, has campaign
liabilities of his own. He emerged the winner of a bitter,
name-calling Republican primary contest with the flamboyant
U.S. Rep. Tommy Robinson. The wounds haven't fully healed,
nor are they likely to. Mr. Nelson, who backed Sen. Edward
Kennedy's challenge to President Jimmy Carter in 1980, is
portrayed by Mr. Clinton as a political opportunist. And,
with Gov. Clinton's encouragement, the state Public Service
Commission has reopened a question that dogged Mr. Nelson
during the GOP primary -- whether he, as Arkla's top
executive, asked too little in selling an interest in
undeveloped oil and gas leases in 1983. Arkla wound up buying
back the leases at nearly 15 times the original price,
possibly affecting Arkansas utility customers.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, this election is a referendum on Mr.
Clinton. "The 10-years-is-enough argument is a good argument,
if you can point to abuse of power, or corruption, or loss of
energy and ideas," he contends. "None of those things have
happened with me." He sprinkles his speeches with proposals
for the future -- new highways, a state-assisted
apprenticeship program to train skilled workers, an expanded
"boot camp" prison program for nonviolent first offenders.</p>
<p>And Gov. Clinton candidly acknowledges that he's giving
some thought to the presidential election year of 1996. He
now chairs the Democratic Leadership Council, a national
group trying to wrench his party back toward the center of
the political spectrum, and says the Democrats need a
candidate who'll do the same thing.</p>
<p>He says he came close to declaring for president in 1987.
"You wonder, when you pass up a deal like that, whether
you'll ever get one again," he says. But he ventures that
"the average political person reaches his or her peak at age
50." If true, that would find Bill Clinton peaking just in
time for 1996.</p>
