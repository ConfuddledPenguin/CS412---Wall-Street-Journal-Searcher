	<p class="article-leader">American Telephone & Telegraph Co. is offering midsized
companies access to private international voice and data
communications networks previously available only to the
largest firms.
   Separately, the US Sprint Communications Co. unit of
United Telecommunications Inc., Westwood, Kan., plans to
market a service by which customers can link local area
networks at many locations for data transmission through a
single access facility.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Currently, a company must use a number of leased private
lines and a number of access facilities to gain the same
capability for LANs, which are groups of PCs that can share
files and communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Both telecommunications companies made the announcements
at the Tele-Communications Association trade show in San
Diego.</p>
<p>AT&T, New York, and five foreign telecommunications
companies are linking their capabilities to provide the
expanded private-network service, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>A private network allows a company to design its own
dialing plan. On such a network, phone calls and data
transmissions connect faster because they bypass the local
phone-company switches that they normally follow.</p>
<p>Currently, only the biggest companies can afford totally
private networks, in which AT&T provides the companies with
private lines for unlimited transmissions at all times.</p>
<p>A spokesman explained that AT&T now is tailoring plans for
smaller companies to use such private lines only when they
need them, so-called virtual private networks. Pricing on
these private lines is lower than simply placing a
long-distance call through AT&T's regular lines, the
spokesman said.</p>
