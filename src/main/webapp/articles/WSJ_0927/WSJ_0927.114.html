	<p class="article-leader">Thomson McKinnon Inc., which is operating under
bankruptcy-law protection, said it is considering another bid
for its interest in an asset-managing partnership.
   New York-based Thomson, parent of Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc., said it was granted an adjournment by a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court to consider a new bid of $33 million by
Manufacturers Life Insurance Co., Toronto, for Thomson
Advisory Group L.P., formerly Thomson McKinnon Asset
Management L.P., and its affiliated distributor. The
partnership manages nine mutual funds and is an investment
adviser to private accounts; it had more than $7 billion of
assets under management as of June 30. The court hearing had
been called to consider an earlier bid for the interest by
Thomson Advisory Group Inc., formed by a Thomson management
group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thomson McKinnon Securities sold its branch office system
last year, and has been liquidating since July 1989. It and
the parent are both protected from creditors' lawsuits under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</p>
