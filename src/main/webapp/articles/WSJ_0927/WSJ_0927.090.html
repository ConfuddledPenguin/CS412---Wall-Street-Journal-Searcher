	<p class="article-leader">We have a constructive suggestion for the budget summit
negotiators now deadlocked out at that converted bar at
Andrews Air Force Base: a change of venue. They should pick
up their talks and move them 100 miles down the road to
Richmond, Virginia. They can then call in Democratic Governor
L. Douglas Wilder and have him explain how he is coping with
his state's budget deficit without any tax increases.
   Governor Wilder became the nation's first black governor
in January after a campaign in which he promised economy in
government along with "no new taxes -- and I mean it." The
slowdown in Virginia's economy has put his promise to the
test. The state faces an unexpected $1.4 billion deficit out
of a $26 billion budget.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Wilder has risen to the challenge. He says new taxes
would only damage the state's long-term ability to create
jobs and expand economic opportunity to the poor. Instead, he
proposes to do what private businesses do every day -- trim
back on labor costs and cut expenditures to make limited
means and infinite ends meet.</p>
<p>In a remarkable speech last month, Governor Wilder said he
will insist that the state follow some common-sense budget
principles: 1) "You spend your money wisely -- first on the
necessities of life, and then -- and only then -- on the
niceties." 2) "In the event of financial difficulty, you
tighten your belt." And 3) "You act responsibly, and you
don't spend beyond your means."</p>
<p>Governor Wilder's plan calls for the state to balance its
budget by cutting 5.3% from projected state spending, or
about $1.4 billion. Even with the cuts, state spending still
will increase by 7.6% over the last budget. Larry Hunter,
deputy chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
calls the Wilder plan "a combination of vision and
practicality that few in Washington seem capable of."</p>
<p>Governor Wilder says his plan shouldn't surprise anyone.
It is taken from his campaign speeches in which he said the
state should "keep taxes down, and if at all possible, secure
tax cuts." The fact that state government grew 10% a year
during the 1980s means that Virginia now will have to "make
permanent, not temporary adjustments in its spending
patterns."</p>
<p>Among these "adjustments" is a cut of $375 million in
state agencies. Spending on the poor and sick will be spared,
but other state agencies will have to rein in their
ambitions. A top target will be cuts in the central
bureaucracy running the state's educational system. With many
states doing business by mail and fax, the number of state
field offices will be frozen. A program in which driver's
license issuers visited rural residents in their homes will
end. The Department of World Trade, the Council on the Status
of Women, and the Council on Indians will have their
functions transferred to other agencies.</p>
<p>There will be other savings. State employees will forgo a
pay raise next year. Some 1,100 state employees will be laid
off, but that number could be reduced by repealing a law
barring early retirement programs for state workers. Governor
Wilder also wants to encourage the privatization of such
government services as road-building. He has been an
enthusiastic backer of a proposed 18-mile private toll road
near Dulles Airport.</p>
<p>If Congress and the White House could bring themselves to
make the same level of cuts as the Wilder plan does, federal
spending for fiscal 1991 would be reduced by more than $72
billion. That's the lion's share of the $85 billion in cuts
required by the Gramm-Rudman sequester, and would still mean
that federal spending would grow by $19 billion over the 1990
budget. The remaining $12 billion or so in needed budget cuts
could be made up with the capital-gains tax cut.</p>
<p>Virginia Republicans say Governor Wilder is only holding
firm on taxes because he is running for a spot on the 1992
Democratic ticket. His record as a moderate makes that, at
best, a partial explanation. Even if true, it simply means
Governor Wilder has recognized that the public is fed up with
politics as usual and with incumbent officeholders who
promise to make tough choices but raise taxes instead. If his
common-sense fiscal approach succeeds it will be a lesson to
more timid politicians in both parties that putting the
bureaucracy on a diet makes for better government and smart
politics.</p>
