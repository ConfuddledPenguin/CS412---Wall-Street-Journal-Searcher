	<p class="article-leader">J2 Communications, an entertainment concern, said it
modified slightly its $4.7 million offer to acquire National
Lampoon Inc.
   Under terms of the original and the revised offers,
shareholders of the New York-based humor magazine would
receive two-thirds of a share of J2 common stock plus a
warrant for each share of Lampoon currently held. The revised
offer lowered the exercise price of the warrant to $3.25 a
share from $3.75 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The modification reflects a minor change in the relative
value of the two companies' stocks since the agreement was
reached in March, J2 said. National Lampoon's shares have
fallen to $1.75 bid from $3.125 bid in over-the-counter
trading. J2's shares have dropped to $1.875 bid from $3 bid.</p>
<p>Shareholders of both companies will vote on the
transaction at meetings set for Oct. 24 in Los Angeles.</p>
