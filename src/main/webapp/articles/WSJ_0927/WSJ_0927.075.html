	<p class="article-leader">Bear Stearns Cos. and other Wall Street takeover-stock
speculators are trying to use an obscure provision of
Delaware law to derail the proposed merger of insurance
brokers Corroon & Black Corp. and Willis Faber PLC of London.
   The takeover-stock speculators, known as arbitragers, are
upset because Corroon & Black rejected a $40-a-share cash
offer from Aon Corp. and intends to complete a stock-swap
merger with Willis Faber that currently is valued at about
$30.64 a share, or about $628.1 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"What they've done is wrong," says Robert Steinberg, a
senior managing director of Bear Stearns and co-head of its
arbitrage operation, referring to Corroon's rejection of the
Aon offer. "It's a terrible precedent," says Mr. Steinberg.</p>
<p>But rather than simply selling the Corroon shares that
Bear Stearns owns, an approach Mr. Steinberg rejects as
"cowardly," the firm intends to seek an appraisal of the
value of Corroon shares in Delaware state court, a lengthy
procedure that sometimes yields a higher cash payment for
shares of a company involved in a merger.</p>
<p>Mr. Steinberg declined to specify how many Corroon shares
Bear Stearns owns, but said the holding is "substantial." He
said Bear Stearns has sought appraisal rights in other merger
situations, which he declined to identify.</p>
<p>In the case of the proposed Corroon-Willis Faber merger,
the issue of appraisal rights takes on added significance
because Willis Faber has reserved the right to walk away from
the deal if more than 9% of Corroon's shareholders file for
appraisal rights.</p>
<p>Willis Faber could decide to complete the merger even if
more than 9% of Corroon's holders seek appraisal rights. But
if a significantly larger number of Corroon's holders seek
cash payment through the appraisal procedure, the proposed
tax-free treatment of the stock swap deal could be
endangered. It isn't clear exactly how many shareholders
could dissent without dooming a tax-free treatment.</p>
<p>Robert Coffey, Corroon & Black secretary, said the company
has received several appraisal requests from shareholders,
but he declined to say just how many the company has received
so far. He said the requests so far wouldn't block the
merger. "The notices are limited enough that we have
confidence in our ability to consummate the transaction," Mr.
Coffey said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Willis Faber declined to say what Willis
Faber will do if more than 9% of Corroon's holders seek
appraisal rights. "There is quite a lot of noise being made
about this at the moment," the spokesman said. "I think at
this stage we regard it as a rather hypothetical issue of the
moment . . . "</p>
<p>Currently, other arbitragers don't hold out much hope that
the Corroon merger with Willis Faber will be blocked. Corroon
shares closed yesterday at $30 a share, up 37.5 cents in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns and other arbitragers are using the
appraisal-rights method of protesting the Corroon-Willis
Faber merger because they can't vote against the merger at a
Corroon shareholders meeting now scheduled for Oct. 4. Most
arbitragers bought their Corroon shares after Aon made its
proposal on Sept. 12, long after the Aug. 24 record date for
the Corroon holders meeting.</p>
<p>To seek appraisal rights, shareholders must own their
shares at the time of the meeting and hold them until the
effective date of the merger. They also cannot vote in favor
of the merger.</p>
<p>Bear Stearns, which sent out a report to its clients on
the Corroon merger earlier this week, argues that there's
little risk to seeking appraisal rights in this situation.
Holders can change their minds -- and take the Willis Faber
stock swap -- for as long as 60 days after the effective date
of the merger. And Bear Stearns argues that the $40 a share
cash proposal from Aon will serve as powerful evidence that a
higher price for Corroon shares is justified.</p>
<p>The 9% limit on shareholders seeking appraisal rights was
significant under the original Corroon-Willis Faber merger
plan because a larger amount of dissenting shareholders would
kill an accounting treatment that the companies desired. But
Corroon's decision this week to pay a $2.50 a share special
dividend if the merger is approved has already doomed that
accounting treatment.</p>
<p>Separately, two class-action shareholder lawsuits have
been filed against Corroon and its board since the company
rejected Aon's offer last week.</p>
<p>Both lawsuits claim that by rejecting Aon's offer to
negotiate, Corroon breached its fiduciary duty to the
company's shareholders. The suit also alleges that since the
Aon offer was made after the proxy material was distributed
to shareholders, "they are victims of unfair dealing and
coercion" because they would be voting on the Willis Faber
merger without enough information.</p>
<p>Corroon officials declined to comment on the lawsuits.</p>
