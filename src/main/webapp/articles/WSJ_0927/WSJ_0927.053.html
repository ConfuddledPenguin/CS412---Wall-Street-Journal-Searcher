	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Mideast crisis has sabotaged one of Wall
Street's biggest moneymakers.
   The market for new stock issues, which had been one of the
hottest areas in the securities business before August, has
slowed to a trickle since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
Previously, Wall Street firms had earned fat fees by buying
new stock from corporate issuers and reselling them to the
public.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The volume of new stock offerings has plunged 48%, to $3.2
billion thus far this quarter from $6.1 billion in the third
quarter of 1989. Initial public stock offerings have taken it
on the chin even harder, dropping 59% from the year earlier.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: Economic uncertainty triggered by
skyrocketing oil prices has whacked the stock market, which
has fallen 18% from its record level shortly before the
invasion. Many corporations looking to sell stock therefore
are hanging back, hoping for higher prices when the dust
settles.</p>
<p>"The uncertainty emanating from the Iraqi Mideast crisis
has caused gridlock in the equity marketplace," says Michael
Madden, co-head of investment banking at Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>The pullback in stock issues has hit Wall Street where it
hurts. Wall Street firms typically get fatter fees for
underwriting stock issues than for debt. So far this year,
according to Securities Data Co., investment banks have
earned an average fee of $2.7 million for underwriting stock
issues, and $3 million for each IPO -- far higher than the
$1.1 million average for corporate debt offerings.</p>
<p>"This had been one of the few areas that produced the kind
of returns on capital you need in this business," said T.
Anthony Brooks, a managing director of First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>Since the Iraqi invasion, 22 stock issues have been
postponed, while 34 have come to market, Securities Data
says. On Aug. 24, for instance, Sun Microsystems Inc. pulled
an offering of 7 million shares, or $217 million, after its
stock price sank from $31 to $25.375 a share. Sun chairman
Scott McNealy explained that market conditions "clearly have
deteriorated."</p>
<p>A week after the invasion, May Department Stores Inc.
yanked a $34 million stock issue for its Venture Stores Inc.
unit, citing "market conditions." Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. shelved plans to sell shares in two $60 million funds
investing, respectively, in Spain and New Zealand. And last
week, King World Productions Inc. withdrew a $36 million
stock offering tied to a program development unit.</p>
<p>There are other reasons that new stock offerings have
slowed. Wall Street executives say investors want to avoid
the shares of companies burdened by heavy debt loads, at a
time when scores of leveraged companies have developed
financial problems. Before the Mideast crisis, when the
market was still riding high, some companies that had
undergone leveraged buy-outs sold stock to the public in
socalled reverse LBOs. "Investors are getting particularly
concerned about credit quality," says Clayton Rhorbach, head
of equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley & Co.</p>
<p>With oil prices soaring, investors still have an appetite
for stock issues related to the energy business. Salomon
Brothers Inc. last week led a $41 million stock offering for
Grant Norpac, an energy exploration services company. And
Orex Energy Co. plans to sell 7.3 million shares currently
owned by charitable trusts, worth about $333 million.</p>
<p>Nearly one-third of all new stock issues this quarter have
been by companies in oil and natural resources, according to
Securities Data. Gold stocks, in particular, have gained from
oil-related inflation fears.</p>
<p>Thomas Pratt, contributing editor of the IPO Reporter
newsletter, says that September shapes up as the slowest
month for new stock issues since November 1987, the month
that followed the stock market crash.</p>
<p>And don't look for the picture to brighten any time soon.
The volume of new stock issues probably won't pick up until
the outlook for the economy and the outcome in the Mideast
become clearer.</p>
<p>"The markets abhor uncertainty, and whatever you believe
about the Mideast, it's certainly uncertain, and therefore
the markets aren't receptive," says Denis Bovin, a managing
director at Salomon Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>Wall Street is still holding out hope for the long term,
however, banking on the expected need for new equity by many
debt-burdened companies. But for now, Morgan Stanley's Mr.
Rohrbach says business remains slow.</p>
<p>"Every morning my staff brings me a Street-wide offering
calendar, a sheet with all the deals announced, deals priced,
and their performance in the secondary market," he says.
"These days the sheet is almost empty."</p>
