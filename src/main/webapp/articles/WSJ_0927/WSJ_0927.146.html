	<p class="article-leader">Generale d'Electricite said profit after payments to
minority interests was 1.98 billion French francs ($376.3
million) for the first half of the year, down 24% from 2.59
billion francs in the year-earlier period.
   The French electricity and telecommunications group noted
that profit in the year-ago period reflected heavy
exceptional gains related to the creation of GECAlsthom S.A.,
a joint venture with General Electric PLC. General Electric
PLC is not related to General Electric Co. of the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue rose 2% to 68.55 billion francs from 67.17 billion
francs.</p>
<p>The company said it expects full-year net profit on a
comparable basis to continue to grow at the same pace as in
1989, despite economic uncertainties linked to higher oil
prices.</p>
