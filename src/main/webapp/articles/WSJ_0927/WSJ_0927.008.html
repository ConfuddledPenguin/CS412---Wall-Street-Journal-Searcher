	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- Shares of Rodamco N.V., a $4.5 billion
international property investment fund, sank 18% to 60
guilders ($33.86) on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange.
   A plunge in the stock price had been expected, in light of
a surprise announcement from the Rotterdam-based company
Monday that it was suspending its practice of purchasing its
own shares at book value. Trading in Rodamco was suspended
Monday and Tuesday, to give investors time to digest the
news. On Friday, Rodamco shares closed at 73.30 guilders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The policy change at Rodamco, one of the major funds in
the Robeco Group, means that it is no longer an open-end fund
-- one that issues new shares or redeems old ones in line
with market demand, keeping the price near the underlying
asset value. Shareholders who want to get out of the fund now
must accept the prevailing stock price.</p>
<p>Rodamco said an outflow of funds this year, amounting to
more than 20% of the total, had forced it to suspend
repurchases in the interests of shareholders. Otherwise, it
would have had to borrow heavily or sell properties to pay
for redemptions.</p>
<p>Robeco Group continues to repurchase shares in its Robeco
and Rolinco equity funds, as well as in its Rorento bond
fund. A spokesman said it was "very unlikely" that the
company would switch the policy for those funds.</p>
