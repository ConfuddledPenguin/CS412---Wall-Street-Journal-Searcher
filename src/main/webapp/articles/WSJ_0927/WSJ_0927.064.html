	<p class="article-leader">The Securities and Exchange Commission is shaking up the
world of accounting.
   The overhaul, so far, is a sedate one in a notoriously
sedate field. But it could radically change companies'
financial reports, and so the way companies are evaluated by
investors. Even small variations in accounting can translate
into big changes in stock prices, and some of the
contemplated rule changes aren't small.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This isn't evolutionary, it's revolutionary," comments
Christopher J. Steffen, chief financial officer at Honeywell
Inc.</p>
<p>Right now, the SEC is focusing solely on debt securities
and certain types of loans held by banks and other financial
institutions. Next to be affected will probably be other
companies with significant financial assets. Finally, much of
corporate America, ranging from General Motors to a Silicon
Valley start-up, may feel pressure to revise the way it
accounts for assets.</p>
<p>Although no one is suggesting that the SEC will revamp
financial statements altogether, it wants to force companies
to go a long way toward putting up-to-date values on assets
currently on their books at historical cost -- the original
purchase price. It has launched a campaign in Congress and
with the accounting profession to get fast action.</p>
<p>"If accounting standards aren't adequate to give an
accurate picture of a firm's condition, they're not doing the
job they need to do," says SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden.</p>
<p>The agency's focus on accounting is another indication of
its renewed scrutiny of corporate America, and its shift away
from targeting Wall Street stock-trading abuses. The SEC
recently adopted rules making it easier for companies to sell
debt directly to large institutions and is awaiting
congressional approval to toughen enforcement against
wrongdoing by corporate officials.</p>
<p>Sweeping changes in corporate accounting won't come
easily. Many companies oppose, and are lobbying against, any
change that could raise costs, skew numbers or reduce
reported profits. Banks especially are leery of any change
that could make their balance sheets look worse. And SEC
officials themselves are wary of doing anything that might
make U.S. companies less competitive with foreign rivals, or
trigger, through accounting advantages, foreign takeovers of
U.S. companies.</p>
<p>The SEC's chiefs aren't unanimous about how far they want
to go. "I'd be happy just to have small changes," says
Commissioner Philip Lochner Jr., who heads the agency's
accounting project. But Mr. Breeden, who increasingly
dominates the commission, seems determined to go forward with
significant changes.</p>
<p>Although most of this work of revision has been going on
behind closed doors, Mr. Breeden recently went public with
his first target. Testifying before the Senate Banking
Committee, he said he wants to force banks and other
financial companies to alter the way they account for bonds
and other securities held for investment.</p>
<p>Under federal law, the SEC has the mandate to determine
accounting principles for publicly traded companies. But it
has generally ceded that authority to private-sector
accounting bodies such as the Financial Accounting Standards
Board.</p>
<p>Should the SEC decide to change the rules, it has a lot of
weapons at its disposal besides just pressuring accounting
bodies. For example, it has the power simply to change
accounting rules by voting a rule proposal at an open
meeting. After a period for public comment, the commission
could pass a final rule. Alternatively, the agency can issue
interpretative releases, telling public companies and the
accounting industry how it reads a specific rule and that
they should abide by that reading.</p>
<p>Under today's standards, financial companies -- banks,
thrifts and insurance concerns -- holding stacks of
investment securities can make their own judgments on whether
to use historical accounting or current, "market" standards.
"Financial-institution balance sheets should have the words
`once upon a time' on top of them," Mr. Breeden says
scornfully. "They are a statement of history." Under the SEC
plan, recently rejected by an industry accounting panel, only
current values of a financial company's securities would be
listed on the balance sheet and reflected in quarterly
profit-and-loss statements.</p>
<p>Some financial concerns already are sharpening their
pencils to current accounting and stepping away from
historical levels. Rouse Co., a real-estate developer based
in Columbia, Md., which began the switch in 1976, shows the
differences on the balance sheet in its annual report. At
year-end 1989, for example, the company's assets, largely
land and buildings, totaled $4.13 billion, nearly $2 billion
more than the assets would reflect on a cost basis. (The
company does the same on the liabilities side of the ledger.)</p>
<p>"Initially, it came about as a result of the SEC
requesting that companies do replacement cost accounting,"
says David Tripp, Rouse's director of investor relations.
Rather than trying to estimate what it would cost to build a
new project, Rouse values its assets on what it would cost to
replace the income stream from them.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Mr. Tripp notes, the company's stock has
tended to trade much closer to the value achieved by the
current-cost model. At the end of 1989, based on historical
cost, Rouse had shareholder equity of $52.9 million, or
roughly $1.11 a share, Mr. Tripp says. But under the
current-value model, shareholder equity was $1.73 billion, or
about $34.80 a share. Only recently, with the real-estate
slump, has the stock been trading at a deep discount to
current value, Mr. Tripp says.</p>
<p>But James W. Otto, chief financial officer of Ameritrust
Corp., a Cleveland-based banking company, says marking assets
to current value "would be a very significant and costly
effort that wouldn't be useful. . . . It's an estimation of
the liquidation value of a company that is totally irrelevant
to a going concern."</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Otto adds, "A majority of the assets and
liabilities don't have a ready market." Therefore, he argues,
"some very subjective assumptions" would be needed to arrive
at current values for those assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>At the root of SEC's new zeal are lessons drawn from the
thrift crisis. Mr. Breeden cites 1978 numbers that show the
thrift industry with a positive net worth. But a harder look
-- using current instead of historical accounting -- shows
that the industry was already ailing, with a negative net
worth of as much as $118 billion.</p>
<p>The SEC worries that the banking industry could slip into
a similar situation, with trouble disguised by accounting
anomalies. Many accounting-industry officials agree. "We need
to get accounting changes that reflect what has happened,"
says Arthur R. Wyatt, a principal of Arthur Andersen and the
head of the International Accounting Standards Committee.
"It's real, and it should be reported."</p>
<p>The banking industry itself thinks that the SEC's push is
off-base. "You wouldn't want anything that would cause
portfolio managers to make business decisions based on
accounting rather than economic impacts," contends Roger
Trupin, a Citicorp representative to the big-business
accounting task force. And Dennis R. Beresford, FASB
chairman, adds that banks ask why they should have to mark
their assets at current prices without manufacturers having
to do that with inventories.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, the SEC's mission has taken on a
new urgency. Accounting rule makers who pride themselves on
the stately pace of the standard-setting process are shocked
by what they see as a government-inspired stampede. SEC
staffers are calling up the standard setters, who are
accustomed to taking months and years to deliberate on a
single issue, and demanding results now. And in a striking
departure, the SEC is not only dictating the timetable but
also letting rule makers know what answers it wants.</p>
<p>Although the commission traditionally has relied heavily
on the private sector to write accounting standards, the FASB
often has been chided by business for taking too long to make
rules and for making them too complicated. Indeed, the FASB
is still working on a project, begun in 1986, on how to
handle financial instruments.</p>
<p>"I don't think {Mr. Breeden} has to jam through" more
current accounting standards, says Pat McConnell, a Bear,
Stearns & Co. managing director who heads an analysts'
accounting panel. "The FASB is scared to death."</p>
<p>Observers cite the way the SEC handled an
accounting-standards group's vote on the bank-debt question.
Just minutes before the Accounting Standards Executive
Committee was to debate the proposal, it was given a copy of
Mr. Breeden's previously delivered Senate testimony by an SEC
staffer -- a none-too-subtle reminder of the agency's stance.
Then, the day of the vote, the committee got a letter from
Edmund Coulson, the SEC's chief accountant, decrying
newspaper reports that the panel planned to soften proposed
tough new standards in the face of industry pressure.</p>
<p>Still, the committee voted to introduce standards less
restrictive than the SEC wanted. Stepping up the pressure,
Mr. Breeden and Mr. Coulson have set up a meeting with the
panel's chairman, the FASB and others next Tuesday. Although
the SEC isn't assured of victory, tougher standards for banks
seem in the cards.</p>
<p>That has the rest of corporate America wondering whether
it's next. One prominent corporate treasurer, Chrysler
Corp.'s Frederick Zuckerman, thinks that major companies
wouldn't have much problem switching accounting of liquid
assets to a current, market measure. "We all know what our
assets are worth," he says. But, he adds, trying to determine
the value of, say, inventory "is a bag of snakes."</p>
<p>John Robbins, a managing partner at accounting firm
Kenneth Leventhal & Co., says, "You can do it on debt, you
can do it on something that trades. But what's the value of a
widget plant?"</p>
<p>A major advantage of historical-cost accounting, he
argues, is that value is determined by competing interests --
a buyer and a seller agreeing on a price. Relying on a
company's current valuation requires appraisals. "There's
only one danger with doing an appraisal: Believing it," he
says. The wild real-estate appraisals emerging from the
devastated thrift industry have increased that anxiety.</p>
<p>But that hasn't stopped some companies from relying more
heavily on internal systems of current accounting. "We may
not be accurate in our current cost estimates," says David G.
Harmer, FMC Corp.'s comptroller, "but we're a hell of a lot
closer than erroneous historical-cost basis. We know {those}
are understated."</p>
<p>The Chicago-based industrial conglomerate could end up
working as a model for future accounting rules. It unveiled a
cost-based accounting system in the early 1980s, when its
managers wanted a better gauge of how their various
businesses -- defense equipment, food machinery, agricultural
chemicals, petroleum equipment -- were performing. FMC's
managers struggled to decide where to invest resources.</p>
<p>As division managers worried about being held to unfairly
high standards, FMC set about valuing all the assets in its
units, using appraisals where necessary. Corporate computer
people rejiggered FMC's internal accounting so that the value
of plant and equipment could be updated by inflation indexes.
(It permits financial officials to strip out current costs to
get historical numbers for SEC-required data.)</p>
<p>"It helps you focus on what your real performance is," Mr.
Harmer says.</p>
<p>There's a bonus, too. Division managers are more likely to
update obsolete equipment with more efficient technology if
they know that the old equipment's value will be subtracted
from the totals under current accounting methods. Historical
measures would value the old equipment at zero, encouraging
executives to keep it.</p>
<p>Mr. Harmer cites a metal-fabrication press, which bends
and shapes metal. To determine the replacement cost of a
press bought in 1982 for $522,000, the company would add 19%
-- the change in the wholesale price index over the seven
years -- to arrive at a replacement cost of $621,000. Since
the company assumes that the press has a 12-year life, it
then would deduct depreciation from both numbers, putting the
replacement value at $257,000. That's still 19% higher than
what accounting rules force the company to show on its books.</p>
<p>"That's our starting point," Mr. Harmer says. "If managers
think the value is way off, they can challenge it."</p>
<p>Real-estate values are determined by appraisals every two
to three years.</p>
<p>Although FMC's numbers are more accurate, they also show
why many companies oppose the plan: FMC estimates that 1989
operating profit (before interest expense and taxes),
reported at $347 million, would have been 10% to 15% lower
using current-cost accounting.</p>
<p>For other companies, the effects would vary. Many
capital-intensive, smokestack industries, such as autos,
steel or machine tools, would post sharply lower results, Mr.
Harmer suggests. But the impact would be substantially less
for high-tech companies and service concerns without a lot of
old plant and equipment.</p>
<p>Mr. Harmer acknowledges that the current-cost accounting
is no panacea. Intangibles such as good will and training
pose insurmountable problems; the company uses standard
historical accounting for them.</p>
<p>The SEC's Mr. Lochner sees that as just one stumbling
block. "What is the current value of Coca-Cola's trademarks?
Your guess is as good as theirs," he says. "But we all know
it's worth more than the $1 or so it's carried for on Coke's
books." (Actually, it's on the books at zero.)</p>
<p>The SEC has been down this road before. John C. Burton, a
Columbia professor and former SEC chief accountant, recalls
that in 1974, when bank portfolios "were very much under
water," the Accounting Standards Executive Committee was
ready to shift those holdings to current prices. Mr. Burton
says he lined up the five commissioners to vote for the plan.</p>
<p>Arthur Burns, then the Federal Reserve chairman, called
Mr. Burton to a special meeting to discuss the plan -- on
Christmas Eve. The Fed chief praised Mr. Burton, his former
student, as an accounting theorist. Then he informed Mr.
Burton that he "should advise the commissioners that they
were taking a grave risk with the economic future of the U.S.
in the interest of a somewhat dubious accounting principle."</p>
<p>The next day, the commissioners withdrew their support for
the plan.</p>
