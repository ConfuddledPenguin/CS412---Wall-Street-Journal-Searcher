	<p class="article-leader">Defense lawyers in the first obscenity trial against a
U.S. museum may have a tough time picking a favorable jury
despite using state-of-the-art jury selection research.
   Based on some of the answers they got in three days of
questioning prospective jurors, the defense team faces an
uphill fight in the trial, expected to begin today or
tomorrow in Cincinnati municipal court.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cincinnati's Contemporary Arts Center and its director are
charged with criminal obscenity and displaying illegal images
of nude children. At issue are seven of 175 photographs
included in an exhibition by the late Robert Mapplethorpe
that was on display here from April 7 through May 26. If
convicted, the museum would face up to $10,000 in fines and
its director, Dennis Barrie, would face up to a year in jail
and a $2,000 fine.</p>
<p>The case hinges on whether the jury finds, as prosecutors
contend, that five of Mr. Mapplethorpe's photographs,
depicting sadomasochistic and homoerotic images, are obscene
and whether two others, depicting nude children, violate
child pornography laws. As in any trial, the outcome will
largely depend on the jurors selected, but the choices will
weigh especially heavily in this case.</p>
<p>The law defining obscenity rests on a three-pronged test
that can vary from community to community. Jurors will be
asked whether the average person, applying contemporary
community standards, would find that the work as a whole
appeals to prurient interests, and whether the work depicts
sexual practices in a patently offensive way. Even if the
jury finds those propositions to be true, it can convict only
if it also finds that the work, taken as a whole, lacks
serious literary or artistic value.</p>
<p>H. Louis Sirkin, representing Mr. Barrie, has said he
generally wants jurors who feel at ease with themselves and
can be open-minded. Mr. Sirkin and his partner, Marc D.
Mezibov, said they hired a consultant to conduct a community
poll to help pinpoint which residents of Cincinnati and
surrounding Hamilton County would look upon Mr.
Mapplethorpe's work most openly. They declined to give any
details of what they found.</p>
<p>Community polling, often complemented by pretrial mock
trials and the use of psychologists to help evaluate
prospective jurors, has become a widely accepted means of
helping lawyers in jury selection.</p>
<p>Defense lawyers for Mr. Barrie and the arts center gave a
hint of what their survey found Monday when they asked
Hamilton County Municipal Judge David F. Albanese to limit
the trial's pool of prospective jurors to residents of
Cincinnati, arguing that rural and suburban Hamilton County
residents are too strongly predisposed against pornography to
serve as objective jurors. Judge Albanese, a former assistant
prosecutor for Hamilton County who is up for re-election in
1993, denied the motion.</p>
<p>Finding jurors sympathetic to protecting homoerotic art
was likely to be difficult even if limited to city residents,
however. Works previously perceived by Cincinnati
law-enforcement officials as pornographic have included
"Hair," "Oh] Calcutta" and "Equus." When the Martin Scorcese
film "The Last Temptation of Christ" was released, theater
owners here skirted the controversy surrounding the film by
simply not showing it. There are no adult book and video
stores in Cincinnati and no nude dancing or X-rated cable
video programing.</p>
<p>For the past three days, defense lawyers for Mr. Barrie
and the museum and Hamilton County chief prosecutor Frank
Prouty have been probing the backgrounds and values of
prospective jurors in an effort to select eight from a pool
of 50. The lawyers have been asking pointed and personal
questions about prospective jurors' attitudes toward
homosexuality, their interest in art, their receptivity to
ideas and forms of expression they may find offensive and the
extent to which they have stayed abreast of contemporary
events.</p>
<p>Only three of the 50 prospective jurors had been to the
Mapplethorpe exhibit, and none was seated for the trial. Most
who were questioned had never heard of Mr. Mapplethorpe; few
said they visited galleries. One prospective juror said he
had been to only two movies in three years and wouldn't have
recognized the Center for Contemporary Art if he had driven
by it. A movie that would interest him, he said, "would be a
movie that showed true love, two people truly caring for each
other."</p>
<p>Another said he preferred working, fishing and treasure
salvaging to anything else. "If somebody invited me to a
museum or something, I might go, but who's going to invite
me?" he said.</p>
<p>The judge in the case has asked members of the press not
to name the jurors to shield them from harassment or
embarrassment.</p>
<p>An earlier ruling by Judge Albanese could add
significantly to the challenge facing the defense. The judge
said the jury will not necessarily have to view the exhibit
as a whole in determining whether the individual pictures
named in the indictment are obscene. The ruling effectively
means that the art center and Mr. Barrie could be convicted
if the jury finds any one of Mr. Mapplethorpe's photos
obscene.</p>
<p>The judge, however, is still expected to hear more expert
testimony that the entire Mapplethorpe retrospective should
be considered as a whole.</p>

<p>CREDITORS COMMITTEES lose appeal over reimbursement for
expenses.</p>
<p>The federal appeals court in Cincinnati became the first
such court in the nation to address the issue of whether
members of creditor committees in bankruptcies are entitled
to compensation for their expenses.</p>
<p>The decision barring expense payments to creditor groups
is expected to hamper the participation of small creditors in
bankruptcy-law proceedings, lawyers said.</p>
<p>The case involves George Worthington Co., a Mentor, Ohio,
hardware goods distributor that filed a voluntary petition
for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code in 1986. The company, now called Worthington Group,
emerged from bankruptcy protection in 1988.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy court appointed 12 members to a committee
of creditors that represented unsecured claims against
Worthington of over $13 million. The committee submitted
requests for reimbursement of expenses totaling $16,727. The
debtor did not object to the request.</p>
<p>But in a 2-1 decision, the appeals panel upheld a lower
court decision denying the committee's request. The appeals
panel wrote that Congress had the ability to grant the
bankruptcy courts' authority to allow for reimbursement but
had failed to do so. If creditors fail to participate in
committees because they cannot recoup their expenses, the
court wrote, "then the remedy should be supplied by Congress,
not the court."</p>
<p>A majority of courts have allowed reimbursement for
members' expenses out of the debtor's estate. But bankruptcy
lawyers say the uncertainty arises out of a change in the
bankruptcy act in 1978. Prior to that time, the rules allowed
for the recovery of administrative expenses. But the current
bankruptcy rules do not contain an express right to such
reimbursement by members of creditor committees.</p>
<p>"The creditors in very large bankruptcies usually have
sufficient economic interest to absorb the expenses of
economic participation. But the decision means that creditors
with small claims won't be represented, even though the
number of claims may in the aggregate be quite large," says
Dennis O'Dea, a lawyer with the Chicago law firm Keck, Mahin
& Cate and counsel to the Worthington creditors committee.
Mr. O'Dea said he plans to ask the court to rehear the case.</p>
<p>But lawyers representing creditors say the case will have
repercussions in large bankruptcy cases as well. "In a large
and complex case, there are substantial expenses over an
extended period of time. Often members have to fly in from
various states around the country," says Ellen Werther, a
lawyer with the New York law firm Coudert Brothers who is
representing a committee of bondholders of Allied Stores
Corp. in the Allied and Federated Department Stores
bankruptcy cases pending in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Ms. Werther said the implications of the Worthington case
are expected to be discussed today at a hearing in the case.
The bankruptcy court hasn't determined whether it will
approve expenses for members of the creditor committees,
which are expected to run "in the tens of thousands of
dollars," according to Jonathan M. Jacobson, a Coudert
lawyer.</p>

<p>SONY LOSES bid to halt fraud suit stemming from takeover
of Columbia.</p>
<p>A federal judge in Manhattan rejected Sony Corp.'s motion
to dismiss a class-action lawsuit filed by former
shareholders of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. Sony
agreed to buy Columbia for $3.4 billion in September 1989.</p>
<p>The shareholders allege that Sony violated securities laws
in the months before the takeover by making false and
misleading statements denying that merger negotiations were
under way. The shareholders claim that the denials, issued
through news releases to the media, artificially depressed
Columbia's stock price, causing the shareholders to sell
their stock at a loss.</p>
<p>In federal court in Manhattan, Judge Leonard Sand ruled
that the allegations in the lawsuit were sufficient to allow
the case to continue.</p>
<p>Sony had claimed that the plaintiffs hadn't shown that the
news releases were false and that the denials didn't have a
significant impact on the stock price. But Judge Sand ruled
that disclosure of any takeover negotiations might have
changed the way investors viewed the stock. Attorneys for
Sony couldn't be reached for comment.</p>

<p>PETER TUFO leaves Brown & Wood to join Lazard Freres & Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Tufo, who helped build Tufo & Zuccotti into one of New
York City's most politically powerful law firms in the 1980s,
will become a senior adviser at the investment banking firm
Lazard Freres.</p>
<p>The move follows by three years a merger of Tufo &
Zuccotti into the law firm of Brown & Wood. Last year, Mr.
Tufo's former partner, John Zuccotti, also made a career
change when he joined the real estate conglomerate Olympia &
York USA as president.</p>
<p>A Lazard spokesman said Mr. Tufo would be used as a
resource for the firm's legal, real estate and bankruptcy
work. In addition to his legal work, Mr. Tufo currently
serves as chairman of the New York State Thruway Authority.</p>

<p>WINSTON & STRAWN, a 400-lawyer firm based in Chicago,
merged with 75-lawyer Bishop, Cook, Purcell & Reynolds, a
Washington-based firm with energy and environmental
practices. The merged firm is called Winston & Strawn.</p>
