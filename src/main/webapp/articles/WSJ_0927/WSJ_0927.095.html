	<p class="article-leader">The top brass at Xerox Corp. have convinced themselves
that the copier maker has been transformed into "the Document
Company." Now they have to convince the rest of the world.
   On Monday, Xerox will begin an advertising campaign that
attempts to broaden the company's image beyond the product
that is synonymous with its name. Some of the ads also will
pitch a product that hasn't been introduced yet, known
internally as "Xenith," that Xerox is betting its future on.
The new machine is a do-it-all contraption that combines
computing, scanning, faxing, copying and other capabilities
to create high-quality reports.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new ad campaign, with the theme "Putting It Together,"
features shots of office workers preparing and using such
documents. The Broadway show tune "Putting It Together," from
Stephen Sondheim's "Sunday in the Park with George" musical,
plays in the background of all the ads. The spots finish with
the line: "Xerox. The Document Company." The campaign is the
first developed for the company by Young & Rubicam, the
agency that Xerox chose in July to replace Backer Spielvogel
Bates on its $25 million account.</p>
<p>"We're aligning all the energy of the company to focus not
on our products, but on the product of our products, which is
a document," says Len Vickers, senior vice president of
world-wide marketing at Xerox. "The document is going to be a
big issue in the 1990s."</p>
<p>But Xerox faces a stiff challenge in changing its image
from the familiar to the slightly more complex. Marketing
consultants say they aren't sure exactly what "The Document
Company" means. "Maybe a document is something more than just
a copy, but you really have to think hard to make a
meaningful distinction," says Clive Chajet, chairman and
chief executive officer of Lippincott & Margulies Inc., an
image consultant.</p>
<p>Xerox, though, insists that there's a difference, and that
the positioning is right on target. In a bid to help business
executives understand, Xerox is adopting almost a
bang-'em-over-the-head strategy by running many lengthy
60-second TV ads that pitch the process of putting together
documents "bit by bit . . . piece by piece," according to the
Sondheim lyrics.</p>
<p>"The kind of executives we are talking to aren't walking
around thinking `I've got document problems,'" Mr. Vickers
says. "But they have business problems for which document
solutions are the answer," he adds.</p>
<p>One newspaper ad asks the question: "How much are you
spending on documents that never get read?" The ad pitches
the importance of creating "business documents that are
inviting and involving . . . documents that truly reflect the
intelligence and uniqueness of your thinking."</p>
<p>Some of the TV spots are more exotic. One features art
restorers at work fixing a fresco on the ceiling of an
Italian chapel. They're shown looking at maps of the original
work. In another ad, astronauts are shown heading out to the
launch pad while they check out last-minute documents and
schedules. In yet another, a weight lifter in a wheelchair
notes his progress on a weight-lifting chart on the wall.</p>
<p>Eric Weber, vice chairman and creative director at Young &
Rubicam, concedes that the perception of Xerox as just a
"copier maker" is still alive. "But just by saying `Putting
It Together,' we began dramatically changing that perception"
in consumer focus groups, he says. The company plans an
aggressive ad schedule, with TV, radio and print ads
scheduled throughout the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The new ads differ markedly from early Xerox ads, many of
which won accolades for their use of humor. One famous Xerox
pitchman was Brother Dominick, a monk who won the approval of
his superiors by making quick copies with a Xerox machine.
And yucks also abounded in a spot in which a nerdy football
player named Kolodny handed copies of a game plan to his
teammates on the field. Most recently, Xerox ran ads
centering on its Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award.</p>
<p>There are hints, though, that Young & Rubicam may
eventually lead Xerox back to its irreverent roots. One ad
still being shot features a group of corporate workers
toiling late on an important business proposal. But when it's
discovered that the firm's eccentric CEO will be giving the
presentation, the workers frantically use the Xerox equipment
to enlarge the type and make other adjustments. The next day,
the young workers watch through a two-way mirror as the CEO
does a commendable job.</p>
<p>In any event, Xerox says it's committed to the "Putting It
Together" campaign for the long run. "It's a 10-year idea or
longer," Mr. Vickers says. "We're not going to change our
tune on this one. We've made our bet . . . and this is it."</p>

<p>Ad Age Names Top 100
</p>
<p>Philip Morris retained its position as top U.S. advertiser
in 1989, with $2.07 billion in spending, according to a
report by Advertising Age magazine.</p>
<p>Procter & Gamble, at $1.79 billion, finished second to
Philip Morris for the third consecutive year. Sears, Roebuck
edged out General Motors for the No. 3 spot this year,
spending $1.43 billion. General Motors fell to No. 4, at
$1.35 billion.</p>
<p>Total spending by the top 100 national advertisers, at
$33.9 billion, was up 6.4% from 1988. The rate of spending
growth slowed slightly from 1988, when spending increased
6.7% over the previous year.</p>
<p>The top four advertisers -- the only ones to break the $1
billion spending mark -- accounted for nearly 20% of the top
100 total. Likewise, the top 100 spenders accounted for more
than three-fourths of total U.S. ad spending.</p>
<p>Network TV remained the most popular ad medium, accounting
for 21.4% of the top 100's overall ad spending and growing
2.7% to $7.2 billion. But its dominance among national
measured media is being eroded by jumps in syndicated TV and
cable TV, which grew 43% and 27.4%, respectively.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>BOZELL MERGER: Bozell, New York, said its agency in Italy
merged with Testa Pella Rossetti of Milan. The new agency,
called Bozell Testa Pell Rossetti, will have billings of
about $105 million. Under the agreement, Bozell has majority
control under an equity partnership with TPR's principals.
Bozell's Tullio Cottinini will be chairman of the new agency.</p>
<p>TOBACCO BAN: Two small Michigan newspapers have banned
national tobacco advertising. The Daily News and the Carson
City Gazette, both owned by Greenville News of Greenville,
Mich., joins a small group of other newspapers across the
country that don't accept tobacco ads.</p>
