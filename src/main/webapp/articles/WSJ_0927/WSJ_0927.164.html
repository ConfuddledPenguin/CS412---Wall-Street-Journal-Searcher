	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In one of the largest partnerships between two
separate media companies, Newsweek magazine and Times Mirror
Magazines have joined to create a multimagazine, multimedia
advertising package.
   By offering the package, to be known as the Ad-Vantage
program, Newsweek, owned by Washington Post Co., and Times
Mirror Magazines, a unit of Times Mirror Co., are taking
direct aim at competition from packages offered by such
multimedia companies as Time Warner Inc. While national
advertisers have largely slashed their ad budgets, such
packages try to lure more dollars from advertisers with
discounts offering access to video, print and promotions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ad-Vantage received generally good reactions from
advertising agency media directors, who said it offers an
attractive, heavily male audience, and the ability to buy
time on network TV affiliates and cable systems owned by both
Washington Post Co. and Times Mirror. Advertisers would be
able to create special ad supplements in the magazines and
arrange special events -- such as in-store promotions or
sponsorship of sporting events.</p>
<p>Times Mirror publishes a number of magazines with heavy
male readership, such as Field & Stream, Outdoor Life, Golf
Magazine, Popular Science and The Sporting News.</p>
<p>Newsweek is expected to benefit the most from the plan.
For years it has had to compete with Time magazine, whose
parent, Time Warner, can offer attractive multi-magazine ad
packages. "This makes Newsweek stronger," says Peter
Gardiner, senior vice president at DDB Needham Worldwide.
"Their weakness was being a sole publication that couldn't
offer tie-ins to other titles."</p>
<p>But Michael Drexler, national media director of Bozell
agency, questioned the success of a package targeted so
heavily to male readers. "It's a brilliant scheme, but I
don't think anyone will jump at it right away," he said.</p>
<p>The timing of the Newsweek-Times Mirror announcement was
crucial: In the coming weeks, ad agencies are planning how
and where they will spend millions in clients' ad dollars in
1991.</p>
<p>The partnership underscores the cutthroat nature of
magazines' advertising sales as the industry works its way
through an advertising slump. Partnerships are rare among
consumer magazines, since they compete so closely for
advertisers' dollars and readers' time.</p>
