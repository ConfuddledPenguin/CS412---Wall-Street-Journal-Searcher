	<div class="article-body"><p>AFTER A 7 A.M.-TO-3:30 P.M. DAY as a telephone-systems
assistant at Public Service Electric & Gas Co., Betty Flood
returns to her Newark, N.J., apartment and starts a second
job. It doesn't pay, the hours are terrible and the noise can
be deafening. The 56-year-old Ms. Flood wouldn't have it any
other way.</p>
<p>Betty Flood runs her own game room/hang-out for the 254
children of the 540-unit apartment complex in which she
lives. Concerned by the number of children who didn't seem to
have a place to go after school, she started the project on
her own in 1978, using space donated by the building's
landlord. Despite open-heart surgery five years ago, she is
still going strong. "As long as I can keep a child from
roaming the streets, I'll stay right here," says Ms. Flood,
who, with four children and 21 grandchildren of her own, has
experience with growing children.</p>
<p>To a visitor, Ms. Flood's center (it has no official name)
is a bedlam of TV blare, clicking billiard balls, clunking
hand-hockey pucks and shouts and squeals. But Ms. Flood,
whose own apartment is on the floor above, is in control from
the moment she greets her charges with a "Hi, baby, how ya
doin]" as they are signed in until she jots down their time
out (the center opens at 4:30 p.m. and usually closes by 11
p.m.; those under 13 years of age must go home by 8 p.m.).</p>
<p>Should a youth become rowdy, Ms. Flood brings the offender
back in line by brandishing a hollow plastic toy baseball
bat. But that's as rough as it gets, and the posted rules --
such as "anyone cursing will be suspended for six weeks" --
are mostly obeyed. "When Betty Flood speaks, the kids
listen," says John Jenkins, principal of a nearby elementary
school. "She has the respect of all the kids in that complex
and they're better children for the experience."</p>
<p>It's more than just a safe place to go after school. Ms.
Flood leads rap sessions with the youths, whose ages range
from a preschool four to a high school 18, and teaches them a
range of skills from reading to neat dressing to chess
playing. She organizes picnics, sponsored by her utility
employer and held in the complex's outside area, and stages
Easter egg hunts and Halloween parties.</p>
<p>Neither Ms. Flood nor Charlotte Young, a volunteer
assistant, are paid for their efforts. Ms. Flood doesn't even
have an estimate of the annual costs of running the center,
which is supported by donations from local merchants and
other businesses.</p>
<p>Fiori DePhillips, owner of the nearby Roseville Pharmacy
which is contributing about $300 to Ms. Flood's Halloween
party, has a high regard for Ms. Flood's work. "She helps
keep the kids off the streets and out of trouble and is
showing us how to get along and work together," he says.</p>
<p>Although some local politicians have urged her to seek
public funding for her effort, she has declined. "If I took
state, federal or city funds, I would have to take in
children from other areas and I couldn't control them," she
says.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, she's looking forward to January when her
center will move into a twice-as-large space at the complex
where there will be two bathrooms -- one for boys, one for
girls -- and a full-sized pool table given by Ms. Flood's
employer, PSE&G. She sees no problem filling the new quarters
with active kids.</p>
