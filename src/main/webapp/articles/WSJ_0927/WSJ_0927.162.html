	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- BankAmerica Corp., continuing to dance on
the grave of the troubled thrift industry, has apparently won
the bidding for MeraBank, once Arizona's largest savings and
loan association.
   The acquisition from the federal Resolution Trust Corp.,
BankAmerica's second of a major, insolvent Arizona S&L this
year, would catapult the bank holding company into one of the
state's largest financial institutions within less than four
months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Terms of the transaction weren't known, but analysts
believe BankAmerica paid slightly more than the $81 million
it paid in May for Western Savings & Loan Association, a
Phoenix-based thrift that is somewhat smaller than cross-town
rival MeraBank.</p>
<p>Analysts figured in both instances that BankAmerica paid
an amount roughly equal to 3% to 4% of so-called core retail
deposits. By contrast, BankAmerica earlier this month paid a
hefty premium of 6.85% of deposits to acquire Benjamin
Franklin Savings & Loan Association, based in Portland, Ore.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for BankAmerica and the Resolution Trust Corp.
declined comment on the transaction. The RTC took control of
MeraBank in January and recently vowed to sell it by the end
of the third quarter. A BankAmerica official said he
understood that the company had been informed that it was the
successful bidder for the thrift. And Security Pacific Corp.,
considered BankAmerica's main rival in the sale, is
understood to have been told by regulators that its bid had
been rejected.</p>
<p>"There is a strong feeling that there is a window of
opportunity" to acquire market share on the cheap through
purchasing failed thrifts, said the BankAmerica official.
"The appetite for further acquisitions is very strong."</p>
<p>MeraBank has 66 branches and deposits totaling roughly
$4.7 billion. Western Savings had 61 branches and deposits of
about $3.5 billion. Only Valley National Corp. and First
Interstate Bancorp would have larger Arizona operations than
BankAmerica, state banking officials estimated.</p>
<p>A subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp.
until its January seizure, MeraBank rolled up huge losses in
commercial real-estate. MeraBank's collapse, including losses
from an expansion into Texas, operations of which aren't
believed to be part of the sale to BankAmerica, is expected
to cost the government at least $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Indeed, the sale to BankAmerica, and other recent sales of
thrifts in the state to banks, marks the end of an era. "For
all practical purposes, the S&L industry in Arizona has been
eliminated," said Hank Rivoir, the Arizona banking
superintendent. "I personally am happy to see it."</p>
