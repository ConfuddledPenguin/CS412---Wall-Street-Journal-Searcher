	<p class="article-leader">WARNING FOR FRENCH INDUSTRY</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>France's government is urging French industry to avoid
close ties to Japanese companies, France's Industry Minister
said.</p>
<p>The minister, Roger Fauroux, said Britain's auto industry
now is almost totally dependent on Japanese partners and on
Japanese-owned factories. He said he once asked Nicholas
Ridley, before the British official resigned as trade
minister, what was left of the United Kingdom's auto
industry, and Mr. Ridley replied, "Zero, sir."</p>
<p>"If Renault had invited the Japanese into its capital --
as did the British -- the French auto industry would have
gone the same way as the British. It would have disappeared,"
Mr. Fauroux said. Instead, Renault arranged a share-swap with
Sweden's AB Volvo.</p>
<p>"If we worked with the Japanese we would turn out the same
way as the British auto industry: Zero, sir," Mr. Fauroux
said.</p>
<p>ROMANIA'S RECREATION OFFER</p>
<p>Washington is studying Bucharest's offer to turn Romanian
resorts into recreation centers for U.S., Canadian and
British forces in the Mideast. "We have taken the offer into
consideration and we are thinking it over," said a spokesman
at the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest. Under the offer, Romania
would provide 3,000 to 4,000 beds in luxury hotels and villas
free of charge to the troops and their families.</p>
<p>EUROPE'S INEFFICIENT BANKING</p>
<p>The European Community urged banks to make cash transfers
within the EC faster and cheaper for consumers and small
businesses. The EC said the present, haphazard system of
transferring money from one country to another is inefficient
and expensive. It cited examples of what consumers or small
businesses face when trying to pay or collect bills in
another country. In one, a Belgian resident who had recently
received a French check for 300 French francs ($57) was
charged a commission and fees by a Belgian bank equal to
nearly 25% of its value to process the check.</p>
<p>LOG HOUSES FOR JAPAN</p>
<p>Itoman & Co., a Japanese trading house, said it is
starting a joint venture with Toocx Co., an Osaka
construction company, to market log houses. The new concern,
Itoman Canadian Logark Co., will be set up in Osaka on Oct.
1. The joint venture will import logs from Canada through a
subsidiary in Vancouver and assemble log houses in Japan for
sale; the logs will be prepared for assembly in Canada by
Canadian log builders in accordance with designs and
specifications sent from customers in Japan.</p>
<p>HELP FOR SPAIN'S BEST HOTELS</p>
<p>Spain may cut the value-added tax on four-star hotels in
the 1991 budget to help boost a flagging tourist trade.
Tourism, Communications and Transport Minister Jose
Barrionuevo said the government was considering an offer by
the hotel sector to freeze its prices in exchange for a
reduction in the 12% VAT rate. A reduction would affect about
380 hotels. Earlier, the minister had predicted that revenue
from tourism, which accounts for 40% of Spain's foreign
income, would fall by up to 10% in 1990.</p>
<p>RICE FARMERS' RALLY</p>
<p>More than 5,000 farmers from around Japan gathered in
Tokyo yesterday to demand that Japan not give in to foreign
requests that it end its ban on rice imports. The farmers,
many of them elderly, sat in the rain at a rally in a public
park and applauded speakers who insisted that the country
resist calls for it to allow rice imports. "Stop U.S. rice,"
said one banner hoisted by the crowd.</p>
<p>GLOBAL PHONE STUDY</p>
<p>A new study shows that people in Scandinavian countries
have among the lowest telephone bills in the developed world.</p>
<p>Comparing costs for identical telecommunications services
around the world, the study by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development found that Icelandic and Danish
businesses pay the least -- 58% less than the average.
Spanish businesses pay the most, 45% above average.</p>
<p>The OECD found little economic logic in the wide
differences. But generally in Western Europe, it is cheaper
to use the phone in a small or a northern country than in a
big or a southern one. And countries with high costs often
have phone companies with fat profits: In 1987, by OECD
formulas, Spain's Telefonica had a 23.5% profit margin,
compared with the developed-world average of 7.8%.</p>
<p>High prices don't guarantee good service: In Spain, 17.6%
of international calls don't get through because of equipment
problems.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Power failures, lack of public transportation and a cash
shortage due to a prolonged bank strike frustrated Greeks
yesterday as the second 48-hour nationwide walkout within a
week got under way. The strike is in protest against economic
austerity and proposed legislation overhauling health and
pension plans. . . . A Norwegian multimillionaire made
front-page news in Oslo by paying income tax when he owed
none. Shipowner and investor Knut Utstein Kloster sent a
voluntary payment of $130,000 to the Oslo tax office.
"Everyone should pay tax," he told a newspaper.</p>
