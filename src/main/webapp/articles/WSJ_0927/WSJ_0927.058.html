	<p class="article-leader">Meridian Bancorp expects to report a third-quarter loss of
$35 million to $39 million, after boosting its loan-loss
reserves by $75 million and taking one-time charges for the
sale of several businesses.
   "Economic conditions have deteriorated and we felt it was
time to beef up our reserves and strengthen our capital
position," said Samuel A. McCullough, chairman and chief
executive officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In recent years, the Reading, Pa., bank company was intent
on diversifying its earnings base by moving into a variety of
non-banking businesses. But now with a softening economy and
troubled real estate markets, management has decided to sell
some of these operations that aren't profitable. The bank
will also leave businesses in which it doesn't have the
critical mass needed to compete with big major-city banks.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Meridian put its title insurance business on
the block. It's also looking to sell its $300 million
credit-card portfolio and about $300 million of its indirect
auto loan receivables.</p>
<p>For the time being, Meridian is holding to some of its
other non-banking operations, such as mortgage lending, asset
management, trust services, merchant banking and securities
brokerage. These operations had been reorganized into a
financial services group earlier this year.</p>
<p>Meridian's management "decided it was time to bite the
bullet," said David Penn at Legg Mason Inc. "But it's not one
of the disaster cases. {Meridian} has capital and liquidity,
which is what the regulators are looking for."</p>
<p>Meridian said the additional $75 million in reserves was
needed because certain loans in its commercial and
real-estate portfolios continued to weaken during the summer.
Nonperforming assets are expected to increase to about $135
million at the end of third quarter from $107.6 million at
June 30. Less than one-third of the nonperforming loans are
tied to real estate.</p>
<p>Mr. McCullough stressed that the reserve addition wasn't
mandated by federal or state regulators, who concluded a
review of the bank's books during the second quarter.</p>
<p>The bank said it would maintain its current 30-cent
quarterly dividend. Unless the sale of the credit card
portfolio and auto loans closes before year end, the bank
wouldn't earn enough to cover the payout, Mr. McCullough
said.</p>
<p>Meridian estimated a third-quarter per-share loss of 86
cents to 96 cents. In the 1989 third quarter, the bank earned
$22.5 million, or 56 cents a share.</p>
<p>The company's shares closed yesterday at $11.75, off
$1.50, in national over-the-counter trading.</p>
