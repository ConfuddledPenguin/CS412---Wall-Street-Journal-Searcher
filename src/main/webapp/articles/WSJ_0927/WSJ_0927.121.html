	<p class="article-leader">Justin Industries Inc., a Fort Worth, Texas, maker of
Western boots, bricks and building materials, said it
completed its acquisition of Tony Lama Co. for $9 a share, or
$18 million, with 97% of the El Paso, Texas, boot maker's
stock tendered.
   Holders of the remaining Lama stock will receive $9 a
share. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Lama
shares closed at $8.50, down 25 cents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The deal, in which Justin also assumed $34 million of Lama
debt, is a setback for dissident holders seeking to acquire
Justin. The dissident group had sued, seeking, among other
things, to block the Lama deal, but a U.S. judge in Fort
Worth denied the request Monday. The group Tuesday launched
an $18-a-share tender offer for 6.2 million Justin shares, to
boost its stake to 78% from about 12%. Justin shares ended
unchanged at $15 in national OTC trading. The group said its
offer would have been $20 a share but for the Lama
acquisition, which they contend lowers Justin's value. Lama
had a 1989 loss of $1.8 million, or 95 cents a share, on
sales of $75.6 million.</p>
