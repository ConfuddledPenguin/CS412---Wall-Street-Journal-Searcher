	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Sales at Japan's department stores and other
major retail stores in August rose 7.9% to 1.525 trillion yen
($11.15 billion) from a year earlier, the government said.
   The August growth followed a 9% year-to-year increase
posted in July. Though the pace of growth slowed, compared
with the second quarter, in which retail sales grew between
10% and 16%, "Retail sales are on a steady upward trend," an
official said. The pace of growth usually slows in August
because of seasonal factors.</p>
