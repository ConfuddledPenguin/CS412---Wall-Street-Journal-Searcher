	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush is ready to back away from
his insistence that the capital gains tax rate be cut, top
congressional Republicans suggested after a White House
meeting.
   "He might be willing to compromise on capital-gains
taxes," which have been one of the main sticking-points in
the budget talks, said Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole
of Kansas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bush himself, questioned by reporters aboard Air Force
One later in the day, wouldn't say if his stance has changed.
"The Republicans know what I want when I talk about growth,"
he said.</p>
<p>Sen. Dole and Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the
second-ranking House Republican, said the president is
willing to consider alternatives to a capital-gains cut as a
tax incentive for economic growth. The two GOP leaders
mentioned such modest alternatives as tax breaks for research
and development and tax-favored enterprise zones, ideas that
many Democrats already support.</p>
<p>Budget negotiators have been casting about for a way to
narrow the tax bite on the sale of assets other than a
straight cut in rates. Negotiators have discussed such
alternatives as sticking with the curent rate but applying it
only to gains in excess of inflation; cutting the rate only
for profits on new investments, and limiting the lower rate
to investments in startup companies.</p>
<p>Democrats charge that the president's insistence on
reducing capital-gains taxes is a major obstacle to reaching
a deficit-reduction compromise. Republicans counter that
other issues also remain unresolved, including ways to
restrain government benefit programs.</p>
<p>On that score, lawmakers said that negotiators have
discussed ways to trim Social Security spending in the latest
round of closed-door talks. "It's achieved a new level of
seriousness," said one Democratic aide.</p>
<p>Democrats have argued for taxing away more of the benefits
paid to upper-income Americans while Republicans lean toward
a delay in cost-of-living adjustments, the aides said.</p>
<p>But negotiators still haven't come to any final agreement
on how to restrain benefit programs, one of the stickiest
issues in talks. Any changes to Social Security are likely to
be politically explosive -- particularly with all the recent
attention devoted to the growing surplus in the Social
Security trust fund.</p>
<p>As negotiators -- five top congressional leaders and three
administration officials -- resumed their closed-door talks
in the Capitol, Mr. Bush took the offensive.</p>
<p>"All through the talks, for 135 long days, time and again
I've gone the extra mile. . . . And each time the other side
has said, `It's still your move,'" the president charged
during a campaign stop in Ohio. "If and when the ax falls,
the Democratic Congress knows that it will be held
accountable and I will take that message to every state in
the union," he warned. "It is their fault. . . ."</p>
<p>The president's words, after weeks of conciliatory
comments, seemed to suggest that negotiators still weren't
near an accord just four days before fiscal 1991 begins
Monday. On that date, the government faces a shutdown or $85
billion in crippling, automatic spending cuts.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush's broadside also reflected the feeling of
congressional Republicans that Democrats have been winning
the publicrelations battle. "One of the things the president
has been doing wrong is he's been hammering the Congress --
not the Democrats in Congress," said Rep. Mickey Edwards (R.,
Okla.), who attended yesterday's White House meeting. "We
decided it was time for him to really hit the Democrats
hard."</p>
<p>But Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell said, "The
irony of the president's statement is we thought we were
making progress." House Speaker Thomas Foley said Democrats
won't let the partisan speech critically damage the talks.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Speaker Foley postponed action on an emergency
spending resolution to keep the government funded for the
first weeks of the new fiscal year. Democratic leaders wanted
to avoid a divisive vote on a provision that would postpone
the spending cuts required next week under the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law. The leaders are plainly ambivalent
about trying to delay the cuts, given Mr. Bush's threat this
week to veto any waiver, and may postpone action until as
late as Sunday.</p>
<p>If congressional and administration negotiators reach a
budget accord before Monday, then Congress and Mr. Bush are
likely to quickly enact a stopgap spending bill to keep the
government going and waive the Gramm-Rudman spending cuts.</p>
<p>If there's no agreement, however, it isn't clear what
happens. If an emergency spending bill passes and is signed
by the president, then the Gramm-Rudman ax falls. About $85
billion of the sums appropriated by that bill are withheld,
and at least some agencies furlough employees.</p>
<p>But there are other alternatives. If Congress and the
president can't even agree on the terms of an emergency
spending bill, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu has
said the administration is preparing to rely on 1980 and 1981
opinions by President Carter's attorney general, Benjamin
Civiletti, to keep essential parts of the government going --
at least for a few days. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
said yesterday that the decade-old legal opinion "is held to
and subscribed to by this department," but that he hadn't
discussed its application with President Bush.</p>
<p>President Reagan relied on the Civiletti opinion when the
federal government was without any spending authority for
four days in 1981. Many government facilities closed, but
air-traffic controllers stayed on the job, Social Security
checks were mailed and meat was inspected.</p>
<p>Such a move would be controversial, however. "On the face
of it, this appears to be nothing more than a thinly veiled
attempt to selectively apply the sequester," said Sen. Robert
Byrd (W., Va), referring to the spending cuts mandated by the
Gramm-Rudman law.</p>
<p>"I don't think the president has that authority," added
Rep. John Myers (R., Ind.). "Sununu is assuming a lot, but
then he doesn't think much of the Congress. Never has."</p>
<p>As the talks have dragged on without success,
rank-and-file Democrats in the House are pressing harder for
a budget alternative that better reflects the party's
priorities if the talks break up. "This is going nowhere,"
said Rep. Richard Durbin (D., Ill.) after House Democrats
caucused yesterday. "There is no mutiny. There is nothing
like it, but some of us feel we have to move on to the next
step."</p>
<p>The Senate voted yesterday to apply the automatic cuts to
the paychecks of members of Congress and top administration
officials. The law currently exempts them -- though not their
staffs -- from furlough or other direct hits.</p>
