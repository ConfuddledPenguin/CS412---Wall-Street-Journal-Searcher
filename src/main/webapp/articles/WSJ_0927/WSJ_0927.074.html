	<p class="article-leader">U.S. consumers pay doctors more than twice as much as
their Canadian neighbors do for the same amount of health
services, a new study says.
   But researchers found that the higher fees for U.S.
doctors don't translate to comparably higher incomes because
they have higher overhead costs and a lighter workload than
Canadian physicians do.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The study, in today's New England Journal of Medicine,
adds to an emerging body of research that questions whether
the U.S. gets its money's worth from the world's most
expensive health-care system. Last spring, researchers
reported that death rates in U.S. and Canadian hospitals were
similar for a variety of procedures while expenditures for
hospital care were 25% to 50% higher.</p>
<p>The new study, by Victor Fuchs, a Stanford University
health economist, doesn't directly address quality of care.
But it does challenge some standard assumptions about
differences between the two systems. Advocates for
overhauling the U.S. health-care system consider Canada an
important model.</p>
<p>"The study will be very influential in the health policy
debate," says Uwe Reinhardt, an economist at Princeton
University. "And {we} will have continued research that tries
to get at the question, what are Canadians actually missing?"</p>
<p>Overall, U.S. health expenditures are 38% higher per
capita than in Canada, based on 1985 government and insurance
industry health-care data, the study says. The researchers
focused only on money spent for physician services --
including doctor visits, fees for tests and surgery, nursing
support, equipment and office supplies -- to make their
comparisons.</p>
<p>They found that the U.S. spent $347 per capita on
physician services, while Canada spent $202. For medical
tests and surgical procedures, the U.S. spent $193 per
capita, 2.8 times higher than the Canadian figure of $69. The
difference in expenditures for office and hospital visits was
much smaller: $154 in the U.S. and $133 in Canada. Physician
fees for all services were 2.4 times higher -- and up to 4.5
times higher for some procedures -- in the U.S.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the American Medical Association said the
doctors' group hadn't had time to evaluate the report. The
AMA has generally opposed adopting a Canadian-style system in
the U.S., saying, among other things, that it won't translate
well to the larger and more diverse U.S. population.</p>
<p>The Canadian system, funded principally from taxes, caps
physician fees and establishes a health-care budget. This
results in waiting lines for many elective procedures that
critics say amounts to rationing or restricting care.</p>
<p>The study found that U.S. citizens get only about
three-quarters the amount of services per capita that
Canadians do -- a "striking refutation of the hypothesis that
lower spending in Canada is achieved by providing fewer
services," Mr. Fuchs, and a colleague, James S. Hahn, say in
their study.</p>
<p>Canadian physicians provide about 1.5 times more patient
evaluation and management services -- such as physicals and
other routine care -- than U.S. doctors. This reflects the
fact that Canada has a much higher proportion of general
practitioners over specialists than the U.S., and that
Canadians are fully insured. More than 31 million Americans
lack health insurance and millions of others lack coverage
for primary care. Canadian specialists have a heavier
workload as well: The researchers estimated there are about
40% more "procedure-oriented physicians" in the U.S., but
that Canadians do about 20% more procedures per capita.</p>
<p>Mr. Fuchs said that after adjusting for differences in
specialties, net income of U.S. doctors was 35% higher than
their colleagues in Canada, which he said accounted for only
a relatively "small portion" of higher physician fees.
Overhead for billing, a more cumbersome process in the U.S.
with dozens of private and public third-party payers, as well
as nursing staff, malpractice insurance and other
administrative costs also help explain why U.S. residents get
fewer services per dollar than Canadians.</p>
<p>General practitioners and family physicians deliver
two-thirds of routine care in Canada, while internists,
pediatricians, psychiatrists and other specialists deliver
the rest. "In the U.S. the proportions are reversed," the
authors say. Whether this difference in "intensity of care"
means a difference in quality isn't clear.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed data for both nations for 1985. A
smaller sample, comparing Iowa and Manitoba, as well as an
update using 1987 data turned up some variations in
statistics, but confirmed the broader trends.</p>
