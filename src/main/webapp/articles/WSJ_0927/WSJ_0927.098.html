	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Glenhall Taylor Jr., credited as playing
a key role in turning around BankAmerica Corp., said he will
retire at the end of the year from his positions as board
vice chairman and head of credit policy at the bank.
   Mr. Taylor, 65 years old, leaves behind more than four
decades of banking. He was best known for coming out of
retirement in 1985 to turn around BankAmerica's troubled loan
portfolio through tough new credit procedures and policies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Taylor's plan, which called for identification of
problem loans, rigorous review of new credits and successful
recoveries of loans previously charged off, brought
improvements in the bank's credit portfolio.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor began his banking career in 1948 with American
Trust Co., eventually becoming chairman of the credit policy
committee at Wells Fargo & Co., which acquired American. He
left Wells Fargo in 1983 to become chief credit officer of
BankAmerica's financially troubled Seafirst Bank unit.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor will be succeeded as head of credit policy by
executive vice president Michael E. Rossi, 45, now head of
Bank of America's commercial banking division. Following his
retirement, Mr. Taylor will continue as a director of both
Seafirst Corp. and Seafirst Bank, and as a credit-policy
consultant to BankAmerica.</p>
