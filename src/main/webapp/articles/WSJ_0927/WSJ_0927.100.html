	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The percentage of Americans living in
poverty continued to decline in 1989, but the disparities
between rich and poor continued to widen, the Census Bureau
said.
   More than 31 million Americans, or 12.8% of the
population, lived in poverty last year, according to the
bureau -- a statistically insignificant drop from 13% in
1988, but a continuation of a six-year decline from 15.2% in
1983.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet the improvements have come during the longest
peacetime economic expansion in the country's history, and
some analysts believe progress should have been far greater.</p>
<p>"After seven years of economic recovery, the poverty rate
was higher in 1989 than in any year of the 1970s, including
the deepest recession years of that decade," said Robert
Greenstein, director of the Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, a nonprofit organization that researches poverty
issues. In the recession year 1979, for example, the poverty
rate was 11.7%.</p>
<p>"With the economy now running out of steam and a new
recession threatening, the poverty rate is likely to start
rising again," Mr. Greenstein said.</p>
<p>The bureau's report also showed that the spoils of the
country's wealth were being shared less equitably than they
were the previous year and over the past few decades. The
richest fifth of American households held 46.8% of the
nation's income last year, compared with 46.3% in 1988, 44.2%
in 1979 and 43% in 1969.</p>
<p>The poorest fifth of American households, meanwhile,
claimed 3.8% of the nation's income in 1989, unchanged from
1988, and a slightly smaller share than the 4.1% in both 1979
and 1969.</p>
<p>The figures were based on a survey of 60,000 households.
The goverment's poverty threshold -- three times Agriculture
Department estimates of what a family spends on food -- was
$12,675 in 1989 compared with $12,091 in 1988.</p>
<p>As in the past, far more black Americans than whites lived
in poverty. More than 30% of blacks fell below the poverty
line in 1989, a slight improvement from 31.3% in 1988, while
10% of whites were below the threshold, compared with 10.1%
in 1988. Hispanics also were disproportionately poor; 26.2%
lived in poverty last year, compared with 26.7% in 1988.</p>
<p>Daniel Weinberg, the Census Bureau's chief of housing and
economic statistics, speculated that one reason black poverty
rates are so high is that "a large proportion of them live in
female-headed families."</p>
<p>The department also said:</p>
<p>-- After adjusting for inflation, median household income
rose 1.3% in 1989, to $28,910. Per-capita income grew 2.2% to
$14,060.</p>
<p>-- Male earnings fell 1.8% last year, after adjusting for
inflation, while female earnings rose 1.8%.</p>
<p>-- Four times as many children as elderly Americans lived
in poverty.</p>
