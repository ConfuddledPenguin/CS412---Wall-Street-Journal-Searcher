	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A Senate committee approved a bill revising
the 1983 Orphan Drug Act, including a provision to alter a
monopoly bestowed by the federal government on the maker of
an anti-pneumonia drug for AIDS patients.
   The drug, pentamadine, is manufactured by Lyphomed, a unit
of Japan-based Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., whose U.S.
headquarters are in Deerfield, Ill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lyphomed doesn't have a patent for pentamadine. But under
the 1983 law, the company has exclusive rights to market the
drug to AIDS patients with pneumocystis carinii pneumonia,
and to HIV-positive patients with T-cell counts below 200.
The orphan-drug designation is designed to encourage drug
companies to market drugs for rare diseases.</p>
<p>Under the bill, passed on a voice vote yesterday by the
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, Lyphomed would
retain exclusivity rights for the drug as long as its patient
population remained below 200,000. But if the population grew
beyond 200,000, Lyphomed would lose its exclusivity rights.
The number of HIV-positive patients who may require
pentamadine is believed to be approaching 200,000. The
committee's bill, which is identical to a version passed in
the House, is expected to move quickly through the full
Senate.</p>
<p>Proposed changes initially sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman
(D., Calif.) would have eliminated three monopolies granted
to Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.; Genentech, San
Francisco; and Lyphomed. But after intense lobbying by Amgen
and Genentech, their products were exempted from the bill.</p>
<p>Brian Tambi, president and chief operating officer of
Fujisawa's U.S. operations, said the company had been
"singled out in this bill," adding that pharmaceutical
companies in the future would be "extremely careful in
relying on government inducements and commitments."</p>
