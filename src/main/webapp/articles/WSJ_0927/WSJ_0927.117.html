	<p class="article-leader">UnionFed Financial Corp. said it will restate its fiscal
year 1990 results and report "a significant loss" compared
with previously reported profit of $11.1 million, or $1.60 a
share, in the year ended June 30.
   The restatement is due mainly to "substantial additional
provisions for possible losses on loans and real estate" made
"in connection with current examinations" of Union Federal
Savings Bank by the Office of Thrift Supervision and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the company said. Union
Federal Savings, the principal subsidiary of Brea,
Calif.-based UnionFed, has 27 branches in Southern
California.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Additional loss reserves are needed because of a "further
deterioration in real estate markets and a significantly more
conservative approach to valuations of real estate and real
estate secured loans . . . based in part on more conservative
federal regulatory valuation estimates and assumptions,"
UnionFed said in a brief statement issued Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Company executives were in meetings yesterday and weren't
available to discuss the expected size of the loss or to
answer any other questions.</p>
<p>UnionFed shares lost almost half their market value
yesterday, skidding $2.25 to $2.50 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares have plummeted from a high of
$19.50 this year.</p>
