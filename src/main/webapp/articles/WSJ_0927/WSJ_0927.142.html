	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush is expected to ask Congress
to approve an immediate $7.5 billion arms sale to Saudi
Arabia, administration officials said.
   The sale, expected to include modern tanks, armored
personnel carriers and anti-tank missiles, would be the first
portion of a package of over $20 billion publicly debated
here in recent days.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Originally, the administration hoped to submit the entire
package -- including items with a longer delivery time, such
as jet fighters. But supporters of Israel complained that the
huge sale might endanger that nation, so the administration
has decided to seek urgent items now and defer the rest until
early next year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Turkey's President Turgut Ozal said his nation
would support "armed intervention" against Iraq if it becomes
necessary, provided the action is approved by the United
Nations.</p>
<p>At a breakfast here with reporters, Mr. Ozal was asked
whether Turkey would remain neutral in any war by the U.S.
and its allies against Iraq. He said military force should be
considered only if the economic embargo fails. But he added:
"If the United Nations decides on the armed intervention, we
will not be against it." He contrasted that stand with
Turkey's neutrality in the Iran-Iraq war.</p>
<p>Mr. Ozal's comment was the second in two days by a major
power hinting that a U.N.-sanctioned military strike against
Iraq would be supported if the embargo fails. On Tuesday,
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze warned Baghdad
that the U.N. has the power to "suppress acts of aggression"
through force.</p>
<p>Separately, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said the
Persian Gulf crisis may be entering a period of "danger" in
which Saddam Hussein "may seek to use his military force to
try to break the stranglehold that the embargo has imposed."</p>
<p>He said the administration is determined "to see to it
that we send enough forces over there so that we don't leave
them exposed and at the end of a long supply line and
increase the risk to any higher level than is warranted." He
asserted, "The president believes in what I describe as the
`don't screw around' school of military strategy."</p>
<p>And Secretary of State James Baker disclosed that Iraq has
demanded from the U.S. and other nations a list of
nondiplomats being sheltered in their embassies in Baghdad.
Mr. Baker said Iraq has threatened to execute Americans and
others who hide such people, adding: "We've received a note
to that effect. It falls under the heading of the principle
of the three R's, I think -- we've read it, it's repugnant
and we reject it."</p>
<p>The latest phase of the economic embargo against Iraq,
which covers air traffic, got off to a confused start. Jordan
continued to receive Iraqi passenger flights. The State
Department said flights involving only passengers might not
be covered by the embargo but should be barred by an earlier
U.N. ban on financial transactions with Iraq. Jordan said it
was reviewing the passenger flights, and U.S. officials said
the U.N. might have to clarify the passenger-flight issue.
Mr. Cheney said the U.S. military hasn't been asked to
enforce the air embargo and he doesn't expect that it will do
so.</p>
<p>Also, Kuwait's minister of oil and finance, Sheik Ali
Khalifa al-Sabah, said he believes little more can be done to
pressure Iraq short of using military force. "It's time
either for Iraq to bend to the will of the world or be faced
with the military option," he said.</p>
<p>But Mr. Ozal stressed that the use of force isn't imminent
and that the world should wait at least three or four months
to see if the embargo can force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
He said the U.S. hadn't asked Turkey to join in a military
strike and added: "I don't want to speculate more about it."</p>
<p>A Turkish role in any military action would be crucial as
Turkey borders Iraq and has a powerful army trained by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr. Ozal said "Turkey is
on the side of the Western world in this problem."</p>
<p>The U.S. Export-Import Bank is expected today to clear a
$1.37 billion loan guarantee to help Turkey purchase 200
military-type helicopters. The helicopters would come from
the Sikorsky Aircraft Division of United Technologies Corp.,
Hartford, Conn., or other U.S. suppliers. The loan guarantee,
which would be the largest single financial transaction in
the history of the U.S. export credit agency, was tentatively
cleared earlier, and Ex-Im Bank officials said the bank's
board now could give it final approval because the House and
Senate Banking committees haven't raised any objections
during a mandatory 25-day review period.</p>
<p>Mr. Ozal, who met with President Bush Tuesday, said he
doubts Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will be overthrown in a
coup because of his control over Iraqi society. But he added
that he thought the Iraqi leader would be ousted if he is
forced to give up Kuwait. Because of that, he said,
withdrawal will be "very difficult" for Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Ozal said, Iraq can be forced to move,
and the embargo might work. He said it is worth trying
because it is unprecedented in history.</p>
<p>Mr. Ozal said the Kuwaiti rulers might lack popular
support in their own nation if a referendum were held. But he
said it would be a "grave mistake" to offer any concessions
to Iraq in return for a pullout from Kuwait as that would
encourage aggression by others and turn the "new world order"
into a "jungle."</p>
<p>The Turkish leader said his nation is suffering
economically from the crisis and hasn't yet received promised
compensation. But he stressed that the financial plight of
Turkey has been "exaggerated" in the press, causing a few
banks to be unwilling to roll over short-term export
financing. He said Turkey would survive the crisis
economically and shouldn't be lumped together with much
poorer states as Egypt and Jordan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Treasury issued licensing regulations for
the export of donated food to Iraq and Kuwait. The department
said it will grant export licenses for food shipments "to
relieve human suffering" on a case-by-case basis but only
after the U.N. has approved each donation. It said such aid
must be provided by humanitarian agencies under U.N.
auspices.</p>
<p>So far, the Treasury has had only two inquiries about food
licenses, said Richard Newcomb, director of the office of
foreign assets control.</p>
