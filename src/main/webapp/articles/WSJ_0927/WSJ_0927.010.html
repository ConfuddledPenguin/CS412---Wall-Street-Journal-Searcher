	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY, Australia -- News Corp.'s short-term borrowings
soared 34% in the year ended June 30 and Rupert Murdoch,
chief executive officer, has conceded that his international
media concern must trim the debt load.
   The annual report shows that interest-bearing debt jumped
to 10.53 billion Australian dollars (US$8.77 billion) in
fiscal 1990 from A$7.87 billion a year earlier. Short-term
debt (due within one year) soared to A$2.95 billion from
A$508.7 million. Longer-term borrowings rose to A$7.58
billion from A$7.36 billion. News Corp. also has A$1.41
billion in preference shares issued through units; including
these securities, debt totals A$11.94 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a speech to investors in New York on Monday, Mr.
Murdoch, who controls 45% of News Corp.'s shares, said the
company has "too much short-term debt" and is examining ways
to refinance the borrowings. Mainly, though, "We plan to get
our debt down with earnings from our assets" in the next few
years, he said.</p>
<p>The company has been selling some assets in an effort to
damp the rise in debt. But it also is investing billions of
dollars in color printing presses for newspapers in Britain
and Australia, the Sky Television satellite-TV operation in
Britain, and the Fox Broadcasting Co. TV-programming service
in the U.S.</p>
