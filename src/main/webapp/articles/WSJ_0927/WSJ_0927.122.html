	<p class="article-leader">James P. Lennane, a Naples, Fla., investor, said in a
Sept. 26 letter sent to ASK Computer Systems Inc.'s chairman
that he intends to seek control of ASK's board.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Mr. Lennane said he has filed preliminary proxy materials
with the SEC to be in a position to seek control through a
solicitation of proxies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An ASK spokeswoman said the Mountain View, Calif., company
was examining the materials and had no comment.</p>
<p>In the letter, Mr. Lennane also criticized the board for
failure to submit for holder approval the issuance of shares
representing almost 42% of ASK's common stock outstanding to
finance, in part, ASK's acquisition of Ingres Corp.</p>
<p>According to the filing, Mr. Lennane has also begun legal
proceedings in the Chancery Court of Delaware seeking to
enjoin the completion of the issuance of shares and the
acquisition, pending its submission to, and approval by, a
vote of the ASK shareholders. Mr. Lennane now holds 9.67% of
ASK's common outstanding.</p>
