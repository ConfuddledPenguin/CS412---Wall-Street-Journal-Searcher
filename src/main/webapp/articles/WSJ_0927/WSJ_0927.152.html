	<p class="article-leader">Shares of MCA Inc. surged $7.25 a share to close at $61.25
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, based on a
series of rumors suggesting that MCA's talks to be acquired
by Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. were progressing
rapidly.
   However, MCA issued a statement after the close of trading
that merely repeated its confirmation on Tuesday that it is
talking about a friendly buy-out with a "major international
company" which it didn't identify. MCA, based in Universal
City, Calif., said it issued the statement after the Big
Board asked if there were any corporate developments that
would explain the jump in MCA shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>People familiar with the discussions have said that
Tokyo-based Matsushita could pay between $80 and $90 a share
for MCA, or a total of $7.4 billion to $8.3 billion.</p>
<p>Several takeover stock traders attributed the surge in MCA
shares just before the close to a panic among professional
traders who want to own big positions in MCA if a deal is
announced soon. "People are trying to make a whole year's
profit on this one deal. They're afraid that the train is
leaving the station," said one takeover-stock trader.</p>
