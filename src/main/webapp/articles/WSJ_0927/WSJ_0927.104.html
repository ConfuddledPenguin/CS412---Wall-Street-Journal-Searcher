	<p class="article-leader">Two big Canadian newsprint producers matched price
increases announced Monday by Stone Container Corp.
   Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd., Montreal, and
MacMillan Bloedel Ltd., Vancouver, British Columbia, said
they will raise newsprint prices about 5% effective Jan. 1.
As reported previously, Chicago-based Stone Container said it
will raise its benchmark Eastern U.S. list price for
newsprint by $35 a metric ton, or 5.1%, to $720 a metric ton
effective Jan. 1. Stone Container raised prices by similar
amounts in other markets. A metric ton equals 2,204.6 pounds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts and industry executives expect other companies to
match the increases. Most major North American newsprint
concerns raised prices about 5% in June.</p>
