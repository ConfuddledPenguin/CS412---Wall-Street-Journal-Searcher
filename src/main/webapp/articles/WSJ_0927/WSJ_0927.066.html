	<p class="article-leader">ST. LOUIS -- Anheuser-Busch Cos. said it decided to
proceed with previously announced plans to build a $300
million theme park and resort in Spain, but "only with the
equity involvement of international developers or partners."
   The brewing concern said last year it planned to build the
park, on Spain's Costa Brava, on its own. But earlier this
year, it said the plans had been placed "on hold," after
problems arose with municipal officials in the region.
Anheuser said yesterday that "progress has been made toward
an agreement" between the company and the two municipalities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Madrid, Javier de la Rosa, best known in Spain for his
links with the Kuwait Investment Office, said he has offered
to lead a group of investors taking an 80% stake in a revised
project valued at 40 billion pesetas ($406.1 million). He
said through a spokesman that final details haven't been
settled, but that the plan is for Anheuser to remain in the
project with a 20% stake and act as a technical adviser. An
adviser to the Kuwait Investment Office and partner in its
Spanish holding company, Grupo Torras S.A., Mr. de la Rosa
controls 55% of the Barcelona amusement park known as
Tibidabo.</p>
<p>An Anheuser spokesman said: "We haven't signed a
definitive partnership agreement with anyone. We have held
preliminary discussions with interested parties, and, as a
matter of corporate policy, we can't comment on any ongoing
discussions with any party."</p>
<p>Anheuser said its total investment to date in the project
is $90 million, of which $50 million is in land. To complete
the site acquisition, the company said, could require an
additional $30 million.</p>
<p>Under the initial plan, Anheuser envisioned spending an
additional $275 million in a possible second phase that would
begin after the turn of the century.</p>
