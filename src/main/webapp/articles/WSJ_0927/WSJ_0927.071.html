	<p class="article-leader">Call it chemical attack, call it one of the biggest drug
deals in history. Both are true. On Sept. 13, Philip Morris
announced that it will supply the Soviet Union with more than
20 billion cigarettes by the end of 1991. A company news
release proudly described it as "the largest single export
order in the company's history." RJR Nabisco will send a
further 14 billion. After the first 20 billion cigarettes
from Philip Morris, the company will continue to supply
"significant quantities of cigarettes" between 1992 and 1995,
also technical assistance to help modernized Soviet cigarette
factories.
   Philip Morris declines to put a value on its share of the
drug deal. Robert Kaplan, a spokesman for the company,
refused to name a figure to my colleague Richard McKerrow,
though he did volunteer that "it's a very nice deal for us.
It firmly establishes us in the Soviet Union and Russian
Republic and gets us into the East European fold in a way we
haven't been before." The company has been selling in
hard-currency and duty-free Russian shops for 20 years but
never before have Marlboros and kindred brands been available
to local citizens. Asked about the ethics of encouraging
smoking in the Soviet Union, Mr. Kaplan said, "We're
answering a call for help, something we're quite happy to do.
We have a position that adults have a right to make decisions
about the risks of smoking."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. shipments replace a shortfall in domestically
produced cigarettes in the Soviet Union, and in the estimate
(which he calls conservative) of Dr. John Seffrin, chairman
of the National Board of Directors of the American Cancer
Society, the 7,000 Russians who would have been killed by the
home product will now perish from the substitute U.S.
imports. More grimly, Dr. Richard Peto, director of Oxford
Unversity's Cancer Studies Unit, believes that "after the
full death rates from smoking appear in a country, then, for
every 34 billion cigarettes, about 34,000 will be killed by
their habit." Soviet youths find American commodities chic
and will no doubt delight in puffing their Marlboros during
the three-hour wait in line at the Moscow McDonalds. Dr.
Seffrin believes that the Morris/R.J. Reynolds sale "could
end up in the addiction of countless millions of children who
don't now smoke."</p>
<p>The consequences of tobacco addiction in the Soviet Union
are already very bad. Out of a population of about 300
million there are 120 million smokers, according to Dr. David
Zaridze, vice director of All Union Cancer Research Center in
Moscow, who is attending a conference with Dr. Peto in
Oxford. Dr. Peto says that "if you look at the pattern of
deaths, smoking is having a larger impact in the Soviet Union
than in many other places." He estimates that roughly 30% of
all deaths in the U.S.S.R. in 1987 of people between ages 35
and 59 resulted from tobacco. In Mikhail Gorbachev's age
range -- 55 to 64 -- the male lung-cancer rate in Russia is
now about 25% higher than in the U.S.</p>
<p>Bad though the situation is, Dr. Zaridze says there is
"room for things to get worse," and that sales by U.S.
tobacco companies "will not be helpful in fighting smoking in
the Soviet Union. Smoking an American cigarette is still a
positive image in the Soviet Union."</p>
<p>The surge in tobacco-induced deaths in the Soviet Union
will be mirrored elsewhere in the world. Dr. Peto calculates
that if current trends continue, the number of these
tobacco-induced deaths world-wide will rise from a rate today
of 2.5 million a year to 10 million a year in the 2020s. This
past April, a consultative group mustered by the World Health
Organization and chaired by Dr. Peto reported that of these
prospective 10 million annual deaths, about seven million
will be in the developing world. This rate of 10 million
estimated for the second quarter of the 21st century means,
according to Dr. Peto, that "over 200 million of today's
children and teenagers will eventually be killed by tobacco."</p>
<p>Faced with a decline in tobacco addiction in developed
countries (down 9% in the U.S. and 25% in the U.K. between
1970 and 1985, according to the British medical journal The
Lancet) giant cigarette cartels are targeting the Third
World, using their advertising clout and political muscle to
carve open new markets in such countries as Japan, Taiwan and
South Korea. In South Korea, smoking rates among teenage
girls quadrupled (1.6% to 8.7%) and among teen-age boys
nearly doubled (18% to 30%) after the entry of U.S. brands.</p>
<p>Today the U.S. government is actively persecuting Thailand
for its resistance to foreign cigarette imports, according to
the Bangkok Post, and is preparing a list of Thai products
that will be embargoed until Thailand opens its market to
U.S. cigarettes and, more importantly, permits advertising of
same. The U.S. Trade Representative has taken the tobacco
companies' case to GATT.</p>
<p>So here we have the macabre absurdity of the U.S.
government on the one hand actively promoting the export of a
drug -- tobacco -- certain to cause millions of deaths, while
on the other waging war against another drug peril, puny in
comparison.</p>
<p>For a whiff of the double standard, consider two newspaper
headlines: July 19, in the Asheville Citizen Times, "Quayle:
Open Up New World Markets for Tobacco"; Aug. 9, in the Los
Angeles Times, "Quayle Appeals to Peru for Help in War on
Drugs." The vice president told Peruvians that "an
anti-narcotics program is critical. It's a must . . . You are
losing your children . . . just like we are losing our
children." Three weeks earlier, Mr. Quayle was telling North
Carolinians that while "the American public as a whole is
smoking less. . . . We ought to think about the exports" and
that while "we're not going to back away from what public
health officials say . . . we're not going to deny a country
an export from our country because of that policy." In April,
James Mason, assistant secretary to the Department of Health
and Human Services, called it "unconscionable" for tobacco
companies to be "peddling their poison abroad." A month
later, the White House prevented him from testifying on the
Hill about the health consequences of U.S. tobacco exports.</p>
<p>Since the Russians invited the cigarette shipments it's
probably technically imprecise to call these imports chemical
warfare. But the effects will be the same, and indeed the
5,000 Kurds dead in Saddam Hussein's onslaught did not have
to pay for the poisons that slaughtered them and the
catastrophe was brutally finite, rather than continuing to
kill people far into the next century, filling hospitals year
after year with the sick and the dying.</p>
<p>So much for the crusade against drugs. As any cynical
narcotrafficante would no doubt be happy to point out, all
America is actually doing is consolidating its position as
the biggest dealer in addictive and lethal substances on the
planet, waging war on all rivals, whether they take the form
of the Thai domestic tobacco industry or the Colombian
cocaine cartels.</p>
