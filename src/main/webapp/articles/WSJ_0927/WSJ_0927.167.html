	<p class="article-leader">BUSH IS EXPECTED to request approval for a $7.5 billion
Saudi arms sale.
   The sale would be the first portion of a $20 billion
package that has stirred debate in Washington. Meanwhile, the
U.N. air embargo against Iraq got off to a confused start as
Jordan received Iraqi passenger flights. U.S. officials said
the U.N. might have to clarify the passenger-flight issue. In
Washington, Turkey's Ozal said he would support "armed
intervention" against Iraq, if it becomes necessary, provided
the action is cleared by the U.N. Cheney warned that Saddam
Hussein may try to use military force to break the
"stranglehold" of an international embargo.</p>

nondiplomats sheltered in embassies in Baghdad. Baker said
Iraq threatened to kill Americans and others who hide such
people.</p>

<p>The Pentagon said it will withdraw 40,000 troops from
Europe in the next fiscal year in anticipation of a
conventional arms-control treaty. Separately, Baker and
Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze met in New York in a bid
to overcome differences concerning the treaty.</p>

<p>The Soviet parliament formally ended decades of religious
repression, giving overwhelming initial approval to a law on
freedom of conscience. The law forbids the government from
interfering with religious activities, improves the legal
status of religious groups and permits citizens to study
religion in homes and private schools.</p>
<p>Soviet Defense Minister Yazov responded to reports of
suspicious troop movements in the Moscow area, telling
legislators that the army wasn't plotting a coup. He said the
troops were helping with the harvest and rehearsing for a
parade.</p>

<p>U.S. consumers pay doctors more than twice as much as
Canadians do for the same amount of health services, a study
said, citing higher fees charged by U.S. doctors. But those
fees don't translate to comparably higher incomes because
U.S. doctors have higher overhead costs and a lighter
workload.</p>

<p>A group of armed Mohawks surrendered to the Canadian Army,
ending an 11-week siege that grew out of a land dispute in a
town west of Montreal. The Indians had been holed up in an
alcohol treatment center, surrounded by soldiers and police.</p>

<p>President de Klerk arrived home with support from Bush for
Pretoria's efforts to end its system of racial segregation
and white dominance, but some South Africans criticized the
U.S. trip. An African National Congress spokesman said
American officials were mistaken in calling progress toward
ending apartheid irreversible.</p>

<p>An experiment found that women who are more than five
years past menopause need to consume at least 800 milligrams
of calcium a day to keep their bone loss at a minimum. The
scientists said that calcium-rich foods, such as dairy
products, were the best way to boost calcium consumption.</p>

<p>Indian students ignored Prime Minister Singh's offer for
talks, and riots spread across northern India to protest a
policy that reserves nearly half of government jobs for
low-caste Hindus. Police officers shot and killed seven
people in three cities, including New Delhi, as Singh said he
would rather resign than rescind the policy.</p>

<p>Tuition increases moderated at private colleges to 8% from
9% last year, a development that analysts said was linked to
slackened demand and schools' worries over allegations that
they charge too much. Public-school increases of 7% were
unchanged.</p>

<p>U.S. Marines flew emergency food and medical supplies into
Liberia's capital as a cease-fire held for the fifth day.
Monrovia has been without electricity, running water and
phone service for three months, and few food supplies have
reached the city.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A study revealed that fewer than 10% of U.S. high school
seniors have the skills to perform demanding jobs or do
college work. A comparison of test results for the fourth,
eighth and 12th grades shows that schools are doing a worse
job of teaching reading, mathematics and science than they
were 20 years ago.</p>

<p>Hungary's center-right coalition outlined a three-year
plan to dismantle the nation's centralized economy and
replace it with one governed by market forces. Legislative
approval of the program is expected.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia's vendors staged a brief nationwide strike
to protest the government's plan to sell their shops in
auctions. The scheduled sale will be the first step in a
comprehensive privatization process.</p>

<p>Died: Alberto Moravia, 82, Italian author of novels,
including "The Woman of Rome," who was censored by Fascist
and Vatican authorities, in Rome, of a heart attack.</p>
