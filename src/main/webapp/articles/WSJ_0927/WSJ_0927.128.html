	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- North Korea and South Korea agreed in
principle to link their separate air-traffic control systems
and allow airlines to fly over their heavily militarized
border.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization said the two
Koreas, China and Japan agreed to a new, shorter air route
linking Tokyo and Beijing that will cross over both Koreas,
cutting a four-hour flight to about three hours. The
organization said about six airlines regularly fly the
Tokyo-Beijing route.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Assad Kotaite, president of the aviation organization,
based here, said he first approached the four nations in
1981, but, until this summer, political differences made an
agreement impossible. "The political climate is much better
now," he said.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, North Korean and South Korean
air-traffic controllers will for the first time talk to each
other regularly. The two countries will set up a permanent
voice link so that, as planes cross their border, a
controller in one Korea can "hand off" a flight to a
counterpart in the other Korea.</p>
<p>All four countries involved will sign a memorandum of
understanding later this fall. The aviation organization also
will coordinate a meeting between North Korean and South
Korean officials to settle technical details, after which the
two nations will sign a separate operational agreement. The
organization said the new route could open by year end.</p>
