	<p class="article-leader">DANBURY, Conn. -- Kollmorgen Corp. said a $20 million
contract its Electro-Optical Division received last April to
supply periscopes was terminated by the customer.
   The company wouldn't disclose the name of the customer. It
said the customer chose to terminate the contract under a
clause in the agreement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kollmorgen said that because it has spent "very little"
money on the contract, the termination won't have any adverse
financial impact on the company. Kollmorgen makes periscopes
for the U.S. Navy and for military customers in other
countries.</p>
