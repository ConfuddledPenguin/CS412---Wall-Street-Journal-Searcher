	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The tiny Baltic Futures Exchange plans to merge
with the London Futures and Options Exchange to regenerate
slack business.
   Volume on the Baltic Futures Exchange, which trades grain,
potatoes, freight futures and other commodities, is less than
a tenth of the four million to five million contracts traded
on what is informally called the London "Fox."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>London's commodity markets are the largest in Europe, but
are small when compared with those in New York and Chicago.</p>
<p>"By merging with London Fox we will be able to develop our
existing contracts and expand into new areas," said Pat
Elmer, chairman of the Baltic Futures Exchange. London Fox
actively trades coffee, cocoa and sugar and has launched
several contracts on an automated trading system.</p>
<p>Saxon Tate, chairman of London Fox, said the Baltic
contracts have "great potential." If members of both
exchanges approve the merger, the markets will have greater
resources for future development, he said.</p>
<p>London Fox plans to launch an Arabica coffee futures
contract to trade alongside futures on the lower-quality
robusta coffee. It is also examining the possibility of
contracts in property and electricity futures, and is
considering links with Japanese futures markets, the exchange
said.</p>
