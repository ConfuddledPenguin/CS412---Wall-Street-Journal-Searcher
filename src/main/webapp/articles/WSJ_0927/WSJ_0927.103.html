	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Witco Corp., a specialty chemicals and
petroleum company, said that it plans to sell its Richardson
Co. subsidiary, a maker of injection molded plastic and
rubber battery containers and accessories, and that it
engaged Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. to assist in the
sale.
   In 1989, Richardson had sales of $66.3 million. Witco had
sales of $798 million for the six months ended June 30. A
Witco spokesman said the Richardson business, part of an
acquisition made in the early 1980s, "doesn't fit our
strategic core businesses" and might be more appropriate for
a battery maker or injection molding company.</p>
