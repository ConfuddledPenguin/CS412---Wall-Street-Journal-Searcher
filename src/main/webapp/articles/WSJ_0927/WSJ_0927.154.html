	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A House Appropriations subcommittee approved
continued covert aid to anti-government forces in Afghanistan
but withheld half of the estimated $300 million sought by the
Central Intelligence Agency until a vote next spring.
   The action follows an appeal by CIA Director William
Webster at a closed-door meeting Tuesday after the
subcommittee's bipartisan leadership recommended that no new
money be approved for the prolonged war.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The outcome is a victory for supporters of the guerrillas,
but the restrictions reflect new skepticism in the panel,
which has been one of the strongest advocates of aid in the
past.</p>
<p>The subcommittee's decision came as part of deliberations
on an underlying defense and intelligence appropriations bill
for the fiscal year beginning Monday. Among major weapons
systems, the measure would provide an estimated $350 million
in advanced procurement funding for the Navy's 18th Trident
submarine, made by General Dynamics Corp.'s Electric Boat
division. Still, the funding represents a deep cut from the
$1.2 billion authorized by the House.</p>
