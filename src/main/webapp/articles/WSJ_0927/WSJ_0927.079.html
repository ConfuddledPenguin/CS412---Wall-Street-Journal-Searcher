	<p class="article-leader">Washington just relived a famous scene from an Indiana
Jones movie. Shrouded in black, the bad guy brandished his
scimitar expertly, seemingly poised to do great damage to our
hero. Jones shrugged, pulled out his gun, and shot the
villain down. This is about what happened to stunned Members
of Congress on Tuesday when New Hampshire Sununu pulled out a
copy of the Anti-Deficiency Act.
   The White House Chief of Staff announced that if there is
no budget deal, President Bush is ready to veto any
continuing resolution and go directly to the Gramm-Rudman
budget cuts. There will be no melodramatic apocalyse for the
evening newscasts because Mr. Bush, under his authority in
the Anti-Deficiency Act, can manage the sequester to avoid
chaos.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As we wrote Tuesday, the Anti-Deficiency Act is the law
that says Congress must approve all government expenditures,
but with one huge exception: The President can order
expenditures "in cases of emergency involving the safety of
human life or the protection of property." This gives Mr.
Bush great discretion to keep paying essential government
workers even when Congress fails to write a budget.</p>
<p>Mr. Sununu took to Capitol Hill a 12-page interpretation
of the Anti-Deficiency Act written by Jimmy Carter's Attorney
General, Benjamin Civiletti, in 1981. The end-is-nigh media
reports warn that Gramm-Rudman would mean havoc in the skies
from fewer air-traffic controllers, a vegetarian diet for
Americans from the furloughing of meat inspectors, the
rending of garments, and the weeping and gnashing of teeth.
Nonsense. As examples of where "life" or "property" are so at
risk that the President can keep people at their jobs, Mr.
Civiletti's memo cited air traffic and meat inspection.</p>
<p>There is nothing in Gramm-Rudman that limits the
President's emergency powers under the pre-existing
Anti-Deficiency Act. White House budget officials are
probably now reviewing which workers are essential and which
can be sent home. The Reagan administration went through this
drill when it kept essential workers on even after vetoing
continuing resolutions. Military personnel, the FBI and
federal prison guards are clearly necessary to protect life
and property. Congressional staffers most likely come under a
different heading. Some things, of course, cannot be
protected: It's hard to imagine the threat to life or
property from closing down the office that sends out
Congress's franked mail.</p>
<p>There are some other improvements Mr. Bush could make to
the distribution of cuts under Gramm-Rudman. Education, Labor
and the EPA are among the agencies scheduled for sequester
cuts of less than 5%. Maybe when a budget is eventually
passed these agencies can contribute to a fund to pay air
traffic controllers.</p>
<p>The Monday deadline for Gramm-Rudman is where
separation-of-powers hits the rubber. "As the law is now
written, the nation must rely initially for the efficient
operation of government on the timely and responsible
functioning of the legislative process," Mr. Civiletti wrote
in his memo. "The Constitution and the Anti-Deficiency Act
itself leave the Executive leeway to perform essential
functions and make the government `workable.'"</p>
<p>There is fine justice in the prospect of Congress losing
control over the budget because of its recidivist failure to
pass budgets within legal deadlines. Mr. Bush has every right
and even an obligation to use his Anti-Deficiency Act powers
to avoid any mindless sequester. Congress can agree to a
budget that guarantees spending cuts and creates incentives
for economic growth. Or it can watch Mr. Bush solve the
budget deficit on his own.</p>
