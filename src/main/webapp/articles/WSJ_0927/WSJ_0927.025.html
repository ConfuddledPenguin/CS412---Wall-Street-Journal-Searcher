	<p class="article-leader">Gregory Peck (Letters, Sept. 12) tries to defend himself
against Paul A. Gigot's charge that People for the American
Way "paid Gregory Peck to smear Judge Bork." Not so, cries
the offended Mr. Peck. "It is not true that I was paid."
Well, half a defense is better than none, I suppose, and I
for one am quite willing to believe him.
   Indeed, Mr. Peck has been a tireless supporter of
left-wing causes for, by his own account, "more than 40
years." He has been among the most reliable of Hollywood's
corps of trained seals, ever ready to spout whatever, from
time to time, the left needs to have spouted. And so he was
in Judge Bork's case: His charges of racial intolerance,
solemnly intoned in that golden voice, were defamatory and
false -- a smear by any definition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Worse, his explanation of why he did it -- what flaws in
Judge Bork's makeup justified his assault? -- bears a
disquieting resemblance to the intemperate mouthings of Teddy
Kennedy, kicking off the smear-Bork campaign.</p>
<p>Moreover, the moral sensibilities that Mr. Peck found
lacking in Judge Bork are precisely the kind of thing that
can have no proper part in judging, as David Souter recently
informed Sen. Kennedy and his colleagues on the Judiciary
Committee.</p>
<p>So Mr. Peck adds ignorance to arrogance, which should
(but, regrettably, probably won't) detract from his
credibility the next time Norman Lear, or some other
puppeteer, calls upon him.</p>
