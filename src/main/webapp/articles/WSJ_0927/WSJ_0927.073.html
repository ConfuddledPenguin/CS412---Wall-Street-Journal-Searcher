	<p class="article-leader">Tuition increases at private colleges moderated to 8% from
9% a year ago, a development that analysts tied to slackened
demand and schools' worries over allegations that they charge
too much.
   The slower rate of increase was too modest to be hailed as
the beginning of a broad trend. Public-school increases of 7%
were unchanged from a year ago. But some educators say
government and economic pressures could help keep increases
modest in Ivy League and other top-tier schools in coming
years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The average four-year private college raised tuition to
$9,391 from $8,663 this school year, the New York-based
College Board said in its annual tuition survey. The
admissions and testing group said private room-and-board
prices climbed 7% to $4,153. Four-year public tuition rose to
$1,809 from $1,696 for in-state residents, with
room-and-board up 5% to $3,161.</p>
<p>"I think schools are beginning to pay attention to what's
going on out there in terms of application declines and
public pressure about prices," said Arthur Hauptman, a
college consultant who specializes in educational finance.</p>
<p>Although no overall figures are available yet, many
colleges reported application declines for this year of 5% to
10%. This year's tuitions were also the first that were set
after the U.S. Justice Department announced a price-fixing
inquiry of about 55 private schools in August 1989.</p>
<p>"In part, colleges are reacting to the Justice Department
investigation," said Peter Roberts, president of the College
Savings Bank, in Princeton N.J.</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts, whose bank markets investments indexed to
tuition increases, says that the 55 schools under
investigation raised their tuitions by an average of only
7.8%, while 445 other schools in his data base went up by
8.4%. The group of 55 includes the eight Ivy League schools,
Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
and other schools with above-average prices.</p>
<p>After inflation, analysts noted, private tuition rose only
3.2% this year vs. about 4.5% a year ago. Even with this
slowdown, some top institutions are still charging rates that
exceed many Americans' annual incomes.</p>
<p>The College Board listed tuition, room and board charges
of $20,820 at Yale University, $20,655 at Harvard University,
$20,498 at Princeton University and $20,210 at Stanford
University. These schools say they have added to their own
financial aid awards to offset rising prices for lower-income
students.</p>
<p>David Breneman, a visiting professor at Harvard and former
president of Kalamazoo College, said that while the Justice
Department inquiry continues, it will have a moderating
effect on future increases at top schools. He said increases
in the 1980s of four to five percentage points above
consumer-price rises were an "aberration" that will be
corrected by economic forces such as consumer resistance.</p>
<p>Other analysts were split in their predictions. Mr.
Roberts, whose products' success depends in part on rising
tuitions, said he expects "a return to increases of about
twice the consumer price index" as government support for
private schools slackens in coming years.</p>
<p>But Mr. Hauptman said he sees a recession ahead, meaning
sharper increases at state schools, which rely heavily on
public subsidies and would suffer the most from government
spending cuts. Private colleges, however, may implement more
moderate increases, Mr. Hauptman said, because "they are more
market sensitive and have historically held the line" in
economic downturns.</p>
