	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The abandoned Shoreham nuclear power plant on
Long Island could profitably be converted to a natural-gas
facility, according to a study for the state agency that will
take over the facility.
   The plant, which was built by Long Island Lighting Co. but
mothballed when state officials refused to give necessary
clearances, is scheduled to be sold by Lilco for $1 to the
Long Island Power Authority. The study concludes that rather
than let the plant sit and crumble, it could be converted to
a gas-fired generating facility.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Richard M. Kessel, chairman of the power authority, said a
final decision on converting Shoreham could be reached by
next year. According to the study, Shoreham could be
converted to a nonnuclear unit for less than it would cost to
build a new plant at a new site.</p>
<p>Depending on a number of factors, the study said it would
cost about $715 million to convert Shoreham to a
1,351-megawatt natural gas-fired facility. The power
authority would have various financing options, ranging from
doing the conversion itself to farming it out.</p>
<p>After costing some $5.2 billion to build, the Shoreham
plant was forced to close because local opposition prevented
Lilco from meeting emergency standards for evacuation
procedures. Such procedures for the area were necessary in
the event of a nuclear disaster.</p>
