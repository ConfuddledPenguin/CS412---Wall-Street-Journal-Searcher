	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- The Canadian Auto Workers union set a strike
deadline of midnight EDT on Oct. 10 to reach a new contract
covering about 36,000 employees of the Canadian subsidiary of
General Motors Corp.
   Contract negotiations got under way yesterday, three days
after union members ratified a new three-year pact with Ford
Motor Co.'s Canadian unit, ending a nine-day strike.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CAW president Robert White said he expects GM to accept
about the same economic terms as those agreed upon with Ford.
That pact gives workers wage gains of 3% in the first year
and 2% in the second and third years, plus protection against
inflation. The Ford contract also includes more time off the
job, a vacation bonus and an income security package that
would take effect in the event of layoffs.</p>
<p>Frederick Curd, GM Canada's chief negotiator, called the
CAW's demands "expensive." He said, however, that GM could
accept the union's terms if the contract also provided a
"framework for improvements in {the company's} operational
efficiencies."</p>
<p>Mr. Curd said he hasn't yet tabled specific proposals to
improve GM's "cost competitiveness" in Canada. But he
identified certain areas where the company would like to make
progress. These include changing the union's system of job
classifications to create a more flexible work force. He also
said he would ask the union to help address attendance
problems at GM's Canadian plants, where absenteeism runs
about 4% higher than at U.S. plants.</p>
<p>The CAW's Mr. White said that, besides monetary issues,
the CAW would press for resolution of matters affecting
individual local union affiliates.</p>
