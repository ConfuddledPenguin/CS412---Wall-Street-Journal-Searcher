	<p class="article-leader">Your Sept. 20 editorial "A City Flounders" about my
mass-transit proposal does to facts what Cuisinart does to
onions, starting with the notion that I still chair the House
Budget Committee. I don't -- not since 1988.
   You think my provision is designed just to "support
Philadelphia's transit system." Actually, Pennsylvania has 38
transit authorities. All would benefit, which is why the idea
has drawn bipartisan support all around the state.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>You imply the provision is a response to Philadelphia's
fiscal woes. Wrong. For five years -- long before
Philadelphia's current crisis -- I've been urging
Pennsylvania and other states to establish a dedicated
funding source for mass transit. Every other state with a
major mass-transit system already has done so. That's why
Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner has called
dedicated state revenue an essential part of transit funding
-- and blasted Pennsylvania for lagging behind.</p>
<p>Would my provision be a "pre-emption of state tax policy
by Congress?" Absolutely not. It purposely leaves the state
to decide how to come up with dedicated revenue. It doesn't
mandate a tax increase. Pennsylvania could make a multiyear
commitment from general revenue -- as New York has done -- or
use an existing fee such as vehicle registration.</p>
<p>Actually, with dedicated revenue, transit authorities
would be much better off even if Pennsylvania didn't give
transit another nickel. They could then issue bonds against
what would be a guaranteed income stream and leverage their
funding resources up to 10 times. That's a move your readers
should understand -- even if it's too complicated for your
editorial writers.</p>
<p>Finally, let's look at the wildest misstatement of all:
that this provision constitutes "blackmail . . . liberalism's
ultimate urban policy."</p>
<p>What hypocrisy. Did you cry blackmail when Republicans
threatened to withhold federal funds to influence the
District of Columbia's abortion policy? What about the
provision in this same transportation spending bill that
withholds highway funds unless states suspend the licenses of
convicted drug offenders?</p>
<p>I'm aware that editorials are opinion pieces -- but I wish
we could get back to the days when opinions were based on
fact.</p>
