	<p class="article-leader">I join Tim W. Ferguson in applauding Walter Minnick's
argument that our nation's efforts to achieve environmental
goals should be built on sound economic policy ("Business
World," Sept. 18). Economists know that protectionism
promotes inefficiency and waste. Environmentalists should
heed Mr. Minnick's warning that a domestic timber industry
propped up by trade restrictions and other government
subsidies won't "save" old forests -- or new forests -- for
long.
   Unfortunately, Mr. Ferguson has reported one very
important statistic incorrectly. U.S. forestry companies do
not rely on public lands for the bulk of their timber supply.
According to the Agriculture Department, the national forests
now account for 13%, and all other federal and state lands
account for 7%, of the annual wood harvested in the U.S.
Nevertheless, each year up to one-half of Forest Service
timber placed on the market is sold at prices that do not
recover the government's costs of growing and selling the
trees. In 1989, such below-cost timber sales cost federal
taxpayers at least $365 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This strange outcome reflects the fact that Forest Service
managers are rewarded for gross timber receipts, acres logged
and local jobs "created," not for habitat protected or
taxpayer dollars saved. Until these perverse incentives are
changed, the Forest Service will continue destroying the
environment and undercutting investments in private-sector
forestry.</p>
