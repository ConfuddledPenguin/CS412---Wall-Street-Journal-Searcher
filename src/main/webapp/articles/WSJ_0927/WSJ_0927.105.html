	<p class="article-leader">SAN DIEGO -- Leading California Republicans are seriously
thinking about endorsing a ballot proposal that would limit
the time elected officials can spend in office.
   U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson, the Republican candidate for
governor, won't actually say he'll endorse such a proposal,
but he smiles knowingly when asked about it. "It's too early
to tell," he says. His aides privately suggest he'll do it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Outgoing GOP Gov. George Deukmejian is also getting ready
to take a stand. Insiders say he too will support a
term-limitation proposal as "a final slap" at Assembly
Speaker Willie Brown, his Democratic nemesis during the
governor's eight years in office.</p>
<p>If these leading Republicans climb aboard, it would give
added impetus to an idea that is beginning to sweep across
the country. Earlier this month Oklahoma voters, by a margin
of more than two to one, approved a constitutional amendment
barring future members of their Legislature from serving more
than 12 years in office. A similar proposal is on the
November ballot in Colorado.</p>
<p>Speaker Brown, one of California's leading rainmakers, is
busily raising as much as $5 million for television ads aimed
at defeating the term-limitation idea. He argues that
"sleazy, cold-blooded special interests" are supporting the
initiatives because, if passed, lobbyists would dominate
"inexperienced rookie" officeholders. Mr. Brown has been an
assemblyman for 26 years and speaker for 10.</p>
<p>There are actually two term-limitation proposals on the
Nov. 6 ballot and so far both parties have kept their
distance, mindful that if either proposal should be approved
by the voters, incumbents on both sides of the aisle would
face political extinction.</p>
<p>There's no chance Democrats -- whose ticket is led this
year by their candidate for governor, former San Francisco
mayor Dianne Feinstein -- will support either proposal. They
have too much to lose. But for the Republicans, badly
outnumbered by Democratic officeholders, it's hard to resist.
They can't help but note that each of the term-limitation
proposals is drawing more than a 65% approval rating in the
public-opinion polls (but at a time when Speaker Brown's TV
ads have yet to go on the air).</p>
<p>The proposal they're getting ready to support is called
Proposition 140, one of 28 complicated initiatives on the
ballot. It would limit statewide officeholders and state
senators to two consecutive four-year terms. Members of the
Assembly would be forced to step down after three two-year
terms. Their goodbyes would be final, for they could never
seek the same office again. "It's a lifetime ban," says
Speaker Brown. "You can get convicted of a felony and not
have a lifetime ban."</p>
<p>The proposition, the brainchild of Los Angeles County
Supervisor Peter Schabarum, would also strip $70 million from
the state Legislature's $190 million budget and reduce the
members' pension benefits.</p>
<p>The second proposal, Proposition 131, isn't quite so
Draconian. It would limit statewide officials to two
four-year terms, state senators to three four-year terms, and
members of the Assembly to six two-year terms. But
officeholders wouldn't have to give it all up forever under
131; after serving their maximum time, they could sit out a
term and then run again.</p>
<p>Sen. Wilson and other leading GOP officials say they can't
support 131 because it introduces voluntary public funding
for candidates eligible to receive matching funds, and limits
spending by those who choose to accept public financing. It
also establishes a special prosecutor's office to investigate
campaign-law violations, a provision unnerving to some
politicians.</p>
<p>Proposition 131 is the brainchild of Attorney General John
Van de Kamp, who lost the Democratic gubernatorial primary to
Ms. Feinstein, and is supported by consumer advocate Ralph
Nader and Common Cause, the self-styled citizens lobby.</p>
<p>For Mr. Wilson, who has been running a tough, hard-hitting
campaign that has put his rival, Ms. Feinstein, on the
defensive, an endorsement of Proposition 140 would give his
effort a high-road, ethical tone that has been noticeably
missing so far. It would help blunt Ms. Feinstein's best
claim -- that she is the agent of change.</p>
<p>Sen. Wilson likes the idea of embarrassing Speaker Brown.
He notes, with undisguised pleasure, that the TV pictures of
Mr. Brown arriving by limousine the other night at a Beverly
Hills hotel for a $10,000-a-table fund-raiser to defeat the
term-limitation proposals weren't pretty. "It did not
represent a good night for Willie," says Mr. Wilson.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown's problem is coming up with a convincing
argument to defeat the initiatives. The polls suggest the
weakest argument is the one he's using -- that hardened
special-interest lobbyists would make mincemeat of rookie
legislators. The most compelling argument, the polls say, is
that the best way to get rid of offending politicians is to
vote them out of office. But defenders of the two initiatives
answer that by noting that incumbents won 97% of the Senate
and Assembly races they entered in 1988.</p>
<p>Sen. Wilson's people also like the fact that the two
initiatives are diverting Speaker Brown and other leading
Democrats from taking a significant role in Ms. Feinstein's
campaign. "Willie's got to beat these two initiatives," says
George Gorton, Sen. Wilson's campaign manager. "It means
Dianne Feinstein's biggest hope is busy when she needs him
most."</p>
