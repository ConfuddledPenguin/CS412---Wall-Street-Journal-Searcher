	<p class="article-leader">A scientist predicts that a major earthquake will strike
the Midwest in early December. Yesterday, the area was
rattled by its biggest quake in 14 years.
   Coincidence? Read on.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At 8:19 a.m. CDT yesterday, a moderate earthquake shook
parts of Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri and
Tennessee. The quake, which measured about 4.7 on the Richter
scale, broke windowpanes, cracked plaster, and toppled a
chimney in southern Illinois.</p>
<p>The quake was centered on the New Madrid fault, a 120-mile
jagged formation that runs from Illinois to Arkansas. In the
early 1800s, the area had some of the worst quakes ever on
this continent. Still active today, the New Madrid fault has
150 small earthquakes a year.</p>
<p>But what rattled nerves more than usual yesterday is
what's known as "The Prediction," which for several months
has been the talk of cities and towns all along the
Mississippi Valley. Iben Browning, a New Mexico scientist and
business consultant, has said strong tidal forces around Dec.
3 will produce a greater-than-normal chance that the New
Madrid area will have at least a magnitude 7.0 quake -- about
as big as the one that devastated California's Bay Area last
October.</p>
<p>Don't laugh: Mr. Browning predicted the Bay Area quake one
week before it happened, say people who heard him speak at
the time.</p>
<p>The Dec. 3 forecast, which has been dismissed as absurd by
the country's top seismic experts, has nonetheless spurred
thousands of people to cram into earthquake-survival
seminars. Some schools and businesses plan to close in early
December.</p>
<p>Was yesterday's quake a foreshock for the Big One?
"There's no way a seismologist can know," says Arch Johnston,
an earthquake expert at Memphis State University, which had
three secretaries tied up all yesterday morning answering
calls from media and concerned Memphians. Adds Gerald
Wierczorek, a spokesman for the U.S. Geological Survey, "We
don't think there is necessarily any correlation with the
prediction." Mr. Browning couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>The quake certainly didn't help already jittery nerves. In
St. Louis, a TV business reporter aired a special segment
yesterday on buying earthquake insurance. In New Madrid, Mo.,
the fault's namesake, a spokesman for the school district
says plans under consideration to close in early December are
all but locked up now.</p>
