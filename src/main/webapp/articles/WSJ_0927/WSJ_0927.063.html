	<p class="article-leader">Junk-bond funds may never be the same.
   In a move that is likely to be copied by other mutual fund
groups, Boston's Fidelity Investments is changing the
investment objective of its big, battered junk-bond fund, the
$1.1 billion Fidelity High Income Fund.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The fund's shareholders will get to vote on the change in
December. "The fund right now is oriented towards income,"
says Neal Litvack, a Fidelity vice president. "The proposal
is to change the fund's objective to both income and capital
appreciation."</p>
<p>Fidelity's proposal to change the investment objective of
its high-yield fund is the most radical attempt yet to stem
the exodus of shareholders from sagging junk funds. Under the
proposal, 65% of Fidelity High Income's assets would be
invested in junk bonds. But the other 35% would be invested
for capital appreciation, through the purchase of securities
such as bonds of bankrupt companies, zero-coupon bonds and
high-yielding stocks. The fund would be renamed Fidelity
Capital Income.</p>
<p>The move by Fidelity High Income may presage changes at
other funds, says Lori Lucas, a fund analyst with Morningstar
Inc., a Chicago mutual fund research firm. "Everybody's
trying to change a vehicle that's no longer popular with the
general public," says Ms. Lucas, who reckons some funds may
follow the Fidelity route, seeking to shore up their share
price by pursuing capital appreciation.</p>
<p>Other funds, she says, may take a different tack. "A lot
of these funds are going to become more general corporate
bond funds," she says.</p>
<p>Ever since the junk-bond market fell apart last year,
junk-bond fund managers have been scrambling to shore up
their falling fund share prices. Many junk-bond fund managers
have been raising the quality of the bonds in their
portfolios. According to Ms. Lucas, AIM High Yield, American
Capital High Yield, Bull & Bear High Yield and Phoenix High
Yield have all been upgrading the credit quality of the bonds
they hold.</p>
<p>But William Veronda, manager of Financial Bond Shares-High
Yield, reckons a lack of enough good-quality, high-yield
bonds like Duracell Holdings Corp., Kroger Co. and First
Brands Corp. will force some of the larger junk-bond funds to
either buy investment-grade corporate bonds or dabble in
distressed bond issues.</p>
<p>Even Mr. Veronda's fund, which is relatively small at $40
million in assets, has been affected. "We're padding our fund
with some high-grade bonds," says Mr. Veronda, though he
notes that the fund is still 90% invested in junk.</p>
<p>However, Paul Suckow, director of fixed income at
Oppenheimer Management Corp., reckons that right now fund
managers should be buying into the high-yield sector, not
selling out. In 1988, the $600-million Oppenheimer High Yield
Fund moved a quarter of its assets into investment-grade
bonds. "We continued to hold that position in 1989, and only
recently have we lowered that percentage as we find
opportunities in the high-yield market," says Mr. Suckow.
"The people who are {moving into better-quality bonds} now
are too late. They should have done it two years ago."</p>
<p>Fidelity's junk-bond fund, like its competitors',
continues to boast double-digit dividend yields. But over the
past year, those dividends have failed to compensate for
falling junk-bond prices. Fidelity High Income, one of the
largest junk-bond funds, is down 8.2% in the year ended Aug.
31, slightly worse than the average junk-bond fund tracked by
New York's Lipper Analytical Services.</p>
<p>Fidelity High Income's assets have shrunk to $1.1 billion
from a peak of $2 billion in 1989, the result of declining
junk-bond prices and redemptions by unhappy investors. Other
funds, too, have been affected. According to the Investment
Company Institute, junk-fund assets stood at $26 billion at
the end of July, down from almost $35 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Fidelity has "had a lot of disgruntled shareholders, just
like other fund groups," notes Eric Kobren, editor of
Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter on Fidelity based
in Wellesley, Mass. "People were yield chasers, and they paid
the price."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Fidelity closed the High Income Fund to new
investors until the December vote, though existing investors
can both add to their accounts and make redemptions.
Fidelity's Mr. Litvack says the fund was closed so that "the
people who have weathered the ups and downs of the fund over
the last few years" will be the ones to decide the fund's
fate.</p>
