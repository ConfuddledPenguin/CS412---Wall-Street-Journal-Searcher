	<p class="article-leader">For the thousands of people who suffer from the wrist
ailment known as carpal tunnel syndrome, resorting to surgery
often means more than a month off the job. But surgeons are
pioneering techniques to get patients back to work sooner.
   Carpal tunnel syndrome, a weakness and pain in the wrist
often linked to repetitive motion, has become one of the most
commonly recognized injuries of the workplace. And the
operation, a last recourse following the failure of other
therapy, has become an important part of the surgical
repertoire, though estimates of the number of operations
performed in the U.S. range widely. Some surgeons place the
annual number between 50,000 and 100,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although the new techniques, which use fiberoptics and
video cameras, still provoke skepticism within the surgical
profession, they are sure to attract keen attention from
patients and their employers.</p>
<p>At a surgeons' conference this week in Toronto, John M.
Agee presented the results of a carefully controlled study of
the new approach. Ninety-seven patients needing surgery on
one wrist were randomly assigned to surgeons using new or
traditional techniques at 10 medical centers. The result:
After the traditional surgery, the median return-to-work time
was 46.5 days; after the new way, only 25 days.</p>
<p>For the group that underwent the new surgery, gripping and
pinching strength returned sooner. And according to patients'
subjective reports, pain and tenderness due to surgery eased
faster with the new approach.</p>
<p>"The issue for society and for my patients is: When can
they go back to work and feed the family?" says Dr. Agee of
Sacramento, Calif., who has been in the forefront of testing
the high-tech methods.</p>
<p>The issue isn't always that stark, because many people are
cushioned by workman's compensation or sick-time arrangements
with their employers. But there are other concerns, too, such
as how soon people can use their hands for such simple
functions as dressing and driving.</p>
<p>Dr. Agee's report follows one earlier this year by James
C.Y. Chow, who has been developing his own new technique
using somewhat different methods. Dr. Chow, a professor at
Southern Illinois University School of Medicine in
Springfield, says that in his first 149 cases, 29% of the
patients returned to work within a week and 59% within two
weeks.</p>
<p>Already manufacturers are teaming up with the doctors.
Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. has sold about 100
equipment packages derived from the work of a California
research laboratory directed by Dr. Agee. Smith & Nephew
Dyonics Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Smith & Nephew PLC,
London, plans to market a package based on Dr. Chow's work
early next year.</p>
<p>Yet many doctors caution that questions of effectiveness,
cost and safety remain. "As to whether it's a major advance,
the jury is still out," says Ronald L. Linscheid, president
of the American Society for Surgery of the Hand.</p>
<p>Recently, carpal tunnel syndrome has received intense
scrutiny as a work-related ailment, though it can also result
from pregnancy and diseases including arthritis. It is often
associated with jobs requiring repetitive motion, whether
along an assembly line or at a computer terminal.</p>
<p>In August, the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration issued guidelines to the meat-packing
industry meant to prevent such injuries, the first step in a
program OSHA plans to extend to other industries.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics, which extrapolates the
incidence of work-related injuries from employers' reports,
recorded 115,000 repetitive motion, or "repeated trauma,"
injuries for 1988. That was 48% of all recorded injuries, a
proportion that had grown steadily through the decade from
18% in 1981.</p>
<p>The number of people who suffer from carpal tunnel
syndrome remains a mystery because the repeated trauma
category includes other injuries, such as noise-caused
deafness. But no one doubts that awareness of the syndrome,
which can lead people to seek medical treatment more quickly,
is rising.</p>
<p>"It's just exploding," says Roger Stephens, an OSHA
specialist in ergonomics, or the science of adapting the
workplace to the worker.</p>
<p>The carpal tunnel is a tiny channel within the wrist
through which tendons and a nerve, called the median nerve,
pass into the hand. If membranes around the tendons thicken,
pressure can build on the nerve and its blood supply, causing
pain and numbness and loss of strength in the hand. These
symptoms can often be allayed by stopping the activity that
aggravates them, by splinting the wrist or by taking
anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
<p>Still, a lot of people turn to surgery. The framework of
the carpal tunnel, though mostly bone, includes a section of
ligament. Severing it relieves the pressure.</p>
<p>Traditionally, surgeons have made an incision across the
wrist and up the hand, one inch to three inches in length.
That exposes the ligament to plain view. By contrast, Drs.
Agee and Chow first insert into the wrist a tube known as an
endoscope, fitted with a lens and fiberoptic apparatus, and
then their cutting instruments. They find the ligament and
watch the movement of the instruments on a TV monitor. Dr.
Agee uses one small incision; Dr. Chow, two. In both
approaches the goal is to minimize damage to other tissues.</p>
<p>Still, surgeons may hesitate to switch from the
traditional technique. Some want more evidence that the rate
of recurring symptoms isn't unusually high. Another issue is
cost, though surgeons and hospitals shouldn't have to raise
their bills sharply just to cover equipment purchases. 3M is
selling its package for $6,000, and only the blade, a $160
item, is disposable.</p>
<p>The most sensitive issue may be the risk of using an
endoscope. Dr. Agee himself emphasizes the need for training
to prevent nicking of nerves and arteries, though he notes
that even the traditional technique hasn't been free of
accidents. A spokeswoman says 3M won't sell its equipment to
doctors unless they take a half-day course, including work on
cadavers.</p>
<p>A. Lee Osterman, a hand surgeon at the University of
Pennsylvania, has tried both the Agee and Chow techiques. For
now, he is withholding judgment. But he says of the new way,
"I think patients are going to push us to use it, as long as
it isn't unacceptably dangerous."</p>
