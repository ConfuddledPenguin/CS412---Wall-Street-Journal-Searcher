	<p class="article-leader">INTERMARK Inc. said it won't pay its quarterly dividend
due in October on its common or its preferred shares. The La
Jolla, Calif., holding company was scheduled to pay a three
cent-a-share dividend on its common and a 2.75 cent a share
dividend on its preferred. Intermark said it took the action
because it hasn't yet been able to "fully evaluate" its
dividend policy in light of its merger with Triton Group Ltd.
on Aug. 30. The company said it also needs to evaluate its
debt and the expected restructuring of its balance sheet.</p>
