	<p class="article-leader">USAir Group Inc. suspended its quarterly dividend and
deferred delivery of 16 new Boeing Co. jets for several years
in an effort to get its balance sheet and growth plans in
order.
   The Arlington, Va., airline holding company said its board
decided yesterday to suspend its quarterly three cents a
share dividend for "an indefinite period."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Industry analysts have expressed concern about USAir for
some weeks as its already-huge operating costs have swollen
in the wake of skyrocketing jet fuel costs, its
second-largest expense after labor.</p>
<p>The company is considered more vulnerable to an economic
downturn because of existing operational and customer service
problems. Those largely resulted from difficulties merging
with Piedmont Aviation Inc. last year.</p>
<p>In a statement, USAir Chairman Edwin I. Colodny said the
board decided to suspend the dividend "in light of the
company's recent financial performance and the poor outlook
for the nation's economy and its effect on air travel."</p>
<p>Mr. Colodny said the company would be "conserving funds to
meet the company's ongoing capital needs."</p>
<p>USAir yesterday also released details of how it plans to
cut its capital plans. USAir said it is delaying delivery of
14 Boeing 737s and two 767s that it was supposed to start
getting next year. The 737 is a narrow-body, mid-range plane.
The 767 is a wide-body, long-range plane.</p>
<p>Of the 16 planes that it's deferring, USAir said it will
postpone delivery of one 767 to 1994 from 1992. The other 767
is being delayed to 1993 from 1992.</p>
<p>Delivery of the 737s is also being delayed to 1993 and
1994 from 1991 and 1992.</p>
<p>USAir executives foreshadowed the delivery delays several
weeks ago when they moved to cut the airline's capacity
growth to a maximum of 2% from 6%, as compared to this year,
and lay off 3,600 employees, or 7% of its work force of
54,000. Many employees say morale at the company has slumped
in recent days as a result of the moves.</p>
<p>As a precursor to the capacity reduction, USAir in June
laid plans to postpone delivery of another dozen Boeing 737s
to 1995 from 1991 and 1992.</p>
<p>The company yesterday indicated it is willing to commit to
more planes some years down the road. It said agreed with
Boeing to convert 10 existing options for 737s into firm
orders that would be delivered in 1994.</p>
<p>Before the suspension of its dividend, USAir's payout was
already low relative to its rivals. UAL Corp., parent firm of
United Airlines has a quarterly dividend of 25 cents a share.
Even cash-strapped Pan Am Corp., which owns Pan American
World Airways, had a larger quarterly payment of 10 cents a
share.</p>
<p>In his statement, Mr. Colodny acknowledged that the
company's dividend was "comparatively modest."</p>
<p>Because its dividend is only three cents a share, it
doesn't appear as if the suspension will save the company a
lot of money. USAir had 44.5 million shares outstanding as of
June 30.</p>
<p>USAir announced its actions after the close of trading
yesterday.In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, USAir shares closed at $16, down 50 cents.</p>
<p>The company said it's also putting up for sale 28 old
Boeing 727-200 planes and 21 Boeing 737-200s between now and
1992. Those aircraft are considered fuel-guzzlers that would
cost USAir a lot of money to operate if fuel costs continue
to rise.</p>
<p>In the weeks since Iraq invaded Kuwait, industry observers
have said that they expect carriers such as USAir to shelve
their less-fuel efficient planes in an attempt to combat
rising fuel costs.</p>
<p>A suspension of dividends wasn't one of the strategies,
however, that Wall Street analysts expected airlines to use
to combat their cost squeeze. Pan Am, for example, has
already taken the anticipated course of reducing capacity and
laying off employees.</p>
