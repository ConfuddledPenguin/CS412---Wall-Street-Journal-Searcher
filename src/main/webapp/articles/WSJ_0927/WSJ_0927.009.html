	<p class="article-leader">NCNB Corp., struggling with weaker commercial real estate
markets in the Southeast, said it will increase its allowance
for loan losses and report sharply lower third-quarter
earnings.
   The Charlotte, N.C., bank holding company said it expects
to boost its allowance for loan losses by $65 million, to
about $590 million. With net loan charge-offs of about $75
million to $85 million, the provision for loan losses in the
third quarter should be about $145 million. That compares
with an $84 million provision in the second quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Including the weightier provision, third-quarter earnings
will plummet to $55 million to $65 million, or 50 cents to 60
cents a share, from the year-earlier $143.6 million, or $1.45
a share.</p>
<p>Analysts were surprised by the size of the provision.
"People have been expecting some kind of softness, but the
magnitude has thrown them," said Henry Coffey, a bank analyst
at J.C. Bradford. Although NCNB will report earnings at about
half of what he projected, Mr. Coffey said that, amid a
difficult real estate environment, the company is "still
profitable, the dividend is safe, and the capital structure
is in good shape."</p>
<p>The third-quarter earnings would be even worse, conceded
an NCNB spokesman, if not for the strong health of the
company's Texas operations.</p>
<p>NCNB disclosed the news after the market closed. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday,
NCNB closed at $23.25, down $2.125.</p>
<p>Several southeastern banks will be reporting lower
earnings in the third quarter, said Richard Stillinger, an
analyst at Keefe Bruyette. "The Southeast, by virtue of
having one of the stronger growth rates, is more vulnerable
to a pullback than, say, the Midwest."</p>
<p>Hugh McColl, NCNB chairman, said the increased loan-loss
provision "reflects our awareness of weakening economic
conditions that have affected not only the real estate
markets, but lending activities in general."</p>
<p>NCNB said its allowance for loan losses at Sept. 30 will
total $585 million to $600 million, or 1.6% to 1.65% of total
loans. That compares with an allowance of $525 million, or
1.46% of loans, at the end of the second quarter.</p>
