	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The movie industry's ratings system, buckling
under an onslaught of internal criticism and charges that its
dreaded X rating smacks of censorship, will make major
changes in how it classifies films for their sexual and
violent content.
   The biggest change revealed yesterday by Jack Valenti,
president of the Motion Picture Association of America, is
the elimination of the X rating. It will be renamed NC-17,
meaning no children under age 17 will be admitted. In so
doing, Mr. Valenti seeks to do away with America's most
notorious scarlet letter, a seamy label that has come to be
associated with pornography.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The revised ratings system also will begin augmenting the
R rating, which requires children to be accompanied by a
parent or guardian, with brief descriptions specifying that a
film contains particularly graphic violence or explicit
sexuality. That change aims at parents who say the R category
has allowed a disturbing amount of violence to seep in and be
seen by kids in recent years.</p>
<p>Mr. Valenti, who created the "voluntary" ratings system 22
years ago to enable the film industry to police itself and
avoid the creation of local censorship boards, had
steadfastly refused to overhaul it. But the system came under
heavy fire this year as 11 new films drew the X rating,
despite critical praise for their artistic content. Of 2,353
films rated in the previous five years, only seven ended up
with an X.</p>
<p>Since the controversy erupted, a federal judge has
excoriated the system as "censorship from within," and said
it was "indefensible" to allow film makers to reap "huge
profits {by} pandering to the appetite for . . . hard
violence." Some 31 directors, including some of the most
famous names in Hollywood, have placed a full-page ad in
Variety saying "the taint of an X rating clearly results in
massive and arbitrary corporate censorship." Distributors
have even taken to criticizing the ratings process in their
ads on newspaper movie pages.</p>
<p>When the system was first imposed, the X was seen merely
as an adult rating and it applied to such highly praised
works as "Clockwork Orange," "Last Tango in Paris" and the
Oscar-winning "Midnight Cowboy." But makers of blue movies,
who have never submitted their films to the ratings board,
quickly embraced the X. That is the fault of the Motion
Picture Association: the group trademarked the G, PG, PG-13,
and R ratings, but not the X.</p>
<p>So the X came to mean unbridled, hardcore porn. Theaters
refused to show X fare. Newspapers and radio and television
stations barred ads for X films. The big studios avoided
releasing them.</p>
<p>"The X became soiled by a lot of pictures that, to many
people, went beyond the pale," says Mr. Valenti. "Yes, I knew
it five years ago, but I didn't do anything about it."</p>
<p>But it is far from clear whether Mr. Valenti's new system
will be successful. For one thing, it may open a new round of
fighting over whether tough films should get an R rating or
the new NC-17, now that the latter rating won't carry the
stigma of pornography. Studios may have a difficult time
persuading directors to edit their films to land an R rating
-- which would enable them to be shown to a broader audience
including teen-agers -- now that the shadow of the X will be
gone.</p>
<p>Moreover, it's unclear how theaters, newspapers, radio and
television will react to the NC-17 rating once it takes hold.
Some might ban even that classification, since it is the
successor of X. "The real question is how will the exhibition
community react? If they start the same bans, it could be a
problem," says Thomas Rothman, senior vice president of
Samuel Goldwyn Co.</p>
<p>But Mr. Valenti and his trade group had to do something.
The heat was turned up this year when Miramax Films Corp.
sued the Motion Picture Association over the X rating that
its review board had pasted on "Tie Me Up] Tie Me Down]" The
Spanish film by director Pedro Almodovar is the story of a
mental patient who abducts his favorite film star and ties
her up until she falls in love with him. The violence was far
more graphic in the R-rated "Total Recall," and the sex was
quite a bit steamier in the R-rated "Wild at Heart."</p>
<p>Miramax lost its court bid, but not without a blistering
opinion on the ratings system from U.S. District Court Judge
Charles E. Ramos. Then the board issued an X for "Life Is
Cheap . . . but Toilet Paper is Expensive," a film directed
by Wayne Wang and distributed by a small company known as
Silverlight Entertainment. Silverlight's president, Mark
Lipsky, orchestrated the directors' full-page ad aimed at Mr.
Valenti and the association.</p>
<p>The final straw occurred this month when, for the first
time this year, the ratings board issued an X to a major film
release from one of the Motion Picture Association's eight
members. "Henry and June," to be distributed by MCA Inc.'s
Universal studio, is the story of writer Henry Miller, his
wife and their common lover, a woman. Its infractions:
several scenes of lesbian love and one shot of a drawing of a
woman having an unnaturally affectionate relationship with an
octopus.</p>
<p>Now, "Henry and June," instead of going through with an
appeal of the rating in the hopes of landing an R, will hit
theaters Oct. 5 as the first movie to carry the NC-17 rating.
The newly named category "is the right thing to do," says
Thomas Pollock, chairman of MCA's motion picture group. "I
had no choice before, because I was faced with an X, a
dishonorable rating."</p>
<p>"My interest is in this film being able to be shown in
America uncut," rather than deleting scenes to get an R
rating, adds Philip Kaufman, the film's director. "It was a
good move on the part of Jack Valenti and the MPAA to make a
change. A little late? I suppose, but at least they did it."</p>
<p>Russell Schwartz, executive vice president of Miramax,
said he is "very, very happy" with the renamed X. "I'm going
to send Jack Valenti some flowers, for a start." His
company's "Tie Me Up] Tie Me Down" and "The Cook, the Thief,
His Wife & Her Lover" may end up getting the new rating. But
two other Miramax films -- last year's "Scandal" and the new
"Hardware," about a 21st Century robot that takes a severe
disliking to humans, already have been edited to get an R, in
essence falling to censorship, he concedes.</p>
<p>The ratings changes, however, fall short of the solution
first demanded by Miramax and other critics, who had argued
that an entirely new category was needed. They called for an
A rating, for "adults only," that should fall between R and
the scandal-tinged X.</p>
<p>Mr. Valenti refused to make that change. He is the single
most important force in the ratings tiff. He appoints the
ratings board's chairman and has a hand in approving its 10
members, who are parents who aren't employed in the movie
business. He also chairs the appeals board, consisting of a
dozen industry insiders, that sometimes overturns the ratings
board's decisions. And he is chairman of the policy review
committee that sets the rules that govern how the ratings
board functions. "I don't bow to pressure. The more pressure
I get, the less likely I am to respond," he says sternly.</p>
<p>Lawyers had warned the Motion Picture Association that
setting up an A rating would force the ratings board to
decide the difference between artistic adults-only fare and
raunchy, pornographic releases. That would have left the
ratings system open to new legal challenges.</p>
<p>The resulting NC-17 compromise has the support of the two
major entities that oversee the ratings, the eight-member
Motion Picture Association and the National Association of
Theater Owners. But Silverlight's Mr. Lipsky criticized the
plan, saying the NC-17 rating would allow a pornpeddler to
submit his film and get that classification rather than going
with an X.</p>
<p>"It's a definite improvement," Mr. Lipsky says, "but it's
still a rating that opens its arms to `Debbie Does Dallas' at
the same time it helps `Life is Cheap' and `Tie Me Up]'"</p>
<p>But Mr. Valenti dismisses such criticism. He says a
skin-flick distributor needs the X to represent "steamy,
erotic, the hottest thing since Adam and Eve." For that, he
adds, a rating of NC-17 just won't do.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>           A Rash of Controversial Ratings</p>
<p>From 1985 to 1989 the ratings board viewed more than 2,300
films and issued only 15 X ratings. But so far this year, 11
films have received an X, which usually hasn't been
overturned on appeal. Now the films may be given the new
rating of NC-17. Among them:</p>
