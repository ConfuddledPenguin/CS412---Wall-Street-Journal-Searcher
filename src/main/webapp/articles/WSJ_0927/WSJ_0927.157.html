	<p class="article-leader">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- The Semiconductor Industry Association
said that it expects world semiconductor sales to grow 1.5%
to $49.5 billion by the end of 1990. The trade group also
projected that sales will jump by 12.5% in 1991 and 19.5 % in
1992. But some analysts found these predictions excessively
upbeat, in light of falling chip prices.
   Erik Jansen, semiconductor analyst for Robertson Stephens
& Co., said a 1.5% sales growth for 1990 was "on the high
end," and he characterized the 12.5% forecast for 1991 as
"optimistic and not believable at this point. . . . It just
sounds too good."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Jansen pointed out that for the industry to rack up
12.5% growth, memory prices would have to stay the same when,
in fact, they've been falling. For example, one megabit
dynamic random access memories, among the most broadly sold
chips, has dropped in price by half since March 1990. In
addition, Mr. Jansen said, personal-computer sales growth
would have to be at least 10% in 1991, but most PC analysts
are predicting single-digit growth for next year.</p>
<p>The trade group predicted sales growth in the U.S. and
Japanese markets for 1991 of, respectively, 9.3% and 13.6%.
For 1990, however, the SIA projected a 2.3% decrease in U.S.
sales to $14.5 billion, compared with $14.8 billion in 1989.
Chip sales to Japan should drop 2.8% in 1990, the trade group
said, to $18.6 billion, compared with $19.1 billion in 1989.</p>
