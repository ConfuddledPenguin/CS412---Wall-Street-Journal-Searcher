	<p class="article-leader">Franchising will keep booming, even though franchising
failures are more common than most people think. If a
recession develops, it will only increase the rush into
franchising.
   That is the forecast of Patrick J. Boroian, president of
Francorp Inc., a franchise development and consulting firm
based in Olympia Fields, Ill. An M.B.A. graduate of DePaul
University, Mr. Boroian became a management consultant and
specialist in franchising.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Typically, franchisers license their names and know-how to
investors, called franchisees, in exchange for initial fees,
ongoing royalties and, often, contracts to supply products
and services. Francorp's clients mostly are prospective
franchisers, whom the consulting concern helps to create and
market franchise programs.</p>
<p>In a recent interview, Mr. Boroian talked mostly about
prospects for potential franchisees and franchisers.</p>
<p>Q. If there is a recession, how will it affect
franchising?</p>
<p>A. To the extent that it hurts retail sales, it obviously
will be negative. But paradoxically, it may have some
positive effects too. More companies won't have the capital
to expand with company-owned units, and that will make more
franchises available. And, of course, middle-management
personnel of more companies will be let go, and the sheer
number of prospects to buy franchises will rise.</p>
<p>Q. Which sectors of franchising are especially attractive,
or unattractive, to investors right now?</p>
<p>A. Some of the old-line industries that have franchised --
hotels, fast-food restaurants, car-rental agencies -- are
reaching near-saturation levels, and it's tough for
franchisees to make a good living. Investors don't perceive
those saturated industries as businesses of the future.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of the "information age"
franchises, business services and professional services are
doing well. We're also seeing aspects of distribution --
sales forces, delivery routes -- being franchised and doing
very well. Advantage Refreshments System in Los Angeles is a
distributor of vending machines that fired its entire sales
force and sold franchised sales territories. The result has
been higher sales and reduced overhead costs.</p>
<p>Q. There's still a flood of offerings?</p>
<p>A. Yes. That's largely because it is far less expensive to
franchise a business successfully today than it was, say, 10
years ago. Prior to 1975, there were 15 states that had
franchise registration requirements, and they were all
different. Franchising was generally a very expensive
proposition just from a legal point of view. Now uniform
disclosure documents are accepted in all the states. That
opened the floodgates for new franchises. The total cost for
becoming a franchiser can run as high as $200,000 or more,
but more often it can be done for $100,000 to $200,000.</p>
<p>Q. Who are the new entrants?</p>
<p>A. What we typically see is a small company that has built
up one or several outlets. They may or may not be performing
well financially.</p>
<p>Q. Don't investors tend to shun unprofitable franchisers?</p>
<p>A. Generally, yes. But 85% of the franchisers out there do
not provide an earnings claim. So the first few people who
buy into such a franchise are buying on faith. It's like
buying a stock that's relatively unknown: If you buy the
right one, it can go to the moon. But there's also a higher
chance of failure.</p>
<p>Q. In general, how risky is it to become a franchisee?</p>
<p>A. The Department of Commerce has said about 5% of
franchisees go out of business in any given year. What that
statistic doesn't reveal is the number of franchisees who
have failed, but who have been bought out, either by another
franchisee or by the franchiser. The real number of failures
every year is probably 10%.</p>
<p>Q. How do you know if you are paying too much in
royalties?</p>
<p>A. You're overpaying a royalty if it doesn't leave you a
competitive rate of return after all your expenses. But you
can't just look at the price. You can't just say 8% is too
high and 3% is too low. It depends what you're getting back
in support -- in advertising, new products, consulting
advice. In the temporary-help business, the franchiser takes
50% of gross profit. On the surface that sounds exorbitantly
high. But those franchisers finance the payrolls of the
franchisees.</p>
<p>Q. How can investors tell if a franchise offering is
sizzle or steak?</p>
<p>A. If an opportunity sounds good, you owe it to yourself
to visit the franchiser's headquarters and meet the
management. Also, by law you receive an offering circular,
containing a lot of detail about the franchise. That document
should be reviewed by a CPA and by a lawyer who looks at
fairness and enforceability. Most important, you should do
some due diligence and talk to some existing franchisees to
find out how they're doing.</p>
<p>Q. How much capital is needed to become a franchisee?</p>
<p>A. The cheapest franchises, which may be home-based, can
be as low as $10,000 -- total investment. You can go up as
high as $7 million or $10 million. Most franchises are in the
$50,000 to $250,000 range; the average is about $140,000.
Generally, up until the recent credit crunch, you could get
into a franchise with about 20% or 25% of that in cash.
Today, however, franchisees are needing to come up with about
40% in cash. The rest can be financed by a bank, providing
you're willing to give personal guarantees and pledge
personal assets as collateral.</p>
<p>Q. Besides money, what does it take to be a successful
franchisee?</p>
<p>A. Most franchisers require the full time and attention of
the franchisee. Obviously, that is not always practical;
someone who might buy five (hamburger) franchises for $1.5
million apiece isn't very likely to stand behind the counter
and flip burgers. In those cases, there are financial
partners and operating partners. But the operating partners
must make at least 10% of the investment with their own
money; that's what creates the motivation. If you look at
franchisee failures, many times they're due to an absentee
investor, someone who has the money but is not in the
trenches. You build a successful business a brick at a time,
a hamburger at a time.</p>
