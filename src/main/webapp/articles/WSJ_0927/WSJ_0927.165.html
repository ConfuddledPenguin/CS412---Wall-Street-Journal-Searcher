	<p class="article-leader">PORTLAND, Ore. -- Nerco Inc. said its oil and gas unit
successfully completed a new development well at its Eugene
Island Block 108 field, 25 miles offshore St. Mary Parish,
La.
   The well is expected to be put into production by early
November. Nerco, a natural resources company, acquired a 61%
operating interest in the field during 1988 and 1989. The
field has eight producing wells, each of which averages about
6.6 million cubic feet of natural gas and 85 barrels of
condensate a day.</p>
