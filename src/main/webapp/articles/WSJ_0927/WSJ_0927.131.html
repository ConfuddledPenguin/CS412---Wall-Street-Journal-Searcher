	<p class="article-leader">Booz-Allen wanted a more sophisticated image for its
computer-systems design group. But the consulting firm had
trouble explaining, much less marketing, its new service,
known less-than-snappily as "Strategy Driven Systems."
   The solution: An artist designed six hanging sculptures
representing key aspects of the system. Little curved
enameled pipes, for example, depict its flexibility. A
brochure featuring these mobiles will go to new clients.
Cooking up a flashy brochure took some doing, says Raymond
Lane, a senior vice president at Booz-Allen, Hamilton Inc.
"It has to say something to senior management."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mobiles aren't exactly Madison Avenue. But Booz-Allen's
artistic efforts illustrate the struggles that face
management consulting companies as they try to beef up their
images.</p>
<p>The most competitive consulting market in years -- some
say ever -- is pushing once-reticent consulting firms into
unfamiliar marketing territory.</p>
<p>Companies that once ducked the limelight now hire
publicists, solicit testimonials from clients, sponsor
conferences and cozy up to journalists. Some bury academic
journals under a blizzard of papers. At least one firm has
even turned to television advertising.</p>
<p>But rocks dot the road to fame. Some companies find it
hard to explain what they do. (Typically, management
consultants for a fee help companies handle business problems
like plotting strategy, solving personnel problems or
redesigning manufacturing or marketing systems.) Several
claim the strongest resistance to their own marketing comes
from within their own firm. Others say old-time methods still
suit them just fine.</p>
<p>"We don't make cold calls. We don't send fliers. We don't
send letters," asserts Frederick Gluck, managing director of
consultants McKinsey & Co. He adds,"We don't need to do it.
We have all the work we can handle."</p>
<p>Still, many firms think change is inevitable. "Management
consulting is becoming more a business and less a
profession," says Marvin Schiller, managing director, North
America, at A.T. Kearney Inc.</p>
<p>One reason: the deteriorating economy, which is trimming
the consulting industry's double-digit growth rate of the
past five years. While many consulting firms still say
they're growing faster than ever, a number acknowledge their
growth rates have slowed substantially.</p>
<p>Of 17 firms recently surveyed by Consultants News, a trade
publication, four reported decreases in first-half revenues
of between 10% and 25%; four had increases of less than 10%;
two showed unspecified growth; two wouldn't say; and only
five showed increases of more than 10%. "That's a big change
from what we have been used to hearing," says Managing Editor
David Lord.</p>
<p>Also, some tough players are intensifying their battle for
a slice of today's market. The genteel Ivy League world of
strategy consulting increasingly is being attacked by
technological whizzes like Andersen Consulting, an offshoot
of accountants Arthur Andersen & Co. Because of their roots
in the competitive accounting profession, companies like
Andersen have lots of experience in shootouts with rivals.</p>
<p>"In the old days it was white-gloves competition," says
Carl Sloane, chairman of consultants Temple, Barker &
Sloane/Strategic Planning Associates Inc. "You wouldn't even
hire someone from another firm without asking permission."</p>
<p>Like doctors and lawyers, consultants have until very
recently viewed publicity as unseemly. While 60% of firms
sampled for a report released earlier this year by Britain's
Alpha Publications Ltd. depended on old-boy networks, only 3%
used advertising and 3% public relations consultants to
promote themselves. Consultants protected their clients'
confidences the way a psychiatrist might. "For the first 60
or 65 years {at Booz-Allen} you didn't talk to anyone," says
Mr. Lane. "You were the CEO's consultant, and the CEO didn't
want anyone to know he had a consultant."</p>
<p>Today, buyers of consulting services are shopping around.
What's more, says Thomas Doorley III, managing partner of
Braxton Associates, "We may be consulting with a client who
is using a competitor. Ten years ago, that never happened."</p>
<p>So testimonials from satisfied clients become more
important. In the past, Bain & Co.'s policy was not to even
suggest a client's identity in public. Nowadays, it sometimes
seeks a client's approval to do so. Last year for the first
time, a brochure for Booz-Allen's information systems group
included names of clients.</p>
<p>Here's how four well-known consulting companies are
adapting to the leaner, meaner years:</p>
<p>-- In common with many other firms, Boston Consulting
Group Inc. must draw 20% of its work each year from new
business, and it's being "very aggressive," says John
Clarkeson, president and chief executive officer. Noting that
rivals are being unusually flexible in the terms they're
offering clients -- for example taking on smaller projects
than in the past -- Mr. Clarkeson suggests that his
associates "really {make} sure clients check our references"
and consider bringing in Boston Consulting's senior officials
and knowledgable executives based at faraway branches to help
clinch the deal.</p>
<p>-- Bain: Companies that once sold their services on
reputation alone now find themselves struggling to define
specific products or areas of expertise. Bain has reorganized
into "practice areas" where it can offer expertise, such as
health care, services and information technology, banking,
marketing and manufacturing. Peter Dawkins, managing director
of North American operations, says Bain had been losing
"competitive bake-offs" because rivals marketed their
expertise in specific industries, while Bain didn't.</p>
<p>-- At Braxton Associates these days, individual
consultants spend close to half of the time that they aren't
actually consulting on product-development work, compared
with about 25% two or three years ago. "New competitors pop
up all the time," says managing partner Thomas Doorley III.
"It forces us to be on our toes."</p>
<p>-- A.T. Kearney, a firm that has traditionally focused on
logistics consulting, is now forming groups to develop
products in different specialties like information technology
and marketing. One new product is called "Stages of
Development." Says Mr. Schiller: It's a visual presentation
"of where a company stands in its business capability and
where it should be. In the past, it would be more a matter of
starting from a zero base and providing a tailored program to
the client."</p>
<p>Developing products doesn't work, of course, if nobody
knows you have them. Firms that once dodged publicity now
court it. Earlier this year, Bain hired its first full-time
public-relations official, and Andersen Consulting last year
named its first time national public relations director.
Today, that official supervises a dozen people and two
outside public-relations firms. "Frenzy isn't too strong a
word" to describe the quest for advice, says a public
relations aide for one consulting firm.</p>
<p>Noting their growing numbers, a group of New York-based
and Boston-based P.R. types working for consulting companies
last year formed a group they call the Breakfast Club.
Members meet every two months and talk about seminars, book
publishing, ads.</p>
<p>One strategy sparks lots of debate among consultants:
using television ads. Andersen Consulting, which specializes
in information technology and consulting in computer systems,
uses TV as part of an "image campaign" that began last year.
This year, the firm is budgeting $10 million for ads.</p>
<p>Andersen's ads -- including shots of a computer mouse
being manipulated by a real one -- hit an industry
unaccustomed to such directness like a bomb. Booz-Allen's
position probably represents that of most competitors: "We
are thinking about it, but we aren't doing it," says Mr. Lane
at Booz-Allen. Why not? "We're snobs," he says. "We like to
stay above the fray."</p>
<p>Even at Andersen, says A. George Battle, the company's
managing partner in charge of market devlopment, "It's an
interesting cultural shift to work in an area many people
think of as slightly sleazy." In the first year, 60 people
had to approve the ads. "It felt like the gestation of an
elephant."</p>
<p>Many expect, however, that if the economy tightens
further, competition will only intensify. "When I got into
the business, all you needed to consult was a blue serge
suit, an air-travel card and a Harvard MBA," mourns Mr.
Sloane at Temple, Barker & Sloane.</p>
