	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The badly battered corporate junk bond market
took another pounding yesterday.
   Falling stock prices and further signs of economic
weakness unnerved investors, helping to drive down junk-bond
prices for the fifth consecutive day. Prices of many junk
issues, those high-risk, high-yielding bonds with low credit
ratings or no ratings at all, fell by more than 3/4 of a
point, or over $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount, in moderate
trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Junk bonds of some casino companies were hit even harder.
Junk-bond prices now have dropped in 11 of the past 12
trading days, said Gregory Curran, research analyst at
Salomon Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>Fears about the financial system's health once again
depressed prices of several large banks' stocks and bonds
yesterday. Prices of bonds issued by Chase Manhattan Corp.,
Citicorp and several other large banks have fallen sharply
recently in the aftermath of Chase's decision to cut its
dividend and reduce its employees by 5,000.</p>
<p>Worried investors increasingly are turning for safety to
short-term issues, especially Treasury bills, driving up
prices and pushing rates down. For example, the
bond-equivalent yield on three-month Treasury bills fell
yesterday to 7.53% from 7.59% Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Earlier this week, the main theme was fear about higher
oil prices, but today the main theme was fear of financial
fragility," said James Capra, executive vice president at
Lehman Government Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Many investors yesterday also bought new four-year
Treasury notes, auctioned at an average annual yield of
8.53%. "There was significant demand" from investors for the
new notes, said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president at S.G.
Warburg & Co. "For the small investor, a yield above 8 1/2%
for four years on a Treasury note is probably a fairly decent
investment. That's a fairly attractive return on a riskless
asset."</p>
<p>Long-term Treasury bonds held steady, finishing at about
the same levels as late Tuesday. For example, the Treasury's
latest 30-year bonds were quoted late in the day at a yield
of about 9 1/8%, unchanged from Tuesday. Traders said fears
about higher oil prices were offset partly by speculation
that U.S. government officials may be close to a budget
deficit reduction agreement.</p>
<p>A budget accord probably would allow the Federal Reserve
to cut short-term interest rates, many traders and investment
advisers agree. "I would be very surprised if the Fed doesn't
lower interest rates within the next few weeks," said
Geoffrey Bell, president of Geoffrey Bell & Co., a financial
consulting firm here.</p>
<p>Mr. Bell also expects further interestrate cuts later this
year. He predicted yesterday the rate on federal funds, or
overnight loans between banks, will fall to 7% by year end
from its recent level of 8%.</p>
<p>But even if the Fed does cut short-term rates, don't
expect long-term bond yields to follow suit, Mr. Bell says.
"The long bond will dance to a different tune" than
short-term rates, he said. By year end, he said, long-term
Treasury bonds will yield between about 9% and 9 1/4%.</p>
<p>In the municipal bond market, prices ended mixed. Today,
traders expect preliminary details to be announced on a huge
new $1.3 billion bond issue by the state of Massachusetts.
Some traders yesterday predicted the issue will include bonds
due in about seven years and yielding around 8%. Merrill
Lynch Capital Markets heads the group of underwriters.</p>
<p>Corporate & Junk Bonds</p>
<p>Corporate & Junk Bonds Junk bond prices slumped again
yesterday.</p>
<p>"I think dealers are scared," said David Briggs, senior
trader at Federated Investors Corp. "They are not committing
any capital to the market at this point.</p>
<p>Many junk bonds finished with declines of between 3/4
point and one point. Junk bonds from casino companies were
especially hard hit on fears that those companies' revenues
would be hurt by a recession.</p>
<p>Trump Taj Mahal Funding Corp.'s 14% first mortgage bonds,
due in 1998, fell two points to 35, while Caesars World
Inc.'s 13.50% subordinated notes, due in 1997, dropped one
point to 94.</p>
<p>Also hard hit were junk bonds of some companies -- such as
retailers -- thought to be especially vulnerable to a
recession.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade corporate bond market, issues of
several large banks were hit hard again yesterday. For
example, Citicorp's 9.75% subordinated capital notes,
maturing in 1999, tumbled 5 1/2 points to a price of 83 5/8,
bid, to yield 12.90%.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan's 10% subordinated notes, due in 1999,
fell two points to a bid price of 76 1/8. Manufacturers
Hanover Corp.'s 8.50% subordinated notes, maturing in 1999,
dropped 3 1/2 points to a bid price of 75.</p>
<p>The bank sector "was like a pinball machine," said Joseph
Foley, a corporate bond trader at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc. "Nobody knew what was going to happen next."</p>
<p>Among the other banking sector issues that sustained
sizable losses were Bankers Trust New York Corp. and Security
Pacific Corp. bonds. Bankers Trust's 9.50% subordinated
notes, maturing in 2000, finished down 1 1/8 points at 92
1/4, while Security Pacific's 9.75% subordinated notes,
maturing in 1999, fell 1 1/4 points to 94.</p>
<p>Thomas Quigley, a corporate bond trader at Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., said a lack of liquidity
in the bank sector accelerated the declines in some bonds.
"The day was characterized by growing fears about bank bonds,
and the lower levels got, the more sellers came in as fear
dominated," he said.</p>
<p>Standard & Poor's Corp., the large credit-rating agency,
said yesterday it has reduced its ratings on about $5.2
billion of Chase debt and preferred stock. Among its
downgrades, S&P reduced its senior debt ratings on Chase
Manhattan Corp. to triple-B-plus from single-A-minus. It also
reduced its subordinated debt ratings on Chase Manhattan
Corp. to triple-B from triple-B-plus. But it left unchanged
its commercial paper rating at single A-2.</p>
<p>Chase issued a statement yesterday saying "we disagree"
with the S&P downgrades, "particularly in light of S&P's own
comments citing Chase's strong base of retail banking
profits, the enhanced profits expected from our aggressive
restructuring efforts, as well as our liquidity and financial
flexibility."</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Chase statement said, "Chase will have
$11 billion in total capital at Sept. 30 and capital ratios
in excess of the 1992 regulatory guidelines."</p>
<p>Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered its ratings Tuesday
on Chase's long-term debt and commercial paper.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury note and bond prices ended little changed.</p>
<p>The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was quoted late
yesterday at 96 5/32, up very slightly from 96 3/32 late
Tuesday. The latest 10-year notes were quoted at 98 1/2, to
yield 8.98%. Late Tuesday, they were quoted at 98 11/32, to
yield 9%.</p>
<p>The new two-year notes, sold Tuesday at an average annual
yield of 8.18%, were quoted late yesterday at about 8.15%.</p>
<p>Rates fell on short-term bills. The discount rate on
three-month bills fell to 7.29% from 7.36% late Tuesday.</p>
<p>Here are details of the Treasury's sale of four-year notes
yesterday:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.

<p>The notes are dated Oct. 1, 1990 and mature Sept. 30,
1994.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Municipal bonds ended narrowly mixed as the rising price
of oil again took its toll.</p>
<p>Earlier in trading, tax-exempt securities had reached
session highs, gaining as much as 1/4 point, as traders cited
a decline in oil prices as one impetus.But as oil reversed
its losses, prices began slipping.</p>
<p>In new issue activity, a Chase Securities Inc. group
reported an unsold balance of just over $20 million on an
issue of $95 million Maryland general obligation bonds. The
issue yields from 6.10% in 1993 to 7.15% in 2005.</p>
<p>Ahead on the calendar, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
group is expected to set the preliminary pricing for $1.3
billion Massachusetts dedicated income tax bonds today.</p>
<p>Traders put yields at the long end of the issue at 8% for
bonds maturing in 1997.</p>
<p>In secondary trading, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issue due 2018 was unchanged at 95 3/4 to yield 7.55%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>British government bond prices fell sharply.</p>
<p>Traders cited remarks by U.K.'s Chancellor of the
Exchequer, John Major. Speaking in Washington, Mr. Major said
Britain won't join the European exchange rate mechanism until
inflation is falling, and that inflation isn't likely to fall
until next year.</p>
<p>Britain's 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 dropped 22/32 point
to 99 2/32, to yield 11.87%. The 12% bonds due 1995 fell
14/32 to 99 10/32 to yield 12.17%.</p>
<p>In other major markets, Japanese bond prices also fell,
and bond futures prices ended at their lowest levels since
they were instituted five years ago.</p>
<p>Japan's benchmark government bonds, the No. 119, 4.8%
issue due in 1999, fell 0.14 to 80.63, on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange. The yield rose 8.71% from 8.675%.</p>
<p>Mortgage & Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities rose as much as 6/32.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% issue
for October delivery rose 1/8 point to 97 25/32, Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2% issue rose 3/ 32 to 98 9/32, and
Federal National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% securities
rose 3/ 32 to 98 3/32.</p>
<p>In the asset-backed market, Salomon Brothers Inc. priced
an $800 million Household Credit Card Trust 1990-1 offering.
The issue is backed by Visa and MasterCard receivables from
Household Finance Corp.</p>
