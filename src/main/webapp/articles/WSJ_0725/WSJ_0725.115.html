	<p class="article-leader">Nynex Corp. released a study it contends shows no
correlation between its purchases and attendance by certain
suppliers at annual "perverts conventions" organized by a
Nynex purchasing executive.
   The study showed that from 1985 to 1988, companies
represented at the weeklong Florida gatherings experienced a
compounded annual growth rate in sales to Nynex of 11.3%,
compared with 9.9% for other Nynex suppliers, excluding
American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nynex's New York Telephone unit commissioned the study as
part of its $1.4 billion rate-increase request in New York
state. The company submitted the study to state regulators
yesterday. It hired Miles O. Bidwell of National Economic
Research Associates in White Plains, N.Y., to critique
evidence presented by Scott Rafferty, a former executive at a
small Nynex software unit. Mr. Rafferty, who has intervened
in the rate case, found a 67% compounded annual growth rate
in sales to Nynex for convention attendees compared with
about 3.5% for Nynex suppliers overall.</p>
<p>Mr. Bidwell faulted Mr. Rafferty's analysis for "improper
calculation and improper data selection." He criticized Mr.
Rafferty's exclusion of companies that did no business with
Nynex's purchasing arm, Materiel Enterprises Co., and Mr.
Rafferty's decision to start tracking a supplier's sales
growth to Nynex beginning with the year the supplier began
attending the Florida gatherings. In calculating the growth
rate for companies that weren't represented at the
conventions, Mr. Bidwell excluded AT&T, a leading supplier
whose sales to all of the Bell companies was declining
following the 1984 breakup of the Bell system.</p>
<p>Nynex has refused to release any of the underlying
statistics or names of companies whose employees attended the
conventions. The company has claimed that much of the
testimony in the rate case is a trade secret, citing the need
for confidentiality in its business deals and relationships.</p>
<p>Mr. Rafferty said Mr. Bidwell "complicates a simple issue
and doesn't show his work." By including companies that did
no business with Nynex but whose owners or employees were
personal friends of convention organizers, Mr. Bidwell
"dilutes the statistics," Mr. Rafferty said. The New York
Attorney General's office supported Mr. Rafferty's
conclusions. "I haven't seen anything so far that makes me
change my mind as to the Rafferty analysis," said Charlie
Donaldson, a lawyer in the attorney general's office.</p>
<p>The parties, nicknamed the "perverts conventions," were
organized by a vice president of the regional phone company's
purchasing unit who was fired in 1988. One other Materiel
Enterprises employee was fired and seven others were
disciplined because of their participation.</p>
