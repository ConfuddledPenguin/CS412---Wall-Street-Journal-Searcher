	<p class="article-leader">Heritage Entertainment Inc. said it expects to post
"significant losses" for the fiscal year ended March 31,
although it didn't quantify them.
   Heritage also said it has received a proposal from an
entity it didn't identify to provide "substantial equity
capital" primarily to expand Heritage's theater chain.
Heritage didn't disclose the size of the potential
investment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it is also talking with several other
parties regarding possible debt or equity financing, "and is
exploring other alternatives" through an independent
committee of its board.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles movie and television production company
said its losses relate primarily to the re-evaluation of
certain unamortized film costs and an increase in its expense
to cover bad debt.</p>
<p>In fiscal 1989, Heritage had a net loss of $5.3 million,
or 99 cents a share, on revenue of $6 million. The company
said results for fiscal 1990 won't be completely comparable
because it didn't acquire the Landmark and Seven Gables
theater chains until last June. For the first nine months of
fiscal 1990, the company had a net loss of $1.2 million, or
17 cents a share, on revenue of $18.2 million.</p>
