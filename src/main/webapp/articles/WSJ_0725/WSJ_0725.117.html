	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The head of the Senate Securities
subcommittee said he hopes a compromise can be reached on a
Bush administration-backed plan to shift some power from
commodity regulators to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) said that if discussions
on a compromise collapse, the legislation will become "a jump
ball on the {Senate} floor." The focus of the bill would move
regulation of stock-index futures from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission to the SEC.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite support from the securities industry, the proposal
appears to be headed for defeat. Backers of the bill are
looking to other areas to find a compromise. The primary
target, Sen. Dodd confirmed, is oversight of futures margins,
which currently are set by the commodities exchanges and
can't be overruled by a regulator except in emergencies.
Senate aides said any compromise would create a provision for
federal oversight of margins, or good-faith money that must
be put up in order to trade.</p>
<p>At a Senate Banking Committee hearing, the heads of the
futures exchanges urged Congress to keep marginsetting
authority at the exchanges.</p>
