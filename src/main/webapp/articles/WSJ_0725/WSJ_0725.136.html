	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, a unit of Deutsche
Bank AG of West Germany, plans to buy an equity stake in the
mergers advisory boutique of Eric Gleacher, former head of
mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley & Co.
   The new firm will be called Gleacher Morgan Grenfell Inc.,
and both Mr. Gleacher and the Deutsche Bank unit will share
expenses evenly, according to people familiar with the
transaction. Mr. Gleacher last night confirmed the equity
stake, but wouldn't give financial or other details.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With the investment, C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.,
the U.S. investment banking arm of London-based Morgan
Grenfell, will close its corporate finance and merger
departments here. Late yesterday, 36 people in those
departments were told they would be out of jobs in two weeks.</p>
<p>People familiar with the transaction said that the
investment in Gleacher & Co. was negotiated by Morgan
Grenfell's chief executive officer, Michael Dobson, and
chairman, John Craven, without the advance knowledge of top
executives at C.J. Lawrence here.</p>
<p>The investment in Mr. Gleacher's firm is the latest in a
series of alliances between overseas securities firms and
U.S. merger advisory boutiques in the past few years.</p>
<p>Nomura Securities Co. of Japan has purchased a 20% stake
in Wasserstein Perella & Co. for $100 million, Nikko
Securities Co. of Japan paid the same amount for a 20%
interest in Blackstone Group, and Yamaichi Securities Co. of
Japan paid $101 million for a minority stake in Lodestar
Partners.</p>
<p>A veteran of Lehman Brothers, Mr. Gleacher was head of
mergers and acquisitions throughout the late 1980s at Morgan
Stanley & Co. He led the firm to a bonanza in high-profile
takeover advisory business during the heyday of corporate
raiders' hostile bids for blue-chip U.S. firms. But he left
the firm early this year to form the small boutique.</p>
<p>Mr. Gleacher has since disavowed any interest in expanding
to a size that would rival the Wasserstein or Blackstone
firms. So far this year, his only major deal as an
independent has been to advise ConAgra Inc. on the $1.3
billion acquisition of Beatrice Co.</p>
