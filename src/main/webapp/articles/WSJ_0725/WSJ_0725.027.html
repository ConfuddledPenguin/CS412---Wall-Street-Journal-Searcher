	<p class="article-leader">ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- UNC Inc. said it sold two
environmental-service units to Chem-Nuclear Environmental
Services Inc. based in Oakbrook, Ill., for $24 million.
   The units, UNC Geotech and UNC Remediation, both based in
Grand Junction, Colo., provide environmental restoration and
waste-management services to the federal government.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>UNC said the gain from the sale will be offset by an
expected second-quarter write-down of its investment in its
third environmental services unit UNC Reclamation, which the
company is closing. The aviation products and services
company said it does not expect to record a loss in the
second quarter.</p>
