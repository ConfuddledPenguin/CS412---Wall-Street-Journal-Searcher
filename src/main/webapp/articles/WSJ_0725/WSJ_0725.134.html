	<p class="article-leader">CARPINTERIA, Calif. -- Digital Sound Corp. said a
shareholder filed a lawsuit in federal court in Los Angeles
against the company, which designs, makes and sells products
for voice messaging, interactive voice reponse and other
applications.
   Digital Sound said the complaint, which seeks class-action
status, alleges omissions and misstatements in connection
with the company's initial public offering Feb. 27, and
subsequent public statements. The suit doesn't specify any
amount of damages sought, the company said. The plaintiff
wasn't identified.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said that it believes the lawsuit is without
merit, and that it intends to contest the action vigorously.</p>
<p>Digital Sound went public at $8.50 a share. The stock
plunged $4.25 on July 2, after the company said it expected
to report a loss for the second quarter, citing a
slower-than-anticipated order rate from certain major
customers. Digital Sound shares closed at $4, down 50 cents,
in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.</p>
