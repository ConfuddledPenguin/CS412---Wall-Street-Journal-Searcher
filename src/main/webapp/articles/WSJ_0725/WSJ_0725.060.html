	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Weary travelers may need coffee, an aspirin or
just some quiet time to themselves when they board an
airplane. But do they really want a bank economist's lecture
or a stand-up comic's routine?
   Like it or not, this live entertainment is just what
they'll get on Continental Express flights between Detroit
and Cleveland for one week beginning Aug. 6. During the
"Express Yourself" program, business writers and economists
will lecture in the morning, while comedians will perform on
the afternoon flights.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both will have to be brief: The flying time between
Detroit City Airport and Cleveland Hopkins Airport is 17
minutes on the 30-passenger commuter planes.</p>
<p>One featured speaker will be David L. Littmann, senior
economist and a first vice president of Manufacturers
National Bank of Detroit, a unit of Manufacturers National
Corp. "Economic Revelation While at Peak Elevation," is the
title of his 10-minute talk. It "will be a tale of two
cities, if you will," says Mr. Littmann, a discussion of the
local economies of Cleveland and Detroit. Mr. Littmann says
he has made many presentations before, but never while
airborne. Deadpan, he says: "My career must be taking off."</p>
<p>The business experts won't be paid for their services,
says Continental Express, but the comedians will receive a
yet-to-be-determined fee. Comedy auditions will be held in
Detroit on Monday and in Cleveland on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Business-travel experts aren't sure just what to make of
all this. "I've heard of news on a screen," says Linda
Marion, travel manager at GAF Corp. "But live entertainment
on the plane? I've never heard of that before."</p>
<p>The Detroit-Cleveland flights cost $220 round-trip, while
restricted-fare tickets can be purchased for as low as $124.
Why not simply cut the price instead of resorting to
gimmickry? Continental Express, the commuter unit of
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., says it wants to "build
awareness" of its service. If the idea catches on, a
spokeswoman says, it might be tried on the carrier's other
routes.</p>
<p>Refunds won't be given if the lecture is boring or the
comedian is a dud. Mr. Littmann, however, says he plans to
offer a sort of flight insurance to passengers on his trip.
"I will provide cotton wads," he says, for passengers to use
as earplugs should they so choose.</p>
