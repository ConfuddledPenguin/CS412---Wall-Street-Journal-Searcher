	<p class="article-leader">Sapporo Breweries Ltd., Japan's second-largest beer
brewer, reported that its unconsolidated pretax earnings for
the first half rose 2.3% to 5.69 billion yen ($38.4 million)
from 5.56 billion yen a year earlier.
   Net income climbed 18% to 2.83 billion yen, or 8.48 yen a
share, from 2.41 billion yen, or 7.21 yen a share, as
Sapporo's extraordinary losses tumbled 31% to 640 million yen
and extraordinary gains totaled 31 million yen from sales of
securities. In the year-earlier period, there were no such
gains; extraordinary losses stemmed from disposal of some
fixed assets and the dismantling of a unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>First-half sales rose 2.5% to 220.29 billion yen from
214.99 billion yen.</p>
<p>Sapporo officials said demand for beer in the domestic
market expanded about 8% from a year earlier, as a result of
new products. Beer sales, by far Sapporo's largest line of
business, rose 4% to 202.19 billion yen. Sales of soft drinks
slipped 5% to 9.71 billion yen, partly because of slumping
demand for carbonated soft drinks.</p>
