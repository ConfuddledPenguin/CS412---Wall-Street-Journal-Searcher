	<p class="article-leader">Ryder System Inc. posted nearly flat earnings for its
second quarter, breaking a yearlong string of steep declines
in profit and signaling that the company might be poised for
a turnaround.
   Ryder reported second-quarter net income of $32.1 million,
or 39 cents a share, compared with $32.4 million, or 40 cents
a share, a year earlier. Revenue inched up to $1.31 billion
from $1.29 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>M. Anthony Burns, chief executive officer of the
Miami-based transportation-services concern, said Ryder
expects to show a solid profit in the third quarter, compared
with a net loss of $27.6 million, or 38 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period, including a $57 million after-tax
charge.</p>
<p>The second-quarter results, analysts said, offered
evidence that a seven-point "profit improvement plan"
initiated by the company last year is starting to pay off.</p>
<p>In line with its plan to slash costs, Ryder has sold eight
businesses in the past year and a half, Mr. Burns said.
Further divestitures are possible.</p>
