	<p class="article-leader">With mystery nominee David Souter, conservatives get a
high-stakes test of the judicial philosophy that what counts
is not who wins and who loses in cases but how the judges
play the game. His empty file on the hot-button legal issues
should make no difference to anyone so long as he passes the
litmus test of reasoning by law and not by politics.
   A review of Judge Souter's New Hampshire court opinions
suggests he is a practitioner of classic judicial restraint.
He does not legislate from the bench or make up new parts of
the Constitution. Indeed, several of his cases feature what
might be called a Thrifty Yankee view of the Constitution:
Use it sparingly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Judge Souter's supporters cite one case in particular to
show the importance of how a judge reaches his decision. New
Hampshire v. Valenzuela (1987) was a run-of-the-mill appeal
by drug dealers caught with 65 pounds of cocaine, almost a
ton of marijuana and weapons. The defendants tried to invoke
the exclusionary rule to suppress the evidence.</p>
<p>The police had used what's called a pen register to record
the telephone numbers dialed by one of the drug dealers. To
the defendants' argument that this was an unreasonable
search, Judge Souter did not wade in to make new
search-and-seizure law. Instead, he ruled that unlike a
wiretap attaching this device to a subscriber's telephone
line was not a search at all.</p>
<p>He dismissed the view that "any effort to gather evidence
should be treated as a search." Otherwise, he reasoned, the
police would also have to get a warrant before they could use
information given to an agent or informer. Judge Souter thus
gave the Constitution the frugal reading it often deserves
but rarely gets from judges more eager to add their
footprints to the head of a jurisprudential pin.</p>
<p>Civil libertarians and separation-of-powers cognoscenti
will also be cheered by this opinion. Judge Souter chastised
a magistrate in the case who had advised the police that
evidence would be suppressed if they denied one of the
arrested defendants his request to make a phone call. Judge
Souter wrote that "legal advice to police officers ought to
come from city or county attorneys or from the attorney
general's office, not from judges." Giving advice "places
neutrality at risk, with potentially appalling consequences."
He warned that "all of us in the judiciary should take care
to avoid occasions for any more litigation about judicial
detachment."</p>
<p>Judge Souter also criticized judges for adopting
multipronged balancing tests as a hidden way of creating new
legal rules. The straightforward question in City of Dover v.
Imperial Casualty & Indemnity (1990) was whether the city was
immune from liability when a woman slipped on a public
sidewalk. Somehow this tort case led to a majority opinion on
the wrinkles of the Constitution's equal protection clause.
In his dissent, Judge Souter warned that the court's
"middle-tier equal protection scrutiny . . . and accompanying
questions as yet unanswered will provide fodder for a good
many opinions."</p>
<p>Judge Souter's dissent in New Hampshire v. Ballou (1984)
is strict constructionism at work. The state extended the
period of new committals to mental hospitals for criminal
defendants who plead guilty by reason of insanity.
Recommittals would last five years instead of two years. The
defendant claimed this violated the prohibition against ex
post facto laws for the punishment of criminal offenses.</p>
<p>But Judge Souter noted that the insanity plea is not an
admission of a crime. Instead, the purpose of the plea is to
avoid criminal liability. "A statute regulating commitments
of dangerous defendants following findings of insanity does
not deal with criminal offenses and, by definition, could not
do so," he wrote. Therefore, the ex post facto clause does
not apply.</p>
<p>These cases help explain why -- proprieties aside -- the
Bush administration does not need to ask potential nominees
their views on substantive issues. Put it this way: If you
have to ask a nominee his views after analyzing his opinions,
you probably shouldn't nominate him. It is highly unlikely
that a judge who will parse the ex post facto prohibition to
distinguish between criminal defendants and the criminally
insane would then fail to take seriously other statutes or
the Constitution.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that litmus-test questions on
substantive issues were put to judicial candidates during the
Carter administration. This makes sense. It is obviously
important to know the policy views of an activist judge whose
legal methodology could well be determined by the result to
be reached.</p>
<p>President Bush may well have found an unBorkable nominee.
Judge Souter has apparently never written a law-review
article or given a memorable speech. The liberal lobbyists
will have a hard time making much of his opinions likeliest
to attract their attention. He has written on abortion, but
in a medical malpractice case and only to say that doctors
don't have to perform abortions themselves when they advise
patients that there may be a birth defect. In another case,
he was part of a court that ruled New Hampshire could
prohibit homosexuals from adopting children, but also said
the state could not exclude them from working in day-care
centers.</p>
<p>So if a fight develops against Judge Souter, it probably
won't be the smear and misrepresentation campaign that worked
so well against Robert Bork. The lobbyists instead might have
to debate the role of judges. We already hear liberal voices
testing the waters by dismissing the distinction between
judges interpreting the law and legislating from the bench as
nothing but a "cliche."</p>
<p>Anyone tempted to push this notion might think twice. For
one thing, it is a problem for liberals to dismiss the
existence of judicial activism even as they erect monuments
to its champion, William Brennan. Justice Brennan had to
ignore whole tracts of the Constitution to find a prohibition
on the death penalty.</p>
<p>If liberal Senators defeat a judicial nominee because he
believes too strongly in judicial restraint, they legitimize
activist judging at their peril. After all, most federal
judges were appointed by President Reagan or Bush. No one has
seen a right-wing activist judge in many decades, but a new
breed is possible to imagine. Such a judge might ignore the
16th Amendment in order to invalidate income taxes or dismiss
the Clean Air Act as patently irrational and refuse to hold
defendants liable.</p>
<p>More likely, Judge Souter will become Justice Souter in
time for the next term of the Supreme Court. His close
analysis of statutes and the Constitution will put him in the
conservative camp of justices. His willingness to ask whether
all issues are necessarily legal issues could help nudge the
court back to its more modest practice of avoiding
essentially political cases. It is a tribute to the influence
of Justice Brennan that even his replacement by David Souter
would mean only that the new conservative intellectual
jurisprudence will be off to a healthy infancy.</p>
