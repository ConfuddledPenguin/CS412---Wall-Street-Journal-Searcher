	<p class="article-leader">National service is about to get its foot in the door, and
while it's only a toehold, it has profound implications --
especially for our children.
   The notion of national or community service is a very good
one. But the potential problems and pitfalls are real; it's
better to proceed cautiously, and that's what Congress and
the Bush administration are doing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Senate a few months ago cleared legislation that would
provide incentives, principally for young people, to
participate in various community services. The odds are that
a compromise version with the House will be sent to the
president before the 101st Congress adjourns this fall.</p>
<p>The legislation grew out of two quite different
initiatives. One was President Bush's "thousand points of
light" plan to encourage part-time volunteers from more
affluent areas to help less fortunate citizens. The other was
a measure sponsored by Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), with Sen.
Charles Robb (D., Va.) and Rep. David McCurdy (D., Okla.), to
establish a broad-based national-service system providing
modest stipends and subsequent benefits to people who perform
public-service tasks for a year or two.</p>
<p>The Senate-passed bill gives George Bush his points of
light initiative, authorizing $25 million over two years to
establish programs using volunteers. It also expands a youth
service corps for youngsters between 16 and 25, working in
teams in human service or conservation employment, and it
sets up a program to encourage elementary and high school
kids to undertake volunteer efforts.</p>
<p>But the most important component is the bill's version of
the Nunn idea. This authorizes $35 million over two years for
a demonstration program in a few states in which young people
17 and older and senior citizens would provide such services
as helping nursing homes, tutoring disadvantaged kids and
aiding the homeless. These volunteers could make up to $6,000
a year and get $5,000 in annual post-service vouchers to be
used for educational expenses, as a down payment on a first
home or to start a small business. (The Senate scrapped an
even bolder Nunn proposal, making all federal aid for college
students contingent upon performing some community service.)</p>
<p>National service programs, especially broad-based ones,
have plenty of opposition. Some liberals fear it is a sop to
avoid substantive social programs. Some unions worry that
low-paying jobs could displace higher-paid workers. Many
college presidents object, ostensibly on equity grounds;
administrators of most existing local service efforts say
they've been unsuccessful in getting middle- or upper-class
kids involved. Libertarians detest any effort by the
government to mandate service.</p>
<p>To Sen. Robert Kerrey (D., Neb.), a winner of the
Congressional Medal of Honor, those pushing national service
are adults who say "we don't care enough about our country,
and our solution is instead of requiring adults to serve
more, we're going to require our kids to serve more." Any
parallel to the GI bill is inappropriate, he says, because
that was after the fact: "We didn't set it up and say, gee,
we've got these Nazis over there in Europe, and they're
really bad, and will you go put your life on the line for us
and then get these benefits."</p>
<p>Many conservatives also criticize national service plans.
Some object to the cost; others such as Bruce Chapman,
director of the Census Bureau under Ronald Reagan and a
scholar at the Hudson Institute, object on broader grounds. A
national service program, he says, "stigmatizes the honest
labor of the poor {and} denigrates the genuine altruism of
the millions of Americans who donate their time to worthy
causes without expectation of material reward." He likens it
to a massive public-works boondoggle like the CETA
(Comprehensive Education and Training Act) program of
yesteryear.</p>
<p>Yet most of these criticisms and complaints are
exaggerated. The bureaucracy would be limited. National
service would cost money, but it also would produce some
savings in areas such as defaults on federal aid to
education. President Bush's thousand points of light
volunteerism concept is a nice notion but it's different from
service. "We are asking," Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell says, for "a consistent, dependable rigorous
commitment over a sustained period of time."</p>
<p>Complaints that young people shouldn't be compensated for
providing "volunteer" services are ludicrous. Otherwise, as
Sen. Nunn says, community service would be limited to those
who have the "luxury" to serve -- namely only the affluent.
On the other side, the idea of making educational aid an
earned right rather than an entitlement would be healthy for
most kids and institutions.</p>
<p>There are two overriding arguments for national service.
One is the plain national need for more help in caring for
the elderly, the homeless and the disabled and in
conservation projects. The other is the desirability of
instilling, particularly in young people, a sense of national
or civic pride.</p>
<p>There's an easy rejoinder for those cynics who doubt that
pride is waiting to be tapped. Try to recall a memorable
phrase from any president, even Ronald Reagan, in recent
history. (Richard Nixon's "I am not a crook" doesn't count.)
For any of us in our middle years, one comes instantly to
mind. It is John F. Kennedy's call: "Ask not what your
country can do for you; ask what you can do for your
country."</p>
