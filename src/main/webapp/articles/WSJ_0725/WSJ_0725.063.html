	<p class="article-leader">The Kennedy-Hawkins Civil Rights bill creates a
contingency-fee bonanza by expanding damage awards, a third
or half of which in the course of events go to legal fees, in
job-discrimination cases. The career prospects of lawyers in
the civil-rights lobby may be dimmed by more conservative
courts, but the bill promises to keep them in business. All
they need to do is flood the system with job-discrimination
suits, hoping to bring in a big catch now and then.
   Under the bill's provisions, though, one 38,000-employee
business gets to pick its own judge and jury. If an employee
of the U.S. Congress thinks she has been subject to sexual
discrimination, she could take her complaint to the Senate or
House Ethics Committee. Under the same law but any other
employer, she could go to court, and if she proved
intentional discrimination, she and her lawyer could split
punitive damages. These same rules can't apply to Congress,
New Hampshire Senator Warren Rudman told the World's Greatest
Deliberative Body, because they might encourage "frivolous
lawsuits."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This bill has of course been subject to intensive
negotiation between Congress and the White House. President
Bush doesn't want to veto anything calling itself a
civil-rights bill, but opposes language that, without quite
admitting it, mandates racial quotas. But the Democrats
apparently are playing for a veto instead of a bill. The
Senate passed provisions the White House thought it had
negotiated out, and House leaders say they don't even want to
talk. The President is on record as threatening a veto of the
present version; if he needs any last-minute encouragement,
he should read the Senate debate on whether the law would
apply to Congress.</p>
<p>There is one Senator, Iowa's Chuck Grassley, who believes
Senators should live by the same laws they apply to everyone
else. Last September, he managed to shame his colleagues into
applying the Americans With Disabilities Act to the Senate,
giving disabled employees the right to sue Senators. This
month, the conference committee report on the ADA bill came
before the Senate for final passage, just as the new
civil-rights act was coming up for debate.</p>
<p>The House had never followed the Senate in extending
disabilities act protection to its employees, referring
complaints instead to its own in-house committee. In a highly
unusual move, the Senate overruled the conference report, and
gave jurisdiction instead to its ethics committee. The
provision applied as well to the Civil Rights Act, but
Senator Grassley persisted with an amendment that would have
applied its provisions to the Senate. His amendment lost
63-26, but the debate was enlightening.</p>
<p>Senator Wendell Ford sponsored the provision for Ethics
Committee jurisdiction, but Senator Grassley argued that it
was sweetheart justice to allow this committee to serve as
judge, jury and prosecutor. He asked, "Wouldn't it be nice if
every citizen had the same right? Does General Motors or any
other business on Main Street have the right to be the jury
on whether they have discriminated?"</p>
<p>"It is absolutely essential that, as to our legislative
employees, we have an absolute right without outside review
by anyone of what we do," replied Senator Rudman. To allow
Senate employees to seek redress in the courts would subject
the Senate "to the whims of a U.S. district-court judge who
under this amendment would have the power to overrule the
considered judgment of 100 Members of this body."</p>
<p>Senator Rudman then candidly asserted the Senate is above
the law. "This is the Senate, it is not subject to the same
rules and laws of a manufacturing plant in New Hampshire or a
farm in Iowa." He added, "I am not embarrassed to stand here
tonight and say we are not exactly like everybody else. That
is not what Madison aspired to. That is not what Jefferson
aspired to."</p>
<p>In the Federalist Papers, as it happens, James Madison
wrote that having the law apply to both those who govern and
those who are governed "has always been deemed one of the
strongest bonds by which human policy can connect the rulers
and the people together . . . without which every government
degenerates into tyranny." Madison went on to say, "If this
spirit shall ever be so far debased as to tolerate a law not
obligatory on the legislature as well as the people, the
people will be prepared to tolerate anything but liberty."</p>
<p>We are now seeing exactly what Madison predicted. An
Imperial Congress, accountable to no one but itself, exempts
itself from the laws it applies to others precisely because
those laws are burdensome and "frivolous." Whatever
Kennedy-Hawkins says about quotas, President Bush ought to
veto it until Congress agrees to live by the laws it
legislates for others.</p>
