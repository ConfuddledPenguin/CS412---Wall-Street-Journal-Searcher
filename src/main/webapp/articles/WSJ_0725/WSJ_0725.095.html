	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Three insiders at Medco Research Inc. sold
$1.8 million of its stock last month, filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission show.
   The largest sale was by Dr. Rudolph Nisi, chairman of the
Los Angeles-based pharmaceutical research firm. He sold
75,000 shares June 27 and 29 for a total $928,750, or $12.38
a share. The shares represented 34% of his stake in the
company, according to SEC filings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, Medco's president, Manfred Mosk, has filed with
the SEC his intention to sell 40,000 shares, or 12% of his
holdings in the company, valued at $560,000.</p>
<p>The sales come at a time when Medco Research stock has
been buoyed by hopes for Federal Drug Administration approval
of the company's Adenoscan heart drug, takeover rumors and a
positive article in Business Week magazine. Medco's shares
closed yesterday at $14.125 bid in over-the-counter trading,
at the higher end of its 52-week trading range of $6.88 to
$20.25.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Mosk nor Mr. Nisi could be reached for
comment, but Sanford Hillsberg, a director and one of Medco's
two vice presidents, said, "I don't view this as a bailout,
but orderly liquidation."</p>
<p>Mr. Hillsberg, one of the three insider-sellers, sold
45,000 shares in several sales in June, shares representing
19% of his holdings, SEC filings show. "I've never been more
bullish on the company, but, on the other hand, if you have
all your eggs in one basket, it may be prudent to diversify,"
he said. He added that he chose last month to sell the shares
because he plans to exercise options to buy more Medco stock
in December. Under SEC rules, he wouldn't be able to sell
shares six months before and after an options exercise.</p>
<p>Hemant K. Shaw, analyst with HKS & Co., Warren, N.J., said
the company has generally been popular with the medical
community because of the prospects for its cardiac drug. But
Medco hasn't been as popular with investors, he said, chiefly
because the company has never been in the black. Mr. Shaw,
who said he once worked as a consultant to Medco, recommends
the stock because of the likely success of Adenoscan.</p>
<p>The third insider-seller, Medco's former head of research,
William C. Govier, sold 15,000 shares between June 4 and 8 at
an average price of $14.22 each, or a total of $213,300. He
retains 88,628 shares, SEC filings show. The company
dismissed Mr. Govier in May, but he is considered an insider
by the SEC for filing purposes because of his large stake in
the firm. Mr. Govier couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>LOWER EXPECTATIONS: Eight insiders at Lowe's Cos. sold
$1.5 million of stock in May and June, SEC filings show. The
insiders trimmed their holdings in the North Wilkesboro,
N.C., building-materials company by a total of 32,293 shares,
according to SEC filings. For four insiders, who each sold
less than 1,000 shares, the sales liquidated their entire
holdings in the company.</p>
<p>The sales took place from May 18 through June 13 at an
average price of $45.11. Lowe's share price has since fallen
sharply. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, the
stock closed yesterday at $34.875, down 25 cents.</p>
<p>According to W. Cliff Oxford, spokesman for the company,
an exceptionally strong 20% sales gain in the first quarter,
which ended in April, led to unreal expectations by both
analysts and stockholders. While sales in the current quarter
are running 11% ahead the year-earlier period, he said, that
won't be enough to meet analysts' earnings expectations, and
a "nervous" market has penalized the company. He added that
the insider selling was part of the "normal course of
business."</p>
<p>The largest sale was by Pietro Kulnych, a director. SEC
filings show he sold 12,000 shares in May, 3% of his
holdings. (Mr. Kulnych has since sold another 3,000 shares,
the company said, that aren't yet reflected in the SEC
files.) Mr. Kulnych couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Company president Leonard B. Herring sold 10,000 shares at
$48.25 a share on June 1, SEC filings show. The sale
represented 2% of his holdings. Mr. Herring declined to
comment.</p>
<p>CASHING OUT: In one of the larger insider sales of stock
reported to the SEC last week, Jack R. Daugherty, chairman of
Cash America Investments Inc., a Fort Worth, Texas, owner and
operator of pawnshops, sold 20% of his stake. He received
$1.1 million for the 65,000 shares, which were sold in
several sales in June, the filings show.</p>
<p>Mr. Daugherty declined to comment, but a spokeswoman said
he sold "for personal reasons." Mr. Daugherty's shares
fetched an average price of $17.65. On the American Stock
Exchange yesterday, Cash America shares closed at $17.25,
unchanged.</p>
