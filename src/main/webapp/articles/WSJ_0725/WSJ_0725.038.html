	<p class="article-leader">From an article by P.J. O'Rourke in the July 12-16 Rolling
Stone:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I've been writing about the American-political process for
some two years now. All that time I've been looking for a
straightforward issue. But everything I've investigated --
election campaigns, drug abuse, savings and loan regulation,
social security, housing, foreign policy, the environment --
has turned out to be a lot more complicated than I expected.
There were always angles I hadn't considered, aspects I
hadn't weighed, complexities I'd never dreamed of. Until now.
Until I got to the 1990 Farm Bill. Here at last is a simple
problem with a simple solution. Drag the thing behind the
barn and kill it with an ax.</p>
