	<p class="article-leader">LIVINGSTON, N.J. -- Howard Savings Bank named William P.
Tuggle III chairman and chief executive officer, succeeding
Donald F. McCormick, who resigned in January after the bank
posted a wider-than-expected fourth-period loss of $85.3
million, or $5.94 a share.
   The 57-year-old Mr. Tuggle currently is president and
chief executive officer of First Fidelity Bank of New Jersey
and senior executive vice president and a director of its
parent, First Fidelity Bancorp., Lawrenceville, N.J.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Leo J. Rogers Jr., 54, who continues as Howard's
president, had acted as chief executive while the bank sought
a new top officer.</p>
<p>Anthony Terracciano, 51-year-old chairman and chief
executive at First Fidelity Bancorp., will assume Mr.
Tuggle's responsibilities on an interim basis. "Bill will be
missed at First Fidelity, but we wish him all good fortune
with the challenge that lies before him," Mr. Terracciano
said.</p>
<p>Howard had $4.9 billion in assets at June 30. Like many
banks and thrifts, the bank's non-performing loans -- those
not paying interest for 90 days -- have grown as real-estate
markets have softened in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Monday, Howard reported a second-quarter net loss of $15.7
million, or $1.09 a share, after adding $25 million to its
loan-loss reserves. Non-performing loans climbed 25% from
March 31 to $503 million at June 30.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Howard
shares fell 25 cents to $3.875.</p>
