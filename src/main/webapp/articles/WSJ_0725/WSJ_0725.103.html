	<p class="article-leader">Eighteen months ago, High Hopes Investment Club of
Fremont, Calif., bought PepsiCo Inc. shares. Now, with a 110%
paper profit, club members are trying to decide whether to
sell.
   "You don't want to bail out when it's still going up, but
you don't want to lose your profits if the market plunges
like it did in 1987," says club member Mary Lyn Pelican, a
sixth-grade teacher. "Selling is the trickiest part of all."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lots of investors are facing the same dilemma these days.
As the stock market moved higher and higher in recent weeks,
their anxiety about a sudden downturn grew stronger. And
Monday's plunge, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank
more than 100 points in the first hour of trading, proved
that their fears weren't just an idle concern.</p>
<p>"We're in the late cycle of a narrow market, so people
should be vigilant on combing through their portfolios
regularly" to consider selling certain stocks, says Robert
Farrell, chief technical analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many investors find that it's a lot harder
to sell a stock than it is to buy one. "Most people have no
idea when they should sell," says Phillip J. Roth, chief
technical analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "It's the
biggest mistake that investors make."</p>
<p>Brokerage houses give investors far more advice on when to
buy a stock than when to sell it. "Brokerage firms have a
built-in conflict," says Eugene Lerner, a finance professor
at Northwestern University. "They want to do underwritings
for companies, and it's hard to build good will if their
analyst is telling investors to dump the company's stock."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, investment professionals have come up with
some tips on when to sell. They caution, however, that
investors have to apply any guidelines judiciously.
Otherwise, they risk selling too often and paying too much in
brokerage commissions and taxes. Any decision to sell also
depends on an investor's time horizon and goals.</p>
<p>One big problem is that most investors don't have a
specific price objective, says Mr. Roth. "When you buy a
stock, you should decide at what price you will sell it," he
says. "If the stock hits that price, sell it unless you can
legitimately come up with a higher price target" for the same
risk.</p>
<p>Brad Perry, chairman of David L. Babson & Co., a
Cambridge, Mass., investment firm, says it's time to sell
when a stock appears substantially overvalued by fundamental
historical measures. For example, assume that a stock's
price/earnings ratio (share price divided by per-share
profit) has usually been 20% above the price/earnings ratio
of the Standard & Poor's 500 stocks. If it's now 40% above,
"you have to conclude that it's overpriced," says Mr. Perry.
Unless the company's business prospects or its industry's
outlook have vastly improved -- which is rarely the case --
it may be time to sell, he says.</p>
<p>By Mr. Perry's standards, PepsiCo is a candidate for
selling. During the past 10 years, the stock has traded at an
average 10% premium to the price/earnings ratio of the S&P
500, he says, while today it trades at a 33% premium.</p>
<p>But a long-term investor might reach a different
conclusion. "PepsiCo is a reliable, stable growth stock that
is overbought on an immediate-term basis, but there is no
reason to disturb an investment position," says Dean Witter's
Mr. Roth. "This is the kind of stock investment clubs should
hold for the long term."</p>
<p>Just yesterday, PepsiCo reported second-quarter earnings
that showed a 10% gain from the year earlier.</p>
<p>Academic research by Northwestern's Prof. Lerner published
in 1987 concluded that investors could boost their long-term
stock performance by selling a stock when the company's
earnings for any 12-month period declined from the previous
12 months. His computer simulation focused on certain stocks
in the S&P 500 from 1973 to 1985 and included the effect of
commissions.</p>
<p>Prof. Lerner says, however, that his three-year-old rule
may not work as well in the current market. There is so much
emphasis and publicity on "negative" earnings surprises for a
quarter, that waiting for a 12-month actual earnings downturn
may be too late, he says. "Many stocks react so violently
these days."</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch's Mr. Farrell says his rule of thumb is to
sell when there are two disappointing earnings surprises in a
row. "You sell when the stock no longer responds to good
news. You watch a stock over a three to four-month period and
then make your decision."</p>
<p>Some say to move even faster. Claudia Mott, quantitative
analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., uses the first
quarterly "earnings disappointment" as the trigger to sell
the over-the-counter growth stocks she follows. This doesn't
mean a declining earnings report -- only a quarter that
doesn't live up to analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>But others use a more cautious approach. Many investment
pros disagree with the quarterly earnings surprise strategy.
"The greatest source of poor moves has been selling stocks
after a disappointing earnings performance and later seeing
the companies get back on track, causing a large rebound in
stock prices," says Mr. Perry. "We have to keep reminding
ourselves that hitherto successful firms usually do resolve
their difficulties."</p>
<p>Jim Collins, president of Insight Capital Research &
Management Co., Moraga, Calif., uses a decline in relative
strength as his "early warning signal." Relative strength is
the comparison of a stock's price performance with that of
all other stocks in the market. "It measures investor
enthusiasm, and if this number breaks down, it's often a
forecast of future earnings problems," he says. Individual
investors can chart relative strength by charting the price
of their stocks and comparing them with the price of the
market.</p>
<p>The decision to sell isn't easy no matter which guideline
you follow. "Selling a stock is an ego thing," says Mr.
Collins. "If the stock has gone down, you have to admit you
made a mistake. For most people, this is the most difficult
thing to do."</p>
<p>So most investors end up holding on to their losers "to
get even," says Mr. Farrell. And they sell their winners
quickly to make a small profit, ending up with "a portfolio
of dogs."</p>
<p>In contrast top investors take a lot of small losses and
let their winners run. "Most successful investors have more
losing trades than winning trades but they keep their losses
small," Mr. Roth says.</p>
