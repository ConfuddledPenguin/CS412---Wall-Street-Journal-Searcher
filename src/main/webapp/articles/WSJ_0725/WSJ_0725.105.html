	<p class="article-leader">Computer Associates International Inc. said earnings for
its first quarter ended June 30 plummeted 66% on a 16%
decline in revenue.
   The results were roughly in line with expectations,
revised July 12 when the Garden City, N.Y., software concern
said that revenue would fall significantly and that earnings
would probably decline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Computer Associates shares closed at $9.125, up 50
cents, but still 45% lower than their July 11 closing price
of $16.50.</p>
<p>When Computer Associates announced its expected revenue
decline, Wall Street analysts said they weren't convinced by
the firm's main explanation -- that the sales force spent too
much time explaining a new software strategy called CA '90s
and not enough time selling software.</p>
<p>But Anthony Wang, president, reiterated that explanation,
calling the decline "a near-term disappointment."</p>
<p>Net income fell to $3.6 million, or two cents a share,
from $10.7 million, or six cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue fell to $255.1 million from $303.2 million.</p>
