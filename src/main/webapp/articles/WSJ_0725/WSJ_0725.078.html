	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration, rushing to calm
financial market fears, said it's trying to negotiate a
friendly takeover of Higher Education Assistance Foundation,
the financially troubled guarantor of federal student loans.
   Education Department officials said the government has
opened discussions with United Student Aid Fund, another
large but profitable guarantee agency, about taking over $9.3
billion of HEAF's guaranteed student loans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We have had some discussions" with the government, said
Susan Macey Thompson, an assistant to the chairman of the
student aid fund. But she said that "the characterization of
taking over the HEAF portfolio is an extreme one. . . .
Everything is really preliminary at this point. The
department is looking for some suggestions about what to do."
She said that the student aid fund also was talking with
other guarantee agencies about HEAF. "We're all trying to
sort fact from fiction," she said.</p>
<p>HEAF, a nonprofit corporation based in Overland Park,
Kan., recently told the government that it has serious
financial problems because of high default rates on some of
the loans it has guaranteed. A report of HEAF's difficulties
in Monday's Wall Street Journal triggered fears of spreading
defaults among the $51 billion of guaranteed student loans
outstanding and contributed to Monday's 56.44 point stock
market drop.</p>
<p>At a news conference yesterday, Education Department
officials went out of their way to lay such fears to rest.
"We don't believe that HEAF is the first in a long string of
failures of student-loan guarantee agencies," said Ted
Sanders, undersecretary of education. He said that five or
six of the 55 guarantee agencies may be facing difficulties
because of defaults but that their problems were smaller and
more manageable.</p>
<p>Officials sought to assure both students and banks that
they would continue to have access to the guarantees. "This
situation will not affect the ability of students to obtain
loans, of lenders to make those loans, or of guarantors to
insure those loans," Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos said.
Mr. Sanders added, "We intend to seek a solution that does
continue to guarantee those loans."</p>
<p>Under the program, when a student borrows from a bank, one
of the nation's 55 guarantee agencies insures the loan and
the Education Department reinsures the loan.</p>
<p>In most cases, the Education Department pays the guarantee
agency 100% of the balance on defaulted loans. But that rate
can drop as low as 80% if the guarantee agency's payments on
defaulted loans exceed 9% of the agency's insured loans.</p>
<p>At issue in HEAF's case is $300 million in payments to
banks for defaulted loans. Because HEAF has a high default
rate on the loans it has guaranteed, it stands to receive
only 80% of that amount, or $240 million. One question is how
much, if any, of this $60 million the government will pay as
part of an effort to work out an orderly transfer of HEAF's
assets.</p>
<p>"This is not a big federal bailout," said Thomas Scully,
an associate director of the Office of Management and Budget.
"The liability to the taxpayer is very narrow. It's not a
huge budget problem."</p>
<p>A team of investigators from the Education Department and
the OMB arrived at HEAF's St. Paul, Minn., computer facility
Monday to review the agency's records. It's unlikely that any
organization will take over HEAF's assets until the
examination is complete, and that could take several days,
officials said.</p>
<p>In a statement, HEAF said it's cooperating with the
government and "pursuing on its own additional options that
would enable us to restore confidence" to the guarantee
program. In a separate statement, the Student Loan Marketing
Association, one of HEAF's largest creditors, reasserted its
belief that it faces "no material risk of loss or other
adverse effects as a result of HEAF's financial situation."</p>
<p>HEAF has guarantees outstanding on $9.3 billion of loans
that aren't in default, although some of these loans are
expected to go sour. Over the years, HEAF aggressively
marketed its guarantees to proprietary schools for
hairdressers, truck drivers and others that subsequently
proved to have high default rates.</p>
<p>The government must decide how much protection it's
willing to provide the United Student Aid Fund or others
against loss on this portfolio. If the student aid fund
doesn't take the entire portfolio, it could be split among
other guarantee agencies.</p>
<p>The government also must decide what to do with $2 billion
of defaulted loans on which the government has reimbursed
HEAF over the years. If a guarantee agency collects from the
students, the agency gets to keep 30% of the total. If the
government collects, the government gets to keep 100%. The
Education Department, which collects 65% of the defaulted
loans it goes after, is considering taking over the entire $2
billion.</p>
<p>Student-loan defaults have been a problem for years,
despite efforts to tighten the program. For fiscal 1990, the
government has budgeted $2 billion to cover the cost of
defaults, up from $1.4 billion two years ago.</p>
