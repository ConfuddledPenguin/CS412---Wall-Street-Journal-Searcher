	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Peter Rona, president and chief executive
officer of IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust Co., a unit of
Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., will resign today, according
to people close to Mr. Rona and the bank.
   Succeeding Mr. Rona on a temporary basis will be Edward
Hamway, an executive vice president and head of IBJ
Schroder's credit committee.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Rona, according to people familiar with his plans,
intends to set up his own firm, which will specialize in
Hungarian investments and acquisitions. The 48-year-old
executive was born in Hungary and emigrated to the U.S. as a
teenager after the Hungarian uprising in 1956. Reached at
home last night, he declined to comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Rona is an Oxford-educated lawyer who graduated first
in his class and then joined Arnold & Porter, a Washington,
D.C., law firm. He later became general counsel of J. Henry
Schroder Bank & Trust Co., and was named chief executive when
IBJ purchased the bank in late 1985 from Schroder Group PLC,
a British merchant bank.</p>
<p>IBJ Schroder is a small commercial bank specializing in
serving middle-market U.S. companies, as well as some major
international corporations. IBJ also has used the bank to
advise its Japanese clients on U.S. mergers and acquisitions,
in which Mr. Rona played a leadership role.</p>
<p>During Mr. Rona's tenure, IBJ Schroder purchased Aubrey G.
Lanston & Co., a primary dealer in U.S. government
securities. The U.S. bank also advised Nippon Mining Co. in
its $1.1 billion acquisition of Gould Inc. and Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. in its recent purchase of Subaru of America
Ltd.</p>
<p>Mr. Rona, people close to him said, has maintained strong
feelings for his former homeland and now plans to take his
merger expertise to the Hungarian market. He has advised
several U.S. corporations on investing in Hungary, including
Samsonite Corp., which decided to set up a luggage
manufacturing operation in Hungary to serve the European
market. The company had originally considered building its
operation in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Bankers said Mr. Rona's fluency in Hungarian and close
relations with senior officials in the new government should
give him a competitive edge in advising U.S. firms on
investments in eastern European countries.</p>
