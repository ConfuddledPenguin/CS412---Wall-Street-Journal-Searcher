	<p class="article-leader">REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- The Icelandic language has two Old
English letters and far too many new English words. At least
that's the view of many Icelanders, who dislike foreign
phrases cluttering up their ancient tongue. To slow the
spread of "jogurt" and "hamborgarar," Icelanders now are
purging their vocabulary by finding old words for new things.
   Icelandic has changed so little in the past 800 years that
"some parts of the sagas could have been written this
morning," says Baldar Jonsson, head of the Icelandic Language
Institute. But the Vikings didn't have computers. Modern
Icelanders do. They call them "tolva," a merger of two
medieval words, meaning "numbers prophetess." The word for
telephone, "simi," translates as "long thread." A military
tank is "skrithdreki," or "crawling dragon."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Iceland now has committees grappling with foreign phrases
in 30 fields, from aviation to physics. Amateur wordsmiths
often send in ideas of their own. It is a task for which
Icelanders are well-suited. Per capita, Iceland has more
bookstores and Trivial Pursuit games than any nation in the
world. Long, dark winters also afford ample time for
brainstorming.</p>
<p>Iceland isn't alone in fighting to keep its language pure.
France has long done battle with "Franglais," but linguistic
patriotism is hard to enforce in such a big and cosmopolitan
land.</p>
<p>In remote, sea-locked Iceland, the war against Icelish
appears more successful. New words are published in journals
and quickly filter out through classrooms, dictionaries and
the media. In a society of only 250,000 people, it doesn't
take long for word to travel, and to catch on.</p>
<p>Mr. Jonsson helped compose two words for AIDS. One is
"alnaemi," which roughly translates as "sensitive to
everything." The other is "eythni," derived from an old verb
meaning "to squander."</p>
<p>Kirstin Flygenring, an economist, is combing William
Branson's "Macroeconomic Theory," listing terms such as
"liquidity trap" for which Icelandic substitutes are needed.
Sometimes, a literal translation will do. The "gross" in
gross national product, for instance, is easily derived from
an Icelandic word meaning "polluted" or "unfiltered." But
colloquialisms don't translate so easily. Iceland doesn't
have junk bonds or greenmail (or even a stock exchange), and
"putting some of these words into Icelandic can make them
confusing and a little silly," Ms. Flygenring says.</p>
<p>In a related campaign, Icelanders also are weeding out
foreign names. Traditionally, Icelanders have been known by
first names only, followed by a patronymic; hence, Jon, the
son of Thor, is Jon Thorsson, and his sister's last name is
Thorssdottir. Iceland's slim phone book is alphabetized by
first names, and Icelanders rarely use Mr. or Mrs., except
when traveling abroad.</p>
<p>But over the past century, many Icelanders have taken
middle names and also adopted non-Icelandic surnames. To stem
this tide, Iceland's parliament, or Althing, is expected to
toughen an existing ban on non-Icelandic surnames and also to
establish a formal list of acceptable forenames.</p>
<p>"Names are part of our language and if we lose them we
lose our history," says Guthrun Kvaran, who is drafting the
law. While aimed at preserving tradition, the law also
acknowledges modern trends. Children born out of wedlock will
be able to take their mother's name.</p>
<p>Immigrants who become Icelandic citizens also must take
new names and pass them on to their children. Hence, a
Vietnamese refugee named Tran Dat Phat now is Petur Tran Dat
Phat, and his children take the name Petursson or
Petursdottir.</p>
<p>One notable exception to this rule is Vladimir Ashkenazy,
the Soviet pianist and conductor who was allowed to keep his
name after becoming an Icelander. (His wife is Icelandic, but
he now spends more of his time in Switzerland.)</p>
<p>The Ashkenazy case inspired a Spanish immigrant in
Reykjavik, unhappy at having to adopt an Icelandic name, to
lodge a bizarre protest. As the Russian pianist's name was
now an approved Icelandic moniker, the Spaniard announced
that he wanted to take Vladimir Ashkenazy as his name, too.
Officials were amused but unmoved.</p>
