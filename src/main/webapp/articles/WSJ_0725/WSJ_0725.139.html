	<p class="article-leader">BellSouth Enterprises, a unit of BellSouth Corp., said it
has applied to the Federal Communications Commission for an
experimental radio license to conduct a personal
communications network trial in Atlanta, Ga.
   The trial, which is to take place in two phases, is
intended to test the market for wireless telecommunications,
such as radio telephones. BellSouth said it wants to look at
how such services meet consumer needs and how they change the
consumer patterns.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BellSouth is already conducting a nationwide study of
broad-based marketing opportunities for personal
communications networks. This study is intended to build on
the results of the first study, particularly in the way
potential business customers would use the networks.</p>
<p>Results are expected in two years.</p>
