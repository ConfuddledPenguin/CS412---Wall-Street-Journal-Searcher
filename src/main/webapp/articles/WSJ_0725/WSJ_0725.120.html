	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- General Motors Corp. said it plans to build
a fleet of 1,000 low-polluting natural-gas-powered pickup
trucks next year in a joint effort with a consortium of 10
California, Texas and Colorado utilities.
   General Motors' GMC Truck division will produce the
natural gas trucks and sell them through selected GMC
dealers, with particular emphasis on fleet buyers in
California and Texas, a company spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Consortium members plan to use the vehicles in their work
fleets. For example, San Francisco-based Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. intends to buy 30 to 50 of the vehicles at an
expected cost of $15,000 each. PG&E also will sell the gas
for the trucks for about 57 cents a "compressed therm" --
equivalent to about a gallon of gasoline -- at a pumping
station in Concord, Calif., and 13 others set to open this
year.</p>
<p>PAS Inc. of Troy, Mich., will develop and install the fuel
system.</p>
<p>The consortium is providing $935,000 to help cover the
costs of design and production of the vehicles.</p>
<p>Other members of the energy consortium include: San Diego
Gas & Electric Co., San Diego; Southern California Gas Co.,
Los Angeles; El Paso Natural Gas Co, El Paso; Energas Co.,
Midland, Texas; Enron Corp. and Entex, both of Houston; Lone
Star Gas Co., Dallas; Southern Union Gas Co., Austin, Texas,
and Natural Fuels Corp., Denver.</p>
