	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Mitel Corp. said it filed a claim in a Florida
court against American Telephone & Telegraph Co. for
allegedly spreading "misleading information" about the
company.
   The value of the claim wasn't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>John Jarvis, Mitel president, told a shareholders' meeting
here that AT&T suggested in letters to Mitel's U.S. customers
that British Telecommunications PLC's plan to sell its 51%
interest in Mitel was "a cause for concern" about Mitel's
future. Mr. Jarvis said the AT&T letters offered Mitel
customers a trade-in allowance if they exchanged Mitel's
telephone switching system for an AT&T product.</p>
<p>A spokesman for New York-based AT&T said he had just
learned of the Mitel claim and couldn't comment on it until
it was examined.</p>
<p>Mr. Jarvis said AT&T's "aspersions" about Mitel's
"viability" were "without foundation." He said it was too
soon to assess what negative impact the "misleading
information" would have on Mitel. Mr. Jarvis said the company
was concerned that its "future business prospects and
reputation" could be damaged.</p>
<p>Mr. Jarvis told shareholders that a "number of very
impressive companies" have expressed interest in buying
British Telecommunications' stake in Mitel. He said British
Telecommunications is talking to some of the companies.</p>
<p>Mitel also reported yesterday that the company had a net
loss of 3.1 million Canadian dollars (US$2.7 million) on
revenue of C$100 million in the first quarter ended June 29.
In the year earlier, Mitel had net income of C$4.2 million on
revenue of C$102.7 million.</p>
<p>Mitel shares closed at C$2.45 a share on the Toronto Stock
Exchange, down 15 Canadian cents.</p>
<p>Mr. Jarvis said Mitel's first-quarter loss was in line
with the company's expectations. He said Mitel's forecasts
and advanced bookings had indicated a slow start in the year,
but he said there are some early indications that the Kanata,
Ontario, company has increased its market share in Britain in
the second quarter.</p>
<p>"It is clear that these two facts taken together, slow
sales and market share increases, indicate the difficult
nature of the market and the appropriateness of our strategy
to become a more broadly based telecommunications company,"
he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Jarvis said Mitel's sales outside North America were
down more than 8% in the first quarter from a year earlier.
Mr. Jarvis said he was confident that Mitel will have a
"positive performance" in these markets as the year develops.</p>
<p>Mr. Jarvis said orders in markets outside North America
have been "quite strong" in recent weeks. He predicted the
company would have an upturn in sales in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Mr. Jarvis also said Mitel plans to launch a major
advertising campaign in the fall "aimed at increasing
awareness of the company" in the U.S. and Britain. He said it
will help "counter the misleading information" distributed by
AT&T.</p>
