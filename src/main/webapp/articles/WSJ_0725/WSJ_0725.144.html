	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Citizens & Southern Corp. and Sovran Financial
Corp. said their plans to merge were approved by the Federal
Reserve Board.
   Moreover, the two bank holding companies said they decided
to abandon the name they had chosen -- Avantor Financial
Corp. -- in favor of the more prosaic C&S/Sovran Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The companies began using Avantor when they announced
plans for the merger in September. But since then, they have
heard from "our customers, employees, communities and
shareholders," said Albert B. Gornto, Sovran's chairman and
chief executive officer. "Their input," he said in a prepared
statement, "reinforced the value of retaining and
incorporating into our new name the names under which we have
historically operated so successfully."</p>
<p>Bennett A. Brown, Citizens & Southern's chairman and chief
executive, who will hold both those posts in the new company,
said he expects the merger to be completed by Aug. 31,
pending a 30-day review by the Justice Department. Citizens &
Southern is based in Atlanta; Sovran is in Norfolk, Va.</p>
<p>With $50 billion in assets and more than 1,000 banking
offices in seven states and Washington, D.C., C&S/ Sovran
will be the 12th largest bank holding company in the nation.</p>
