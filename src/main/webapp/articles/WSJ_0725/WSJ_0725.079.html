	<p class="article-leader">ROCKFORD, Ill. -- Sundstrand Corp., as expected, offered
to acquire the 85% of Milton Roy Co. that it doesn't already
own, for $28 a share, or about $126.4 million.
   Earlier this month, Sundstrand disclosed that it had
accumulated about a 15% stake in Milton Roy, a St.
Petersburg, Fla.-based maker of instrumentation and control
equipment, and said it would seek to acquire the company.
Milton Roy has about 5.3 million common shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Sundstrand shares closed at $33.875, unchanged. Milton Roy's
shares rose $3.50, closing at $26.875.</p>
<p>Last year, Milton Roy had sales of $125 million.
Sundstrand, which makes aerospace and industrial equipment,
had 1989 sales of $1.60 billion.</p>
<p>In a letter to Milton Roy, Sundstrand said its all-cash
offer will remain open until the close of business on July
30, unless extended by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>The proposal, which isn't contingent on financing, is
subject to the approval of Milton Roy's directors, and a due
diligence review of Milton Roy by Sundstrand as well as the
negotiation of a definitive merger agreement.</p>
<p>Sundstrand's president and chief executive officer, Harry
C. Stonecipher, requested that Milton Roy's board avoid using
certain anti-takeover provisions and warned that failure to
do so would impair Milton Roy's ability to complete a
negotiated merger.</p>
<p>Milton Roy said the proposal would be considered by its
board and "given proper evaluation in due course."</p>
