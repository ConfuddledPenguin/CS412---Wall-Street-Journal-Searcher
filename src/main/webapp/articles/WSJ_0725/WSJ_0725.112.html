	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Morgan Stanley Group Inc. stock was hammered
as the big securities firm posted a 48% drop in
second-quarter earnings, its weakest quarter in nearly two
years.
   Salomon Inc. reported second-quarter profit that was
halved from record yearearlier results. Two regional brokers
posted mixed results.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Morgan Stanley, dragged down by a 27% drop in investment
banking revenue, reported net income of $58 million, or $1.44
a share, down from $112.1 million, or $2.83 a share, a year
earlier. The year-earlier results were bolstered by a
one-time merchant banking gain.</p>
<p>With some analysts expecting Morgan Stanley to earn as
much as $2 a share, the firm's stock was pummeled, falling
$6, or 8.3%, to $66.50 in heavy New York Stock Exchange
trading. The drop highlights how Wall Street recently has
punished companies -- even its own -- for earnings
disappointments, analysts said.</p>
<p>"It's a sign of the times," said James Hanbury, an analyst
at Wertheim Schroder & Co. Wall Street was thrown, he said,
because until now, Morgan Stanley "had always delivered the
goods."</p>
<p>Revenue at Morgan Stanley fell 5% in the second quarter to
$1.45 billion from $1.52 billion. Trading revenue -- a big
earnings driver in the first quarter -- fell 11% to $201.6
million from $226.5 million. Asset management revenue and
stock commissions rose modestly.</p>
<p>In a statement, Morgan Stanley officials said operating
performance "was affected by the continuing decline in
overall volume of investment banking business" and attributed
the trading drop largely to "decreased volatility in the
foreign exchange market." Much of the firm's first-quarter
trading gains stemmed from international stock markets.</p>
<p>The last time Morgan Stanley earned less was 1988's third
quarter, when its net was $52.5 million.</p>
<p>For the six months, Morgan Stanley earned $140.2 million,
or $3.51 a share, down from $193.3 million, or $4.86 a share,
a year earlier. Six-month revenue rose 3.2% to $2.84 billion
from $2.75 billion.</p>
<p>Salomon earned twice as much as Morgan Stanley in the
second quarter, although it fell far short of its record
earnings in the 1989 second quarter. Salomon's net in the
most recent quarter slumped 53% to $120 million, or 89 cents
a share, from $253 million, or $1.89 a share. Revenue fell
10% to $2.1 billion from $2.33 billion.</p>
<p>Earnings at Salomon's securities unit, Salomon Brothers
Inc., were bolstered by trading gains and an improvement in
investment banking revenue, particularly from stock
underwriting and advisory fees from a handful of merger
deals. The securities unit earned $211 million before taxes
in the quarter, compared with record pretax profit of $364
million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Salomon Inc.'s Phibro Energy unit rebounded a bit,
reflecting stronger refinery margins. Phibro earned $49
million before taxes in the second quarter, a 47% drop from
$92 million a year earlier but far above $4 million in this
year's first quarter.</p>
<p>Salomon's Philipp Brothers commodity unit continued to
perform poorly; analysts say the unit soon will be sharply
cut back. Philipp reported a $62 million pretax loss for the
second quarter, far wider than the $3 million pretax loss a
year earlier. Salomon said "adverse trading results" in
agricultural commodities hammered the unit's performance. In
past quarters, the villain was nonferrous metals trading.</p>
<p>As a result, Salomon has told analysts it will drastically
cut back its commodity inventory and will restructure the
unit, resulting in significant layoffs. "If it doesn't
completely disband, lots of heads will be rolling," said one
analyst who was briefed by the firm. Salomon declined to
comment.</p>
<p>For the six months, Salomon reported net of $239 million,
up 6% from $225 million in the year-earlier period. Revenue
jumped 15% to $4.45 billion from $3.87 billion. Salomon
shares closed unchanged at $24.50 in Big Board composite
trading.</p>
<p>Two smaller regional firms posted mixed results.</p>
<p>Alex. Brown Inc., Baltimore, reported a 6.7% increase in
second-quarter net to $4.5 million, or 29 cents a share, from
$4.3 million, or 26 cents a share. Earnings at Piper Jaffray
Inc., Minneapolis, fell 8.6% in the second quarter to $3.1
million, or 74 cents a share, from $3.35 million, or 83 cents
a share.</p>
