	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commodity Futures Trading Commission
charged four New York Mercantile Exchange traders with fraud
in handling customer orders, the first government charges
from the 1989 investigation of the New York futures
exchanges.
   CFTC officials said the case is only the first of a series
it expects to bring in the next few months. But the complaint
comes just two weeks after federal prosecutors suffered a
setback in a similar case in Chicago. In that case against
three Chicago Mercantile Exchange traders, the jury reached
guilty verdicts on only eight of more than 100 charges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The CFTC charged Douglas Friedman of Forest Hills, N.Y.;
Michael Pomerantz of Scarsdale, N.Y.; Lawrence Beck of Fort
Lee, N.J.; John King of Old Bridge, N.J.; and MSP Trading
Inc., a firm owned by Mr. Pomerantz. All are registered with
the CFTC as floor brokers, although Mr. Friedman trades
primarily for his own account, the CFTC said. Messrs.
Pomerantz, Beck and King declined to comment; Mr. Friedman
couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>The CFTC hasn't determined the amount of damages it is
seeking in the nine-count administrative complaint, and none
of the defendants has settled the case.</p>
<p>Federal investigators swooped down on New York's major
commodity exchanges in May 1989, seizing records and issuing
subpoenas to as many as 50 futures traders as part of a probe
of possible criminal and civil violations. The investigation,
which was much smaller than the separate Chicago undercover
investigation, focused on several alleged trading abuses,
according to people familiar with the New York inquiry.</p>
<p>The agency said that 34 times between July and December
1988, Messrs. Pomerantz, Beck and King executed, with Mr.
Friedman's help, noncompetitive buy and sell transactions on
crude oil-futures trades for customers on the New York
exchange's floor. The CFTC said the transactions allowed the
brokers to trade for their own accounts, against their
customer orders.</p>
<p>The CFTC alleged that Messrs. Pomerantz, Beck and King,
helped by Mr. Friedman, deceived customers and defrauded or
tried to defraud customers. It also said that Mr. Friedman,
helped by the others, engaged in fictitious sales and caused
untrue prices to be reported.</p>
<p>The alleged misdeeds, which will be decided at a hearing
by a CFTC administrative law judge, carry potentially massive
penalties. The Commodity Exchange Act allows the CFTC to fine
the traders $100,000 for each violation, several of which may
have taken place in each trade, the agency said. The traders
also could have their trading privileges revoked.</p>
<p>The four probably won't be the last CFTC targets in the
New York investigation. "I am confident there will be further
recommendations of charges to the commission," said Dennis
Klejna, the agency's enforcement director. The commission
must approve any recommendation by the enforcement division.</p>
<p>The charges will be closely watched, coming on the heels
of the first decision in the Chicago case. While prosecutors
in that case had obtained guilty-plea agreements from several
defendants, much was riding on the recent jury trial. The
jury's verdict left the government's case uncertain.</p>
<p>But Mr. Klejna said he didn't give all that much thought
to the Chicago decision. "What happened in Chicago has not
emboldened us or discouraged us in any way," he said. The
CFTC complaint is an administrative charge, which carries a
lesser burden of proof than that of criminal cases.</p>
<p>One Chicago lawyer suggested that the CFTC could be
strengthened by the Chicago decision. The CFTC has been
"doing the job, and what it's said about the market over the
years is borne out" by the failure of prosecutors to prove
widespread fraud in the Chicago markets, said John
Troelstrup, a partner at Gottlieb & Schwartz. Now, he added,
he expects to see the CFTC act more aggressively toward
exchange activities.</p>
