	<p class="article-leader">Northern Telecom Ltd., buoyed by lower costs and strong
orders, posted a 27% rise in second-quarter net income and a
12% increase in revenues.
   Net income at the Canadian telecommunications equipment
manufacturer was $95.7 million or 37 cents per share compared
with $75.3 million or 29 cents per share in last year's
second period. Revenues in the quarter were $1.7 billion
versus $1.52 billion last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the first six months, revenues rose 13% to $3.27
billion from $2.9 billion in last year's first half. Net
income rose 37% to $174.8 million or 67 cents per share from
$127.9 million or 49 cents per share last year.</p>
<p>"I'm reasonably pleased by our results," said chairman
Paul G. Stern. "The growth performance was across the board
in all our markets, U.S., Canada and overseas. And we
benefited from lower interest expenses and our cash is
strong."</p>
<p>Order input for the quarter was $1.71 billion, a 7.5%
increase over the $1.59 billion recorded in last year's
period. Order backlog for the period was $1.85 billion, a 9%
increase from last year's $1.7 billion.</p>
<p>Order input and backlog growth failed to match the 16%
growth in last year's second quarter. But Mr. Stern said, "We
have not seen a slowdown. Orders tend to fluctuate from
quarter to quarter. . . We're going to have a respectable
year, barring a disaster, which we don't see."</p>
