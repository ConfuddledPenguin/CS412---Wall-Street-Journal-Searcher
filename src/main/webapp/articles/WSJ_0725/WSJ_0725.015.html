	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Gold futures prices couldn't sustain Monday's
surge and fell back under renewed selling.
   August delivery gold ended with a loss of $1.30 an ounce
at $368.40. September silver was down 7.3 cents an ounce to
$4.8550. October platinum declined $4.70 an ounce to $482.90.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>General profit-taking after Monday's advance and a selling
of bullion by Middle Eastern interests and European dealers
contributed to initial weakness in gold futures, analysts
said. Only the fact that crude oil prices were strong, which
has inflationary implications, kept gold from falling
further, an analyst said.</p>
<p>The dollar, particularly in the latter part of the day,
was mixed but stronger than on Monday, and that factor
weighed on gold as well.</p>
<p>Volume and open interest figures for gold and silver
appear to show that Monday's rally was more of a liquidating
spree than an emergence of fresh demand to push prices
higher.</p>
<p>A total of 69,179 contracts were traded in gold, and the
open interest, or number of contracts outstanding that remain
to be nullified by opposite trades or fulfilled by delivery
of the commodity, fell 2,676 to 101,789.</p>
<p>In silver, trading totaled 13,175 contracts, and open
interest declined by 634 contracts to 98,426.</p>
<p>"While that's not a good sign technically, gold actually
behaved very well in not falling sharply, considering the
negative factors it had to contend with," one analyst said.</p>
<p>Analysts also noted that the August contract wasn't able
to crack above Monday's intraday high of $371.50. The highest
price August could post yesterday was $371.00, which they
said was another contributing factor in the weakness.</p>
<p>Ian MacDonald, vice president of Credit Suisse, New York,
maintained a positive view of gold despite yesterday's
setback. He said that a drop of a little more than $1 an
ounce after an $8 rally was a good performance.</p>
<p>"Prior to Monday, the market was very, very much oversold,
and the stock market plunge may have been more of an excuse
than a reason for gold prices to advance," he said. "Even if
the stock market drop hadn't happened, gold might have risen
because it was ready to do so."</p>
<p>Mr. MacDonald said the market was trying to consolidate
and most of yesterday's selling was profit-taking.</p>
<p>"Demand all over the world is strong for gold in all its
forms -- bars, wafers and what have you," Mr. MacDonald said.
"And when you have that kind of constant demand, it has to be
reflected in prices. I believe gold will be closer to $400
than to $350 by the end of the year."</p>
<p>Dinsa Mehta, chief bullion trader at Chase Manhattan Bank,
New York, said widespread producer selling appeared Monday
and hit futures again yesterday when August gold was trading
between $367 and $370, triggering the profit-taking that set
prices back. Notwithstanding yesterday's correction, he said,
the market is poised to go higher.</p>
<p>He said the recent change in attitude by Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, the tension between Iraq and Kuwait
and the breakout above $367 by the August contract, which
created a stronger technical situation, all contributed to
Monday's gain and will continue to have a price-supporting
effect.</p>
<p>In particular, he cited a change in emphasis by Fed
Chairman Greenspan away from inflation fighting and "somewhat
more toward recession fighting." He added: "This is an
important psychological issue. It also could set a trend
toward the Fed injecting more liquidity into the banking
system, which could set the stage for a more inflationary
environment. This favors gold."</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Prices of cattle futures contracts
rose amid signs that the slaughter is picking up this month,
said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp.,
Arlington Heights, Ill. A rise in the slaughter is easing
earlier concerns that cattle were backing up on feedlots in
such numbers as to potentially create a glut of fattened
cattle late in the year. Buyers also were attracted by the
drop in cattle futures prices Monday; that decline was caused
by jitters over the plummeting stock market. Prices of hog
futures contracts settled mixed. After plunging last week,
prices appeared to stabilize at least momentarily amid signs
of a slight pickup in demand for pork by retailers. Hog
prices were under pressure last week in part because of
concern that consumers were resisting high prices for pork in
supermarkets.</p>
<p>COCOA: There was no fresh news in cocoa but great
volatility in futures, whose prices ended only slightly
higher. The September contract was up $9 a metric ton at
$1,268. Initially, prices plunged to as low as $1,202, a drop
of $57, on heavy selling, an analyst said. Around noon EDT,
however, the market suddenly turned around and shot up,
recovering its loss and showing a net gain on equally
aggressive buying, the analyst said. "No one seemed to know
why the waves of buying and selling took place, but it
appeared that the buyers were the same people who sold
earlier," the analyst said.</p>
<p>SUGAR: Futures prices rose. The October contract advanced
0.13 cent a pound to 11.27 cents. A rumor that China had
bought between 20,000 tons and 100,000 tons of raw and
refined sugar helped the October price surge as high as 11.45
cents a pound. According to Merrill Lynch analyst Judith
Ganes, the amount China bought was probably in the middle of
that range. China has been out of the market for a long time
as a buyer because of high prices, Ms. Ganes said. However,
the purchases, if they occurred, would be near the price
level at which China said late last year it would be willing
to buy sugar, she said. "China said it would buy at around
10.50 cents {a pound}, and current prices aren't far from
that," Ms. Ganes said.</p>
