	<p class="article-leader">Elders Resources NZFP Ltd. raised its bid for Oakbridge
Ltd. to 88 Australian cents (69 U.S. cents) a share, matching
an offer made Monday.
   Australian coal miner McIlwraith McEacharn Ltd. is leading
a consortium with Toyo Menka Kaisha Ltd. and Nippon Oil Ltd.,
both of Japan, in a bid for control of Oakbridge, another
Australian coal company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Elders is a New Zealand-based natural-resources company.</p>
<p>The McIlwraith consortium is trying to pressure Elders to
sell it the 85% of Oakbridge that Elders holds.</p>
<p>Elders said it raised its bid to 88 cents a share from 86
cents. That offer will be raised to 90 cents if Elders wins
90% of Oakbridge.</p>
<p>John Cornelius, Elders secretary, said in a statement to
the Australian Stock Exchange that the McIlwraith bid is
"highly presumptuous." He added: "We are buyers of Oakbridge,
not sellers. Elders Resources has made no decision to sell
Oakbridge or any other assets for that matter."</p>
