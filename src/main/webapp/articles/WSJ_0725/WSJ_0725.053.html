	<p class="article-leader">BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Niagara Exchange Corp. said it has
rescinded an agreement under which W.R. Berkley Corp.,
Greenwich, Conn., had purchased 970,000 shares of Niagara
preferred stock for $8.2 million.
   The agreement was disallowed by the New York Department of
Insurance. Niagara sought the investment to replace funds
paid out last year by a Niagara subsidiary on claims arising
from Hurricane Hugo.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Niagara and W.R. Berkley are both property and casualty
insurance holding companies. The companies said they are
continuing to discuss a possible investment in Niagara by
Berkley.</p>
