	<p class="article-leader">Johnson & Johnson said net income for the second quarter
rose 19% on strong performance by pharmaceutical and
professional-equipment segments.
   Net income was $353 million, or $1.06 a share, compared
with $297 million, or 89 cents a share, in the year-earlier
period. Sales rose 18% to $2.83 billion from $2.39 billion in
the year-earlier period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ralph S. Larsen, chairman and chief executive officer of
the New Brunswick, N.J., company, said sales in the
pharmaceutical and professional-equipment segments rose 26%
and 21%, respectively. The latter includes medical, surgical
and diagnostic equipment. Particularly successful was Ortho
Diagnostics, the company said, which achieved record results
after successfully introducing a hepatitis C test in the U.S.
during the quarter. Consumer products sales rose 11%.</p>
<p>Net income for the first half fell 2.8% to $597 million,
or $1.79 a share, from $614 million, or $1.84 a share, in the
year-earlier period, because of a first-quarter non-recurring
charge for the permanent impairment of certain assets and
operations in Latin America. Without the charge, six-month
net would have risen 18% to $722 million, or $2.17 a share.
Sales for the first half rose 17% to $5.66 billion.</p>
