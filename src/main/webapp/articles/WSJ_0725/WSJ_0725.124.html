	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The bond market ended lower again after
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan failed to convince
investors that the nation's central bank remains tough on
inflation.
   In part-two of his semiannual economic report to Congress,
Mr. Greenspan said the Fed has no intention of backing away
from its goal of zero inflation and that central bank
policies will eventually bring prices down.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But his words weren't enough to inspire confidence in the
battered bond market, which turned overwhelmingly bearish on
July 13 when the Fed cut the federal funds rate by 1/4
percentage point to 8%. The rate is what banks charge each
other on overnight loans.</p>
<p>"Barely a week after announcing an easing in the face of
bad inflation numbers, he's trying to convince us he's
shooting for zero inflation. You don't have to be cynical to
raise your eyebrows at that," said Robert Brusca, an
economist at Nikko Securities Co.</p>
<p>In the view of Mr. Brusca and many other economists, the
Fed chairman never fully explained why the central bank cut
rates. But the markets interpreted the move -- rightly or
wrongly -- as a sign that the Fed is abandoning its fight
against inflation and instead wants to stimulate economic
growth. And nothing he said yesterday convinced analysts
otherwise.</p>
<p>The Fed chairman, "got so much criticism last week for not
addressing inflation that he tried to make up for it this
time by making a special effort to say that the Fed is still
fighting inflation. But the bond market didn't care. They
expected him to say that," said Charles Lieberman, a managing
director at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon Bank Corp.,
said that investors' fears of inflation were heightened
somewhat yesterday after the Department of Labor reported
that its employment cost index, a broad measure of wage
inflation, rose 5.4% in the 12 months that ended in June.</p>
<p>"The report shows that while inflation is not getting any
worse, it's not getting any better," said Mr. Robertson.
"It's really rather startling to realize that the inflation
rate has been stuck at {current levels} for the several
years," even while "we've had monetary restraint and sluggish
economic growth."</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended about 3/8
point lower, a loss of about $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction of its price, rose to 8.58%.</p>
<p>Bond prices opened lower in the wake of selling by
investors in Tokyo and London. Traders attribute that selling
in part to concern that oil prices might soon rise due to
heightened tensions between Iraq and Kuwait, both members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>
<p>Those concerns were underscored by an article in the
Washington Post that said Iraq moved 30,000 troops to its
border with Kuwait and the U.S. ordered its warships in the
Persian Gulf on alert.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Prices of Treasury securities ended lower again. The
benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101
21/32, down from 102 on Monday. The latest two-year notes
ended slightly lower at 100 14/32, down from 100 15/32 on
Monday. The yield on the two-year note ended at 8.10%, up
from 8.07% Monday.</p>
<p>Treasury bill rates rose yesterday. The discount rate on
three-month bills ended at 7.58% to yield 7.81% while the
rate on six-month bills rose to 7.45% to yield 7.83%.</p>
<p>Today, the Treasury will sell a record $11.25 billion
two-year notes. Most analysts expect the sale to proceed
smoothly. In when-issued trading yesterday, the yield on the
two-year notes was about 8.11%, up from 8.06% late Monday in
New York.</p>
<p>Mortgage, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Prices of mortgage securities ended off as much as 3/8
point in quiet trading.</p>
<p>Among secondary issues for August delivery, 9.5%
securities issued by the Government National Mortgage
Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and the
Federal National Mortgage Association were all off 11/32.</p>
<p>In the asset-backed market, a unit of Chrysler Corp.,
Chrysler Auto Receivables Co., sold $1 billion of securities
backed by retail installment contracts on new or used autos
and light trucks. The offering was priced by Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets and was completely sold. A Merrill official
said the issue will begin trading today in the secondary
market.</p>
<p>The offering was priced at 8.75% at 99 23/32 to yield
8.856%. Expected final maturity is July 15, 1993.</p>
<p>Corporate Bonds</p>
<p>The junk bonds of Trump Taj Mahal Funding Inc. were
knocked sharply lower yesterday on speculation that the
Atlantic City casino's operator, Donald Trump, may be forced
to pay hefty legal claims related to the 1988 sale of Resorts
International to Merv Griffin.</p>
<p>Resorts is currently restructuring under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code. As reported in this newspaper
Tuesday, a novel feature of Resorts' reorganization plan
provides for a trust to be established and funded to pursue
for the benefit of Resorts' creditors "all claims the debtors
and their affiliates may have against Donald Trump, Trump Taj
Mahal Associates L.P.," and other Trump affiliates.</p>
<p>Trump Taj Mahal's 14% first mortgage bonds fell 2 1/4
points to 48 1/4 on the American Stock Exchange while Trump
Castle Funding Inc.'s 13.75% first mortgage bonds slipped 7/8
point to finish at 59 5/8.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of R.H. Macy & Co., which managed to
outperform the broader market Monday, weakened on
profit-taking. The retailer's 14.5% senior subordinated
debentures lost 1 1/2 points to end at 74 1/2 while Macy's
14.5% subordinated debentures fell 2 points to end at 63.</p>
<p>In the broader junk bond market, most high-yield
speculative-grade securities stabilized after slipping Monday
in the face of a sell-off in the stock market.</p>
<p>Municipal Securities</p>
<p>Tax-exempt issues ended unchanged to 1/8 point lower.</p>
<p>In the primary market, a total of 76 bids from 24
underwriting firms were placed for an issue of $1.1 billion
New York State general obligation tax anticipation notes sold
this session.</p>
<p>All of the notes carry a 6.25% coupon and will be
reoffered to yield 5.90%. The notes are rated MIG-1 by
Moody's Investors Service Inc. and SP1-Plus by Standard &
Poor's Corp.</p>
<p>Underwriters at several of the firms that purchased the
notes reported good institutional interest in the notes,
along with a smattering of retail buying.</p>
<p>The institutional demand is attributed to the high ratings
and the size of the issue.</p>
<p>Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% of 2018 are off 1/8 point at 99 1/4 to
yield 7.25%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>The Japanese government-bond market staged a modest
recovery yesterday, but dealers said that sentiment remains
fundamentally bearish.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market initially was supported by the
Bank of Japan buying commercial paper at 7.41%, lower than
Monday's commercial paper rate of 7.44%.</p>
<p>That was the second consecutive day that Japan's central
bank purchased commercial paper. The market didn't respond
favorably when the Bank of Japan purchased commercial paper
on Monday, but yesterday's purchase did support the market.</p>
<p>Still, dealers say underlying sentiment remains bearish.
"Short-term rates are still high," said a dealer at a
Japanese securities firm. "Investors aren't buying in the yen
bond market."</p>
<p>The overnight unsecured call money rates rose slightly
yesterday to 7.56% and rates on new three-month certificates
were unchanged at about 7.7%.</p>
<p>Dealers said reports that Iraq moved several thousand
troops close to its border with Kuwait, escalating their
dispute over oil policy, caused Japanese bonds to fall
temporarily. But the market soon recovered.</p>
<p>At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year bond was 85.86, up
0.11 point, to yield 7.445%. (Japanese bond yields are quoted
here in local terms and therefore differ from yields
calculated for these markets by U.S. investment firms, which
tend to use the semiannual compound measure to compare yields
across markets.)</p>
