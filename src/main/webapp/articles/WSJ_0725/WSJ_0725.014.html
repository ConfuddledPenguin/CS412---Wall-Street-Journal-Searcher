	<p class="article-leader">PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Pinnacle West Capital Corp. said it will
sell its uranium mining subsidiary, Malapai Resources Co.,
for $38 million to an affiliate of Electricite de France.
   The utility holding company agreed to sell the unit to the
French electric utility in April, but a price wasn't
disclosed. Pinnacle West said completion of the sale is
subject to certain closing conditions, including approval by
agencies that regulate mining activities in Texas and
Wyoming.</p>
