	<p class="article-leader">PepsiCo Inc., paced by big earnings gains in its fledgling
overseas markets, said second-quarter net income rose 10%.
   Stripping away several one-time credits and charges,
Pepsi's earnings would have increased 19%, as the company
outperformed the sluggish fast-food industry in the U.S. and
peddled more chips, chicken and soft drinks to consumers
abroad.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In line with analysts' estimates, Pepsi's second-quarter
net income was $292.5 million, or $1.10 a share, compared
with $264.9 million, or $1 a share.</p>
<p>The latest quarter's net included a two-cent-a-share write
off of soda and snack receivables, resulting from the recent
bankruptcy-law filing of a major customer, Circle K Corp. The
quarter also included three cents a share in earnings
dilution from Pepsi's acquisition last year of two British
snack companies. The year-ago quarter's net included several
gains and charges, the net effect of which was a credit of
six cents a share.</p>
<p>Sales for Pepsi, of Purchase, N.Y., totaled $4.2 billion,
up 17% from $3.59 billion.</p>
<p>In snack foods, Pepsi's biggest profit maker,
second-quarter international sales more than doubled to
$347.7 million while profits jumped 75%. The latest results
include the operations of the big British snack companies.
But even without them, the overseas snack-food business sold
14% more chips, as measured in tons. In the U.S., by
contrast, where the snack-food market is more mature and
competitive, Pepsi's Frito-Lay unit showed a 5% increase in
volume. That gain translated, after higher promotional costs
for new products and some charges, into a 7% profit growth in
the U.S.</p>
<p>In soft drinks, unlike main rival Coca-Cola Co., most of
Pepsi's profits come from the U.S. And with a 4% increase in
second-quarter sales by the company's domestic bottlers,
compared with about a 3% gain for Coke, Pepsi uncorked a 12%
rise in domestic operating profit, excluding a one-time
charge. Diet Pepsi and Mountain Dew led the volume increase
in the U.S.</p>
<p>The nation's largest restaurant operator continued to
shake off the fast-food doldrums in the second quarter.
Same-store sales for company-owned operations, an important
indicator of restaurant health that compares sales for units
open at least a year, rose 10% at Pizza Hut, 15% at Taco Bell
and 5% at Kentucky Fried Chicken. Putting those gains in
perspective, industry-leader McDonald's Corp.'s company-owned
stores, hurt by industrywide price discounting, last week
reported about a 1% decline in second-quarter same-store
sales.</p>
<p>A combination of new products, like Hot Wings at Kentucky
Fried Chicken, low-priced items like tacos and burritos at
Taco Bell, and expanded delivery service at Pizza Hut, all
helped Pepsi generate improved operating results from its
restaurants.</p>
<p>For the first half, Pepsi's net income increased 10% to
$474.4 million, or $1.78 a share, from $430 million, or $1.62
a share. The latest period's net includes the charge for the
Circle K receivables; the year-ago period profit includes the
six-cents-a-share net credit.</p>
<p>First-half sales rose 20% to $7.88 billion from $6.55
billion.</p>
