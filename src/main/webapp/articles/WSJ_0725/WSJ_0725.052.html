	<p class="article-leader">The ideas of "1992" and the "single market" have caught
the European imagination and forced the rest of the world to
pay attention as the world's largest economic superpower
takes shape.
   Four freedoms are central goals of the 1992 agenda: free
movement of people, goods, services and capital. These are
the freedoms that constitute a market. Some fear a single
currency will serve as a mechanism that cedes the sovereignty
of independent nations to unaccountable Brussels bureaucrats.
But it also can be argued that the four freedoms will return
powers to individuals -- powers that they surrendered,
perhaps inadvertently, to national governments. (In any case,
the events changing Eastern Europe are tipping the scales
decisively in favor of the market and against the
bureaucrats.)</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the power to print money is ceded to a European central
bank, while the power to spend remains largely with the
governments of member-states, a natural system of checks and
balances will start to function. National governments will no
longer be able to print money to finance unwise expenditures
that create inflation. As long as this separation holds --
and the European Central Bank sticks to a wise monetary
policy -- Europe has a chance for great economic growth.</p>
<p>The financial part of 1992 amounts to no more than
governments trusting people with their own money. Controls
will no longer prevent citizens from investing inor borrowing
from -- any part of the European Community, or anywhere else
in the world. Citizens will vote with their money. They will
do so more easily and continually than they will vote with
their feet, although the single market also makes the latter
an easier prospect.</p>
<p>Market forces will soon drive Europe to monetary union.
The more expectations of exchange-rate changes diminish, the
greater the incentive for borrowers (householders,
corporations and governments) to borrow in low-interest-rate
currencies and savers (individually or through financial
intermediaries) to seek lending opportunities in
high-interest-rate currencies.</p>
<p>Exchange rates will lock, creating an effective monetary
union; interest rates will converge, until only credit
differentials remain. Indeed, this is already happening --
the spread between the interest rates for the French franc
and the Deutsche mark is now the narrowest in decades.</p>
<p>This future raises a large question: Who has the authority
to spend? Money creation, taxation and borrowing are all
parts of that question, and the proposals for monetary union
affect all three of them.</p>
<p>With monetary union, the power to create money would no
longer reside with individual central banks, but with a
European central bank, or Euro-Fed. It would have one
priority task: the maintenance of price stability. Europe's
economics and finance ministers appear to already have agreed
that this bank must not engage in monetary financing of
member-states' deficits. In my view, that characteristic
should be particularly attractive to British voters, who
might prefer the 2%-3% inflation rates that a Euro-Fed would
target to their current 9% rate.</p>
<p>As borrowers, national governments will no longer
represent the perfect credit risk. The power to avoid formal
default by printing more currency will have been removed from
national central banks, and the latest plans for monetary
union have made it absolutely clear that there will be no
Community bailout of the profligate borrower. Individual
member-states will be forced to balance their own budgets in
just the way individual people have to balance their own
household budgets. The member-states will have the choice
between spending only what their income -- their tax revenue
-- allows, or facing eventual default. The ability to borrow
will depend on a state's creditworthiness.</p>
<p>In other words, the market will control supplies of new
credit, cutting them off when it is time. That is the moment
when the voter -- or the intermediary financial institution
-- is no longer prepared to risk further hard-earned savings.</p>
<p>One way of maintaining creditworthiness is with taxation.
However, if a country's tax regime is seen as oppressive,
then its citizens will have the freedom to vote with their
feet and move their businesses and residences to a lower-tax
country. Thus, the single market will put an effective cap on
oppressive taxation.</p>
<p>The success of such a European Community zone of stable
prices -- a "hard money" union -- depends on something else:
that member-states are not irresponsible with public debt.
This approach leads to the need for a set of rules for both
the issuer and the investor, especially the financial
institutions that are the intermediary for the bulk of
savings. Neither group can be ignored, because they are
simply the two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>For the issuer of public debt, the guiding principle must
be that the public finances of member states should be
sufficiently sound that they cannot destabilize the Common
Markets's financial system. If this principle is not
respected, a profligate country may threaten default, and
perhaps cause a domino-style destruction of the EC's
financial system -- unless it is bailed out by the taxpayers
of the rest of the Community.</p>
<p>A hypothetical example: If Italy alone decided to reduce
its debt burden, through default, from about 100% of GNP to
the rough average of the other major countries, then the cost
of a bailout would be about $1,500 for every person in the
Common Market. The growing storm in the U.S. over the cost of
the savings and loan bailout provides a model for the kinds
of political passions such a European bailout would arouse.
Therefore, there must be a provision in the treaty that
creates a EuroFed preventing the bailout of member states.</p>
<p>Other provisions are necessary: The market must have full
and timely information on member-states' overall financial
positions; the results of surveillance by the peer group of
finance ministers must be published; there must be no "market
privileges" for public authorities that compel savers to hold
their debt; the new European central bank should be
prohibited from holding public debt and offsetting these
vital credit differentials; and public debt portfolios should
have a minimum average life to prevent a sudden liquidity
crisis that would prevent orderly fiscal adjustment.</p>
<p>Financial institutions that are the buyers of public debt
must be subject to sufficient regulation as well --
regulation to ensure that they can withstand the default of a
public issuer. Otherwise, the no-bailout provision in the
treaty will be a paper tiger. Normal principles of asset
diversification should be applied to ensure a smooth
adjustment.</p>
<p>This should ensure that a country with burgeoning debts is
subject to discipline and is progressively frozen out of the
credit markets.</p>
<p>The financial institutions of Europe will be looking for
good quality public bonds to diversify their asset
portfolios. This process could yield a surprising result for
some local regions within individual countries. If they move
toward economic independence, fiscally sound regions could
find their flexibility rising, not falling, as many fear.
Growing regions that have long born the burden of their less
successful neighbors will now be able to raise and spend
money independently. With 1992, the 19th-century-style nation
may lose sovereignty, but regions can return to the kind of
power they enjoyed in earlier centuries.</p>
