	<p class="article-leader">FORT WORTH, Texas -- American Airlines backed down from
its plan to impose special surcharges on passengers flying
out of five U.S. airports.
   The AMR Corp. unit had announced earlier this month that
it would collect the special fees because of what it claimed
were higher costs -- such as landing and gate fees --
associated with those airports. The surcharges were to become
effective Aug. 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The airports and the surcharges were: New Jersey's Newark,
$4; New Orleans International, $1.50; New York's La Guardia
and Florida's West Palm Beach and Fort Myers, $1. American
would have realized revenue of about $4 million as a result.</p>
<p>American said it was unable to implement the surcharges
because of unspecified "competition." No other airline
matched American's fees.</p>
