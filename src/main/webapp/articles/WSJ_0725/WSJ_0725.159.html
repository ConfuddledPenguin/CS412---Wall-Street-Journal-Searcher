	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Keystone Camera Corp. lost its bid for
higher tariffs and import quotas on fixed-focus cameras using
35-millimeter and 110-type film.
   The U.S. International Trade Commission ruled 4-0 that
such imports, which totaled about $689 million last year,
aren't injuring a domestic industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Keystone's petition had been opposed by Eastman Kodak Co.,
Rochester, N.Y., and other camera manufacturers and
importers.</p>
<p>ITC Chairman Anne Brunsdale said that Keystone Camera, a
subsidiary of Keystone Camera Products Corp., Clifton, N.J.,
had failed to show that imports supplied by Eastman Kodak and
foreign-owned companies have been a "substantial cause" of
injury to Keystone.</p>
<p>David Rohr, another ITC member, said the economic
difficulties cited by Keystone in its petition resulted more
from a "failure" of that company's marketing strategy than
from import competition.</p>
<p>Keystone had told the ITC that it had tried to meet stiff
import competition in the marketing of its fixed-focus
cameras, but would be forced to shift production to foreign
plants if the government turned down its bid for import
restrictions.</p>
<p>The imports come primarily from Japan and other Asian
countries but have been coming in growing volume from Brazil
and cross-border assembly plants in Mexico.</p>
<p>Although Eastman Kodak was identified during the ITC
inquiry as an importer, Chairman Brunsdale noted that the
company is a major domestic camera manufacturer even though
it assembles fixed-focus cameras in foreign plants for
eventual sale in the U.S.</p>
<p>The ITC will send a report on its investigation to the
White House later, but yesterday's unanimous decision against
import restrictions means President Bush won't be required to
take any follow-up action under U.S. trade laws.</p>
