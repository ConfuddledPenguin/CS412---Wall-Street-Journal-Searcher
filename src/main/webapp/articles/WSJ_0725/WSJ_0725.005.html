	<p class="article-leader">The artist Vincent Van Gogh, a suicide 100 years ago, was
never mad but suffered instead from an inner-ear disorder,
some doctors now believe.
   A retrospective diagnosis of Meniere's disease,
characterized by severe, repeated attacks of vertigo and
ringing of the ears, is offered by researchers at Colorado
Neurologic Institute and Swedish Medical Center in today's
Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For a century, Van Gogh has been portrayed as a mad
artist, who sliced off his own ear in a psychotic episode and
who had epilepsy. But there's no evidence for that
assessment, says I. Kaufman Arenberg, the lead author of a
report on the artist. Rather, some 800 letters the artist
wrote to his family and friends between 1884 and his death
reveal a man "constantly in control of his reason," but in
frequent despair as he fought disabling bouts of vertigo, the
authors say.</p>
<p>A correct diagnosis probably wouldn't have helped much at
the time. Treatments weren't available for either epilepsy or
Meniere's disease, Dr. Arenberg says. He didn't speculate
about the effect of the disease on Van Gogh's paintings, but
thinks it spurred his prolific output. Fear that an attack
"would permanently prevent him from painting," Dr. Arenberg
says, "was driving him to paint more."</p>
<p>Today, about 80% of Meniere's disease sufferers can manage
their symptoms by, among other practices, maintaining a
low-salt diet and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, tobacco and
stress, Dr. Arenberg says. Surgery is usually required for
the other 20%. Dr. Arenberg has designed a shunt to help
divert inner ear fluid that contributes to a buildup of
pressure in the inner ear. The buildup provokes some
symptoms.</p>
