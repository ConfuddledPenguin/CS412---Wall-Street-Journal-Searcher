	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush's choice of Judge David
Souter, whose views on abortion and other contemporary legal
controversies are largely unknown, rekindles a decades-old
debate over what questions are appropriate for senators to
ask Supreme Court nominees.
   In political terms, the debate is simply put: Will the
senators ask Judge Souter directly for his views on the
constitutional right to abortion, or will the questions
circle around the issue? In legal terms, the question is:
Should they ask him at all?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When Judge Souter's hearing is held, probably in
September, Democratic and Republican senators are likely to
be under pressure from groups on both sides of the abortion
debate to pose questions, directly or indirectly, that shed
some light on the 50-year-old nominee's views on abortion.</p>
<p>"It would be naive to think," Sen. Patrick Leahy (D.,
Vt.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, observed, that Roe
vs. Wade, the 1973 decision recognizing the right to
abortion, "in one way or another isn't going to be part of a
number of questions . . . with the drive coming from both the
right and the left."</p>
<p>The problem is how to raise the issue. It is a problem
that has confounded the Senate Judiciary Committee for some
50 years, since Felix Frankfurter became the first high-court
nominee to appear and answer questions. Supreme Court
nominees generally must decline to answer questions about how
they would rule in specific cases, and when they have served
as judges they are reluctant to talk about their past
decisions.</p>
<p>This conundrum so frustrated the late Sen. Sam Ervin (D.,
N.C.) in a 1968 hearing that he complained that nominees
"cannot tell us anything about the future, and they cannot
tell us anything about the past, which means they cannot tell
us anything."</p>
<p>In Judge Souter's case, some abortion-rights groups want a
direct answer. Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist
Majority, urged senators "to demand to know his position on
abortion rights."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is a good chance he will never be
asked the ultimate question -- whether he would vote to
overrule Roe vs. Wade.</p>
<p>If the question is asked directly, Philip Kurland, a
University of Chicago law professor, says Judge Souter
shouldn't answer it. "It's appropriate for him to testify
about everything, except what they really want to ask him,"
Prof. Kurland says, arguing that a nominee shouldn't discuss
cases, past or future, or judicial philosophy.</p>
<p>Even some conservative Republicans, who in the past have
been quite blunt in asking nominees about abortion, may
refrain this time, taking President Bush at his word that
Judge Souter believes in judicial restraint. Sen. Charles
Grassley (R., Iowa), a Judiciary Committee member, says he
has made little progress in past nominations asking about
abortion and this time "may ask about something that's more
productive."</p>
<p>Prof. Kurland argues that the Judiciary Committee should
conduct its own, thorough investigation and call witnesses
who know the nominee, but should limit the inquiry to the
nominee's "character."</p>
<p>Walter Dellinger, a Duke University law professor, favors
a hearing much broader in scope. "Just as the president took
political and judicial philosophy into account, the Senate
does too and has a right to consider every aspect of a
nominee," Prof. Dellinger says. But he, too, says it isn't
appropriate for senators to ask directly about Roe vs. Wade.</p>
<p>Inability to ask about abortion directly doesn't end the
matter. There are broader questions senators could pose about
whether Judge Souter recognizes a constitutional right to
privacy generally, or for reproductive decisions
specifically. An even broader approach, Prof. Dellinger says,
is to ask the nominee whether he views the "liberty" and "due
process" guarantees of the 14th Amendment as encompassing an
array of individual rights.</p>
<p>Some Republican senators find themselves in an unfamiliar
posture, having grown accustomed to defending, instead of
questioning, President Reagan's Supreme Court nominees.
Because they, too, know relatively little about Judge Souter,
their approach may be "a combination of both" asking and
defending, says Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), a committee
member.</p>
<p>But, Sen. Hatch adds, "You can count on some tough
questioning" by the Democrats.</p>
