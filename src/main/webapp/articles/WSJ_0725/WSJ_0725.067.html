	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge in Arizona heard arguments on how to
allocate money paid in the settlement of litigation stemming
from Washington Public Power Supply System's $2.25 billion
bond default in 1983.
   Plaintiffs who bought WPPSS bonds before June 1983 and
Chemical Bank, trustee for the estimated 24,000 bondholders,
reached approximately $700 million in settlements with the
defendants last year. The defendants include WPPSS, several
utilities in six states in the Northwest, the Bonneville
Power Administration, the state of Washington and various
professional firms.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, U.S. District Judge William Browning of Tucson
heard arguments in New York on how the money should be
divided between the various bondholder factions, some of whom
oppose the settlements. Plaintiffs' lawyer Melvyn I. Weiss
said that by June 1991, when the money is tentatively
scheduled to be distributed, the total pot available will be
$825 million or more, including interest and money from other
pending claims.</p>
<p>Under an allocation plan proposed by Chemical Bank and
plaintiffs' lawyers earlier this year, $93.5 million will be
put into a fund to be distributed by Chemical Bank to all
bondholders. The remainder will be used for attorney's fees
and reimbursement of litigation expenses and then distributed
to plaintiffs who bought bonds before June 1983.</p>
<p>At the hearing, the main opponents of the allocation plan
were bondholders who bought the WPPSS bonds after June 1983,
when the Washington State Supreme Court ruled that many of
the municipal utilities that were backing the WPPSS bonds
didn't have the legal authority to execute their contracts
with WPPSS and thus didn't have to pay the debt. They argued
that the money allocated to the fund for all bondholders is
too small.</p>
<p>Mr. Weiss, of the New York law firm of Milberg, Weiss,
Bershad, Specthrie & Lerach, said that those who purchased
bonds after the court's June ruling were speculators who knew
the risks involved in that decision. "They took a risk and
made an investment that didn't pan out. But it's not a total
loss for them," he said.</p>
<p>But Robert M. Sedgwick, a lawyer for bondholders who
bought bonds after June 1983, said his clients were unhappy
with the representation they received from Chemical Bank and
feel that all bondholders should be treated the same under
the allocation plan.</p>
<p>"They ran risks, but the risk they didn't expect is that
the bank would settle this without their consent and agree to
a small settlement for their claims," said Mr. Sedgwick of
the New York firm of Holtzmann, Wise & Shepard.</p>
<p>But Harold Tyler of the New York law firm of Patterson,
Belknap, Webb & Tyler, a lawyer for Chemical Bank, countered:
"I don't consider $93 million a bad deal. The fact is we got
them money. Better a penny or two than nothing."</p>
<p>Buyers of the WPPSS bonds also have filed a $7.5 billion
state-court lawsuit against the state of Washington
contending that it's liable in the default because its
auditor was negligent in approving the bond sale. Washington
contributed $10 million to the settlements in order to
resolve the state-court litigation. The plaintiffs in the
state-court case and Mr. Sedgwick's clients have filed
separate appeals of Judge Browning's approval of the
settlements.</p>
<p>The judge said he will decide shortly whether to approve
the allocation plan. He hasn't yet ruled on awarding legal
fees.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' lawyers have requested fees of $110 million
and reimbursement to Chemical Bank of about $52 million spent
on the litigation.</p>

<p>THE RICO CASE against the Teamsters has cost the union $12
million.</p>
<p>The government's suit and its court-ordered supervision of
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters has cost the union
as much as $8.9 million in legal fees alone, according to the
July issue of International Teamster, a union publication.</p>
<p>Among the expenses are about $6 million billed by the New
York law firm of Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander & Ferdon,
which represents the union; $2.9 million for "other legal
fees and expenses"; $1.7 million for the salaries and
supplies of three court-appointed officers and their staffs.</p>
<p>The oversight began in March 1989 as part of the union's
settlement of civil racketeering charges brought by the
Justice Department to purge the union of alleged mob
domination.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the settlement, the Teamsters agreed to
broad reforms, including the first democratic election of top
officials and the court appointment of an administrator, an
investigator and an elections official to oversee the union.
The union also agreed to pay the salaries and expenses of the
three court-appointed officers and their staffs.</p>
<p>Teamsters in-house attorney James T. Grady said $2.9
million had been spent on legal expenses for defendants in
the suit. He added that U.S. District Judge David Edelstein
had ordered the union to publish in the International
Teamster all reports of the court-appointed officer and all
of the judge's opinions in the case. The extra pages for the
magazine cost about $1.5 million.</p>
<p>In the recent article -- which bears the headline "Civil
Rico Costs Top $12 Million]" -- the leadership appears to be
critical of the costs of the court-appointed officers. But,
says Edward T. Ferguson, the assistant U.S. Attorney in
Manhattan in charge of the case, "The expenses of the
court-appointed officers comprise only a very small part of
the total expenses the IBT claims."</p>
<p>Lawyers and union members skeptical of the union's leaders
say their criticism of the court-appointed officers' costs is
largely meant to distract the membership from the high legal
fees.</p>
<p>"They've spent $9 million on attorneys' fees in legal
efforts to either stop the election or cripple the powers of
the election officer," said Ken Paff, a national organizer
for the Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a reform group
within the union.</p>
<p>Mudge Rose attorney Jed Rakoff said the Teamsters union
"has felt that the government and the court officers had
departed from the spirit and language of the settlement."</p>

<p>TIME WARNER INC. WINS BATTLE in its crusade to stop Batman
knockoffs.</p>
<p>A federal judge in New York ordered Bobtron International
Inc., a Los Angeles-based importer of watches, to pay Time
Warner $40,000 in damages for infringing the company's rights
to the Batman character. Time Warner's DC Comics Inc. unit
has owned the copyright to Batman for more than half a
century.</p>
<p>Judge Michael B. Mukasey also permanently barred Bobtron
from selling watches that bear the Batman logo, character or
costume. According to the ruling, Bobtron sold 1,400 Batman
watches.</p>
<p>Saul A. Mifhaan, attorney for Bobtron, said the company
didn't know whether it would appeal.</p>
<p>Time Warner's 1989 hit movie "Batman" proved to be a boon
for knockoff artists who have sold T-shirts, sneakers,
watches and other items that carry the caped crusader's bat
logo, his costume and other Batman characters.</p>
<p>Time Warner's attorney, Joseph Bainton of the New York law
firm of Shea & Gould, estimates that his client has lost at
least $10 million from sales of unauthorized Batman
merchandise. He says he has reached settlements in about 75
of the 250 copyright infringement cases his firm has brought
on Time Warner's behalf.</p>
<p>The Bobtron case is the first that Time Warner has taken
to trial. Mr. Bainton says he expects that within nine months
all of the remaining cases will be resolved.</p>

<p>OBSCENITY INDICTMENTS THWARTED by federal court in
Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>U.S. Judge Joyce Hens Green yesterday barred the
Department of Justice's National Obscenity Enforcement Unit
from seeking multiple indictments against a major North
Carolina distributor of sexually oriented magazines and
videotapes.</p>
<p>The distributor, Philip D. Harvey, president and principal
owner of a concern called Adam and Eve, markets magazines and
videotapes that show adults engaging in sexual acts. None of
these involve rape or sexual violence, according to Judge
Green's memorandum opinion.</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey sued the Justice Department in March. According
to his lawyer, Bruce Ennis, the Justice Department had been
threatening for four years to prosecute Mr. Harvey in several
jurisdictions for distributing obscene material. According to
Mr. Ennis, the agency informed his client in December that
indictments were imminent in Utah and Kentucky.</p>
<p>"My client is perfectly happy to stand trial to one case,"
Mr. Ennis said. "What he can't stand is a nationwide war of
attrition." Mr. Harvey couldn't be reached for comment on the
ruling.</p>
<p>Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett said multiple
indictments are "an effective means for law enforcement" that
the department intends to defend before Judge Green when the
matter receives a full hearing in September.</p>
