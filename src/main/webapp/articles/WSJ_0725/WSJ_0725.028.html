	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- He may have dodged the problem for now, but
he can't escape it: President Bush rules over a Republican
Party with a hopelessly split personality on the most
contentious social issues.
   This Republican schism, which party leaders struggle
mightily to keep below the surface, was brought into sharp
focus by the resignation of Supreme Court Justice William
Brennan. GOP social-issue conservatives immediately
envisioned a replacement who would tip the court's balance
against abortion; other Republicans just as quickly geared up
a campaign for a nominee favoring abortion rights.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The president's artful selection of New Hampshire Judge
David Souter, a judicial conservative with virtually no
record on the abortion issue, may have skirted the problem
for now. But that hardly ends the problem. In fact, the
Souter choice only points out that the split personality is
likely to become a dilemma for Mr. Bush time and again, if he
has to fill more high-court vacancies -- and certainly as
Republicans try to write a platform for his likely
re-election campaign in 1992.</p>
<p>"If the party goes out on a social-issues jag," warns GOP
consultant Roger Stone, "we'll split our coalition."</p>
<p>In a sense, this rift is an outgrowth of Republican
success. In the past two decades, the party has drawn in
Americans with disparate backgrounds who unite behind the GOP
on economic and national-security matters. On one side of
this Republican tent are social-issue conservatives, to whom
such matters as abortion, flag burning and gun control are of
searing importance. On the other side are what party pros
often call the "yuppie" Republicans -- suburban voters who
are conservative on economics but either disagree with the
social conservatives or blanch at emphasizing such emotional
issues.</p>
<p>In a sense, the president is like the hero in a Western
movie who is tied to two wild horses that the bad guys send
charging off in different directions to tear him apart. The
recurring challenge for Mr. Bush is to keep his horses
heading in the same direction. The risk is that if tax
increases begin to blur the differences between Democrats and
Republicans on economic matters, some voters could drift
toward the Democratic camp over social issues.</p>
<p>Such splits emerge because the national Republican
coalition, building for years, now is "at a pretty late
stage" in which internal contradictions emerge more clearly,
says Republican theorist Kevin Phillips. "Managing it would
be pretty tough if you had the best of all worlds."</p>
<p>The divisions are borne out by a recent Wall Street
Journal/NBC News poll. Respondents were asked a series of
questions about abortion, flag burning, gun control,
obscenity and the death penalty, and were classified based on
their answers. The poll found that among Republicans, 28%
could be classified as social liberals, 38% as social
moderates and 34% as social conservatives.</p>
<p>Republican operatives recognize the splits but argue that
they are inevitable in successful national movements. They
are "the growing pains of becoming a majority party,"
maintains Mary Matalin, the chief of staff at the Republican
National Committee.</p>
<p>And Mitchell Daniels, former political director of the
Reagan White House, contends that "any coalition broad enough
to command recurring majorities is going to have to be broad
enough to have contradictions within it." He adds: "But I
think the cleavages within the Republican party are far less
than the Democrats managed to have and survive for so many
decades. The distance between these various shades of
Republicans isn't the same as the distance between Dixiecrats
and civil-rights workers."</p>
<p>Still, the matter is complicated by an internal debate
about which camp is more important to Republican national
success. Many Republican operatives -- including some of
President Bush's advisers -- argue that the "yuppie" element
is more important in the long run, because it tends to
represent a breed of new, younger, upwardly mobile
Republicans who could provide long-term support.</p>
<p>But others argue that such voters don't form the same kind
of dependable core of support that social conservatives do.
"Even though I know the yuppie segment has been part of the
coalition, it hasn't been the base and the strength of the
coalition -- not in terms of hitting the street," argues
Robert Billings, legislative director of the American
Conservative Union.</p>
<p>The solution to the split, many analysts say, is to try to
keep the focus on issues that unite Republicans, such as
economic growth, the fight against crime and drugs, and
national defense. Notwithstanding the current flap over the
president's recent reversal of his no-tax pledge, economic
issues, in particular, represent the glue holding the
Republican coalition together, many party operatives argue.</p>
<p>Another way to handle the splits, some suggest, is to
emphasize a philosophy of individual rights -- a philosophy
that theoretically should appeal to social-issue
conservatives because of their disdain for big government and
also to abortion-rights advocates because of their disdain
for intermingling politics and social issues. "The basic
philosophy of the party is one of individual choice," says
Ann Stone, who has just formed a group called Republicans for
Choice, a group of Republicans favoring abortion rights.</p>
<p>The White House clearly hopes that Judge Souter and his
vague record on abortion won't antagonize anyone. "The
advantage is that neither wing of the Republican Party has
any idea how he'll come down on any of the issues the
different wings care about," says Republican Gov. Judd Gregg
of New Hampshire. Yet abortion is such a highly emotional
matter that it is difficult to finesse. And the issue
promises to rear its head time and again, particularly
because Mr. Bush could easily make several more appointments
to a Supreme Court whose two most-liberal members now are in
their 80s.</p>
<p>The recent focus on abortion already has produced an
increasing outspokenness by Republicans favoring abortion
rights. "There are many Republicans who are pro-choice,"
maintains Rep. Claudine Schneider, a Rhode Island Republican
who is running for the U.S. Senate and who favors abortion
rights. "A lot of them feel disenfranchised. But we are there
-- and we are speaking out. The party is not of one point of
view here." Indeed, the Journal/NBC poll indicates that 59%
of Republicans don't favor making abortion illegal.</p>
<p>And Ms. Stone warns that the Republican Party must work
out some compromise before it writes its party platform in
1992 or be forced to jettison its official anti-abortion
views entirely. "We will either work it out in language both
sides can live with or we will have it dropped," she says.
"How can the party continue to take this position? It really
tears at the core of the party, at the very fabric of the
party."</p>
