	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Merrill Lynch International Ltd. has stopped
making a market in U.S. dollar-denominated Japanese
equity-warrant issues, a spokesman for the firm said.
   "We were unable to make a sufficient return on our capital
as the market is suffering from excess capacity and increased
competition," said the spokesman for the Merrill Lynch & Co.
unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>About 30 staff members have been laid off, including
traders, salespeople and administrative employees. Merrill
has a staff of about 2,100 across Europe, with more than
1,400 based in London.</p>
<p>The firm entered the business in November 1988, and was a
market maker in 250 to 300 issues, representing roughly
three-quarters of all liquid issues oustanding.</p>
<p>Merrill will continue to make a market in Swiss-franc
denominated equity-warrant bond issues by Japanese companies.
It is a market maker in about 150 Swiss franc issues, the
official said.</p>
<p>The official added that Merrill will continue to be
involved in customer agency business and will also continue
to trade in U.S. dollar equity-warrant deals in connection
with its arbitrage and derivative activity.</p>
<p>The cuts are part of Merrill's current business
rationalization process. According to the spokesman, the firm
now intends to concentrate on the equity derivatives
business.</p>
