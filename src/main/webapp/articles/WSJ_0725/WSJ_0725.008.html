	<p class="article-leader">New York -- "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" was designed to
survey the entire career of the most successful
choreographer-director of musicals in our time. The anthology
of Mr. Robbins's works recently presented by New York City
Ballet, though originally announced as a "retrospective," was
different in scope. Nearly every one of the ballets seen in
the concentrated, two-week survey already was in the
repertoire of NYCB. Besides, only four of them, "The Cage"
(1951), "Fanfare" (1953), "Afternoon of a Faun" (1953) and
"The Concert" (1956), date from the choreographer's early
days with the company.
   NYCB's spring season would have been an appropriate
occasion to honor Mr. Robbins with a truly comprehensive
review of his achievements as a classical choreographer. In
November, he announced his resignation from the company after
30 years of service, seven of them as co-ballet
master-in-chief with Peter Martins. It was Mr. Martins,
henceforth the sole director of NYCB and thus the guardian of
the company's Robbins repertoire, who conceived the idea of
saluting his colleague with a retrospective. Apparently,
however, there was not enough time for the choreographer --
notoriously a stickler for detail -- to revive the
long-unseen works of his first years with NYCB: "The Guests,"
"The Age of Anxiety," "The Pied Piper," "Quartet," "Ballade,"
nor even such later efforts as "Dybbuk Variations."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It's hard to believe, though, that these pieces have
disappeared forever. Mr. Robbins always has shown himself
reluctant to discard anything he ever created. Exemplary in
this respect is the Irving Berlin number "Mr. Monotony."
Originally staged for "Miss Liberty" in 1949, it was cut
before the show's Broadway opening. Introduced into "Call Me
Madam" a year later, it again suffered the same fate.
Undeterred by the fact that the song is not one of Berlin's
masterpieces, and, indeed, makes little theatrical impact,
the choreographer had the last laugh by including it in
"Jerome Robbins' Broadway."</p>
<p>The same need for vindication seems to have inspired the
revival of "Watermill." First presented by NYCB in 1972 with
conspicuous lack of success -- at its premiere, the audience,
restless throughout the long performance, exploded into
booing at the final curtain -- the piece soon disappeared
from the company's repertoire, seemingly forever. Forever in
this case turned out to mean less than two decades.
Resuscitated for the festival, "Watermill" even turned up
twice more in the penultimate week of the NYCB season. This
time there were no boos. But even with its original star,
Edward Villella, who at 54 gamely emerged from retirement to
tackle the leading role again, the work looked as jejune as
ever: endlessly protracted, numbingly portentous and all too
damagingly reminiscent of avant-garde theater artist Robert
Wilson.</p>
<p>A similar lack of self-awareness lies behind the
maintenance in NYCB's repertoire of "Fancy Free," Mr.
Robbins's first ballet, commissioned in 1944 for what was
then called simply Ballet Theatre. One can understand why he
would feel protective about the work that made him famous
overnight, and which, transformed into the Broadway musical
"On the Town," led directly to his show-biz career.
Nonetheless, the piece now shows only sporadic signs of life.</p>
<p>For one thing, the spectacle of sailors on shore leave has
none of the emotive power it did in the 1940s, when the
audience could hardly have watched their antics without a
subliminal awareness of their vulnerability as fighting men.
Without such an awareness, the spectacle of three gobs
forcing their attentions upon every girl who passes by simply
looks unpleasant, especially when they snatch one girl's
handbag and refuse to give it back. Without such an
awareness, moreover, the male bonding looks less innocent
than boorish.</p>
<p>In any case, "Fancy Free" was made for artists schooled in
a mode no longer extant. In 1944, Ballet Theatre, dominated
by the aesthetic and technical standards of emigre Russian
ballet, was stylistically at one with its rival, the Ballet
Russe de Monte Carlo. Not for nothing was Ballet Theatre
advertised by impresario Sol Hurok as "The Best in Russian
Ballet." Almost everything in the company's repertoire
demanded characterization and the exploitation of individual
personality. Since then, largely because of the inescapable
influence of Balanchine, American performers have been taught
to depersonalize their dancing. For all the talent shown by
the three sailors, Damian Woetzel, Tom Gold and Robert
LaFosse, they were, as characters, mere ciphers.</p>
<p>Mr. Robbins himself largely abandoned the Ballet Russe
mode early in his career, opting instead for a
neo-Balanchinian visualization of music, though always with a
discernible subtext of narrative or literary theme. In a
score of works, ranging from "Dances at a Gathering" and
"Goldberg Variations" to "Moves" and "In Memory of . . .," he
suppressed content in favor of form, though not fully enough
to render it imperceptible. As a consequence, his ballets on
the whole satisfy neither in terms of dance, which tends to
be both bland and derivative, nor of expression, which tends
to be indeterminate and evasive. Most of his works are
vitiated by a fatal sentimentality, a refusal either to
discard or to confront the subjects that have called them
into being in the first place.</p>
<p>None of this would matter were Mr. Robbins's choreography
more interesting, daring and, above all, individual. As the
succession of works passed before our eyes during the
festival, it became impossible to keep them straight. Some
were easier to identify than others: "Ives, Songs" is the one
that, like Antony Tudor's "The Leaves Are Fading," features
an intrusive observer; "Glass Pieces" has music by Philip
Glass, and the ritualized, hypnotically reiterated non-dance
movement pioneered by Lucinda Childs. "I'm Old-Fashioned" has
a film clip of Fred Astaire and Rita Hayworth.</p>
<p>No doubt Mr. Robbins's oeuvre would seem less vapid had he
not produced a masterpiece like "Afternoon of a Faun." In
this, he both acknowledges his subject matter -- the
paradoxical relationship between the impersonal art of dance
and the vulnerable human beings who perform it -- and
expresses it fully in movement. For once, there is no
suppression of meaning in favor of formal design. As danced
during the festival by Ib Andersen and the youthful Margaret
Tracey, it obliterated virtually everything else on view.</p>
