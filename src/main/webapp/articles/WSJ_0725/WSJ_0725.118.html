	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Energy shares lifted the stock market, but
beyond the world of oil there was blood.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 17.82 higher at
2922.52. New York Stock Exchange volume was a hefty
181,920,000 shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Exxon, Chevron, Texaco and USX were the stilts for the
industrial average, providing about 14 points of the overall
gain. Driving these and other energy-related stocks was the
price of oil; the September futures contract closed six cents
higher at $20.56 a barrel yesterday in reaction to signs of
renewed conflict in the Mideast.</p>
<p>Energy issues also supported broad averages: Standard &
Poor's 500-stock index gained 0.48 to 355.79.</p>
<p>Earnings disappointments and dimmer third-quarter
projections again triggered heavy institutional selling in
favored, high-priced growth stocks such as Capital
Cities/ABC, which tumbled 55 1/2 to 533, a 9% decline.</p>
<p>Capital Cities/ABC reported second-quarter net income of
$8.19 a share, about six cents shy of conservative estimates,
according to Dennis McAlpine, senior vice president at
Oppenheimer & Co. Additionally, the broadcast concern said
third-quarter profit may be down from the year-before period,
a message heard from many other companies these days.</p>
<p>"The sin of Capital Cities is the sin of anybody who says
something about down earnings," said Mr. McAlpine. "And you
don't have to say much these days."</p>
<p>Even stocks favored by bargain hunters took their hits:
Dow Chemical fell 5 3/4 to 52 3/8 on 3.4 million shares after
reporting earnings and tempering analysts' estimates for the
second half of the year. Ingersoll-Rand tumbled 3 1/2 to 53
7/8; the company reported second-quarter earnings of $1.03 a
share, about six cents below expectations.</p>
<p>"The bottom line is that investors will not tolerate
earnings disappointments," said Joseph DeMarco, managing
director in charge of equity trading at Marinvest. "The glue
of the market has been energy stocks -- they are in the only
industry that is reporting good earnings."</p>
<p>Again, traders were astonished by the sell-offs because
few buyers seemed to step up after stocks were down as much
as 10%. Earnings disappointments lately haven't resulted in
mere corrections to fairer valuations, but in assassinations
of stocks where institutional buyers walk away and never come
back. Paul Hennessey, vice president of trading at Boston
Co., said he was contacting portfolio managers yesterday to
see whether they wanted to buy some stocks that had fallen
sharply.</p>
<p>They didn't. "They fear it will be dead money; the past
indicates that the performance isn't there for months" after
a stock is taken down, he said.</p>
<p>Despite the carnage, Stefan Abrams, chief investment
strategist at Kidder Peabody, said he thinks the growth-stock
rally is still in place. What will lead the market higher are
a group of consumer non-cyclical shares, such as Procter &
Gamble and Coca-Cola Co. Mr. Abrams said investors soon will
begin looking at the value of these stocks compared with 1991
earnings estimates and prices will move up.</p>
<p>He said these stocks will have sponsorship from mutual
funds that are experiencing a giant inflow of money from
investors now. "They will buy what's working," he said. "In
the consumer non-cyclical group, the rally is essentially
intact."</p>
<p>Exxon rallied 2 1/8 to 50 in Big Board composite trading
of more than two million shares. Dean Witter boosted the
stock's investment rating to "buy" from "accumulate"; among
other things, analyst Eugene L. Nowak cited prospects for a
dividend increase in the next six to 12 months and a better
performance in U.S. refining and marketing operations.</p>
<p>Texaco jumped 2 3/4 to 62 1/2. Although the company
reported that second-quarter earnings dropped 3.6% from a
year earlier, the latest results were better than analysts
had generally expected. Chevron went up 1 7/8 to 78 3/4; the
company reported that earnings climbed 60% in the second
quarter.</p>
<p>USX, the parent of Marathon Oil and another of the 30
issues in the industrial average, gained 7/8 to 34 3/8. Mobil
rose 2 to 67, Amoco added 1 1/2 to 54 7/8, Royal Dutch
Petroleum advanced 2 1/8 to 81 5/8, British Petroleum gained
2 3/8 to 74 5/8, Unocal tacked on 7/8 to 31 and Phillips
Petroleum rose 5/8 to 28 3/4.</p>
<p>Baker Hughes rose 7/8 to 29 7/8 on 1.7 million shares, and
other oil-services issues turned in even stronger showings.</p>
<p>Schlumberger gained 1 3/8 to 64 7/8, Halliburton jumped 2
3/8 to 53 5/8, McDermott International rallied 2 1/8 to 31
3/4 and Helmerich & Payne went up 1 to 32.</p>
<p>Mesa Limited Partnership rose 1/8 to 4 1/8 in trading that
included a block of 2,270,000 units, which represented 2.9%
of the partnership's units outstanding. The block accounted
for most of the 2.6 million units to change hands.</p>
<p>Student Loan Marketing Association fell 1 3/4 to 48 1/8 as
2.7 million shares changed hands, reflecting ongoing concern
about the financial difficulties facing Higher Education
Assistance Foundation, a major loan guarantor. Sallie Mae is
among the major creditors of the foundation, which broke off
merger discussions with another guarantor.</p>
<p>The technology sector, which has stumbled amid several
earnings disappointments in recent sessions, extended its
downturn. International Business Machines fell 1 1/8 to 114
3/4, Compaq Computer eased 5/8 to 57 3/8, Digital Equipment
lost 2 3/8 to 75 1/2 and Motorola dropped 2 to 77 5/8; among
smaller issues, Silicon Graphics was unchanged at 32 1/2,
Stratus Computer lost 1 to 22 7/8, Network Equipment
Technologies went down 3/4 to 8 1/8 and Digital
Communications Associates dropped 1 1/8 to 23 1/4.</p>
<p>TCBY Enterprises tumbled 1 3/4 to 13 1/2. The company
acknowledged telling analysts that sales for stores open at
least one year, which fell 10% for the three months ended in
May, remained weak in June, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report. Based on the same-store sales
trend, J.C. Bradford and Robinson-Humphrey both lowered
investment ratings on the stock and reduced earnings
estimates for fiscal 1990 and 1991.</p>
<p>Wellman advanced 2 1/4 to 24 3/8. Prudential-Bache
Securities upgraded its investment rating on the stock to
"buy" from "hold," based on its recent decline in price.</p>
<p>Milton Roy added 3 1/2 to 26 7/8 following news that
Sundstrand, which holds a 15% stake in the company, submitted
a $28-a-share takeover offer.</p>
<p>Bank of New England gained 5/8 to 2 7/8 after rejecting
offers for its Maine National Bank unit. The company said it
had been unable to reach agreement with potential buyers of
the subsidiary on an acceptable price.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.59
to 355.51. Volume totaled 14,430,000 shares.</p>
