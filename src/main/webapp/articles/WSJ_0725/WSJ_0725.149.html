	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The four major shareholders in British Satellite
Broadcasting Ltd. (BSB) refused troubled Australian
businessman Alan Bond any further extensions to sell his
stake in the television company, the shareholders said
yesterday.
   Granada Group PLC, Pearson PLC, Reed International PLC and
Chargeurs S.A., of France, said the latest extension ran out
July 19 for Mr. Bond's company, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The effect of the expiration is to lower Mr. Bond's stake
in the second satellite television network for the U.K. to
7.4% from an original 37%, said BSB.</p>
<p>The major shareholders had given Bond a number of
extensions on time limits in which to sell his stake without
it being diluted after a #450 million ($821.9 million) rights
issue in January. If the deadline had been met, the buyer
could have taken up a position in rights issues that would
have maintained the higher stake in BSB.</p>
<p>Now analysts suggest Mr. Bond's stake is worth about #30
million at market value, against his total original
investment of #155 million.</p>
<p>A number of potential buyers of the Bond stake had been
mentioned by analysts. Robert Maxwell, chairman and chief
executive of the media conglomerate Maxwell Communication
Corp., was considered the favorite, despite a potential
conflict in cross-media ownership.</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell wasn't immediately available for comment.</p>
