	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Again the stock market was a killing field for
companies delivering bad profit news, but buoyant oil stocks
pushed many stock-price barometers higher.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 17.82 to close at
2922.52 in active trading, regaining less than a third of
Monday's 56-point loss.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bond prices eased in light trading, with little economic
news to guide traders. For much the same reason, the dollar
ended mixed.</p>
<p>Investors pounded shares of companies with negative
earnings news, which were spread randomly across most
industry groups. Dow Chemical, Morgan Stanley and Capital
Cities/ABC all fell more than 5% because of profit
disappointments.</p>
<p>While investors continue to be unforgiving on poor
earnings, said Joseph DeMarco, head of equity trading at
Marinvest, "people are still looking for places to go to.
Today it was energy."</p>
<p>Oil stocks indeed fueled the market's afternoon advance,
said Christopher Pedersen, director of trading at
Twenty-First Securities. "Without the oils, the Dow did
nothing."Chevron, Exxon and Texaco -- all in the Dow average
-- rose sharply on renewed prospect of armed conflict in the
Mideast.</p>
<p>The most interesting aspect of yesterday's stock action
was the ease with which traders took Monday's volatility in
stride. "The professionals are getting used to knowing how to
handle these one-day blips," Mr. Pedersen said.</p>
<p>The bond market was affected by selling left over from
Monday, as traders unwound positions developed in response to
the stock market decline. Roberta D. Olson, fixed-income
portfolio manager at Banc One Asset Management Corp., said,
"Too many people were wounded. They are sitting back and
assessing the situation. It's completely related to the stock
market."</p>
<p>Bond investors had been focusing on inflation, what the
Federal Reserve was saying, and the prospect of more bonds
coming to market; then stocks suddenly took center stage. "It
has forced a lot of people to reassess what fundamental
issues we should be looking at now," Ms. Olson said. In major
market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose on volume of 182 million shares in New
York Stock Exchange trading, with declining issues edging
advancers, 755 to 753.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell 3/8 of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000
face amount. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond rose to 8.58%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6215 marks and 148.78 yen, compared
with 1.6220 marks and 148.20 yen Monday.</p>
