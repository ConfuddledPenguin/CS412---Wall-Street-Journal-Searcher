	<p class="article-leader">The adventures of the Great Circus Bim Bom From Russia
have been a high-wire lesson in capitalism. Having made
national TV when their U.S. tour went bust, the performers
are still holed up in Marietta, Ga., living off the good will
of local residents and entangled in the Byzantine
complexities of the U.S. legal system.
   The Bim Bom's adventure started out cheerfully enough. The
circus all-stars -- drawn from state circuses throughout the
Soviet Union -- arrived here in April for a two-year goodwill
tour of the U.S. But before anyone could say glasnost, the
circus's Kuwaiti and American backers skedaddled, leaving
behind $1.6 million in debts. Pressed by creditors, the
circus has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Lawyers are
arguing about whether this is kosher, given that the circus
maybe belongs to the Soviet government. Such litigiousness
isn't easy for a bear to bear; the Soviet government disavows
responsibility.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So the Bim Bom is hopelessly entangled in a net of suits
that would daunt a Houdini. Just when you think it's
impossible to squeeze another clown into a little car,
another lawyer latches on. Bim Bom manager Yuri Turkin
describes this situation as making "an elephant out of a
fly." His ursine dancers are fidgety, and its famous
wrestling bear now "wrestles with misfortune."</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Turkin looks on the bright side. While in
captivity, a lion has given birth to two cubs, and the
circus's 18 parrots, which used to speak only Russian, are
learning English. But one creditor, a Newburgh, N.Y.,
transport company, confiscated the circus's animals as
hostages. Another creditor took its equipment, which it
doesn't have to feed.</p>
<p>A breakaway group, including the Flying Stankeevs, a
family of aerialists, followed the star acrobat to Las Vegas,
in a so-far-futile search for a stage. Meanwhile, Marietta
churches and civic groups have come to the aid of the rest.
Though the performers concede that they could go home,
leaving the equipment and animals behind, it's not hard to
understand why they take their chances with Southern
hospitality and the American courts rather than face empty
grocery-store shelves back home.</p>
<p>So the cast includes Russian circus folk, American
lawyers, Kuwaiti promoters, Southern civic boosters, Northern
creditors, bears, lions, parrots and the Soviet government.
After looking into the matter, we've decided it would take a
year's research to figure out who's conning whom. As a famous
American once said, "There's a sucker born every minute."</p>
<p>Still, this looks to us like a good chance to finally make
perestroika work. Among the various talents assembled, there
should be some way to liberate the lions and bears and let
the Bim Bom go back to work.</p>
