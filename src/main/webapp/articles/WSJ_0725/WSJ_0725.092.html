	<p class="article-leader">In the scramble for global investment funds, the U.S. is
coming up short.
   Foreign investors sold a net $4.2 billion of U.S. stocks
and bonds in the first quarter -- the latest for which data
are available -- according to the Securities Industry
Association. It was first time foreigners pulled money out of
the U.S. securities markets since the third quarter of 1983.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, evidence since then points to a continued lack
of appetite on the part of foreigners for U.S. stocks and
bonds, analysts said. Traditionally, foreign investors have
had a bigger influence on U.S. bond markets than on stocks,
but the British and Japanese sometimes affect share prices.</p>
<p>The consequences can be significant for the deficit-ridden
U.S., which faces increasing competition for investment
funds. West Germany and Japan -- the big surplus nations --
have turned inward, and Eastern Europe, with enormous capital
needs to finance economic and industrial restructuring, is a
new competitor for global cash. Moreover, analysts say
Thailand and Malaysia, and eventually possibly even Mexico
and Brazil, are emerging as new lures for international
investment capital.</p>
<p>"We have become very dependent upon foreign investors in
all of our markets. Since we now have less demand for U.S.
securities than in past years, this explains why we have not
had better and more sustained bond market rallies following
positive economic news," said Brian J. Fabbri, chief
economist for Midland Montagu, a U.S. securities unit of
Midland Bank PLC.</p>
<p>U.S. bond yields, he added, "are too high considering
economic growth has slowed and the Fed has eased. Yet, bond
yields are much higher now than they were in December. That's
because we have had sparse demand for our securities."</p>
<p>What's more, David G. Strongin, director of international
finance at the SIA, said these high U.S. rates could damage
U.S. economic growth, raise the cost of funding the federal
budget deficit and reduce the competitiveness of U.S.
corporations.</p>
<p>Led by Japanese investors, who sold a net $3.9 billion of
U.S. Treasury securities, foreigners in aggregate unloaded
$900 million of all U.S. bonds (Treasurys, agency issues and
corporate bonds) in the first quarter after buying a net
$19.9 billion in the last quarter of 1989. Overseas investors
grew more negative on U.S. stocks, selling a net $3.3 billion
following a selloff of $400 million in the last quarter of
1989. Swiss, British and Japanese investors were the major
dumpers of U.S. stocks in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Behind this retreat are rising nominal and
inflation-adjusted interest rates abroad, falling U.S.
interest rates and lately a weakening dollar. At the same
time, there's rising interest in European and smaller Asian
economies and stock markets.</p>
<p>On a semiannual compound yield basis, 10-year U.S.
government bonds currently yield 8.53%. That compares with
11.46% for equivalent British bonds, 8.33% for West German
and 6.96% for Japanese bonds. At shorter maturities, foreign
fixed-income securities become even more appealing.</p>
<p>"Looking at these factors, an investor abroad has to ask
himself: Why invest in the U.S.? There are better
opportunities abroad," said Nicholas P. Sargen, an
international economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. "Since the
beginning of the year, I haven't spoken to a long-term
overseas investor who is interested in substantially
increasing his dollar bond holdings."</p>
<p>In many ways, the supply and demand for international
capital is the reverse of what it was in the 1980s. In the
last decade -- especially in the first half of it -- foreign
investors were drawn to high U.S. interest rates, an
expanding economy, a soaring dollar and a booming stock
market.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, the U.S. pulled in more than $800
billion from foreign investors, including direct investment,
on relatively favorable terms, said Mr. Sargen. "Japan and
Germany were generating huge surpluses, and the funds that
used to go to the less developed countries weren't because
they weren't creditworthy." That left the U.S. as the prime
recipient of foreign cash.</p>
<p>But it's a different world in the 1990s. Bond yields are
mostly higher in Europe and rising in Japan, and their
currencies are climbing. Several European stock markets have
suffered recent setbacks after earlier runups. Still, many
long-term investors are attracted to them because of the
planned 1992 abolition of trade and investment barriers in
the 12 countries of the European Community, and because of
the opening of Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Europe is experiencing its biggest spending boom in two
decades. Added to that are the financing needs for German
unification -- and more broadly for the reconstruction of
Eastern Europe. "At the margin, Europe is the buzzword," said
John Morosani, managing director in charge of U.S. equities
at S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York.</p>
<p>"You'd think that with the dollar soft, foreign investors
would want to buy U.S. equities. From a value perspective,
you'd think it would make our stuff look cheaper," he said.
But "the observed reality is that foreign investors tend to
be more interested in a U.S. market when the dollar is
rallying."</p>
<p>William M. Brachfeld, an executive vice president at the
U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co. in New York, said that "as
rates have come down here and Japanese rates have inched up,"
Japanese sales of U.S. bonds have continued. He added that
lately foreign investors' confidence in the Federal Reserve
had weakened because of the central bank's apparent policy
switch toward attempting to bolster U.S. growth with an
easier monetary stance rather than combating inflation.</p>
<p>In fact, the SIA's data show that the biggest buyers --
$2.9 billion -- of U.S. Treasury securities in the first
quarter were members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. Most of them don't take a currency risk
when buying U.S. securities, because their major income
earner, oil, is priced in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>Foreigners won't abandon U.S. securities markets. Analysts
say they can't afford to, because the U.S. still represents
the world's largest single capital market and is regarded as
a "safe haven" in times of international tension.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Sargen of Salomon Brothers said: "There's no
doubt the U.S. is going to be hustling for funds with
countries that we once didn't have to face as competitors in
world capital markets. And surplus countries like Japan and
Germany have more investment opportunities in their own
backyards."</p>
