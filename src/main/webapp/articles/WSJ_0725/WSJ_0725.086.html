	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Capital Cities/ABC Inc. posted a lackluster
1.5% rise in net income in the second quarter despite robust
results at the ABC network and warned that earnings in the
current quarter may fall below those of a year ago.
   The company's bleak forecast sent its common shares
tumbling by almost 9%. Capital Cities/ABC shares plunged
$55.50 to close at $533 in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Capital Cities/ABC blamed the lukewarm second-quarter
results and the possible decline in third-quarter net on
sluggish ad sales at its television and radio stations and on
losses on the new baseball contract at its 80%-owned cable
channel, ESPN.</p>
<p>Capital Cities/ABC posted second-quarter net of $142.3
million, or $8.19 a share, compared with $140.2 million, or
$7.83 a share, a year ago. Revenue rose 11% to $1.36 billion
from $1.23 billion.</p>
<p>In last year's third quarter, the company earned $80.8
million or $4.56 a share; a decline in the current period
would mark the first year-to-year earnings drop for the
company since the first quarter of 1986.</p>
<p>ESPN and the stations had been the company's two strongest
segments in recent years. Last year, ESPN earned well over
$100 million in pretax operating profit, and the eight
company-owned TV stations boast the highest profit margins in
the business. But in the second quarter, profits dropped
sharply at ESPN and other cable operations as the baseball
contract produced a $20 million loss. At the TV stations,
meanwhile, profits were up only modestly, and radio-station
profits fell below year-ago levels.</p>
<p>Those two areas now look troubled just as Capital
Cities/ABC seems to have managed a turnaround at the two
major trouble spots of the past year or so: the ABC network
and some parts of the magazine-publishing business.</p>
<p>ABC, now No. 2 and riding a turnaround in prime-time
ratings and well-ensconced in the No. 1 position in ratings
for the nightly news, posted a strong 15% rise in both sales
and earnings in the second quarter. The publishing business,
which makes up about 20% of total company revenue, had a 10%
rise in profits, the best performance for that segment in
more than a year. Those bright spots, however, weren't enough
to offset the other difficulties.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts had recently lowered their estimates
for the company, but the actual results came in below even
the revised expectations. David Londoner of Wertheim Schroder
& Co. had expected $8.75 a share in net instead of the $8.19
the company turned in for the second quarter. For the third
quarter, he had first projected $5.80 a share in earnings,
then had lowered it to $5.30 a share vs. the year-earlier
period's $4.56 a share. "Now it looks as though it will be
$4.10 or $4.20," he said.</p>
<p>Capital Cities/ABC executives are known for their cautious
outlook and for trying to avoid surprising Wall Street with
unexpected earnings problems. "They like to tell you the bad
news in advance, which I think everybody appreciates," said
Mr. Londoner. "Except on a day like this. They really took
things apart."</p>
