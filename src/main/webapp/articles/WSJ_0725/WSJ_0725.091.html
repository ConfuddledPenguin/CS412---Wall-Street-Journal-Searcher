	<p class="article-leader">Your June 25 article "Thompson Issues Order on Patronage
in Illinois" (which appeared in some editions) correctly
reported that I issued an executive order directing all
agencies under my control to follow the U.S. Supreme Court's
ruling in Rutan v. Republican Party in Illinois.
   However, the article goes on to say that the "spoils
system" may not be dead in Illinois and attempts to support
that allegation with my explanation that when job candidates
are equally qualified, "We'll hire the Republican."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The quote is correct, but it was made in reference to
hiring practices before the Rutan decision.</p>
<p>My executive order makes it clear to everyone in Illinois
government that the U.S. Supreme Court decision is the law of
the land and must be followed.</p>
<p>James R. Thompson</p>
<p>Governor</p>
<p>State of Illinois</p>
<p>Springfield, Ill.</p>
