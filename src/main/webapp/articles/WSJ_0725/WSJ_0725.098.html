	<p class="article-leader">Negotiators at the bipartisan budget talks hope to trade
deficit-reduction packages this week, a sign the talks may be
about to get more serious, participants said.
   Participants cautioned that differences on taxes and
spending cuts remain wide and that it will be difficult to
bridge them before Congress leaves for its August recess.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But an exchange of plans between the Bush administration
and congressional Democrats could be a significant step
forward. Negotiators also agreed to "a code of conduct" that
forbids them from talking publicly about the details of their
discussions, another hint that the talks may finally be
changing character after more than two months.</p>
<p>Democrats and Republicans both warned there has been no
breakthrough yet. House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D.,
Mo.) said negotiators were making "incremental progress." His
Republican counterpart, Rep. Robert Michel of Illinois, said:
"I thought I was a patient person. But I'm getting awfully
impatient. Nothing's happened."</p>
<p>President Bush and top congressional Democrats, meanwhile,
negotiated a cease-fire in an attempt to save the budget
summit, but Mr. Bush promptly took to the campaign trail to
criticize Democrats as big spenders.</p>
<p>"There is a general consensus that we need to concentrate
on reducing the partisan comments," House Speaker Thomas
Foley (D., Wash.) said after meeting with Mr. Bush and other
congressional leaders. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
confirmed that both sides agreed "that they would try to keep
the rhetoric under control and really try to make this a
productive week."</p>
<p>But within hours, in remarks prepared for delivery to New
York Republicans, Mr. Bush said that "to deal with a Democrat
Congress is to often face government by gridlock -- with
spending skyrocketing out of control, good legislation thrown
aside for pork and a budget deficit looming over our
children's children."</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, speaking to Pennsylvania Republicans
in Philadelphia, the president alternated between his roles
as party leader and head of state. In his prepared text, he
declared that when the two parties' philosophies on taxes,
spending and education are compared, "our side wins."</p>
<p>"As long as spending runs out of control in Congress," he
added, "the American people will pay the price."</p>
<p>But he inserted more conciliatory remarks, some written
and some ad libbed, expressing hope that the budget deadlock
can be broken. "I salute those Democrats in the leadership
who are now working with me . . . trying to achieve a
bipartisan agreement that we all can live with that would be
good for our country."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush is to meet with congressional leaders again this
morning, and summit negotiators plan to reconvene this
afternoon. The two sides are seeking a package of tax
increases and spending cuts to shrink the deficit by $50
billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.</p>
