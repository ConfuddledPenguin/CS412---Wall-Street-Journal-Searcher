	<p class="article-leader">Citing a 40% decline from a year ago in its pulp and paper
sales, Weyerhaeuser Co. reported a 26% drop in its
second-quarter earnings to $114.3 million, or 54 cents a
share, from $154.9 million in the year-earlier period. The
second quarter ended July 1.
   Sales of the forest products, real estate and financial
services concern declined 10% to $2.39 billion, from $2.64
billion for the year-ago quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale of the company's gypsum, wood paneling and
nursery and garden units have "obviously had an impact on our
sales," said a company spokesman. The final stage of the
company's refocusing effort will be completed by the third
quarter, he added.</p>
<p>The Tacoma, Wash.-based company also said weaknesses in
several areas contributed to the poor earnings results.
Forest products results were flat year-to-year, and its
Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Co.'s earnings were off
substantially from year earlier. However, the company said
its financial services units were strong.</p>
<p>For the six months, earnings dropped 19%, to $244.3
million, or $1.15 a share, from $303 million, or $1.43 a
share, a year ago.</p>
<p>Sales declined 6%, to $4.67 billion, from $4.97 billion
for the six months period.</p>
