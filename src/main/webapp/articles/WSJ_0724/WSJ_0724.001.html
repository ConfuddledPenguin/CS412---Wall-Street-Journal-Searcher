	<p class="article-leader">An effort to solve the financial woes of a big
student-loan guarantor was dropped in the face of federal
opposition, leaving open the possibility of bank losses
unless the government agrees to a full rescue.
   The guarantor, Higher Education Assistance Foundation,
said it ended merger talks with Nebraska Student Loan Program
Inc. The merger was aimed at transferring some or all of
HEAF's $9.6 billion in guarantees of high-defaulting student
loans to the Nebraska agency. The Education Department is
developing its own plan to resolve HEAF's financial crisis,
but details aren't known.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>HEAF, a nonprofit corporation based in Overland Park,
Kan., is incurring deficits because of high defaults on loans
it guarantees. It portrayed itself as near collapse last week
to try to sell the Nebraska transaction in Washington,
according to people HEAF briefed.</p>
<p>The Nebraska agency also disclosed that "two or three"
other guarantee agencies have approached it seeking to unload
loan guarantees but that these discussions have also been
terminated. The disclosure supported speculation in the
student-loan industry that financial problems are spreading
because of high defaults and aren't limited to HEAF. There
are about 55 guarantee agencies in the aid program, standing
behind about $51 billion in educational loans.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Education Department said the
department rejected the HEAF merger proposal because the
Nebraska agency could have been overwhelmed by HEAF's size
and because the proposal would have unfairly extended a
valuable exemption to HEAF under the loan program.</p>
<p>When students default under the loan program, the
guarantee agencies must usually pay lenders 100% of the
unpaid principal, which qualifies them for reimbursement from
the Education Department. But when agencies' default
reimbursements hit certain levels, the government pays them
only 80% of loan value. This is how HEAF is losing money.</p>
<p>The Nebraska agency, because it is relatively new,
receives 100% reimbursement unconditionally and will continue
to for a year. HEAF wanted to transfer a large portion of its
riskiest guarantees to the agency to secure full repayment.</p>
<p>HEAF says it has met payments on all lenders' default
claims but that its position has been worsened by the
Education Department's disclosure of its financial troubles
last week.</p>
<p>"The public representation of this information has caused,
for understandable reasons, members of the lending community
to lose confidence in the HEAF guarantee," Mr. Westbrook
said. "Such loss of confidence obviously puts us in an
untenable position. We have been told (by the Education
Department) that the option of merging with Nebraska is
unacceptable and we will receive a proposed solution
imminently. We have not received that solution."</p>
<p>Nebraska Student Loan Program said one of the reasons it
was talking to HEAF was to protect Nebraska Higher Education
Loan Program -- a buyer of loans that repackages them as
bonds -- against possible losses if HEAF fails to honor its
guarantees. Nebraska Higher Education Loan Program "holds a
large volume" of HEAF-guaranteed paper, Nebraska Student Loan
said. "Any difficulty HEAF may have had in honoring its
commitments would be of significant concern" to the Nebraska
loan repackager, it added.</p>
<p>One of HEAF's largest creditors is Student Loan Marketing
Association. Sallie Mae, which extended an $865 million
credit line to HEAF last December, is one of the country's
largest holders of student loans, which it purchases
wholesale from lenders. Sallie Mae's stock plunged $4.125 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday to
close at $49.875 a share.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Sallie Mae yesterday reiterated a
statement that the company "would not suffer any material
loss" because of HEAF's problems. "We don't believe there is
any doubt we would be able to collect 100% of what we've
advanced to HEAF," she said.</p>
