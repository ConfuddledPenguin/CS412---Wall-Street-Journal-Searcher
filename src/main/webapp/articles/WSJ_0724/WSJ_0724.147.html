	<p class="article-leader">BLUE BELL, Pa. -- Unisys Corp. unveiled several mainframe
computers that are generally 15% to 20% faster than its
current models, helping the computer and defense-electronics
company flesh out two important product lines.
   Machines in the new A16 series, toward the high end of the
A series, are designed to replace the A9 and A10 and some A12
models. These are, for example, more than twice as powerful
as the A10, and priced a bit less than twice as much. The
five A16s are priced from $1.8 million to $5.9 million.
Unisys also unveiled four A12s that are 20% faster than
current counterparts, and priced at $495,000 to $2.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company introduced machines at the high and low ends
of its other major line of mainframes, the 2200. The 2200/600
ES is as much as 15% faster than current high-end machines
but requires only 40% as much power and cooling. Prices range
from $2.3 million to $8.8 million. At the low end, Unisys
introduced the 2200/100, aimed at individual departments of
big companies. The 2200/100 -- available immediately, as are
all the other machines -- ranges from $115,000 to $200,000 in
price.</p>
<p>All of the machines are likely to appeal mainly to current
Unisys customers but are nonetheless important. Though
Unisys's market share in mainframes has been ebbing in recent
years, as more customers go for machines that are compatible
with International Business Machines Corp. equipment,
Unisys's mainframe lines are still its mainstay.</p>
<p>Unisys, which was marginally profitable in the first half
after a $639 million loss last year, must keep these lines
healthy until it can make the transition from reliance on big
systems toward small computers that run software that is
standard in the industry.</p>
