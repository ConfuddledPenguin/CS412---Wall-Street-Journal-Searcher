	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND (AP) -- Nestle Enterprises Inc. won't proceed
with an expansion of its Stouffer Restaurant Co. and instead
will try to sell the subsidiary, the Swiss-owned conglomerate
announced.
   "The decision follows an extensive evaluation of the
long-range business strategy of Nestle in the United States,"
Nestle Enterprises said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nestle, one of three U.S. subsidiaries of Swiss-based
Nestle S.A., said it would begin "an orderly process of
preparing the restaurant group for sale."</p>
<p>Stouffer operates 65 restaurants, including outlets under
the names of J.B. Winberie, James Tavern, Rusty Scupper and
Parkers' Lighthouse as well as the "Top" restaurants in New
York, Boston, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Columbus, Ohio, and
Cleveland.</p>
<p>James M. Biggar, Nestle Enterprises chairman, said
operating restaurants is better suited to specialty chains
and entrepreneurs than a large corporation.</p>
<p>He said Nestle will focus its efforts on its Nestle Foods
Corp., Nestle Hills Coffee Co., Stouffer Foods Corp.,
Stouffer Hotel Co., L.J. Minor Corp., Wine World Estates,
Sunmark Inc., and FreshNes Foods Corp.</p>
