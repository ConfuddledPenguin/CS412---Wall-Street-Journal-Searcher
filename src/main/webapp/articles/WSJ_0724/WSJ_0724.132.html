	<p class="article-leader">Fueled by a strong demand for energy in June, Southern
Co.'s second-quarter earnings rose 13%, to $216 million, or
68 cents a share, breaking a string of three consecutive
quarterly earnings declines.
   In the 1989 second quarter, the Atlanta-based energy
utilities operator earned $187 million, or 60 cents a share.
Revenue increased to $2.01 billion in the most recent
quarter, from $1.88 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company warned that it may have to take a $190 million
charge against future earnings, if the Georgia Court of
Appeals declines to reconsider a ruling against a Southern
Co. unit. In the 5-4 decision last week, the court refused to
order the Georgia Public Service Commission to reconsider a
$951 million disallowance of costs related to Georgia Power
Co.'s Plant Vogtle nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Southern took a $229 million after-tax
write-off, after the total budget for the plant exceeded a
self-imposed cap.</p>
