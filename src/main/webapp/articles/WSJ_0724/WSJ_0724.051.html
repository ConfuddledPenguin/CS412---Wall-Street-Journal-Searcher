	<p class="article-leader">The stock market pitched and heaved yesterday, the Dow
Jones Industrials trading off as much as 100 points before
closing down 56 at 2904. On Friday it lost 32 points. Only a
week ago it was hitting its record high of 2999.75. Being as
licensed as anyone, we'd like to toss a thought into the
hopper of explanations: Over the past week, the market has
caught scent of a Washington budget deal.
   After all, the Dow Jones Average hit its record the day of
Budget Director Richard Darman's mid-session review of the
economy, fraught with warnings of "crisis" unless a
deficit-closing deal was reached. Yesterday, the government
reported that its deficit for the first nine months of the
fiscal year increased to $163 billion from $105 billion in
the same period a year earlier. The Dow Jones News Service
helpfully noted "government receipts totaled $777.75 billion,
compared with $749.14 billion the year before. Outlays
through June totaled $940.84 billion, compared with $854.54
billion a year earlier." But news from the budget talks
revolved around stock-transfer taxes, limits on personal
deductions and other monstrosities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest consumer price index report showed an increase
of 4.7% from a year earlier. Commex gold jumped $7.80 to
$369.10 yesterday. Last week Fed Chairman Greenspan held out
the prosect of easier money after a budget agreement with
"major, substantive, credible cuts in the budget deficit."</p>
<p>So the pieces are falling into place for the following
scenario: a cosmetic budget deal, with empty promises on
spending. New and awkward taxes. And easier money. The stock
market is the town meeting starting to boo.</p>
<p>The market turmoil, the threat of new inflation, the
current stupor in the economy -- none of it would have
happened if Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell had stayed
out of the way and let Congress cut the capital-gains tax
when it wanted to. Vice President Dan Quayle, outside the
Beltway at the Republican National Committee earlier this
month, got it right: "Congress's failure to pass the
president's capital-gains proposal last year is partly
responsible for the current slowdown in economic growth."</p>
<p>All the more so since evidence accumulates that a
capital-gains tax cut would pay for itself in new revenues.
The Joint Economic Committee recently lined up testimony from
Allen Sinai, an economist who has previously opposed a lower
capital-gains rate as a handout to "the rich." Members and
staff started to climb walls when Mr. Sinai testified he'd
changed his mind. His econometric model, he said, showed that
a cut in the capital-gains rate to 15% from the current rate
would increase GNP by about 0.4% a year through 1995, and
generate $30 billion to $40 billion in additional government
revenues.</p>
<p>"A capital-gains tax cut would increase capital spending,
GNP, income, jobs, household wealth and improve the U.S.'s
competitive posture," Mr. Sinai concludes. "For me, that
outweighs its effect on income distribution."</p>
<p>Of course, if a capital-gains cut increases revenues, it
can scarcely be any kind of handout to "the rich" that needed
to be balanced by raising other taxes. If you believe only
"the rich" pay capital-gains tax, an increase in revenues
from this tax is proof positive that "the rich" are paying
more taxes, not less. Actually, though, "the rich" happen to
include a lot of perfectly normal folks.</p>
<p>In particular the elderly, as a new study shows. In a
study for the National Center for Policy Analysis, former
Treasury economists Gary and Aldona Robbins noticed that the
elderly hold about 40% of the capital stock of the U.S. They
found that every year almost half of elderly households with
incomes between $25,000 and $40,000 report capital-gains
income. These people have over their lifetimes actually
managed to accumulate savings; all economists agree that the
American economy needs more of them doing more saving.</p>
<p>This is, however, the one class of taxpayers who are now
paying higher marginal tax rates. Capital gains are now taxed
at normal rates, and above a certain income, half of Social
Security benefits are too. In 1978, an elderly couple with a
capital gain of $20,000 and $30,500 of other income,
including Social Security, would have paid a marginal rate of
16% on their capital gains. In 1985, the marginal rate would
have declined to 9%. Today it would be 42%, plus state and
local taxes.</p>
<p>So you have a capital-gains proposal that would both
increase revenues and help the economy. And you have an
incipient budget deal that at best would displace some
borrowing with taxes, probably ones that would hobble the
economy. In the past week Washington has moved a lot closer
to the latter. No one should be surprised that a formerly
ebullient stock market has turned nervous.</p>
