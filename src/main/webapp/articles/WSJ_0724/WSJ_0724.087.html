	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Michael Eskridge resigned as president of
National Broadcasting Co.'s consumer and business cable
channel, CNBC, to start a consulting company to manage media
properties.
   Mr. Eskridge, 45, said he wasn't asked to leave his job
and that his first client will be GE Capital, a unit of NBC's
parent company, General Electric Co. Mr. Eskridge, whose new
office will be in the same building as CNBC in Fort Lee,
N.J., said it hasn't been determined yet whether his
operation will be a subsidiary of GE Capital or an
independent contractor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I had always talked about wanting to run broadcast
properties on my own someday," said Mr. Eskridge, who had
management experience in both radio and television in his
nearly 20 years with NBC. "It just so happens that GE Capital
came to NBC asking for help on some of the broadcast
properties they had financed, and they were put in touch with
me." He said he has already begun helping GE Capital and that
he'll be working initially with half a dozen properties,
mostly television stations.</p>
<p>Despite a perception in the industry that NBC has been
disappointed with CNBC's ratings, subscriber base and ad
sales, Mr. Eskridge said the channel has been a success and
its future is bright. CNBC started in April 1989 with about
13 million subscribers and has about 17 million now. The goal
is 30 million subscribers.</p>
