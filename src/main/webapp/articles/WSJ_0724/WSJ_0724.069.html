	<p class="article-leader">The obvious thing about Supreme Court nominee David Souter
is that few people outside of New Hampshire know much about
him, though then-Governor John Sununu appointed him to the
state Supreme Court. He's been a federal judge for less than
a year and has written very few federal opinions or
law-review articles.
   The point is that his paper trail is scant indeed, making
it tough for Senate liberals to Bork him. We're confident
that as Judge Souter's state-court opinions go on public
display, they'll demonstrate his credentials, and his
original-intent jurisprudence. Yet the Bork lynching
continues to extract its toll; something's seriously amiss
when an unknown record becomes a huge advantage in
Washington.</p>
