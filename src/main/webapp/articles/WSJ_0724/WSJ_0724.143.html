	<p class="article-leader">McIlwraith McEacharn Ltd., an Australian coal-mining
concern, is leading a consortium with Toyo Menka Kaisha Ltd.
and Nippon Oil Ltd., both of Japan, in a bid for control of
Oakbridge Ltd.
   Oakbridge, another Australian coal mining company, is
currently the target of a takeover bid by New Zealand-based
Elders Resources NZFP Ltd., which holds around 85% of
Oakbridge.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The McIlwraith consortium said yesterday that it will
offer 88 cents a share for each common share in Oakbridge, 88
cents for each convertible note, and 0.13 cents for each
listed option. That offer values all of Oakbridge at around
300 million Australian dollars ($235.5 million).</p>
<p>Elders Resources is bidding 90 cents a share for
Oakbridge, but that offer is conditional on winning at least
90% of the shares. Otherwise the offer is 86 cents a share,
McIlwraith said.</p>
<p>McIlwraith's bid is aimed only at acquiring Elders
Resources' controlling bloc of Oakbridge shares, but it will
take all shares offered to it.</p>
<p>It is advising other shareholders to hold on to their
shares. The McIlwraith consortium currently holds 2.6% of
Oakbridge's stock. It said other investors holding more than
10% of the stock won't accept the Elders Resources offer,
indicating the 90% threshold won't be achieved by Elders
Resources.</p>
