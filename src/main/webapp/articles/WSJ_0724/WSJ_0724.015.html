	<p class="article-leader">MANAGUA, Nicaragua -- Late last month, the commanders of
the U.S.-backed Contras formed ranks for the last time,
standing solemnly as their weapons were melted down with
blowtorches.
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the newly elected
conservative president, hailed the end of nearly a decade of
guerrilla warfare against the leftist Sandinista party that
she defeated in February's election.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Nicaragua remains a bitterly divided society.</p>
<p>In their new role as the opposition, the Sandinistas are
undertaking their own fifth-column resistance, not on jungle
footpaths but in the corridors of dozens of state agencies.
Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega calls it "governing from
below."</p>
<p>After two crippling general strikes by Sandinista unions
and a load of problems from an intransigent Sandinista
bureaucracy, the three-month-old Chamorro government is
becoming painfully aware of what he means.</p>
<p>On the desk of Carlos Briceno, a Chamorro loyalist who
heads the state television network, sits a rock the size of a
softball. It was thrown at his home during a Sandinista
strike two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Briceno's problems go back even before that, to the
day in April that he took office. He says his Sandinista
predecessor carried out the equivalent of a scorched earth
policy. The television network was left with debts of
$500,000 and a bank balance of just $300. More than 30 of the
station's automobiles were missing. A transmitter tower had
been dismantled and hauled off. "There weren't even any
videocassettes," says Mr. Briceno, "which was like going to
work at a hospital without syringes."</p>
<p>The only thing Mr. Briceno was left with an excess of was
employees -- a total of 300 of them. That's been more of a
curse than a blessing, given the fervent loyalty most of them
display to the Sandinistas. When Mr. Briceno assigned a
reporter to a story on an anti-Sandinista press conference,
the reporter came back hours later claiming to be unable to
find the address. The next day, the reporter located the
address but fouled the footage by getting dirt in his camera.</p>
<p>Though officials of Mrs. Chamorro's government seem
shell-shocked by this resistance, the Sandinista strategy
shouldn't be that unfamiliar to them. After all, the Contras
also did everything in their power to undermine the incumbent
Sandinista government's economic and political authority.</p>
<p>"It sounds strange to say it, but we are finding that
there are many ways in which it is easier to be the
opposition," says Sofia Montenegro, an editor of the official
Sandinista newspaper, Barricada.</p>
<p>Many Nicaraguans are willing to overlook Mrs. Chamorro's
slow start as an inevitable phase in the country's
development toward democracy. The president can still draw on
a reservoir of good will after having quickly made good on
her campaign pledge to abolish compulsory military service.</p>
<p>Still, the early difficulties have set off messy public
disputes among Mrs. Chamorro's political allies over her
strategy of "national reconciliation." The centerpiece of
that plan was leaving Sandinistas in control of the army
while the fighting force was scaled down. To the hardline
businessmen and landowners who backed her -- including Vice
President Virgilio Godoy -- it was appeasement. To the
foreign-educated technocrats who form the inner circle of her
government it was pragmatism.</p>
<p>"We are a government with popular support but without
coercive force," says Francisco Mayorga, the Yale
University-trained head of the central bank and architect of
the new government's economic strategy. "We have jumped on --
have fallen on, really -- this horse and are trying to grab
hold of the reins while we're riding it."</p>
<p>More than anything, the government's trying to get a grip
on inflation, which has been running at around 100% a month.
Mr. Mayorga's plan was to quickly pare the deficit, fix
distortions in the exchange rate and prices and then launch a
new currency at par with the dollar. The new currency would
have the financial backing of some $500 million in
international assistance flowing into Nicaragua and the
psychological support of the flurry of market-oriented
economic reforms the government hoped to unleash in its first
days.</p>
<p>Even Mr. Mayorga acknowledges that the Sandinista strikes
and bureaucratic foot-dragging have delayed those reforms by
weeks. Typical is a faltering Chamorro administration program
to allow landowners whose property had been improperly
confiscated by the Sandinistas to quickly rent it back.</p>
<p>So far, the program has only yielded a harvest of
irritation for expropriated landowners like Mario Gonzalez
Arguello. In 1983, the Sandinistas took away several hundred
acres of prime cotton-farming land Mr. Gonzalez owned in
central Nicaragua. Mr. Gonzalez left for Miami to make a
living selling cars.</p>
<p>Mr. Gonzalez returned this year and quickly won approval
of his claim from officials in Managua. But actually taking
control of the land has proven a greater chore. Three times
he has tried to visit the land, only to be driven off on each
occasion by machete-wielding Sandinista sympathizers who work
on the government-owned farm abutting his property.</p>
<p>"On one hand, the government is giving me back my land,
but on the other hand government employees are holding onto
it," he says. "It's absurd."</p>
<p>Of the 11 landowners who won approval of petitions for the
return of confiscated lands, only one has succeeded in taking
control of his property, according to the leading Nicaraguan
growers lobby.</p>
<p>The Sandinistas have also stymied significant steps to
trim the bloated bureaucracy or sell some of the more than
400 state-owned enterprises acquired by the leftist
government.</p>
<p>The Chamorro government's difficulty in getting on with
its economic program has given second thoughts to the foreign
investors who were also being heavily counted on. Juan Lopez
Zeledon, a business leader and real estate developer, said
that around the time of the inauguration nearly a dozen
foreign investors were looking seriously at an office
building he owns in central Managua. "After the first
Sandinista strike in May, no one would even consider an
investment," he says.</p>
<p>Government department heads such as Mr. Briceno say that
the struggle for control of the bureaucracy is likely to be a
war of attrition. But "every day that we stay in control, we
get stronger," says Mr. Briceno.</p>
<p>It's clear Mr. Briceno also knows a thing or two about
infighting. Last Thursday, when the Sandinistas organized
public rallies marking the anniversary of their 1979
revolution, he aired an all-star lineup of movies. "If people
can stay home and watch `Batman,' you can be sure they won't
go to the square to see Daniel Ortega," Mr. Briceno says.</p>
