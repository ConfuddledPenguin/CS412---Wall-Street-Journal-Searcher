	<p class="article-leader">PALO ALTO, Calif. -- Varian Associates Inc., citing a
one-time charge, reported a net loss of $34.1 million, or
$1.76 a share, for its third quarter, ended June 29.
   The high-technology concern had profit of $9.1 million, or
45 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter
rose 13% to $343.6 million from $304 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The one-time expense was a previously announced
restructuring charge of $47.1 million after taxes.</p>
<p>Excluding operations that are to be discontinued, Varian
had a net loss of $18.9 million, or 98 cents a share,
compared with a net gain of $9 million, or 44 cents a share,
a year earlier.</p>
<p>Without the one-time charge, Varian said it would have had
profit on continuing operations of $13 million, or 67 cents a
share, reversing a four-quarter earnings slide. Softening
demand for semiconductor equipment and a shrinking military
market fueled the decline. A spokesman said the company ended
its tailspin through improved factory efficiency and rising
orders for medical equipment, environmental monitoring
instruments and pollution controls.</p>
<p>In May, the company announced that by September it planned
to sell five operations and 10 product lines, many of them
military-related, and eliminate 600 jobs. While the company
has laid off about 600 people -- including about 140 from
corporate headquarters -- Varian has yet to complete the sale
of any of its targeted businesses, which make radio frequency
systems, broadcast equipment and night-vision goggles. A
spokesman said Varian is, however, negotiating with several
potential buyers.</p>
<p>For the nine months, Varian posted a loss of $18.7
million, or 96 cents a share, compared with earnings of $30.5
million, or $1.46 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Revenue fell 4.5% to $926.1 million from $886.2 million.</p>
