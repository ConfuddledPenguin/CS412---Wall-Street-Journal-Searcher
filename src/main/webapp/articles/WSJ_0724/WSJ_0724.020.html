	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Meritor Savings Bank reported a
second-quarter loss of $136 million, or $3.90 per share, as
expected. The loss reflects heavy charges for
recapitalization and restructuring, including a provision of
$43 million for loan losses.
   Meritor's year-earlier losses for the second quarter were
$21 million, or 61 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Roger S. Hillas, Meritor chairman, said the results showed
"progress in long-term strategic restructuring of the
institution." A debt-recapitalization plan approved by
federal regulators this month will increase Meritor's
shareholder equity by about $98 million, which will be
reflected in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The plan will put Meritor in compliance with all the new
capital requirements under the thrift bailout law passed last
year. Meritor, the nation's largest thrift in the early
1980s, has shrunk nearly 70% to about $7 billion from $13
billion.</p>
<p>Among the costs and charges in the quarter, Meritor had a
loss of $74.5 million, or $2.12 per share, in connection with
its sale of 54 branches to Mellon Bank Corp. Meritor also
wrote off $172 million in goodwill connected with the branch
offices sale, terminated interest rate swap and floor
contracts at a cost of $55 million and established a $54
million reserve for expenses from unused office space.</p>
<p>Meritor also quadrupled its provision for loan losses from
a year earlier to $43 million. A "significant portion" of the
loan-loss provision is due to deteriorating commercial and
real-estate loans and Meritor's plans to accelerate the
disposal of non-performing assets, Mr. Hillas said.</p>
