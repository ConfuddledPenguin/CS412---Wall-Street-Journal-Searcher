	<p class="article-leader">Mycogen Corp., San Diego, posted its first profitable
quarter, with net income in the second quarter of $209,000,
or two cents a share, compared with a net loss of $184,000,
or three cents a share, in the second quarter of last year.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 48% to $4.3 million from $2.9
million last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the first half, the maker of biological pesticides
said its net loss narrowed to $466,000, or five cents a
share, from a net loss of $919,000, or 13 cents a share, last
year. Revenue for the first six months was $7.4 million, up
55% from $4.7 million in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The profitable quarter follows several recent moves by the
company, including receiving federal government approval in
March to do large-scale commercial tests on a genetically
engineered pesticide called MVP. Mycogen also entered into
two separate joint research pacts; with Monsanto Co. in June
to develop plants genetically resistant to pests, and with
S.C. Johnson & Son Inc. in May to develop biological
pesticides for common household pests.</p>
