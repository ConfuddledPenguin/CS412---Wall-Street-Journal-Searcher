	<p class="article-leader">Blackstone Group and media investor I. Martin Pompadur
said they formed a joint venture to invest $100 million of
equity capital in domestic and foreign media and
entertainnent properties.
   The investors are entering the media market at the bottom,
which may be to their advantage as buyers. With uncertainty
in the regulatory market and the restrictions on highly
leveraged transactions that characterized the cable industry
in the past, for example, cable system sales have slowed to a
trickle. Radio and television stations have been hurt by a
difficult advertising climate, as have newspapers and
magazines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's really a sluggish time" because of the various
problems confronting the industry, Mr. Pompadur said, adding
that a number of media properties could be helped with an
infusion of equity and some operating expertise. Henry
Silverman, a general partner at the Blackstone investment
firm, said his group believes it is "a perfect time to get
into the media business" because many operators are facing a
liquidity crunch. He said the venture will specifically seek
distressed situations.</p>
<p>Mr. Pompadur is a longtime media executive and investor
who has raised several hundred million dollars since 1983
through various public limited partnerships for media
investments.</p>
<p>Blackstone's Mr. Silverman said the $100 million will come
from Blackstone's general pool of funds.</p>
