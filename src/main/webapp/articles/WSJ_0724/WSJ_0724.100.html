	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks withdrew further, with prices displaying
widespread bearishness on the Japanese government bond
market's weakness, as well as cautiousness amid busy
arbitrage selling, traders said.
   Meanwhile, London share prices sank in tandem with Wall
Street to close sharply lower, as few issues were able to
escape the general onslaught.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 526.73 points to
31894.79. The drop represents a retrenchment of 1277.49
points, or 3.9%, in the past week.</p>
<p>At the end of the morning session Tuesday in Tokyo, the
Nikkei index was down 67.66 points to 31827.13.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section Monday was estimated at 300
million shares, down from 503.6 million shares Friday. Losers
widely outpaced advancers 861 to 151, while 110 issues were
unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 33.51 points, or 1.42%, to 2329.92. The
Topix also was under selling pressure by arbitragers, though
the average still managed to outperform the Nikkei Index.</p>
<p>The second section index fell 39.45 points, or 0.90%, to
4360.11. Volume was estimated at 13.5 million shares, down
from 17.7 million shares Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said they knew before arriving in the morning that
the bond market was bound to remain weak after Friday's move
by the Bank of Japan to call 1.35 trillion yen ($9.07
billion) of bank loans had jostled yields out of a tolerable
range.</p>
<p>In an unusual and reverse move Monday morning, the Bank of
Japan purchased overnight commercial paper twice for a total
of 500 billion yen, but the attempt to put a cap on yields
was rather ineffective, traders said.</p>
<p>The stock market paralleled the bond market's unwinding,
although a lack of volume indicated more uncertainty than
panic, traders said.</p>
<p>At the close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the yield on the
benchmark, the No. 119, 4.8% coupon of 1999 was up 9.5 basis
points, or hundredths of a percentage point, at 7.47%, the
weakest closing yield for the No. 119. The price was down
0.42, at 85.75. The yield traded to a six-year high of 7.475%
before the stock exchange close.</p>
<p>Moreover, front-month September bond futures prices were
also hitting lows not seen since early February, traders
said. Indicating further concern about the direction of
interest rates, the move in bond futures encouraged greater
liquidation by stock market participants, traders added.</p>
<p>J. Graham Biggart, head of futures and options trading at
Schroder Securities, said that one of the major bearish
conditions of the market right now is the vast number of
investors holding long positions and who are being forced to
liquidate because of margin calls.</p>
<p>Buying opportunities are limited as it is, with interest
rate concerns damping such sentiment. But with the margin
calls, any small rallies will immediately be taken as a
chance to sell off, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the yen is beginning to gain interest with
rates at high levels, although there hasn't yet been a
notable advance. Rumors and anxieties that the arrest of the
head of a major Tokyo stock speculator group Thursday could
lead to another Japanese political scandal have prompted some
dollar-buying.</p>
<p>Should the yen manage to strengthen substantially,
however, stock prices could receive some help, traders said,
as domestic-demand related stocks might rally.</p>
<p>Financial shares were broadly lower.</p>
<p>Mitsui Trust fell 20 yen to 1560 yen, and Mitsubishi Trust
fell 40 yen to 1830 yen.</p>
<p>Nomura Securities dropped 30 yen to 2150 yen, while Nikko
Securities slipped 30 yen to 1180 yen.</p>
<p>Construction shares were lower. Nippon Hodo fell 200 yen
to 3610 yen, Ohbayashi Corp. slipped 30 yen to 1650 yen,
Taisei eased 30 yen to 1260 yen, and Sekisui House fell 40
yen to 2070 yen.</p>
<p>Many high-technology shares also fell. Sony dropped 90 yen
to 8800 yen, and Fanuc fell 60 yen to 7350 yen.</p>
<p>In London, most of the session was listless, as investors
found scant reason for getting involved in the market during
the usually stagnant summer.</p>
<p>But once New York opened, London stocks sagged under the
weight of Wall Street's losses. U.K. stocks rebounded from
lows just before the close.</p>
<p>"It came quickly and sharply and obviously sentiment has
been knocked in our market. But I wouldn't say there was an
awful lot of selling pressure," one market maker said.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index settled
at 2359.7, just slightly better than the late afternoon low
of 2352.5 and well below the opening intraday high of 2406.3.
The index was off 40.4 points on the day.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell 31 points to
1867.1. Volume stood at a relatively meager 369.8 million
shares compared with 437.6 million Friday.</p>
<p>There were few stocks that went against the general
downward bias. Of these, Lasmo added 12 pence to 434 pence
(22 cents to $7.89) ahead of its interim earnings tomorrow,
and Burmah Oil gained on a buy recommendation from a small
regional-based U.K. brokerage firm.</p>
<p>Also bucking the lower trend was food maker Ranks Hovis
McDougall, which advanced 7 pence to 347 pence. Anglo Group,
one of Sir James Goldsmith's bid vehicles, said it will offer
holders the opportunity to receive listed Ranks Hovis shares
in exchange for their now-unlisted investment in Anglo.</p>
<p>The day's biggest loser was Reuters, which shed 38 pence
to #12.29 ahead of interim figures set for disclosure today.</p>
<p>After the close of trading, U.K. conglomerate Hanson said
it has held discussions with the government that could lead
to the private sale of PowerGen, an electricity generator.
Lord Hanson, chairman of Hanson, confirmed the company has a
"firm interest" in making a bid for PowerGen. Hanson fell
7.25 pence to 233 pence.</p>
<p>Thorn EMI shed 24 pence to 735 pence. Dealers said the
stock was sold on rumors of an imminent acquisition.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, shares closed lower in Paris, Frankfurt,
Zurich, Amsterdam, Stockholm, Madrid and Milan. South African
gold stocks closed higher. Brussels was closed for a holiday.</p>
<p>Also, stocks closed lower in Sydney, Taipei, Seoul,
Wellington and Manila, mixed in Singapore, and higher in Hong
Kong.</p>
