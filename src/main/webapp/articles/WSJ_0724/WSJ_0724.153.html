	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush, seeking to defuse a
political fight already brewing over his first vacancy on the
Supreme Court, struck quickly by choosing a conservative
jurist with no paper trail on abortion.
   In nominating Judge David H. Souter of New Hampshire,
President Bush chose a strict constructionist who he hopes
will satisfy conservatives, but a man whose lack of any
articulated stand on abortion may make him acceptable to
moderates in the party. And by moving within 72 hours of
getting an opening, the president short-circuited efforts by
activists to campaign for a nominee that took their side on
the abortion issue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Souter, who will turn 51 during his Senate
confirmation hearings this fall, is a former member of the
New Hampshire Supreme Court. State courts, however, rarely
hear abortion cases. In his current post on the federal
bench, as a member of the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals
in Boston, he has spent exactly one day hearing cases. During
his confirmation proceedings for that job -- he was
eventually approved unanimously -- he told the Senate he had
given no speeches worthy of reporting.</p>
<p>"He doesn't talk much about abortion, even to his closest
friends," says Thomas Rath, a former New Hampshire attorney
general.</p>
<p>Mr. Souter doesn't have any reputation for the kind of
conservative judicial activism that aroused fierce opposition
to President Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork in 1987. "He
isn't a politician or an ideologue, and he's not much
affected by contemporary political winds at all," says
Gregory Smith, another former New Hampshire attorney general.</p>
<p>Even Clesson Blaisdell, the dean of Democrats in the New
Hampshire state senate, says, "I can't say anything bad about
him." Mr. Blaisdell's words may carry some extra weight in
Washington: He co-chaired the 1988 New Hampshire presidential
campaign of Delaware Democrat Joseph Biden, the chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, which will decide on Judge
Souter's nomination. Mr. Blaisdell is offering to speak to
Sen. Biden on the judge's behalf.</p>
<p>"He'll interpret the law," Mr. Blaisdell says of Judge
Souter. "He won't be there representing one side or the
other."</p>
<p>In one of Judge Souter's few actions regarding abortion,
he joined with a majority on the New Hampshire Supreme Court
in 1986 ruling that a woman who gave birth to a seriously
deformed child could sue her doctors because she wasn't
adequately informed of abortion as an option in her case.
That decision may give pause to anti-abortion activists, who
generally see such "wrongful birth" decisions as promoting
abortion. On the other hand, Judge Souter wrote a separate
opinion expressing concern that the ruling would require
doctors to engage in abortion counseling of their patients,
even if they opposed abortion.</p>
<p>According to some of his friends, Mr. Souter's selection
follows a behind-the-scenes campaign waged on his behalf by a
group of New Hampshire Republican politicians led by Sen.
Warren Rudman and former Gov. John Sununu, now White House
chief of staff. They have been promoting Mr. Souter for the
Supreme Court ever since the Bork nomination failed. "It's
like having your younger brother put on the court," Mr.
Rudman said last night. Mr. Sununu officially recused himself
from the choice of a successor to the liberal and activist
Justice William Brennan.</p>
<p>Paul McEachern, a Democrat who became an avowed Sununu
adversary in losing two gubernatorial campaigns to him,
yesterday termed the Souter nomination an eminent one. "He's
perfect politically," he said. "He defuses a huge problem for
Bush because he has found a man with views that aren't really
on one side or the other. They're not going to pin him down
on abortion."</p>
<p>"If they wanted somebody who wasn't controversial, he
would be the ideal choice," added Rep. Chuck Douglas, a New
Hampshire Republican.</p>
<p>By many accounts, Judge Souter is a solitary man who loves
his books. Never married, listed in Who's Who as an
Episcopalian, he lives in Weare, N.H. -- population,
approximately 2,000 -- in an old farmhouse distinguished by a
living room "so cluttered with books there's a path to where
you can sit among the books," says Mr. Rath, the former state
official. He is a 1966 Harvard Law School graduate and Rhodes
Scholar who drives a dilapidated car. He hikes in the White
Mountains and has conquered all the 4,000-footers in the
area.</p>
<p>Though ambiguous on abortion, Mr. Souter's views on a
variety of other issues are decidedly conservative. On the
New Hampshire Supreme Court he wrote numerous decisions in
criminal cases, generally taking a tough stance and
recognizing society's interests in being protected.</p>
<p>In 1985, for instance, the New Hampshire court ruled that
the state constitution barred police from setting up
roadblocks to catch drunken drivers. Judge Souter was the
only dissenter, saying the technique provided substantial
benefits to society and minimal intrusion on individual
rights. This year, the U.S. Supreme Court adopted his view in
a 6-3 ruling in a Michigan case. Justice Brennan, whom Mr.
Souter would replace, dissented.</p>
<p>Mr. Souter's record on civil rights cases is also brief --
though, again, conspicuously conservative. He joined in a
1987 ruling restricting the rights of homosexuals to adopt
children. Sen. Rudman described a case in which the judge
ruled that testimony about a rape victim's behavior toward
some men in a bar was admissible. Women's groups attacked
that decision.</p>
<p>When he was New Hampshire attorney general earlier in his
career, Mr. Souter made a special appearance in court to
plead with a judge not to give suspended sentences to some
1,400 protesters arrested at the Seabrook nuclear plant. As a
judge he generally joined in rulings in favor of Public
Service Co. of New Hampshire in connection with Seabrook.</p>
<p>Conservative activists, though generally issuing
remarkably dispassionate statements about the nominee
yesterday, were crossing their fingers that Mr. Souter's
adherence to strict constitutional interpretation would also
make him an anti-abortion jurist. The National Right to Life
Committee took comfort in Mr. Bush's assurances that he was
nominating a justice who would "interpret the Constitution
according to its text." Robert Billings, legislative director
of the American Conservative Union, said that "we don't have
written cases yet or written opinions yet, but we feel the
opinions he has written on various cases point to the fact
that he's a strict constructionist."</p>
<p>If the Senate Judiciary Committee members "want to get
into some heavy questioning on Roe vs. Wade {the case
recognizing a right to abortion}, it will be a little bit of
a battle," Mr. Billings said. "If pushed to the wall, he'd
have to say Roe vs. Wade is bad jurisprudence" because of his
judicial philosophy, Mr. Billings maintained. Kate Michelman,
executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, raised questions about confirming "a nominee without
knowing" his abortion views.</p>
<p>President Bush, for his part, expressed annoyance at the
heavy focus on the abortion issue and tried to downplay its
significance. "You might just think the whole nomination had
something to do with abortion," Mr. Bush said. "And it's far
broader than that. I have too much respect for the Supreme
Court than to look at one specific issue and one alone."</p>
<p>Rather, Mr. Bush insisted that he chose Judge Souter
because of his broader conservative judicial philosophy,
without looking in detail into any issues or cases. He said
he never asked Judge Souter his views on abortion.</p>
<p>"What I'm certain of is that he will interpret the
Constitution and not legislate from the federal bench," Mr.
Bush said. "We've got a nominee here who is extraordinarily
intelligent, has a record, has been confirmed by the Senate,
and who has satisfied inquiry at the state and federal level
as to his objectivity and as to his judicial philosophy. And
I am satisfied as to all those counts."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush made his selection so quickly because he wanted
to "let the debate focus on the nominee and his talents"
rather than "get a lengthy debate started that would stir
over a bunch of issues that wouldn't be relevant," said
presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. Mr. Bush first met
Judge Souter Sunday night in the presidential residence, then
held a second meeting with him yesterday at the White House
to officially offer him the nomination, Mr. Fitzwater said.</p>
<p>The White House's quick action has the effect of
short-circuiting efforts by those Republicans who favor
abortion rights: They were preparing to send out 10,000
telegrams urging support of a nominee who takes such a stand.
The speed also cut short deliberations among conservative
activists over whether to endorse a particular person before
the president chose.</p>
<p>Judge Souter's prior nomination slipped through by
unanimous consent in a sparsely-attended, Friday-evening
Senate session on April 27. Several members of the Judiciary
Committee admitted that they recalled nothing about the
panel's brief hearings when Judge Souter was nominated to the
First Circuit.</p>
<p>"If the president hadn't indicated that he was a member of
the First Circuit Court of Appeals, I'm not sure I would have
known," said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, the Ohio Democrat, and
one of eight Democrats on the committee. "I stand in the
position of practically every other member of the Senate
Judiciary Committee: Judge Souter is pretty much a blank
slate."</p>
<p>But Mr. Metzenbaum added, "So far, in the last couple of
hours, I haven't heard anything against him."</p>
<p>Mr. Souter has a powerful sponsor in Sen. Rudman, who said
he urged Mr. Sununu, then governor, to appoint Judge Souter
to the New Hampshire court. At the time, Mr. Sununu could
barely contain his admiration for the judge. "When I'm old
and gray," he said at Mr. Souter's swearing-in ceremony in
1983, "people will say, `This is one of the greatest things
you did as governor.'"</p>
