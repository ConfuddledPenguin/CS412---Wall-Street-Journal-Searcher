	<p class="article-leader">NATIONAL CONVENIENCE STORES Inc. said its board voted to
suspend the quarterly dividend on its common stock. The
company's most recent quarterly dividend was eight cents a
share, paid May 4. The convenience-store operator said that
preliminary, unaudited results for its fiscal year ended June
30 show that its pretax operating loss has narrowed from a
year earlier, but the improved performance "is not sufficient
for the company to retain its common stock dividend." In
fiscal 1989, the company posted a pretax operating loss of
about $14.5 million, said J.C. Brewster, senior vice
president, finance. The net loss was $8.9 million. After a
gain on the sale of assets and an extraordinary credit from a
debt swap, Mr. Brewster said, National Convenience will
report a net profit for fiscal 1990.</p>
