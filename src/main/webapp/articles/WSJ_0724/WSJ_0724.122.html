	<p class="article-leader">Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS), the country's largest
commercial bank, said earnings in the second quarter improved
from the year-ago period, but were "still insufficient to
offset the shortfall in earnings carried over from the
previous quarter."
   In keeping with the practice of Swiss companies, UBS
didn't provide specific earnings figures for the second
quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>UBS said assets in the second quarter climbed to 181.3
billion francs ($129 billion) from 178.8 billion francs at
the end of the first quarter, and were up from 176.1 billion
francs at the end of 1989.</p>
