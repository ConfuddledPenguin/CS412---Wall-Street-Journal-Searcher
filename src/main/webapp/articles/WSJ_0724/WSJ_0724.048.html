	<p class="article-leader">The cereal joint venture of Nestle S.A. and General Mills
Inc., seeking to reach some of the world's biggest cereal
eaters, agreed to acquire for $167 million (#93 million) the
breakfast cereal business of Ranks Hovis McDougall PLC, which
holds a 15% share of the United Kingdom cereal market.
   The acquisition, the first since the venture's formation
last December, gives it a No. 3 position behind Kellogg Co.,
with 47%, and Weetabix, with a 19% market share in the U.K.
Ranks also is the largest maker of private-branded cereals in
Britain and distributes throughout Europe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Initially, the venture plans simply to operate the
business as is, but it hinted that eventually it would seek
to expand with either current General Mills brands or new
cereals.</p>
<p>Ranks Hovis had acquired the ready-to-eat cereal business
from RJR Nabisco, a unit of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.,
two years ago for about $144 million (#80 million). Ranks
distributes its products, principally Shredded Wheat and
Shreddies, in most of Western Europe.</p>
<p>A Ranks Hovis official said the company decided to sell
the cereal operation partly out of frustration at not being
able to become "a very strong second" to Kellogg, and partly
because it anticipates a bruising battle between Kellogg and
the joint venture.</p>
<p>"We know Kellogg will defend like mad, and General Mills
and Nestle will attack. So we sold it," said Bob Rogerson,
Ranks Hovis finance director.</p>
<p>American cereal industry sources calculate that Ireland
has the biggest per-capital cereal consumption in the world,
at more than 15 pounds a year. Britain and Australia are tied
for second, at nearly 13 pounds each, followed by the U.S.
with almost 10 pounds a person. While its population eats
more cereal on a per-capita basis than the U.S., the United
Kingdom is a much smaller market as measured by sales.</p>
<p>The U.S. is about a $6.5 billion market, while the U.K. is
about $1 billion, and all of Europe accounts for less than $2
billion in annual sales. For now, the venture's distribution
won't include Ireland, officials said.</p>
<p>Although the European market is relatively small, both
partners in the venture see considerable growth potential,
particularly after trade barriers fall in 1992. Nestle
already has a cereal business in France, Spain and Portugal,
as well as a huge marketing and distribution network, but it
previously lacked a significant product mix.</p>
<p>Until now General Mills, the world's second-largest cereal
maker behind Kellogg, has been only a negligible factor on
the continent. It currently exports relatively small amounts
of Cheerios, Golden Grahams and Cinnamon Toast Crunch (its
most popular brand in Britain) to major supermarket chains as
well as Harrods, the London department-store outfit.</p>
<p>Both partners in the joint venture, CPW S.A., have said
they intend to reach $1 billion in sales by the year 2000.
CPW is headquartered in Morges, Switzerland.</p>
<p>The acquisition includes Shredded Wheat Co., with a plant
at Welwyn Garden City near London; Viota Foods, with a cereal
plant at Bromborough, England; and A.C. Fincken Ltd., with a
plant at Watford, England.</p>
