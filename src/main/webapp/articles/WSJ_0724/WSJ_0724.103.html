	<p class="article-leader">An investor group said it raised its stake in Syntech
International Inc. to 11.2% from 8.2% of the common
outstanding but maintained the purchase wasn't a prelude to a
takeover of the Reno, Nev., company.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the investor group, which includes John Simmet and his
closely held company, Simcote Inc., St. Paul, Minn., said it
holds 652,000 Syntech shares, including 265,000 shares
purchased between May 24 and last Thursday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I have no intentions," Mr. Simmet said from his home in
Mendota Heights, Minn. "It's basically a fun thing. It's an
investment." Syntech makes transaction-processing systems
used in government-sponsored lotteries.</p>
