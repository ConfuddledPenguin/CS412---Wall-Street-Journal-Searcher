	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices suffered their biggest setback in
six months as disappointing corporate earnings and other
worries took their toll on the market.
   An unsettled outlook for interest rates and inflation,
news of financial difficulties facing the largest guarantor
of student loans and waves of futures-related sell programs
also pressured share prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average
tumbled 56.44 points to 2904.70.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most of the damage was done early in the session as the
market picked up where it left off late Friday, when an
earnings-related slide thwarted the industrial average's
latest attempt to finish above 3000 and left the average with
a loss of 32.67.</p>
<p>In the first hour of trading, the Dow industrials tumbled
about 60 points as prices steadily eroded. Less than 20
minutes later, the 30-stock measure was down more than 105
points at what proved to be its session low.</p>
<p>The average then jumped more than 50 points within minutes
after the second wave of selling subsided, but the recovery
was short-lived and prices drifted below those levels until
just before the close.</p>
<p>Among broader measures, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index
skidded 6.30 to 355.31, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index tumbled 3.43 to 194.22 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index dropped 6.01 to 329.86.</p>
<p>Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,430 to 227 on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume swelled to
209,030,000 shares from 177,810,000 Friday.</p>
<p>The drop in the industrial average was the third largest
point decline this year and the largest since Jan. 22, when
it plummeted 77.45 points. The second-largest drop was
recorded Jan. 12, when it fell 71.46 points.</p>
<p>On the earnings front, the latest shock came from the
second-quarter report released by McDonald's late Friday. The
stock plunged 3 to 33 in Big Board composite trading of 4.2
million shares in the wake of the report; although net income
rose 10% from the year-earlier level, earnings per share of
59 cents didn't meet analysts' projections.</p>
<p>An increase in Japanese interest rates overnight put
additional pressure on the market, analysts say, as the move
cast further doubt over whether rates in the U.S. would be
likely to decline soon. Those concerns had surfaced last week
following news that June consumer prices rose 0.5%, which
stoked fears of renewed inflation.</p>
<p>Also, worries about debt problems in the economy
intensified following a report in this newspaper that the
Higher Education Assistance Foundation, the largest guarantor
of student loans, is facing a possible bankruptcy filing
unless it merges with another guarantor or receives other
federal aid. Student Loan Marketing Association, one of the
foundation's largest creditors, tumbled 4 1/8 to 49 7/8.</p>
<p>Amid all those developments, sell programs related to
stock-index arbitrage pummeled the market at midmorning as
index futures fell to discounts to the cash indexes. The
arbitrage trading, which involved the sale of baskets of
stocks and the purchase of futures contracts, resurfaced
periodically in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Utilities Average, which closed Friday at
its lowest level in 13 months, went down another 1.95 to
200.20. The average hasn't posted a gain in the past seven
sessions and has closed higher only twice in 15 sessions this
month.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Transportation Average hit its lowest level
since late June by retreating 23.18 to 1136.13. Among its
component issues, airline and air-freight stocks were
especially hard hit; USAir Group fell 1 1/8 to 23, Alaska Air
Group lost 1 to 21 1/2 and Airborne Freight fell 7/8 to 25.</p>
<p>The earnings report from McDonald's -- one of the many
consumer stocks to benefit over the past few months from a
focus on issues viewed as most likely to deliver earnings
growth -- came on the heels of a series of disappointing
results last week for technology companies, another market
favorite for some time.</p>
<p>Taking those reports together, "The growth stock mystique
has been pretty well destroyed," said Michael Metz, chief
market strategist at Oppenheimer & Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Metz said the market's steep drop on the heels on its
late sell-off Friday represents "a really traumatic blow to
confidence" from which investors will need time to recover,
making an immediate rebound unlikely.</p>
<p>"You're going to have a market that is risk-averse and
gun-shy, at least for the next few weeks," Mr. Metz said.
"Now that confidence has been shaken, you have a market where
there's no great conviction and there's a high degree of
anxiety."</p>
<p>While expressing greater confidence about the potential
for an immediate recovery, Eugene E. Peroni Jr., director of
technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.,
Philadelphia, said stocks have probably seen their highs
"over the next several weeks, and possibly over the next
several months."</p>
<p>Only two of the more than 80 Dow Jones industry groups
closed higher -- precious metals, traditionally a "safe
haven" for investors in uncertain periods, and trucking.</p>
<p>Among precious-metals stocks, Battle Mountain Gold gained
1/4 to 11 1/8, American Barrick Resources added 5/8 to 20
3/4, Newmont Mining advanced 1 3/8 to 47 and Placer Dome rose
3/8 to 16 3/4.</p>
<p>The trucking sector's rise resulted from a rally in
Consolidated Freightways, which gained 1 3/4 to 15 after
issuing its second-quarter earnings report. The company
reported a loss of $3.6 million, or 19 cents a share, but
analysts had generally expected a bigger loss.</p>
<p>Union Carbide gained 5/8 to 19 5/8 on 1.1 million shares.
The company reported net income of 81 cents a share for the
second quarter, down from $1.33 a year ago but near the upper
end of the range of analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>Texas Instruments, whose second-quarter earnings report
touched off the market's plunge late Friday, rose 1/2 to 33
5/8 after plummeting 5 7/8 in the prior session.</p>
<p>Storage Technology, another victim of heavy
earnings-related selling Friday, rebounded 5/8 to 26 3/8.</p>
<p>Kansas Gas & Electric climbed 4 5/8 to 24 3/8 after Kansas
City Power & Light began a $27-a-share takeover bid for the
company, along with an offer for three preferred-stock
issues. Kansas City Power dropped 7/8 to 31 1/2.</p>
<p>Kansas City Southern Industries gained 1 5/8 to 48 1/8. A
report in the newsletter "Mergers & Corporate Policy" quoted
a source as saying management is considering a plan to sell
an asset, most likely its railroad unit, and then take the
company private for $80 a share. The company declined to
comment.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 5.53
to 354.92. Volume totaled 17,170,000 shares.</p>
