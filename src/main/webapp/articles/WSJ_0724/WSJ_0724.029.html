	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Helped by strong domestic demand for passenger
cars, Japan's production of cars, trucks and buses edged up
0.9% in the first half of 1990 from a year earlier to a
record 6.7 million units, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers'
Association reported.
   In June alone, however, production dropped 1.0% from a
year earlier to 1.2 million units, the first year-to-year
contraction in three months. In May, production grew 10.8%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Vehicle production in the first half of the year as well
as June was supported strongly by domestic demand, the
association said. According to the report, domestic demand
grew 10.1% in the first half from a year earlier, largely
pushed up by a sharp increase in passenger car sales.</p>
