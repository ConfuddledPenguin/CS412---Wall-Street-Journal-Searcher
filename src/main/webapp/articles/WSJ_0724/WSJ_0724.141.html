	<p class="article-leader">Hawker Siddeley Group PLC, a British electrical and
mechanical engineering concern, said discussions to buy two
subsidiaries of UNC Inc., Annapolis, Md., were terminated
after failure to agree on a price.
   A Hawker Siddeley spokeswoman declined to say what price
range was discussed. She said that if successful, the move
would have been a "major acquisition" for the group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two subsidiaries, Airwork Corp. and Pacific Airmotive
Corp., are airplane engine overhaul and repair concerns.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said the company wants to increase its
presence in this industry. The purchase would have offered
Hawker Siddeley a foothold in the U.S. industry. It acquired
Standard Aero Ltd., a Canadian concern, last August for #53
million ($96.3 million).</p>
