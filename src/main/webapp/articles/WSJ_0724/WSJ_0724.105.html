	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For those who follow the ups and downs of
Donald Trump, there may soon be some new SEC-approved
securities. Call them Trump futures, though they don't yet
have a name.
   The new securities, currently in the process of being
hatched, would rise and fall with Mr. Trump's perceived
ability to satisfy potential claims arising from his 1988
sale of Resorts International to Merv Griffin.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Resorts, a gambling concern that later fell on hard times,
will be in U.S. bankruptcy court in Camden, N.J., today
proposing a plan of reorganization. The plan has the backing
of creditors and is expected to be confirmed by Judge
Rosemary Gambardella.</p>
<p>For the record, the plan would halve Resorts' debt to $435
million from $931 million. Creditors would receive about
three-quarters of the company's stock; Mr. Griffin, who would
remain as chairman and who would invest an additional $23
million in cash, would get 21.5%. This much, in the arcane
world of bankruptcy, is standard operating procedure.</p>
<p>But a novel feature of the plan "provides that a trust
will be established and funded to pursue for the benefit of
{Resorts creditors} all claims the debtors and their
affiliates may have against Donald Trump, Trump Taj Mahal
Associates L.P." and various Trump affiliates.</p>
<p>Holders of nearly $600 million of the company's debt
securities have argued that the sale of Resorts, and a
related transaction with Mr. Trump, constituted a fraudulent
conveyance -- in laymen's terms, that is, so weakened Resorts
as to leave it insolvent, leading to the company's
bankruptcy-law filing.</p>
<p>Under fraudulent-conveyance law, former shareholders of a
company can be ordered to return the cash they received for
their shares in these circumstances.</p>
<p>The reorganization plan, which is opposed by Mr. Trump,
transfers the purported causes of legal action against Mr.
Trump to a separate trust. Ten million units of the trust
will be distributed to Resorts creditors, and the value of
these units will consist of whatever settlement or award the
trust can win from Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>Marc Kirschner, an attorney for the creditors committee at
Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, says he expects that the units
will be tradable securities. "We have applied for a
`no-action letter' from the Securities and Exchange
Commission," meaning a letter stating that trading the units
wouldn't violate U.S. law.</p>
<p>"We believe they comply with applicable laws," he says.
"If we get the letter, they will be tradable securities."</p>
<p>It's uncertain who would make a market in this special
sort of Trump securities, but it's expected that somebody
would. "They wouldn't be listed. It would probably be some
sort of over-the-counter market," says Arthur Newman, a
Chemical Bank restructuring specialist hired to advise the
Resorts creditors.</p>
<p>"Creditors feel there is a very significant cause of
action which should yield a large return," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump declined to comment.</p>
<p>But an attorney for Mr. Trump says "Mr. Griffin structured
a takeover that piled on more debt. It's as clear as can be
that Griffin and not Trump was responsible for the financial
debacle at Resorts." Under the reorganization plan, however,
debenture holders would release Mr. Griffin from
acquisition-related claims.</p>
<p>To put some teeth into the trust, Resorts will endow it
with a litigation kitty of $5 million. And the trust has
hired lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, a heavyweight partner of Kaye,
Scholer, Fierman, Hays & Handler, to serve as trustee and to
spearhead any litigation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Trump and Resorts debenture holders have
been trying to negotiate a settlement. Both sides may have an
incentive for doing so now.</p>
<p>Currently, the creditors committee could approve any
settlement. But once Mr. Feinberg takes over as trustee, any
deal would need the approval of a majority of unit holders.
Both sides are thus likely to spend much more time and money
on the case if a settlement isn't reached fairly soon.</p>
<p>Creditors were once dreaming of collecting $100 million or
so, but that was before Mr. Trump's financial distress became
household news. Some people close to the matter now say the
litigation-related units could be worth a total of $20
million to $50 million (including any unspent portion of the
litigation kitty).</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, whatever his net worth, still controls hundreds
of millions of dollars in assets. But he is believed to be
using his troubles to his advantage. "He can argue that even
if we prevail, what do we have?" one creditor says. "That's
how talks have been going."</p>
<p>If the matter isn't settled out of court, it's anybody's
guess where the units will trade.</p>
<p>"They are clearly worth something, but I haven't figured
out how much," says William Teitelbaum, a Resorts debenture
holder and a member of the creditors committee.</p>
<p>"There are two issues. Is there a significant judgment
that can be won? It's my belief that there is. The real issue
is: Is it collectable? I haven't seen Trump's financial
statements."</p>
<p>Mr. Trump sold his controlling interest in Resorts stock
for $96 million; he also received roughly $60 million from
Resorts in exchange for terminating his management contract
with the company. And, in addition, Mr. Trump purchased back
from Resorts the then-unfinished Taj Mahal casino for $273
million in cash.</p>
<p>"What the bondholders have on their side is common sense,"
one bondholder claims. "Resorts was sold in November of 1988.
The deal put $325 million of additional debt on its books. By
June of '89 they were saying they couldn't make interest
payments." And six months after that, the company filed for
bankruptcy-court protection.</p>
<p>An additional possible claim is that Mr. Trump underpaid
for the Taj. However, given the Taj Mahal's uncertain state,
that claim is considered weaker.</p>
<p>One point in Mr. Trump's favor is that while
fraudulent-conveyance suits have been a hot topic, the area,
as it applies to modern leveraged buy-outs, is uncertain and
relatively new.</p>
<p>Another point is that $50 million of the money used to
purchase Mr. Trump's stock was invested by Mr. Griffin. Thus,
Mr. Trump could argue that this portion of the payment didn't
directly weaken Resorts.</p>
<p>If the units do begin trading and are offered cheaply,
bankruptcy specialists note that Mr. Trump might want to
acquire some and reduce his exposure.</p>
<p>"If they get cheap enough, I'll want to buy them," one
debenture holder says. "But I don't know what cheap enough
is."</p>
