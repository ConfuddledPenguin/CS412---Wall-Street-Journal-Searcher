	<p class="article-leader">Investors who thought they could just sit back and watch
the stock market coast ever higher got a rude shock
yesterday.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average's 105-point drop in the
first hour of trading showed once again how volatile stock
prices can be.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But many advisers say the average investor who is in the
market for the long term probably shouldn't rush to make any
changes based on a single day's events. "People are going to
come around to the view that the less often they move money
around, the better off they'll be," John Bogle, chairman of
Vanguard Group, the big Valley Forge, Pa.-based mutual fund
company, says. "Extremes of optimism and pessimism may lead
you to do the wrong thing."</p>
<p>For the minority of aggressive traders who do make changes
based on daily market moves, some Wall Street strategists say
this could be the time to lighten up a bit. "This is not
something that's going to be over in a few days," Byron Wien,
U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley & Co., says.</p>
<p>At the same time, however, he says this isn't "the
beginning of a bear market. It's only a correction of 10% or
less, and we are already at least one-third of the way
through it." Bargain-hunters may want to look for buying
opportunities "among stocks that have been destroyed in the
last week or so, where the problems are temporary."</p>
<p>Other market pros advise aggressive investors to run
against the herd. "Wall Street is manic-depressive," Michael
Metz, chief market analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., says. "Try
to capitalize on both sides. Sell when it's manic, and buy
when it's depressed."</p>
<p>Philip Hummer, a partner at Wayne Hummer & Co., says many
of that Chicago brokerage and money management firm's clients
would do well to use the market drop as a buying opportunity.
Many of them have only 10% of their investment dollars in
stocks, preferring the greater stability of fixed-income
investments, he says. Yet over the past several decades,
stocks have far outpaced the alternatives and delivered
average returns of about 10% a year.</p>
<p>Dennis Gurtz, a Washington financial planner, agrees that
shareholders unnerved by the stock market's gyrations should
try to focus on the historical trend. "They should just
remember why they bought what they bought to begin with --
for the long-term growth," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Gurtz generally recommends that investors buy into the
stock market in regular installments over time, a strategy
called dollar cost averaging. He says investors might want to
accelerate some of their buying if the market continues to
slide in the near term.</p>
<p>The reasons for yesterday's market decline included higher
interest rates in Japan, lower-than-expected earnings late
Friday at big companies such as Texas Instruments Inc. and
McDonald's Corp., and the realization that the industrial
average mightn't soon break through 3000 points, after all --
a level at which some traders had planned to sell.</p>
<p>Vanguard's Mr. Bogle notes that even after yesterday's
decline, the stock market remains expensive by a number of
historic yardsticks, including ratios of price to dividends,
to earnings, and to book value.</p>
<p>For the past 60 years, he says, the Standard & Poor's 500
stock index has sold for an average dividend yield of 4.5%,
an average 13.9 times the past 12 months' earnings, and 1.6
times book value, or assets minus liabilities. Yet even after
yesterday's decline, he says, the market's price level
remained higher by all three benchmarks -- at a 3.4% yield,
16.1 times the past 12 months' earnings, and 2.5 times book
value. The lower current yield number means the price is a
higher multiple of the current dividend.</p>
<p>Still, for investors who have thought through how much of
their assets should be in stocks for the long haul, pulling
out isn't a good idea, some market advisers say, because they
would run the risk of missing the next big market upsurge.
And historically, the bulk of stocks' extra returns have come
in short, unexpected bursts, the pros note.</p>
<p>"Your first reflex may be to push the sell button," John
Markese, director of research for the American Association of
Individual Investors in Chicago, says. But "that doesn't make
any sense at all," he says.</p>
<p>Over time, Mr. Markese says, such market swings should
cancel out.</p>
