	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Debt-laden Time Warner Inc. posted a
second-quarter loss of $189 million after interest payments
and dividends, while operating profit declined in magazines
and book publishing and rose only modestly in recorded music
and at the Home Box Office unit.
   Time Warner's operating cash flow -- the figure the
company views as the best measure of its performance before
deducting expenses related to its recent merger and
approximately $10.6 billion in debt -- rose only 3.3% in the
quarter, to $536 million. Operating profit actually fell 1.1%
from a year earlier, to $268 million; that figure is pretax
earnings before paying interest and after deducting
depreciation and other merger-related items.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Time Warner's results, as expected, continue to be hurt by
the cost of paying for the former Time Inc.'s acquisition of
Warner Communications Inc. And the combined company's debt
actually inched upward in the second quarter, rising by about
$100 million as the company acquired Lane Publishing Co. and
made other, smaller investments.</p>
<p>Total revenue in the quarter rose a scant 4% to $2.59
billion from $2.48 billion in the year-earlier period, whose
results have been restated as if the merger had already been
in place. Time Warner's loss of $189 million, or $3.29 a
share, compared with a similar loss of $3.32 a share for the
year-earlier period. The loss comes after the company paid
$138 million in dividends on preferred used to complete the
merger. Without the dividends, the loss would have been $51
million, a figure that the company insists is the better
measure of its quarterly finances.</p>
<p>First Boston Corp. analyst Jessica Reif said the
second-quarter numbers were unimpressive and slightly below
her expectations -- and would have been even worse but for a
$15 million dividend that Time Warner received from its stake
in Turner Broadcasting System Inc. She worries that
Entertainment Weekly, budgeted at a $35 million loss for this
year, is likely to run a deficit of $50 million.</p>
<p>Emanuel Gerard of Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co., an
institutional research firm, said Time Warner is more likely
to disappoint investors with earnings downturns than to
delight them with upside surprises in the next two years.
"The only thing that will make this stock go up is a
financial event, a major asset sale at a price that blows
everyone away," said Mr. Gerard, who is a former executive of
Warner.</p>
<p>Yet Time Warner so far has stuck to its pledge, made when
the merger was announced, that it won't sell off any major
operations. Despite the mixed results, company executives
said in a statement that they were "pleased with the
continued strength and contributions that each of our
businesses is making to the growth of Time Warner."</p>
<p>Time Warner's results were hurt by a profit decline of 15%
in magazines, which included a $12 million loss in the
quarter on the new publication Entertainment Weekly. Profit
fell a sharp 56% in book publishing, reflecting the absence
of income from Scott Foresman, the unit that was sold late
last year. But even excluding Scott Foresman, results were
only flat.</p>
<p>Profit was up only 5% in music and 6% at the HBO cable
channel but a strong 23% in the Warner Bros. movie division
and 18% in cable systems. Cable profits, however, rose
largely on acquisitions of local systems.</p>
<p>For the first half, the loss was $376 million or $6.54 a
share, compared with a restated $406 million loss, or $7.15 a
share. Included are $274 million in dividend payments in the
most recent period and a similar amount a year earlier.
First-half revenue rose to $5.33 billion from $5.03 billion.</p>
<p>Time Warner common closed at $93, down $1.875 in a
similarly declining market overall, in composite trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. The company's preferred had a
smaller decline, with the most watched issue, the D series,
falling 37.5 cents to $42.</p>
