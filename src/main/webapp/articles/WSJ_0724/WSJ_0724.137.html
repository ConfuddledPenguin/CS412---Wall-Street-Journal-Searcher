	<p class="article-leader">LYNDHURST, N.J. -- Curtiss-Wright Corp. said
second-quarter net income climbed 6.7% to $7.2 million, or
$1.45 a share, reflecting higher margins in the company's
aerospace segment.
   Revenue rose 8.9% to $56.5 million from $51.9 million a
year earlier. The company, which makes precision parts used
in aerospace, flow-control and other industrial applications,
had net in the year-earlier quarter of $6.8 million, or $1.36
a share. The year-earlier figures were restated to reflect
the cumulative effect of an accounting change.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The profit would have been greater except for losses at
the company's flow control and marine segment after a
"modest" profit in the first quarter, Curtiss-Wright said.
"The short-term situation in the area of highly engineered
valves remains unsettled," the company said. Despite winning
a number of Navy orders, the available number of orders has
shrunk to their lowest level in a a decade or more, the
company said.</p>
<p>In the first half, net fell 26% to $11.6 million, or $2.32
a share, from $15.8 million, or $3.16 a share. The decline
reflects recognition of losses in short-term equity
securities, accelerated amortization of nonrecurring non-cash
charges in the first quarter and an upward restatement of
1989 first-quarter earnings. Revenue rose 5.1% to $109.5
million from $104.2 million.</p>
