	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. said negotiations to
sell its Maine National Bank unit ended because potential
bidders, who weren't identified, wouldn't agree to pay an
"acceptable" price for the unit.
   Bank of New England said it will continue to own and
manage the bank as part of its regional franchise. The sale
had been planned as part of a series of asset sales by the
troubled bank holding company as it tries to stem losses and
reduce debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bank's "recovery is proceeding," said Lawrence K.
Fish, chairman and chief executive officer. "We're making
slow but steady progress on a number of fronts, and we feel
the conditions are such that it is best to maintain the Maine
National Bank franchise."</p>
<p>Among those believed to have been interested in acquiring
the Maine bank was Fleet/Norstar Financial Group Inc.,
Providence, R.I.</p>
<p>Bank of New England said in April that it would seek to
sell its banking subsidiaries in Maine and Rhode Island.</p>
<p>Gerard Cassidy, an analyst with Tucker, Anthony, said the
planned sale of Bank of New England's Maine National Bank
unit was an "important but not critical" part of the parent's
restructuring program. "The major thing for Bank of New
England is to reduce nonperforming assets," he said. "Maine
National is not bleeding to death, so {the parent} must have
decided, `Why sell it at a fire sale price?'"</p>
