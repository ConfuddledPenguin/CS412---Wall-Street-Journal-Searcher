	<p class="article-leader">The savings and loan debacle may spell ruin for scores of
developers and financiers, but for the white-crowned pigeon,
it means a new lease on life.
   A few years ago, the shy, dark gray bird was threatened by
aggressive real estate developers, who were advancing
steadily on its only U.S. habitat in the Florida Keys. One
nesting ground -- a 63-acre palm grove -- was surrounded by
two shopping plazas and a subdivision, and investors were
eager to develop it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But now, thanks to the thrift bust, the birds will be
encouraged to stay. The bank holding the grove, American
Savings & Loan of Knoxville, Tenn., collapsed in 1984,
allowing federal regulators to sell the land four years later
to the Florida Keys Land Trust, a conservation group.</p>
<p>Across the country, nature lovers are claiming land that
once faced certain development but now sits on Uncle Sam's
auction block. Sometimes the property shelters endangered
plants or animals. In other cases, it is the beach or vacant
lot that local governments can finally afford to turn into a
public park. Little wonder that some see the bust as nothing
short of divine retribution.</p>
<p>The collapse "was an inevitable result of the rampant
greed of the mid-'80s," says Tim Jones, a member of Earth
First], a radical environmental group. "The benefits that
we're getting now are our just deserts."</p>
<p>Not all conservationists are pleased with the way the
thrift cleanup is proceeding, though. Critics complain that
the Resolution Trust Corp., the federal agency chartered to
fix the problem, is focusing too much on the bottom line in
its rush to unload assets and too little on environmental
impact. They also worry that the RTC is too disorganized to
figure out which plots may be crucial to wildlife.</p>
<p>"They're disposing of properties in urban areas the same
way they're dealing with environmentally significant ones,"
says an Environmental Protection Agency official. "You don't
manage a condo the way you'd manage a wetland."</p>
<p>But for groups that can scrape together the money, now is
a good time to invest in Mother Nature. Federal bailout
managers already hold more than 2,500 pieces of undeveloped
land, some covering thousands of acres, and that total is
expected to climb to as many as 4,000 tracts. Although the
proportion of environmentally valuable property is believed
to be slight -- perhaps just 3% -- it's a big deal to
conservationists.</p>
<p>The key to dealing successfully with regulators, say those
who have done it, is being able to put down cash up front. In
the case of the Florida Keys Land Trust, that meant
soliciting $1.4 million from everyone in the Keys -- right
down to elementary schoolchildren, who trick-or-treated for
penny and nickel contributions.</p>
<p>Charles Olson, who negotiated the deal for the land trust,
says regulators said they were sympathetic but pushed for
more money. "I remember a lot of times hearing, `Look, we
like what you're doing, we think it'd be great. But that
doesn't matter. We just want a good business deal for the
taxpayer.'"</p>
<p>In East Texas, the state Parks and Wildlife Department
transformed 3,000 acres of RTC-owned marsh into a wildlife
preserve. Three real estate brokers had bought the tract,
called Big Lake Bottom, in 1983. But when they still owed
about $1.25 million three years later, they deeded the land
back to their bank, which was eventually taken over by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The department, spotting an
opportunity, picked up the land for about $625,000 and set it
aside as a prime duck habitat.</p>
<p>Some people have even grander plans. Frank and Deborah
Popper, two Rutgers University academics, have proposed to
transform the Great Plains' prairies into a vast buffalo
refuge, dubbed the "Buffalo Commons." Under the couple's
plan, buffalo and other wildlife would gradually reclaim the
drought-plagued lands being abandoned by farmers and oilmen.</p>
<p>The large RTC presence in states like Texas and Colorado
is "another building block for the Buffalo Commons that's
already in place," says Mrs. Popper, who argues that any
prairie land the RTC can't sell, along with property
resulting from foreclosures by the Farmers' Home
Administration, should go to the buffalo.</p>
<p>But such schemes draw exasperated sighs from regulators.
"We are trying to be as responsive as we can to them," says
RTC spokesman Steve Katsanos. But he adds: "The mandate we've
been given is to get as much money as we can for the
taxpayers."</p>
<p>Despite some legislators' attempts to include strong
environmental guidelines in the thrift bailout legislation
last year, the law merely admonishes the agency to identify
properties with "natural, cultural, recreational or
scientific values."</p>
<p>Conservationists are particularly disappointed by the
regulators' failure thus far to help set aside a 70,000-acre
tract of land near Austin, Texas. The land, owned by a mix of
developers, banks, homeowners and regulatory bodies, houses a
veritable "Twelve Days of Christmas" assortment of threatened
animals: two rare songbirds, five endangered cave
invertebrates, a couple of endangered plants and some newly
discovered salamanders.</p>
<p>Through legal threats and public protests, environmental
groups have halted most tree cutting in the area. A meeting
on the site between environmentalists and RTC officials is
scheduled for the fall.</p>
<p>Things have gone more smoothly in Garland, Texas, which is
converting a 34-acre, lakeside tract into a park. The city
had wanted to buy the tract in the mid-80's but was scared
off when a local housing boom drove the price to $5 a square
foot. A developer snapped up the land instead and set about
building townhouses.</p>
<p>But around the time foundations and utility lines were
being laid, the real estate market went bust and so did the
developer and its lender, Independent American Savings
Association. That allowed the Trust for Public Land, a
national nonprofit conservation group based in San Francisco,
to snap up the tract from regulators. The group, which buys
properties to get them off the market while communities
arrange to purchase them, then sold the tract to Garland for
just $1 a square foot.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Monterey Peninsula Regional Parks District
in California now owns a beach once scheduled to be a
freewheeling investor's condo complex. Developer Leonard Levy
had used the 90-foot strip of shore as collateral to borrow
millions for a leveraged buy-out of a maker of
computer-assisted design systems. When the company filed for
bankruptcy-court protection from creditors, the lender
collapsed too. The FDIC seized the bank, obtained title to
the beach property and sold the land to the parks district
for a mere $75,000.</p>
<p>Even when nobody buys the RTC property, the slow sell-off
process cheers nature lovers. A few years ago, the Nature
Conservancy, a private group that buys land to protect it,
watched with dismay as investors snagged a patch of barrier
island forest off Nags Head, N.C., and began planning
clustered homes on the land, which teems with such wildlife
as otters and rainbow snakes.</p>
<p>Then the S&L crisis bankrupted the investors' thrift,
Great Atlantic Savings and Loan, and the RTC claimed the
forest. As far as the Nature Conservancy knows, nobody else
is interested in the land, giving the group time to negotiate
a deal for it.</p>
<p>And in Addison, Texas, a two-acre lot has languished in
regulatory hands for at least six years. But neighbors in
this Dallas suburb are grateful. They have cleared litter
from the lot to create a makeshift softball diamond and park.</p>
<p>"Besides that place," says area resident Jerry King,
"there's not a lot of wide open spaces around here just for
kids to walk and run and throw a frisbee."</p>
