	<p class="article-leader">Second-quarter earnings increased at Exxon Corp., while
profits declined at two other major oil companies, Amoco
Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co.
   Overall, oil companies registered sharply higher
profitabililty in their gasoline refining and marketing
businesses in the quarter. Results from oil-production
operations were mostly lower as crude prices declined, and
the petrochemicals business also remained in the doldrums.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unusually long maintenance turnarounds at some refineries
helped reduce inventories and keep product prices high. Also,
a sharp drop in the price of crude oil, the raw material from
which refined products are made, "gave a boost to product
prices as well," said William Brown III, oil analyst for
Kidder Peabody & Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown and other analysts predict, however, that the
strong refining margins of the second quarter will decline
this quarter, leaving major integrated oil companies with
flat to lower results.</p>
<p>Exxon missed out on the second-quarter profit runup in the
refining and marketing side of the business, despite an
overall increase in earnings. As other companies reaped
profits from this sector, one of Exxon's major refineries was
closed for an unexpectedly long time, and two others were
idled for routine maintenance. An Exxon spokesman said that a
portion of the decline could be blamed on the closures, but
he declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Exxon's large Bayway refinery in New Jersey was closed for
several months. In January, a break in an underwater pipeline
there dumped more than 500,000 gallons of oil into New York
Harbor, and several other incidents at the Bayway docks
prompted Exxon officials to close the facility for an
internal study of the operation in addition to scheduled
maintenance. Refineries in California and Texas were also
down for planned maintenance in the period.</p>
<p>Exxon said profit rose to $1.1 billion, or 87 cents a
share, from $140 million, or 11 cents a share, a year
earlier. The 1989 figure includes an $850 million provision
to cover cleanup of the giant Alaskan oil spill. Earnings
before the provision were $990 million, or 78 cents a share.
Revenue increased 10% to $26 billion.</p>
<p>Refining and marketing operations overseas were especially
profitable, with earnings climbing to $498 million from $141
million.</p>
<p>Amoco, based in Chicago, said net fell 24% to $379
million, or 75 cents a share, from $497 million, or 96 cents
a share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a gain
of $471 million from a settlement with Iran that was offset
by a $477 million charge for expected environmental clean-up
costs, mostly in the company's gasoline refining and
marketing business. Revenue rose 9.4% to $7.45 billion from
$6.81 billion.</p>
<p>Because of the environmental costs, Amoco had a $125
million loss in refining and marketing. Without the charge,
the company's refining sector's profit rose to $292 million
from $213 million because of higher margins and sales.
Chemical results declined because of lower prices and charges
for environmental remediation.</p>
<p>Oil prices that were more than $2.50-a-barrel lower than a
year earlier sharply reduced U.S. exploration profits, to $82
million from $143 million. Exploration and production results
were also hurt by higher expenses overseas and unfavorable
currency effects.</p>
<p>Arco net fell 16% to $391 million, or $2.36 a share, from
$467 million, or $2.66 a share, a year earlier, as record
refining profits weren't enough to offset lower exploration
and production results. Revenue declined 6.9% to $4.04
billion from $4.33 billion.</p>
<p>The company, based in Los Angeles, said the average price
it received for domestic crude fell $3.57 a barrel to $10.61
in the quarter. Natural gas prices also fell. As a result,
exploration and production profit dropped to $96 million from
$229 million.</p>
<p>But Arco's refining and marketing results nearly doubled
to $175 million from $91 million because of strong gasoline
prices and the lower oil prices.</p>
<p>In addition, Arco increased its first-quarter net income
$45 million, or 27 cents a share, to $592 million, or $3.55 a
share. Because of an unusual accounting situation arising
from Arco's equity investment in Lyondell Petrochemical Co.,
the Securities and Exchange Commission advised Arco to
recognize some dividend income differently.</p>
<p>The wide refining margins boosted earnings for Ashland Oil
Inc., almost exclusively a refiner and marketer, to a record
$100 million, or $1.79 a share, in the third quarter ended
June 30, more than double the year-earlier $43.5 million, or
78 cents a share. Sales rose slightly to $2.24 billion from
$2.21 billion.</p>
