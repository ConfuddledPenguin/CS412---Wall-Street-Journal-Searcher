	<p class="article-leader">Telefonica de Espana S.A. said net income surged 28.5% in
the first half of 1990 to 42.01 billion pesetas ($417.8
million) from 32.69 billion pesetas a year earlier.
   The company said that a 7.3% rise in service charges
helped bolster profits in the first half of 1990.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Telefonica's general director, German Ancochea, called the
company's first-half performance "reasonable" in light of a
"sluggish" first quarter, before higher service charges took
effect.</p>
<p>Mr. Ancochea noted that the company is negotiating with
the government to establish a pricing framework designed to
guarantee Telefonica a stable income. The formula, pegged to
Spain's inflation rate, would enable the company to finance
its investment plans through earnings.</p>
<p>The telecommunications monopoly reported a 38.6% jump in
financing costs, reflecting Bank of Spain's tight credit
restrictions.</p>
<p>Financing costs stood at 68.47 billion pesetas in the
first six months of the year, compared to 49.40 billion
pesetas a year earlier.</p>
