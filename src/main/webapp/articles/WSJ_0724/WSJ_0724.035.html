	<p class="article-leader">SAGINAW, Mich. -- The 1988 Republican presidential
campaign, safely tucked away in the trundle beds of memory
just about everywhere, is still causing restive nights here
in Michigan.
   For 17 months of elections, caucuses, conventions, court
fights, bickering and threats, the state's Republicans turned
against themselves in a savage blood feud. Grown men threw
ferocious tantrums at the doors of party meetings. Elderly
women in wheelchairs slugged opponents in the nose. Hardly
anyone knew what they were fighting about, but the conflict
between the establishment forces of George Bush and the more
activist, populist legions of Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson
became a symbol of the struggle over the character of the
GOP.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now that battle is entering another phase, spilling over
onto the Aug. 7 Republican primary to select a challenger to
face Democratic Sen. Carl Levin in November. With many wounds
still unhealed, Michigan's weary GOP voters must choose
between Rep. Bill Schuette, a modern version of the old-guard
Midwestern Republican, or Clark Durant, who speaks the new
mantra of entrepreneurism and market choices.</p>
<p>"These," says Brooks Patterson, who was Mr. Bush's
campaign co-chairman in Michigan in 1988, "are two
Republicans who represent two views of the party."</p>
<p>Mr. Schuette is the favorite, but there are too many
variables in a midsummer primary, being held at a time when
many of the GOP voters are more interested in tanning lotion
than tax policy, to be certain of the outcome. With a
dedicated band of -- this is not too severe a word --
zealots, Mr. Durant is giving Mr. Schuette a lesson from the
millions of automobiles that still are produced in this
state: Objects in the mirror may be closer than they appear.</p>
<p>Mr. Schuette is proceeding cautiously, emphasizing his
support from the GOP establishment. He has the backing of
county chairmen in 61 of the state's 83 counties and the
support of 51 of the 70 Republicans in the state Legislature.
He has the endorsement of the National Association of
Homebuilders, the National Federation of Independent
Businesses, the American Medical Association, the American
Bankers Association and the Michigan Farm Bureau.</p>
<p>The Schuette strategy is to act as if Mr. Durant doesn't
exist. "We've made this a Bill Schuette-Carl Levin race," Mr.
Schuette says. "My gunsights are right on Carl Levin."</p>
<p>Mr. Durant, however, has taken direct aim at Mr. Schuette.
"The choice is a status-quo, conventional, establishment
Republican or an opportunity-oriented populist," he says.
"The party is going to have to make this decision sometime."</p>
<p>The other night, when a questioner at a candidates' forum
in the Detroit suburbs blamed the Democrats for the
high-spending ways of Washington, Mr. Durant interrupted:
"We're both guilty."</p>
<p>Last week, Mr. Durant began a new offensive designed to
underscore his status as an outsider. The charge: Mr.
Schuette "voted along with the pack" and supported the
savings-and-loan bailout, which Mr. Durant described as one
of those typical Washington "giveaways."</p>
<p>The counter-charge: Mr. Durant invested more than $50,000
in a Texas thrift. "Here's a guy who's totally against the
S&L bailout and yet he invested money in a Texas S&L that got
$1.3 billion in government tax write-offs," says Douglas
McAuliffe, the Schuette campaign director.</p>
<p>The response: "I put some savings in a bank because I
wanted a good return," Mr. Durant says. "I didn't cost the
taxpayer anything. He cost them billions with his vote."</p>
<p>Mr. Durant has been speaking his anti-government idiom for
years; in 1976, in an act of political apostasy, he supported
Ronald Reagan against Michigan's own Gerald Ford. When
President Reagan appointed him chairman of the Legal Services
Corp., he tried (unsuccessfully) to cut its budget sharply
and trim its purview. He helped salvage the bankrupt Ann
Arbor Railroad, a state-owned and state-subsidized, 47-mile
spur from Ann Arbor to Toledo, Ohio, transforming it, he
tells campaign audiences, from "a tax user to a tax payer."</p>
<p>But he is best known in Michigan for refusing to defect
with the Kemp forces who in early 1988 abandoned an alliance
with Pat Robertson and went with George Bush. Mr. Durant, a
national co-chairman of the Kemp campaign, clung to what he
called the "Anybody But Bush" effort. "Clark is the last of
the believers," says John Buckley, who was press secretary to
the Kemp campaign.</p>
<p>Many of the novices who swarmed into politics in the
Robertson campaign now have drifted into the Durant camp.
"This isn't the Robertson campaign reborn, but it's the kind
of campaign that a lot of the Robertson people feel
comfortable in," says Marlene Elwell, a principal Robertson
organizer who isn't involved in the 1990 Senate primary.</p>
<p>The 36-year-old Mr. Schuette, a rather conventional figure
who would melt easily into the crowd at a Bush fund-raiser in
any downtown hotel, may have erred in permitting himself to
become the issue rather than his opponent, who is often
regarded as a quirky iconoclast and a "bomb thrower," even by
his allies. The editors of the Monroe Guardian, a weekly
newspaper published in a blue-collar corner of southeast
Michigan, may have underlined Mr. Schuette's vulnerability
when they wrote in their endorsement of Mr. Durant that he
"appears to have a clear vision of what America should be,
while Schuette appears to have only a vision of himself in
office."</p>
<p>But Mr. Schuette isn't any bland Babbitt. "He's a
moderate," says Patrick Anderson, an ardent conservative who
is the former president of the Farmington Area Republican
Club, "but a good moderate." He's taking a gamble, moreover,
by relinquishing a safe seat in the northern half of
Michigan's Lower Peninsula covering the rolling farms, inland
lakes and small towns west of Saginaw Bay that spawned Thomas
E. Dewey and today is a patchwork of knotty-pine fishing
cottages, hunting lodges and chemical plants.</p>
<p>Mr. Schuette himself is the son of a Dow Chemical plant
manager and the stepson of a retired Dow chairman, and at age
31 he defeated three-term Democratic Rep. Donald Albosta, a
sugar-beet farmer, by 1,314 votes. Soon he became the House's
most outspoken voice for Michigan's dry edible beans, winning
his constituents' loyalty by closing a loophole that
depressed bean prices. By 1988, when he won with 73% of the
vote, he was campaigning as "Michigan's congressman" and soon
began describing himself at Lincoln Day dinners -- he spoke
at 25 in the first 90 days of 1989 -- as "a footsoldier in
Congress when Ronald Reagan made our revolution of ideas a
reality."</p>
<p>Mr. Schuette brags that he was "for George Bush before it
was cool" -- he supported Mr. Bush over Mr. Reagan in 1980 --
but he broke with the president this summer when Mr. Bush
indicated that tax revenues had to be part of a budget
agreement. "If you raise taxes, you turn the throttle off,
shut off the steam of the economy, and there will be no gas
for growth," he says.</p>
<p>But Mr. Durant, 41 years old, likes to say that while Mr.
Schuette supports "no new taxes," he supports even lower
taxes. "No new taxes is not a good enough answer," he says.
"We penalize labor, capital, savings, thrift and risk-taking,
and you can't compete with that."</p>
<p>Republicans hope, perhaps vainly, that the bitterness that
started with the first round of precinct-level elections that
kicked off the 1988 campaign four years ago will finally
dissipate after next month's primary. "Carl Levin is far more
liberal than the average Michigan resident," says GOP state
Sen. Richard Posthumus, who hasn't endorsed either man.
"Party people know that the destruction has to be kept under
control so we can talk about taxes and foreign policy in the
fall against a very vulnerable incumbent."</p>
