	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee, propelled by
fear of voter anger over the costly savings and loan crisis,
approved legislation aimed at investigating the causes of the
debacle and invigorating punishment of those responsible.
   The package of thrift-related measures passed by the
committee in a voice vote includes increased spending for
enforcement, new criminal penalties for fraud and the
creation of a national commission to determine the origins of
the S&L debacle and recommend solutions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An amendment offered by Rep. George Sangmeister (D., Ill.)
and approved by voice vote would require life sentences for
the kingpins in S&L fraud schemes.</p>
<p>The thrift measures were added to a broader anti-crime
bill that received final approval from the committee last
night. The Senate earlier this month approved its own package
of S&L legislation, which has similar goals but differs in
many specifics from the measures approved by the House panel.</p>
<p>The Bush administration has backed many of the
congressional proposals, but not all. For example, the White
House strongly opposes the creation of a bipartisan
investigative commission as an unnecessary new bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The House legislation would create new criminal offenses
for concealing assets from a receiver of a failed thrift and
for obstructing a government examination of a financial
institution. The bill would also authorize $153 million for
each of the next three years to hire more prosecutors and
agents devoted strictly to cases involving financial
institutions. That amount is $9.5 million a year less than
what the Senate approved.</p>
<p>These provisions reflect lawmakers' tendency to stress
that criminal activity caused many of the failures in the S&L
industry. Charging that the Bush Justice Department has moved
too slowly to investigate thrift fraud, Rep. Charles Schumer
(D., N.Y.), lead sponsor of the House measures, said, "It is
critical that the administration prosecute, convict and
punish those who committed crimes against the S&L industry."</p>
<p>Most law enforcement officials, however, contend that the
vast majority of thrift failures resulted from mismanagement,
lack of government supervision and loosening of industry
regulations by Congress in the early 1980s. Moreover,
whatever new criminal statutes Congress ultimately passes
won't apply retroactively to acts committed before the
sanctions are signed into law by the president.</p>
<p>On the civil side, the House legislation would give
prosecutors and bank regulators the authority to undo
fraudulent transactions by thrift executives. Under the bill,
S&L defendants would be barred from using the bankruptcy laws
as a shield from court judgments, and regulators could
prohibit "golden parachute" severance payments to thrift
executives.</p>
