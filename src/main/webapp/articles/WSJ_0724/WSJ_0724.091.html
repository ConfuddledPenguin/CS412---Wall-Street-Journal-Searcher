	<p class="article-leader">Your June 13 editorial "The Liberal Barrio" characterizes
the Los Angeles County redistricting lawsuit as simply a
liberal/conservative tug of war. You suggest that the
plaintiffs in Garza v. Los Angeles County and U.S.A. v. Los
Angeles County are seeking new elections in constitutional,
redrawn district boundaries to undermine the board's
conservative majority. You are mistaken.
   The issues are preserving the fundamental right to vote
and ensuring that election systems do not dilute Hispanic
voting strength. Filed by the Mexican American Legal Defense
and Educational Fund (MALDEF), the American Civil Liberties
Union and the U.S. Justice Department during the Reagan
administration, the lawsuits were tried concurrently.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On June 4, a federal judge ruled the supervisors had
intentionally and illegally gerrymandered district boundaries
to dilute the effectiveness of the Hispanic vote. When
drawing the county's five districts, the incumbents dispersed
Hispanics among several districts instead of leaving their
cohesive neighborhoods intact. As a result, Hispanics have
seen their votes canceled out by the votes of Anglos who,
because of gerrymandering, are the majority in every
district.</p>
<p>In more than 100 years, no Hispanic has been elected to
the board, even though Hispanics have always been a
significant portion of the county's population. Today, about
35% of all Angelenos are Hispanic. The powerful board, which
administers law enforcement, fire protection and health
services, controls a $10 billion budget and governs more than
eight million people.</p>
<p>Even after the district boundaries are redrawn, most
Hispanics in Los Angeles will never have the opportunity to
serve on this board. What Hispanics should have and what the
U.S. Constitution guarantees them is the opportunity to vote
in legally drawn districts where their votes have the same
value as everyone else's.</p>
