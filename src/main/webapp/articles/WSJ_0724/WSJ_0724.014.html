	<p class="article-leader">STAMFORD, Conn. -- General Signal Corp. reported a
second-quarter loss of $21.9 million, or $1.14 a share,
reflecting a $60 million charge on the divestiture of three
semiconductor businesses.
   In the year-earlier quarter, the maker of electrical
controls equipment posted a profit of $18.7 million, or 98
cents per share. Sales for the current quarter were $481.6
million, down from $488.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The $60 million charge, on a pretax basis, reflected the
shedding of three semiconductor businesses, which "have been
unprofitable and were not forecasted to grow in accordance
with targeted objectives," according to Edmund M. Carpenter,
chairman and chief executive officer. Mr. Carpenter observed
that "based on first-half order input and divestitures, we
feel very positive about second-half results." The
year-earlier quarter included a $3.1 million gain on the sale
of a defense unit.</p>
<p>For the six months, General Signal reported a loss of $1.6
million, or nine cents per share, against profit of $38.5
million, or $2.02 per share in the year-earlier period. Sales
declined to $952 million, from $966.9 million. The results
also included the $60 million loss and $3.1 million gain in
the respective periods.</p>
