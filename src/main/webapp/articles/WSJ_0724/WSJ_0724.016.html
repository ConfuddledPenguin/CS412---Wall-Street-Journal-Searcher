	<p class="article-leader">This clear, energetic and untendentious biography of D.H.
Lawrence by Jeffrey Meyers (Knopf, 446 pages, $24.95) is the
first in more than a decade and most welcome for its candid
narrative and new information about the novelist's childhood,
marriage, sexual life, health and always complex friendships.
Mr. Meyers's life of Hemingway was praised when it appeared
five years ago, and here again he has produced a readable,
scholarly biography that doesn't break its subject on the
wheel of some reductive thesis or bury him in self-serving
detail. Lawrence lives.
   The eloquent victim of the most famous Oedipus complex in
English literature, David Herbert Lawrence was the fourth of
five children of an illiterate Nottingham coal miner and a
snobbish would-be schoolteacher. As a young writer, he was
taken up by many of England's most prominent people (Bertrand
Russell, E.M. Forster, Ford Madox Ford, Katherine Mansfield,
Ottoline Morrell), but quarrelled with them all. During World
War I his fourth novel, "The Rainbow," was suppressed for
obscenity and he was expelled from Cornwall as a suspected
German spy (his wife, Frieda von Richthofen Weekley, was a
highly conspicuous German baroness, six years older than he,
whom he had stolen from his favorite professor at Nottingham
University). Lawrence spent the last 10 sickly years of his
life in perpetual motion through Italy, France, Germany,
Ceylon, Australia, the American Southwest and Mexico, and
died of tuberculosis in France in 1930 at 44. He had
published some 50 works and many more were to appear
posthumously.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Immensely difficult, sensitive, contentious and
self-contending, Lawrence was very much the self-proclaimed
"genius" -- novelist, poet, travel writer, critic,
correspondent, religio-psycho-political polemicist. Above
all, he was a great crusading modernist, a believer in
redemptive art and salvation through personal relations, who
declared the novel was "the one bright book of life" and the
novelist therefore "superior to the saint, the scientist, the
philosopher, and the poet, who are all great masters of the
different bits of man alive, but never get the whole hog."</p>
<p>Typically grandiose Lawrentian claims, and yet typically
qualified by his insight that since the novel was "the
highest example of subtle inter-relatedness that man has
discovered," any attempt to turn it into a sermon or a
treatise, to forsake art for doctrine, would fail: "If you
try to nail anything down, in the novel, either it kills the
novel, or the novel gets up and walks away with the nail." So
readers should, "Never trust the artist. Trust the tale."
It's a rare prophet who cries caveat emptor.</p>
<p>Lawrence's authentic genius was such that it's impossible
to reduce his best works to our last reading of them: they
keep changing each time through -- they shoot us from one
reaction to another: delight, outrage, fatigue, admiration,
impatience. His pronouncements about a coming Manichean
"apocalypse" and our necessary submission to "dark phallic
power" have dated, to put it gently, but his best literary
works are still alive, asking questions, not delivering
answers, reading us as we read them.</p>
<p>Today his novels "Sons and Lovers," "The Rainbow" and
"Women in Love," and some of his stories and novellas, are
regarded as his strongest works. But his most famous novel
probably still is "Lady Chatterley's Lover," his 10th and
last, which was judged too obscene for publication in England
until 1960. A year after it was privately published in sunny
fascist Italy in 1928, Edmund Wilson forcefully argued that
it was art, not pornography, and that Lawrence was a heroic
figure: "D.H. Lawrence is indestructible: censored, exiled,
denounced, snubbed, he still possesses more vitality than
almost anyone else."</p>
<p>Although most of Lawrence's obituaries were hostile when
he died the following year, E.M. Forster, the doyen of the
Bloomsbury group that Lawrence had denounced as a swarm of
black beetles, praised Lawrence even more highly than Wilson:
"Now he is dead, and the low-brows whom he scandalized have
united with the high-brows whom he bored to ignore his
greatness. . . . All that we can do . . . is to say straight
out that he was the greatest imaginative novelist of our
generation." It took decades before such praise was
comprehensible. The English critic F.R. Leavis was ridiculed
for years for his high estimation of Lawrence.</p>
<p>Mr. Meyers has re-examined Lawrence's life as the origin
of his art. At times he may tend to simplify both somewhat,
but he has come up with new material and given a clear shape
to much of the old. In addition to evidence of Lawrence's
generosity, high spirits, wit, invigorating sensitivity and
passion for experience, we read about his social, sexual and
racial prejudices, his meddling and imperious way with
friends, his obsession with homosexuality as both a saving
grace and an abomination, his hatred of democracy, his
longing for a mighty dictator. Most of all we read about his
violent, exultant, dependent relationship with his wife,
Frieda, who carried on with half a dozen other men at various
times but nursed him to the end.</p>
<p>Mr. Meyers's biography successfully conveys that Lawrence,
who chose the phoenix as his personal symbol, did burn with a
brighter flame than most men. And even more unusual was that
he had the genius -- like Keats, another impassioned,
tubercular, working-class English writer -- to create great
works of literature before he was consumed.</p>
