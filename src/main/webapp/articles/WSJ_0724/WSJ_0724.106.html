	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- A last-minute, cost-cutting agreement reached
with unions at Irish Press newspapers paves the way for the
Ingersoll-managed group to restore the papers to a prime
position in Ireland, Ingersoll said.
   The group, Irish Press Newspapers Ltd., is 50% owned by
U.S. publisher Ralph Ingersoll's British company, Ingersoll
Publications Ltd. The remainder of the company is owned by
Irish Press PLC, which belongs to Ireland's de Valera family.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The group reached the agreement with the National Union of
Journalists and the Irish Print Union on Sunday, just before
it was to close down the Irish Press, Evening Press and
Sunday Press.</p>
<p>The settlement calls for 200 voluntary layoffs, an
immediate start to the use of new technology, and the
introduction of a basic five-shift, 35-hour workweek
throughout the company. Journalists have been working a
four-day, 28-hour week. The 750 workers had rejected the same
proposals on Thursday.</p>
<p>Ingersoll Publications, which bought a half-stake in the
newspaper group in December, also manages the newspapers.</p>
