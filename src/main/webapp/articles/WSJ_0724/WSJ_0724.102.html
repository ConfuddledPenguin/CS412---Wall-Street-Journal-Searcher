	<p class="article-leader">SCHAUMBURG, Ill. -- The value of mergers and acquisitions
proposed in the second quarter plunged 46%, despite a 12%
rise in the number of transactions, as the focus of activity
shifted to sell-offs of "mid-market price range" businesses,
a Merrill Lynch & Co. unit says.
   There were 626 M&A deals valued at $30 billion that were
initiated in April, May and June, compared with 561
transactions valued at $56.4 billion in the year-earlier
three-month period, according to W.T. Grimm & Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The megadeals of the 1980s are no longer the norm," says
Beth Rosencrans, research director at W.T. Grimm.</p>
<p>The value of corporate combinations proposed in the second
quarter also fell 13% from the $34.3 billion of transactions
begun in the first quarter, as the number of transactions
launched rose 6.8% from 584 in the first three months of the
year, W.T. Grimm says.</p>
<p>The total value of the 10 biggest transactions announced
in the first six months of 1990, $22 billion, is less than
half the value -- $55 billion -- of transactions announced in
the like 1989 period, W.T. Grimm says.</p>
