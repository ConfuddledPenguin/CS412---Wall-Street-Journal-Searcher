	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Amax Inc. posted a 57% decline in
second-quarter net income, reflecting a slide in aluminum
prices.
   Meanwhile, Asarco Inc.'s earnings were nearly flat, as
increases in lead, zinc and gold prices were offset by a
decline in copper prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Amax, an aluminum, gold and energy company, reported net
fell to $56.9 million, or 65 cents a share, from $130.9
million, or $1.53 a share, a year earlier. Operating profit
declined 44%, to $102 million from $181 million.</p>
<p>Sales fell 8.9% to $984.7 million from $1.08 billion.
Aluminum accounted for nearly two-thirds of Amax's total
sales. Amax said industry ingot prices declined about 26% but
added that the prices appear to have bottomed out.</p>
<p>Allen Born, Amax chairman and chief executive, said the
company was "encouraged" by its performance so far in light
of the continuing sluggish economy. The quarter's results
included several one-time items, whose net effect was an
after-tax gain of $6.1 million, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>The second-quarter results were slightly lower than
analysts had predicted. Vahid Fathi, an analyst with
Prescott, Ball & Turben in Cleveland, said in a phone
interview that 1989 was a record year for Amax earnings.</p>
<p>For the six months, earnings fell 56%, to $106.9 million,
or $1.22 a share, from $245.1 million, or $2.87 a share, a
year ago. Sales fell 7.3%, to $1.91 billion from $2.06
billion.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Amax shares fell 62.5 cents to $25.50.</p>
<p>Asarco, a nonferrous metals company that also has
interests in specialty chemicals, reported second-quarter net
of $50.2 million, or $1.21 a share, nearly flat with $50.8
million, or $1.20 a share a year ago.</p>
<p>Sales rose slightly, to $543.1 million from $539.3
million.</p>
<p>Richard de J. Osborne, chairman, president and chief
executive, said the results "reflect continued good market
fundamentals" for the primary metals Asarco produces.</p>
<p>Mr. Fathi said he doesn't believe the "strength in copper
is sustainable on a fundamental basis." The analyst said the
recent rise in copper prices, to $1.30 a pound, was a result
of disruptions in supplies by strikes and political unrest in
several copper-producing countries.</p>
<p>For the six months, Asarco posted a 28% decline in net, to
$86 million, or $2.07 a share, from $119.3 million, or $2.83
a share, a year ago. Sales fell about 8% to $1.06 billion
from $1.16 billion.</p>
<p>Asarco also said union members at its Ray unit in Arizona
overwhelmingly ratified a wage agreement. About 650 workers
struck the mine July 1 after the previous contract expired;
workers began returning to work last weekend.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Asarco shares also fell 62.5 cents to $27.50.</p>
