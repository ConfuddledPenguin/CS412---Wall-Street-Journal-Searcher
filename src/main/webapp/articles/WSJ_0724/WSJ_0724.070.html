	<p class="article-leader">St. Andrews, Scotland -- We Americans may no longer rule
The Golfe, but some of us have a neat way of putting things.
Asked last week what a British Open title at St. Andrews's
Old Course, the game's birthplace, would mean to him,
Missourian Payne Stewart, the beknickered dandy, did not
pause. "This is the original tournament played on the
original course," said he. "I don't know how you could get
any better than that."
   Nick Faldo, the Britisher who did win the thing before the
delighted home folks, was less original. Noting that he'd now
won four of golf's "majors" -- two of these and two Masters,
including last April's -- he resorted to quoting Jack
Nicklaus, who's won 18 of 'em. "Like Jack says, they're all
the same -- all fantastic," he declared. "Can't say one is
any better than the others."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Faldo is getting accustomed to golfing glory, and,
perhaps, its edges are beginning to blur for him. In an era
in which many men hit the little white ball very well, the
tall, patient 33-year-old with the metronome swing hits it
best. The unofficial but real title of world's best had been
in dispute for the past several years, but now it's his.
Given another inch or so, the margin by which he missed a
putt on the last green at the U.S. Open at Medinah in June to
fall a stroke short of a playoff spot, he might have had a
chance at a Grand Slam, with the PGA Championship to come.
That's something the game was thought to have outgrown.</p>
<p>Faldo has won the big ones with pars -- 18 of them on the
final day of the 1987 British Open at blustery Muirfield --
and with birdies. He did both here in unusually fine weather
last week, putting together the best 54-hole total in the 119
times they've held the tourney, then playing his patented
down-the-middle game in the final round Sunday to coast home.
His 72-hole score of 270 comprised rounds of 67, 65, 67 and
71, and was 18 strokes under par.</p>
<p>That was five shots better than Stewart and Mark McNulty
of Zimbabwe, who tied for second. McNulty came from well back
with a last-round 65, and, thus, never contended for the
lead. Stewart provided a whiff of Sunday drama by shaving
four strokes off par through 12 holes to move from five
strokes back to two. But he drove into one of St. Andrews's
nasty pot bunkers on 13 to give back a shot, and Faldo,
playing just behind him in the day's final twosome, birdied
the par-four 15th to stretch his lead to four.</p>
<p>From there, it was downhill for both men, with Faldo's
trip by far the more pleasant. His walk along the 18th
fairway, lined by many of the 40,000 people who paid their
way in plus hundreds more leaning from the windows and
balconies of the graystone buildings on the street that
parallels the hole, was a heady triumph for a Britannia that
has ruled little of late. Long after England's Fred Perry had
won three men's singles tennis titles at Wimbledon, they put
a statue of him on the grounds. One more Open crown for
Surreyman Faldo could get him bronzed, too, and quicker.</p>
<p>They also might like to bronze Faldo's scorecards from
this tourney. Over 72 holes he recorded 20 birdies, one eagle
and just four bogeys, three of them on the dreaded "Road
Hole," the 461-yard par four that bedeviled everyone. He
landed in only one bunker, missed just two greens in
regulation besides 17, and had no three-putt greens. The
latter achievement is especially noteworthy, because St.
Andrews's seven huge double greens make putts of 60 feet or
longer commonplace.</p>
<p>His 270-shot score was the second best in the tourney's
history, and the best in the 24 editions played at St.
Andrews. The last time anyone won two of golf's majors in the
same year was when Tom Watson captured the Masters and
British Open in 1977. Watson's 268 at Turnberry that year is
the record for the event.</p>
<p>Faldo wasn't the only player who laid waste to the proud
Old Course; the Open record for the layout fell on Saturday
to a 63 by Britisher Paul Broadhurst, and Australian Ian
Baker-Finch had a 64 the same day. The 36-hole cut was made
at one-under-par 143 -- the lowest ever for the event -- and
severed such luminaries as Seve Ballesteros, Curtis Strange
and defending champ Mark Calcavecchia. Fifty-six of the 72
men who survived broke par for 72 holes.</p>
<p>The onslaught raised the question of whether park-like St.
Andrews, with its wide fairways, has outlived its day as a
championship layout. The answer, usually, was that the
relatively gentle breezes of last week had defanged the old
links ("When the wind really blows here, the seagulls walk,"
quipped Faldo), but it sounded less than convincing.</p>
<p>If there was an individual loser, it was Greg Norman. The
jaunty Aussie, co-favored with Faldo going in, shot 66s on
each of the first two days to equal Faldo, but when the two
played together in Saturday's final twosome his game went
haywire and he posted a 76, with a 40 on the back nine. He
recouped somewhat for a 69 on Sunday, and a sixth-place tie,
but his failure to add to his sole major title -- the '86
British Open -- has become familiar. So, too, has his failure
to appear to answer news media questions after poor rounds.</p>
<p>Faldo, on the other hand, seems to grow under pressure,
and his Saturday round exemplified this. Of his 67 strokes,
only two went awry -- a drive that landed in a clump of
prickly gorse bushes on the 316-yard 12th hole, and a three
iron that fell short of the green on 17. Later admitting that
he was lucky to have any sort of second shot on 12, he
punched out, chipped to eight feet of the cup and saved par,
while Norman, perhaps relatedly, was missing a four-foot par
putt that would give him the first of his four bogeys on the
side.</p>
<p>Faldo bogeyed 17, but then smacked a wedge to two feet of
the flag on 18 to set up the birdie three that established
the five-stroke lead he would hold all the next day.</p>
<p>"It's not how many great shots you hit -- everybody out
here hits great shots. It's where your bad ones go," the
champ intoned.</p>
<p>Words worth framing.</p>
