	<p class="article-leader">Siemens AG, a West German electronics concern, said group
net profit in the first nine months of its fiscal year ending
Sept. 30, 1990, rose 4.7% to 1.14 billion marks ($694.7
million) from 1.09 billion marks in the year earlier period.
   The West German electronics concern said that group sales
in the same nine month period climbed 2.9% to 45.3 billion
marks from 44.0 billion marks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although Siemens didn't specify its third-quarter
earnings, based on available data, group net profits fell 11%
to 387 million marks from 433 million marks in the 1989 third
quarter.</p>
<p>Third-quarter group sales were down slightly as well,
easing 16% to 14.9 billion marks from 17.7 billion marks. But
a spokesman for Siemens said that the main reason for the
comparative weakness in the third quarter this year was due
largely to the receipt of some 4 billion marks for an atomic
energy plant in the 1989 third quarter.</p>
<p>Excluding the revenue generated from the power plant,
sales rose 13% in the group and 19% domestically in the third
quarter, Siemens said. The company said that although the
sales data can be adjusted for the power plant, no adjusted
earnings data would be made available.</p>
