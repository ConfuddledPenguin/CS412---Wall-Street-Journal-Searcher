	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Ford Motor Co. agreed to pay a $1.2 million
penalty to settle charges of failing to keep proper job
safety and injury records required by the Labor Department.
   Separately, the department's Occupational Safety and
Health Administration said the company agreed to establish a
program to reduce injuries caused by repetitive motion tasks
-- which often result from assembly line jobs -- at 96% of
its factories.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As part of its record-keeping agreement, Ford is required
to set up an audit system for workers' health records at 12
company facilities and, if the error rate is more than 5% at
any one plant or nationwide, it must retrain its
record-keeping staff.</p>
<p>The penalty results from the 1989 inspection of a Ford
Electronics & Refrigeration facility in Lansdale, Pa. OSHA
officials said the incident was the third time the company
was cited for record-keeping violations.</p>
<p>To help prevent repetitive motion injuries, the company
can change the design of its tools and workstations and use
mechanical devices to do excessive lifting. The United Auto
Workers Union, which represents Ford Workers, will partly
administer the program.</p>
