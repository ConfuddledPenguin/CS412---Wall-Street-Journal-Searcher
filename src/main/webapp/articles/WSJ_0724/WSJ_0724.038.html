	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Oryx Energy Co. said it made another discovery
in its horizontal drilling program in the Pearsall field in
South Texas.
   The well, the Lloyd W. Booth No. 1, tested at a daily rate
of 1,697 barrels of oil and 744,000 cubic feet of natural gas
through a 20/64-inch opening. Oryx said the well has a
horizontal displacement of 4,204 feet and produces through
intervals between 6,165 feet and 10,126 feet, which was the
