	<p class="article-leader">As Congress prepares to debate the renewal of the
controversial National Endowment for the Arts, in an
atmosphere electric with furor about obscenity, it seems
appropriate to take a dispassionate look at what the NEA does
and how it affects typical recipients. In other words, what
does the endowment do for the arts and how would its
elimination affect the arts public?
   Endowment grants are rarely large -- 89% are below $50,000
-- yet they are effective. During the 1980s, $237 million in
NEA challenge grants was matched by more than $2 billion in
private contributions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All this means that if the NEA were to disappear tomorrow,
our best-known arts institutions still would be around,
though a bit poorer. At New York's Metropolitan Museum, for
example, the endowment helps fund the temperature-control
system, a low-glamour necessity that doesn't attract
high-profile corporate donors.</p>
<p>The congressional debate could, however, profoundly affect
the future of the little guys and newcomers, namely the more
than 1,000 orchestras, opera companies, dance troupes and
others that sprouted up after 1965. The diversity of these
groups is self-evident. Here's a closer look at two NEA
recipients that arguably represent opposite ends of the
social/intellectual spectrum -- rural Appalshop Roadside
Theater and urban Franklin Furnace Archives Inc., an
avant-garde performance and exhibition space in New York.</p>
<p>On a sultry Saturday last month, some 3,000 Appalachian
hill folks descended on an old fort in tiny Nickelsville,
Va., for their third annual summer festival. There were hot
dogs and crafts booths and a spirited reenactment of the
Civil War. There also was an extremely polished presentation
of traditional mountain tales, punctuated by a lively chorus
of banjos and guitars, and lyrics that were pure hill: "And
Satan said, `I been the devil for all my life, but I never
seen hell 'till I seen your wife.'"</p>
<p>The tall tales and twangy tunes came courtesy of
Appalshop, an award-winning performance troupe based a couple
mountains away in the little mining town of Whitesburg, Ky.
For nearly 20 years, Appalshop has brought its flavorful
rendition of Theater Americana to rural hotspots like
Nickelsville, where there isn't a theater for miles. The
company also has dispensed hillbilly high culture in big
cities such as New York, San Francisco and even London.</p>
<p>Appalshop, which began life in 1969 as part of the War on
Poverty program, is Appalachia's biggest arts organization,
with an FM radio station, a documentary film company, a
record company and a theater, all under the roof of a neatly
renovated Whitesburg warehouse. With a full-time staff of 37,
it also is one of the biggest employers in economically
depressed Letcher County, where Whitesburg is situated. Not
surprisingly, Appalshop has a tight budget, with funds
cobbled together from the usual sources, including state arts
councils, foundations, private donations, ticket sales and
the NEA.</p>
<p>The beleagured endowment is by no means Appalshop's only
economic source. The NEA accounted for about 18% of the
organization's $1.6 million budget this year. But in some
ways, it is Appalshop's best source. "It's a credibility
factor," says Dee Davis, a Kentucky-born member of Appalshop.
"When people come down here and see what we do in context,
they're willing to support us. But if they can't do that, the
NEA is a way of proving to people that our work has merit."</p>
<p>Pretty patchwork quilts adorn the walls at Appalshop's
airy red brick warehouse, refurbished several years ago with
the help of a $10,000 NEA grant. Yet if the NEA suddenly
evaporated, Appalshop probably could limp along. "People
won't suddenly stop making music or telling stories down here
because there isn't any government money," says Ron Short, an
Appalshop actor and writer. Things would be tough, however.
With unemployment unofficially topping 50% and no big
corporations, Appalachia isn't bursting with local art
patrons or corporate donors. And despite Appalshop's
energetic efforts rounding up funds from foundations and
state arts councils, a loss of NEA cash infusions would
curtail activities, leaving locals even more dependent on
television.</p>
<p>In its fledgling days, Appalshop "wouldn't have had a
snowball's chance" without the NEA, says Mr. Davis. In the
1960s, the arts largely were an urban phenomenon. What the
NEA did was acknowledge less-mainstream art forms, like folk
art, and help them thrive, he says. "There's been an opening
up of the definition of the arts in this country, and without
the NEA, we may go back to the narrow patron-defined system
of arts."</p>
<p>From Appalshop's perspective, the one happy surprise to
come from the NEA imbroglio is a new infusion of sponsorship
interest. Given the current obsession with obscenity and art,
big foundations are cautiously choosing who to support. And
these days, Appalshop seems as wholesome and American as the
Stars and Stripes.</p>
<p>Things are different up north in New York, where Franklin
Furnace, a 15-year-old "alternative" space that presents and
preserves avant-garde art, is having trouble. Earlier this
year, the New York Fire Department deemed its basement
performance space a safety hazard and closed it, apparently
acting on a tip from someone who didn't like the show. Then
the U.S. General Accounting Office began investigating
Franklin Furnace performances by several artists, including
the now-famous Karen Finley, after complaints that their work
was obscene. And though Franklin Furnace has received NEA
grants regularly for years, its latest application is
languishing in the endowment's Grants Office.</p>
<p>Franklin Furnace, billeted in a no-frills storefront near
Chinatown, has raised eyebrows -- and hackles -- before, most
famously with its 1984 show "Carnival Knowledge," which
featured art by women in the pornography industry, including
ex-porn star Annie Sprinkle. "The work wasn't pro porn, but
we lost a couple of corporate sponsors over that," says
Barbara Pollack, a Furnace spokeswoman. But until its recent
notoriety, Franklin Furnace was known beyond art circles, if
at all, for launching the careers of Eric Bogosian,
motor-mouth star of the film "Talk Radio," and artist Jenny
Holzer, who represented the U.S. at this year's Venice
Biennale. The gallery also has an extensive collection of
avant-garde artists' books.</p>
<p>Like Appalshop, Franklin Furnace probably owes its early
existence to NEA largesse. During the 1970s, modest NEA
grants helped places like Franklin Furnace devote themselves
to work by young artists, particularly those outside the
mainstream. "This is the R&D of the art world," says Susan
Wyatt, director of Artists Space, a New York alternative
space. "The endowment has had a tremendous impact with very
tiny amounts of money."</p>
<p>The Furnace is specially known for presentations by solo
performers, the angry, noisy artists whose favorite props are
their own bodies and bodily fluids. Martha Wilson, director
of Franklin Furnace, sounds a bit shell shocked as she
defends her performers' work, which is misunderstood, not
obscene, she says. The chocolate syrup Ms. Finley smears on
her nearly naked body in her most celebrated performance is
there to show women as victims. It must be seen in context,
she explains. Ms. Wilson is particularly annoyed that Ms.
Finley's loudest critics have not actually seen her perform.
"They don't care why Karen Finley smears chocolate syrup on
her breasts," she says.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the NEA denied grants to four
performers, all Franklin Furnace alumni who had received
grants in previous years. Ms. Finley was among the
de-granted. "I am told I have the freedom to perform anywhere
I want as long as it's not with public money. Yet all of the
art spaces and museums across our country are publicly
funded."</p>
<p>That's the big concern at Franklin Furnace, where NEA
money accounts for between 5% and 10% of the $400,000 budget.
But the Furnace may have found a way out, through
conventional, but for it alternative, fund-raising methods.
It staged a successful $100-a-ticket benefit this month. The
approximately $17,000 raised will help keep Franklin Furnace
open if it loses its much-needed NEA grant.</p>
