	<p class="article-leader">BUSH SAID he will nominate appellate judge David Souter to
the Supreme Court.
   Just three days after liberal Justice Brennan resigned for
health reasons, the president selected Souter, a former New
Hampshire Supreme Court jurist, for his first appointment to
the nation's highest court. Bush, in introducing Souter at a
White House news conference, said he hadn't asked the
50-year-old judge's opinions on such key topics dividing
liberals and conservatives as abortion and civil rights.
Souter's name is believed to have been given to Bush by his
chief of staff, former New Hampshire Gov. Sununu.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Souter, though a conservative, lacks any reputation for
the kind of conservative judicial activism that aroused such
fierce opposition to Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork in
1987.</p>

<p>Aspin announced he'll join an effort to kill funding for
the B-2 bomber, representing a serious blow to Bush's effort

beyond those that are already in development.</p>

<p>The Bush administration told makers of six semiautomatic
assault-style rifles banned from import last summer that new
designs of the weapons conform to U.S. laws, according to the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. A bureau spokesman
didn't know if makers had sought import permits for any of
the new weapons.</p>

<p>All 79 opposition lawmakers quit South Korea's National
Assembly as the governments of South Korea and North Korea

to use relations with North Korea to divert the public from
domestic problems.</p>

<p>The House passed a bill requiring broadcasters to provide
children's television programming and to limit commercial

<p>Greece's parliament ratified a new defense treaty with the
U.S. that will allow two American military bases to remain on

U.S. bases following the expiration of a prior treaty.</p>

<p>Liberian rebel fighters waded across a swamp and shot

<p>West German Chancellor Kohl will meet East German Prime
Minister de Maiziere on Thursday to discuss a controversy

want a single election after the union.</p>

<p>A last-minute electrical glitch forced NASA to postpone

the rocket had switched over to internal power.</p>

trade-distorting export subsidies.</p>
