	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The bond market was whipsawed yesterday,
initially battered by rising interest rates abroad then
rebounding as U.S. stock prices plunged.
   Ultimately, the bond market ended unchanged to moderately
lower with the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond posting a
1/4 point decline, or a loss of $2.50 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It was a very volatile and choppy trading day," said
James Capra, senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc.</p>
<p>The bond market opened sharply lower with prices falling
as much as 3/4 point in reaction to rising interest rates in
Japan. Yields on Japan's benchmark 10-year bond rose to a
six-year high of 7.475% yesterday, even though Japan's
central bank tried to stabilize rates.</p>
<p>The increase in Japanese bond yields revived fears that
Japanese investors, traditionally big buyers of U.S. Treasury
bonds, may not participate aggressively in next month's
multibillion-dollar quarterly Treasury-bond auction.</p>
<p>The Treasury's 10-year bond now yields just one percentage
point more than Japan's 10-year bond, which some analysts say
is too small of a spread to encourage Japan's big
institutional investors to buy U.S. Treasurys.</p>
<p>The bond market then abruptly shifted gears as a plunge of
more than 100 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average took
center stage.</p>
<p>"When you got the swan dive in the stock market, traders
were climbing all over themselves to buy bonds," said F. Ward
McCarthy, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research
Associates, Princeton, N.J.</p>
<p>The stock sell-off prompted some "flight-to-quality"
buying among nervous institutional investors who sold stocks
and reinvested the cash in the bond market. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average staged a partial rebound later in the day
and ended at 2904.70, down 56.44 points.</p>
<p>"If investors are getting out of stocks, then governments
are the safest available alternative," said Charles
Lieberman, a managing director at Manufacturers Hanover
Securities Corp.</p>
<p>The bond rebound was not only the product of modest
flight-to-quality buying, but also of traders reversing their
bets on the market.</p>
<p>Alan McClymonds, co-head of government trading at First
Boston Corp., described yesterday's market as "vicious"
because many bond speculators lost large sums of money.</p>
<p>In early trading, many speculators took on short
positions. In a short sale, dealers and speculators sell
borrowed securities and later seek to make a profit by
replacing what was borrowed with cheaper securities.</p>
<p>But when bond prices rose yesterday, these speculators
were forced to cover their money-losing short positions by
buying bonds at higher prices.</p>
<p>The losses didn't stop there. Mr. Capra at Shearson Lehman
said speculators continued to buy bonds in a bet that stocks
would fall further and lead to even higher bond prices. They
were wrong again.</p>
<p>"The speculative side was in and out and lost money both
ways," said Shearson Lehman's Mr. Capra.</p>
<p>The bond rally stalled out late in the day, however, as
investors turned their attention to the bond market's
numerous negative fundamentals. In addition to rising
Japanese bond yields, investors are worried that
budget-cutting negotiations between Congress and the White
House have stalled and that the Federal Reserve appears to be
abandoning its battle against inflation.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury bonds ended little changed to lower in volatile
trading.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102, down
from 102 7/32 on Friday. The issue's yield rose to 8.55% from
8.53% on Friday. Two-year notes were quoted at 100 15/32
compared with 100 16/32 on Friday. The yield was unchanged at
8.07%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the government's weekly Treasury bill
auction short-term rates were set sharply lower.</p>
<p>The average discount rate on three-month Treasury bills
was 7.49% at yesterday's auction while the rate on six-month
bills was 7.40%. Those rates were down from last week's
auction when they were 7.62% and 7.52%, respectively.</p>
<p>The average rate on three-month bills was the lowest since
the average of 7.37% at the auction on Oct. 16 while the rate
on six-month bills was the lowest since the average of 7.30%
at the auction on Dec. 4, 1989.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's auction:
</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>

<p>Corporate Bonds</p>
<p>The tumble in stock prices rattled the junk bond market,
sending the high-yield speculative-grade securities
moderately lower.</p>
<p>Most junk bonds finished the session down 1/4 point to 3/8
point, the declines were modest compared to the sell-off in
the stock market.</p>
<p>Among the high-yield bonds which ended the day lower were
pay-in-kind bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. Pay-in-kind bonds pay
interest in the form of additional securities. The company's
17 3/8% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, which previously
carried an interest rate of 14.07%, finished down 3/4 points
to close at 117 on the New York Stock Exchange. The 17%
exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures, which also had a coupon
rate of 14.07%, ended down 1 point at 94 1/4.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of R.H. Macy & Co. continued to gain after
news that the New York-based retailer asked investment banks
to suggest ways for it to reduce debt and raise money. Macy's
14.5% senior subordinated debentures added 1 point to close
at 76.</p>
<p>Time Warner Inc.'s convertible preferred stock slipped
after it reported a second-quarter loss of $51 million. The
company's 8 3/4% convertible preferred stock Series C ended
down 1/4 point at 42 1/8.</p>
<p>Among new issues in the investment grade market, Spain
received an enthusiastic welcome when it tapped the corporate
debt market with its first underwritten U.S. debt offering.</p>
<p>Spain offered $300 million of 10-year notes which were
priced to yield 9.125%.</p>
<p>Mark Seigel, managing director in the syndicate department
at lead underwriter Morgan Stanley & Co., said the offering
received such a rousing response from investors because it
represents "the first opportunity for institutional investors
to purchase a discrete Yankee bond offering" from the Kingdom
of Spain.
</p>
<p>Municipal Securities</p>
<p>Tax-exempt issues ended unchanged to 1/8 point lower, with
some issues off 1/4 point in spots.</p>
<p>In secondary trading, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2018 were unchanged at 99 1/2 to yield
7.22%.</p>
<p>No large new municipal issues were priced during the
session.</p>
<p>Looking ahead on the calendar, New York City will sell
$1.1 billion of tax anticipation notes via competitive bid
today.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Japanese bond yields hit a six-year high yesterday as
investors reacted negatively to a move by the Bank of Japan,
the nation's central bank.</p>
<p>The BOJ bought a total of 500 billion yen ($3.36 billion)
of overnight commercial paper in two separate purchases. A
Bank of Japan official said the central bank was trying to
offset a rise in rates after the markets misread a 1.2
trillion yen bank loan call the central bank made last
Friday. He said the loan call was meant to drain excess bank
reserves, and not a signal that short-term interest rates
should rise.</p>
<p>But investors interpreted yesterday's action as a
flip-flop in policy. "The BOJ reversed the move they made
last week, which made the market even more upset because {the
Bank of Japan} is flopping back and forth and is
untrustworthy," said a dealer at a foreign-based securities
firm. "The market is still negative about rates," said
another dealer.</p>
<p>At the official 3:00 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, Japan's benchmark No. 119 10-year bond was quoted
at a price of 85.75, down 0.45 points, to yield 7.47%,
according to Japan's Daiwa Securities Co. That yield was the
highest for a benchmark 10-year bond in six years. During
over-the-counter trading, after the Tokyo Stock Exchange
closed, the yield on the benchmark bond rose further to
7.48%. (Japanese bond yields are quoted here in local terms.
However, when calculated using the semiannual compound
measure to compare yields across markets, the yield on the
No. 119 bond was 6.97%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.,
New York.)</p>
<p>Japanese rates on new three-month certificates of deposit
were unchanged yesterday at 7.7%. Corresponding Euroyen
deposits, which are securities sold in Europe that pay
interest in yen, were also flat at around 7.69%.</p>
<p>Mortgage, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities ended little changed.</p>
<p>Among actively traded secondary issues, Government
National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues were off 1/32 at 99
3/4 to yield 9.67%. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5%
issues were unchanged at 99 3/ 32 and Federal National
Mortgage Association 9.5% securities were flat at 99 19/32.</p>
<p>In the primary market, trading began in two new issues, a
real estate mortgage investment conduit and an asset-backed
offering.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae unveiled details of a $500 million Remic
mortgage issue, offered by Kidder, Peabody & Co. and backed
by 9.5% Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>And Sears Receivables Financing Group, a unit of Sears,
Roebuck & Co., is offering $250 million of securities backed
by credit-card receivables with a coupon rate of 8.70% that
were priced at 99.855 to yield 8.75%.</p>
