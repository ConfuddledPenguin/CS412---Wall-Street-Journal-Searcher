	<p class="article-leader">Marathons Keep Track
   Of Runners With Tags</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>THE PHOTO FINISH may become a quaint anachronism as sports
events and auto races begin using digital radio-tag
technology.</p>
<p>Contestants wear wristwatch-sized devices that emit a
unique low-power signal used to identify and time them. The
tags already have been tried on a test basis in the Los
Angeles Marathon, in triathlons and in cycling and
wind-surfing races.</p>
<p>William Burke, president of the marathon, says several
companies offered to supply radio-tag systems, from giants
such as American Telephone & Telegraph Co. to a start-up
called American Sports Timing Inc. of Topsfield, Mass. He
says they chose the start-up's system because it "seems to be
the one that is farthest along, with the best accuracy." Mr.
Burke says correctly timing the 20,000 entrants whom the race
attracts has become "a logistical nightmare."</p>
<p>David McGillivray, technical coordinator of the Boston
Marathon, calls radio-tag technology "the wave of the future"
and says the nation's oldest marathon is considering it for
future races.</p>
<p>Davy McKee Corp., a British company that makes radio tags
for industrial and transportation applications, says its
customers have come up with some surprising uses. Hospitals
use the system to keep track of wandering patients, while
others have begun using them to prevent mix-ups or even
kidnapping of babies.</p>
<p>Relief Is Coming Soon</p>
<p>For Lousy PC Graphics</p>
<p>NEW CHIPS in the pipeline promise big enhancements to the
power of PCs.</p>
<p>Researchers at Edsun Laboratories Inc., a chip designer in
Waltham, Mass., have developed a device that squeezes
stunning graphics performance out of an ordinary $400 color
computer monitor. The chip, which plugs into the standard
graphics boards inside most computers, displays as many as
790,000 colors -- compared with just 256 for the board by
itself -- and smooths out the jagged edges that appear when
curved or diagonal lines are drawn on most screens.</p>
<p>The chip lets pixels, individual points of light on a
screen, display two colors at once. In conventional designs,
pixels display just one color, causing the jagged edges and
limiting the color palette. The chip makes PC screen
resolution almost as good as that of a $10,000 workstation,
producing almost photo-quality images.</p>
<p>Steven D. Edelson, chairman, says several computer makers
are negotiating to use the chip, which would cost about $15
each, in forthcoming products. He wouldn't name the
companies.</p>
<p>Another chip maker, Chips & Technologies Inc., has
developed add-in PC accelerator boards to speed up specific
software programs such as Lotus 1-2-3 and Microsoft Windows.
While accelerators aren't new, tailoring them for specific
mainstream software packages is unusual. As software becomes
more complex and slower-running, demand for these
turbochargers could take off.</p>
<p>Industry insiders say Chips & Technologies is discussing
some novel marketing approaches with major software makers.
The company hopes to be ready to show a Windows booster at
Comdex, the big fall computer exposition.</p>
<p>Large Computer Buyers</p>
<p>Found a Software Clique</p>
<p>THE STRUGGLE over software standards has computer makers
forming cabals and consortiums of every stripe.</p>
<p>Now, fed up with the fractious process of setting
standards, a few big corporate computer purchasers have
formed a clique of their own.</p>
<p>Dubbed the Houston 30, for the city where the first
meeting took place, the informal group is made up of
computer-systems managers from some of the nation's largest
purchasers of computers, including General Electric Co.,
Eastman Kodak Co., General Motors Corp. and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Together, they
represent billions of dollars in buying power.</p>
<p>"There's a growing frustration among corporations over the
slow progress toward achieving open systems," says Bud Huber,
a Hughes Aircraft Co. network systems manager. The group,
which meets again in September, hopes to force faster
progress toward standards that allow different companies'
computers to run the same software.</p>
<p>There's a lot at stake for these companies -- and for
computer makers -- in the shift to open standards. Buyers
want standards so they don't get locked in to a particular
company's hardware design. Computer makers, some customers
suspect, want to slow the emergence of true standards to
protect fat profit margins.</p>
<p>The group was especially critical of the impasse between
AT&T's Unix International software unit and the Open Software
Foundation, a group backed by International Business Machines
Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Digital Equipment Corp. They
called the failure of the groups to agree on a standard "a
classic example of vendors making their {interests} paramount
to the detriment of the customer base."</p>
<p>In Software Industry,</p>
<p>Big Shots Get Bigger</p>
<p>CONSOLIDATION continues apace in software, as mergers have
erased half of the companies that were in the top 10 of
Software Magazine's Top 50 list five years ago.</p>
<p>But the Big Three just got bigger: Computer Associates
International Inc. was tops in 1989 with $1.29 billion in
world-wide sales, while Microsoft Corp. surged into second
past Lotus Development Corp. with sales of $691 million.
Lotus, with sales of $556 million, came in third in the $25
billion world market for packaged software, the magazine
said.</p>
