	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bankers Trust New York Corp. reported
second-quarter earnings of $174 million, or $2.06 a share,
flat with the year-ago figure of $175 million, or $2.14 a
share.
   Excluding tax benefits and a gain on the sale of its
factoring business, operating earnings were off 8.6% to $147
million, or $1.73 a share, compared with $161 million, or
$1.97, a year ago, according to analysts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chairman Charles S. Sanford Jr. said: "We again saw
superior results in our trading and risk management and trust
businesses, as well as a slight improvement in corporate
finance" from the preceding quarters.</p>
<p>For the first six months, Bankers Trust's earnings rose
10% to $372 million, or $4.42 a share, from $339 million, or
$4.16, a year ago.</p>
<p>Trading revenue posted a strong $50 million, or 26%, rise
to $243 million.</p>
<p>Net interest revenue dropped 21.3% to $191 million during
the quarter, partly because of the continuing absence of
Brazilian interest payments and an $11 million reduction for
the recently completed Mexican debt accord and the pending
Venezuelan debt pact.</p>
<p>Non-performing real estate loans, presumably including
$100 million owed by developer Donald Trump, rose $101
million during the period to $219 million. Problem loans to
highly leveraged transactions increased a modest $10 million
to $221 million.</p>
<p>The provision to Bankers Trust's reserves for possible
loan losses was $28 million, the same amount that was charged
off against its reserve for non-developing country debt. Also
charged off were $129 million in developing country loans,
including $40 million owed by Brazil.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Bankers Trust closed at $39.50, down 37.5 cents.</p>
