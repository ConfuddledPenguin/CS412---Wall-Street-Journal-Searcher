	<p class="article-leader">Hal O. Carroll's Manager's Journal, "Keep Lawyers -- and
Legal Fees -- on a Leash" (editorial page, June 25),
correctly targets the need for clients -- corporate and
individual -- to view legal services in the context of the
supply-demand equation and insist that lawyers not consider
themselves immune from certain basic rules of the
marketplace.
   But he passes over the biggest culprit: time billing. He
advocates invoices that permit "detailed analysis of time and
cost." As a practicing lawyer for 30 years who spends most of
his time on litigation for corporate and insurance clients,
I'm amazed that the same people who wouldn't think of
reacting to the price of a refrigerator or carpet by asking
"how many hours did it take to produce it?" seem to think
that there's a necessary relationship between time spent and
dollar value when it comes to legal services.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Time billing encourages lawyers to enlarge their bills by
simply spending lots of time creating a product that might
have been 95% as valuable to the client at 25% of the
time-cost.</p>
<p>The very corporate and insurance clients who are most
victimized by the "billable hour" are the most unbending in
demanding that the firms they hire itemize all services by
time and render bills set by that criterion only. They beg to
be hosed -- and the profession cheerfully accommodates them.</p>

<p>Most of what Mr. Carroll says is already common practice,
i.e., discount for volume, "triage," cost monitoring,
multiple firms, in-house control, and merits no serious
comment. However, his recommendations on "bidding," conduct
of litigation and "purchasing" legal services are totally
naive.</p>
<p>Does he realize that corporate (client) management of
litigation exposes the attorney to ethics as well as
liability complaints? There is no conceivable circumstance in
which a lawyer, having conducted his defense in accord with
the pecuniary demands of corporate management, rather than in
accord with sound and accepted legal practice, could
successfully plead -- in a malpractice suit against him -- "I
did it that way because management ordered me to."</p>
<p>How about a client (insured) who is damaged by an
insurer's litigation decisions, its management presumably
having read Mr. Carroll's admonition: Beware of doing
"everything possible" to win a case? I remind him that in
such a case the defendant is the client of the attorney, not
of the insurance company. For an attorney to act in a way
inconsistent with the attorney-client relationship is bound
to create a conflict of interest that will impeach him in the
event of a malpractice suit or complaint to the bar.</p>
<p>His real target should be the "adversarial process." An
attorney who does anything other than everything he deems
necessary to achieve a favorable result is as much a fool as
the lawyer who has himself for a client. (My apologies to Abe
Lincoln.)</p>
<p>As long as we labor within the spirit of the adversarial
system, we have no alternative but to proceed fully and
compentently to victory, once committed to trial. Cost is
necessarily a secondary consideration when measured against
the quality and thoroughness of pretrial work up; as long as
we seek resolution by "combat" there can be no alternative to
quality and thoroughness.</p>
