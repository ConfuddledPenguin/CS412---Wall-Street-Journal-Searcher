	<p class="article-leader">Kansas City Power & Light Co. launched a surprise
$27-a-share, or $857 million, tender offer for a neighboring
utility, Kansas Gas & Electric Co. of Wichita.
   While other utilities have put unsolicited proposals
before the boards of target companies, yesterday's bid
appears to be the first major hostile tender offer in the
heavily regulated electric industry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bid represents "new ground for the industry," said
Prudential-Bache analyst Barry Abramson. "I don't think
(Kansas Gas & Electric) will go down easily," he added,
noting that the offering price contains a smaller premium to
book value than have other recent acquisitions in the
industry.</p>
<p>The move was born out of Kansas City P&L's frustration
over its failure to obtain a friendly deal with its neighbor.
The Kansas City, Mo., concern has made unsuccessful overtures
for a combination over the past two years. The two companies
already jointly own 94% of a nuclear generating plant.</p>
<p>Kansas City P&L said the proposed acquisition would allow
it to make use of Kansas Gas & Electric's excess capacity,
thus deferring the potentially costly expansion Kansas City
P&L otherwise faces to satisfy its growing customer base. In
addition, it projected advantages accruing from better
utilization of plant assets, joining two complementary
transmission systems and economies of scale.</p>
<p>Such calculations are behind a recent spate of
acquisitions and mergers in the industry, where enlightened
managers are increasingly seeking combinations to boost
efficiency.</p>
<p>In March, for example, eyeing a similar discrepancy in
capacity requirements, Iowa Resources Inc. and the
slower-growing, capacity-rich Midwestern Energy Corp.
definitively agreed to form a holding company that will
combine the two utilities.</p>
<p>But unlike the situation in that friendly deal, Kansas
City P&L opted for a tender offer, with a bid for Kansas Gas
& Electric that was 37% above the Friday close for shares of
the Wichita company. Friday's price represented a 52-week
low, however, for the Wichita company, which is still
financially recovering from earlier difficulties with its
nuclear operations.</p>
<p>In Wichita, a spokesman for Kansas Gas & Electric declined
to comment, saying the company was still reviewing the offer.</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Kansas G&E shares jumped $4.625, to close at $24.375.
Yesterday's closing price shows investor wariness over the
lengthy time a deal could take, and the numerous conditions
on which it is predicated.</p>
<p>But the fact that the bidder has lined up bank financing
and is actually making an offer indicates, as one trader put
it, "these guys are very serious."</p>
<p>"Wilson, I want to emphasize our strong desire to achieve
a negotiated transaction . . . Personally, I would have
preferred to proceed with negotiations prior to commencement
of our tender offer, but we were strongly advised to commence
our offer before making a proposal to you," wrote A. Drue
Jennings, Kansas City P&L president and chief executive
officer, in a letter to Kansas Gas's chairman and president,
Wilson K. Cadman.</p>
<p>The adviser on the bid is a team of investment bankers led
by David Hedley, who left Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
January, just before that firm collapsed. They now work for
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp.</p>
<p>Kansas City P&L said it estimated that savings of $85
million, over a five-year period, could be obtained from
combining the company. In an interview, Mr. Jennings called
that estimate "conservative."</p>
<p>But the company's short-term borrowings to fund the
buy-out -- which could be avoided if the parties were
involved in a friendly, stock-swap acquisition -- would work
to offset a big part of those savings.</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers analyst Gregory B. Enholm finds much more
significant the savings that would be available through
Kansas City P&L's access to the target company's excess
capacity. "If you look at the interest cost on borrowing a
billion dollars" for the acquisition, buying extra capacity
in the form of another utility "is cheaper than building a
new power plant," he asserted.</p>
<p>Under Kansas law, an unsolicited bidder is restricted from
voting its shares above 20%, unless, at a special shareholder
meeting called for that purposes, stockholders of the target
company confer voting rights on the suitor for the full
amount of its shareholdings. Kansas City P&L filed suit
yesterday in federal court in Kansas City, Mo., asking the
court to order Kansas G&E to call such a meeting by no later
than 50 days.</p>
