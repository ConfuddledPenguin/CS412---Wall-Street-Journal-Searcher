	<p class="article-leader">Commodore International Ltd. said it signed up some large
retail chains, increasing to approximately 1,200 from 800 the
number of stores carrying its Amiga personal computer.
   Commodore, West Chester, Pa., said the retailers include
Montgomery Ward, Macy's of California, VideoConcepts, McDuff,
Highland Appliance, Sun TV and Famous-Barr. Commodore added
that it hopes to add more retailers by Nov. 15, in time for
the Christmas season.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Adding stores has been a major focus for Commodore in the
U.S., because, while the Amiga has long been considered an
impressive machine, it has suffered from lack of shelf space.</p>
