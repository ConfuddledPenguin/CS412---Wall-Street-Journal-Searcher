	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The New York Stock Exchange censured and fined
Charles Schwab & Co. $375,000 for allegedly misusing
customers' stock for the firm's profit.
   The fine against the nation's largest discount broker is
among the stiffest ever levied by the Big Board. And the
case, similar to recent regulatory action against Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., underscores the increased
scrutiny regulators are placing on brokerage firms'
back-office operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"In any examination of member firms, we'll be looking for
these practices," said Regina Mysliwiec, a vice president in
the Big Board's enforcement division.</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Schwab, a unit of
San Francisco-based Charles Schwab Corp., agreed to a finding
that it surreptitiously used customers' stock to participate
in more than 150 tender offers or other reorganizations
between 1985 and 1988, booking about $2.4 million in profits
for the firm.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, two Schwab executives were
censured without admitting or denying the allegations. Barry
Snowbarger, a senior vice president, agreed to a censure, a
one-month suspension and a supervisory bar for 18 months from
the firm's operation and credit areas. Stephen Cass, a vice
president, consented to a censure and supervisory bar of 12
months, with the exception of direct project support staff,
the exchange said.</p>
<p>Neither man was available for comment, a Schwab spokesman
said.</p>
<p>Schwab, which said the practices involved less than 1% of
its customers, repaid nearly $3 million to customers in early
1989 after company officials discovered the problem. In a
statement, Charles R. Schwab, the firm's founder and
chairman, said, "We have undertaken strong internal measures
to prevent such practices in the future, including new
policies governing each type of reorganization transaction,
separation of functions and a complete restructuring of the
reorganization department."</p>
<p>The firm's reorganization department, a back-office
processing unit, handles tender and exchange offers, stock
purchase rights and warrants, and convertible securities.</p>
<p>In at least 40 partial tender and exchange offers,
Schwab's reorganization department tendered part of its
customers' stock without permission from the investors,
allegedly generating about $1.4 million in profits. This
amount was said to come from keeping the difference between
the funds it received for the tendered shares and the
typically lower cost of repurchasing shares to replace the
customers' stock.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion, Schwab allegedly made about $250,000
in profit through at least 47 conversion offers, and about
$550,000 in profit through at least 79 rights and warrants
offers, the Big Board said.</p>
<p>The firm also was required to conduct an outside review of
the reorganization department and report the results to the
exchange.</p>
<p>The action was made public after the market closed
yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Schwab stock closed at $15, down 37.5 cents.</p>
