	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House passed legislation that would give
the Securities and Exchange Commission enhanced enforcement
power and would attempt to curb abuses in the penny-stock
market.
   The bill, approved by voice vote, is a combination of two
pieces of legislation. One would give the SEC its first
fining power outside of insider-trading charges. In egregious
situations, it would allow the agency to bar corporate
officers and directors from serving in such capacities at
public companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The other piece would force penny-stock dealers to provide
additional information to investors.</p>
<p>The Senate already has passed a bill similar to the
House's enforcement measure, but has no penny-stock
legislation in any advanced stage. The bills apparently were
combined to force the Senate to consider including the
penny-stock measure during a House-Senate conference on the
legislation.</p>
<p>"These two bills represent a powerful expansion of the
enforcement weapons available to combat the problems of
securities fraud in general and the penny-stock market in
particular," said Rep. Edward Markey, the Massachusetts
Democrat who heads the House subcommittee on
telecommunications and finance.</p>
<p>Still, the penny-stock provision represents a toned-down
version of the original bill, which the SEC had said could
curb some legitimate capital-raising activities.</p>
