	<p class="article-leader">Justice Brennan's retirement and the nomination of Judge
David Souter to the Supreme Court have almost eclipsed what
might have been the legal news of the month. So before
elaborating on the Supreme Court, we'd like to pause a moment
to note that in reversing Oliver North's convictions, the
Federal Court of Appeals has ruled that the Iran-Contra
prosecutions were indeed kangaroo trials.
   The court's tight reasoning Friday reversed all three
North convictions -- one outright and the other two pending
theoretically possible reinstatement after seemingly
impossible further hearings. It ruled that the North
convictions, and by implication presumably the John
Poindexter conviction as well, may have been tainted by the
misdeeds of Congress and Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Congress forced Mr. North to testify in public during the
summer of 1987. His testimony didn't go the way his
inquisitors had planned; he became a national hero instead of
an excuse to impeach President Reagan. The legal significance
was that Congress forced Mr. North to abandon his right
against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. When a
defendant is given immunity and forced to testify in public,
any trial must proceed without any use in any way of the
coerced testimony. No witnesses, prosecutors or jurors can be
"tainted" by Mr. North's testimony to Congress.</p>
<p>At Mr. Walsh's urging, trial Judge Gerhard Gesell failed
to hold a hearing on this issue. Now the appeals court says
if anyone wants to keep pursuing Mr. North, there will have
to be a hearing to "inquire into the content as well as the
sources of the grand jury and trial witnesses' testimony."
The court added that the inquiry "must proceed
witness-by-witness; if necessary, it will proceed
line-by-line and item-by-item."</p>
<p>"We readily understand how court and counsel might sigh
prior to such an undertaking," the court said, in a
not-very-subtle message to Mr. Walsh and/or Judge Gesell to
call the whole thing off. The judges said such a hearing
"could consume substantial amounts of time, personnel, and
money, only to lead to the conclusion that a defendant"
cannot get a fair trial.</p>
<p>Many witnesses admit hearing Mr. North's congressional
testimony; one witness, Rep. Lee Hamilton, had earlier been
one of his interrogators. As we wrote two years and millions
of taxpayer dollars ago, the immunity issue was one of many
that would have stopped any normal U.S. Attorney from
bringing this case.</p>
<p>The Fifth Amendment here is no Miranda-style technicality.
While reversing on narrower grounds, the appeals court saw
here the same principle that led the Founding Fathers to
include constitutional provisions banning ex post facto laws
or bills of attainder. This was a political battle
masquerading as a criminal case. The court wrote, "We do not
countenance political trials in this country, and this matter
is not styled Independent Counsel v. Executive Branch or even
Congress v. Executive Branch."</p>
<p>It is now clearer than ever that Mr. Walsh should cut his
losses and go home. Or President Bush should send him
packing. Congress should forswear its triple punch of forcing
a presidential aide to testify, then sicking a loose-cannon
special prosecutor on him, then having the congressional
testimony used in criminal court. We can hope that Mr.
North's wrongful trial might be this country's last
experiment with political prosecutions.</p>
