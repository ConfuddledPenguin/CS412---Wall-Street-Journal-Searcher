	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Federal officials investigating the fatal 1989
crash of a Southern Co. plane said they were unable to
determine the cause of the on-board fire that brought down
the aircraft.
   In its final report, the National Transportation Safety
Board said it could find no evidence that a lightning strike,
a mechanical malfunction or a bomb triggered the blaze aboard
the Beech 200 April 10, 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Jacob F. Horton, senior vice president of Southern's Gulf
Power unit, died in the crash, along with the plane's two
pilots. Transcripts from the cockpit voice recorder showed
that the three men became aware of a fire at the plane's rear
and the pilots attempted to radio for help about a minute
before the aircraft slammed into an apartment complex in
Pensacola, Fla.</p>
<p>The NTSB report said that the failure of the plane's crew
to put on oxygen masks, to cut the effect of smoke and fumes
in the cockpit, "contributed to the accident."</p>
<p>In a statement responding to the report, Southern Company
Services Inc., the Southern unit that owned the plane, said
it was disappointed that the fire's origin remains unknown.
But Allen Franklin, the unit's president, said "perhaps
additional information will come to light through the legal
process."</p>
<p>Last year, lawyers for Mr. Horton's estate filed suit
against the Southern subsidiary, alleging that sloppy
maintenance and operation of the plane led to the crash.
Southern Co. has since filed a counterclaim, alleging that
actions taken by Mr. Horton himself caused the fire.</p>
