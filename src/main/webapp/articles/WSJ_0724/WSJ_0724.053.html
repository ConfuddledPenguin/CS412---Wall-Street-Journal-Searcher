	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- If consumers aren't eating enough Big Macs,
will we miss Dow 3000?
   The question isn't as far-fetched as it might seem. Late
last Friday, McDonald's Corp., one of a select cadre of
seemingly invulnerable growth stocks whose six-month-long
rise drove the Dow Jones Industrials within a fraction of
3000, disappointed Wall Street with lower-than-expected
earnings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, Wall Street took its revenge. Acting like
jilted lovers, investors dumped McDonald's and other growth
stocks, knocking the industrial average down 56.44 points to
2904.70 in heavy trading. The question now is whether
yesterday's big decline is a mere interruption of the upward
movement or something more serious, the start of a shift in
sentiment that would kill any thought of a 3000 Dow for the
rest of this year.</p>
<p>For months, investors have had an almost insatiable
appetite for big, household-name growth stocks, such as
McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Walt Disney and Procter & Gamble. And
although these issues have begun to look expensive by some
measures, many experts still see them climbing further. Much
further.</p>
<p>"There's a very select group of stocks with good
earnings-growth stories that are being pushed up," says
Charles Clough, chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch &
Co. "We're not convinced that's over yet. Since it's in such
short supply, the price of growth is likely to keep going
up."</p>
<p>But other analysts who only a week ago were predicting a
surge above 3000 now see an ominous portent. "There's been a
change in investor psychology," contends Kenneth Spence,
director of the technical-analysis group at Salomon Brothers.
"With weakness in earnings for autos, hamburgers and
semiconductors, the earnings rebound that investors expected
in the second half of the year is under a great deal of
suspicion."</p>
<p>If nothing else, the Dow's dive yesterday -- it was down
more than 105 points early in the day -- illustrates what can
happen in a stock market dangerously dependent on a handful
of supposed winners. Abby Joseph Cohen, the chief U.S. market
strategist for Barclays Bank, puts it this way: "If the
market starts to decline, what stocks will investors sell?
They can only sell the stocks they own, and the growth stocks
are what they own."</p>
<p>Of course, it isn't any surprise to most investors that as
prices rise, which the growth stocks have been doing for the
past several months, so inevitably do the risks. But the
irony of the Dow's climb to 2999.75 last week, and the sudden
plunge yesterday, is that investors have pushed up the
average partly in a quest for safety. Amid fear late last
year that the economy might slide into recession, investors
sought out stocks that seemed relatively immune to economic
cycles.</p>
<p>Big companies such as Merck, Gillette, Home Depot,
Wal-Mart, Anheuser-Busch and Philip Morris became the
darlings of Wall Street. Whether because of these companies'
marketing muscle, unique products or their innovative
management, investors became convinced that the firms would
thrive whatever the environment. Consequently, prices of such
companies' stocks rose much faster than anyone expects their
earnings to grow. While the average Dow Industrials stock
sells at a per-share price of about 14 times its annual
earnings (for the Standard & Poor's 500, it's about 16), some
of the growth stocks investors were snapping up through last
week were selling at as high as 40 times earnings.</p>
<p>No matter. Some money managers argue that sustained growth
in earnings is a valuable commodity, well worth the high
prices they pay to own a piece of these companies. If this
all sounds reminiscent of the "Nifty Fifty" phenomenon of the
early 1970s, it is.</p>
<p>"My style is to be in what used to be known as the Nifty
Fifty," says Roger Engemann, who heads a Pasadena, Calif.,
money-management firm. "We expect these stocks' earnings to
grow at 20%-plus per year for the next five years. What's
that worth? At the very least, it would be a 20 multiple."</p>
<p>Indeed, if the Nifty Fifty upsurge is repeated, earnings
growth will be worth a lot more than Mr. Engemann's minimum.
In the fervor of the market's fling with growth stocks in the
early '70s, a price-earnings ratio of 20 was a bargain. In
April 1972, Polaroid commanded a multiple close to 65 times
earnings; Digital Equipment had a P/E ratio of 80; Walt
Disney, a P/E of 78, and McDonald's, a P/E of 70.
International Business Machines looked like a laggard at only
41.</p>
<p>By those standards, most growth stocks today still look
awfully tempting, perhaps especially to investors who,
stunned by the October 1987 stock-market crash, sat out much
of the market's nearly 1,300-point recovery. "As these people
come back, they're saying they want the very best," says Jack
Orben, president of American Family Services, which manages
money for wealthy individuals. "They find great comfort in
high-quality growth stocks, a situation not terribly
different from the 1972-73 period."</p>
<p>There's no denying the impressive returns to investors who
purchased growth stocks a year ago. Then, before the
growth-stock frenzy, an investor could have bought a
portfolio of growth stocks at prices about equal to the
overall price-earnings ratio of the broader market, says Ms.
Cohen, Barclays Bank's strategist.</p>
<p>"That means you could have bought the "creme de la creme"
of corporate America at no price premium at all," she says.
Even after yesterday's slump, that same portfolio would cost
a big premium.</p>
<p>James LaTorre, a portfolio manager at the Ivy Fund, has
watched his Ivy Growth with Income Fund rise 7.5% so far this
year, more than double the total return -- price plus
dividends -- of 3.03% for the Standard & Poor's 500 stocks at
the end of June. The fund is loaded with such growth stocks
as Home Depot, Motorola, Boeing and Wal-Mart, all of which
sport substantial premiums for their earnings.</p>
<p>"Price-earnings ratios are a moving target," Mr. LaTorre
says. "As long as the stocks are sufficiently popular with
institutions, you have to be in."</p>
<p>Many companies are lumped under the heading of growth
stocks, and many of them deserve premium prices, analysts
argue. Although Boeing, for example, carries a relatively
rich price-earnings ratio of 25 times the past four quarters'
earnings, analysts such as Hugh Johnson, chief investment
officer at First Albany Corp., don't mind holding the stock
in hopes of further gains. Not only does the aircraft maker
have a huge order backlog, it also has managed in recent
years to focus on the lucrative commercial market while
paring its dependence on military sales.</p>
<p>"Boeing is a good example of a company that has changed
enough to justify moving into uncharted waters," Mr. Johnson
claims.</p>
<p>Gillette is another solid play, according to some
investors. Mr. Orben says that in view of its new Sensor
razor and its long-demonstrated marketing expertise,
investors can be comfortable with Gillette's stock price
despite a lofty P/E ratio of 23.5 times earnings. "It and
stocks like it are just going to continue hitting new highs,"
he predicts.</p>
<p>But not every so-called growth stock will grow fast enough
to justify fat premiums. What happens when such a stock, for
whatever reason, loses a bit of its luster? A look at what
has just happened to McDonald's shares shows just how fragile
a reputation as a growth stock can be.</p>
<p>Basically, the news that McDonald's reported Friday didn't
sound bad at all. Second-quarter net income rose 10%.
International sales and earnings were robust. And although
analysts had expected quarterly earnings of 60 cents a share,
the company earned 59 cents -- hardly a major disappointment.</p>
<p>But the average company-owned restaurant did $4,000 less
business than a year ago, and the average franchisee-operated
one did about $10,000 less. McDonald's said it isn't
satisfied with the performance and is weighing new menu
strategies. To analysts, that news suggested stepped-up price
discounting. McDonald's shares dropped $1.50 Friday and
another $3 yesterday to close at $33. The declines brought
the stock's price-earnings ratio down to 16.4 times the past
four quarters' earnings, from 19 just before the financial
results were announced.</p>
<p>Although that P/E is still at or above average, McDonald's
prolonged stock rise and its plunge in a few days is somewhat
reminiscent of the rise and the much-longer fall of the Nifty
Fifty in the early '70s. Back then, skyrocketing oil prices,
soaring labor and food costs and a tumbling dollar brought
stagflation. Even the big growth companies couldn't stand up
to the painful combination of a severe recession and surging
inflation. By late 1974, Polaroid had tumbled to less than $8
a share from $74, and Xerox to $50 from about $150 earlier.</p>
<p>"You had a tremendous concentration that blew stocks to
unrealistic values" in the early '70s, recalls John M.
McCarthy, a 63-year-old portfolio manager of the $3.7 billion
Affiliated Fund, who was running the fund during the 1970s
growth-stock boom. "When you bought Polaroid in April 1972 at
65 times earnings, you were buying infinity."</p>
<p>Now, Mr. McCarthy worries about a rerun. "I'm staring at a
pit out there," he frets. "If the market has been going
straight up, with a concentration in a limited number of
stocks, you know that sooner or later it's going to walk into
a black hole."</p>
<p>The virtual certainty that something, sometime, will close
down the party isn't far from the minds of many analysts. "A
lot of these are stocks that I've happily recommended, and
I've enjoyed the ride up," First Albany's Mr. Johnson says.
"But now they've reached levels that make me uncomfortable."</p>
<p>His discomfort stems from a simple question: What
justifies the recent high prices? The answer, in his view:
Nothing. "It isn't because interest rates are falling
sharply, and it isn't because the level or quality of
earnings are going to improve a lot," he says.</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Johnson isn't selling even now. Most of
yesterday's drop, he believes, was due to program trading,
not selling by long-term investors. He is betting that
speculative fever is still at large among investors and that
they will ultimately drive still higher the prices of growth
stocks, even those that he deems the most overpriced, such as
General Electric, Merck, Philip Morris and Browning-Ferris.</p>
<p>"We're stretching the rules, and you have to realize that
the risks are higher when you stretch the rules," he says.
"It's OK to stretch the rules as long as you know you're on
thin ice, and that's why I'm going to stay with Merck and
General Electric."</p>
<p>Despite the battering from investors yesterday, even
McDonald's still has fans among growth-stock aficionados.
Hugh Zurkuhlin, a consumer-products analyst at Salomon
Brothers, contends that despite the sluggish U.S. economic
growth, McDonald's is poised for striking growth abroad.
"McDonald's looks like Coca-Cola looked in the 1950s, when
international growth was limitless," he says.</p>
<p>And the most bullish of analysts contend that investors
needn't continue to concentrate their attention on the
supposedly-safe big growth stocks. "When interest rates
peaked, investors got a little afraid of a recession and were
looking for safe stocks like Disney and Procter & Gamble,"
says Peter Canelo, chief market strategist at Bear Stearns.
"But with rates coming down now, people are not quite so
afraid of a recession, so they don't need the safe stocks
anymore."</p>
<p>He expects the Federal Reserve to continue easing monetary
policy, slowly, for several months. Done correctly, he says,
such a strategy could inspire confidence that the economy
will continue to grow while inflation remains in check. And
that might well open the door to big gains for industrial and
technology stocks.</p>
