	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Martha Seger, the Federal Reserve Board's
most consistent advocate of easier money, said she may resign
this year for personal reasons.
   "I'll probably be making a decision by the end of the year
on whether or not I have to leave," Ms. Seger said in an
interview yesterday. "I'm going to play it by ear."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ms. Seger said she may have to resign to care for her
elderly mother, who lives in Arizona and has recently
undergone hip-replacement surgery and suffered a stroke.</p>
<p>If Ms. Seger resigns, the Bush administration is unlikely
to find another reserve board governor who will be more
consistent in pushing for lower interest rates than Ms.
Seger. But they may be able to find a replacement who has
more clout with her Fed colleagues. Ms. Seger is considered a
maverick by most of her fellow policy makers at the Fed, and
is thought to have little influence in the policy-making
process.</p>
<p>Appointed in 1984, Ms. Seger still has eight years to go
in her 14-year term. But according to friends, she has
increasingly complained of getting poor treatment from top
Fed staff, saying they sometimes don't even bother to inform
her of important meetings. In the telephone interview
yesterday, Ms. Seger acknowledged her differences with the
Fed staff, but said that isn't the reason she's considering
leaving.</p>
<p>Her resignation would give President Bush an opportunity
to make two new appointments to the Fed's seven-member Board
of Governors. Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson already has
announced he plans to resign early next month.</p>
<p>The Senate earlier this year confirmed Mr. Bush's first
appointee to the Reserve Board, former Treasury official
David Mullins.</p>
<p>In the interview yesterday, Ms. Seger put herself at odds
with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan by saying she believes the
economy now stands on the brink of recession. "I think we are
at risk," she said. "Whenever you get growth very, very, very
slow, it's easy to tip from modest black ink into red ink."</p>
<p>She also said she's very concerned that a credit crunch
may be having widespread effects on the economy. "This is one
of the drums I've been beating for some months now," she
said. "I first started to hear it from builders. . . . But it
has spread way beyond that. I'm hearing stories from bigger
businesses in the Northeast whose banks are reacting to tough
regulatory treatment. And a number of car dealers, who are
not exactly teeny, tiny businesses, have found their bank
lines cut."</p>
<p>Ms. Seger, 58 years old, has a Ph.D. in finance and
business economics from the University of Michigan. Before
coming to the Fed, she was a professor of finance at Central
Michigan University and banking commissioner for the state of
Michigan.</p>
