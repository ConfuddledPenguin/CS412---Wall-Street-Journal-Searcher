	<p class="article-leader">ALBANY, N.Y. -- Trans World Music Corp., a music and
videocassette retailer, plans a public offering of one
million common shares, its first offering since July 1986,
when the stock began trading over the counter.
   In a registration statement filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Trans World said that Robert J. Higgins,
its president, chief executive officer and largest
shareholder, will offer 750,000 shares, reducing his 67%
stake to 57%, and that the company will offer 250,000 shares.
The company has about nine million shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>James R. Williamson, chief financial officer, said the
offering price is expected to be "near market price." Trans
World shares closed at $31.50, down $1.50, yesterday in
national over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>Goldman, Sachs & Co., which managed the initial public
offering, will underwrite the latest offering, with an option
to purchase an additional 150,000 shares.</p>
<p>Proceeds would be used to reduce short-term debt and
finance the opening of about 120 stores in the eastern U.S.
this year.</p>
<p>Trans World recently settled a trademark-infringement suit
for $1.5 million with a rival retailer, Peaches Entertainment
Corp., and last year had losses when it leased space in
stores owned by Crazy Eddie Inc., a defunct electronics
chain.</p>
<p>Separately, Mr. Williamson, the finance chief, said he is
resigning, pending the appointment of a successor and an
orderly transition. The company said he is relocating to the
Midwest for personal reasons.</p>
