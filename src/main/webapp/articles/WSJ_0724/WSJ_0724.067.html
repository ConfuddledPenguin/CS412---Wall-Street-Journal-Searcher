	<p class="article-leader">Investors hammered over-the-counter stocks in the worst
one-day pasting since last year's "mini-crash" on Oct. 19.
   "The OTC market is getting its brain beat in," said
William Sulya, director of OTC trading at A.G. Edwards, St.
Louis. Despite a "few signs of life" at the end of the day,
Mr. Sulya said he wasn't convinced the selling spree had
ended. "We hope it will bounce {today} so we can sweep up the
debris, but that remains to be seen."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 10.63 to 444.64, or
2.3%, surpassing yesterday's 1.9% drop in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. Declining shares swamped advancers, 1,857
to 431, as 186 stocks fell to new lows and only 21 reached
new highs. Volume eased slightly to 168.9 million from 174.6
million Friday.</p>
<p>The steep plunge in smaller stocks in lock-step with
larger shares was unusual, said Jack Laporte, president of
the $1 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, who noted
that smaller issues usually trail big drops in large stocks
by a day.</p>
<p>"What bothered me was that the secondaries
underperformed," he said. "Normally, they get whacked the
next day." Mr. Laporte called "disturbing" the recent poor
performance of OTC stocks relative to the broader Standard &
Poor's 500 stock index. The OTC market has fallen 5.32% in
the last five sessions, compared with a 3.4% decline in the
New York Stock Exchange Composite Index.</p>
<p>Traders and portfolio managers blamed the OTC bloodbath in
part on program trading of larger stocks, nervousness about
corporate earnings, fears about the economy and concerns that
the market for initial public offerings might lose some
steam.</p>
<p>Alan Radlo, manager of the $734 million Fidelity OTC
Portfolio, grumped about program trading. "They might as well
be playing with jelly beans instead of the market," Mr. Radlo
said, adding that he finds such influences on the market
discouraging not only to himself but also to his mutual fund
clients. Both Mr. Radlo and Mr. Laporte said they bought
shares during yesterday's fall.</p>
<p>Scattered among the day's most-active shares were some
well-known stocks that ended higher after a day of erratic
trading.</p>
<p>Nike rose 3/4 to 90 3/8 after shares of the athletic
footwear maker traded as low as 84 1/2. Apple Computer, which
Friday announced a five-million share buy-back program,
gained 1/2 to 41 1/2 after falling to 40.</p>
<p>MCI Communications closed unchanged at 38.</p>
<p>Intel, the day's most active stock, fell 5/8 to 44 1/2 on
3.1 million shares. Among other technology shares, Sun
Microsystems slipped 1 3/8 to 30 7/8; Conner Peripherals slid
1 to 26 3/4; Oracle Systems dropped 1/2 to 17 3/8; Lotus fell
3/4 to 24 1/2; Microsoft declined 1 1/4 to 72, and AST
Research tumbled 1 1/4 to 20 3/4. The Nasdaq Industrial
Index, which includes many computer-related issues, dove
12.60 to 479.36, a 2.56% slide.</p>
<p>Although a big queue of sellers lined up before the
opening, traders contended that activity throughout the day
was orderly. "The way it started it out, I thought it would
be a disaster," said Jerry Mullins, head of OTC trading at
Dean Witter Reynolds. Mr. Mullins attributed the steady
erosion in smaller stocks to a lack of support among buyers.
"I guess nobody wants to take positions," he said.</p>
<p>Investors remained cautious throughout the day, according
to E. E. "Buzzy" Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld,
New York. "It's like cattle," he said. "They can go either
way here. If someone starts a run on the down side, they'll
hit them again."</p>
<p>Among the day's prospectors, Mr. Radlo said he bought
about 75 issues, among them shares of banks with strong
earnings, oil-service related companies and specific
companies with robust operations. Those included stocks of
included Bancorp Hawaii, a Honolulu commercial bank; Novell,
a maker of personal-computer network systems; and Medical
Care International, which Friday reported net income for the
second quarter rose to 37 cents a share from 24 cents a year
earlier. Medical Care fell 1 7/8 to 38.</p>
<p>Despite having their "fingers burned" by disappointing
earnings among some technology companies, T. Rowe Price's
investment managers still have faith that long-term bargains
remain in the shares of some technology companies and other
OTC concerns with double-digit earnings growth, said Mr.
Laporte.</p>
<p>"We feel strongly that valuations remain compelling," he
said, adding that the New Horizons Fund hasn't changed its
level of cash. Among the stocks he favors are Medco
Containment Services, a provider of prescription services by
mail; Autodesk, a maker of computer-aided design and drafting
products; and bubble-gum card maker Topps.</p>
<p>Earnings reports managed to lift the price of a few
stocks. American Power Conversion rose 2 1/2 to 40 1/4 after
the Peace Dale, R.I., maker of power supply products reported
net income for the second quarter more than doubled to 53
cents a share from 26 cents a year earlier. The company also
announced that it would split its stock 3-for-1.</p>
<p>Dynatech gained 1 1/2 to 18. The Burlington, Mass.,
scientific-instrument company reported net income for the
first quarter ended June 30 rose to 45 cents a share from 37
cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>BB&T Financial added 1/2 to 18 1/2. The Wilson, N.C.,
thrift was the subject of a positive profile in the current
issue of Barron's.</p>
<p>Amgen gained 3/4 to 85 1/2. Friday, the Thousand Oaks.,
Calif., biotechnology company reported net income for the
first quarter ended June of 57 cents a share, before a
2-for-1 stock split, compared with five cents a share a year
earlier. Also, analysts at First Boston and Prudential-Bache
Securities repeated their "buy" opinions on the stock,
according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.</p>
