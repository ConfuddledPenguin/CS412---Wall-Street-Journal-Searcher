	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush proposed the removal of all
U.S. tariffs on certain products exported by Ecuador,
Bolivia, Peru and Colombia, and promised to negotiate
long-term trade agreements with these countries.
   Mr. Bush's proposal yesterday, which requires
congressional approval, is part of an administration strategy
of offering trade incentives to Central and South America
and, in particular, to the Andean nations, which are the
world's largest producers of coca and its derivative,
cocaine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last month, the administration proposed a comprehensive
package of debt reduction and investment incentives for Latin
America. Yesterday's announcement was designed to show
special concern for countries attempting to fight production
and distribution of illegal drugs.</p>
<p>It was also timed to coincide with yesterday's visit to
Washington of Ecuadoran President Rodrigo Borja, whom Mr.
Bush lauded for having eradicated coca production in his
country in recent years.</p>
<p>In addition to the removal of tariffs on such products as
plywood, canned crab and various agricultural goods, the Bush
administration package would provide U.S. technical
assistance to Latin America and the Caribbean, to aid in
developing agricultural trade for the U.S. Mr. Bush also
signed a package that removes tariff on 67 other products
exported by the Andeans. And he signed a measure establishing
a council to begin work on developing long-term trade and
investment agreements between the U.S. and the Andean
nations.</p>
