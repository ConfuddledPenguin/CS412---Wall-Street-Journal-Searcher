	<p class="article-leader">The Berkeley graduate who learned socialism from Michael
Harrington thinks the great Southern California capitalist
boom is still young. The prophets from UCLA's management
school, where market theory rules, see the sun starting to
set.
   That may seem surprising, but methodology more than
ideology illuminates the Whither Los Angeles debate. It's a
matter of economic science vs. street sense.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most economists aren't going as far as the UCLA
Forecasting Group in espying the brink of recession. But
clearly layoffs are rolling through 360,000 civilian
aerospace jobs in the state. Most of these are in the Los
Angeles region, although the San Jose area actually has a
higher concentration. McKinsey & Co.'s consultants see at
least a quarter of this work force gone by the end of the
Pentagon downsizing. That's the same proportion as was aced
in the cutbacks that wracked Southern California 20 years
ago.</p>
<p>The "multiplier" effect on other employment is projected
to extend the current damage. UCLA finds construction
activity already falling through the floor. It detects no
source of strength in any sector. (Another straw in the
western wind: demand for temporary office workers, a good
modern barometer, has been down for months.) The aerospace
bust could be a catalyst for widespread movement away from
the congestion, crime and costs of a spent-out metropolis.</p>
<p>Enter Joel Kotkin, who left Long Island, N.Y., in the
early '70s and old-line leftism by the '80s to emerge as a
guru of pluralist prosperity in Los Angeles. An "ethnically
conscious" Jew who insinuates himself into the immigrant
neighborhoods and businesses of his adopted hometown, he is a
prolific writer, fellow of a Denver-based outfit called the
Center for the New West and a seeming encyclopedia on the
people and commerce of the new LA.</p>
<p>The trained experts can't fathom what's going on at ground
level, says Mr. Kotkin, 37. "I can think circles around the
Ph.D.s in economics, at least on this stuff." The history
B.A. sees an unremitting rush of talent, wealth and energy to
the opportunity of this place in the sun. It isn't just
foreigners, he says: domestic in-migration, especially of
young white men, remains strong. But he agrees with the
UCLAns that one breed of Californian, for whom aerospace "was
General Motors transplanted," is in eclipse.</p>
<p>"A lot of people came to California from the Midwest
looking for paradise, and they found the center of the world
instead," he says. With their plants closing they will not
wish to stay. "There are people who are culturally displaced
in LA. A lot of the unhappiness you hear is Ozzie and Harriet
waking up one morning and finding out that their next-door
neighbor's wife is wearing a sari and the guy across the
street is Filipino." Eight people may be living as an
extended family, noisily celebrating odd holidays and
evincing a busyness that rankles the settled.</p>
<p>At work, a 50-year-old defense engineer may have no future
here if he's "used to spending all that needs to be spent to
get a perfect specification and he can't get into a
commercial mentality," says Mr. Kotkin. Or if he has a
problem reporting to, say, a young Vietnamese boss at the
sort of specialized R&D firms that will want to stay in the
Los Angeles of tomorrow.</p>
<p>So some in aerospace will move, at least to the far
reaches of the urban sprawl. But the economy will not
implode, Mr. Kotkin thinks. Each time the Pentagon shrank
after wars, in the '40s, '50s and '60s, he says, LA's
downfall was falsely assumed, because "people in the East
think Southern Californians are a bunch of idiots and that
the only reason they could be any good is that the federal
government is shooting them full of steroids."</p>
<p>But entrepreneurial industrialists picked up the slack.
Initially they were Howard Hughes and associate Charles
Thornton (later of Litton Industries). By the '70s the huge
influx of foreign investment and people had begun. Unsuited
to military work during its heyday because of security
strictures, these outsiders aren't hurting today.</p>
<p>"The federal government is becoming more irrelevant to the
economy," Mr. Kotkin maintains, citing the accompanying
chart. (See accompanying illustration -- WSJ July 24, 1990)
Indeed, Pentagon work is a bigger factor in the Washington,
D.C., area and New England than on the West Coast.</p>
<p>Small manufacturing is king in Southern California. A
garment industry rivaling New York's has sprung up. World
trade and the financing that underwrites it have blossomed.
There's ever-expanding "Hollywood," of course. And the
unmeasurable: "God knows what percentage of the income in
East LA {the Latino center} is being made in the underground
economy," he says. "I don't mean drug dealing -- construction
work, gardeners, people bringing in produce and selling it
off a truck." Mr. Kotkin likens the situation to author
Hernando de Soto's Peru. And he suggests this measure of
success: Homes in East LA, not long ago considered a blighted
barrio, sell for three times what they'd cost in Compton, a
largely black suburb.</p>
<p>"Half the economy seems to be operating in some language
other than English," exaggerates Mr. Kotkin. "And the money
is coming from someplace else." Along with the Chinese
diaspora, he says, the hottest source is ethnic Indians from
Hong Kong, but they're cooling their heels. "They're coming
in and buying stuff in Cerritos," a middle-class multiethnic
area. "If it doesn't make a lot of money in five years,
that's fine. They got their money out of Hong Kong. Cerritos
isn't going to be taken over by the communist Chinese."</p>
<p>With all of its lawyers, regulators and outright thieves,
Southern California is no easy pickings for small business,
he acknowledges. But to the immigrant, "the hassles are
infinitely less than dealing with the Mexican bureaucracy, or
having to drive around in a {lousy} car so you don't get
kidnapped in Taipei, or worrying about Li Peng marching into
town tomorrow."</p>
<p>Northern Mexico's growing vibrancy will change the picture
further. It is already leading to a surge in middle-class
Mexican tourism in Southern California, Mr. Kotkin says. And
the "maquiladora" assembly plants across the border are
proving a market for such components as specialty plastics
made in the LA area.</p>
<p>If New York City of the early 1900s was the model of the
LA dynamo, doesn't that augur ill? Mr. Kotkin, whose
grandfather ran vaudeville theaters in Brooklyn, says no. New
York's economy choked on corporatization and from a virtual
shut-off of immigration from 1924-65. Los Angeles is
atomistic and, the border laws notwithstanding, maintains a
vital inflow.</p>
<p>Mr. Kotkin isn't oblivious to the problems that
large-scale immigration can bring. He wants government to
deal with them, which is one reason he still considers
himself a liberal. But whatever his ideology, his layman's
economics may gauge better than sophisticated models the
health of America's second city. If anything was learned from
the failed forecasting of the 1980s, it's that global shifts
of capital, both money and human, count for more than many
realized.</p>
