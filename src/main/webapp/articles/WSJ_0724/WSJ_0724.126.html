	<p class="article-leader">MILLERS FALLS, Mass. -- Nobody knows more about the Boston
Red Sox than Charles Waseleski III, a chunky, rumpled
35-year-old office manager in this Western Massachusetts
village of 1,300 people.
   How often does Wade Boggs ground into double plays against
left-handed pitchers? Three times this year. What percentage
of the time do Red Sox hitters advance runners from first
base with no outs? This year, 43.2% of the time. Which Red
Sox pitcher is most bothered by the close -- in left field
wall -- the Wall, they call it here -- at Fenway Park? John
Dopson, who gave up 13 hits, including seven home runs, to
the Wall or over it in 1989. When a Red Sox relief pitcher
enters the game with a man on second, how likely is that
inherited runner to score? The probability is 42%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Waseleski uses minutely detailed scorekeeping and an
Apple II computer at his rolltop desk in his cramped
one-bedroom apartment to compile such esoteric statistics.
The computer stores data on every Red Sox game since 1983.
"There was no intention of {my} becoming this warped," says
Mr. Waseleski of his peculiar avocation. It just grew
naturally from his devotion to scorekeeping.</p>
<p>A sportswriter for the Boston Globe, which buys a weekly
statistical compilation from Mr. Waseleski, has called him
"the maniacal Chuck Waseleski." Says Brian David, a players'
agent at Speakers of Sport, a Northbrook, Ill., agency:
"There's nobody like him." Mr. Waseleski was once able to
tell him the number of times that Jim Rice held to singles
balls hit off the wall, as compared to the opposition
left-fielder. "I couldn't stop laughing," Mr. David says.
"This was too much."</p>
<p>A sample of other arcana: Last year, the Red Sox's Dwight
Evans hit .277 against right-handed pitchers and .303 against
lefties. He batted .275 in Fenway Park, knocking all eight of
his at-home homers over the notorious Wall. At night he
batted .325; by day, .215. The Red Sox's rookie first baseman
Carlos Quintana has been batting .400 when he comes to the
plate with two outs. But that statistic, Mr. Waseleski
concedes, "only means something to me, Carlos and his mom."</p>
<p>Mr. Waseleski is in tune with the times. The passion for
baseball statistics has exploded in the past few years,
partly because of the popularity of fantasy leagues in which
opponents "draft" players to create teams whose probability
of success is determined statistically. Managers and players
themselves also use computers to compile statistics.</p>
<p>How much the mastery of statistics helps real players play
or fans understand the game still is questionable. "You can
understand all the statistics available and it doesn't help
all that much," says Roger Angell, who writes about baseball
for the New Yorker.</p>
<p>But for Mr. Waseleski, a confirmed bachelor, statistics
are life. After work on a typical summer evening, he plunks
himself down in a recliner and clicks on his 25-inch color
TV. (During West Coast games, the videocassette recorder is
on, in case he falls asleep.) He keeps his computer keyboard
on his right knee and a clipboard and hand-drawn scorecard on
his left. He records every pitch and how it ends -- in a
swinging strike, a called strike, a ball, a foul, a hit or a
fly-out. He is supposed to feed his landlord's cat. The cat
will wait until the game is over, and the dishes will remain
unwashed.</p>
<p>Like many other New Englanders, Mr. Waseleski became
hooked on the Red Sox in 1967, the "Impossible Dream" season
in which the team unexpectedly won its first pennant in 21
years. While at Merrimack College in suburban Boston, he
regularly went to Fenway. After graduating magna cum laude
with a B.A. in English, he returned home, found a job as a
technical writer with Douglas G. Peterson Associates, an
engineering firm in nearby Greenfield, and spent his spare
hours collecting ever more complete statistics.</p>
<p>Through a friend he met Boston Globe sportswriter Peter
Gammons, now of ESPN, who wanted information unavailable from
the box scores, such as measures of clutch-hitting prowess.
Among other things, Mr. Waseleski proved that slugger Jim
Rice (contrary to fan misconceptions) was a clutch hitter --
in 1982, for example, batting .304 in late-game clutches.</p>
<p>A Red Sox pitcher interested in personal computers heard
about Mr. Waseleski and introduced him to other players, who
asked to use his statistics in salary negotiations. Now, Mr.
Waseleski knows half the players on the team.</p>
<p>During the season, Mr. Waseleski publishes his statistics
in a monthly report that is sold to sportswriters and
players' agents. Off-season, he sells reports on individual
players to agents for use in negotiating salaries. Neither
Mr. Waseleski nor his customers will say how much they pay
him.</p>
<p>Mr. Waseleski's devotion to his task takes some of the fun
out of it. He dreads high-scoring contests and extra-inning
games; they keep him up late. He likes games in Fenway
because, he has found, there are "substantially fewer"
extra-inning games there than in other ball parks. He
welcomed the three-day break for the All Star Game, of which
he watched only one inning.</p>
<p>Mr. Waseleski's masterpieces have been his documentation
of the performances of two Red Sox's greats, third baseman
Wade Boggs and pitcher Roger Clemens. When Mr. Clemens set a
record by striking out 20 Seattle Mariners in a game four
years ago, Mr. Waseleski produced nine dense pages of
statistics on the game: how many of the victims went down on
three straight strikes (five); how many hit more than one
foul ball (four), and how many of the three hits in the game
came after two strikes (two).</p>
<p>Mr. Boggs is known as an extraordinarily disciplined
hitter who almost never swings at a first pitch. Two years
ago, when he hit a first pitch home run in Minnesota, the
phone in Mr. Waseleski's living room rang. He picked it up
and said "seven." The caller was a sportswriter who did in
fact call to learn how many first-pitch hits Mr. Boggs had
had that year. When Mr. Boggs pops out to the infield, Mr.
Waseleski knows it happened only 11 times all last year. And
when Randy Johnson of Seattle struck him out three times in
one game this year, Mr. Waseleski had the names of the three
pitchers who had previously accomplished that feat.</p>
<p>"If Boggs ever hits .400, Chuck will be on Letterman.
He'll be larger than life," says Dan Shaughnessey, a Globe
sportswriter.</p>
<p>Mr. Waseleski says he gets just as much pleasure out of
documenting other oddities: Little-known relief pitcher
Dennis Lamp went 2 2/3 innings per outing for the longest
average relief performances in the major leagues last year.
Marty Barrett had no strikeouts against lefties in 118 plate
appearances, and was the toughest player to strike out in the
majors, with only one in every 28 times at bat.</p>
<p>Mr. Waseleski isn't bothered at all by the single
statistic that haunts most Red Sox fans: zero World
Championships since 1918. "I honestly don't care where they
end up in the standings," he says. "Win or lose, I know I'm
going to be around for 162 (games), so it doesn't matter."</p>
<p>Never mind that the Red Sox have been struggling with
Toronto over first place in the American League's Eastern
Division in recent days. Mr. Waseleski is looking forward to
those out-of-town games in late August, when first place is
usually sewed up and, he says, no one else is paying
attention to the Red Sox any longer. "I feel like I have the
team to myself."</p>
