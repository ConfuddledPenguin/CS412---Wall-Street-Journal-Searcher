	<p class="article-leader">The nation's machine tool builders believe the outlook is
brightening somewhat, but there won't be any tangible
evidence in June 30 quarter profits.
   Earnings in the current period will be reduced by a lower
shipping rate caused by an order falloff that began a year
ago. Also, prices on machines shipped this quarter will
reflect the tough price competition in an industry that has
been hard-hit by foreign competition. Foreign producers and
their U.S. subsidiaries supply more than half the machine
tools purchased by U.S. manufacturers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Orders picked up in the second quarter from the dismal
levels of the January and February, and most producers say
they're receiving more inquiries and making more price
quotations. In fact, some producers felt optimistic enough to
raise prices selectively.</p>
<p>However, there's still a lot of discounting from list
prices, some industry executives say, which may largely
negate the announced increases for the next few months, at
least. And the healthier order pattern would have to continue
for another quarter before machine tool builders will boost
production rates.</p>
<p>Machine tools are complex, often computer controlled,
parts-making machines ranging from grinders and milling
machines to metal-forming presses. They shape most metal
parts during manufacture. Sales, therefore, depend on the
willingness of durable-goods producers, especially auto,
truck, aircraft and machinery makers, to invest in new
equipment.</p>
<p>About a year ago, many U.S. durable-goods manufacturers
began to worry about an economic slowdown that they feared
could turn into a recession. Understandably, they cut back
machine tool orders. There are exceptions, such as producers
of commercial aircraft, which have been ordering briskly
because they have long order backlogs that would carry them
right through an economic slowdown. And the oil field
equipment industry is making a modest comeback because of
higher oil and natural gas prices.</p>
<p>On the other hand, auto and truck companies, auto parts
producers and defense contractors -- all major machine tool
users -- have additional reasons for slashing orders. Many
defense contractors expect a gradual decline in sales for the
rest of the decade because the Soviet Union is far less
threatening than it was during the 1980s. And automotive
concerns have to sort out government-mandated fuel economy
and emissions regulations before deciding what vehicles to
tool up to manufacture.</p>
<p>Orders placed with U.S. machine tool plants in the nine
months ended March 31 were 23% below the comparable period a
year earlier, according to NMTBA -- The Association for
Manufacturing Technology, a McLean, Va., trade group. Figures
for the second quarter aren't yet available, but they will be
somewhat better, producers say. But shipments trail orders by
a month or so to more than a year, depending on the
complexity of the machines.</p>
<p>Exports have been a bright spot. Foreign sales in the
first quarter rose 26% from a year earlier, the NMTBA said,
and machine tool executives say export demand continues
strong in the current quarter.</p>
<p>As a result, results will be mixed. A few producers, such
as Hurco Cos., Indianapolis, that are heavily involved in
foreign sales are faring better than a year ago. Hurco's net
in the second quarter ended April 30 rose to 45 cents a share
from 40 cents on a 13% rise in revenue to $24.8 million. "Our
sales gains have come in Europe and Asia," said Michael K.
Campbell, senior vice president and chief financial officer.
"The U.S. was about even with a year ago."</p>
<p>Hurco specializes in small milling machines and machining
centers equipped with electronic controls that are easy for
an operator with little computer knowledge to program. About
half of this year's sales will be overseas, Mr. Campbell
said.</p>
<p>The company expects continued earnings gains in the second
half, bringing profit for fiscal 1990 to the area of $2 to
$2.10 a share, Mr. Campbell said. For fiscal 1989, Hurco
earned $8.2 million, or $1.70 a share.</p>
<p>However, Cincinnati Milacron Inc., the nation's largest
machine tool producer, continues to experience the same
problems that drove down first-quarter net. The company had
sharply lower profit in the first quarter because of reduced
shipments of its higher-margin products, such as plastics
injection molding machines, and higher shipments of certain
lower-margin machine tools. Foreign shipments rose, but for
Milacron, exports carry higher distribution costs, the
company said.</p>
<p>The same factors will depress second-quarter results, but
the company said it is optimistic about an improvement in the
second half. However, Milacron made a public offering of
three million common shares, which increased shares
outstanding 12% and will dilute second-half share earnings
gains.</p>
<p>Cross & Trecker Corp., another of the larger machine tool
companies, will do better in the June 30 quarter, its third
period, than a year ago, but it won't do well. The Bloomfield
Hills, Mich., concern reported a loss of $32.5 million for
the June 30, 1989, period, including a restructuring charge
of $21.3 million. The company won't flatly predict a profit
for the current quarter, but officials said Cross & Trecker
will do better than in the March 31 second quarter, when it
had a net loss of $976,000, or 19 cents a share.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Cross & Trecker narrowed its loss
for the six months ended March 31 to $4.8 million, or 55
cents a share, from a loss of $13 million, or $1.05 a share,
a year earlier. Sales slipped to $215 million, from $233
million. However, the company said the comparable sales
figure for the 1989 half, excluding discontinued units, was
$189 million. Cross & Trecker pulled out of several
businesses as a part of the restructuring, but didn't restate
1989 results to reflect those businesses as discontinued.</p>
