	<p class="article-leader">FORT WORTH, Texas -- Tandy Brands Inc. said it will spin
off one of its units early next year, creating a new,
publicly traded company under the name Tandy Brands
Accessories Inc.
   The specialty retailer said stockholders will receive one
share of Tandy Brands Accessories for each five shares of
Tandy Brands held, to be distributed "as soon as practicable"
after Dec. 31, 1990. The company said it has received a
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the new shares
will not constitute taxable income.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Carson R. Thompson, Tandy Brands chairman and chief
executive, said the spinoff will provide more focused
management for two distinct businesses, as well as provide
shareholders with more clearly defined investment vehicles.
Tandy Brands Accessories, for example, makes and sells men's
and boys' leather accessories and neckwear, whereas Tandy
Brands Inc. will continue operating Bombay Co., a chain of
270 stores selling specialty furniture and home accessories.</p>
<p>The Tandy Brands Accessories unit is expected to finish
the current fiscal year June 30 with about $25 million in
revenue, down from last year's $26 million, according to Mr.
Thompson. The Bombay division, however, is projected to have
revenue of $112 million, compared with $83 million in the
last fiscal year.</p>
<p>After the spinoff, shareholders of Tandy Brands Inc. will
be asked to approve a name change to The Bombay Company Inc.
The company will then include a new unit, Alex & Ivy, which
is scheduled to begin operations in September as a retailer
of European country-style home furnishings. Mr. Thompson will
continue as chairman and chief executive; the Tandy Brands
board also has named Robert E.M. Nourse president and chief
operating officer and has elected him to the board, expanding
the board to nine directors.</p>
<p>The board also named J.S.B. Jenkins president and chief
executive of Tandy Brands Accessories, and Stanley T.
Ninemire vice president and chief financial officer.</p>
