	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Buying stocks that have already moved up
vigorously may sound like a dumb strategy. But in the case of
semiconductor stocks this year, it could be a bright idea.
   Semiconductor companies have been among the market's
strongest industry groups so far this year, soaring 24%.
Nevertheless, investment pros who follow the industry closely
say the advance still has a long way to run.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To an extent, semiconductor companies are rising with the
computer industry, whose stocks are emerging from an
unsettling slump. But people buying more computers is only
part of the story. The computer makers are packing their
"boxes" with more microchips than in the past. And to enhance
performance, they are using fancier microchips that cost
more.</p>
<p>This trend gives the semiconductor industry three ways to
win: more boxes, more chips per box and more dollars per
chip. Because computers account for nearly half of all
semiconductor use, it adds up to a powerful case for the
bulls.</p>
<p>Other uses for microchips are diverse, and several of them
are growing. They include industrial-process control
equipment, military electronics, car dashboard displays,
consumer electronics products, and medical devices such as
hearing aids and pacemakers.</p>
<p>Joan Lappen, head of Gramercy Capital in New York, sees
semiconductors as a long-term growth area. "More
user-friendly computers depend on the development of more
sophisticated semiconductor chips," she says, "with ever more
processing capabilities stuffed into ever-smaller packages."</p>
<p>To be sure, the stocks aren't cheap. Motorola sells for
about 23 times the past 12 months' per-share earnings. The
multiple is 20 for Intel, 19 for Advanced Micro Devices, and
18 for Texas Instruments. (National Semiconductor has posted
losses during the period, so its multiple can't be
calculated.)</p>
<p>But analysts such as James L. Barlage of Smith Barney say
the multiples are reasonable because the industry's current
upswing is still in its early stages. Using estimated 1990
earnings, Mr. Barlage says, semiconductor multiples are about
typical of most stocks. Based on 1991 estimates, they trade
at a discount to the rest of the market. "I think we're about
a year into a bull market {for semiconductor stocks} that
will ultimately last three to five years," he says.</p>
<p>This year will be only so-so, analysts figure. Most expect
sales to be flat or perhaps 5% higher. Patricia Cox, who
follows semiconductor trends for Dataquest Inc. in San Jose,
Calif., thinks 1990 sales will decline about 3.5%, mainly
because of weak prices for memory chips.</p>
<p>But 1991 and 1992 look like solid years. Ms. Cox projects
sales growth of 16% in 1991 (about equal to the industry's
long-term trend), 21% in 1992 and 27% in 1993, which she
figures will be the cycle's peak year.</p>
<p>"I think there's plenty more to go" in the semiconductor
rally, says Jill Hauser, who follows the group for the T.
Rowe Price Associates family of mutual funds. "They were
ultra-depressed to start with." She suggests investors take a
toehold now and increase their holdings during the industry's
traditional summer doldrums.</p>
<p>"Individuals have to be pretty brave to buy these stocks,"
which are notoriously volatile, she says. "I think you tread
into the water now" by doing some initial buying. "You look
for that break in the summer to buy more and average down."
But she wouldn't wait until autumn because the stocks "move
so quickly."</p>
<p>In its mutual funds, T. Rowe Price holds Applied
Materials, Chips & Technologies, Linear Technology, Cypress
Semiconductor and Altera, among others. Applied Materials
makes equipment used to manufacture chips. It gets more than
50% of its business overseas, the bulk of it in Japan, and
the stock sells for a moderate 13 times the past 12 months'
per-share earnings.</p>
<p>Linear Technology and Altera are smaller companies with
specialized niches. Linear has a strong balance sheet, and
its growth has re-accelerated after a slow period, Ms. Hauser
notes. Altera is one of a group of what the industry calls
"fab-less" companies, the ones that don't own their own
production facilities. It designs programmable chips that can
be modified by the user.</p>
<p>Thomas Kurlak, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, is
encouraged because "orders in May broke out of a trend
they've been in for two years." For the 22 months through
April, he says, orders ranged from $1.1 billion to $1.3
billion. May orders were $1.38 billion.</p>
<p>He favors Intel and Motorola. Intel is riding high because
it makes a specialized chip used in personal computers that
are IBM-compatible. Motorola trades more on its cellular
telephone operations than its semiconductor manufacturing,
but Mr. Kurlak likes both businesses.</p>
<p>Smith Barney's Mr. Barlage also likes Intel. Its "revenues
and earnings are being driven very strongly by the transition
from 16-bit to 32-bit products," he says. A year ago, only
about 15% of new personal computers used 32-bit
microprocessors, but Mr. Barlage thinks the figure will rise
to 30% by year end and nearly 70% by the end of 1991.</p>
<p>Mr. Barlage also recommends Anthem Electronics, which
distributes specialized chips made by a number of small
manufacturers, and Altera.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Landle, a portfolio manager with
Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers, is another Intel fan. He
predicts Intel will earn $3 a share this year and $3.70 a
share next year, compared with $2.25 a share in 1989. The
Stovall firm runs a mutual fund in which each buy is paired
off with a short sale (a bet that a stock will decline) in
the same industry. In that fund, National Semiconductor is
the current short sale.</p>
<p>"It has a broad range of products, but not a huge market
for any of them," says Mr. Landle. He expects National
Semiconductor to have earnings of around 35 cents a share in
the fiscal year that began this month, in contrast to a loss
in the fiscal year just ended. But he says, "A large part of
{the} improvements have come not from new products but from
cost-cutting."</p>
<p>A National Semiconductor spokeswoman said operating losses
narrowed sharply in fiscal 1990, to less than $45 million
from $187 million the year before. She noted that the company
had record sales, and said, "You don't post record sales
without producing something that people want." She said the
company dominates some major markets, such as linear (analog)
chips and components used in local area networks that link
computers and workstations.</p>
