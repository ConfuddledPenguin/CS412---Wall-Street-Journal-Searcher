	<p class="article-leader">LONG GROVE, Ill. -- Kemper Corp. said it named Allan L.
Sher chairman and chief executive officer of its Bateman
Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. brokerage unit.
   Mr. Sher, 58 years old, has served as vice chairman of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. since January. The brokerage firm
Mr. Sher is leaving is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
proceedings, and virtually all its operations have been
liquidated.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kemper said Richard Capalbo, 43, chairman and chief
executive of Bateman since February 1988, resigned "to pursue
other interests." Mr. Capalbo couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>James R. Boris, chairman of Kemper Securities Group
Holdings, said: "Rich Capalbo and I just have different
management styles. We both came to realize that." Mr. Boris
said he expects Mr. Sher to "help us improve profitability"
at Bateman, which Mr. Boris said had operating losses last
year and so far this year.</p>
<p>Bateman, based in Los Angeles, is one of five regional
securities brokerage firms owned by Kemper, an insurance and
financial services firm. Late last month, Kemper said it
would take a $126.5 million charge to pare its brokerage
operations.</p>
<p>A Kemper spokesman said the chairman of its Blunt Ellis &
Loewi Inc. brokerage unit in Milwaukee resigned May 24, and a
successor hasn't been named.</p>
