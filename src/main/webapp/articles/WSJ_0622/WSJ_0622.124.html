	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- France's seasonally adjusted industrial
production index rose 1.4% in April from March but showed a
0.3% drop from a year earlier, the National Statistics
Institute said.
   The figure was much better than previous forecasts by
economists, who were calling for a flat result. But the
latest data were heavily influenced by one-time factors that
boosted energy production by 15.2% during the month, while
all other sectors showed flat or lower output.</p>
