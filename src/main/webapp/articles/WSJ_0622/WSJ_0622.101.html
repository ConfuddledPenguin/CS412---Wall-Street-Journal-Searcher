	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Japan, Switzerland and the U.S. ranked as the
world's three most-competitive economies, according to an
annual study by the World Economic Forum and the
International Institute for Management Development.
   The study, based on more than 300 criteria ranging from
tax structures to levels of social alienation, attempts to
rate countries according to how conducive they are to running
successful businesses. The study also included the subjective
but important measure of how much confidence business
executives had in the nations where they did business. Here,
West Germany, which placed fourth in the overall scoreboard,
ranked first -- apparently because of enthusiasm generated by
pending reunification with East Germany and investment plans
elsewhere in Eastern Europe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The survey compiled a separate roster for economies that
have recently industrialized. In this group, the top three
were Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Growth expectations appear to be the strongest in Asia,
with South Korea leading the category of "rising stars."
Another contender in this group was Ireland, which won high
scores for expected industrial growth. According to the
survey's authors, Ireland "is developing a Far Eastern
country profile, which is reflected in the optimism of Irish
entrepreneurs."</p>
<p>The survey's competitiveness rankings don't reflect the
difficulties international companies have breaking into
particular markets. Japan, which held the No. 1 ranking, is
considered one of the least-hospitable nations for foreign
corporations to invest in. The prominent position extended
Switzerland, where both the report's sponsors are based,
reflected the favorable tax policies there, along with
political stability.</p>
<p>The U.S. ranked first for its human resources, a category
that includes the age, skills and size of the work force. The
survey also showed that in 1986, 59% of U.S.
20-to-24-year-olds were enrolled in some form of higher
education. Ranking relatively low in this survey was Britain,
where only 22% of this age group took part in higher
education.</p>
<p>However, the U.S. came in sixth place in "future
orientation." In this category, which covers such items as
research funding and patents, Japan took first place.</p>
<p>In worker productivity, Sweden and Singapore claimed the
highest ranking, with Japan coming in second place, and the
U.S. placing third. Germany took fifth place in the
productivity rankings, France seventh and Italy ninth. Of the
seven major industrial countries, Britain showed the lowest
worker productivity: It ranked 16th of the 34 countries
included in the survey.</p>
<p>The study added several new categories this year. One was
a ranking of 23 countries according to how effectively they
prevented corruption. Here, Denmark and Singapore tied for
first place, while Italy came in 23rd. The U.S. fell close to
the middle, holding down the 13th place.</p>
<p>While the report said that national economic competition
is a reality, it warned that "obsessive" rivalry between the
U.S., Japan, and Europe would be destructive. This "triad,"
the report said, controls about 60% of the world's gross
national product, with only 15% of its population. Trade wars
could leave the rest of the world in the cold, it warned.
However, the report predicted that over time, such nations as
Mexico, India, Brazil and China would gather greater economic
clout.</p>
<p>Among the Eastern European nations, East Germany stands
the greatest chance for a successful transformation, the
study said, because of "the massive resource transfer" from
West Germany. The report gave Czechoslovakia and Hungary the
next best prospects. Poland got a gloomier review. "Having
the most tattered economy and being battered by a huge
foreign-debt burden, Poland's problem will be to ensure sheer
survival," the report said.</p>
<p>In a discussion of Japan's success, the report emphasized
the nation's persistence. It noted that, in the Japanese
view, Western business executives expect "too much too soon."
Contentment -- or perhaps complacency -- is slower coming in
Japan. The study cited a Japanese survey that found that 52%
of the new generation of Tokyo residents believed they were
living in an affluent society, compared with 70% of a like
group living in Los Angeles.</p>
