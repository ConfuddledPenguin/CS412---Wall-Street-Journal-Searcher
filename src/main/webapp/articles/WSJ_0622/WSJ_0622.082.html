	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Japonica Partners failed to get enough votes
to confirm its plan to reorganize Allegheny International
Inc., giving the current edge to a company-sponsored plan.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Joseph L. Cosetti said that in
light of the thwarted Japonica effort, the court would
"address its energy to the confirmation of the debtor plan."
Japonica, based in New York, proposed paying creditors about
$655 million in cash, much of it borrowed from banks.
Allegheny's plan would repay creditors with stock.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Still, Japonica, which has purchased enough bankruptcy
claims to give it more than 50% ownership of the reorganized
company, won't likely give up. If it can woo the company's
banks -- which rejected the plan by 62% -- with a sweetened
offer, Japonica could ultimately prevail.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is growing concern about Allegheny's ability
to finance its own reorganization plan. Allegheny's lenders
are concerned that the management team tapped to run the
reorganized company won't want to stay, given rival
Japonica's controlling stake. They are also concerned that
Japonica will appeal confirmation of the company plan. At the
same time, Japonica's lenders aren't finished conducting due
diligence and won't be ready to finance the group's plan for
another six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>Allegheny's senior unsecured creditors and common
shareholders also voted against Japonica's plan. However,
after the votes were cast, Japonica purchased $25.1 million
of the senior unsecured claims from a group of insurance
company holders.</p>
<p>Allegheny filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the
federal bankruptcy code in February 1988. The company has
presented 10 reorganization plans, the most recent one
approved earlier this year by all creditors except Japonica.
The court has indicated that it would invalidate Japonica's
blocking vote.</p>
