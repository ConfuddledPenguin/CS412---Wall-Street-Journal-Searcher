	<p class="article-leader">The long-running racketeering trial of Imelda Marcos has
shed surprisingly little light on whether the former
Philippine first lady was directly involved in illegal
activities. But it has done much to feed the mystery that
surrounds her.
   Is she the fragile defendant who breaks down at the
witness table, unable to go on? Or is she the indefatigable
"Madame" who leads her entourage through shopping sprees at
tiny Philippine stores in New York? Is she the quiet, forlorn
widow in mourning -- or the entertainer who belts out
requests to shouts of "More] More]" at a party celebrating
what would have been her 36th anniversary?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And, more to the point in the case, did she plunder the
Philippines of more than $200 million and illegally use the
money to buy up jewelry, art and real estate in the U.S.?</p>
<p>Closing arguments in the trial will begin Monday, and the
often-bizarre case is expected to go to the jury around the
end of June.</p>
<p>The federal prosecutors handling the case have presented,
through charts, documents and nearly 100 witnesses, a largely
circumstantial picture of alleged theft and fraud. But nobody
has testified that they saw Mrs. Marcos's hand in the cookie
jar.</p>
<p>Instead, Philippine bank officials and people involved in
the real estate investments have said it was merely their
understanding that the purchases were done at Mrs. Marcos's
bidding. Prosecutors claim that Mrs. Marcos knew that the
money used in the purchases was stolen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, defense attorney Gerry Spence, a flamboyant
Wyomian whose Western-style dress and country-lawyer demeanor
have stood out in the Manhattan courtroom, has tried to show
that Mrs. Marcos knew little about the way the money was
being invested.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Spence has maintained that the source of the
Marcoses' wealth can easily be accounted for, not by theft,
but by Mr. Marcos's discovery of an extraordinary gold hoard
supposedly hidden in the Philippines by a Japanese general
during World War II.</p>
<p>So far, the 11-week trial has been interrupted four times
by Mrs. Marcos's ailments. More recently, Judge John Keenan
recessed the trial for an early lunch last week when mention
of a purchase of Nautilus weight-lifting equipment for her
daughter Imee, allegedly with government money, sent Mrs.
Marcos's blood pressure soaring.</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry," she told her attorneys, through tears, as
she went to her personal nurse, waiting with a stethoscope.
Benjamin Cassiday III, one of her attorneys, later explained:
"There they are, talking about her kid's Nautilus equipment,
and all that . . . and it's very upsetting to her."</p>
<p>On trial with Mrs. Marcos is Adnan Khashoggi, accused of
helping her conceal ownership of the Manhattan real estate.
Mr. Khashoggi's lawyer, James Linn, conceded that his client
was in close contact with the Marcoses after they fled to the
U.S. in 1986. But Mr. Linn said the dealings had nothing to
do with real estate -- instead, he was trying to find a safe
port for a shipment of gold owned by Mr. Marcos, in return
for a share of it.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Linn has poked fun at his client for falling
for what sounds like such an incredible story, it may not be
as absurd as it seems. During a New York visit, Philippine
Solicitor General Francisco Chaves said investigators believe
they have tracked down the ship, although the gold was
already unloaded. He said President Corazon Aquino's
government is now trying to find the gold, which it maintains
was stolen.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marcos's comments and behavior have added to the
trial's bizarre side. Still in mourning for her husband,
Ferdinand, who died in September, Mrs. Marcos wears only
black clothes, simple jewelry and an unimpressive selection
of black shoes.</p>
<p>"I am the center of the crucifixion," she reportedly said
to a group of Filipinos in the courtroom around Lent. On
another day, during a break after a former banker testified
that Mrs. Marcos summoned him into her bedroom to discuss
money, she laughed as she told two visitors in the gallery:
"He's going into my bedroom -- Ferdinand must be jealous as
hell]"</p>
<p>In court, her attorney, Mr. Spence, has generated his own
controversy. The 61-year-old lawyer has clashed with Judge
Keenan regularly for asking improper questions of witnesses
and trying to introduce irrelevant issues. Mr. Spence has
become increasingly sensitive about reactions to his conduct.
After a reprimand from the judge, he met in chambers with
Judge Keenan and complained that people were laughing at him
"on the Aquino side of the courtroom." Mr. Spence, who wears
a rattlesnake-skin belt and western jackets -- but no suits
-- said the judge was giving the jury the impression that he
was "just a B.S. guy." The judge replied that he was taking
the matter too personally.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marcos created a more private stir at a party marking
what would have been her 36th wedding anniversary. At the
surprise party, reported in a local Philippine newspaper's
gossip column, Mrs. Marcos was also given a letter from her
husband, Ferdinand. The card -- which read: "To Imelda,
beyond death, I love you, Andy," signed with his nickname --
was written before he died and was kept secret from Mrs.
Marcos.</p>
<p>The main event, however, was a performance by Mrs. Marcos,
who took the microphone to sing "Feelings" and "Don't Fence
Me In."</p>
