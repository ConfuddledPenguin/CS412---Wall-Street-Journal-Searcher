	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service, citing Centel
Corp.'s "aggressive expansion of its cellular operations,"
lowered its ratings on about $1.2 billion in debt issued by
the telecommunications concern and two subsidiaries.
   The rating concern said the "capital expenditure
requirements, external financing burden, and earnings
pressure" accompanying Centel's cellular-telephone expansion
strategy will result in "increased business risk and debt
protection measures."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moody's added, however, that it thinks the cellular
telephone business "can provide Centel with considerable cash
flow and profit potential over the longer term."</p>
<p>Centel's first mortgage bonds, debentures and notes were
marked down to Baa-3 from Baa-1; its commercial paper rating
was reduced to Prime-3 from Prime-2.</p>
<p>The company's Centel Capital unit had ratings on its
debentures and notes reduced to Baa-3 from Baa-1, and its
commercial paper was lowered to Prime-3 from Prime-2.</p>
<p>Ratings on the company's Central Telephone Co.'s first
mortgage bonds were lowered to single-A-1 from double-A-2,
and its debentures reduced to single-A-2 from double-A-3.
Moody's said Central Telephone is entering a series of
regulatory hearings that may result in soft earnings
performance in the "intermediate term."</p>
<p>A Centel spokesman said the company is "disappointed" with
Moody's move. "We remain very optimistic about cellular and
its long-term potential," and will continue the expansion
effort, he said. The spokesman specifically disagreed with
Moody's markdown of the company's commercial paper, saying
that Centel's "short-term liquidity situation is strong,"
particularly after it recently boosted a revolving credit
agreement with lenders.</p>
