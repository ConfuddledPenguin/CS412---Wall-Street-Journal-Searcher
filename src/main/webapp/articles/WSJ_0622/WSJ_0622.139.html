	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute,
widely considered to be the discoverer of the AIDS virus, now
believes the virus needs an accomplice to become deadly.
   His theory may prove to be the loneliest scientific battle
of the French researcher's career.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dr. Montagnier believes a second infection by a microbe
called mycoplasma may turn the AIDS virus from a lazy
organism into a voracious killer of human cells. At a news
conference at the Sixth International Conference on AIDS
here, he said he hasn't performed certain tests that may be
important in proving his theory.</p>
<p>The scientist suggests that mycoplasma can be treated with
tetracycline-type drugs, perhaps allaying the effects of
acquired immune deficiency syndrome. He has published
test-tube studies supporting his theory.</p>
<p>Mycoplasma is a tiny bacterium that oozes around without
cell walls and causes one of the most common forms of
pneumonia. More than a year ago, Dr. Shyh-Ching Lo of the
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington said he had
discovered a second virus implicated in AIDS. It turned out
not to be a virus but a novel strain of mycoplasma.</p>
<p>Dr. Montagnier has cast his lot with Dr. Lo. He said he
thinks the accomplice mycoplasma acts directly to turn on and
rev up the virus, transforming infected people into people
with AIDS. "We think the difference between the slow,
low-reproducing virus we've isolated in {symptom-free}
patients, and the fast, high-reproducing virus in AIDS
patients, may be due to mycoplasma," he said.</p>
<p>At a question-and-answer session, Dr. Montagnier was asked
to suggest a dose of the antibiotic tetracycline. He said it
was "too complicated" to discuss.</p>
<p>Laurie Garrett, a reporter for Newsday, asked whether Dr.
Montagnier had checked his experiments to rule out the
possibility that mycoplasma wasn't directly accelerating the
AIDS virus, but only nudging the immune system to churn out
cell-growth factors long known to gear up AIDS infection.</p>
<p>"I haven't done that test," he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Montagnier's assertions about mycoplasma were met with
skepticism by one U.S. government official in an interview.
"It's hard for me to believe in it as a serious primary
pathogen. . . . I can't see it as the necessary co-factor"
for making AIDS a killer, said Dr. James Curran, head of AIDS
activities at Atlanta's U.S. Centers for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Though all hypotheses are still open, Dr. Curran said he
rather sees mycoplasma as a fellow traveler, "the equivalent
of a maggot."</p>
<p>At the AIDS conference, Dr. Montagnier received a
relatively minor speaking slot. The American Medical
Association stepped in to co-sponsor his news conference,
which drew AIDS activists, journalists, scientists and
community physicians.</p>
<p>Dr. Curran said, "Dr. Montagnier and Dr. Lo are
approaching each other on a limb. Dr. Lo was out there, but
Dr. Montagnier is crawling out to meet him."</p>
