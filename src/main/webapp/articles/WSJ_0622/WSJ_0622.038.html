	<p class="article-leader">ST. PETERSBURG -- Lenin must be turning in his mausoleum.
His hometown is leading the fight for the democratic Russia
he hijacked 73 years ago. A year from now Leningrad could
even have a new old name.
   A first-time visitor has no claim to expertise, but one
way to learn is to spend a few hours listening to Leningrad's
brave new democrats. Peter Gumbel, the Journal's Moscow
bureau chief and a real expert, said I should expect to hear
radical voices (by Soviet standards). He wasn't kidding. In
Leningrad these days, it's possible in a single afternoon to
meet social democrats, Christian democrats,
"anarcho-syndicalists" (libertarians), Russian nationalists,
and Greens -- and later that day to discuss the czar's glory
years with a neo-monarchist.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But this is no political Tower of Babel. At center stage
are committed, coherent reformers attempting to take power
from the Communist Party to yank Mikhail Gorbachev toward
democracy. These Democrats are wary allies of the populist
but enigmatic Boris Yeltsin in his battles with the
government. They're the Russians that Jim Baker and the U.S.
State Department never seem to mention.</p>
<p>I met with several of them, including a young radical
named Alexey Kovalyov. He's 26 years old, handsome,
articulate and he detests the communists. He and his wife
still live with their parents, while they wait the 10 to 15
years it takes to get their own apartment. Their flat is tiny
and dark, but the tea is hot and the conversation
illuminating. As an archaeologist out of Leningrad University
he could not find a job in his field. So he went to work as a
museum guide and revolutionary.</p>
<p>This March he ran with the Democratic Front that swept to
victory here in the first genuine election in Soviet history.
Of 380 seats in the city soviet (city council), democrats
took three-fourths. In Moscow, democrats took half. Reformers
also won big in Kiev, Lvov and many other cities. Suddenly,
the Soviet Union has leaders elected by real voters. (Mr.
Gorbachev settled for indirect election to the presidency by
the national Congress of People's Deputies, a third of whom
are Communist-appointed.)</p>
<p>One of the new leaders is the Leningrad council chairman,
Anatoly Sobchak, a lawyer and people's deputy who wows
national TV viewers with his calls for independent courts and
a nonpolitical KGB. Mr. Kovalyov is a Sobchak reformer.</p>
<p>These are my kind of Russians. Mr. Kovalyov wants private
property, free markets, and laws that apply to everyone
equally. Other reformers are less fervent free marketeers,
but the Swedish model seems to be the most socialism any
reformer can still tolerate. Mr. Sobchak talks of building a
new "civil society," subject to law and separate from
politics. Most democrats would let the Baltics and other
rebel republics go their own way. Economic progress matters
more to them than political dominance.</p>
<p>This week the Leningrad reformers are debating a "free
economic zone" -- trade with the Baltics, Finland or any
nation that is interested. But what if Moscow objects? "The
party didn't imagine a noncommunist mayor of Leningrad,"
laughs Alexander Schelkanov, the new mayor and reformer.
"That doesn't mean the people cannot do it."</p>
<p>All of which has the comrades at proletariat headquarters
glum. The communists still have the best offices in town, and
they still look good in special-order foreign suits, but they
lack the old Bolshevik elan. (It's an irony of socialism that
the scarcity it produces has made even the smallest foreign
symbol a sign of status; Lenin's revolution is being
subverted by the Lacoste alligator.)</p>
<p>Oleg Kuzin, the number two man for ideology, toes the new
party line about "reform" within socialism, but he's
defensive about it. He can't understand why his team was
wiped out in the March vote. Perhaps he hasn't met the taxi
drivers here who refer to communists as the "Russian mafia."
Of course, he also knows the party still controls the means
of production, as well as central Soviet government.</p>
<p>Mr. Kovalyov says democracy is now a political force in
the Soviet Union that won't go away. "It is important to
destroy the myth that Gorbachev is the only guarantee of
democracy," he says. Mikhail the Improviser will always head
for the political middle. Reformers must keep redrawing the
middle line until Mr. Gorbachev steps over it and endorses a
truly democratic system. Gorby still has another chance to
join the democrats at the 28th Communist Party Congress in
two weeks. The party may split and if Mr. Gorbachev sides
with the right wing, "that will be his last mistake. No one
will listen to him any more," Mr. Kovalyov says.</p>
<p>A democratic Russia, it is obvious enough, won't come soon
or easily. The communist apparat, the military, the extreme
nationalists -- none will hand over power without a fight.
Mr. Kovalyov may be naive about his prospects, but
revolutions are not made by pessimists.</p>
<p>Naive or not, these are the Russian patriots Americans
have long hoped might come to power. They want to complete
what Gorbachev started but is now hesitant to finish. A
democratic Russia wouldn't devote a third of its economy to
the military or donate $5 million a year to Latin dictators.</p>
<p>It makes sense when the reformers say that Western aid to
the U.S.S.R. should be linked to further democratic progress.
They understand, as some Americans do not, that the current
Soviet system is so corrupt it must be swept completely away.
Their goal is not to sustain or co-exist with Lenin's heirs,
but to bury them.</p>
