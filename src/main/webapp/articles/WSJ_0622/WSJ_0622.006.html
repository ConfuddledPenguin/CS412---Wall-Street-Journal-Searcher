	<p class="article-leader">Your May 18 editorial "Blaming The Voters First" ignores
the most frequently cited reason for nonvoting: not being
registered to vote. Nonvoters, when surveyed after the 1988
presidential election, said registration requirements were
the most significant reason why they did not vote.
Eighty-five percent to 90% of those who are registered do
vote in presidential elections.
   Registration requirements differ in each state -- in some
instances, from township to neighboring township -- and
procedures are often cumbersome, sometimes discriminatory.
What is needed is a fair, simple, uniform system of voter
registration nationwide.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The National Voter Registration Act," which passed the
House with strong bipartisan support in February and is now
before the Senate, would create a more accessible
registration system and encourage more Americans to vote. The
legislation, dubbed "motor voter" because of its inclusion of
automatic applications to register to vote with driver's
license applications or renewals, provides opportunities to
register at other public agencies as well as at motor-vehicle
licensing bureaus.</p>
<p>The costs to set up and administer "motor voter" and the
bill's other provisions have been minimal in the more than
half-dozen states that already have automatic applications
with driver's licensing. Those states report voter
registration is dramatically up with a manageable work flow
of applications year-round.</p>
<p>The League of Women Voters believes the act is a sensible
first step to reverse declining voter turnout. Arcane and
obscure registration procedures are a barrier to voter
participation that we can do something about. Government
should be in the position of helping citizens to vote, not
putting up roadblocks that keep people away from the polls on
Election Day.</p>
