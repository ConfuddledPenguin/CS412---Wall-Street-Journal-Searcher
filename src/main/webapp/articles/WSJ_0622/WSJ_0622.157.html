	<p class="article-leader">First Bank System Inc., Minneapolis, said it ended a
nearly nine-year old agreement to acquire Banks of Iowa Inc.
and plans to sell back to the Des Moines banking concern
550,197 Class B nonvoting shares for about $38 million, or
$69 a share.
   The 1981 agreement called for First Bank to acquire Banks
of Iowa for at least 1.5 times its shareholders equity, when
permitted by Iowa banking law, which at the time didn't allow
interstate acquisitions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both companies have gone through some big changes since
then, however. First, the depressed farm economy battered
nearly all Iowa banks. And more recently, First Bank itself
was hurt by some big bond and loan losses.</p>
<p>Interstate banking powers come to Iowa Jan. 1, and Banks
of Iowa said it plans to seek another buyer. With about $2.6
billion in assets and shareholders equity of $214 million at
March 31, it is the biggest bankholding company based in
Iowa.</p>
<p>Banks of Iowa common stock closed at $69.50, down 50
cents, in over-the-counter trading.</p>
