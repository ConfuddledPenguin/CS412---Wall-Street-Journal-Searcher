	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Chiquita Brands International Inc. said it
called for redemption on July 26 all of its outstanding 5.5%
convertible subordinated debentures due Feb. 1, 1994.
   Approximately $34.7 million principal amount of debentures
is currently outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company will pay $1,002.50 per $1,000 principal amount
plus accrued interest to the date of redemption (which
amounts to $26.736 per $1,000 principal amount). Interest on
the debentures won't accrue after July 26.</p>
<p>The debentures are covertible at the rate of $18.333 a
share or about 54.5 shares per $1,000 principal amount of
debentures.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Chiquita closed at $26.75, up 37.5 cents.</p>
<p>Based on the current market price of the company's capital
stock (which currently exceeds the conversion price by nearly
46%), the company said it expects debenture holders to
convert their debentures into capital stock prior to the
redemption date. The right to convert expires at 5 p.m. EDT,
July 26. If all of the debentures are converted, an
additional 1.9 million common shares will be issued. The
company said issuance of these additional shares wouldn't
affect the computation of fully diluted earnings per share
because the debentures have already been treated as converted
for purposes of this computation.</p>
