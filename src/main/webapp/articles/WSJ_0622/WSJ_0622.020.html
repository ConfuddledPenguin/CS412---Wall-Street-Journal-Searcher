	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- VEB Carl Zeiss Jena, the well-known East
German optical firm, is quickly learning the art of mergers
and divestitures as it braces for re-entry into the free
market.
   The company is seeking to sell its defense-optics unit to
a Western firm even as it prepares to merge with its
prestigious West German namesake, Carl Zeiss Oberkochen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The western Carl Zeiss company was created soon after the
division of Germany and has been separated from the original
Carl Zeiss based in Jena ever since. But earlier this month
the two companies announced plans to get back together.</p>
<p>Only a year ago, the moves by the eastern Carl Zeiss to
merge or divest would have been unthinkable.</p>
<p>"The solution we are looking for now naturally would have
been absolutely out of the question under the old regime.
That has all changed, and we have to be able to compete,"
said Thomas Pfarschner, deputy finance chief of the eastern
Zeiss group.</p>
<p>The Betrieb Gera defense-optics unit was formed in the
late 1970s after the East German government ordered Zeiss to
supply guidance systems and other sophisticated optical
equipment to Warsaw Pact armies. Its operations were top
secret. In the 1980s, Gera primarily produced laser-guided
aiming systems for tanks and portable target-finding
telescopes.</p>
<p>But the spirit of disarmament has taken a toll on the
unit. Defense orders slowed to a trickle by the end of 1989,
and Gera now needs Western help to shift to nonmilitary
production. The eastern Carl Zeiss estimates that next year
demand for Gera's defense-related products will drop to a
third of former levels, threatening the jobs of 3,145
employees unless the changeover comes quickly.</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers AG in Frankfurt, which is advising the
eastern Carl Zeiss on the sale, said talks are under way with
potential buyers from the U.S., Western Europe and Asia,
including Japan.</p>
<p>"Gera would be a real bargain for somebody looking for
production capacity in East Germany, including anything from
optics, to electronics and communications," said Salomon
Brothers' Stephan DuCharme. The eastern Carl Zeiss is open to
offers for a majority stake.</p>
<p>The Gera move is part of a larger plan to ensure the
survival of the eastern Zeiss after the reunification of the
two German economies. Roughly a third of East Germany's state
corporations, known as Kombinates, face the threat of
bankruptcy after German monetary union in July introduces a
hard currency and an open market. The eastern Carl Zeiss is
banking on its famous name and its a future linkup with its
West German sibling, but it also is feverishly streamlining
its bulky operations.</p>
<p>Since the end of communist rule in East Germany late last
year, change has come quickly to the eastern Carl Zeiss. Few
employees lament the ouster last December of Wolfgang
Biermann, the group's general director since 1975. A
dedicated communist and a ruthless taskmaster given to
humiliating his managers, Mr. Biermann increased the
company's work force to 69,000 from 40,000 during his 14-year
tenure to fill government production requirements. Innovation
suffered as old equipment aged without replacement.</p>
<p>The eastern Zeiss, now run by Mr. Biermann's former
deputy, Klaus-Dieter Gattner, already has decided to
discontinue its production of cameras, which it was forced by
the communist regime to begin in 1986. The company also has
decided to start getting most basic parts it needs from
outside suppliers; its current operations are weighed down by
the production of rudimentary materials, including its own
metalcasting in the group's forge.</p>
<p>"Everything now is being restructured and consolidated,"
said Mr. Pfarschner. "We want to focus entirely on our core
technologies for the world market. But the changes also are
part of the intention of the two Zeiss companies to come
together in the future."</p>
<p>Like thousands of other state-owned East German companies,
the eastern Zeiss also is preparing to become a public stock
company. The letter of intent signed by the two Zeiss
companies calls for them to merge operations within the next
four years.</p>
<p>Despite their future plans and common origin in Jena
(dating from 1846), the two Zeisses still treat each other as
two wholly different companies.</p>
<p>The western Zeiss in Oberkochen, for example, wasn't
consulted by its East German counterpart on its plan to spin
off its defense optics unit.</p>
<p>"This is something that still affects another company,"
asserted Wolfgang Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the western Carl
Zeiss in Oberkochen. "Even though we are in talks to come
together, any decision to sell part of their operation is
theirs alone and doesn't warrant comment from us."</p>
