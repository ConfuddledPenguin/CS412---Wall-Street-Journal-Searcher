	<p class="article-leader">Henley Properties Inc., Hampton, N.H., said it expects
second-quarter net income of about $80 million, or $3.83 a
share, compared with a pro forma $4.8 million, or 23 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   The real estate holding company also said it expects to
report shareholders' net equity of $230 million at the end of
the quarter, up from $145 million on a pro forma basis a year
earlier. Henley Properties was spun off from Henley Group
Inc., also based in Hampton, last December.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both the earnings and equity gains result mainly from
accounting adjustments involving two trash-to-energy plants
owned by Henley Properties and operated by Wheelabrator
Technologies Inc. under a sale and lease-back arrangement.
Henley Properties said it expects to sell the plants for $10
million to Wheelabrator this month. Thus, about $100 million
of deferred income treated as a liability on Henley
Properties' balance sheet will be eliminated, boosting net
equity. Wheelabrator said the deal isn't expected materially
to affect its second-quarter results or balance sheet.</p>
