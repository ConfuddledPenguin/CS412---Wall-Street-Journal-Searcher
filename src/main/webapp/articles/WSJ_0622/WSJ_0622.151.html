	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The yen was the loser as Asian investors moved
their money from the low-yielding Japanese currency to the
British pound and Australian dollar, both buttressed by high
domestic interest rates. The flow of international capital
left the U.S. dollar higher against most other major
currencies.
   The market's devotion to interest rate differentials among
nations stems from a recent lack of clear exchange-rate
trends. Its propensity for non-dollar cross-trading has
increased as dealers seek to exploit momentary profit
opportunities in an unfocused market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Some are of the opinion that the summer market has begun,
which is very appropriate," because summer began yesterday,
said Carol Callanan, assistant vice president for Credit
Lyonnais in New York.</p>
<p>But Ms. Callanan said talk of summer doldrums really
should wait until after German monetary union takes effect
July 1.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market lacks "guts" amid political
changes around the world, said Peter Connelly, foreign
exchange manager for Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, so
participants are taking refuge in short-term cross-trading
positions.</p>
<p>In Asian trading, Japanese investment trusts and life
insurance companies were seen buying Australian dollars and
British pounds with yen. Both the Australian dollar and the
pound are attractive because of domestic interest rates of
15%.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar reached an intraday high of 79.10
U.S. cents by midday in New York after crossing two
resistance levels.</p>
<p>In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6778
marks, down from 1.6785 marks late Wednesday in New York. The
U.S. currency also was changing hands at 154.80 yen, up from
153.93 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.7200, down from
$1.7215.</p>
<p>At midmorning in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading at
154.90 yen; it closed Thursday in Tokyo at 154.60 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6770
marks, down from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.6780 marks.</p>
<p>Pat O'Brien, chief dealer for Australia's State Bank of
Victoria in New York, said Thursday that the Australian
currency's appeal spread to other currency sectors throughout
the global day. "With the problems in Canada, a lot of people
are taking the money they once put in the Canadian dollar and
moving into the Australian dollar and the pound," he said,
referring to Canada's constitutional dispute over Quebec.</p>
<p>Sterling also benefited from yen selling, but its gain
against the dollar was halted in Asian trading at $1.7265. By
the end of the global trading day, the pound had given up all
its early gains against the dollar and more.</p>
<p>The British currency continues to be aided by speculation
about the U.K.'s entry into the exchange rate mechanism of
the European Monetary System.</p>
<p>The proposal Wednesday by U.K. Chanchellor of the
Exchequer John Major for a "hard" European currency unit was
interpreted by the foreign exchange market yesterday as
showing new seriousness about European cooperation.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $350.70 an ounce, up 20 cents. Estimated
volume was a light 1.7 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at $349.75 an ounce.</p>
