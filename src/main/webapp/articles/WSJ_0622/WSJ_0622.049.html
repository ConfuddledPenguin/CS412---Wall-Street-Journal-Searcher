	<p class="article-leader">When a top investment banker at Kidder, Peabody runs
around with a suitcase of $125,000 in cash from Ivan Boesky,
he has every right to feel guilty. Martin Siegel has atoned
by singing to the SEC and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani. We
worry that innocent people -- and more importantly, vital
economic institutions -- will get trampled in the rush to
clear consciences.
   -- WSJ editorial, February 1987.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Martin Siegel, who was sentenced last week to two months
in prison, was a true inside trader. He stole information
from investment banking clients. He traded the tips to Ivan
Boesky in exchange for suitcases containing $700,000 in cash
commission. These are easily recognized crimes, but the
punishment didn't fit the crimes. Instead, prosecutors begged
the judge to go easy.</p>
<p>Mr. Siegel, they said, "deserves to be rewarded
substantially" for his cooperation. Judge Robert Ward gave
him a token sentence of two months. Meanwhile, prosecutors
hope Michael Milken will receive five years or more for pleas
almost certainly coerced by the threat of RICO.</p>
<p>The Siegel case ends on a rather bizarre note. It appears
we have just witnessed the extension of a reward for someone
who apparently fed only false information to prosecutors.</p>
<p>Recall that Mr. Siegel's contribution to justice was
fingering the trio that came to be known on Wall Street as
the Giuliani Three -- Robert Freeman of Goldman, Sachs and
Mr. Siegel's former underlings at Kidder, Richard Wigton and
Timothy Tabor. After two years in legal limbo, all the
original charges against them were dropped.</p>
<p>To be fair to Mr. Siegel, it's the prosecutors who say he
was the source for the case against Messrs. Freeman, Wigton
and Tabor. Indeed, the sentencing memorandums from Mr. Siegel
and the prosecutors suggest that the two sides are fighting
over who gets the blame for the hapless case against these
three.</p>
<p>Lawyers for Mr. Siegel wrote that he "had no notice of, or
input into, the government's decision to arrest" the three.
Their memo says the "affidavit on which the arrest warrant
was based . . . contained certain misinformation seemingly
attributed to Mr. Siegel." Prosecutors disagreed. Their memo
said, "On the basis of information provided by Siegel, the
government arrested all three on complaints charging them
with participating in the information-swapping scheme."</p>
<p>Whatever the details of what he said, we are prepared to
believe that prosecutors were anxious or suspicious enough
that they were happy to exaggerate Mr. Siegel's information.</p>
<p>And whether the problem was Mr. Siegel's search for
information to peddle or Mr. Giuliani's own ambitions, the
prosecutors' memorandum admits that prosecutors brought the
case without checking Mr. Siegel's claims. Prosecutors said
it was only after the arrests that "errors" were corrected
when there was "an opportunity to review public record
information about the various deals." In other words, no one
bothered to check the public record before busting the
bankers. A little more care would have avoided several
charges alleging that information, which was already publicly
released, was inside information.</p>
<p>Mr. Siegel no longer claims, if he ever did, that Mr.
Wigton and Mr. Tabor did anything wrong. He does still say
that he and Mr. Freeman traded inside information. We have
been skeptical, partly because prosecutors decided not to
bring Mr. Freeman to trial. Instead, Mr. Freeman reached a
controversial accommodation with prosecutors based on a
conversation about which ironically Mr. Freeman and not Mr.
Siegel was the source. Mr. Freeman pleaded to a mail fraud
count based on Mr. Siegel telling him, in reference to a
troubled takeover, "Your Bunny has a good nose."</p>
<p>We are left to wonder why, if Mr. Siegel had a Boesky-like
information-swapping system with Mr. Freeman, he had to speak
in Bunny riddles. We also wonder whether prosecutors would
have insisted on a plea from Mr. Freeman if they didn't feel
they had to get something out of their indictment. Mr.
Freeman, who was never accused of conspiring with Mr. Boesky,
faces a four-month sentence.</p>
<p>As we have said before, proportionality took a back seat
in many of the white-collar prosecutions in the 1980s. For a
universally recognized crime, Mr. Siegel gets about 60 days.
Meanwhile, prosecutors looking into practices for which
public officials adamantly refuse to provide bright-line
standards of behavior discovered technicalities that helped
undermine important institutions such as Drexel Burnham
Lambert and junk-bond departments up and down Wall Street.</p>
<p>One purpose of law enforcement is to make clear what is
right and wrong behavior. To see, at the end of this long
saga, prosecutors arguing that a genuine inside trader
deserves the lightest sentence suggests that the law
enforcement officials themselves weren't at all clear about
the rationale for their labors.</p>
