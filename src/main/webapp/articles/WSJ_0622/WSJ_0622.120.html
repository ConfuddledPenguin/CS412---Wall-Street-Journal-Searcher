	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices closed higher on the strength of
a late rally, attributed to end-of-quarter buying by
institutions and futures-related buy programs. Trading was
subdued.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which spent most of the
session drifting at lower levels, moved back above the 2900
level by gaining 6.43 to 2901.73.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Today represents the end of the second quarter for many
money managers. Under normal procedures, any trades made
today would be settled next Friday, the final session of the
quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts cited "window dressing," or last-minute
adjustments that institutions make with an eye toward
presenting the best possible quarterly reports to clients, as
a major factor fueling the market's late recovery.</p>
<p>Buy programs tied to stock-index arbitrage, in which
traders purchase baskets of stocks and sell index-futures
contracts in order to profit from the price differential
between them, also surfaced near the close to give stocks a
boost.</p>
<p>The arbitrage buying helped offset earlier waves of sell
programs, which had knocked back the market at the opening
and again at midday. The industrial average hit bottom with a
loss of about 20 points.</p>
<p>Trading activity has been sluggish all week, and the
latest session continued that pattern. Some 138,570,000
shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange, compared
with 137,420,000 Wednesday.</p>
<p>Advancing issues led decliners on the Big Board by 774 to
696. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index rose 1.37 to 360.47,
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index gained 0.65 to
196.49 and the Dow Jones Equity Market Index went up 1.11 to
335.33.</p>
<p>The Big Board's list of most active issues included a
number of stocks that have recently been under pressure,
including:</p>
<p>-- United Telecommunications, which dropped 1/4 to 39 in
Big Board composite trading of 1.5 million shares. The stock
moved lower last week after PaineWebber reduced its earnings
estimates for the second quarter and 1990.</p>
<p>Its latest fall took place as American Telephone &
Telegraph put a price plan into effect that allows it to
offer special rates to individual customers in response to a
competing proposal by another carrier. AT&T rose 1/2 to 43
5/8.</p>
<p>-- Occidental Petroleum, which rose 1/8 to 25 7/8 on 1.3
million shares after trading as low as 25 1/4 during the
session. Standard & Poor's downgraded its ratings on the
company's debt earlier this week.</p>
<p>-- Limited Inc., which slid 5/8 to 22 3/4 on 1.1 million
shares. Retail sales have fallen in each of the past three
months, and apparel sales have been especially sluggish,
sparking concern about earnings prospects for those
companies.</p>
<p>Another issue to slide in active trading was Du Pont,
which said it has allocated funds for the design of four
plants that would produce alternatives to
chlorofluorocarbons. The stock fell 1 to 38 1/8 on 1.1
million shares. Du Pont said it expects to spend more than $1
billion to develop and produce the alternatives, including
$240 million already invested and additional projected costs
over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>American Cyanamid rose 1 1/4 to 57 1/8 after agreeing to
sell the household-products business of its Shulton unit to
Clorox for $465 million. Analysts told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report they expect Cyanamid to use the sale proceeds
mainly to buy back common stock; Leonard Bogner of
Prudential-Bache Securities estimated that the company would
purchase about five million of its 94.4 million shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Cyanamid acknowledged that the company
is considering a buy-back, but added that it hasn't yet made
a decision to proceed. Clorox tumbled 1 3/4 to 42 1/8; the
company estimated that the acquisition would dilute its
earnings by 30 cents to 40 cents a share in the first year
and 10 cents a share in the second year.</p>
<p>Johnson & Johnson advanced 2 to 66 5/8 after the Food and
Drug Administration approved the use of Levamisole, a drug
made by the company's Janssen Research Foundation to treat
advanced cases of colon cancer in combination with another
drug. Separately, Dean Witter Reynolds increased its
estimates of the company's 1990 and 1991 earnings.</p>
<p>Upjohn, which climbed two points Wednesday on takeover
speculation, eased 1/4 to 41 7/8 as 1.5 million shares were
traded. Schering-Plough and American Home Products had been
mentioned as possible suitors; both declined to comment, as
did Upjohn.</p>
<p>Equifax, which agreed to acquire Telecredit in a stock
swap, tumbled 2 5/8 to 19 1/2. The company will exchange 2.69
of its common shares for each Telecredit share.</p>
<p>Delta Air Lines fell 1 1/4 to 75 3/4. Wertheim Schroder
lowered its investment rating on the stock, along with its
earnings estimates for the company's fiscal fourth quarter,
ending this month, and calendar 1990. Analyst Candace
Browning said lower-than-expected domestic air traffic will
affect its results.</p>
<p>VF retreated 2 1/4 to 25 following its forecast that
second-quarter earnings per share would be about 47% lower
than a year earlier, when it posted net income of 67 cents a
share.</p>
<p>Molecular Biosystems dropped 5/8 to 18 3/4. The company
said it expects to report earnings between 20 cents and 25
cents a share for the fiscal year ending next March, well
below most analysts' projections, as it emphasizes growth
over profits.</p>
<p>Caterpillar dropped 7/8 to 64 1/4 after Prudential-Bache
lowered its investment rating and 1990 earnings estimate,
citing weak orders for the company's large machines in May.</p>
<p>CPC International went up 1 1/2 to 80 1/4 and set a new
52-week high by peaking at 80 1/2. Michael Metz, a market
strategist at Oppenheimer & Co., told the investor report he
recommended the stock and said it "acts like it's under
accumulation" by a major corporate buyer.</p>
<p>Liggett Group added 5/8 to 11 3/4. The company said it
plans to restructure its tobacco and sports-marketing units
as separate companies and said it may repurchase as many as
one million of its common shares.</p>
<p>WMS Industries climbed 1 1/8 to 9 1/2. Newsletter writer
Charles LaLoggia commented favorably about WMS in a
television interview; he told the investor report it is
"reasonable" to consider the company as a possible takeover
target for Viacom. Sumner N. Redstone, Viacom's chairman,
holds a 28.9% stake in WMS.</p>
<p>Vishay Intertechnology declined 7/8 to 21 3/8. The
company, which has about 12.4 million common and Class B
shares outstanding, said it is considering a public offering
of two million common shares.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index dropped
0.59 to 360.22. Volume totaled 10,550,000 shares.</p>
<p>AT&E rose 1 1/8 to 22 5/8. Bell Atlantic disclosed that it
had accumulated a stake in the company and plans to purchase
additional shares; it declined to provide the size of its
holding.</p>
<p>Bolar Pharmaceutical, which said a lawsuit filed last week
by SmithKline Beecham would have a "material adverse effect"
on the company if the British-based firm wins the case, fell
3/4 to 5 7/8. The suit charges Bolar with fraud in obtaining
federal approval for a generic version of Dyazide,
SmithKline's blood-pressure drug.</p>
