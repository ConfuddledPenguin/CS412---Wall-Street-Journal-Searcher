	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc. paid
$30,000 to settle Chicago Board of Trade allegations that it
violated exchange trading rules.
   Under the settlement, the brokerage unit of Merrill Lynch
& Co., New York, didn't admit or deny the violations. The
CBOT said it had "reason to believe" Merrill Lynch floor
clerks disclosed "the possibility of a customer order" to a
trader for the company's Government Securities unit before
the order was initiated and entered in the trading pit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Prior knowledge of a big pending order can enable traders
to profit from the market effect of the order, and is known
as "front running."</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch said that it settled the action to avoid the
expenses of a protracted legal proceeding, and that it is
"confident that the trade at issue was executed competitively
and in a manner consistent with the best interests of our
customer."</p>
<p>In December, Merrill Lynch paid a $250,000 CBOT fine,
without admitting or denying the allegations, for executing
non-member trades as trades for the firm, a practice that
reduced the fees it paid the exchange. In that case, Merrill
Lynch also agreed to pay the CBOT "certain fees and
expenses," which one source said totaled $2.9 million.</p>
