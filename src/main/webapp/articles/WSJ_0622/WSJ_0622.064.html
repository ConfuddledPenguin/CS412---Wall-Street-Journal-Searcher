	<p class="article-leader">Santa Monica, Calif. -- At a recent auction of classic
aircraft here, I climbed onto the wing of a Curtiss P-40K
Warhawk to check out the cockpit. My pulse was racing, but
not from the climb. As a schoolboy during World War II, I'd
thrilled to newsreel footage of P-40 Flying Tigers shooting
down Japanese Zeros, doodled P-40s in class, even built a
solid -- i.e. non-flying -- model of a P-40, with a tiny
celluloid canopy and, pasted on either side of the nose,
red-and-white decals of the Flying Tigers' fearsome
dentition.
   This P-40 was flyable, as well as buyable by any bidder
with an itch to own a 47-year-old warplane that looked as if
it had just rolled out of the factory. The propeller-driven
fighter had been found in the Aleutian Islands in 1974 --
"the pilot's body was intact," a fact sheet noted -- and
restored to apparent perfection, right down to the rear-view
mirror above the canopy and the rudimentary gun sight, with
which the pilot -- still intact, for all I know, but not
included -- aimed the airplane to aim the guns.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As I jumped from the wing back down to the ground, a young
woman who had been admiring the P-40 smiled and said hello.
She was Japanese, perhaps in her mid-20s, and, according to
her press badge, a writer for a Japanese aviation magazine.
"Excuse me," she said in careful English. "Do you know why
those small Japanese flags are there?" Her eyes went first to
six little rising suns stenciled on the fuselage below the
cockpit, then to my face, which must have revealed my
astonishment. "Each one," I answered very carefully,
"represents one airplane . . . uh . . . shot down."</p>
<p>"Shot down," she repeated slowly. "Shot . . . down. Oh, I
see. Thank you very much."</p>
<p>A sense of history wasn't obligatory at the auction, but
it helped. And not just military history -- though that was
evoked by such works of martial art as a British Spitfire and
a twin-engined, twin-tailed Lockheed P-38 Lightning -- but
the history of aviation, which has produced some of the most
beautiful mechanical objects since the Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>A sense of wonder helped too, in the face of time-warping
treasures such as a gorgeous two-seater 1938 Curtiss Falcon
(serial No. 1) with red leather upholstery and intricate
patterns of riveted stitchery on dazzlingly polished aluminum
skin; a 1941 Ryan trainer, with sculptured wheel pants and a
birch-and-maple propeller; a 1918 Curtiss Jenny biplane, its
canvas wings held together by wire and hope; and a pristine
red-and-white Fairchild 24, first owned in 1939 by Mary
Pickford and Buddy Rogers and hardly flown since.</p>
<p>The auction, organized for the benefit of Santa Monica's
superb new Museum of Flight, was the brainchild of David
Price, a 57-year-old industrialist and pilot who also doodled
warbirds as a kid in school, and who grew up half a block
from the airport, which was then called Clover Field (after a
World War I hero named Clover; so much for bucolic
resonances). Recently Mr. Price built the Supermarine
complex, a huge aviation service facility at the airport that
houses the museum plus a chic restaurant called DC-3. (Clover
Field was the home of Douglas Aircraft during the war.)</p>
<p>"So far David has been carrying this museum," said Donald
Douglas Jr., who attended the auction. "Now we've gotta get
it off his back."</p>
<p>The two-day affair, which moved more than $7 million of
airplanes and memorabilia, went a long way toward relieving
Mr. Price's back strain; by every reasonable measure,
including fun, it was a resounding success. Fun may have been
the most sensible measure for many buyers. Jim Mills, an
Indiana aircraft-engine installer who bought Mary Pickford's
Fairchild for $40,000 (a record price for the model and also
a steal) extolled the pleasures of flying slow, rolling down
the window and sticking your elbow out into the slipstream.
"That's all these things are any good for anyway, havin' a
good time with."</p>
<p>Flying slow sounded equally good to Morgan Merrill, an
entrepreneur who lives in Aspen, Colo. He lusted after the
Jenny, which sold to someone else for $175,000, even though
he loves flying his own British-made, fire-engine red Folland
Gnat, a modern-day supersonic jet trainer, at speeds up to
Mach 1.3.</p>
<p>Fun for other people at the auction involved the calmer
pursuits of connoisseurship and stewardship. Delford Smith,
chairman of the board of Evergreen International, a large
aviation holding company, bought the P-40 for $750,000; a
DC3-built in 1936, and the oldest still flying -- for
$165,000; and a Corsair fighter, with inverted gull wings,
for a record $750,000. (Corsairs are comers in this market.)
Then, prompted by associates and advisers who knew of his
love for bare-metal airplanes, he bid on the glittering
Falcon and got it, for $335,000.</p>
<p>"We believe in preserving this heritage," said Mr. Smith,
who plans to find homes for his new acquisitions in various
museums. He also urged the Falcon's former owner, Richard
Durand, to call him any time he wanted to visit the airplane,
or even to use it. The gesture was appreciated by Mr. Durand,
who runs an aviation service company in Albuquerque, N.M.,
and who had sold because of what he called a "pretty rough
business climate for us now." But it didn't make the parting
any less sorrowful. "Don't leave it out in the rain," Mr.
Durand told Mr. Smith on the flight line, while his wife
fought back tears.</p>
<p>The high point of the auction was the sale of the P-38
Lightning, one of six still flying throughout the world. For
one thing, this illustrious airplane, newly painted in attack
black, had been bought and restored by the Museum of Flight,
and was the museum's main chance for earning big bucks. Most
importantly, the Lightning seemed an irresistible symbol of
this country's sovereignty and creativity at a time when
foreign competition has been calling both into serious
question.</p>
<p>When the bidding began, the crowd rooted for William Lyon,
a 67-year-old retired Air Force general who'd made his
fortune in real estate and airlines, and against an
unidentified rival, represented, via telephone hookup, by
City National Bank of Los Angeles. The rival might have been
from St. Louis or Staten Island, but was instantly assumed to
be Japanese, so the crowd cheered when the bidding finally
ended with Mr. Lyon taking the trophy for a record $1.55
million. They cheered for the general, for the museum and for
the nation, which had brought the Lightning into this world
in 1939 and could now, by God, hang onto it.</p>
