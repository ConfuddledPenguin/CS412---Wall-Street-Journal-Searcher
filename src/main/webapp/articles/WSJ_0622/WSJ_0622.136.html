	<p class="article-leader">DURHAM, N.C. -- Liggett Group Inc. said it is dividing its
business into two subsidiary companies and renaming the
parent company.
   The tobacco company also said that Bennett S. LeBow was
elected chairman, succeeding William Weksel. Mr. Weksel said
his resignation is connected to the restructuring of BSL
Partners, a New York-based partnership consisting of himself
and Mr. LeBow. BSL Partners owns a majority interest in
Brooke Partners L.P., also based in New York, which in turn
controls Liggett.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Liggett said its president and chief executive officer,
K.V.R. Dey Jr., will retire effective June 30. A spokesman
said any decisions about Mr. Dey's successor will be left to
the board.</p>
<p>Liggett, which will rename itself Brooke Group Ltd., said
it will separate into Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co. and Impel
Marketing Inc. The former will be renamed Ligget Group Inc.
after the parent completes its name change.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said the moves are designed to allow
the two subsidiaries to focus on their respective businesses:
tobacco products, and sales and marketing of sports and
entertainment products. Moreover, changing the name of the
company, Liggett said, will enable it to expand into other
businesses.</p>
<p>Liggett & Myers Tobacco's headquarters and manufacturing
facilities will remain in Durham, together with its
administrative and factory personnel. Impel Marketing will
also have its headquarters in the Durham area.</p>
<p>Liggett also said it may periodically purchase as many as
one million of its common shares in the open market, in
private transactions or otherwise, depending on market
conditions.</p>
