	<p class="article-leader">SAN JOSE, Calif. -- A federal court jury here awarded
damages of $18.5 million to the city of San Jose in its
lawsuit against two brokerage houses and an auditing firm
that the city blamed for a $73 million bond-market loss six
years ago.
   Including interest, the award totals almost $30 million.
Previously, the city settled out of court with 11 other
brokerage firms for $12.1 million. The jury verdict,
following a six-month trial, included a $9.3 million judgment
against Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis Inc., and an $8.7
million judgment against E.F.Hutton Inc. The jury also
ordered Price Waterhouse & Co., the auditing firm, to pay
damages of about $500,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its suit, the city contended that the brokerage firms
led the city into engaging in risky and speculative
transactions while lending the city money to undertake those
transactions.</p>
<p>The deals involved so-called reverse repurchase
agreements; city traders, instead of taking losses on
long-term bonds, used those bonds as collateral to borrow
from its brokers to buy more bonds in hopes of recouping
losses. Seven city employees were fired as a result of the
bond fiasco.</p>
<p>The jury also determined that Price Waterhouse was
negligent in failing to report the loans by the brokerage
houses in its city audits. The city argued that such a report
would have alerted city officials to the growing bond losses.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for PaineWebber Group Inc., the New York
securities firm, declined to comment. Jackson & Curtis was a
predecessor of Paine Webber.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., also a New
York securities firm and successor to E.F. Hutton, said the
firm doesn't "believe the facts justify this ruling and we
will ask the court to set aside the verdict. We also are
considering an appeal."</p>
<p>Price Waterhouse's attorneys, Heller Ehrman White &
McAuliffe in San Francisco, said: "We had said all along that
the accounting was appropriate but that in any case the
losses were substantially attributable to the city's
inattention to what was going on, not to any accounting or
auditing failure." Under the law, the attorneys said, the New
York accounting and consulting firm will benefit from any
settlements paid by other defendants in the case, and it may
not have to pay even the $500,000 award.</p>
