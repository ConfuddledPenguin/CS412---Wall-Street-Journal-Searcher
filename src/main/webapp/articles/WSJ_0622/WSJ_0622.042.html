	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan said he believes banks haven't cut back lending to
the point of inducing a "credit crunch" and he asserted that
"enough credit appears to be available" to fuel growth in the
economy.
   "All things considered, continued modest economic growth
remains the most likely outcome," Mr. Greenspan told the
Senate Banking Committee.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The committee's hearing, called to consider mounting
anecdotal evidence that banks have tightened lending
standards in response to a slowing economy and tougher
regulation, didn't resolve a dispute between regulators on
one side and business groups and some lawmakers on the
others. In recent weeks, many business groups have complained
that banks have grown so tight with credit they are cutting
off creditworthy borrowers and aren't willing to back viable
projects.</p>
<p>Some congressmen, particularly from New England, are
concerned the regulators may be exacerbating the economic
slowdown. "I have become convinced it's partly because of
overzealous regulation," said Sen. John Kerry, (D., Mass.).</p>
<p>Bank regulators reiterated that they are simply making
banks set aside needed reserves for losses and that banks
should continue making loans they believe will perform. "It's
the banker's job to find the good loans and to make them,"
said Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke.</p>
<p>The regulators maintain that the broad slowdown in lending
in New England, and the nationwide reluctance to lend for
real estate construction projects, is a healthy response to
lax lending standards over the past decade.</p>
<p>In recent days, however, mixed signals on the issue have
been coming from the Bush administration. While the Treasury
has played down concerns about tight credit, two members of
President Bush's cabinet, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and
Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher, have said they
believe the credit crunch is more widespread.</p>
<p>"Especially hard hit have been small and medium-sized
businesses, since these businesses tend to rely heavily on
bank loans for their financing," Mr. Mosbacher said in a
statement yesterday following up on comments he made last
week to the Banking Committee. "These businesses include many
small producers of the technologically advanced products and
services that are of growing importance to our international
competitiveness." Mr. Mosbacher didn't say what he thought
was causing the credit squeeze.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan, for his part, argued that there is no
general lack of credit for creditworthy borrowers. The Fed
chairman did say that banks "unquestionably have made credit
less available" for mergers and restructurings but said the
restraint was probably warranted, considering the "rapid
leveraging of many corporations" in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Still, while "lenders are generally not retreating from
lending opportunities," Mr. Greenspan said, "significant
problems cannot be ruled out in the period ahead, and we will
continue to devote close attention to credit conditions."</p>
<p>Speaking more broadly about the economy, Mr. Greenspan
said it is "puzzling" that unemployment has not gone up
despite the slowing of economic growth in the past several
months. Labor force growth has slowed, but the Fed isn't sure
what's behind that, Mr. Greenspan said.</p>
