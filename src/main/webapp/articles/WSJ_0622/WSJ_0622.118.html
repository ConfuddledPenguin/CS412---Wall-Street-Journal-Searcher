	<p class="article-leader">BIG VENTURE CAPITAL partnerships grow while others find
pickings lean.
   New Enterprise Associates, which already manages $470
million in venture capital funds, last week raised another
$200 million from such investors as Chicago's Brinson
Partners and the pension fund of American Telephone &
Telegraph Co. And Canaan Partners, Rowayton, Conn., raised
$200 million this month to add to the $240 million it already
manages.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The venture partnerships mostly are "getting their money
from pension funds who want to have a small portion of their
assets in venture capital," says a San Francisco
institutional investor. "The pension funds are playing it
safe by going with the large ones."</p>
<p>But the big funds also have been able to separate
themselves from others with specific strategies. New
Enterprise, for example, has adopted a national investment
strategy, establishing a network of regional and
industry-specific "feeder funds" to provide candidates for
investment, says Richard Kramlich, a New Enterprise managing
partner. Canaan is focusing on providing capital for
expansion and acquisitions of small companies.</p>
<p>Still, most funds formed in the '80s will face an uphill
struggle raising new money, investors say. "Their prior funds
haven't fulfilled their promise," says Anthony Hoberman, head
of venture capital investing for Alliance Capital Management
Inc.</p>
<p>Only a handful of recent deals have produced returns
comparable with a Genentech or Apple Computer, he adds.</p>

<p>A RECENT SECURITIES rule could give small firms a new way
to raise money.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission's 144a rule, which
was approved in April, could allow small entrepreneurial
companies to raise capital cheaply and effectively, says
attorney Joseph Bartlett, partner in Gaston & Snow, New York.</p>
<p>Under the rule, institutions with investments of $100
million or more can buy and sell previously restricted,
privately placed stocks and bonds. In effect, more investors
could be interested in the restricted shares of small firms
because they could be traded more easily. Restricted shares
have restrictions on trading, commonly delimiting the
category of buyers or the minimum period the stock must be
held.</p>
<p>Mr. Bartlett and others think that small companies,
especially those that already have some revenues or are
profitable, could significantly benefit from the rule. "It
would allow them to sell stock cheaper and faster and perhaps
with less potential liability," he says. The liability risk
in issuing these stocks is reduced because the buyers are
so-called sophisticated investors, he notes.</p>
<p>These investors include pension funds, insurance companies
and banks -- concerns that traditionally have acquired stock
in closely held businesses through venture capital pools but
increasingly want to buy stock directly. Still, for the rule
to really have an impact on closely held concerns, investment
bankers will have to make a market in the 144a stock. That
means they must put up their own capital to provide a trading
market, says Mr. Bartlett.</p>
<p>The test for 144a for smaller entrepreneurial firms will
be whether there are enough qualified institutional investors
willing to buy and sell these shares, says Edward Smith,
managing director of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.</p>

<p>KEY INVESTMENTS in computer-related businesses slip.</p>
<p>Venture capital placed in computer-related businesses
declined 38% in the first quarter of 1990 to the lowest
quarterly total in five years, says Technologic Computer
Letter, an industry newsletter in New York. Such capital is a
major source of funding for new technology concerns.</p>
<p>Only $225 million went to computer-related venture deals
in the first quarter of 1990, compared with $362 million a
year earlier, the newsletter notes. The decline follows a
year in which investments in computer ventures were flat.
Computer-related ventures received $1.24 billion in 1989,
compared with $1.26 billion in 1988.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurs aren't successfully exploiting new
technology ideas, venture capitalists contend. "There's only
been a small increase in new concepts. Most entrepreneurs
keep churning out the same old ideas," complains Westport,
Conn., venture capitalist Stewart Greenfield.</p>
<p>"Venture capitalists aren't seeing the deals or the
quality of deals they like," says Richard Shaffer, editor of
Technologic. And having been burnt by over-competition in
areas such as disk drives, computer systems and personal
computers, "they're resisting the me-too company," adds Mr.
Shaffer.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some venture capitalists believe the decline
could have some benefits for entrepreneurs. "The few
companies that do get money now will get more money and
attention," promises one East Coast venture capitalist.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>AN IRS VICTORY in a real estate partnership case troubles
venture capitalists.</p>
<p>A U.S. tax court recently ruled that an individual who
receives a "carried interest" in a partnership is required to
pay taxes on projected profits at the time he receives that
interest rather than when he actually pockets the gains. Many
investment partnerships grant a carried interest -- an
interest that the partner doesn't pay for -- to help
compensate partners who manage the program. The tax court
decision could affect partnerships beyond the real estate
field, tax attorneys say.</p>
<p>Most experienced tax lawyers previously believed that
there was little risk of a general partner's owing taxes on
profits that haven't been earned, says attorney James Dreyfus
of Fulbright Jaworski & Reavis McGrath, New York.</p>
<p>Even though a 1974 court case established a precedent for
collecting taxes on projected carried-interest profits, the
Internal Revenue Service had never attempted to apply it.</p>
<p>"If they begin to enforce the {new} ruling, it will take a
lot of the financial incentive out of forming such
partnerships," Mr. Dreyfus says.</p>
