	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Bell Atlantic Corp. views its joint
acquisition with Ameritech of New Zealand's Telecom Corp. as
a base for expanding operations in the Pacific, said Raymond
W. Smith, Bell's chairman and chief executive officer
   Mr. Smith characterized the $2.5 billion purchase as "a
very important strategic move for us." Noting the economic
vitality of the Pacific Rim region, he said Bell Atlantic is
exploring possible business opportunities in such countries
as South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and
Australia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an interview, Mr. Smith also indicated that the New
Zealand telephone operation, which already has a mostly
digital network, could become a hub for providing corporate
telecommunications services to the region. He noted that New
Zealand makes an attractive base for many reasons, including
its location in the region, its stable democratic government
and its English-speaking population.</p>
<p>This week, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech filed court papers
seeking a waiver from U.S. District Judge Harold Greene to
permit the two Bell companies, as owners of New Zealand's
Telecom, to retain their interest in long-distance phone
traffic between New Zealand and the U.S.</p>
<p>Hyde Tucker, president of Bell Atlantic's international
unit, said that, without such a waiver, New Zealand's
long-distance phone circuits will have to be reorganized at a
cost of as much as $10 million. He expressed hope that Judge
Greene would respond to the request quickly.</p>
<p>Armed with about $550 million in available cash at the end
of the first quarter, Bell Atlantic has been on an
international shopping spree. This month, for example, the
company has teamed up with US West Inc. of Denver; the two
have been selected to build a cellular telephone system and a
public data network in Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Bell Atlantic's Mr. Smith said business opportunities for
the company in the Pacific Rim area could range from
consulting and operating-system contracts to acquiring part
or all of country phone systems that may be privatized. He
declined to identify specific targets or disclose the
progress of any ongoing talks. But he noted that Bell
Atlantic recently signed a "memorandum of understanding" with
the government of South Korea regarding possible joint
ventures.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith also acknowledged that Bell Atlantic's recent
successes in landing the New Zealand and Czech business
ventures have the effect of reducing the likelihood that his
company would also take on the purchase of another large
national telephone system, such as those of Mexico and
Argentina.</p>
<p>Peter Troughton, who will remain Telecom's managing
director and chief executive, said the New Zealand company's
total work force has been slashed recently to about 16,000
employees from a peak level of about 26,500. He predicted
that the total would be reduced to about 12,000 over the next
two years.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year ended March 31, Telecom earned $148
million on revenue of about $1.3 billion. Profits were
reduced by heavy capital spending on network improvements.</p>
<p>Mr. Troughton didn't make any predictions about how
profitable Telecom could become, but he said he doesn't see
why it should be "any less profitable" than the regional Bell
companies, including Ameritech and Bell Atlantic.</p>
<p>Until the late 1980s, New Zealand's telephone company was
government-owned, heavily regulated and generally regarded as
a poor performer in responding to consumer needs. For
example, the network frequently "crashed" and went dead in
the middle of a business day because network capacity was
inadequate. Moreover, customers typically waited up to eight
minutes for a dial tone, and about 50% of
directory-assistance queries weren't answered correctly.</p>
<p>But many improvements have been made in the past two
years. Indeed, the agreement last week to sell Telecom to
Ameritech, Bell Atlantic and two New Zealand companies
represents a sustained effort by the government to address
such market needs by taking the phone system private.</p>
<p>Mr. Troughton noted that the company has realized strong
growth in demand for telephone services, since rates on toll
calls were cut 50% and international-call prices were also
reduced substantially.</p>
