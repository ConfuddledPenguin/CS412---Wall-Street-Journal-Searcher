	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL -- South Korea is considering the establishment of a
stock futures market in the near future.
   The Korea Stock Exchange has recently formed a task force
to study the possibility of setting up a stock futures market
to stabilize the stock market, according to stock exchange
officials.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shin Poong-Ho, a manager at the stock exchange's task
force, said they have long studied the possibility to prepare
for the forthcoming liberalization of the local capital
market.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1992, foreign investors will be allowed to
invest directly in South Korean stocks. Foreigners now invest
in the local stock market through indirect channels, such as
country funds or equity-related bonds.</p>
<p>Mr. Shin cautioned, however, that it will take a lot of
preparation to set up a stock futures market in South Korea
since the country now lacks preconditions for such a system.
South Korea doesn't even have a commodity futures market yet,
he commented.</p>
<p>Sohn Chon-Kyun, a professor at the Korea Banking
Institute, said the local stock market isn't mature enough to
allow stock futures trading. "The investment pattern is still
too volatile and the market is too distorted to allow such
trading," Mr. Sohn said.</p>
<p>He added, however, that quantitatively the local stock
market and its trading volume are big enough to have such a
system.</p>
<p>In his recent report on the possibility of a financial
futures market in South Korea, Mr. Sohn said stocks would be
the most probable choice for South Korea at the moment if it
decides to introduce a financial futures market. Bonds and
foreign exchange could follow stocks, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Sohn proposed that any Korean stock futures market be
modeled after the Japanese one. The Japanese style is more
suitable for South Korea in that it is more conservative than
some other models, he said. South Korea wouldn't have to set
up a separate stock futures market, but could use the current
stock market for stock futures trading, he said.</p>
