	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Communications Commission
ordered the nation's local telephone companies to cut the
access rates charged to long-distance companies by $1.1
billion, a move that will give consumers a break on their
long-distance bills.
   The reductions in the year starting July 1 -- $696 million
more than the local companies proposed in April -- apply to
the rates that long-distance companies pay for the
origination and termination of interstate phone calls. The
FCC estimates that interstate-access revenues total about $19
billion annually.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An American Telephone & Telegraph Co. spokesman said the
company is studying the FCC order and plans to expand the
$160 million in rate cuts scheduled to take effect July 1. He
said it was too early to say how much of a savings customers
will see, but emphasized that "this means more reductions for
consumers and small businesses."</p>
<p>Spokesmen for MCI Communications Corp. and United
Telecommunications Inc.'s US Sprint Communications unit said
their companies would remain competitive with AT&T. In the
past, most access-charge reductions have been passed along to
long-distance customers.</p>
<p>The FCC said its common carrier bureau found that
inaccurate projections of demand and costs would result in
excessive returns for local phone companies. The agency
figured that by underestimating the likely demand for
service, the local companies would have collected $105
million more than they should have.</p>
<p>The bureau slashed more than $289 million in access costs
after finding that many local phone companies forecast
"unusually high growth rates in their costs without providing
adequate explanation or justification." It said it cut an
additional $302 million for other inflated costs. Further,
the agency said that some phone companies made exorbitant
forecasts of depreciation expense.</p>
<p>In an interesting twist, the commission found that several
Bell companies had misallocated lobbying expenses to
operating-expense accounts in 1989, wrongly passing on
several million dollars of lobbying costs to phone-company
customers. The agency cited Ameritech, BellSouth Corp., Nynex
Corp. Pacific Telesis Group and Southwestern Bell Corp. The
agency said that although the Baby Bells "are entitled to
engage in lobbying, the commission's rules make clear that
associated expenses must be excluded from rate-making."</p>
<p>Don Evans, MCI's director-technical regulatory affairs,
said, "We're excited that the FCC investigated lobbying
expenses, but I hope this isn't the end of it," he said.
"This is only the interstate part and only what local
exchange carriers admitted to."</p>
<p>MCI had asked the FCC to investigate whether the Bell
companies were lobbying Congress at customers' expense.
Washington-based MCI made its request earlier this year after
the Bells earmarked $21 million -- $3 million apiece -- for
an enormous campaign to persuade Congress to ease
restrictions in the consent decree that broke up the Bell
System. The decree bars the Baby Bells from providing the
content of information services, manufacturing
telecommunications gear and providing long-distance service.</p>
