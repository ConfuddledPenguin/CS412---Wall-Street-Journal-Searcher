	<p class="article-leader">In regard to William Fulton's May 8 editorial-page
article, "Can Anything Stop Los Angeles?": In 1983 I was
transplanted to the west end of the San Fernando Valley, and
I've witnessed an incredible metamorphosis of the area.
Development has been, shall we say, rampant.
   I believe there is a very affirmative yes to Mr. Fulton's
question as to whether the continued sprawling of Los Angeles
will ever cease. It has to do with one little precious
commodity called water.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Fulton correctly describes the economic effects of the
housing bonanzas in the valleys adjoining the San Fernando.
He aptly notes that areas such as Mojave and Rosamond are
next. But he and the developers are living in a fool's
paradise by failing to consider the impact these new projects
will make on available drinking water. It is a desert out
there and we are running out of water here.</p>
<p>Los Angeles is finally catching up with its northern
cousins and moving to water rationing. Areas such as Santa
Barbara now have strict policies on water usage and
consumption. Reclaimed water is being used -- however, this
will surely not be enough for the demand required in these
newly developed areas.</p>
<p>Los Angeles, the San Fernando Valley and most of Southern
California are going to have to face the music and ratchet
down the laissez-faire attitude toward unchecked development.
The leaders here have truly been living in La La Land with
regard to meeting basic human needs for open recreational
space. If the developers want to develop, then LA's
government leaders should be giving them incentives to
improve what is already here with more parks, a reliable mass
rail system and better drinking water. Los Angeles doesn't
need more condos, strip malls or freeways. It needs active
leadership.</p>

<p>Mr. Fulton's article reveals how current public policies
are immeasurably cruel to the poor.</p>
<p>Basic food is cheap -- five pounds of rice cost $2. Used
clothing is cheap in thrift shops. Many poor people can even
afford cheap used cars. But the cost of housing has been
artificially raised in many areas. This dreadful shortage of
housing is not an act of nature, like a shortage of rain, but
is the direct result of deliberate, purposeful zoning and
"growth restrictions." Once this is done, "subsidized
housing" is promoted as a sop to the poor.</p>
<p>We forget that the best way to ensure a good supply of
cheap used cars for lower-income people is just to keep on
building cars. The same is true of housing. The poor never
lived in new housing or drove new cars -- they moved into the
houses that wealthier people moved out of when new housing
was built. While at one time suburbs were towns in their own
right, containing a cross section of people from rich to
poor, many such suburbs now are wealthy bedroom communities.
The governments of such communities are legally able to
restrict housing and push up the price of homes to $325,000.
But would we tolerate a policy of the middle classes and the
wealthy to restrict production of food and clothes, to push
up the price of rice to $5 a pound, the price of a shirt to
$100, just so more lower-income people could come to
"subsidized" thrift shops and soup kitchens?</p>
<p>Zoning and growth restrictions should be abandoned; they
reflect the legal enforcement of the wishes of those who have
a place to live, not those who need a place to live. Local
governments should vigorously build roads, schools, parks and
public utilities to keep up with where people want to live --
not to restrict them.</p>
