	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. said a
discount package of long-distance services went into effect
for Resort Condominiums International after the Federal
Communications Commission allowed a suspension period to
lapse.
   The FCC had suspended the special discounts for the
vacation time-share company in January while the commission
investigated the legality of cut-rate custom-tailored
packages. At the time, the agency said it was also
investigating an equivalent offer from MCI Communications
Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The FCC could still declare the AT&T offer, known as
Tariff 15, illegal, but the decision to let the suspension
expire signaled that the agency may allow AT&T to offer
special discounts to meet competition.</p>
<p>"We find it very exciting because we fought so hard for
it," said Joseph Nacchio, AT&T vice president-marketing for
business communications services. Nevertheless, he
acknowledged that he would have preferred an affirmative
decision from the agency. The tariff for Resort Condominiums
was originally filed nine months ago.</p>
<p>The company has made about six other filings under Tariff
15, including discount services for CBS Inc., PepsiCo Inc.,
and La Quinta Motor Inns Inc.</p>
