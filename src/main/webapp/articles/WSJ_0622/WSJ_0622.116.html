	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- William Seidman, chairman of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., was in satisfactory condition in
Santa Fe, N.M., yesterday following surgery for a separated
hip.
   Mr. Seidman, who also heads the government's
savings-and-loan cleanup efforts, was injured in a
horse-riding accident at his ranch in Santa Fe Wednesday, the
agency said. He was in New Mexico delivering a speech to
banking executives. Mr. Seidman yesterday had to bow out of a
scheduled appearance before the Senate Banking Committee to
discuss bank-lending standards.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It wasn't clear how long he would be in the hospital, but
an FDIC spokesman said it would probably be at least several
days. "I knew he was OK when I heard he ordered a fax machine
and a private telephone line in his room," the spokesman
said. Mr. Seidman is widely expected to leave his posts in
autumn.</p>
