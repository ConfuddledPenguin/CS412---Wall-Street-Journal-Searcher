	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled the First Amendment
doesn't make the news media immune from libel lawsuits based
on statements of opinion.
   The high court said opinions expressed in newspaper
columns and editorials and in television and radio
commentaries are entitled only to the constitutional
protections that the news media already receive for stories
based on facts, and not more.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Writing for the court, Chief Justice William Rehnquist
said many expressions of opinion will still have
constitutional protection. The high court, he explained, has
previously ruled that those who file libel lawsuits against
the news media must be able to prove that the disputed
statements were wrong; it is difficult, if not impossible, to
prove that statements that are clearly opinion are wrong.</p>
<p>Given the other protections that are afforded the news
media, Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe said, "The
absence of a general immunity for opinions is not terribly
threatening."</p>
<p>But the ruling was seen as a significant defeat to some
lawyers who represent the news media in libel actions and
other First Amendment matters. Robert Sack, a New York lawyer
who represents Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street
Journal, said newspaper editorial pages "are going to be less
free to say what they have to say." He said that lawyers who
review newspaper articles before they are published to avoid
possibly libelous statements will no longer be able to ignore
the editorial pages.</p>
<p>Mr. Sack also said the ruling will likely cause the news
media to face more libel trials; until now, media lawyers
have been successful in asking judges to dismiss lawsuits
based on statements of opinion.</p>
<p>In justifying the decision, Chief Justice Rehnquist noted
that libel law is intended to protect the reputation of
individuals, not merely the airing of ideas by the news
media.</p>
<p>Technically, the vote was 7-2, with Justice William
Brennan dissenting, joined by Justice Thurgood Marshall. But
although the dissenters didn't join the majority opinion,
they said they agreed with the court's conclusion that there
is no special libel exemption for opinion statements. Their
dissent was based on the court's application of this
principle to the facts of the case.</p>
<p>The case, which now returns to an Ohio court for a trial,
is a 15-year-old dispute pitting the former high school
wrestling coach in the Cleveland suburb of Maple Heights
against the Lake County News-Herald, published by Lorain
Journal Co., a unit of Community Newspapers Inc. After a
melee at a wrestling match, state athletic officials
disciplined the team, but a judge overturned the sanctions in
1975. The News-Herald ran a story saying the coach and local
school superintendent lied to the judge.</p>
<p>The case bounced up and down in the state courts,
including two prior appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court, but an
Ohio appeals court finally ruled that the statements were
opinions that were absolutely immune from libel lawsuits.</p>
<p>The high court said the accusation that the coach had lied
is a statement that can be proved or disproved at a trial.
Justice Brennan's dissent argued that the statements were
like conjecture that can't be disproved, and that there was
no reason for another trial.</p>
<p>The high court's ruling, Mr. Sack said, contradicts the
position adopted by virtually all of the 12 federal appeals
courts in the country and by three-quarters of the state
supreme courts -- that statements of opinion can't form the
basis of libel lawsuits.</p>
<p>Mr. Sack also said that the decision may chill the free
speech rights of persons who speak publicly, not in the news
media, at town meetings or protest rallies, for example
accusing local companies of polluting waters. Those people
may be more susceptible to libel lawsuit, he said. (Milkovich

<p>State Gas Lawsuits</p>
<p>The justices ruled 5-4 that states may not sue in behalf
of consumers to recover overcharges that public utilities
were charged by their suppliers of natural gas and that the
utilities passed through to their customers in the form of
price increases. The decision, written by Justice Anthony
Kennedy, rebuffed the arguments of Kansas, Missouri and 32
other states.</p>
<p>The high court ruled that only the utilities themselves
are legally considered injured parties under federal
antitrust law. The states and consumers are indirect
purchasers with economic injuries too ambiguous to allow
antitrust liability, the court said.</p>
<p>Missouri and Kansas officials were seeking the right to
sue several producers of natural gas in Wyoming and an
interstate pipeline company for alleged overcharges in the
sale of gas to three retail gas distributors.</p>
<p>The producers, Amoco Production Co., an Amoco Corp. unit,
and Cities Service Oil & Gas Corp., an Occidental Petroleum
Corp. unit, and the pipeline, Williams Natural Gas Co., a
Northwest Energy Co. unit, were initially sued for alleged
overcharges by the retail utilities, Kansas Power & Light Co.
and UtiliCorp United Inc. The lawsuit alleged that the
overcharges were the result of price-fixing.</p>
<p>A federal court dismissed the lawsuit by the states,
leaving the claims by the utilities in place. A federal
appeals court in Denver said the retail companies, not the
states, were the proper parties to file the lawsuit.</p>
<p>After the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal, Kansas
Power & Light dropped out of the case.</p>
<p>The high court upheld the appeals court ruling yesterday.
Justice Byron White dissented, joined by Justices Brennan,
Marshall, and Harry Blackmun (Kansas vs. UtiliCorp United
Inc.)</p>
<p>Court-in-Brief</p>
<p>In other action yesterday, the high court:</p>
<p>-- Ruled 7-2 that the Interstate Commerce Commission
doesn't have the legal authority to allow shippers of goods
and truckers to agree on rates that are lower than those
officially filed by the truckers. Federal law requires
truckers to formally file their rates with the ICC and to
charge those rates. The ICC, however, has broadly permitted
shippers and truckers to negotiate lower rates. The ruling,
written by Justice Brennan, reverses the decision of a
federal appeals court in St. Louis and is a major defeat for
the ICC. Justice John Stevens and Chief Justice Rehnquist
dissented. (Maislin Industries, U.S. Inc. vs. Primary Steel
Inc.)</p>
<p>-- Ruled 9-0 that nonprofit social clubs may not generally
offset investment income for federal income purposes with
losses incurred in sales of food and beverages to nonmembers.
Only when the sales to nonmembers were intended to make a
profit may a club claim the loss against investment income,
the court said in an opinion written by Justice Harry
Blackmun. (Portland Golf Club vs. Commissioner)</p>
