	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Nelson Mandela plans to reassure the American
business community today that a South Africa led by his
African National Congress would protect private investments.
   A number of business people and politicians have expressed
concern about talk within the ANC of nationalizing segments
of the South African economy as part of a plan to redress
inequities between that country's black and white
populations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a draft of a breakfast speech Mr. Mandela is scheduled
to give to business leaders at the World Trade Center, the
South African leader says, "We are sensitive to the fact that
as investors in a post-apartheid South Africa, you will need
to be confident about the security of your investments, an
adequate and equitable return on your capital and a general
climate of peace and stability."</p>
<p>All investors, he continues, "should know it as a matter
of fact that the investment they make today, whether in the
house they build, the child they educate or the savings they
put into a bank, is not likely to vanish tomorrow because of
some arbitrary government action or a social upheaval
generated by continuing social injustice."</p>
<p>In the draft speech, Mr. Mandela, deputy ANC president,
goes into no detail about the economy of a new South Africa.
He does say the economy will be mixed but adds, "we have no
blueprint as to the makeup of that mix."</p>
<p>More specific material on the ANC's vision for South
Africa's economy is contained in a document developed by
economists from the ANC and the Congress of South African
Trade Unions. The document says the first responsibility of
the new government would be to meet basic food, housing and
employment needs, and it asserts this should be done through
a policy of promoting economic growth, rather than
supplementing incomes.</p>
<p>Espousing positions not unlike those of the Republican
Party in the U.S., the ANC paper calls for battling
impoverished conditions by "creating new production capacity
through employment linkages rather than in the form of simple
income supplements." It also recommends imposing user charges
for some government services. The proposals were printed in a
newspaper edited by a top aide to Mr. Mandela.</p>
<p>The paper calls for a halt to current efforts by the South
African government to turn some industries over to private
ownership and to deregulate others. And it recommends "as a
matter of fundamental policy," that an ANC-led government
should be prepared to "renationalize privatized state
assets." That might refer, for example, to the transportation
industry, which until recently was state-owned but has been
privatized by the government of President F.W. de Klerk.</p>
<p>In a recent speech to corporate executives in
Johannesburg, Mr. Mandela said it is "eminently wrong" for
the government to restructure the economy "precisely at the
moment when the whole country and the world expect that
fundamental political change is in the offing. It would seem
only reasonable that so important a question as the disposal
of public property should be held over until a truly
representative government is in place."</p>
<p>In the Johannesburg speech, which was made available by
ANC officials, Mr. Mandela said it is a mistaken view "that
the only words in the economic vocabulary that the ANC knows
are nationalization and redistribution." He said these are
among "many issues" to be considered as South Africans
discuss "the democratization and deracialization of economic
power."</p>
<p>Mr. Mandela said a new South African government could
study antitrust laws in the U.S. and Great Britain "to
address the issue of how to ensure that there is no unhealthy
overconcentration of economic power."</p>
<p>The policy recommendations of the economists from the ANC
and the Congress of South African Trade Unions urge "a
leading role" for the state "in the reconstruction of the
economy." The current state of land distribution is a
"central national grievance," according to the document.</p>
<p>Both the recommendations and the Johannesburg speech say
that corporations in South Africa would have to bear a
greater tax burden. "The aim would be to reduce the burden of
direct and indirect taxation on sections of the community
least capable of looking after themselves," Mr. Mandela told
the South African corporate leaders, "and to shift more of
the load onto the corporate sector, without, of course,
producing a situation of diminishing returns."</p>
