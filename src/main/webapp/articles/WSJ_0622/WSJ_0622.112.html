	<p class="article-leader">BURBANK, Calif. -- Can an heir to the Magic Kingdom work
alchemy for companies whose fortunes have turned to lead?
   Roy E. Disney and the principals of his private investment
vehicle, Shamrock Holdings Inc., are hoping to do just that
with a $450 million partnership, Trefoil Capital Investors
L.P. (Trefoil is French for shamrock).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Disney, vice chairman of Walt Disney Co. and Walt's
nephew, joins the growing ranks of so-called "white squires"
trying to profit from rescuing companies whose appetite for
debt in the 1980s is devouring them in the '90s. The venture,
which stopped soliciting new funds and closed the partnership
last month, has already attempted bail-out deals with
Southland Corp. and Ames Department Stores Inc., people close
to those talks say. Those transactions didn't materialize.</p>
<p>The partnership intends to do "two or three deals," says
Stanley P. Gold, Shamrock's president and chief executive
officer and its chief strategist. The transactions would mark
the first major deals for the Shamrock principals since their
failed run at Polaroid Corp. two years ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Gold says Trefoil has "a couple of candidates under
the microscope" and should complete a deal by the end of the
year. Although he declines to identify candidates, he says
Trefoil would be looking at industries where Shamrock already
has experience, particularly "retailing, one area hard-hit by
the overleveraged situation." Shamrock owns the 71-store
Music Plus chain of music and video stores in Southern
California and the 140-store Sound Warehouse chain in Dallas.
It also owns 15 radio and three television stations, holds
about a 15% stake in oil field equipment maker Enterra Corp.,
and has various real estate holdings.</p>
<p>Shamrock quietly started bringing in partners for Trefoil
last fall, calling on investors from its prior ventures and
soliciting new money as well. Mr. Gold won't identify any of
the investors, except to say they include both big
institutions and private individuals, "but no pension funds."
The Shamrock principals take a 1% fee for managing the
partnership.</p>
<p>Though the amount raised for Trefoil is shy of the $500
million that Shamrock was seeking, "given the environment
that's out there, we feel very good to have been able to
raise $450 million," says R. Rudolph Reinfrank, a Shamrock
executive vice president who spearheaded the fund-raising
efforts.</p>
<p>The Shamrock partnership is entering an increasingly
crowded field of fund operators who specialize in offering
cash to companies in need. The new funds have taken a variety
of forms: Some, like the $1.6 billion Corporate Partners
organized by Lazard Freres & Co., buy into healthy companies
facing a particular cash need. Ironically, Corporate Partners
bought new Polaroid securities that helped the company elude
Shamrock's hostile overtures.</p>
<p>Other partnerships are raising money with the aim of
investing in distressed and even bankrupt companies. These
restructuring funds include one with a minimum goal of $500
million being organized by Goldman Sachs & Co. and another
for $750 million headed by Chicago investors Sam Zell and
David Shulte.</p>
<p>While overleveraged companies could provide many
investment opportunities in the 1990s, Shamrock has an edge
in that it has already secured financing amid what could
become a glut of proposed funds. Plans for a few white squire
funds, including one by LBO specialist Theodore Forstmann,
have been scrapped, and raising money for several other funds
is proving harder than expected.</p>
<p>Shamrock executives concede that they were drawn to the
idea of establishing their own white squire fund because it
makes a kitty readily available to them when they spot a
target. "It removes from us the need on a deal-by-deal basis
to focus on funding," says Robert Moskowitz, a Shamrock
executive vice president and corporate counsel.</p>
<p>The exact form Trefoil's investments will take will be
determined case by case, but most will be in the $50 million
to $100 million range, for deals ranging up to $1 billion or
more in size. Trefoil might acquire companies outright, or
inject capital in exchange for large stakes.</p>
<p>"We prefer going into a situation where there's strong
existing management, and we insert new equity into the
company," Mr. Gold says. "But there's no cookie-cutter
approach." The partnership has broad powers to pursue various
transactions, including leveraged buy-outs if the buy-out
market rebounds. The fund can also be used for hostile
takeovers, although Mr. Gold says he doesn't plan any.</p>
<p>One thing Trefoil won't be is a passive investor. "We
think we have some management talent to add to the
enterprise," Mr. Gold says.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Trefoil had an agreement to invest
"several hundred million dollars" in Southland, the
Dallas-based operator of the 7-Eleven chain, people close to
that deal say. But Southland instead opted to sell a 75%
controlling interest for $400 million to the Japanese
operators of its stores in Japan, Seven-Eleven Japan Co. and
Ito Yokado Co. Trefoil received a breakup fee from Southland.</p>
<p>Trefoil also approached Ames just prior to that retailer's
bankruptcy filing in late April, people close to Ames said.
Trefoil was to have provided debtor-in-possession financing
in exchange for an equity position in the company.</p>
<p>Mark Siegel, who heads Shamrock's media and communications
businesses, says that Trefoil is unlike other squire funds in
that "a lot of those investment partnerships feel a strong
need to do a certain number of transactions" because of the
fees generated. "We want to make a good investment. If we do,
everyone will profit."</p>
<p>Shamrock is generally credited with having a good track
record for investing. Mr. Disney formed the company in 1978
as an investment vehicle for himself and his wife, Patty,
bringing on Mr. Gold as the financial mastermind. In 1979,
they bought Staar Broadcasting Group Inc. and used it as a
base for Shamrock's extensive broadcasting operations. In
1985, Shamrock bought Central Soya Co., turned around
operations and sold the company two years later at a profit
of about $125 million. Though Shamrock failed to acquire
Polaroid, it earned a $40 million to $50 million profit on
its stock in the instant-camera maker, Mr. Gold says.</p>
<p>Mr. Gold and Mr. Disney also engineered the 1984 ouster of
former management at Walt Disney Co. and appointment of the
current team of Michael Eisner and Frank Wells, who have
brought the entertainment company quarter after quarter of
record earnings and allowed Mr. Disney to profit handsomely
on his stock holdings.</p>
