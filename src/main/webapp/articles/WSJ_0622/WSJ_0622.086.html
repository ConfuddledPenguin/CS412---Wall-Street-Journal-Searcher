	<p class="article-leader">John Maynard Keynes had a reputation for fickleness. A
British politician joked that when a Royal Commission asked
advice from five economists, it got six opinions -- two from
Keynes. So why should anyone be surprised that at the age of
39, after several affairs with men, Keynes fell in love and
married a petite woman?
   One initially might suspect that Keynes faked his
affection for Russian ballerina Lydia Lopokova in order to
settle into respectable British society. But the love letters
now reprinted in "Lydia and Maynard" (Scribners, 367 pages,
$24.95) will erase the suspicion that Keynes was faking it.
Keynes did not need to gain entree into high society. Before
he even met Lydia he held a tenured chair at Cambridge and
hobnobbed with London's rich, famous and titled.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Keynes's snobby Bloomsbury friends couldn't understand
what Keynes saw in Lydia. Rather birdlike in appearance, she
was not extraordinarily pretty. Lytton Strachey called her a
"half-witted canary." Her looks didn't even attract Keynes at
first, who called her a "rotten dancer -- she has such a
stiff bottom." In fact, Keynes first met her backstage after
a performance -- while he was searching for her more
attractive leading man.</p>
<p>The letters in this book, edited by Keynes's niece and
nephew, Polly Hill and Richard Keynes, show that Lydia turned
her biggest drawback, her poor English, to her advantage. She
charmed Keynes through malapropism, neologism and creative
spelling. An elegant and careful writer, Keynes delighted in
Lydia's remarks, such as, "I send you a chirp from under the
left breast."</p>
<p>To get even with the overeducated Bloomsbury friends,
Lydia referred to her divorce decree from a ballet manager as
a "degree" granted by the court.</p>
<p>The closing lines of Lydia's letters often are bizarre,
including "Mucous membrances to you" and "Gobbles of peaceful
order to you." In addition, while everyone else saw her as a
bird, Lydia apparently saw herself as a canine and signed her
letters "Your dog," "Your complete dog" and "Your true
underworld dog."</p>
<p>Though they show affection and devotion, Keynes's letters
disappoint. With his wit and charm, Keynes couldn't be boring
unless he tried very hard. In some of these letters he tried
pretty hard. He describes numerous administrative meetings at
Kings College. While I'm sure that the students of 1924 were
happy to hear that the college was adding two baths, readers
today probably will find that to be dull news. During the
early 1920s Keynes also acquired an intellectual curiosity in
ancient Babylonian weights. Lydia demonstrated her devotion
to Keynes by feigning interest in this hobby.</p>
<p>Although the details of Keynes's letters don't sparkle,
his dilettantism shines through. While juggling public
lectures, editing obligations at the Nation, lunches with
Churchill, investment advising, dinners with the Kings
College wine and musical committees, and Lydia's tax returns,
Keynes squeezed in some economics. Had Keynes been born 50
years later, he couldn't have kept up this schedule and also
excelled at economics, which has become too specialized for
nine-to-fivers, much less part-timers.</p>
<p>Keynes's dilettantism and his genteel Cambridge rearing
led him to promote bigger governments without warning that
strong incentives drive politicians and bureaucrats to expand
government programs endlessly. Keynes spent most of his days
with high-minded public servants and professors, most of them
educated at Oxford or Cambridge. He never asked, though,
whether the British intellectual aristocracy could fill all
of the positions he envisaged in a more interventionist
government.</p>
<p>Perhaps we can forgive Keynes's naive view of government.
After all, the British postal service would deliver Lydia's
letters from London to Keynes in Cambridge the same evening]</p>
<p>When Virginia Woolf called Lydia a "poor little parakeet,"
she couldn't imagine why Keynes would need an emigre
ballerina to fulfill his life. Woolf should have known that
Keynes reached out, intellectually and emotionally, for all
kinds of stimulation. Just as Great Britain had spread its
influence to nearly every culture and pursuit, so did Keynes.
Lytton Strachey composed a poem in tribute to Keynes's
farranging ambitions:</p>
<p>". . . Both penetrating and polite, a liberal and a
sodomite.</p>
<p>An atheist and a statistician, a man of sense without
ambition.</p>
<p>A man of business without bustle, a follower of Moore and
Russell.</p>
<p>One who, in fact, in every way, combined the features of
the day."</p>
<p>Since then, many have written about the witty and erudite
Cambridge don. While this collection adds to the literature,
the love letters between two people usually lose their luster
when exposed to outside eyes. A book like this makes one hope
that Milton and Rose Friedman are not planning to release
their most private correspondence.</p>
