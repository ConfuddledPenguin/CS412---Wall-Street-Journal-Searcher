	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Forbes magazine ended its association with a
free-lance reporter whose activities regarding a recent
article about Merv Griffin were questioned by a federal
judge.
   A spokesman for Forbes said that John Connolly was "a
free-lancer who is no longer with Forbes." He declined to
comment further. Mr. Connolly, who Forbes said is a former
policeman and stockbroker, shared credit for an article about
Mr. Griffin's purchase of Resorts International, the hotel
and casino concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Griffin article, in the June 11 issue, said that
Michael Nigris Jr., the former president of Mr. Griffin's
Griffin Co., had ties to organized crime. Mr. Nigris sued Mr.
Griffin last November for breach of contract after he was
fired.</p>
<p>Federal Judge Dickinson Debevoise in Newark, N.J., asked
the U.S. attorney last month to investigate whether Mr.
Connolly had misrepresented himself as a police officer to
obtain sealed affidavits in Mr. Nigris's lawsuit. The judge,
in letters to parties in the suit, said he had granted Mr.
Connolly's request for access to the affidavits but
subsequently learned Mr. Connolly's police identification was
outdated.</p>
<p>Mr. Connolly, who said he was a New York City policeman
from 1965 to 1976, last month denied he showed a police badge
in getting the affidavits. He said he never spoke to the
judge and that he had access to the documents before they
were sealed March 9.</p>
