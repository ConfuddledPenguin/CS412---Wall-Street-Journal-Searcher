	<p class="article-leader">When it came to winning investment strategies in the
1980s, buying the stocks that make up Standard & Poor's
500-stock index was at the top of the charts.
   Investors whose portfolios matched the index not only beat
the vast majority of professional stock-pickers, but they
also outperformed all other broad market indexes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By the end of the decade, many investment managers were
dancing to the S&P tune -- chasing its performance as "closet
indexers" by weighting their portfolios toward these stocks.
Now individual investors, eager to join the party, are
snapping up S&P-index mutual funds.</p>
<p>But what worked best in the '80s, may not be the smartest
move in the '90s. Says Charles Clough, chief investment
strategist at Merrill Lynch & Co.: "I think investors can
make two mistakes today -- staying in cash and buying
S&P-index funds -- and right now they're making both."</p>
<p>No one disputes the convenience, low costs and other
advantages of index-fund investing in general. And no one
expects to see a mass exodus of money from S&P funds. But
some money managers and market analysts do expect the S&P
index to lose at least some of its magic in the years ahead.</p>
<p>"I can confidently say that the broader indexes like the
Wilshire 5000 or the Frank Russell 3000 will sharply
outperform the S&P 500 this decade -- though I'm not at all
confident of saying that's going to happen this year or
next," says Robert Arnott, president of First Quadrant Corp.,
a Pasadena, Calif., money manager.</p>
<p>Institutional investors are already starting to hedge
their bets. "The new cash flow (from index customers) is
going elsewhere than the S&P," says Patricia Dunn, president
of Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors, a large index-fund
manager for institutional clients.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, S&P stocks clearly had an edge. Of
course, there were some good reasons: This elite stock group,
dominated by big blue-chip companies, had some of the
strongest earnings and other fundamentals in the market. But
even after allowing for size, growth, yields, value, foreign
income, liquidity and other factors, the S&P stocks still
produced a bonus return just for belonging to the index.</p>
<p>Martingale Asset Management, a Boston-based investment
firm, and Barra, a Berkeley, Calif., consulting firm,
calculate this "membership effect" to have added an average
of 3.4 percentage points a year to investors' returns in the
1980s. Over the decade, that meant a cumulative gain of about
40 percentage points that could be explained only by the
importance of being the S&P.</p>
<p>"There's no market share, monopoly or macro argument that
justifies (the bonus return) -- which means it probably can't
be sustained over the long term," says John Freeman, Barra's
manager of consulting services.</p>
<p>Instead, many analysts concluded that the S&P stocks
benefited from their popularity with index-fund investors,
program traders, closet indexers, corporate restructurers, as
well as foreign buyers of U.S. stocks, who used the index as
a shopping list.</p>
<p>Now, there are signs that fashions may be changing. So far
this year, the membership effect doesn't seem to be working.
"There's no trend one way or the other," says William
Jacques, Martingale partner and chief investment officer. "We
may have seen the bulk of the growth in this already."</p>
<p>That possibility appears to be supported by changing
attitudes among some of the S&P's biggest fans. For instance,
some big institutional investors in index funds are shifting
their emphasis.</p>
<p>Ms. Dunn of Wells Fargo Nikko says customers who in the
past relied solely on S&P funds aren't adding new money there
now and are instead dipping into indexes comprising smaller
stocks. Meanwhile, customers who already have a diversified
index-fund portfolio, and who find themselves too heavily
weighted in stocks after the market's strong run-up of the
past year, are rebalancing their portfolios by "selling the
S&P and holding steady in the smaller stock indexes," she
says.</p>
<p>Other big sources of demand that helped drive the S&P's
outperformance in the 1980s -- corporate restructurers and
foreign investors -- are also likely to be less important
factors in the market in the years ahead, many analysts say.</p>
<p>"And unless these incremental buyers continue buying at
the same levels they did in the past, then the S&P pricing
bubble will tend to deflate," says Martingale's Mr. Jacques.
He figures the S&P stocks as a group "could give up about 20
percentage points of relative performance if this pricing
bubble reverses itself."</p>
<p>All this is music to the ears of active managers, the
professional stock-pickers who have had to struggle mightily
to match the S&P-performance benchmark in the last several
years. "The S&P has dominated the performance of active
managers for 10 years -- that's probably unrepeatable," says
Ms. Dunn.</p>
<p>As less money flows to the S&P compared with the rest of
the market, "there will be a period when all the active
managers will look smart again," says Laurence Siegel,
managing director at Ibbotson Associates Inc.</p>
<p>The shift is probably good news for the brokerage firms,
too, as "good old-fashioned stock-picking and securities
analysis will become a more important factor in portfolio
performance" in the years ahead, says Steven Einhorn,
co-chairman of the investment policy committee at Goldman,
Sachs & Co.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean investors should banish the S&P 500 from
their portfolios. "Particularly, given the importance of the
global economic arena, the larger companies that make up the
S&P may have a bigger opportunity" for growth than their
non-S&P rivals that have less international exposure, says
Stephen Nesbitt, senior vice president at pension consultants
Wilshire Associates.</p>
<p>`Maybe the S&P is a fad, maybe it's seen its best years,
but it's not a stupid investment; it's still a fine
portfolio," says Ibbotson's Mr. Siegel. "Long term, if (S&P
index funds) get people out of cash and GICs (guaranteed
investment contracts), that's fine -- however, if people are
focusing on the S&P as some kind of panacea, that's not
fine."</p>
