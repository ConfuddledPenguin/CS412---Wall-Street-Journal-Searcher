	<p class="article-leader">BETHPAGE, N.Y. -- Grumman Corp. and Boeing Co. said they
settled their dispute over costs for the U.S. defense program
called Joint Stars.
   "The settlement eliminates substantial claims by both
parties concerning responsibility for the costs of completion
of the first two Joint Stars aircraft," the companies said. A
Grumman spokesman said no details of the settlement would be
released.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a joint statement, Grumman Chairman John O'Brien and
Boeing Vice Chairman Malcolm Stamper said, "This settlement
will improve our mutual concentration on other important
assignments on which we are working together."</p>
<p>In 1985, Grumman won a $657 million contract for a
five-year development program for the Joint Surveillance
Target Attack Radar System, which will identify ground
targets and guide aircraft and missiles. The value of the
contract has since been increased to $850 million, Grumman
said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boeing won an $80.2 million subcontract to
modify two aircraft for the radar system's "aerial platform,"
but late in 1987 Boeing requested a $122.5 million price
increase. Boeing alleged that Grumman's demands on the
subcontractor had departed from the contract and driven up
costs.</p>
<p>For its part, Grumman then sought an undisclosed sum from
Boeing "for damages caused by deficiencies in performance of
the subcontract."</p>
<p>Grumman said Joint Stars is "in the final phases" of
flight testing by Grumman, with a U.S. Air Force evaluation
planned for this year.</p>
