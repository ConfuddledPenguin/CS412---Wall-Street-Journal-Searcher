	<p class="article-leader">Julie Salamon, in her June 14 review of the movie "Dick
Tracy," makes a casual reference to "comic-free papers like
this one or the New York Times."
   Well, what am I . . . chopped liver? I've been
contributing to the Journal's "Pepper . . . and Salt" cartoon
panel for more than 30 years, along with a multitude of other
free-lance gag cartoonists. I understand it's one of the most
popular features in the paper. Ms. Salamon can find it a
couple of pages beyond the Leisure & Arts section where her
reviews are printed, just below the "Letters to the Editor."</p>
