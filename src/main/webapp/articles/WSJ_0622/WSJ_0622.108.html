	<p class="article-leader">RENO, Nev. -- Syntech International Inc. said it will miss
a sixth consecutive dividend payment on its preferred stock,
and may have to seek bankruptcy-court protection if it fails
to win restructuring of two existing lottery contracts.
   Loss-plagued Syntech is one of a handful of makers of
transaction-processing equipment used in state-supported
lotteries. The company said omitting of the preferred
dividend triggers provisions in its certificate of
incorporation that allows preferred holders as a class to
select two members on the company's four-member board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Syntech couldn't be reached for comment on whether those
holders had yet demanded those seats.</p>
<p>Syntech said it omitted the latest payout, due in
September, because of its deteriorating financial condition.
The company said its "ability to continue as a going concern
and remain in existence" hinges upon restructuring of the two
lottery contracts. It provided no details about the
contracts.</p>
<p>"If such new arrangements cannot be worked out promptly
the company will have no alternative but to consider seeking
relief" under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code,
Thomas A. McChristy, Syntech's chief executive, said in a
news release. Under Chapter 11, a company seeks protection
from its creditors while working out a plan to pay its debt.</p>
<p>Syntech posted a loss in fiscal 1989 ended Sept. 30 of
$15.1 million, or $2.78 a share, on revenue of $11.3 million.
In the first quarter ended Dec. 31, the company had a loss of
$2.1 million, or 40 cents a share, on revenue of $6.6
million.</p>
