	<p class="article-leader">ROME -- When French President Francois Mitterrand launched
the Eureka project in 1985, skeptics dismissed it as more of
a public-relations exercise than a serious scientific
initiative.
   Five years later it appears to have confounded the
critics, establishing itself as a multibillion-dollar
research program bringing together industrial companies and
universities from 19 European countries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cross-border high-technology research projects
proliferating under the Eureka banner are designed for
commercial application. They include the hugely expensive
European bid to develop high-definition television as well as
work on the mass propagation of virus-free artichokes or the
design of an automatic platform for deep-sea oil drilling.</p>
<p>Eureka was conceived as a European response to the
research drive generated in the U.S. by the Strategic Defense
Initiative, or Star Wars, but was aimed at the civilian
rather than military sector. European governments have
repeatedly argued that U.S. military research spending has
had direct commercial benefits for U.S. companies -- whether
in aeronautics, computer technology or microelectronics --
and contend that state support for European civilian research
has to be seen in this context.</p>
<p>In contrast to publicly funded commercial research in the
U.S., which has become the object of a fierce political
struggle, Eureka is one of the few pan-European projects that
enjoys support across the political spectrum. Both right- and
left-wing governments, interventionists and free marketeers
see it as one of Europe's best arms in the struggle against
Japanese and American high-tech supremacy.</p>
<p>Over the past year, 91 research projects have been added
to the existing Eureka list, bringing projects approved under
the scheme to 385 over the past five years at a value of 7.8
billion European currency units ($9.5 billion).</p>
<p>"What we're trying to encourage is collaborative research,
not single-company product development," said British
Industry Minister Douglas Hogg during a break at a
ministerial meeting on Eureka here earlier this month.</p>
<p>When Eureka was launched, there was some concern within
the European Community Commission over whether it might
compete with the EC's own science-funding program. But
officials involved with Eureka say it has firmly established
its role as financing projects designed to produce
commercially viable results, while EC programs are designed
for more fundamental research.</p>
<p>"There is a general philosophy of complementarity between
the EC framework program and Eureka," Italian Scientific and
Technological Research Minister Antonio Ruberti told
journalists here. The 19 Eureka members include the 12 member
EC states, Scandinavia, Switzerland, Austria and Turkey.
Senior EC Commission representatives also take part in Eureka
discussions.</p>
<p>Eureka projects are proposed by industry and largely
financed by it, with no central source of financing available
for the program. Instead, companies seeking support approach
their national governments with proposals. The governments
decide whether the proposal qualifies as a Eureka project and
then decide about financing on a project-by-project basis.
Typically, governments pay about one-third of the cost,
sometimes providing additional loans, with industry financing
the rest.</p>
<p>Eureka projects approved over the past five years have
fallen into nine main categories: medicine and biotechnology,
communications, energy technology, the environment,
information technology, lasers, new materials, robotics and
transportation.</p>
<p>One of the highest-profile projects has been aimed at
setting a European standard for high-definition television,
the new technology that will radically enhance picture and
sound quality in the next decade.</p>
<p>"HDTV is a complete revolution -- it's an even larger step
than that from black-and-white to color television," said
Koos Andriessen, the Dutch economics affairs minister. Mr.
Andriessen will play a pivotal role in Eureka over the next
year; the Netherlands has recently taken over the rotating
one-year presidency and he has made it clear that HDTV will
be given top priority.</p>
<p>"HDTV is reaching a critical stage" he said. "Japan has
done work on HDTV and we think it's important that Europe
should be there."</p>
<p>The Dutch electronics company N.V. Philips is leading the
research, in conjunction with other major European
electronics concerns including Bosch G.m.b.H., Thomson S.A.
and Oy Nokia. The group already has managed to stop the
Japanese from achieving a monopoly position for their MUSE
high-definition standard. Last month, the International Radio
Consultative Committee placed the European standard MAC on an
equal basis with MUSE.</p>
<p>Eureka ministers responded June 1 by approving the second
phase of HDTV development. It calls for spending almost $600
million over the next five years, of which a third to half
will be public funds. During the second phase, experimental
HDTV sets will be produced to demonstrate their reception of
major public events, including the 1992 Olympic Games in
France and Spain. By 1995, the Europeans hope to be marketing
HDTV sets, along with such other HDTV products as receivers,
laser disk players and videocassette recorders.</p>
<p>"For Eureka, HDTV is definitely the high-visibility
project," said Thomson's Patrick Sandoly. It pits the group
"directly against the Japanese."</p>
<p>Another high-profile project is Jessi, the Joint European
Submicron Silicon Initiative, an eight-year program relating
to silicon-based microelectronics and its industrial
application.</p>
