	<p class="article-leader">NASHUA, N.H. -- Ferrofluidics Corp., a maker of seals and
dampers for computers, said its expects to take a charge of
as much as $15 million in its fourth quarter and year ending
June 30, related to writeoffs and a corporate restructuring.
   In fiscal 1989, the company earned $52,000, negligible in
per-share terms, on sales of $20.2 million. Fiscal 1989
fourth-quarter results weren't broken out separately. In the
fiscal 1990 first nine months, Ferrofluidics had a net loss
of $561,000, or 19 cents a share, on sales of $21.6 million.
The company declined to forecast results for the current
fiscal year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ferrofluidics said the planned charge will result partly
from a loss from the sale of its AF Technologies Ltd. unit in
Britain, and write-downs of other assets, inventories and
patents, including some related to its ferrofluid film
bearing program. The company also said it will eliminate a
deferred-tax asset on its books, because of adoption of new
Financial Accounting Standards Board standard.</p>
<p>Ronald Moskowitz, chief executive officer, said the
restructuring "is in the long-term best interests of the
company and its shareholders, and will result in a more
profitable company."</p>
