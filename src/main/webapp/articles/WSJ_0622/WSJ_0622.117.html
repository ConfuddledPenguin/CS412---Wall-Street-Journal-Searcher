	<p class="article-leader">GORBACHEV'S WOES threaten hopes for fast accords on
Germany and arms.
   Political infighting in Moscow puts pressure on Bush and
Kohl to snare Soviet signatures on historic East-West
treaties soon. Pacts uniting Germany on Western terms and
rolling back the 40-year Soviet edge in conventional forces
are slated for signing by December at a 35-nation summit. But
the Soviet hardliners' attacks on Gorbachev send chills
through the White House.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A fear of losing the treaties is behind Bush's new
willingness to consider a Western economic-aid package for
the Soviets. It is also leading to other concessions,
including a likely radical softening of NATO's military
doctrines at next month's Western summit. Bonn may want to
move up the treaty signing to November.</p>
<p>But Kremlin confusion slows talks; Soviet arms bargainers
complain privately that they lack clear post-summit
instructions.</p>
<p>DEMOCRATS SEEK to make political hay from a Bush veto of
family leave.</p>
<p>The promised veto of the leave bill gives Democrats a
potent issue. Bush made a campaign promise to protect women's
jobs, and his wife championed the idea in her Wellesley
speech. But it would be a mistake to try to argue that Bush
"hates children," advises Democratic pollster Celinda Lake,
and better to say he's "too tied to big business" to help
working families.</p>
<p>The White House stresses Bush's support of voluntary
leave. But critics note federal mandates already exist for
military-reserve and jury duty. Some GOP lawmakers fear a
veto will hurt the party's pro-family image. Democrats are
"going to use it against Republicans and probably very
successfully," frets Pennsylvania Rep. Weldon.</p>
<p>BOTH PARTIES SCRAMBLE to deflect political blame for the
S&L debacle.</p>
<p>Fearing voter outrage this fall, lawmakers propose more
than a dozen bills to crack down on thrift fraud. North
Carolina Rep. Neal, under fire from his GOP opponent for
opposing a 1987 S&L cleanup measure, is the prime sponsor of
two bills; one with 90 sponsors would require the Justice
Department to investigate at least half its pending 21,000
S&L cases by year end.</p>
<p>Democratic Rep. Annunzio of Illinois, a longtime friend of
the S&L industry, proposes a commission to probe financial
crime. More than 130 House members co-sponsor a similar bill
by GOP Rep. Smith of Vermont. "Everyone would love to take
{an S&L bill} home to their district and say it will never
happen again," says David Danovitch, a thrift lobbyist.</p>
<p>Fifteen House Democrats write thrift regulators demanding
that all charges against Bush's son, Neil, regarding a Denver
thrift's failure be made public.</p>
<p>MANDELA'S VISIT with Bush on Monday will lead to financial
aid, the South African's backers hope. Randall Robinson, the
TransAfrica organizer of Mandela's U.S. tour, has urged that
the U.S. grant $30 million to $50 million to groups pushing
South African democracy. The extraordinary welcome for
Mandela raises hopes for aid.</p>
<p>OREGON SURPRISE? Democrats start thinking that challenger
Harry Lonsdale has a chance to pull off a big upset against
GOP Sen. Mark Hatfield. Among reasons for their growing
optimism: Hatfield is on the defensive on three big issues:
abortion, log exports and PAC money.</p>
<p>NUKES SALE: The Soviets seek to sell space nuclear
reactors for up to $10 million each. Possible uses include
nuclear-powered communications satellites, says Space Power
Inc., a California company. "There's a fire-sale sense" to
the Soviet offer, says Steven Aftergood of the Federation of
American Scientists.</p>
<p>SUMMIT PLEA: World Bank President Conable writes Bush and
other leaders urging him "to remember the state of the
developing countries" at next month's Houston summit of the
seven industrialized nations. Conable warned that the world's
poor stand to lose the most if the talks to greatly expand
the world's trade treaty should fail.</p>
<p>ABORTION RULINGS by the Supreme Court will deepen splits
over the issue.</p>
<p>Anti-abortion forces anticipate that the court, in rulings
expected next week, will uphold state laws requiring minors
to tell their parents before getting abortions. They will try
to use the decisions to regain strength going into the fall
elections. But pollsters say a ruling for parental
notification probably wouldn't reverse the political momentum
of abortion-rights activists.</p>
<p>The abortion strife spills over into other arenas. The
American Bar Association prepares for a divisive push at its
August convention in Chicago to repeal a pro-abortion-rights
stance adopted in February. More than 1,000 lawyers already
have resigned from the 360,000-member group. Similar discord
faces the AFL-CIO as its directors grapple with the issue.</p>
<p>New legal battles loom as courts in Pennsylvania and Guam
get set to review their strict anti-abortion laws.</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: Patriotism meets protectionism: Reps. Bryant
and Staggers seek to ban imports of foreign-made American
flags, which account for up to 17% of the U.S. market and
exceeded 300,000 in this year's first four months. . . . A
Concord (N.H.) Monitor cartoon shows White House Chief of
Staff Sununu giving management advice to Gorbachev: "I keep
my bullwhip in this drawer. . . . brass knuckles are up by
the Rolodex." . . . Jay Leno says one new Crayola crayon
color is "S&L Red."</p>
