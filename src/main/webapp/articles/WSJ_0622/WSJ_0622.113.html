	<p class="article-leader">NORTHBROOK, Ill. -- General Binding Corp., hurt by "soft"
markets and higher expenses, said it expects second quarter
earnings to fall short of analysts' expectations.
   Rudolph Grua, president and chief executive officer, said
the office products company expects to report profit fell to
30 cents or 31 cents a share from 35 cents a year earlier. He
said that would put net income at $4.8 million to $5 million,
down from $5.6 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Grua said analysts and the company had projected
earnings around 38 cents a share. He said higher expenses,
along with slower sales growth in May and June, forced the
lowering.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Grua said soft markets mean flat gross
margins in its basic business of making machines and supplies
to laminate and bind paper. And he said margins are down in
the company's three-ring metal binder business.</p>
<p>The news sent General Binding shares down $2.50 to close
at $18.50 in over-the-counter trading yesterday.</p>
<p>The expected earnings would mark the second consecutive
quarterly shortfall for General Binding after a 16-quarter
string of higher earnings.</p>
<p>But Mr. Grua said he expects that modestly higher earnings
in this year's final two quarters should help the company
meet or slightly exceed $18.8 million, or $1.18 a share,
which the company reported last year before an income tax
refund made net $20.1 million, or $1.26 a share.</p>
<p>General Binding expects second quarter sales to increase
about 11% to $80 million from $71.9 million a year earlier.
But excluding the Loose Leaf Metals unit acquired last
August, comparable sales are expected to rise about 9% --
below the company's earlier expectation of double-digit
growth.</p>
<p>Mr. Grua attributed the lower-than-expected sales to
softer international markets for office products. The sales
shortfall is mainly on the machine side, Mr. Grua said. He
said the company's sales of supplies for those machines
remain healthy.</p>
<p>Despite the earnings setback, Mr. Grua said he doesn't
plan to stop looking for acquisitions or interrupt the
company's annual dividend increases.</p>
