	<p class="article-leader">LONG BEACH, Calif. -- Earth Technology Corp. reported
sharply higher results for the fiscal third quarter and nine
months, but cautioned that a slowdown in part of its business
may "slightly" affect fourth-quarter results.
   Jack J. Schoustra, chairman and chief executive, said he
is "comfortable" with earnings projections of about 50 cents
a share for the current fiscal year, which ends Aug. 25.
Earth Technologies is involved in waste management consulting
and specialized analysis of potential industrial sites.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the third quarter ended May 25, net income totaled
$190,000, or six cents a share, more than five times the
$33,000, or one cent a share, posted in the year-earlier
quarter. Revenue jumped 62% to $14.5 million from $9 million
on the strength of both acquisitions and growth of existing
business.</p>
<p>Mr. Schoustra said the sharp earnings increase was due
mainly to depressed results in the year-earlier quarter,
stemming from an office closure and relocation. Moreover, he
said the latest period included "well in excess of $100,000"
of preparation and proposal costs for two, multiyear Air
Force contracts awarded during the period totaling $97
million.</p>
<p>The executive said recent softening in backlog for
asbestos consulting and laboratory services might lower
fourth-quarter profit by "a cent or two." He said the problem
was a "hole" in an otherwise busy asbestos-removal work
schedule.</p>
<p>For the fiscal nine months, Earth Technology had net
income of $1 million, or 32 cents a share, more than double
the $456,000, or 16 cents a share, in the year-earlier period
on fewer shares. Revenue rose 49% to $40.3 million from $26.9
million. Included in the latest period was about $100,000 of
"non-operating" costs related to a restated loss by a
subsidiary and a valuation change in deferred compensation
related to an acquisition.</p>
<p>Mr. Schoustra said the company "never said it was
comfortable with one analyst's forecast that net income will
total about 55 cents a share this fiscal year" and that it
was "more comfortable" with an estimate of about 50 cents.
The executive said possible softening in the fourth quarter
might mean a drop of one or two cents from that 50-cent
figure.</p>
<p>In the fiscal year ended Aug. 25, 1989, Earth Technology
had net income of $518,000, or 18 cents a share, on revenue
of $37.8 million.</p>
