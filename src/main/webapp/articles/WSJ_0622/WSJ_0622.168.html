	<p class="article-leader">Canada's constitutional wrangle is coming down to the
wire.
   Whether or not Quebec gets the recognition it seeks as a
"distinct society," the fight probably will launch a bitter
debate about Canada's Constitution and the structure of the
nation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the Meech Lake constitutional accord is ratified, a
round of constitutional negotiations will begin July 15. The
issues will be as controversial as the "distinct society"
debate that has preoccupied Canadians and Canada's financial
markets for several months.</p>
<p>If the accord isn't ratified, nothing will change
overnight. But Canadian politics will turn surly as the hunt
begins for somebody to blame for the failure. And talk of at
least partial independence in French-speaking Quebec will
quickly hit a higher pitch.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said yesterday that
failure to adopt the Meech Lake accord will result in
"constitutional paralysis, sadness and dismay across the
country (and) negative signals to international markets." Mr.
Mulroney also said there is a "growing probability" that
failure to adopt the accord will result in a "rising sense of
rejection in Quebec and growing support of
sovereignty-association," or political independence. A poll
conducted last week found that 57% of Quebecers support
sovereignty for their province.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulroney was making a last-minute pitch to the 52
members of the Newfoundland House of Assembly yesterday. This
morning, the Newfoundland Legislature is expected to vote on
the Meech Lake accord.</p>
<p>The final tally is uncertain, but rejection appears
likely. Even if Newfoundland ratifies the accord, it may die
in Manitoba. Procedural obstacles in the Manitoba Legislature
delayed debate on the accord, and Manitoba politicians say
there isn't enough time left to vote before tomorrow's
deadline for ratification. Eight provinces have ratified the
accord, which must be passed by all 10 provinces to take
effect.</p>
<p>There's only a "slim chance" the accord will go through,
Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa said for the first time
Wednesday. Relentlessly optimistic until now, Mr. Bourassa is
expected to make a statement to Quebecers this weekend if
Meech Lake collapses, an aide said.</p>
<p>The Meech Lake accord was negotiated at Meech Lake,
Quebec, three years ago. It recognizes Quebec as a "distinct
society" within Canada and grants certain powers to all
provinces. The accord satisfies Quebec's minimum conditions
for signing the 1982 Constitution.</p>
<p>Equities analysts see little movement in the Canadian
stock markets if the accord doesn't pass. "The market's
already reacted to the uncertainty," said John Ing, president
and chief executive of Maison Placements Canada Inc. "If it
doesn't pass, we'll just see more of what we've been seeing."</p>
<p>If the accord is ratified, analysts expect a rise in the
Canadian dollar, which has been under severe downward
pressure, along with a rally in the bond market and a
subsequent rally in the stock market, although the latter
will be "more of an emotional reaction than it will be based
on fundamentals," Mr. Ing said.</p>
<p>Michael Boulter, a portfolio strategist with Research
Capital Corp., said he sees the Toronto stock market rallying
by about 100 points from its current level of about 3520 if
the accord passes. He said interestrate sensitive stocks,
such as banks and utilities, will see the most benefit.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Canadian dollar closed in Toronto at 85.01
U.S. cents, down 0.29 cents. Canadian government bonds closed
down about 1/8 of a point, or C$12.50 for each C$1,000 face
amount. The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 index finished at
3526.24, down 4.24.</p>
