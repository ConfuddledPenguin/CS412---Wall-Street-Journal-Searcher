	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The federal government's budget deficit
widened to $42.55 billion in May from $25.43 billion a year
earlier, the Treasury said, reflecting sizable spending on
the thrift-industry bailout and declining tax revenue.
   Last month's budget gap compared with a revised surplus of
$41.76 billion in April. The Treasury previously reported the
April surplus as $42.52 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its monthly statement, the Treasury said receipts
totaled $69.21 billion last month, compared with $71.03
billion a year earlier and $139.62 billion in April.</p>
<p>April usually shows a surplus because the filing deadline
for individual tax returns occurs at midmonth, and receipts
from personal income taxes set a record this past April.
However, both the White House and congressional budget
offices say that they've been forced to widen their deficit
forecasts for this year and next because federal tax receipts
are falling short of their forecasts.</p>
<p>Although the reasons aren't yet clear, one factor appears
to be that total wages and salaries -- on which payroll and
personal income taxes are paid -- are falling short of
expectations and may have been lower in the recent past than
Commerce Department reports suggest.</p>
<p>Outlays in May totaled $111.76 billion, up 16% from $96.46
billion a year earlier and 14% from $97.87 billion the month
before.</p>
<p>Outlays this past May included $7.27 billion spent by the
Resolution Trust Corp. to clean up the S&L industry. The rest
of the increase reflected such items as interest on the
national debt and spending on such programs such as Social
Security and Medicaid.</p>
<p>For the first eight months of fiscal 1990, which began
Oct. 1, receipts totaled $667.13 billion, up 4.1% from
$640.89 billion the year before. Outlays through May totaled
$818.81 billion, an 8.6% rise from $754.1 billion a year
earlier.</p>
<p>That produced a total deficit of $151.68 billion for the
first eight months of fiscal 1990, compared with $113.21
billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>The deficit for all of fiscal 1989 was $152 billion. White
House Budget Director Richard Darman told congressional
budget negotiators this week that he expects the deficit for
all of fiscal 1990 to be between $184 billion and $206
billion, including spending on the S&L cleanup. Excluding
thrift spending, the White House projects the deficit at $158
billion. The deficit target in the Gramm-Rudman law for
fiscal 1990 is $100 billion, but there is no legal penalty
for missing it.</p>
<p>The government paid $21.65 billion in interest last month
on the federal debt.</p>
