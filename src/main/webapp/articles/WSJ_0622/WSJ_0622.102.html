	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Short interest reached record levels for the
month ended June 15, rising 2.6% on the New York Stock
Exchange and inching up 0.3% on the American Stock Exchange.
   For the first time in 15 months, Texas Air Corp. was
supplanted as the leading short-interest issue on the Amex,
as short volume in the Houston airline holding company
plunged.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Energy Service Co., a Houston energy services concern, led
the Amex; the company is facing delays in completing a $50
million hazardous-waste incinerator complex near Mobile,
Ariz. Varity Corp., a Toronto manufacturer of farm equipment
and auto parts, led the Big Board. Short selling of Varity
shares has been linked to a type of arbitrage involving the
company's preferred stock.</p>
<p>Additionally, a closely watched indicator of negative
sentiment, the short interest ratio measured on the Big
Board, plunged at mid-June.</p>
<p>New York exchange short interest climbed to 661,212,877
shares at June 15 from 644,549,698 shares at mid-May. On the
Amex, short interest edged up to 72,277,893 shares from an
adjusted 72,033,106.</p>
<p>At mid-June 1989, short volume was 528,985,908 shares on
the Big Board, indicating a 25% increase, and 49,054,037
shares on the American exchange, indicating a 47% advance.</p>
<p>Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.</p>
<p>Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.</p>
<p>Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may
be caused partly by arbitraging. The figures occasionally
include incomplete transactions in restricted stock.</p>
<p>The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board
short interest ratio sank to 3.86 from last month's 4.61. The
ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange's average
daily trading volume that would be required to convert the
total short interest position. Some analysts suggest,
however, that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator
because options and other products can be used to hedge short
positions.</p>
<p>Many investors in Varity have chosen to hold the company's
convertible preferred shares while shorting the common stock
to hedge their investment.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Varity said it will seek shareholder
approval for a plan to allow it to "pay inducements" in cash
or common shares to holders of preferred shares. The move,
aimed at reducing Varity's hefty preferred-share dividend
payments, ultimately could substantially pare the number of
preferred shares outstanding and reduce the short position in
the common.</p>
<p>The American depositary receipts of Empresa Nacional De
Electricidad S.A. showed the largest short-volume increase on
the Big Board, climbing to 4,372,850 shares from 190,022.
Late last month, the Madrid utility said Spain's Ministry of
Industry and Energy wouldn't permit it to include $317
million of expenses relating to necessary repairs and
required modernization of the Vandellos I Nuclear Power Plant
in the base rate for electricity.</p>
<p>Panhandle Eastern Corp., a Houston natural gas-pipeline
concern, saw short volume drop to 504,548 shares from
5,832,010, leading the Big Board decliners.</p>
<p>Texas Air was the biggest volume decliner on the Amex,
with 4,570,106 shares compared with 8,547,761 a month
earlier.</p>
<p>Fruit of the Loom Inc., a Chicago apparel concern, led the
Amex volume increases, rising to 4,357,279 shares from
2,896,033.</p>
<p>The bellwether issue International Business Machines
Corp., the Armonk, N.Y., computer company, saw short interest
rise 22% to 4,908,645 shares, while closely watched New York
oil major Exxon Corp.'s volume eased 0.9% to 5,471,865 shares
from 5,519,394.</p>
<p>The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in
which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares
existed at mid-June or in which the short position had
changed by at least 50,000 shares since mid-May (see
accompanying tables -- WSJ June 22, 1990).</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>CONTINENTAL AIRLINES HOLDINGS Inc. short interest volume
was 7,532,266 shares for the month ended June 15, making it
the largest-volume issue and bringing total American Stock
Exchange short volume to 75,240,053 shares. Because
Continental recently changed its name from Texas Air Corp.,
some brokerage firms neglected to report some of the
company's short positions, the Amex said.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>ENERGY SERVICE Co., a Houston energy services concern,
said the short interest in its shares for the month ended
June 15 rose because investors appear to be arbitraging its
common and preferred stock. The company was incorrectly
described in Friday's short interest article as being
involved in a hazardous-waste facility.</p>
