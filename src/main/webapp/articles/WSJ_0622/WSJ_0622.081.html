	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- West Germany's pledge to give Moscow a five
billion-mark credit and Bonn's pursuit of Soviet political
concessions highlight the link between German dreams of
reunification and the Soviet Union's desperate need for
Western economic help.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher will
be seeking historic political concessions from the Soviets
today in Berlin, in negotiations involving the two Germanys
and the four victorious World War II powers. At the same
time, his government will be approving the five billion-mark
($2.98 billion) bank credit to Moscow.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It will be the largest single credit ever granted the
Soviets, and the conditions are far better than commercial
banks are willing to give a nation grappling with serious
repayment difficulties. The credit, managed by Deutsche Bank
AG, will be government-guaranteed and offered at market
interest rates. The Soviets will have 15 years to repay after
a grace period that is still being negotiated.</p>
<p>Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann, who recently returned
from negotiations in the Soviet Union, believes the generous
credit terms will ease Soviet nervousness about the
accelerating pace of German unification. He also thinks they
help avoid a potentially dangerous isolation of Moscow from
the Western world. His government views the credit as an
emergency bridging loan until Chancellor Helmut Kohl can
convince his allies to join a more comprehensive program.</p>
<p>The Bush administration has been deeply skeptical about
plans for direct Western aid to Moscow, although it
reluctantly has begun to consider such proposals.</p>
<p>In a meeting with a small group of reporters in Washington
yesterday, President Bush reiterated that he isn't likely to
endorse any direct U.S. aid "at this time." But, he also said
he wouldn't discourage the allies from going forward with
their own plans to prop up the Soviet economy. "If some of
the neighbors want to go forward, fine. I think that that
comes under the heading of their business," the president
said.</p>
<p>"I noticed on my trip that the Soviets are adjusting to
the prospect of our monetary union on July 1," said Mr.
Haussmann in an interview yesterday. "The combined economies
of the Germanys will make us, by far, the most important
economic trading partner for the Soviet Union." With the
Soviets determined to make the transition to a convertible
currency, he said, "We must and we will put the Soviets in
the position to modernize their industry with German
machinery and capital goods."</p>
<p>The five billion-mark credit is part of a far broader and
more costly West German effort to reasssure Moscow that it
can count on a unified Germany to be its most important
trading partner far into the future.</p>
<p>The steps already agreed to include assuring Moscow that
East German companies will continue to deliver militarily
important goods, that Bonn will subsidize East German
companies to ensure they don't fail to fulfull obligations to
the Soviets, and that the West Germans will assume most of
the payments East Germany has been making for the stationing
of 380,000 Soviet troops and more than 100,000 dependents on
East German territory.</p>
<p>American officials say that the two-plus-four talks
between the two Germanys and the four powers -- the U.S., the
Soviets, the French and the British -- are slowly focusing on
more private negotiations between Moscow and Bonn.
"Two-plus-four is really becoming one-on-one," said one
Western diplomat here. "The game is really now between the
Germans and the Soviets."</p>
<p>Yet West German officials insist that their economic
assistance isn't an effort to buy unification, but rather a
means to find common ground with the Soviets, who still won't
abandon objections to a reunified Germany in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization unless they are satisfied with a
new European security structure.</p>
<p>"The issue isn't to throw money at them in an Ethiopian
relief program," says one foreign-ministry official here.
"The idea is to integrate them into the world economy and
make sure they do not feel isolated."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the new credit raises concerns among some
Western officials that Bonn has been too ready to meet Soviet
economic and political demands. They charge that Chancellor
Kohl is particulary anxious to get a deal, hoping to show
voters that he is the man who achieved reunification and
arranged Soviet troop withdrawal. Mr. Kohl is preparing for
the first all-German elections at the end of this year.</p>
<p>Bankers in Western Europe complain that Bonn is pressuring
European commercial bankers to extend credits despite jitters
about the Soviet economy. "It's a nice political gesture,"
said one British banker. "But there are still gigantic
ongoing problems that are bound to increase uncertainty and
short-term disorder."</p>
<p>Senior West German officials have been engaged in the most
numerous and intensive meetings with Soviet counterparts they
can remember. Since the beginning of the year, Foreign
Minister Genscher has met Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze for nearly 40 hours of talks in eight cities,
including more than seven hours of talks this week.</p>
<p>Economics Minister Haussmann's schedule has also been
filled with Soviets. His staff was shocked when, during one
session, Soviet officials Nicolay Ryzhkov and Minister
President Ivan Selayev focused almost entirely on Moscow's
fears that monetary union would cause disruptions or higher
prices for already-contracted East German deliveries.</p>
<p>Senior Soviet economic officials in Bonn this week had a
laundry list of projects they wanted protected. Atop the list
was the production of satellite optics and guidance systems
provided by the East German company Carl Zeiss Jena. These
are thought to be used in the Soviet Union's nuclear defense
program.</p>
<p>The West Germans consented to fulfill all standing
contracts. "The status quo will be protected," said Mr.
Haussmann. "East Germany can't immediately end its military
cooperation with the Soviet Union. . . . If the East Germans
have to deliver spare parts, they will."</p>
<p>Mr. Haussmann stresses, however, that West Germany has
promised its allies to expand its export controls to East
German territory. He says this poses less of a difficulty,
now that the West is loosening export controls. He insists,
however, that West Germany won't allow East German companies
who are supplying the Soviets to modernize their systems
using Western technology to further upgrade these military
products.</p>
<p>Mr. Genscher has already promised that a unified Germany
will pay -- in hard currency -- East German subsidies for the
Soviet soldiers and dependents still on East German soil.
Although estimates vary, two Bundestag members estimate the
cost to the West German government for the second half of
this year will exceed 1.3 billion marks.</p>
<p>These Bundestag members say another two billion marks are
being set aside in a fund to help keep afloat even
unprofitable companies that have contractual obligations with
the Soviets through 1990 and perhaps 1991. Government
officials have assured parliamentarians that these subsidies
will disappear after three years.</p>
<p>"I think that's wishful thinking," says Wolfgang Roth, the
economic spokesman for the Social Democratic Party in the
Bundestag. "The question is how you tell taxpayers they have
to pay for Soviets that they don't even want in their
country. It's a problem, but what's the alternative?"</p>
<p>At the East German Economics Ministry officials want to do
their Bonn counterparts one better. State Secretary Martin
Dube says that they would allow the Soviets to move to the
Soviet Union any company or parts of companies they consider
particularly sensitive. If the Soviets offer favorable-enough
conditions, they can even invite the workers along. He says
50 of East Germany's 8,000 companies provide the Soviets
sensitive military equipment.</p>
<p>Mr. Dube is vague about the details of how such a plan
would be executed, and a Bonn spokesman denies that West
Germany has agreed to such a step.</p>
<p>Moscow's interest in clearing up even the smallest details
of its relationships with German partners is obvious. East
Germany, its largest Warsaw Pact trade partner, provides 10%
of its imports, and West Germany, its largest West European
counterpart, provides 6%. Together, however, both Germanys
expect their combined role to grow to more than one-fourth of
all imports because of new German bank loans and greater
production uncertainties in East European countries.</p>
<p>Some West Germans wonder whether they can afford such a
relationship. West German officials have already appealed
privately to their bankers not to begin writing off bad
Soviet debts, for fear that such action might set off a
broader panic.</p>
<p>"There is growing contradiction between growing political
interests of cooperating with the Soviets and the escalating
economic difficulties of doing so," says Heinrich Machowski,
an expert on the Soviet Union at the German Economic Research
Institute.</p>
