	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund said Guyana
has regained eligibility for IMF credit after paying off
about $139 million in overdue loans.
   At the same time, a World Bank official said the South
American country also is settling its loan arrears to that
agency and will be removed from its list of ineligible
borrowers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>IMF officials said Guyana repaid its overdue loans with
the help of a "support group" of other IMF member countries,
headed by Canada and including France, West Germany, Italy,
Japan, Sweden, Britain, the U.S., Venezuela and Trinidad and
Tobago.</p>
<p>The IMF's list of ineligible borrowers still includes
Peru, Panama, Honduras, Liberia, Somalia, the Sudan, Vietnam,
Cambodia, Sierra Leone and Zambia. Most of these countries
also aren't eligible to borrow from the World Bank.</p>
