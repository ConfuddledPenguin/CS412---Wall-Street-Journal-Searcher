	<p class="article-leader">Degussa AG, a West German metal and chemical company, said
RWE AG, West Germany's largest utility and energy concern,
agreed to boost its interest in Nukem G.m.b.H. to 90% from
55% by acquiring a 35% stake from Degussa. Financial details
weren't disclosed.
   The deal would complete the reorganization of the West
German nuclear fuel-processing company, which ran into
trouble in 1987, following charges of bribery of government
officials and breaking rules in shipping and storing nuclear
materials. In early 1988, Degussa took management control of
Nukem, but RWE subsequently became the parent of Nukem when
RWE raised its stake in the company to 55%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Degussa said the reorientation of Nukem away from the
nuclear industry and toward environmental, solar energy and
process-engineering technology has been successful, but has
strengthened the company's affinity to the activities of RWE.
For that reason, Degusa said, both companies agreed that "RWE
should take more shares in Nukem."</p>
