	<p class="article-leader">The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that a landfill
operator's insurance policies cover damages resulting from
pollution that occurred over many years. Whether insurers are
liable for costs associated with gradual pollution has been
the subject of extensive litigation in the nation.
   The decision marks the first time Wisconsin's highest
court has interpreted a key provision in standard commercial
liability insurance policies, known as "the pollution
exclusion." The provision hasn't been used widely since 1986.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Insurers have contended that under the provision
policyholders are not covered for damages arising from
pollution that was released gradually into the environment.
Policyholders counter that they are entitled to coverage
under the provision as long as they didn't intentionally
cause or expect the pollution.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin dispute involves a suit filed by 120
property owners who reside near a landfill site operated by
Land Reclamation Ltd., a landfill operator in Racine. The
residents allege that Land Reclamation violated environmental
laws in its operation of the site, resulting in water
contamination, decreased property values, and unpleasant
odors. Land Reclamation denies the charges.</p>
<p>The residents sued the company and its insurer, Bituminous
Casualty Corp., seeking $9.6 million in compensation for
property damage. A lower court dismissed the case against
Bituminous, a subsidiary of Chicago-based Old Republic
International. Land Reclamation appealed the decision.</p>
<p>In a 6-1 decision, the state Supreme Court found that the
meaning of the "pollution exclusion" was ambiguous and must
be interpreted in favor of the policyholder. The court also
ordered Bituminous to pay Land Reclamation's legal costs.</p>
<p>In a dissent, Judge Donald W. Steinmetz said the court's
decision means that an insurance policy "now becomes a deep
pocket to pay for business mistakes."</p>
<p>In a ruling that clashes with the Wisconsin decision, the
Massachusetts Supreme Court last week found that the
"pollution exclusion" bars coverage for gradual pollution.</p>
<p>Peter Lardner, president of Bituminous, said the company
hasn't yet decided whether to appeal. "This continuing series
of conflicting court decisions contributes to more confusion
between customers and companies," he said.</p>
<p>"It was important for us to know that we now have
insurance coverage," said Joe Muratore, a Racine lawyer for
Land Reclamation.</p>
<p>Allan D. Krezminski of Schoone Ware Fortune & Leuck in
Racine, a lawyer for the residents, said the decision may
spur settlement negotiations.</p>

<p>INSIDER-TRADING CASE against Kidder, Peabody to proceed.</p>
<p>A state court judge in Dallas denied Kidder, Peabody &
Co.'s request to dismiss most of the claims filed against the
investment banking firm by Dallas-based Maxus Energy Corp.</p>
<p>Maxus Energy, formerly Diamond Shamrock Corp., alleges
that it paid more than it should have in its 1983 acquisition
of Natomas Co. because inside information was passed by
former Kidder investment banker Martin A. Siegel to
arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky.</p>
<p>Kidder Peabody, contending that it knew nothing of the
alleged insider trading, won a ruling in mid-April from a New
York federal judge that the banking firm wasn't liable to
Maxus for damages.</p>
<p>Kidder cited the New York ruling last week when it argued
before state District Judge Adolph Canales of Dallas that
most of Maxus's claims should be dismissed.</p>
<p>But Judge Canales ruled this week that Maxus's case
against Kidder could proceed. The judge didn't give any
reason for his ruling. An attorney for Kidder declined to
comment on the decision.</p>
<p>The case won't be scheduled for trial until after Oct. 1
to allow Mr. Boesky to testify, if needed, at the sentencing
of Michael Milken, former head of junk bonds at Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.</p>

<p>DEFENSE LAWYERS predict Panama will not thwart a pact on
Noriega's legal fees.</p>
<p>Just as the U.S. reached an agreement that ended a
two-month squabble over legal fees for the deposed dictator,
the government of Panama has piped up, saying Panama should
have first claim to any unfrozen funds.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys say they aren't worried, even though an
attorney for the Panamanian government, Gregory Craig, said
he intends to file civil suits against Mr. Noriega for more
than $5 billion for a host of alleged misdeeds, including
murder.</p>
<p>Judge William M. Hoeveler indicated he will give priority
to Mr. Noriega's right to a fair trial over any civil claims.
Thus, the defense is confident the judge won't entertain any
requests to take away Mr. Noriega's kitty for legal fees.</p>
<p>In an interview, Judge Hoeveler acknowledged that Panama
could petition foreign governments to freeze the accounts,
just as the U.S. did. "Where the money is out of the country
and controlled by a foreign entity, it may be entirely out of
my hands," he said.</p>
<p>However, while Panama could itself seek to freeze the
accounts, the defense lawyers doubt the government of Panama
would do anything to aggravate the U.S., which has finally
come through with funds to rebuild the battered country.</p>
<p>"Panama could ask foreign governments not to unfreeze the
accounts," says Jon May, an attorney for Mr. Noriega. "But if
it's not in the interest of the U.S., it may not be in the
interest of Panama to do it."</p>
<p>Frank A. Rubino, another defense attorney, described the
appearance in court Wednesday by Mr. Craig, an attorney with
the Washington, D.C., law firm of Williams & Connolly, as
"grandstanding."</p>
<p>Mr. Craig couldn't be reached for comment.</p>

<p>JUDGE ACCUSED of conflicts will continue to hear
California antitrust case.</p>
<p>A Los Angeles federal judge ruled that U.S. District Judge
William L. Gray can preside over a multimillion-dollar
antitrust case involving six big oil companies.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, attorneys for the plaintiffs had
requested that Judge Gray recuse himself from the case
because of various alleged conflicts of interest. Among other
things, the attorneys noted that the judge's wife held 10
shares of stock in Chevron Corp., a defendant in the case.</p>
<p>The 78-year old judge, who has presided over the case
since its inception in 1975, refused to step down. Federal
Judge Robert M. Takasugi this week denied the plaintiffs'
motion to disqualify the judge on the condition that Mrs.
Gray sell the Chevron stock.</p>
<p>Judge Gray said the shares were sold the day before the
ruling. "I'm delighted that it's over," he said. "I was very
much embarrassed about the motion which challenged my
impartiality and integrity. My reputation has been
vindicated."</p>
<p>In the case, the city of Long Beach and the state of
California allege that the six companies conspired to pay
artificially low prices to the state and city for oil
produced from state-owned tidelands. Among the defendants are
Unocal Corp., Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell
Oil Co. unit, Exxon Corp. and Texaco Inc.</p>
<p>Gary Hoecker, a Los Angeles attorney for Long Beach, said:
"We will decide Friday whether to abide by Judge Takasugi's
ruling or to appeal."</p>
