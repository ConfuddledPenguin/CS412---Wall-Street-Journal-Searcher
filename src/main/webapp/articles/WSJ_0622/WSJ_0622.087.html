	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL -- Foreign Minister Choi HoJung leans back in his
chair in his elegant office in downtown Seoul and recalls his
first diplomatic mission: "to negotiate for surplus
agricultural products from the U.S." South Koreans were
hungry after three devastating years of war, and selling free
food was a key source of revenue for the government.
   From this unpromising beginning, South Korea has become
one of the wonders of the developing world. Its per-capita
income has increased from less than $90 in 1953, when the
Korean War ended, to nearly $5,000 today. National pride,
devastated by the division of the peninsula and 35 years of
brutal Japanese colonization, has rebounded. Most important,
massive popular demonstrations in June 1987 against the
dictatorship of Chun Doo Hwan forced his protege, Roh Tae
Woo, to concede to demands for political liberalization. The
Seoul Olympics in 1988 were the high-water mark of national
hubris. Here we are, South Korea could boast, with an elected
government, 12% economic growth, and we beat Japan in the
medal count.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But these days the talk in Seoul, a tidy high-rise city of
10 million people, is not of achievements, but of national
angst. In 1989, economic growth slipped to 6.7%, in part
because of crippling strikes, and crime surged. This year,
though growth has picked up, the stock market has been
unsteady, exports have slowed and inflation hit a nine-year
high in April.</p>
<p>Among the public, the fact that democratization has not
meant that things are better every day in every way has been
difficult to accept. The student left has picked up on this.
"Yes, I want the present government to fall," says a Mr. Lee,
a forestry student in a Seoul university attending an
anti-government demonstration. "We can't wait for an election
because a fair election is not guaranteed."</p>
<p>Mr. Lee is untroubled by the contradiction of encouraging
democracy by bringing down a freely elected government. And
he is not alone in his somewhat skewed perspective of how
democracy works. It is not unusual to hear middle-class
Koreans say that what the country really needs is a strong
leader to get things cracking, sort of like a dictator, but
nicer.</p>
<p>It was in this context that Mr. Roh, elected president in
December 1987, announced this January the merger of the
Democratic Justice Party with the second- and third-largest
opposition parties, respectively led by Kim Young-Sam and Kim
Jong-Pil, a Chun ally and founder of the Korean Central
Intelligence Agency. Their merger into the Democratic Liberal
Party (DLP) was supposed to guarantee political stability.
With 220 of the National Assembly's 299 seats, the idea was
that the party could work its will.</p>
<p>It hasn't worked out that way; the ruling party did poorly
in two by-elections against the upstart Democratic Party,
composed of assemblymen opposed to the merger, and the DLP's
approval rating has sunk as low as 8.9% in opinion polls.
This month's agreement to establish diplomatic relations with
the Soviet Union could be the first step toward turning the
tide, but for now the DLP is about as popular as Chun Doo
Hwan, who is in self-exile in a remote Buddhist monastery.
"Everything has ups and downs," says Lee Hong-Koo, the
president's senior political adviser. "In this case we had
the downs first."</p>
<p>While five months is far too short a time to judge the
merger experiment -- the appropriate tests are this year's
local elections and the 1992 national elections -- the gap so
far between expectations and reality illustrates the promise
and the problems of Korea's nascent democracy.</p>
<p>"We had to merge to create one party in order to pass the
laws and execute the policies" the country needs, says DLP
chairman Kim Young-Sam, who ran second to Mr. Roh in the 1987
elections. Not everyone sees such altruism in the merger,
noting the decision was made secretly and announced suddenly.
Just three years ago, Mr. Kim accused Mr. Roh of stealing the
election; his willingness to join his former rival is widely
seen as a ploy to position himself for the presidency in
1992.</p>
<p>Much of the popular unease is derived from that fact that
having long lived under dictators, people are wary of what
looks like an attempt to create a one-party system. The
problem is that the four-party system that preceded the
merger did not work. By winning only 125 of the 299 seats in
the 1988 elections, President Roh's party was easily blocked
in the National Assembly. The DLP sees itself as a natural
way to break this logjam; the public does not yet trust it.</p>
<p>The natural response would be to create a strong
opposition force. Along these lines, the Democratic Party has
proposed merging with the Party for Peace and Democracy,
which has 70 seats in the National Assembly. The problem is
that the Democratic Party is demanding that Kim Dae-Jung step
down from the leadership as the price of merger. Not
surprisingly, Mr. Kim is unwilling to commit political
hara-kiri to accommodate the DP, which has only eight
National Assembly seats.</p>
<p>These maneuverings are being played out against a
background of popular uncertainty whether the country will be
able to manage the simultaneous transition to a more
sophisticated economy and a democratic political order. "The
welfare of the average citizen is deteriorating," says a
Daewoo factory worker.</p>
<p>Some of that frustration finds an outlet in
anti-Americanism; it's easier, and for students anyway, more
fun, to blame the Yanks for everything from North Korea to
farm problems. "The unification of the DLP is done by U.S.
control," says a Korean student of German literature.
"Control of the military is also done by the U.S." This kind
of thinking is a minority attitude, but nonetheless
influential, if only because activists kick up a fuss with
such methods as attempting to firebomb the U.S. cultural
center in Kwangju at its reopening earlier this month. At
bottom, it is rooted in the idea that everything on the
peninsula is within America's power to change. That
perception is flawed -- the trade hawks in Congress only wish
it were true -- and as insulting to South Korea as it is to
the U.S.</p>
<p>South Korea is going through a period of economic and
social uncertainty these days, but these are natural problems
generated by the startling progress it has made. The issue is
not only what policies Koreans should adopt, but what
process. Under dictatorial presidents Park Chung Hee and Chun
Doo Hwan, who ruled consecutively from 1961 to 1987, Korea
enjoyed 8% growth and not nearly enough freedom. Of late,
there has been less growth and more freedom. It can have both
-- but it will require staying the democratic course, even
when, as now, the going gets rough.</p>
