	<p class="article-leader">HOME SAVINGS BANK directors halved the quarterly dividend
to 18.75 cents a share, payable July 19 to stock of record
July 6. The move stems from "continued pressure on earnings,"
which in turn has resulted from weak real estate markets, the
New York-based savings bank said. Home has reported that
first-quarter earnings fell 32% to $4.1 million, or 34 cents
a share. The payout cut on Home's more than 12 million shares
outstanding is unrelated to, and should not affect, the
bank's plan to be acquired by H.F. Ahmanson & Co. of Los
Angeles for $300 million of stock, Home said. In national
over-the-counter trading yesterday, Home Savings shares fell
50 cents to $19.50.</p>
