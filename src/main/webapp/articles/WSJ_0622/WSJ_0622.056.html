	<p class="article-leader">Another socialist politburo has suffered a major setback
at the polls. This time the victor is not a charismatic labor
leader or a tousle-haired playwright but rather Islamic
fundamentalists. And so the world now sits up and wonders if
Algeria is about to become another Iran.
   Algeria need not devolve in that fashion. The unexpected
success of the Islamic Salvation Front in the municipal and
provincial elections last week signifies more about the
post-colonial past than it does about some fundamentalist
future.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Arabs have a saying that "the state eats the green and
the dry." They mean that an authoritarian government consumes
everything in its path. It captures the labor unions, the
guilds, the bar and the middle classes. It allows no
bourgeois opposition and renders exiled political leaders
almost powerless by strangling their domestic support. There
is only one refuge, the church. This has been the pattern in
Algeria.</p>
<p>These are the first elections the post-colonial Algerian
government has permitted. While stifling dissent, the rulers
created a rich and corrupt apparatchik class. Meanwhile, oil
wealth was squandered on huge industrial public works, farms
were collectivized, the currency inflated and the young
denied opportunity (in sum, a familiar Third World scenario).</p>
<p>Inevitably, opposition to the government flocked around
Islam, as opponents to communism in Poland flocked around the
Catholic church.</p>
<p>Also, the Algerian population is overwhelmingly young, and
concentrated in urban centers along the coast. Unemployment
has been as high as 22% nationwide and 50% among the urban
poor. Throughout the Islamic crescent these idle young have
been the breeding ground for fundamentalist revolution. The
half educated young urban poor are nurtured by the welfare
organization that fundamentalists sponsor.</p>
<p>But one of the peculiarities of Algeria is that while the
opposition is hostile to the legacy of socialist misrule, it
is not mainly composed of radical anti-moderns. Nor do most
supporters of the opposition despise the West or their
current president, Chadli Bendjedid. Indeed, President Chadli
is credited for having begun to open up his nation's
political system, and for allowing this election. Many of
those who voted for the fundamentalists would support a
secular opposition if one existed.</p>
<p>The proper course now would be to throw the political
doors wide open. The Algerian government should allow an
array of non-fundamentalist opposition parties, and reduce
the danger of an Islamic revolution. The worst course would
be measures to stifle dissent.</p>
<p>Too many Western commentators develop brain lock-up when
confronted by Islamic fundamentalism. Rather than being
imprisoned by the experience of Iran, the world might better
view these election results as an Eastern European democratic
revolution stuck in an Arab context. It even comes complete
with a reassertion of ethnic, in this case Berber, identity.
If real reform continues, the election results aren't likely
to lead to an Islamic revolution, or a wave of chaos and
emigration.</p>
