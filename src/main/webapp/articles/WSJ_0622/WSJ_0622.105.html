	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Citing a lack of evidence presented by
prosecutors, a federal judge dismissed 11 of the 41 counts
against John A. Mulheren Jr.
   Mr. Mulheren, the former chief of Jamie Securities Co.,
has been on trial since early last month. He has been charged
with conspiracy, securities and mail fraud and keeping false
records. The government has alleged that Mr. Mulheren
conducted numerous illegal securities trades with Ivan F.
Boesky, the convicted former stock speculator.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum dismissed many of the
counts that charged Mr. Mulheren with mail fraud. The judge
said there was no showing that Mr. Mulheren had defrauded his
limited partners by many of the actions he is accused of in
those counts.</p>
<p>Thomas Puccio, attorney for Mr. Mulheren, said he is
pleased the judge dismissed the charges. Assistant U.S.
Attorney Alfred Pavlis wouldn't comment on the matter. A
federal jury is likely to begin deliberations in the case
late next week.</p>
