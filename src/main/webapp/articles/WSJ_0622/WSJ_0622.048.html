	<p class="article-leader">"We're cutting out a lot of the little fringe benefits we
used to indulge in," says Sandra Mitchell, a teacher's aide.
"We're not eating out as much. We're a little more
conservative in spending for clothes. We usually take two to
three vacations a year; now, we're only taking one."
   The 43-year-old Garden City, Mich., woman and her husband,
a Chrysler worker, are cutting back because, she says, "we
don't feel as safe about the economy -- to invest or
anything."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Mitchells' caution, which she attributes partly to the
savings-and-loan mess, is significant because it's so in
vogue. American consumers aren't tapping out of the spending
game, but they are cutting back. A few economists think
consumer spending, which accounts for an elephantine
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, is weakening
enough to bring on a recession, and even the vast majority,
who aren't so pessimistic, are getting warier.</p>
<p>They all cite recent statistics. In May, retail sales fell
0.7%, completing the first three-month slide since the
1981-82 recession. Sales were down for autos, hardware and
building materials, furniture and general merchandise; only
apparel sales rose, after a decline in April. And in the
first 10 days of June, sales of domestic cars and trucks
skidded 13.1%, in a continuation of Detroit's marathon
demolition derby.</p>
<p>Moreover, the outlook isn't very promising. The Conference
Board's index of consumer confidence fell only slightly in
May, to a reading of 106.7 from 107.3 in April, but it was
down 10 points from a year earlier. A May survey by Leo J.
Shapiro & Associates, a Chicago market-research firm, found
consumers pulling back. Half the 450 respondents -- the most
since 1983 -- said they were buying less clothing, and 34%
are reducing their standard of living.</p>
<p>Leo Shapiro discerns more worry about the economy than
about personal finances. "Six in 10 people now feel the
nation is in trouble, but they're confident about being able
to cope personally," he says. The percentage of respondents
saying "things are getting worse for the country" jumped four
percentage points to 57% last month after creeping higher
since January. "More consumers expect layoffs ahead," he
adds, "and more are tightening their budgets."</p>
<p>Even many people not especially worried about losing their
jobs are spending less because their incomes are down. Roy
Kaye, an Atlanta printing-company salesman, says his earnings
have declined 10% to 15% lately because of the soft
advertising market. He recently paid off his home mortgage
because he fears that interest rates will rise while his
income shrinks. "I spend, but I also save," he says.</p>
<p>Stephanie Bowman, a 33-year-old St. Louis mother of four,
is spending less because her husband's business -- selling
shoe leather to domestic shoe companies -- is off
"drastically." She says she has started shopping for
children's clothes at garage sales. At one recent garage
sale, she says, she bought a $5 dress for her five-year-old
daughter and 50-cent shorts for two of her three sons. "I do
it because it's a lot cheaper and I don't see anything wrong
in buying garage-sale items if they're in good shape," she
says.</p>
<p>Such consumer caution doesn't prove that an economic
downturn is at hand. However, "modest growth in consumer
spending is essential to keep the economy from slipping into
recession," comments David H. Resler, the chief economist at
Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York.
Deficit-wracked governments at all levels are in a poor
position to step up spending to keep the 7 1/2-year expansion
going. Corporations, with profits weak, are continuing to
slash costs and are beginning to hold down increases in
capital outlays. Exports, though a bright spot, aren't likely
to grow abruptly, as they did in 1988 and 1989 with the aid
of a sliding dollar. Last month, housing starts fell again to
their lowest level since October 1982.</p>
<p>But though conceding that overall demand is sluggish, most
economists, including Mr. Resler and the Conference Board's
executive director, Fabian Linden, don't see a recession
looming. The June survey by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a
Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, finds 51 forecasters predicting,
on the average, a 1.9% increase in inflation-adjusted gross
national product this year, down only slightly from a 2%
growth forecast last month. They expect consumer spending,
more than half of which goes for services, to rise 2.1% in
1990, compared with a 2.7% gain last year.</p>
<p>However, the steady weakening of consumer spending is
adding force to the warnings of the more pessimistic
forecasters. For example, A. Gary Shilling & Co., a New York
consulting firm whose longstanding recession forecast dates
back to August 1988, observes in its latest quarterly review
that "the free-spending American consumer has been the major
factor in the long global expansion of the 1980s, living high
on the hog on borrowed money."</p>
<p>Now, Shilling economists see indications that "consumers
may be trying to hold down their everyday spending."</p>
<p>The reason: "a fragile employment picture." If temporary
census workers are excluded, they say, the average monthly
growth in nonfarm payrolls in the first five months of 1990
was 135,000, compared to a 200,000 monthly average in all of
1989 and 275,000 in 1988. Manufacturing employment has fallen
in 13 of the last 14 months.</p>
<p>Worried about jobs and inflation, "consumers already seem
to be sensing that employment and income prospects are not as
robust as they used to be," the Shilling firm comments, "and
are becoming more frugal. . . . More saving means less
spending and pulls down the contribution that the consumer
makes to economic growth."</p>
<p>Michael Healy, a 47-year-old now living in San Francisco,
knows more than he cares to about employment problems. He was
the chief executive officer of Hibernia Brewing Co., an Eau
Claire, Wis., firm that went bankrupt in 1988 following a
product recall. Because he had used his two homes as
collateral when he borrowed money for the company, he lost
almost everything he owned. Today, he lives off his savings
and with some help from his brothers.</p>
<p>"I'm not doing much of anything. I've really become very
frugal. I used to travel first class, get custom-made suits
and buy a new car every three years," he says. "Now,
vacations are out. New clothes are out. And my car is five
years old."</p>
<p>On Wall Street, another bear is David B. Bostian Jr., the
chief economist at the Jesup & Lamont Inc. securities firm,
who voiced optimism for years -- not even forecasting a
recession in the wake of the 1987 stock-market crash -- but
changed his tune last August. Since then, he has been
predicting "a mild recession" this year but "a buoyant global
economic expansion later in the decade."</p>
<p>In his 1990 recession forecast, he cites a persistent
decline in corporate profits; the "rapid expansion" of state
and local budget deficits as well as the federal deficit, all
of which he believes "indicate recessionary conditions";
weakness in manufacturing and real estate, including home
construction; and "loan losses and credit restraints in the
banking system." He adds that "even the initial impact of
reduced military expenditures will prove recessionary," with
each $1 billion reduction in the $300 billion defense budget
possibly costing 35,000 to 40,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Above all, Mr. Bostian emphasizes the country's debt
burdens, which he says are "like a lead weight around the
neck of the economy." He notes that the total debt -- public
and private -- has swollen from $5.5 trillion in 1982 to more
than $11 trillion. Because of high consumer debt, he adds,
economists counting on consumer spending to keep the
expansion going are indulging in "almost a pipe dream for the
simple reason that the increase in consumer debt has been in
a parabolic upward move."</p>
<p>Some consumers are pulling back because of parabolic
increases in their personal debt. Timothy J. Lane, of Garden
Grove, Calif., went on a credit-card binge 2 1/2 years ago,
and it took him nearly two years to pay off his borrowings.
Now, the 30-year-old, unmarried engineering geologist doesn't
want to buy anything he can't pay for right away. "I don't
want to get besieged again," he says. "I have three major
credit cards, but I limit use of them as much as possible."</p>
<p>Agreeing that "consumer debt expanded at an unprecedented
rate in this cycle, especially in 1985-87," Alexander P.
Paris of Barrington Research Associates believes that
probably "we'll pay for the profligacy on the installment
basis, just as the debt was incurred." The price? "Economic
growth below potential" and "higher interest rates and
inflation than would ordinarily be associated with that level
of growth."</p>
<p>Many economists who aren't forecasting a recession are
hedging their optimism a bit. Commenting that "domestic final
sales are likely to show no growth," economists at Merrill
Lynch & Co. add in a June report: "We still think the economy
can muddle through and avoid a fullfledged recession. But the
risks are clearly rising."</p>
<p>And Jay N. Woodworth of Bankers Trust Co., who is
forecasting 2% growth in real GNP this year, recently told
Blue Chip subscribers: "Last fall, we couldn't see the roots
of a possible recession in 1990. Now, we can. The slowdown in
money growth, and the squeeze on the availability of credit
in the U.S., Japan, the U.K. and Canada make us very worried
about the outlook for the second half of 1990. The
deceleration in the growth of money and credit is heading
toward classic `crunch' proportions."</p>
<p>A possible credit crunch is exactly what is worrying Stacy
Farmer, who runs a janitorial-services company in Atlanta and
says he has been paring his spending for two years. Although
his income has edged higher, he doesn't plan anytime soon to
replace either of his family's two cars, each of which has
racked up more than 100,000 miles. He also won't use credit
cards.</p>
<p>And even some new-job holders are watching their spending.
Sanford Scheller, 32, moved to Los Angeles from Washington,
D.C., six months ago and could find only a lithographer's job
that doesn't utilize his 14 years of experience in photo
reproduction and graphics design. So, he is saving money to
study computer graphics, and frugality is the key to all his
plans.</p>
<p>"The phone, the car, the roof over my head -- that's it,"
he says. "To do anything more would be frivolous. Coming to a
new area and not knowing what to expect, it's the only thing
you can do."</p>
