	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Soviet Union is quietly moving nuclear
warheads out of the Baltics and its volatile southern
republics and into parts of the Russian republic considered
politically stable, strategic experts and Sovietologists here
and abroad say.
   The unobtrusive shift of weapons is taking place not out
of fear of foreign attack but because of worries that a
nuclear warhead could fall into the wrong hands internally.
That is exactly the scenario that U.S. Defense Department
officials and leaders of the military committees on Capitol
Hill have been worrying about lately.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But no one is more concerned than the Soviets themselves,
who have been telling U.S. officials and experts that the
U.S.S.R. has moved to consolidate its control over its
estimated 33,000 nuclear warheads.</p>
<p>Rising levels of crime, thefts of conventional weapons
from military bases, attacks on military units, accidents and
personnel problems within the military have accelerated the
effort. It appears to focus, at least in part, on bringing
tactical nuclear weapons such as short-range missiles,
nuclear artillery and bombs into the Russian republic.</p>
<p>"The irony is that here we are in a day and age when the
threat of nuclear war has gone down, but the risk of an
inadvertent release or an accidental war increases," says
Sen. Timothy Wirth, a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and one of a number of U.S. officials who have been
told about the consolidation and the fears driving it.</p>
<p>The move isn't thought to include strategic nuclear
weapons, and so doesn't constitute a major change in the
balance of superpower nuclear weaponry. But it does
underscore the Soviet government's concerns about its own
internal situation.</p>
<p>The Soviet Embassy in Washington didn't have any comment
yesterday. Several Bush administration officials also
declined to comment, citing the extreme sensitivity of the
situation. However, one senior U.S. official, confirming the
movement, said: "I don't regard it as an act of desperation,
I regard it as an act of extraordinary caution."</p>
<p>There appear to be two basic Soviet concerns about their
nuclear warheads.</p>
<p>The first involves the potential for a breakdown of
central authority in the Soviet Union and the specter of
civil war that could follow. History is punctuated with civil
wars, but none has yet occurred in a nation with a vast and
most potent nuclear arsenal sprawled in hundreds of sites
across its vast landscape.</p>
<p>Until now the Soviet Union has been regarded by many U.S.
experts as having more-thorough safeguards protecting its
nuclear weapons than does the U.S., partly because the
Soviets have a secret police force and a strong tradition of
central command and control.</p>
<p>But what happens if the central control breaks down? That
is a worry that Sen. Wirth says he first began hearing a year
ago during a meeting with Soviet scientists in Boston,
several of whom have worked in the Soviet nuclear weapons
program. "Who controls nuclear weapons? That was their
concern. The command structure is controlled by a handful of
people in a committee. What happens if that committee is
fighting each other?"</p>
<p>The second concern involves the theft of one or more
nuclear weapons that could occur if an isolated Soviet
storage site were overrun by rebel forces. This became more
than a speculative possibility in late January, when the
Kremlin suddenly dispatched elite Russian airborne units to
stop fighting between armed Azerbaijani and Armenian groups
around the Caspian Sea city of Baku.</p>
<p>"I was meeting with Marshal {Sergei} Akhromeyev {the
former Soviet military chief of staff} in the Kremlin in
January and I was aware they had some very important nuclear
storage sites outside of Baku," recalls William J. Perry, a
former U.S. undersecretary of defense. "I asked him whether
they were putting extra troops around there. He said they
were." Mr. Perry is now co-director of Stanford University's
Center for International Studies on Arms Control.</p>
<p>Marshal Akhromeyev, according to Mr. Perry, further
explained that Soviet nuclear weapons are protected with
special locks, believed to be similar to the "permissive
action links" on U.S. weapons. The locks must be opened with
an electronic code before the weapons can be armed and fired.
Mr. Perry says he's not sure how much protection the Soviet
locks would provide in the case of a nuclear theft. "The only
consolation I have is that I know they're worried," he says.</p>
<p>Since last winter's Baku incident, according to Stephen M.
Meyer, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Soviet officials have said they are moving
nuclear weapons from sites south of the Caucasus, from the
Baltic republics and from more isolated bases to consolidate
them in larger, more protected sites in the Russian republic.</p>
<p>"What you are seeing is prudence," says Mr. Meyer, an
expert on the Soviet military who recently returned from
interviews with government officials in Moscow. "You wouldn't
want the Azerbaijanis taking one of these {nuclear weapons}
and turning it over to the Iranians. That's what they worry
about."</p>
<p>Soviet worries about control over nuclear weapons begin
inside the military, where the custody of nuclear weapons has
historically been given to elite forces that once consisted
almost entirely of ethnic Russians. The largest is the
298,000-man Strategic Rocket Force, a separate service, which
commands intercontinental ballistic missiles and other
longer-range nuclear weapons with some 9,300 warheads in all.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Moscow News, Col. Gen. Igor
Sergeyev, deputy commander of the Rocket Force, unburdened
himself, indicating that the elite image of his units has
begun to fade. "On the one hand, in our rocket forces there
are regiments which have not seen a single injury in the past
15 years, not a single scandal with equipment or any breaches
of the regulations. On the other hand," he added, "the number
of recruits with previous convictions doubles in every
call-up."</p>
<p>Largely because college-bound students are now exempt from
the draft, he said, more accidents are happening. "We have
more than 2,000 specialties," he added; "try and master them
when some soldiers do not even understand Russian."</p>
<p>Crime within the military, according to Gen. Aleksandr
Katusev, the chief military prosecutor, has risen by 14.5%
over the last year. One of the major problems is the theft of
small weapons, which are later sold in a burgeoning black
market.</p>
<p>This leads to more ambitious schemes. The Internal Affairs
Ministry of the Armenian republic announced last month that
two groups of armed men had stolen 21 tanks, surrendering
them to pursuing army units only after a firefight followed
by "negotiations." In a separate incident, according to an
account in the Soviet military newspaper Red Star, 40 armed
men attacked an Air Force base near the Armenian capital of
Yerevan and tried to break into a barracks before being
driven off.</p>
<p>Later reports from Armenia talk about ambushes on military
units and, in one case, a night attack on a military base
involving as many as 300 armed "terrorists." All of this,
according to Prof. Meyer of MIT, has changed the security
threat that Soviet nuclear forces must plan for. "The
political landscape has changed so dramatically that now they
have to think about what a mob of 5,000 to 10,000 people
could do," he says.</p>
<p>What could such a mob do with a stolen nuclear weapon?
According to Fred C. Ikle, under secretary of defense during
the Reagan administration, it would have great difficulty
trying to launch or explode the device.</p>
<p>He and other U.S. experts assume that the locks on most
Soviet nuclear weapons are much like U.S. technology. Without
the proper code, a weapon cannot be armed. If somehow it was
armed, electronic sensors inside the weapon would destroy it,
harmlessly, if it was not launched exactly the way it is
designed to be launched in wartime.</p>
<p>What is more likely, Mr. Ikle believes, is that the weapon
could be used as a powerful negotiating tool in a hostage
situation or sold to a nearby foreign power, such as Iran or
Iraq. "The Iranians would put it in a laboratory and fool
around with it until they figured out how to use it or blow
themselves up, whichever comes first. It's not something that
anybody in Moscow would ever want to happen," says Mr. Ikle.</p>
<p>The last line of defense for Soviet nuclear weapons in a
civil-war setting would be the KGB, according to Bruce G.
Blair, a Brookings Institution researcher who has studied
Soviet nuclear weapons since the early 1970s, when he headed
a U.S. Minuteman missile launch crew as an Air Force officer
in Montana.</p>
<p>During the 1960s and early 1970s, KGB officers assured
security by maintaining separate physical custody of nuclear
warheads, which they mated to Soviet missiles only during
nuclear alerts. More recently, he says, the KGB has begun to
rely more on automation, maintaining a separate
communications network that would electronically control
launching and arming once the codes were released from
Moscow.</p>
<p>On the eve of a civil war, he points out, the codes
themselves might be in danger. "The questions," he says, "are
whose fingers are on the button? Will those lines of
authority remain clear? Will they be exercised rationally?"</p>
<p>There are some strange scenarios here. For example, if the
Soviet Union were to break up into independent republics,
Kazakhstan, with its large Moslem population, could
conceivably become one of the world's most potent nuclear
powers. It is the site of two bases for SS-18s, the heaviest
ICBMs -- some of which are believed to be aimed at the U.S.
-- and a major long-range Bear bomber base.</p>
<p>Thus far the Soviet central Asian republics have seen far
less turmoil than either the Baltic republics, such as
Lithuania, or the southwestern republics of Georgia, Armenia
and Azerbaijan. But that could change. Earlier this week, for
example, the parliament of Uzbekistan, while not calling for
independence, proclaimed control over the republic's domestic
and foreign policy.</p>
<p>Leon Goure, a veteran Soviet analyst at Science
Applications International Corp., a California-based research
firm, believes that the predominantly Russian missile and
bomber crews would be unlikely to use nuclear weapons in an
internal struggle for control. "All these forces are
peculiarly dependent, particularly in a state of collapse, on
local authorities for food supplies," he notes. Also, Soviet
commanders would be unlikely to use nuclear weapons against
opposing units that possessed nuclear weapons of their own.</p>
<p>The U.S., with its long experience in safeguarding nuclear
weapons, may be able to provide some help to the Soviet
military in the scary period that lies ahead. Meanwhile,
congressional leaders are pushing for a re-evaluation of U.S.
nuclear controls, particularly in the Navy, which isn't
believed to have the lock mechanisms used by other services
on their nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, is exploring an offer by Yevgeny Velikhov, a
member of the counterpart committee in the Supreme Soviet, to
hold joint hearings next year to explore more effective ways
to control nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>Sen. Sam Nunn, chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, is pushing a plan to have both the U.S. and the
Soviet Union agree to hold internal reviews of their
nuclear-weapons safeguards procedures. In fact, he says, he
will try to force the issue here if the Pentagon doesn't
agree to such a review on its own.</p>
<p>The U.S., he believes, must do whatever it can to help
assure that "the evolution in the Soviet Union takes place
peacefully. I'm not one who subscribes to the theory that
civil war in the Soviet Union is in our interest. I think it
would be a very dangerous time for our world."</p>
