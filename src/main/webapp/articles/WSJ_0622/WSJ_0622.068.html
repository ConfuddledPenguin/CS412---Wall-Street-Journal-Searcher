	<p class="article-leader">BUENOS AIRES -- President Bush is going to do something
extraordinarily brave on Sept. 19. He is going to sit down in
the same room with Argentina's president, Carlos Menem.
   Whoops] Sorry. Don't say that word. Make it "Mendez," as
many Argentines do. Or be vaguer still. "El Presidente" will
do. "Just don't call him by his name," warns publishing
executive Carlos Ferrando. "It brings bad luck."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And if just uttering the name is dangerous, imagine the
peril of actually being in the man's presence. Ask tennis
star Gabriela Sabatini or speedboat racer Daniel Scioli, both
of whom have been touched by the supposed Menem curse. "That
man," says taxi driver Cesar Rojas, artfully avoiding the
obvious trap, "has bad vibes. All he has to do is go
somewhere, and terrible things happen."</p>
<p>In superstitious Argentina, such a man is a "mufa," a
cursed individual, and Mr. Menem's mufa-ness, having become
legend (and a joke), is also a political liability.</p>
<p>"Menem's bad luck" is the cover story of last week's issue
of newsweekly "Noticias." And Humor, the satirical biweekly,
ran a cover story just before the soccer games of the World
Cup began. "If we want to win," the magazine advised, "he
shouldn't go to the `Mundial.'"</p>
<p>The sports-loving Mr. Menem ignored Humor's advice and
flew to Italy to attend Argentina's opening match with
Cameroon. "I know people think I'm a mufa," he told an
Argentine radio station hours before the game. "But, today,
we'll show them it's not true. Today, this streak will end."</p>
<p>Famous last words. Cameroon, a 500-to-one shot, beat
Argentina, the defending world champion, 1-0. Humor felt
vindicated. The pro-Communist daily "Sur" was no more
charitable. It attributed the loss to: "the Mendez effect."
Argentina might have done better had Ramon Diaz been playing.
But just days after Mr. Menem had publicly suggested that Mr.
Diaz be included on the Argentine squad, he hurt himself and
was out of action for six weeks. Of course, once el
Presidente had gone home, Argentina defeated the Soviet Union
and tied Romania, so it squeaked through to the second round,
fortunately without Mr. Menem in the cheering section.</p>
<p>Argentina's soccer loss is but the latest in a string of
events that have won Mr. Menem his reputation as a mufa.
Updating the list of mufa-related mishaps, some of them quite
tragic, has become a national pastime.</p>
<p>Some posited examples?</p>
<p>Last July, Mr. Menem played a soccer game with Argentina's
national team, following which the team failed to win a game
for months. Sergio Batista, who sat out the game so Mr. Menem
could play, saw his $1 million contract to compete for an
Italian team fall through.</p>
<p>Switching to tennis, Mr. Menem played a benefit game with
Gabriela Sabatini. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Sabatini,
Argentina's No. 1 woman player, twisted her knee and was
idled for weeks.</p>
<p>In September, el Presidente went for a boat ride with
outboard racer Daniel Scioli. The next day Mr. Scioli lost an
arm in an accident.</p>
<p>To take his mind off Argentina's economic woes, Mr. Menem
went to the races. In the following week, four jockeys were
injured.</p>
<p>Having passed like a tornado through the sports world, Mr.
Menem piloted an Argentine Pucara jet. Bad for business. A
few days later, Brazil rescinded a contract to buy 30 of the
planes.</p>
<p>Mr. Menem named Miguel Roig to be his economics minister.
Five days later, the businessman had a heart attack and died.
A few weeks later, Julio Corzo, the minister of health and
social action and the president's closest friend, was killed
in a plane crash.</p>
<p>Tango singer Hugo del Carril was recovering in a Buenos
Aires hospital from a cardiovascular illness. Mr. Menem paid
a visit and, two hours later, Mr. del Carril was dead.</p>
<p>Days after Mr. Menem went to the Olmos penitentiary to
inaugurate modernization work, 33 inmates died in a blaze.</p>
<p>Just as he was about to board his plane to Kuala Lumpur
earlier this month, a truck carrying a crane crashed into the
aircraft.</p>
<p>Must more evidence be adduced? Taxi driver Carlos
Brachetti thinks not. "I hate to believe this stuff," he
says. "But one has to face facts: The man is a mufa."</p>
<p>Mr. Menem, of course, doesn't buy the line. Pressed by
reporters upon his return from his ill-fated trip to Italy
about the bad luck he seems to sow like Johnny Appleseed, an
irascible Mr. Menem said all this mufa talk is "sheer
nonsense."</p>
<p>He certainly didn't assume blame for Argentina's loss to
Cameroon. "I wasn't on the playing field," he said, adding
that no one blames Mikhail Gorbachev because Romania beat the
Soviet Union. "Argentina was never as lucky as {it has been}
under this government," he said.</p>
<p>With the nation in deep economic crisis, many Argentines
can't quite fathom that claim. But there is a rough consensus
that Mr. Menem has been a source of amusement.</p>
<p>Mufas, they say, bring bad luck to others but lead charmed
lives themselves. Mr. Menem's own luck hasn't been all that
terrific lately. He might wish to point that out next time
someone says he's a mufa. Mr. Menem's personal life has been
in considerable disarray. The reason: what Argentines call
"la crisis matrimonial," a domestic battle royal between Mr.
Menem and his wife of 23 years, Zulema.</p>
<p>The two have been on the outs, on and off, for years but
were reconciled in 1988 during the presidential campaign. No
sooner had Mr. Menem assumed the presidency, however, than
the spats resumed -- more this time over politics than over
Mr. Menem's alleged philandering, which had been an issue.
Mr. Menem, a lip-service Peronist, clashed with his wife, who
is more orthodox. She, who consorts with her husband's
critics, said Mr. Menem's entourage is corrupt. "She is my
biggest opponent," Mr. Menem grumbled.</p>
<p>Mrs. Menem moved out of the president's official
residence, saying that the phones were bugged. She moved back
in, then he moved out. He slept at the office or at the homes
of friends. She denied him access to his sash and scepter.</p>
<p>Unable to persuade his wife to leave the Quinta de Olivos,
the 59-year-old Mr. Menem issued a decree ordering her to go.
She came home one day to find that she had been locked out.</p>
<p>"Corruption is taking hold of the country," she said.
"This is much more than the breakup of a marriage, this is a
political problem."</p>
<p>Mr. Menem has handled the matter rather more firmly than
he has handled hyperinflation, and public opinion seems to
respect his actions vis-a-vis Zulema. But does that mean he
isn't a mufa? Hardly. It proves only that he's no luckier in
love than he is on the soccer field or in the cockpit. And
some Argentines, unamused by any of this, don't just refuse
to utter his name, they don't want to talk about the Menems'
cat fight at all.</p>
<p>And he, known for flamboyance, is for once lying low.
Courting the danger of meeting up with Mr. Menem, this
reporter out of a sense of professional duty and diligence
requested an interview for this story. Much to his relief, he
got no reply.</p>
