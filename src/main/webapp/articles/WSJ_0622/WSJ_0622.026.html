	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Japanese banks, hoping to cash in on the
potentially lucrative rewards of foreign-exchange dealing,
are expanding their currency trading desks in New York.
   The expansion follows, and for some banks it parallels,
the emergence of cash-rich Japanese insurance companies and
investment houses as major forex market players, according to
analysts who said the Japanese banks are going after their
share of the business that's handled in New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The U.S. market had a net daily turnover of $129 billion a
day, a survey by central banks in April 1989 found, placing
it behind the U.K. market, with $187 billion, and ahead of
Tokyo, with $115 billion. That survey is the most recent
official compilation of global forex activity.</p>
<p>Officials at the Japanese banks were quick to cite a
desire to expand their customer base, not only among Japanese
corporations, but also among non-Japanese businesses. To that
end, many of them are filling New York positions with locally
hired traders skilled in the ways of handling corporate
clients.</p>
<p>Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd., Mitsui Taiyo
Kobe Bank, the Bank of Tokyo and Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. are among the Japanese institutions adding more
traders to their currency operations in New York. Some, like
Fuji and Dai-Ichi, aim to double the number of New York
traders.</p>
<p>The yen is becoming more and more international as a
currency, said Yoneo Sakai, joint general manager in charge
of treasury operations at Fuji Bank Ltd. New York.</p>
<p>Not only Japanese corporations, but also U.S. corporations
are interested in dealing in the currency, he said, adding
that the Japanese banks have an advantage over their U.S.
counterparts because of their familiarity with the Tokyo
market.</p>
<p>While the size of the role that Japan's big institutional
investors play in currency dealing hasn't been quantified,
market observers and participants agreed it has soared since
the mid-1980s, when the Japanese began casting their eyes
abroad in search of places to invest their big trade
surpluses.</p>
<p>Life-insurance funds and other big investors have become a
force to be reckoned with in the currency market, said Dennis
Pettit, the newly hired foreign exchange manager at Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan in New York. The Japanese banks are
seeing a lot of that business and have to gear themselves up
to handle the volume, he said.</p>
<p>Nicholas Sargen, director of research at Salomon Brothers
Inc., said Japanese investors started thinking about hedging
their U.S. investments in the mid-1980s, when the dollar's
sharp depreciation wiped out much of their gains in the bond
market. Ironically, they started hedging after the dollar
started appreciating again, he said.</p>
<p>Insurance companies, investment houses and even importers
and exporters have to think about currencies much more than
they used to, said an officer at one Japanese bank's
expanding currency desk in New York. "Customer demand for
foreign exchange is getting bigger and bigger," said the
officer, on condition that neither he nor his bank be
identified.</p>
<p>"It's really hard even for us to find their hedging
ratio," said the officer, who plans to hire four new traders.
"Clearly, it depends upon the trend of the dollar and some
other currencies. It depends on the market."</p>
<p>But the Japanese haven't only been hedging more of their
long-term U.S. securities investments. They also have been
more and more willing to take short-term currency positions
that require them to have access to a dealer at any hour,
analysts said.</p>
<p>David Gilmore, foreign-exchange analyst at McCarthy,
Crisanti & Maffei in New York, said the Japanese investment
trusts and life insurance companies are doing much more
trading than they used to and need to get in and out of the
market several times a day.</p>
<p>A lot of that business is falling in the laps of U.S.
banks, he said. It's profitable and the Japanese banks
probably want to pick that up, Mr. Gilmore said. To the
extent that Japanese banks were handling those orders before,
it was through their London offices or by bringing their
Tokyo staffs in early, he said.</p>
<p>Michael Simpson, Salomon Brothers' director in Tokyo, said
that big Japanese institutions have been able for some time
to do business during New York's trading hours. Those that
didn't have a presence in New York either had direct contacts
with Japanese dealers at U.S. banks or they would run 24-hour
desks out of Tokyo, he said, adding that the long Tokyo hours
were particularly common around the release of key U.S.
economic indicators.</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson said Japanese banks have been slow to react to
the explosion in Japanese investment abroad and in the yen's
trading volume: Yen transactions against the dollar in the
U.S. climbed 145% from March 1986 to April 1989, according to
a survey conducted last year by central banks.</p>
<p>"Just because their investors are suddenly active, they
{the Japanese banks} don't open a trading room," he said.
"They tend to take their time over things. They want to be
sure of what they're doing."</p>
<p>Representatives of some Japanese banks maintained that the
growing strength of big institutional investors is only part
of the reason for their expansion.</p>
<p>Corporate business is like bread and butter for a bank,
said Keiichi Udagawa, manager of the foreign exchange
department at Bank of Tokyo in New York, where the bank has
long had a solid foreign-exchange presence. The Treasury
business is extra; it's also lucrative, he said.</p>
<p>Because of the size of its New York trading operation --
it now has 25 desks doing interbank and customer business --
the Bank of Tokyo views itself more as a competitor of U.S.
money center banks than of smaller Japanese currency
operations, said Mr. Udagawa.</p>
<p>At least in dollar-yen trading, "we compete with them
equally," he said, adding that the bank wants to expand its
capabilities in other currencies.</p>
<p>Already active in mark-yen trading, "a very important
product in the market right now," the bank wants a greater
role in trading involving sterling and the Swiss franc as
well, Mr. Udagawa said, explaining, "We like to be
diversified."</p>
<p>Tadashi Kawashima, assistant general manager at Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank's New York branch, said that until about a year
ago, 90% of his business was in dollar-yen trading. Today,
that trade accounts for only 30% to 40% of his business with
sterling, the mark and the Swiss franc taking up the slack,
he said.</p>
<p>Although the expansions would leave most of the Japanese
banks with currency desks that are still far smaller than
those of such U.S. giants as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan
Corp., some analysts said they think the move could
eventually pose a threat to U.S. banks' relations with U.S.
corporate customers.</p>
