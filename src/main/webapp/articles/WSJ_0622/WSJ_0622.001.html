	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's household spending rose an
inflation-adjusted 3.7% in April from the year-earlier
period, helped by fast-paced growth of spending by wage
earners, the Statistics Bureau of the prime minister's office
said.
   An official at the statistics bureau said the year-on-year
growth reflects a rebound from the low level of spending in
April 1989 because of the introduction of a 3% consumption
tax at the beginning of that month.</p>
