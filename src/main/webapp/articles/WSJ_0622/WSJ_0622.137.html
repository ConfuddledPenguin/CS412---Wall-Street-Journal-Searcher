	<p class="article-leader">Public Service Co. of New Mexico said it agreed to settle
all litigation with Southern Union Co., including a $100
million take-or-pay dispute.
   PS New Mexico wouldn't say how much it paid to settle the
natural-gas contract disputes, citing similar litigation with
other companies, but it did say that it will recover most of
its settlement costs from customers and has already
established adequate reserves for the rest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some of the other lawsuits arose out of PS New Mexico's
1985 purchase of Gas Co. of New Mexico from Southern Union, a
natural gas distribution company based in Dallas. Southern
Union sold the unit as part of its own settlement of a
price-fixing suit filed against it in 1979 by consumer groups
who were later joined by PS New Mexico and the state of New
Mexico.</p>
