	<p class="article-leader">INDIAN INVESTIGATION WIDENS</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>India has asked Switzerland for legal help in its probe of
what are alleged to be illegal commissions paid in the
purchase of six submarines from West Germany.</p>
<p>Swiss Justice Ministry spokesman Joerg Kistler said India
alleges large payments were made by the Kiel-based
Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft to Indian officials via Swiss
banks in connection with the submarine deal. He said the
Indian request, consisting of about 100 pages, was now being
examined to see what measures might have to be taken by Swiss
authorities.</p>
<p>Last January, accounts in four Swiss banks were ordered
frozen in connection with alleged bribes paid to Indian
officials by Swedish arms maker AB Bofors in the sale of
howitzers to India.</p>
<p>A Swiss group involved in Third World matters said the new
Indian request named more than 30 Swiss banks through which
the illegal payments, said to total about 40 million Swiss
francs ($28.3 million), were allegedly made in 1981 and 1982
in the submarine deal.</p>
<p>TAIWAN'S ELDERLY LAWMAKERS</p>
<p>The elderly members of Taiwan's legislature, who have
dominated politics for four decades without having to face
re-election, must all retire by the end of 1991, the Council
of Grand Justices ruled. The elderly lawmakers, who number
nearly 800, were elected on the Chinese mainland shortly
before the Nationalist government lost a civil war to
communist forces and retreated to Taiwan in 1949. The aging
parliamentarians, now mostly in their 70s and 80s, were kept
in office to symbolize the Nationalist claim to still be the
legitimate government of China.</p>
<p>AIR FRANCE'S CUTBACK PLANS</p>
<p>Air France plans to cut back flights on some of its
less-traveled routes and take other cost-saving measures in
the face of sluggish traffic growth, Chairman Bernard Attali
told the French business daily La Tribune de l'Expansion. He
was quoted as saying that the state carrier's traffic rose
only 1.8% during the first five months of 1990, compared with
a 4.3% rise in capacity. Included among the cutback plans is
a reduction in the number of flights to Algeria and the
Caribbean.</p>
<p>JAPANESE RICE</p>
<p>Japan will keep its ban on rice imports because rice
farmers here are "special," the agriculture minister said.
"We have opened the agricultural market, but there is a line
beyond which we cannot pass," said Tomio Yamamoto, minister
of agriculture, fisheries and forestry. A recent survey of
3,000 people by Japan's Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper indicated
that 71% favored easing rice-market controls, up from 41% in
1988.</p>
<p>PAPER FOR PRAVDA</p>
<p>Finland's paper exporters are cutting off all shipments to
the Soviet Union because they haven't been paid. The move
could affect publication of the Soviet Communist Party paper
Pravda and the official government newspaper Izvestia. The
two papers' stocks of newsprint have dwindled to a week's
supply because other Western countries already have stopped
paper exports to the Soviet Union, the Finnish report said.
An official of the Confederation of Finnish Forest Industries
said the Soviets owe Finnish paper exporters about $22
million.</p>
<p>SOVIET-SOUTH KOREAN TIES</p>
<p>The top Soviet official in Seoul said he doesn't expect
his country to begin formal diplomatic relations with South
Korea in the near future. Valery K. Nazarov, president of the
Soviet trade office in Seoul, said there would be "several
steps to overcome" before establishing ties and indicated the
process would be complex. His comments contrasted with
widespread speculation among political leaders in Seoul that
ties would be established as early as September.</p>
<p>POLISH UNEMPLOYMENT SOARS</p>
<p>Unemployment in Poland accelerated in the first two weeks
of June, the Labor Ministry said.</p>
<p>A ministry spokesman said 511,152 people, or 3.8% of the
work force, were registered as unemployed June 16, compared
with 443,222 May 31.</p>
<p>The Solidarity daily Gazeta Wyborcza forecast a further
sharp rise in unemployment during the summer. It said 6,900
enterprises had announced plans to lay off 270,000 workers by
the end of August. But the newspaper said about 45% of the
current jobless were people who had never worked before and
registered only to get unemployment benefits introduced by
the Solidarity-led government.</p>
<p>Unemployment was officially nonexistent in Poland under
communist rule. There were just 9,000 people registered as
jobless in December before the austerity measures took
effect.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>In Brussels, about 150 farmers angry about a price freeze
on their products slipped through police controls and
confronted Belgian Prime Minister Wilfried Martens in a
barber shop. "I am the son of a farmer and . . . sympathize
with you," the prime minister reportedly told the farmers,
who discussed their problems with him for a few minutes
before leaving. . . . Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
turned 37 yesterday but stayed away from scores of birthday
celebrations organized by her Pakistan People's Party. "She
is celebrating personally," a party spokesman said. "She does
not want to make it official."</p>
