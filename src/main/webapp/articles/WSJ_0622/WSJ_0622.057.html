	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks crawled marginally higher in the
last hour of trading after drifting most of the day.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 0.47 to 461.27, or
0.10%, as volume slipped slightly to 144.3 million shares
from 148.1 million Wednesday. Advancing shares beat
decliners, 963 to 916.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Institutional investors continued to step in and buy
stocks when they fell to attractive prices, said Ralph
Costanza, head of OTC trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham.
"When they see an opportunity, they step in and buy," said
Mr. Costanza.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index opened lower and drifted 1.44
before recovering. Buying among smaller investors also is
orderly and cautious, he said. Small investors appear to be
buying shares of companies researched by brokerage firms
rather than chasing after speculative stories, according to
Mr. Costanza.</p>
<p>Subaru of America was the day's most active issue, mainly
because Cantor Fitzgerald traded two blocks of more than 2
million shares each for buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. of Japan is in a pact to buy
the 50.4% of Subaru it doesn't already own. Subaru rose 1/16
to 8 1/4 on 5.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Telecredit tumbled 2 1/2 to 50 3/4 after the Los Angeles
provider of payment services said it agreed to be acquired by
Equifax, an Atlanta business-services concern. The agreement
calls for a stock swap valued at about $580 million. An
arbitrager at one large New York brokerage said the stock
stumbled because some investors think the proposed
combination may attract antitrust scrutiny. He added some
speculators had hoped Telecredit would be acquired in cash by
a larger, international finance or data-processing firm.</p>
<p>MCI Communications, the day's second-most active stock,
continued to drift, slipping 5/8 to 41 on 3.5 million shares.
Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette telecommunications analyst Joel
Gross said in an interview that shares of the Washington,
D.C., long-distance carrier reacted to a new American
Telephone & Telegraph tariff regulation that gives AT&T more
flexibility in competitive pricing. The regulation became
effective by default after the Federal Communications
Commission failed to act on the proposed tariff within a
mandated time. However, Mr. Gross said he expects federal
regulators to eventually rule against the new regulation.</p>
<p>MCI shares also have been pressured by the pending release
of FCC market-share data, which may show AT&T's market share
rising a bit. Mr. Gross added, however, that when the data is
revised it will show that AT&T's market share is continuing
to decline. He continues to rate MCI a "buy."</p>
<p>Apple Computer added 1 7/8 to 41 7/8 on more than 1.9
million shares, leading the technology group. Shares of the
Cupertino, Calif., computer maker apparently got a boost from
a market survey showing that the dollar value of the
company's sales in May rose 50% from the year-earlier level
and that its share of the domestic personal-computer market
rose in May from a year earlier, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>Westmark International leaped 2 1/2 to 39 1/2 after the
Seattle medical-equipment maker said late Wednesday that
earnings for the second quarter ending June 30 will fall at
the low end of an estimated range of 45 to 50 cents a share,
up from 39 cents a share a year earlier. The stock recently
had weakened amid some analysts' concerns the earnings
wouldn't meet that range.</p>
<p>Henley Properties added 3/4 to 6 3/4 after the Hampton,
N.H., real estate development company said it expects net
income for the second quarter ending June 30 to be about $80
million, up from $4.8 million on a pro forma basis a year
earlier. Henley also said it will sell its interests in two
trash-to-energy facilities for $10 million to Wheelabrator
Technologies Inc. That will enable Henley to reverse about
$100 million of deferred income currently included as a
liability on its financial statements and increase
shareholders' equity by that amount, the company added.</p>
<p>LDDS Communications jumped 2 3/4 to 24, a new 52-week
high, apparently after Prudential-Bache analyst Charles
Nichols initiated coverage of the Jackson, Miss., provider of
long-distance telecommunications services with a "buy"
opinion, DJPIR reported.</p>
<p>General Binding lost 2 1/2 to 18 1/2 after the Northbrook,
Ill., maker of business machines and supplies said it expects
second-quarter earnings will fall to 30 or 31 cents a share
from 35 cents a year earlier because of weaker markets and
higher expenses. That's below analysts' expectations of 38
cents a share.</p>
<p>National Media slid 1/2 to 10 1/4 after the Philadelphia
provider of direct-marketing services reported fourth quarter
net income of 58 cents a share compared with a loss of six
cents a year earlier, adjusted for a 5% stock dividend paid
at year end. National Media also said it's "actively
investigating" the acquisition of telemarketing and "direct
response" companies.</p>
<p>Drexler Technology skidded 1 15/16 to 1 5/16 after the
Mountain View, Calif., maker of optical data products said
late Wednesday that it's been unsuccessful in selling its
future license royalty payments and part of a full ownership
in its optical memory card manufacturing operation.</p>
<p>Consequently, the company said its accountants expect to
issue a qualified financial report on the company for the
year ended March 31. Drexler said its cash is adequate to
fund operations for eight weeks without cash infusions of any
kind and it plans to cut executive salaries and furlough some
employees.</p>
<p>Earth Technology dropped 1 to 7 5/8 after the
environmental consulting services company said fourth-quarter
earnings could be hurt if a weak backlog for its asbestos
consulting and laboratory services persists because of
project delays. The company also reported net income for the
third quarter ended May 25 of six cents a share, up from one
cent a year earlier.</p>
