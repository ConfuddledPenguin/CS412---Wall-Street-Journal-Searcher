	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- An unforeseen glitch in accounting for $30
billion of zero-coupon bonds sold this year to Mexico ensures
that the federal government's $3.12 trillion debt ceiling
will expire in early August.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is expected to tell
congressional leaders that the ceiling must be raised in
early August. The debt cap had been expected to expire some
weeks later, but in any event, the Treasury needs a
debt-limit increase before Congress starts its August recess.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Treasury's wiggle room was diminished by an immediate
addition of some $27 billion to the amount of debt subject to
the ceiling. That addition occurred when it was discovered
that the zero-coupon bonds sold by the Treasury to Mexico as
part of a debt-restructuring package don't qualify for a new
method of calculating zero-coupon bonds subject to the debt
ceiling. A Treasury spokesman said the department has
notified Capitol Hill of this development.</p>
<p>The Treasury had been calculating the Mexico deal as
adding about $3 billion to the amount of debt subject to the
limit.</p>
<p>The need to act on the debt bill before the August recess
could become a key pressure point for the current White
House-congressional budget summit. It also could cause
uncertainty in the financial markets regarding the Treasury's
August refunding, whose details are to be announced Aug. 1.</p>
