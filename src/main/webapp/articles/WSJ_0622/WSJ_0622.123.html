	<p class="article-leader">Conde Nast Publications Inc. may close its struggling
Woman magazine or sell the mass-market monthly to its editor,
Pat Miller, according to company executives.
   Conde Nast, a unit of S.I. Newhouse's Advance Publications
Inc., declined to comment on its plans for Woman. But the
company executives, who requested anonymity, said Conde Nast
has been frustrated in its attempts to boost advertising at
the unprofitable Woman, which is sold mostly at checkout
counters.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The magazine, acquired in 1988, was Conde Nast's first
move beyond its upscale magazines, such as Vanity Fair, Vogue
and GQ, which are aimed at affluent readers. Conde Nast wooed
Ms. Miller from her post as editor of News Corp.'s New Woman
and charged her with improving the look and editorial content
of Woman.</p>
<p>But Woman has had difficulty finding its place in the
Conde Nast empire; its editorial improvements haven't put it
in the class of other Conde Nast magazines, but at the same
time, the changes may have alienated the original readership.
And Woman has been particularly hard hit as national
advertisers cut their budgets in such magazines. In the first
quarter, Woman's ad pages dropped 16% from the like period in
1989. "The magazine is having trouble making money in this
milieu," said one Conde Nast executive.</p>
<p>Woman is still a newsstand and checkout-counter powerhouse
-- selling an average of 440,000 copies a month -- and is
patterned after established titles such as Hearst Corp.'s
Cosmopolitan and New Woman. Woman's editorial matter focuses
on "self help and relationships," Ms. Miller said, "though in
a more cheerful way than it once did. It's about women's
problems and what they could do about them." Ms. Miller
declined to comment on reports that she may purchase the
magazine or that it may be closed.</p>
<p>Industry executives noted that Conde Nast may want to
unload Woman to focus its efforts on a new magazine, Allure,
which it plans to launch next March. Allure would be the
first launch since the company successfully started Conde
Nast Traveler in 1987. More in the mold of Conde Nast's other
sophisticated titles, Allure will be "devoted to beauty,"
with stories on health, fitness, food and culture "as they
relate to beauty," according to company press releases.</p>
<p>And observers noted that Woman's editorial approach under
Ms. Miller is alarmingly similar to that of another, far more
successful, Conde Nast magazine, Self. Self's new editor,
Alexandra Penney, as part of recent changes, now emphasizes
self-help articles over stories on fitness. "The new
direction of Self is moving very close to what Woman does,"
said one Conde Nast executive.</p>
<p>Under former owner Harris Publications, Woman was
considered a cheap digest of reprinted stories. Ms. Miller
publishes largely original stories, with some book excerpts.
In her tenure, Woman's subscriptions have grown from almost
nothing to about 270,000 as of this coming September. But the
more-profitable area of circulation, newsstand and
checkout-counter sales, dropped 14% in the 1989 second half
from a year earlier. Total circulation in the 1989 period
fell 3.2% to 502,397.</p>
<p>Advertising results have been mixed, too. Publisher
Rebecca Darwin has campaigned to rid the magazine of shoddy
direct-response ads, focusing on national advertisers. But
advertisers, many of whom don't consider Woman their primary
advertising buy, have been slow to react.</p>
