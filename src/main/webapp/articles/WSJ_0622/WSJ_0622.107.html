	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Appropriations Committee approved
a $15.8 billion foreign operations bill for fiscal 1991 that
would cut U.S. military aid outside the Middle East and
impose new curbs on funds for El Salvador and non-Communist
forces in Cambodia.
   The measure reflects a temporary accord between the Bush
administration and the committee's Democratic leadership,
which agreed to soften cuts in foreign military aid in return
for Republican promises of support on the House floor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Total foreign military assistance would fall to $4.63
billion in the budget year beginning Oct. 1, down 4% from
current levels but $144 million more than was proposed by a
House subcommittee last week. Limits on military aid to
Turkey and Greece would be relaxed, but Democrats succeeded
in preserving the thrust of their proposal to begin to roll
back arms expenditures and focus more on economic development
in a post-Cold War era.</p>
<p>The committee trimmed some of its own initiatives in
development and economic programs, but aid to Eastern Europe
would still grow to almost $490 million, $189 million above
the administration's request. An estimated $800 million in
aid would be preserved to sub-Saharan Africa. And in
negotiations this week, the Treasury won a commitment of $50
million in new capital for the World Bank.</p>
<p>Senior State Department and White House advisers
participated in negotiations over the bill, reflecting
concern in both the administration and Congress about
deteriorating support for foreign aid. The $15.8 billion
total would come on top of recent supplemental appropriations
for Panama and Nicaragua. When compared with the comparable
foreign operations bill last year, the measure would
represent a nearly 7% increase in aid and related
export-credit programs.</p>
<p>The El Salvador and Cambodia provisions remain divisive,
and military aid to Turkey and Greece still would be cut by
almost 14%. Report language attached to the legislation is
sharply critical of the Turkish-backed government in northern
Cyprus, and taken as a whole, the readjustment in aid
represents a victory for the pro-Greece lobby.</p>
<p>In the case of El Salvador, 50% of future military aid
would be withheld in line with a House vote this spring.</p>
<p>And while spending would be continued for the
non-Communist resistance fighters in Cambodia, restrictions
attached yesterday were written so broadly that they
effectively would bar aid for military operations directly or
indirectly supportive of the anti-government Khmer Rouge.</p>
<p>The $50 million in new capital for the World Bank is less
than half of what the Treasury Department requested. And
while the bill would provide $70 million sought by the
administration for the new European Development Bank,
restrictions were attached in an effort to put leverage on
Western governments -- particularly West Germany -- to
forgive Poland's immense debt.</p>
<p>Apart from the foreign operations bill, U.S. contributions
to the United Nations and affiliated health and nutrition
organizations would increase significantly under a separate
$10.5 billion fiscal 1991 measure pending before the full
House. Contributions to international organizations generally
would grow by 28% to an estimated $787.6 million, and $115
million would be provided for peacekeeping organizations -- a
41% increase from fiscal 1990.</p>
<p>The same bill would provide for an expanded State
Department budget for the new fiscal year. It is accompanied
by a report that touches on the continued conflict in
Afghanistan and U.S. representation in Kabul. When Soviet
troops withdrew from Afghanistan more than a year ago,
Washington withdrew its personnel from the U.S. Embassy in
the capital. Report language inserted by Rep. Silvio Conte of
Massachusetts, the ranking Republican on the House
Appropriations Committee, calls for a review of this policy.</p>
