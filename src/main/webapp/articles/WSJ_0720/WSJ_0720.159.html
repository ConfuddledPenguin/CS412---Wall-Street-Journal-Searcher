	<p class="article-leader">Westinghouse Electric Corp., Pittsburgh, said it will
invest $20 million in a company that will purchase a nuclear
power plant in South Haven, Mich.
   While Westinghouse is a major supplier of nuclear-plant
technology, the move marks the company's first ownership
interest in a commercial nuclear plant. The diversified
company has broadcasting, financial services and
manufacturing lines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Westinghouse will have a 22% equity interest in Palisades
Generating Co., which was formed two years ago to buy the
768-megawatt nuclear generating plant. A megawatt equals
1,000 kilowatts; a kilowatt-hour is the amount of electrical
energy consumed when 1,000 watts are used for one hour. The
purchase is expected to completed next year.</p>
<p>The other principal investors in Palisades Generating are
Bechtel Group Inc., a San Francisco-based engineering and
construction firm, with a 33% stake, and the Consumers Power
Co. unit of CMS Energy Corp., with a 44% equity interest.
Consumers Power, Jackson, Mich., owns and operates the plant,
which began commercial operations in 1971.</p>
