	<p class="article-leader">`Pen' Makes Injections
   Easier for Diabetics</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>FOR DECADES, diabetics who require regular insulin
injections have faced double trouble: coping with undesired
attention and lots of paraphernalia when applying vital
injections.</p>
<p>Both problems are addressed by the Novopen, a
simple-to-use injection device produced by a unit of
Denmark's Novo Nordisk. The Novopen is compact and nonmedical
in appearance and does away with most of the gear previously
needed by diabetics.</p>
<p>A user doesn't have to bother with vials of insulin; the
dose is in cartridges that fit into the body of the penlike
device. Dosage is regulated with a twist of the Novopen's
cylindrical stem, and the injection is given with a push of a
button.</p>
<p>"People like it because of sheer convenience and the fact
you don't look like a drug addict," says Bernard Sams, 59
years old and principal designer at London's Sams Design, who
led the team that developed the pen.</p>
<p>Jorgen Elnegaard, Novo Nordisk's president of diabetes
care, says nearly 10% of the developed world's diabetics have
switched to the pen-delivery system in the past several
years. Competitors are devising similar devices, some of
which -- including the Novopen -- are available in the U.S.</p>
<p>The Novopen and other finalists in a BBC design
competition reflect a renaissance in British industrial
design. Buoyed by the nation's economic and industrial
turnaround of the '80s, the return to international
prominence follows years of such disasters as the
cockroach-shaped British Leyland cars of the 1970s.</p>
<p>The three finalists described here underscore British
skill at using common materials -- such as plastics and
unalluring metals -- in economical and user-friendly ways.
The winners will be selected in a BBC special Sunday.</p>
<p>Computer Hopes It Has</p>
<p>Keyboard to Success</p>
<p>THE AGENDA, a new entry in the "palmtop" computer market,
replicates a court stenographer's keyboard to speed typing.
But with the market already crowded, Microwriter Systems
faces an uphill battle.</p>
<p>The Agenda is a checkbook-sized computer whose 32
kilobytes (20 typed pages) of standard memory are expandable
to 96 kilobytes. It's an electronic organizer, calculator and
word processor.</p>
<p>Agenda's edge -- and drawback -- is its quick-entry text
system. It has a normal 26-character keyboard, but also
features a text-entry system called microwriting, which
allows users to type faster than most touch typists by
mastering a system of keystrokes on five extra keys.</p>
<p>Learning the system takes at least several days of
diligent study. Mastering the Agenda also means learning a
new operating system, the basic instructions on which a
computer runs, which many PC users could resist. "People who
find it is important to them learn quickly," says Sir Mark
Weinberg, Microwriter chairman. He adds that with optional
software, an Agenda can be easily hooked into an office
personal computer.</p>
<p>Though its nifty design distinguishes the Agenda from its
competitors, Sir Mark concedes that the greater marketing
muscle of such rivals as Sharp puts closely held Microwriter
Systems at a disadvantage. Microwriter is considering a joint
venture or sale of a large stake to one of a number of larger
computer markers.</p>
<p>Trying to Change</p>
<p>Image of Microscopes</p>
<p>IN VICTORIAN times, says British businessman Keith
Dunning, most middle- and upper-class British households
proudly displayed a microscope in their living rooms. But the
device's design "has changed so little over the past hundred
years that it no longer has much appeal as an object," he
says.</p>
<p>Mr. Dunning's company, Science of Cambridge, is trying to
change that. Earlier this year it began making the Lensman, a
pocket-size microscope. The Lensman magnifies images
horizontally, through an origami-like system of folded
mirrors, rather than vertically as in most microscopes.</p>
<p>The battery-powered Lensman, which weighs less than nine
ounces and is four inches wide, magnifies at 80 times and 200
times, about half the usual college-laboratory maximum.
Students are an obvious market, but Mr. Dunning hopes for
more interest from such professionals and hobbyists as
veterinarians, police officers and environmentalists who
could use portable magnifying power in their work.</p>
<p>But the Lensman has drawbacks. Many professionals need
more power than it can provide, and its light source is too
dark for some uses. Still, Mr. Dunning says Science of
Cambridge is working on both lower-powered and higher-powered
models. He says his company has sold several hundred Lensmen
since May.</p>
