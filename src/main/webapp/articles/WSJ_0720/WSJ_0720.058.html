	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Caesars World Inc. said it will make a
tender offer for the 13.4% stake it doesn't already hold in
Caesars New Jersey Inc. for $22 a share, or $48 million.
   Caesars World owns and operates hotels and casinos.
Caesars New Jersey owns and operates Caesars Atlantic City, a
hotel and casino.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Caesars World said it will make an offer next week for
about 2.2 million shares. It said it received a positive
fairness opinion for its financial adviser Wasserstein
Perella & Co.</p>
<p>A spokesman said Caesars New Jersey was set up by Caesars
World in 1978 as a unit. Later that year the company offered
units and warrants in Caesars New Jersey to shareholders,
retaining about 80%. In 1981, the company bought back enough
shares to increase its stake to its current level of 86.6%.</p>
