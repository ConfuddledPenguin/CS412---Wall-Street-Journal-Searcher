	<p class="article-leader">This week's news that housing start figures have fallen
set off another round of panic among real-estate
professionals. Some of them were already worried about
slowing home-price growth along the Eastern seaboard. Now
Chicken Littles are predicting a nationwide collapse in home
values. Many are arguing that price declines could last up to
20 years, erasing half of the value of the housing stock.
Homeowners are rightly concerned with the integrity of an
asset that typically constitutes more than 60% of their
household wealth. Financial institutions with loans
collateralized by homes, and mortgage insurers, including my
employer Freddie Mac, would also feel the crunch.
   But as with Chicken Little, the alarmist talk is overblown
generalization. In fact, we are seeing confirmation of a
widely observed but only reluctantly accepted fact --
regional economies can cycle out of sync with the nation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Let's start with the East Coast, where prices are reported
to be falling. But, "falling" against what? When an
overheated market cools down, tantalizing stories of 200%
capital gains are replaced by "ordeals" of 20% price cuts.</p>
<p>Even in the Northeast, that center of panic, the averages
are not really that bad; they certainly do not mean the
entire country is on the ropes. Statistics support a much
less alarming view. One reason for the concern may be that
the problems have finally hit the people who do the writing
-- many of America's housing analysts live in the Northeast]</p>
<p>Something that is obvious from the outside, but hard to
see when it is going on around you, is that a housing market
can turn very quickly from a rapidly expanding speculative
market to "normal" or, more likely, overbuilt status.</p>
<p>Since they last a long time, houses act as both a
consumption and investment commodity: They provide a
continuing flow of services to a resident without being fully
consumed in the process. Buying a house is just like buying a
stock that pays a dividend. You are willing to pay a price
for the house that represents the value of services -- the
dividends -- received and the price upon resale. If you
expect to hold the house a long time you will care more about
the services than the resale price. But if you are investing
for only a short time, the resale price becomes more
important than the services for determining the price you
will pay today. In both cases, the more you can get at the
time of resale the more you will pay for ownership today.
Still, speculators will be more sensitive to expected future
price movements than the "buy-and-hold" owner.</p>
<p>Price speculation will eventually reach an upper limit,
when an owner cannot find a buyer. Typically, this occurs
when buyers approach the limit of their income and
downpayment potential. If higher-income buyers do not
materialize to pay a price with a built-in expectation of a
hefty appreciation, then prices decline. If the last buyers
pay a price based on the value of services they seek to
receive, and not speculative gain, prices can stabilize.</p>
<p>The greatest threat to the growth of house prices occurs
when incomes decline during an economic contraction. A weak
economy will likely reverse expectations of rising incomes
and hence price appreciation.</p>
<p>California house prices are a good example. They sagged in
the early 1980s as much because the rapid appreciation of the
late 1970s outran income as because of a mild economic
slowdown. The Midwest experienced price declines in the 1980s
without a previous run-up in prices because income fell at
the same time as jobs left the area. Finally, the Southwest
has seen the greatest price declines because it went through
an extreme boom period that came to a halt in 1983, followed
by an extreme economic bust in 1986. All three of these areas
are now seeing price increases. According to the National
Association of Realtors, house prices in the West, Midwest
and South have risen 8.4%, 7.5%, and 1.7% respectively over
the four quarters ending in March.</p>
<p>What about the current status of the Northeast? The
National Association of Realtors reports that the median
sales price of homes in the region rose 1.5% in 1989 from a
year earlier; prices in both the greater New York area and
Boston were unchanged, while Washington was still rising at a
9% clip. This information, of course, is now a little old. If
one instead looks at the past six months, then median prices
in all three metropolitan areas have fallen 2%-5% -- partly
because smaller houses are being traded.</p>
<p>Independent information analyzed internally at Freddie Mac
is consistent with the recent Realtors' data: Our numbers
show prices flat to declining over the past six months in
Boston and Washington, and down 5% in the past year in
northern New Jersey. Nationally, we see prices still rising
at a 4% to 6% rate; regionally, the only area to see anything
less than a 4% gain is the Northeast with a 2% increase.</p>
<p>What then about the next 20 years? The reversal from baby
boom to baby bust, leading to a decline in the number of
first-time homebuyers during the 1990s, has lead to questions
about future returns on today's housing investments. But past
trends in consumption point to a continued increase in the
per-capita demand for housing services by the 35-54 age
group, which continues to grow. A consequence is that the
total level of demand for housing services will not decline,
only its rate of growth will slow.</p>
<p>The pace of new construction, the price of undeveloped
land, and the wage and employment levels in the homebuilding
industry will all provide a price cushion for this slowing
demand. In fact, the process has already begun with the news
of recession-style levels of new construction. Overbuilding
of apartments and some single-family homes, together with a
more conservative credit environment have created supply-side
problems for the industry. But beyond their potential
contribution to a nationwide recession, the current travails
of the homebuilding industry should only affect property
values modestly.</p>
<p>Those still unconvinced of the durability of home price
levels should look at statistics on home price movements over
the past 20 years, when the baby boomers entered the housing
market and drove up both the rate of new construction and
relative housing prices.</p>
<p>The best measure of price movements is the government's
price index for a home of constant quality. It attempts to
remove the effects of changes in new home prices arising
simply from improvements in construction quality and size,
and permits focusing on "pure price" inflation.</p>
<p>The annualized increase in this index from 1969 to 1989
was 7%, a mere 0.7 percentage points greater than the annual
increase in the consumer price index over the same period.
The relationship has recently reversed. The CPI has risen
more than home prices over the past 10 years. So while there
are some technical limitations with the constant quality
index, these numbers show there has been little "excessive"
inflation that needs to be reversed. And if home prices
haven't risen excessively over the past 20 years when there
was a hefty increase in demand, there is not reason to expect
a sizable decline in demand in the next 20 years.</p>
<p>The average price of houses actually sold increased at an
8.7% annual rate over the past 20 years. But because that
figure does not reflect the quality of houses being sold,
that is clearly the wrong number to use in the current
analysis.</p>
<p>There will not be a nationwide collapse in home prices.
Still, price inflation is likely to slow. Someone will have
to buy the houses the trade-up buyers are selling, and the
incomes of those buyers -- some of whom appear to be
currently frozen out of the market -- will limit the sales
prices of the boomers' outgrown homes and hence their capital
gains. Reduced demand will eventually mean lower total
appreciation. So the dynamics of demand and supply should
work well, and without catastrophe, over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>Which leads us back to the children's tale mentioned at
the start, in which a number of other birds take up Chicken
Little's cry that the sky is falling. The unsuspecting
followers get eaten by a wolf -- except for Chicken Little,
who escapes to spin her tale another day. As in the fable, it
is the investors who believe the sky is falling who will have
to bear the costs.</p>
