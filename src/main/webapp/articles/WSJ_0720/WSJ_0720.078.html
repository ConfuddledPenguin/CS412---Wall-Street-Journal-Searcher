	<p class="article-leader">PHOENIX -- The federal government and a committee
representing unsecured creditors of American Continental
Corp. provided details of a proposed reorganization plan
under which American Continental would be liquidated, Charles
A. Keating Jr. and other executives would be ousted and
Lincoln Savings & Loan Association would be dropped from
creditors' claims.
   The settlement agreement provides about $21 million for
creditors and in return insulates the government from certain
claims by these creditors. "This provides the {ACC}
bondholders with sure recovery of some assets, when they
faced dismal prospects, and it relieves the government of
exposure to litigation," said Michael Tucci, senior counsel
for the Resolution Trust Corp. "This will eliminate a lot of
attorneys' fees."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement, if approved, would also have the effect of
preventing Mr. Keating from retaking control of Lincoln, the
thrift seized by federal regulators last year a day after
American Continental filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law
protection. ACC has unsecured debt of about $350 million;
about two-thirds of that comes in the form of junk bonds,
many sold through Lincoln branches.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Keating said he'd "personally argue"
against the plan and also formally introduce a proposal in
federal bankruptcy court to buy back $500 million of
Lincoln's assets for no down payment, then manage it himself
so the U.S. doesn't lose money and creditors get another $50
million.</p>
<p>The plan, which a U.S. District Court judge in Arizona
would hear arguments on in September, also provides that
Lincoln and its subsidiaries, which filed for bankruptcy
protection along with ACC, would be dismissed from bankruptcy
protection.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the RTC, which oversees the U.S.'s thrift
bailout, would remain in control of Lincoln Savings even if
U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin, in Washington,
D.C., gives Mr. Keating approval to take Lincoln back.</p>
