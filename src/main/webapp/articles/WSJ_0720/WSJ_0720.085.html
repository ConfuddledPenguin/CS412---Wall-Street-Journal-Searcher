	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Short interest for the month ended July 13
fell 2.8% on the New York Stock Exchange but advanced 4.2% to
a record on the American Stock Exchange.
   Eli Lilly & Co., the Indianapolis pharmaceutical
manufacturer, took over the top Big Board short-interest spot
with 13,737,401 shares, unseating Varity Corp. Short sellers
appear to have targeted Lilly for the past few months as
media reports raised questions about the company's prominent
anti-depressant Prozac.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>New York exchange short interest eased to 642,585,339
shares at the July 13 settlement date from 661,212,877 shares
at mid-June. On the Amex, short interest climbed to
77,026,110 shares from a revised 73,950,683. The month
included the 19 trading days through July 6.</p>
<p>At mid-July 1989, short volume was 484,818,847 shares on
the Big Board, indicating a 33% advance, and 48,922,594
shares on the American exchange, indicating a 57% rise.</p>
<p>Traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it, betting
that the stock's price will decline and that they can buy the
shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender.</p>
<p>Short interest is the number of shares that haven't yet
been purchased for return to lenders. Although a substantial
short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's
price will decline, some investors consider an increase in
short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually
must be bought back.</p>
<p>Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may
be caused partly by arbitraging. The figures occasionally
include incomplete transactions in restricted stock.</p>
<p>The level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board
short interest ratio leaped back up to 4.53 from mid-June's
3.86; the figure stood at 4.61 in mid-May. The ratio is the
number of trading days at the exchange's average daily
trading volume that would be required to convert the total
short interest position. Average daily New York exchange
volume for the 19 trading days was 141,937,207 shares. Some
analysts suggest, however, that the ratio has weakened in
value as an indicator because options and other products can
be used to hedge short positions.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Eli Lilly said the company's policy is not
to comment on matters involving its stock.</p>
<p>For the 16th consecutive month, Continental Airlines
Holdings Inc., formerly Texas Air Corp., led the Amex
short-volume list, this month with 7,285,188 shares, down
3.3%.</p>
<p>Two closely watched issues on the Big Board dropped:
International Business Machines Corp. volume fell 14% to
4,198,541 shares, while Exxon Corp. slipped 15% to 4,662,310
shares.</p>
