	<p class="article-leader">Scripps Howard Broadcasting Co., an 80%-owned subsidiary
of the E.W. Scripps Co., said it has agreed to purchase
WMAR-TV in Baltimore from the Gillett Group Inc. for $154.7
million.
   The station, an affiliate of National Broadcasting Co.,
which is a unit of General Electric Co., recently signed a
new three-year contract to continue as the flagship station
for the Baltimore Orioles baseball team.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Gillett Group is controlled by George N. Gillett Jr.,
who for several years has been trying to sell his TV stations
to pay off junk-bond debt. Mr. Gillett, a Denver businessman,
also controls SCI Television Inc., which has had to
restructure $1.3 billion in debt.</p>
<p>Lawrence A. Leser, president and chief executive officer
of E.W. Scripps, said the company has not made a major
acquisition since 1986, "preferring to wait until an
attractive opportunity presented itself."</p>
<p>Cincinnati-based Scripps Howard Broadcasting currently
operates nine television stations.</p>
