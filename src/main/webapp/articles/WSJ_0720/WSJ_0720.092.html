	<p class="article-leader">More than 10,000 people including George Bush, Ronald
Reagan and Gerald Ford turned out yesterday for the opening
of the Richard Nixon presidential library in his birthplace
of Yorba Linda, outside Los Angeles. As always with Mr.
Nixon, there's something a little unusual about this library.
Unlike other presidential libraries, this one doesn't contain
Mr. Nixon's official papers. Congress seized some 42 million
pages of documents and thousands of hours of tapes when Mr.
Nixon left office. These remain in a Virginia warehouse.
Maybe someday Congress will decide to free these hostages.</p>
