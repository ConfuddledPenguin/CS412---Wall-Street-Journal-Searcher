	<p class="article-leader">With Barbie flying high and G.I. Joe stuck in the
trenches, Mattel Inc. may be on its way to recapturing the
crown of world's largest toy maker from rival Hasbro Inc. for
the first time since the mid-1980s. Clearly Mattel will end
the year as the world's most profitable toy company.
   Beyond satisfying some corporate egos, the mythical titles
can mean extra clout with the world's toy sellers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Being the world's largest tends to give a company some
extra shelf space and shelf life for their new products,
although the long-term results still depend on a toy's play
value," says David S. Leibowitz an analyst with American
Securities.</p>
<p>While pinning the ups and down of the toy giants on just
two toy lines is a bit simplistic, it's clear that Hasbro's
major toy line for boys has continued to be hurt by the
staying power of Nintendo and other video games, while Barbie
has flourished more than at any time since her birth in 1959.</p>
<p>Both Mattel and Hasbro reported second-quarter results
yesterday. While Mattel's sales rose 17% to a record $318
million, Hasbro's were down 8% to $277.3 million. Hasbro
still held a narrow lead for the first half, but the gap is
clearly narrowing and many Mattel employees think they'll
capture the gold ring by year end. Mattel's second-quarter
net income rose 22% to a record $20.3 million, while Hasbro's
plummeted 50% to $8.7 million.</p>
<p>Hasbro's chairman and chief executive, Alan G. Hassenfeld,
says that if anticipated improvements in customer order
trends occur and response is positive to some new toys being
shipped this quarter, full-year results should be about the
same as in 1989, when Hasbro earned $92.2 million, or $1.56 a
share, on revenue of $1.41 billion.</p>
<p>John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman and chief executive,
said the company is continuing to gain market share. The toy
maker, which recently resumed dividend payments on common
stock for the first time in seven years, previously projected
double-digit sales growth for 1990. Last year Mattel had
sales of $1.24 billion.</p>
<p>Hasbro grew rapidly in the 1980s, largely from
acquisitions but in part by spotting hot toys and marketing
them aggressively. Transformers and My Little Pony were
megahits, the kind of toys that children nag their parents to
buy. While Mattel had hot toy lines, especially He Man and
the Masters of the Universe, it took years to recover from a
disastrous plunge into electronics that resulted in a $394
million loss in 1983.</p>
<p>Hasbro's sales grew to $1.23 billion in 1985 from $107.4
million in 1981, surpassing Mattel, with its 1985 sales of
$1.05 billion, for the first time. Since then, Hasbro has
grown modestly, as it has failed to come up with any new
megahits while its hot toys of the past showed signs of
aging.</p>
<p>In reporting the 50% decline in second-quarter earnings,
for example, Hasbro's chairman cited weakening sales of two
mainstay toy lines, G.I. Joe and Transformers, which are both
suffering at the hands of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
Hasbro also plans to discontinue its Record Breakers race-car
line, which failed to meet its high expectations.</p>
<p>While Hasbro strived for volume, new Mattel management
under Mr. Amerman criticized past managers' "top line"
orientation -- which led to several years when retailers were
stuck with tons of unsold Mattel toys after Christmas -- and
concentrated on steadily improving the company's
profitability.</p>
<p>Mattel remains the largest toy company in terms of sales
outside the U.S., where many analysts see the industry's
largest growth coming this decade. Despite its general
weakness in the U.S., Hasbro says its international business
is going strong.</p>
<p>Mr. Leibowitz, the analyst, thinks it's still too early to
predict who will wear the 1990 toy sales crown. "As things
stand today it will be a very close race, and the reorders
late this quarter and early in the fourth quarter will tell
the story," he says.</p>
<p>James Eskridge, Mattel's executive vice president and
chief financial officer, is also leery of making predictions.
"Since Mattel has been at the top of the industry for so
long, it's not nearly as important for us to be called No. 1
in sales," he says. "Look, I worked for General Motors for a
lot of years, and while people can say GM is the largest,
Ford laughs all the way to the bank."</p>
<p>Likewise, says Mr. Eskridge, Mattel clearly expects its
income from operations to top Hasbro's this year. "We'll have
a very good second half, and Hasbro is saying things will
have to break right to even equal last year."</p>
<p>What if it gets down to the wire and a shipment of another
$25 million in December will win back the sales title for
Mattel? "If it means risking profitability and leftover
inventory," says Mr. Eskridge, "there's no way we'd ship it."</p>
