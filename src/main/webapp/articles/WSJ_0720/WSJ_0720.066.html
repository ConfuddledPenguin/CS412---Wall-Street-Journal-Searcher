	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- The Soviet government, revising its program of
economic changes, temporarily shelved plans to raise the
price of bread and other goods. Instead it is emphasizing the
need to press ahead with the denationalization of state
assets.
   An outline of the new-look program is due to be presented
by Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov to a meeting of the
Presidential Council today. If approved, government officials
expect Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to take swift action
to implement parts of it, using his powers as president to
issue binding decrees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The overall contents of the revamped program aren't
expected to differ substantially from Mr. Ryzhkov's earlier
proposals, which caused national uproar when announced in May
and were later sent back by the Soviet Parliament for
revision. Many key provisions, such as an overhaul of the
nation's banking system and the creation of social programs
to compensate for job losses, are likely to remain intact.</p>
<p>But the new plans will have a different emphasis,
according to Andrei Orlov, deputy head of the government's
commission on economic change. Rather than proceeding first
with attempts to overhaul the nation's topsy-turvy pricing
system, the revised program will stress the need to turn
state-owned factories over to the public. This will be done
mainly by leasing factories or converting them into joint
stock companies with shares being sold to the work force.</p>
<p>"It's a question of accelerating plans for privatization,"
Mr. Orlov said.</p>
<p>As part of its attempts to provide private-sector
competition to big industrial monopolies, the government also
has drafted new legislation allowing the creation of small
and medium-sized enterprises. Mr. Orlov said the draft is
close to being completed.</p>
<p>The program is supposed to end decades of central planning
and turn the Soviet Union into a more market-oriented
economy. Reformers inside and outside the government are
hoping it will contain provisions that explicitly legalize
private property, something still fraught with ideological
problems here.</p>
<p>They say Mr. Gorbachev appears to be more free to take
such an important step following the broad endorsement of
market-oriented changes by the Communist Party Congress
earlier this month.</p>
<p>Official data underscore the pressing need for urgent
measures to overhaul the Soviet economy. The State Statistics
Committee said industrial production fell 2% in June from a
year earlier, while wages continued to soar. In the first six
months, industrial output declined 0.7%, whereas wages rose
12%, far above the planned 7% growth.</p>
<p>The statistics, published in the Izvestia daily, showed
that the decline was largely driven by falling oil and coal
production. The decline in oil production contributed to a
50% increase in gasoline prices in Czechoslovakia this week,
and Hungary has said its oil supplies from the Soviet Union
have been cut.</p>
<p>Izvestia also said 10 million man-days were lost to
strikes, and it also blamed ethnic tensions around the nation
and "a lack of discipline" for the dismal figures.</p>
<p>Following the Presidential Council meeting, Mr. Ryzhkov
and his aides are expected to finalize details of the new
program over the next six weeks and then present them for
approval to the Parliament. Many here believe that the prime
minister's political future could hinge on the outcome. He
faced numerous calls to resign when his program was first
announced, largely because it proposed doubling or even
tripling prices of many staples, including bread.</p>
<p>Mr. Orlov said plans to raise bread prices, a move
designed to conserve grain and reduce the Soviet budget
deficit, will now be considered only after this year's
harvest. Price rises for other goods have been shelved for
longer, probably until next year, when much of the package is
supposed to be implemented.</p>
<p>The postponement of price overhaul means that a planned
devaluation of the Soviet ruble against Western currencies is
also likely to be delayed, Mr. Orlov said. Finance Minister
Valentin Pavlov and other senior officials have been pressing
for a ruble devaluation as a way to boost foreign trade. Mr.
Pavlov originally wanted such a step to be taken this month.</p>
<p>After the criticism over Mr. Ryzhkov's original proposals,
the Kremlin set up an "alternative" commission on economic
change to work alongside the government. But Soviet and
Western officials say this now appears to be a token gesture
designed to assuage government critics.</p>
<p>The commission will only hold its first meeting today, at
the same time as the Presidential Council, following the
return of its chairman, economist Abel Aganbegyan, from a
trip abroad. Mr. Orlov said it isn't likely to work out a
comprehensive program of its own to rival Mr. Ryzhkov's
plans, but will merely act as a channel for various ideas
from dissident economists.</p>
<p>One Western diplomat who has spoken to many of the
commission's members says they aren't taking the panel
seriously. Most plan to go on vacation instead of staying in
Moscow over the summer to think up a new package, he says.</p>
