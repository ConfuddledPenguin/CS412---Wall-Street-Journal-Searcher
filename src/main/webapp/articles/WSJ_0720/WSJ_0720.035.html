	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Researchers here discovered a compound that, in
test-tube studies, blocked the AIDS virus from infecting
human immune cells.
   The compound appears to work like the experimental drug
CD4, which sticks to the virus's outer coat and prevents it
from attaching to T cells, its main immune target. But unlike
CD4 -- a large, genetically engineered protein -- the new
compound is a small, simple molecule. Called CPF, it can be
made cheaply and easily by routine chemical synthesis, giving
it special promise as a drug candidate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The compound's chemical simplicity, however, may also be
its main drawback as a potential drug, researchers cautioned.
CPF has only two amino acids, or protein building blocks.
Such small molecules are especially vulnerable to breakdown
by enzymes in the body, so the drug may not last long enough
in the bloodstream to have much anti-viral effect. Major
questions also remain about its toxicity and ability to block
different strains of the AIDS virus.</p>
<p>Still, "CPF is a promising forerunner to a drug that
inhibits" AIDS infections, said Steven J. Burakoff, a
researcher at Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who led
in the CPF discovery with Dana-Farber's Robert W. Finberg and
Harvard University chemist Stuart L. Schreiber. The test-tube
studies with CPF, Dr. Burakoff added, indicate it doesn't
interfere with T cells' function -- an encouraging early sign
the drug won't have serious immune-system side effects.
Moreover, the studies showed CPF binds tightly to the
AIDS-virus coat protein, called gp120, suggesting the drug
would have specific, potent anti-viral effect if significant
levels of it can be attained in the blood.</p>
<p>The CPF finding is reported in today's issue of the
journal Science.</p>
<p>Dr. Burakoff said CPF showed no signs of toxicity in a
preliminary study in which the scientists injected high doses
of it into mice. He added, however, that "a lot more tests"
must be done before the drug can be tried in humans. A
probable next step, he added, will be tests of CPF in mice
with an AIDS-related disease.</p>
<p>In separate studies, he said, researchers will try to find
chemical cousins of CPF that best resist breakdown in the
body. The compound's structural simplicity should enable
researchers to easily spin out "analogs" of CPF in that
search, he added.</p>
<p>Dr. Burakoff said a large drug company has expressed
interest in CPF, but no contracts have yet been signed for
its commercial development.</p>
<p>Like CD4, the new compound appears promising partly
because its mode of action is different from that of AZT, an
AIDS drug that works by inhibiting replication of the virus
within infected cells. Thus, it may work synergistically with
AZT and help fight AZT-resistant strains of the AIDS virus.</p>
<p>Additionally, CPF may offer some advantages over CD4. The
new compound probably could be given orally, Dr. Burakoff
noted, compared with CD4, which is injected. Moreover,
researchers now believe that to get anti-viral effects with
CD4 in patients, they will need to use much higher doses of
it than have been tried so far in clinical studies. But
making large amounts of CD4 has proved difficult and
expensive -- problems that shouldn't apply to CPF.</p>
