	<p class="article-leader">Gillette Co., citing "extremely strong" blade and razor
sales and "strong" performance in other operations, said
second-quarter net income rose 31% to $82.1 million, or 70
cents a share.
   In the year-earlier period, Gillette had net of $62.5
million, or 65 cents a share. Sales for the period rose 14%
to $1.03 billion from $903.9 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Boston shaving and personal product concern said it
saw record quarterly sales in many of its business segments
-- including a 33% jump in sales in its blade business; a 22%
increase in sales in its West German appliance unit; and a
16% jump in sales in its Oral-B toothbrush business.</p>
<p>Gillette said shipments of its Sensor razors have "far
exceeded" expectations. To date, 17 million razors have been
shipped. Gillette said it had originally estimated 18 million
to 20 million razors would be shipped for the entire year.</p>
<p>For the six months ended June 30, net increased 21% to
$169.1 million, or $1.45, from $140.1 million, $1.45 a share.
The latest quarter and six-month results reflect preferred
dividend payments of $14.3 million and $28.5 million,
respectively.</p>
