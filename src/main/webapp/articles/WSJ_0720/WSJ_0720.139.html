	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Stotler Group Inc., scrambling to shore up its
finances, said it accepted a conditional offer from an
investor group to buy a "substantial equity interest" in the
troubled futures brokerage holding company.
   Stotler, whose chairman, Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, also is
chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, didn't identify the
group or the size of the proposed investment. Board of Trade
members said there were widespread rumors that the group
originated in Taiwan and that the conditional offer was for
at least $10 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stotler said the offer required the approval of the
group's board and that it will expire if that approval isn't
given by 10 a.m. CDT Monday. Stotler Group said this week
that without a capital infusion, it might be unable to make
certain debt payments.</p>
<p>Stotler Group officials, who announced the offer in a
brief news release, didn't return calls seeking additional
comment.</p>
<p>The company's stock rebounded on news of the proposed
investment, spurting $1 to close at $6.625 a share on the
American Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Late last week, the Board of Trade gave Stotler & Co., the
company's futures brokerage unit, until the close of business
Wednesday to boost its capital cushion supporting customer
accounts or risk being forced out of the customer business.</p>
<p>Stotler met the deadline for capital compliance -- raising
its capital to 4% of segregated customer funds -- mainly by
transferring tens of millions of dollars of customer accounts
to other futures brokers to lower its capital needs.</p>
<p>Large blocks of accounts were transferred to Rosenthal
Collins Group, LIT America Inc. and Refco Group Ltd., among
other futures brokerage firms.</p>
<p>The mass transfers, which included many of what were
considered Stotler's best accounts, left many futures
industry officials wondering whether the remaining accounts
will be sufficient to make Stotler an attractive investment.
"When you lose your quality accounts, you're not in better
shape, you're in worse shape," said a futures trader who
clears, or processes, his futures trades through Stotler.</p>
<p>If Stotler hadn't met the Board of Trade deadline, it
could have been forced to allow customers to trade only to
liquidate holdings and to transfer all its accounts to rival
brokerage firms.</p>
<p>Neither the firm nor the exchange has said what caused the
old-line grain-trading firm to slip below minimum capital
requirements. Industry officials familiar with the situation
said the problem arose when regulators determined that
certain assets and liabilities on the holding company's
balance sheet be reflected on the balance sheet of the
Stotler & Co. futures brokerage subsidiary. That action, in
turn, led the Board of Trade to find that the company's
remaining capital was shy of the futures industry's minimum
levels, exchange members said.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission regulates the
Stotler Group holding company, which is registered as a
securities dealer, and is believed to have triggered the
reclassification of the assets and liabilities. The futures
brokerage unit is regulated by the exchange and the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission.</p>
