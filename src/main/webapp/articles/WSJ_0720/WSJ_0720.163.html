	<p class="article-leader">MUNISING, Mich. -- Eden Evangelical Lutheran Church here
has two things most churches don't.
   One is an inspiring view of Lake Superior. The other is a
sauna in the basement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There's nothing incongruous about the latter, not around
here. Michigan's wild and remote Upper Peninsula is the heart
of the "Sauna Belt," the center of Finnish-American culture.</p>
<p>In nearby Hancock, street signs are in Finnish and
English. Hancock is home to Suomi College, a two-year school
founded by immigrant Finns and currently dedicated to
preserving their culture in the U.S. And down the road in
Negaunee, WLUC-TV broadcasts "Finland Calling" every Sunday
morning. It claims to be the only Finnish-language television
program in the U.S.</p>
<p>Next week, Suomi College (the name means motherland) will
play host to the eighth annual Finnfest, a celebration with
films and lectures and cooking demonstrations. Visitors will
see bumper stickers and T-shirts with this one word
emblazoned on  them: "Sisu." It means the willingness to
struggle for a cause or to complete a task, despite
apparently hopeless odds. Keep on truckin', in other words.</p>
<p>"Finns believe there is such a thing as sisu, and that
they have it," says Michael Loukinen, a second-generation
Finnish-American and rural sociologist at Northern Michigan
University in Marquette.</p>
<p>The Upper Peninsula's endless forests gave it a familiar
feel to Finnish immigrants. Today, despite a depressed
economy that has been that way for decades (since the mining
boom came and went), the area still has a hold on people. The
locals are self-effacing about their love of rural life. In
tiny Tapiola, a cartoon on the wall of the diner calls a
Finnish motorcycle a "Cowasocky," and shows a cow in socks
with a seat strapped to her back. Pictures are also displayed
of every graduating class from the town's high school. Almost
all the names are Finnish. Alas, the school closed in 1968,
and now students are bused to Houghton, not far away.</p>
<p>Finnish America is struggling to survive. Finnish
immigrants raised their children to be Americans, and
succeeded. The immigrants' grandchildren, now mostly in their
30s and 40s, typically don't speak the language of their
grandparents, and thus don't attend the Finnish-language
services offered at nearly a dozen Lutheran churches in the
state.</p>
<p>The average age of people at Finnfest has been 60-plus.
This year's festival will try to draw a younger crowd, using
as a lure a live concert by Miljoonasade, Finland's most
popular rock band. Two Upper Peninsula school districts, in
L'Anse and Baraga, are resisting the assimilationist tide by
offering an optional, once-a-week class in Finnish language,
culture and history for children from kindergarten through
the sixth grade.</p>
<p>But it is far from clear how successful these efforts will
be. "Finnish culture in America is slowly dying," says Timo
Koskinen, an English instructor at Suomi College who was born
in Finland but raised mostly in this area.</p>
<p>Actually, it is remarkable that Finns have been able to
remain ethnically distinct at all in the U.S., given the
extent of immigration. While Germans, Italians and Poles
flocked to America by the millions around the turn of the
century, historians say only 380,000 Finns made the trip and
that about 75,000 went back to Finland. Census results aren't
available yet for 1990, but a decade ago some 616,000
Americans claimed Finnish ancestry. Michigan led the states,
with about 112,000.</p>
<p>Despite their small numbers, Finns in these parts don't
like to be minimized or ignored. People get all riled up, for
example, by a sign promoting an "authentic Swedish sauna,"
there being no such thing.</p>
<p>The sauna is distinctly Finnish; it was often the first
structure built on an immigrant's farm. And it is always
pronounced "SOW-nuh," the first syllable rhyming with cow.
"If anyone asks about a `sawna,'" says Frederick B. Waisanen,
a retired Michigan State University sociologist, "you know
that he isn't a Finn and he isn't from around here."</p>
<p>Not all Michigan Finns are serious sauna devotees, but Mr.
Waisanen is. His summer home on Lake Superior has a
traditional wood-fired sauna right next to the beach. After
sweating in the hot room, he and his guests can race down to
the icy water and plunge in. This sweat-and-swim cycle is
repeated two or three times, with breaks for drinking beer
and eating sausages warmed over the hot rocks of the sauna.
At Christmas time, a shop in Hancock sells a sausage, sauna
makkara, expressly intended for the purpose.</p>
<p>Those who don't have saunas at home can go to Jukuri's
Sauna in Laurium, Mich. -- one of three public saunas in the
Upper Peninsula. It has 12 individual units that an
individual, family or group of friends can occupy for up to
45 minutes at a time, at $3 per adult, or two for $5. It can
be a family ritual, particularly when children are young.</p>
<p>Saunas have flourished longer than another immigrant
legacy: social radicalism. Finnish immigration started in the
late 1860s, when mining companies in Michigan and Minnesota
sent recruiters to scout for cheap labor. The mines' bitter
conditions made socialists of many Finnish immigrants and, in
the wake of the Russian Revolution, some turned to communism.
Religious and conservative individuals resisted the trend,
and the result was an immigrant community sharply divided
between "Church Finns" and "Red Finns."</p>
<p>The tiny town of Eben Junction, had two immigrant-founded
co-op stores. (When the Communists failed in their attempt to
take over the church-related coop in 1932, they marched
across the street and started their own.) Old-timers in Eben
Junction still recall the day when Red Finns raised the
Russian flag above their store, and the church-goers called
the sheriff. He tore down the hammer-and-sickle and threw the
Reds in jail.</p>
<p>The radical tradition hasn't disappeared altogether. It
lives on in Gus Hall, the longtime chairman of the American
Communist Party and a Finnish-American whose name originally
was Gus Arvo Hallberg. And one of the nation's few extant
Finnish-language newspapers, Tyomies-Eteenpain (Working
Man-Progressive) of Superior, Wis., retains a distinctly
left-wing tone.</p>
<p>All this Finnish-Americanism doesn't enchant everybody who
lives in the midst of it. Some are a bit tired of it all. And
residents without Finnish ancestors can be downright hostile.</p>
<p>Take Vicky Koskinen, the wife of Timo, the Suomi English
teacher. Mrs. Koskinen has no Finnish ancestors and she says
she has been snubbed, particularly by elderly people at the
Finnish cultural events she goes to with her husband.
"Sometimes I'm a little jealous," Mrs. Koskinen confesses.
"But mostly I just get disgusted with the professional
Finns."</p>
<p>There will be fewer of those as time goes by. Consider the
changes at Suomi College, which was founded in 1896 to help
Finns assimilate but now is trying to preserve Finnish
culture. "We used to teach our English-language classes in
Finnish," says Ralph J. Jalkanen, who is retiring as Suomi's
president Aug. 1, after 30 years. "Now we teach our
Finnish-language classes in English."</p>
