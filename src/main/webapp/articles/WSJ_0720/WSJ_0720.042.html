	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Air Inter, France's main domestic airline, said
it canceled 25% of its flights today and tomorrow, because of
a scheduled 48-hour strike by pilots and navigators who are
seeking more pay.
   The airline said its small number of flights outside
France and its service to Corsica wouldn't be affected. No
French city served by the airline will be completely cut off,
Air Inter said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The airline's ground personnel also plan to strike today
and tomorrow, but Air Inter didn't cancel any flights until
the pilots union announced Wednesday that it would join the
work stoppage.</p>
