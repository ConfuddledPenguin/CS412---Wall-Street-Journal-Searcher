	<p class="article-leader">CHINA PLEDGED to maintain its aid for Cambodia's Khmer
Rouge guerrillas.
   Criticizing a U.S. decision to hold talks with Vietnam on
Cambodia's civil war, and to no longer support awarding
Cambodia's U.N. seat to a three-party coalition that includes
the Khmer Rouge, Chinese officials said they will "support
the Cambodian people in their resistance" as long as Vietnam
doesn't withdraw all troops from Cambodia. Prince Sihanouk,
who heads one of the two non-Communist factions in the
coalition, called the U.S. policy reversal "an act of grave
injustice" and said it would make his group "more firm and
fierce" in fighting against the Cambodian government.</p>

shift, describing it as "paving the way for achievement of an
early political settlement."</p>

<p>South Korea's president called for an end to "Cold War

brethren from the North without restrictions."</p>

<p>Pete Rose was sentenced to five months in prison for two
felony charges of filing false tax returns. A federal judge
also ordered the former Cincinnati Reds manager to spend

baseball's record for the most hits.</p>

<p>The House Ethics Committee voted unanimously to recommend
a reprimand of Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat,
for his relationship with a male prostitute, according to a
person familiar with the deliberations. A reprimand would be
a more severe sanction of Frank than Democrats on the
12-member panel had advocated.</p>

<p>The chairman of a House panel said he thought there were
enough votes in the House to pass the civil-rights bill
cleared by the Senate Wednesday. But House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Brooks and other Democrats hinted the bill

because he says it invites hiring quotas.</p>

<p>The House approved a $170.7 billion measure funding the

million to appease "drug czar" Bennett. The bill, approved
359-58, also includes large increases for medical research
and aid to public schools.</p>

<p>The Soviet government is revising its economic
restructuring program and has temporarily shelved plans to

a government meeting.</p>

<p>Philippine officials said the death toll from Monday's

that collapsed in the resort town of Baguio.</p>

telescope.</p>

<p>Police and firefighters demonstrated in East Berlin for
higher wages to cover price increases since the July 1

billion in loans to farming and construction firms.</p>
