	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Lancer Industries Inc. said it received $135
million in new credit, mostly from banks, to refinance a
bridge loan made in its acquisition of Fairfield
Manufacturing Co.
   The new financing consists of $105 million from a group of
banks led by Bank of America, and $30 million in subordinated
debt issued to institutional investors, Lancer said. The
bridge loan is with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lancer, formerly known as McLean Industries Inc., said it
also completed a $25 million financing with Westinghouse
Credit Corp. by issuing subordinated notes.</p>
<p>Lancer Chairman Paul S. Levy said the new financing lowers
the company's debt service levels and provides "long-term
financing for future operations and our acquisition program."
The company's businesses include specialty packaging and
textile printing.</p>
