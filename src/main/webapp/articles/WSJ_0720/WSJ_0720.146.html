	<p class="article-leader">Bamberger Polymers Inc. said it secured a temporary
restraining order against 11 former sales and marketing
employees, who, it said, are starting a competing plastics
business.
   The New Hyde Park, N.Y., plastics merchant has said loss
of the employees would have a "material adverse effect" on
its sales and earnings from the Northeast and West Coast
operations in the third quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The order enjoins the former employees from soliciting
Bamberger employees, contacting its customers, or using
confidential information obtained from Bamberger.</p>
<p>Walter Craig, legal counsel for Helm Resources Inc., a
holding company that controls about half of Bamberger, said
the defecting workers are "engaged in basically the same
business they were involved in, the trading and sale of
thermoplastic resins."</p>
<p>The company also is seeking damages against the former
employees. A request for a preliminary injunction will be
considered Tuesday.</p>
<p>None of the defendants could be reached for comment.</p>
