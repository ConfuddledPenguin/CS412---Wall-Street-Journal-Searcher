	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A show of strength by the mark against the yen
and the pound led the dollar lower against the West German
currency.
   By the end of New York trading yesterday, the U.S.
currency was slightly higher against the yen and slightly
lower against sterling.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A feature of the trading day was a retreat by the
Australian dollar, a move that traders said the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York sought to exaggerate by selling the
Australian currency.</p>
<p>Foreign-exchange traders tried to make what profits they
could from yesterday's small and often random price
movements. "This is a troublesome and difficult market to
trade in," said Robert White, manager of corporate
foreign-exchange trading for First Interstate Bank of
California in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>"The market just doesn't have the power to break out of
its ranges, and for the next couple of days, with no U.S.
indicators due out, I think we're just going to continue this
messy trading," said Dan Brooks, chief New York dealer for
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.</p>
<p>Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6410 marks, down from 1.6480 marks late Wednesday. The U.S.
currency was also changing hands at 148.10 yen, up from
147.75 yen a day earlier.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Friday, the dollar was trading at 148.15 yen soon
after the opening; it closed at 147.60 yen in Tokyo Thursday.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6395
marks, down from Tokyo's Thursday close of 1.6445 marks.</p>
<p>Sterling climbed to $1.8157 in late New York trading from
$1.8155 late Wednesday but slid to 2.9796 marks from 2.9919
marks.</p>
<p>The mark closed at 90.25 yen, up from 89.67 yen. Dealers
attributed the mark's rise to profit-taking on long, or
overbought, yen and sterling positions.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar was last quoted in New York at
$0.7820, down from $0.7905 Wednesday.</p>
<p>After a low-volume session of Australian dollar trading in
Sydney and Melbourne Thursday, European and North American
traders opened their offices aware that the market was long
on the Australian currency, said Rick Porter, New York
manager of corporate foreign-exchange for Westpac Banking.</p>
<p>After an early rise, the currency hit resistance at about
$0.7880 to $0.7900, Mr. Porter said. Then, "it turned upon
itself and fell a half cent in 15 to 20 minutes."</p>
<p>Many market investors and dealers took advantage of the
listless session to ponder the previous day's Senate
testimony by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan.</p>
<p>Before pushing the dollar out of its current range of
about 147.50 yen to 148.10 yen, the market is "going to wait
to digest what Mr. Greenspan said," commented Mr. Brooks of
Dai-Ichi Kangyo.</p>
<p>While it seems, Mr. White said, that the Fed chairman "is
very stubborn about lowering rates," market confidence
remains low. Mr. Brooks said, "People still think U.S. rates
will go down and that the dollar will go down with them."</p>
<p>Sterling got a slight boost, Mr. White said, when British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons
she would prefer a strong pound whether it is outside or
inside the price bands of the European Monetary System.</p>
<p>The prime minister's cheerleading "obviously didn't hurt"
the pound, said Donald Hubbard, a New York treasury officer
for Midland Bank. But, he added, "she's always wanted a
strong pound."</p>
<p>Britain's high interest rates, along with speculation that
it may soon be a full EMS participant, will discourage much
sterling-selling. "I don't think anyone can go short sterling
and make money," said Mahiko Nagai, an interbank trader at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The dollar ended European dealings narrowly mixed,
although its modest advance against some currencies was
largely the result of cross-rate action surrounding the mark.</p>
<p>The dollar ended sterling-centered Japanese dealings
higher. The U.S. unit was last quoted Thursday in Tokyo at
147.60 yen, above 147.25 yen Wednesday.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $361.40 an ounce, down 20 cents.
Estimated volume was a light 2.4 million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$361.42 an ounce.</p>
