	<h3>Fraud Is Called Small Factor in S&L Cost --- Consultant's Study Cites Real Estate Values, High Rates</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- You wouldn't know it from listening to
Congress and the Bush administration these days, but only a
small part of the billions of dollars in savings-and-loan
losses went to fraud, an industry consultant says.
   The "S&L crooks" being pilloried on Capitol Hill actually
are responsible for $5 billion, or roughly 3%, of the losses
now being absorbed by taxpayers, according to
savings-and-loan consultant Bert Ely of Ely & Co.,
Alexandria, Va. Most of the losses come from falling real
estate values and from excessive interest rates paid by sick
thrifts to attract depositors, he calculates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Ely estimates the federal government's total losses on
S&Ls at $147 billion, excluding interest based on current
borrowing. The administration's latest forecast puts the
losses at between $90 billion and $130 billion, not including
interest. Economists project that the final bill over 40
years, including interest, could exceed $500 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Ely, a frequently quoted analyst and consultant, was
among the first to estimate how high the thrift losses would
actually pile up. His study, he says, is a rough answer to
the question: Where did the S&L money go? It is a question
that was being asked with increased urgency in recent weeks
as it became clear that the S&L cleanup was having a
devastating effect on the federal budget.</p>
<p>Using admittedly imprecise estimates based on reports that
the S&Ls themselves submit to government regulators, as well
as other macroeconomic data, the study nonetheless carves the
S&L puzzle into pieces that can be compared by size. "I don't
think anyone has tried to put all the numbers together in a
meaningful way," Mr. Ely says.</p>
<p>Some loss categories are relatively easy to ascertain, Mr.
Ely says. For example, the thrift industry's junk-bond
holdings amount to about $3 billion in losses. The study
assumes a 20% loss on $15 billion, the most that S&Ls
invested in the high-risk, high-yield instruments at any one
time. That represents losses on both the market value of the
bonds and the bond issuers' defaults.</p>
<p>"To listen to some people on Capitol Hill, you would think
junk bonds caused the end of Western civilization," Mr. Ely
says. "That's just not true."</p>
<p>He estimates that because pre-1983 losses weren't
addressed at the time, an additional $43 billion in interest
costs piled up. The next biggest chunk of losses, $28
billion, stems from real estate, including falling property
values, poor judgment in evaluating loans and the physical
deterioration of repossessed real estate.</p>
<p>A further $25 billion stems from S&L losses prior to 1983.
Millions of homebuyers acquired fixed-rate mortgages while
overall interest rates rose during the 1980s. They benefit
every month, while the thrifts lose money.</p>
<p>About $14 billion went straight into the pockets of
depositors at insolvent institutions. To attract deposits,
those ailing thrifts, with roughly $350 billion in deposits,
paid interest rates one-half to three-quarters of a
percentage point higher than healthy competitors paid --
knowing that even if they failed, the government would pick
up the tab. That cash also benefited deposit brokers, who
routinely moved around $100,000 blocks of government-insured
money to chase the highest rates.</p>
<p>The Resolution Trust Corp. said yesterday that it expects
to bring major fraud actions at 40% of the roughly 450 failed
savings and loan associations. But even so, industry and
government sources say the government will recoup far less
than $1 billion. Nonetheless, assailing S&L fraud has been a
recurring theme in Congress, and it prompted President Bush
last month to hold a virtual pep rally with several hundred
federal prosecutors to encourage them to catch S&L looters.
Neil Bush, the president's son, is facing administrative
charges over alleged conflicts of interest at an insolvent
S&L where he was a director.</p>
<p>Economists say that government officials attribute the S&L
mess to fraud because it's easier to do so than to explain
why they delayed the cleanup and added to the costs. "If
there was so much fraud," asks James Barth, an Auburn
University economist formerly with the thrift regulatory
agency, "why are we just hearing about it today? If it was
there for all those years, who is committing the fraud, the
government or the people at the institutions?"</p>
