	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The administration's bill to shift power to
the Securities and Exchange Commission from commodities
regulators is in severe trouble, and key backers in the
Senate are scrambling to find a compromise.
   When the bill comes before the Senate, probably later this
year, it may not include a provision to shift oversight of
stock-index futures to the SEC from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. That's partly because heavy lobbying by
the futures industry and what critics consider a weak push by
the administration has failed to convince most senators of
the provision's usefulness. Moreover, some senators believe
the current regulatory structure is better for the futures
markets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Administration officials, led by Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady and SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, contend that
the split regulatory clout of the SEC and CFTC encourages
stock-market volatility and hurts enforcement efforts. The
SEC oversees stocks and options, and the CFTC regulates
stock-index futures.</p>
<p>Those futures, which are primarily used by large
institutional investors for hedging purposes, allow investors
to bet on the movement of a basket of stocks without owning
the shares. They are frequently used in computerized program
trading strategies.</p>
<p>Sen. John Heinz (R., Pa.), a staunch supporter of the
administration's bill, said he is seeking a "compromise that
will solve the major issues."</p>
<p>Another backer, Sen. Timothy Wirth (D., Colo.), said he
was "disappointed" by the administration's efforts on behalf
of the bill. "I don't see any great momentum here," he said.
"The case hasn't been very well made by the administration."</p>
<p>Some Senate aides fear that negotiations over a compromise
are hurting the bill's chances because they indicate a lack
of support for the administration's proposal. Several aides
even noted that draft proposals without an index-futures
shift are in the works.</p>
<p>A Treasury official denied that the administration's
efforts have been weak and said Mr. Brady strongly supports
all parts of the bill.</p>
<p>"Some people have been offering compromises from the
beginning," the official said. "We think the administration's
proposal is what needs to be done." He added: "There's
obviously very strong opposition on the other side. It's a
jurisdiction issue: Those are the toughest issues on the
Hill."</p>
<p>Vote counts show that the bill would have a tough time
passing if the Senate voted today. But a huge number of
senators haven't made a decision about the administration's
proposal. A compromise clearly would give them two benefits.
First, it would relieve the senators of having to learn the
nuances of complex markets, and second, it would allow them
to tell constituents that they voted against volatility.</p>
<p>The draft bills specifically focus on one of the
administration bill's key proposalsgranting oversight of
futures margins to a federal agency. Currently, margins --
the good-faith money needed to trade futures -- are set by
the exchanges and can't be changed by the CFTC or any
regulator except in emergencies. Messrs. Breeden and Brady
contend that low margins in the futures markets helped
exacerbate the market drops of October 1987 and October 1989.
They contend that unless federal oversight of margins is
ordered by Congress, the futures exchanges will once again
bring them down to what Mr. Breeden calls "dangerously low
levels."</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden appears to be focusing almost exclusively on
the margin question. In testimony yesterday before the Senate
Banking Committee, Mr. Breeden repeatedly decried "excess
leverage" in the futures markets that he said threatened the
stock investments of 50 million Americans.</p>
<p>Senate staffers said the compromise measure also will
focus on a clause in the Commodity Exchange Act that requires
any new product with elements of futures contracts to be
traded on a futures exchange and regulated by the CFTC.</p>
<p>Sen. Wirth also criticized the White House's renomination
of Wendy Gramm as CFTC chairman. "The single most important
statement they are making is reappointing the person" who
most staunchly opposes a shift of jurisdiction, he said.</p>
<p>In his testimony yesterday, Mr. Breeden expressed caution
about the proposed stock transfer excise tax, which would put
a 0.15% surcharge on the sale of investments. Although it
hasn't been brought up at the summit table, the proposal is
one of several being discussed by the administration and
Capitol Hill leaders currently negotiating budget accords.</p>
<p>Mr. Breeden refused to criticize the excise tax
explicitly, but he told senators, "We have to be
extraordinarily careful in creating taxes on capital
formation." Saying that U.S. securities taxes are higher than
those in many other countries, Mr. Breeden said he is
concerned about taking "steps to drive trading offshore."</p>
