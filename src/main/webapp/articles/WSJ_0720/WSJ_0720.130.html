	<p class="article-leader">Martin Marietta Corp., Bethesda, Md., received a $138
million contract from the U.S. Postal Service to make 614
automated mail-sorting machines, the company's second such
job, as part of the agency's multiphase initiative to
automate sorting fully by 1995 at a cost of $2.5 billion.
   The company said the accord signals its efforts to find
civilian applications for its defense and aerospace
technologies to hedge against defense spending cuts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Martin Marietta's contract is for a new, high-speed
sorting machine that uses barcode technology to process
first-class and third-class mail by ZIP code. The Postal
Service uses bar-code machines to process 51% of its mail;
the remainder is handled manually or with mechanized sorters.
Martin Marietta's Information Systems Group will deliver the
machines by October 1992, with the first delivery expected in
late summer of 1991. It has options to build an unspecified
number of additional machines; they were developed under a
joint licensing pact between Martin Marietta and closely held
National Presort Inc., a Dallas-based technology concern.</p>
