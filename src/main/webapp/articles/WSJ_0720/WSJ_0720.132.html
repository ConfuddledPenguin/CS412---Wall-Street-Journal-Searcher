	<p class="article-leader">Accor S.A., a French hospitality company, said in a filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Motel 6 L.P.
has projected its net income for the 1990 fiscal year ending
Dec. 31 will be $19.6 million on revenue of $477.4 million.
   The projection was made in connection with a tender offer
made last week by Accor S.A. to acquire Motel 6 of Dallas for
$22.50 a unit, or nearly $1.3 billion. Accor said the figure
was used in merger talks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a related filing, Motel 6 said that three class-action
suits have been filed to block the acquisition. Motel 6
executives weren't available for comment.</p>
<p>Although the merger isn't conditioned on financing, Accor
said it estimates it will need $1.3 billion to cover costs of
the deal, including buying the shares and paying fees and
expenses. Accor said it would borrow the money from Banque
Indosuez and Societe Generale under a special credit
arrangement and from its existing working capital and credit
lines.</p>
<p>The French company also said it will explore ways to
refinance Motel 6's existing debt after the deal is
completed.</p>
<p>Accor also said it has agreed to pay Morgan Stanley & Co.
a fee of $1 million for acting as a dealer-manager in the
offer. Motel 6, in its filing, said it has agreed to pay
Salomon Brothers Inc. $5.5 million for acting as its
financial adviser.</p>
