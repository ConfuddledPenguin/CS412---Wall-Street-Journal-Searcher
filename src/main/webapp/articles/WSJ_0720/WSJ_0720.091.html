	<h3>Corporate Focus: Federal Express Faces Problems Overseas --- Decline in Trans-Pacific Shipping Adds to its Woes</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Last week, Federal Express Corp. broke a string of five
consecutive quarters of year-to-year profit declines.
   But while news of its fourth-quarter results boosted the
express-delivery giant's sagging stock price for a day,
Federal still faces serious problems in its overseas
operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite the earnings gain, Federal reported a 7% drop in
operating income for its fourth quarter, ended May 31,
compared with a year earlier. That slide, analysts say, means
that the company is still losing as much as $3 million a week
from its operations abroad. Federal's own executives concede
that a turnaround is nowhere in sight.</p>
<p>"We've got a lot of work to do," says Thomas Oliver, the
company's senior vice president of international operations.</p>
<p>Since entering the European market in 1986, Federal's
executives have warned that the company's international
expansion was a "long-term investment." But now, with
trans-Pacific shipping falling off, air-freight competition
intensifying and volume growth in its U.S. market slowing,
some of Federal's own customers are wondering if the company
knows what it's doing.</p>
<p>"You do have the feeling that there's a lack of
knowledge," says Manfred Engst, executive vice president of
Schenkers International Forwarders Inc., a Frankfurt-based
freight broker, whose U.S. offices give Federal some $10
million a year of business. "Federal Express says, `If you
want to use us, you use our system.' They don't go a step
further to meet larger customers' needs."</p>
<p>Many of Federal's problems seem to stem from an identity
crisis. In purchasing Tiger International Inc. for $880
million last year, Federal acquired 6,000 employees, 41
airplanes and airport facilities on five continents, all
geared toward what is known in the air-freight industry as
the wholesale business -- the movement of heavy cargo from
airport to airport.</p>
<p>Federal itself, however, has always been a retailer -- a
specialist in overnight, door-to-door delivery of small
packages. The differences in operating demands between the
"back-door" and "front-door" businesses -- that is, between
wholesale and retail -- have proven difficult for Federal to
reconcile.</p>
<p>Harsh words have been exchanged between former Tiger
managers and their new bosses; several senior Tiger
executives, including the concern's top officer in Japan and
its chief liaison to U.S. freight forwarders, have quit. And
some of the acquired airline's biggest customers have fled to
other carriers.</p>
<p>In all, says Edwin C. Laird, director of Air Cargo
Management Group, a Seattle-based consulting firm, Federal
has lost more than $200 million a year of the revenue that
Tiger had been earning. "They don't understand the
heavyweight business," he says.</p>
<p>Two years ago, $40 million of that Tiger business came
from one customer, Columbus, Ohio-based retailer Limited
Inc., the world's largest air-freight shipper over the
Pacific, says Mr. Laird. But shortly after acquiring Tiger,
which had a large hub in Columbus, Federal lost most of
Limited's business to competitors because Federal insisted on
altering the route used to fly Limited's Asia-made clothes to
Columbus, says James Murray, former director of Tiger's
Columbus hub.</p>
<p>Despite pleas from Limited's executives, Federal
consolidated Tiger's Midwest operations in Indianapolis.
After several weeks of less timely or unpredictable service,
Limited took most of its business -- projected at more than
$60 million last year -- elsewhere, Mr. Murray says.</p>
<p>"The Limited saw something they had spent so many years
building up fall apart in a night," says Mr. Murray. A
Limited spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Oliver, Federal's senior vice president, says Federal
let some of its Limited business go because rates were too
low. In retrospect, he says, given the downturn in
trans-Pacific shipping this year, "We should have been more
aggressive in trying to keep it."</p>
<p>Federal's identity problems have also hurt its
relationships with freight forwarders, the middlemen who book
door-to-door transportation for their clients' goods. Such
freight brokers had been Tiger's main customers, but many,
especially in Europe where Tiger isn't as entrenched as in
Asia, have refused to deal with Federal because they see it
as a possible door-to-door competitor. Though Federal has
promised forwarders it won't offer door-to-door delivery for
goods weighing more than 150 pounds, suspicion lingers.</p>
<p>"It's just human nature to feel leery of supporting a
competitor," says Jack Cella, executive vice president of
Airborne Freight Corp., a freight forwarder and a Federal
Express rival in the U.S. express-delivery market. Mr. Cella
says Airborne has awarded roughly $8 million a year, or 30%,
of its former Tiger business to other carriers.</p>
<p>"What's to stop Federal from saying, `Hey, I'm not going
to be a nice guy any more'?" Mr. Cella asks.</p>
<p>That may have already happened. Mr. Engst of Schenkers
International says he has heard from several of his salesmen
in the field that Federal has been calling on Schenkers
customers. And Jerry Sannebeck, station manager for Circle
Air Freight, a San Francisco-based forwarder, says Circle's
salesmen have found themselves selling directly against
Federal in the past few months.</p>
<p>"At the branch level, we can't see ourselves even
associated with Federal in a couple of years," says Mr.
Sannebeck, who currently uses Federal on a number of routes
to Asia. "All things being equal, I'd use another carrier."</p>
<p>Federal's Mr. Oliver says the company's relationship with
forwarders is "steadily improving." He says Federal's main
problem with its heavy-cargo operations is a slowdown of
U.S.-bound shipments from Asia caused by the softening U.S.
economy. "Unfortunately, we got ourselves into a situation
where capacity went up a bit when the market was going down,"
says Mr. Oliver.</p>
<p>Federal's costly foray overseas would probably raise fewer
concerns if the company's domestic business hadn't slowed so
significantly. Since April, Federal's average daily volume of
express packages has been rising about 11% from a year
earlier. For some time before then, average daily volume was
generally up 16% to 20%.</p>
<p>"They've got their cost problems under control" since the
Tiger purchase, says Kevin Murphy, transportation analyst
with Morgan Stanley. "But now they've got a revenue problem."</p>
<p>Mr. Laird of Air Cargo Management says the U.S. market's
sluggishness must be particularly worrisome to Federal, given
the threat it faces from giant United Parcel Service Inc.
It's only a matter of time, says Mr. Laird, until UPS goes
after Federal's bread and butter: its premium overnight
service with pickup and delivery on demand.</p>
<p>"When UPS becomes more user-friendly, it could eat very
seriously into Federal," Mr. Laird says.</p>
<p>But Mr. Smith, Federal's chairman and chief executive,
professes not to worry. He declined to be interviewed for
this story, but he told a trade journal recently:</p>
<p>"If you dissect the numbers and see how Federal Express is
doing with its traditional U.S. franchise -- market share is
going up, margins are improving, service levels are getting
better, (even) with the aberration of the international
stuff. So people are saying, in the last analysis, if
everything else fails they could just stop doing the
international, and (Federal Express) is still a damn good
thing."</p>
