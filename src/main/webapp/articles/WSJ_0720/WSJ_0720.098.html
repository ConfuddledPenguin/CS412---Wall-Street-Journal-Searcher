	<p class="article-leader">HILTON HOTELS Corp. said it filed a registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed
offering of notes, due in 2005, with a principal amount of
$650 million. The Beverly Hills, Calif., owner and operator
of hotels and casinos said the notes are zero coupon, so the
offering is expected to result in proceeds to Hilton of only
$270 million. The notes will have a principal amount when
they mature of $650 million, representing a 6% yield to
maturity. The notes also are subordinated and convertible
into Hilton common. Hilton said it will use the proceeds for
general cororate purposes, possibly including repayment of
debt.</p>
