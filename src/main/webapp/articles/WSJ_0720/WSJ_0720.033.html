	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Securities and Exchange Commissioner Philip R.
Lochner Jr. has launched an inquiry into ways to reduce the
complexity and cost of accounting rules for U.S. companies.
   While, at this point, the SEC hasn't begun an official
proceeding into accounting rules, Mr. Lochner said his
exploration has the backing of SEC Chairman Richard Breeden.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We've got a set of accounting rules that are so
complicated and so costly . . . there may be a significant
detriment to U.S. business," Mr. Lochner said in an
interview. "You end up with an accounting statement which
ordinary investors don't use." He said he is concerned that
companies are churning out more and more information that
isn't particularly understandable.</p>
<p>Commissioner Lochner already has raised the issues with
members of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the
rule-making body for the accounting profession. Mr. Lochner
emphasized that his purpose in launching the inquiry is to
"urge the FASB to focus on cost-benefit analysis" in creating
new rules and amending others.</p>
<p>Of particular interest to the commissioner are issues
relating to accounting for income tax, post-retirement
employment benefits, pensions and leases. The FASB is
currently considering rule changes on several of these
issues.</p>
<p>Accounting rules, which often address very complex issues,
are of great concern to companies, because in some cases
their adoption can result in huge costs. For example, a
pending rule on accounting for retirement benefits other than
pensions will require companies for the first time to reflect
on their books the present and future costs of benefits, such
as medical and insurance coverage, that employees will
receive after they retire. The total cost has been estimated
at $400 billion.</p>
<p>Although the FASB "by and large has done a good job," Mr.
Lochner said he undertook his effort to make the SEC's
feelings known. He emphasized that he would accomplish this
through continued discussions with the FASB, particularly on
costbenefit analysis and coordination of U.S. and foreign
accounting rules. Mr. Lochner is scheduled to attend a
meeting of the Financial Accounting Standards Advisory
Council next Tuesday to discuss the impact of accounting
standards on U.S. competitiveness abroad.</p>
<p>Last month, Mr. Lochner wrote to members of the
accounting-principles task force of the Business Roundtable,
a group of chief executives, to solicit suggestions on how
current U.S. accounting rules relate to "the competitiveness
of U.S. businesses in the international marketplace."</p>
<p>Mr. Lochner also has spoken privately to chief financial
officers and at least one accounting firm.</p>
<p>He said that he hopes an outgrowth of the discussion would
result in a greater attempt to coordinate U.S. and foreign
accounting principles, which are generally perceived as less
costly to business.</p>
<p>The accounting inquiry by the commissioner is part of a
broader focus by SEC Chairman Breeden that is concerned with
the competitiveness of U.S. business and the U.S. capital
markets.</p>
<p>Mr. Lochner emphasized that he doesn't want to see the SEC
taking over the function of drafting accounting standards,
although he said, "theoretically, the SEC could get into the
business of setting standards itself rather than endorsing
the FASB. I don't think that would be a healthy development."
The FASB is a privately financed organization that is
recognized by the SEC as being the official standard setter
for accounting. On rare occasion, the SEC has declined to
endorse an FASB recommendation.</p>
<p>The FASB in recent months has come under increasing
pressure from business groups. In May, the FASB's oversight
body made it more difficult for the FASB to issue
accounting-rule pronouncements by boosting as of Jan. 1,
1991, the voting approval requirement for the seven-member
FASB to 5-to-2. Currently, only a simple majority is
required.</p>
<p>Dennis R. Beresford, chairman of the FASB, said he has
been discussing accounting issues with Mr. Lochner. Although
Mr. Beresford said the FASB wants to support the
competitiveness of U.S. business, "we don't believe financial
reporting should favor or disfavor any particular business."</p>
<p>Mr. Beresford, who opposed the tighter voting approval
requirements for FASB, said the board was concerned that
"taken to some extreme the argument might be made that we
have to loosen accounting standards in the U.S. to make
companies more competitive." But he added that accounting
standards "to be most useful must be cost effective," and
said the board would be open to considering whether the cost
of rules exceeds the benefit.</p>
