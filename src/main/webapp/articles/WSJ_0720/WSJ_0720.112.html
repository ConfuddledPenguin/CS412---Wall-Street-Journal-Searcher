	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Is this any way to treat a stock in a bull
market?
   In two blistering days of selling this week, United
Telecommunications lost nearly 30% of its value after a
disappointing second-quarter earnings report.
Building-materials chain Lowe's Cos. tumbled nearly 20% in
the same period when Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Bruce Missett
downgraded the stock. Lotus Development fell 26% in two days
after telling analysts this week that their third-quarter
profit estimates were too high.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is flirting with 3000
after racking up a string of record highs this year. Yet even
as the average is climbing the stairway to heaven, some
individual stocks are sliding into the abyss.</p>
<p>"It is shades of 1974, shades of 1987 -- and it is the
strangest thing I've ever seen," said Dudley Eppel, head of
equity trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "The selling
is so indiscriminate; there is such a panic."</p>
<p>It isn't surprising to see a stock sell-off after a bad
earnings report. What is amazing to Mr. Eppel and several
other big traders on Wall Street is that the selling doesn't
stop.</p>
<p>"In this market, when they kill a stock it's not over;
they beat it into a thousand deaths," said John B. Burke, an
independent trader on the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange. For a bull market, that kind of selling is very
uncharacteristic.</p>
<p>On various trading desks yesterday, dealers described the
activity in U.S. Shoe, Tandem Computers, HomeFed and Lotus
Development, to name a few, as "merciless"; "aggressive"; and
"amazing."</p>
<p>The selling storm in certain stocks tells traders that
even though benchmarks are touching the clouds, many
investors think stock prices have to come back to earth.
Buyers aren't satisfied with the market's first attempt at
valuing a stock after bad news.</p>
<p>No longer do they suddenly term the shares a bargain after
a one-day steep decline. Instead, investors let the
punishment continue a day or two or more before they decide
the stock has hit bottom.</p>
<p>Said one senior trader at Shearson Lehman Brothers: "In my
first years in this job, when a stock opened down four
dollars we said we should buy it for a turnaround. Now, there
are two or three waves of selling. There's just no holding
back."</p>
<p>This is the ugly side of the earnings-driven market of
1990. Casting aside concern about U.S. economic growth,
spurred by a mania that sometimes pays little heed to what
industry group a stock may be in, investors are pursuing
growth stocks with earnings that are up at least 15% on
annualized basis from the previous year.</p>
<p>Five-year earnings growth in Tandem Computers is 21% --
impressive by anyone's measure. Prior to yesterday, when
Tandem reported profit of 30 cents per share for its fiscal
third quarter compared with 31 cents the previous year, the
stock traded at about 19 times the latest 12 months'
earnings. But after its earnings slipped, Tandem suddenly
didn't fit someone's definition of a growth stock. Tandem
fell 1 7/8 yesterday to 19 5/8 on nearly five million shares.</p>
<p>Witness the classic lamentation of a growth-oriented
analyst: "I am sorely disappointed that they {Tandem} cannot
translate their very powerful product position into revenue
and earnings growth," said Terry Mogil, vice president at
Chancellor Capital Management.</p>
<p>These days, no company is given a break. Projections of a
quarter or two of slower growth, or earnings that are a penny
or two a share below expectations, are a death sentence.</p>
<p>Growth stock investors aren't tolerating even small
setbacks. Browning-Ferris Industries is up 13% this year.
Five-year annual earnings growth is a hefty 22%. Yesterday,
however, the company's third-quarter earnings of 54 cents a
share were "about three cents light," according to one
analyst. For that, Browning-Ferris was slammed with a loss of
1 7/8 to close at 43 5/8 in New York Stock Exchange trading
of 1.3 million shares.</p>
<p>"Institutions tend to walk away if earnings aren't in
line," said the analyst.</p>
<p>And that's what worries some traders. Big investors have
been stocking up on growth stocks. Punishing sell-offs are
partly a result of dozens of investors trying to get out the
door at the same time when a company trips on earnings
growth. Investors "are so information-oriented that as soon
as something happens that they don't expect, there's a
liquidation crisis," says Mr. Eppel.</p>
<p>Complains Henry Van der Eb, manager of the Mathers Fund,
which has a cash level of 88%: "Earnings momentum has
overtaken fundamental valuation."</p>
<p>If anything, several earnings reports have reminded
investors that growth-stock investing is a game of hope. Part
of the romance of investing in growth stocks that trade at
high multiples of earnings is the belief that some companies
are immune to economic cycles and can expand earnings faster
than the average company no matter what. But a broad slowdown
in business affects all companies, including most growth
companies.</p>
<p>Even though she owns highflying growth stocks such as
Waste Management, Ellen Harris, chief domestic investment
officer for PaineWebber Mutual Funds, says she is keeping
cash at 20% right now in a mutual fund she manages.</p>
<p>"What made me cautious were increasing signs of an
economic slowdown that I thought would lead to a
disappointment in earnings," she says, adding: "In certain of
these high P-E growth stocks, people have taken their eye off
the ball. There is a degree of complacency."</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Van der Eb says, "There are about 50 stocks
that are in the pure hope stage -- Albertson's, Microsoft,
Limited, Home Depot, and Wal-Mart is the kingpin of them
all." Wal-Mart, with a P-E of about 33 currently, and other
growth stocks, may still deliver, however. On Tuesday,
Coca-Cola reported second-quarter earnings of 61 cents a
share, up from 49 cents the previous year. Since then, Coke's
shares have climbed an additional 5% as growth investors
moved into the stock; the P-E stands at about 27.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola's gains have helped move the Dow Jones
Industrial Average up to just seven points away from 3000 as
of yesterday's close. Most strategists think the average can
skip over that level easily in the next few days.</p>
<p>But the hammering of stocks that have had disappointing
earnings has caused a lot of second guessing in the market.
This week, and for the first time all year, some growth stock
managers have started to doubt that their stocks could fly to
P-Es of 50 or higher as they did in the early 1970s. In a
sign of caution that may grow, profit takers nicked 1/4 off
Wal-Mart yesterday; the stock closed at 33 1/2 on 3.3 million
shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
