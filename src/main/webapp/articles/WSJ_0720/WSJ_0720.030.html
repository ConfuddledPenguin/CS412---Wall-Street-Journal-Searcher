	<p class="article-leader">The recent proposal to amend the Orphan Drug Act, now
pending before the House of Representatives, raises new hopes
for thousands of Americans about health-care costs and
quality. One provision of the proposed amendment is that
drugs will lose their marketing exclusivity if they are no
longer rare (i.e. affect more than 200,000 people).
   The Orphan Drug Law as it has been applied over the past
seven years has clearly served the 20 million Americans who
suffer from rare diseases. In that time, 330 drugs have been
developed and 45 have been marketed under the Orphan Drug
designation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We question, however, the current use of the law to
maintain marketing exclusivity for drugs that are in
practical medical terms prescribed for far more than 200,000
people. Drugs used in treating HIV-positive individuals have
been given orphan-drug status even though it is very clear
now that within several years more than 200,000 people will
have AIDS.</p>
<p>If the proposal is passed, one preventive treatment that
will become more accessible is aerosol pentamidine.
Prophylactic use of aerosol pentamidine can prevent PCP
(Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia), a potentially lethal
opportunistic infection for people with AIDS. Currently, only
one version of the drug, manufactured by LyphoMed, is allowed
on the market, since it has orphan-drug status.</p>
<p>However, another company, Fisons, has developed a delivery
system that is quite different from the current FDA-approved
product. It is easy to use, more efficient and portable,
allowing patients to self-manage care at home. Home treatment
can greatly enhance a patient's sense of control over the
infection and quality of life. By reducing the need for
clinic administration, costs are reduced significantly;
furthermore, Fisons has pledged to sell the drug at half the
cost of the currently marketed product.</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, 945,000
individuals are infected with the HIV virus. Many of these
people would benefit from early prophylactic use of aerosol
pentamidine before an incidence of PCP occurs.</p>
<p>The AIDS epidemic deserves to be fought on all fronts --
political, medical, and research and development. The
proposed amendment to the Orphan Drug Act will help AIDS
patients get the treatment they so desperately need at a
price they can afford.</p>
