	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices closed widely mixed as a rally in
oil stocks and waves of futures-related buy programs offset
further selling inspired by disappointing earnings.
   The technology and retailing sectors were hit especially
hard as Tandem Computers and U.S. Shoe, respectively, joined
the list of stocks to be battered by earnings-related
sell-offs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which showed a loss
of more than 23 points at midday, bounced back to finish with
a gain of 12.13 at 2993.81. Five of the 30 component stocks
in the average are players in the oil industry; without the
gains in those issues, the industrial average would have been
little changed.</p>
<p>Broader indexes also managed to close on the plus side, as
Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index tacked on 1.10 to 365.32,
the Dow Jones Equity Market Index gained 0.86 to 339.05 and
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index added 0.55 to
199.38.</p>
<p>Declining stocks outpaced advancers by 858 to 621 on the
New York Stock Exchange, reflecting the broad-based selling
that hit the market through the first half of the session. A
midday flurry of sell programs tied to stock-index arbitrage
helped send prices to their lows.</p>
<p>"A lot of the volume started to dry up when we were at the
bottom," said Dale Tills, manager of institutional equities
trading at Charles Schwab & Co., San Francisco. "There
weren't a lot of people hitting the exits."</p>
<p>Once the arbitrage selling subsided, oil stocks began to
show strength and the market's rebound got under way. Among
the oil issues in the Dow industrials, Exxon advanced 1 1/2
to 50, Texaco gained 1 3/4 to 61 1/2 and Chevron added 1 1/2
to 76 3/4. Du Pont, the parent of Conoco, went up 1 to 40
3/4; USX, the owner of Marathon Oil, gained 3/4 to 34 3/8.</p>
<p>Market indexes then turned higher in the final hour amid
index-arbitrage buying, which involved the purchase of
baskets of stocks and the sale of index-futures contracts to
lock in profits from short-lived differences in price between
the two.</p>
<p>Traders said the buy programs focused on the Chicago Board
of Trade's Major Market Index futures, a target of program
trading earlier in the week as well. The MMI, when active,
has a major impact on the Dow industrials because it includes
17 of the average's 30 stocks.</p>
<p>July contracts on the MMI expire at the close of trading
today. As of Tuesday's close, there were still 9,606 of the
contracts outstanding; the so-called open interest in the
futures has been rising in recent weeks, rather than falling
in advance of the expiration, as is usually the case.</p>
<p>Against that backdrop, the late wave of arbitrage buying
represented "just the lead-in to the expiration," said
Christopher Pedersen, head of trading at Twenty-First
Securities. He added that some institutions "are lining up to
be sellers" of the MMI futures late today, based on the
assumption that index-arbitrage buying will allow them to
sell easily.</p>
<p>Tandem skidded 1 7/8 to 19 5/8 and ranked as the most
active Big Board issue; composite trading totaled more than
4.8 million shares. Although its net income for the June
quarter rose 5.5% from a year earlier, earnings per share
dropped slightly, rather than rising as analysts had
expected.</p>
<p>International Business Machines, boosted by the market's
late recovery, rose 1/8 to 120. But elsewhere in the
technology sector, Compaq Computer fell 7/8 to 63 1/2 on 1.4
million shares, Digital Equipment lost 5/8 to 82 7/8,
Motorola slid 1 1/8 to 84 3/4 and Hewlett-Packard eased 1/4
to 47 1/4.</p>
<p>U.S. Shoe plummeted 4 1/4 to 18 on two million shares --
nearly 10 times the stock's average daily volume. Citing
weaker sales at its LensCrafters subsidiary, the company said
second-quarter earnings may fall short of the year-earlier
level.</p>
<p>Wal-Mart Stores fell 1/4 to 33 1/2 on 3.3 million shares.
Among other retailing issues, Limited Inc. dropped 5/8 to 23
as 1.1 million shares changed hands, TJX eased 1/2 to 14 3/8
and Circuit City Stores skidded 1 7/8 to 26.</p>
<p>Environmental stocks, especially popular lately with
investors looking for growth areas, ran into selling despite
earnings reports that were in line with analysts'
projections. Waste Management eased 1/8 to 42 5/8 and
Browning-Ferris Industries dropped 1 7/8 to 43 5/8.</p>
<p>BankAmerica, whose second-quarter earnings fell 12% from
the year-ago level, lost 7/8 to 26 3/4 on 2.8 million shares.
HomeFed plunged 4 3/4 to 14 1/4 after posting a loss of
$108.2 million for the second quarter, reflecting a
surprisingly large provision for loan losses.</p>
<p>Another California-based financial institution, First
Interstate Bancorp, fell 2 7/8 to 37. The company disclosed
to analysts that the state's real-estate market is beginning
to show signs of weakness and that nonperforming assets at
its California operations "are likely to increase" if the
pattern continues. In the wake of that assessment, Wells
Fargo fell 1 7/8 to 76 7/8, and Security Pacific lost 1 1/8
to 34 3/4.</p>
<p>American Express, whose second-quarter earnings were on
the high end of expectations, added 1/4 to 31 1/4. The
company reported that net income rose 1.1%, with its Shearson
Lehman brokerage unit posting a $51 million profit for the
period.</p>
<p>But Primerica, whose net jumped 53% in the quarter,
declined 1 5/8 to 34 5/8. The U.S. attorney in Jacksonville,
Fla., is investigating life-insurance sales practices at the
company's ALW Marketing unit.</p>
<p>The oil-stock rally came amid news that the amount of oil
carried through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline is being cut by 25%
to 1.2 million barrels a day. The prospect of reduced supply
pushed August crude-oil futures up 44 cents a barrel, to
$18.99, in New York trading.</p>
<p>Mobil climbed 2 1/4 to 65 3/4 and Amoco added 1 5/8 to 54.
Schlumberger, which reported a 58% increase in second-quarter
operating earnings, added 1 1/8 to 64 1/4; among other
oil-services issues, Baker Hughes gained 1 to 29 1/2,
Halliburton went up 1 to 51 3/8 and and Parker Drilling rose
1/4 to 9 1/2.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.22
to 361.84. Volume totaled 12,110,000 shares.</p>
