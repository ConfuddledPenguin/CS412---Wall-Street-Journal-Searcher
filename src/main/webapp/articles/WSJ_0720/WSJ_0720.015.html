	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- First City Bancorp. of Texas said its earnings
fell 30% in the second quarter, marking the first such
decline since the bank was rescued in April 1988 by an
investment group led by A. Robert Abboud.
   The drop in net income, to $19.8 million, or 76 cents per
share, from $28.1 million, or $1.19 a share last year,
closely tracked a forecast by First City late last month.
That early warning took away most of the sting. First City
shares closed at $21.75 in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange yesterday, up 12.5 cents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts don't expect the bad news to be the last at First
City. Like most banks, the Houston bank is wrestling with
slow demand for credit and rising problem loans. First City's
nonperforming loans grew by $11 million, to $199 million, or
2.5% of its loan portfolio, the bank said. The rise reflects
continued problems in First City's $349 million in loans to
leveraged buy-outs. Such highly leveraged transactions are
the focus of national scrutiny by banking regulators.</p>
<p>The sale of First City's credit card business also
contributed to the earnings decline. Mr. Abboud said the bank
was unable to replace earnings on that high-yield business.
"However, during the quarter the trend was favorable," he
said. The net yield rose in May and June and averaged 3.82%
for the quarter as a whole, down from 4.15% the first
quarter. "The decline in net margin is the primary difference
in the earnings shortfall," said Frank Anderson, an analyst
with Stephens Inc., a Little Rock, Ark., investment banking
firm.</p>
<p>Mr. Abboud said that cost cutting is First City's first
priority. He attributed part of the earnings decline to a
consolidation of operations already underway.</p>
<p>Separately, Citibank said First City had sold its credit
card processing business to Citicorp Acceptance Services.
Under the terms, the Citicorp subsidiary will take over
processing of transactions made at First City's 14,000
merchant locations. First City will continue to sell Citicorp
processing services on a commission basis.</p>
