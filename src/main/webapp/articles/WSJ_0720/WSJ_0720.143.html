	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Bombardier Inc. said it and members of the
Bombardier family agreed to issue 7.5 million common shares
to the public for a total of about 146.3 million Canadian
dollars (US$126.3 million).
   The company said it will offer five million Class B
subordinated voting shares, and the Bombardier family will
sell 2.5 million Class B shares, all at C$19.50 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bombardier said proceeds of about C$93 million from the
company's sale of the five million newly issued shares will
be used to reduce debt and to increase working capital.</p>
<p>At last report, Bombardier had total debt of about C$222
million and C$504 million in shareholders' equity. Some
analysts said they had not expected the company to issue more
equity.</p>
<p>The transportation equipment manufacturer has made several
major acquisitions in recent months, including the $75
million purchase of Learjet Corp. from Integrated Resources
Inc. announced in April.</p>
<p>The Bombardier family's voting control of the company
doesn't appear likely to be affected by their sale of the
shares. At last report, the family held 78.7% of the Class A
shares, representing a voting stake of 67%.</p>
<p>A preliminary prospectus is expected to be filed with
regulators Monday. The share issue is subject to board and
regulatory approvals. Toronto-based securities dealer Scotia
McLeod Inc. will be the issue's lead underwriter.</p>
<p>In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday,
Bombardier's Class B shares closed at C$19.75, down 62.5
Canadian cents. Its Class A shares closed at C$19.875, down
50 Canadian cents.</p>
