	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Former Cincinnati Reds manager Pete Rose was
sentenced to five months in prison for two felony charges of
filing false tax returns.
   S. Arthur Spiegel, a federal district judge in Cincinnati,
also ordered Mr. Rose to spend three months in a halfway
house, perform 1,000 hours of community service, and pay a
$50,000 fine and $100 in court costs. Under federal
guidelines, Mr. Rose faced a recommended sentence of 8 to 14
months in prison.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Federal prosecutor William Hunt, an assistant U.S.
attorney, said he was satisfied with the sentence.</p>
<p>"The court treated Mr. Rose like it would treat anyone
else," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Rose's attorney, Reuven J. Katz, said Mr. Rose does
not plan to appeal.</p>
<p>Mr. Rose, who holds baseball's record for the most hits,
was sentenced for failing to report $355,000 from the sale of
baseball memorabilia, from appearances at baseball card shows
and from gambling. As part of a plea-bargain agreement, Mr.
Rose paid $366,000 in back taxes and penalties in April and
federal prosecutors agreed not to pursue further charges.</p>
<p>Mr. Rose's tax troubles came to light in February 1989
when major league baseball began an investigation into
allegations that he had bet on baseball games. The
investigation ended 11 months ago when Mr. Rose was banned
from baseball for life.</p>
