	<p class="article-leader">HARTFORD, Conn. -- United Technologies Corp. said
second-quarter profit rose 5.1%, which was in line with a
company statement this week.
   Profit was $207.5 million, or $1.64 a share, up from
$197.3 million, or $1.50 a share, in the year-earlier
quarter. The profit also reflected an $18 million after-tax
charge that was disclosed in the company's announcement
Monday. The charge was due to a plant closing at the Carrier
Corp. air-conditioning subsidiary.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue climbed 7.9% to $5.69 billion, from $5.27 billion.</p>
<p>Earnings benefited from continued strength in the results
of the Pratt & Whitney jet engine division and the Otis
elevator division, the company said, as well as profit
increases for the automotive and Sikorsky helicopter
businesses.</p>
<p>Besides the special charge, profit at Carrier fell sharply
because of a weak residential air-conditioner market in the
U.S., the company said.</p>
<p>"We continue to benefit from our strong international
businesses," said Robert F. Daniell, chairman and chief
executive officer.</p>
<p>The company said its order backlog on June 30 stood at
$21.1 billion, up from $17.5 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>For the first half of 1990, earnings rose 6.5% to $342
million, or $2.69 a share, from $321 million, or $2.45 a
share. Revenue increased 7.8% to $10.49 billion, from $9.73
billion.</p>
