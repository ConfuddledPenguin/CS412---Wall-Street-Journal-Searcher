	<h3>State Aid Guarantee Could Jeopardize U.S.-European Pact on Airbus Subsidies</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- U.S. and European trade officials say they're
closer than they've been in four years to settling their
broad differences over Airbus Industrie subsidies.
   But now that things are looking up, a new type of state
aid -- an exchange-rate guarantee introduced last year for
Airbus's West German partner -- is threatening to scuttle the
whole deal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S. trade officials say that if a comprehensive agreement
isn't signed by the end of this month, they will take their
complaint on the German aid to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. They say they may even pursue the GATT
complaint if an agreement is reached.</p>
<p>"We held off (going to the GATT) in February so that
people wouldn't appear to be negotiating under the gun," says
one U.S. official familiar with the dispute. "But Aug. 1 is
the cutoff. After that, we'd feel free to ask for a GATT
dispute-settlement panel."</p>
<p>If the U.S. does that, says a French government official
involved in the negotiations, all bets will be off for an
agreement with the Europeans.</p>
<p>The U.S. contends that such government guarantees of
exchange rates are illegal under the GATT code on subsidies.
The European Community and the four Airbus nations all are
signatories to the code.</p>
<p>Although the money Bonn will have to pay
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. to cover some of its
Airbus risks probably won't be enormous, "it sets a
precedent," says one U.S. official. And for West Germany, the
world's largest exporter, to give exchange-rate subsidies to
its industry is "patently ridiculous," he adds.</p>
<p>The problem cropped up last year when carmaker
Daimler-Benz AG took an initial 30% interest in
state-controlled MBB, whose Deutsche Airbus unit holds a
37.9% stake in Airbus. As a condition of the takeover and of
Daimler's eventual assumption of majority control of MBB,
Daimler insisted that it not be stuck with MBB's Airbus
losses.</p>
<p>Thus Bonn pledged to cover a portion of MBB's share of
losses on aircraft sold if the mark's value is between 1.6
and 1.8 to the dollar, under certain conditions. Aircraft
normally are sold in dollars. The program, which will be in
effect until 2000, would shift the burden back to MBB if the
rate passes 1.6 to the dollar. But if that were the case,
"we'd have to consider whether a European aircraft industry
is viable anymore," says one German official.</p>
<p>The exchange-rate aid was part of the price Bonn had to
pay to bring a private investor into MBB, says Hans Birke,
Deutsche Airbus's senior vice president for corporate
development. "It is a once-only measure without
precedent-setting effects," he says, adding that Bonn "would
certainly say no" to other German companies that asked for
similar assistance.</p>
<p>A senior West German official concurs. "There has been no
other application by German industry for the same scheme," he
says. And although Bonn will have to pay MBB something -- he
couldn't say what -- for the Airbus program for 1989, the
amount "does not correspond to our worst scenario."</p>
<p>Airbus's other partners, Aerospatiale of France, British
Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain,
receive no equivalent aid. But it doesn't appear that they
would squawk if the MBB subsidy dooms a peaceable settlement
to the Airbus dispute.</p>
<p>The French official says Paris regards the German subsidy
as "a deal between the German government and its industry. .
. . a question of sovereignty." A draft settlement prepared
by the Europeans would prohibit exchange-rate guarantees on
all future Airbus models but would give grandfather rights to
the MBB plan and to all existing models or those now under
development, the French official says.</p>
<p>The Airbus dispute dates to 1986, and it has blown hot and
cold over the years. In short, the U.S. contends that
government subsidies that Airbus receives allow the
consortium to build airplanes that may not be commercial
viable and to sell those airplanes at prices that bear little
relationship to costs. The Europeans counter that the U.S.
aircraft industry is hugely and indirectly subsidized through
defense research contracts and that the U.S. dominance of the
world airline market is a distortion of trade.</p>
