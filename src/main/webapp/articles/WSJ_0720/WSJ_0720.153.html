	<p class="article-leader">Tandem Computers Inc.'s stock skidded on disappointing
results for its third quarter, ended June 30. The computer
maker's stock fell $1.875 to close at $19.625 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   Tandem, based in Cupertino, Calif., reported $472 million
in revenue, an increase of 12% from the year-earlier period
but below analysts' expectations. Net income also was below
expectations, totaling $32.4 million, or 30 cents a share, up
5.5% from $30.8 million, or 31 cents a share, the year
before. There were more shares outstanding in this year's
quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>John B. Jones, an analyst with Montgomery Securities Inc.,
said Tandem's sales were hurt by soft business in the United
Kingdom and relatively weak demand for its highly reliable
mainframe and minicomputers among the securities industry and
government, two traditional big sectors for the company.</p>
