	<p class="article-leader">After a career of dancing difficult roles, Maina Gielgud
is playing her most challenging part -- artistic director of
the Australian Ballet.
   The Australian WHAT?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Well, that's part of the challenge, the elegant
British-born administrator allows during an interview to
promote the company's U.S. tour, its first in 14 years. She
hopes the three-week showcase, which opens Monday at New
York's Metropolitan Opera House and continues on to
Washington, D.C., and Costa Mesa, Calif., will go a ways
toward dispelling the notion that Aussies and ballet are
about as natural a combination as Mel Gibson and toe shoes.
(The company appears at the Met July 23-29, at the Kennedy
Center July 31-Aug. 5 and at the Orange County Performing
Arts Center Aug. 7-12.)</p>
<p>The company arrives here on a wave of successful
appearances from London to Leningrad. Not bad, especially for
an outfit that was -- to put it politely -- down at the heels
when the auburn-haired dancer/choreographer took charge in
December '82. The Melbourne-based troupe, Australia's
national classical company, had been wracked by a strike the
year before. Many dancers left during the dispute over
administrative and artistic policy; the most talented ones
routinely left anyway. After all, this was a place where,
according to one local critic, "A dancer had practically to
fall on her backside for the audience to notice anything was
wrong or for the administration to care."</p>
<p>Older and wiser types might have hesitated. But at 37 and
with just one year of semi-administrative experience -- as
rehearsal director of the London City Ballet -- Ms. Gielgud
saw a calculated risk. What convinced her to take the gamble
were the dancers.</p>
<p>"There was all this potential in the corps de ballet;
there were seven or eight men, several women who could
clearly make it to principal," recalls Ms. Gielgud, herself a
former star with Maurice Bejart's Ballet of the Twentieth
Century and the London Festival Ballet.</p>
<p>But there's lots of difference -- and loads of work --
between a promising corps dancer and a principal able to
command the stage for a three-act ballet. Ms. Gielgud, who'd
disregarded her uncle John's advice to switch to acting
because "ballet is too much like hard work," knew she was up
to the challenge. She wasn't too sure about her charges.</p>
<p>To promote the work ethic she wanted the new director
dangled a carrot -- opportunity. "She's willing to give
younger dancers a go," says wide-eyed Lisa Bolte, a
23-year-old soloist who beguiled London critics in the title
role of "The Sleeping Beauty." Indeed, on the U.S. tour only
two of the four Giselles will be principals.</p>
<p>Ms. Gielgud also offered the company a powerful role model
-- herself. However demanding she is of the dancers -- and
"demanding" seems to be her middle name -- she's even tougher
on herself. From the start she's been a full-time, hands-on
presence: teaching class, coaching rehearsals, watching and
critiquing all 200 performances a year. Says Noel Pelly, who
became the company's chief administrator just before her
arrival, "Maina works six days a week and on the seventh day
she does her homework."</p>
<p>To develop the dancers, Ms. Gielgud initiated a number of
programs. She began to import outstanding guest teachers. She
coaxed celebrated artists to serve as coaches, among them the
Bolshoi's legendary Galina Ulanova. She started sending young
dancers abroad every winter to see how other troupes function
(and hopefully to recognize that the grass was pretty green
back home at the company's new $17.4 million ballet center).
And when her proteges were ready, she arranged exchanges with
such premiere companies as the Kirov and the Royal Danish
Ballet.</p>
<p>Ms. Gielgud also fed her dancers a nourishing repertoire.
It includes classics such as "The Sleeping Beauty" and
"Giselle," both of which she's restaged, as well as
contemporary pieces based on classical technique. Only
recently has she felt the dancers were "ready to experiment
and to be experimented on" and started to seek out local
choreographic talent.</p>
<p>As U.S. audiences will gather from her "Giselle," Ms.
Gielgud's approach to the classics is, well, classic. No
Wilis on the outback or Albrechts with boomerangs. "I think
it's important with all the classics for the Australian
Ballet to show them in their most traditional way, because
we're the only company in the country able to do them at the
moment," she says. "It doesn't mean they have to be museum
pieces, because I think they come to life through the
individuality and the personality of the dancers." So expect
the dramatic Fiona Tonkin's Giselle ("her mad scene is very
special") to be very different from Lisa Pavane's "pure
classicism."</p>
<p>"I've never tried to make an Australian school, so to
speak, because I think one of their greatest qualities is the
fact that they can adapt to different styles," Ms. Gielgud
says of the 60-member company, about 75% of which she's
selected. "But I think what one does see is an enormous
vitality and energy, a lack of inhibition and an
expansiveness of movement."</p>
<p>This dynamism will be spotlighted in the U.S. premiere of
Hungarian Laszlo Seregi's "Spartacus," a dramatic work
designed "to show off the men." Unfortunately, one of the two
planned Spartaci, Adam Marchant (who Ms. Gielgud laughingly
calls "the male principal with the greatest sex appeal"), is
hors de combat with a broken foot. But audiences here will
get to see Steven Heathcote ("our best actor-dancer"). In
fact, they've already seen quite a bit of him -- he appears
as a scantily clad Spartacus in an eye-catching ad for the
troupe's tour.</p>
<p>And no matter what the program onstage, there will be a
willowy redhead down front. "As a dancer I felt very cheated
if the director wasn't there," Ms. Gielgud explains. "And the
other side is that I simply love it. I wouldn't miss a
performance for anything."</p>
