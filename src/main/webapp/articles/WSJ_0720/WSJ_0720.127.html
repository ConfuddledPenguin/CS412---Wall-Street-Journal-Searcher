	<p class="article-leader">Raben Publishing Co., a special interest magazine
publisher, said it sold Walking magazine to its publisher and
a group of investors.
   Boston-based Raben sold the four-year-old magazine to Jan
Thaw Bruce, the current publisher of Walking, and a group of
three venture capitalists, Ms. Bruce said. The investors
currently have put money into magazines such as In Health and
Health Journal. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Raben Publishing, founded by Norman Raben, started Walking
magazine in 1986 at the start of what appeared to be a new
trend drawing active adults.</p>
<p>Norman Raben, president of Raben Publishing, said he will
retain about a 15% interest in the magazine.</p>
<p>Mr. Raben, who also publishes Bicycle Guide magazine,
still faces large payments to creditors. In April, Raben
Publishing asked creditors, including printers, bankers,
paper suppliers, and consultants, to agree to an extended
schedule of debt payments.</p>
<p>Sources and creditors close to Raben Publishing said Mr.
Raben has sunk at least $20 million into three magazines,
including another, UltraSport, which later folded. Mr. Raben
is estimated to still owe as much as $10 million to
creditors.</p>
