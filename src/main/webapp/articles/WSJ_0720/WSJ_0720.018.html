	<p class="article-leader">St. Andrews, Scotland -- Arriving at the British Open golf
tournament here from the Wimbledon tennis festivities, where
a Swede beat a German in the men's final and an ex-Czech
whelmed the women, I found in the press tent a missive from
Sony, a Japanese electronics concern. It bore the news that
its ranking system, which is suitably complex, identifies
Greg Norman, the fair-haired Australian, as the world's best
golfer, and that of the next best five, two are Englishmen
and two are Spaniards.
   Clearly, something has happened on the country-club-sport
front, and it has not been good for the U.S. of A. Our
well-to-do class has let us down, big time. Congress should
investigate. Maybe even George Steinbrenner. He has gumshoe
experience with our Olympic Committee, you know, and may be
at liberty soon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Well, okay, I suppose that's excessive, especially the
part about George. I wouldn't wish him on anyone.
Furthermore, it's probably untrue, as well as uncharitable,
to blame any particular segment of our population for our
athletic shortcomings. Genius of all sorts seems to be
sprinkled randomly among nations and social classes, needing
only the slightest of nurture to bloom. I guess the European
gene pool hit a few winners, golf- and tennis-wise.</p>
<p>Such conclusions seem inescapable as the Sans-a-belt set
tees off in the British Open, golf's most international go. A
scan of the entry list reveals contestants from no less than
14 lands, and possibly more. (Is Dalmahoy a country?) The
host nation is pleased to call the event, simply, "The Open,"
and it's bad form to demur within its citizens' hearing.</p>
<p>Many of the players are more than happy to go along. "The
Open is The Open; it's the major major," said Norman on
Tuesday. He also declared "The Open is open," meaning that he
thought just about anyone could win it. That's something
coming from a guy who looks like he never should lose, like
Boris Becker in tennis.</p>
<p>In fact, though, the Open may not be so open, and the home
team, meaning the Europeans, may have an edge at St. Andrews
in the unexpectedly warm and sunny weather that has the Scots
tickled over their pink foreheads. After all, they know best
the lay of the Old Course, where the undulating fairways look
like an elephants' graveyard and steep-sided "pot" bunkers
wait to ensnare errant or unlucky tee shots.</p>
<p>"St. Andrews doesn't share the Americans' fetish for
watering their golf courses, so where the ball lands is not
where it stops," noted Norman, the 1986 titlist, who was full
of wisdom this week. "Experience counts for more here than in
other places."</p>
<p>Norman's assertion was disputed by Mark Calcavecchia, an
insouciant Yank whose opinion must be counted because he won
this thing last year, at Troon, to end five years of
uninterrupted non-U.S. possession of the winner's silver
pitcher. That reversed the pattern begun in 1961, when Arnold
Palmer led a U.S. rediscovery of this ancient event and 16
wins by Americans followed in a 23-year period. Sadly, and
perhaps fittingly, Palmer, now 60, has said that this British
Open will be his last.</p>
<p>Calcavecchia showed up Tuesday and said he thought a
couple of practice rounds would suffice to refresh his memory
of the course. "I played here last fall in the Dunhill Cup
{an international match-play team tourney}, and kept my
yardage book," he grinned. "They say they haven't changed the
place in 150 years, so it oughta still be good."</p>
<p>He added: "We Americans are smart enough to figure out how
to get around a golf course. You stay away from the traps,
and if it's windy you keep the ball low and bump it up. I've
never heard that the ball bounces worse for us than for
anybody else."</p>
<p>So maybe talent also has something to do with it, but on
this score, too, the Europeans are unrelenting. A brochure
distributed by the European PGA cheekily heralds its
tournament circuit as "The Tour of the 1990s." It buttresses
the claim by recounting its members' more notable recent
achievements, including their British Open glory, three
straight U.S. Masters' titles, victories in the 1985 and '87
Ryder Cups and a tie in the 1989 renewal of the biennial U.S.
vs. Europe competition that both continents' golfing
mercenaries regard with surprising seriousness.</p>
<p>If you count Norman, who used to tour in Europe but now
plays, and leads, the U.S. PGA circuit, the American golfing
slump would be severe, but even if you don't it's still
significant. The No. 2 guy in the Sony rankings is Nick
Faldo, the tall Englishman who'd be No. 1 if only recent
majors were counted. Besides winning the 1987 British Open at
Muirfield, and the 1989 and '90 Masters, Faldo forced Curtis
Strange into a playoff at the 1988 Colonial (oops, U.S.)
Open, and came within a stroke of joining Hale Irwin and Mike
Donald in the one that decided this year's edition.</p>
<p>"I channel all my thoughts toward the majors -- that's
what golf is all about," avers Faldo, with an eye toward
history that's appropriate for one whose titles include an
MBE.</p>
<p>And if a longish shot is more to your liking, you might
fancy a shortish Brit, Ian Woosnam. This former Welsh farm
boy, who stands but 5 foot 4 and weighs a chunky 11 stone 7
(161 pounds), has been the hottest thing in Europe next to
the sun of late. He cashed a final-round 60 in winning the
Monte Carlo Open in early July, and posted a 62 in his
triumph at the Scottish Open at Gleneagles last week.</p>
<p>Woosy stands No. 6 in the Sony but No. 1 in the hearts of
the many galleryites who like to see a wee mon succeed. He is
practical about his aim in golf, which is to "make enough
money to live on for the rest of my life," but says that his
homeland's title would suit him fine, MBE or no, and that a
bit o' St. Andrews wind might not hurt.</p>
<p>"Maybe a short player would have an advantage then," he
surmises. "A taller player can get blown about and more can
go wrong with his swing. When you are smaller you're more
compact in the wind."</p>
<p>Makes sense to me.</p>
