In the year-ago period, the utility had net income of $152.6
million, or 61 cents a share.
   Revenues, adjusted to reflect court-ordered rate cuts,
fell to $846.4 million from $1.31 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A rate rollback and refund, ordered by the Illinois
Supreme Court in May, generated an after-tax provision of
$253 million, or $1.19 a share.</p>
<p>Disallowances and a refund ordered in June by the Illinois
Appellate Court, concerning Commonwealth's Byron 1 nuclear
plant, required a charge of $208 million, or 98 cents a
share, in the latest quarter.</p>
