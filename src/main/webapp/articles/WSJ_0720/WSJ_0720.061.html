	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co., hurt by a
slide in long-distance revenue and sluggish equipment sales,
said net income fell 6% in the second quarter on a 2.5% drop
in sales.
   AT&T said it also paid heavily trying to keep up with
demand for its new Universal credit card, which has garnered
at least two million cardholders since its unveiling in
March.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net fell to $657 million, or 60 cents a share, from $699
million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to
$9.03 billion from $9.26 billion.</p>
<p>In the first half, net rose 2.4% to $1.33 billion, or
$1.22 a share, from $1.29 billion, or $1.20 a share, the year
before. Sales of $17.92 billion were unchanged.</p>
<p>AT&T's results were expected after it announced last month
that earnings would decline. Since that announcement, the
company's stock, which had been hovering in the low 40s, has
fallen to the mid-30s. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, AT&T rose 50 cents to $37.625 on volume of
1.9 million shares.</p>
<p>Despite the bland profit performance, AT&T Chairman Robert
E. Allen said, "We still expect 1990 to be better than 1989,
a record earnings year. These results don't alter our
confidence in our direction or our future prospects."</p>
<p>Included in the results were charges of about $100 million
to cover consolidations, layoffs and other costs in AT&T's
services businesses, including long-distance and maintenance
and installation.</p>
<p>AT&T also took a charge of about $290 million to cover
consolidations and personnel reallocations in microelectronic
parts and systems and for reclaiming scrap metal.</p>
<p>All this was offset by a credit of $400 million, which
came from a net reduction in the reserves set up in December
1988 associated with modernization of AT&T's network. AT&T
attributed the reduction to lower removal and disposal costs
of obsolete equipment. The company said the reduction would
have been even greater if not for increased costs from force
reductions and facilities closings.</p>
<p>Sales of equipment continued to be hurt by a slowdown in
the business market. While sales of switching and
transmission equipment to phone companies inched ahead 1.8%
to $1.8 billion, other equipment sales suffered. Business,
data and consumer equipment revenue fell 11% to $1.7 billion.
AT&T doesn't break out its profit for its equipment
businesses, but analysts estimate the company is losing more
than $300 million a year on office phone systems and computer
equipment.</p>
<p>On the services side, long-distance revenue fell 3.9% to
$4.8 billion from $5.02 billion. AT&T attributed the decline
to $100 million in additional payments to the local phone
companies for completing long-distance calls over their local
networks, and a shift by an undisclosed number of business
customers to newer, lower-priced communications services.</p>
<p>Still, Morris Tanenbaum, AT&T vice chairman and chief
financial officer, was optimistic about long-distance
operations. He noted that AT&T's traffic volume grew 7%, an
indication that it has begun to stanch a loss of business to
its primary competitors, MCI Communications Corp. and US
Sprint Communications Co., a unit of United
Telecommunications Inc.</p>
<p>"We don't see any decrease in overall strength of the
market, said Mr. Tanenbaum. "And our profitability remains
strong."</p>
<p>Jack Grubman, analyst at PaineWebber Inc., said the
quarter "was probably better than expected," given that
product sales decreased a meager 2% in a very tough pricing
environment and "their margins of 43% are the highest they've
been in three years." Moreover, he said AT&T's long-distance
volume grew 15% to 20% in the small-business arena, where MCI
and Sprint have experienced sluggishness.</p>
