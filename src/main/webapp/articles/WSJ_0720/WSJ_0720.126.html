	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The owner of a large Dallas savings and loan
under investigation by a Senate subcommittee is trying to
sell the thrift, and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum asked regulators
to block any sale until the inquiry has ended.
   A Bluebonnet Savings Bank spokesman said owner James Fail
has been discussing a sale of the institution "for months,"
though no definitive agreement has been reached.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sen. Metzenbaum, an Ohio Democrat, has held hearings on
the December 1988 sale of 15 insolvent thrifts by the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. Mr. Fail put up $1,000 of
his own money and borrowed $70 million to take control of the
thrifts. He subsequently merged them to form Bluebonnet,
which has $3 billion in assets. Sen. Metzenbaum has charged
that the government gave Mr. Fail a sweetheart deal. The
senator is looking for ways to renegotiate or repudiate part
of the agreement the government made to guarantee profits on
much of Bluebonnet's bad assets.</p>
<p>Mr. Metzenbaum also has raised questions about why Mr.
Fail, an Arizona insurance executive, was allowed to buy the
S&Ls despite the fact that one of his companies pleaded
guilty to fraud in Alabama in 1976.</p>
<p>In a letter to federal thrift regulators released
yesterday, Mr. Metzenbaum said, "I believe that the
government's position with reference to renegotiating its
contract with Bluebonnet would be made more difficult if a
sale were to be made prior to the conclusion of our
investigation."</p>
