	<p class="article-leader">BOISE, Idaho -- Morrison Knudsen Corp. said it formally
notified a Texas state agency that it plans to compete for a
contract to build a proposed $2.2 billion high-speed rail
link to carry passengers between Houston and Dallas in just
one hour and 45 minutes.
   Morrison Knudsen is heading a consortium hoping to win the
job of building the rail link, which ultimately could be
expanded to include other Texas cities. As reported, the
company's proposal faces many hurdles, including an expected
competing application from a West German group.</p>
