	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's household spending rose an
inflation-adjusted 3.4% in May, the statistics bureau of the
prime minister's office said, reflecting the low level of
year-earlier spending after a 3% consumption tax was
introduced in April 1989.
   But even excluding the tax factor, the May spending showed
continued strong growth in consumer demand, one of the
pillars supporting Japan's 44-month economic expansion.
Spending on luxury items continued to increase, especially
for high-quality electric appliances and personal computers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>May spending by households throughout Japan averaged
298,501 yen ($2,201). Wage-earning families spent 310,980
yen, up 5.2% from a year earlier, despite a 3.6% drop in real
income to 408,312 yen in the month. Families' disposable
income declined 6.1% to 323,224 yen, because of a change in
the quarterly distribution of government social insurance
payments. Spending by independent business owners and their
families inched up 0.5% to 276,828 yen.</p>
