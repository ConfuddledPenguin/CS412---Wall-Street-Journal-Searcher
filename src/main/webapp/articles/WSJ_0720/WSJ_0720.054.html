	<p class="article-leader">When a disgruntled fan jeered John McEnroe during a
championship match several years ago, the tennis pro strode
over to where his antagonist was seated and threw a raging
fit.
   Mr. McEnroe went on to win the match, but his tantrum had
unexpected consequences: The fan filed a suit in Nassau
County, N.Y., claiming $6 million in damages. It was, says
the judge assigned to the case, "a really good example of a
lawsuit that should never have been brought."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But was it frivolous?</p>
<p>More and more, judges are asking that question about
lawsuits and pleadings. The reason is a growing movement in
state and federal courts to punish litigants who make
frivolous arguments by slapping them with fines and other
sanctions.</p>
<p>In June, the U.S. Supreme Court gave added impetus to the
trend by upholding a $21,000 fine against a Washington, D.C.,
law firm that withdrew an antitrust suit against a clothing
maker only five months after filing it. The allegations
turned out to be groundless. Such penalties are needed, the
court ruled, as a means "of curbing abuses of the judicial
system."</p>
<p>But the trend, welcomed by some as a way to help judges
weed through mounting caseloads, is fueling one of the
hottest legal debates today. Judges, lawyers and legal
academics are split over what constitutes frivolous
litigation and under what circumstances fines should be
ordered.</p>
<p>In the McEnroe case, Nassau County Supreme Court Judge
Francis X. Becker had no trouble finding the lawsuit
frivolous and throwing it out. But he says he is reluctant to
define frivolous litigation or to impose sanctions.</p>
<p>Lawyers complain that there is little uniformity from
court to court on the subject and that judges are arbitrary
in their decisions. Fear of being fined for raising
innovative arguments or bringing unusual suits, critics say,
will make lawyers overly cautious, chill imaginative advocacy
and constrain access to the courts. Experts agree the problem
is particularly acute in areas of the law that are constantly
developing, particularly civil rights.</p>
<p>"Today's frivolity may be tomorrow's precedent," says Sol
Wachtler, chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals.
"There has to be a great deal of care paid to {avoid}
stifling a lawsuit before it has had time to develop."</p>
<p>New York is among 28 states where judges can order lawyers
to pay fines or legal fees to defendants named in frivolous
suits or court pleadings. The standard most often used is
similar to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
which provides for disciplinary sanctions against lawyers and
litigants in federal court. The rule was toughened in 1983
and now requires lawyers to certify before they file a suit
that they have conducted a reasonable inquiry to make sure it
is well grounded, both in fact and in legal theory.</p>
<p>Before 1983, judges issued only a handful of sanctions
because the rule permitted them only if it could be shown
that lawyers had made arguments in bad faith. Since the rule
was broadened, federal judges have issued 688 published
opinions on motions by attorneys requesting sanctions against
opposing counsel, says Fordham Law School Prof. Georgene M.
Vairo. The requests were granted or strong warnings given in
nearly 60% of the cases.</p>
<p>Even so, federal judges remain divided on when they should
crack down on litigants, and do so with varying frequency.
New York and Chicago account for nearly one-third of the
reported cases, says Ms. Vairo.</p>
<p>State judges are equally uncertain about how to handle
suits that could be considered frivolous. Take the case of
Judith R. Haimes, a professional psychic in Philadelphia who
underwent a CAT scan of her brain in 1976. The procedure, she
claimed in a lawsuit, left her with blinding headaches and
unable "to read auras."</p>
<p>Sound dubious? Philadelphia Common Pleas Judge Leon Katz
thought so, but he says he still wouldn't have sanctioned the
lawyer who brought the case. "Who are we -- the judges -- to
determine in retrospect whether a lawyer should take a case?"
asks Judge Katz.</p>
<p>Last month, two Nassau County men went to trial before
Judge Becker over a fight that took place five years ago when
both were in high school. The plaintiff claimed he was
"sucker punched" in the nose by the defendant. He named his
old nemesis for throwing the punch and the school for not
providing adequate supervision.</p>
<p>"I thought it was frivolous," says the judge. Not the
jury. It awarded the plaintiff $25,000, of which $5,000 must
be paid by the school.</p>
<p>"At the early stage, it's difficult to tell cases that are
just idiosyncratic from those that may take awhile but will
sink in on people as truly having merit," says Marc Galanter,
director of the Institute for Legal Studies at the University
of Wisconsin, in Madison. Claims such as intentional
infliction of emotional distress, theories of product
liability and numerous civil rights arguments that are now
woven tightly into law could easily have been dismissed a
generation ago, Mr. Galanter says.</p>
<p>"If we could go back 40 years, the thought of a black
person at a lunch counter suing because he was refused a meal
would have appeared frivolous," adds James A. Henderson Jr.,
a professor at Cornell University Law School.</p>
<p>Critics of Rule 11 say they are most concerned that the
sanctions are being used disproportionately against
plaintiffs in civil rights cases. A year-long study of 121
motions seeking Rule 11 sanctions filed in the Third U.S.
Circuit concluded that plaintiffs and lawyers in civil rights
cases were sanctioned five times as often as their
counterparts in other cases.</p>
<p>The cases ranged from a husband seeking to set aside a
state-court divorce settlement to a former federal employee
claiming wrongful discharge. None involved allegations of
race, sex or age discrimination, and in all of them, the
sanctions appeared appropriate under the rule, says Stephen
B. Burbank, a University of Pennsylvania Law School professor
who drafted the study report.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the study warned of the chilling effect the
rule might have on imaginative civil rights suits."When you
have a Rule 11 sanction staring at your throat, it gets very
scary when you bring these suits," says Jon Green, a lawyer
at Smith, Mullin & Kiernan in West Orange, N.J., which
specializes in civil rights.</p>
<p>Most often, sanctions are applied in cases without major
policy implications where the abuses appear extreme. They
frequently involve individuals who are acting as their own
attorneys. A case in point is James L. Cheek, a pilot for
American Airlines who filed a lawsuit in 1985 claiming that
the withholding of federal income and Social Security taxes
amounted to the unconstitutional taking of property.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheek was no stranger to representing himself. In 1983
he sued the IRS claiming invasion of privacy. Three years
later he sued Cook County, Ill., for payment "in gold or
silver" for serving on a jury. A federal judge finally
lowered the boom on Mr. Cheek in 1986 for his tax suit and
slapped him with an $11,500 fine. (The amount was later
deemed excessive by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago and reduced by $5,000.)</p>
<p>Another extreme case involved Bruce A. Coane, a Houston
lawyer who was ordered to pay more than $16,000 in fees and
costs last month by the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in New Orleans. Mr. Coane alleged that he broke a tooth when
he bit into a cookie from a Houston bakery. Seeking to settle
out of court, Mr. Coane used various tactics to drag the case
out for three years in federal court, then withdrew the suit
and refiled it in state court, according to the appeals court
opinion.</p>
<p>Ordered by the federal judge in the case to pay $9,184,
Mr. Coane appealed. But the appeal judges were equally
outraged. Citing "unprofessional and improper motives," they
slapped Mr. Coane with $6,921 in additional sanctions for
arguing a frivolous appeal. "Mr. Coane's efforts to justify
his misconduct taxes our credulity," they wrote.</p>
<p>Lawyers who don't adequately investigate whether they have
a valid complaint also don't get much sympathy from judges.
In the case recently before the U.S. Supreme Court, the
Washington, D.C., firm of Cooter & Gell filed an antitrust
suit against Hartmarx Corp., a men's clothing manufacturer.
The suit alleged a nationwide conspiracy to fix prices and
eliminate competition. The problem was the law firm surveyed
only four Eastern cities before making the allegation.</p>
<p>"{Sanctions} are a useful instrument to make sure lawyers
think more about their obligation to their work," says
William W. Schwarzer, director of the Federal Judicial
Center, the research arm of the federal court system's
administrative office.</p>
<p>But critics argue that judges faced with frivolous
pleadings have always had the power to dismiss a case or send
more creative signals.</p>
<p>When a divorcing Long Island couple sued over who would
get custody of tickets to the New York Islander play-off
games, New York Appeals Judge Anthony DiPaolo was incensed.
But even now he's not sure he would have fined the couple. A
better solution, he says, would have been to keep the tickets
and delay a decision until after the hockey play-offs.
"That," says the judge, "would have been poetic justice."</p>
