	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Budget negotiators of both parties are
considering proposals that would curb itemized tax
deductions, including those taken for mortgage-interest
expenses, charitable giving and state and local tax payments.
   No decisions have been reached. But broad and narrow
limitations on deductions taken by individuals have been
discussed in private meetings. Documents that include such
limitations have been drafted by congressional Democrats and
Bush administration aides.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The idea of restricting itemized deductions has emerged
because of the Democrats' demand that any tax package hit the
wealthy harder than others. The search for ways to meet this
objective has intensified as it begins to appear more likely
that the tax plan will be anchored by a big new broad-based
tax on energy, which would hit low-income individuals harder
than those who are better off.</p>
<p>Curbing itemized deductions is an effective way to raise
the tax burden on upperincome Americans. At last count in
1986, 43% of all itemized deductions were taken by the 9% of
taxpayers who had adjusted gross income of more than $50,000
a year, according to the Internal Revenue Service. At the
same time, however, some of the deductions that might be
trimmed are among the most politically popular in the tax
code and have withstood assaults in years past.</p>
<p>Proposals discussed by the budget negotiators range from
reducing all deductions by, for example, 10% to placing
ceilings on such deductions for the highest-income
individuals. The Bush administration has floated the idea of
limiting the amount of deductions taken for state income tax
payments to $15,000 a year.</p>
<p>Other options that have been discussed include restricting
allowable deductions to a percentage of adjusted gross
income, reducing the value of the deductions by applying them
against only the lower, 15% tax bracket and disallowing
deductions of more than a given dollar figure, say $10,000,
for any individual. Another option is to allow deductions
only if they exceed a certain percentage of income.</p>
<p>"Both sides are looking at (limiting) itemized
deductions," a Democratic staffer said. "There are scores of
ways to do it."</p>
<p>Budget summit negotiators met for about two hours
yesterday, their first formal meeting in a week, for what
House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
diplomatically described as "a frank discussion . . . about
the difficulty in trying to arrive at an agreement while
political weapons are being used day to day."</p>
<p>The summit tentatively agreed to reconvene early next
week. President Bush has invited top congressional leaders to
meet with him on the budget talks Monday.</p>
<p>The Democrats are determined to structure a progressive
tax package that hits higher-income taxpayers at least as
hard as lower-income people. The Bush administration is
trying to find ways to accomplish this without increasing the
top individual tax rate to 33% from the current 28% as the
Democrats want.</p>
<p>For their part, Democrats don't think raising the top rate
is enough, particularly if the tax plan includes both excise
taxes and a cut in capital gains taxes, which is sought by
President Bush and almost exclusively benefits the very
richest Americans. The excise tax increases most discussed
are a broad-based energy tax, tobacco taxes and taxes on
alcoholic beverages.</p>
<p>Tax writers note that there is plenty of precedent for
placing limits on deductions. Tax law already allows the
deduction for medical expenses only if they exceed 7.5% of an
individual's adjusted gross income. Only 80% of dining and
entertainment costs are deductible as a business expense. And
a variety of miscellaneous deductions can be taken only if
they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income a year.</p>
<p>Congressional aides note that a wholesale scaling back of
deductions mightn't be needed to achieve a balance in the tax
burden between rich and poor. Specific deductions could be
targeted for cutback, as the Bush administration has
privately suggested. Or, they said, poor people could be
aided by increases in the refundable earned-income tax credit
and an increase in the standard deduction taken by taxpayers
who don't itemize. Increases in those tax benefits are being
considered on their own merits.</p>
<p>Considerable revenue can be raised by curtailing
deductions. By way of illustration, the respected
Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that
limiting the deduction for mortgage-interest payments to
$12,000 a year for an individual and $20,000 a year for a
joint filer would raise $600 million in the first year.
Restricting the deduction of state and local taxes to 9% of
adjusted gross income would raise $700 million in the first
year.</p>
<p>Talk about any such restrictions has compelled lobbyists
for a number of interests to step up their efforts on Capitol
Hill, particularly those who represent state and local
governments. Real estate interests also are considering how
to defend their tax breaks.</p>
<p>Judging from the past, their chances of success could be
high. Speaking of previous battles over deductions, Rep. Bill
Frenzel (R., Minn.) said, "If they didn't go through then,
they may have some difficulty going through now."</p>
