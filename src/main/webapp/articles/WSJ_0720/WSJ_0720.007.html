	<p class="article-leader">BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Mentor Graphics Corp., as expected,
reported a sharp drop in earnings and a dip in revenue for
its second quarter.
   On July 3, Mentor, which makes software used by engineers,
said it expected to post a disappointing quarter because of a
slowdown in orders caused, in part, by competitors' fierce
pricing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net income for the quarter was $3.6 million, down from
$12.3 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue was $101
million, down from $105.8 million.</p>
