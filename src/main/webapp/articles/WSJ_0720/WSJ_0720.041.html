	<p class="article-leader">Peter Magowan's response (Letters, June 15) to the
Journal's May 16 article on Safeway made very interesting
reading. There is one point on which I would very much like
to hear from Mr. Magowan. He was the chief executive of the
company for many years prior to the leveraged buy-out, during
which time, according to his letter, labor costs were out of
line. Mr. Magowan justifies his action after the LBO as
"taking the painful measures you know are necessary to ensure
the health of the business in the future," and on behalf of
"shareholder value." Why did it take the Hafts and an LBO to
enable the chief executive of the company to address its most
critical problem? If he had taken those actions while the
company was publicly owned, other shareholders would have
derived the value.
   This is an underlying question and argument that has
bedeviled the LBO picture generally. Perhaps Mr. Magowan can
help clarify the matter.</p>
