	<p class="article-leader">Unisys Corp. said second-quarter earnings fell 78% on
lower revenue, but the computer company reiterated its hope
that a strong fourth quarter would put it in the black for
the year.
   The results came in slightly below expectations, however,
and securities analysts said Unisys has a tough row to hoe --
especially in light of the company's acknowledgement that
growth in its international business slowed while domestic
business remained depressed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"You kind of feel for these guys," said Dan Benton of
Goldman, Sachs & Co. "They're smart guys and they know what
they have to do, but they really have their work cut out for
them."</p>
<p>Mr. Benton's comments reflected a new, almost sympathetic
attitude on Wall Street toward Unisys' woes, which have been
battering the Blue Bell, Pa., company's stock for more than a
year. Still, many analysts again cut their estimate of 1990
earnings, to deliver a new consensus of 50 cents to $1 a
share, down from 75 cents to $1.50.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Unisys shares closed at $12.75, up 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>Second-quarter results showed progress in cutting
expenses, which dropped 5.2% from a year earlier. Operating
profit rose 36%, to $102 million, and Unisys' heavy debt was
trimmed by $265 million, with much of that reduction financed
by a $150 million sale of preferred stock to Japan's Mitsui &
Co.</p>
<p>But gross profit margins reversed the progress they made
in the first quarter, dropping to 37% from 39%, "not the most
encouraging sign," said Steve Milunovich of First Boston
Corp. And revenue was hurt by a tough comparison with 1989,
when a new line of mainframes rolled out to pent-up demand.
That momentum has faded, replaced by growth in more strategic
-- but currently unprofitable -- low-end products based on
the Unix operating system.</p>
<p>Earnings in the quarter were $11.8 million, which
translated to a loss of nine cents a share after preferred
dividend payments. That compared with earnings of $53.6
million, or 17 cents a share, in the period a year ago.
Revenue fell 4% to $2.47 billion from $2.57 billion.</p>
<p>In the first half, the company posted earnings of $8.6
million, which translated to a loss of 28 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $25.1 million, or 50 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue was virtually unchanged at $4.78
billion.</p>
<p>"We are continuing to pursue our priority goal of
profitability for the full year, recognizing that based on a
seasonally weak third quarter this requires a strong fourth
quarter," James Unruh, Unisys' president and chief executive,
said in a statement.</p>
<p>Because of the lackluster quarterly showing, Standard &
Poor's Corp. said it will consider lowering its ratings on
debt and preferred stock of Unisys and its finance
subsidiary. About $4 billion in debt is affected.</p>
<p>S&P said the review covers Unisys' triple-B senior debt,
triple-B-minus subordinated debt and double-B-plus preferred
stock, and Unisys Finance Corp.'s triple-B senior debt.</p>
