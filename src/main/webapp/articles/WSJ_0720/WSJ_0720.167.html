	<h3>Workplace: Many Businesses Responding Too Slowly To Rapid Work Force Shifts, Study Says</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Many work force dilemmas predicted for the year 2000 are
already here -- and most businesses are coping poorly, a new
study says.
   The study reports pressing shortages of technical,
professional and secretarial workers at many companies,
"skills gaps" that are causing high turnover, and
fast-growing diversity in the labor pool.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But managers aren't responding to the changes quickly
enough, the study suggests. It cites a lack of "leading-edge"
recruitment and training strategies, as well as a scarcity of
progressive "support structures" for women and minority
workers such as day-care centers and mentor programs.</p>
<p>Conducted by the Hudson Institute, an Indianapolis
research group, and Towers Perrin, a New York benefits
consulting firm, the study is billed as the first major
follow-up to the influential Workforce 2000 report issued in
1987 by Hudson and the U.S. Department of Labor. That report
drew much attention for its projection of radical demographic
changes. It predicted, among other things, that white males
would constitute only 15% of net additions to the work force
by the year 2000, down sharply from 45% in 1985.</p>
<p>The new study, released yesterday, moves beyond its
forerunner by documenting work force changes that are taking
place now, and the ways that corporate America is reacting.</p>
<p>Qualified workers are in short supply at more than half of
the surveyed companies. Scientists and technical workers are
the most elusive; some 70% of the surveyed companies are
having difficulty recruiting them. Professionals in general
are also hard to get. And 55% of the companies surveyed say
they are having trouble finding secretaries and clerks.</p>
<p>All industries are suffering and expect problems to grow
more severe, but the shortages are currently affecting
industrial, consumer products and health care companies worst
of all, the study says. The most extreme problems: Some 89%
of consumer products companies reported difficulty finding
workers with technical training, while nearly as many health
care concerns can't find enough scientists.</p>
<p>The study doesn't cite specific companies, but many
corroborate the findings. At Schering-Plough Corp., a
Madison, N.J., maker of medical products, worries about a
shortage of scientists and engineers have helped prompt an
upper-level management review of recruitment strategies and
other issues related to Workforce 2000. Among other steps,
the company will soon expand the number of colleges from
which it seeks promising candidates. "We're trying to become
more aggressive," says Linda A. Cardillo, director of
corporate human resources.</p>
<p>But job fairs and other traditional recruitment techniques
are still more popular than the more unusual means that have
gained considerable publicity in recent years, the study
found. Although 39% of surveyed companies are boosting
starting salaries, fewer than one-quarter are rehiring
retirees or recruiting the elderly, disabled and other
"nontraditional" workers.</p>
<p>Companies also have been slow to make a strong commitment
to training the workers they do hire. Two-thirds of the
surveyed firms spend less than $2,000 for classroom and other
on-the-job education for first-year workers. That helps
account for high annual turnover rates, the study says. Half
of the surveyed firms reported about 28% turnover for new
hires.</p>
<p>Other factors may alienate workers, too. One-fourth of all
surveyed companies said their corporate cultures weren't
"open to diversity," while 29% said discrimination was a
problem and 15% reported "overt harassment" of minorities as
a concern.</p>
<p>Such results suggest that "organizations' readiness to
manage the changing work force is mixed at best," the study
says.</p>
<p>The study indicates that diversity is already a reality at
many companies. Minorities constitute at least one-fifth of
the work force at some 39% of surveyed firms, while women
make up more than half the employees at 47% of the companies.</p>
<p>Still, just one-fourth of companies are training
supervisors in the complexities of managing "a disparate
group" of employees, the study says. Even fewer are adopting
innovative ways to ease conflicts between work and family and
lower the "glass ceilings" that many minority and women
workers face.</p>
<p>While 42% of companies engage in "explicit" minority
recruiting, for instance, just 12% train minorities for
supervisory positions. Only 11% have created minority support
groups and 10%, mentor programs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 81% of surveyed companies have formal policies
banning sexual harassment. But management training for women
exists at only 32% of firms, while 8% of companies have
created support and mentor groups for women. Under one-third
of companies offer extended maternity leave and just 15% have
on-site or nearsite day care.</p>
<p>"You've got to be conscious that the work force is
changing," says Cliff Ehrlich, senior vice president for
human resources at Marriott Corp., Washington. Marriott will
bring together senior managers later this month for its first
companywide meeting on "cultural diversity," which Mr.
Ehrlich says will allow the sharing among divisions of ideas
used "only locally until now."</p>
<p>Many companies, Mr. Ehrlich adds, have been so preoccupied
with slashing jobs that they haven't taken the time to worry
about remaining workers. But at the same time, he says, many
companies haven't tackled the prospect of a changing work
force simply because the issues it presents are so new.</p>
<p>"Our attitudes have all been forged in an era when labor
has been plentiful," he says. "That's history, and no one's
really sure what the other side looks like. It's tough to do
something about things you don't know about."</p>
