	<p class="article-leader">DENVER -- Apache Corp. expects to report second-quarter
net income rose 67% to about $7.5 million, or 17 cents a
share, from $4.5 million, or 14 cents a share, a year
earlier, said Raymond Plank, chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Attributing the record second-quarter results to increased
natural gas production and reduced costs, Mr. Plank said
six-month net income increased 92% to about $19 million, or
43 cents a share, from $9.9 million, or 30 cents a share, a
year earlier. Shares outstanding as of June 30 averaged about
44.6 million, reflecting a 35% increase from 33 million a
year ago. The company is expected to report its earnings next
week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Plank said revenue for the second quarter is expected
to match the year-earlier's $59 million. Six-month revenue
rose about 5% to $127 million from $120.6 million.</p>
<p>Apache's natural gas production during the quarter
increased about 15% to 260 million cubic feet a day from 227
million cubic feet.</p>
<p>With oil prices off slightly from a year ago, Mr. Plank
said second-quarter oil production was "close to flat"
compared with 1989 when Apache produced about 8,600 barrels a
day.</p>
<p>Mr. Plank said Apache had recorded about a 25% reduction
in lease operating, administrative and financing costs during
the first six months, much of it because of the conversion of
two debenture issues, which resulted in a savings in interest
costs of about $1 million a month.</p>
<p>Because of Apache's performance during the first six
months, Mr. Plank said, "we do not have basis to disagree"
with analysts' estimates that per-share earnings for 1990
will be 75 cents to 80 cents.</p>
