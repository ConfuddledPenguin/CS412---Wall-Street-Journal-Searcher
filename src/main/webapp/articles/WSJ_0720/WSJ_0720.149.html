	<p class="article-leader">Colgate-Palmolive Co.'s second-quarter profit increased
11.3%, bolstered by a more profitable mix of products
world-wide, price hikes and declining raw material costs.
   The New York-based consumer-products company posted net
income of $81.9 million, or $1.17 a share, up from $73.6
million or $1.06 a share, a year earlier. Colgate's preferred
dividend payments totaled $4.9 million during the quarter,
compared with $717,000. The increase is due to the formation
in June 1989 of a class of preferred that pays a high
dividend. Colgate's quarterly sales rose to $1.5 billion from
$1.3 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The results reflected the "growing strength of our
world-wide distribution system," said Reuben Mark, Colgate's
chairman and chief executive officer. Colgate said its major
units in most markets generated higher operating profit.
Operations in Europe and Mexico were particularly strong, the
company said. The company's gross profit margin during the
quarter rose to 44.9% from 42.7% a year earlier.</p>
<p>Colgate's net for the first half of 1990 was $163.2
million, or $2.32 a share, compared with $140.8 million, or
$2.04 a share. Sales increased to $2.8 billion from $2.5
billion.</p>
