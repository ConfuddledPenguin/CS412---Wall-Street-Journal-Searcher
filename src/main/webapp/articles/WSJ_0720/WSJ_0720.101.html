	<p class="article-leader">AMSTERDAM -- Dutch industrial production in May declined
1% from April, the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics said.
   But in the first five months of the year, output grew 5%
from a year earlier, when the year-to-year increase was 4%.
The latest five-month pace was led by the electrical
engineering, rubber and synthetics, and metals industries.</p>
