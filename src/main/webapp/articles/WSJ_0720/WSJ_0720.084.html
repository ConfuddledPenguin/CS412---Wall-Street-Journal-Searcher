	<p class="article-leader">Navistar International Corp. is considering a bid for Mack
Trucks Inc. that would compete with one already under way
from Renault Vehicules Industriels S.A.
   Renault Vehicules already owns a 45% Mack stake, and it
recently launched a $6-a-share, or $99 million, tender offer
for the 55% of the Allentown, Pa., truck maker it doesn't
currently control.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Navistar, among the U.S.'s biggest truck manufacturers,
approached a committee of Mack's directors to express
interest in a possible bid that would exceed Renault's offer.</p>
<p>However, Navistar said it couldn't proceed with an offer
unless Renault decided to dispose of its interest in Mack, an
action Renault said in a news release that it "has no
interest" in taking.</p>
<p>Moreover, the truck-making unit of Regie Nationale des
Usines Renault could increase its stake in Mack to 61% from
45% by exercising a warrant and converting certain debentures
it owns.</p>
<p>In Allentown, a Mack spokesman declined to comment beyond
the joint statement with Renault. Officials at Renault, based
in Paris, couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Navistar confirmed that it had made the overture and said
it will need to make a comprehensive due-diligence
examination of Mack "to determine whether to make a firm
offer and a specific per-share price."</p>
<p>The Chicago-based truck and diesel-engine maker declined
to elaborate on its possible interest in financially strapped
Mack.</p>
<p>Mack's board, four of whose nine members are Renault
officials, hasn't responded to Renault's offer. Renault has
said it wants to take full ownership of the company because
of Mack's deteriorating condition and the need to refinance
its debt.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mack, which still faces a sagging market for
its heavy-duty trucks, reported that it had a loss of $63.3
million, or $2.13 a share, in the second quarter on sales of
$400.9 million. In national over-the-counter trading, Mack
common closed unchanged at $7.125. The Mack statement came
out after the market closed.</p>
<p>Like Mack, Navistar has seen sales and earnings suffer
from a deep industry slump. In its first quarter, ended Jan.
31, it had a loss of $18 million, or 10 cents a share;
second-quarter earnings were down 77% at $8 million, or one
cent a share. Its six-month sales were off 11% at $1.81
billion.</p>
