	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Western Union Corp., fighting to avoid
bankruptcy-law proceedings, has come up with a new debt
recapitalization plan that most of its largest bondholders
have accepted.
   The company, which has been in default on a $51 million
interest payment since June 15, said it will file shortly
with the Securities and Exchange Commission an amendment to
its recapitalization plan that should keep it out of
Bankruptcy Court and placate its bondholders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I believe holders of more than half the bonds --
including four of the five largest holders -- have indicated
agreement to it," said Hal Kennedy, senior vice president of
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. and an adviser
to the bondholders. Western Union has said that the success
of its recapitalization depends on acceptance by holders of
95% of the bonds.</p>
<p>"We favor this new deal because we believe it will permit
the market value of the bonds to approximate their intrinsic
value," said Jay Goldsmith, president of Balfour Investors
Inc., a private investment company specializing in distressed
securities.</p>
<p>New York financier Bennett S. LeBow, who controls Western
Union through his Brooke Partners L.P., will remain Western
Union's principal owner, but his voting power will be cut to
29.6% from 46.4%.</p>
<p>After the sale of its Business Services unit, which
provides telex, electronic mail and Mailgram service, Western
Union will be primarily a financial services business. That
business, which includes money transfer, voice-messaging,
telegram and bill-payment services, posted an operating
profit of $95 million on sales of $309 million in 1989.</p>
<p>Under the new plan, Western Union will offer to increase
the interest rate on one of its new notes to 9.5% from 8%,
accelerate some interest payments, and boost to $160 million
from $145 million the amount of cash it will commit to redeem
its notes. Proceeds for this repurchasing plan is coming from
the sale of the company's Business Services unit to American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. for $180 million.</p>
<p>Western Union has also revised the formula for issuing new
common shares in the exchange offer that will give
noteholders 99.8 million new common shares or 25.1% of its
equity and voting power.</p>
<p>Under the latest plan, in exchange for each $1,000 face
value of 19.25% senior reset note and 16% note, Western Union
is proposing to issue a new $450, 13% note, due Sept. 14,
1992, and a new $550 secondpriority note paying 9.5%
interest, due Dec. 31, 1995, along with 200 common shares,
225 Class C common shares and 275 Class D common shares.</p>
<p>Interest on the 13% notes would accrue from Dec. 16, 1989,
and be payable semiannually in the form of additional new
notes, rather than cash, through June 30, 1991. In the latest
revision, Western Union said it would begin payments in cash
on the 9.5% second-priority notes beginning with the
semiannual interest payment on Dec. 31, 1993, rather than
June 30, 1994, as earlier planned.</p>
<p>Western Union's current senior reset notes are trading at
45 cents on the dollar or $450 for each $1,000 note. Its
annual interest payments total $116 million on $643 million
in debt.</p>
