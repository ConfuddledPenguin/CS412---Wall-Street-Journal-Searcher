York Stock Exchange volume, or 13.6 million shares a day, in
the week ended July 6.
   That was down from 13.7% the previous week, the Big Board

strategies.</p>

shares), Morgan Stanley Group Inc. (8.2 million), Merrill
Lynch & Co. (6.1 million), Salomon Inc.'s Salomon Brothers

with offsetting trades in futures and options.</p>
