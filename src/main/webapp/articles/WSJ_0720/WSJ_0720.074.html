	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Primerica Corp. reported second-quarter
earnings climbed 53% on 11% higher revenue, led by the
consumer finance operations, where profit rose 29% on a
revenue increase of 37%.
   The financial-services company's net income reached $96.9
million, or 84 cents a share, from $63.4 million, or 65 cents
a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue advanced to
$1.55 billion, from $1.40 billion. Shares outstanding grew
19%, to 117.9 million, as Primerica issued stock to buy the
30.2% minority interest in its A.L. Williams insurance
subsidiary.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The range of estimates had been 75 to 82 cents" a share,
so the quarter "clearly was better than expected," said
Allerton Cushman Jr., analyst at Morgan Stanley & Co.</p>
<p>Primerica's latest results reflect gains of $9.7 million
from the sale of 6.3 million shares of its Fingerhut Cos.
subsidiary in a May initial public offering, and $2.6 million
from the sale of part of its investment in reinsurer
Transatlantic Holdings Inc., which also completed its first
public offering during the quarter. The bottom line also
includes $11.1 million of losses in Primerica's investment
portfolios.</p>
<p>"The only place where earnings came in below target," Mr.
Cushman said, was in specialty life and health insurance,
which posted a 27% drop. The segment, which includes auto
insurance, was hurt by weakness in the auto industry and by a
higher tax rate; it also faced comparison with a strong
year-earlier period. Primerica has been examining the cost
structure and taking other restructuring measures at the
segment, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Traders worried, however, about an inquiry by the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Jacksonville, Fla., into life-insurance
sales practices at A.L. Williams. Primerica's shares fell
$1.625, to close at $34.625 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.</p>
