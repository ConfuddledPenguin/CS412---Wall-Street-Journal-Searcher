	<p class="article-leader">Chrysler Corp., Highland Park, Mich., clarifying comments
made Wednesday by a top executive, said that it expects to
post second-quarter results in line with analysts'
expectations, and that it expects "a substantial loss in the
third quarter."
   In comments at a press luncheon, Robert A. Lutz, president
of the company's Chrysler Motors unit, had said analysts
expecting the company to report earnings of about 78 cents a
share for the second quarter would be "pleasantly surprised."
Chrysler expects to release its second-quarter results by the
end of this month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Lutz also said the third quarter won't be "a terrible
bath" for the No. 3 U.S. auto maker. Chrysler will lose
production of its profitable minivans in the third quarter
because plants building the vehicles will close temporarily
to retool for the redesigned 1991 models.</p>
