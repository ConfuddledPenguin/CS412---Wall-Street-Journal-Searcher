	<p class="article-leader">The religious makeup of the American population is
changing -- slowly but discernibly. By the year 2000, the
U.S. will be a far more pluralistic country than anyone would
have imagined in 1950 -- and vastly more pluralistic than it
was in 1783, when Yale President Ezra Stiles pictured a
future America divided about equally among
Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians.
   The big story is the continuing, long-time decline of the
Protestant majority, to 57% in 1987 from 67% in 1952. At the
present rate of decline, Protestants will be barely a
numerical majority of the American population by the year
2000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Not all Protestant denominations are declining equally
fast. Since the middle-1960s, Methodists have declined to 9%
from 14%, Lutherans to 6% from 7%, Presbyterians to 3% from
6% and Episcopalians to 2% from 3%. Mainline Protestant
losses have been largely among the young who have either
turned to other faiths, or simply dropped out of religious
institutions entirely.</p>
<p>The only large Protestant denomination to remain stable is
the Baptists, due mainly to the staying power of the
evangelicals and fundamentalists within the ranks of the
Southern Baptists. Along with Southern Baptists, other
conservative Protestant groups, such as the Assemblies of
God, the Seventh-Day Adventists and various Pentecostal and
holiness groups, continue to flourish. Three in 10 Americans
are evangelicals, or born-again Christians. Enthusiasm,
certainty of belief, moral passion, and institutional
commitment -- all are attributes that engender evangelical
growth and vitality. But not to be overlooked are the
demographics.</p>
<p>Conservative Protestants hold on to their young much
better than mainline Protestants. Young conservative
Protestants are less likely to quit their parents' faith;
perhaps most important of all, conservative Protestants have
more young in the first place -- birth rates for evangelicals
and fundamentalists are significantly higher than for more
liberal Protestants.</p>
<p>The mainline churches are also having trouble maintaining
their distinctiveness. Denominational lines are blurring
among them, while distinctions among the conservatives --
such as evangelical, fundamentalist, holiness, Pentecostal
and charismatic -- have taken on new meaning.</p>
<p>Roman Catholicism has grown in almost the same proportion
as Protestantism has declined: to 28% of the nation's
population from 25% over the past 30 years. Historically,
Catholics have had a higher birth rate than Protestants, but
the gap has narrowed in recent decades. A more important
factor accounting for Catholic growth is the immigration of
Hispanics, who make up 17% of all American Catholics. Because
Hispanics have a higher birth rate than other Catholics, we
can expect their presence within American Catholicism to
become even larger. But Hispanics are also being recruited
into Protestantism, especially evangelical Protestantism, in
record numbers: 18% of Hispanics now belong to Protestant
denominations.</p>
<p>Jews as a proportion of the American population have
declined since mid-century -- to 2% from 4%. This shift
largely is a result of two factors: a low birth rate and a
high rate of interfaith marriage. The Jewish proportion has
held steady at 2% since the early 1970s, which may indicate a
stable pattern for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Two groupings have grown more rapidly over the past 40
years than any others: "other religions" and the
disaffiliated. "Other religions" include a broad array of
groups, some that have long been present on the American
scene, such as the Greek and Russian Orthodox, who have
dwindled as a proportion of the total population from 2% in
1950 to less than 1% today. Other groups that have long been
present have grown enormously since World War II, such as the
Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses.</p>
<p>Perhaps the fastest-growing religious faith, though, is
Islam. There are now roughly as many Moslems in the U.S. as
there are Episcopalians. There are also large numbers of
Buddhists in America's cities, especially Los Angeles, as a
result of heavy emigration from Asia in the past two decades.
Hundreds of religious and spiritual groups new to the
American scene have emerged: Eastern mystical faiths, with an
emphasis on meditation and reincarnation as well as groups
drawing upon a wide assortment of older, more primitive
traditions recast in new form, such as nature religions,
Native American practices, theosophical beliefs, goddess
worship and other New Age spiritualities. Today 4% of the
population claims a religion outside the major traditions. In
the 1950s, only 1% did.</p>
<p>The religiously nonaffiliated have grown to 9% today from
2% in the early 1950s. As their numbers have increased, their
cultural characteristics have changed: No longer a small
marginal group of atheists and social dissidents,
nonaffiliates today are predominately young, white,
well-educated and socially mobile.</p>
<p>Many within this group have dropped out from the mainline
Protestant and Catholic churches. They are perhaps better
described as privately religious than as irreligious or
anti-religious. The rise of this sector points not only to a
growing secular constituency but also to the greater ease
generally with which Americans move in and out of religious
affiliations.</p>
<p>In the next decade, we can expect an increasingly
pluralistic religious environment. The great divide between
religious liberals and religious conservatives within major
religious communities will persist and maybe even intensify
over issues such as abortion.</p>
<p>We can expect the boundaries of "conventional" religion to
continue to expand: Faiths once thought of as foreign, such
as Buddhism and Islam, will take their place in the canopy of
American religious pluralism.</p>
<p>We can also expect greater religious voluntarism: People
will pick and choose beliefs and practices from the various
religions, creating their own synthesized versions, making
for more personal, individualistic styles of faith.</p>
