	<p class="article-leader">Sarah Flores's American dream may be shattered next week
in a federal courtroom. Starting as a secretary, she worked
her way up to a top post in county government. Now she is
favored to win a November runoff and become the first
Hispanic or woman ever elected to the powerful Los Angeles
County Board of Supervisors.
   But federal Judge David Kenyon is likely to cancel that
election to, remarkably, correct discrimination against
Hispanics. The day before her first-place finish last month,
Judge Kenyon struck down the existing districts, saying "an
Hispanic candidate is unable to be elected to the board"
under them. He ordered the board to create an
Hispanic-majority district, and indicated he would cancel the
November vote and call a new one. In response to his
anti-gerrymandering order, the supervisors have concocted the
district pictured alongside.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The problem, of course, is that while Mrs. Flores is a
longtime Hispanic activist, she is also a Republican. The
fact that she won 68% of the Hispanic vote last month is
ignored by those who want to cancel the fall vote and draw a
new Hispanic seat. The battle over the Flores seat has less
to do with discrimination than it does with pure politics.
Since 1980, the Board of Supervisors has had a 3-to-2
conservative majority, and the lawsuit before Judge Kenyon is
intended to reverse this.</p>
<p>The local ACLU chapter and the Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEV), sued in 1988 -- seven
years after the lines were drawn -- claiming they
discriminated against Hispanics. By the trial date, two of
the five districts were 47% Hispanic and Mrs. Flores was the
leading candidate in one of them. But, as a Republican, she
was unacceptable to liberal activists who want control of the
board. They want to end her career before she becomes a role
model for other Hispanics who want to escape from the Liberal
Barrio.</p>
<p>Under court order, the Board of Supervisors created a 74%
Hispanic-majority district, an octupus-shaped creature that
has tentacles reaching out to scoop up Hispanic voters.
Liberal groups don't object to the district's bizarre
contours, but to the fact that the Hispanic seat includes the
home of a liberal Anglo supervisor. An Hispanic could defeat
him, but that would not shift the board's ideological makeup.</p>
<p>MALDEV has submitted two plans that create a 71%
Hispanic-majority seat and have boundaries almost as
torturous. But they both exclude Mrs. Flores's home and
political base, making it unlikely that she could win. Mrs.
Flores opposes both the board and MALDEV plans and has asked
Judge Kenyon to let this fall's election proceed under the
old lines.</p>
<p>Next year, she wants a new plan drawn using the new 1990
Census data and expanding the board to seven members. ACLU
attorneys oppose this, saying Mrs. Flores ignored warnings
not to take her case to the voters while their lawsuit was in
court, and that her interests are secondary to those of the
Hispanic community.</p>
<p>But which community? The Hispanic voters who back Mrs.
Flores, or the liberal activists who pretend to speak for
them? The liberal groups insist the first Hispanic supervisor
be drawn from their ranks. Until that happens, the 70,000
voters who want Sarah Flores to represent them will have
their votes thrown out.</p>
<p>The Flores case is the opening round in what will be a
series of bitter struggles next year over the redrawing of
thousands of congressional, state legislative and
supervisorial districts. Both political parties want to use
the expanded Voting Rights Act to redraw the country along
ethnic and racial lines. Republicans, for instance, want to
help black legislators craft majority-black districts that
will make it easier for the GOP to win suburban seats.</p>
<p>Back in 1982, when the Voting Rights Act provisions that
practically mandate racial gerrymandering were passed, we
doubted they would serve American democracy any better than
the Jim Crow districts of a previous era. Districts should be
drawn to keep communities of interest largely intact and to
give voters real choices.</p>
<p>Surely it is bizarre for judges to cancel the election of
minorities on the grounds of discrimination. This has to
mean, as in the Flores case, that the real issue is politics.
The rights of minorities are not advanced by frustrating the
will of minority voters.</p>
