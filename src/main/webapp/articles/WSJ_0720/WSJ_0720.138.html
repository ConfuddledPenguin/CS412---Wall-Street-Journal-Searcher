	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- BankAmerica Corp., continuing its
rebound, posted relatively good earnings and strong
improvements in its asset quality for its second quarter.
   Net income for the quarter was $267 million, or $1.17 a
share, compared with year-ago earnings of $304 million, or
$1.50 a share. However, analysts consider the current results
to be a slight improvement over year-ago figures, which were
lifted by $44 million from cash interest payments made by
Brazilian borrowers. BankAmerica received no such payments
from Brazil this quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the results were in line with expectations, analysts
were pleased with what were described as "significant"
progress in reducing the amount of nonperforming assets.</p>
<p>"They had across-the-board, significant improvements in
that area," said J. Richard Fredericks, an analyst at
Montgomery Securities Inc.</p>
<p>The bank holding company said that during the quarter, it
reduced its nonaccrual assets by 21%, to $3.1 billion.
Nonaccrual assets related to restructuring countries fell
even more -- to $2.2 billion, from $3 billion.</p>
<p>BankAmerica also reported a 21.5% reduction in the amount
of domestic real-estate loans on nonaccrual status. "You have
all these nervous nellies back East talking about the
California real-estate market slumping, and here
(BankAmerica) is reporting improvements," said Michael
Abrahams, an analyst at Bateman Eichler Hill Richards in Los
Angeles.</p>
