	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The U.S. Attorney in Jacksonville, Fla., is
conducting an inquiry into the practices of "a small number"
of sales representatives at a unit of insurer A.L. Williams,
said Primerica Corp., the insurer's parent.
   The practices relate to a dispute that Primerica, a
financial-services company based here, has been litigating
for some time with Amerishare Investors Inc., a Jacksonville
insurance and mutual-fund company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Primerica said the U.S. Attorney apparently is looking
into whether the sales forces at A.L. Williams and Amerishare
made improper efforts to obtain data about or interfere with
each other's business.</p>
<p>Arthur L. Williams Jr., the subsidiary's founder and owner
until Primerica acquired it last November, has requested a
leave of absence from his post as a sales consultant to help
resolve the matter, Primerica said.</p>
<p>Consumers and A.L. Williams policyholders haven't been
affected by the practices the U.S. Attorney is reviewing,
Primerica said, adding that its subsidiary won't likely be
exposed to material financial liability.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney's Office in Jacksonville wouldn't
comment. An attorney for Amerishare said, "I am not aware of
any investigation into conduct by Amerishare."</p>
