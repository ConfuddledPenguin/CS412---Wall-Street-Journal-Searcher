	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A legal dispute involving hundreds of
millions of dollars in art, a museum funded by shareholders,
and a battle with his late wife's estate is all a mistake,
said Armand Hammer, chairman and chief executive officer of
Occidental Petroleum Corp.
   In an interview, the 92-year-old executive said his wife,
Frances Tolman Hammer, intended before her death in December
to clarify an apparent contradiction involving community
property and the art collection valued by some at as much as
$400 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I think it was just a question that she overlooked this,"
Dr. Hammer said. In other remarks, Occidental's chief
executive said for the first time that his early investments
in the company's drilling were made with loans from his wife.</p>
<p>The late Mrs. Hammer's will leaves open the possibility
that her estate retains rights to much of the art collection
now being donated by Dr. Hammer to a new museum that will
bear his name and that is being built by Occidental.</p>
<p>A $400 million lawsuit filed last week by the executor of
Mrs. Hammer's estate has challenged ownership of the art and
other assets, saying that the estate is entitled to part of
their value under community property laws. Dr. Hammer and his
attorneys have countered that Mrs. Hammer, on at least three
occasions in nearly 15 years, rejected any claim to the art
collection.</p>
<p>Dr. Hammer appeared tanned and fit amid the outbreak of
family feuding. Dressed in a blue, pin-striped suit, blue tie
and with a tiny, red French Legion of Honor pin stuck in his
lapel, he discussed wealth, wills and lawyers.</p>
<p>In his ruminations, the nonagenarian executive turned back
to the 1950's, when he courted his wife and they invested in
oil drilling that led to his control of Occidental, the Los
Angeles-based oil, chemical, pipeline and
agricultural-product concern with which he is identified. His
recollections were somewhat at odds with his tale as told in
"Hammer," his autobiography that was published in 1987.</p>
<p>In his book, Dr. Hammer wrote that he fled a tangled
divorce proceeding from his second wife. The new Mrs.
Hammer's long-dead first husband "had left Frances with a
substantial fortune, and, together with my millions, we had
far more money than we would ever need or want to spend," he
wrote, adding that he was ready for quiet retirement.</p>
<p>But instead of the idyllic merger of two equally wealthy
senior citizens of his autobiography, Dr. Hammer sketched a
different tie to the wealthy widow who became his third wife
in 1956.</p>
<p>"When I married Mrs. Hammer and moved out {to Los Angeles
from New Jersey}, I was strapped for cash," Dr. Hammer
recalled. Despite his recent sale of about $7.5 million of
assets, "I had a lot of debts and most of my cash went to
cover those debts."</p>
<p>Short of investment funds, he borrowed from his wife.
"Mrs. Hammer offered to make loans to me, which I was happy
to accept," Dr. Hammer recounted. Luck was with the new Mr.
and Mrs. Hammer. The money Dr. Hammer insisted was spent on
oil drilling for a tax break turned up a series of gushers
and the second-largest natural gas field discovered in
California. Investment in tiny Occidental, a nearly moribund
concern that did the drilling with the Hammers as partners,
soon followed.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit filed by Robert S. Weiss, as
executor of Mrs. Hammer's estate, Dr. Hammer borrowed more
than $300,000 from his wife at an interest rate of 2%. The
loans remained outstanding for nearly two decades at that
rate, the suit alleges, arguing that Dr. Hammer's personal
fortune was built on borrowings from his wife and cannot be
separated.</p>
<p>Dr. Hammer, with his attorney, maintained that these were
commercial transactions very much apart from matrimonial
money-handling. Dr. Hammer also contends that he boosted Mrs.
Hammer's net worth from $3 million when he married her to $15
million at her death.</p>
<p>The late Mrs. Hammer wrote two wills, Dr. Hammer said --
one around 1970, which bequeathed all her assets first to
him, and then, should he have predeceased her, to other
members of her family. The second will was written in 1988 by
Mary Creutz, a Los Angeles lawyer who Dr. Hammer said was
engaged by Robert Weiss and his wife, Joan Weiss, who became
respectively Mrs. Hammer's executor and sole beneficiary
under the new will. Joan Weiss is the late Mrs. Hammer's
niece.</p>
<p>Dr. Hammer said he believes that his wife made Mrs. Weiss
the sole beneficiary of her estate because Mrs. Hammer was
"very fond" of Mrs. Weiss's two sons. "That's why, I think,
she agreed to sign a new will," he said.</p>
<p>The new will contains a clause that Mrs. Hammer retained
her rights to the Hammers' community property. However, said
Dr. Hammer, Mrs. Hammer then sent the will to the Chicago
lawyers who had represented both of them in personal matters
for decades. A partner in the Chicago firm of Lewis, Overbeck
& Furman then told Mrs. Hammer that there was a conflict
between the new will and Mrs. Hammer's previous refutation of
community property claims to the Hammer art collection.</p>
<p>"So then, Mrs. Hammer realized that she had made a
mistake," her husband said.</p>
<p>Richard Cleary, an attorney for the Weisses in the
litigation disputed suggestions that the late Mrs. Hammer
intended to refute or change part of her will. "The will has
been admitted to probate, and no one, including Dr. Hammer,
has questioned that." Mr. Cleary added that those on the
Weisses side "believe that the will accurately represents
Mrs. Hammer's desires as to how her property should be
distributed at her death."</p>
