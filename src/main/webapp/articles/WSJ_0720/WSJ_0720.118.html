	<div class="article-body"><p>The company noted that second-quarter net rose 56%
excluding $35 million of extraordinary and unusual gains from
a year earlier.</p>

prices, "world-wide oil-field activity continued to increase
as the oil industry remained focused on developing reserves
for the future." He said revenue from oil-field activity rose
21% while the drilling rig count world-wide rose 11%.</p>
<p>First-half net rose 30% to $273.3 million, or $1.15 a
