	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Alan Bond will sacrifice himself in an effort to
save his ailing empire.
   The feisty Australian entrepreneur said he would quit as
chairman of his flagship Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd., in
exchange for investors' support for actions crucial to the
survival of the troubled Australian company. Mr. Bond also
agreed to end his control of Bond Corp.'s board, appoint a
new chief executive and create a bondholders' committee, said
Peter Lucas, a director.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bond will step down after the investors approve the
critical decisions at a meeting Aug. 9, Mr. Lucas said at a
news conference here yesterday, following a meeting of the
investors. These bondholders have been asked to clear the
proposed sale of Bond Corp.'s breweries to its 58%-controlled
Bell Resources Ltd. unit, and to decide whether to waive
about 25 million Australian dollars (US$19.7 million) in
interest due on securities over the next year.</p>
<p>The investors yesterday postponed votes on both decisions
until Aug. 9 so Bond Corp. can seek wider support for the
proposed management restructuring. Some bondholders said a
vote yesterday would have blocked the actions, possibly
crippling Mr. Bond's effort to save his deeply indebted
empire of brewing, media, property and natural-resources
interests. He has been trying to reduce the hefty debt by
selling assets.</p>
<p>Mr. Bond's resignation marks a low point in his fortunes.
"I think it's a demonstration of the pretty desperate
situation he was in," said Douglas Newby, a mining analyst
for S.G. Warburg Securities in New York.</p>
<p>It isn't clear whether the Australian businessman's
departure will satisfy investors. But investors represented
at the meeting made it clear that his move was necessary,
said Brian Keelan, executive director of investment banking
at Swiss Bank Corp., which has a small holding of Bond Corp.
bonds. "The feeling is that if an appropriately forceful and
independent chief executive can be found, the residual assets
may have a chance." The problem, the banker added, is that
"it may be more difficult to find someone to take on" the
chief executive's role.</p>
<p>Although Peter Beckwith is Bond Corp.'s chief executive at
present, Mr. Bond "was really very much in control" of the
company, Mr. Newby said.</p>
<p>The bondholders' committee being created probably will
seek a voice in selecting Bond Corp.'s new chief executive,
Mr. Keelan indicated. Despite the management shake-up, Mr.
Bond is expected to remain a member of Bond Corp.'s board,
Mr. Lucas said.</p>
<p>Mr. Bond's power over Bond Corp. will shrink because his
Dallhold Investments Pty. Ltd., which controls 58% of Bond
Corp.'s share capital, will limit its votes to 25% pending
the company's reconstruction. Under the restructuring plan,
Dallhold also will be limited to a minority of board members.
These changes, as well as Mr. Bond's resignation, are to
occur within 30 days of the investors' vote next month on the
breweries sale and interest moratorium.</p>
<p>Mr. Bond found it emotionally difficult to relinquish his
grip on a once far-flung empire that he amassed over many
years, Mr. Lucas told reporters. He added: "It's a lifetime's
work from which now . . . he is standing aside."</p>
<p>At yesterday's meeting, Mr. Keelan said, Mr. Bond's words
"included statements of regret and apology."</p>
<p>With cooperation from various investors -- including some
who weren't represented here yesterday -- a slimmed-down Bond
Corp. will survive, Mr. Lucas insisted. But "we won't be the
same organization."</p>
<p>To survive, however, Bond Corp. also must complete certain
other asset sales and overcome legal battles with a group of
U.S. debenture holders. Bond Corp. has tried to head off the
holders' efforts to liquidate its Bond Brewing Holdings Ltd.
unit by offering to buy this debt back at a deep discount.</p>
