	<p class="article-leader">In your June 12 page-one article "Uncharted Course" on the
controversy over teaching about homosexuality and AIDS in
high schools, curriculum director Elaine Lohr was quoted as
saying, "We are teaching about homosexuality, not teaching
students to become homosexuals."
   What irony. As a matter of plain, ordinary common sense, I
ask what is going to be the final result for a nation that
insists on teaching about homosexuality to its young people,
while at the same time forbids teaching in its schools, for
fear of proselytizing, very much of anything about 2,000
years of Christianity.</p>

<p>Your article leaves me certain that once again the facts
about how AIDS is transmitted will be whitewashed to suit the
demands of various pressure groups.</p>
<p>The classic example of this so far has been the alliance
of convenience between Christian fundamentalists (hoping to
scare everyone away from nonmarital sex) and gay activists
(trying to prevent public understanding of how gay male
behavior has spread AIDS) that has buffaloed the mass media
into blaming AIDS on vague euphemisms such as "unsafe sex." A
more courageous press would have clearly pointed out what the
two main (and interrelated) causes of AIDS among non-drug
users are: 1. Heavy promiscuity among gay males. 2. A high
proportion of their promiscuous couplings consists of anal
sex.</p>
<p>While the gay press has long told its readers the plain
truth about the danger of anal sex, the mass media's timidity
has undoubtedly led to women dying of AIDS because they never
had a chance to learn this fact. (Feminist groups deserve
censure as well for not making into a women's issue the
threat posed by anal sex, probably out of ideological
solidarity with gay groups.)</p>
<p>Sure, the media have trumpeted condoms as an all-purpose
talisman against AIDS, but we all know condoms' limitations.
AIDS is too deadly for AIDS education to emphasize only
condoms just to avoid offending organized lobbies.</p>

<p>I am constantly amazed at how those involved with the AIDS
issue regularly find someone or something else to blame for
the crisis. In your article, University of Minnesota
pediatrics professor Gary Remafedi says, "AIDS is a disease
that is all about racism, homophobia and discrimination."</p>
<p>Racism, homophobia and discrimination do exist, but they
did not cause, nor do they perpetuate, AIDS. AIDS is
primarily about unsafe sex being practiced by homosexuals and
bisexuals, and the sharing of unclean needles among drug
users.</p>
<p>Taking personal responsibility for one's own actions is
not popular in any segment of American society today, and
especially not in the homosexual community and among AIDS
activists. All of us must be caring and compassionate toward
those with AIDS, but with all the suffering that is
occurring, we ought not add truth to the list of casualties.</p>

<p>Why is there a crisis today in American public education?
One need look no further than your article describing San
Francisco's ninth-grade classtime devoted to talking about
what homosexuals do in bed. With such a display of moral and
intellectual bankruptcy being further endorsed by the
National Education Association, one may safely conclude that
public education now suffers from a terminal disease.</p>

<p>Project 10, mentioned in your article, is the nation's
first mainstream program that addresses the needs of
adolescent homosexuals. Its message is that unchallenged
discrimination will no longer be tolerated. That Project 10
has survived the attacks of professional homophobes and is
being replicated throughout the country speaks for the
desperate need for similar efforts.</p>
