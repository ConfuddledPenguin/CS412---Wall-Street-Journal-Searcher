	<p class="article-leader">AMSTERDAM -- Buhrmann-Tetterode N.V. is frustrated.
   The paper wholesaling, packaging and office supplies
company has remodeled itself over the past 18 months with 15
small to mid-sized acquisitions. It has sold most of its
laggardly operations and reduced its dependence on the Dutch
market to less than one-third of sales. Earnings per share
have grown an average of 31% annually over the past six
years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet many outsiders continue to view BT as a
run-of-the-mill paper manufacturer -- in fact, it doesn't
make paper but merely distributes it, mainly to printers --
and the company's shares trade at a pedestrian
price-to-earnings multiple.</p>
<p>"I don't think it's normal at all," says Robert van Oordt,
a former McKinsey & Co. consultant who became president of
the executive board Jan. 1. Mr. van Oordt acknowledges that a
low share price makes it hard to use BT equity to pay for
acquisitions, particularly outside the Netherlands. But he
says the stock market eventually will understand BT better
and accord it a higher rating.</p>
<p>Given BT's recent transformations and the highly
specialized nature of its businesses, it isn't surprising
that the market is somewhat confused.</p>
<p>The company was formed from the 1963 merger of a
distributor of printing equipment and a wholesaler of
printing paper, both of them about a century old. Since the
merger, BT has striven to reduce reliance on printing
equipment. Despite those efforts, the division that
distributes and services printing equipment, copiers and
other office machines accounted for 57% of 1989 operating
profit, which equaled $196 million, and 37% of BT's total
sales of $2.76 billion.</p>
<p>Although distributing Heidelberg, Linotype and other
printing equipment has long been highly profitable for BT,
Mr. van Oordt says it would be risky to remain so dependent
on that business.</p>
<p>BT's first round of diversification proved disappointing.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company moved into the
manufacture of packaging and the wholesaling of toys and
sporting goods. It also acquired two chains of bookstores and
dabbled in publishing.</p>
<p>The packaging business thrived, but the other initiatives
floundered. BT discovered it was much better at predicting
what kind of machinery printers would want than guessing
which toys would excite children. In the early 1980s, profit
plunged, hurt by a deep recession and the costs of closing a
factory in Belgium. Since then, BT has sold most of the
companies acquired in the initial round of diversification.</p>
<p>At the same time, it has expanded its packaging
operations, becoming a big producer of air-bubble envelopes,
foam and other protective packaging. It also makes display
boxes for vegetables and flowers and provides packaging for
such items as Pampers disposable diapers in Europe and the
U.S.</p>
<p>BT also has rapidly built up a network of office-supply
distributors in the U.S., the Netherlands and West Germany.
In the U.S., BT over the past three years has bought five
office-supply companies, including Summit Office Supply, a
major New York-based supplier. Mr. van Oordt says BT is
bringing its distribution skills to bear on a highly
fragmented market, ripe for consolidation. The company sells
directly to big offices in large volumes, bypassing
traditional office-supply stores.</p>
<p>BT also is broadening the geographical spread of its
traditional businesses. In April, it bought Robert Horne
Group PLC, a British paper wholesaler, for $281 million. That
purchase raised a few eyebrows: Herman van Everdingen, an
analyst at Van Meer James Capel N.V., calls the price
"ridiculously high" at 16 times Horne's 1989 earnings. The
purchase also raised BT's debt to about 96% of equity.</p>
<p>But Mr. van Oordt argues that BT needs greater bulk in
paper wholesaling to maintain its purchasing power with the
huge paper makers being created by a wave of mergers in that
industry.</p>
<p>Last year, BT created a stir by snapping up about 51% of
the non-voting share certificates of Ahrend Groep N.V., an
Amsterdam-based office furniture and supplies company.
Friendly mergers are still the rule in the Netherlands, and
BT's strong-arm attempt to push Ahrend into a deal provoked
an angry reaction. "They have nothing to offer to Ahrend, and
they know that," says Hans Koenders, Ahrend's chairman.</p>
<p>Even so, Mr. van Oordt stresses that he is on good terms
with Mr. Koenders and predicts the standoff will be resolved
before year's end. Some analysts expect BT to give up and
sell its Ahrend stake; Mr. van Oordt says he still hopes for
a merger.</p>
