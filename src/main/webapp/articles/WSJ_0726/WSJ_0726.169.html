	<p class="article-leader">The sharp drop in stock prices Friday afternoon and Monday
morning may have scared a lot of investors, but not most Wall
Street strategists.
   They're more bullish than they were just three months ago,
when the Dow Jones Industrial Average was some 250 points
lower.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Eight of the 10 big brokerage firms in a continuing study
by The Wall Street Journal and Wilshire Associates recommend
that investors keep 50% or more of their portfolios in
stocks. Only four of the 10 firms were that high on stocks at
the start of the second quarter.</p>
<p>Kidder, Peabody & Co. actually raised its recommended
exposure to both stocks and bonds Monday as a result of the
sell-off. Until last week, the General Electric Co. unit had
recommended that investors keep 35% of their money in safe,
short-term investments such as Treasury bills and other cash
equivalents. Now it has slashed cash to 20%, raising stocks
to 50% and bonds to 30%.</p>
<p>Kidder is the leader for the past 12 months in the
Journal-Wilshire study, which attempts to gauge how investors
would do if they followed brokerage houses' asset-allocation
advice. Asset allocation is the art of carving up the
investment pie, suggesting how big a slice investors should
take of stocks, bonds, cash and other investments. For the 12
months through June, investors who followed Kidder's
allocation advice would have had an estimated gain of 13.7%.</p>
<p>Kidder strategist Stefan Abrams thinks the stock-market
slide that began last week has ended -- or will end within a
few days. He expects prices to head gradually higher, led by
growth stocks with dependable earnings. He also expects
moderate gains in bonds, with long-term interest rates
dropping to 8% by year end.</p>
<p>Dean Witter Reynolds Securities Inc., the short-term
winner with an estimated second-quarter gain of 5.9%, isn't
the least bit cowed by the recent market slide. The Sears,
Roebuck & Co. unit is sticking with its recommended 85%
allocation to stocks.</p>
<p>"Inflation is subpar, inflation is going down," says
strategist John Connolly. He expects interest rates to
decline and stock prices to rise relative to per-share
earnings. "If we were to have a big budget deal, all this
would happen even sooner."</p>
<p>Greg Smith, strategist at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., is more cautious. For the full 42 months the study
covers, his firm, a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America, is the leader with an estimated return of 63.1%.</p>
<p>Now "nervous" is the word he uses to describe his view of
the market. "My modest optimism on this year has been
predicated on the idea that at some point we're going to get
a drop in interest rates," an expectation he's starting to
doubt.</p>
<p>Still, he thinks stocks and bonds will slightly outperform
cash for the year, and he recommends that investors keep 55%
of their portfolios in stocks. He's betting the Federal
Reserve Board "will put the priority on fighting a
recession." That would mean at least some decline in
short-term rates, helping bonds a little, stocks a bit more.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown on the other seven brokerage houses in
the study, listed in order of 12-month performance.</p>
<p>SHEARSON LEHMAN: Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. has been the
most consistent performer in the study, ranking second for
all three time periods. Michael Sherman, strategist at the
American Express Co. unit, hasn't changed his recommended
blend (65% stocks, 30% bonds, 5% cash) since late March. In
his opinion, the Dow Jones Industrial Average can hit 3300
this year if the right kind of deficit-reduction agreement is
struck. The deal would have to provide for slicing the
deficit by $50 billion, and restore favorable tax treatment
for capital gains. Mr. Sherman believes that will happen. But
if it doesn't, he thinks stocks and bonds could be in for
rough sledding.</p>
<p>RAYMOND JAMES: Fourth for the 12 months, after Pru-Bache,
Raymond James & Associates recently cut its stock allocation
to 50%. It is worried that the market's advance in the past
couple of months wasn't broad-based, and that consumer
spending is weakening. The St. Petersburg, Fla.-based firm,
never a big fan of bonds, especially dislikes them now
because it thinks the bond markets have already anticipated
easing by the Fed and a deficit-reduction agreement.</p>
<p>Raymond James is the only firm among the 10 that advises
clients to put some of their portfolios in real estate
(currently 15%). That's a soft market nationwide, but J.
Davenport Mosby, a managing director, says real estate in the
Southeast is "performing very well."</p>
<p>PAINEWEBBER: Edward Kerschner, strategist at PaineWebber
Inc., calls it the "market mambo": Stocks step forward for
two months, then back in the month when corporate earnings
are announced -- October, January, April and now July. But
Mr. Kerschner believes that "we're past the worst of the
earnings comparisons." Starting in the third quarter, he
predicts, many companies will show quarterly earnings above
those of 12 months earlier. He thinks the Dow Jones
industrials could reach 3200 to 3500 within 18 months, given
a budget-deficit pact, some further interest-rate easing and
those improved profit comparisons.</p>
<p>SMITH BARNEY: Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. ranks near
the middle for all periods. William Helman, strategist at the
Primerica Corp. unit, usually advocates a middle-of-the-road
blend (currently 50% in stocks and 35% in bonds). If a
successful deficit-cutting deal is achieved, he thinks stocks
could rise about 10%, and bonds could also rise a bit. He
doesn't see big gains in bonds, however, unless a recession
hits. As for stocks, "performance has been quite mixed and
narrow" he says, with a mere 14 stocks accounting for the
entire gain in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index
year-to-date. "We've been recommending technology and
energy."</p>
<p>GOLDMAN SACHS: Eighth for the 12 months, after Dean
Witter, Goldman Sachs & Co. is recommending that investors
keep only 35% of their portfolios in stocks. That is the
smallest stock allocation among the 10 firms. Strategist
Steven Einhorn says he doesn't see a big risk in stocks, but
thinks they may decline 5% to 10% over the next few months as
investors get "frustrated" when interest rates fail to
decline. Bonds, he thinks, will neither rise nor fall, but
the interest on them will outpace cash. He is telling
investors to put 55% of their money in bonds, the highest
bond allocation in the group. "Bonds look the best to me
because the stock market has already embedded in its price a
much lower bond yield," he says.</p>
<p>MERRILL LYNCH: Merrill Lynch & Co. ranked ninth for the 12
months and last for the second quarter, mostly because it
liked bonds, which underperformed. But strategist Charles
Clough thinks his balanced blend (currently 50% stocks, 45%
bonds) is on the right track. "It is very unusual for bonds
and stocks to diverge so strongly, when earnings are
decelerating," he says. At this point, he notes, the Dow
Jones Industrial Average would have to get to about 3200 just
to provide a return equal to the interest provided by bonds.
For the stock portion of holdings, he suggests smaller
stocks, which he thinks are due to play catch-up with their
larger brethren.</p>
<p>A.G. EDWARDS: Last-place A.G. Edwards & Sons recommends
that investors keep only 40% of their portfolios in stocks.
That is unchanged from three months ago. Raymond Worseck,
strategist at the St. Louis-based firm, predicts prices will
vacillate near or slightly below current levels. But the firm
has raised its recommended cash level to 25%, while cutting
its recommended bond allocation to 35% from 45% last quarter.
It foresees a rise in long-term interest rates, to 9% or more
by year end. Mr. Worseck thinks a battle over a new Supreme
Court nominee could undermine support for President Bush and
"damage the budget process."</p>
