	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady called for
broadening the businesses that banks can engage in, but added
that they should have to meet strict capital standards so
that deregulation doesn't foster the reckless practices that
created the thrift debacle.
   Mr. Brady, in testimony before the Senate Banking
Committee, said the Treasury is worried that banks'
profitability is being hurt by restrictions that prevent them
from fully entering the securities and insurance business,
and from opening branches throughout the U.S. Many of the
banks' best customers, "including blue-chip corporations, now
borrow directly from investors" through short-term debt
securities, Mr. Brady said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The result has been concentration in the riskiest lines
of permitted business, such as commercial real estate
lending, highly leveraged transactions, and loans to lesser
developed countries," the Treasury secretary said. He added
that the limitations are creating "greater risk to the system
and the taxpayer, not less."</p>
<p>Mr. Brady's comments were the opening salvo in a
controversial attempt to expand bank powers. The Treasury is
preparing proposals to restructure the banking industry and
the deposit-insurance system and expects to announce them by
early next year. But amid the savings-and-loan bailout,
expected to cost the government up to $500 billion with
interest, many members of Congress are wary of giving banks
more powers.</p>
<p>But Mr. Brady, echoing the view of many banking experts,
said lack of capital was the culprit in the S&L mess, not the
deregulation of the industry in the early 1980s. Capital
represents the investment of a bank's or thrift's owners that
is drained off before federal deposit insurance is called in.
Though he didn't specifically call for higher capital
requirements, Mr. Brady suggested that broader powers should
be given only to well-capitalized institutions.</p>
<p>"I can't imagine recommending any changes in the banking
law that wouldn't put a very high premium on capital," he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Brady was less specific about the Treasury's proposals
to change deposit insurance, but appeared to be leaning
toward recommending that the $100,000 insurance limit on
deposits remain in place. "We've got to take a very hard look
at that problem," he said. "But frankly, I can't see at this
particular point in time a rush to lower that amount of
insurance when we have a question of confidence not only in
our banks, but obviously in our thrifts."</p>
<p>Asked by Sen. Alan Dixon, (D., Ill.) about limiting
deposit insurance to one account per person, a very popular
idea on Capitol Hill these days, Mr. Brady said, "Well, if
you were going to start anyplace, that would be a place to
start."</p>
<p>Commenting on recent statements by William Seidman, head
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., that the FDIC's
bank-insurance fund is "under stress," Mr. Brady emphasized
"the qualification" Mr. Seidman made: that it would take a
severe recession before taxpayer dollars would be required to
back up the bank fund. "We can't make all our economic
judgments" as if a big recession is in the offing, the
Treasury secretary said.</p>
<p>"The point is to stay out of a severe recession, which I
think we will do," he added. Mr. Brady also rejected
suggestions by some private analysts that the banking
industry is currently harboring problems that could grow to
the size of the S&L crisis in a few years. "To compare the
banking system to the S&Ls in 1988 is a comparison I don't
think should be made," he said.</p>
