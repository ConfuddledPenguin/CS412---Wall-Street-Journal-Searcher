	<p class="article-leader">COATESVILLE, Pa. -- Lukens Inc. said it amended its
shareholder rights plan to lower the trigger point.
   Under the revised plan, holders would have a right to buy
the common of Lukens or of an acquiring company at half the
market price if a hostile purchaser obtains 20% of Lukens's
common, rather than the previous 30%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The trigger could be lowered to 10% if the board decides
that a purchaser is an "adverse person," with interests
contrary to those of Lukens and its shareholders.</p>
<p>The steel products company said the changes weren't made
in response to any known effort to take over Lukens.</p>
