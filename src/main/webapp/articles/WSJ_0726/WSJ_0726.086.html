	<p class="article-leader">Please measure your CI index right now. You may be
courting disaster. In "Outsmarting the Competition"
(Sourcebooks, 388 pages, $17.95), John McGonagle Jr. and
Carolyn Vella say that if you aren't continually trying to
find out what your competition is doing, you are failing in
"competitive intelligence," or CI.
   The authors define CI as "the use of public sources to
develop information about the competition, competitors and
market environment." Public information, they remind us, goes
much beyond what you can find in this newspaper or what the
U.S. Department of Commerce releases. It includes a document
released by a competitor as part of a lawsuit, as well as a
competitor's press release describing the marketing strategy
for a new product.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If you can answer any of the five questions listed below
you already are using some CI: Can I name five of my major
competitors? Can I name their major products or services?
What will they be doing in the next six months? Who is doing
my job at each competing firm? What is he or she doing now?</p>
<p>The book gives several examples of how CI has paid off,
citing for instance an alert CEO of an office-equipment
supplier who learned in a conversation with a retailer that a
competitor had just raised prices on a product line. He
immediately faxed this information to his sales force, who
capitalized on it within a day.</p>
<p>Without doubt the book's most useful attribute is its list
of sources of public information, some of which are not so
obvious: CompuServe, Investext, Mead Data Central, Dialog
Information Services.</p>

<p>Richard Pascale, a management consultant, argues in his
book "Managing on the Edge" (Simon & Schuster, 304 pages,
$19.95) that an accurate indicator of managerial panic is the
consumption rate and shelf life of business fads. He says
more than two dozen managerial techniques have waxed and
waned since the 1950s. The past five years have produced
Theory Z, Matrix, Managerial Grid, T Groups,
Interpreneurship, Demassing and One-Minute Managing.</p>
<p>He notes that many of these techniques contain valid
ideas, but that they frequently are tried piecemeal and then
quickly abandoned. He quotes a marketing manager at an
equipment manufacturer: "In the past eighteen months, we have
heard that profit is more important than revenue, quality is
more important than profit, that people are more important
than profit, that customers are more important than our
people . . . No wonder our performance is inconsistent."</p>
<p>Well, if you expected Mr. Pascale to tell us how to fix
what ails American companies without coming up with another
management technique then you truly are naive. His buzzword
answer to our problems is a new mind-set, or paradigm. It
contains four parts -- fit, split, contend and transcend.
(Has Mr. Pascale been studying management with Jesse
Jackson?)</p>
<p>So what does this paradigm mean in the real world of
management? He illustrates it using Honda Motor Co., which he
says is perhaps the best managed company in the world. He
says Honda has strong values and tightly disciplined
managementthat's fit. He says it is made up of proud and
highly independent companies that produce a single highly
integrated automobile -- that's split. The company uses a
contention-management system that facilitates rather than
suppresses conflict. Yet Honda's cultural fabric transcends
all this to handle the stress without tearing.</p>

<p>Everyone has been treated rudely in a store, restaurant or
on the phone with a company. Have you ever wondered why a
business allows that to happen? Clay Carr, in his book
"Front-Line Customer Service" (John Wiley, 280 pages,
$24.95), explains how to fix such problems. He argues that
changing the way employees interact with customers is
governed by how much of a commitment management is willing to
make. Management shows its commitment by a willingness to
train employees and by adopting policies that say customer
satisfaction is the company's only reason for being in
business.</p>
<p>But that's not why you should read this book. Mr. Carr
describes several companies and their policies toward
customers that make you want to do business with them. He
says the single best description of total quality comes from
a flier written by L.L. Bean in 1912: "I do not consider the
sale a success until the goods are worn out and the customer
still satisfied." He describes a large auto dealership in
which the sales personnel are paid on a commission basis,
with a bonus based on customer satisfaction. The outfit also
has a quality-control coordinator, who has the power to spend
as much as $500 per customer to satisfy complaints.</p>
<p>Word Perfect Corp., publisher of the popular
word-processing program, receives more than 10,000 calls a
day, every one of them free to the customer. The company
believes this service is good for business: From 1980 to 1988
its sales increased by almost 40,000%.</p>
<p>Orvis Co. sells fishing equipment by mail and did about
$73 million in sales in 1988. The company has a simple policy
on customer satisfaction: The customer is always right, never
mind proof to the contrary. Orvis once replaced a three-ounce
fly rod for a customer who said he broke it while trying to
kill a snake.</p>
