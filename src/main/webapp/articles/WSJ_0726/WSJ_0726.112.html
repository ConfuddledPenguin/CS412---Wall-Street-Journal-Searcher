	<p class="article-leader">Shipping and oil executives are devising strategies to
circumvent the biggest threat they face from new oil-spill
legislation -- unlimited liability in case of an accident.
   Already at least one international oil company has been
parking the title to some of its oil in transit with a
willing outside party, a company controlled by fugitive oil
trader Marc Rich in Switzerland. Refiners are also shunning
legal ownership until the oil they buy arrives at their
plants, instead of accepting it in the seller's port as
before.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the same time, some shippers are getting ready to
subdivide their fleets into single-ship companies, each with
minimal assets, to protect the rest of their operations from
any one claim.</p>
<p>"There will be all kinds of schemes to evade liability,"
says Sharon Tucker, an environmental lawyer and former
Department of Energy investigator who in the 1970s helped
crack traders' ploys to get around government oil-price
controls.</p>
<p>The proposed federal law, expected to be approved by
Congress soon, sets limits on oil-spill liability. But that's
irrelevant, say officials in the shipping and oil business,
because the bill doesn't pre-empt unlimited liability
statutes on the books in most coastal states, as the
industries had hoped.</p>
<p>Shipping and oil-industry specialists predict that this
continued possibility of open-ended claims under state laws
will scare away legitimate companies unwilling to risk their
assets each time they ship a load of oil to the U.S. Instead,
tanker owners without the resources to cover cleanup costs or
satisfy damage claims will be attracted to the trade, the
experts contend. The likely results, they say, will be higher
oil prices and more oil spills.</p>
<p>Many people familiar with the petroleum business expect
"pass-the-cargo" schemes, such as the one involving Mr. Rich,
to proliferate. The goal will be "to transfer ownership {of
the cargo} offshore, outside U.S. limits," says David Booher,
an executive with Transworld Oil U.S.A. Inc., a company
controlled by John Deuss, a major international oil trader.</p>
<p>In fact, Texas oilman and trader Kyle McAlister says he's
already canvassing U.S. refiners. For at least 10 cents a
barrel, Mr. McAlister says, he is prepared to run the
liability risk for them, buying their oil and holding
possession of it until it reaches their refineries. To do
that and keep his own assets out of reach of U.S. courts,
he'd pack up his wife and three children, liquidate his U.S.
holdings and move to Switzerland.</p>
<p>"There's money to be made" if the government doesn't plug
the loophole allowing third parties to run interference, says
Mr. McAlister, a multimillionaire who trades at least 40
crude oil cargoes on his own each year.</p>
<p>Mr. McAlister's propositions are getting a hearing from
tanker and cargo owners who know they can't turn to insurers
anymore. "There is no such thing as unlimited liability
insurance," says Nick Doak, a spokesman for insurance
underwriters at Lloyd's of London. "The U.S. government can
sanction unlimited risk if it wants, but underwriters will
impose their own limits. And if the vessel or cargo owner
wants to run the remainder of the risk himself, fine."</p>
<p>Some federal officials are concerned about the proposed
law. In a recent letter to Walter B. Jones, congressional
chairman of the Conference Committee on Oil Spill
Legislation, Secretary of Transportation Samuel Skinner said
he was "deeply troubled" by the pending legislation and added
that it would "have a detrimental effect on the supply and
safety of the transportation of petroleum" to the U.S. An
Energy Department official adds: "We're concerned that with
unlimited liability, major oil and shipping companies won't
send tankers here and the delivery system into certain states
will be disrupted."</p>
<p>Indeed, at least four barging companies, including units
of Texaco Inc. and Amerada Hess Corp. already have stopped
sending their vessels carrying heavy grades of oil to Maine,
one state with an unlimited liability law. And six shipping
companies now refuse to send their ships to any U.S. port in
anticipation of the new federal law. "I don't want to go to
jail because some {ship's} pilot makes a wrong turn," says
James Hood, president of Teekay Shipping Co., a major crude
carrier on the West Coast that has pulled its 51 tankers out
of the U.S. trade. "I'm taking this seriously."</p>
<p>Oil companies are trying to distance themselves from the
transport of oil as well. Elf Aquitaine will no longer sell
oil to U.S. refiners on a delivered basis, meaning that it
now relinquishes title to the oil before shipping. The French
oil giant suspended those types of oil sales after the
Norwegian-owned tanker Mega Borg foundered last month in the
Gulf of Mexico with 38.1 million gallons of Elf-owned oil on
board. The oil was bound for a Crown Central Petroleum Corp.
refinery, which had purchased it on a delivered basis.
Although the ship operator bore responsibility for
controlling pollution caused by the accident, Elf, as owner
of the cargo, ended up spending $8 million when the shipper
balked, according to one individual knowledgeable about the
incident.</p>
<p>Lawmakers and state regulators contend that oilmen and
shippers are bluffing. Maine is being boycotted by barging
companies not because of its longstanding law but because
it's home to Sen. George Mitchell, they say. The senator has
been spearheading the fight against federal preemption of
states' rights. "We've heard them {oilmen and shippers} say
that if they don't get pre-emption, they'll freeze them out
in Maine," says Bill Woodward, senior aide to one of the
principal authors of the oil-spill legislation.</p>
<p>Laws fostering unlimited liability have been on the books
in some states for years without slowing shipping traffic.
But state governments have become more pugnacious since the
Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska last year. And tanker owners
previously felt that they could always fall back on a
long-established U.S. maritime law allowing a shipper to
petition a court to limit his liability to cargo and vessel
only, says Warren Dean of Intertanko, an organization
representing 85% of the world's shippers. If there isn't any
evidence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, he
explains, the request is usually granted.</p>
<p>Exxon Corp. attorneys considered invoking this tactic in
the Exxon Valdez case, but decided against the action because
of they feared it would generate an enormous barrage of
negative publicity. Now, however, that maritime law would be
superseded by the new federal legislation.</p>
<p>Tanker companies aren't abandoning the U.S. market as a
bluff or "out of spite," Mr. Dean maintains. "It's just pure
commercial reality."</p>
<p>Many of the world's prominent tanker fleets are owned by
families whose entire fortunes ride on them. To protect their
assets, many of these family companies have already
restructured into a series of small companies, each with a
tanker as its only asset. So, if there is a spill or some
other catastrophe involving a ship, the risk is isolated.
"They don't want to put their families at risk," says Capt.
William MacDonald, a ship's master who heads a U.K.-based
marine consulting firm.</p>
<p>Capt. MacDonald and others paint a bleak picture of higher
charter rates for tankers bound for the U.S., and of a
proliferation of single-ship companies without assets if
unlimited liability becomes the norm here. And because some
regulators have threatened to confiscate ships until cleanup
and damage claims are satisfied, the single-ship companies
plying U.S.bound routes will likely be the oldest and most
expendable tankers in the world fleet.</p>
<p>Or tankers may carry oil to terminals in the Caribbean,
whence it would be transported to the U.S. on a shuttle run
by shipowners with nothing to lose in the U.S. People in the
industry say at least three Greek shipowners are waiting to
set up such operations if unlimited liability becomes a
reality in the U.S. And each of those owners runs a string of
one-ship companies.</p>
