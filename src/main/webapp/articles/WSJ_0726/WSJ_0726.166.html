	<p class="article-leader">A summertime small-business phenomenon is now in full
swing: the teacher as part-time entrepreneur.
   Few professions produce as many part-time entrepreneurs as
teaching. And the long summer vacation is the time when
thousands put down their chalk and start calculating their
profit margins -- often so they can afford to pick up the
chalk in September.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Johnny Hamilton, a 42-year-old junior high school teacher
in Monroe, La., loves teaching industrial arts, but his
salary is only $23,000 a year. He says he and his wife, also
a teacher, and their four children could "survive" on their
teaching income alone. But the family would have to forgo a
lot of extras, and the kids wouldn't get to attend dance
class or football camp.</p>
<p>So, he runs a summertime lawn service. It boosts his
annual income by as much as 25%. And though friends ask why
he doesn't just relax when summer comes, he tells them, "I'm
working to be able to teach next year."</p>
<p>With three months of vacation, other teachers just crave
something different to do after months in the classroom.
Others just hate being idle.</p>
<p>Susy Philhours and Virginia Cooper, middle-aged elementary
school teachers in Bowling Green, Ky., wanted something to
fill their summers after their grown children left home. Last
year, they started a part-time, hand-painted apparel
business, called the Two T's Inc. ("T" is for teacher).
They're learning some lessons of their own in real-world
economics.</p>
<p>At a recent teachers' convention where they exhibited
their wares, they priced their T-shirts at $12 only to find a
competitor's moving faster at $10. They felt their stuff is
"prettier," and worth the higher price. But they met the
rival's price anyway, and sales jumped. "It's a lot different
than teaching your vowels, rules and numbers," allows Ms.
Philhours, who was named Kentucky Elementary Teacher of the
Year for 1990.</p>
<p>Nobody knows how many teachers transform themselves into
entrepreneurs each year, but educators clearly moonlight more
often than other professionals. Last year, 477,000
elementary, secondary and vocational school teachers ran
their own businesses or worked a second job, say government
surveys. This group accounts for 11.8% of all teachers, a
level nearly twice that of multiple jobholders in the general
working population.</p>
<p>Many are young, inexperienced teachers with low base
salaries, says another government survey. They make enough in
summer to close the income gap with more experienced peers,
says Sharon Bobbitt, a government statistician.</p>
<p>For some teachers, a summertime business is a welcome
break from the school grind. Burr Rhodes, a high school
counselor in Hummelstown, Pa., runs a painting business with
two teaching pals. After some school days, he wonders whether
he did anybody any good. But the results of painting, he
says, are "so visible."</p>
<p>For others, a summer business means security. Susie
Mangus, a 25-year-old teacher in Evergreen, Colo., has worked
as a waitress during the summer since she was a teen-ager.
She's sick of hearing diners complain, but she doesn't know
where to find better employment. "It's real hard to get a
three-month job," she says. Next summer, once she has
completed her masters' degree in teaching, she plans to start
making money at something she has done mostly for fun until
now: running a business selling T-shirts and sweat outfits
that she decorates.</p>
<p>But teachers find that some businesses don't lend
themselves to being a part-time operation. Jan Bohlin and
Gerald Muto, two mathematics teachers in Topsham, Maine,
started a summertime carpentry business so they could afford
luxuries their teaching salaries wouldn't allow, such as
their own custom-built homes. However, they found the work
wasn't very profitable. They couldn't handle enough volume in
just three months to recoup their insurance, workers'
compensation, equipment and advertising costs.</p>
<p>Therefore, they decided to run the company year-round.
They hired a supervisor to oversee their projects during
school hours, check on the work after 3 p.m., and sometimes
work until nightfall, while still trying to give their
schoolwork top billing. "Sometimes it's very busy and
sometimes we're very tired," says Mr. Bohlin.</p>
<p>Not all teachers find owning a business, even part time,
to their liking. Charles Brads, a mathematics teacher in
Clayton, Ohio, used to enjoy the roofing business he started
16 years ago. It helped support his children. He got to work
outside after being cooped up in a classroom. And the neat
look of well-laid rows of shingles appealed to his
mathematical mind.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, he grew to resent the arithmetic required to
keep tabs on things. He had to squander a day a week on
finances, taxes and other paper work. "That's not my kind of
math," he says. "I enjoy finding the area under a curve, but
I hate adding a long column of figures."</p>
<p>What's more, now that he is 45, he finds it harder to run
up the ladder. So, he retired from roofing this year; in his
spare time, he is selling mutual funds.</p>
<p>For some, however, a part-time business becomes a life
raft out of a dead-end career. Dale Eby, an Englewood, Ohio,
resident, says he burned out after running the same
woodworking class, seven days a week, for nine years. He
found, meanwhile, that he liked being his own boss, running a
home-remodeling business during the summer.</p>
<p>He quit teaching last fall. After a brief stint working
for a construction contractor, he started his own remodeling
company this spring. So far, he's completed $15,000 of work.
And he says the only thing he misses from school is cutting
out at 3.</p>
