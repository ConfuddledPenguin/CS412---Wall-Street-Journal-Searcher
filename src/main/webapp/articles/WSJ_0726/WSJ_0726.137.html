	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Just two days after Monday's stock-market
plunge, the Securities and Exchange Commission reluctantly
approved a rule that would sharply curtail program trading on
volatile days.
   The rule, proposed by the New York Stock Exchange,
probably would have slowed Monday's drop if it had been in
place, said Richard Ketchum, the agency's chief market
watcher. "The slope of the decline picked up" Monday at the
point where the Big Board's restriction would have kicked in,
he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Still, all four SEC commissioners expressed reservations
about the rule. Moreover, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission worried in a letter to the SEC that the rule "will
decrease the linkage between markets." Nonetheless, the SEC
unanimously voted to allow the Big Board to adopt the pilot
plan for one year.</p>
<p>The SEC also voted to allow the introduction of a new
product that will enable investors to protect themselves from
market drops. The product, called SuperShares, was designed
by Los Angeles investment firm Leland O'Brien Rubinstein Inc.
to improve on the concept of portfolio insurance -- the now
almost-defunct strategy that Leland O'Brien designed to
protect institutional investors in market declines.
Regulators and others who analyzed the crash concluded that
it helped fuel the 508-point drop by the Dow Jones Industrial
Average in the October 1987 crash.</p>
<p>SuperShares uses a complicated variation on mutual funds
to enable investors to bet on stock movements. One form of
SuperShares is tied to the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index,
to allow investors to benefit from big rises in the stock
market. Another kind uses money-market funds to let investors
benefit from big drops. "We don't know whether this product
is going to be successful or not," said SEC Chairman Richard
Breeden. But the commission decided to offer the choice to
the marketplace.</p>
<p>The Big Board rule will place severe restrictions on
program trading whenever the Dow Jones Industrial Average
moves up or down 50 or more points in a day. Specifically,
the plan targets index arbitrage, a computerized
program-trading strategy that allows market players to take
advantage of small price differences between a basket of
stocks and a stock-index futures contract. That contract,
traded on a commodity exchange, allows investors to bet on
the movement of a stock basket without owning the stocks.</p>
<p>Index arbitrage has been blamed for exacerbating sharp
market moves. But the new rule will force traders to wait for
"upticks" in stock prices before completing the stock side of
their transaction in a market falling by more than 50 points.
That means firms would be taking market risk while they are
waiting for stocks to move up. It is expected that many firms
won't do index-arbitrage trades if they can't be assured of
completing the transaction with a rapid-fire trade.</p>
<p>SEC officials emphasized that the rule wouldn't prohibit
index arbitrage. "Index arbitrage becomes riskier, but it can
be done," Mr. Ketchum said. He suggested that it would induce
program traders to reduce the size of their trades, so they
could take less market risk.</p>
<p>The Big Board rule would be triggered an average of once a
month, the SEC said. The restriction would be unwound if the
Dow industrials move to within 25 points of the prior day's
closing level. The Big Board first proposed the rule to kick
in after a 35-point move, but revised it after SEC complaints
that it was too restrictive.</p>
<p>Still, each SEC commissioner in turn expressed concern
that the 50-point level would be reached too frequently and
that placing roadblocks to index arbitrage could add risk to
the markets. The agency's chief economist, Kenneth Lehn, told
the commission that the impact on the futures and options
markets could be dangerous, and recommended the SEC "send the
exchange back to the drawing board" for more economic
analysis.</p>
<p>Even Mr. Ketchum, the SEC market-regulation director who
advocated approving the pilot program, suggested that he was
concerned about "de-linking the markets."</p>
<p>But Commissioner Edward Fleischman said the exchange
"should be allowed to make its own mistakes" and learn from
them.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION will allow until
Aug. 22 for comment before granting final approval of
SuperShares, a product designed to give investors protection
from market drops. An article in yesterday's editions didn't
fully explain the agency's action.</p>
