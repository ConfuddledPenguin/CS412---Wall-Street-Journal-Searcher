	<p class="article-leader">Merck & Co., responding to mergers that have reshaped the
pharmaceutical industry over the past two years, is teaming
up with chemical giant Du Pont Co. to form a new company.
   Under terms of the agreement, the two companies will own,
in a 50-50 partnership, Du Pont's entire pharmaceutical
operation, which is expected to post sales of $550 million
this year. Merck will provide the new company with foreign
marketing rights to some prescription medicines plus an
undisclosed amount of cash.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The deal is certain to shake up the world-wide drug
industry, which is undergoing cataclysmic changes as
companies merge and forge alliances with one another in
unprecedented numbers. "The rules are changing very fast,"
said Edgar S. Woolard Jr., Du Pont's chairman and chief
executive officer. "Because of all the recent consolidations
taking place, the risk of going it alone is much, much higher
than five years ago."</p>
<p>By joining forces with Du Pont, Merck sends a sharp signal
that it is willing to take unusually aggressive steps to keep
its place atop the U.S. drug industry. The move is certain to
raise concern at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., whose recent
merger was an effort to take aim at Merck.</p>
<p>As importantly, the agreement shows that the high cost of
developing new drugs is daunting even for a company as
successful as Merck. In order to keep profits robust, drug
makers must discover breakthrough medicines that can garner
premium prices. But the expensive cost of biomedical
technology these days means that even Merck can't make those
kinds of discoveries alone.</p>
<p>Under the new venture, called Du Pont Merck
Pharmaceuticals Co., Merck, already acclaimed as the premier
drug research company in the U.S., will get access to all of
Du Pont's experimental drugs and its small but productive
research operation. Merck's top officials said they broached
the idea of a partnership last year in an effort to obtain
new drugs needed to maintain Merck's rapid profit growth.</p>
<p>"We're convinced that we have to increase our access to
R&D if we want to increase our world-wide market share" of
the pharmaceutical business, said Roy Vagelos, chairman and
chief executive of Merck. Outright acquisitions of other drug
makers would be too costly, he said. Instead, "we looked to a
company with a top-notch research operation, but that needed
the marketing and development skills we could offer."</p>
<p>Although Merck's list of drugs and its research pipeline
is the envy of many drug makers, company officials conceded
that they needed outside help to sustain Merck as a "premium
growth company," said Francis Spiegel, the company's senior
vice president.</p>
<p>Merck officials have smarted from some analysts' criticism
that the company couldn't maintain its past performance.
Merck profit growth has slowed this year as the company
pumped up R&D funding to $750 million and spent heavily to
increase the size of its sales force. Earnings for the first
six months of 1990 rose 18.6% to $874 million, or $2.23 a
share, ending four years of quarterly profit increases of 25%
or more.</p>
<p>Company officials also say that the merger that formed
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. galvanized their belief that they
needed to increase the company's product line faster than
Merck's R&D operation could manage on its own. Other recent
mergers have produced SmithKline Beecham Corp. and Marion
Merrell Dow Inc. Meanwhile, American Home Products Corp.
acquired A.H. Robins Co., Hoffmann-La Roche acquired 60% of
Genentech Inc., and Eastman Kodak Co. acquired Sterling Drug
Co.</p>
<p>"This is our answer to all that," Mr. Spiegel said. "It
gets us more aggressive, gives us more access to product and
helps us strengthen our global business. We accomplish all
those objectives without paying the huge premiums that can
dilute current earnings and without the problems associated
with melding two corporations." Both companies said the
agreement won't dilute their earnings.</p>
<p>Dr. Vagelos said he expects products from Du Pont's
research to help Merck "have medicines to treat every major
type of illness." The company believes that in coming years
it will need a broad product line to negotiate with health
insurance plans and hospitals joining forces to buy medicines
at discounted prices.</p>
<p>For Du Pont, the venture will mean a much-needed presence
abroad as well as the chance to share in the revenue of
certain Merck products. Under the agreement, the new venture
will sell several Merck products in West Germany, France,
Italy, Great Britain and Spain. In particular, it will
eventually have the right to co-market, along with Merck,
Merck's experimental drug Proscar, a drug for treating
enlarged prostates that is expected to generate huge sales
when approved for use.</p>
<p>"We realized that if we ever were going to make it as a
drug company we needed to be able to sell our new products in
foreign markets," said Joseph Mollica, a Du Pont vice
president who will head the new venture. Mr. Mollica said the
foreign operation, which he expects to expand to Japan, will
generate revenue one to two years earlier than if Du Pont
waited for the drugs to gain approval in the U.S., where drug
approvals come slower than abroad.</p>
<p>Most importantly, Merck will help Du Pont push new drugs
through its pipeline, the companies' officials said. Du
Pont's researchers get high marks in the industry for several
novel drugs, including treatments for Alzheimer's disease,
arthritis, pain relief, and others to lower cholesterol and
prevent heart attacks.</p>
<p>Merck was first attracted to Du Pont last year, after its
researchers beat out several companies, including Merck, in
developing a new drug for high blood pressure called an A2
inhibitor. In October, Merck acquired the rights to
co-develop the drug, and soon afterward proposed the broader
agreement. "Discovering the A2 drug was an outstanding
accomplishment," Dr. Vagelos says. "It showed us a lot about
the quality of their research."</p>
<p>The venture was announced after the close of trading
yesterday. Merck stock closed at $89 a share, up 50 cents in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Also on the Big
Board, Du Pont shares rose 50 cents to close at $39.375.</p>
