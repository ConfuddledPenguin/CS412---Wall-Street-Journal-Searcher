	<p class="article-leader">Gerber Products Co., citing strong sales of baby food,
said earnings for its first quarter rose 17% to $31.3
million, or 83 cents a share.
   The Fremont, Mich., baby-food concern said successful
promotions and increased distribution in the quarter
contributed to a volume increase of 6%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-earlier quarter, Gerber earned $26.8 million,
or 70 cents a share. Sales for the latest quarter, ended June
30, rose 12% to $295.9 million from $263.9 million.</p>
<p>The company said that while it is pleased with these
results, "there are indications that some of this increase
may have resulted from advance buying by our customers."</p>
<p>Consequently, Gerber said, volume for its second quarter
is expected to be flat with the year-earlier period. But for
the full year, it said volume gains are expected to be "in
excess of those projected for the industry."</p>
