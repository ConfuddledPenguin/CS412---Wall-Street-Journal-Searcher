	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Combined profits at General Motors Corp.'s
finance and technology subsidiaries were virtually flat in
the second quarter, as a 25% decline in earnings at the GM
Hughes Electronics unit offset gains in data processing and
finance operations.
   GM's Electronic Data Systems Corp., General Motors
Acceptance Corp. and GM Hughes units had combined earnings of
$579.6 million in the quarter, up 0.5% from $577 million a
year before. GM is scheduled to release earnings for the
remainder of its operations today.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GM Hughes, which includes the defense technology
operations of Hughes Aircraft Co. and the automotive
electronics businesses of Delco Electronics Corp., saw net
income in the quarter fall to $152.3 million from $203.1
million a year earlier. The decline came despite record
second quarter revenue of $2.99 billion, up from $2.88
billion a year ago. GM Hughes blamed the decline on increased
spending for new products at Hughes, the impact of GM vehicle
production cuts on Delco, and higher taxes.</p>
<p>GM's Class H stock, which represents a dividend interest
in Hughes earnings, closed yesterday at $18.875, down 12.5
cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>At EDS, second quarter net income rose 19% to $125.3
million from $104.9 million. Revenue rose 5.7% to $1.46
billion. GM business accounted for 55% of EDS's total revenue
in the latest quarter. "We anticipate having a very good
year," EDS chairman Les Alberthal said in a statement. GM
Class E stock, which represents a dividend interest in EDS
earnings, closed yesterday at $33.75, down 50 cents in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>GMAC, the auto maker's finance arm, said lower borrowing
costs helped boost second quarter net income by 12% to $302
million from $269 million a year ago. However, GMAC said the
number of new vehicles it financed in the U.S. during the
latest quarter fell 24% to 541,000 cars and trucks. Outside
the U.S., GMAC financed 9.9% fewer new vehicles than a year
ago.</p>
<p>For the first half of the year, net income at GM Hughes
fell 21% to $297.9 million from $376 million a year ago.
Revenue eased to $5.85 billion from $5.89 billion.</p>
<p>EDS's first-half profit rose 14.7% to $235.1 million from
$204.9 million. Revenue was up 7.8% to $2.87 billion from
$2.66 billion.</p>
<p>GMAC's first-half earnings rose 2% to $638 million from
$625 million.</p>
