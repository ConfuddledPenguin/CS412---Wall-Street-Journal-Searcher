	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee
approved legislation allowing the donation of surplus federal
property to non-profit groups working with homeless people.
   Currently, the government grants limited-term leases to
such qualified groups, an arrangement that public-interest
organizations have argued prohibits them from making
long-range plans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Assistant Housing Secretary Anna Kondratas said the
administration welcomed the measure and would use its
regulatory authority to start deeding properties even before
final passage of the measure, which the committee approved by
voice vote.</p>
<p>Deeding the property to groups dealing with the homeless
will make "a significant difference" in the program because
the lease arrangement currently thwarts those groups from
securing the financing needed to improve the facilities, said
Wendy Adler, of the National Governors' Association.</p>
<p>The McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 is the
primary federal vehicle for aiding the homeless. But critics
have charged that one of its major programs, the
surplus-property program, has been less effective than it
could be because of government inefficiency and insufficient
information on available properties.</p>
<p>"There is still no comprehensive federal guidance on how
to obtain federal vacant properties," John Ols, the director
of housing and community development issues of the General
Accounting Office, said last week in testmony before the
committee.</p>
