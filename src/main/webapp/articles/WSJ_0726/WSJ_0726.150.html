	<p class="article-leader">Fieldcrest Cannon Inc., citing a 12% decline in sales in
its bed and bath division, posted a second-quarter loss of
$6.1 million, or 58 cents a share, compared with earnings of
$7.7 million, or 74 cents a share, a year earlier.
   The Eden, N.C.-based textile concern said sales in the
most recent quarter fell 8.7%, to $316.3 million from $346.4
million. The company said its results had been further
undermined by the need to curtail mill schedules to reduce
inventory. Additionally, Fieldcrest took a pretax charge of
$1.1 million, or 10 cents a share, following the closing of
its Laurel Hill, N.C., mill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said the results were significantly worse than
expected.</p>
<p>"It's confirmation of the business losing market share,"
said Deborah Bronston, an analyst with Prudential Bache
Research. Fieldcrest, saddled with high operating costs,
faces stiff competition from Springs Industries Inc. and West
Point-Pepperell Inc., she said.</p>
<p>For the first half, the company had a net loss of $5.7
million, or 55 cents a share, compared with net income of
$10.7 million, or $1.04 a share, a year earlier. Sales
dropped 8.1% to $590.7 million from $642.7 million.</p>
