	<p class="article-leader">CALGARY, Alberta -- TransAlta Utilities Corp. said it will
discontinue most operations of its TransAlta Energy Systems
Corp. unit, resulting in a write-off of about 17 million
Canadian dollars (US$14.7 million), or 12.5 Canadian cents a
share.
   TransAlta said it decided that building automation isn't
strategic to the future of its TransAlta Resources Corp.
unit, a holding company through which TransAlta owns
TransAlta Energy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>TransAlta, an electric utility with oil and gas and other
interests, said the writeoff includes TransAlta Energy's
losses so far this year, which total about C$4 million. The
unit, which installs building automation equipment, such as
heating control systems, lost C$6 million last year.</p>
<p>For the first quarter ended March 31, TransAlta had net
earnings of C$54.1 million, or 30 Canadian cents a share, on
revenue of C$273.3 million.</p>
<p>TransAlta said Andover, Mass.-based Andover Controls, a
unit of London-based BICC PLC, an engineering, construction,
and power company, agreed to complete all of TransAlta
Energy's current projects, and to honor its other
obligations, including warranties. Andover Controls makes
most of the building automation equipment that TransAlta
Energy has installed.</p>
