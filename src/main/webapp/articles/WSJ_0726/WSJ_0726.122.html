	<p class="article-leader">Battered by the slumping commercial real estate market,
MNC Financial Corp., a big Baltimore-based regional banking
company, has tentatively lined up a capital infusion of at
least $200 million from an investor group, according to
people familiar with the bank.
   Meanwhile, J.P. Morgan & Co., the big New York bank, is
attempting to assemble a $1 billion line of credit for MNC,
the people said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One of the nation's most aggressive real estate lenders,
MNC posted a second-quarter loss of $74.7 million Tuesday as
problem loans more than doubled. The banking company said
then that it is considering the sale of some non-banking
units to reduce its need for short-term debt.</p>
<p>With $28 billion of assets, MNC is the largest banking
company in the Baltimore-Washington, D.C., area, the latest
region to fall victim to the real estate slump. MNC is the
parent of Maryland National Bank, American Security Bank and
Equitable Bank.</p>
<p>MNC is under pressure to reduce its borrowings following
the recent downgrading of its debt to non-investment grade,
or junk, status by Moody's Investors Service Inc.</p>
<p>According to an individual close to the bank, MNC's board
has agreed, subject to final terms, to accept a capital
infusion of at least $200 million from an investor group led
by Alfred Lerner.</p>
<p>The Cleveland investor, who was chairman of Equitable
Bancorp. before its merger with MNC early this year, owns a
8.9% stake in MNC and is a director of the banking company.</p>
<p>MNC's directors have approved the proposed capital
infusion by Mr. Lerner's group, the individual said.</p>
<p>Faced with the ratings downgrade, MNC, which relies on the
capital markets for funds to a greater degree than most
regional banks, has quit selling its commercial paper to
raise money.</p>
<p>As recently as March 31, MNC had $2 billion of its
commercial paper, or short-term IOUs, outstanding. But that
had shrunk to about $126 million as of June 30, a bank
spokesman said. An additional $823 million in other MNC debt
comes due over the next year, he said.</p>
<p>The MNC spokesman declined to say whether the bank has
arranged alternative credit lines. However, he said MNC
hasn't had to resort to borrowing from the Federal Reserve
System's discount window.</p>
<p>People familiar with the company said the current cash
shortage exists at the parent holding company. They said
MNC's banking units have been building their cash levels in
recent months and don't presently face a cash problem.</p>
<p>Top federal banking regulators declined to comment.</p>
<p>According to Thomson BankWatch, a ratings agency, MNC has
the second-largest exposure to commercial real estate of any
major bank -- 30.9% of all loans -- and posted the
second-highest growth rate in its commercial real estate
portfolio last year, 46.5%.</p>
<p>Bank analysts say a rapid rise in real estate loans, which
are very profitable in good times but are subject to cyclical
downturns, often is a warning light of possible future
problems.</p>
<p>With MNC's January merger with Equitable Bancorp., the
banking company's real estate portfolio totals $5.8 billion.
Its nonperforming assets stand at $757 million, or 4.7% of
its $16.4 billion in loans.</p>
<p>In comments to investors earlier this month, Standard &
Poor's Corp. said MNC's real estate growth "was not
accompanied by sufficiently strong credit standards. The
combination of aggressive growth and weak underwriting
magnifies the company's asset quality exposure to continued
adjustments in the real estate markets."</p>
<p>The current quarter could well be a crossroads for MNC.
The federal Comptroller of the Currency is conducting a
targeted exam of MNC's loans, and analysts said a 15% or more
increase in nonperforming loans could imperil its
$1.16-a-share annual dividend.</p>
<p>Frank Barkocy, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co.,
however, said he expects only modest increases in
nonperforming assets, if any, in the third quarter. "The
third quarter could reflect a return to profitability, albeit
modest," he said.</p>
<p>One reason MNC is in better shape to ride out its woes
than many banks is that it has a cash cow in the form of its
Delaware credit card bank.</p>
