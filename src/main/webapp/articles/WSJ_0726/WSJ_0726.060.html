	<p class="article-leader">Researchers say they may have found a way to prevent
kidney inflammations, the leading cause of chronic kidney
failure.
   The therapy would be the first to block the scarring
involved in the inflammations, which will cause 35,000 of the
more than 170,000 new cases of kidney failure in the U.S.
this year. Chronic kidney failure, which usually forces
patients to undergo costly dialysis, is rising at an 8% to 9%
rate each year, according to the National Institutes of
Health.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a study published in today's issue of the British
journal Nature, scientists at the La Jolla Cancer Research
Foundation and at the University of Utah School of Medicine
found that the inflammations are tied to the increased
production in the kidneys of a protein called Transforming
Growth Factor-Beta. They then discovered an antibody that
appears to neutralize the activity of the growth factor and
block the formation of scar tissue in the kidneys' filtration
units, which remove waste products and excess fluid from the
body.</p>
<p>But some researchers seem less convinced that the findings
will prevent the scarring that clogs the kidneys. "I'm
skeptical that this is the only factor causing the
progression of kidney disease," says Lawrence Agodoa,
director of clinical studies for the kidney division of NIH.
He says other growth factors could be involved. "We aren't
near any kind of human application," he says, noting that the
experiments have been conducted only on rats.</p>
<p>Dr. Agodoa says others have tied high blood pressure, high
cholesterol levels and high-protein diets to the progression
of kidney scarring, and a cure may involve these factors as
well. NIH is currently involved in a multimillion-dollar,
four-year study that's trying to determine the role of diet
in the progression of kidney failure.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, "this is a window of opportunity to develop a
therapy for kidney disease," which is caused by diabetes and
high blood pressure, among other things, says Wayne A.
Border, an author of the study who is a professor and chief
of the division of nephrology at the University of Utah
School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Rights to the findings have been acquired by Telios
Pharmaceuticals Inc., a closely held La Jolla, Calif., drug
concern that is 25%-owned by the La Jolla Cancer Research
Foundation. Telios said it plans to develop and market drugs
based on the discovery in five to seven years.</p>
<p>So far, doctors have only been able to use steroids and
immunosuppressive drugs to treat diseases that initially
cause inflammation and injury to the kidneys, such as Lupus
and certain infections. The problem is that "the treatments
aren't that effective," says Arthur Cohen, a professor of
pathology and medicine at University of California, Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>Even if they halt the disease that initially produces
damage to the kidneys, the organs often continue to
degenerate for unexplained reasons. "Once the destructive
process begins, we cannot stop it," says Dr. Cohen. Doctors
are only able to prescribe ways to reduce blood pressure and
protein in a patient's diet, which appear to slow the
destruction of the kidneys.</p>
<p>While the current study doesn't show that the antibodies
used destroy existing scars, it does show that they prevent
scarring from occuring. Dr. Border says that the preventive
finding could be used to spare thousands from dialysis or
from transplants.</p>
<p>It could help some of the 15,000 patients now awaiting
transplants, only half of whom will receive one, Dr. Border
says. Or it may assist some of the 80,000 people who die of
kidney and urinary tract diseases each year, according to the
National Kidney Foundation. It could also aid one of every
five diabetics who now develop kidney failure. And it may
reduce medical costs. Because of the high price of dialysis
and transplants, the cost of kidney and urologic diseases in
1990 is expected to exceed $50 billion, more than $3 billion
of which will come from taxpayers' pockets.</p>
<p>The researchers say they have begun trying to replicate
the results in humans, and expect final results in six
months. So far, says Erkki Ruoslahti, president of the
foundation, results are encouraging.</p>
<p>They also say the findings have potential for the
development of treatments for such disorders as liver
cirrhosis, pulmonary fibrosis and cancer. "There are similar
diseases that affect the lungs or the liver, with excessive
scar formation. We suspect that those diseases could be
treated the same way," says Dr. Ruoslahti.</p>
