	<p class="article-leader">Pacific Telesis Group and Cellular Communications Inc.
announced plans to merge their Ohio and Michigan cellular
operations in a transaction that ultimately would give
Pacific Telesis the right to buy a pared-down CCI.
   The agreement, which sets up a multistep process, marks
further consolidation of the cellular telephone market.
Initially, San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis will buy 5% of
CCI's stock at $39 a share, for a total of about $87 million.
The companies will merge their cellular operations, forming
one of the nation's largest regional systems. The
27,000-square-mile territory, which has a population of
nearly 15 million, includes Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus,
Dayton, Detroit and Toledo.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a good long-term strategic fit for Pacific Telesis,"
said Joel Gross, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette. "With the current consolidation, it is inevitable
that phone companies will be buyers, in part because cellular
poses a threat to their local copper-wire networks."</p>
<p>PacTel Cellular, Pacific Telesis's cellular telephone
unit, currently operates in the Detroit-Toledo area under the
Cellular One name. CCI also operates under the Cellular One
name in Ohio.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for New York-based CCI to spin off to
shareholders two businesses, its international operations and
long-distance business, before closing the transaction.
Afterward, CCI will spin off to shareholders a third public
company containing its cellular operations in Puerto Rico.
The companies said they expect the closing to take place in
the second or third quarters of 1991 after approval from
shareholders and regulators.</p>
<p>In the first 4 1/2 years after the closing, Pacific
Telesis can buy up to 27.5% of CCI stock through open market
purchases and privately negotiated sales. After that period,
the regional Bell telephone company has agreed to buy 10.04
million shares at $60 each, or a total of about $600 million,
for 22.5% of CCI.</p>
<p>Pacific Telesis can buy the remaining shares 5 1/2 years
to eight years after the closing, and the price would be
based on investment bankers' appraisals of CCI's interest in
the joint venture. The series of options and the appraisal
process make it difficult to put a price tag on the total
transaction, but CCI is generally valued at about $1.5
billion and the joint venture's value is expected to double
that.</p>
<p>CCI Chairman George Blumenthal said the combination of the
Ohio and Michigan regions puts the joint venture in a strong
position to win much more than 50% of the market. "It gives
us the ability to craft special services and market to
clients with multiple branch offices," he said. CCI studies
have shown that "roaming" and long-distance calls generally
are within 200 miles, with many of the calls into the Detroit
market. Mr. Blumenthal also said that the joint venture will
consider acquiring cellular systems in areas adjoining the
joint venture's territory.</p>
<p>Lee Cox, president of PacTel Corp., the holding company
for Pacific Telesis's unregulated businesses, said that "one
of the earliest benefits will be the ability to market
together to some of our largest customers."</p>
<p>Investors, however, weren't so optimistic. CCI shares fell
$2.25 a share in national over-the-counter trading yesterday
to close at $33 a share. On the Big Board, Pacific Telesis
shares slipped 25 cents each to $41.50.</p>
<p>Barclay Knapp, CCI's chief operating officer, was chosen
as chief executive of the joint venture, which will be
directed by a four-person partnership committee. Both
companies will appoint two members.</p>
