	<p class="article-leader">As I write this (June 24), the death toll from the
earthquake in Iran has exceeded 40,000. And while we all must
give our full support to the relief efforts, we should note
that 40,000 is also the number of children in the world who
die every day from chronic malnutrition and preventable
disease. The earthquake in Iran is apparently the first since
1976 (the eighth in this century) to equal or exceed the
24-hour death toll of children in our world from malnutrition
and disease.
   The generous outpouring of media coverage and monetary
gifts directed to the victims in Iran is testimony to a
heartening new level of public compassion and concern. Yet
our concern is awakened only for sudden emergencies in
limited geographic areas. We have not yet fully awakened to
the unparalleled tragedy of malnutrition and disease, nor
have we recognized the low-cost opportunities to cut in half
the resulting death toll of 40,000 a day.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On Sept. 29 and 30, the World Summit for Children will
allow our leaders to address these opportunities fully. The
potential of the summit is to save the lives of 50 million
children during this decade. On Sept. 23, thousands of
citizens will voice their support for the summit in 180
candlelight vigils in 16 countries. All who wish to
participate should call 1-800-WE AGREE.</p>
