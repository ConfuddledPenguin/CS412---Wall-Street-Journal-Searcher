	<p class="article-leader">ZURICH, Switzerland -- Bank Vontobel & Co. has strongly
advised Jacobs Suchard AG shareholders not to accept the
terms of Philip Morris Cos.' $3.8 billion takeover bid for
the Swiss chocolate and coffee concern. Vontobel claims that
U.S. tax law provides a weapon to push the offer price
higher.
   In a study of the proposed acquisition released yesterday,
Vontobel wrote that unless New York-based Philip Morris
acquires 80% of Suchard's capital it will lose tax benefits
in the U.S. "We estimate that this could mean hundreds of
millions of Swiss francs for Philip Morris," said one of the
report's authors, Rene Weber.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This advice from Vontobel could introduce a new wrinkle in
the takeover. Many other analysts and Swiss banks had
reluctantly recommended that shareholders accept the offer on
the assumption they had no other choice.</p>
<p>A Philip Morris spokesman in Zurich quoted Luc E.
Vandevelde, vice president of the company's Kraft subsidiary,
as saying "there will be absolutely no changes" in the prices
offered to Suchard shareholders. Mr. Vandevelde has
represented Philip Morris throughout the transaction.</p>
<p>A Suchard spokesman said it was not his company's job to
comment.</p>
