	<p class="article-leader">Otis Pike, a former congressman (D., N.Y.), writing in a
July 25 syndicated column on how Supreme Court nominee David
Souter should answer questions on his views:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There are issues in every land that simply must be
addressed. Abortion was one of them, civil rights was
another, capital punishment a third, the right to die a
fourth. And when Congress ran away from those issues or wrote
laws so full of passion and devoid of reason or detail as to
be incomprehensible, the Supreme Court moved in. . . . A
proper response by Souter to the most zealous questioners
might be: "You write clear and concise laws for the nation
establishing a right of privacy, defining the times and terms
on which people may create a life or end one, declaring what
are and are not permissible hiring practices, stating what is
and what is not to be admissible evidence, and I will have no
trouble limiting myself to the traditional role of
determining the constitutionality of your actions. Until I
see what you have produced, however, I cannot tell you
whether I would find it constitutional or not."</p>
