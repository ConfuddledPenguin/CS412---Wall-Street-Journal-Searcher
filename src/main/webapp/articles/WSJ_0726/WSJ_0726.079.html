	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Panhandle Eastern Corp., citing current and
potential cash problems, slashed its dividend 60% despite its
repeated insistence that the payout would remain intact.
   "Today's dividend action recognizes that financial and
operating improvements expected when we acquired {Texas
Eastern} are developing more slowly and less dramatically
than anticipated," Panhandle's new chairman, Philip
Burguieres, said in a letter to shareholders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The natural gas pipeline company's debt soared after its
$3.22 billion acquisition of Texas Eastern Corp. in early
1989, with its debt-to-equity ratio moving above 70%. At the
time, many critics were skeptical that Panhandle would have
strong enough cash flow to maintain the dividend, with some
viewing the purchase price as too high. A spokesman said the
current debt ratio of about 65% is still well above the goal
of 50%.</p>
<p>While layoffs or other cutbacks haven't been announced,
the company said it would consider them. The board "directed
management to examine carefully all areas in which cash can
be saved, including capital expenditures and operating
expenses," Mr. Burguieres wrote.</p>
<p>The dividend cut, to 80 cents a share annually from $2 a
share, will save Panhandle about $105 million a year. Rumors
of the cut, which the company has denied ever since the Texas
Eastern acquisition and as recently as its annual meeting in
April, had been circulating on Wall Street for several weeks.
Panhandle's stock ended yesterday at $17.875, down 75 cents
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>Panhandle's difficulties were reflected in the
second-quarter earnings it announced yesterday. The company
said its loss widened to $13.6 million, or 15 cents a share,
from $5 million, or nine cents a share, a year earlier, which
included an $11.1 million one-time gain. Revenue declined
6.7% to $494 million from $529.4 million.</p>
<p>Among the problems cited, the company said its cleanup of
polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, at Texas Eastern pipeline
stations would exceed its earlier $400 million estimate. "We
don't know how much higher" it will be, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly low oil and natural gas prices in the first
half hurt pipeline volumes, particularly in the Northeast and
New England, because many customers switched to industrial
fuel oil from natural gas.</p>
<p>"Competitive pressures may become even more severe over
the short term," Mr. Burguieres said. The spokesman explained
that certain Panhandle pipeline rates to the Northeast will
go up in December, which could further hurt volume.</p>
<p>Also, a number of expansion projects have been delayed or
curbed, reducing expected gas volume for the company.</p>
<p>Panhandle said court rulings on regulatory matters could
force refunds that would strain cash holdings in the short
run, although the company said ultimately it will reap
positive cash in these cases. Panhandle said it may have an
unexpected $100 million tax liability because of Internal
Revenue Service interpretations affecting the sale of some
Texas Eastern assets.</p>
