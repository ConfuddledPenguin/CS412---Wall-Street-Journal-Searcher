	<p class="article-leader">Credit Suisse, Zurich, the commercial banking unit of CS
Holding, said that its second-quarter profit bested the poor
performance of the first quarter.
   But the bank said the improvement wasn't enough to prevent
a decline in profit for the first half from a year earlier.
The bank had net profit of 716 million francs ($442.3
million) last year, up 21% from 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Credit Suisse said its balance sheet rose 0.6% in the
second quarter to 124.4 billion francs, but for the first
half increased 5.7%, despite the decline in the dollar and
the gold price. In the second quarter, loan activity slowed
from the pace of the first quarter.</p>
<p>In the custom of Swiss companies, the bank didn't provide
specific profit figures, and omitted a full-year forecast.</p>
