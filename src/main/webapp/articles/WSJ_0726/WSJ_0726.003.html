	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The quarterly study of asset-allocation by The
Wall Street Journal and Wilshire Associates of Santa Monica,
Calif., includes the 10 brokerage houses that had the largest
number of registered representatives at the time they were
selected.
   Some firms publish more than one set of asset-allocation
recommendations. Within reason, they may pick which set they
want to be judged by, provided they specify in advance.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A.G. Edwards is judged on a "growth and income" portfolio,
Kidder Peabody on an "individual balanced" portfolio, and
PaineWebber on a "typical balanced portfolio."</p>
<p>Raymond James is judged on its advice to "young urban
professionals," Goldman Sachs on advice for a "smaller,
aggressive pension fund," and Prudential-Bache on its
recommendations for a "small, aggressive fund."</p>
<p>The four other firms -- Dean Witter, Merrill Lynch,
Shearson and Smith Barney -- publish only one set of
asset-allocation advice, which can be modified to fit
individual clients' needs.</p>
<p>Each house's advice is mirrored in a theoretical
portfolio. Holdings are adjusted whenever the advice changes,
and also on the last day of each month, to keep assets in the
recommended ratio.</p>
<p>Investments are assumed to do as well as the following
indexes: Standard & Poor's 500-stock index for stocks;
Merrill Lynch corporate and government master bond index for
bonds; 90-day Treasury bills for cash; the National Council
of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries/Frank Russell Co. index
for real estate; and the average monthly price of gold for
tangible assets.</p>
<p>The study disregards the cost of trading, mainly to make
the results comparable to market averages. In practice,
people who often adjust their investment blends may incur
high commissions.</p>
