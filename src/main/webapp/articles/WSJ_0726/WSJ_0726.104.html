	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, the British
securities unit of Deutsche Bank AG of West Germany, acquired
a minority stake in the mergers advisory boutique of Eric
Gleacher, former head of mergers and acquisitions at Morgan
Stanley & Co.
   The new firm of Gleacher Morgan Grenfell Inc. aims to
advise U.S. companies seeking to make investments in Europe
and European companies making acquisitions in the U.S.
Neither party would disclose terms, and both sides disputed
industry reports that the deal amounts to $30 million for a
one-third stake.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The alliance gives Mr. Gleacher, who opened his boutique
after leaving Morgan Stanley early this year, access to a
broad array of international clients, particularly through
Deutsche Bank, which acquired Morgan Grenfell late last year
for the equivalent of $1.6 billion, the highest price ever
paid for an investment bank. The move by Deutsche Bank comes
amid a surge in merger activity in Europe before its planned
market unification in 1992.</p>
<p>"I think this helps improve Eric's edge, from our point of
view, in his being able to come up with some possibilities
and ideas in other parts of the world," said Charles Michel
Harper, chairman of ConAgra Inc., which Mr. Gleacher advised
in a planned $1.3 billion purchase of Beatrice Co. this
summer.</p>
<p>"It takes him from being a litle boutique to being an
international player overnight," said Donald Drapkin, a
former takeover lawyer who is vice chairman of Revlon Group
Inc.</p>
<p>It also will bolster the mergers advisory practice of
Morgan Grenfell, which was shaken by a 1986 scandal involving
charges that one of its clients, Guinness PLC, manipulated
the price of a takeover target.</p>
<p>Mr. Gleacher said the alliance will give the firm "a major
flow of business." He said he aims eventually to expand the
firm, which has 10 professionals and 10 staff members, to
between 30 and 40 professionals.</p>
<p>Guy Dawson, a Morgan Grenfell director based in London,
said his firm's U.S. strategy has been to pursue "middle
market" transactions involving smaller companies. But after
the Deutsche Bank acquisition, he said, Morgan Grenfell wants
to "reposition itself" to pursue "bigger transactions."</p>
<p>"Morgan Grenfell needs capability and credibility in the
U.S.," Mr. Gleacher said. "That's what we're for." His new
firm also will pursue merchant banking transactions, in which
the firm invests its own money in deals, and may attempt to
raise a fund for that purpose.</p>
<p>After the new linkup, most of Morgan Grenfell's U.S.
mergers and corporate finance professionals are likely to
leave the firm, including their leader, Martin R. Wade III.
Mr. Gleacher, who worked at Lehman Brothers before moving to
Morgan Stanley in the mid-1980s, plans to interview some of
the Morgan Grenfell people and may hire a few for his own
operation.</p>
<p>Though several U.S. merger boutiques have sold stakes to
Japanese partners, Mr. Gleacher's is one of the first to link
up with a European partner.</p>
<p>Unlike U.S. banks, Deutsche Bank is both a commercial bank
and an investment bank. It has large money management
operations and an insurance company, and it holds big stakes
in many of West Germany's biggest corporations.</p>
<p>For example, the bank owns 28.2% of Daimler-Benz AG, one
of West Germany's largest manufacturing companies, and 10% of
Allianz AG, Europe's biggest insurer. Some bankers contend
that because of these links, Deutsche Bank has the best
client list in Europe.</p>
<p>At year end, Deutsche Bank had assets of 344 billion marks
($212.5 billion) and through various subsidiaries, including
Morgan Grenfell, had 125 billion marks under management. The
bank's shareholder equity totals about $10.1 billion.</p>
<p>Behind Deutsche Bank's latest step is the planned 1992
abolition of trade and investment barriers among the 12
countries of the European Community. Merger activity in
Europe has been accelerating as companies attempt to position
themselves for a bigger but more competitive European market.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank also has moved aggressively along with its
corporate clients into Eastern Europe, particularly East
Germany, since the Soviet bloc began crumbling late last
year.</p>
