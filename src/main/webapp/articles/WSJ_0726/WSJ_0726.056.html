	<p class="article-leader">Digital Equipment Corp. reported the first net loss in its
32-year history after a $400 million charge for severance and
other costs in its fourth quarter, ended June 30.
   The No. 2 computer maker also reported a 3.7% revenue
decline as business in previously robust European markets
slowed unexpectedly. Digital, like many other established
computer makers, has suffered in the past year as customers
held down spending and switched some of their purchases to
personal computers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although Maynard, Mass.-based Digital's results were worse
than most analysts had forecast, Digital's stock dropped only
slightly. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
Digital was down 62.5 cents at $74.875 on volume of more than
1.1 million shares.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors approved of Digital's plan to cut
an additional 5,000 to 6,000 jobs and that they look for an
upturn in future quarters.</p>
<p>Looking to fiscal 1991, "I think we'll see steadily
improving results, with the biggest improvement in the second
half," said Marc Schulman, an analyst with UBS Securities.</p>
<p>John Smith, Digital's senior vice president, said, "We're
fairly optimistic about the future. It definitely will come
back. The question is how fast."</p>
<p>Digital reported a net loss for the quarter of $256.7
million, or $2.11 a share, after taking the $400 million
pretax charge. Without the charge, Digital said, net income
would have been $85.3 million, or 68 cents a share. Many
analysts had predicted earnings of about $1 a share before
any restructuring charge. A year earlier, Digital had net of
$313.2 million, or $2.51 a share.</p>
<p>Digital's results reflected an unexpectedly large revenue
decline to $3.37 billion from $3.49 billion. Sales of
computers and other products dropped 8.4% to $2.06 billion,
while service revenue rose narrowly.</p>
<p>The $400 million charge will pay for retraining and
relocating workers for new jobs and providing severance pay
for 5,000 to 6,000 who choose a severance option. Digital
announced a $150 million charge in April for voluntary
severance programs, and the programs have resulted in the
departure of about 3,000 workers, Digital said. Currently
Digital has about 124,000 workers. Mr. Smith said the firm
plans to reduce the work force to about 119,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith said the new severance programs are likely to be
less generous than the past one, which provided as much as
two years' pay for senior employees as well as health and
stock benefits. However, he said, the company will maintain
its practice of avoiding layoffs. He said, "We don't
contemplate any further restructuring costs."</p>
<p>Mr. Smith warned that the staff reduction won't have its
full cost-cutting impact until the end of fiscal 1991.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1990, Digital's net fell 93% to $74.4 million,
or 59 cents a share, after $550 million in restructuring
charges. In fiscal 1989, Digital had net of $1.07 billion, or
$8.45 a share. Revenue rose 1.6% to $12.94 billion from
$12.74 billion.</p>
<p>Looking at the weak sales, stock analysts promptly cut
their earnings estimates for fiscal 1991. Jay P. Stevens of
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., who recommends Digital stock, cut
his estimate to $7.25 a share from $8. Steven Milunovich of
First Boston Corp., who doesn't recommend the stock, cut his
estimate to $5.50 a share from $6.80.</p>
<p>Analysts were especially worried by Digital's statement
that sales in continental Europe were weaker than expected in
the fourth quarter. While its U.K. business had been
depressed by high interest rates, other European countries
were a bright spot for Digital and most other computer makers
until now. Digital got 56% of its revenue outside the U.S. in
fiscal 1990.</p>
<p>Bulls on Digital say the company is entering a product
cycle that will boost earnings. The company said production
problems with the VAX 9000, a mainframe that was sold to a
few customers in June, have been solved. Mr. Smith said
Digital expects to ship 100 of the new machines this quarter
and more in future quarters. The early models have an average
selling price of about $1.2 million, although when more
expensive models are on sale by the end of December, Digital
has said, the average selling price will be about $1.6
million.</p>
<p>Digital could use the boost. Its revenue from high-end
products has dwindled as customers waited for the new
machines.</p>
<p>Digital said its VAX 4000 series, announced this month, is
selling strongly. Mr. Smith said shipments of engineering
workstations "are doing better than we anticipated" and that
midrange systems "seem to be hanging in there."</p>
<p>Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. downgraded
Digital's long-term debt rating to double-A-2 from triple-A.
The downgrade, which covers about $100 million of 12 5/8%
senior long-term notes due in 1994, reflects a Moody's
opinion that "Digital's earnings will be under stress over
the intermediate term as it reorganizes its operations in
line with slowed revenue growth, thinner margins and a change
in the product mix."</p>
<p>Moody's said Digital's balance sheet "remains
exceptionally strong." Digital has $2 billion in cash, and
its current assets are more than twice current liabilities. A
Digital spokesman said the Moody's move "doesn't surprise
us," as the rating concern "had held conversations with us."</p>
