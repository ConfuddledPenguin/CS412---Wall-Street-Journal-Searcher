	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Federal regulators told Equimark Corp. they
will request reimbursement for expenses the bank holding
company charged the federal government while managing an
insolvent Texas bank.
   Equimark charged the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. more
than $10 million for its nine-month management of National
Bancshares Corp. of Texas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among the alleged expenses is a charge of about $1,400,
apparently for transporting from Pittsburgh to Texas a 1962
black Rolls-Royce owned by Equimark Chairman Alan S.
Fellheimer.</p>
<p>FDIC Chairman William Seidman said that until the agency
reviews Equimark's records, he isn't sure how much Equimark
will be asked to reimburse. "But it may run into the
millions," he said. "There are a lot of questions about the
kinds of things that were charged when then were running
{National Bancshares} on our behalf."</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer vigorously denied that Equimark charged the
government with any improper expenses, and he said he
personally paid for transporting his Rolls-Royce. The bill
was less than $1,000, he said.</p>
<p>"We're prepared to back with documentation every nickel we
charged them," Mr. Fellheimer said.</p>
<p>The FDIC, however, said Equimark incurred "questionable
expenses" for lodging, travel and a data processing system it
installed at National Bancshares. Alan J. Whitney, an FDIC
spokesman, said the agency sent Mr. Fellheimer a letter July
17 requesting documentation for expenses incurred in San
Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>Regulators first informed Mr. Fellheimer in April that
they planned to request documentation about expenses, Mr.
Whitney said.</p>
<p>Among other things, the inquiry seems to center on bills
run up by Equimark employees who shuttled between Pittsburgh
and San Antonio. Most stayed in hotels.</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer contended that he hadn't yet received the
FDIC letter and said regulators make frequent requests for
increased documentation.</p>
<p>The inquiry is the latest problem in Equimark's failed
attempt to acquire National Bancshares in a $116 million
federally assisted buy-out. The acquisition was to be the
centerpiece of Mr. Fellheimer's driving ambition to expand
the bank beyond Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The attempt proved costly. The deal collapsed in April
when National Bancshares' bondholders rejected the offer and
regulators refused to allow Equimark to sweeten the deal.
Consequently Equimark took a $3.7 million charge for employee
severance packages and other items.</p>
<p>The FDIC request comes at a time when Mr. Fellheimer is
under increasing criticism from Equimark directors. In May,
the board deliberated for six hours over whether he would
keep his job. While they voted to retain Mr. Fellheimer, he
must stem losses from bad real-estate and consumer loans and
ill-fated acquisitions in Idaho and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>In the second quarter Equimark had a loss of $29.8 million
before one-time gains from the sale of a credit-card unit. In
the past 12 months, its share price has fallen more than 60%.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Equimark shares closed at $5.125, unchanged.</p>
<p>Regulators aren't the only ones to raise eyebrows over the
$10 million payment. At a U.S. bankruptcy court hearing in
San Antonio earlier this month, National Bancshares creditors
gasped when they learned the bank had paid that much money,
and banking experts have said the amount seems extravagant.</p>
<p>National Bancshares executives have said the fees were
determined in a contract between the FDIC and Equimark. While
National Bancshares technically paid Equimark, in effect it
was FDIC money because the Texas bank was insolvent.</p>
<p>While Equimark ran National Bancshares, it instituted an
aggressive marketing campaign, set up a telephone loan line
and threw customer parties at bank branches and country
clubs.</p>
