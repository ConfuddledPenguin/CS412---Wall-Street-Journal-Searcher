	<p class="article-leader">British Aerospace PLC said it will appeal the European
Community Commission decision ordering the British company to
repay subsidies that it received when it bought Rover Group
in July 1988.
   Initially, British Aerospace said it would accept the
commission's decision on repayment of #44.4 million ($80.6
million) of so-called sweeteners. But after what the company
termed "a careful review" and independent professional
advice, it said it must protect shareholders' interests and
test its rights before the European Court of Justice.</p>

shareholders of its decision.</p>
