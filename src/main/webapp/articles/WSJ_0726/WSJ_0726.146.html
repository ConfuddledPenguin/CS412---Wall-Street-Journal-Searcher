	<p class="article-leader">The U.K. Department of Trade and Industry gave British
Airways the green light to participate in a planned linkup
with Sabena World Airlines.
   The decision followed a U.K. Monopolies and Mergers
Commission investigation that found that a British Airways
20% stake in the new unit of Sabena S.A., which is 53%-owned
by the Belgian government, wouldn't be against the public
interest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the Sabena World venture, which also involves KLM
Royal Dutch Airlines taking a 20% stake, continues to face
objections from the European Community. Last month, the EC
Commission said that some aspects of the three-airline accord
could violate EC competition rules and potentially could harm
consumers.</p>
<p>Sabena World has yet to respond to the commission's
objections, according to Johan Dekker, the unit's chief
executive officer. The company probably will do that next
month, he said, but it doesn't expect to offer to amend the
agreement with the other two carriers.</p>
