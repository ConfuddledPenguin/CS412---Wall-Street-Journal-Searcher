	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Budget negotiators appear unlikely to meet
their goal of reaching a deficit-reduction agreement before
Congress begins its August recess.
   Frustrated with the progress, President Bush in private
meetings raised the possibility of asking Congress to delay
its vacation. But leaders in Congress have asked him not to
take that action, and instead may convene summit talks during
the break.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The budget summit negotiators had hoped to reach an
agreement before the Aug. 3 beginning of the recess. But
congressional and administration officials now say that is
extremely unlikely. "It would take a miracle," said Chairman
Leon Panetta (D., Calif.) of the House Budget Committee.</p>
<p>Congressional leaders advised the president not to take
the dramatic step of asking Congress to stay at work because
it would probably antagonize lawmakers more than foster
compromise. Instead, they discussed the possibility of having
the administration and congressional leaders continue talking
while Congress is away.</p>
<p>The betting on Capitol Hill is that Congress will begin
its month-long vacation on time. Budget Director Richard
Darman declined to comment, but another White House official
said the president was "very serious" about his suggestion of
keeping Congress in session.</p>
<p>House Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois quoted Mr.
Bush as asking, "Does it help any if I say you ought to stay
here if you don't get this agreement?" Mr. Michel also quoted
the president saying: "I want to make progress, I want to get
something going."</p>
<p>"We told him the August thing is sacrosanct. He
understands that," Mr. Michel said. He also noted that it
might not make sense to keep the whole Congress in session
before an agreement is reached among the leaders.</p>
<p>"It could be that we are hung up on three or four major
clumps of disagreement . . . and that we've got to have the
summit come back during August to try to get it completed,"
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) said after
meeting with the president.</p>
<p>Early in the day, Rep. Gephardt and White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that administration and
congressional negotiators this week hope to trade
deficit-reduction packages aimed at paring the fiscal 1991
deficit by $50 billion. Mr. Fitzwater said the two sides
planned to introduce their proposals simultaneously, but
Democrats said they hadn't agreed to that.</p>
<p>Staffers later were saying that such an exchange might not
occur soon, partly because Democrats and, to a lesser extent
Republicans, are having trouble reaching agreement among
themselves. If proposals are made soon, participants in the
talks said they are more likely to be refinements of opening
bargaining positions than major moves toward compromise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the House Ways and Means Committee voted to
extend the federal borrowing limit. Congress will need to
raise the borrowing limit before it goes on recess. The panel
approved two versions of the debt-ceiling bill. One would
extend the limit until Oct. 15, and the other would extend
the ceiling through fiscal 1991. The short-term extension is
the more likely outcome, raising the limit to $3.195 trillion
from $3.122 trillion.</p>
<p>The committee also voted, at the urging of Rep. Byron
Dorgan (D., N.D.), to ask the House Rules Committee to permit
a vote on the House floor to remove the Social Security Trust
Fund from the calculations that go into the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law. That amendment would be placed on the
long-term extension.</p>
<p>Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) said he
hoped any amendments that are added to the legislation be
attached to the long-term extension and that the short-term
extension be passed amendment free.</p>
