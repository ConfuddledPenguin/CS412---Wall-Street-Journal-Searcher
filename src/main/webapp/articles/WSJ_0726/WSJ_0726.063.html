	<p class="article-leader">A month after he staved off financial ruin by getting his
bankers to lend him $65 million, Donald Trump is about to ask
his casino bondholders for a similar financial favor.
   Mr. Trump and his advisers have tentatively decided to
propose to holders of all or part of the $1.3 billion in debt
to accept equity in his casinos in exchange for letting him
cancel some interest payments, people close to the situation
say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If bondholders approve the proposal, they would receive
stock in a Trump entity that would be traded, making it
possible for the public to own a piece of Donald Trump. Mr.
Trump has retained Merrill Lynch & Co. to explore this and
other options in Atlantic City, N.J., those people close to
the situation say.</p>
<p>What ails Mr. Trump's casinos is the same thing that
forced him to restructure some $2 billion of bank debt last
month: His properties are not earning enough cash to pay the
interest on their debt. Within the next year, Securities and
Exchange Commission documents show, Mr. Trump will have to
come up with about $210 million in interest and principal
payments. The next payment is $47 million in interest due Taj
Mahal bondholders Nov. 15. Analysts say that based on the
casinos' performances in the busy summer months, it is
unlikely that Mr. Trump will be able to raise the money
needed.</p>
<p>Figures obtained by this newspaper indicate the new Trump
Taj Mahal had a pretax operating loss this past quarter of
about $15 million. That figure doesn't include about $75
million owed contractors on the project, nor does it account
for an estimated $30 million still needed to finish the
facility. The operating loss also doesn't include pre-opening
expenses that were deferred in the Taj Mahal's SEC filing for
the first quarter.</p>
<p>Results at Mr. Trump's other two casinos, Trump Plaza and
Trump's Castle, also are expected to be down from last year's
already weak levels. The second-quarter figures are required
to be filed with the SEC by mid-August.</p>
<p>In June, Mr. Trump narrowly escaped defaulting on payments
to Trump's Castle bondholders when banks agreed to lend him
$20 million with a commitment for $45 million more. That
agreement followed weeks of marathon negotiations with about
90 banks that had lent Mr. Trump money, often on the strength
of no more than his personal guarantee.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump declined to comment on plans for his casinos.
But in a telephone interview he said he remains confident in
the strength of his company. "I think the banks are extremely
impressed with what they've seen {of the Trump
Organization}," he said. "This is a great company, it will be
around a long time."</p>
<p>He complained that too much attention was being paid to
his recent troubles. "They {the media} don't write about any
other company but me," he said. "I haven't missed a payment."</p>
<p>Some people who work for Mr. Trump see the casinos' poor
performance as a sign that Mr. Trump's marital and financial
troubles are taking a toll on his image.</p>
<p>"Caesars has positioned itself as the high-roller house,
the Claridge is supposed to be the gambler's casino, Harrah's
has the drive-in families, and Donald has always had the
glamour," said one individual familiar with Mr. Trump's
operations. "And it's tough to be glamorous when you're
restructuring."</p>
<p>Mr. Trump said the casinos are not performing up to par
because the entire Northeast U.S. economy is suffering. He
said his competitors' results are also down from a year ago.</p>
<p>But with the highly public bank restructuring behind him,
Mr. Trump's margin for error is thinner than his
competitors'. Unlike the banks, the casino bondholders hold
first mortgages on all his properties. That means that if he
defaults, the bondholders could end up owning the casinos.
That fact could give the bondholders less incentive to
compromise.</p>
<p>But Mr. Trump said bondholders would benefit little in the
short run if they forced him to default. "If the bondholders
ever did that, they'd be in court for years," he says. And,
Mr. Trump emphasized, he is still current on his bond
payments.</p>
<p>Mark Brostowski, a casino analyst with Salomon Brothers
who issued a negative report on Mr. Trump's bonds in January,
said it is clear from current revenue that it would be
difficult for Mr. Trump to make all of his bond payments over
the next 12 months. But in a restructuring, Mr. Brostowski
said, it also would be tough for Mr. Trump to convince
bondholders to sacrifice a great deal unless he is willing to
relinquish major chunks of his equity.</p>
<p>"It will all depend on what he offers them," Mr.
Brostowski said. "The bondholders will want to extract some
pain from Donald."</p>
<p>So far, bondholders haven't been formally contacted by the
Trump Organization, though New Jersey gambling officials have
been apprised of Mr. Trump's plans. Nevertheless, an exchange
offer probably wouldn't come as a surprise to wary owners of
the bonds, who have seen the Taj bonds trade for as low as 43
cents on the dollar. Traders quoted the bonds yesterday at 46
cents, down 2.25 cents.</p>
<p>An examination of the Taj's numbers indicate that the
facility, which opened to great fanfare in April, took in
about $1.2 million a day in casino revenue through the end of
June. That's a record for an Atlantic City casino, but falls
short of the $1.3 million a day some analysts said the casino
would need to break even. This month, the Taj is on a pace to
earn over $40 million, which Mr. Trump said would be a record
month for any casino. Traditionally, the summer months are
the strongest for Atlantic City casinos.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Trump said he is still negotiating with the
unpaid contractors to accept partial payment for their work.
He dismissed a question about when he would complete the
casino's pool, sauna, theater and restaurants. "Nothing in
life is finished," he said.</p>
