subsidiary was awarded a contract by Henkel Rika Sdn Bhd of
Malaysia to construct a palm-based fatty alcohol production
plant.

	<div class="article-body"><p>The 2.6-acre plant, scheduled for startup in the second
half of 1991, will be built as an addition to an existing
oleochemicals complex in Malaysia. Fatty alcohols are used in
the detergent industry, replacing products of petroleum
origin. Henkel Rika Sdn Bhd is a joint venture between Henkel
Oleochemicals Sdn Bhd of Malaysia, New Japan Chemical Co. of
Japan and Lucky Ltd. of Korea.</p>
<p>Separately, Fluor Daniel was awarded a contract, valued at
about $12 million, by Richmond Metropolitan Authority of
Virginia to build a 345,000-square-foot parking structure.
The nine-story structure, scheduled for completion in late
1991, will span a downtown expressway and provide parking for
1,000 cars.</p>

construction, maintenance and technical services company.</p>
