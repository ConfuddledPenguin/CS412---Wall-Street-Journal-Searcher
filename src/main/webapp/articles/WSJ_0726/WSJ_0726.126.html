	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate denounced Sen. David Durenberger
for "reprehensible" and "unequivocally unethical" conduct.
   As the Minnesota Republican sat with his arms crossed in
his usual seat in the front row of the chamber, the Senate
upheld the unanimous findings of its six-member, bipartisan
Ethics Committee. Ninety-six senators rose from their seats
to support the committee. Sen. Durenberger, and his Minnesota
GOP colleague, Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, voted present. Two
senators were absent for the vote.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The committee concluded that Sen. Durenberger "knowingly
and willingly" violated Senate limits on speaking fees and
gift limits by funneling them through his publisher, Piranha
Press; misled the Senate about his ownership of a Minneapolis
condominium in order to claim $65 a day in reimbursement when
he stayed there; and improperly allowed businesses and
organizations to provide him limousine services while he was
on personal business.</p>
<p>"I wish there were ambiguity here, but there is none,"
Sen. Howell Heflin (D., Ala.), chairman of the Senate Ethics
Committee, said. "I wish I could find innocence or, at most,
inadvertence or inattention or simple ignorance . . . but I
cannot."</p>
<p>Sen. Durenberger didn't contest the charges. He told his
colleagues, "It has been a costly education. I have reordered
my personal and professional priorities to be, first, a
better man and, then, a better senator."</p>
<p>The Senate directed Sen. Durenberger to repay the Senate
$29,050 plus interest and to donate to charity $93,730, minus
taxes he has already paid, in excess honorariums. It also
referred the matter to the Senate Republican caucus, which
could strip the senator of his seniority; Senate Minority
Leader Robert Dole (R., Kan.) has said he doesn't expect the
caucus to take any action.</p>
<p>Seven members of the Senate have been censured since the
first recorded case in 1811. One, Democratic Sen. Herman E.
Talmadge of Georgia, was denounced in 1979. Sen. Talmadge
lost his bid for re-election in 1980. Sen. Durenberger, who
has served in the Senate for 12 years, doesn't face
re-election until 1994.</p>
<p>The last major ethics case in the Senate involved New
Jersey Democrat Harrison A. Williams Jr., who resigned in
1982 as his colleagues were about to oust him for submitting
false expense vouchers and failing to report campaign
contributions.</p>
