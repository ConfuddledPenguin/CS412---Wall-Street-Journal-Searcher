	<p class="article-leader">Walk into just about any well-stocked record store and in
the "bands and marches" section, you'll find an excellent
selection of recordings by some of the world's finest
military bands. British bands, especially those of the Guards
regiments, are particularly well represented. But also
present are albums by such excellent ensembles as the French
Garde Republicaine, the West German army and even the Belgian
and Danish armies.
   But if you have a yen to hear the U.S. Marine Band play
the marches of their legendary bandmaster John Philip Sousa,
you might have to book a flight to Moscow, where the band was
touring recently. The same goes for the U.S. Army, Navy, Air
Force and Coast Guard bands.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That's because under a law dating back several decades,
Congress specifically forbids American military bands from
making records for commercial sale to the American public.
The few records they do make go to libraries or other
institutions. The law was enacted, apparently, because some
civilian bands feared they would be "undercut" by competition
from the service musicians.</p>
<p>"As far as I can tell, we are the only nation in the world
that has such a ridiculous law," says Barbu Alim, treasurer
of the American branch of the International Military Music
Society, a civilian organization of military music
afficianados that is pressing to have the law changed. "In my
own collection, I not only have albums from all the British
bands, but also the Bahamas, Surinam, Fiji, you name it.
Everyone, it seems, is anxious to let their military bands be
heard and appreciated world-wide except us."</p>
<p>The "peace dividend," however, might be coming to the
rescue of deprived military music lovers. Even in the salad
days of the Reagan military buildup, the cost of armed forces
musicians (about $200 million in fiscal 1991) was a subject
of grumbling on Capitol Hill. "Where is the balance in our
peacemaking efforts, when our budget is half that of military
marching band?" fumed then-Peace Corps Director Loret Miller
Ruppe in a fairly typical comment.</p>
<p>Rep. E. Clay Shaw (R., Fla.), however, has decided that,
instead of complaining, Congress should give the bands a shot
at earning their keep. He has introduced a bill that would
allow the military bands to sell records commercially if they
so choose. Any profit would go toward defraying the cost of
maintaining the bands.</p>
<p>"{The bill} would not require the bands to sell their
recordings," Mr. Shaw told a congressional hearing on his
bill earlier this month. "The bill stipulates that any
proceeds received from the sale of any of the recordings are
to be credited to applicable military appropriations for the
expenses of the bands. The bill could be amended to allow
other uses of the proceeds, such as service charities or
monuments."</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no organized opposition to the
Shaw bill, which has received an outpouring of support from
military music enthusiasts as far away as Japan, the
Netherlands and Australia. The American Federation of
Musicians, which has looked with suspicion on the idea for
years, now has many members among the service bands and, for
the moment, has taken no position.</p>
<p>The Defense Department has not yet expressed a formal
position on the Shaw legislation. "They probably have mixed
feelings," Mr. Alim says. "They would probably like to make
the records, but would have a hard time getting used to
relying on them as part of their means of support."</p>
<p>John Philip Sousa was the director of the U.S. Marine Band
when it made some of the very first recordings ever for
Thomas Edison in 1890. It seems a shame that today, most
Americans are faced with the choice of hearing the band in
live performance or not at all.</p>
