	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission, in a
move likely to change the way pension funds pay some Wall
Street bond commissions, voted to restrict some trading
arrangements used by money managers to buy securities.
   The SEC ruling could alter the business climate on Wall
Street by giving advantages to old-line firms. But many firms
think the ruling is a narrow decision that won't have much
effect on bond trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agency's interpretation focuses on so-called
soft-dollar deals, in which pension funds and others receive
credits from brokerage firms in exchange for trading
commissions. Much like frequent-flier miles, the credits can
be used to pay for research, computer services and client
referrals.</p>
<p>The SEC said pension-fund trades done through principals,
or firms that trade from their own positions, or trades using
futures aren't covered by a securities-law exemption that
allows broad use of soft dollars.</p>
<p>If a principal transaction uses soft dollars, the fund
manager could be in violation of Employee Retirement Income
Security Act laws administered by the Labor Department, which
had sought the SEC interpretation.</p>
<p>Still, the SEC left unanswered the broader questions of
soft-dollar use, which has been criticized by many Wall
Street firms as an area rife with abuses. The SEC said it
will try to tackle those issues later in the year.</p>
<p>In voting for the restriction, SEC Chairman Richard
Breeden stressed that the decision was a narrow clarification
of rules dealing with specific trades. He contended that it
wouldn't have a broad-based effect on soft-dollar business.</p>
<p>Frances Bermanzohn, general counsel at the Public
Securities Association and a staunch critic of soft dollars,
applauded the ruling as "promoting fiduciary duties to
protect investors and enhance market liquidity."</p>
<p>The Labor Department called the SEC move "a wonderful
result for pensioners and retirees." The agency had grown
concerned about the growing use of soft dollars under the
exemption, said David Ball, assistant secretary for the
department's Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration.
Some of the costs that should be absorbed by the pension
manager are being passed along to the plan beneficiaries, he
added.</p>
<p>But several brokerage firms and lawyers objected to the
SEC move. New York-based Lynch, Jones & Ryan, a soft-dollar
firm, called the SEC action a "naive" response in favor of
soft-dollar critics. The critics "are trying to leave it to
the regulators to limit their competition," said Stan
Chamberlin, the firm's chairman.</p>
<p>Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. wrote to the SEC urging that
principal transactions, trading in Nasdaq stocks and the use
of debt-securities trading to pay for debt-securities
research be allowed to continue with protection. Removing the
protection "will significantly impact the flexibility of the
investment manager in obtaining the information necessary to
make informed investment decisions," senior Shearson
officials wrote.</p>
<p>Moreover, Lee Pickard, a Washington lawyer who represents
soft-dollar clients, argued that the SEC ruling is "likely to
benefit the traditional investment banking firms and may well
reduce competition in the dealer area." Several large
investment banking firms don't engage in soft-dollar
transactions. He added, "It seems to me that the actions of
the commission are likely to have a broader impact than is
assumed. It may well shift business from one segment of the
securities industry to another segment."</p>
