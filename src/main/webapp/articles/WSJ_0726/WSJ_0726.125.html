	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Sumitomo Bank Ltd. said it plans to set up a bank
holding company in the U.S. that will house its American
non-commercial banking activities, specifically the bank's
trust-banking and capital-markets operations.
   The Japanese bank also said it planned to invest about
$320 million in establishing new units involved in leasing,
investment management and securities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, Sumitomo said that each of the three new
units will have a chief operating officer from the U.S. and
that "the bank will minimize the number of Japanese personnel
who will be engaged in the companies' management."</p>
<p>One of the advantages of a holding company's structure is
that it allows foreign financial institutions to create
separate legal entities, which can offer Americans such
positions as chairman and president.</p>
<p>Sumitomo said it has applied to Japan's Ministry of
Finance and to the Federal Reserve for approval of its plans.</p>
