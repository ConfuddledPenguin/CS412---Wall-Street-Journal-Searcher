	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- McDonald's numbers, like its food, have long
been synonymous with predictability.
   For 101 consecutive quarters, the burger behemoth reported
record results. So last Friday, when second-quarter earnings
came in just a penny a share below Wall Street expectations,
it was like getting a Big Mac without the pickle.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ensuing uproar sent the stock plummeting 12% in two
days, helping to trigger Monday morning's slump in the
broader market and whacking $1.6 billion from McDonald's
market value -- just a week after the stock hit a three-year
high of 38 1/2.</p>
<p>Now, with the stock at 33 1/4, unchanged yesterday, many
analysts are saying that McDonald's needs to be innovative
rather than predictable in battling two years of domestic
sales slippage to discount-minded competitors. Unconvinced
that McDonald's will respond effectively, some analysts are
reducing their earnings estimates and backing away from the
stock.</p>
<p>McDonald's, for its part, has said that it doesn't plan to
cut overall menu prices, and that it will promote occasional
bargains instead. For example, it announced that the price of
its "Happy Meal" for kids is dropping to $1.99 from about
$2.29.</p>
<p>Such moves aren't enough to thrill Caroline Levy, a
Shearson Lehman analyst. "They have a major market-share
problem domestically," she says. The analyst switched her
recommendation on McDonald's stock to "sell" from "neutral,"
saying, "The next 12 months are going to be tough."</p>
<p>A Montgomery Securities analyst, Michael Mueller, says he
is disappointed that McDonald's isn't addressing what he
calls the "core issues. {Though} price-value and consumer
tastes have shifted, . . . they're still assuming their
marketing programs will carry them forward. I think that's
the wrong solution."</p>
<p>Mr. Mueller, too, went to a "sell" from a "weak hold"
recommendation, after digesting McDonald's latest numbers. "A
lot of the restaurant chains I follow are doing very well,"
he notes. Another concern is the rising cost of opening a
typical McDonald's restaurant in the U.S. Mr. Mueller figures
this is about $1.6 million -- and increasing at a rate that
is much faster than sales.</p>
<p>While most of the U.S. outlets are operated by
franchisees, the company is putting an increasing amount of
its own money overseas. In the past year, McDonald's reduced
domestic company-operated restaurants by 26, and added 80
outside the U.S.</p>
<p>Foreign restaurants require more capital and take longer
to pay off, says Robert Renck of R.L. Renck & Co., which does
cash-flow analyses. He advises clients to sell McDonald's
stock, because "we are concerned about the ability of the
company to generate excess cash flow while on a slower growth
track." Mr. Renck admits being surprised to learn that
"despite 25 years of unblemished growth in earnings, the
company has never generated positive corporate cash flow
after capital expenditures." Company officials couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>But this overseas activity is what Michigan's treasurer,
Robert Bowman, says gives him "comfort" that McDonald's
continues to represent a good buy. The state holds about 5.3
million shares. "McDonald's is not an American corporation,
it's an international corporation, and we look to the foreign
sales, where it has grown almost 25% a year," Mr. Bowman
says. "We're very bullish on the stock."</p>
<p>Still, Leslie Steppel, an analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities, notes that international sales represent only
one-third of the company's business. She has lowered her 1991
profit estimate by a nickel to $2.45 a share, "based on soft
{U.S.} sales trends and the fact that I think it will take
them longer to recover." She is holding to her estimate of
$2.20 for this year, though the quality of the latest
earnings "was much worse than what I was looking for."</p>
<p>Capital Supervisors Inc., a Chicago-based institutional
investor, recently completed selling most of a 3.3
million-share McDonald's stake, in part because of what Mark
Cremonie, equity manager, calls "all the Eastern-bloc hype"
about U.S. companies striking it rich. "The mindset out there
is that it'll be just like putting up a bunch of McDonald's
in Cleveland," he says. "This is a multidecades process -- if
it ever works out." McDonald's plans to open its first outlet
in East Germany within a few months.</p>
<p>McDonald's has been such a good bet for so long, some
analysts are reluctant to abandon it now. G. Michael Kennedy
of IDS Financial Services concedes he would like to see
McDonald's give up some profit margin for higher customer
traffic, but adds, "I don't see a big downside risk." He
remains optimistic that the company eventually will come up
with a successful dinner menu.</p>
<p>A Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood analyst, Richard Pyle,
continues to rate the stock a "buy." He says he is "willing
to ride with it another four quarters without a new product
-- if they have some success with being a little more
promotional."</p>
