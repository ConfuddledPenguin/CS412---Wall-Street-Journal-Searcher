	<p class="article-leader">Orlando Bosch is a Cuban, convicted felon, a man once
charged with masterminding the bombing of a civilian airliner
in which 73 people died. On July 17 he was paroled in Miami
and is now, somewhat relatively speaking, a free man. He has
to wear an electronic ankle trace bracelet, can go outside
only three hours a day, must not speak to anti-Castro
militants, and has his phone tapped.
   Joe Doherty is an Irishman, neither charged with nor
convicted of any offense against U.S. criminal law. On June
18 he began his eighth year in a tiny cell in the
Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan; he is now the
longest-held prisoner in the history of that institution. No
less than eight times -- most recently only a few weeks ago
in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit -- he has
prevailed in court and Immigration and Naturalization Service
hearings against attempts by the U.S. government to deport
him.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet today, Bosch is free on parole and Doherty, denied
bail, is confined to a matchbox cell in a prison never
designed for long-term occupancy, hence offering none of the
facilities other prisons are compelled to offer. See the
double standard maintained by the Bush administration eager
to pander to political friends in Miami's Cuban-American
community, and in London.</p>
<p>Start with Bosch. In 1968, his anti-Castro group Accion
Cubana blew up a Japanese freighter in Tampa, damaged a
British vessel off Key West and bombed eight diplomatic or
tourist offices in New York and Los Angeles. The aim was to
punish nations doing business with Cuba. Bosch was convicted
that same year of firing a bazooka at a Polish freighter in
Miami harbor and sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. He
was paroled four years later and in 1974 fled the country
rather than honor a subpoena in a murder case. Though both
the Venezuelan and Costa Rican governments offered to send
him back as a parole violator, the Justice Department
exhibited no interest in his return.</p>
<p>In June 1976, Bosch's Accion Cubana met in the Dominican
Republic with other emigre organizations such as Alpha 66.
They issued a "war communique" saying Cuban civilian
airliners would be attacked. Later that year a Cubana
airliner, en route from Venezuela to Havana, blew up in
mid-air shortly after a takeoff in Barbados; 73 civilians
died, including all of Cuba's Olympic fencing team.</p>
<p>Venezuela arrested Bosch and three others and charged them
with the bombing. Bosch and two others were convicted then
subsequently acquitted on appeal, but nonetheless held in
prison. The other accused, Luis Posada Carriles, had escaped.
In view of the Bush administration's later clemency toward
Bosch, we should note that during the Iran-Contra scandal,
Posada surfaced in the Ilopango base in El Salvador, working
alongside President Bush's old CIA buddy Felix Rodriguez in
funneling illegal arms shipments to the Nicaraguan Contras.
Mr. Bush was CIA director at the time Bosch and his confreres
were hatching terror schemes in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>On his release from a Venezuelan prison in 1987, Bosch
announced he was ready to "rejoin the struggle" and,
regarding the Cubana bombing, that "all of Castro's airplanes
are warplanes." In 1988 he was released and returned to the
U.S., where he was arrested as a parole violator. Cuba
applied to have him deported to face proceedings, but the
application was denied on the grounds that Bosch would not
get a fair trial. In rejecting Bosch's request for political
asylum in January 1989, the acting associate attorney general
wrote that "For 30 years Bosch has been resolute and
unwavering in his advocacy of terrorist violence. . . . He
has repeatedly expressed and demonstrated a willingness to
cause indiscriminate injury and death."</p>
<p>In July, after a campaign by Cuban emigres in Miami in
which President Bush's son Jeb expressed his support, Bosch
was granted parole.</p>
<p>Joe Doherty was imprisoned on June 18, 1983, for having
entered the U.S. illegally. The British government sought his
extradition on charges arising from the shooting death of a
member of the S.A.S., the British commando unit. In 1984,
federal district Judge John Sprizzo held that Doherty could
not be extradited under the then-existing treaty and,
addressing himself explicitly to the death of the S.A.S. man,
said that "The death of Captain Westmacott, while a most
tragic event, occurred in the context of an attempted ambush
of a British army patrol. It was the British response to that
action that gave rise to Captain Westmacott's death. Had this
conduct occurred during the course of more traditional
military hostilities there could be little doubt that it
would fall within the political offense exception."</p>
<p>Though the history of Joe Doherty's legal battles is long,
it is also simple. He has prevailed repeatedly in court
battles and in Board of Immigration Appeal hearings. Under
U.S. law he merits asylum, and should not be deported to the
U.K., where he would not have the certainty of a fair trial.
The force of this latter point was of course much enhanced
last year by the revelations of perversions of justice in the
case of the "Guilford Four," released after many years in
prison when a panel of British judges ruled their convictions
were not "safe." Nonetheless, Attorney Generals Edwin Meese
and now Richard Thornburgh have repeatedly controverted both
federal courts and Board of Immigration Appeals decisions,
and ordered Doherty's deportation, thus seeking to circumvent
the law on asylum. As Rep. Henry J. Hyde wrote to Mr.
Thornburgh in May: "I believe the handling of this case
involves an indefensible violation of the spirit, if not the
letter, of the basic guarantees of equal justice and due
processes of law. . . . The United States has never, ever,
handled an extradition or deportation case the way it has
handled this one."</p>
<p>On June 29, a federal appeals court panel granted Doherty
the right to apply for asylum here, thus handing the Justice
Department yet another setback. The judges concluded that Mr.
Thornburgh's reversal of his own INS Appeals Board decision
had been improperly influenced by geopolitical and
foreign-policy considerations. Though ample sureties have
been offered, Doherty's lawyer, Mary Pike, received her copy
of the Justice Department's letter to a New York judge urging
denial of bail to Doherty on the same day Orlando Bosch was
released.</p>
<p>So Doherty can't get bail, even though he manifestly
doesn't want to flee, given that he is litigating his ability
to stay in the U.S. Bosch got 10 years for bombing a Polish
vessel and for conveying by telegraph threats to the
president of Mexico and Prime Minister Harold Wilson. He
violated parole and became a fugitive under U.S. law. Despite
this, Bosch is released and Doherty held in his cell. The
Irishman should hispanicize his name, make more influential
friends in Miami and start threatening Fidel Castro. This is
the essential extrajudicial factor he has overlooked.</p>
