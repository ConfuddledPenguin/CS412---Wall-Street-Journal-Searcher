	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors nudged stock prices higher, and did
so in a way that suggests their appetite may be waning for
some of the consumer-products growth stocks that led the
market's recent rally.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.42 points in
active trading to 2930.94. Bond prices gained and the dollar
strengthened in response to data indicating the U.S. economy
isn't picking up steam.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The stock market derived much of its support from a
rebound in technology stocks and strength in industrial
materials and precious metals issues. For example, Alcoa,
Phelps Dodge and Union Carbide all posted gains, while
consumer stocks such as Coca-cola, Pepsi-Co and Philip Morris
fell.</p>
<p>Joseph McAlinden, director of equity research at Dillon
Read, predicted that for the rest of the summer technology
and natural-resources stocks -- along with energy stocks,
which fell yesterday on profit-taking -- will push the market
higher. He said he expects these groups to take turns
bolstering broad market measures.</p>
<p>The sharp drop in the stock market Monday "was a decisive
crack in the one-decision stocks," Mr. McAlinden said,
referring to the relatively few reliable growth stocks about
which the only decision is to buy. The turning point was
McDonald's earnings report Friday; profits were one cent a
share shy of some analysts' estimates. "So now we're getting
some pickup in stocks that do well in an inflationary
environment," he said, which is less favorable for growth
companies.</p>
<p>The rise in bond prices -- up three-eighths of a point, or
$3.75 for each $1,000 face amount -- was sparked by a
weaker-than-expected durable-goods orders in June. Helping
sustain the market's advance was a comment later in the day
from one Federal Reserve governor, which traders interpreted
to mean the Fed will continue to favor fighting inflation
over preventing recession.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose on volume of 163.5 million shares in New
York Stock Exchange trading. Advancing issues outnumbered
decliners, 895 to 583.</p>
<p>Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.54%.</p>
<p>The dollar gained. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6250 marks and 149.89 yen, compared with
1.6215 marks and 148.78 yen Tuesday.</p>
