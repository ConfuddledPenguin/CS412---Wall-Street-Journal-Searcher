	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Ways and Means Committee sent to
the House floor, without recommendation, legislation
requiring import quotas on textiles, apparel and footwear.
   The action, by voice vote, signals both reservations by
key members of the panel and the futility of opposition at
this stage. The House is expected to pass the measure easily,
and the Senate passed a similar bill last week, 68-32. The
real test will come after an expected veto by President Bush.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bill would set up a new system of quotas to restrict
imports of textiles, apparel and footwear from all foreign
suppliers except Canada and Israel.</p>
