	<p class="article-leader">Saskatchewan Oil & Gas Corp., or Saskoil, said it had
agreed to acquire certain Saskatchewan oil and gas assets of
Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. for about 38.2 million Canadian
dollars (US$33 million).
   Saskoil of Regina, Saskatchewan, said the effective date
of the purchase is April 1, though completion of the proposed
transaction is still subject to various conditions. It is
expected to close by Aug. 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Saskoil said the assets include Gulf Canada's working
interests, ranging from 25% to 100%, in seven major heavy-oil
producing areas, plus other minor producing areas, and a
pipeline. The purchase would raise Saskoil's net daily oil
output by about 4,700 barrels, to 31,000 barrels.</p>
<p>Gulf Canada, based in Calgary, Alberta, is a large oil and
gas producer that is controlled by Toronto's Reichmann
family.</p>
