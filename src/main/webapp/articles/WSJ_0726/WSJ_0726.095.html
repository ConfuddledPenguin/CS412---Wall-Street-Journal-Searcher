	<p class="article-leader">Seattle -- There is a dearth of work for lady boxer
critics, but I finally got an assignment. I slipped on my
blue satin jacket with the Knott Street Boxing Gym logo on
the back, tucked my notebook under my right tricep, but left
my boxing gloves behind. At the Goodwill Arts Festival I
would need my hands free to take notes and to applaud the
admirable skills of a couple of lady dancers who, at least
for the eight-day run of "Boxiana," double as lady boxers.
   For a work such as this, which combines dance with boxing,
it is good to have a lady boxer critic on hand. The local
newspapers sent their dance critics to opening night, but I
would guess that I was the only critic there whose writing
hand had ever sunk a couple of inches into a heavy bag.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I knew I wasn't qualified to critique the dance element of
the show, which takes place in an actual boxing ring and is
meant to replicate a women's flyweight championship bout. My
experience as a dancer is a distant blur, but I do recall
that my mother made my costume.</p>
<p>As the star pupil in the Pound Away women's class ("Pound
away your frustrations and lose weight too]"), I was prepared
to scoff at the dancers' attempts to simulate boxing.</p>
<p>The performance began as the 14-member Seattle Pro Musica
Women's Voices set the mood by swigging beer and brawling in
bleacher seats at ringside. Later they would punctuate the
performance with lyrics suggesting either blood lust (the
line "Dogmeat dogmeat dogmeat" comes to mind) or spiritual
journey.</p>
<p>Two women sports announcers introduced the
fighter/dancers. A gymnast named Susan Galligan played Lady
Tiger, mother of two and the reigning champ. But it was
Georgia Ragsdale, playing the challenger, who made me sit up
and take notice. Ms. Ragsdale wrote and choreographed
"Boxiana," and it was soon clear that the performance was
more than just an artistic statement about violence or
spiritual journeys. It was a way for her to show off.</p>
<p>I couldn't blame her. All in all she's spent two years
preparing for this role. She became a fixture at Seattle's
Hillman City Boxing Gym, and usually was the only female on
the premises. She spent hours watching tapes of boxing bouts,
studying each boxer's style. Then she put all that she'd
learned into her show, so the audience was treated to every
step of the training of a boxer. But with the chorus singing
things such as, "Yielding is the Way of the Tao," and with
various women entering the ring to snake among the boxers
with yogalike movements, the boxing show took on many levels
of meaning.</p>
<p>At the center of it all was Ms. Ragsdale, bobbing and
weaving, shadowboxing, pounding the heavy bag, sparring with
a trainer (the only male in the show) and skipping rope. She
drew whistles and applause for her jump-roping, a display of
consummate skill that she made look even harder by having a
woman wearing boxing gloves punch her in the stomach every
time she missed.</p>
<p>We never did that in my Pound Away class. By comparison I
felt like a real wimp. (Quick] Somebody beat me up so I can
feel good about myself.) After the show I cornered Ms.
Ragsdale for a little shop talk. She told me she's just wild
about boxing, although her original intention was to use
boxing merely as a vehicle for blending art and athletics,
and as an attention-getter for a female production. She said
her view of boxing is "a lonely spiritual journey not
accepted by society."</p>
<p>She told me that she worked out at the boxing gym up to
three hours a day, six days a week, "to make this look easy."
She was trained every step of the way by a former
professional boxer. Eventually, she invested in her own wrist
wraps, sparring gloves and headgear.</p>
<p>"Headgear?" I asked. "You mean you got hit in the head?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," she answered breezily. "It gets your adrenaline
going. Makes you fight harder."</p>
<p>Now I really felt like a wimp. In my Pound Away class, the
slogan could have been, "Train 'em, don't brain 'em." The
coach was pretty easy on us, come to think of it.</p>
<p>Ms. Ragsdale is a former competitive tennis player with a
background in acting and choreography.</p>
<p>But she's a boxer now. And she's looking for a fight.</p>
<p>"I'm a starving artist," she told me. "Two months ago I
was on food stamps. I'm hungry enough to box professionally.
I need the money for groceries."</p>
<p>I punched her respectfully on the arm and wished her luck.</p>
<p>Now I'm about ready to throw in the towel as a lady boxer
critic. I never got the opportunity to scoff, which I was so
eager to do, because Ms. Ragsdale and even Ms. Galligan, who
trained only four months, probably could box circles around
me. But I guess it's not the first time a performer has known
more about a subject than the critic.</p>
<p>At least I was slightly more hip than the dance critics.
One wrote that "Boxiana" was Ms. Ragsdale's way of presenting
boxing as a form of barbarism that should have been outlawed
years ago. But I knew that's not true. I saw that gleam in
her eye.</p>
<p>Besides, we can't outlaw boxing. At least not until Ms.
Ragsdale earns some grocery money.</p>
