	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A successful cost-cutting program enabled Avon
Products Inc. to report a 20% gain in second-quarter earnings
on a revenue improvement of only 2%.
   Avon, a door-to-door seller of gifts, cosmetics and
accessories, earned $47.5 million, or 68 cents a share,
compared with $39.5 million, or 56 cents a share, a year
earlier. Sales were $793.3 million, compared with $777.7
million. Excluding 1989 revenue from the Parfums Stern
division, which Avon sold in January, sales increased 6%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although its U.S. revenue was up only 2%, domestic pretax
operating earnings increased 29%. Avon also said revenue
increased 10% in its international division, which includes
Europe, Latin America, Canada and the Pacific, but operating
profit was down 5%. The company said the division's pretax
earnings last year were inflated by a tax refund in Britain.
Excluding the 1989 refund, it said, Avon International pretax
earnings rose 5%.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Avon shares closed at $36.875, up 37.5 cents.</p>
<p>James Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive
officer, said he expects U.S. revenue will show gains for the
rest of the year. U.S. sales softened in the second half of
1989.</p>
<p>"Avon's business is gaining momentum," said Andrew Shore,
an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. "They've
succeeded in lowering their cost structure. It's fair to say
that the company is doing better than it has in some time."</p>
<p>Mr. Shore said that one of Avon's key challenges involves
increasing U.S. revenue. "You only have so many rabbits to
pull out of the hat," he said, referring to Avon's
cost-cutting program. "At some point they will have to prove
they can grow their business here."</p>
<p>The cost-cutting was evident in Avon's income statement.
Interest expenses dropped in the quarter to $24.1 million
from $28 million, reflecting a cut in Avon's debt to $645
million as of June 30 from $1.09 billion at the end of the
1989 second quarter. Marketing, distribution and
administrative expenses were reduced to $379.9 million from
$398 million.</p>
<p>"We like the stock because we expect to see further
cost-cutting and debt reduction," said Diana Temple, an
analyst with Salomon Brothers. "We're estimating that the
company will earn $2.65 {a share} this year and $3.15 next
year."</p>
<p>Robert Renck Jr., managing partner of R.L. Renck & Co., a
brokerage firm that owns Avon stock for its money-management
clients, also expressed confidence despite the current gloomy
outlook for most retailers.</p>
<p>"Avon is basically selling low-priced products which
people can afford even during a recession," he said. "People
can afford them. The economy isn't a major worry for me."</p>
<p>In the six months, Avon's net income rose 37% to $62.7
million, or 79 cents a share, from $45.7 million, or 51 cents
a share. Sales climbed 1% to $1.5 billion from $1.48 billion.</p>
