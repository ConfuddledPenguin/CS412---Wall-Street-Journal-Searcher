	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Sen. Arlen Specter asked the Internal
Revenue Service to begin an inquiry into possible violations
of U.S. anti-boycott laws by Baxter International Inc.
   In a letter to IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg last
week, the Pennsylvania Republican raised questions about
whether Baxter had cooperated illegally with the Arab boycott
of Israel or failed to provide required information on tax
forms about any Arab requests for participation in the
boycott. A spokesman for the IRS, which is required under the
Internal Revenue Code to help monitor companies' compliance
with U.S. anti-boycott law, declined to comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A separate investigation by the Commerce Department into
Baxter's Middle Eastern activities is continuing, as is an
informal inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission
into whether Baxter may have violated anti-bribery laws in
the Middle East.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an independent inquiry by the audit committee
of Baxter's board is expected to be completed by the end of
the year. "About the only thing I can tell you is that (the
investigation) is ongoing," Stephen N. Shulman, a New York
lawyer from the firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft who is
conducting the committee's inquiry, said in an interview. "I
am trying to touch everything that might be relevant."</p>
<p>Investigators are looking into Baxter's removal in 1989
from the Arab League's blacklist of corporations that do
business with Israel. Specifically, the government is trying
to determine whether Baxter's 1988 sale of an Israeli
subsidiary was related to any violation of U.S. anti-boycott
law or whether Baxter made any improper payments to win
removal from the blacklist. Jewish groups, including the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and the American
Jewish Congress, have raised questions about the sale.</p>
<p>Baxter has repeatedly and vigorously denied any wrongdoing
in connection with its removal from the blacklist. The
hospital supplier cites a recent joint venture with the
Syrian government to build an intravenous-fluids plant in
Syria as the apparent reason for its being taken off the
list.</p>
<p>Officials of Premier Hospitals Alliance Inc., a nationwide
cooperative of 45 teaching and research hospitals based in
Westchester, Ill., met last month with Baxter representatives
at the company's Deerfield, Ill., headquarters in connection
with questions about Baxter's Middle Eastern activities,
which were first reported in an article in The Wall Street
Journal May 1.</p>
<p>"We are doing as we would in any case where a business
partner is being investigated for illegal activities," said a
spokeswoman for Premier, which handles group purchasing,
among other things, for its members. Premier is conducting
its own inquiry and awaiting the outcome of the government
investigations before making any decisions on the matter, the
spokeswoman said.</p>
