	<p class="article-leader">Norfolk Southern Corp. reported second-quarter net income
declined 10%, as year-earlier results were helped by a gain
on the sale of trucking assets.
   The rail and road transportation company reported net for
the quarter of $155.9 million, or 95 cents a share, compared
with $173.7 million, or 99 cents a share, in the 1989
quarter. The Norfolk, Va., company said the year-earlier net
was a record for a second quarter. Revenue edged up to $1.18
billion, a second-quarter record, from $1.17 billion. Most of
the revenue is railway-derived; the company noted a 7.2%
increase in coal-shipment revenue, but a 3.2% drop in
merchandise shipping revenue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the six months, net was down 3.7% to $296.1 million,
or $1.79 a share, from $307.5 million, or $1.74 a share.
Revenue rose 1.4% to $2.32 billion from $2.29 billion.</p>
<p>The quarter and half results included a $13.6 million gain
from the sale of Norfolk's holding in Trailer Train Co.
Per-share results were better than the dollar amounts
indicated. The company said it is buying back about a million
shares a month under a 20 million-share program authorized
last fall. Shares outstanding total about 162.8 million, an
official said.</p>
