	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yesterday morning at 10:30, S.I. Newhouse,
chairman of Conde Nast Publications Inc., stood in front of
the staff of Woman magazine and delivered news it had feared
but expected: The magazine was closing.
   Meanwhile, across town, the U.S. unit of French publisher
Hachette S.A. announced it was giving up its attempt to
auction off Woman's Day, the mass-circulation magazine it put
up for sale in May. With advertising pages and circulation
falling off sharply, the bids from interested buyers
apparently came in well below the $200 million the French
were seeking.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Almost every consumer magazine is fighting its way through
a persistent advertising slump. But the folding of Woman and
the failure to sell Woman's Day indicate that the perennially
strong category of women's magazines is showing troubling,
long-term weakness. In the case of both magazines, the
publishers said even though there were interested buyers,
bankers were skittish about financing magazine acquisitions
in the uncertain climate.</p>
<p>"This is a tough business environment and getting
tougher," says Patricia Donnelly, vice president at Young &
Rubicam, who specializes in packaged goods clients, major
advertisers in women's magazines. "I would expect more
women's magazines to be faced with folding."</p>
<p>Both Woman and Woman's Day, like most magazines in the
category, have been hit by large declines in cigarette
advertising dollars and plummeting single-copy sales at
supermarket checkout stands and convenience stores. Tobacco
companies are traditionally heavy advertisers in women's
magazines, and women's magazines are the largest sellers at
checkouts.</p>
<p>But publishers learned the bad news last week that tobacco
company ad spending in consumer magazines has fallen 27% from
1989. And, according to Audit Bureau of Circulations figures,
total magazine circulation at newsstands and checkouts fell
14% between 1982 and 1989. Agency executives expect
single-copy sales will fall further in 1990.</p>
<p>The trouble in women's magazines is stretching across
several categories. Conde Nast's Vogue lost 10% of its ad
pages in the first half of 1990 because of tumult in the
retail and fashion industries, and ad pages at New York Times
Co.'s McCall's fell 13% as packaged goods companies slashed
their budgets. A couple of magazines continue to show
strength, including Hearst Corp.'s Good Housekeeping, where
ad pages rose 7% in the first half, and its Redbook, up 2%.
Some start-ups, such as News Corp.'s Mirabella and Hearst's
Victoria, are growing.</p>
<p>For Conde Nast, the failure of Woman is a major
disappointment. Mr. Newhouse bought the magazine in late 1988
for about $13 million to build strength at checkout counters,
where Woman sold 500,000 copies. But Woman was also an
attempt to reach beyond Conde Nast's usual upscale, affluent
audience to an older, more middle-of-the-road readership. The
average Woman reader was 35 years old, with a household
income of about $27,000.</p>
<p>In the first half, Woman's ad pages dropped 16%. According
to the most current circulation figures, newsstand and
checkout-counter sales dropped 14% in the 1989 second half
from a year earlier, with total circulation dropping 3.2% to
502,397. Staff members said the magazine had a loss of $8
million in 1989 and was expected to lose a similar amount
this year.</p>
<p>Conde Nast said it would try to hire as many Woman staff
members as possible. But Editor Pat Miller and Publisher
Rebecca Darwin haven't been offered new positions and will be
leaving the company.</p>
<p>The 53-year-old Woman's Day, meanwhile, remains
profitable, though its earnings are expected to decline
sharply this year. According to a publishing executive who
says he looked at Woman's Day's prospectus, Hachette
estimated the magazine's operating profit would fall to $15.9
million in 1990 from $25 million in 1989. Hachette says that
the $15.9 million figure is "not correct" and that earnings
will be higher but declines to be specific.</p>
<p>Hachette acquired Woman's Day as part of its 1988 purchase
of Peter Diamandis's Diamandis Communications Inc., now the
U.S. magazine subsidiary of Hachette. Mr. Diamandis, who was
reluctant to put the magazine up for sale in the first place,
says that the bids "did not reflect the true worth" of
Woman's Day. Daniel Filipacchi, vice chairman of Hachette,
says that the company will now turn to "investing its
considerable resources" in the magazine.</p>
<p>"We were able to find bidders, but the bidders were unable
to get bankers to go along with the price they wanted to
pay," Didier Guerin, president of Hachette Publications Inc.,
says. "Bankers don't want to lend the money the way they did
a year or two ago. They are more cautious."</p>
<p>Mr. Guerin says Hachette wanted to sell Woman's Day to
reduce the debt from its $712 million purchase of Diamandis.
But he adds: "Hachette doesn't have a debt problem. We are
able to meet all our obligations." Despite speculation that
Memories, another Diamandis magazine, would be put up for
sale, Mr. Guerin says no other magazines will be offered for
sale at this time.</p>
