said that fiscal 1990 group net profit rose from year-earlier
levels and that the company will leave its dividend unchanged
at 10 Deutsche marks ($6.18) a share.
   The large, West German reinsurance group didn't provide
detailed earnings data, but said premium income from
reinsurance business rose 1.6% to 12.6 billion marks in the
fiscal year that ended June 30 from 12.4 billion marks the
year before</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Overall, the fiscal 1990 result will prove to be
satisfactory," Munich Re said, adding that the strength of
the Deutsche mark had a negative impact on premium income
development. Without currency translation effects, total
group premium income actually increased more than 4%.</p>
