	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- In a surprise move, Massachusetts lawmakers are
considering repealing a tax package -- signed into law just
last week -- that levies a 5% sales tax on a host of business
services.
   Instead, legislative leaders are proposing to increase the
income tax to narrow the budget deficit. Whether opponents of
the sales tax can garner enough votes to repeal it remains
unclear, however, as confusion reigned at the state house.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The revised plan was proposed after state legislators, who
had dragged their feet on the recently enacted tax package,
balked at a compromise sought by Gov. Michael Dukakis to get
his $13.7 billion state budget approved earlier this week.</p>
<p>The about-face follows intense lobbying and legal threats
from professional and business groups -- including lawyers,
accountants, architects and engineers -- that are affected by
the new service tax.</p>
<p>The latest moves in Massachusetts underscore the crippling
opposition to service taxes that has arisen in various
states. Lobbyists recently have prevailed against similar
taxes in Florida and New York, among other states.</p>
<p>"We could have warned Massachusetts about this," said
state Rep. William Cibes, chairman of the Connecticut House
of Representatives finance committee, which last year
considered imposing a sales tax on all business and
professional services and then scaled back its plan to a
shadow of its original proposal. "Lobbying was intense, and
we anticipated heavy political reaction," he said. Several
lawmakers in that state are now considering withdrawing a
sales tax on architects and engineers.</p>
<p>Massachusetts, too, had watered down an earlier proposal
that would have taxed just about every business, excluding
financial, advertising and health services. In addition, the
recently enacted package included several amendments to
minimize out-of-state competition and soften the impact on
smaller firms. But many groups were upset that advertisers,
money managers and financial consultants were able to escape
taxation altogether, while they didn't.</p>
<p>"In addition to legal problems, the sales-tax plan was
unfair, in the opinion of many," commented Rudolph Pierce,
president of the Boston Bar Association. "For instance,
advertisers as a group arguably are doing better
{financially} than architects" hurt by New England's
real-estate slump, he said. "And some felt that financial
services ended up not getting taxed because Fidelity
{Investments} doesn't want to be taxed." Fidelity, based in
Boston, is the nation's largest mutual-fund investment
manager.</p>
<p>Lobbying efforts continued even after the bill was passed
last week. The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation Inc., which
represents many businesses, from biotechnology concerns to
heavy-industry manufacturers, "never gave up hope," said
Richard A. Manley, the organization's president. "Many of the
people we represent are just trying to keep body and soul
together. Our position is that the {newest} proposal will do
less damage to the state's economy than the one made law," he
said.</p>
<p>Under the plan submitted by Gov. Dukakis and approved by
the state House Ways and Means Committee yesterday, the
state's income tax would increase to 6.25% this year,
compared with the current rate of 5.75%.</p>
<p>Under the new plan, the sales tax on most services would
be repealed, except for a few areas. A 10-cent rise in the
gasoline tax wouldn't be touched.</p>
<p>The plan, which is similar to one proposed in the
Massachusetts House of Representatives earlier this year, is
likely to be approved by the House. And some think the state
Senate, eager to end the state's budget problems, would
probably follow suit.</p>
<p>Because the state is quickly running out of cash, and
Standard & Poor's bond-rating service is soon to complete a
review of the state's finances, both houses are expected to
act shortly.</p>
<p>Unless changed, the tax bill is slated to bring in several
million dollars more than the bill signed into law by Gov.
Dukakis last week. That measure would raise $1.2 billion this
fiscal year and $1.8 billion next fiscal year.</p>
