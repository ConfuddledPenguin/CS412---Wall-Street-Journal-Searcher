	<p class="article-leader">Despite declining yields, investors put another $2.4
billion into money market mutual funds in the latest week.
   Assets of 432 taxable funds totaled $384.8 billion at the
close of business Tuesday, according to IBC/Donoghue's Money
Fund Report. The average seven-day compound yield, which
assumes reinvestment of dividends, dipped to 7.88% from 7.95%
-- the lowest since November 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Martha Wittbrodt, editor of the Holliston, Mass.,
newsletter, predicted that yields will continue to slip in
the next few weeks, reflecting the Federal Reserve Board's
recent easing of interest rates. She said the decline in
money fund yields could be a 10th of a percentage point or so
over the next three to four weeks.</p>
<p>Average yields on taxable funds have been at or just below
8% for most of this year.</p>
<p>Average maturity of the taxable funds remained the same in
the week ended Tuesday, at 44 days. That is within the range
of the last few months; average maturity has been as short as
29 days and as long as 53 days in recent years. Money funds
invest in such things as short-term Treasury securities,
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and bank
certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.59% from 7.66%. The average 30-day simple yield
also eased, to 7.65% from 7.66%, and the average 30-day
compound yield dipped to 7.94% from 7.95%.</p>
<p>Yields on tax-exempt funds also declined. The average
seven-day compound yield of 227 tax-free funds eased to 5.21%
from 5.23%, Donoghue's reported. The latest yield is
equivalent to 7.24% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket
and 7.78% for someone paying 33% in taxes.</p>
<p>Assets of the tax-exempt funds decreased to $78.8 billion
from $78.9 billion. Average maturity remained at 51 days.</p>
