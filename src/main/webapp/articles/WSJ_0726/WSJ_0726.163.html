	<p class="article-leader">ST. LOUIS -- Anheuser-Busch Cos., with a 12% sales growth
reflecting a further increase in the company's dominant
market position, said second-quarter net income grew 10%.
   The brewer had earnings of $257.5 million, or 90 cents a
share, up from $233.7 million, or 82 cents a share. Net
sales, that is, sales after excise taxes, climbed to $2.78
billion from $2.48 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Anheuser-Busch rose $1.125 to $44.125.</p>
<p>The company's flagship Anheuser-Busch Inc. beer operation
shipped 22.3 million barrels to wholesalers in the latest
period, up 4.3% from the year-ago period and a 2.9% increase
from the first quarter.</p>
<p>August A. Busch III, chairman and president, said the
volume growth is "primarily attributable" to the company's
introduction of its Bud Dry and Busch Light products. Both
brands were introduced nationally in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The growth in shipments is a "very strong performance,"
said Kidder, Peabody & Co. analyst Roy D. Burry,
"particularly in light of the strong performances" by
competitors Adolph Coors Co. and the Miller Brewing unit of
Philip Morris Cos.</p>
<p>He said Anheuser's earnings increase was despite a three
to four cents a share dilution related to the $1.1 billion
acquisition last year of the Sea World theme park group.</p>
<p>Anheuser said trade-industry figures show its U.S. beer
market share in the year's first six months increased to
42.9% from 41.9%.</p>
<p>The company said its can-making unit had "greatly improved
earnings," rebounding from "depressed 1989 levels." In
addition, profit at the Campbell Taggart food operation
gained, reflecting higher volume and improved profit margins
in some lines, the company said.</p>
