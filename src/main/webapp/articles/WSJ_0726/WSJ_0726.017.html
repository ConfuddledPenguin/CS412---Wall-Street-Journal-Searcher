	<div class="article-body"><p>Spain's Banco Espanol de Credito said it had set up a
special line of credit to finance the purchase of paintings,
sculptures and antiques.</p>
<p>The credit line is the first of its kind in Spain and
reflects a growing interest in art as an investment, said
Fernando Falero, a Banesto manager. He said the credit line
was open-ended, but added that clients would be charged
interest of around 16%. Average bank-loan rates in Spain
stand at around 15%.</p>
<p>"There's no limit to how much we'll lend, within reason,"
Mr. Falero said. "If a client wants to purchase a Goya, we're
certainly willing to help fund the acquisition."</p>
<p>Mr. Falero said the fund would underwrite purchases of
both old masters' art and works created by new artists.
"We're primarily interested in paintings and sculpture," he
said.</p>
<p>JAPAN: WORLD'S LEADING INVESTOR</p>
<p>Japan has overtaken the U.S. to become the world's biggest
spender on new factories and industrial equipment, according
to a new study by the Washington-based Council of
Competitiveness, a group of 150 academics, union officials
and corporate executives. Despite an economy less than half
the size of the U.S., Japan spent $36 billion more on capital
investment in 1989 than the U.S.: $549 billion vs. $513
billion. "This marks the first time that any country has
out-invested the United States in plant and equipment in
absolute terms since World War II," the study said.</p>
<p>NEW ZEALAND IMMIGRANT FEE</p>
<p>New Zealand plans a levy on immigrants to pay for a fund
to help them settle into the country, Immigration Minister
Annette King said. The money, to be charged when an
immigrant's application for permament residence is accepted,
would pay for help including English language classes. The
fee has yet to be set but will be imposed soon. Refugees and
people entering on humanitarian grounds or to reunite with
relatives will be exempt.</p>
<p>PHILIPPINES WANTS DEBT RELIEF</p>
<p>The Philippines will seek debt relief from foreign
creditors to help recover from last week's earthquake,
President Corazon Aquino's spokesman said. The announcement
came amid growing pressure from Congress to suspend payments
of the $26 billion foreign debt to free funds for
reconstruction. The preliminary estimate of the damage
totaled 15.97 billion pesos ($697.4 million). "There are
various forms (of debt relief) that may be set . . . ranging
from the suspension of debt service to outright condonation,"
the spokesman said.</p>
<p>NEW SOVIET CURRENCY RULES</p>
<p>Soviet citizens will be allowed to spend foreign currency
at home beginning Aug. 1 without telling the government where
they got the money, the news agency Tass reported. Deputy
Prime Minister Stepan Sitarian said individual Soviets had
$324 million in foreign currency that they had legally
acquired but were unable to spend in the Soviet Union, except
at special shops for foreigners. Tass said under the new
rules, a network of stores and trade houses would be set up,
and Soviets would be able to buy "imported and high-quality
domestic goods."</p>
<p>BRITISH ROYALTY'S INCOME</p>
<p>Britain's royal family has been put on a fixed income
until the year 2000. Queen Elizabeth II will receive 7.9
million ($14.34 million) a year when the new system starts
next Jan. 1. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told Parliament
the fixed salary would replace the annual review in the
spring budget. Among other royals receiving money from the
state, the queen's husband, Prince Philip, will get 360,000 a
year, and the queen's sister, Princess Margaret, will get
220,000. The Prince of Wales, heir to the throne, doesn't
figure on the list because he draws his income from his
personal estate, the Duchy of Cornwall.</p>
<p>EC'S WORKING-HOUR PROPOSAL</p>
<p>Working-hour rules proposed yesterday by the European
Community Commission could drive up costs in many businesses,
industry officials said.</p>
<p>Because of the restrictions proposed on night-time work,
the proposals would hit small enterprises particularly hard,
critics said. For example, French and Italian consumers might
have to pay more for freshly baked bread, or British
households might have to pay a higher price for the milk they
have delivered at their doorstep every morning.</p>
<p>Among other things, the proposed working-hour rules would
ensure that workers get a minimum of 11 hours of continuous
rest per 24 hours.</p>
<p>Both the EC employers' federation Unice and the British
government reiterated their opposition to labor legislation
at the EC level. "It is not necessary and it really doesn't
help" bargaining between labor and industry, a Unice official
said.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Israel's Transport Ministry ordered the suspension of
flights by El Al airlines to Stockholm, saying new
airport-security measures there were inadequate. Both
ministry and El Al officials declined to comment on the
changes made at Stockholm's Arlanda airport. . . . An
epidemic of meningitis has killed at least 92 people during
the past month in the arid Karamonja region of northeastern
Uganda, a Kampala newspaper reported. The region is also
experiencing a severe drought.</p>
