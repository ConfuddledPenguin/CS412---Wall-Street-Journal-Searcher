	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House, as expected, failed to override
President Bush's veto of legislation guaranteeing workers as
much as 12 weeks annual unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption
or serious family illness.
   The vote, 232-195 in favor of the bill, fell 53 votes
short of the two-thirds required to override a veto.
President Bush, in vetoing the bill earlier this month,
criticized its "rigid, federal-imposed requirements" and said
employers need flexibility in offering benefits to workers.
Yesterday's vote leaves Mr. Bush's veto record unblemished;
Congress has sustained 13 of the president's vetoes,
overriding none.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After the vote, Democrats served notice they would be back
before Congress with the measure. "George Bush is going to
have a family-leave bill on his desk every year," said Sen.
Christopher Dodd, (D., Conn.), who led the fight in the
Senate for the legislation. He and Sen. Edward Kennedy (D.,
Mass.) said they would soon reintroduce the legislation.</p>
<p>Though the vote was a victory for the White House and
business groups, Democrats are expected to seize on it as a
political issue in the November elections. Mr. Bush pledged
in his 1988 presidential campaign to protect women's jobs,
though he has opposed mandating benefits.</p>
<p>The veto "makes an absolute mockery out of this president
suggesting that he is pro-family," charged Rep. George Miller
(D., Calif.).</p>
<p>Opponents of the legislation believe such benefits should
be offered voluntarily, without the government mandating what
companies must offer. Business groups have raised concerns
over the cost of finding and training replacement workers and
covering health insurance for employees on leave. They say it
would reduce existing benefits and favor only high-paid
employees who can better afford to take off from work.
Sponsors of the legislation estimated it would cost business
$236 million annually.</p>
<p>Rep. Steve Bartlett (R., Texas) called the legislation "a
cruel hoax which would mandate one-benefit-fits-all." He said
those who voted against the bill support "parental leave as a
benefit, but we are for choices by American workers, not
choices made for them by politicians."</p>
<p>Some Republicans opposed the president's veto. A vote to
sustain the veto is "literally saying to a pregnant woman or
the mother of a terminally ill child or someone caring for an
elderly parent. . . go find another job," said Rep. Marge
Roukema, (R., N.J.), who was one of 37 Republicans voting
with Democrats to override the veto.</p>
<p>The House passed the bill by a 237-187 margin in May.</p>
<p>Proponents say the legislation is a necessity in a nation
where many working parents are caught between the demands of
work and raising a family. Employers would be required to
guarantee jobs and provide health benefits during the
worker's absence. Companies with fewer than 50 employees
wouldn't be covered by the measure, exempting about 44% of
employees nationally.</p>
<p>Mr. Kennedy recalled the time he took off from work when
his son required cancer treatment. "Every three weeks I was
gone three days from the U.S. Senate," he said, adding that
many other parents don't have the flexibility to take time
off without fear of losing their jobs.</p>
