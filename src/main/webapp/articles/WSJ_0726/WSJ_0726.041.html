	<p class="article-leader">California, home of the tax revolt, currently also is an
object lesson in the inexorable pressures for more government
spending.
   This week Republican Governor George Deukmejian and his
legislative adversaries are about $2 billion apart on a
budget that's now nearly a month overdue. Governor Deukmejian
is tired of the revenue race to keep up with what are now 11%
annual spending rises, and wants reform of built-in
expenditure escalators.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Democrats want to make up the $2 billion in tax and
fee hikes and some piecemeal paring of expenses by Mr.
Deukmejian. By one estimate, a California family of four
already faces $230 extra annually from gas and sales tax
boosts this past year. Budget talks are going on this week,
and the big question is how far Mr. Deukmejian will retreat.</p>
<p>All this even though Mr. Deukmejian, like most governors,
has a line-item veto. And even though, by a longstanding
rule, fiscal policies require a two-thirds legislative
approval.</p>
<p>This would seem to be a strong institutional protection
against overspending and overtaxing. Similar supermajority
requirements exist in some form in six other states:
Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and South
Dakota. The record on them is mixed, depending on the
opposition party and the local economy. But usually, as in
California, spending is damped initially but then seems to
start rising again.</p>
<p>Yet at least the citizens of California keep trying to
find ways to keep the government in check. A secondary
element of Proposition 13, the famous 1978 citizen measure to
cut property taxes, required a two-thirds threshold for all
local tax and bond issues. Of 26 tax and bond measures in
Southern California on the ballot in June, half won a
majority but fell short of two-thirds. Eleven of the 13 that
failed got more than 60%.</p>
<p>That evidence might suggest there's such a built-in vote
for bigger government that a two-thirds cutoff is about the
level needed to distinguish which extraordinary items have
true consensus approval. To majority-rule devotees, we would
only suggest that with most adult citizens not even voting,
approval by two-thirds of those who do cast ballots is a
reasonable proxy for majority assent from the larger
community.</p>
<p>California law provides that statewide bonds and taxes, as
opposed to local ones, need only 50%-plus-one approval. In
June voters okayed every one of the seven such measures,
including lulus for monorails and the homeless. The word is
out that if you've got some pet cause for which you want a
few hundred million, put a bond issue on the state ballot and
tell the voters they won't have to pay for it in higher
taxes. Odds are about 53% of those voting will believe you.</p>
<p>A more recent twist is to petition for a special tax on an
unpopular industry -- cigarettes and booze so far; oil,
insurance, banks sure to follow -- and earmark the proceeds
for Mom and Apple Pie. The remnants of Howard Jarvis's army
are onto this game, however, and have qualified a measure of
their own for the November state ballot that would impose the
big two-thirds requirement on these taxes as well as local
"fees." (Ironically, this proposition, too, needs only 50%
plus one to pass.)</p>
<p>California makes clear that institutional checks on
spending and taxing are far from foolproof. It makes as
clear, though, just how powerful pressures for new spending
are, especially when buttressed by low turnouts in elections
and gerrymandering of legislative districts. Given these
realities, something like the two-thirds tourniquet is not
much to ask.</p>
