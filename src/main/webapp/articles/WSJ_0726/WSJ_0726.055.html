   Voters' Lament: But You Promised...</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">You make a critically important point in your July 2
editorial "Mr. Bush's Leadership." Democracy cannot work if
candidates for office do not fulfill their campaign promises
at least as often as they break them. The increasingly low
voter turnout in national elections reflects cynicism about
the process.
   President Carter contributed significantly to this
disaffection after his election in 1976, in which he pledged
to end control of energy, end the double taxing of dividends,
and vowed never to give up the Panama Canal. All three
pledges were abandoned soon after his inauguration.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Those who continue to vote are those who still think they
can tell an honest promise from a cynical one. President Bush
was so emphatic in his pledge not to raise taxes that he
seemed a good bet at the time. He still has not broken his
pledge, although it is certainly bent. If the package he
negotiates with the Democratic Congress is seen to be in the
spirit of his pledge, which has economic growth as the
objective, the electorate will understand the bending of his
promise.</p>
<p>The worst recent example of political cynicism is New
Jersey Gov. James Florio's decision to push mammoth tax
increases through the Legislature his party controls. He had
indicated he would raise taxes only as a last resort. Had he
presented anything like the plan that now makes the New
Jersey income tax effectively the highest in the nation, it
is impossible to imagine him being elected.</p>
<p>It is also difficult to imagine Gov. Florio getting his
package through the Legislature if he had permitted time for
public hearings. But he did not give the electorate a chance
to express itself in this manner either, leaving the
impression that he simply does not trust his own constituents
to have valid opinions -- a common trait in authoritarian
regimes. Californians, on the other hand, protect themselves
against this kind of political arrogance, through the
initiative and referendum process. Their recent decision to
permit tax increases through this process has to be
considered a correct one, as it derives from the collective
wisdom of the electorate.</p>
<p>The Florio package already is leading to movements in New
Jersey to acquire the protection of the initiative and
referendum. If politicians at the national level cannot
manage to keep their most ardent campaign pledges, there
surely will be movements at that level for national
referendum and initiative.</p>
