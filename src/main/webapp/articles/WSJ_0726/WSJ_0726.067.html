	<p class="article-leader">The House Committee on Veterans Affairs asked U.S.
Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to explore whether Sandoz
Pharmaceuticals Corp. violates antitrust laws in marketing
its new drug for schizophrenia.
   A letter from the committee to Mr. Thornburgh said the
panel's efforts aimed at making the drug available to
veterans has raised questions as to whether the company's
policy of bundling its patented drug with a common blood test
constitutes restraint of trade.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
asked Sandoz to change the labeling on the drug to make it
clear that the regulatory agency doesn't require that the
blood test at issue be sold with the drug.</p>
<p>The action reflects continuing controversy over the drug,
known under the brand name Clozaril. The first new
antipsychotic compound in 20 years, Clozaril costs $8,944 a
year combined with Sandoz's proprietary monitoring system.
Last week, the Department of Veterans Affairs said it broke
off talks with Sandoz aimed at reducing the cost of the drug.
Talks have resumed, but the agency currently won't provide
Clozaril to about 3,600 veterans considered candidates for
the medicine.</p>
<p>At least eight states, including California, Minnesota,
New York and Michigan, are understood to have antitrust
inquiries under way, though none has filed suit. Sandoz
officials say they considered antitrust issues before
deciding to market the drug with the monitoring system and
believe they are on solid legal ground.</p>
<p>The drug, known generically as clozapine, has proved
effective in treating some schizophrenic patients who haven't
been helped by other medications. In clinical trials, some
patients previously confined for years in mental hospitals
have progressed to near normal lives. But in less than 2% of
patients, the medicine can trigger a potentially fatal side
effect. Without careful monitoring, Sandoz says, patients
will die and the drug will be pulled from the market.</p>
<p>The drug and the monitoring system, which includes a
weekly white blood count, is dispensed by the Caremark
Homecare unit of Baxter International Inc., Deerfield Ill.
Patients can't get a weekly supply of the drug without having
a blood test. Sandoz, the U.S. unit of Sandoz Ltd., the Swiss
drug concern, says the proprietary system has proved 99.6%
effective in monitoring patients.</p>
<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs, several states and
some hospitals have said they can provide their own
monitoring system at far less cost. Sandoz has considered the
VA's proposal in particular, but thus far has refused to
sanction any other monitoring system.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the FDA has come under fire for approving
Sandoz's labeling for the drug, which describes the
monitoring system as the Clozaril Patient Management System,
giving the impression, critics say, that the agency requires
the proprietary system.</p>
<p>In a letter to Sandoz dated July 13, the FDA asked for
labeling changes to describe the monitoring system in more
general terms stating that the drug is available "only
through distribution systems that ensure weekly (white blood
count) testing" as a condition of receiving a week's supply
of medicine.</p>
<p>Sandoz said it would like to discuss the requested changes
with the FDA. But the company doesn't want to be liable for a
monitoring system it doesn't control and said the requested
labeling changes don't resolve that concern.</p>
