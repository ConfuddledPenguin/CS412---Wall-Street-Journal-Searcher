	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- New government statistics show lingering
weakness in the manufacturing sector.
   Orders to factories for durable goods dropped 3.2% in June
after a 4.2% rise in May, the Commerce Department reported.
Nearly every category of the big-ticket items suffered
declines: transportation equipment, primary metals, machinery
and military equipment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Orders for durable goods -- items expected to last at
least three years, such as cars, home appliances and
industrial machinery -- often fluctuate, but this year they
seem to have taken wider swings than usual, moving up
substantially one month and down the next.</p>
<p>Their latest reversal suggests that U.S. manufacturing,
which appeared to have been scrambling out of the doldrums a
bit this spring, still has very little spark, a number of
economists said.</p>
<p>"I think these numbers say the improvement has gone as far
as it can go," said Robert McGee, an economist at Tokai Bank
in New York.</p>
<p>Manufacturing has been hurt by the Federal Reserve's
efforts to fight inflation over the past few years by holding
interest rates high. That has increased the cost of financing
major purchases and consequently has slowed demand.</p>
<p>Almost two weeks ago the Fed nudged down a key interest
rate for the first time in six months, but Chairman Alan
Greenspan has stressed that the action was only an effort to
"offset" banks' tight lending policy. He has indicated that
no further moves are planned.</p>
<p>That could leave the manufacturing sector flailing for a
while, economists said.</p>
<p>Before there are substantial improvements in
manufacturing, Mr. McGee said, "I think it's basically going
to take some reason for consumer spending to pick up. . . .
And I just don't see where that is on the horizon."</p>
<p>Some economists were also disturbed by a 0.5% drop in the
backlog of orders. "That doesn't augur too well for industry
going forward," said Peter Radford, chief economist at
National Westminster Bancorp in New York. "If backlogs start
to get worked off, that points to slower activity as we go
into the fall, and that's not so encouraging."</p>
<p>Last month's decline brought new orders to $124.69 billion
in June. For the first six months of the year, new orders
came to $744.7 billion, 1.5% below a year earlier.</p>
<p>A 20.7% plunge in orders for defense capital goods
accounted for much of June's drop. But even excluding
military equipment, orders would have been down 1.7%, the
department said.</p>
<p>Analysts said they don't believe the slide in defense
orders reflects cutbacks in military spending but rather the
timing of government contracts.</p>
<p>"I think it would be a little too early to see movements
of that kind from cutbacks in defense spending," Mr. Radford
said.</p>
<p>Orders for transportation equipment fell 4.8%, largely
because of a decline in aircraft bookings. The only major
category to post a rise in orders was capital goods outside
the defense sector, an important indicator of business's
investment plans. But the 0.3% rise wasn't enough to offset
declines in April and May.</p>
<p>All the figures were adjusted for normal seasonal
fluctuations but not for inflation.</p>
