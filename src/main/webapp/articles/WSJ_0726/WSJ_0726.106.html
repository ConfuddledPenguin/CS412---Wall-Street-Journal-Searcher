	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Ad No. 1: Arty, cinematic-style cuts of the
Acura Legend are mixed with quick shots of landscapes as a
dreamy score swells on the soundtrack. Ad No. 2: College kids
swap dippy pickup talk as "Riunite on Ice. That's nice." --
the wine maker's age-old slogan -- is repeated in the
background.
   Hard to believe, but both ads came out of the same agency:
Ketchum Advertising. Back East, where copywriters concocted
the Riunite slogan, Pittsburgh-based Ketchum is known for its
traditional but entirely unexciting advertising. In the
shop's offices here, where the Acura account is serviced, and
in San Francisco, the creative work is known for being
daring.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ketchum is one of a handful of big agencies whose
personalities are at polar extremes in different parts of the
country. While many agencies strive for a single culture and
attitude, Ketchum and a few others seem almost schizophrenic
in how different their various offices' personalities can be.</p>
<p>Ad industry consultants, influential in guiding clients to
agencies, say the independent, sometimes conflicting images
coming out of a single agency can be confusing. "It's quite
possible for the uninitiated, unsophisticated client to have
some trouble sorting this all out," says William Weilbacher,
an advertising consultant at Bismark Corp. in New York.</p>
<p>But agencies that claim a host of diverse identities
insist that clients aren't muddled at all, because the office
a particular client signs on with is the only one they care
about. At Foote, Cone & Belding, for example, the San
Francisco office is known as a creative hot shop for its work
on the Levi's and California Raisins accounts, while its New
York office is one of the most traditional of all agencies,
with conservative packaged-goods ads for products such as
Oreo cookies.</p>
<p>Yet Mike Koelker, executive creative director at Foote
Cone's office in San Francisco, says the offices operate
autonomously and things work just fine. "The company really
does take pride in regional differences," he says. He adds
that until a couple of years ago, when he had worked for the
agency for about eight years, he hadn't even met top
executives at many of the other Foote Cone offices.</p>
<p>Ketchum's chairman and chief executive officer, Bill
Genge, also defends the disparate cultures that make up his
agency, and contends the diverse talent and personalities
help the agency when it comes to new business, among other
things. "They do share the Ketchum culture and the Ketchum
core values, but they express them in quite different ways,"
he says.</p>
<p>The same culture, perhaps, but it's hard to tell from
looking. Whereas Ketchum's New York offices could easily be
mistaken for an insurance company's, folks at the shop's Los
Angeles and San Francisco offices pride themselves on their
funky wood-beamed offices and blue-jeans mentality. Some
people even commute via skateboard. "There's something about
the freedom of the space and its informality," says Millie
Olson, executive creative director in San Francisco.</p>
<p>So free, in fact, that Ms. Olson often brings her
six-month-old dalmatian, Molly, to work and lets the dog roam
about the creative department. Copywriters head to a garden
on the roof of the agency to develop what they call "RTA" --
roof top advertising. Here, offbeat ads for Southwestern
Bell's yellow pages and DHL overnight delivery service were
created. The office also made stars out of towns like Luck,
Wisc., and Manhattan, Mont., for the Beef Industry Council.</p>
<p>In Los Angeles, the shop is staffed with a crew that is
significantly more youthful than the agency's Eastern
operations. The office's creative director, Brent Bouchez, a
lanky guy who came to Ketchum from Chiat/Day/Mojo, is a mere
32 years old. Executives here, including Tim Hart, a
shaggy-haired account man easily mistaken for a creative
executive, are busily readying what will likely be a sexy
campaign for Acura's new NSX sportscar -- a car expected to
cost about $60,000.</p>
<p>Clearly, it hasn't been easy for the West Coast executives
to create an image that is their own, apart from the
traditional Ketchum mode. "It was certainly easier for
Chiat/Day in New York to establish what it stood for coming
from its strong West Coast office than it has been for us to
establish what we're trying to be . . . coming from the
heritage of solid business-to-business advertising and good
marketing," says Craig Mathiesen, president of the Los
Angeles office.</p>
<p>His office, at least, is trying to do something about it.
Mr. Mathiesen said a new brochure pitching the office's
successes will run in a California-only edition of The Wall
Street Journal early next month. The brochure, executives at
the shop say, was developed to draw attention to the
differences their office offers in a bid to woo new clients.
The pitch offers "a few words on image from an advertising
agency that's still working on theirs," the brochure says.</p>
<p>Consultants, though, say the strategy isn't without risk.
"The West Coast is a very different ad market," acknowledges
Bismark's Mr. Weilbacher. Such a new-business campaign can
work, he says, as long as it doesn't detract from the shop's
national new business efforts or contradict the image of the
shop's culture.</p>

<p>Three Firms Pull TV Ads</p>
<p>Toyota Motor, Anheuser-Busch and International Business
Machines canceled television ads scheduled to air during
broadcasts of a professional golf tournament to be held at an
all-white country club.</p>
<p>Toyota and IBM said the advertising was pulled from the
ABC and ESPN telecasts of the Professional Golfers
Association tournament because Shoal Creek country club in
Birmingham, Ala., has no black members. Anheuser-Busch didn't
say why it dropped ads scheduled to air during the tournament
Aug. 9 through Aug. 12.</p>
<p>Officials at Shoal Creek have said that the club doesn't
ban black members and that blacks have been guests there.</p>
<p>"We're concerned and disappointed about the actions of the
advertisers in light of the PGA's position against
discrimination," said a PGA official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.</p>
<p>Reacting to the controversy, the PGA announced July 14
that it would in the future consider clubs' membership
policies in picking tournament sites. A specific policy was
to be drawn up.</p>
<p>The value of the canceled advertising wasn't disclosed.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>CLOROX ACCOUNTS: When it completes its acquisition of the
household products business of American Cyanamid, Clorox said
it plans to reassign ad responsibilities for the Pine-Sol and
Combat brands. The two accounts are currently serviced at
Carafiello Diehl & Associates. Pine-Sol, which bills about
$10 million, will go to Young & Rubicam's San Francisco
office; Combat insecticide, which bills about $5 million,
will be moved to Omnicom's DDB Needham agency in Chicago.</p>
<p>SOUTHWEST AIRLINES: After a review, Southwest Airlines
said it decided to keep the creative portion of its $20
million ad account at GSD&M, Austin, Texas. GSD&M
participated in a review of the creative account that
included a number of other agencies, including Ketchum
Advertising, Ayer, Cramer-Krasselt and Richards Group. Media
buying for Southwest, based in Dallas, will remain with
Camelot Communications of Dallas.</p>
