	<p class="article-leader">MIDDLETOWN, Ohio -- Armco Steel Co. is likely to spend at
least $1.5 billion to improve its steelmaking facilities over
the next five years, according to its owners.
   Armco Steel is a joint venture between Armco Inc.,
Parsippany, N.J., and Kawasaki Steel Corp., Tokyo. It
operates steel mills here and in Ashland, Ky.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When the joint venture was established in 1989, the
companies said they planned to invest $1.1 billion over the
1989-94 period. About $200 million was invested in 1989.</p>
<p>A new capital spending program will be considered by Armco
Steel directors next month, which will add some improvement
projects to the original plan, probably extending it into
1995. Armco Inc. and Kawasaki declined to provide specifics
on the additional projects.</p>
<p>Kawasaki purchased a 40% interest in Armco's Eastern Steel
division last year to establish the joint venture. During the
1990 second quarter, Kawasaki contributed $70 million to
Armco Steel, raising its ownership to 45%. Kawasaki will
contribute another $70 million in 1991 and $35 million in
1992, at which time Armco Steel will be a 50-50 joint venture
between the parents.</p>
<p>Kawasaki's payments will provide $175 million toward the
capital program. The remainder will come from cash flow and
borrowings, Armco said.</p>
<p>The spending will include an overhaul of the rolling mills
to improve steel quality. A Kawasaki spokesman said the mills
currently can't meet the exacting specifications of Japanese
auto makers. One goal of the investment is to increase sales
to the U.S. auto plants owned by Japanese auto makers, he
indicated.</p>
