	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Rohm & Haas Co. disclosed that a study at
its chemicals plant here showed a statistical correlation
between pancreas cancer in workers and exposure to the
pesticide DDT.
   The chemicals company emphasized, however, that the
finding was preliminary and didn't by itself establish a
cause-and-effect relationship between the pesticide and the
cancer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The study is part of a years-long effort by Rohm & Haas to
track the health of some 6,000 workers at the plant. In 1987,
the company noted the incidence of pancreatic cancer at the
plant was somewhat higher than what would be expected in the
general population. At the time, however, the company
couldn't link the observation with any products or production
processes.</p>
<p>"There are no previous studies that indicate DDT is
associated with pancreas cancer in humans," Phillip Lewis,
the company's medical director said in a statement yesterday.</p>
<p>The study looked at the 28 cases of pancreas cancer among
workers at the plant between 1948 and 1971, all of whom have
since died. Eleven of those workers had handled DDT and
related products.</p>
<p>"We see clear association between pancreas cancer and DDT
exposure," David Garabrant, director of occupational medicine
at the University of Michigan, said in an interview.</p>
<p>Dr. Garabrant, who conducted the study, said there is less
than a 3% possibility that the statistical significance of
the association was due entirely to chance, even after
controlling for such factors as which of the workers were
smokers.</p>
<p>Rohm & Haas stopped making DDT-related products years ago,
and DDT is no longer made anywhere in the U.S., according to
a spokesman at the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
