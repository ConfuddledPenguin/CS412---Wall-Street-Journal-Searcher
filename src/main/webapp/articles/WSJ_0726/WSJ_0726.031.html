	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Some British municipal governments have become
strangely hostile toward local schools. In the London borough
of Sutton, local authorities lobbied to get the budget of
Wilson's School reduced by $126,000. In Manchester, the Labor
councils of Bolton and Tameside each imposed sanctions on a
local school. They ordered government agencies not to sell
cleaning, meal and maintenance services to the schools. Other
schools have suddenly found themselves banned from municipal
swimming pools.
   What goes on here?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The schools have become the target of these hostilities
because they have declared independence from their local
education bureaucracy. They are furthest along in a broad
movement toward parental choice in education, and maximum
local control.</p>
<p>In the U.S., this movement takes the form of vouchers or
choice plans, such as the kind being fought over in
Milwaukee. But in the U.S. politicians have supported choice
mostly with words. In Britain, Margaret Thatcher has
initiated the crucial reform, with results for all to see.</p>
<p>In Britain, parents can now choose which school they wish
their child to attend, and schools can break away from the
regional education bureaucracy. If the majority of parents at
a school vote to "opt out," their school becomes independent.
Decisions on everything from hiring teachers to building
science labs are then made by the headmaster and the school's
parent-dominated governing body, and no longer by the distant
bureaucracy. The schools are still state funded, but opt-out
schools get checks directly from the Department of Education
in London.</p>
<p>The size of the check is determined by how much the
regional bureaucracies were spending per pupil under the old
system. But the regional bureaucracies spend as much as 30%
of their budgets on themselves. Now the money goes straight
to the schools, and the opt-out schools often find they have
an extra chunk of money to spend on faculty, books or
equipment.</p>
<p>Forty-four schools have opted out since the choice became
available just over a year ago. The schools in Sutton, Bolton
and Tameside are among the vanguard, as is the London Oratory
School, in central London. Like many of the renegades, London
Oratory is known for rigorous standards and traditional
pedagogy. In the front hall, a uniformed pupil is being
reprimanded for having addressed a teacher while his hands
were in his pockets -- a sign of disrespect not tolerated.</p>
<p>Headmaster John McIntosh wears the long black academic
robe that calls to mind "Goodbye Mr. Chips." He says that
opting out has had a tremendous impact on how he spends his
day, "I'm no longer called to meetings at the local education
authority where you sit around a table and talk about details
ad nauseam."</p>
<p>Schools now deal with local contractors themselves:
"Whereas previously we had to put in an order for new
equipment and of course there was tremendous paperwork and
delay -- up to three years. Now we can pick up a telephone
and get it instantly," Mr. McIntosh says.</p>
<p>Mr. McIntosh is not the only one who gets excited while
talking about the advantages of opting out. Student
applications to opt-out schools increased 40% this year.
Though England suffers from a teacher shortage, the schools
were able to fill all their job vacancies.</p>
<p>Opt-outs have found themselves with, on average, between
15% and 20% more money to spend, and with more discretion to
channel the money as they wish. At the Hendon School in
London, for example, there has been a 58% increase in
expenditure on books and teaching materials, a 400% increase
on classroom equipment, a 25% increase in tuition for music
lessons and improvements in school meal provisions. Bankfield
High School in Cheshire hired six extra teachers and
increased per-pupil spending on books from $50 to $160.</p>
<p>Other schools are simply glad to be free from the
political meddlings of the local council. In Derbyshire, in
the Midlands, the Labor council decided to replace the
Chesterfield School's 394-year-old crest with the motto,
"Derbyshire County Council supports nuclear-free zones,"
prompting exasperated parents to begin opt-out procedures.</p>
<p>Opt-out reforms threaten to make local bureaucrats
obsolete, and opposition from those quarters has been
predictably vitriolic. Teacher unions continue to mobilized
against opt-outs, and the Labor Party, which depends on these
unions, has promised to eliminate opt-out schools if Neil
Kinnock is elected prime minister. In fact, many parents have
decided to postpone opt-out campaigns until after the next
election.</p>
<p>Those that do wage opt-out efforts often find themselves
in the midst of tough and sometimes dirty political brawls.
Some municipal authorities have joined with the trade unions
to set up the "Local Government Information Unit" which urges
parents to vote no on opt-out proposals. The council that
controlled London Oratory took out advertisements in London
papers warning parents that if they voted to opt out, their
students would no longer have use of the administrative
paraphenalia the central office offered. Mr. McIntosh says
the ads did not do his side much harm, since "It was exactly
that paraphenalia we were trying to get away from."</p>
<p>Elsewhere, tactics are rougher. In Tameside the local
council tried to sell the school grounds and buildings in an
effort to foil an opt-out plan (an independent school would
have to pay rent to the new private owners). In the London
borough of Brent, black parents were told that opted-out
schools would discriminate against them. Elsewhere parents
have complained to the Department of Education about
threatening visits to parents' homes before ballots, and
about threats against teachers who support opt-out efforts.</p>
<p>Even after the opt-out decision has been made, some Labor
councils mount retaliation campaigns. After the parents at
the decaying Baverstock School in Birmingham voted to opt
out, the council ruled that Baverstock would not be allowed
to join a Vocational Education consortium. Baverstock
students may not be able to compete with other Birmingham
sports teams or use the city's field houses. But the school
has about $540,000 extra per year to spend on education. It
has hired six teachers, employed a full-time nurse and
caretaker, increased spending on books by 130%, spent $47,000
on computers, added a hot breakfast program and spent $70,000
on building repairs.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thatcher is thinking about making the opt-out reform
a central issue in her re-election campaign. This week she
pressed her advantage by proposing to give schools authority
to deviate from the national teacher pay scales, to the howls
of the teacher unions. The Labor Party, meanwhile, is
pinioned to the inflexible unions. It is also stuck with a
radical egalitarian ideology: Confronted by diversity, it
sees only inequality and it cries "Stop]" Such a philosophy
makes sensible reform impossible.</p>
<p>In many ways, the opt-out campaign resembles modernization
efforts in Eastern Europe. Rather than try to reform or
shrink stagnant bureaucracies, it is easier simply to bypass
them.</p>
