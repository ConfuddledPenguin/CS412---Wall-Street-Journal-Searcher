	<p class="article-leader">Again, Tandy Corp. has decided to ask the bewildering
question: Will average American families spend $1,000 or more
to computerize basic household management chores?
   During the past decade, consumers have answered with a
thundering "no." But the prize -- a potentially huge market
-- is tantalizing and yesterday Tandy joined International
Business Machines Corp. in the search for the home computer
user, a road both have taken before with mixed success.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Fort Worth, Texas, retailer's new Tandy 1000 RL is
aimed squarely at computer novices. It features built-in
software designed to guide new users quickly into balancing
their checkbooks, planning menus, taking inventories or
compiling Christmas card lists. "The 1000 RL is so easy to
use that it guarantees success," boasted John V. Roach,
Tandy's chairman.</p>
<p>But that success may be limited by the machine's price
range, $750 to $1,300 -- a bit pricey for its target users.
In June, analysts applauded IBM politely for its easy-to-use
PS/1 home computer models -- and recalled how completely Big
Blue failed in the home market in 1985 with the PC jr., which
was discontinued after sales of about 500,000 machines.</p>
<p>Tandy faced a similar reception. "I'm skeptical that
there's an enormous untapped pool of buyers waiting for one
that's easy to use," said William F. Zachmann, president of
Canopus Research.</p>
<p>But whatever the market's eventual size, Tandy has a
substantial edge in its 7,000 Radio Shack outlets. Before
shipping the 1000 RL, Tandy drilled its retail sales staff to
ensure they could help computer novices use the computer. By
contrast, IBM is testing its distribution in three markets
before shipping the PS/1 to its dealers plus 1,000 Sears
Roebuck, Dillard Department Stores and Dayton Hudson stores
nationwide. "I wouldn't be surprised to see Tandy sell more
home computers than IBM," Mr. Zachman said.</p>
<p>Tandy also has been working for years on software that
presents a friendly face to the user. Many analysts believe
that the 1000 RL will prove easier to use than IBM's PS/1.
"It's very friendly," said Joe Ann Stahel, president of
StoreBoard/Computer Intelligence, a market-research firm
specializing in computer retail sales. She added that this is
the type of computer she was looking for in 1982 when she
began typing recipes and address lists into the primitive
home computers of that time.</p>
<p>Despite its software gains, the Tandy machine also will be
scorned by rivals as primitive by today's standards. Both its
microprocessor and its color video technology are dated even
in comparison to the IBM PS/1, which is also more expensive
at its list price of $1,000 to $2,000. For those prices,
consumers can buy machines with twice as much power as the
IBM and Tandy machines.</p>
<p>But computing power is a moot question if "users have no
idea what to do with it," said Dean Witter Reynolds analyst
Eugene Glazer. "Tandy is trying to revive a product category
that has been dead for a number of years."</p>
<p>The 1000 RL's home management tasks -- home finances,
homework, and correspondence -- were among the uses that
Tandy held out for its TRS-80 Model 1 in 1978. While Tandy
has been more successful than most in the home market, most
of its sales were to office PC users who wanted to work at
home. Those computer-savvy potential buyers will want more
power than the Tandy 1000 RL offers, said analysts.</p>
<p>With a black-and-white screen and a single floppy-disk
drive, the 1000 RL sells for $749.90. With a color screen and
a hard-disk drive, the computer sells for $1,299.90. Modems,
necessary to communicate over telephone lines, are extra.</p>
