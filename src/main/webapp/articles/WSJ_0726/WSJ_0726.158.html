	<p class="article-leader">GENEVA -- OPEC ministers meeting here moved toward raising
the target price for oil produced by their countries at least
$1 to $2 a barrel from the current $18.
   A rise in the so-called reference price wouldn't
automatically lift world market prices by the amount of the
increase. But as the official goal of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, a higher reference figure
would underscore the group's determination to prop up oil
prices and revenues, which have sagged badly this year. The
boost in the target price would be the first in four years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In hopes of achieving higher prices, OPEC members, who
produce more than 40% of the non-Communist world's crude oil,
would effectively cut back on the combined amount of oil
they're pumping.</p>
<p>A proposed new production arrangement would set a total
output ceiling for OPEC members of 22.5 million barrels a
day. On paper, that would be 400,000 barrels a day higher
than the current ceiling. But in fact, if honored, such a new
ceiling would mean actual output would drop substantially
because it would cut down on production by some members that
exceed the quotas.</p>
<p>Specifically, it would bring the United Arab Emirates, a
chronic overproducer, back into the OPEC fold under a higher
quota offered under terms hammered out in Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia, two weeks ago by five Persian Gulf ministers.</p>
<p>But some major obstacles to a quick agreement still face
the oil ministers as they open the formal part of their
midyear conference today, including a tense disagreement over
oil policy by Iraq and Kuwait.</p>
<p>Iraq has threatened to use military force against Kuwait
to settle their differences. This rising tension puts two of
OPEC's key Persian Gulf ministers, who were in on the recent
Jiddah meeting, on opposite sides of the price issue here.
The Iraqi minister is now demanding a new reference price of
$25 a barrel while his counterpart from Kuwait wants to hold
it at $18.</p>
<p>Also, Libya's oil minister, Fawzi A. Shakshuki, supports
the Iraqi minister's call for a $25 benchmark and strongly
objects to other parts of the Jiddah plan. "I was not part of
the Jiddah agreement," he said last night, adding: "If there
is any {quota} increase, Libya should also get an increase."</p>
<p>While OPEC's bottom line is the price of oil, in many ways
the discussions here over where to set the reference price
are academic unless the cartel's production is brought into
line with demand. Total output of the 13 oil exporters has
soared as high as 24 million barrels a day this year,
contributing to an enormous buildup of petroleum inventories
world-wide and causing the average price of OPEC crude to
drop as low as $14 a barrel.</p>
<p>Prices have recovered at least $3 a barrel since the
Jiddah meeting, but still remain below the current $18
reference price.</p>
<p>OPEC economists late yesterday told an informal meeting of
ministers that their overproduction had resulted in an
increase of 184 million barrels in world oil inventories this
year.</p>
<p>After the meeting, OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said the
report concluded that to eliminate this inventory "overhang"
in the remainder of the year, OPEC production should be held
to 22 million barrels a day.</p>
<p>An increase in demand for OPEC oil to some 23 million
barrels a day is expected, however, in the year's second
half. So OPEC officials reasoned that strict adherence to
production quotas should hold total OPEC output below that
level, keeping prices firm.</p>
<p>As a result, most ministers favor a new higher reference
price immediately. Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister,
suggested that "$20 is a good place to start." But whatever
the target price, oil traders here observing the proceedings
questioned whether it could be met if overproducers don't
honor their new pledges to abide by their quotas. To that
end, delegates disclosed that they expect to increase quota
compliance checks if a new ceiling is adopted.</p>
<p>Past overproduction by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
is the chief reason Iraq has moved tanks and troops to its
border with Kuwait. Iraq has angrily blamed Kuwait and the
emirates for "economic warfare" against it by causing this
year's oil-price fall. The threat of military action because
of that dispute has had a sobering effect on OPEC ministers
here, although the Iraqi and Kuwaiti ministers joked and
laughed with each other during photo sessions yesterday.</p>
