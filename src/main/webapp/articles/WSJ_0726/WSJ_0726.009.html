	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- It is early evening in an addicts' shooting
gallery on the northwest side of this city, and Dottie Burns
has something to say: "You all know me," she announces to the
bleary-eyed group in the kitchen of a shabby apartment. "I
used to come here and do dope myself. I care for you and
don't want you to die."
   Nearby, a woman quietly pulls a syringe from a vein in her
left arm and lays it on the table. Ms. Burns doesn't flinch.
Instead she launches off into her warnings about drug use,
and starts handing out bleach for cleaning needles, condoms
for safe sex and brochures that recount the dangers of AIDS.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ms. Burns, 35 years old, is part of a growing movement in
the inner city, one that relies on so-called self-help
programs to contend with some of the intractable problems of
urban America. Now drug-free and looking healthy in her
turtleneck and pressed jeans, she has returned to this past
haunt as part of a team of recovering addicts with Outreach
Inc., a local organization trying to fight the spread of AIDS
among inner-city blacks.</p>
<p>Outreach is just one of hundreds of self-help programs
that have sprung up to tackle the worsening problems of the
poor. Those efforts can hardly solve the inner-city's
problems on their own. Yet, they reflect a growing sense that
the best strategies for dealing with urban social decay are
often home-grown, and that government programs have, in many
cases, simply failed.</p>
<p>"Self-help is definitely the solution," says Julia Hare, a
San Francisco educator who has written about black family
life. "Government isn't going to do it, and I'm not sure
government should do it."</p>
<p>Adds Dorothy Height, president of the National Council of
Negro Women: "There is no way to deal with these problems
without rediscovering some of the traditional values and
historic strengths that have brought us this far and have
been the base of our survival." Last January, the council
telecast a three-hour conference on self-help that was
carried on more than 20 cable and public-access television
channels across the country.</p>
<p>The idea of self-help is hardly new to urban black
communities. During decades of segregation, when normal
services were denied them, blacks in the U.S. formed their
own stores, insurance companies and other businesses.
Integration would permit the more affluent and better
educated to move away and start new lives, but it also
siphoned off the role models from the old neighborhoods. As
the inner city disintegrated, the self-help network crumbled,
too.</p>
<p>Federal poverty programs have offered a partial safety
net. Yet, "government is not the generator, it's the
facilitator," insists U.S. Rep. Kweisi Mfume, a Democrat from
Maryland. "It's not going to generate our change."</p>
<p>And as for the mainstay civil rights organizations, such
as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, many former members complain they have grown so large
and bureaucratic that they have lost touch with the black
community. Kenneth Powell, 43, a St. Louis dentist and
businessman, recently resigned from the local board of the
NAACP. His reason: The old-line organizations "don't
represent the people in the community anymore," he contends.
Dr. Powell, who is still an NAACP member, worries that the
group is top-heavy with older leaders who have failed to step
aside for a younger, more progressive generation.</p>
<p>NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks sees things
differently. The group's community service, job training and
educational programs keep it in touch with its black
constituency, he says. "We have got to rise up and take
responsibility for our own destiny," he told the NAACP annual
convention in Los Angeles this month, sounding the self-help
theme. "Our foreparents didn't spend all of their time
whining and crying about what they didn't have. They took the
little bit they did have and made something out of it. We are
their children, and we must do the same."</p>
<p>Increasingly, that's exactly what groups in the inner city
are doing.</p>
<p>A Mentor for the Young</p>
<p>Richard Rowe, a 39-year-old director of a youth program in
Baltimore, says he used to get depressed when he drove
through the city's ghetto in the mid-1980s. There, he saw
"scores and scores" of black men standing on street corners
and outside liquor stores, he says. Mr. Rowe, who at the time
worked for the local chapter of the Urban League, decided the
problem was "a void in programs, initiativesa vision for
African-American males."</p>
<p>He decided to help fill that void himself, though he said
he got "some resistance" from his Urban League superiors. Mr.
Rowe formed the Afrikan American Men's Leadership Council,
which matches black youths aged 11 to 14 with black male
adults who then act as role models. The youths undergo a
yearlong "rite of passage" based loosely on coming-of-age
ceremonies in African tribal tradition. However, instead of
slaying a lion, goals include improving school attendance and
grades and taking a role in community service.</p>
<p>The mentors range from professionals to blue-collar
workers. One is an ex-convict and reformed jewelry thief, who
says he wants "to act as a catalyst to divert {children} from
that experience."</p>
<p>Mr. Rowe considers himself lucky. A college graduate, he
grew up in a stable home where both his mother and father
were supportive of him and his five siblings. Although his
father worked two jobs, as a janitor and a carpenter, "I got
the chance to see a man interact with his family," he says.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Rowe tries to share that kind of relationship
with his new charges. One of them is Jamaal Jackson, 14. For
years, Jamaal's mother, Theresita, who is divorced, worried
that the drug problem encroaching on her neighborhood might
sweep up her son. "As a black single parent I didn't have a
real male image for my son," she says. "While I had 1,000
things for my daughter to do, I knew I needed some type of
outlet for him, that I couldn't constantly try and do it on
my own."</p>
<p>So she enrolled him in the mentoring program. For Jamaal,
it was a year of discovery. His mentors took him on trips to
museums, helped him with his homework and discussed proper
conduct. The program "taught me a lot about brotherhood and
the black race, about self-discipline," he says. "I respect
black history and culture more now. And, I respect my parents
and my peers."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Mr. Rowe's group helped sponsor a
conference on black males and self-help at Morgan State
College in Baltimore, Mr. Rowe's alma mater. The program drew
some 300 people, including a group of teen-age boys from the
city's St. Frances Charles Hall High School. The boys have
started their own effort to encourage positive behavior among
their peers. "We don't want to see them stand on the corner
selling drugs to make their money," says Joseph Alston, 18, a
senior who says he once dealt drugs himself. "We want to see
them going to work, trying to better themselves."</p>
<p>It's one more attempt at self-help, says Mr. Rowe. As for
his own mentoring program, only 12 of the 30 boys who signed
up graduated, but he says he isn't discouraged. "A lot of
boys aren't prepared for this kind of rigorous program," he
says. Nonetheless, he is already recruiting mentors for next
year's group. "I'm no longer looking outside our family, our
community, for solutions," he says.</p>
<p>Working Inside the System</p>
<p>When Lisa Y. Sullivan arrived at Yale in 1983 to begin
graduate studies in political science, she intended to focus
on her studies. But that quickly changed.</p>
<p>Public projects housing some of the poorest blacks in New
Haven, Conn., were little more than a stone's throw from
Yale's ivy-draped campus, and Ms. Sullivan couldn't help but
notice the stark contrast. In Washington, D.C., where she
grew up, Ms. Sullivan says she had known slums, "but nothing
like what I saw in New Haven."</p>
<p>The 28-year-old Ms. Sullivan decided to find a way to make
a contribution. Reared on the virtues of the NAACP (she was
treasurer of the NAACP chapter at Clark College in Atlanta),
she sought out the New Haven chapter and its youth council.
She was in for a surprise.</p>
<p>At the first meeting of the chapter she attended, she
says, "everybody there was over 60. Nobody was really doing
anything with the youth council." The local chapter, she
contends, "had lost visibility and credibility in New Haven's
black community."</p>
<p>When Ms. Sullivan and Kevin Houston, 30, a student at
Yale's Divinity School, started bringing in new members from
the housing projects and enlisting them in a voter
registration drive, some old-guard tempers flared. During one
tumultuous chapter meeting, Mr. Houston refused to yield the
floor, and some angry older members began to sing hymns to
drown him out. "We pushed the black middle class in this town
to the limit about their having rejected the black
community," Ms. Sullivan says.</p>
<p>The two, she says, were accused of "going berserk" with
the youth group, especially when they announced they would
recruit more members from the housing projects in preference
to "middle-class kids who belong to umpteen organizations
already." She says the chapter's conservative members worried
about the organization's image: "We now had young men with
gold chains and high top fades {a hair style} saying they
were officers in the NAACP youth council." Ms. Sullivan says
she found that, among children in the ghetto, the NAACP "was
only a historical reference point. They had never been
approached" by the organization.</p>
<p>Choosing his words carefully, Haywood Hooks, a 65-year-old
research chemist elected president of the local chapter in
1984, says, "I think some of the ideas they had weren't in
keeping with the policies and practices of the NAACP. The
kind of things they wanted to do, the elderly members didn't
see them doing it that way." However, Mr. Hooks admits that
before Ms. Sullivan arrived, the youth council "was very much
in limbo."</p>
<p>These days, however, Mr. Hooks calls Ms. Sullivan and Mr.
Houston "indispensable" to the NAACP's efforts. Ms. Sullivan
alone has raised more than $30,000 this year for the local
chapter, he notes.</p>
<p>Ms. Sullivan and Mr. Houston have enrolled nearly 150
children, mostly black and between the ages of 12 and 17, in
their youth program. They have taken youngsters on
out-of-town trips to NAACP conferences and black cultural
events, enrolled children in tutorial programs and started
discussion groups on black history and self-esteem. Recently,
they took a group to a Yale Repertory performance of "Two
Trains Running," a play by August Wilson, a black Pulitzer
Prize-winning playwright.</p>
<p>Mr. Houston, who wears his hair in dreadlocks and favors
African-style clothing, has since dropped out of divinity
school to work full time with youth. "The truth is," he says,
"the whole community is at risk."
</p>
<p>A Personal Mission</p>
<p>Dottie Burns is of like mind, which is why she spends her
time prowling Atlanta's neighborhoods looking for drug
addicts to help.</p>
<p>Ms. Burns, the product of a broken family in Atlanta,
began using drugs when she was 14. Over the next several
years, she would graduate from popping tranquilizers to
shooting heroin. She would lose her job, bear a daughter and
be repeatedly arrested for stealing to support her habit.</p>
<p>In 1988, she was put in jail for parole violation, and
there she began her withdrawal from drugs. "I remember
throwing up, chills, being hot and restless. But I got my
first spiritual awakening. I made up my mind that that was
it. I got busy thinking about what I needed to do to never
have to come back" to jail.</p>
<p>The best way, she figured, was to become a role model, an
example for other addicts of how to beat drugs. She finished
a rehabilitation program and joined Outreach Inc. Now when
she talks to addicts in the ghetto, "It's not `Look at me,
look at how good I look.' It's `Look at me. You've seen me
before. You can change too.' They're a part of my life, a
part of me I don't want to forget."</p>
<p>Outreach Inc. got its start from another Atlantan who
believed self-help offered a powerful means of influencing
life in the depressed inner city. Sandra McDonald, who once
sold cosmetics door to door, founded the organization in
1986, handing out AIDS literature from her car and preaching
the virtues of clean needles and safe sex.</p>
<p>Today, sitting in Outreach's storefront headquarters on
busy Martin Luther King Drive, a central artery through this
city's black community, she recalls how she grew up here in a
different world. "I remember in school, some kids had no
decent clothes. The teacher would make a quiet announcement
that clothes were available. They saw a need and took care of
it -- very quietly."</p>
<p>Her maternal grandmother was a midwife, part of a
community network in which neighbors knew and cared for each
other, Ms. McDonald recalls. "Her example was not to wait for
anybody to do it for you -- do it yourself." Through
Outreach, "we apply that same philosophy we grew up with and
take it to the people who most need it," she says.</p>
<p>While the 43-year-old Ms. McDonald has never been a
substance abuser, all but two of her staff of 17 are
recovering from drug or alcohol addiction. Three have AIDS.
Last year they passed out 82,800 pieces of literature and
180,000 condoms in 47 neighborhoods in the city. Says Ms.
McDonald: "We've been in the streets long enough now to build
a real bond with the communities."</p>
<p>For those involved in self-help at its rawest level, that
bonding can be a painful experience. Outreach's Dottie Burns
confesses that she sometimes finds it difficult emotionally
to talk to addicts about AIDS. It recalls anguished memories
of her own addiction, and of friends who have died.</p>
<p>But her past is still her best asset in her line of work,
she says. "If you don't have that rapport you wouldn't
accomplish anything. I know that I'm just one shot away from
getting high and being right back down there with them."</p>
