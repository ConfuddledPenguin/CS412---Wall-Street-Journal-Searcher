	<p class="article-leader">General Instrument Corp. of New York said two potential
bidders have indicated they don't plan to try to top a $1.47
billion, or $44.50-a-share, buy-out offer by Forstmann,
Little & Co.
   The two parties, who weren't ever publicly identified,
were said by Wall Street professionals to be Kelso & Co.,
another leveraged buy-out firm, and Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Corp., a unit of Equitable Life Assurance
Society of the U.S. Neither company would comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The announcement by General Instrument apparently leaves
the way clear for Forstmann, Little to acquire the cable TV
equipment company when its offer expires Aug. 13. Mr.
Forstmann had earlier estimated the chances he would be
outbid at only "one in 50."</p>
<p>General Instrument stock declined 87.5 cents to $44.75 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the
company said one of the two parties didn't plan to bid.
Trading was halted before a later announcement that the
second party didn't plan to bid either, and trading didn't
resume before the market closed.</p>
