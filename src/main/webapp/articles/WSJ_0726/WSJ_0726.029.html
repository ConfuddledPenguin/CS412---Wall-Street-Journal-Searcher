	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks on the first section ended essentially flat,
with most early incentives drying up in the afternoon.
   London shares finished marginally higher as investors were
circumspect about the outlook for U.K. corporate earnings,
Wall Street, interest rates and the timetable for sterling to
enter the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary
System.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues edged down 1.19 points
to 31701.27. In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei
index rose 86.84 points to 31788.11.</p>
<p>Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
350 million shares, down slightly from 355.5 million shares
Tuesday. Advancers outpaced decliners 541 to 388, while 194
issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>As a result, the broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index of
all issues listed in the first section reflected a somewhat
firmer tone than the benchmark indicator. The Topix rose 2.72
points, or 0.12%, to 2307.31.</p>
<p>Investor interest was clearly on the second section, where
buying on high-priced shares of value rebounded from recent
softness.</p>
<p>The second section index gained 51.53 points, or 1.19%, to
4380.76. The section's volume was estimated at 21.2 million
shares, up from 15.6 million shares.</p>
<p>"The second section had a fantastic day," one U.K. broker
said. "The high-priced second section shares are where
investors are seeing value short term," he added.</p>
<p>As investors have been increasingly selective about
companies, he noted, action will likely continue to be drawn
to the second section.</p>
<p>Trading on the first section in the morning was active,
though movement on the indexes was limited.</p>
<p>The broad market firmed more than 100 points at the
opening as investors welcomed the New York market's recovery
overnight, which was driven mostly by buying on oil stocks.</p>
<p>Linked to increased political tension in the Persian Gulf
and anxiety amid this week's meeting of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, higher oil prices have also
encouraged buying of Tokyo oil shares, traders said.</p>
<p>By the midmorning, overall stock prices were softer, as
investors who weren't able to unload positions over the
previous three days of losses on the Nikkei Index sold down
some high-priced shares, erasing early gains.</p>
<p>Also midmorning, the yen began to weaken further against
the dollar. But although the currency's softening often
ignites some buying on export-oriented shares, too much
uncertainty about the direction of interest rates left
investors reluctant to purchase, traders said.</p>
<p>Participants yielded to wait-and-see sentiments by
afternoon, during which the Nikkei Index drifted with little
direction.</p>
<p>In the afternoon session, some professional buying gave
support to speculative and high-technology shares, though
traders said the atmosphere remained timid.</p>
<p>Traders also said that volume will likely be slow today,
ahead of the first day of trading for accounts for August
settlement. General selling is expected to be thin during the
transition period, although the Big Four Japanese brokerage
firms are expected to be active, one Japanese trader said.</p>
<p>Sony rose 210 yen to 8930 yen ($1.41 to $60.07), TDK
gained 120 yen to 7290 yen, Fanuc advanced 180 yen to 7390
yen, and Kyocera added 180 yen to 9040 yen.</p>
<p>Also higher were CSK, up 180 yen to 6290 yen, and Hirose
Electric, up 180 yen to 7310 yen.</p>
<p>Speculators' darling Jujo Paper rose 24 yen to 945 yen,
while Sanrio gained 120 yen to 8450 yen.</p>
<p>But a broad range of shares were lower, including steel,
real estate and some financial issues.</p>
<p>Kawasaki Steel fell 20 yen to 525 yen, Kobe Steel fell 18
yen to 520 yen, and NKK dropped 13 yen to 542 yen.</p>
<p>London's day began on a positive note, with the
broad-based index charging to intraday peaks. But the advance
couldn't be sustained, analysts said, on the perception that
more corporate downgradings are likely to be in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Moreover, dealers said investors were agitated by
sterling's slump, which came after Chancellor of the
Exchequer John Major failed Tuesday to mention plans for the
pound's entry into the exchange-rate mechanism in an economic
debate in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>"The market is realizing that {ERM membership} will take
longer than anticipated," one market maker said. "Some of the
euphoria is evaporating."</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index was up
3.8 points at 2364.7. The Financial Times 30 Share Index fell
1 point to 1865.7. Volume was 427.5 million issues compared
with 385.7 million shares Tuesday.</p>
<p>Reuters continued to attract attention after collapsing
184 pence ($3.34) Tuesday. Market watchers said they were
awaiting news from an analysts' meeting in the U.S., where
47.9% of the shares are held. "The jury's still out on
Reuters for the short term," one trader said. The stock
gained 18 pence to #10.63 on volume of 5.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, oil stocks "held the market together," one
trader said, as the sector gained ahead of the start of the
full ministerial OPEC meeting. News that Iraqi troops were
massing at the Kuwait border also gave the sector a fillip,
as did a sharp gain in August Brent crude prices.</p>
<p>British Petroleum rose 3 pence to 343 pence, Enterprise
increased 11 pence to 687 pence, and Shell Transport &
Trading lost a pence to 488 pence.</p>
<p>Another oil stock, Lasmo, fell 3 pence to 445 pence after
the company failed to beat market forecasts with an interim
pretax profit increase of 22%.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Paris, Brussels,
Madrid, Amsterdam, Stockholm and Zurich. Shares ended lower
in Milan, and mixed in Frankfurt. South African gold stocks
closed higher.</p>
<p>Stocks also ended higher in Hong Kong, Sydney, Singapore,
Taipei and Seoul, mixed in Manila, and lower in Wellington.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
