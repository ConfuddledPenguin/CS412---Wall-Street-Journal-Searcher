	<p class="article-leader">Your June 11 page-one article "Blow to Brokers" presents a
skewed view of the status of customer-broker arbitrations.
   The notion that securities firms suddenly have become
concerned with the prospect that the arbitration system may
threaten their financial well-being is as absurd as it is
ironic. After pursuing a single-minded effort to deny
customers access to the courts, the securities industry
apparently has undertaken to establish that customers now
have the upper hand. To emphasize this, you cite "a surge in
punitive-damage awards," noting that punitive-damage awards
were handed down in 21 instances since May 1989. You fail,
however, to mention that this represents about one-third of
1% of the 6,101 arbitration cases that the article notes were
filed in 1988. Somehow it is difficult to believe that these
results have caused Wall Street brokers to quake before their
computers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The fact is that the awarding of punitive damages is still
unusual. But customers in some states (such as Georgia,
Florida and Arizona) are far more likely to recover punitive
damages than those in other states (such as New York, where
the largest number of claims are filed).</p>
<p>As long as customers do not receive uniform treatment
regardless of their state of residence, the system has
failed.</p>
<p>Even where customers are successful, most arbitration
awards do not cover the full amount of their losses.</p>
