	<p class="article-leader">Saddam Hussein surely knows how to spoil a party. The
Iraqi leader has been the annoying buzz at the gala
celebrating the end of the cold war. But Western political
leaders have preferred to ignore him, since they are having
such a good time.
   It's been more fun, in the mood of general revelry, to
withdraw military power, especially from the Mediterranean.
All summer, Congressional Democrats have been ridiculing a
Pentagon plan to build a base at Crotone, in southern Italy.
The base would enable NATO to project air power throughout
the Middle East. "Given the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, why
do we need another NATO air base?" asks Senator Jim Sasser.
Rep. Pat Schroeder, eager to save domestic bases, calls the
Crotone base "a waste of money."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, the U.S. announced that it was closing two
Mediterranean bases in Greece, to consolidate forces on a
single base on Crete. Greek leftists rioted against any U.S.
military presence.</p>
<p>On Monday, the usually sensible Rep. Les Aspin said he
would oppose future production of the B-2 Stealth bomber,
which can evade radar and hit terrorist or other targets. In
May, the Canadian defense minister announced that, owing to
global peace, NATO was cancelling plans for a fighter
training base where pilots from 11 nations would have learned
to fly low-altitude attack missions.</p>
<p>But Saddam Hussein's annoying buzz is now so loud it
should be heard even above the din of Europhoria. U.S. forces
already have started exercises in the Persian Gulf. Maybe
it's time to put away the party hats and remember that
history hasn't ended.</p>
<p>At first glance, Mr. Hussein's outrageous bullying of
Kuwait seems like lunatic belligerency. His thuggery diverts
attention from Israel, over whom the Arabs have been winning
propaganda victories of late. Moreover, it dashes Mr.
Hussein's chances of becoming the indisputed leader of the
Arab world. This episode has spooked a lot of Arab leaders
who were happy to cheer him on as he threatened to gas half
of Israel. Now moderate Egypt is acting like the keystone of
the Arab states.</p>
<p>But there are kernels of rationality in his recent
behavior. Iraq's peace with Iran now looks like part of a
larger strategy. Some of the nearly 700,000 Iraqi soldiers on
the Iranian border now can be directed toward easier prey.
Iraq has twice as many soldiers as Kuwait has citizens. With
threats that it would "break necks," Iraq now is demanding
"massive reparations" for alleged Kuwaiti oil thefts (in
reality both sides seem to be stealing from each other). Iraq
also seeks forgiveness on the $10 billion debt it owes
Kuwait. Yesterday's diplomatic moves suggested that the
extortion was likely to work.</p>
<p>This week's events also signal that the Iraqi dictator is
willing to serve as OPEC's enforcer. The fall in oil prices
has put restraints on the amount of money Mr. Hussein could
spend on his war machine. His government has said it would
like to see oil at $25 a barrel, and he clearly is willing to
intimidate Kuwait or the United Arab Emirates if they
continue to violate their quotas. Remember that Mr. Hussein
bombed the UAE oil rigs in 1986 because he thought the
country was not supporting him sufficiently in the war with
Iran.</p>
<p>The Saudis, though frightened by Mr. Hussein's thuggery,
clearly appreciate Iraqi efforts to boost prices. We may yet
see the restoration of the Iran-Iraq-Saudi dominance of OPEC
that led to the ruinous price rises of the 1970s.</p>
<p>For the past several years, while the West studiously has
been looking the other way, Iraq has built up a substantial
munitions industry and one of the world's largest armies. Mr.
Hussein builds his own ammunition, mortars, bombs and
missiles. Though his attempts to get a supergun were foiled,
he has no trouble buying other weaponry, often from Europe.
The U.S. State Department resists any attempt to impose even
economic sanctions on the country. The European diplomatic
posture has been to lay low. Kuwait gave more than $30
billion in military aid; obviously appeasement doesn't work.</p>
<p>Mr. Hussein's violent rise has transformed the Middle East
problem. The major flashpoint is no longer the Syrian-Israeli
dispute. Now, the eye of the storm is in Baghdad, and it
radiates out in all directions, militarily and economically.</p>
<p>Mr. Hussein personifies the type of military menace likely
to persist and grow even if the Soviet threat fades (itself
no safe assumption, given the Soviet Union's huge and
undiminished strategic arsenal). Aside from humanitarian
considerations, Western interests would be immediately
jeopardized by an invasion of Kuwait and a newly militant
OPEC. In today's exquisitely interdependent world, we need to
think again about the ancient military mission known as
suppression of piracy. Today's pirates come with chemical and
conceivably even nuclear weapons, and aren't likely to be
deterred by the mantra, "peace is breaking out all over."</p>
