	<p class="article-leader">London United Investments PLC agreed in principle with
creditors on a debt-payment plan under which the British
insurance holding company probably will pay less than full
value on as much as #1 billion ($1.82 billion) in potential
insurance liabilities.
   The company has been managed by two court-appointed
administrators since May, when it failed in a seven-week
effort to find new funds to meet potential U.S. liability
claims. The insurance holding company's collapse ranks among
the biggest insurance industry debacles in the London market
in recent years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, the company's administrators said they intend
to sell several insurance units and broking assets to raise
funds to meet some future claims. The company said the most
significant unit on the auction block is Hartford,
Conn.-based First Reinsurance Co. A company official said
First Reinsurance's net asset value is about $25 million. All
told, the disposals are likely to raise less than $100
million, he said.</p>
