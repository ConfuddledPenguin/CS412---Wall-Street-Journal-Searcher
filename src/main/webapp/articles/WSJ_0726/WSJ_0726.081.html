	<p class="article-leader">KITIMAT, British Columbia -- Striking workers at Alcan
Aluminium Ltd.'s smelter here soundly rejected a tentative
three-year contract reached Tuesday, setting the stage for a
possible shutdown of the plant.
   "We're a little surprised and a little disappointed" by
the workers' rejection of the pact, said Alcan spokesman
Allan Hewitson. The proposed accord, which was rejected by
57.4% of the workers, called for annual wage increases of 6%
in each year of the pact, plus other benefits, including an
immediate signing bonus of 1,500 Canadian dollars (US$1,297)
per worker.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Management personnel had managed to keep the smelter
operating since midnight Monday, when about 1,600 members of
the Canadian Association of Smelter and Allied Workers union
walked off their jobs as the previous two-year contract
expired. Most of the workers are employed at the smelter,
though a few operate Alcan's neighboring hyrdo-electric power
generating plant.</p>
<p>Mr. Hewitson said Tuesday that management workers could
keep the 260,000-metric-ton per year aluminum smelter running
for about 48 hours, pending ratification of the proposed
contract. He wouldn't immediately confirm yesterday whether
the smelter would be shut down, in view of the vote results.</p>
<p>"We're reviewing the options that we have and we'll be
making a fuller statement later," he said.</p>
<p>It wasn't immediately clear why the workers rejected the
pact, though some workers said before the vote they viewed
the proposed 6% annual wage increases as inadequate, once
inflation is taken into account. The pact provided for
cost-of-living-allowance payments in the contract's third
year, but no such payments in years one and two.</p>
<p>It wasn't apparent late yesterday afternoon whether any
new talks were planned between the sides.</p>
<p>Montreal-based Alcan, North America's biggest producer of
primary aluminum, with large operations in Quebec, depends on
the Kitimat smelter for about 18% of its aluminum ingot
production, a spokesman said. The smelter exports about 85%
of its output to the Far East, with the balance destined for
the U.S. West Coast, Mr. Hewitson said.</p>
<p>A shutdown of the smelter would likely spark an increase
in aluminum prices, which have fluctuated in recent days in
response to developments in the contract talks.</p>
<p>In London Metal Exchange trading yesterday, aluminum
closed at about 72 U.S. cents per pound on a spot basis, up
from about 71 cents Tuesday. The three-month aluminum
contract price closed slightly above 73 cents a pound, up
half a cent from Tuesday.</p>
