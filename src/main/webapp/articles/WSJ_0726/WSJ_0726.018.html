	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- When Margaret Thatcher began her crusade to
deregulate Britain's economy a decade ago, Boris Fyodorov was
watching. As a young graduate at the Soviet state bank, part
of his job was to monitor Mrs. Thatcher's moves, from the
privatization of state industry to the abolition of foreign
exchange controls.
   "It was a good school. I learned a lot," Mr. Fyodorov
says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now he has the opportunity to put those lessons into
practice. Last month, at the tender age of 32, he was picked
by Boris Yeltsin to be finance minister of the Russian
Republic and charged with revamping its vast but moribund
economy. He hasn't worked out detailed plans, but one thing
is already clear: the free-market philosophy of Thatcherism
will be a guiding force.</p>
<p>"I want to create an infrastructure that will enable any
three people to get together and start a corporation," he
says. "The spirit of enterprise should be as free as
possible."</p>
<p>Among other ideas, he wants to turn Russia into a nation
of budding stock owners and private entrepreneurs, legalize
the black market in foreign exchange and introduce a new
concept into Soviet economics: strict monetary and fiscal
discipline. And, of course, he says, "We can and will use
lots of elements from the British economy."</p>
<p>If this sounds like wishful thinking, it probably isn't.
Mr. Fyodorov, an intense and pudgy man with thick spectacles,
is one of the most powerful and savvy members of a new
generation coming to the fore in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Unlike the much older men who have made policy under
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev over the past five years,
these newcomers are scathing about the failings of
perestroika and unfettered by socialist ideology. They preach
the virtues of private property and free markets. Some of
them, notably Gavriil Popov, the mayor of Moscow, and Anatoly
Sobchak, the mayor of Leningrad, have even shown their
disdain for the establishment by leaving the Communist Party.
And whether Moscow likes it or not, they have increasing
clout.</p>
<p>Newly elected regional and republican governments have
been piling the pressure on Moscow for greater autonomy and
an end to the centralized Soviet political and economic
structure. The election in May of the maverick Mr. Yeltsin as
president of Russia, the Soviet Union's most important
republic, has lent enormous weight to their efforts.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev has now started looking for ways to change
the system. But he is moving slowly, faced with the difficult
challenge of creating a new-style, looser Soviet federation
without causing the total breakup of the nation. The trouble
is, even the nimble Soviet leader is in danger of being left
behind.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, the governments of Russia,
Moldavia, Uzbekistan and the Ukraine, following the lead of
the three Baltic republics, have declared their
"sovereignty," ruling that local laws take precedence over
Soviet ones. Disputes are already breaking out between
central authorities and republican governments over who
should control what. And Mr. Fyodorov, the new Russian
finance minister, is in the thick of one of the most
important: "the war of the banks," as even the usually staid
Pravda has dubbed it.</p>
<p>On July 13, the Russian Republic's Parliament, accusing
central authorities of financial mismanagement, declared that
it was seizing control of all banking and monetary affairs on
its territory. The state bank, which has had monopoly control
of Soviet finances since the days of Lenin, immediately
struck back. The following Monday, it instructed all banks in
Russia to ignore the Parliament's decision, and issued a
chorus of warnings about coming financial anarchy.</p>
<p>"Like it or not, we must ensure that every republic
delegates its rights in the area of regulating monetary
affairs to the state bank of the U.S.S.R.," declared Viktor
Gerashchenko, the bank's chairman.</p>
<p>Behind the angry reaction was a very real concern that
each republic would go its own way, issuing its separate
currency and tearing apart the financial unity of the Soviet
economy. The Baltic republics of Latvia, Estonia and
Lithuania, in particular, are already planning to issue their
own currencies. But the bank's stance flies in the face of
what even Mr. Gorbachev concedes should be the guiding
principle of the new federation: that elected governments in
the republics, not Moscow bureaucrats, should have first say
in policy.</p>
<p>This week a truce was declared in the banking war, and Mr.
Fyodorov was instrumental in bringing it about. Meeting on
Monday with Mr. Gorbachev and senior government officials, he
insisted that Russia wasn't looking for a fight. The state
bank itself had created the confrontation by proposing to
revamp the entire national banking system without first
consulting the republics, he complained. And he suggested
redesigning the structure of central banking to give
republics a high degree of autonomy while preserving monetary
unity.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev seemed pacified. "We found common ground,"
Mr. Fyodorov says. "Confrontation is useless at this stage.
It will just hamper the reform process."</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean Russia is about to give up its
combative stance. On the contrary. Although Mr. Fyodorov
hasn't worked out exact details, he advocates that all 15
Soviet constituent republics should have their own central
banks. Its representatives would meet to coordinate policy on
such national matters as the level of bank reserves, money
supply and interest rates. That way, the bureaucrats who now
run the state bank would be more or less out of a job. And
inevitably, the republic that is by far the biggest and
richest -- Russia -- would then call the shots on Soviet
monetary policy.</p>
<p>"We need to move ahead, and if we switch then all others
will be obliged to do it," Mr. Fyodorov says. "It will be
like East and West Germany. . . . Russia could serve as West
Germany in the Soviet Union. If we are moving ahead
professionally, other republics, if they want to remain in
the union, would have to change their views." As to the
bureaucrats in central government, he says, "they should
understand that the declaration of sovereignty was no joke."</p>
<p>With a population of almost 150 million people and blessed
with 90% of Soviet oil, 70% of its gas and most of its gold
and mineral reserves, the Russian Republic is clearly a force
to be reckoned with. But revitalizing such a potential
economic giant after decades of mismanagement won't be easy.</p>
<p>Mr. Fyodorov is scathing about central authorities who
have tried to solve every problem by throwing money at it,
devaluing the ruble in the process to such an extent that it
is all but worthless. He sees one of his main tasks as
turning the ruble back into real money, through tight fiscal
and monetary policies.</p>
<p>As he moves to devise new economic policies, he won't be
alone. Under Mr. Yeltsin's direction, several leading
economists are drafting economic reform programs that are
likely to be far more radically free-market than anything the
central government is working on. One of them, a plan for Mr.
Yeltsin's first 500 days, is already nearing completion. It
advocates sweeping denationalization of state property
followed by measures to lift rigid price controls.</p>
<p>Mr. Fyodorov is wary of big-scale measures that are hard
to implement and end up as empty slogans. He favors smaller,
practical steps to encourage entrepreneurship and start the
process of deregulating the economy. That would involve the
Russian government using credit, tax and interest-rate
policies to establish a basic framework in which private
investment, both domestic and foreign, could thrive.
Companies could produce whatever was profitable, pay their
workers as they wish and do business with one another.</p>
<p>"The idea is to start the stone rolling. Now, it's very
old and heavy and standing still," he says. As the economy
starts to move, the policies could then be refined. Thus, "We
could set up stock exchanges, but they don't need to have the
same complexity as the New York Stock Exchange at first. But
probably in a year, we will have to fight insider trading,
too."</p>
