	<p class="article-leader">CHEVRON Corp. boosted its quarterly dividend to 77.5 cents
a share from 70 cents, payable Sept. 10 to stock of record
Aug. 6. The San Francisco-based oil company said the increase
reflected the company's strong earnings and cash flow for the
first half of 1990. Earlier this week Chevron reported a 60%
increase in second-quarter net income to $648 million, or
$1.83 a share, after $58 million of gains. Revenue rose 8.5%
to $8.9 billion from $8.2 billion.</p>
