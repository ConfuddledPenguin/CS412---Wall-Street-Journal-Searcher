	<p class="article-leader">Commerzbank AG said partial group operating profit jumped
18% in the first half of 1990 to 611 million marks ($377
million) from 520 million marks a year earlier, reflecting
wider interest margins and a comparatively weak first half
last year. Full operating profit advanced at only a slighter
lower rate.
   West Germany's third largest bank didn't provide any
specific data on full operating profit, which includes income
generated from trading for its own account. But Walter Seipp,
Commerzbank's chairman, indicated in response to a question
at a news conference in Frankfurt that full operating profit
grew about 15%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Seipp said he is "confident that the heretofore
delightful business developments will continue" in the second
half of the year. "In our projections for the current year,"
he said, "we are assuming a clearly double-digit rate of
increase in our partial operating profit."</p>
