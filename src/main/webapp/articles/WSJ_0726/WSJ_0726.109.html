	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange said it was
investigating what it termed fraudulent trades in cocoa
futures Tuesday.
   Orders to sell as many as 2,000 futures contracts caused
the cocoa market to drop sharply for more than an hour
Tuesday morning. When the orders were found to be of dubious
origin, prices rebounded as the futures contracts were bought
back.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But any traders who lost money as the market whipsawed
stand little chance of recouping their losses, the exchange
said. Exchange officers said these trades were legitimate.</p>
<p>The September cocoa contract opened Tuesday near Monday's
closing price of $1,259 a ton, then quickly dropped $57 as
big sell orders hit the floor. A cocoa analyst familiar with
the incident said orders to sell 1,500 to 2,000 contracts
were executed in lots of 300 contracts each.</p>
<p>At 11:15 a.m. EDT, buying started and the market regained
all of its losses. The September contract even rose to a new
daily high of $1,290 a ton before settling at $1,269, up $9.</p>
<p>James Bowe, senior vice president of the exchange, said
the trades were placed by someone who fraudulently
misrepresented himself in a phone call to the clerk of an
independent floor broker. Mr. Bowe said the exchange
immediately offered to guarantee that the floor broker who
executed the trades would have sufficient funds to cover his
losses.</p>
<p>"We did that to guarantee the integrity of the market,"
Mr. Bowe said. He declined to give other details, including
the name of the trader or the amount of money involved.
Figuring an average loss of $30 a contract -- about half of
the total price drop, since the trades were executed at
various prices -- the floor broker may have lost about
$600,000.</p>
<p>Andrea Corcoran, director of the division of trading and
markets for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said
she understands the floor broker "has now accepted
responsibility for the trades, which is entirely appropriate
for a situation like this." She wouldn't comment on whether
the CFTC was conducting its own investigation of the trades.</p>
<p>Floor brokers said they believe the clerk who accepted the
order was provided with a legitimate account number or that
he recognized the voice of the caller. The phone number given
to the clerk was supposed to be at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc. in New York, but when the clerk later called
the number it turned out to be a phone booth in the World
Trade Center.</p>
<p>A Prudential-Bache spokeswoman said that the trades in
question weren't entered by Prudential-Bache to the
independent floor broker. She added, "We are fully
cooperating with the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange so that
they can expeditiously complete their investigation."
Prudential-Bache is a unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America.</p>
<p>The exchange said that in addition to conducting its own
inquiry and notifying the CFTC, it also notified the U.S.
Attorney in New York.</p>
