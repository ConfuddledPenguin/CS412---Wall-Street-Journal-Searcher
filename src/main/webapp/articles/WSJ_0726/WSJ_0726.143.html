	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Sotheby's Holdings Inc. announced that Roger
C. Faxon, formerly of Columbia Pictures, has been appointed
chief operating officer and executive vice president of its
Sotheby's North America division.
   The move to a management position at the New York-based
auction house was an unusual one for Mr. Faxon, who has spent
most of his career in the entertainment industry. He
previously was the No. 2 executive to former Columbia
Pictures president Dawn Steel, serving as her chief
administrative and operating officer. Ms. Steel left the
studio last year when it was purchased by Sony Corp. Sony has
since installed new management, and a number of executives
who were there during Ms. Steel's tenure have left or been
replaced.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In his new position, Mr. Faxon will report to Diana D.
Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America, and will
oversee "management issues," among other responsibilities,
according to the company. Earlier in his career, Mr. Faxon
also served as an executive at Tri-Star Pictures and
Lucasfilm Ltd., where he oversaw the production of "Indiana
Jones and the Temple of Doom," among other films.</p>
