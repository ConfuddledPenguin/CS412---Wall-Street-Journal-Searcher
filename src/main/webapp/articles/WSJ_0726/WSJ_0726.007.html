	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Financially crippled Stotler Group Inc. said it
was pulling out of the futures brokerage business after
defaulting on $750,000 in short-term commercial paper
obligations.
   Stotler's announcement highlighted the precarious
financial underpinnings of many local futures trading firms,
whose capital accounts haven't kept pace with the exponential
growth in futures trading during the past decade. The
company's slide to the brink of insolvency also raises
questions about the ability and willingness of futures
industry regulators to rein in the activities of
well-established brokerage firms, said senior officials at
other futures brokerage firms here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We still don't have any idea how this could have happened
so quickly," said the head of a rival futures brokerage
house, who asked to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Stotler Group, whose chairman, Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, is
also chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, said it faces an
additional $7.6 million in debt payments in the next 30 days.
Stotler said it is weighing "all available options" to try to
shore up its finances, including restructuring or refinancing
its debt and selling subsidiaries and assets.</p>
<p>Stotler's rapid decline over the past two weeks has been a
blow to Mr. Mahlmann's prestige and his wallet. The taciturn
executive, who prides himself on his organizational acumen,
is serving his third consecutive one-year term as the top
elected official of the world's largest futures exchange.</p>
<p>He is also believed to have a substantial portion of his
net worth tied up in Stotler Group stock, which plunged to
$2.50 a share Tuesday on the American Stock Exchange, after
trading at about $8 a share two weeks ago. The stock didn't
open for trading yesterday. Mr. Mahlmann owns about 10% of
the outstanding shares of Stotler Group, according to
regulatory filings.</p>
<p>Stotler said it would wind down its futures brokerage
business "in an orderly manner over the coming days." Stotler
officials didn't respond to calls seeking elaboration.</p>
<p>Stotler Group officials have scrambled the past two weeks
to hold the company together after the Board of Trade said
its principal subsidiary, Stotler & Co., had failed to meet
capital requirements. Futures industry regulations require
firms that clear and guarantee customer trades to maintain a
capital cushion equal to at least 4% of customer-segregated
funds.</p>
<p>The default apparently was triggered when the company
failed on Monday to secure a capital infusion of about $10
million from a Taiwanese investor. To reduce its regulatory
capital requirements, Stotler & Co. on Tuesday gave up its
clearing memberships on all major futures exchanges. The firm
said it would clear its futures trades through another
futures firm, Brody, White & Co.</p>
<p>During much of the past two weeks, the firm was furiously
shipping customer accounts to other futures brokers to reduce
the amount of capital it was required to carry on its books.
The company said it reduced its customer funds to $120
million from $290 million.</p>
<p>Neither Stotler Group nor the Board of Trade have said
what caused the futures brokerage firm's failure to meet
capital requirements. Board of Trade members said the problem
appeared to stem from a dispute with regulators regarding
what assets could be counted as regulatory capital and how
that capital should be apportioned among the Stotler Group
holding company, the Stotler & Co. unit and other
subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Futures industry officials said it was unclear how Stotler
Group's Des Moines, Iowa, securities subsidiary, R.G.
Dickinson & Co., has been affected by its parent company's
woes. Stotler Group bought Dickinson after the small
broker-dealer underwrote Stotler Group's initial public stock
offering in 1988. Dickinson officials didn't return calls
seeking comment.</p>
