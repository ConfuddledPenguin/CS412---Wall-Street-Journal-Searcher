	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- A team of U.S. scientists found that a protein
released by the AIDS virus may promote the spread of Kaposi's
sarcoma, a skin cancer that afflicts many AIDS patients.
   The test-tube experiments mark the first direct link
between KS and the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus,
according to a report published in today's issue of the
British scientific journal Nature. The work could lead to
improved treatment for the cancer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The research, led by the National Cancer Institute's
Barbara Ensoli and Robert Gallo, showed the AIDS virus
produces a protein called Tat that promotes the growth of
cells cultured from KS lesions in AIDS patients. The finding
was confirmed when the scientists blocked further growth of
KS cells by adding antibodies to Tat.</p>
<p>"Tat may contribute to the induction or progression, or
both, of KS in HIV-1 {AIDS virus} infected individuals, thus
representing one of the links betwen HIV-1 infection and KS,"
the report concluded. But the authors emphasized that the
laboratory work doesn't "definitively establish a general
mechanism" for the genesis of KS and that other factors may
play a role. They noted that "the mechanisms by which Tat is
released and promotes growth are unknown."</p>
<p>Other experts also cautioned that identification of the
protein link might have remote impact on preventing KS. The
cancer responds poorly to chemotherapy and kills roughly 10%
to 15% of all AIDS sufferers.</p>
<p>Knowing that the Tat protein "can drive the {KS} tumor and
make it worse . . . doesn't explain why the tumor occurs in
the first place," observed Donald Jeffries, a virologist at
St. Mary's Hospital here.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he went on, the report "does lead to a
possible way for modifying the growth of the tumor." The
virologist said several pharmaceutical manufacturers are
trying to develop Tat inhibitors, intended to block
replication of the AIDS virus, as well as to slow the spread
of KS.</p>
<p>Pinpointing the Tat protein's role in specific cell growth
eventually might benefit other cancer victims, a second
scientist suggested. "There may be many more of these
{proteins} we don't know about yet, and these may have roles
in other types of cancer," said Ken Powell, who heads
antiviral research at Wellcome PLC, a British drug concern
that makes AZT, the only antiviral drug approved for AIDS
treatment.</p>
<p>Dr. Gallo, a lead author of the report and head of NCI's
laboratory of tumor cell biology, shared that view. In a
statement released by the institute, he said: "These results
demonstrate for the first time that a viral regulatory
protein can be released as a biologically active molecule
capable of directly inducing proliferation of the cell which
leads to a human tumor." The work "may open up a new approach
for evaluation of the multiple functions of this" protein and
similar types of molecules. Dr. Gallo declined requests for
interviews.</p>
