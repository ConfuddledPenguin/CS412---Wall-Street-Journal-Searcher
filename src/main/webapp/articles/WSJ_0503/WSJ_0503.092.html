	<p class="article-leader">LEXINGTON, Mass. -- Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc., a
small research and development company, said it reached an
agreement with Monsanto Co.'s NutraSweet Co. involving
research on a salt substitute.
   Although sugar substitutes have been available for years,
and fat substitutes have begun to come on the market,
researchers say that salt substitutes have thus far failed to
satisfy the human craving for salt. The simple molecular
structure of salt makes it difficult to alter chemically.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Charles J. Casamento, president and chief executive
officer of Interneuron, said the company will use the
NutraSweet funding to pay for research "to look at compounds
that will satisfy salt cravings in animals." If it finds such
compounds, the company would sign a more extensive research
agreement. "We believe the technology is there that will let
us come up with something," he added.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, NutraSweet, a maker of sugar
substitutes, gets a nine-month option to license from
Interneuron the right to develop and market any salt
substitute or salt enhancer developed. Terms weren't
disclosed.</p>
<p>NutraSweet, based in Deerfield, Ill., said that
Interneuron's work is at the "very early stages."</p>
