	<p class="article-leader">Derlan Industries Ltd., Toronto, said it expects to report
a second-quarter pretax gain of about nine million Canadian
dollars (US$7.7 million) from the sale of a subsidiary.
   The diversified manufacturing concern reported net income
of C$3.5 million for the year-ago quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Derlan said the gain would result from the recently
completed sale of its Carte International Ltd. unit to
Federal Industries Ltd., Winnipeg, Manitoba, for about C$22
million. Carte makes transformers. Federal Industries is a
retailing, transportation and metals distribution concern.</p>
<p>Derlan said first-quarter net income fell to C$1.7
million, or 11 Canadian cents (9.4 U.S. cents) a share, from
C$5.8 million, or 34 Canadian cents, a year earlier, when
earnings included a one-time gain of C$1.3 million, or 7
Canadian cents. Sales rose to C$102.3 million from C$101.9
million.</p>
<p>In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Derlan
