	<p class="article-leader">While Mikhail Gorbachev flounders with perestroika,
popularly elected Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
speeds forward with the reformation of Mexico's formerly
inert economy. Yesterday he submitted to the Mexican Congress
a bill to eliminate restrictions on private-sector ownership
of banks. Simply put, he plans to privatize Mexico's banking
system, nationalized in 1982 by former President Lopez
Portillo. To do so, Mr. Salinas will have to change the
constitution, and this takes a two-thirds vote by Congress.
But with the support of the free-market opposition party,
PAN, the President should be able to achieve this necessary
step in the continuing economic liberalization of Mexico.</p>
