	<p class="article-leader">B.F. Goodrich Co., Akron, Ohio, said it will have a
second-quarter gain of about $20.5 million from the sale of a
warrant to Michelin Group of France.
   The warrant would have enabled B.F. Goodrich, a plastic,
specialty chemical and aircraft-product concern, to purchase
up to 7% of Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Michelin said it completed the acquisition of Uniroyal
Goodrich, also based here.</p>
<p>In the 1989 second quarter, Goodrich earned $52.3 million,
or $1.98 a share, on sales of $628.8 million.</p>
<p>Uniroyal Goodrich was formed in 1986 when Goodrich and
Uniroyal combined their tire businesses into a joint-venture
partnership. In 1988, Goodrich sold its 50% interest in
Uniroyal Goodrich to a group of investors organized by
Clayton & Dubilier of New York.</p>
<p>At that time, Goodrich received a warrant to purchase
indirectly as much as 7% of Uniroyal Goodrich.</p>
