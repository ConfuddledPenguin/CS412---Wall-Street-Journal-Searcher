	<p class="article-leader">Money market mutual fund investors are starting to look
for higher yields elsewhere.
   Money fund assets fell $3.5 billion in the week ended
Tuesday, the largest drop in more than two years, excluding
end-of-year seasonal declines, according to IBC/Donoghue's
Money Fund Report. Total assets of the 426 taxable funds
tracked by the Holliston, Mass., newsletter were $378.1
billion, the lowest in 12 weeks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The drop was entirely attributable to individual
investors; assets of funds open only to institutions rose
$948.3 million.</p>
<p>"Money fund investors are pretty sophisticated," said
Brenda Malizia Negus, the newsletter's editor. "They're
locking in higher yields elsewhere . . . in CDs or
Treasurys."</p>
<p>Yields on taxable money funds declined in the latest week,
while yields on certificates of deposit and Treasury
securities rose. The average seven-day compound yield of the
funds declined to 7.96% from 7.99%. Compound yields assume
reinvestment of dividends.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the yield on a six-month T-bill sold at
Monday's auction rose to 8.49% from 8.35% the week before.
Six-month CDs sold by major brokerage houses are currently
yielding an average of 8.37%, according to Banxquote Money
Markets, a New York information service.</p>
<p>Yields are even better for longer-term investments.
Treasury notes and bonds, for instance, are yielding more
than 9% on maturities of two years and longer. Some big banks
are offering more than 9% on five-year CDs of more than
$90,000.</p>
<p>Some of the withdrawals from money funds also went to pay
income taxes and some went into bond mutual funds, said
Walter Frank, chief economist for Donoghue's.</p>
<p>Until the past few weeks, money fund assets had been
increasing steadily, sometimes more than $1 billion a week.
The most recent big drop was $3.6 billion at the end of 1989,
which was attributed to normal end-of-year withdrawals.
Assets fell $3.7 billion at the end of 1988. Yields have
fallen more than 1.5 percentage point since peaking April
1989, after months of steady increases.</p>
<p>Average maturity of the funds investments -- such things
as commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs), bank CDs and
short-term Treasury securities -- remained at a relatively
long 44 days in the latest week. Longer maturities usually
are considered a sign that portfolio managers think rates are
falling because the longer maturities enable the managers to
retain comparatively high yields longer.</p>
<p>The average maturity has been longer than 40 days for
several months. The range has been 29 to 53 days in recent
years.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
fell to 7.67% from 7.69%. The average 30-day simple yield
slipped to 7.68% from 7.69%, while the average 30-day
compound yield went to 7.98% from 7.99%.</p>
<p>Assets of tax-free money funds also fell, although yields
rose. Assets of the 220 tax-exempt funds tracked by
Donoghue's fell $1.2 billion, to $75.4 billion. The average
seven-day compound yield of the tax-free funds rose to 5.79%
from 5.74%. That's equal to 8.04% for an investor in the 28%
tax bracket and to 8.64% for someone paying 33%. Tax-free
yields have moved in response to the supply of tax-exempt
securities in recent months, said Mr. Frank of Donoghue's.</p>
<p>The average maturity of the tax-free funds shortened to 41
days from 43 days.</p>
