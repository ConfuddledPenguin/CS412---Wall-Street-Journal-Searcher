	<p class="article-leader">Southern Co. reported its first-quarter earnings plunged
43% to $113.1 million, or 36 cents a share, because of higher
operating costs and sagging electricity sales.
   The drop marks the third consecutive quarterly earnings
decline for the operator of energy utilities in the
Southeast. In the 1989 first quarter, Atlanta-based Southern
earned $197 million, or 62 cents a share. Revenue slipped to
$1.67 billion in the most recent quarter from $1.68 billion a
year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The earnings slump comes at a time when the beleaguered
company faces new federal inquiries into alleged business
ties between Southern and the son of the company's chief
executive officer, Edward L. Addison, as well as a continuing
federal tax investigation into the company's accounting for
spare parts.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Southern
closed at $23.625, down 50 cents.</p>
<p>In recent quarters, Southern has been smarting from its
Georgia Power Co. unit's continuing rate dispute with the
Georgia Public Service Commission over the utility's Vogtle
nuclear-power plant. The commission has allowed Georgia Power
to recover only $218 million -- over a 10-year phase-in
period -- of the company's estimated $413 million in cost
overruns at the plant's No. 2 unit alone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the latest quarter shows Southern carrying the
higher fixed costs for that unit, as well as the No. 4 unit
of its Scherer nuclear plant near Macon, Ga. "This was a
significant factor in our cost increases," a company
spokesman said. "Not only were we not carrying them last
year, but we've not received the rates to fully recover the
costs." The spokesman didn't specify the amount of the cost
increase.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Southern's kilowatt-hour sales fell
1.2% in the first quarter because of mild winter
temperatures, which affected the entire industry. The trend
apparently carried over through April, according to the
spokesman, which could hurt second-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>The second-quarter results could be further affected by a
Mississippi Supreme Court ruling in April that the state's
four-year-old Performance Evaluation Plan is invalid.
Southern said the plan allowed residential electricity rates
for its Mississippi Power Co. unit to be automatically
adjusted according to its financial condition and
performance.</p>
<p>But if the court's decision to curtail the plan as of
April 30 stands, Mississippi Power may have to refund as much
as $75 million to customers.</p>

<p>A SOUTHERN CO. REQUEST to the Georgia Public Service
Commission for a $413 million rate increase was made to
recover the company's investment in the No. 2 unit of its
Vogtle nuclear power plant, as well as other costs of
providing services. In earlier editions it was misstated that
the $413 million was for cost overruns at the plant.</p>
