	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Budget Committee rallied behind a
plan to reduce the federal deficit by $43 billion by spending
less on defense and domestic programs than either the House
or the White House has proposed.
   After weeks of bickering and back-room bargaining, Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser (D., Tenn.) won support for a
$1.23 trillion fiscal 1991 spending plan from all 13
Democrats on the panel as well as from Iowa Republican Sen.
Charles Grassley.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sen. Sasser called the plan "the largest single
deficit-reduction package we have passed in more than a
decade," and said it demonstrates that Congress can come up
with a budget without first negotiating with President Bush.
It also demonstrates Sen. Sasser's horse-trading ability: To
assemble a majority on his divided committee, he proposed no
cuts in farm subsidies whatsoever.</p>
<p>The senior Republican on the budget panel, Sen. Pete
Domenici of New Mexico, predicted flatly that Congress won't
adopt the tax increases or spending cuts outlined in Sen.
Sasser's plan except as part of a pact with Mr. Bush. "There
is no way to get from where we are to where we have to be"
without a so-called budget summit, he said.</p>
<p>Sen. Sasser said he hopes to bring the budget to the floor
of the Senate within 10 days. There it is certain to run into
fire from those who would cut defense spending more and
domestic spending less, and from others, including
influential Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), who would cut defense
spending less.</p>
<p>The committee's budget essentially embraces all the tax
increases in the president's budget -- and then some. It
calls for $13.9 billion in tax increases plus $6.2 billion in
unspecified user fees. The House has a similar tax number,
but only $1.4 billion in fees.</p>
<p>For the Pentagon, the Senate plan calls for cutting $13
billion from projected outlays in fiscal 1991, which starts
Oct. 1. That's more than the $11.5 billion in the budget
narrowly approved in the House this week and far from the
$3.2 billion in cuts in President Bush's budget, a figure the
administration itself has all but abandoned.</p>
<p>Sen. Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, is
recommending a $10 billion cut. He termed the budget
committee's spending cuts "deeper than I believe can be
justified by the changes in the threat" from abroad and said
they would require sharp cutbacks in troop levels. But Sen.
James Exon Jr. (D., Neb.), who described himself as Sen.
Nunn's "right-hand man," voted with Sen. Sasser yesterday and
said he will do so on the floor.</p>
<p>The Budget Committee also backed a sharp, $30 billion
reduction from projected levels in defense spending authority
-- essentially the sum to be deposited in the Pentagon's
checkbook to be spent over several years. The committee backs
$285.6 billion in spending authority, compared with $283
billion in the House budget. Sen. Nunn is calling for $289
billion. The Bush budget proposes $306.9 billion.</p>
<p>The Senate committee's plan would spend substantially less
on domestic programs than would the president's budget, which
Democrats have criticized harshly. It would cut $3.6 billion
from projected spending on nondefense discretionary programs,
a category that includes everything from foreign aid to
housing assistance, compared with cuts of only $200 million
in the Bush budget and an increase of $3.7 billion in the
House budget.</p>
<p>Although the total is stated boldly in the plan, the
specific cuts aren't. When pressed, Sen. Sasser said the list
includes saving $300 million next year, and billions in the
future, by terminating a giant atom smasher called the
superconducting supercollider.</p>
<p>"There are no gimmicks here," Sen. Sasser asserted.
"There's nothing up our sleeve."</p>
<p>But Sen. Domenici noted that Sen. Sasser's plan shows
increased spending in almost every government function, and
then lumps the proposed cuts together in one big catch-all
category at the bottom. Calling the maneuver "ingenious,"
Sen. Domenici said, "Everyone can say . . . they voted to
increase something."</p>
<p>The Senate committee's budget does call for spending more
on entitlement programs, such as Medicare and federal
retirement programs, than President Bush has proposed. While
Mr. Bush would pare $5.5 billion from projected Medicare
spending, the committee would cut $2 billion and the House
$1.6 billion.</p>
<p>If the Senate backs the Budget Committee's proposal, then
the two houses of Congress will attempt to reconcile their
differences to come up with a guide for appropriations and
tax-writing committees -- unless talks with the White House
begin first.</p>
<p>In addition to the $43 billion deficit-reduction plan, the
Senate Budget Committee resolution calls for raising $11.1
billion by waiving penalties for Americans who pay their back
taxes and by intensifying tax-collection efforts. Sen. Sasser
included the amnesty scheme to win support from its author,
Sen. Kent Conrad (D., N.D.), and from Sen. Charles Robb (D.,
Va.), who added the figures together and said he was voting
for a $54.1 billion plan.</p>
