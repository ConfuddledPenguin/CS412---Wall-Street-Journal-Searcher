	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. wants to boost pensions
for 3,350 top officials including Chairman Roger B. Smith,
whose retirement pay would nearly double to about $1.2
million a year under the plan.
   The move is drawing fire from the United Auto Workers
union, which may make sweeter pensions an issue in this
summer's national contract talks with GM and the other
domestic auto makers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new pension formula, outlined in GM's proxy statement
issued last month, is being submitted to shareholders for
approval at the company's May 25 annual meeting. The new
formula would apply to GM's U.S. executives who retire after
Nov. 1, 1989. That includes Mr. Smith, who will retire Aug.
1.</p>
<p>The formula would be sweetened by including salary and
bonuses in calculating each executive's pension. Currently,
the formula reflects only an executive's base salary. The
change would be especially lucrative for top executives such
as Chairman Smith, for whom bonus is an important part of
total direct compensation.</p>
<p>GM contends that its executive pensions aren't
competitive, and that the change would merely bring its
pension formula up to prevailing standards.</p>
<p>The proposed change "is consistent with what a number of
other large companies do," said a spokesman. "GM had been
behind other companies in this area." He added that GM
doesn't have to submit the change to shareholders, but the
company's directors had decided to do so.</p>
<p>Despite GM's arguments, the timing of the proposed change
is sure to complicate the company's contract talks with the
UAW. A sizable portion of the union's rank and file wants to
make inflation-indexing for pensions a key contract demand.
The union's leadership believes the demand isn't realistic
and would prefer to focus on job-security issues, but GM's
move may bring the pension issue to the fore.</p>
<p>"Later this year we will be bargaining for hundreds of
thousands of retired union workers," UAW President Owen
Bieber said in a statement yesterday. "In view of GM's
largesse to its executives, there will be no excuse for the
corporation to be less than fully responsive to the needs of
our older members and retirees."</p>
