	<h3>Trump Shuttle Gains Some Market Share But Fails to Meet Soaring Expectations</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">One year after starting up, the Trump Shuttle has failed
to become the dominant carrier it had hoped -- and some
analysts wonder if it will any time soon.
   Although recent figures aren't available, Trump officials
now acknowledge that while the carrier has gained
significantly on rival Pan Am Corp., it is still far from the
60% passenger share it had hoped for. The airline's
high-profile owner, Donald Trump, also concedes the shuttle
isn't profitable yet, although he says its losses are small
and that it will turn a profit as early as next fall.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Such disclosures are hardly crushing blows to either the
shuttle or the rest of Mr. Trump's vast empire. But they come
at a time when the real estate mogul's business acumen has
already become a subject of media debate. And more
importantly, the disclosures raise some questions about the
value of the shuttle, which Mr. Trump has said he might sell
for $500 million to $600 million -- figures that some
analysts say may be too high.</p>
<p>In interviews, Trump officials were upbeat about the
shuttle's progress, and said they were only disappointed more
people weren't trying out the new operation. "It's been
tougher to get people to change their travel habits," says
Bruce Nobles, president of the Trump Shuttle. But some travel
agents say Trump's marketing tactics have had only mixed
results, and the carrier's refusal to offer more liberal
corporate discounts has kept away a lot of important clients.</p>
<p>"The momentum he had is over," says Ed Godwin, chairman of
Foster Joyce Travel Inc., a New York travel agency. "I don't
think he'll pick up much more business."</p>
<p>The shuttle market, which carries about four million
passengers a year between New York and Washington and New
York and Boston, is one of the industry's most prized routes.
Fares are high -- $119 one-way -- and the passenger clientele
is among the industry's richest. When he bought the shuttle
from Eastern Airlines for $365 million last June, Mr. Trump
had Trump-sized expectations. His flights would be on-time,
he vowed, his planes would be refurbished into luxury liners,
and the Trump name would quickly lure away Pan Am's
customers.</p>
<p>In fact, the Trump Shuttle's share of shuttle passengers
jumped from 20% in the summer to 48% in December, according
to Airline Economics Inc., a consultant firm that extracted
the results from government figures. More recent figures
aren't available, but both Trump and Pan Am officials agree
that neither carrier holds a substantial edge. "That's one of
the biggest market share increases in the history of the
airline business," boasts Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>But analysts say the comeback isn't quite so astonishing;
Trump's market share started off so low because Eastern was
in the middle of a strike and many people had switched to Pan
Am; traditionally, these passengers come back to their usual
airline and Eastern held a slight market edge over Pan Am in
the winter season before the strike.</p>
<p>"Inevitably, you would expect the airlines to split the
market 50-50," says Paul Karos of First Boston Corp. "The
products are pretty much the same."</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has tried to lure new passengers with a host of
new services and promotions. One of his more flamboyant
efforts was his new concierge desk, which handles various
arrangements for business fliers. While applauding the
thought, some travel agents say shuttle customers pick their
airlines more on schedules and frequent-flier plans. "I don't
see people using it with any great degree," says John
Richard, vice president of business development for U.S.
Travel Systems Inc.</p>
<p>Some agents also say Pan Am has been much more aggressive
with corporate customers, offering some clients $99 one-way
fares in exchange for large volumes of business. The Trump
Shuttle, agents say, only offers discounts on large bulks of
tickets bought in advance -- which many companies don't like
to do. Mr. Nobles acknowledges he may lose business this way,
but says he brings in more revenues with higher fares.</p>
<p>Since saying he might sell the shuttle last week, Mr.
Trump says numerous airlines have already contacted him. (At
least one carrier, America West Airlines, has publicly
expressed such interest.) "This is a trophy in the airline
industry," says Mr. Trump. Indeed, analysts say the shuttle's
takeoff and landing slots in the crowded New York and
Washington airports are valuable. But they also point out
that Mr. Trump's fleet is old. "I can't imagine it being
worth a whole lot more than it was paid for," says Mr. Karos.</p>
