	<p class="article-leader">In a statement at the U.S. Courthouse in Manhattan on
April 25, Arthur Liman, Michael Milken's lawyer, said:
   "It is an enormous accomplishment for Michael to have been
instrumental in finding the capital for hundreds of American
corporations, which are generating jobs, providing a
livelihood for hundred of thousands of people. . . . It is
Michael's hope that in the long run history will see his
violation in context and judge him not just on the basis of
his lapse but on the basis of the contributions that he made
to the economy and to the American people."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This reflects an error that is common among people who
have not been exposed to economics. It is like the claim that
increasing defense spending creates jobs or that increasing
imports destroys jobs. It fails to distinguish between what
happens in a part of the economy and what happens to the
economy in total, and it fails to recognize that there is an
equilibrating mechanism in the economy that tends to keep
capital and labor fully employed.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken did not save or create the capital that he
found for his corporate client. He attracted the capital from
the people who saved it -- mainly from savers who had put
their money in insurance companies, mutual funds and savings
and loans. He arranged for the sale of junk bonds to these
institutions. If the institutions had not bought the junk
bonds they would have invested the money in some other way,
presumably in some other corporation but possibly in home
mortgages.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken did not increase the net flow of capital into
investment. He altered the direction of the flow. There are
some corporations that received capital because of his
efforts. We know their names and Mr. Milken can point to
them. But there are corporations and potential home owners
who, as a result of his efforts, were unable to obtain
capital. We do not know their names, but they are real and
important.</p>
<p>Because he did not increase the total stock of capital,
and even if he did, Mr. Milken did not create jobs. Given a
reasonably stable monetary environment, and Mr. Milken had
nothing to do with that, people who seek jobs find jobs,
except for market frictions with which Mr. Milken had nothing
to do either. It is wrong to think that the people employed
in Mr. Milken's client corporations would not have been
employed there or elsewhere if it had not been for him.</p>
<p>The real issue is not the total flow of capital or the
total amount of employment. It is whether Mr. Milken's
efforts affected the quality of the investment made with the
flow of capital and consequently affected productivity and
incomes.</p>
<p>Here we must distinguish three kinds of cases:</p>
<p>a) The cases usually described on Mr. Milken's behalf
where it is alleged that he corrected a market imperfection
and improved the allocation of capital, making it more
productive. The argument is that the market had overestimated
the risks in junk bonds. As a consequence companies that
depended on raising money by issuing junk bonds would have
faced an unrealistically high risk premium in their cost of
capital and would have been unable to make investments with a
higher probable yield than the investments actually made by
companies that financed themselves in other ways. By finding
a market for these bonds that evaluated these risks more
properly, it is said, Mr. Milken helped capital to flow to
its more productive uses.</p>
<p>But there are two other kinds of possible cases.</p>
<p>b) Cases in which Mr. Milken nurtured and exploited a
market imperfection and by so doing made the allocation of
capital worse. These would be cases in which investment
decisions were made not by the ultimate savers but by agents
and dealers -- investment bankers and managers of financial
institutions -- whose motivation was not the total
productivity of the investment but the short-run cash flow
that could be extracted as commissions, salaries and trading
profits. The money of the passive savers was diverted into
investments whose probable yield was less than could have
been earned elsewhere and this reduced the productivity of
investment.</p>
<p>c) Cases that had no effect on the real productivity of
investment but only shifted wealth around. Financial
institutions bought junk bonds whose proceeds were used to
buy existing equities at prices well above the previous
market prices and to pay commissions to the managers of the
deals. The corporation does not acquire any additional
capital in the process. It is only the shell for the
transaction. The previous stockholders have a gain, the
managers of the transaction have their fees and the investors
in the financial institutions have assets for which they paid
much more than markets previously thought they were worth and
whose riskiness they did not prefer. In the case of the
savings and loans these ultimate investors turned out to be
the taxpayers.</p>
<p>I do not know in what proportions these kinds of cases
existed, and I do not think that anyone else knows either.
But I guess that the second and third kind were most
important. I think that partly because, at least toward the
end, when the flotation of junk bonds was largest, they came
more and more to involve well-established corporations that
probably would have had little difficulty raising capital in
other ways. Also, I am impressed by the persistence of Mr.
Milken's dominance of the junk bond market and by the size of
his earnings. I wonder, what was his unique asset that
allowed that? His initial insight that junk bonds were
undervalued would, I suppose, not have remained unique for
very long. But his Daisy Chain of money managers willing to
subordinate the interests of clients to whom they had
fiduciary responsibilities, and even to take the risk of
going to jail, may have been more durable.</p>
<p>But this is only a speculation. If Mr. Milken's
contribution to the American economy is to be an important
factor in determining his sentence, a more serious effort
should be made to evaluate that contribution than has been
made to date. But I am not hopeful of finding an answer.</p>
<p>Certainly Mr. Milken can afford to hire an econometrician
who can "prove" that his contribution was large and positive.
Probably the government can afford to hire an econometrician
who will "disprove" it. And even the most objective analyst
will probably be unable to render a verdict. By the time
enough history has passed to see how Mr. Milken's
transactions have come out so many other things will have
happened that it will be impossible to isolate the effect of
his activities from all the other noise in our data.
Moreover, we shall never be able to measure the effect of the
loss of confidence in financial markets generally that his
activities caused.</p>
<p>Anyway, where is it written that criminals should be
evaluated by the size of their contribution to the GNP --
especially when the contribution was a byproduct of
self-interested action?</p>
<p>The GNP does not include the value added by criminal
activities, like prostitution or drug trade, so I don't know
whether the Department of Commerce will include Mr. Milken's
value added.</p>
