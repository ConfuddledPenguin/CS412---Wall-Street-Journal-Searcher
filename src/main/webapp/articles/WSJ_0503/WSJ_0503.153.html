	<p class="article-leader">WEST CHESTER, Pa. -- Commodore International Ltd. said
heavy marketing efforts essentially wiped out profit during
its fiscal third quarter. Still, the battered personal
computer maker showed some signs of life.
   Commodore reported a profit of $200,000, or one cent a
share, in its fiscal 1990 third period, which ended March 31.
That's a 98% drop from a $12.4 million profit, or 38 cents a
share, in the year-earlier period. Sales eked out a 1.4%
gain, rising to $213.2 million from $210.2 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most of the decline in profit was due to "substantial
marketing investments" in the company's stronghold market,
Europe, which drove up operating expenses 28%, to $62.5
million from $48.8 million, Commodore said.</p>
<p>But the company noted that sales of its Amiga computer and
a group of machines compatible with International Business
Machines Corp.'s PC-AT computer increased "substantially"
during the period, more than offsetting a decline in the
ancient Commodore 64 family. Indeed, Commodore said the Amiga
accounted for almost 55% of its sales during the period. That
number should rise again during the coming months, as
Commodore rolls out the Amiga 3000, a much-hyped machine
aimed at the growing "multimedia" market.</p>
<p>"There's some reason for optimism," said Charles Frumberg,
an analyst with Mabon, Nugent & Co. in New York. "My sense is
that things are turning up." But Mr. Frumberg added that
"it's clear that the ball won't be going over the fence in
fiscal 1990."</p>
<p>For the first nine months of fiscal 1990, Commodore said
profit fell 92% to $5 million, or 16 cents a share, from
$60.2 million, or $1.88 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Sales dropped 9% to $689.2 million from $759.4 million.</p>
