	<p class="article-leader">Unocal Corp. said it agreed to acquire the Prairie
Producing unit of Placer Dome Inc. for about $336 million and
assumed debt. Placer is a Vancouver-based gold producer.
   The transaction, which includes $252 million in cash, adds
to Los Angeles-based Unocal's already substantial natural gas
reserves in East Texas and Louisiana and provides new
exploratory lands in geographical areas close to Unocal
operations. The buyer is a subsidiary of Union Exploration
Partners, a Houston-based limited partnership 95%-owned by
the oil giant.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two companies calculate Prairie's holdings
differently, but Prairie's proven reserves are estimated at
between 10.4 million and 15.7 million barrels of oil and
natural gas liquids, between 83 million and 105.5 billion
cubic feet of natural gas and about 20,000 acres of
exploratory land. Prairie also has interests in three
gas-processing plants.</p>
