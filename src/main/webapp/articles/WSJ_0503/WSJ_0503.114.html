	<p class="article-leader">CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Reg September shook his head in
disbelief. An elderly white-haired man who has spent most of
his adult life in exile with the African National Congress,
here he was watching officials of the ANC and the government
pose for pictures, standing shoulder to shoulder like old
schoolmates.
   "I didn't think I would live to see this," he said. "It's
a real breakthrough."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That these two bitter enemies could smile together for the
cameras yesterday was remarkable enough. But even more
astonishing, they retreated afterward into an old Cape Dutch
house for 18 hours of negotiations, scheduled over three
days, aimed at ending racial unrest and normalizing the
country's politics. The ANC, legalized in February after a
30-year ban, demands the lifting of the four-year-old state
of emergency, release of all political prisoners and return
of all exiles. Pretoria wants the ANC to disband its
guerrilla wing and end its armed struggle.</p>
<p>Both sides expressed high hopes for the negotiations,
which are aimed at setting the stage for a new constitution
that would bring equality to the nation's black majority. But
they also cautioned that in three days, they won't bring down
the pillars of apartheid, or racial segregation, nor come up
with a new dispensation of black-white power sharing.</p>
<p>Pretoria and the ANC remain far apart on their visions for
a post-apartheid South Africa: The ANC wants a simple
one-man, one-vote majority rule system, while the government
claims that will lead to black domination and insists on
constitutional protection of the rights of minorities,
including the whites. Rather, all the delegates agreed, these
initial meetings should be seen as the first steps down a
long and rocky road of racial reconciliation and a
fundamental restructuring of South African society.</p>
<p>"This is the first time in 78 years that a truly serious
meeting takes place between delegations of the African
National Congress and the succession of white governments
that have ruled our country for generations," said ANC Deputy
President Nelson Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison before
his February release. "It indicates the deadly weight of the
terrible tradition of a `dialogue' between master and servant
which we have to overcome."</p>
<p>All those gathered on the manicured lawns of the Groote
Schuur estate, which has housed people from diamond magnate
Cecil Rhodes to a series of South African prime ministers,
acknowledged history in the making and the great expectations
surrounding it. South African President F.W. de Klerk said
that government was committed to creating "a new, democratic
dispensation," and that the talks were part of the
"irreversible process of normalization" that he began by
removing the ban on 60 political organizations in February.</p>
<p>Mr. Mandela said that to live up to the expectations
building in the black community, the talks "must make a
decisive and historic contribution to the repudiation" of
apartheid, which has elevated the white minority to positions
of privilege and denied the black majority basic human
rights. "The black masses of our country," he warned, "demand
and expect fundamental change now -- and not tomorrow."</p>
<p>Of all the strange bedfellows in political history,
yesterday's photo opportunity provided some of the most
amazing pairings. Foreign Minister Pik Botha, famous for his
anti-communist diatribes in the past, stood next to Joe
Slovo, the head of South Africa's Communist Party, an ally of
the ANC. Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok rubbed shoulders
with Ruth Mompati, the ANC's director of administration who
left two children behind when she fled into exile in 1962.
ANC guerrilla commander Joe Modise peered over the head of
Kobie Coetsee, the justice minister.</p>
<p>Mr. Mandela even spoke Afrikaans. "The ANC wants to assure
the white community, including the Afrikaners," he said with
confidence, "that they have nothing to fear from the ANC."</p>
