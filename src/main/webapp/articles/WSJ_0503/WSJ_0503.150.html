	<h3>Are All Wall Street's New Warrants Really Warranted?</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Like Hollywood, Wall Street likes to clone
hits.
   Warrants on the Japanese stock market were quick successes
this year, so here come warrants on lots of other stock
indexes, too.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But after a year-long dearth of big new-product ideas on
Wall Street, efforts to make the most of investors' interest
in stock-index warrants are likely to produce lackluster
sequels, many market professionals say.</p>
<p>The most popular warrants have all been linked to Japan's
Nikkei 225-stock index. These warrants have provided an easy
way for big and small U.S. investors to profit from the Tokyo
market's slump. The warrants entitle holders to a cash
payment that varies with stock indexes' performance after
several years.</p>
<p>In total, at least seven Nikkei warrants issues have been
publicly underwritten in U.S. markets, and many more have
been privately placed here and abroad.</p>
<p>Now, investment bankers are plugging new national markets
into their formula. Salomon Brothers Inc. in recent weeks has
underwritten two small warrant offerings tied to the London
stock market's FT-SE 100 index; it is also looking at Dutch
and German issues. And the American Stock Exchange is seeking
to list three-year warrants linked to the 20-stock Major
Market Index in the U.S.</p>
<p>The European and U.S. warrants, however, aren't expected
to be nearly as popular with investors. Market professionals
point out that U.S. investors already have far more
alternatives available if they want to place a long-term bet
on the direction of those markets, or hedge their market
risk. In the U.S., the alternatives include stock-index
futures and options, all widely traded.</p>
<p>More broadly, big investors are showing increased
skepticism toward Wall Street innovations these days.</p>
<p>"Most new financial products just restructure income
streams from existing securities," says Jack Meyer, treasurer
of the Rockefeller Foundation. "There's always a haircut
built in so that the {Wall Street providers} make a little
money. Unless you have a very peculiar risk preference,
you're better off doing without."</p>
<p>Without investor support, many of Wall Street's
brainstorms aren't making it into the wider world. "Getting
the first deal done is a lot tougher than it used to be,"
says Ron Gallatin, a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. managing
director in charge of new products. Mr. Gallatin had led
Shearson's efforts last year to launch "unbundled stock
units," a way of creating three new securities from a single
share of common stock; Shearson eventually dropped the idea.</p>
<p>"Institutional buyers are a lot more old-fashioned than
people realize," Mr. Gallatin observes. "There's a perception
that it's the new things that have caused problems. It's much
easier to justify something old and tried, than something new
that you can't understand -- or do understand, but can't
explain to your pension committee."</p>
<p>The Nikkei warrants did well for two reasons. The first
was timing; many of the Nikkei warrants were launched just as
the Tokyo stock market began its swoon this past winter. The
put warrants, which represented a bet on a market drop,
soared 100% and more in value. That attracted plenty of
interest from U.S. investors large and small.</p>
<p>The Nikkei warrants also had an edge because U.S.
investors had long grumbled that the Japanese market was
overpriced, but lacked any ready way to put money on that
proposition. Although U.S. investors in theory could have
sold Japanese stock-index futures, doing so would have
required setting up a yen trading account, meeting Japanese
margin rules and monitoring their position during Tokyo
market hours (nighttime in the U.S.). "That's a little
scary," one large U.S. investor said.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Nikkei warrants are dollar denominated
and easily traded in the U.S. That appealed to small U.S.
investors -- as did the quick early profits.</p>
<p>But unless European markets tumble or soar in coming
months, it's hard to see how U.S. investors are likely to be
drawn to warrants on those markets. Furthermore, underwriters
say that the Securities and Exchange Commission is asking
plenty of questions about European market disclosure before
it is willing to approve U.S.-traded warrants for certain
European stock markets.</p>
<p>Investment bankers acknowledge that many of their new
products won't catch on, but they regard that as a bearable
cost of doing business. A successful product such as the
Nikkei warrants has already produced nearly $20 million in
underwriting fees alone in the U.S. and Canada. Since most
new products cost $1 million or less to develop, a success
ratio of one in 10 can still be profitable for Wall Street's
innovators.</p>
<p>Experimentation seems to be the rule at the American Stock
Exchange, too, as it seeks to list a three-year warrant on
the Major Market Index. (This index closely tracks the Dow
Jones Industrial Average.) "Traditionally the Amex has tried
to be more flexible and innovative about its new products,"
says Amex President Ken Liebler. "Some of them are hits and
some aren't. If they aren't hits, we move on."</p>
<p>Investment bankers predict that the Major Market Index
warrants may have some appeal for those individual investors
who prefer the warrants' three-year maturity to the much
shorter maturities of most stock-index futures and options.
"If you're an institution, you could probably simulate the
warrant yourself more cheaply with existing futures and
options," says one Wall Street new product specialist. "But
maybe it will have retail appeal."</p>
<p>And if the Amex's warrants should succeed on any scale at
all, expect a sequel to the sequel. "I could see a warrant
based on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index," another
new-products specialist says. "There's a tendency to have new
issues very similar to one another. People try to capture the
halo effect of a success."</p>
