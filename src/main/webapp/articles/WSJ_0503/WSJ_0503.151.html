	<p class="article-leader">HARTFORD, Conn. -- Northeast Savings F.A. reported a net
loss of $106.9 million, or $19.07 a share, for the fourth
quarter ended March 31 because of a write-down of good will
but said operations are showing "solid progress."
   A year earlier, it reported net income of $2.1 million, or
a net loss of four cents a share, after payment of preferred
dividends.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Northeast said that before the $110.3 million write-down
of good will, net was $3.4 million, or 22 cents a share.</p>
<p>George P. Rutland, chairman and president, said the good
will represented the value of having a unique two-state
thrift business in Connecticut and Massachusetts at a time
when interstate banking was restricted in the region. Due to
the passage of liberalized interstate banking laws, "that
franchise doesn't have the value it used to have," he said.</p>
<p>After the write-down, Northeast still has $90 million in
good will on its books. It previously filed a suit
challenging the Federal Office of Thrift Supervision's
requirement that good will can't be counted toward meeting
regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>Mr. Rutland said Northeast has been successfully reducing
its size. At the end of fiscal 1990, assets were $4.97
billion, down 37% from $7.94 billion a year earlier. While
retail deposits are down only 3% to $3.4 million, brokered
deposits are down 69% to $304.4 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Rutland said that over the past year Northeast sold
off all but $16.1 million of its $314.1 million junk-bond
portfolio, taking a $13 million loss.</p>
<p>For the year, Northeast reported a loss of $107.1 million,
or $20.27 a share, after writing down the good will. In
fiscal 1989, it had a loss of $12.9 million, or $4.40 a
share.</p>
