	<p class="article-leader">Eastman Kodak Co., showing the benefits of extensive cost
cutting, recorded a 6% drop in first-quarter net income,
better than analysts expected.
   Net fell to $199 million, or 61 cents a share, from $212
million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell to
$4.11 billion from $4.21 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Rochester, N.Y.-based photographic, chemical and
pharmaceutical concern said it restated 1989 results to
reflect the company's conversion to a calendar year. Kodak's
fiscal year began Dec. 26, and its quarters weren't uniform.
The change increased 1989 first-quarter net three cents a
share.</p>
<p>In Kodak's core photographic products division, domestic
sales fell 15%, but lower costs and higher film prices helped
boost operating earnings 50% to $219 million. Colby H.
Chandler, chairman and chief executive officer, who retires
this month, cautioned that the rate of earnings increase in
this division will moderate in the coming months.</p>
<p>Mr. Chandler said, "Barring unexpected developments in the
economy, we believe the recovery forecast for Kodak will come
about and that this will become increasingly clear in
subsequent quarters."</p>
<p>Kodak's results exceeded most analysts' expectations of 50
to 55 cents a share, but analysts said it's uncertain how
much the improvement in photographic products comes from
one-time cost-cutting benefits derived from a restructuring
program announced last year, as opposed to fundamental
improvements in operations.</p>
<p>Yet, despite the better-than-expected results, some
analysts expressed disappointment with the 3.5% decline in
operating profit, as earnings fell in Kodak's
information-system, chemical and health divisions.</p>
<p>"Even though the company's on track in terms of Wall
Street's earnings expectations, how can you be excited if
chemical profits are off 38% and information systems is off
20%?" asked David Nelson, an analyst at Shearson Lehman
Hutton. "That's not the stuff you write home about."</p>
