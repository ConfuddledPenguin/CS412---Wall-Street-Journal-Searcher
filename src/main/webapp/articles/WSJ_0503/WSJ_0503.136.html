	<p class="article-leader">MEXICO CITY -- President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sent
the Mexican Congress a proposal to return control of the
banking system to the private sector. The banks were
nationalized in 1982.
   The proposed constitutional amendment, which is sure to
spark debate, was hailed by businessmen in the Mexican
capital as the most significant step yet in Mr. Salinas's
rollback of the extensive state apparatus, as well as a boon
to companies seeking financing in Mexico.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If Congress approves the amendment to repeal the state's
banking monopoly, the government would try to cede operating
control of all 18 of the commercial banks in which it holds a
66% interest, officials said. The officials said the
government would be able to maintain a minority interest in
the commercial banks and would continue to operate state
development banks. One official said it was likely that
foreign investors would be permitted to buy into the
commercial banks, though through what means and to what
extent haven't been decided.</p>
<p>The proposal could face modifications. Some cabinet
members were said to want continued state control of one of
the big commercial banks. The president may have to do some
bargaining to shepherd the proposal through Congress.</p>
<p>The constitutional amendments would require support of
two-thirds of Mexico's 500-member Congress, as well as
approval by three-fourths of Mexico's state legislatures. Mr.
Salinas's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party has 263
Congress deputies, and can count on the 101 deputies of the
conservative National Action Party. But some analysts expect
defections within the ruling party's left wing, and stiff
resistance from the populist Party of the Democratic
Revolution, which commands a sizable bloc in Congress.</p>
<p>The bank nationalization in September 1982 caused a trauma
that Mexico's private sector hasn't gotten over. President
Jose Lopez Portillo expropriated the banks to stymie the
"vultures" he said were taking their money out of the country
after the oil-price collapse. Rather than staunch the flow of
capital, the nationalization only confirmed the conviction of
wealthier Mexicans that their money and property were
insecure at home.</p>
<p>In a letter to Congress, Mr. Salinas cited the
stubbornness of Mexico's eight-year economic crisis and the
country's conversion to a market-oriented economy as reasons
for returning the banks to private hands. "It's inadmissible
to have a state that owns too many things in a country with
so much poverty," the president said, adding that his plan
would allow the government to divert money from supporting
the banking system to such basic services as water and
electricity.</p>
<p>Since the nationalization, a parallel banking system has
sprung up made up of stockbrokerage and insurance firms. The
government encouraged the parallel bankers by ceding such
services as marketing treasury bills that had been the
exclusive domain of banks.</p>
<p>The government also has taken steps to make the commercial
banks more competitive by easing reserve requirements on
deposits and liberalizing the structure of interest rates.
But Mexico's economy, which grew at a brisk 2.9% last year,
increasingly needs a greater quantity of financing and more
sophisticated forms of financial engineering.</p>
<p>The opening would provide "more competitiveness, more
products and less personnel," says economist Rogelio Ramirez
de la O. "Now the banks are technologically 10 years behind
the times."</p>
<p>For investors, the most attractive banking franchises
would include Banco Nacional de Mexico S.N.C. and Bancomer
S.N.C., each of which has about a one-quarter share of
Mexico's commercial banking business. In third place is Banca
Serfin S.N.C., with a 17% market share. It's expected that
some of the heads of Mexican brokerage houses, who were bank
owners before the nationalization, will be active in the
bidding for the banks, if the proposal passes Congress.</p>
<p>Some investors had been anticipating a privatization,
though the announcement came sooner than had been expected.
Mexico's stock market had been one of the hottest in the
world this year, largely because investors were snapping up
bank stocks on rumors of a privatization.</p>
