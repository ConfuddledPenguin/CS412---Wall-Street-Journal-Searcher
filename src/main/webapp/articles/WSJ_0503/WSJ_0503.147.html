	<p class="article-leader">Exposing night-shift workers to an artificial "midnight
sun" can reset their biological clocks, thereby increasing
their performance, an experiment in Boston indicated.
   The experiment, carried out at the Brigham and Women's
Hospital, is the latest effort by scientists to manipulate
the rhythms of the human body that are synchronized with the
Earth's 24-hour day-night cycle. These natural rhythms, the
products of millions of years of evolution, are disrupted
when people work at night and try to sleep in the daytime.
The result is insomnia in the day and decreased alertness
during night work accompanied by a drop in performance and an
increase in fatigue-related accidents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new experiment found that the biological rhythms of
volunteers rapidly adapted to night work if the volunteers
worked the midnight shift under simulated sunlight rather
than the dimmer light of conventional indoor lighting.</p>
<p>The new experiment, reported in this week's New England
Journal of Medicine, was carried out by Charles A. Czeisler
and his colleagues at the Center for Circadian and Sleep
Disorders Medicine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, which
is affiliated with the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Czeisler
also heads a nonprofit organization called the Center for
Design of Industrial Schedules, which funded part of the
research.</p>
<p>Dr. Czeisler and his colleagues have developed a theory
that the body's "clock" that determines the sleep-wake cycle
is set each day by a bright light, presumably the rising sun.
Last year they reported they could change the "time" on this
internal clock by as much as 12 hours by the proper timing of
exposure to bright light.</p>
<p>A night worker runs into problems because, after working
under indoor lights during the night, he or she goes home and
at some point during the day, perhaps upon leaving work, the
worker is suddenly exposed to the brightness of the sun, the
researchers explained. This confuses the biological clock,
and the worker's body never fully adapts to night work.</p>
<p>In their latest experiment, the Boston scientists
determined the normal 24-hour biological rhythms of eight
healthy young men by monitoring their body temperature, heart
rate and the production of several body chemicals during a
week of regular bedtimes and wake-up times. During this
baseline period, the body temperature usually dropped to its
lowest point at about 5 a.m., or about two hours and 40
minutes before the men woke up.</p>
<p>For the next four weeks, the men reported to the
laboratory each night shortly before midnight and spent the
next eight hours working at a desk under a bank of lights
simulating the brightness of the early morning sun. They then
went home and slept in a totally darkened room from 9 a.m.
until 5 p.m.</p>
<p>By the sixth night of the experiment, the men's biological
clocks had changed "time." Their body temperatures reached
their lowest points 9.6 hours later than normal. The cycle
for the output of various body chemicals also shifted. Tests
also indicated that the daily ups and downs in alertness and
mental performance changed to later times of the 24-hour day.</p>
<p>By contrast, when the volunteers spent the night working
under ordinary indoor lights, there was little change in the
biological rhythms, and the rhythms even tended to move back
an hour or so rather than forward.</p>
<p>"Although this study is a step toward the development of a
practical treatment for maladaptation to nighttime work, a
number of important questions remain to be answered," the
scientists said. For instance, the most effective timing and
duration of the light exposures still have to be determined,
they explained.</p>
