	<p class="article-leader">WINNIPEG, Manitoba -- John Fraser, president and chief
executive officer of Federal Industries Ltd., said the
industrial holding company expects a 15% to 20% decline in
net income this year as a result of the "deteriorating
economic outlook" in Canada.
   In 1989, the company had net income of 45.6 million
Canadian dollars (US$39.1 million) or C$1.66 a share, on
revenue of C$2.28 billion. Mr. Fraser had said earlier this
year that the company expected 1990 net to be about the same
level.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The outlook now is worse than it was three, four, six
months ago," Mr. Fraser said. "{Interest} rates have stayed
surprisingly high; the {strong} Canadian dollar seems to defy
gravity; and we have a serious fiscal situation with the
deficit."</p>
<p>He said the Canadian manufacturing sector is already in a
recession.</p>
<p>Results for the first quarter of the year, due to be
released Wednesday, will be "quite dramatically" lower than
the year-earlier C$8.9 million, or 31 Canadian cents a share,
Mr. Fraser said. He declined to give a specific estimate.</p>
<p>"The first quarter is always our weakest quarter," he
said. "Nearly all of our businesses have a seasonal component
to them."</p>
<p>The company has four operating divisions: consumer
products, metals, industrial products and transportation.</p>
<p>Mr. Fraser said the company's newly acquired bookstore
chain, W.H. Smith, had been expected to report a
first-quarter operating loss. In addition, the economic
slowdown in Ontario and Quebec hurt Federal's trucking
operations in those provinces. Earnings at the metals group
also declined in the first quarter.</p>
<p>But Mr. Fraser noted that the company's first-quarter
earnings drop shouldn't be taken as an indication of the size
of the decline it expects for the year as a whole.</p>
<p>Federal Industries generates about 80% of its
approximately C$2.2 billion in annual sales from its steel
service and distribution centers as well as its trucking
division.</p>
