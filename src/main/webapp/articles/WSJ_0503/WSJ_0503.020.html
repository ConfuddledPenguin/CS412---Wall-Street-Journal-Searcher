	<p class="article-leader">HAMPTON, N.H. -- Henley Group Inc. plans to spin off its
two biggest units, Fisher Scientific Group Inc. and Pneumo
Abex Corp. in tax-free distributions to shareholders, Michael
D. Dingman, chairman and chief executive officer, said in an
interview.
   Mr. Dingman said that based on market values of similar
companies, Fisher could sell for about $350 million to $520
million and Pneumo could sell for about $350 million to $500
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, Henley Group Class A shares closed in
over-the-counter trading at $37.75, up $2, on volume of
419,100 shares. Holders would get one share in each company
for each Henley share held. Henley's remaining assets would
have a tangible book value of about $180 million, or $9 a
share.</p>
<p>Henley, spun off from Allied-Signal Corp. four years ago
with 35 different businesses that didn't fit in Allied, has
been reorganizing and spinning off companies in an effort to
increase shareholder value. Mr. Dingman hadn't previously
disclosed his plans for Fisher, a laboratory equipment maker
and Pneumo, an aerospace-parts firm.</p>
<p>Following the distributions, Henley Group would include a
brake company, a methanol plant in Chile, 14.7 million shares
of Itel Corp. and certain other investments. Mr. Dingman said
he expects to push to liquidate or dispose of those assets
during 1991.</p>
<p>A Henley spokesman said that the plan was approved by
Henley's board at a meeting last night. Mr. Dingman said he
plans to present it to shareholders at Henley's annual
meeting today. The plan also is subject to financing, to
Securities and Exchange Commission filings and to approval by
shareholders at a special meeting to be held in this year's
third quarter.</p>
<p>Before the spin-off of the two companies, Mr. Dingman said
that Henley will take a number of steps to inject equity and
remove debt from the units. He said those steps to
"deleverage" the units, would make them viable companies and
would boost the value of Pneumo's junk bonds outstanding.</p>
<p>Mr. Dingman said in an interview that as an independent
company, Fisher would have sales of about $900 million this
year and projected 8% to 10% growth next year. The maker and
distributor of scientific instruments and chemicals for
research and development laboratories is "a good growth
company," he said. Income before interest, taxes and
depreciation is expected to be $70 million this year and to
grow 12% annually, he added.</p>
<p>Pneumo Abex makes airplane landing gear and other
aerospace parts, and airport Jetways. It will sell its Abex
brake business to Henley for about $200 million as one of a
number of moves to reduce its heavy debt load.</p>
<p>As an independent company, Pneumo will have revenue of
about $700 million this year. It has strong cash flow with
earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation of $120
million, growing 7% to 8% a year, he said. Mr. Dingman said
that Pneumo's aerospace business is about 75% commercial,
with Boeing Co. its largest customer.</p>
<p>Currently, Pneumo has $1.03 billion in debt and just $77
million in equity. Mr. Dingman said that by the time its
shares are distributed it will have reduced debt to about
$678 million and increased equity to $330 million.</p>
<p>That will be accomplished partly through Henley's $200
million cash purchase of Abex Friction Products group, which
makes brake parts for auto and truckmakers. That sum,
together with bank borrowings, will be used to repurchase
Pneumo's $235 million in reset notes, which are expected to
rise to 15% interest this summer from their current 12.75%
rate.</p>
<p>Pneumo will have assets of over $1 billion, and an
investment portfolio Mr. Dingman valued at $170 million.</p>
