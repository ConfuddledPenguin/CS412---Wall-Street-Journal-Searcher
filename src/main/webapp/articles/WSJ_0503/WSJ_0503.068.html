	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee approved a
wide-ranging bill that would open up access for handicapped
people to employment and public accommodations.
   The panel voted 32-3 for the bill, clearing the way for a
vote by the full House, possibly this month. Three other
House committees -- Labor and Education, Public Works and
Transportation, and Interstate and Foreign Commerce -- all
have given their green lights to various provisions of the
legislation. The Senate approved a similar bill late last
year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, a significant stumbling block has been created,
related to the issue of whether to allow an expansion of the
legal remedies available to disabled people who are
discriminated against as job seekers or holders. Groups
representing the disabled want those remedies to include
compensatory and punitive damages and the right to jury
trials, the same remedies that are among those provided by a
major civil-rights bill pending in Congress.</p>
<p>The civil-rights bill would overturn several recent
Supreme Court decisions, which tended to rein in some legal
gains made over the years by plaintiffs in sex- and
race-discrimination cases.</p>
<p>But the Bush administration, congressional Republicans and
business groups want the disability bill limited to the same
legal remedies provided by existing civil-rights law. These
remedies were part of a compromise on the disability bill
reached by all parties last year, when the Senate was
considering the measure. They would include collecting back
pay for hiring or job discrimination and court injunctions to
require hiring, promotion or job reinstatement.</p>
<p>During the House Judiciary Committee's consideration of
the bill yesterday, an amendment offered by Rep. James
Sensenbrenner (R., Wis.) to limit the employment remedies to
the current civil-rights act was defeated on a voice vote.</p>
<p>Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a March letter to
Rep. Steny Hoyer (D., Md.) and others in the House that the
administration would support such a "clarifying amendment,"
and continue its vigorous backing for the disability bill
with that change. But Mr. Thornburgh expressed administration
opposition to an expansion of the employment remedies,
calling the remedies provision in the compromise Senate bill
"a very critical element."</p>
<p>In return for that compromise, he said the administration
had agreed to "broad coverage" under the disability bill's
public-accommodations provisions, by including such
establishments as grocery stores, retail stores, doctors' and
lawyers' offices and drugstores, all "necessary for people
with disabilities to be truly in the mainstream."</p>
<p>Such coverage is broader than Title II of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, the attorney general said, which essentially
prohibits race discrimination in hotels, motels, restaurants,
gasoline stations and places of public entertainment.</p>
<p>Disability groups say the expanded remedies are vital to
give the handicapped "parallel" rights to those that the
civil-rights bill would provide for other groups. But G. John
Tysse, vice president and general counsel of the Labor Policy
Association, a group of personnel executives for large
corporations, said the legal remedies in the measure, if tied
to the civil-rights bill, would mean a "litigation
nightmare."</p>
<p>"All the negotiation we did last summer is out the window.
Until this is fixed, we've got major problems with the bill,"
Mr. Tysse said.</p>
<p>A Justice Department spokeswoman said that the department
is "disappointed" with the defeat of the Sensenbrenner
amendment, but that the administration still supports the
thrust of the bill -- addressing the "special needs and
rights of the disabled."</p>
<p>President Bush, in fact, told a meeting of the President's
Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities here
yesterday that disabled people have waited long enough for
equality, and urged the House to pass the disability bill.
His remarks were made before the Judiciary Committee's action
on the measure.</p>
<p>Besides banning discrimination against disabled people in
employment and in access to public buildings, the legislation
would prohibit discrimination against the handicapped in
transportation access. This would include making Amtrak and
commuter-rail service accessible, along with new mass-transit
and intercity buses and subway trains, rebuilt mass-transit
vehicles, and new transit stations and facilities. Special
door-to-door buses or vans and other such services must be
made available to many handicapped people.</p>
<p>Telecommunications services would also have to be
provided, allowing deaf people to send or receive messages
using computer keyboards and screens. Those communications
would be linked to voice-relay services, provided by
telephone operators.</p>
