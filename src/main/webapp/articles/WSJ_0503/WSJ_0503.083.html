	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Brent Musburger, whose contract wasn't renewed
last month by CBS Sports, was hired by ABC Sports, a division
of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
   Mr. Musburger signed a multiyear agreement to be a
commentator on the network's coverage of college football,
college basketball and the World Football League. However,
the 15-year veteran of the CBS Inc. unit will not be included
on ABC Sports's showcase "Monday Night Football," which
enters its 21st season in September.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Musburger's first assignment will be to host a
prime-time special "AllStar Pro Sports Awards" on June 25.</p>
<p>Mr. Musburger, who was paid an estimated $2 million
annually by CBS Sports to anchor "The NFL Today" among other
broadcasts, was informed by the network the day of his final
CBS broadcast of the National Collegiate Athletic Association
basketball championship last month.</p>
<p>A CBS official said Mr. Musburger and the network couldn't
come to terms on a new agreement. Mr. Musburger blasted CBS
Sports executives by saying he was let go for no reason other
than a clash of personalities.</p>
