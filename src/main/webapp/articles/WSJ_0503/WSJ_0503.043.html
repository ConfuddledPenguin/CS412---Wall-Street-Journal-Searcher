	<p class="article-leader">GENEVA, Switzerland -- OPEC postponed the start of its
emergency meeting here after informal talks revealed
disagreement about how to achieve temporary cuts in oil
production.
   The debate appeared to be over determining which members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries should
carry the burden of reduced production this month and next,
and the base from which cuts should be figured.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The delay so far isn't viewed as a serious threat to the
generally accepted goal of the session, which is to prop up
sagging world oil prices with a short-term production
cutback.</p>
<p>Informal talks among the oil ministers continued late into
the night, and several remained optimistic. "It's just a
normal course of developments," Diego Tamariz, Ecuador's oil
minister, said in an interview.</p>
<p>The formal session of OPEC's monitoring committee -- but
with all 13 nations represented -- had been scheduled to
begin yesterday afternoon, after the late arrival of Iran's
oil minister. But as the day wore on, it was postponed
several times. It has been rescheduled for today.</p>
<p>Several delegates said they still expect to keep the
meeting brief. All want a fast agreement -- in two days at
the most -- because they hope that will provide a "quick fix"
to oil markets that have deteriorated because of OPEC's
overproduction.</p>
<p>The ministers remain convinced that only a major
short-term cut in production -- one million to two million
barrels a day -- can support oil prices, which have fallen
25% so far this year.</p>
<p>However, by embracing that strategy, the ministers have
put themselves in an unfamiliar position: Instead of
squabbling over how to allocate a rise in production, as
often occurs at their meetings, they are arguing about how to
allocate a cut.</p>
<p>So far, according to individuals close to yesterday's
informal deliberations, the debate over apportioning a cut
turns on two main suggestions: that all member-nations reduce
output by 5% to 10%; or that the Persian Gulf countries of
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, all
currently producing over their quotas, bear the brunt of the
reduction. If every country stuck to its quota, OPEC's total
production would drop from the current 23.5 million barrels a
day to 22 million, the group's official production ceiling
for the first half of this year.</p>
<p>But Kuwait and the Emirates, chronic overproducers, are
unlikely to go for strict adherence to quotas. By stubbornly
ignoring its past production allotments, Kuwait has been able
to force an increase in its official quota to a current 1.5
million barrels a day, and its recent output has ranged up to
two million a day. The Emirates also have won special
treatment in the past and are now producing two million
barrels a day -- nearly double the formal quota.</p>
<p>Oil ministers previously decided they could safely ignore
a certain amount of such "cheating," and factored some into
their first-half ceiling. The reasoning was that because some
other countries couldn't produce all they were officially
permitted, net production would still only be around 22.6
million barrels a day. In view of rising demand for OPEC oil,
they figured, prices would remain firm.</p>
<p>Now, some of the ministers said, OPEC needs to get back to
its projected level. Output of 22 million barrels a day "will
be very right," said Fawzi A. Shakshuki, Libya's oil
minister. Others suggested cuts to a level even below the
ceiling. Asked if he still wants a reduction of two million
barrels a day, Issam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, Iraq's oil
minister, replied: "We are definitely looking for a cut."</p>
<p>Most outside experts here to track the meeting, including
oil executives who are in Geneva to talk with some of the
producers, seemed confident that the ministers will strike a
bargain, simply because they must if they want to head off
further price erosion. "If they walk out of here without an
agreement, it's $2 to $4 down" a barrel for oil prices,
predicted Oscar Wyatt, chairman of Coastal Corp. The market
can't absorb continued high output right now, he explained.
"Everybody's storage is full."</p>
