	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Are you weary of the art scene? Have the
staggering prices, the unrelenting hype, the mobbed
blockbusters made you want to call it a day and take a
vacation from art? Cheer up: There are two refreshingly quiet
exhibitions in New York that offer oases from all that.
   Uptown at the Metropolitan Museum you will find "Master
Drawings From the Ian Woodner Family Collection," a rich
sampling from what probably is the most distinguished private
collection of drawings in the U.S. And in midtown, at the
Pierpont Morgan Library, you will find "The Golden Age of
Dutch Manuscript Painting," an exhibition of illuminated
manuscripts from the late 14th through early 16th centuries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While both exhibitions are connoisseurs' delights -- full
of rarities and scholarly puzzles -- they also contain
several surpassingly beautiful works of art accessible to us
all. What's more, both shows are installed in an elegant,
even an understated way, and they seem to have been spared
the huge crowds that make it impossible to savor many popular
museum exhibitions these days.</p>
<p>Ian Woodner, a real estate developer, architect and
amateur painter, began collecting drawings in the 1950s. The
150 drawings on view at the Met represent about one-sixth of
his collection. Mr. Woodner selected the works for this
exhibition himself. He also commissioned the handsome
scholarly catalog that accompanies it and that provides a
useful thumbnail history of collecting drawings in the U.S.
from colonial times to the present.</p>
<p>The Woodner drawings span more than six centuries, from
the 14th-century Florentine studies of St. Francis kneeling
to several drawings by such 20th-century masters as Braque,
Matisse and Picasso. Arranged chronologically within school
(Italian, French, German and so on), the exhibition includes
stunning examples of the draftsman's art in metal point,
chalk, pen and ink, charcoal, watercolor and other media.
There are works by Correggio, Botticelli, Cellini, Durer,
Goya, Hans Holbein (father and son), as well as Ingres,
Claude Lorrain, Raphael, Rembrandt, Seurat and Watteau.
Altogether there are drawings by some 50 artists.</p>
<p>Until fairly recently, drawings were mostly made and
appreciated as preliminary studies, acts of imitation, or as
efforts to solve particular pictorial problems, not as
independent works of art. Thus while several of the items on
view here are highly finished -- Durer's and his contemporary
Hans Hoffmann's painstaking studies of animals, for example,
or Ingres's portrait of Mademoiselle de Borderieux -- many
are to varying degrees rough-hewn, sketchy and seem
spontaneously personal. The very unfinished quality of many
drawings gives them an air of intimacy and immediateness that
the more polished works they presage often lack.</p>
<p>Mr. Woodner surely is correct in thinking that the drawing
of a satyr by Cellini (a pen-and-ink study for a relief
sculpture that was never executed) and the page from the
Renaissance biographer and painter Giorgio Vasari's book of
drawings are among the highlights of the show. The large page
from Vasari's book -- which he assembled to accompany his
famous "Lives of the Artists" -- contains 10 separate
drawings on its two sides, nine by Filippino Lippi and one by
Botticelli.</p>
<p>Vasari added decorations to frame the drawings and help
harmonize the images on the page. Pages from Vasari's book
naturally have a special attraction for collectors of
drawings since Vasari was himself the first great collector
of drawings. Unfortunately, very few pages have survived. Mr.
Woodner acquired this one from the Duke of Devonshire in
1984, outbidding the Getty Museum for it.</p>
<p>There are many other marvelous things in the show: an
exceptionally beautiful head of John the Baptist by the
15th-century Florentine artist Andrea del Sarto, "Christ on
the Road to Emmaus" by Claude Lorrain, a revealing
self-portrait by Degas, an extraordinary late watercolor by
Cezanne.</p>
<p>The exhibition wavers most as it enters the 20th century.
In particular, Mr. Woodner's passion for Odilon Redon --
there are five drawings by the French surrealist included --
will strike many viewers as excessive, but then Mr. Woodner's
affection for Redon's drawings knows no bounds: He is perhaps
the world's leading collector.</p>
<p>The Woodner drawings span continents and several
centuries. The exhibition of Dutch illuminated manuscripts at
the Morgan Library is a much more narrowly focused event,
dealing with a single highly specialized art form whose Dutch
incarnation flourished in the 15th century in Utrecht, Delft
and a few other cities in the northern Netherlands.</p>
<p>Co-organized by the Morgan Library and the Rijksmuseum Het
Catharijneconvent in Utrecht, the exhibition draws on more
than 50 collections and contains some 100 items. Among the
many jewels on view are pages from a Book of Hours done
around 1440 by artists known as the Masters of the Delft
Grisailles. Produced rapidly and in comparatively large
numbers, the grisailles illustrations are simpler and less
luxurious than the best known illuminations of the time. But
their very leanness and sparsely applied gold leaf and color
imbue them with a haunting nimbus of distilled spirituality.</p>
<p>The centerpiece of the exhibition is the Morgan's own Book
of Hours for Catherine of Cleves, which also was produced in
the 1440s and that generally is regarded as the summit of
Dutch illuminated manuscript artistry. Of the 168
illustrations originally in the book, 157 survive. Painted
with exquisite grace and delicacy, many of the Cleves
illustrations feature an abundance of homey details that give
us a glimpse into the daily life of the times. And the
phantasmagoric picture called "The Mouth of Hell" achieves a
level of surreal fantasy that, as James H. Marrow notes in
his excellent introduction to the catalog, looks forward to
the febrile productions of Hieronymus Bosch.</p>
<p>As with all the illuminated manuscripts in the exhibition,
the artist of the Cleves Hours is anonymous. What has come
down to us about these artists are a few details about their
commissions, some idea of when and where they were active,
and the extraordinary names by which they are known to
posterity: Master of the Feathery Clouds, Master of the
Playing Cards, Masters of the Suffrages, Masters of the Dark
Eyes.</p>
<p>There is something peaceful and serene about an exhibition
of illuminated manuscripts, though the subjects depicted
often are anything but placid. There are scenes of hell and
crucifixion and martyrdom aplenty. Moreover, the actual
history of some of these manuscripts is full of intrigue and
perhaps even murder.</p>
<p>It is said, for example, that a miniature illuminated
prayer book was the death of John of Bavaria. After the death
of William VI in 1417, John had beat out his cousin
Jacqueline to become Count of Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut.
When, in 1424, he died from the effects of poison, Jacqueline
was suspected to have played a part in his demise. In a twist
that might have come from "The Name of the Rose," John was
poisoned not by food or drink but -- according to one
contemporary -- by "venom" smeared "onto my Lord's book,
which was about as large as a nut." It is not clear whether
the book in question is on view at the Morgan. The exhibition
of drawings from the Woodner collection is on view through
May 13. "The Golden Age of Dutch Manuscript Painting" closes
May 6.</p>
