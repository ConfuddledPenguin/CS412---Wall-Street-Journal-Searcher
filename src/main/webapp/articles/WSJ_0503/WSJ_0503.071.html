	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- At about 9 o'clock Saturday night, Virginia
Gov. Douglas Wilder will step to the podium at Atlanta's
Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel and deliver a polite lecture to
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and his National Rainbow Coalition.
   Mr. Wilder, the nation's first black elected governor, has
been criss-crossing the country, preaching a message of
Democratic party unity and mainstream values that sometimes
seems to be targeted directly at the prickly, thin-skinned
Mr. Jackson, a two-time presidential candidate who may decide
to run again in 1992.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gov. Wilder will deliver his message personally Saturday
night in the lion's den -- to Mr. Jackson himself and to
about 1,000 of the people who worked for him, campaigned for
him and attended national conventions as his delegates and
alternates.</p>
<p>"People call it 'The War of the Roses,'" says Joseph
Johnson, executive director of Mr. Jackson's Rainbow
Coalition, referring to a movie in which an angry couple
destroys almost everything they own. "But that's not fair."</p>
<p>Fair or not, the contest between these two black leaders
is more and more perceived as a battle between Mr. Inside and
Mr. Outside. Mr. Inside, Gov. Wilder, spent 16 years in the
Virginia state senate and served four years as lieutenant
governor before being elected governor last year. Mr.
Outside, the charismatic Mr. Jackson, has never been elected
to any public office and disappointed some of his friends by
declining to run for mayor of Washington this year.</p>
<p>National Democrats who quake at the prospect of another
Jackson presidential campaign see Mr. Wilder as a checkmate
to Mr. Jackson's ambitions and possibly even as a running
mate to the party's 1992 nominee.</p>
<p>Gov. Wilder has surprised some of his friends by the
eagerness with which he has stepped forward to challenge both
Mr. Jackson's position as his party's premier black
politician and his views on how the party should proceed to
become competitive once again in presidential elections.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilder calls, first of all, for the kind of party
unity in which politicians who lose agree to support the
people who win, without cavil. In both 1984 and 1988, Mr.
Jackson demanded concessions and special treatment from the
winners of the party's presidential nomination, Walter
Mondale first, then Michael Dukakis.</p>
<p>"If those who fail to win in our primaries don't reject
their sense of injury and unite behind our candidates -- come
election day it will be Democratic nominees who are
rejected," says Gov. Wilder, in a remark that could hardly be
more pointed (though he insists he isn't singling out Mr.
Jackson).</p>
<p>Mr. Wilder's chief political adviser, Virginia party
chairman Paul Goldman, sponsored a resolution at the most
recent meeting of the Democratic National Committee's
executive commitee calling for an end to "internecine
political warfare" within the party and urging "all
Democrats, especially those with prior experience in the
presidential primary process," to take steps to remedy the
problem. It, too, could hardly be more pointed. The
resolution was passed unanimously.</p>
<p>But perhaps even more importantly, Mr. Wilder is
challenging Mr. Jackson on the basic direction the Democratic
Party should take to once again become competitive in
presidential elections.</p>
<p>As Mr. Wilder sees it, the nation is "being asked to
choose between two great forces -- the forces that are locked
in the past and the forces that look to the future." Needless
to say, he comes down on the side of the future. "This force
of the future," he says, "is what I call America's New
Mainstream, that uniquely American combination of solid
family values and individual initiative that knows our best
years are ahead of us."</p>
<p>He boasts that he balanced his state's budget by cutting
$1 billion in spending. Democrats, he says, face "a choice
between individuals who intend to lead a government which
promotes fiscal responsibility and an ability to compete in a
global economy {and} government that runs up huge deficits
and ignores fundamental changes in economic reality."</p>
<p>Throwing money at social problems isn't "a panacea" for
everything, Gov. Wilder says. More important is "the power of
economic development. For we know that it's among the
greatest of all social equalizers."</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson -- neither he nor Mr. Wilder would be
interviewed about their relationship -- dismisses the
governor's talk about a new mainstream. In a recent speech in
New Orleans, Mr. Jackson said: "For those who are not in the
mainstream, does that mean backwater? Does that mean
cesspool? We want justice to roll down like a mighty stream,
not like a narrow mainstream."</p>
<p>While Mr. Wilder addresses ordinary voters struggling with
paying their bills and worrying about crime and drugs, Mr.
Jackson continues to concentrate on the victims of society,
the jobless, the workers on picket lines, even, frequently,
the fate of oppressed people in Third World nations. He
spends much of his time recalling the triumphs of his
mentors, including the Rev. Martin Luther King, and reciting
his own primary successes in his two presidential campaigns.</p>
<p>"The governor doesn't wallow in the past," asserts Mr.
Goldman, his political adviser. "Others" -- he refuses to
single out Mr. Jackson -- "tell you what's wrong. But you've
got to tell people what they've accomplished just to keep
them going."</p>
<p>Mr. Goldman believes Gov. Wilder can deliver that message
credibly because he has come such a long way himself, working
his way up the political ladder. "The Rev. Jackson has taken
another approach," says Mr. Goldman. "I just think people
have been more successful working their way up than
parachuting from the top of Mt. Everest. The Rev. Jackson
thinks he should start at the top."</p>
<p>Mr. Wilder's approach has won him some unlikely allies --
including the conservative Democratic Leadership Council,
among whose founders was Mr. Wilder's old nemesis, Virginia
Sen. Charles Robb. "His message, basically, is our message,"
says Al From, the DLC's executive director. "He has done what
all successful Democratic politicians have done in recent
years. He has combined a progressive social approach with
fiscal responsibility and toughness on crime. He's the
paradigm of the new Democratic politician. He drives Jackson
up the wall."</p>
<p>But the battle for the Democratic mind and soul is far
from over. It isn't just Mr. Jackson who objects to Mr.
Wilder's mainstream convictions. It's many liberal white
activists in the party, too. "The part they disagree with
most," says one leading Democrat, "is fiscal conservatism.
Many liberal Democrats believe now is the time to take some
resources and apply them to problems." Many of these
Democrats were in the audience when Mr. Wilder addressed the
California state Democratic convention last month. It was the
one occasion, so far, when he drew mixed reviews.</p>
