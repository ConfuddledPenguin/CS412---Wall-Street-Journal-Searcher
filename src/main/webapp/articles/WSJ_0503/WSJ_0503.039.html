	<p class="article-leader">For years, Bank of Credit and Commerce International
chased the fast buck. If deposits from drug dealers were
proffered, the bank only asked: How much? If it was money
from Manuel Noriega, BCCI opened its doors.
   To keep a respectable face, the bank hired Washington
insiders, such as Clark Clifford, the former defense
secretary, and cozied up to former president Jimmy Carter and
other political figures. Amid all this, it grew --
astoundingly. From seemingly nowhere, BCCI rocketed to $21
billion in assets spread over an empire of 400 branches in 73
countries, making it one of the world's 20 biggest privately
held banks. It kept its headquarters in Luxembourg, kept its
main offices in London, kept its ownership obscured by Cayman
Islands trusts -- and kept its regulators always off balance.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the fast life is catching up to BCCI. Earlier this
year, in a much publicized case, BCCI pleaded guilty to
running the biggest single-bank drug-money laundering
operation in U.S. history. Now, this week, BCCI announced
another shock: It had a loss of $498 million in 1989, largely
because of a charge for bad loans. It also said the
government of Abu Dhabi had injected $400 million into the
bank to help it meet international loan standards, increasing
Abu Dhabi's stake in BCCI to 77%. People familiar with the
bank's operations say BCCI is also planning sweeping
organizational changes.</p>
<p>The convulsions at BCCI are the latest chapter in a
shadowy history that ultimately created the world's biggest
rogue bank. "This bank is offshore at all points," grumbles
one U.S. state investigator, who, along with House, Senate,
Justice and Treasury Department officials is trying to piece
together BCCI's U.S. connections.</p>
<p>Of greatest interest is how BCCI surfed on the edge of one
of the big financial waves of the 1980s: The hot money
generated by the cocaine industry. According to Michael L.
Rubinstein, a federal prosecutor in the money-laundering
case, BCCI has been guided by a policy that "came down from
the highest levels of the bank: to take in as many deposits
as you can, as fast as you can, and not to be too careful
about where they came from." BCCI's representatives declined
to be interviewed for this article. But, in the wake of its
guilty plea in January, BCCI said the bank had been "misused
by unscrupulous elements" and that it was retraining its
employees.</p>
<p>The bank got out of the laundering case with a $15 million
fine -- a small rap on the knuckles, given BCCI's size.
What's more, three of the bank's six branches in the U.S.,
located in California and New York, were allowed to continue
operating.</p>
<p>Clark Clifford and his protege Robert Altman are the
primary figures behind the legal clout the bank wields in the
U.S. The two men even picked the attorneys who are now
representing nine former BCCI officials charged in the
money-laundering case in which the bank pleaded guilty.
Messrs. Clifford and Altman, however, have an interest in
BCCI that goes beyond legal representation: The two are also
the Washington managers for the people who own First American
Bankshares Inc., an $11.5 billion bank holding company in
which BCCI's principals have an overlapping ownership.</p>
<p>BCCI's twisting trail has even turned up amid the wreckage
of the U.S. thrift industry. Treasury and Justice Department
investigators probing the ruins of scandal-plagued CenTrust
Bank of Miami suspect that BCCI secretly "parked" $25 million
in CenTrust in 1988 to help keep the sick thrift
institution's books looking healthy. CenTrust went into
receivership in March, and is expected eventually to cost
U.S. taxpayers about $2 billion. But before CenTrust failed,
BCCI got all of its money back -- at a time when the
institution was paying other creditors 67 cents on the
dollar. BCCI insists its investment in CenTrust -- in the
form of a debt purchase -- was legal and wasn't part of any
"parking" scheme, under which the size of CenTrust's debt
could be concealed. Nonetheless, the deal is being
investigated by the Justice Department. A lawyer for David
Paul, the former head of CenTrust, says his client denies any
wrongdoing.</p>
<p>The story of BCCI's staggering growth, knack for survival
and keen nose for cash begins decades ago in Allahabad,
India. In 1947, when India won its independence, Agha Hasan
Abedi was one of thousands of Shiite Muslims trekking from
India to the new nation of Pakistan. After he arrived, Mr.
Abedi, a cultured man, started the United Bank of Pakistan
along with several other immigrants, including Swaleh Naqvi,
who became his deputy.</p>
<p>In 1973 the Pakistani government nationalized United, but
Mr. Abedi was prepared. He had ingratiated himself with the
rulers of the United Arab Emirates, where oil had just been
discovered. Mr. Abedi had spent years courting the U.A.E.'s
princelings studying in Pakistan. He was there to take them
and their falcons out in air-conditioned jeeps to hunt for
the slowflying bustard. And he proffered financial advice to
their fathers, some of whom kept stacks of cash in their
basements.</p>
<p>U.S. banks, including Bank of America, the
California-based giant, also sensed opportunity in the
region. But they found they couldn't gain entree to the
United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait without going
through the well-connected Mr. Abedi. So in 1972 Bank of
America stole a march on its rivals and put up $2.5 million
for a 25% stake in a new bank to be called Bank of Credit and
Commerce International. It would be run by Mr. Abedi.</p>
<p>Bank of America now declines to comment on its role in
creating BCCI. But former Bank of America executives say its
considerable prestige was crucial to BCCI's early growth.
"During the early years he (Mr. Abedi) benefited a great deal
from his association with Bank of America," says Alvin C.
Rice, who oversaw the American bank's investment in BCCI.</p>
<p>From the start, according to testimony by Yves LaMarche,
Bank of America's former director of Middle East operations,
Mr. Abedi wanted BCCI "to become the biggest bank in the
world." Mr. Abedi combined that ambition with a mystical
management style. At an in-house gathering, he encouraged
employees to pursue "the all-encompassing cosmic wisdom"
through "humility, love and total submission to God."</p>
<p>The deposit-hungry bank targeted what it termed "HNWs" --
people with "high net worths." Spreading from its base in the
Persian Gulf, it opened 45 branches in England. Some of those
served Pakistani and Indian immigrants. But the big money in
London came from BCCI's "Middle Eastern Mobilisation Unit,"
which catered to the whims of visiting oil sheiks.</p>
<p>Bank of America soon began to feel uneasy about its
high-flying partner. Oil prices quadrupled in the years after
BCCI's founding, but BCCI's asset growth far outstripped that
pace. That bothered Bank of America officials who couldn't
find records explaining where the growth was coming from.
Poorly documented loans also scared them: "If you were lucky,
you'd see a memo that said something like, `Obviously the
sheik is good for a million dollars,'" recalls Mr. Rice. Mr.
Rice, who would rise to vice chairman of Bank of America
before leaving in 1978, says Mr. Abedi repeatedly promised
better controls, but failed to implement them. Mr. Abedi, who
recently received a heart transplant, is an invalid and
wasn't available for comment for this article.</p>
<p>Eventually, says Mr. Rice, Bank of America quietly began
to back away from BCCI, beginning with a request in 1976 that
the bank remove Bank of America's logo from its letterhead.</p>
<p>At that point Mr. Abedi began making another U.S.
connection. Like much of BCCI's activities, some of the facts
are disputed, and much of the story is murky. But this
portion of the BCCI saga appears to have begun with R. Eugene
Holley, the former Georgia state senator who is remembered as
the first person ever charged under the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act. He agreed not to contest the charges, which
stemmed from bribes he allegedly made to an official in
Qatar. Mr. Holley, who declined to be interviewed, knew Mr.
Abedi from a deal he had made to refinance an oil-drilling
concession in Qatar.</p>
<p>Bert Lance, who resigned from the Carter Administration in
1977, says that Mr. Holley brought Mr. Abedi to the U.S.,
where Mr. Abedi was interested in establishing a banking
"presence." Mr. Lance sold his own institution, National Bank
of Georgia, to Ghaith Pharaon, a sometime shareholder in BCCI
and a longtime business ally of Mr. Abedi, in a deal arranged
by Mr. Abedi and financed with a bridge loan from BCCI.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Lance acted as BCCI's agent in the takeover
of the Washington-based bank holding company then known as
Financial General Bankshares. On Feb. 17, 1978, according to
court records in Washington, he informed Financial General
that BCCI held 20% of its stock, and wanted more.</p>
<p>In separate actions, Financial General and the Securities
and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Abedi, BCCI, several Arab
investors and Mr. Lance for failing to make the required
disclosure that they were acting in concert. Mr. Lance then
introduced the BCCI men to Messrs. Clifford and Altman. The
ensuing 3 1/2-year court battle eventually boiled down to the
relationship between BCCI and four Middle Easterners who each
had purchased just under 5% of Financial General's stock, the
threshold beyond which ownership must be disclosed. In
depositions, they revealed an array of ties to BCCI as both
borrowers and shareholders. Indeed, one turned out to be the
chairman of Kuwait International Finance Co., BCCI's branch
in Kuwait.</p>
<p>But in 1981 Mr. Clifford managed to convince the Federal
Reserve Board, which had to approve the bank acquisition,
that those ties were unimportant. "I think it is a group of
individuals operating as individuals," he said at the time.
One of the Arab investors, he said, told BCCI about the deal,
and it brought in three other unrelated bank clients.</p>
<p>The SEC suit ended in a consent agreement under which the
defendants neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, and agreed
to obey securities laws in the future. Financial General's
suit was eventually dropped.</p>
<p>With the conflict resolved, Mr. Clifford's relationship
with the bankers grew: He became chairman of Financial
General, now named First American Bankshares Inc., and Mr.
Altman became its president.</p>
<p>Officially, First American is controlled by a company in
the Netherlands Antilles called Credit and Commerce American
Holdings N.V. Mr. Clifford declines to say to what extent
BCCI shareholders own shares in his bank, saying that "Most
people of means like to keep their business private." But a
review of regulatory filings and several interviews in the
U.S., France, England, and the Middle East indicate that the
degree of overlap is considerable, and that the ruling
families of Abu Dhabi and Dubai -- two of the United Arab
Emirates -- have a dominating presence in both banks. Also,
former Saudi intelligence chief Kamal Adham is a key
shareholder in both.</p>
<p>Moreover, in 1986 the owners of Mr. Clifford's bank
decided to expand by buying Mr. Lance's old bank in Georgia
from Mr. Pharaon, the old BCCI ally. Four former employees or
associates of BCCI already were working there. The
acquisition, made for $220 million in cash, gave First
American a network that now extends from Florida to upstate
New York.</p>
<p>The early '80s were busy years for BCCI. Mr. Abedi
cultivated important political figures around the globe. In
the U.S. he concentrated on Jimmy Carter. He donated $500,000
to the former president's library in Atlanta and later gave
$2.5 million to Global 2000, a program launched by Mr. Carter
to help eradicate disease and promote better farming in the
Third World. Mr. Carter has used BCCI's Boeing 727 jet on at
least four international trips over the last five years. His
joint appearances with Mr. Abedi in such places as China,
Thailand and the Soviet Union have been regularly featured in
BCCI's in-house magazine. Through a spokesman, Mr. Carter
declines to comment.</p>
<p>In London, meanwhile, BCCI lost $150 million speculating
in U.S. government bond options. Shaken by the experience, it
launched a bankwide drive to gather new deposits.</p>
<p>In its push, it aggressively pursued one of the
fastest-growing sources of dollars in the 1980s: drug
profits. It purchased a Colombian bank with 30 branches,
including five in Medellin, home of the largest, most
notorious cocaine cartel.</p>
<p>It also ran into a U.S. Customs Service sting operation.
Amjad Awan, an officer with BCCI's Latin America division
based in Miami, became the main target of the sting, which
took some $32 million from various operatives of the Medellin
cartel and ran almost half of it through BCCI.</p>
<p>Robert Mazur, an undercover Customs agent who deposited
the cartel's funds, says various BCCI officers warned him he
was doing it all wrong, and would likely be nabbed by
American authorities. In testimony in federal court in Tampa,
he said Syed Aftab Hussain, a BCCI officer in Panama, advised
him not to use checks, but instead to employ an untraceable
"counterbalancing loan scheme." Mr. Mazur has testified, for
example, that, under the scheme, $476,595 he placed with an
unidentified BCCI office was wired through a correspondent
account in First American Bank in Washington to the BCCI
branch in Geneva, Switzerland. Then he received what appeared
to be an unrelated loan for the same amount, minus a small
fee, from BCCI's Panama branch.</p>
<p>Mr. Mazur testified that he told the BCCI banker that his
cash was cocaine money. Mr. Mazur added that Mr. Hussain
replied, "Well, in that case, perhaps you would want to put
the funds in Luxembourg" to hide them better. Wearing his
hidden tape recorder, Mr. Mazur also talked about cocaine
profits with BCCI officers in London, Geneva, Paris and Los
Angeles.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Mr. Hussain and other BCCI officials
currently being tried in Tampa for money laundering say they
were merely following BCCI's aggressive policies to bring in
deposits, and weren't involved in money laundering.</p>
<p>The bank tells a different story. When it pleaded guilty
to money laundering in January, it admitted to knowingly
dealing with two major U.S. drug dealers. One, Stephen
Kalish, later confessed he was grossing $60 million a year,
and that when he was caught he was making financial
arrangements through BCCI to import one million pounds of
marijuana.</p>
<p>By October 1988, Mr. Mazur was such a treasured client of
BCCI that a dozen bank officers he had dealt with, including
Mr. Awan and several from Europe, flew to Tampa to attend
what was billed as his wedding. The limousines that met them
at the airport, however, whisked them not to a bachelor party
but to the federal courthouse, where most of them were
booked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Senate Foreign Affairs subcommittee had begun
poking around Manuel Noriega's finances, and in the course of
that ran into BCCI. Among other things, it subpoenaed Mr.
Awan to talk with him about Mr. Noriega's client relationship
with the bank. (Mr. Rubinstein, a prosecutor in the Tampa
case, has asserted in federal court that in August 1988,
Messrs. Clifford and Altman advised Mr. Awan to dodge the
Senate subpoena by having BCCI transfer him out of the
country. Both lawyers deny giving such advice, and Mr. Awan
stayed in the U.S.)</p>
<p>Mr. Clifford, in his capacity as BCCI's lawyer, told Sen.
John Kerry, chairman of the subcommittee, that he wasn't
aware of any BCCI documents concerning Mr. Noriega that were
in the U.S. subject to the subpoena. BCCI documents later
seized by British customs show that at least $600,000 of Mr.
Noriega's money flowed from Panama first to BCCI accounts in
a Washington branch of First American, Mr. Clifford's bank,
and then to Europe. In a letter sent last week to Mr.
Clifford, Sen. Kerry contended that at least the documents
regarding those accounts "should have been produced" by Mr.
Clifford under the earlier subpoena.</p>
<p>Mr. Altman says that a check of First American customer
accounts shows no indication of Mr. Noriega's money.
Identifying documents, he says, might have been in a BCCI
internal file, "but not anything that First American had."</p>
<p>Sen. Kerry isn't convinced. "I think there's a regulatory
failure here," he says, referring to the links between BCCI
and First American. He says he will ask the Senate Banking
Committee, which he recently joined, to look into the matter.</p>
<p>Since he is still recuperating from his heart transplant,
Mr. Abedi has handed over operation of BCCI to Mr. Naqvi, his
longtime deputy, who, spokesmen say, has instituted the major
retraining program for bank employees. In a recent open
letter to them he vowed that "never again shall we allow our
bank's good name to be smeared and tarnished by carelessness
or negligence or lack of vigilance."</p>
<p>Left holding the bag for BCCI's U.S. misadventures are its
former employees now on trial in Tampa. As part of its plea
agreement, BCCI fired them. BCCI, however, continues to pay
for their legal representation.</p>
