	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration approved a
hepatitis C test kit developed by Ortho Diagnostics Systems
Inc., a unit of Johnson & Johnson.
   The kit, which is used to detect hepatitis C in blood for
transfusions, includes a biotechnologically derived
recombinant antigen developed by Chiron Corp. of Ermeyville,
Calif. Chiron, whose stock is traded over the counter, has
licensed the product to Ortho.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The antigen detects the presence of the antibody to
hepatitis C, which is "responsible for the majority of
post-transfusion hepatitis cases," according to an FDA
spokeswoman. There are 170,000 new infections of hepatitis C
each year.</p>
<p>The FDA is recommending the new screening test to all
blood banks. A spokesman for Ortho said the company will
begin shipping the test kits immediately.</p>
