	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Crude markets were thrashed by what traders saw
as a lack of progress at the oil ministers' meeting in
Geneva, with prices ending lower in nerve-racking trading.
   Prices had been stronger most of the day, on optimism that
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would agree
on production cuts. A number of statements from OPEC
ministers and their representatives bolstered that sentiment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But in midafternoon, the Dow Jones International Petroleum
Report moved a headline stating that yesterday's official
session of OPEC's policy-setting committee would be
postponed. The headline, viewed on a big screen on the floor
of the New York Mercantile Exchange and flashed across
numerous computer screens at trading houses, quickly took the
steam out of the market.</p>
<p>Traders interpreted it to mean that the oil ministers were
still far apart and couldn't reach a consensus on output cuts
in their informal discussions.</p>
<p>"There were rumors out that OPEC was going to do some kind
of a production cut," said Eric Bolling of Edge Trading Corp.
"Then it hit the wires that the meeting was going to be
suspended for the rest of the day, and the market sold off
fast."</p>
<p>On the Merc, West Texas Intermediate for June delivery
ended at $18.68 a barrel, down 13 cents. Earlier it had
crossed $19 a barrel -- a bullish barrier -- and climbed as
high as $19.10. Many speculators were betting on further
price rises, but when news of the postponed meeting became
widespread, they quickly unloaded those "long" positions.</p>
<p>Petroleum-product prices moved in lockstep with crude,
though they didn't come off as much. Gasoline for June
delivery wound up at 60.95 cents a gallon, down 0.08 cents.
June heating oil fell 1.11 cents, to 51.86 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>The OPEC meeting is critical to oil markets, because the
cartel's production has been running as much as two million
barrels a day above its production ceiling, helping to create
a world-wide glut of crude. The challenge is for the group to
determine how much to cut and how to apportion the reductions
among the 13 members.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn futures prices are likely to
continue to climb this morning, following a flurry of buy
orders executed shortly before the close of trading yesterday
on the Chicago Board of Trade. Corn futures for July delivery
gained 4.25 cents to close at $2.89 a bushel. That late rally
was spurred by rumors that the Soviet Union will be back in
the market soon for U.S. corn, said Steven Freed, a futures
analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. Certain
Asian countries may also be buying corn soon, according to
other Board of Trade rumors. Analysts said that one sign the
Soviets may be about to buy corn was a round of futures
buying by Refco Group Ltd. late yesterday. The Soviets are
rumored to have used Refco in the past to buy futures
contracts a week or so ahead of major grain purchases, as a
way to hedge their exposure to fluctuating grain prices.
Refco and other commercial grain trading firms don't comment
on their trading activities, nor do the Soviets. Soybean
futures prices closed higher as well, after it became clear
to traders that Tuesday's price slide in the final minutes of
trading wasn't going to continue into yesterday's trading
session, analysts said. Once soybean futures prices
stabilized in early trading, traders covered their "short"
positions by buying contracts to offset those they sold
Tuesday in anticipation of further price declines. July
soybean futures gained 8.25 cents to close at $6.5175 a
bushel. July wheat futures rose 5.75 cents to close at
$3.4750 a bushel.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices eased, but soonest-to-expire
positions continued firmer than more distant months. The May
delivery was off 0.80 cent a pound to $1.2130. However, July
declined by 1.15 cents to $1.1215, widening the premium of
May over July by 0.35 cent a pound to 9.15 cents. Among more
distant months, December 1990, which has the most significant
amount of trading, lost 1.50 cents on the day. Much like the
softness that took place after the strong expiration of the
April contracts last Thursday in New York, prices in London
yesterday softened, and the premium of the cash position on
the London Metal Exchange over the three-months' position
narrowed. On Tuesday, the premium had widened sharply after
buyers of expiring call options exercised their right to buy
futures contracts and sellers of the contracts had to buy
futures to fulfill their commitments. In Peru, the government
ordered miners and smelter workers of the Southern Peru
Copper Corp. to return to work by today or lose their jobs.
Late in the day, Reuter reported that, according to Jorge
Quesada, secretary general of the Peruvian National Mine
Workers' Federation, the workers would ignore the
government's decree and continue the strike that began March
12. However, a company spokesman said that the federation
didn't speak for the five unions involved in the strike.</p>
<p>COFFEE: Most futures prices eased slightly. The July
contract was off 0.48 cent to 92.34 cents. Statistics
indicate that since last July, when quota and price segments
of the International Coffee Agreement were suspended,
producing countries have been on a selling binge. For nine
months through March, exports of member producing countries
have totaled 61.3 million bags, compared with 48.8 million
bags during the same period a year earlier. A bag weighs 132
pounds. According to one New York coffee dealer, these sales
have caused supplies in importing countries to swell to
substantial proportions. But, he noted, shipments from April
through September will be much slower and will cause some of
these reserves to be used up. As a result, prices are likely
to remain stable until Central American coffee begins to come
to the market in September, he said. "A critical factor will
be if the shipments begin on time," he said. If they don't,
prices could rise. At the moment, there is little interest in
reviving the International Coffee Agreement, the dealer
noted. Most Central American countries are getting a
reasonable price for their coffee, and with the abolition of
the Brazilian Coffee Institute no one knows who would decide
whether Brazil would participate in a new pact, he said.</p>
