	<p class="article-leader">ARMONK N.Y. -- International Business Machines Corp. said
it will buy a minority stake in Valid Logic Systems Inc., a
San Jose, Calif.-based developer of software that helps
engineers design electronic parts.
   Continuing its recent series of investments in small
hardware and software companies, IBM said it will make an
initial investment of $11.2 million in Valid's newly issued
voting-convertible-preferred stock. That will give it between
5% and 8.3% of Valid, with the per-share price and resultant
stake depending on how Valid's common stock performs between
May 2 and May 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An IBM spokeswoman said the new capital will help Valid
develop applications that run on IBM's new RS-6000
workstation.</p>
<p>IBM also said it will buy $1.2 million of warrants to
acquire up to 4.5 million Valid common shares at $11 a share.
And it agreed to buy up to $90 million more in Valid
convertible preferred stock between 1991 and 1994, with the
condition that IBM's stake isn't required to exceed 49.99%.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Valid
shares closed at $3, up 37.5 cents.</p>
