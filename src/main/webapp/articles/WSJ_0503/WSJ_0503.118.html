	<p class="article-leader">German Wings Luftfahrtunternehmen G.m.b.H. filed for
bankruptcy proceedings and said it has about a "10% chance"
of being saved.
   A spokesman said that in the past week the company "had a
seat-load factor of 60%." German Wings, which struggled with
a load factor of about 45% for most of its maiden year, has
said it needed a load factor of about 55% to break even.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The small, one-year-old airline halted all flights late
Monday.</p>
<p>The airline said negotiations with a "large European
airline" collapsed at the last minute. German Wings said
contracts were ready to be signed with the partner, believed
to be British Airways. Reports in the German media have said
that British Airways was about to take a 49% stake in German
Wings for 70 million Deutsche marks ($41.7 million).</p>
<p>German Wings is owned by Peter and Christian Kimmel, who
have a 40% stake, publishing group F&F Burda Gesellschaft
fuer Beteiligungen G.m.b.H., with 45%, and Bayerische
Unternehmens-Beteiligungsgesellschaft AG, a venture capital
company controlled by several Bavarian banks, which holds
15%.</p>
