	<p class="article-leader">General Housewares Corp. named Paul A. Saxton, the
51-year-old president and chief operating officer, to the
additional post of chief executive officer.
   He succeeds John H. Muller Jr., 65, who remains chairman.
The appointment, which was made after the annual meeting
yesterday, is effective July 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Muller formed the Stamford, Conn., company almost 23
years ago. He cedes the top operations post just as the firm
has closed the sale of its candle unit, substantially
completed its effort to focus on the high end of cookware and
cutlery, and announced plans to move its corporate office to
Terre Haute, Ind., near its main plant.</p>
<p>Housewares is "a very difficult business, and I didn't
realize how much when I got in," Mr. Muller said.
Fluctuations in interest rates, changes in life styles, plus
competition from the U.S. and overseas created roller-coaster
results at General Housewares, and the stock price followed
suit.</p>
<p>General Housewares' stock price, which through the 1980s
ranged from $7 a share to near $30, has only rarely cleared
$14 a share since late 1984. The shares were unchanged
yesterday at $11 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading.</p>
<p>Now the challenge of strengthening and stabilizing General
Housewares' results, through marketing the company's Chicago
Cutlery and Magnalite cookware brands, falls entirely to Mr.
Saxton.</p>
<p>Mr. Saxton, a former English instructor, came to General
Housewares from Allegheny International Inc.'s Sunbeam
appliance unit, where he was vice president, sales and
marketing. In his 3 1/2 years at Sunbeam, Mr. Saxton said,
sales nearly doubled to $228 million, and in September 1987,
Mr. Muller hired him to light a fire under General
Housewares' cookware business. In August 1989, he was named
president and chief operating officer.</p>
<p>When Mr. Saxton joined General Housewares, one problem he
identified was that the company offered too many products,
confusing the sales force and making inventory control
difficult. He pared back the product lines, and in so doing
"jettisoned some things near and dear to {Mr. Muller's}
heart," Mr. Saxton said.</p>
<p>Mr. Saxton determined to get the company out of
mass-merchant, low-priced cookware. "The better place to be
was the high end, but I bet on it only so much," Mr. Muller
said. And Mr. Saxton brought the sales force in house,
replacing independent representatives.</p>
<p>Mr. Saxton also has determined to move the company's
marketing efforts away from retail stores and more directly
to consumers. He notes that the retailing industry is in
financial turmoil, and he suggests that busy consumers are
increasingly likely to choose offerings from a catalog or
home-shopping television program.</p>
