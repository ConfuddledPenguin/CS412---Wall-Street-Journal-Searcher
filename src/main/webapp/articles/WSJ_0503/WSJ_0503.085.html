	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- American General Corp., in a surprising move,
told shareholders it apparently won its proxy fight for
independence -- and then put itself on the auction block
anyway.
   Speaking near the close of the insurer's annual meeting,
Harold S. Hook, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the company was "very confident" it had defeated an attempt
by rival Torchmark Corp. to place five new directors on the
15-member board and encourage a sale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the applause from the 600 attendees had scarcely died
down when he dropped his bombshell: Concerned that American
General remained "vulnerable to possible acquisition at a
discount price," he said, the board decided to offer the
company for sale.</p>
<p>"We believe the full value of the company greatly exceeds
the value as reflected in the public market price for the
company's stock," Mr. Hook said. He added that directors also
think American General is worth "substantially in excess of"
the $50-a-share, or $6.3 billion, price Torchmark offered in
March.</p>
<p>American General's stock price surged $7.50 a share on the
news to close at $47.625 a share on very heavy volume of 6.6
million shares in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
Also on the Big Board, Torchmark shares closed at $44.25, up
62.5 cents.</p>
<p>American General also said it is more than doubling its
quarterly dividend to 80 cents a share from 39.5 cents,
payable June 1 to stock of record May 16.</p>
<p>Mr. Hook's surprising announcement underscores the
increasing willingness of institutional investors -- such as
pension funds, insurance companies and banks -- to exert
their influence over the companies in which they own stock.
Institutions hold about 70% of American General's shares, up
from about 30% 10 years ago, and they have become
increasingly vocal in urging Mr. Hook to do something about
the company's lagging stock price.</p>
<p>One person familiar with the proxy contest said American
General believes that only 40% of the 60 largest
institutional investors -- holding about 50 million shares --
sided with management. Even though smaller institutions and
individuals gave American General a victory of roughly 60
million to 40 million, management believed those large
holders "couldn't wait another two or three years" for
significant improvement in the stock price, the same person
said.</p>
<p>Carol Manning, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
Co., speculated that American General was disappointed by the
proxy results. "I think the proxy might have been closer than
they anticipated," she said.</p>
<p>Torchmark, the small Birmingham, Ala., insurance company
that first targeted American General as a takeover candidate,
issued a terse statement saying it was "very pleased" by Mr.
Hook's announcement. Torchmark added that, "regardless of the
proxy vote," it intends to make another proposal to combine
with American General.</p>
<p>But Jon W. Rotenstreich, Torchmark's president, was
somewhat more demonstrative. Grinning tightly, he remained in
his seat here until Mr. Hook finished his talk. When the
meeting adjourned, he leapt to his feet, planted a big kiss
on the cheek of Samuel Upchurch Jr., his general counsel,
then rushed over to chat with Mr. Hook.</p>
<p>Whether Torchmark can finish what it started remains to be
seen. The Alabama insurer is just one-sixth the size of
American General -- which has $32 billion in assets -- and
has yet to disclose how it would fund a takeover of that
size. Moreover, speaking before the annual meeting began, Mr.
Rotenstreich called the $50 a share price "not only adequate
but substantial." Results of the proxy contest aren't
expected to be released for a week or two.</p>
<p>And the competition could be fierce. Mr. Hook said that
American General has already received inquiries from
"numerous" others interested in buying pieces or otherwise
"offering their services" and that it has retained First
Boston Corp. to begin soliciting offers immediately.</p>
<p>Analysts' estimates of the final sales price range as high
as $55 a share, or $6.9 billion. The company has about 119
million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Analysts say potential bidders could include a number of
well-heeled foreign companies, including Allianz A.G. of West
Germany and Axa-Midi Assurances, a Paris-based insurer that
just dropped its bid for B.A.T Industries PLC's Farmers
Insurance Group. Mr. Hook, responding to a question at a news
conference, declined to comment on the possibility of a bid
from Axa-Midi, although he noted that the French company uses
a management system he developed and that top executives "are
good friends of mine."</p>
<p>An Axa-Midi spokesman said the company declined to comment
on a possible bid.</p>
<p>Possible domestic acquirers include Transamerica Corp.,
and Unitrend, a new company recently spun off by Teledyne
Inc.</p>
<p>The winning bidder won't be announced any time soon. "In
light of the size and complexity" of American General's
operations, "it may be several months before we begin the
process of detailed negotiations," Mr. Hook said. He added
that the company is prepared to auction off pieces if it
doesn't draw rich enough bids for the whole company.</p>
<p>A takeover would also have to be cleared by about 10 state
insurance commissioners -- a cumbersome process that has
impeded Torchmark's bid thus far. (Yesterday, a federal
appeals judge denied an attempt by Tennessee insurance
regulators to overturn a federal judge's order blocking them
from halting Torchmark's proxy solicitation, Torchmark said.)</p>
<p>Predictably, American General's aboutface sparked some
controversy in the investment community. Some takeover stock
traders were furious that American General didn't disclose it
was contemplating an auction earlier, although Mr. Hook said
the decision wasn't made until Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The company had vowed to remain independent throughout the
proxy fight.</p>
<p>And it clearly wasn't an easy decision for Mr. Hook, who
has run American General since 1978. He steered the company
through major changes in the 1980s, quintupling assets by
buying, among other things, a consumer-finance business and
several competing life insurance companies. "This has been a
very troublesome, very nettling problem to deal with," he
told one shareholder.</p>
<p>And yet Mr. Hook remained remarkably good-humored
throughout the annual meeting, offering wry asides and
introducing his directors as though he were a ring announcer
at a prize fight. He even complimented the Torchmark
management for its conduct during the proxy fight.</p>
<p>When Mr. Rotenstreich took the floor to deliver a
20-second pitch to shareholders, he jabbed Mr. Hook gently
for his refusal to meet with him earlier. "Finally, it's a
pleasure to meet you," he said. Mr. Hook paused dramatically.
"Thank you," he replied, drawing laughter.</p>
