	<p class="article-leader">Highland Superstores Inc. took an $8.9 million, or
49-cent-a-share charge against fourth-quarter earnings to
close stores and consolidate operations.
   The restructuring charge resulted in a fourth-quarter loss
of $2.8 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with net
income of $4.3 million, or 24 cents a share, during the
year-ago quarter. Revenue for the quarter ended Jan. 31 rose
less than 1%, to $316.7 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Plymouth, Mich.-based electronics and appliance
retailer said it plans to pull out of Shreveport, La., and
Milwaukee and suspend previous plans to open stores in
Rochester, N.Y., and Albany, N.Y. It also plans to modify
warehousing and distribution operations.</p>
<p>The company said it plans to reduce inventories and cut
staffing by 180 jobs in the areas where it is closing stores
or consolidating operations. Highland said the restructuring
plan was adopted to "maximize the company's long-term
operating results."</p>
<p>For the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, Highland reported a
loss of $12.4 million, or 68 cents a share, compared with net
income of $7.3 million, or 40 cents a share, a year ago.
Revenue rose 15% to $925 million.</p>
