8.5% to 920 million marks ($547.6 million), while sales
increased 5% to 11.03 billion marks.
   The West German chemical company said that even though
pretax profit fell, it still expects to post profit for all
of 1990 similar to that posted for 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hoechst had profit of 2.13 billion marks in 1989 on 45.9
billion marks in sales.</p>
<p>In the current year, the company financial performance has
been "handicapped" by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and
downward pressure on prices, the company said.</p>
<p>However it said that it managed to have "a good volume
development" in Western Europe.</p>
