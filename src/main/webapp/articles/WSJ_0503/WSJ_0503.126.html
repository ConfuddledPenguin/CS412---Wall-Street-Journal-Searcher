	<p class="article-leader">SOUTH AFRICA OPENED exploratory talks with the nation's
black leaders.
   Beginning three days of historic discussions in Cape Town
aimed at black-white power-sharing, President de Klerk's
government and the African National Congress quickly agreed
on an agenda to address specific problems blocking full-scale
constitutional negotiations. De Klerk called the meeting a
part of the "irreversible process of normalization," and ANC
leader Nelson Mandela said the talks "must make a decisive .
. . contribution to the repudiation" of the apartheid system.</p>

<p>LITHUANIA AGREED to consider suspending some
pro-independence laws.</p>
<p>In a letter to French and West German leaders who last
week proposed that such a compromise could lead to talks with
the Kremlin, President Landsbergis said the breakaway Baltic
republic was willing to temporarily freeze some secessionist
legislation that prompted Moscow's partial economic embargo.
Lithuania's legislature approved the correspondence, which
said "everything is negotiable" except the republic's March
11 declaration of independence.</p>
<p>Latvia's Popular Front unveiled an independence plan that
it hopes won't provoke a Kremlin crackdown. The republic's
legislature opens today.</p>

<p>East and West Germany reached agreement on a plan for an
economic merger by July 2. The accord calls for exchanging
East German wages, salaries, and pensions at a favorable
1-to-1 rate, but limits the amount of savings to be swapped
on par. It also gives East Berlin a political boost for
Sunday's local elections.</p>
<p>Baker said that NATO membership for a united Germany
should be decided by the alliance rather than the Soviet
Union. But the secretary of state, preparing for this
weekend's unification talks in Bonn, said he is willing to
consider Moscow's views when he meets tomorrow with
Shevardnadze.</p>

<p>The Bush administration proposed a "complete overhaul" of
a multilateral system of controlling high-tech exports in an
effort to give East Europe and the Soviet Union more access
to Western technology. The proposal would eliminate or ease
controls on 40 of 120 product categories currently
restricted.</p>

<p>A former HUD official testified before a House panel that
then-Vice President Bush's staff intervened to secure funding
for a project that had been rejected in 1985. DuBois Gilliam,
an aide to ex-Secretary Pierce, said the intervention led to
a $500,000 feasibility study on a trade center backed by a
Reagan/Bush supporter.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The U.S. and NATO allies are expected to propose scrapping
plans for new short-range missiles in West Germany, according
to Bush administration officials. The plan, which Baker is
likely to submit today in Brussels, also calls for talks with
Moscow on eliminating superpower nuclear artillery shells in
Europe.</p>

<p>Former hostage Reed disclosed that he was held for months
with two other U.S. captives in Lebanon, and said he was
angry and embarrassed that they haven't been freed. Speaking
in West Germany, the 57-year-old educator, who was released
Sunday in Beirut after 42 months in captivity, also said he
was held with two Britons.</p>
<p>The White House said it hasn't received any indications
that another U.S. hostage would be freed. In Tehran,
spiritual leader Ayatollah Khamenei said Iran would press its
efforts for the release of Western captives, but rejected any
talks with the U.S.</p>

<p>Hungary's legislature elected as interim president a
dissident writer who was imprisoned for six years after the
anti-Soviet revolt of 1956. Arpad Goencz, 68, was chosen
after the country's center-right and liberal parties forged
an agreement. The two parties ousted the Communists in
nationwide parliamentary elections last month.</p>

<p>U.S. and Canadian police took control of a Mohawk Indian
reservation in an attempt to quell a nine-month-old tribal
feud over casino gambling on the land. Two Indians were
killed Tuesday in a gunbattle on the 14,000-acre reservation,
which straddles the border between New York and Ontario.</p>

<p>The Education Department released its annual performance
review, showing that scores on two widely administered tests
barely changed over the past four years. Secretary Cavazos
said the results "will require more comprehensive and even
radical changes in our school systems."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Leftist rebels in El Salvador attacked government forces
and destroyed electricity pylons, and the military said the
insurgents attacked President Cristiani's residence during
the fighting. The raids came as the U.N. prepared to mediate
peace negotiations between the guerrillas and the government.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui named the country's top
military official to be the new prime minister, a move that
was criticized by the opposition as a setback for democracy.
Defense Minister Hau Pei-tsun, a four-star general, accepted
the post.</p>
