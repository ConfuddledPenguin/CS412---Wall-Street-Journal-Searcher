	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Republic Health Corp. said it completed
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
and emerged as a publicly traded company.
   The owner of 14 acute-care hospitals and two psychiatric
hospitals went private in August 1986 in a $406.2 million
leveraged buy-out led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp. But changes in Medicare regulations and
overly optimistic projections made the debt burden too heavy.
The company and its parent, REPH Acquisition Co., sought
bankruptcy-court protection last December to restructure
total debt of about $645 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the reorganization plan, which was approved by the
majority of the company's creditors before the company filed
for Chapter 11 protection, Republic Health and its parent
reduced total debt to $379 million and reduced their annual
interest obligations to $40 million, from $89 million.</p>
<p>Of the remaining debt, $74 million is owed banks and $86
million is owed under capitalized leases and notes. The
remainder consists of new securities issued to creditors, the
company said.</p>
<p>As part of the reorganization, REPH Acquisition was merged
into the now-publicly traded Republic Health. Debtholders own
88.8% of the new stock; holders of the old preferred stock
own 6.1%; and holders of the old common stock own 5.1%.</p>
<p>Under the reorganization plan, the company said, secured
debtholders received 81 cents for each dollar owed; senior
subordinated debtholders received 67 cents; and subordinated
debtholders received 20 cents.</p>
