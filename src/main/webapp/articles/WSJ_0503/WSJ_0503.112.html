	<p class="article-leader">EECO Inc. said it filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. The filing
affects the Santa Ana, Calif., company's keyboard, switch and
keypad divisions.
   Robert Bonney, chairman, said EECO Computer Inc., a
financially independent unit, and EECO Ltd., a subsidiary
based in Scotland, were not included in the petition. A
company spokesman said the filing didn't include a statement
of assets and liabilities, and said those figures weren't
immediately available.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Previously, the company had said it may seek
bankruptcy-law protection if Sanwa Bank Ltd.'s Sanwa Bank of
California declared the company in default on its $10 million
credit agreement, which expired March 31. EECO said it has
been unable to sell its Maxi-Switch division on terms
acceptable to the bank, and Sanwa had ceased to fund the
company's restructuring plan.</p>
<p>EECO also said George B. DeHuff III, previously president
of the switch division, was elected president and chief
executive officer of the high-technology products maker.</p>
