	<p class="article-leader">Republic Gypsum Co. said its directors voted to omit the
five-cent quarterly dividend, citing unfavorable conditions
in the housing and construction markets.
   The Dallas-based manufacturer of gypsum wallboard and
paperboard said the omission will save the company about $2
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said its board declared a 5% common stock
dividend to be distributed June 15 to stock of record May 31.
The stock dividend, which won't increase shareholders'
proportionate interest in the company, isn't in lieu of the
cash dividend, it said.</p>
