	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- R.H. Macy & Co. said in a letter to
shareholders that it narrowed losses in its third quarter
ended April 28 on flat sales.
   Although investors won't receive an audited filing for the
company's third quarter before mid-June, Macy management
regularly updates shareholders about the company's
performance. In the year-ago quarter, Macy had a loss of $64
million on revenue of $1.5 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the letter, which was signed by Edward Finkelstein,
chairman, Mark Handler, president, and Myron Ullman,
executive vice president, Macy noted that earnings before
interest, taxes and depreciation had exceeded the $154
million the company reported for the same period last year.</p>
<p>Macy executives also said they expect fourth-quarter
results will "be similar" to those of the third quarter.
However, they predicted that revenue will probably be higher
because of a planned July preseason sale. One of Macy's
objectives has been to reduce its storewide promotions, a
goal management said it is achieving. Retailers who saw their
Christmas profits disappear because of aggressive
price-cutting are trying to limit such discounting.</p>
<p>"The letter indicates not only that they had a plan, but
that the plan is working," said Barre W. Littel, a high yield
analyst at First Boston Corp. who recently issued an
optimistic report on Macy's junk bonds. "Macy entered spring
with low inventories, had fewer promotions, and increased
{operating} earnings as a result."</p>
<p>Mr. Littel noted that Macy continued to keep inventories
down, and by doing so, reduced both borrowings and interest
expense. In its shareholder letter, Macy management said its
inventory expenditures during the third quarter were $250
million below that of the 1989 quarter, a strategy that
enabled the company to cut its seasonal working capital
needs.</p>
<p>"Macy is working on both blades of the scissors, reducing
the seasonal borrowings and interest expense while improving
margins and operating expenses on the other," added Mr.
Littel.</p>
<p>In recent weeks Macy bond prices have dropped as anxiety
levels regarding retailer bonds have risen. The Macy 14.5%
senior subordinated debentures due 1998 are being quoted at
about 70.5 cents on the dollar, while the l4.5% subordinated
debentures due 2001 are being quoted at 60 cents on the
dollar.</p>
<p>Still, others besides First Boston are upbeat about Macy's
bonds. "Assuming a return to a normal retail environment and
a slow-growth economy, they are a good buy," said Clayton
Rose, managing director at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. "But
even if there is a recession and the company is forced to
restructure on a worst-case basis, the two coupon-paying
bonds have values only five to seven points below current
levels. Given the price level and the yield there is value
for the risk."</p>
