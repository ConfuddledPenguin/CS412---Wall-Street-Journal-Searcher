	<p class="article-leader">HOLLYWOOD -- On a recent Friday afternoon, 20 film
producers and studio executives received by messenger loud
ticking alarm clocks painted black with a cryptic message on
the face: "The Ticking Man is Coming."
   The clocks were sent out not by terrorists but by a talent
agency trying to draw attention to a new movie script, "The
Ticking Man," about an android implanted with a nuclear bomb.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The script itself, the executives were told, wouldn't be
available until the following Tuesday at 9 a.m. That day, it
took but 1 1/2 hours for the bidding to start. By nightfall,
the script was sold to "Die Hard" producer Larry Gordon's
company for a whopping $1.2 million. Just a few years ago,
$250,000 was considered an astronomical price for a script.</p>
<p>Hollywood is in the midst of a spending frenzy. Even
cynical executives here are astonished at the hyperinflation
in movie costs and in particular, the salaries of actors,
directors and even scriptwriters.</p>
<p>At the ultra-high end, Sylvester Stallone was just paid
more than $20 million for the coming "Rocky V," and Arnold
Schwarzenegger commanded about $10 million for the
soon-to-be-released "Total Recall."</p>
<p>On location, it seems no expense is too great. The
producers of "Die Hard 2" transported cast and crew to three
cities in a multimillion-dollar and largely unsuccessful
attempt to shoot during a real snowstorm. The total cost of
the airport thriller, being made for the film unit of Fox
Inc., is said by some in the industry to be fast approaching
$60 million. Joel Silver, the producer, insists those
estimates are way too high.</p>
<p>Paramount Communications Inc.'s movie unit is said to have
already spent between $50 million and $60 million on the new
Tom Cruise movie "Days of Thunder." At that rate, what's an
extra $5,000? So Paramount spent that much to knock down
walls in the Charlotte, N.C., Hilton hotel so that director
Tony Scott could have a suite (producers were occupying the
existing suites) and so that a large office could be created
out of about 10 small hotel rooms.</p>
<p>Paramount acknowledges the wall-busting but says it got a
great deal on room rentals. The studio also says public
estimates of the picture's budget are too high.</p>
<p>Many Hollywood executives recall past spending binges,
which produced some monumental flops and huge losses that
forced some studios into mergers or takeovers. Some
executives also point warily to the publishing industry,
which is struggling under the burden of a recent spate of big
advances paid to too many writers who didn't deliver at the
bookstores.</p>
<p>"There's an enormous loss of control over spending, and
the repercussions will be bad," says Barry Diller, chairman
of Fox Inc., a unit of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. "Who is
going to get struck by the lightning, where and how, I can't
tell you. But the loss of control is almost all-pervasive.
There is a whole slew of pictures with budgets above $40
million. Some of them are going to lose a whole lot of
money."</p>
<p>No major studios seem to be in trouble right now. In fact,
one of the things fueling the current spending binge is a
wave of consolidations that swept the industry over the past
few years, leaving the remaining studios stronger, wealthier,
and in some cases with new, cash-rich parents such as Japan's
Sony Corp.</p>
<p>The studio heads tapped to spend all this new money are
falling over one another in a race to get the most movies
into production and thus justify the backing of such
big-pocket investors. "There's an enormous amount of
competition and desperation," says David Hoberman, president
of Walt Disney Co.'s Touchstone Pictures unit.</p>
<p>This recent and unprecedented round of lavish spending on
so many movies eventually may trigger a glut as early as this
summer when a lot of big-budget movies are scheduled for
release. Harold Vogel, who follows the industry for Merrill
Lynch & Co., says, "It's highly questionable that all these
costs will ever be recouped. There's likely going to be a
period of consolidation and earnings difficulty."</p>
<p>Right now, there is a very receptive market for films.
Last year was a record one at the domestic box office, with
revenues topping $5 billion. Seven movies brought in more
than $100 million each in theaters, meeting Hollywood's
definition of blockbusters.</p>
<p>The growth of other revenue outlets has made producing
movies more lucrative and less risky. Money from foreign
distribution, videocassettes and network and cable television
sales can help make even a box-office flop profitable a few
years down the road.</p>
<p>For example, MGM/UA Communications Co.'s 1988 film
"Willow" appeared early on to be a flop. It cost about $55.5
million to make, and took in only about $27.8 million in the
studio's share of box-office revenues. But Paul Kagan
Associates estimates that foreign theatrical rentals added
another $41.8 million, domestic video another $18.2 million,
domestic television $15.3 million, and foreign video and
television $21.7 million, bringing total revenues to $124.7
million, making the film ultimately profitable.</p>
<p>Such growing markets helped total feature-film revenue hit
the $10 billion mark for last year, four times the level of a
decade ago, says Art Murphy, an analyst for Daily Variety.</p>
<p>No one noticed this more than the Japanese, who last year
made a huge investment in Hollywood. The biggest of such
moves came last September, when Sony bought Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. for about $3.4 billion, and then shocked
the industry by paying another $200 million for a small
company owned by Peter Guber and Jon Peters, two highly
successful producers, and naming them co-chairmen of
Columbia.</p>
<p>Last December, a Japanese brokerage house, Nomura Babcock
& Brown, signed a $100 million production agreement with
Morgan Creek, an independent production firm. Producer Larry
Gordon's company, Largo Entertainment, signed a $100 million
production agreement with JVC/Victor Co. of Japan earlier
last year. "In the absence of Japanese investments, there
would be far fewer films being made," says Mr. Vogel of
Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>No one is spending more money these days than Messrs.
Guber and Peters. The high-priced duo recently has bought 10
expensive scripts. They recently, for example, shelled out
$600,000 for "Radio Flyer," a script written by David Mickey
Evans, a 27-year-old virtual unknown. They are also paying
him a total of $500,000 more to direct the picture, his first
such assignment, and to handle rewrites of the script.</p>
<p>But plenty of other studios are cranking up movie
production, and some are bidding aggressively for new
material. Director Joe Roth, the new chairman of Twentieth
Century Fox, the film unit of Fox Inc., announced plans to
more than double production to 20 movies a year. Disney,
which has Touchstone Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures, last
year created a third movie unit, Hollywood Pictures, to help
boost production. "If you can maintain quality and increase
production, it's more money and more market share," says
Touchstone's Mr. Hoberman.</p>
<p>Competition among studios means increased profit and power
for Hollywood agents. "We are having the best year we have
ever had," says Jim Wiatt, president of International
Creative Management, one of the town's top agencies. Bruce
Kaufman, co-head of the motion picture and literary
department at Triad Artists, which sent around the alarm
clocks for "The Ticking Man," says, "We're selling a script
or a book a week here. A year ago, an agency would have been
lucky to sell half a dozen major scripts."</p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest beneficiaries of the frenzy, then, are
writers, who have generally been passed over while producers,
studio executives, stars, directors and even agents have
gotten rich.</p>
<p>Industry executives were stunned a few weeks ago when,
after a heated bidding war, Time Warner and David Geffen Co.
paid $1.75 million, the biggest script fee anyone can
remember, for "The Last Boy Scout," a new screenplay by
28-year-old writer Shane Black. The screenplay is about a
detective who links up with a former professional football
player to solve a murder. Mr. Black scored big with his first
movie, "Lethal Weapon."</p>
<p>A look at the bidding for scripts shows just how intense
competition is right now and also provides a look into the
pack mentality that tends to govern Hollywood's "creative"
process.</p>
<p>Roger Birnbaum, president of world-wide production at
Twentieth Century, says it is trying to stay out of the high
end of the script-bidding war. He recently considered
offering $25,000 for an option to buy "Stay Tuned," a script
by first-time screenwriters Tom S. Parker and Jim Jennewein
about an unhappy couple whose life takes a bizarre turn after
a door-to-door salesman loans them a TV set.</p>
<p>Mr. Birnbaum says he thought he would have to pay $200,000
to $250,000 to convert the option into ownership of the
script. That's when Morgan Creek swooped in and bought it
outright for $750,000. "We thought {the script} needed a lot
of work," Mr. Birnbaum says.</p>
<p>Morgan Creek's chief operating officer, Gary Barber, says,
"There were other offers later that were higher than ours
from major studios. The script was so unique, so well
written."</p>
<p>The hottest projects are still those that are somewhat
incongruously labeled "high-concept," which generally means
they are based on a conceptual gimmick, like boy becomes an
adult overnight, which translated into the hit film "Big."</p>
<p>A provocative life story can also command big money,
sometimes even before the script is written. Earlier this
year, Time Warner's Warner Bros. paid Polish Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa $1 million for the rights to his life
story. And last year, Warner Bros. -- while still under the
direction of Messrs. Guber and Peters -- reportedly paid $1
million for the rights to the story of the murdered Chico
Mendes, a Brazilian labor leader who fought destruction of
the rain forest.</p>
<p>Of the recent bidding battles, one of the most frenzied
and unusual was over "Prelude to a Kiss," a play that opened
off-Broadway in March and which is neither a so-called "high
concept" piece nor a compelling biography.</p>
<p>In fact, when the play, a love story with a happy ending,
first opened in Southern California in 1988, every major
studio turned down the movie rights.</p>
<p>But when it opened in New York, Frank Rich, the
influential theater critic for the New York Times, wrote a
rave review. "I loved this play," he announced.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Hollywood had changed its mind. Playwright Craig
Lucas, 39, and his agents at William Morris Agency were
inundated with calls from Hollywood's heaviest hitters,
including Disney and independent producer Ed Pressman, whose
credits include "Wall Street." Mr. Lucas, who has written
several off-Broadway plays to critical acclaim but wasn't a
big shot in Hollywood, says he found that his phone answering
machine got more than 30 messages a day, mostly from
Hollywood moguls. One day it logged 70 calls.</p>
<p>Record producer Quincy Jones, who has a movie production
deal with Warner Bros., flew in and spent an evening with Mr.
Lucas at the trendy Odeon restaurant. "He said whatever you
want, just let me know," recalls Mr. Lucas. Even Columbia's
Mr. Guber called Mr. Lucas and said, "We want you to be
happy."</p>
<p>Studio executives tried to win favor in other ways. One
sent Mr. Lucas a studio hat. Another sent him a book about
dogs after Mr. Lucas mentioned he likes them.</p>
<p>Mr. Lucas's agent at William Morris, Michael Peretzian,
received seven bids for Mr. Lucas to write the script. Mr.
Lucas finally agreed to a deal with Fox and producer Michael
Gruskoff for $1 million. The studio also agreed to almost all
of Mr. Lucas's creative demands, including one that the
play's director, Norman Rene, be allowed to direct the movie.
"We made our demands and 50 minutes later they said yes,"
says Mr. Peretzian.</p>
<p>Looking back with awe on the experience, Mr. Lucas says,
"People called and said: `Tell us what you want. It can be in
the middle of the night.' I have everyone's home phone
number. I felt like I was tripping."</p>
