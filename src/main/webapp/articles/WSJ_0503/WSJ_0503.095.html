	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices ended little changed in lifeless
trading activity as investors anxiously awaited details of
the Treasury's next big bond auction.
   The announcement, which came very late in the day, had
little impact on the market because the terms of the auction
were as analysts had expected. The Treasury said it will sell
a record $30.5 billion of notes and bonds at next week's
quarterly refunding of the federal debt. The government will
auction $10.5 billion of three-year notes Tuesday, $10
billion of 10-year notes Wednesday and $10 billion of 30-year
bonds next Thursday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Treasury also set the next auction for Resolution
Funding Corp. thrift bailout bonds for July 10 and said it
will announce details of the auction July 3.</p>
<p>In trading yesterday, Treasury bond prices initially fell
as much as 3/8 point, or $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount, following news that Federal Reserve Board Vice
Chairman Manuel Johnson said inflation was too high.</p>
<p>But Treasury prices recuperated later to end unchanged to
about 1/8 point higher.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson's remarks, which were made to reporters after
a speech to executives of the National Automated Clearing
House Association, were interpreted by investors as yet
another sign that the Fed may eventually raise interest rates
in an effort to reduce inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>The comments were especially disturbing considering that
the date of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee meeting
is fast approaching. The committee, which is the Fed's
policy-making arm, will meet on May 15, and the members will
decide whether to change monetary policy.</p>
<p>Fears of Fed tightening seemed to have calmed down a bit
later in the day when the Fed released the latest edition of
its so-called beige book, a summary of economic conditions
prepared for use by policymakers before their May 15 meeting
in Washington.</p>
<p>The report indicated that economic activity continues to
expand slowly across the country, but not fast enough to
allow the Fed room to raise interest rates. Manufacturing,
which has been depressed in many parts of the nation, is
improving.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>The mortgage securities market was abuzz with talk that
the Comptroller of the Currency may soon impose curbs on
commercial banks' holdings of certain high-yielding mortgage
securities.</p>
<p>Banks have been big buyers of all mortgage securities
during the past year because new risk-based capital bank
standards favor these securities over many traditional bank
investments.</p>
<p>But dealers on Wall Street said the comptroller's office
is concerned with the large increase in bank holdings of
derivative securities, which are a riskier type of mortgage
security. These would include highly volatile securities such
as inverse floating-rate, zero-coupon, residual and "jump Z"
bonds. The comptroller might also restrict "companion" bonds
with original average lives of more than seven years.
Companion bonds are relatively high-yielding derivative
securities that are created in tandem with
prepayment-protected planned amortization classes.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the comptroller said regulations on bank
investment in mortgage securities are "in the formulation
stage," but nothing has been made final.</p>
<p>Andrew Carron, head of mortgage research at First Boston
Corp., said banks would probably be permitted to hold most
standard derivative mortgage securities. These would include
"plain vanilla" real estate mortgage investment conduits,
which are a type of collateralized mortgage obligation.</p>
<p>In trading yesterday, most mortgage-backed securities
ended little changed.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>Ford Capital BV, the Dutch-based finance subsidiary of
Ford Motor Co., made its debut in the U.S. credit markets
with $400 million of 12-year notes. The notes were priced to
yield 9.952%.</p>
<p>Ford Capital is a financing vehicle set up primarily to
refinance debt incurred in connection with Ford Motor's $2.52
billion acquisition of Jaguar PLC.</p>
<p>It is unusual for offshore units of U.S. companies to tap
the U.S. debt market because their primary purpose is to
raise capital through the Eurobond market.</p>
<p>But Peter Milhaupt, director of capital markets at lead
underwriter First Boston Corp., said the U.S. market is
currently more attractive than the Euromarket for domestic
issuers.</p>
<p>Among other things, Mr. Milhaupt noted that European rates
have been rising relative to U.S. rates and that traditional
Eurobond investors tend to prefer securities that mature in
10 years or less.</p>
<p>Moreover, he said, "The Euromarket has not been able to
consistently" absorb certain types of bond offerings. "It is
our judgment that for the size, $400 million, and the
maturity, 12 years, {Ford} could not get this kind of
execution in that market in Eurodollars or for that matter by
swapping out of currencies" for dollars, said Mr. Milhaupt.</p>
<p>Although First Boston officials said the deal went well
and attracted a broad-based buying interest from
institutional investors, some corporate bond traders said the
issue was priced a little aggressively.</p>
<p>The non-callable notes were priced at a spread of 0.86
percentage point above the Treasury's 10-year note. A
comparable Ford Holdings 9 1/4% issue of 10-year notes is
trading at 0.89 percentage point above the Treasury's 10-year
note, dealers said. Officials at First Boston said the deal
hasn't been completely sold yet.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>Broad buying interest buoyed the junk bond market, lifting
prices of most actively traded bonds.</p>
<p>Most junk bonds, which are high-yield speculative-grade
securities with low credit ratings or no credit ratings,
gained 1/8 and 1/4 point.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said junk bonds
were the best performing sector of the bond market last month
after being one of the worse performing sectors most of last
year.</p>
<p>In its latest bond-market performance report, Moody's said
junk bonds eked out a small 0.5% total return last month.
While that's not a stellar performance, it's far better than
the minus 2% total return posted on long-term Treasury bonds
and the minus 1.5% total return on investment-grade corporate
bonds. Moody's said the biggest losers last month were
long-term zero-coupon Treasury bonds, which plunged 8% last
month.</p>
<p>In trading yesterday, the junk bonds of Ames Department
Stores Inc. were again the major market-mover as vulture
funds and other investors in distressed securities continued
to swoop down and snap up the retailer's bonds.</p>
<p>Ever since the Rocky Hill, Conn.-based firm filed for
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code,
its bonds have been gaining ground. Some investors believe
the bonds will be valued at higher levels if and when the
company emerges from bankruptcy-law proceedings. Ames's 13%
senior subordinated reset notes, due in 1999, rose 2 1/4
points to end at 27 1/2.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of R.H. Macy & Co. were unchanged despite
news that the retailer has reduced its loss for the third
quarter. In a letter to investors, Macy said that despite
almost flat sales, it was able to reduce its loss for the
quarter ended April 28. In the year-earlier third quarter,
the company reported a loss of $64 million, on sales of $1.5
billion.</p>
<p>Macy's 14 1/2% senior subordinated debentures, due in
1998, were unchanged at 70 1/2, while its 14 1/2%
subordinated debentures, maturing in 2001, were little
changed at 61.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bonds ended at 94 19/32 to yield
9.01%, up from 94 14/32 to yield 9.03% on Tuesday. Two-year
notes ended unchanged at 99 23/32 to yield 8.997%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates ended little changed. The discount rate
on three-month Treasury bills eased slightly to 7.90% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 8.152%, while the rate on six-month
bills was slightly lower at 8.02% for a bond-equivalent yield
of 8.464%.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>In a repeat performance of Tuesday's sleepy dealings,
municipal bonds finished narrowly mixed in fairly active
trading. Some actively traded issues were off as much as 1/4
point, while other issues were up as much as 1/8 point.</p>
<p>Municipals aren't expected to show much life until the
path of the Treasury bond market is clearer, traders said.</p>
<p>In light primary market activity, a First Boston Corp.
group priced $70 million of Indiana Health Facilities
Authority revenue bonds.</p>
<p>In secondary market activity, New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was unchanged at 95 bid to
yield 7.62%.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>News that East and West Germany agreed on terms of
monetary union had only a modest impact on the West German
bond market.</p>
<p>Under terms of the agreement, most East Germans will be
able to convert 4,000 East German marks of savings into West
German marks at a 1-to-1 exchange rate. East Germans who are
60 years old and over will be able to convert 6,000 East
German marks at the favorable rate, while those 14 and
younger will be limited to 2,000 marks. Remaining savings
will be converted at a 2-to-1 rate. West Germany said the new
official exchange rates become effective immediately.</p>
<p>Investors took the news surprisingly well, considering the
West German bond market has been depressed for months because
of fears that reunification of the two currencies would
result in exorbitant inflation, especially if the exchange
rate came in at 1 to 1.</p>
<p>But analysts said inflation concerns already have been
priced into the market.</p>
<p>In trading, West Germany's benchmark 7 3/4% bond due in
2000 fell 0.25 point to 92.95 to yield 8.85%.</p>
