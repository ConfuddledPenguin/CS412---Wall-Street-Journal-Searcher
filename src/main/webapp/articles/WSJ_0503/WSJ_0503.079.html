	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Years of increasing efforts to improve
America's schools have failed to boost high school student
scores on two widely administered tests.
   In its annual performance review, the Education Department
reported that scores have barely changed over the past four
years. "We have reached a plateau," Education Secretary Lauro
Cavazos complained. "Moving beyond this point will require
more comprehensive and even radical changes in our school
systems."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The average score on the Scholastic Aptitude Test slipped
to 903 in 1989 from 904 in 1988, while the average score on
the American College Testing Program fell to 18.6 from 18.8.
The report also noted that the proportion of public school
ninth-graders who graduate with their class fell to 71.1%
last year from 71.7% the year before.</p>
<p>These figures for the 1988-1989 school year are likely to
become one of the baselines against which the Bush
administration's efforts to improve U.S. education are
measured. Early this year, President Bush and the nation's
governors detailed an ambitious set of education goals for
the year 2000.</p>
