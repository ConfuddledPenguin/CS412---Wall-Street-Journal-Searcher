	<p class="article-leader">CORPORATIONS TUNE IN to more kinds of video projects.
   "In the early '70s it was a few very large,
forward-looking companies" that were using video and
television, says John McPherson of Sony Corp. of America "Now
it's everybody." Uses range from employee video magazines to
video conferencing. At some companies, employees even send
video memos. Why the boom? Costs have come down to the point
where companies can tailor their message to very small
audiences, says Al Weiss of American Express Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Company video departments are expanding rapidly. At
American Express, the department has grown from five to more
than 50 in five years. The corporate market "will buy more
video equipment in 1990 than call-letter TV stations," says
Kevin Condon of Corporate Video Decisions magazine,
estimating purchases of equipment and services to hit at
least $5.5 billion in 1990. Growth of desktop video
production systems is expected to spur expansion.</p>
<p>Not far away: The day when there's "a video on everybody's
desk," says Stephen Kultala of Coors Brewing Co.</p>
<p>IMPORT CAR MAKERS accelerate used-car marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Anxious to help dealers stay profitable in a highly
competitive market, import auto makers for the first time are
pushing the sale of second-hand vehicles. Mercedes-Benz of
North America advertises its "pre-owned" car warranty program
to attract shoppers who want a Mercedes, but want to spend
$25,000 or less. Dealers offer one- or two-year
factory-backed warranties on most second-hand models with
less than 100,000 miles. Prestige Motors, Paramus, N.J., says
used-car sales are up 25% since launching the program as a
pilot in late 1988.</p>
<p>Other car makers consider lending their credibility and
their advertising dollars to help dealers pump up used car
sales. Saab-Scania of America Inc. says it's developing a
used Saab promotion that may include a warranty. Mitsubishi
Motors Corp.'s U.S. sales arm says it will soon start
featuring used cars in some of its national advertising. One
hope: A good resale market will help spur sales of new cars.</p>
<p>EUROPE TRAVEL takes off despite a shortage of tourist
amenities.</p>
<p>Travel to the Eastern bloc is so heavy that Squire Travel
Service, San Francisco, says it couldn't book a $3,000 June
trip to Prague for lack of hotel space. While Czechoslovakia
is perhaps the most popular destination, Bulgaria -- with its
Black Sea resorts -- may be the country that's most ready for
tourists, says Zdenka Zila of Balkan Holidays Ltd., a New
York tour operator.</p>
<p>Many tours have a special focus, ranging from Eastern
European cooking to gemology. Politics & Prose bookstore,
Washington, organizes a trip that will meet with authors and
politicians. "Eastern Europe is really the place to see
history in the making," says bookstore owner Carla Cohen.
Still, the real surge in East European travel won't come
until next year. "Most leisure and vacation travelers made
their plans last December," says Lois Lane, a New York travel
agent, noting tour operators also need time to put packages
together.</p>
<p>Travel Broker, a Salt Lake City passport and visa service,
is getting 30 calls a week from people interested in Eastern
Europe, up from three a year ago.</p>
<p>THROWAWAY VIEWING: A paperback videocassette designed to
be thrown away after five to 10 playings is being marketed by
Philmax Inc., Owings Mills, Md. Possible uses: movie
previews, product instructions or video letters.</p>
<p>NINJA TURTLE MANIA prompts a surge in pet-turtle buying,
which the New York Turtle and Tortoise Society finds
worrisome. Not only can baby turtles transmit salmonella
bacteria to children, the society says, but they can infect
native turtle populations with other diseases if released
into the wild.</p>
<p>FERTILIZER SENSORS being developed by Georgia Institute of
Technology use beams of light to detect fluctuating levels of
ammonia -- released as soil loses nitrogen. The sensors would
indicate when soil needs fertilizing, thus cutting farming
costs.</p>
<p>TEEN BUYING POWER keeps growing, despite a declining
teen-age population.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, teen spending grew from $39.1 billion to
$55.9 billion, despite a 15.5% population drop to 23.2
million, says the Rand Youth Poll, New York. The affluence of
teens today "is somewhat shocking," says Lester Rand,
president. Car ownership by teens tripled during the decade,
with 36% of those eligible to drive now owning cars. The
number with their own telephones nearly doubled, and 47% now
own TVs, compared with only 29% in 1980.</p>
<p>One reason: The declining teen population has made today's
teen a valuable commodity in the labor market. "What had been
an embarrassing abundance of kids reaching working age has
reversed itself," says Fabian Linden of the Conference Board.
That can translate into incomes of up to $300 a week, says
Mr. Rand. "There are very few products that are out of reach
of today's teens," says Peter Zollo of Teenage Research
Unlimited, Northbrook, Ill.</p>
<p>With the number of teen-agers set to increase starting in
1992, more people are getting interested in the teen market,
says Mr. Zollo.</p>
<p>BRIEFS: Power ties go ecological: Field Brothers menswear
stores say floral and leaf patterns now make up 25% of its
tie stock. . . . Shelter, a Chicago nightclub, celebrates the
25th anniversary of the Lava Lite with a display of 200
cone-shaped lamps.</p>
