	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Expect sparks to fly at Monday's annual
meeting of Fibreboard.
   The tiny wood-products and insulation company has a market
value of not quite $40 million, but shareholders are raising
a bigtime stink over a board-approved plan to double the
amount of options, stock awards and stock-appreciation rights
going to company insiders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When Fibreboard was spun off in 1988 from Louisiana
Pacific, its board approved a stock option and rights plan
covering 350,000 shares, equivalent to 9% of its 3.9 million
shares outstanding. Now it wants to amend that plan by
doubling the number to 700,000, or 18% of the shares
currently outstanding -- subject to a vote of shareholders.</p>
<p>The meeting will be held in Roxboro, N.C., the site of a
small Fibreboard plant that is 2,500 miles from the company's
home base in Concord, Calif.</p>
<p>"Management and directors are feasting on the value of the
company," says Jery Chambers, a Buffalo, N.Y., investment
manager with Courier Capital whose clients own 170,000
shares. "We're going down to scream and yell."</p>
<p>Lawrence Hart, the chairman and the sole management
director, says, "The idea is to give an equity stake in the
company so our own personal finances are very tied in with
that of the company."</p>
<p>However, Fibreboard's managers and directors haven't
invested more than a pittance of their own in Fibreboard. Its
executive officers and directors had purchased only 7,062
shares, or 0.18% of the company, as of the March 29 proxy
statement. Mr. Hart says the total has risen since then, but
he won't say by how much.</p>
<p>Graef Crystal, a compensation specialist and professor at
the Haas School of Business at the University of California
at Berkeley, says "the percentage of shares {in Fibreboard's
plan} is awesomely large. The rule of thumb is 5% of the
shares outstanding."</p>
<p>Mr. Hart responds that Fibreboard is an unusual case and
that compensation is adequate and comparable to that of other
"high-risk, start-up companies."</p>
<p>Fibreboard's lumber operations actually are longstanding;
it isn't a start-up venture in the sense that a high-tech
firm is. But the company does entail plenty of risk.</p>
<p>The company, a former asbestos-products manufacturer,
lives under a cloud of litigation. However, a trial court has
ruled that Fibreboard's insurers are liable for at least the
bulk of anticipated claims. The bottom line is that while
Fibreboard isn't yet out of the woods, the asbestos cloud
appears to be clearing.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the company owns 117,000 acres of
timber that have a book value of $30 million but could be
worth $140 million. Last year, it sold 27,500 acres of
relatively lower quality timber and fetched almost $1,200 an
acre. It also owns a ski resort on the northern side of Lake
Tahoe, Calif., which is on the market and could be worth
double its $19 million book value.</p>
<p>Those values won't be realized overnight, but they suggest
that if the asbestos cloud does abate, Fibreboard's stock,
currently trading at 9 7/8, could become much more valuable.</p>
<p>Donald Miller, managing partner of Greylock Financial
Partnership, who says he owns 62,000 shares, says the options
pave the way for management and directors to reap a small
fortune. And, Mr. Miller notes, the options are being
proposed at a time when the stock is depressed, down from
last year's high of 19 1/4, and trading at 25% of stated book
value, which is $36 a share.</p>
<p>That means the exercise price will be cheaper. Some of the
shares, however, are in the form of restricted stock awards
-- stock that is given away free to managers who hang on for
three years.</p>
<p>Such awards, Mr. Crystal says, require of managers that
they "breathe in and out on the company payroll." Mr. Hart,
who has so far been awarded 35,000 in restricted share
rights, says "this gives me an incentive to perform" well
enough to stay employed. He also says recruiting managers and
directors for an asbestos-plagued company is hard, and
compensation levels therefore are justified. Mr. Hart,
incidentally, received a 118% increase in salary and bonus
last year to $454,000; he also was given a golden parachute
plan.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller says there is a larger problem of "corporate
governance" at Fibreboard. Fibreboard's four outside
directors, who sit on the compensation committee, each
receive options on at least 2,000 shares and a $10,000
stipend annually. Mr. Miller questions whether this
influences their opinion of Fibreboard's option plan.</p>
<p>Several directors couldn't be reached or wouldn't comment.</p>
<p>E. Judge Elderkin, a Fibreboard director and a partner in
a San Francisco law firm that represents Fibreboard, is on
the board's compensation committee. He says through a
spokeswoman that it is inappropriate for him to respond and
refers questions to Mr. Hart.</p>
