	<p class="article-leader">Stock prices continued their muted rebound while bond
prices stabilized.
   A late rally helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average
up 20.72 points to 2689.64 in relatively light trading.
Long-term bond prices were unchanged and the dollar gained
modestly against the mark while slipping against the yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts said the stock market's gain, the third in as
many days, came from bargain-hunting and the perception that
interest rates may be nearing a peak. The most optimistic
analysts contend that inflation fears have been exaggerated
and that interest rates may soon ease. The Federal Reserve's
"beige book," a summary of economic conditions around the
nation, tended to support that view yesterday, citing modest
economic growth and "no general upward pressure" on
industrial prices.</p>
<p>But traders said investors shouldn't read too much into
the stock market's performance so far this week. Trading
activity has been modest at best, they say, and this week's
gains may be nothing more than a temporary bounce from last
week's big drop, which saw the Dow industrials lose more than
50 points.</p>
<p>Still, bond traders have been impressed that prices for
long-term Treasurys haven't dropped precipitously this week
given other economic news that shows the economy picking up
steam. They point especially to Tuesday's survey of the
nation's purchasing managers, which showed a resumption in
economic growth in the industrial sector after nearly a year
of contraction. And they're looking to Friday's government
report on April employment levels for further clarification
about the economy's health.</p>
<p>At the same time, the bond market is facing a potential
problem in the form of next week's big quarterly Treasury
refunding auction. Yesterday the Treasury said it plans to
sell $10.5 billion of three-year notes, and $10 billion each
of 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. That's about in line with
what many traders expected.</p>
<p>But the question is what role Japanese investors will
play. In previous auctions they have been major buyers, but
interest rates in Japan have reached competitive levels with
U.S. rates. If big Japanese buyers decide to focus more of
their purchases in Japan, where they don't face any currency
risks, the yield on U.S. bonds could rise sharply from
current levels. In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices climbed in light trading. Volume on the New
York Stock Exchange totaled 141.6 million shares. Advancing
issues on the Big Board outnumbered declining issues 864 to
612.</p>
<p>Bond prices were virtually unchanged. The yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year issue stood at 9.01%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading the
currency was quoted at 1.6848 marks and 157.95 yen, compared
with 1.6808 marks and 158.83 yen Tuesday.</p>
