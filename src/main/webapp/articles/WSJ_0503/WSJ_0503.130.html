	<p class="article-leader">Former assistant deputy secretary of state Charles H.
Fairbanks Jr. writing in the spring issue of the National
Interest:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>From the communist point of view, Gorbachev is a jinx, a
hoodoo, a Jonah. His arrival everywhere presages disaster.
Like Jaruzelski and Poszgay, he did not understand the
people's deep weariness of communism, nor could he sense the
people's mood at a particular crux. Perhaps Gorbachev's
soaring ambition, his splendid vision of the future, and his
courage are spoiled by his lifetime as a member of an
isolated priestly caste, whose pride was its ability to
manipulate people.</p>
