	<h3>Your Money Matters: Investors May Be Ready for `Prime' Time</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Little-known securities called Americus Trust "Primes" may
be a good choice for people who want to own stocks these days
but are anxious about price declines.
   Traded on the American Stock Exchange, Primes function
like lower-risk versions of 26 blue-chip issues. The Primes
allow investors to collect almost all of the dividend income
from the related stock and any appreciation in the price of
the stock up to a preset maximum.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While Primes generally lag when the market takes off, they
suffer less than the related stock when prices collapse. And
because Primes sell for less than the related stock, several
will deliver solid, double-digit returns over the next two
years as long as the related stock prices don't fall below
current levels.</p>
<p>"It's a good way for someone to have some participation in
the stock market without being quite so nervous," says Tracey
Faby, a senior investment officer with Axe-Houghton
Management Inc., Tarrytown, N.Y., a money management unit of
insurer USF&G Corp. that has been a big buyer of Primes.</p>
<p>These odd-ball securities are the brainchild of Americus
Shareowner Service Corp., which sponsored a series of
"Americus Trusts" from 1983 to 1987. (No new trusts are being
created because of changes in the tax rules.)</p>
<p>The idea was to divide some household-name stocks into a
conservative, income-oriented investment and a
more-speculative, appreciation-oriented investment. Investors
tendered stock to the trusts, and for each share received a
conservative Prime and a speculative "Score."</p>
<p>Prime holders get the stock dividend minus an
administrative charge of as much as a nickel a year. The
holders also get the appreciation in the underlying common up
to a preset maximum price, or "termination claim." When the
trusts terminate after five years, they receive common shares
worth the lower of the then-current stock price or the
termination claim.</p>
<p>Price appreciation beyond the termination claim goes to
the Score holders. But Prime holders are compensated for
accepting that limit because Primes sell for less than the
related common.</p>
<p>That discount is central to the Primes' appeal.</p>
<p>The lower price provides "a head start on the stock in
terms of performance," explains J. Richard Tashjian, a senior
vice president of Sovran Capital Management Corp., a unit of
banking company Sovran Financial Corp. Further, Mr. Tashjian
says, "the discount represents your reduction in risk."</p>
<p>Consider General Electric Co. Primes, in which Sovran
Capital has a big stake. GE Primes are selling at $55.63, a
sizable discount from $64 for the company's stock, as of
April 30. When the GE Americus Trust terminates in two years,
Prime holders will get either the prevailing stock price or
the $70 termination claim, whichever is lower.</p>
<p>GE Primes will deliver an annualized return of 10.8% from
now to termination if GE's stock price and dividend remain at
current levels, according to calculations by Peter Broms,
Kidder, Peabody & Co. senior vice president. That return
comprises dividend income and the appreciation from the Prime
price to the current stock price.</p>
<p>The annualized return will be a heftier 14.7% if the stock
rises at least to the termination claim. And it will be 15.6%
if the dividend also grows at the rate Kidder expects.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GE common will have to fall below the current
Prime price, which is 13% below the current stock price, for
someone buying the Prime now to take a loss at termination.</p>
<p>Among other Primes that offer double-digit returns even
without price appreciation, Atlantic Richfield gets high
marks from Robert Haber, manager of Fidelity Balanced Fund.
Ms. Faby of Axe-Houghton likes Du Pont, General Motors,
Johnson & Johnson and Mobil.</p>
<p>But don't buy any Prime if you don't like the company.
"You always want to make sure you have faith in the outlook
for the underlying common stock," Kidder's Mr. Broms says.</p>
<p>Investors should also realize that the Primes vary greatly
in the levels of risk and reward they entail. Some offer
limited returns and risk that make them comparable with
bonds, while others expose holders to almost all the price
fluctuations of the related stocks.</p>
<p>It's all a function of the relationship between the common
stock price and the Prime's termination claim.</p>
<p>The Philip Morris Prime is often cited as a good bond
alternative. That's because Philip Morris common stock, as of
April 30, was trading at $42, far above the termination claim
of $27.50. That gives Prime buyers a high probability of
collecting the full termination claim when the Philip Morris
trust expires in July 1992.</p>
<p>At the April 30 price of $24.50 for a Philip Morris Prime,
Kidder figures investors will earn 10.6% a year without
dividend growth and 11.7% with the projected dividend growth.
That compares with a yield of around 9% on two-year Treasury
notes.</p>
<p>Mr. Broms says investors might also want to consider the
American Telephone & Telegraph and GTE Primes as fixed-income
alternatives. Two Primes that currently do not offer
attractive returns as bond substitutes are the Procter &
Gamble and Coca-Cola issues.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the other end of the spectrum are Primes
such as American Express, Eastman Kodak, International
Business Machines and Xerox where the common stock price is
far below the termination claim. The Primes of such issues
sell at only a small discount to the underlying common stock
because the termination claim doesn't crimp the appreciation
potential of the Prime very much.</p>
<p>Investors interested in those companies should consider
the Primes as "a cheaper way to own the same stocks," says
Sandy Weisman, a broker with Prescott, Ball & Turben Inc. in
Cleveland.</p>
<p>But Mr. Broms advises sticking with the common stock if
the price discount of the Primes is less than 5%, as it
currently is with IBM and Xerox. For such a small savings, he
figures, it's not worth giving up the chance to make a
killing if the stock goes through the roof.</p>
