	<div class="article-body"><p>In local elections across Britain today, Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives are bracing themselves for
a drubbing from voters angered by the nation's new so-called
poll tax.</p>
<p>National opinion surveys show the opposition Labor Party
running up to 23 percentage points ahead of the Tories. Labor
could gain an additional 600 local-council seats, giving the
party majority control of 24 councils -- including, perhaps,
the Tory flagship boroughs of Westminster and Wandsworth in
London.</p>
<p>Besides serving as a kind of referendum on the poll tax,
the elections also represent the last chance for voters to
express their feelings before this fall, when Mrs. Thatcher
might face another challenge to her leadership of the
Conservative Party. A poor showing in today's elections would
further weaken her and possibly strengthen the resolve of
Tory politicians eager to succeed her.</p>
<p>One British bookmaking firm yesterday said there is a
six-in-five chance that Mrs. Thatcher will leave office
before the next general election, which must be called by
mid-1992.</p>
<p>MORE STRIKES IN WEST GERMANY</p>
<p>About 68,000 members of West Germany's powerful IG Metall
union staged a new round of so-called warning strikes to
press their demands for higher pay and a shorter work week,
union officials said. Some 200 companies were affected. The
total is slightly above union claims of 65,000 workers
participating in strikes last Monday and far above the 10
plants hit that day. Yesterday's strikes were concentrated in
the North Wuerttemberg/North Baden district and in the state
of North Rhine-Westphalia, two of the nation's major
industrial centers.</p>
<p>EUROPE'S TRUCK POLLUTION</p>
<p>The European Community Commission proposed tougher
emissions standards for trucks that would cut pollution from
such vehicles by up to 60%. The plan would bring EC members
into line with other European countries -- for example,
Switzerland -- and the U.S. Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC's
environment commissioner, said an average of 50% to 60% of
goods are carried by road in the community. Trucks can cause
10 times more pollution than other forms of transport, such
as rail or ships, he added.</p>
<p>A COSTLY LONDON MUGGING</p>
<p>A London mugger walked away with almost $500 million in
negotiable securities yesterday after holding up a messenger
at knifepoint on a busy street. Stolen were certificates of
deposit worth $200 million and Treasury bills worth $280
million. A Bank of England spokesman said that while the
bearer certificates were negotiable, it would be difficult to
cash them as the holder would "have to demonstrate that he
has good title to the documents." Hand carrying is the usual
way such securities are moved around London. However, later
this year the Bank of England plans to replace messengers
with an electronic clearing system.</p>
<p>STAKE IN AUSTRIAN AIRLINES</p>
<p>Japan's All Nippon Airways Co. increased its equity share
in Austrian Airlines to 9% from 3.5%. All Nippon, which had
purchased an initial lot of 77,000 shares a year ago, said it
took up an additional 157,000 shares for about $65 million.
Austrian Airlines offered a total of 400,000 new shares
yesterday, aiming to promote privatization of the company,
whose largest shareholder is the Austrian government. After
the allocation of new shares, the government's holdings will
decline to 51.4% from 61.4%.</p>
<p>SOVIET LABOR MOVEMENT</p>
<p>The first Soviet Congress of independent trade unions, in
a challenge to the state labor movement, voted to form a
council to unite the country's unofficial workers' groups.
"The aim is to unite all forces and to guarantee the rights
of working people in this difficult economic situation," said
a spokesman for the congress, which closed yesterday. The
congress also passed a resolution condemning the Soviet
leadership for leading the economy to the brink of collapse.</p>
<p>GREECE WANTS CENTENARY GAMES</p>
<p>Greece has multibillion-dollar plans to rebuild much of
Athens before 1996, the 100th anniversary of the modern
Olympics, in hopes that the capital will be the site of the
Games that year.</p>
<p>Among the major projects would be a new international
airport, two underground-railway lines and the completion of
two main roads.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding those possible attractions, Olympic
organizers will need a lot of convincing: Greece is broke and
emerging from a long political crisis; and Athens, one of the
world's most polluted capitals, suffers from traffic
congestion and a poor telephone system.</p>
<p>Greece hopes the emotional argument for staging the
Olympics in the country where they originated 2,700 years ago
will be too powerful to resist.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Radicals opposed to the expansion of Tokyo's new
international airport are believed to have set fire to 32
cars at a parking lot near the airport yesterday, police
said. Most of the cars belonged to travelers using the
airport. . . . Scotland's Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St.
Andrews has made Jack Nicklaus an honorary member. He joins
seven other honorary members, including fellow Americans
Arnold Palmer and Gene Sarazen.</p>
