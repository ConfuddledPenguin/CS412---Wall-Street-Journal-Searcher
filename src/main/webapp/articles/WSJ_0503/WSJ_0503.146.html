	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- Sticking close to an outline spelled out by Bonn,
the two Germanys agreed to a plan for merging their economies
by this summer.
   Besides setting terms for introducing the powerful West
German mark into the East on July 2, the agreement gives the
East German government a badly needed political boost on the
eve of that nation's local elections, set for Sunday. Both
sides wanted to hash out a deal in time for the vote, to give
East Germans confidence that the costs of unity won't fall
unfairly onto their shoulders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But while East and West German officials touted the
agreement as a solid compromise, it leaves many details
unclear and differs little from the opening offer made by
Bonn last week.</p>
<p>The plan calls for exchanging East German wages, salaries,
and pensions at a favorable 1-to-1 rate, but limits the
amount of personal savings to be swapped on par. In accord
with Bonn's original proposal, most East Germans will be
allowed to exchange 4,000 marks of savings at the 1-to-1 rate
($2,380.80). But East Germans 60 years and older will be
allowed to exchange 6,000 marks, while children 14 and under
will be limited to 2,000 marks. All other savings will be
exchanged 2-to-1.</p>
<p>West German officials say 60% of East German savings
accounts have less than 5,000 marks and that this deal would
allow families to split their savings among family members
for maximum effect.</p>
<p>The special terms for the elderly are meant to signal the
West's willingness to cushion the effects of the monetary
union, but only in the case of those who really need help.
East German pensions are about a third of the level of those
in the West, and many East German retirees rely heavily on
their savings to survive. Besides offering the higher
threshold for the 1-to-1 exchange, the agreement specifies
that the East will adopt the West German system of
calculating pensions, a move that will lead to a hike in the
base level of many pensions as well.</p>
<p>But while both sides agreed on the need to protect the
elderly, working out a general exchange rate proved more
difficult. The East Germans initially balked at a 4,000-mark
limit on the 1-to-1 exchange, arguing that this would make
them the paupers in a future united Germany. And in the end,
the rate was determined more by political sentiments than by
sound economic reasoning.</p>
<p>"East Germans have the idea that their work is just as
good as that of their West German cousins, and politically,
it's impossible to contradict that," says an official in
Bonn's Economic Ministry. "But it simply isn't true."</p>
<p>Productivity levels in the East are only one-third of
those in the West, for instance, and many East German
factories are hopelessly outmoded.</p>
<p>Moreover, the East German mark is worth only a fraction of
the West German mark, so any exchange rate even approaching
1-to-1 is considered extremely generous. Black market traders
in East and West Berlin typically exchange the money at a
rate of 6-to-1. Yesterday's agreement sets a new official
exchange rate for East German marks of 2-to-1. Since the
start of this year, the official rate has been 3-to-1.</p>
<p>The agreement, which sets the outlines for a state treaty,
differs only slightly from what the West German government
put forward as its opening negotiating position. In recent
days, West German officials acknowledged that their offer was
near the limits of what they could afford without endangering
the stability of the mark.</p>
<p>These factors, together with the East Germans' own
interest in striking a deal that serves their long-term
interests, made it easier to accept the plan.</p>
<p>To help ease the transition, the two sides have agreed to
exchange East German company debts -- estimated at 260
billion marks -- at a rate of 2-to-1. Exchanging debts 1-to-1
would have forced most East German firms out of business. As
it is, officials on both sides estimate that at least
one-third of all East German companies will quickly go
bankrupt and unemployment could soon reach one million.</p>
<p>The agreement also will allow rents to be exchanged at the
2-to-1 rate and will give East Germans the chance to buy
shares in state-owned enterprises.</p>
<p>The West Germans emphasized that the plan was a
conservative solution, a politically necessary stance. The
powerful West German Bundesbank -- which initially groused
that an overly generous deal would endanger the mark -- has
cautiously signed on to the deal, but mainly because it saw
few options.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank has cautioned that monetary and economic
union, if not carefully structured, could boost West German
inflation and interest rates. In keeping with its role as
defender of a powerful mark, the bank originally put forward
its own plan, which called for an exchange rate closer to
2-to-1.</p>
<p>Some financial analysts note, however, that the final
agreement is closer to the Bundesbank's original blueprint
than many might think.</p>
