	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices remained on the upswing as the
Federal Reserve's latest report on the economy spurred
buying.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its fifth
double-digit gain in the last six sessions by climbing 20.72
to 2689.64. The latest gain was the sharpest over that period
and brought the average's rise so far this week to 44.59
points, or 1.7%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index went up 2.23 to 334.48
in the latest session, while the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index climbed 1.12 to 183.34.</p>
<p>Advancing stocks outnumbered decliners by 864 to 612 on
the Big Board, where activity remained sluggish despite brisk
business in the shares of American General, which put itself
up for sale.</p>
<p>Big Board volume amounted to 141,610,000 shares, with
American General accounting for close to 4% of the total. On
Tuesday, 149,020,000 shares changed hands.</p>
<p>Prices rallied at midday following the release of the
summary of economic conditions in the central bank's 12
districts, which said the economy continued to expand at a
moderate pace last month with "no general upward pressure" on
industrial prices.</p>
<p>"Slow growth and moderate inflation levels -- that's
exactly what investors like to hear," said A.C. Moore,
director of research at Argus Research Corp., who added that
the Fed summary confirmed other evidence of improvement in
the economy.</p>
<p>News that the index of leading indicators rose 0.9% and
factory orders rose 3.8% in March was better than generally
expected. On Tuesday, the April survey from the nation's
purchasing managers signaled a pickup in the manufacturing
sector for the first time since May 1989.</p>
<p>Stocks finished at session highs as the market received a
boost just before the close from some program buying related
to stock-index arbitrage, in which traders sell index-futures
contracts and purchase baskets of stocks in order to lock in
profits from differences in price.</p>
<p>However, the latest weekly survey of investment advisers
by Investors Intelligence indicated that market sentiment and
stock prices aren't moving in the same direction.</p>
<p>As of last Friday, 49.6% of the market letter writers
surveyed had a bearish view on stocks, while 17.1% were
calling for short-term price weakness. The totals were up
from 46.5% and 14.9%, respectively, the previous week.
Meanwhile, just 33.3% of the advisers were bullish, down from
38.6%.</p>
<p>Michael Burke, editor of the survey for Chartcraft Inc.,
New Rochelle, N.Y., said the sharp swing in sentiment stemmed
largely from concerns about rising interest rates and poor
market breadth, or the relationship between advancing and
declining issues.</p>
<p>American General surged 7 1/2 to 47 5/8 in Big Board
composite trading of more than 7.1 million shares in response
to the company's decision to put itself up for sale, which
came in spite of its claim of victory in a proxy fight with
its hostile suitor, Torchmark. In addition, the company more
than doubled its quarterly dividend to 80 cents a share.</p>
<p>Analysts and takeover-stock traders cited several foreign
insurance companies as possible suitors, including France's
Axa-Midi Assurances, Nationale-Nederlanden Group of the
Netherlands and Japan's Nippon Life Insurance, according to
Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Also, Torchmark said
it plans to make another offer. Its earlier bid was $50 a
share.</p>
<p>Shares of several single-country mutual funds also
recorded sharp gains. Taiwan Fund rallied 3 3/8 to 23 5/8,
Korea Fund rose 2 1/2 to 19 1/2, Jakarta Growth Fund gained 1
1/4 to 13 3/8, Mexico Fund advanced 1 1/8 to 13 5/8, Germany
Fund rose 1 1/8 to 14 1/4, New Germany Fund gained 1 3/8 to
14 1/8, and Future Germany Fund added 1 to 15 1/8.</p>
<p>Traders at the U.S. units of Japanese brokerage firms said
Japanese investors, whose buying spurred sharp gains among
shares of the country funds early in the year, remain active
in them. "We don't seem to be doing too much else," said
Thomas Callahan, senior vice president of U.S. equities at
Yamaichi International (America).</p>
<p>Union Carbide fell 1/2 to 18 7/8 on 1.6 million shares.
First Boston downgraded the stock to "hold" from "buy," based
on the company's failure to restructure, and said it should
trade at $16 a share, according to the investor report.</p>
<p>Eastman Kodak added 7/8 to 37 7/8. While the company
reported that its first-quarter net income dropped 6% from
the year-ago level, the latest results exceeded most market
forecasts.</p>
<p>General Motors went up 1/2 to 44 3/4 on 1.6 million shares
amid the release of first-quarter results by its major
subsidiaries. GM's Class E shares, representing its
Electronic Data Systems unit, gained 1/4 to 30 5/8. Its Class
H shares, representing its Hughes Electronics unit, slid 1/8
to 22 1/4.</p>
<p>Ames Department Stores rose 3/8 to 2 7/8 on 2.6 million
shares. A federal bankruptcy judge granted the company
interim approval to obtain $25 million in financing and hire
Stephen L. Pistner as its chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Rorer Group tumbled 5 1/4 to 64 1/2 in advance of a Friday
deadline for tendering the stock to France's Rhone-Poulenc
under its offer of $78 a share for a 50.1% stake, the first
step in a merger between the two companies.</p>
<p>Halliburton advanced 7/8 to 44 1/8 after reporting that
its first-quarter earnings from operations went up 192% from
the year-earlier level. Schlumberger, another oil
field-services concern, tacked on 3/4 to 51 1/2 on 1.3
million shares.</p>
<p>Control Data declined 1/2 to 18 3/8. The company said it
isn't comfortable with analysts' 1990 earnings estimates
"above the midportion" of a range of $1 to $1.50 a share.</p>
<p>Xerox dropped 1 1/4 to 46 3/4 amid talk that the company,
which took a first-quarter charge of $375 million on its
investment in VMS Realty Partners, may cut its dividend. The
company denied the rumors.</p>
<p>Fleet/Norstar Financial Group dropped 1/2 to 18 3/4 on
speculation that the bank holding company will report today
that nonperforming loans will increase to $1 billion as of
March 31 from $400 million at the end of 1989. The company
earlier had estimated that nonperforming loans would increase
to $600 million.</p>
<p>Smith Corona skidded 7/8 to 7. Merrill Lynch lowered the
stock's long-term investment rating and reduced its earnings
estimate for the fiscal year beginning July 1, according to
the investor report.</p>
<p>Windmere rose 1 to 6 7/8. R. Jerry Falkner, director of
research at Gulfstream Financial Associates, recommended the
issue as "very oversold" in The Wall Street Journal's monthly
stock-selection feature, "Investment Dartboard."</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.91
to 344.23. Volume totaled 11,710,000 shares compared with
10,640,000 Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ply-Gem Industries gained 1/4 to 7 1/2 after its board
approved the repurchase of as many as 500,000 shares, or
about 4.8% of its shares outstanding. Separately, the company
posted a first-quarter loss compared with a year-ago profit.</p>
