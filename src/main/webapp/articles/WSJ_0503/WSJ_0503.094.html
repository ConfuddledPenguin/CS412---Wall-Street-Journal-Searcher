	<p class="article-leader">The U.S. is Japan's best customer, so it's not surprising
that the Japanese for many years avoided overt criticism of
Uncle Sam. But the Oriental patience gradually eroded and, in
the past year or so, there have been books, articles and
public proclamations from Tokyo that the U.S. should stop
blaming Japan for its trouble and clean up its own house.
   These criticisms have gotten farther than they might have
in chauvinistic America because Americans have begun to feel
that the Japanese do almost everything right. New ideas may
come from the U.S. but Japan knows how to convert them into
profitable products. At the time we were becoming accustomed
to 4% to 5% inflation, which would double prices in 15 years
or so, Japan was trudging along with price increases
averaging 1% or so.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Suddenly it has become apparent that the Japanese are
human beings after all. By the end of 1987, after a great
deal of manipulation by the U.S., Japan and other nations,
the dollar had plunged to 120 yen. A strong currency is often
viewed as an indicator of a strong economy, but Japan didn't
like this situation. Either Americans would have to be
persuaded to pay more for Toyotas and Hondas or they would
buy fewer of them -- or Japan would have to cut its prices to
keep market share.</p>
<p>Japan mainly opted to cut prices, so profits declined.
Japan also decided to weaken the yen in the standard way: by
inflating the economy. The solution worked the way any
Economics 101 student would tell you it would work. The yen
has dropped and may go lower. Japan, whose wholesale prices
dropped every year from 1984 through 1988, has had
substantial price increases since then.</p>
<p>The inflation has been most spectacular in land. Milton
Friedman, the Nobel economist, talking to Oppenheimer & Co.
clients earlier this year, noted that the value of the land
in Tokyo is now equal to the value of all the land in the
U.S. In 1946, Bank of America bought a house for the manager
of its Tokyo branch, paying about $40,000. Recently the bank,
looking around for assets to sell, found that the house was
now worth $40 million -- and sold it.</p>
<p>Japan may not allow its inflation to get out of hand. The
Bank of Japan has had a change in management, and the new
people seem determined to keep prices in check. At any rate,
despite predictable political objections, the bank has been
maneuvering increases in interest rates.</p>
<p>Higher interest rates aren't welcome in a country that has
grown on the basis of cheap credit. But at least some
Japanese seem to recognize that this is something they have
done to themselves, not a punishment inflicted by foreigners.</p>
<p>Since fooling around with exchange rates was the main
cause of Japan's troubles, it might be hoped that the
Japanese in the future will forgo such foolishness. But
that's a lot to hope. The U.S. still fools around with
exchange rates, although the effectiveness of such actions is
at least controversial. The U.S. "sterilizes" its
intervention, offsetting inflationary effects by buying or
selling securities in the domestic market.</p>
<p>To the extent that there is a significant effect, it's
probably more psychological than real. If the intervention
doesn't achieve its aim, the market knows the U.S. government
probably will try again, silly as such action may be. Anyway,
the market isn't likely to try to thwart what it perceives as
the government's wishes.</p>
<p>Several people recently, however, have questioned whether
the U.S. is playing this game by the rules -- its own rules,
that is. Anna J. Schwartz, in a paper for the Shadow Open
Market Committee in March, noted that Congress in 1934
empowered the Treasury to deal in foreign currencies to
"stabilize" exchange rates.</p>
<p>Most of the funds the Treasury was given were taken over
by the International Monetary Fund after World War II. That
left the Treasury with limited sums to play around with, so
the Treasury enlisted the Federal Reserve as a player.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the Fed's participation is at best
questionable. A number of Fed officials aren't happy about
it, but the game goes on. The Federal Reserve now
"warehouses" foreign currencies for the Treasury, in effect
making no-interest loans to the Treasury. At best this
operation distracts Fed officials from their own problems,
such as persistent U.S. inflation.</p>
<p>Even if this operation is necessary, Mrs. Schwartz argues
that the Treasury and the Fed should at least ask Congress
for authority. But the Fed, which has the unique ability to
create its own money, simply goes on helping the Treasury
out.</p>
<p>So both the U.S. and Japan are having trouble getting
their acts together. In the circumstances it seems wise that
the Bush administration has decided not to condemn Japan this
year under the so-called Super 301 provision of the trade
law. The failure to include Japan this time didn't attract
many complaints from Congress, so maybe this punitive law is
losing some of its support. Maybe American politicians are
learning.</p>
<p>Maybe Japanese politicians are learning, too. They are
concerned about inflation, and they are taking some steps to
open their markets; maybe they're learning that more
competition tends to hold down prices.</p>
<p>Japan, it's apparent, has done some things wrong. It's in
our interest, and theirs, for both of us to stop
finger-pointing and deal with our own problems.</p>
