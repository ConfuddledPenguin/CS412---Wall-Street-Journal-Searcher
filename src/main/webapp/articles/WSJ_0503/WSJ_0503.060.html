	<p class="article-leader">William E. Simon's thrift venture sold a major stake in
HonFed Bank, Hawaii's largest thrift, marking an unusual vote
of confidence for the troubled industry from an unusual
source.
   The investor, the Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate, a
wealthy Hawaiian educational trust and landowner, agreed to
invest $50 million in HonFed, which has assets of $3.2
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Simon, Treasury Secretary from 1974 to 1977, and his
partners paid $17 million to acquire control of the
institution in 1986 as part of a government-supervised
transaction.</p>
<p>HonFed has been profitable recently, but, like hundreds of
thrifts around the country, it has been scrambling to raise
funds to comply with new federal capital requirements.</p>
<p>At Dec. 31, HonFed had an estimated $24.5 million tangible
capital deficit and needed about $72 million in new funds to
meet federal regulations. The infusion is significant because
it is believed to be the first successful capital-raising
effort by an ongoing thrift since the new capital rules went
into effect in December.</p>
<p>Still, the participation of what is commonly referred to
as the Bishop Estate, established in 1884 by the last
descendant of Hawaii's 19th century conquering King
Kamehameha I, is a two-edged sword for Mr. Simon and his
partners.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the money combined with proceeds from
pending asset sales, may bring HonFed into compliance with
the key federal tangible capital test as soon as June 30,
when the now definitive agreement is expected to be
completed, officials said. That also is expected be an
impetus to HonFed's further growth, which has been
complicated lately by its lack of capital.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the investment also will cut into the
Simon group's own return on equity investment in HonFed,
which last year reached a heady 47%. Terms of the Bishop
Estate investment weren't disclosed, although officials said
that the new equity investors won't have any voting rights.</p>
<p>The $50 million infusion and planned asset sales also
replace a highly touted $100 million public preferred stock
offering that HonFed proposed last fall and that officials
said they would cancel. Some observers considered that
development somewhat embarrassing to Mr. Simon and his
investment bankers for the proposed offering, Smith Barney,
Harris Upham & Co.</p>
<p>Following his service at the Treasury, Mr. Simon became
something of a Wall Street darling, amassing an estimated
$200 million fortune from well-timed leveraged buy-outs of
such concerns as Gibson Greeting Cards and other ventures.</p>
<p>Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., thrift analyst, said he
figures that the terms of a private transaction such as that
with Bishop Estate were less favorable to the Simon group
than under a public offering. Nonetheless, he said that such
private transactions probably would become the last best hope
for capital-shy thrifts because of continuing public jitters
about the sick industry.</p>
<p>"We believed that this transaction could be done more
efficiently and with a very strong local partner that we
knew," said Gerald Parsky, a Los Angeles lawyer and a partner
in Mr. Simon's WSGP International, the Los Angeles-based
merchant bank that serves as the parent company for the
group's myriad financial ventures.</p>
<p>The Bishop Estate, for instance, invested in the Simon
group's recent purchase and sale of First Interstate Bank of
Hawaii, a transaction that allowed participants to pocket an
estimated $20 million profit on a one-year investment of
about $15 million.</p>
<p>In a statement, the estate's trustees called its latest
venture "an excellent investment opportunity with attractive
return potential." The Bishop Estate oversees a private
school for students of Hawaiian ancestry and is the islands'
largest private landowner with about 338,000 acres, equal to
about 8% of the state.</p>
<p>Mr. Simon couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>HonFed reported 1989 profit of $8 million, down from $10.2
million in 1988, although fourth-quarter earnings rose to
$3.3 million from $1.2 million a year earlier. The
institution has about doubled in size since the Simon group
bought in, although last month it chose not to proceed with a
planned acquisition of 18 Hawaiian branches from First
Nationwide Bank because of capital concerns.</p>
<p>HonFed is just one of three major thrifts that the Simon
group controls, and from a capital position, has been the
worst off. The others include Western Federal Saving & Loan
Association of Marina Del Rey, Calif., and Southern
California Savings & Loan Association, Beverly Hills.</p>
<p>The $4.8 billion-asset Western Federal is generally
healthy; Southern California Savings, with about $2.3 billion
in assets, needs to raise about $35 million. Mr. Parsky said
Southern California Savings should be in compliance late next
year.</p>
<p>Despite thrift assets currently totaling $10.5 billion,
the Simon group has been relatively quiet on the
thrift-acquisition front in recent months. Some officials
said the group remains committed to expanding itself,
however, and sees increasing opportunities as the government
steps up sales of insolvent thrifts.</p>
