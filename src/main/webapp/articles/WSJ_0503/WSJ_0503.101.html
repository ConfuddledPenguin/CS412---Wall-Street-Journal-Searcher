	<p class="article-leader">Ply Gem Industries Inc. reported a first-quarter net loss
of $1.7 million, or 16 cents a share, reflecting the highly
seasonal business of SNE Enterprises, acquired by Ply Gem in
March 1989.
   The New York-based manufacturer of home improvement
products earned $2.2 million, or 20 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue increased 23% to $121.3 million, from $98.3
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ply Gem said its financial condition remains strong. The
company said SNE normally posts a large first-quarter loss
because of its seasonal window-and-door product line. Ply Gem
added that an increasingly higher percentage of its sales and
earnings will occur during the busy spring and summer
remodeling periods.</p>
<p>The company also authorized the purchase of as many as
500,000 shares of Ply Gem stock over an unspecified period.
The company currently has 10.5 million common shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Ply Gem closed at $7.50, up 25 cents.</p>
