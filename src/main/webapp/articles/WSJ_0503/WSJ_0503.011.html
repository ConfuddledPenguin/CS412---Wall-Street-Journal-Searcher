	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Grow Group Inc. said the company and two of
its executives settled charges stemming from a 1988 chemical
fire at its Commerce, Calif., facility.
   The fire released a cloud of chlorine gas over the
company's warehouse, forcing authorities to evacuate some
25,000 residents in surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it would incur a $3.8 million charge in
its fiscal third quarter ended March 31 because of the
settlement and other related matters concerning its consumer
and professional products group. Grow Group reported a loss
of $2,263,000 in the March 1989 quarter.</p>
<p>Under terms of the settlement, the company said it pleaded
no contest to one felony and three misdemeanor charges of
violations of the California Hazardous Waste Control Act,
agreeing to pay a fine of $400,000.</p>
<p>The company also agreed to contribute $350,000 to fund
academic scholarships at five high schools in the Commerce
area as restitution for the costs incurred by Los Angeles
County agencies and municipalities.</p>
<p>Grow Group also agreed to be placed on summary probation
for three years.</p>
<p>Two executives in the company's consumer and professional
products group pleaded "no contest" to four misdemeanor
charges.</p>
