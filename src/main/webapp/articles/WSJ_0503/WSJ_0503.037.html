	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Concerned about Soviet importers not paying their
bills, Japanese companies are making the first moves to claim
export insurance on trade with the Soviet Union.
   Major trading houses, including C. Itoh & Co., Mitsui &
Co., Mitsubishi Corp. and Nissho Iwai Co., confirmed they
have submitted notices informing the government that some
Soviet trading partners are delaying payment on import
contracts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As previously reported, many Soviet organizations are
having difficulties honoring trade commitments in a timely
fashion. Dozens of U.S. and European companies have
complained in recent months about nonpayment from Soviet
customers, and some companies have halted deliveries pending
payment. Some analysts estimate the unpaid bills total as
much as $500 million.</p>
<p>The recent delay in payments arises in part from a
sweeping decentralization of Soviet foreign trade this past
year, Japanese company officials said. Numerous Soviet
trading organizations have sprouted since the reform, but
some lack foreign currency to pay their bills on time. And
Soviet banks are reluctant to bail them out, as they have in
the past. Trading house officials say Soviet steel-trading
organizations, in particular, have been asking Japan to
extend payment deadlines.</p>
<p>U.S. companies, which also have reported difficulty
getting paid by the Soviets, aren't covered by official
export insurance as many of their Japanese and European
counterparts are for Soviet trade. So far, the payment delays
don't seem to have brought significant European claims to
insurers. A spokesman for Britain's Export Credit Guaranty
Department said "things haven't reached the claims stage
yet."</p>
<p>An official for C. Itoh, commenting on the Soviet payment
problem, said, "Trade isn't going smoothly." The company's
trade with the Soviet Union last year reached about $300
million. "The {contract} settlements are being extended." The
company recently informed the government about a delay in
payment for chemical products, the official said.</p>
<p>Japan's giant trading houses said they don't intend to cut
exports immediately, even though the delayed payments may
total as much as $200 million. There are no reports so far of
Japanese companies halting deliveries, but trading company
officials said exports could be affected if delays in Soviet
payments continue.</p>
<p>Notification of payments problems routinely goes to the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry if insured
export contracts aren't settled for more than two months. The
notice is a preliminary step in claiming insurance. The next
step would be for MITI to begin investigating to determine if
payment is required.</p>
<p>MITI's international trade-insurance division wouldn't
confirm receiving notifications. An official also denied a
Japanese press report that the ministry itself urged the
companies to submit the notifications. But he said that if
notifications involving a specific area increase, the
government will investigate.</p>
<p>Japanese-Soviet trade isn't large, edging up only 3.2% in
1989 from a year earlier, to $6.09 billion. Japan's exports
to the Soviet Union were $3.08 billion in 1989, down slightly
from $3.13 billion in 1988.</p>
<p>Analysts said that Japanese trading houses are keeping a
low profile on the problem, in part because they don't want
to damage trade prospects. "They're being cautious," said
Kazuko Motomura, an official with the Institute for Soviet
and East European Economic Studies, a research organization
set up by traders who do business with Eastern Europe. "But
they're also thinking about the promising possibilities of
the market in the future."</p>
<p>Officials with Marubeni Co. and Sumitomo Corp., for
example, acknowledged that there was a general move toward
submitting notices but declined to say if further actions are
under way.</p>
<p>But officials at other houses stressed that the
notifications were purely routine. "We think that the Soviet
Union will definitely make the payment," said Tetsuya Onishi,
an official in Nissho Iwai's public relations division.
Though Nissho Iwai received payments for the bulk of its
annual $400 million exports, it filed a notice for steel and
chemical products, Mr. Onishi said. The company still intends
to participate in a consortium that is involved in a 38
billion yen ($239.4 million) project to build three
compressor plants in the Soviet Union, he added.</p>
