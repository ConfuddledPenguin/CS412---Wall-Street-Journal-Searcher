	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck & Co. plans to yank furniture
out of most of its department stores and open more than 200
free-standing furniture outlets in an effort to revive its
unprofitable business.
   "We will be pulling out of the vast majority" of Sears
stores over the next several years, said Jerry A. Hand, the
company's vice president of home fashions. The company will
offer an expanded furniture selection in the remaining Sears
stores, he added.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The nation's largest retailer is counting on the new
format, which features a wider selection of mostly name-brand
goods at higher prices than Sears charges for its traditional
private-label lineup, to revive its stagnant, $1
billion-a-year furniture business. Sears currently commands
the leading share of the fragmented U.S. furniture business
-- roughly 4% of the $28 billion market. But Mr. Hand said
Sears sells furniture through too many small departments to
compete effectively.</p>
<p>By moving furniture out of its big stores, Sears also will
free up space to expand such other departments as women's,
men's and children's clothing, and tools and lawn equipment.
Sears is attempting to broaden its appeal to shoppers and
improve its financial results with more eye-catching displays
and more name-brand goods that it is selling alongside its
house brands.</p>
<p>But shipping furniture off to free-standing stores is
risky because the stores can no longer count on shoppers to
wander in from other Sears departments. "In a free-standing
store, you have to be able to drive your own traffic with a
good merchandise assortment and good promotion to get people
to come to your store," said Norman McMillan, a retail
consultant in Chicago. "It isn't automatic anymore."</p>
<p>Mr. Hand said results of a prototype Homelife store that
opened in Madison, Wis., last September indicate the new
free-standing format can operate profitably. "We're currently
doubling our market share," he said.</p>
<p>The new Homelife stores range in size from 20,000 to
40,000 square feet, or as much as five times as large as the
typical, cluttered Sears furniture department. That means
Sears now has enough space to arrange its living room, dining
room and bedroom items in attractive room settings, separated
by fake walls and arches that resemble a decorator showroom.
Mr. Hand hopes the displays will spur multiple purchases.</p>
<p>The goods themselves are more fashionable too. Much of the
new merchandise is contemporary or traditional in style,
rather than the "country" look that dominates Sears furniture
departments today.</p>
<p>The new national brands -- including American Drew,
Barcalounger, Broyhill, Sauder and Schnadig -- also are
priced 20% to 25% higher than the private-label Sears items.</p>
<p>"The taste level of our customer and the non-Sears
customer is higher than what we've been selling," Mr. Hand
said. "The customer wants to buy better goods."</p>
