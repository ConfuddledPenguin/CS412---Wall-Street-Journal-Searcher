	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Hillsdown Holdings PLC said it plans to acquire
a controlling stake in a food-processing company, Canada
Packers Inc., for a combination of cash and assets with an
indicated value of about 606 million Canadian dollars (US$521
million).
   The combined company will be a formidable force in the
Canadian food industry with annual revenue of about C$4
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the proposal, Hillsdown said its Canadian operation,
Maple Leaf Mills, will be transferred to Canada Packers in
exchange for about 29.5 million shares of newly issued Canada
Packers shares.</p>
<p>Hillsdown will also offer to acquire about 7.2 million
Canada Packers shares, or about 20% of the existing shares,
at C$16.50 a share.</p>
<p>Following the transaction, Hillsdown, a major British
food-processing company, would hold 56% of the new, larger
company, which would continue to trade and operate under the
Canada Packers name.</p>
<p>Canada Packers is Canada's largest food processor, with
annual sales of about C$3.3 billion. The company put itself
on the block last October when the principal shareholder, the
MacLean family of Toronto, said it would be interested in
selling its 30% stake in the company if a bid was made for
all the company's shares.</p>
<p>The company's stock languished from C$20.50 -- after the
company announced it was looking for a buyer -- to a low of
C$13.25 Thursday as no interested bidders appeared. On the
Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, the stock gained 50 Canadian
cents to close at C$13.75.</p>
<p>Analysts said the lukewarm reaction by investors reflects
the fact that only 20% of the outstanding shares will be
accepted under Hillsdown's offer.</p>
<p>Adam Zimmerman, chairman and chief executive officer of
Noranda Forest Inc. and a director of Canada Packers,
attributed the small stock increase to weak market
conditions. (The Toronto Composite 300 Index fell 55 points
Friday.)</p>
<p>Mr. Zimmerman, who heads an independent directors'
committee established to solicit bids, said he is pleased
with the proposal. "We've worked at it for six months," he
said. "It was the one complete offer and it was certainly the
best."</p>
<p>John Jackson, vice chairman of Hillsdown, said the company
has been considering for some years having a subsidiary
traded on a North American stock exchange. "We very much see
this as a base for expansion into North America generally,"
he said.</p>
<p>"On the basis of {Canada Packers'} current earning
numbers, it's a good offer," said William Chisholm, a
consumer products analyst with Loewen Ondaatje McCutcheon &
Company Ltd. "Shareholders are ending up with a company
that's going to be more interesting than it is right now."</p>
<p>Mr. Chisholm said he expects the shares to appreciate in
value following the transaction. He said the deal represents
good value for shareholders and said the resulting company
will be less reliant on its red-meat operations.</p>
<p>Declining demand and falling prices for beef have been
hurting the company's profit level.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended Dec. 23, Canada Packers reported
a 48% decline in net income to C$12.7 million, or 35 Canadian
cents a share, from C$24.5 million or 67 Canadian cents.
Revenue declined by 4% to C$2.37 billion from C$2.47 billion.</p>
<p>Hillsdown's Maple Leaf Mills unit is the largest
flour-milling company in Canada and reported 1989 revenue of
C$741 million.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to approval by Canada Packers
and Hillsdown shareholders, as well by regulatory
authorities.</p>
<p>The MacLean family said it will vote its 10.2 million
shares in favor of the transaction and tender its shares to
the cash bid. Any shares tendered will be bought up on a
pro-rata basis.</p>
