	<p class="article-leader">Dr. E. Fuller Torrey's March 29 editorial-page article
"Community Mental Health Policy -- Tennis, Anyone?" makes
some daunting assertions. Conveniently ignoring the severe
federal budget cuts in community mental-health services in
the 1980s, Dr. Torrey states that the monumental and complex
problem of the homeless mentally ill can be laid on the
shoulders of community mental-health centers (CMHCs). On what
does he base this claim? He implies that among the 2,310
centers in the U.S. and its territories, there is widespread
failure to provide the services that were intended, and
points to the Construction Act grant program as an
illustration of the "fact."
   He fails to mention that of the 575 Construction Act
grantees, he has to date presented evidence of noncompliance
in exactly nine. Of these nine, all but one are, in fact,
hospitals. This a far cry from his claim that 95% of
Construction Act grantees are out of compliance. This past
March 22, Rep. Ted Weiss (D., N.Y.) requested an audit of the
Construction Grant program by the General Accounting Office.
The National Council of Community Mental Health Centers has
pledged its strong support for the GAO audit, as we are eager
to see any centers that may be out of compliance brought into
compliance and any funds misused redirected to the thousands
of CMHCs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Community mental-health providers struggle to serve an
increasing patient load with inadequate and shrinking
resources. Such inadequate resources have devastating effects
on the availability of services for low-income people. A 1988
survey by the National Council found that 74% of a typical
agency's funding comes from public programs (Medicaid, the
federal Alcohol and Drug Abuse Block Grant, and state and
local funds), while only 10% comes from third-party payers,
9% from those clients who can afford to pay fees for
services, and 7% from charitable contributions and other
sources.</p>
<p>This fiscal picture is hardly indicative of a system that
is not working to provide "a reasonable volume of services to
persons unable to pay." In addition, federal regulations
concerning CMHC Construction Act grantees prohibit those
grantees from discriminating in service provision on the
basis of a client's diagnosis. By insisting that CMHCs give
those with serious mental illness priority over all other
patient groups, Dr. Torrey is suggesting that the providers
ignore the requirements of the many public programs that fund
them and discriminate against substance abusers, children
with emotional disturbances, the elderly, people with AIDS,
victims of domestic violence and violent crime, and other
people who desperately need mental-health services but would
not be diagnosed as seriously mentally ill.</p>
<p>A CMHC that (primarily) served only the seriously mentally
ill while accepting several types of funding would be in
clear violation of a number of federal and state programs. In
responding to this very issue, Dr. Torrey told reporters at a
March 23 news conference, "None of us {Dr. Torrey, Public
Citizen and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill} have
said that they {CMHCs} were only designed to service the
seriously mentally ill." That statement is in direct
contradiction to the implication of his Journal article.</p>
<p>CMHCs fully support efforts to ensure that the limited
public funds allocated for mental-health services are used
properly. However, we object to Dr. Torrey's efforts to
tarnish the reputation of 2,310 community providers based on
evidence he collected concerning eight hospitals and one
center. Such a campaign will have its most devastating impact
on the mentally ill clients whom he claims to be
representing.</p>

<p>Having served on the board of the Kenneth W. Young Centers
for the past five years, including two years as chairman, I
protest Dr. Torrey's article. He presents only one piece of
his research, choosing not to comment on the hundreds of
community centers that are not only in compliance with all
federal and local regulations, but continuously provide
needed services to people within their catchment areas at
fees far below those charged by private practitioners.</p>
<p>I concur with Dr. Torrey's conclusion that the federal
government at times is deficient in providing oversight for
programs it authorizes, but reporting on that problem by
seeming to condemn an entire service field is misleading,
unfair and unprofessional.</p>
