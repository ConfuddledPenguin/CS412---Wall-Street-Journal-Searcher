	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- CrossLand Savings reported a $136.5 million
first-quarter net loss and a doubling of problem assets,
increasing its already severe capital problems.
   The results reflect a $100 million provision for possible
losses on problem loans. The bank said it felt the provision
was appropriate "after management's regular evaluation of
CrossLand's loan portfolio and after preliminary discussions
with the {Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.} relating to its
ongoing examination" of the bank.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To alleviate its capital shortage, which could lead to
regulatory sanctions, CrossLand proposed a recapitalization
plan that asks preferred shareholders for a major concession.
Under terms of the plan, the bank's total $363 million of
Series A and Series B preferred stock would be converted to
common stock. Unlike the preferred, the common stock doesn't
pay a dividend and would reduce the preferred holders'
standing as creditors.</p>
<p>With $13.2 billion of assets, CrossLand is the largest
savings bank in New York and one of the largest in the U.S.
CrossLand said it hasn't yet determined the conversion ratios
for each of the two series. But it said that the move is
aimed at qualifying the equity that is tied up in the
preferred as core capital and tangible capital, two critical
measures of the health of a savings bank.</p>
<p>CrossLand said that the plan wouldn't help it meet,
however, the FDIC's requirements for leverage capital. These
require a bank to maintain tangible capital -- capital
excluding good will -- of at least 4% of its assets as they
are adjusted for risk.</p>
<p>Late last month, a plan to recapitalize CrossLand Savings
collapsed when the Pritzker family of Chicago, which with a
partner would have taken a controlling stake in the bank in
return for a capital infusion, decided to withdraw from the
transaction. The Pritzkers didn't say why they withdrew; the
bank said, however, that it would propose a new plan as
quickly as possible.</p>
<p>CrossLand's problem is that under the thrift-reform
legislation Congress passed last August, its two series of
cumulative preferred don't qualify as core capital. Because
the preferred shares are cumulative -- if dividends are
missed, they accumulate and must be paid before any dividends
on common are paid -- the preferred is viewed by regulators
as debt rather than equity.</p>
<p>CrossLand's first-period loss equaled $10.61 a share,
compared with net income of $11.8 million, or 11 cents a
share, in the year-earlier period. The loan-loss provision a
year earlier was $7.9 million.</p>
<p>"During this quarter, CrossLand experienced a sharp
increase in loan delinquencies and adversely classified
assets," the bank said.</p>
<p>Delinquent loans -- those 90 or more days past due -- plus
real estate on which the bank has foreclosed, climbed to
$455.5 million as of March 31 from $218.4 million on March
31, 1989, and from $288 million at year's end. These loans
and real estate as a percentage of total assets grew to 3.44%
from 1.40% a year earlier and 2.04% at year's end.</p>
<p>Income from interest on loans before provision for
possible loan losses fell 24% to $31.7 million from $41.8
million in 1989's fourth quarter for three reasons: CrossLand
has pared interest-earning assets by $2.1 billion in the past
nine months in keeping with its business plan; the bank has
seen a substantial increase in nonperforming assets; and its
real-estate investments have risen.</p>
<p>Income from real-estate investments is recorded under
other operating income, which rose 49% in the first quarter
to $34.1 million from $22.8 million in the year-earlier
period, CrossLand reported.</p>
<p>The bank's interest-rate spread -- the difference between
what it pays for funds and what it takes in on loans --
narrowed to 1.77% on March 31, 1990, from 2.00% on March 31,
1989, but widened from 1.67% at the end of 1989.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
CrossLand common shares fell 12.5 cents to $1.75.</p>
