	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- Boeing Co. said the Federal Aviation
Administration certified its 757 and 767 twin-jets for
additional extended-range services.
   The approvals allow the Boeing jetliners to fly more
direct routes on long overwater trips or over undeveloped
land areas, saving on fuel and flight times. The
certifications are for the 757-200 and 767-200 and -300
jetliners, with specific engine combinations.</p>
