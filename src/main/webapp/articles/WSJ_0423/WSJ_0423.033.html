	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Nigerian government, which yesterday put
down a military coup attempt, told its bank creditors Friday
that it will unilaterally cut interest payments on $5.4
billion of foreign debt from May 1.
   The payments move and the military revolt aren't directly
related, but growing internal unrest and the decision to
slash interest expenses come after recent drops of more than
10% in international prices for oil, which accounts for about
90% of Nigeria's export revenues.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The attempted coup, which began early yesterday, was
apparently put down after several hours of fighting for
control of the capital, Lagos. Troops loyal to the president,
Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, fought with renegade soldiers seeking
to break up Nigeria's federation of states and end Moslem
domination.</p>
<p>The coup attempt only adds uncertainty to Nigeria's
troubled financial situation. While bankers now know Nigeria
intends to cut interest payments, they aren't sure what rate
it is prepared to pay. The Nigerian central bank, which
telexed the country's intentions to banks last week, didn't
specify what rate it would use to determine "the reduced
rate" at which interest payments will be made.</p>
<p>In talks in London last month with foreign creditor banks,
Nigerian officials apparently requested that interest
payments be set at 3% annually for 30 years on $5.4 billion
of foreign bank debt. Bankers rejected this request. Nigeria
pays about 10% on its foreign bank debt.</p>
<p>According to news agency reports, the debt immediately
affected by the move is $2.4 billion in trade credits that
require monthly interest payments. Nigeria also makes
quarterly payments on $3 billion of medium-term commercial
bank credit, which won't be affected until early July.</p>
<p>Although Nigeria hasn't specifically said so, many
analysts say the recent fall in oil prices is an important
reason for the country's interest-payment cut. The price drop
"is a very important factor if Nigeria is going to pay its
overseas debts," said Avinash Persaud, monetary economist at
UBS Phillips & Drew in London</p>
<p>Nigeria's main crude-oil export, so-called Bonny Light, is
selling for about $16.15 a barrel, down almost $2 from a
month ago. Its current crude production is estimated around
1.8 million barrels a day, about 200,000 barrels a day higher
than the quota set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.</p>
<p>According to the World Bank, Nigeria had $29.42 billion of
foreign debt at the end of 1988. Of this, $11.4 billion is
owed to private creditors, with the balance owed to
governments and multilateral agencies such as the World Bank.
About half of the private debt is owed to banks, with the
balance consisting of suppliers' credits.</p>
<p>European and Mideast banks are the biggest private lenders
to Nigeria, while U.S. banks account for less than one-tenth
of private bank lending.</p>
