	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The sagging bond market is bracing for several
heavy blows that are likely to drive down prices and boost
yields even further over the next few weeks, investment
managers and economists predict.
   Money managers now are warier about bonds than at any time
since last summer, according to a new survey of 51
fixed-income investment managers by C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell Inc. Many strategists are waiting for government
bond yields, now about 8.9%, to surge to 9% or 9 1/4% before
they consider buying again later this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Inflation fears, concerns about massive government
borrowing in early May and worries about higher interest
rates abroad have investors especially on edge. Moreover,
many Japanese institutions have been hit hard by plummeting
Tokyo stock and bond prices this year. Many strategists
predict the Japanese won't buy nearly as much as usual of the
$30 billion of U.S. Treasury notes and bonds to be sold by
the government next month. Some even fear the Japanese will
sell more of their U.S. bonds soon and move their money back
into Japanese government bonds.</p>
<p>Moreover, many economists expect additional signs this
week and next of higher inflation and stronger economic
growth. "Near-term, we see major problems with the market,"
says Thomas Slefinger, a portfolio manager at Van Kampen
Merritt, an investment firm based in Lisle, Ill. "I think
we're going to see higher interest rates over the next
month."</p>
<p>Later this year, bonds will look much more attractive, Mr.
Slefinger and many other managers predict. In the meantime,
Mr. Selfinger advises: "The best thing to do is sit on the
sidelines and just watch. We don't see any rush or urgency to
buy right now."</p>
<p>Prices of long-term government bonds tumbled 3 1/2 points,
or $35 for each $1,000 face amount, last week. That included
a one-point drop Friday. Bond yields surged more than
one-third of a percentage point, an exceptionally large jump
for a single week, hitting their highest levels in nearly a
year. Technical analysts say government bond yields now have
pierced important resistance levels, and that this represents
yet another ominous signal.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, even news that usually boosts bond
prices is having no effect. For example, gold and oil prices
have tumbled, which some economists say should represent
solid signals that inflation isn't a major threat. But
investors don't seem to care. When good news is ignored,
"that's a sign of trouble," says Mr. Slefinger.</p>
<p>Some money managers reply there is good reason to ignore
falling oil prices. "I don't really trust the oil price
weakness we're seeing," says Garnett L. Keith, vice chairman
of Prudential Insurance Co. of America. "I see it more as a
blip related to the inner workings of OPEC," the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries. He worries about growing
U.S. dependence on foreign oil, adding: "If I had to guess
the direction of oil prices over the next two- or three-year
period, it's up, not down. And since energy is a big
inflation component, I think that's not going to be helpful."</p>
<p>Inflation fears probably will be fanned again by a
government report Friday on the economy's first-quarter
performance. Many analysts expect an annual growth rate of
about 5 1/2% to 6% in an inflation measure known as the
implicit price deflator. Moreover, the government's April
employment report, to be released in early May, is expected
to show stronger economic growth.</p>
<p>"Over the next month or so, rates may very well back up
some more," says Donald H. Straszheim, chief economist at
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. "The markets' perception is
that inflation is a real problem and the economy is growing
too fast."</p>
<p>Stronger economic growth might even persuade the Federal
Reserve to raise short-term interest rates, several analysts
warn. A few Fed officials say they think inflation already is
too high. But other Fed policymakers appear worried about
signs of fragility in the financial system and less worried
about inflation. Thus, the Fed probably will await further
evidence on the economy and inflation before tightening
credit.</p>
<p>C.J. Lawrence's latest survey shows an unusually large
increase in bearish sentiment lately. Bond managers now are
"the most cautious they have been in eight months," says
Nancy Lazar, senior vice president at C.J. Lawrence.</p>
<p>According to the survey, 27% of the money managers polled
have turned bearish. That was up sharply from 11% in the
previous week. Another 41% in the latest survey said they are
bullish, down sharply from 55% the preceding week. The firm's
overall bullish-bearish sentiment index sank to 5.4 last
week, the lowest reading in about eight months and down
sharply from 6.04 the previous week.</p>
<p>To contrarians, this growing cautiousness may just be a
sign that the bond market's fierce rout finally is nearing an
end. After all, investors were extremely bullish on bonds
late last year, just before bond prices began tumbling. But
C.J. Lawrence analysts say the survey doesn't always work so
well as a contrary indicator. They point to a surge in
bullishness last year that came before a big bull market in
bonds.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, Ed Hyman, C.J. Lawrence's vice
chairman, contends that investor fears about inflation are
greatly exaggerated and that bonds look attractive. "The
economy hasn't been doing what I thought it would be doing,"
Mr. Hyman says. "I'm nervous, but I haven't thrown in the
towel" on bonds.</p>
<p>"I still think the next move in interest rates is more
likely to be down than up," Mr. Hyman says. "I think the
economy is going through a temporary lift in growth, and it
will slow down in the next few months." He also expects that
the dollar will rise in the foreign-exchange markets, and
that government bond yields will drop back down to 8% in six
months.</p>
<p>Inflation worries also are haunting Japanese investors. As
a result, many economists expect Japanese officials to raise
interest rates this spring, in an effort bolstering the yen
and making Japanese rates more competitive with those in the
U.S. "I think the Japanese are likely to push their rates up
once more," says Mr. Straszheim of Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Koji Yoneyama, president and chief executive officer of
Daiwa Securities America Inc. here, says more Japanese
investors are moving their money out of dollar-denominated
investments and into Japanese bonds. The spread between U.S.
and Japanese bond yields has shrunk to only about 1 1/2
percentage points, which Mr. Yoneyama says is "a very small
spread and not big enough to ease currency risk."</p>
<p>Japanese bonds due in 1999 were quoted late Friday at
about 7.3%, compared with 8.93% for comparable U.S. bonds.
Nevertheless, Mr. Yoneyama expects the U.S. dollar to
strengthen and that this should help bolster U.S. bond
prices.</p>
<p>Mr. Straszheim of Merrill Lynch says that although U.S.
rates may rise soon, he expects significantly lower rates
later this year. For example, he predicts Treasury bond
yields will drop back down by year-end to about 8 1/4%.</p>
<p>Ian MacKinnon, senior vice president at Vanguard Group in
Valley Forge, Pa., agrees that last week's bond-market
pessimism is exaggerated. "We are by no means rushing in to
buy, but we think yields are attractive," he says. "We would
be tilting a little bit to the bullish side, but I'd be
reluctant to bet the farm right now."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Capping one of the worst weeks in recent memory, bond
prices fell sharply again and 30-year government bond yields
jumped close to 9%, the highest since May of last year.</p>
<p>Treasury bond prices tumbled one point, or $10 for each
$1,000 face amount, on Friday. That was the sixth consecutive
trading session in which prices dropped.</p>
<p>The government's benchmark 30-year issue was quoted late
Friday at a price of 95 13/32 to yield 8.93%. At the start of
the week, the issue stood at 98 29/32, to yield 8.59%.</p>
<p>The selling spree, largely attributed to growing inflation
fears and worries that Japanese investors won't be big buyers
at the Treasury's quarterly refunding next month, has driven
prices below their previous trading ranges. Traders also were
startled by news Friday afternoon of an unexpectedly huge
$53.3 billion federal budget deficit in March, the widest on
record.</p>
<p>"People are skittish, and the budget deficit provided one
more reason to be bearish," says Robert Chandross, a vice
president and economist at Lloyds Bank in New York.</p>
<p>The Treasury is scheduled to disclose details of its
quarterly financing on May 2. Many analysts expect a package
totaling more than $30 billion and consisting of three-year
notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds.</p>
<p>Rates fell again on short-term Treasury bills. The latest
three-month bills were quoted late Friday at a discount rate
of 7.70%, to yield 7.94%. That compared with a discount rate
of 7.76% Thursday, to yield 8%.</p>
<p>Thus, there now is about a one percentage-point gap
between yields on short-term bills and 30-year bonds. Late
last year, these yields were nearly the same.</p>
<p>In the corporate market, prices of long-term,
investment-grade corporate debt edged lower. However,
intermediate corporate issues ended little changed.</p>
<p>Corporate junk bonds, the high-yield, high-risk securities
with low credit ratings or no ratings at all, were mixed.
Among the big gainers were junk bonds of Supermarkets General
Holdings Inc. Its bonds surged on news that the company's
loss narrowed significantly in the first quarter. Some issues
rose as much as three points.</p>
<p>Municipal bonds were little changed to slightly lower.
Among active issues, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% bonds of 2018 fell 1/4 point to 96 5/8 bid, 96 3/4
offered, to yield 7.48%. Mortgage securities ended 10/32 to
13/32 point lower.</p>
