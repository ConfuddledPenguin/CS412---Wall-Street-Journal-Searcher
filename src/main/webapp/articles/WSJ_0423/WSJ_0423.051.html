	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Columbia Savings & Loan Association sued
Home Insurance Co. of Illinois for rescinding liability
coverage for its officers and directors on April 5, four days
after the thrift announced it was insolvent.
   According to a complaint filed in state court here,
Columbia alleges that the unit of New York-based Home
Insurance Co. acted in "bad faith" by refusing to provide a
defense or coverage for five lawsuits against Columbia and
its officers relating to Columbia's financial problems.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>George T. Scharffenberger, president and chief executive
officer of Ambase Corp., parent of Home Insurance, said he
"didn't know of the suit" and wasn't aware of any details.</p>
<p>Columbia alleges that Home began "a series of improper
efforts" to avoid its obligations "almost immediately" after
Columbia announced substantial losses last October. The $10
million policy was to cover the period from June 30, 1989,
through April 21, 1990, the complaint says; and Columbia paid
premiums of $121,000.</p>
<p>Among the alleged reasons given by Home for rejecting
coverage were that a lawsuit had not been disclosed to it in
time, and that another complaint was based on "pending
litigation" in another court, Columbia said. At one point,
Columbia allegedly was told that one of Home's underwriters
made an "error of judgment" in binding the policy. That, the
complaint charges, was not a proper basis for denying
coverage either.</p>
<p>Columbia seeks unspecified damages for "significant
financial and emotional damage" resulting from the coverage
denials. It also wants a court declaration that cancellation
of the policy was improper and an order barring Home from
denying coverage.</p>
