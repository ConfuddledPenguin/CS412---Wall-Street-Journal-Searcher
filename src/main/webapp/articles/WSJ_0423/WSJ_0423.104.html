	<p class="article-leader">Has the yen finally bottomed out?
   Yes, believe many analysts and traders. But there's one
big caveat: Any rebound in Japan's currency could fall victim
to an official round of interest-rate increases in West
Germany and the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>From mid-February to last Tuesday, when it fell to an
intraday low of 160.15 to the dollar, the yen had plunged
roughly 10% against the dollar and most major Continental
European currencies. Then last week, the yen bounced back
1.1% against the dollar and 1.7% against the mark. That may
not seem overly impressive, but it was enough to spur a
reappraisal of the outlook for the Japanese currency.</p>
<p>The new optimism is based on recent stability in the Tokyo
stock and bond markets, fading apprehension over rising
Japanese inflation, forecasts of a higher Japanese trade
surplus and a growing belief that -- despite some past snubs
-- Washington would like to see a stable Japanese currency.</p>
<p>Still, the yen's recovery is far from guaranteed.</p>
<p>"I prefer the idea that the yen has bottomed out," says
Keiichi Udagawa, chief trader at Bank of Tokyo in New York.
"But the psychology of the market won't change that quickly.
Some people are still obsessed with a weak yen; it's not a
one-way market."</p>
<p>The dollar/yen exchange rate is an especially important
one because of the persistently large U.S. trade deficit with
Japan. A weak yen contributes to that deficit by lowering the
cost of Japanese goods to American consumers while raising
the price of U.S. exports in world markets.</p>
<p>Late on Friday, the dollar stood at 157.45 yen and 1.6875
marks, up from 157.20 yen and 1.6784 marks late Thursday. The
British pound fell to $1.6388 from $1.6455 the day before.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at
157.25 yen, down fron Friday's Tokyo close of 157.60 yen.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at 1.6925 marks.</p>
<p>On Friday, after weakening in Far Eastern trading, the
dollar rebounded in late European activity on short-covering
by dealers who earlier sold the U.S. currency, betting that
it would keep falling. The dollar also received some support
-- especially against the mark -- on news that the Soviet
Union was tightening its economic embargo against Lithuania.</p>
<p>But in afternoon New York trading, the U.S. currency fell
in reaction to a sell-off in the U.S. Treasury market, which
was prompted by reports of a much-larger-than-expected U.S.
budget deficit for March.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, the yen began recovering as traders
took profits from previous dollar advances. Profit-taking
took hold in earnest after the dollar failed to rally
following Wednesday's Commerce Department report that the
U.S. trade deficit for February had shrunk to $6.49 billion
from $9.32 billion in January. It was the smallest monthly
trade gap since December 1983.</p>
<p>The dollar fell on rumors -- which were exaggerated,
analysts say -- that Japanese institutional investors were
dumping U.S. bonds. That, in turn, raised doubts about their
participation in the $30 billion Treasury refunding expected
next month.</p>
<p>In addition, dealers and investors began selling marks and
buying yen, a move that tends to boost the dollar against the
West German currency and weaken it against Japan's. That's
because some traders initially sell marks for dollars and
then sell the dollars for yen.</p>
<p>Since mid-February, the yen had been plagued by plummeting
Japanese stock and bond markets, fears of higher inflation
and deteriorating confidence in Japanese monetary authorities
because of a rare public dispute between the Ministry of
Finance and the central bank over whether to raise interest
rates.</p>
<p>But now, "a lot of the negative elements that gave rise to
the attack on the yen are being reappraised," particularly
the anxiety over accelerating inflation, says John Lipsky, an
international economist at Salomon Brothers International
Ltd. in London.</p>
<p>He contends that while Japanese wages will increase at a
faster rate this year than last, total employee compensation
won't rise as quickly because weaker growth in corporate
profits will translate into less overtime and smaller growth
in bonuses. In addition, there are early indications of
reduced inflation in the new fiscal year that began April 1,
following the one-time higher inflationary effect caused last
year by introduction of a 3% consumption tax. "The domestic
component of inflation has been stable," says Mr. Lipsky.</p>
<p>At the same time, analysts note that inflationary
expectations in the U.S. are rising, particularly after last
week's report that consumer prices in March surged 0.5%.</p>
<p>"The worst-case scenarios for {inflation in} Japan haven't
come to pass, and the best-case scenarios for the U.S. aren't
coming to pass," says David H. Resler, chief economist for
Nomura Securities Co. in New York.</p>
<p>He sees the dollar trading range at 155-160 yen for the
short term before widening to 150-160 yen. "We've established
the near-term peak for the dollar," says Mr. Resler.</p>
<p>The yen should also get a boost from a larger surplus in
Japan's current account, a broad measure of trade in goods
and services plus financial transfers, analysts say. Salomon
Brothers estimates that the current-account surplus for the
year ended in March fell to $47 billion from $78 billion in
the previous year. But the company expects the surplus to
rise moderately this fiscal year.</p>
<p>Noting that the current account surplus grew in March for
the first time in 12 months, to $7.1 billion from $6.6
billion a year earlier, Mr. Lipsky said: "That suggests that
the reduction in Japan's overall surplus has stopped."
Contributing to that surplus is the yen's 23% fall over the
past 16 months.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Mr. Lipsky and others concede that the big
question in the stronger-yen scenario is whether the Federal
Reserve and West German Bundesbank raise their respective
discount rates to battle domestic inflation. Signs of higher
U.S. inflation sent U.S. bond prices tumbling last week.
Meanwhile, the German central bank is concerned about the
inflationary effects of the unification of East and West
Germany, particularly the proposed monetary union.</p>
<p>Rate increases in both countries could weaken the yen by
boosting the dollar's and mark's appeal to international
investors. That, in turn, would pressure the Bank of Japan to
defend its currency with a rate increase of its own.</p>
<p>But "Japan won't respond with an increase in their
discount rate because they don't want to contribute to a
global interest rate war which could destabilize financial
markets," argues Mr. Lipsky. Instead, he says that Tokyo
could nudge money-market rates higher. But traders doubt such
maneuvering would be sufficient to keep the yen from falling
back below 160 to the dollar.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Dennis, chief international economist at James
Capel & Co. in London, believes the Japanese have little
choice. "We suspect the yen hasn't yet bottomed and that we
probably need one more increase in Japanese official interest
rates, which we probably won't see till the yen falls below
160 {to the dollar} again," he says. "Another percentage
point increase in Japanese rates will eliminate the interest
rate differential between the U.S. and Japan. That would make
it much more dangerous to keep selling the yen."</p>
<p>Even so, Mr. Dennis isn't pessimistic about the yen's
long-term prospects. A year from now, he sees Japan's
currency at 145 yen to the dollar, nearly 9% above current
levels.</p>
<p>Last week, "we for the first time began to wonder whether
the capital flows were turning around and going the other way
back to Japan," says Mr. Dennis. "Evidence of that was the
improved performance of the Japanese stock and bonds markets
and the fact that both the Treasury bond market and the Dow
{Jones Industrial Average} were down."</p>
<p>One of the causes, he adds, was the rumor that the Finance
Ministry had requested Japanese institutions to repatriate
some funds back to Japan to support local markets.</p>
<p>In addition, says Mr. Udagawa of Bank of Tokyo,
"foreigners have stopped selling Japanese stock." For the
last four trading days of last week, the Nikkei average of
225 leading stocks that trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
bounced back 4.8%, after falling 26.9% since year end.</p>
<p>And referring to statements last week by senior U.S.
Treasury officials that a weak yen posed risks to the world's
economy, Mr. Dennis says: "The political pressure is in the
direction of trying to help the Japanese out by getting the
yen up."</p>
<p>If there is a wild card in these scenarios, it's
Lithuania. To date, the Soviet Union's economic embargo has
helped to underpin the dollar -- especially against the mark
-- but not as much as many analysts had expected. Normally,
international stress -- particularly that involving Moscow --
raises the dollar's appeal as a "safe haven" currency.</p>
<p>But Mr. Dennis of James Capel warns: "If Lithuania is
resolved by the Russians moving the tanks in, the dollar will
go sharply higher to 1.75 marks and the yen will rise to 165
to the dollar."</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $376.60 an ounce, down 70 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate 2.7 million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at
$376.75 an ounce.</p>
