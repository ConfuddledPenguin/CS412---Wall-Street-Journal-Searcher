	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The vice chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, Manuel Johnson, said he see signs that economic
activity is "beginning to pick back up."
   "There are not any signs -- other than this hysteria about
the credit crunch -- of weakness," Mr. Johnson said in an
interview. At the same time, he said, inflation remains a
threat both in the U.S. and abroad. He termed "disappointing"
last week's report that consumer prices shot up 0.5% in
March. And he said that easier credit conditions in Western
Europe outside Germany may stimulate demand for U.S. exports,
possibly resulting in inflationary pressure from overseas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He gave no clue on the crucial question of timing, noting
that the warm weather earlier this year makes it difficult to
get an accurate reading of the underlying pace of the economy
and that the consumer price report may have been distorted by
a surge in apparel prices. "This is a period to be cautious,"
he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson's views are important because he is a crucial
swing vote in Fed decisions at the moment. The financial
market indicators that Mr. Johnson and others watch
intensively don't appear to signal any urgency. Long-term
interest rates in the bond market are up, but the dollar is
relatively stable when viewed against currencies of all U.S.
trading partners -- not just Japan -- and commodity prices
are mixed.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson also said he and other Fed officials don't
object to international intervention in currency markets to
support the yen so long as such efforts don't turn into a
world-wide campaign against the dollar.</p>
<p>After gradually pushing down short-term interest rates for
six months, the Fed paused at the end of December and has
been resisting pressure from the administration and others to
lower them further. Fed officials say the behavior of the
economy in the past four months vindicates their stance. The
economy has bounced back from its fourth-quarter languor.
Inflation hasn't abated. Bond yields, seen by some as a
measure of inflation expectations, have risen.</p>
<p>In a separate interview last week, Robert Parry, president
of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, said the current
pace of the U.S. economy is too rapid to make much dent in
the inflation rate. He put the annual growth pace at slightly
above 2%, after inflation.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Parry expects prices to rise more slowly in
the coming months than they did in the first quarter, he
still predicts inflation will be higher this year than last
year. "That's uncomfortable and unacceptable," he said. But
Mr. Parry, who is among the Fed's staunchest foes of
inflation, added, "At this point, I am not willing to say we
ought to aim for a recession to produce faster adjustment" in
the inflation rate.</p>
<p>In recent months, the Fed and the Treasury have clashed
over the Treasury's eagerness to intervene in currency
markets to push down the dollar. But Mr. Johnson said the Fed
is prepared to support intervention to support the weak yen
provided other countries use their own currencies -- not just
the dollar -- to buy yen. "I've never objected to
intervention to support the yen, but that has been translated
into general dollar sales," he stated.</p>
<p>At the recent meeting of finance ministers and central
bankers from the seven largest industrial countries, West
Germany reportedly resisted Japanese entreaties that it spend
marks to support the yen. As a result, the U.S. was unwilling
to agree to stepped-up intervention.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson emphasized the importance of coordinating
economic policies internationally, and he expressed
reservations about the current state of the coordination
process. "I worry that it could flounder; I think it needs
some energy," he said. The formal coordination mechanism is
the Group of Seven, which includes finance ministers and
central bankers from the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France,
Britain, Canada and Italy.</p>
