completed the sale of one unit and accepted a management
buy-out bid for another, with combined proceeds expected to
be about $15 million.
   The Colonial Candle operations was sold to closely held
Blyth Industries Inc., based in Greenwich, Conn. Also,
General Housewares accepted a proposal from an employee
management group to acquire the Kitchen Textile Coordinates
business. Both units have been based in Hyannis, Mass.</p>

and place mats. It also markets canister sets and mugs. The
sale is expected to be completed around the end of June.</p>
<p>General Housewares has said the proceeds would go to pay
down long-term debt, as the company concentrates on its
retail cookware business.</p>
