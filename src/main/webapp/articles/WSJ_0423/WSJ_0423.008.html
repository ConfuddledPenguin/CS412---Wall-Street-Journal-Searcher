	<h3>Travel: Smokers Go Out of Their Way to Beat Restrictions on Lighting Up in Flight</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Ken and Marcia Norgaard won't walk a mile for a Camel, but
they will fly 740 miles out of their way and pay an extra
$600 for their two-pack-a-day habit.
   Instead of flying from Phoenix, Ariz., to London by way of
New York on their next vacation -- and enduring four
smokeless hours on the first leg of the trip -- the couple
booked a much longer route. They will now head west to Los
Angeles, to catch a nonstop flight to London that permits
smoking. "I just won't go so long without smoking," says Mr.
Norgaard, a 67-year-old retiree from Scottsdale, Ariz.,
lighting up twice during a brief interview.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Norgaards are part of a rebellious underground of
angry smokers who are having the ultimate nicotine fit over
the government's new edict against smoking on most domestic
flights. Desperate to light up, they are rerouting trips,
taking oddball connecting flights or even forgoing air travel
altogether. Some hooked business people admit to cutting back
on travel -- even if that means lost revenue for their
companies. When all else fails, the truly desperate simply
flout the law.</p>
<p>All this has turned the friendly skies downright hostile
at times. On a Pan American World Airways flight to San
Francisco, one passenger set off a smoke detector in a
bathroom, then defiantly lighted another cigarette when he
returned to his seat, airport police say. A few weeks ago, a
27-year-old United Airlines passenger vehemently denied
sneaking smokes during a New York-to-San Francisco flight --
though two flight attendants saw smoke seeping out of a
bathroom he had just used. Ordered to stay in his seat, San
Francisco police say, the passenger hurled a cigarette pack
at a flight attendant.</p>
<p>Then he demanded it back.</p>
<p>The ban has also created considerable ugliness on the
ground. With so many smokers stoking up before flights,
non-smoking fliers are fuming about the cigarette-smoke cloud
permeating some airports these days. One allergic traveler
collapsed from all the smoke at the Minneapolis-St. Paul
airport. And airport officials complain that rudeness is at
an all-time high. "I told one guy to stop, and he put it out
on the wall," says Tim Anderson, director of the Minneapolis
airport.</p>
<p>The cause of the distress is a federal law that took
effect in February banning smoking on flights of less than
six hours. That eliminates it on 95% of all flights, up from
the 70% covered by the previous ban on flights of under two
hours. "Two hours was bearable," says Dave Brenton, president
of Smokers' Rights Alliance in Mesa, Ariz. "But six hours --
forget it."</p>
<p>For the smoking community, these desperate times call for
desperate action. So Ronald Rizzo, a Los Angeles lawyer with
a three-pack-a-day habit, eschews nonstops and bumps across
the country on short, connecting flights -- to steal smoke
breaks between flights. Such scheming can backfire: A
one-hour layover he had planned in Chicago, for example,
turned into a hellish three hours because of bad weather.</p>
<p>Nancy Percy, owner of the Travel Network travel agency in
Folsom, Calif., plans to fly to Baltimore via Mexico because
international flights are exempt. Her desire to smoke has
turned her itinerary into a traveler's nightmare: Leave San
Francisco 10:55 p.m., arrive Mexico City 5:10 a.m. Wait five
hours at the airport -- smoking and sightseeing -- and touch
down in Baltimore at 6:20 p.m. "It may look silly," she
allows, between drags of Carlton 120s. "But I want to enjoy
traveling."</p>
<p>Not everyone can avail themselves of such creative
solutions. Consider the Hawaiian traveler, most of whose
flights to the U.S. fall tantalizingly short of six hours.
And unlike mainlanders, Hawaiians don't have the luxury of
opting for train travel on out-of-state trips. "I feel
trapped," says David Goris, an import-export business owner.</p>
<p>His answer? Cancel a Las Vegas, Nev., vacation he had been
planning for a year, as well as two trips to Washington
state. Another Hawaiian, Floyd Cammack, has stopped making
business trips for his piano-repair company. That may cost
him $15,000 in lost revenue, he says, but he figures there's
a bright side -- he won't have to worry about lost bags.
After smoking for four decades, he says, "I find it a lot
easier to quit flying than smoking."</p>
<p>Others who can't quit have resorted to breaking the law.
At Chicago's O'Hare airport, police say they've arrested five
people for smoking on planes since the ban took effect Feb.
25 -- a pace that would generate 50% more smoking arrests
than last year under the two-hour rule. Airport police in
Pittsburgh and San Francisco report similar increases.
(Violators face fines of up to $1,000, but the Federal
Aviation Administration generally moves slowly and presses
the issue only in flagrant cases.) And United says its crews
reported 14 violations in the first four weeks of the ban, up
from eight in January.</p>
<p>Such desperation has sparked renewed concern about
bathroom fires, like the 1983 Air Canada blaze near
Cincinnati that killed 23 passengers. Though airlines have
installed smoke alarms in lavatories since then, some flight
attendants fear that nicotine desperadoes can disarm them.
"You do get a little nervous when someone's in the bathroom a
long time," says a USAir flight attendant.</p>
<p>But forget the passengers. Pity the poor smoking flight
attendant who spends much of her waking hours on planes.
Though the law permits pilots to smoke in the cockpit, most
attendants can't even chew gum to still their nicotine
craving because of airline policies. Some airlines also
forbid flight attendants from smoking in public areas of
airports. Which is why Karen Cassady, a 37-year-old
attendant, dashes for the airport bathrooms the moment she
steps off the plane.</p>
<p>"Do you know what it's like hiding in a bathroom stall
next to a mother changing her baby's diaper?" she asks. "I
feel subhuman or something."</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Ms. Cassady and her fellow smokers,
airports also are becoming more inhospitable to smokers. More
than 50 U.S. airports prohibit smoking in most areas, or plan
to in the near future, generally exiling smokers to remote
corners of gate sections. "It's like a double whammy," Ms.
Cassady says, lighting up at a public telephone -- in yet
another nonsmoking area.</p>
<p>Despite the anger of smokers, the law isn't likely to
change anytime soon. Tobacco lobbyists say they have too many
other anti-smoking bills to contend with these days. And most
carriers say 80% of their customers are nonsmokers delighted
with the law. "The public wants this," says a Northwest
Airlines spokesman.</p>
<p>One USAir smoker found out just how strongly the public
feels. According to police in Pittsburgh, the woman lighted
up while the plane was still boarding in Pittsburgh. As
uniformed police arrived on board, she pleaded with her
fellow passengers. "Shouldn't I be able to smoke?" she asked.
"No]" the passengers shot back in unison, miffed at being
held up 20 minutes by the woman's tantrum.</p>
<p>"When we led her away," recalls Lt. Nobert Kowalski of the
airport police in Pittsburgh, "everybody was cheering."</p>
