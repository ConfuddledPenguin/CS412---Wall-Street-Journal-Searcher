	<p class="article-leader">Hard liquor is going soft.
   Seagram Co. is beginning a national rollout of a "light"
whiskey product that has been in test markets since last
fall.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mount Royal Light, the first effort by a major beverage
company to transfer the "light" concept to hard liquor, has
one-third less alcohol and one-third fewer calories than
standard 80-proof whiskey. The 54-proof product, is
classified as a specialty liquor by federal regulators, but
Seagram has been advertising it as a whiskey product.</p>
<p>While three of the top-10-selling beer brands are light
beers, some industry experts question whether the concept
makes much sense for hard liquor. Since most liquor is served
with water or mixers, consumers can easily control on their
own how much alcohol they get.</p>
<p>"If you want less alcohol, you just add a little more
mixer," says Tom Pirko, president of Bev-Mark Inc., a Los
Angeles beverage consulting firm. "This is a concept that
just doesn't make a lot of sense. Nobody's going to get the
Nobel Prize for having concocted `light' spirits."</p>
<p>Mr. Pirko says also playing against Seagram is the fact
that "light" claims in general have lost their punch. The
American public, he says, has become skeptical as marketers
slapped the label on a multitude of products ranging from
potato chips to cupcakes. "Seagram is entering the 1990s
playing with a 1980s marketing gimmick," he says.</p>
<p>Seagram, however, is so confident that the product will be
a success that it is expanding distribution. It recently
received approval to sell Mount Royal Light in Wisconsin,
Colorado and Tennessee, and the company plans to enter other
states shortly. The light whiskey has been sold in
Massachusetts and upstate New York since last September. A
750-milliliter bottle of Mount Royal Light sells for about
$8.</p>
<p>"We are obviously delighted with the response that Mount
Royal Light has had," a Seagram spokesman says. "It's pretty
clear to us that this is a product that has a place" in the
alcohol market.</p>
<p>Seagram insists the product isn't simply a watered-down
version of a traditional whiskey. A special production
process, the company says, gives Mount Royal Light the flavor
and full-bodied style of a standard whiskey.</p>
<p>Seagram says the product was well received in test markets
by drinkers of Canadian and American whiskeys, who are
principally men. While Mount Royal Light is aimed at
traditional whiskey drinkers, Seagram says it also attracted
more younger drinkers and women than traditional whiskey
products.</p>
<p>But Seagram admits it has a serious marketing challenge on
its hands. The spokesman says the ad campaign for the
product, developed by WPP Group agency Ogilvy & Mather, goes
to great lengths to underscore that the full flavor is what
makes the product different. Ads tout the product as "history
in the making."</p>
<p>"It's very difficult in the beverage alcohol business to
introduce a new product, especially one that takes a bit of
doing to communicate its advantages," the Seagram spokesman
says.</p>

<p>WPP Stock Falls</p>
<p>WPP Group's shares tumbled sharply Friday, with its
American depositary receipts falling $1.75 to $19.375 in
national over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>Analysts attributed the drop partly to fallout from
problems at FKB Group, a similarly structured British
advertising and communications company, whose shares Friday
were halted from trading in London because of a credit
crunch. FKB, like WPP, bought a number of companies on an
earn-out basis, in which it makes payments based on earnings
over a number of years. FKB apparently is facing problems
meeting the payments. Julie Mackee, chief financial officer
of the company's U.S. operations, said FKB is "in the process
of negotiating a refinancing package with our bankers" and
trading "won't resume until we're in a position to announce a
detailed refinancing proposal."</p>
<p>WPP is far larger than FKB, and analysts said it isn't
facing troubles like those at FKB. But because of
well-publicized problems caused by softness in the ad
business, particularly at Saatchi & Saatchi Co., "anything in
that sector that implies bad news really seems to affect
everyone else" disproportionately, Ms. Mackee noted. WPP
executives couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
