	<p class="article-leader">PLAINSBORO, N.J. -- In the country-club atmosphere of its
sprawling conference center here, Merrill Lynch & Co. tried
to convince 223 skeptical stockholders that it's serious
about cutting costs.
   Merrill annual meetings are usually fairly routine. But
the nation's biggest brokerage firm on Friday held what
longtime employees called one of its most eventful meetings
in years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A swarm of Californians in pirate garb picketed the event,
complaining about Merrill's treatment of residents of a
mobile home park it owns in Laguna Beach. Inside,
stockholders peppered Merrill management about the luxury of
their surroundings and the mediocrity of Merrill's earnings.
With all the questions, the firm's president and chairman
decided to save time by skipping their prepared speeches.</p>
<p>Merrill is coming off a fourth quarter in which it took a
record $470 million pretax charge to pay for a massive
retrenchment plan including at least 3,000 layoffs. For 1989,
the firm recorded a net loss of $213.4 million. Its stock is
down 11.4% this year.</p>
<p>First, the serious business: Merrill officials said that
because of its ongoing retrenchment, it plans an absolute
reduction in fixed expenses in its 1990 budget of 3% below
1989, "and we're working to achieve an even greater
reduction."</p>
<p>Merrill projected savings of more than $150 million in
expenses in 1990, and "continuing" savings after that. That
forecast was more specific than previous projections that
annual savings would be more than $100 million; however, it's
lower than the expense-reduction projection of nearly $200
million that Merrill had talked about shortly after it took
its fourth-quarter charge.</p>
<p>"We believe that this represents a substantial return
against the charge," said Merrill President Daniel P. Tully.
Analysts had sniped about Merrill's logic in taking a $470
million charge to garner only $100 million in savings.</p>
<p>Still, it was a tough sell convincing shareholders that
Merrill, with its free-spending reputation, will do a good
job of penny-pinching.</p>
<p>An investor opined that the manicured Plainsboro
conference center was a "nice place to play golf in." The
defensive Merrill officials said the facility saves them
money by allowing them to train their swarms of brokers
outside New York City. William A. Schreyer, Merrill chairman,
called it "one of our superior decisions as far as
real-estate strategy."</p>
<p>The pirates, from Treasure Island Mobile Home Park, were
complaining about a Merrill partnership's plan to relocate
them and to develop condominiums on their island. Mr.
Schreyer seemed rushed at the meeting, but said he wasn't
nervous about the pirates. "I just got through `Barbarians at
the Gate,' and now there are pirates at the gate," he joked.
John L. Steffens, head of Merrill's consumer markets sector,
said "some sort of agreement" with the mobile-home residents
should be worked out soon.</p>
