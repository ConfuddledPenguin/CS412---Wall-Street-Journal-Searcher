	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Nasdaq is ready for prime time.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers is
launching an advertising blitz, seeking to give its Nasdaq
automated stock-quote system the same cachet as the stock
exchanges that compete with it for listings. The ads are
running in national business magazines and on television in
the New York area.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Without exactly saying so, the NASD also wants to
establish a separate identity for itself now that the term
"over-the-counter" has taken on seamy overtones in many
investors' minds because of pennystock frauds.</p>
<p>"Nasdaq is a stock market, separate from the OTC," says
Brian Holland who, as senior vice president of marketing for
NASD, is coordinating the new ad campaign.</p>
<p>"They're really trying to make the Nasdaq stock market
distinct from OTC," says Robert Flaherty, editor of the OTC
Review, a magazine that covers the OTC market. Mr. Flaherty
was recently turned down when he sought permission to change
the name of the magazine to Nasdaq Review. "I think they're
afraid the name Nasdaq will get sullied," he said, referring
to the board that controls the Nasdaq market and its
copyrighted name.</p>
<p>Companies must meet minimum networth and other
requirements to be eligible for Nasdaq trading. Trading of
their shares is monitored through a surveillance system
designed to detect fraud. No such surveillance system is
available for non-Nasdaq stocks, which have involved more
than a few cases of fraud. Many non-Nasdaq stocks are known
as "pink sheets" stocks because their prices are listed on
pink paper by the National Quotation Bureau.</p>
<p>New Yorkers watching the late news tonight will be among
the first to see the latest of this month's ads by the NASD,
the self-styled self-regulatory body for the OTC market. In a
30-second commercial, they will see slow-motion images of
frenzied, messy trading on a stock exchange as a voice asks:
"Is there a rational alternative to the traditional trading
floor?" Naturally, there is: "Nasdaq. The stock market for
the next 100 years."</p>
<p>The ad budget is "several million" dollars. And the target
audience? "MEPS," says Mr. Holland, referring to "managers,
executives and professionals," the kind of people who watch
the news, business shows and golf tournaments. For example,
New York area viewers of the Masters golf tournament saw a
Nasdaq ad April 8.</p>
<p>One goal of Nasdaq, the nation's second largest securities
market, is to make itself as familiar to corporate America
and the investing public as the New York Stock Exchange.
Nasdaq is always striving to gain new companies and to keep
its larger and higher-quality OTC companies from defecting to
the New York and American exchanges.</p>
<p>First, however, the public has to know what Nasdaq is. The
50-year-old NASD both operates and polices the market for the
4,264 companies that meet its standards. Yet Nasdaq is far
from a household word. It stands for National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotations system.</p>
<p>"It's not so much that the image is bad, it's just there's
no image at all," says Ron Berger, the advertising executive
hired to start a television and magazine ad campaign earlier
this month by the NASD.</p>
<p>In surveys taken before the current ad campaign, a number
of people didn't realize that Apple Computer, MCI
Communications and Intel trade on Nasdaq. A major NASD goal
"is to get chief executives to keep their listing on Nasdaq
and gain a larger share of new listings," says Mr. Berger, a
partner with Messner Vetere Berger Carey Schmetterer, a New
York ad agency.</p>
<p>On Nasdaq, brokers compete to get the best share prices
for their clients using telephones and an integrated system
of computer screens -- the 19-year-old Nasdaq network --
rather than competing on an exchange floor. Over-the-counter
stocks were generally traded through pink sheets until 1971,
when computerized trading became available through Nasdaq.
Thousands of companies are still confined to the pink sheets,
where their prices and the brokerage companies that make a
market in the stocks are printed each trading day but aren't
available during intraday trading.</p>
<p>Although Nasdaq may not be the sexiest name to hit TV
screens, it has caught on overseas. Next year Japan will
initiate Jasdaq (Japan Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations system), an automated version of that country's
over-the-counter market that is modeled after the American
system. And while the London Stock Exchange didn't imitate
the name, in 1986 it converted to a trading system also
modeled after Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Two of Nasdaq's three television ads focus on the systems
adopted by the Japanese and British and suggest that the
Nasdaq system will be the standard of the future.</p>
<p>But some skeptics say that if NASD wants to erase any
negative connotations of the OTC market from the public's
mind, it must eventually encourage every trading department,
every mutual fund and every publication that now uses the
term OTC to also change their names.</p>
<p>"OTC is in common use," says John L. Watson III, president
of the Security Traders Association. "It will be a long time
before the word disappears, even if you work at it."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>The over-the-counter market sank again Friday, ending the
week 2.4% below where it started.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index slid 3.21 Friday, or 0.75%, to
425.79. OTC advancers trailed decliners, 764 to 1,138, on
150.3 million shares, up from 145.6 million.</p>
<p>Richard H. Holden, a principal of Alex. Brown, said
volatility in the over-the-counter market increased in recent
weeks, leaving stocks vulnerable to disappointing news. Mr.
Holden added that he expects the mood to persist next week.</p>
<p>Granite Construction, a road-building company, got a warm
reception from Wall Street. The company went public in a 2.5
million-share initial public offering priced at 17 and closed
at 18. Volume was more than 2.1 million shares.</p>
<p>Paul Meuller added 3 to 29 after reporting first-quarter
earnings, while SynOptics Communications added 2 1/2 to 39
1/8 on the strength of its earnings report.</p>
<p>Nesb fell 1/2 to 2 5/8. The troubled bank holding company,
based in New London, Conn., reported that it had a loss of
$1.80 a share after a provision for loan losses in the latest
first quarter. Nesb also said it is in technical default of
covenants on $50 million of long-term debt.</p>
<p>Stocks that fell on earnings reports were Chambers
Development Class A shares, off 1 1/4 to 39, Cadence Design
Systems, down 5/8 to 23 3/4, and Oregon Metallurgical, off 1
1/2 to 18.</p>
