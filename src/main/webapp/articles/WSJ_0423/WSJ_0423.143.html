	<p class="article-leader">Michael R. Milken was less than one hour away from being
publicly charged as the biggest financial criminal in
history. A federal grand jury in Manhattan was about to
accuse him of a sweeping array of crimes that included
insider trading, bribery, cheating customers and his former
employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert, and destroying
incriminating evidence.
   His chances of winning the case in court, most of his
lawyers and advisers told him, were slim.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thus, the billionaire financier who had spent so much of
his energy and funds insisting over the past few years that
he had done nothing wrong, made a stunning reversal last
Friday afternoon, agreeing to plead guilty to six felony
counts and pay $600 million in fines and restitution. Five of
the six counts carry prison terms of up to five years; the
sixth provides a three-year maximum. With his actual plea set
for tomorrow, Mr. Milken could still change his mind and
refuse to settle the case.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the settlement is undoubtedly historic,
far stiffer than the guilty plea to one felony count and the
$100 million payment extracted from arbitrager Ivan Boesky.
But how big a coup the Milken plea is for the government,
given the magnitude and scope of the crimes it was prepared
to allege, will depend on how much Mr. Milken cooperates with
government investigators.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken's plea agreement includes a promise of
cooperation with the probe, and given the government's
previous allegations of wrongdoing involving prominent
savings and loan executives and corporate raiders, Mr. Milken
could conceivably vault the insider-trading investigation to
an entirely new plane. But, in an unusual departure from
precedent, Mr. Milken will be sentenced before he speaks with
prosecutors, depriving them of their main leverage over the
former junk-bond empire builder should he prove recalcitrant.</p>
<p>Indeed, given the asserted strength of the government's
case, and the public outcry that followed the plea agreement
with Mr. Boesky, the government is likely to face intense
questioning about why it accepted any plea agreement with Mr.
Milken that, unlike the Boesky agreement, failed to contain
ironclad guarantees that Mr. Milken could implicate other
criminals.</p>
<p>If nothing else, Mr. Milken's three years of insisting on
his innocence and massive defense effort seem to have taxed
the government's stamina. The original U.S. attorney on the
case, Rudolph Giuliani, resigned, as have two heads of the
office's fraud section who were supervising the Milken case.
At the Securities and Exchange Commission, both the chief of
enforcement in charge of the Milken case and his top deputy
have resigned for jobs in private practice.</p>
<p>Still, a Milken guilty plea will save the government years
of a costly trial and goes a long way toward vindicating the
government, which has been the target of stinging attacks by
Mr. Milken and his public relations apparatus during its long
investigation. After his indictment last March, Mr. Milken
continued to denounce government prosecutors for engaging in
a "shadow trial of systematic leaks and innuendo based upon
false accusations."</p>
<p>In return for his guilty plea, Mr. Milken effectively
halts a public airing of the vast amounts of evidence
collected by prosecutors since their first, 98-count
indictment of him in March of last year. The evidence goes
far beyond the earlier charges of insider trading and
securities fraud.</p>
<p>People familiar with the investigation say that the new
information largely was provided by former Milken aides James
Dahl, Terren Peizer and Cary Maultasch, and by Mr. Milken's
old firm, Drexel Burnham, which itself agreed to plead guilty
to six felonies and pay $650 million in fines and restitution
in December 1988. Messrs. Dahl and Peizer were granted
immunity from prosecution in return for their testimony.
Prosecutors agreed to defer indefinitely charges against Mr.
Maultasch as a result of his cooperation. More than a dozen
additional witnesses are said to have provided corroborating
information to the government, people familiar with the probe
say.</p>
<p>Mr. Dahl is understood to have widened the investigation
dramatically by testifying about an arrangement under which
Mr. Milken allegedly helped a favored client, Columbia
Savings & Loan Association, violate tax laws. (No charges
have been filed against Columbia. The company has confirmed
that it is under investigation, and it has denied
wrongdoing.)</p>
<p>Messrs. Maultasch and Peizer are said to have provided the
government with information suggesting that Mr. Milken may
have obstructed justice by ordering the destruction of
documents in 1986, after it was learned that Mr. Boesky was
under investigation.</p>
<p>Mr. Peizer also is said to have told prosecutors that Mr.
Milken helped David Solomon, the former chief investment
officer of Solomon Asset Management, to violate tax laws. Mr.
Solomon, for his part, also became a witness against Mr.
Milken, confirming his illegal tax arrangement and providing
additional information on a London-based partnership
masterminded by Mr. Milken. The partnership, known as
Finsbury Partners, allegedly cheated its customers by
overcharging for securities.</p>
<p>Drexel is understood to have led the government to
investigate Mr. Milken's relationship with another
partnership known as MacPherson Partners. According to
Drexel's information, Mr. Milken allegedly used MacPherson as
part of a payola scheme: If certain money managers would buy
securities that Drexel had difficulty marketing, the clients
would be given the chance to participate personally in the
lucrative partnership. The government had been expected to
charge Mr. Milken in a new indictment with arranging to
defraud investors who might otherwise have benefited from
ownership of warrants held by the partnership.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr. Milken declined comment on the new
charges and all other aspects of this story. Government
spokespeople also declined comment.</p>
<p>According to people familiar with the course of the
settlement talks, the discussions began back in January of
1989. Then, Mr. Milken was offered the chance to plead guilty
to two felony counts. Prosecutors acceded to Mr. Milken's
demand that his brother receive immunity from prosecution,
people familiar with the talks say.</p>
<p>But when the prosecutors' deadline for a decision arrived,
Mr. Milken wasn't taking phone calls. He later refused the
offer, though it met most of the conditions he had originally
set. Friends say Mr. Milken, distraught at the prospect of
admitting guilt, had pulled back from the brink of a
settlement and resolved once again to take his case to a
jury.</p>
<p>Throughout the spring and summer of last year, Mr. Milken
and his legal team racked up more than $2 million a month in
legal fees preparing Mr. Milken's trial defense. They weeded
through hundreds of cartons of documents stored in a
government warehouse. They drafted dozens of legal briefs and
memos. And they commissioned expert studies on the operations
of the financial markets in an effort to demonstrate that
there had been no wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Some time during this period, the defense team received
stunning news: copies of handwritten profit and loss tallies
on allegedly illegal trades done by Mr. Milken and Mr. Boesky
were in the hands of prosecutors. Defense lawyers had
believed that Mr. Boesky had destroyed the documents, but the
papers had in fact been kept by Mr. Boesky's bookkeeper,
Setrag Mooradian, who was cooperating with the government.
This news convinced some members of the Milken legal team
that their case was in serious trouble.</p>
<p>More bad news came from the six-week trial last summer of
Drexel trader Bruce Newberg and five others. Many of the
accusations leveled by the government in its first-ever trial
of securities firm officials on racketeering charges involved
Mr. Milken and Drexel. All six defendants were convicted.</p>
<p>By early fall, the fighting spirit of the Milken team
appeared to be flagging. Mr. Milken authorized Arthur Liman,
a partner at the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton and Garrison, and New York defense attorney Stephen
E. Kaufman to begin another round of negotiations with
prosecutors.</p>
<p>For months, the delicate negotiations remained shrouded in
secrecy, hidden even from the SEC and from other defense
lawyers involved in the case.</p>
<p>By early February, agreement had been reached on most
details of the six felony counts to which Mr. Milken is
expected to plead guilty tomorrow in federal court in
Manhattan. The fate of Mr. Milken's brother, Lowell Milken,
remained a small obstacle -- prosecutors weren't at this time
willing to drop charges against him.</p>
<p>But then word of the negotiations began to leak, and SEC
Chairman Richard Breeden, learning that months of talks had
occurred without SEC input, demanded that his agency have its
say.</p>
<p>The SEC immediately took a hard line, asking among other
things that Mr. Milken provide information on savings and
loan chiefs who were once Mr. Milken's clients, people
familiar with the talks say. Mr. Milken's lawyers flatly
refused, and talks became so tense that Mr. Milken's defense
team threatened to walk away from the table.</p>
<p>A little more than a week ago, the SEC softened its
demand, clearing the way for a deal that could be presented
to Mr. Milken.</p>
<p>The unusual agreement on cooperation would still leave the
government with some leverage should he attempt to withhold
information, people familiar with the case say. The
government could cite him for breach of the plea agreement
and seek a resentencing. They could also use his lack of
cooperation to oppose any motions for early release from
prison, and he could be held in contempt for failing to
respond to questions from a grand jury.</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Milken can argue that he didn't
implicate friends and former clients in order to reduce his
sentence, or agree to implicate them in obtaining his plea.</p>
<p>Prosecutors told Mr. Milken's lawyers they would ask for a
substantial prison sentence but they agreed not to seek any
specific sentence. They also agreed that of the $600 million
payment, $200 million would constitute fines and $400 million
will be set aside to satisfy the claims of investors and
clients who allegedly lost money because of Mr. Milken's
criminal acts. The fine would leave Mr. Milken among the
nation's wealthiest individuals, with an estimated net worth
of nearly $1 billion.</p>
<p>The plea agreement also would grant Mr. Milken immunity
from prosecution anywhere else in the nation, a provision
that required the approval of U.S. Attorney General Richard
Thornburgh. The agreement would dismiss criminal charges
against Mr. Milken's brother Lowell, a former top aide, who
would be permanently barred from the securities industry and
would have to sign a consent decree with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. He may also face civil penalties.</p>
<p>The agreement leaves unclear the status of Bruce Newberg,
who was charged along with Mr. Milken in the first
indictment, and of former Milken aides Peter Gardiner, Alan
Rosenthal and Warren Trepp, who were expected to be indicted
along with Mr. Milken.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Milken's decision to plead may finally
relieve him of some of the considerable stress associates say
he has felt in recent months, it wasn't an easy one for him
to make.</p>
<p>The government had given him a deadline of noon on Friday
to accept the deal, but he let the deadline pass -- as he had
the first time a settlement was offered last year.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken remained in his Encino, Calif., home with his
wife, Lori, and his mother, Fern. The three had been
together, talking, since the early hours of a tense morning.
The phone rang insistently, but the trio took no calls.
Meanwhile, in Manhattan, the federal grand jury was poised
for a rare Friday session in which it would be asked to
approve the array of new charges.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Milken's attorneys had spent hundreds of
hours with him over a nearly four-year period, even they
didn't know how Mr. Milken would decide. It was midafternoon
New York time, only minutes before the grand jury was
scheduled to vote on the new indictment, when Mr. Milken
finally ended the suspense.</p>
