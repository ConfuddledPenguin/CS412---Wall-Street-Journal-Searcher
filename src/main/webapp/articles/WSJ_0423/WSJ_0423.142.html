	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Now that it's over, the first quarter looks
twice as strong as most folks thought it would at the start.
   The consensus view estimates an annual growth rate of
about 2.5% in real gross national product for the quarter, up
from the 1% growth outlook that prevailed in January,
according to MMS International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The government takes its first stab at estimating GNP in a
report Friday. Real GNP is the inflation-adjusted value of
the nation's output of goods and services. The data also are
expected to show that inflation heated up in the quarter. And
more inflationary timber is expected from tomorrow's report
on the first-quarter employment cost index. The week's only
other indicator, March durable goods orders, is still thought
to be on the rebound, after January's plunge.</p>
<p>Economists generally have been raising their GNP
forecasts, because of the unpredictable weather, imperfect
statistics, inventory swings, and some plain old
miscalculations.</p>
<p>Some, at least, are good-humored about taking the blame.
"I don't usually make a habit of comparing what I say at the
beginning of the quarter to what I say at the end," Robert
Dederick, chief economist of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago,
said. "It just depresses me." As many of his counterparts
did, Mr. Dederick in January predicted 1% growth. "I'm now
saying 2% to 2.5%," he said.</p>
<p>"Business's fixed investment is higher than we thought. So
is residential construction," Mr. Dederick said, noting two
areas boosted by unseasonably mild January weather. He said
better-than-expected exports helped the trade deficit and
added strength to the quarter.</p>
<p>Asked about his change-of-heart estimate, Michael Moran,
economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc., said: "Oh, boy.
It's much stronger than I had at the beginning of the
quarter." He now expects growth of 2.3% for the quarter, up
from the 1% to 1.5% he forecast at the start of the period.
GNP grew at an annual rate of 1.1% in the 1989 fourth
quarter.</p>
<p>Two improved areas that surprised Mr. Moran the most in
the first quarter: the trade-sector improvement and
fixed-investment spending. Besides the benefits of mild
weather, he noted that overall "demand was just a bit more
robust than we thought was likely."</p>
<p>While the first quarter may have been stronger than they
thought, many economists said the growth pace won't hold.</p>
<p>Donald Fine, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, New
York, raised his first-quarter estimate to 2.5% from around
1%. But he doesn't expect the pace to continue in the months
ahead. "I think capital spending will slip off," he said.
"Construction will definitely fall off. And we don't know if
trade will get much better." On the other side, Mr. Fine
said, auto output is likely to be stronger in the second
quarter than in the first. "But that's quarterly auto
catch-up," he said.</p>
<p>Many economists, including Robert Chandross at Lloyds
Bank, are sticking to their full-year forecasts but are
reshuffling the quarters. "Basically, there'll be a little
more in the first quarter and a little less in the second,"
he said. "I'm still looking for {a} 2%" annual growth rate
from the 1989 fourth quarter to this year's fourth quarter.</p>
<p>An inflation measure of the GNP report known as the
implicit price deflator is expected to have risen at a 5.5%
annual rate for the quarter. Allen Sinai, Boston Co.'s chief
economist, expects to see "uncomfortably strong inflation"
for the first quarter, with the implicit deflator as high as
6%.</p>
<p>The first-quarter employment cost index is expected to add
to inflationary fears, with an increase of about 5.5% to 6%
on a year-to-year basis. Economists pointed out that part of
the rise in employment cost results from Social Security
payment increases that took effect in January.</p>
<p>Expectations for tomorrow's report on March durable goods
orders are typically scattered. Estimates range from a
decline of 1.2% to an increase of 5.1%, with the median view
a rise of 2%, according to MMS. Most economists expect some
kind of increase in durable goods, as orders continue to
rebound from January's sharp 10.5% plunge.</p>
