	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Douglas Quinn was so taken with the phlegmatic
dog star of the movie "Turner & Hooch" that he took out a
classified ad seeking a "Hooch" pup. "I liked the dog, and I
want it. That's all," says Mr. Quinn, a man of few words and
the father of 3 1/2-year-old twin boys in Barry, Ontario. So
far, no response to the ad.
   Just wait till Mr. Quinn finds out that the gargoyle-faced
dogue de Bordeaux can cost as much as $1,800, weighs 125
pounds and craves 12 pounds of raw chicken necks each day,
plus kibble. "It isn't easy to get chicken necks," concedes
Peter Curley, the breeder who supplied four dogs for the
movie, which also stars Tom Hanks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Curley adds that though the dogue may have achieved a
certain vogue thanks to Hollywood, smart (as in fashionable)
doesn't necessarily mean smart (as in intelligent). "The only
thing you can train the Bordeaux to do is eat and sleep,"
says Mr. Curley, who now is branching out to an even rarer
breed: the presa de Canario, known as "the gripping dog" of
the Canary Islands. Mr. Curley expects that strong-jawed
beast to be popular at dog shows and to command maybe $2,500.</p>
<p>The Bordeaux and the presa are power dogs -- not mere pets
but status symbols. "I'm sure it happens that there are
people who buy dogs like they buy cars," says Peter L.
Borchelt, an animal psychologist in Forest Hills, N.Y.</p>
<p>Carol Lea Benjamin, a New York author whose book
"Second-Hand Dog" is a paean to the mongrel, notes that
"breeds are often chosen because somebody famous has one" --
the president of the U.S., say, or an admired movie star.
Appreciating that fact, the International Kennel Club, which
is really just a pet store in Manhattan, sometimes manages to
plant items in the gossip columns disclosing that an actor --
Bruce Willis, for instance -- is taking delivery of some
Akita pups or that singer Roberta Flack has a fox-faced shiba
inu. Gilt by association, in other words. It is supposed to
move dogs, and it undoubtedly does.</p>
<p>People magazine recently predicted that the bichon frise,
a bit of fluff whose name means curly- haired lap-dog, will
be one of the top five dogs of the 1990s, "style-wise." And
in no time at all, Tina Geores, a New Jersey breeder, was
advertising it as "the most stylish dog of the '90s."</p>
<p>Ms. Geores claims the bichon is getting more and more
popular "with very trendy people, people in show business,"
people like Carly Simon, the singer and songwriter. "They are
such a pleasant little dog," Ms. Geores says. "They're easy
to travel with. They're easy to live with." They cost between
$650 and $1,200.</p>
<p>The authoritative American Kennel Club, which is not a pet
store in Manhattan, is a little slower on the uptake than
readers of People. It recognizes only 130 breeds, and the
Bordeaux and shiba inu aren't two of them. The AKC each year
lists the top 10 breeds (in terms of registrations), and most
are not exotic power dogs. Cockers and Labs, poodles, golden
retrievers and German shepherds head the list, in that order,
although two currently fashionable breeds, Rottweiler and
chow chow (chow for short), do make the latest top 10.</p>
<p>"The Rotty is the guard dog of the moment," says John
Mandeville, an AKC judging official. He says the bear-faced
chow is probably the "pre-eminent fad dog." Mr. Mandeville
notes that both dogs tend to be hard to handle, particularly
if they aren't well trained and if the owner isn't assertive.
But, he says, many breed-conscious masters unfortunately
can't see past the pup. "If there's anything cuter than an
eight- or 10-week-old chow puppy, I'm not sure what it is,"
he says. But then one day, the dog owner wakes up to find a
giant, shedding beast (with a blue tongue in the case of the
chow) who wants to be boss. "Cute" can easily enough turn
into "trouble."</p>
<p>That hasn't kept AKC registrations from reaching an
all-time high, as more Americans seek to spend their mad
money on the perfect dog. The dogue de Bordeaux may not be
it, for a variety of reasons, one of which is that it
originally was bred as a fighting dog. It is said to be good
with children. But it might just have the neighbor's shih tzu
for lunch.</p>
<p>The border collie (like Mike the Dog in the film "Down and
Out in Beverly Hills") is a current favorite. So are
bulldogs. Jack Russell terriers are popular with the horsy
set. The short-legged Welsh corgi is big (Queen Elizabeth II
has at least one). And so, of course, is the English bull
terrier (thanks to Anheuser-Busch, Bud Light and Spuds
MacKenzie).</p>
<p>Barbara Bush and the president have been good for English
springer spaniels. Theirs -- Millie and her pups -- have been
good for the Bushes politically. (Yes, Messrs. Reagan, Nixon,
Johnson and Roosevelt had famous dogs, too.) George Bush gave
this advice to a Republican running for Congress in New York:
"One single word. Puppies. Worth 10 points."</p>
<p>Like politicians, dog breeds have their moment. But the
popular ones get overbred, by puppy mills and others trying
to take advantage of demand. "With anything trendy, there's a
rush to breed for profit," says Mr. Borchelt, the animal
psychologist. "That's no good." Puppy mills turn out dogs
with physical and psychological problems, dogs that can't
handle their aggressive impulses, dogs that bite.</p>
<p>And ultimately a breed will pass out of fashion, as the
shar-pei seems to be doing now. It is that wrinkly creature
which, as a pup, looks more like a pile of sweat shirts than
a dog.</p>
<p>On a tour of the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan, Mr.
Borchelt is interrupted twice by veterinarians seeking his
advice about their patients. An elderly woman has a "nervous
chow," says one. The other confides: "I've got a problem with
an aggressive shar-pei."</p>
<p>The Chinese shar-pei, or "sand-skin," was nearly extinct
in the 1950s. But, two decades later, it caught on with the
rare-dog breeders and, in 1983, the Neiman Marcus Christmas
catalog featured a pair of shar-pei pups -- at $2,000 each.
The rage began. Today there are more than 50,000 shar-peis.
The price has come down to as little as $100, a sign that the
fad is about played out. And that's only the half of it.</p>
<p>"The shar-pei is a veterinarian's dream," says Michael
Marder, a Manhattan vet. "I'm seeing a lot of health and
behavioral problems, not life-threatening but chronic," he
says. Skin trouble is especially common.</p>
<p>Ethel Petry, of Central Point, Ore., is familiar from an
owner's standpoint with the shar-pei's potential for
ailments. She chose her shar-pei puppy largely because his
front paws were "broken down," and she was afraid the
flat-footed dog would be destroyed.</p>
<p>Timothy, now three years old, cost her a hundred bucks.
But he was no bargain. His doctor bills have been at least
five times that. He contracted a bad case of mange, and he
tends to be sickly. "He can be playing with you one minute,"
Ms. Petry says, "and come down with a temperature of 104
degees the next."</p>
<p>Efforts to fix the dog's feet failed, and the little pads
on his paws never toughened up. So, "Timothy is a grass-dog.
I never walk him on the street," says his owner. He travels
by car from his backyard to the park for outings. And at
least once, Ms. Petry has had to carry Timothy in her arms to
keep him off the pavement. Still, she says, "We get along."</p>
<p>Fortunately, passe power dogs seldom seem to end up at the
pound, abandoned by owners who have traded up to a newer
model. Marjorie Stein, manager of adoption services for the
North Shore Animal League in Port Washington, N.Y., says she
sees few of the exotic breeds: "A chichi dog has a much
better chance of getting a home by word of mouth. Generally,
somebody wants it."</p>
