	<p class="article-leader">Your two-inch news story on March 14 was not, in my
judgment, a sufficient obituary for the demise of Business
Conditions Digest, the government's monthly publication on
leading indicators. BCD, as it is known among its admirers,
was born in 1961, when the Commerce Department had the
foresight to adopt the leading indicators as a persistent and
reliable way of telling where the business cycle is heading.
At that time BCD stood for Business Cycle Developments. The
words, but not the letters, were changed a few years later,
when the government's foresight failed to perceive that the
business cycle would persist, as it has to this day. Why else
are there news stories practically every day about whether a
recession is or is not about to break?
   BCD is being buried quietly in the Survey of Current
Business, a useful publication but not one devoted to the
business cycle. Now would have been a good time not to bury
BCD but to expand it. Why not cover international
developments more thoroughly, since their impact on the U.S.
business cycle is large and growing? Why not cover indicators
of inflation more thoroughly, since inflation is so closely
tied to the business cycle and policy makers must consider
both? Why not provide more indicators of the varying fortunes
of the service industries, since they now play a dominant
role in our economy?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As we raise a glass to BCD and toast its 29 years of
service as well as the example it has set for many other
countries, let us resolve that its mission will continue to
be fulfilled, whether by government or private initiative.</p>
