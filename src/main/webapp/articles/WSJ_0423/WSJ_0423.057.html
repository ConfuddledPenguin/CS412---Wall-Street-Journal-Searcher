	<p class="article-leader">SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. -- On a rainy night in early spring,
Andrew Sabin, chest high in icy-cold water in a kettle hole
formed by glaciers 10,000 years ago, trains his flashlight on
something moving.
   "I don't think it's a tiger, though," he says, inspecting
it more closely. Mr. Sabin, by day a precious-metals trader
and refiner, often spends his nights out hunting for the
Eastern tiger salamander, a striped amphibian that has roused
a fierce conflict between environmentalists and developers in
the posh East End of Long Island.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In most parts of the country, the tiger salamander, or
Ambystoma Tigrinum, is very elusive, emerging from its
underground habitat only once during the year to breed in
shallow ponds for a couple of weeks. Even then the
salamander, about the size of a hand, is difficult to spot.</p>
<p>But in the Hamptons, where the ocean beckons and land with
a view costs as much as $1 million an acre, some cynics say
the heavier the building permit applications, the greater the
number of salamander sightings.</p>
<p>"The joke around the planning department is that if it's
such an endangered species, then somebody must be carrying it
around from site to site," says Doug Love, a reporter for the
Southampton Press.</p>
<p>Discovery of the salamander on land scheduled for
development is no laughing matter. Protected by state and
local environmental laws, the creature's presence can cost a
developer millions of dollars, sometimes delaying building
several years while an impact study is done. State law bars
development within a 100-foot radius around a breeding pond.
"If you want to develop a piece of property, it's clearly in
your interest not to have a tiger salamander there," says
John Bennett, Southampton town attorney.</p>
<p>Edwin M. Schwenk, executive director of the Long Island
Builders Institute, a trade group, declares: "Unfortunately
in many instances, one of our people buys a property, goes in
fat, dumb and happy, and lo and behold, six months later
somebody comes up with a tiger salamander." A sighting of a
tiger salamander in a manmade pond in Nassau County cost
developer Gerald Monter two years, $9 million, and one
building.</p>
<p>The little tiger salamander has figured into even larger
issues. In November, the Long Island Pine Barrens Society
filed a lawsuit to halt about $11.2 billion of proposed
development on more than 100,000 acres in the pine barrens.
The environmental group wants a study done of the cumulative
effects of development on drinking water and the habitat of
rare and endangered species, such as the tiger salamander.</p>
<p>The salamanders, which can grow as long as 13 inches, were
believed to have largely disappeared from Long Island -- the
only place they are found in New York State -- for 30 or 40
years before John Cryan, a state biologist, identified
breeding sites in the late '70s and early '80s.</p>
<p>Mr. Sabin, a self-described naturalist, discovered 10 or
11 previously unknown populations on the South Fork in the
mid- to late '80s. Because the creatures' reappearance
coincided with a drive toward greater development, some
suspect they are being used as a convenient tool by
environmentalists, and by wealthy landowners who don't want
their views obscured.</p>
<p>"Some people will use an environmental argument not merely
to save a species but also to stop a development totally,"
contends Lee Koppelman, executive director of the Long Island
Regional Planning Board. Says Mr. Schwenk: "We have a
syndrome out here that the last one who moves in here wants
to be the last one that's allowed."</p>
<p>"If nothing else works they bring out the salamander" says
Paul Council, Southampton's director of community
development. "They wait until the eleventh hour to find these
things. Compared to people, trees, birds and bunnies are now
getting priority."</p>
<p>Word around town is that getting hold of a tiger
salamander isn't too hard. Tiger salamanders aren't
endangered in some Southern states, where they are bred and
used in the larval stage for fish bait, says Alvin Breisch,
of the endangered species unit in New York's Department of
Environmental Conservation. "I'm told you can mail order them
from Louisiana," says Mr. Schwenk, a Southampton native. But
Mr. Cryan, the biologist, notes that these Southern tigers
are a subspecies that is slightly different from the ones
found on Long Island.</p>
<p>When the salamanders first began disrupting development,
"there were a lot of accusations . . . about people having
tiger salamanders in their pockets," says Larry Penny,
director of natural resources in East Hampton. But he notes
that only a few non-state employees, including Mr. Sabin,
have licenses allowing them to handle the creatures.</p>
<p>To avoid "planting" of salamanders, state officials must
verify a breeding site. "We like to see egg masses or larvae,
some proof of reproduction at the site," says Steven J.
Sanford, an official in the Long Island regional office of
the state's Department of Environmental Conservation.</p>
<p>Mr. Sabin scoffs at suggestions he may have planted
salamanders to delay development. "The first one I found
wasn't even near a subdivision," says the 44-year-old former
vice chairman of the Commodity Exchange who runs nature walks
for children and sits on the board of the local chapter of
the Nature Conservancy, a conservation group.</p>
<p>"It's virtually impossible" to plant a salamander, says
Mr. Cryan. "Salamanders would be very disoriented and most
likely wouldn't breed in a pond they were dumped in."</p>
<p>Although some conservationists say Southampton town
officials were slow to embrace the preservation effort, the
town appears to have come around. "We're friends of the
salamander," says Roy Wines, chairman of the Southampton
Planning Board. The town requires as much as a 500-foot
radius of protected area near any wetlands where the tigers
are found, and has revised some zoning to allow for greater
open space areas.</p>
<p>Evidence of the tiger salamander has had an impact on the
development of 10 or 12 sites in the past six or seven years.
And it isn't only the developers and wealthy homeowners who
have been touched by the critter. Southampton's plans to
build affordable housing in an area called Tuckahoe were
scuttled after salamanders were discovered.</p>
<p>In March 1988, just before the Southampton Planning Board
was expected to approve a plan for Bridgewood, a 102-acre
subdivision in Bridgehampton that included nine affordable
units, Mr. Sabin turned up a tiger salamander on the
property.</p>
<p>There was only one small problem. No one was there to
witness the find, so Mr. Sabin put the salamander in his
refrigerator overnight before calling a news conference the
next day to announce his find. Town officials who had combed
the site and found no evidence of the salamanders were not
amused; the plan was delayed more than a year until the
developer agreed not to build near the pond where the
salamander was found, and the number of affordable units were
cut by half.</p>
