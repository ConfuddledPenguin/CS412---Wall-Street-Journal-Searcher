	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Nantucket Industries Inc. indicated that it
expects to report fiscal fourth-quarter net income rose 7% on
4% higher sales.
   George J. Gold, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the manufacturer of undergarments and marketer of socks
attributes the improved operating results largely to its
switch of emphasis toward higher-margin apparel it markets
under licensed brand names and away from the Nantucket name.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On an operating basis, the fiscal fourth period "is
usually a loss quarter, and we've got black figures for this
one," Mr. Gold said.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter, ended Feb. 28, Mr. Gold indicated
in an interview that Nantucket will report net income grew to
around $109,000, or five cents a share, from $101,948, or
four cents a share, in the yearearlier period. Sales reached
between $7.6 million and $7.7 million from $7.4 million, he
estimated.</p>
<p>Fiscal 1990 net fell to about $1.6 million, or 66 cents a
share, from $2.1 million, or 81 cents a share, in fiscal
1989. But excluding a $1.6 million special item a year
earlier -- stemming from the June 1988 sale of the hosiery
division to Jockey International Inc. -- earnings for the
year nearly tripled, Mr. Gold said. Sales climbed 15% to
$39.7 million from $34.5 million, he estimated.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1991, Nantucket Industries is looking to boost
sales as much as 17% and net income by an even faster pace,
Mr. Gold said, adding that profit margins are expected to
grow to 5% from 4.6% in the just-ended fiscal year.</p>
<p>Nantucket also maintains lean operations, Mr. Gold said,
noting that selling, general and administrative expenses
remained at around 17% of sales for the third consecutive
year.</p>
<p>Nantucket sells underwear under a number of names,
including Brut and Brittania. Recently, the company added
three names to the roster: Thermos for thermal underwear,
Danskin for socks and McGregor for men's and boys'
undergarments.</p>
<p>Prior to the emphasis on licensing, "we were purely a
ladies-undergarment business," Mr. Gold said. The licensing
"changed the whole complexion" of Nantucket's business: "It's
the same selling operations, except men's goods at a higher
margin."</p>
<p>The big names in the undergarment industry include Fruit
of the Loom and Hanes. "We let them battle it out," Mr. Gold
said, adding, "The big retailers aren't too happy" with the
major manufacturers because price competition keeps profit
margins thin. "We don't attempt to fight on price with them.
We'd be a loser before we start."</p>
<p>Mr. Gold said: "We're more flexible than the big guys. . .
. We move faster. That's a big advantage" as styles change.</p>
<p>Nantucket sold the hosiery division because of differences
with its management and the high capital costs involved in
the business, Mr. Gold said. Daniel Hess, an executive Mr.
Gold hired for the hosiery operation, instead formed
Nantucket's sock-marketing lines.</p>
<p>The sock operation won't require any capital investment
because Nantucket, like much of the industry, will buy the
socks it markets from contractors, Mr. Gold says. He
estimates fiscal 1991 sales from the unit at $6 million to $7
million.</p>
<p>A little more than a year ago, Nantucket fought off a
hostile $8.50-a-share hostile takeover bid from Integrated
Resources Inc. Integrated "completely undervalued" Nantucket,
Mr. Gold said. "As soon as we made the deal with Jockey,"
Integrated "wanted to invade our cash position." Nantucket
bought back Integrated's stake "in the very low $6 {a share}
range," he said.</p>
<p>In the past three years, Nantucket's shares have been as
low as $2.125 and as high as $10.25; they are now about
halfway between the two figures. Mr. Gold said that with
profitable growth -- he hopes to reach $100 million of sales
in the next four years, excluding acquisitions -- the stock
price should follow on.</p>
<p>At the same time, he said, Nantucket is looking for an
acquisition valued at $15 million to $30 million.</p>
<p>Long-term debt fell to $4 million in fiscal 1990 from $5
million a year earlier, and the company's ratio of current
assets to current liabilities is 5 to 1, the executive said.</p>
