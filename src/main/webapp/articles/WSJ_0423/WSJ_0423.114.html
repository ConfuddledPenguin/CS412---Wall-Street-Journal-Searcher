	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Tribune Co., citing widening losses at its New
York Daily News and "continued weakness" at its newsprint
operations, said first-quarter earnings fell 9%, despite a 6%
rise in revenue.
   The media concern posted net of $33.5 million, or 43 cents
a share, down from $36.8 million, or 49 cents a share, a year
earlier. Per-share figures reflect a decrease in average
common shares outstanding to 68.1 million from 74.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue rose to $583.6 million from $552.9 million.</p>
<p>Tribune said operating profit at its newspaper publishing
group fell 10% to $55.7 million. Increased losses at the
Daily News reflect "weak market conditions" as well as costs
associated with continuing contract talks with unionized
workers. The rest of the newspaper group showed increased
operating profit, on the strength of stronger performance at
the Chicago Tribune and lower prices for newsprint.</p>
<p>But those lower prices gave the company's
newsprint-manufacturing group a 63% decline in operating
profit, despite a small increase in revenue.</p>
<p>Tribune's broadcasting and entertainment group, helped by
improved earnings at the company's television stations,
reported operating profit of $6.2 million, compared with a
year-earlier operating loss of $1.4 million.</p>
