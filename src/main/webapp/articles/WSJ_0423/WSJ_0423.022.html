	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- For an insight into Japan's unique brand of
capitalism and culture, you can do worse than a visit to the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. Its landscaped entrance on a quiet side
street and the stylish lobby with its minimalist design are a
far cry from that noisy, bustling trading factory at Broad
and Wall, the New York Stock Exchange. Schoolchildren troop
through a mini-science museum on the gallery floor where
professorial robots and an animated holograph indoctrinate
them into the marvels of Japanese capitalism.
   Down in the pit, clerks in member-firm stalls clap for
attention and wave frantic hand signals to floor clerks. A
clerk holding his nose is saying he is trading Tokyo Gas. He
signals buy or sell and the price with his palm outward or
inward and with finger counts. This tense and vigorous ballet
is a young man's game and some of the clerks seem not much
older than the watching students. When a big buy order comes
in or the electronic display shows the Nikkei stock or TOPIX
futures index edging upward, the clapping becomes applause.
Through this giant pantomime, the pit and a related computer
trading center handle volumes far in excess of those on the
NYSE.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But, as most of the world knows by now, this great heart
of Japanese capitalism has been fibrillating lately. The
Nikkei has dropped sharply from its December peak, the most
since the 1973-1974 oil shock. It didn't slump as badly even
during the world-wide stock crash of October 1987. Late last
week there were some signs of a rally. But what has already
transpired, plus worries about Tokyo's spectacular
real-estate bubble, has stirred the anxiety that lurks just
beneath Japan's self-confidence and maybe accounts for its
enormous success drive. But then, market volatility at the
level Japan has been experiencing would shake confidence
anywhere.</p>
<p>At a dinner high in one of the new skyscrapers of Tokyo's
Shinjuku district, Yoshiji Fukushima, executive vice
president of Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., asks a visitor's
opinion of where the Nikkei is headed. This is Japanese
politeness. Nomura didn't get to be a world securities giant
by soliciting stock-market advice from journalists. But the
question reflects the general concern over the Nikkei's
plunge.</p>
<p>One answer to why the Nikkei slumped is that old,
pre-space-age saying, "What goes up must come down." As
measured by price-earnings ratios, Japanese stocks had soared
to phenomenal heights by the end of last year. A correction
was due. Also, the Tokyo exchange had had some experience
with volatility even before this last year. Even though it
has high trading volumes -- partly attributable to the low
average price of stocks -- the market is relatively thin.
That's because a large portion of the outstanding stock of
most major companies is seldom traded. It sits quietly in the
hands of major institutional holders, who wield large
influence over Japanese industry and the economy. Japanese
commercial banks, for example, hold 20% of the outstanding
stock of firms listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, according
to a Ministry of Finance estimate. Hostile takeovers are well
-- nigh impossible.</p>
<p>But there is a larger problem reflected in Japan's
roller-coaster ride. It can be blamed heavily on efforts by
finance ministers and central bankers of the Group of Seven
(G-7) industrial countries to artificially rig currency
exchange rates so as to alter world trade flows. Aside from
the fact that the desired purposes are seldom achieved, this
distorts capital markets.</p>
<p>The movement of stock prices world-wide is heavily
influenced by expectations of traders about whether a
nation's currency is likely to rise or fall relative to other
currencies. If they think it will rise, they have an
incentive to buy securities denominated in that currency. So
the Nikkei climbed sharply on the strength of the rising yen.
The reverse is equally true. The Nikkei slumped after the
world's monetary officials were unable to hold the yen at its
artificially high level.</p>
<p>Worried Japanese monetary officials want to stop the yen's
decline. They said so at the Paris G-7 meeting two weekends
ago. Other members were sympathetic but told the Japanese
they would have to do most of the fixing. For that reason,
U.S. traders reacted nervously last week to a rumor that the
Japanese Ministry of Finance, referred to here by the
nickname "MOF," was encouraging Japanese institutions to
unload some of their huge holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds.
MOF denies that it plays such games, but that rumor, though
most likely false, had plausibility because dumping U.S.
bonds would be consistent with MOF's desire to improve the
dollar value of the yen. Of course, the institutions also
have a market reason for selling, the strong dollar, so maybe
MOF didn't have to urge them. Yet MOF officials are not above
bragging at times, in good old mercantilist fashion, about
what they could do with Japan's huge dollar reserves. Maybe
less than they think, since bucking market trends by
liquidating reserves is an uncertain business. But further
boosting interest rates -- which have been jacked up four
times in the past year -- also has risks. For one thing,
there is the danger of pricking that real-estate bubble and
doing real damage to banks.</p>
<p>Even now, however, it can be argued that the yen is
overvalued. By measuring the relative purchasing power of the
yen and dollar, some analysts think the dollar should cost
200 yen instead of the current 160. By and large, the yen's
excessive value has been a result of dubious G-7 efforts to
balance world trade. The dollar was devalued and the yen
valued upward in an attempt to make U.S. goods relatively
more attractive in world markets, thereby reducing the U.S.
trade deficit and the Japanese trade surplus.</p>
<p>Maybe this finally is making a dent in the surplus and
deficit, both of which have fallen, but it's hard to credit
something that began five years ago for such results. Indeed,
a strong yen-weak dollar combination initially raises the
dollar value of U.S. imports, heading the deficit higher.
More important, a weak-currency country tends to lose
efficiency, in part because of inflation, whereas a
strong-currency country gains efficiency, because producers
have to become more efficient to compete. Most important of
all is the way artificial exchange rates distort capital
flows, which are vastly larger and in some ways more
economically significant than trade flows.</p>
<p>Because of the huge inflow of dollars into Japan after
dollar devaluation, the Japanese developed an unrealistic
belief that they suddenly had become rich, not unlike Texas
during the S&L boom. With the help of American doomsayers
they attributed it mainly to their superior talents. The
Japanese are good but not that good. They have done nothing
that would have caused the dollar value of the yen to double
in three years. Indeed, their productivity remains well below
that of the U.S., as does their standard of living.</p>
<p>The political consequences of these distorted perceptions
have included a rising resentment of the Japanese in the U.S.
Since the trade deficit didn't go away, the Japanese must be
cheating Americans out of their wealth, goes the argument.
Those schoolchildren at the Tokyo exchange don't know what
really happened, but then neither do a lot of important
people on both sides of the Pacific. Maybe they should try to
find out before some really serious damage occurs.</p>
