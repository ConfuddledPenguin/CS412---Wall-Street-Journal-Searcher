	<p class="article-leader">Shortly after eight o'clock on the evening of Nov. 21,
1974, as patrons chatted comfortably in the warm, smoky
interiors of the Tavern in the Town and the Mulberry Bush,
the two Birmingham pubs were ripped apart by IRA bombs. It
was the largest mass murder in British history, killing 21
and wounding 162. Within hours, six men had been caught,
Irish nationals who soon were dubbed the Birmingham Six. As
the public howled for blood, the six were quickly sentenced
to life in prison, where they remain to this day.
   According to "The Investigation: Inside a Terrorist
Bombing" (HBO, April 25, 11 p.m. EDT, or April 30, 10:15 p.m.
EDT), they were the wrong men. This docudrama tells the story
of a team of reporters (two from "World in Action," Britain's
"60 Minutes," and free-lance journalist Chris Mullin, who
later became a Labor MP) as they set out to track down what
really happened that November night.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The Investigation" travels in familiar Woodward and
Bernstein/"All the President's Men" territory -- and
compelling territory it is, too. Crusading reporters
encounter indifference, skepticism and outright lies as they
try to uncover a web of conspiracy. In this docudrama, as in
real life, the reporters interviewed the accused, the
eyewitnesses and the police; Mullin even ventured into
Dublin's IRA underground to hunt for the "real" bombers.</p>
<p>Along the way, they discovered that the proof against the
Birmingham Six was flimsy at best, relying on shaky
scientific tests, police harrassment and forced confessions.
And they also stumbled on a real scandal, a cover-up
throughout the ranks of the British police, who allegedly
insisted on keeping the Birmingham Six in jail, even when
they knew that others were guilty.</p>
<p>This evidence, presented in part in two Granada TV "World
in Action" shows (1985 and 1986) and in Mr. Mullin's book,
"Error in Judgment," eventually brought about an appeal trial
for the Birmingham Six in 1988. But the judge, citing
witnesses "not worthy of belief," laughed off the idea of a
"conspiracy unprecedented in the annals of criminal history"
and dismissed the appeal. Granada decided to strike back with
a docudrama.</p>
<p>This, then, is not only lively, entertaining television.
It's also propaganda -- admittedly, propaganda with the
finest muckraking journalistic impulses -- but propaganda all
the same. When this film aired in Britain and Ireland a few
weeks ago (under the title "Who Bombed Birmingham?"), it
stirred a major controversy. At issue was the old docudrama
question: What's fact and what's fiction, and how do you tell
the difference? But the debate was all the more fierce
because this film has such a strong point of view, because it
ends with a list of the names of the alleged "real" IRA
bombers. Pundits and legislators screamed about a "gross
abuse of media power" and "trial by television."</p>
<p>Across the Atlantic, away from the heated emotions, it's
interesting to dissect "The Investigation." This film has an
ax to grind, and it grinds it hard. There's nothing even
remotely balanced about the docudrama, no sense of why the
police or anyone in authority acted the way they did. "The
Investigation" is manipulation of the most powerful kind -- a
cry of outrage in the form of an exciting story, as with
Costa-Gavras's "Z" or "Missing," a morality play with
underdogs fighting a callous, suspect system.</p>
<p>Ethical considerations aside, I found it impossible not to
get swept up in "The Investigation." It sets off at a
breakneck pace and never stops. From bombing to investigation
to trial and beyond, it has the relentless energy, the
page-turning drive of any good thriller.</p>
<p>Of course, in the breathless rush, not everything makes
sense. Cutting from 1974 to 1985 to the present, the story
can be extremely disorienting. Sources pop up from out of the
blue. Timings (of bombings, of phone calls, of police
interrogations) play a major role, but it's hard to
understand exactly what that role is. And there are out and
out logical inconsistencies, devices thrown in to drive the
story that don't make sense. Right at the outset, for
example, a Granada producer is looking at footage saying,
"Anybody want to tell me what's going on?" Which is a fine
device to start the docudrama, except the producer is looking
at his own segment. He doesn't understand what's going on?</p>
<p>Characters also get sacrificed. There may be real people
here -- the reporters, the Birmingham Six -- but we never get
to know them. There may be some good actors here too -- John
Hurt, Martin Shaw -- but there isn't much room for acting.</p>
<p>Story is everything. The crusade is everything. As the
pale, emaciated Mr. Hurt conducts his investigation, we have
almost no sense of what drives him, who he is. How much
stronger "The Investigation" would have been if we had a
sense of Mullin as an appealing hero, not a stick figure in a
morality play.</p>
<p>In the end, "The Investigation" is more than a little
slapdash. It raises more than its share of troubling ethical
issues. But it tries so hard to correct an injustice, its
crusade is so noble, so heartfelt, I'm prepared to give it
the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>And it moves like a breakneck car ride out of Belfast.</p>
