	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Shiite radicals in Lebanon freed one of
their American hostages, but U.S. officials said that doesn't
necessarily open the door for rapid release of the seven
others.
   Nor does the release necessarily pave the way for warmer
U.S. relations with Iran, whose Islamic government inspires
the Lebanese Shiites holding Western hostages. President Bush
indicated he won't make substantial gestures of gratitude
until all the American hostages are freed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Robert Polhill, 55 years old, a teacher at Beirut
University College, was turned over to Syrian officials in
Beirut yesterday afternoon and driven to Damascus. Mr.
Polhill had been in captivity since a Shiite group called
Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine kidnapped him
and two other educators on Jan. 24, 1987.</p>
<p>U.S. officials insisted that they didn't do any bargaining
or make any concessions to win freedom for Mr. Polhill. A
senior State Department official called it an "unconditional
release."</p>
<p>Iran, which seems to want to remove the hostage issue as
an obstacle to winning more economic cooperation from the
West, paved the way for the release by sending a series of
public and private signals to the hostage holders during the
past few months that it finally wanted to end the issue. But
Syria, which is working to improve its relations with the
West as its backing from the Soviet Union wanes, played the
major role in arranging details of the release, senior U.S.
officials said.</p>
<p>In fact, there was a last-minute debate among U.S.
officials about whether the White House should publicly thank
Iran at all for its role or simply thank Syria. In the end,
the White House composed a statement thanking both Syria and
Iran for their roles, but in remarks to reporters, Mr. Bush
said, "I can't tell you I honestly know" what Iran's role was
in the release.</p>
<p>The problem for the U.S. now is that the release of one
hostage will raise public expectations about freedom for all.
And the release of just one captive may make the rest of the
hostage problem even tougher for the Bush administration to
handle.</p>
<p>Specifically, both the Lebanese captors and Iran's leaders
may look for some gesture of gratitude from the U.S. before
freeing other hostages. But American officials said Mr.
Bush's offer to show "good will" toward those who help free
hostages doesn't apply until all U.S. hostages are out.
Doling out rewards -- such as moving faster to settling
disputes over frozen Iranian assets -- after just one hostage
release would smack of paying off the captors, U.S. officials
fear.</p>
<p>President Bush signaled as much yesterday. "I'm not
looking for gestures," he told a group of reporters. "I'm
looking for the release of our hostages -- and by our
hostages I mean all of them."</p>
<p>But freeing the others won't be easily accomplished
because it requires working with a labyrinth of terrorist
groups and demands. Though all the groups holding hostages
are believed to be loosely affiliated with Hezbollah, a
pro-Iranian Lebanese Shiite organization, they have a variety
of demands.</p>
<p>The group that freed Mr. Polhill, the Islamic Jihad for
the Liberation of Palestine, still holds two more Americans.
It has demanded the release of hundreds of Shiite prisoners
held in Israel, particularly the release of a leading Shiite
cleric, Shiek Abdel Karim Obeid, kidnapped by Israel last
year.</p>
<p>Other groups have held Americans even longer and made
tougher demands. Two Americans -- including the hostage held
longest, journalist Terry Anderson -- are held by a group
called Islamic Jihad. Its main demand has been that Kuwait
free a group of Shiite extremists it arrested for a series of
terrorist bombings. The Kuwaiti government hasn't shown any
interest in releasing extremists, and the U.S. has refused to
pressure Kuwait, arguing that it would amount to knuckling
under to terrorist demands.</p>
<p>Another group holding Americans is the so-called
Revolutionary Justice Organization. It has held hostages
mostly in hopes of trading them for guarantees that Hezbollah
militiamen will be allowed to operate freely in southern
Lebanon -- guarantees that can't be provided by the U.S. but
only by Syria, whose army controls much of Lebanon.</p>
<p>The big factor working to the administration's advantage
is the apparent cooperation of Syria and Iran in ending the
hostage crisis. Syria seems to be accommodating in part
because its economy is in the doldrums and its longtime
patron, the Soviet Union, has ceased being a reliable
supplier of arms. Moreover, Syrian President Hafez al Assad
also may see an opportunity to win favor with the U.S. and
become the dominant figure in the Arab world at a time when
his arch-enemy, Iraq, has been caught trying to illegally
import nuclear technology and weapons from the U.S. and
Britain.</p>
<p>Iran also appears interested in economics. Its president,
Hashemi Rafsanjani, apparently wants greater Western
cooperation in rebuilding the Iranian economy, torn apart by
the long war with Iraq.</p>
<p>Specifically, Mr. Rafsanjani probably is hoping for
greater British and German help in rebuilding important oil
facilities damaged by the war. Also, an end to the hostage
crisis might speed a settlement of billions of dollars in
claims that have been outstanding between Iran and the U.S.
since the 1979 Iranian revolution.</p>
<p>Iran still has hundreds of millions of dollars deposited
in escrow accounts set up to provide funds for settling
claims by U.S. companies and individuals who lost property in
the revolution. In addition, Iran has claimed it is owed $11
billion for undelivered or defective military equipment from
the U.S. -- a figure that American officials consider wildly
exaggerated.</p>
