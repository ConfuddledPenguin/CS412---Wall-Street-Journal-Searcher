	<p class="article-leader">For many years the U.S. government has lavished foreign
aid and military hardware on Israel. A good deal of that
hardware has been used against Arab Palestinians. On July 3,
1988, the U.S. did something else. U.S. Navy Capt. Will
Rogers ordered his ship to fire missiles at what turned out
to be an Iranian airliner on a routine passenger flight. The
missiles blew the plane apart, killing 290 men, women and
children aboard.
   One result, not surprisingly, was an act of revenge: the
downing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21,
1988. It is the investigation of this terrorist act that is
the subject of "The Fall of Pan Am 103: Inside the Lockerbie
Investigation" (Putnam, 304 pages, $21.95), by Steven Emerson
and Brian Duffy. Mr. Emerson has written books and articles
dealing with national-security issues; Mr. Duffy is an editor
at U.S. News & World Report.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As chronicled by the authors, the Iranians contracted out
their revenge to a hit squad, also known as the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Based in
Damascus, this group has long fought Israel, and apparently
was more than happy to attack Israel's major ally and arms
supplier, the U.S. The man who played the pivotal role in
arranging the retaliatory bombing was Hafez Dalkamouni, a
one-legged veteran of attacks aimed at Israel. It was
Dalkamouni's European network, say the authors, that
concealed the bomb in a Toshiba radio and put it aboard Pan
Am 103 in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>The investigation of the resulting explosion turned out to
be a combination of basic police work by Scottish police, the
FBI and West German authorities, supported by esoteric
intelligence analyses done at a variety of agencies. As the
authors put it, to solve this one "the cops needed the spies,
and the spies needed the cops." The book chronicles how both
cops and spies have moved around Europe during the past year,
chasing bits of clothes and matching up batches of plastic
explosives, all with the aim of unraveling Dalkamouni's
organization and accumulating enough evidence to prosecute
the bombers. Dalkamouni himself, now jailed in West Germany
on other charges -- conspiring to blow up U.S. troop trains
-- almost surely will be indicted for the bombing.</p>
<p>Though the basic facts in the case have been printed in
various publications and aired on some TV documentaries, the
authors provide a greater depth of detail as they skillfully
weave together a massive collection of facts and theories.
Unfortunately, the book also shows some signs of haste. On
page 106 Mohammed Rashid, a terrorist who placed a bomb
aboard another Pan Am jet in 1982, is killed off; on page 272
we find he is still alive, residing in a Greek jail. In
another instance, the sequence in which bombs were placed on
two Pan Am jets in 1982 is reversed, disrupting the
chronology of these incidents.</p>
<p>The most controversial aspect of the book is likely to
stem from the charge that West German authorities botched an
investigation of the PFLP-GC in fall 1988, unwittingly
allowing the bomb and the bomber to slip through their
clutches. The West Germans did arrest Dalkamouni and another
terrorist, but a West German judge freed others in the gang
for lack of evidence. The West Germans then tried to cover up
their mistakes by refusing to cooperate with the FBI, the
authors say. There is even a suggestion, attributed to
unnamed Israeli and Western officials, that the West Germans
were more or less willing to tolerate PFLP-GC terrorism so
long as the group didn't strike West German targets.</p>
<p>But if the West Germans did botch some aspects of the
investigation, that surely was not by intent -- one of their
own men was killed trying to disarm another bomb secreted
inside one of Dalkamouni's radio tuners. Were the West
Germans misled by some of their own informants? Did the West
German law enforcement and intelligence apparatus fail to
coordinate sufficiently, as U.S. agencies often fail to do?
Did personalities play a part in West German reluctance to
cooperate with the FBI? (The irascible FBI man who
effectively ran the agency's investigation of Pan Am 103 has
antagonized more than one official in recent years.) Is there
some other explanation for flaws in the West Germans' work?</p>
<p>The answer is, we don't know. The authors, who seem to
have gotten much of their story from the angry FBI official
(and almost none of it from the West Germans), don't seem to
know either. The West Germans may well be getting hit with
some unfair criticism.</p>
<p>There is another piece of unfinished business in this
affair. When Capt. Rogers shot the Iranian airliner down, the
jet was on a scheduled flight, it was flying in the proper
civilian air corridor and its radio was squawking its
identity on the correct civilian frequency (despite stories
to the contrary initially put out by Washington). On the face
of it, Capt. Rogers negligently failed to take proper care in
identifying his target, and so wrongly concluded it was a
military jet trying to bomb his ship. The question is whether
he should be court-martialed. Would there be a court-martial
if that jet had been a Pan Am plane full of Americans?</p>
