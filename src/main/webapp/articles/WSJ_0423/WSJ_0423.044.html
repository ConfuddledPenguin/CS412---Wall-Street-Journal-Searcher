	<p class="article-leader">DENVER -- Manville Corp. reported lower first-quarter
earnings, largely because of a charge to reflect tax changes
in Brazil, on a 2% increase in sales.
   The building products concern reported net income of $24.9
million, or 18 cents a share, compared with $34.3 million, or
26 cents a share, the year earlier. The company said flat
year-to-year pretax earnings were offset by an $8.5 million,
or seven-cents-a-share charge, to adjust for tax legislation
recently enacted in Brazil, where the company has
forest-products operations. Sales increased to $517.9
million, from $508.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Expenses from plant start-ups and expansions, in addition
to a fall-off in automotive sales, cut income in the
company's fiber glass business. But strength in the company's
international forest products operation offset weaknesses in
domestic construction sales, the company said.</p>
<p>In an unrelated matter, Manville said it is considering
the sale of its 50% interest in the Stillwater platinum and
palladium mining operations in southwest Montana. Manville
and Chevron Resources Co. are partners in the mine, which is
the only platinum mine in the U.S. and one of the few in the
world.</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers has been retained to solicit bids for the
property about which, Manville said, it has recently received
several unsolicited inquiries. The company has stated it is
seeking to focus its efforts on its core businesses of
filtration, forest and glass-fiber products.</p>
