	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL -- Disgruntled stock investors, shouting "Down with
{President} Roh Tae-woo," demonstrated Friday to protest the
lack of government measures to boost the sagging South Korean
market, witnesses said.
   Police said they arrested eight protesters.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At least two people were injured when about 200 investors
began hurling stacks of papers, booklets and chairs at
several stock trading offices in Seoul, the witnesses said.</p>
<p>The composite index, the main measure of the Korea Stock
Exchange, has been falling sharply in the past several days,
dropping to 767.45 Friday, the lowest level since November
1988.</p>
<p>Analysts blamed the market's decline on the sluggish
economy. Exports, on which the Korean economy depends
heavily, fell nearly 3% in the quarter ended March 31 from a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Despite the gloomy economic outlook, the government ruled
out any short-term measures to boost the market.</p>
