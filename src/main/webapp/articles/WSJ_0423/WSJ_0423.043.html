	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Investor Harold Simmons and NL Industries Inc.
agreed to sell the stub stock and debt they will receive from
Georgia Gulf Corp.'s recapitalization for the equivalent of
$14 a share, Michael A. Snetzer, a top Simmons aide, said.
   Through NL, Mr. Simmons owns 2,300,200 shares of Georgia
Gulf, or a 9.6% stake, purchased at an average price of about
$37 a share. Under Georgia Gulf's planned recapitalization,
approved last week by its shareholders, holders will receive
$30 cash, a share of stub stock and some debt for each share
outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Simmons's transaction would give him $44 cash for each
of his shares, or a profit of $16.1 million on his Georgia
Gulf investment. The sale of securities is on a when-issued
basis, meaning it is contingent on Georgia Gulf completing
its recapitalization.</p>
<p>Georgia Gulf has said that it hopes to complete the
recapitalization soon. Georgia Gulf, an Atlanta chemicals
concern, proposed the transaction after Mr. Simmons offered
to acquire the company or help it recapitalize last year.</p>
<p>Mr. Simmons made several offers for Georgia Gulf,
including a $45 a share, or $1 billion, tender offer, before
agreeing to support Georgia Gulf's proposal. Mr. Simmons said
he withdrew his tender offer because he estimated that the
recapitalization had a value of at least $45 a share.</p>
<p>Mr. Snetzer, who is president of Valhi Inc., Mr. Simmons'
holding company, said he doesn't know the buyer or buyers of
the stub stock and debt, but said the transaction will be
handled by Jefferies & Co. NL is a Houston-based specialty
chemicals company.</p>
