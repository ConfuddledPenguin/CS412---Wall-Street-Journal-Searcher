	<p class="article-leader">When King Camp Gillette founded a company in his name in
1903, he changed forever the way men shaved. In the 1930s,
long before quality became a global buzz word, Gillette
manufactured it into its blades. But Gillette's quality and
dominance in the market is no guarantee of success for
product introduction. It has fallen on its face more than
once. That's why Gillette's latest entry into the
marketplace, the Sensor, is fast becoming a classic
management and marketing success story.
   When Sensor was announced last fall, many business writers
labeled it a "you-bet-your-company" gamble. It was not. In
actual fact, the risk was minimal because Gillette had done
its homework. Since the 1950s, when it temporarily lost
considerable market share to an import stainless steel blade,
it has made a continuous substantial commitment to research
and development. The secret to its reduced risk new product
introductions is close contact with the consumer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is estimated that Gillette spoke with upward of 10,000
men during the design phase of the Sensor. Further, it shave
tested the product in-house for years on a panel of 500
employees who dutifully (voluntarily) came to work each day
unshaven. When the testing of its Sensor system produced a
rating of roughly 20% or better increased superiority over
both its existing products (which hold a 62% market share)
and all competitors, Gillette then made the decision to
launch the product as its latest leap forward.</p>
<p>Once technological performance and superiority were
achieved and verified, it was then necessary to bring the
product to the marketplace in such a way as to take full
advantage of all the work done thus far. What was needed was
a person to lead that effort.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Gillette's management team was not known
for its leadership talent. It barely survived two hostile
takeovers which hinged on this perceived deficiency. Profits
had eroded in the U.S. market because of an aggressive move
by Bic in the late 1970s to change the rules of the
competition to a contest of disposable, bulk packed, low cost
shavers. Even though Gillette had preemptively brought out
its Good News disposable in anticipation of Bic's U.S.
introduction, it had failed to decisively beat back the
French companies' challenge.</p>
<p>There was one marketplace where Gillette successfully
maintained profits against Bic, and that, paradoxically
enough, was Europe. There, for some reason, Gillette systems
(non-disposables) were holding market share. Gillette
determined that the reason was most likely the actions of its
man in London, John Simons. A 20-year company veteran, he was
virtually unknown in Boston (world headquarters) -- except by
his results.</p>
<p>Mr. Simons took his tested European marketing strategy and
applied it immediately upon arrival in the U.S. to Gillette's
products, well prior to the Sensor introduction. He shifted
all advertising to one theme and one product. He concentrated
on Gillette's Atra Plus system and on the theme of it being
"the best there is."</p>
<p>When Sensor was ready, he did not change the advertising,
just the product. The message that had won him the market in
Europe was now being sent around the world, literally. The
commercials were all done with voice-over narrations so that
they could be done in any language. Sensor is advertised in
Japan with the same visuals and dialogue used in the U.S. and
Europe. It has gained market share there as it has everywhere
else. It is proving itself (and its marketing strategy) to be
a global success.</p>
<p>The first U.S. commercials ran on the Super Bowl in
January. Four million razors were sold into the trade and
were in the stores when the campaign broke. Launch quantities
were gone in record time. The factory in South Boston,
already working three shifts, further increased personnel and
accelerated orders for additional equipment. The European
facility in Berlin made similar upward adjustments as planned
product introductions in several additional countries were
temporarily delayed and advertising was rescheduled
accordingly.</p>
<p>Because the Sensor has so many moving parts, design
patents, plus manufacturing complexities requiring an
extensive investment in custom capital equipment and such a
head start in global marketing, it is anticipated that it
will take competitors like Schick (a traditional follower
behind Gillette) some time to come up with anything in the
same league as Sensor. Bic, its disposable nemesis, has never
shown any indication of wanting to compete in any product
where it has not established itself as a technologically
comparable or superior manufacturer. It remains to be seen if
they attempt to rise to Gillette's challenge or remain
content with their disposable shaver market niche.</p>
<p>The management lessons to be learned, even at this early
stage, are many. Long-term research and development programs
do pay off. Big companies can come up with meaningful
innovations, even on well-established products. There is no
substitute for leadership -- there must be a "man on the
ground" to inspire the troops and get things done. Going far
afield to find the right person who has proven himself is a
strong strategy. Global marketing works. A consistent,
powerful advertising message delivered in sufficient
"tonnage" backed by a product of the highest quality always
has been a basic of marketing and is proving its validity
once again on a grand scale. A quality product can be
manufactured anywhere in the world, even in economically
underdeveloped regions of the world, like South Boston.</p>
<p>Sensor appears to be a classic example of all of the
above. Some say that it will take another six months or year
to determine if the product is a success, but stock price
already has increased 10% since introduction. If history is
indeed prologue, the next chapter should be a consumer
product barn burner.</p>
