and to pay $600 million in fines and restitution, the largest
criminal settlement ever. Friday's decision by Drexel's
former junk-bond chief came just before a grand jury was to
indict him on insider trading, bribery and other charges.
It's unclear how much Milken will cooperate with federal
investigators in implicating others.
