	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Newspaper publishers are being pushed to
increase their use of recycled newsprint.
   Here for the annual meeting of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association, publishers are being asked to
increase their use of recycled material to as much as 28% of
their total newsprint consumption by 1992. Currently, use of
recycled newsprint varies by newspaper, but it is estimated
that most daily newspapers use less than 15% of their total
in recycled newsprint.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move toward recycled newsprint already is taking hold.
Today, the Boston Globe's edition will be published entirely
on recycled newsprint. The Globe had planned to publish its
Sunday edition -- on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day -- but
couldn't get enough recycled paper for the larger Sunday
edition. The Globe, published by Affiliated Publications
Inc., regularly produces about 8% of its papers with recycled
newsprint. On Friday, Gannett Co.'s USA Today published a
24-page `Earth Day 1990' section entirely on recycled
newsprint.</p>
<p>Meeting Saturday, the ANPA board of directors set the 28%
consumption level and asked publishers to demand as much
recycled newsprint from North American newsprint mills as
they are capable of producing.</p>
<p>Supplies of recycled newsprint remain a problem. ANPA
estimates fewer than 10 of the existing 60 U.S. and Canadian
paper mills have the ability to produce recycled newsprint.</p>
