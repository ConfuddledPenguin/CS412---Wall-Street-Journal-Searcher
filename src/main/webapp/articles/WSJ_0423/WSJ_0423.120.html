	<p class="article-leader">Mitsui & Co. Ltd. revised its revenue forecast for the
fiscal year ended March 31 to 20.1 trillion yen ($128.2
billion), from 18.2 trillion yen forecast earlier.
   In fiscal 1989, the company had revenue of 14.828 trillion
yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A company spokesman cited dollar-denominated export and
import contracts for boosting revenue, as the Japanese yen
slid considerably against the U.S. currency.</p>
<p>Favorable contracts on chemical plants, as well as on
electric machineries, also pushed revenue higher, he said.</p>
<p>The spokesman also ascribed the upward revision partly to
gold trading reflecting the popularity of gold investment in
Japan.</p>
<p>The company left its forecast for pretax profit and net
income unchanged, standing at 62 billion yen and 21 billion
yen, respectively, in part because of the slim profit margins
from gold transactions.</p>
<p>In fiscal 1989, pretax profit was 54.89 billion yen, while
net income came to 16.61 billion yen.</p>
