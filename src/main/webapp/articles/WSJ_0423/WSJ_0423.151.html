	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- West German stock prices'
powerful rise since the East European overhaul process got
into full swing last November should flatten, leading them to
fluctuate around current levels through the second quarter
before resuming an upward track later in the year, analysts
said.
   Stock prices on balance may have risen too far too fast,
they said. And amid uncertainty about the contemplated German
monetary union and its effects on West German interest rates,
inflation and the West German mark, the analysts said,
operators probably will be quick to take profits on
short-term jumps in stock prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The {stock} market from a price-earnings standpoint is
somewhat overextended, as well as from the perspective of
relative yields against interest rate investments," said
Walter Heinemann, head of research at Merck, Finck & Co., a
Munich-based investment banking firm.</p>
<p>But the potential for a sustained slide in prices is just
as limited as that for a major increase in the next three
months, analysts said. Few investors are willing to pull out
of the West German market, because the reconstruction of East
Germany offers a big economic push for West Germany and
promises hundreds of billions of marks in potential sales for
Western companies in the next several years, they said.</p>
<p>"It's a question of risks, and we wouldn't want to run the
risk of being out of the West German market," said Andrew
Thomson, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London.</p>
<p>Even the emotionally charged buying sentiment in Frankfurt
in recent months, on euphoria from German reunification
prospects, probably won't be able alone to sustain the recent
pace of price growth that took the weighted German Stock
Index, or DAX, up 10% from the beginning of the year to a
historical peak of 1968.55 on March 30. The DAX rose 35% in
1989, ending the year at 1790.37. It finished Friday at
1884.33.</p>
<p>"Although we retain our positive stance towards the {West
German stock} market in our longer-term view, we are now,
however, looking for a period of cooling off, accompanied by
a measure of profit-taking in selected areas," analysts at
Swiss Bank Corp.'s London equities research group wrote.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast that the DAX will fluctuate between 1850
and 2000 in the next couple of months. "If anything goes
wrong with the {German} monetary and economic union, we could
very easily see the market go down 10% to 15%," Mr. Heinemann
of Merck Finck said.</p>
<p>The construction sector appears to be one of those best
positioned to capture substantial new business in Eastern
Europe. Builders and engineering and materials supply
companies are moving to expand productive capacity that
already is being tested by West Germany's own building boom.
Builders such as Hochtief AG and Philipp Holzmann AG and
suppliers such as Heidelberger Zement AG and Dyckerhoff AG
are likely winners from a longer-term perspective, analysts
said. But they added that after rising steeply in recent
months, stocks of these companies probably are in for some
more profit-taking.</p>
<p>Analysts also are high on Siemens AG, which has strong
earnings in its main businesses in electronics, computers and
telecommunications. The company has been arranging joint
ventures with East German monopolies and has secured major
contracts to help upgrade the East German telecommunications
network. Siemens, also one of the world's largest builders
and outfitters of power plants, stands to benefit from
anticipated East German investment in such projects.</p>

<p>World Market Activity</p>
<p>Tokyo shares finished lower Friday, after profit-taking
depressed prices of steel and shipbuilding stocks, though
equities were up from midday lows, leaving a large number of
stocks higher.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index of 225 issues fell 109.97 points to
29835.44, after gains in the two previous sessions. First
section volume was estimated at 700 million shares, down from
908 million shares a day earlier.</p>
<p>In early trading Monday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index rose
47.88 points to 29883.32.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Tokyo Stock Price Index, or Topix, of all
first section issues, which surged 45.53 points Thursday,
rose 0.67 point to 2214.16.</p>
<p>Friday's market performance was watched closely, as prices
haven't had three consecutive daily gains since early March.
Until Friday, stock prices had fallen back sharply on days
following two consecutive sharp daily gains.</p>
<p>The decline Friday didn't cause serious damage to the
market, traders said, as participants are more relaxed
because of the widespread expectation the dollar won't rise
far above the 160-yen level. But at the same time, Friday's
results convinced many participants that the market faces
strong resistance around 30000 and 31000 points on the
Nikkei.</p>
<p>In London, share prices finished a drab session slightly
firmer Friday, amid a dearth of trading influences. Shares
were largely mixed during most of the session, as dealers
complained of a lack of investor interest in the middle of
the long three-week trading account.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30-share index was up 0.4 point at
1712.6. Volume was a modest 410.7 million shares, compared
with 491.9 million a day earlier. The 100-share index rose
2.4 points to 2187.1.</p>
<p>Market participants also suggested that investors steered
clear of the market after the brokerage firm Warburg
Securities warned Friday that British inflation could exceed
10% in April. The nation's March inflation rate was 8.1%.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on Friday, stock prices closed higher in Paris,
Frankfurt, Brussels, Amsterdam and Stockholm, and lower in
Milan. Prices in Zurich were mixed. In Paris, stocks climbed
to a record, as institutions beefed up their positions for
the start of the May trading account. Stockholm equity prices
soared in slow trading, boosted by Swedish trade data that
were better than expected.</p>
<p>Share prices closed lower in Sydney, Singapore and Manila,
were mixed in Hong Kong and Seoul, and ended higher in
Wellington and Taipei.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
