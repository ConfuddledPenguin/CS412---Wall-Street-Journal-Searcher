	<p class="article-leader">The Texas State Board of Insurance staff informed
Torchmark Corp. that its proxy fight against American General
Corp. may violate state law, but Torchmark vowed to proceed,
anyway.
   In a letter, the deputy commissioner of the board's legal
and compliance section warned Torchmark that the board will
consider the Birmingham, Ala., insurer to have obtained
"control" of American General if it acquires at American
General's annual meeting on May 2, proxies representing 10%
or more of the power to vote.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under Texas state law, a company must obtain permission
from the insurance commissioner before acquiring control of a
Texas insurance company. Torchmark hasn't sought such
permission.</p>
<p>Torchmark, which launched its proxy battle after dropping
an unsolicited $50-a-share, or $6.3 billion, offer for its
much-bigger rival, had argued that the vote solicitation
wouldn't lead to control because it was merely attempting to
place five "independent" directors on American General's
15-member board.</p>
<p>Noting that it has the right to appeal the decision to the
Texas insurance commissioner under two sections of state law,
Torchmark said it intends to pursue, if necessary, one of
those alternatives "at the appropriate time."</p>
<p>"We believe that it is wrong for American General to spend
time and money in an attempt to deny their shareholders the
opportunity to vote for the independent nominees," Torchmark
said. "We, however, fully intend to continue with our proxy
solicitation."</p>
<p>The Houston insurer, meanwhile, criticized Torchmark for
failing to clear its nomination with state regulators, who
are charged with protecting the interests of policyholders.
"We believe that the process that the state regulators are
pursuing in order to determine whether to grant approval will
also provide both regulators and policyholders an opportunity
to understand Torchmark's intentions," American General said.</p>
<p>The Texas decision represents the latest round in a
bruising regulatory fight being waged in almost a dozen
states where American General has subsidiaries. So far,
regulators in California and Virginia have declined to block
the proxy solicitation, while authorities in Tennessee and
New York have warned Torchmark that they consider the
solicitation an attempt to obtain control of American General
without obtaining required approvals.</p>
<p>The two insurance companies have also battled in federal
court. A U.S. district judge in Houston initially blocked
Torchmark from nominating its five directors, but the
decision was overturned by a federal appeals court.</p>
