	<p class="article-leader">How's this for a sales pitch? You invest $50 a month for
15 years. You pay sales commissions, plus custodial and
maintenance fees, of 51.5% on your first 13 installment
payments and 7.2% on each monthly payment after that. In
return, you get to invest with one of the industry's
worst-rated mutual fund groups.
   Not impressed? Nor was Maine's Securities Division, which
has just completed a study of the "periodic payment" mutual
fund plans sold in the state by First Investors Corp., New
York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Maine didn't like what it saw: Unsophisticated investors
paying fat commissions to become holders of First Investors'
junk bond funds.</p>
<p>"We were in disbelief that these things could actually be
legal," says Stephen Diamond, Maine's securities
administrator. Maine hasn't yet banned any periodic payment
plans. But it looks as if those plans that charge hefty
upfront commissions will no longer be welcome in the state.
Other states may join the crackdown.</p>
<p>Contractual plans for mutual funds have been around for
decades. They typically lock investors into making monthly
payments for 10 or 15 years. The idea is that the hefty
commissions paid on early installments act as an incentive so
that ill-disciplined investors stick with their plans.</p>
<p>Concerned that investors were unaware of the charges
involved, Congress amended the Investment Company Act in
1970, making it easier for investors to get out of
contractual plans while avoiding exorbitant commissions.
Following the 1970 amendment, the fund industry soured on
contractual plans.</p>
<p>Today, only a handful of fund companies still offer them.
Fidelity Investments is the biggest player, and First
Investors is probably the second largest plan sponsor. Like
First Investors, Fidelity charges hefty fees on early
installment payments. Fidelity's contractual plan business
consists of just two stock funds, Destiny I and Destiny II,
with combined assets of $1.9 billion. Both are run by star
fund manager George Vanderheiden.</p>
<p>First Investors earlier this year withdrew an application
with Maine's securities division to renew its registration in
the state. But First Investors President David Grayson says
the firm will reapply.</p>
<p>"We have letters from people saying `thank you for putting
me into this program,' " Mr. Grayson says. "There are people
who drop out, certainly. But that happens in all walks of
life. There's nothing wrong with a concept that allows people
to build up a nest egg for later on."</p>
<p>Maine's Mr. Diamond wasn't just alarmed by the huge
upfront fees charged by contractual plans. He was also
concerned with the way First Investors was aggressively
hiring inexperienced salesmen in Maine, quickly training them
and then sending them out to sell mutual funds.</p>
<p>The Maine study looked at 447 plans set up in the state in
1986.</p>
<p>Under the 1970 amendment, investors get two chances to
withdraw from a contractual plan within the first 18 months.
Those who do so can get back all or part of the commission
they paid. Maine's study found that only 15% of investors
took that route.</p>
<p>The study labeled another 40% of plans as still active,
taking the view that a plan was active even if an investor
was as many as 12 installment payments behind schedule. If
these investors persist with their payments until the plan's
termination in 10 or 15 years, the top sales charge paid
would be 9% of the total amount invested -- the legal maximum
sales charge.</p>
<p>But because investors pay a disproportionate amount of
that sales charge during the first year, the sales charge can
turn out to be a lot more than 9%, if an investor doesn't
complete his contractual plan.</p>
<p>Maine found that a lot of investors fell into that
category. By early 1990, 44% of the original 447 investors
had stopped making regular investments. Some of this group
had redeemed their investment, but hadn't used the two escape
clauses authorized by Congress.</p>
<p>The average number of monthly installments paid by this
group was 19. For somebody using the $100-a-month plan that
lasts 15 years, that means they lost 37% of their investment
to commissions and other charges -- with no chance of a
rebate. Because of a low persistence rate, many investors had
ended up paying commissions much higher than 9%.</p>
<p>Even First Investors' salesmen seemed none too keen on the
plans. Salesmen set up 17 plans for themselves in 1986, but
only two of these plans were still active by early 1990.</p>
<p>So where did Maine's investors choose to put their money?
More than 70% ended up in First Investors Fund for Income or
First Investors High Yield Fund, two of the poorer-performing
junk bond funds. (First Investors also offered three other
funds to Maine's investors; a better-than-average global
stock fund and two mediocre bond funds, a government mortgage
fund and an insured tax-exempt fund.)</p>
<p>Overall, First Investors' funds are lousy performers.
Boston-based mutual fund analysts Kanon Bloch Carre & Co.
rates fund groups by looking at the performance of each of
their funds over four time horizons and then comparing that
performance with comparable funds. First Investors gets Kanon
Bloch's second-lowest rating, putting it in the bottom 10% of
all fund groups.</p>
<p>First Investors has total mutual fund assets of $4
billion, but only $410 million of that comes from contractual
plans. The firm employs 2,500 salesmen nationwide, who
receive an average of more than two months' training before
they start selling the firm's mutual funds. Mr. Grayson
concedes that the salesmen may be inexperienced when hired,
but says 90% are college graduates.</p>
<p>Mr. Grayson says his salesmen make sure that investors are
well aware of the costs involved in a contractual plan, and
that there is no particular incentive for a salesman to push
one of the firm's junk bond funds.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter to a sales representative whether he
sells a high-yield fund or a tax-exempt fund or a growth fund
or a global fund," says Mr. Grayson. "If somebody comes into
our funds and doesn't make payments, that doesn't do us any
good. We're trying to accumulate assets."</p>
<p>According to Mr. Grayson, two-thirds of the sales
commissions go to the sales force. First Investors gets the
other third, but Mr. Grayson says the money doesn't cover its
sales costs.</p>
<p>Maine's Mr. Diamond says his office will look closely at
other contractual plans when they file their annual renewal
applications. "We can deny a registration statement for
excessive seller's compensation or because the offering is
being offered on terms that are unjust, unfair or
inequitable," he says.</p>
<p>Maine's report has caught the attention of other state
securities officials. "After reading about First Investors,
we're looking at all mutual fund periodic payment plans,"
says Andrea Bennett, the Montana state auditor and
commissioner of securities. "I know it's going to be a big
issue here in Montana. What we're going to require is that
the commission paid by investors is less than 9%."</p>
<p>A committee of the North American Securities
Administrators Association is going to study Maine's report,
and may draft a model rule that limits the amount of
commission levied on early installment payments. That rule
could then be adopted by state securities regulators.
California and Wisconsin already have rules effectively
barring periodic payment plans.</p>
