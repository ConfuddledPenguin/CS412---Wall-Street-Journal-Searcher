	<p class="article-leader">TAIPEI -- Export orders for Taiwanese products increased
to $5.93 billion in March, up 18% from February but down 5.2%
from March 1989, the Economics Ministry said.
   The ministry said the higher number of working days in
March contributed to the monthly gain. Furthermore, March
usually is a big month for export orders, it said.</p>
