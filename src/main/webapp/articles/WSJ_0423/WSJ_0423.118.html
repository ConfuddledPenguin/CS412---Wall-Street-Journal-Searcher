	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Rorer Group is gung-ho about its pending union
with Rhone-Poulenc. But skeptics are saying, "Show me."
   At a recent meeting of analysts in New York, Rorer
Chairman Robert Cawthorn painted a glowing picture of the
newest global pharmaceuticals power that will soon be created
by merging Fort Washington, Pa.-based Rorer with the drug
businesses of the French chemical and drug giant
Rhone-Poulenc. Mr. Cawthorn predicted sales after 1991 will
grow 50% to nearly $6 billion in 1994, while profit, after
big layoffs and other savings, will zoom to $11 a share in
1994 from an estimated $4.86 in 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I think it generates some interesting estimated stock
prices," Mr. Cawthorn said, according to a transcript of the
meeting. His target for Rhone-Poulenc Rorer stock, which will
be publicly traded, is $98.26 in the third year of the
merger. Mr. Cawthorn will be chief executive officer of the
new company, though French government-owned Rhone-Poulenc
will dominate the board.</p>
<p>Such precise, rosy forecasts are considered unusual from a
company on the verge of a complex transoceanic merger. Smith
Barney says, "Investors are highly skeptical of Rorer's
dramatic earnings-per-share projections." Moreover, if much
of Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's profit comes from cost-cutting,
investors won't pay top prices for the stock, Smith Barney is
telling clients.</p>
<p>Much is at stake for Mr. Cawthorn -- and Rorer holders.
After May 4, when Rhone-Poulenc's tender offer for Rorer is
scheduled to expire, Rorer holders must decide either to cash
out entirely, or stick around and hope Mr. Cawthorn can work
his magic.</p>
<p>Rorer holders can tender half their stock to Rhone-Poulenc
for $78 a share in cash. For the rest of their Rorer shares,
holders will get stock in the new company, plus special
rights that entitle them to payments from Rhone-Poulenc in
three years if Rhone-Poulenc Rorer stock is a bomb. In the
distribution, Smith Barney values Rhone-Poulenc Rorer stock
at $39 and the rights at $25.</p>
<p>Besides the usual speculators, current Rorer holders
include the multibillionaire investor Warren Buffett and his
Berkshire Hathaway, who seem to be playing takeovers again
with a recently disclosed 5.8% Rorer stake.</p>
<p>While Mr. Cawthorn has taken Rorer from strength to
strength, analysts say the union with a much bigger partner
might strain his management savvy. The culture of
government-owned Rhone-Poulenc is different from Rorer's. The
new company initially will be encumbered with merger debt,
and, as European trade barriers come down, it must compete
head-to-head with many pharmaceutical dynamos. At least one
new drug that Rorer needs to help boost revenue, a once-a-day
prescription drug for controlling blood pressure, won't
necessarily win federal approval as soon as Rorer expects,
analysts say.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of ifs in this merger," says Hemant Shah,
an analyst at HKS & Co. in New York, though he expects Mr.
Cawthorn to meet his profit projections. "It's clearly a big
job," a Rorer spokesman says, "but it's {Mr. Cawthorn's}
charge to make it happen."</p>
<p>Rorer's merger is the latest in a stampede to form drug
industry partnerships that has created elephants such as
SmithKline Beecham and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Rhone-Poulenc,
after buying newly issued Rorer shares and 50% of the
existing publicly traded Rorer shares, will control 68% of
the separate publicly traded company, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.</p>
<p>Today, few people are downright bearish on Rorer's deal.
On Friday, Rorer closed at 69 3/8, not far below the value in
the low 70s that traders put on the merger. But investors who
stuck with Marion Merrell Dow, a similarly structured 1989
merger, saw that stock plummet until Dow Chemical recently
started buying more shares.</p>
<p>Some takeover players haven't decided whether they will
dump Rhone-Poulenc Rorer shares and rights when they get
them. Mr. Buffett won't discuss his Rorer investment. He and
Berkshire bought Rorer stock in March and April for $143
million, or about $65.60 a share. In a recent filing, Mr.
Buffett said he will tender half his Rorer shares and has "no
present plans" to sell the rest, but might do so.</p>
<p>If Rhone-Poulenc Rorer's shares and rights have a combined
value of about 64 when they are distributed, as many traders
expect, Mr. Buffett could sell them and make a fast 8% profit
on his total Rorer investment lasting about two months, equal
to a 48% profit over a year.</p>
<p>Of course, if the shares and rights trade at a much lower
value than expected, nobody will do so well. For example, if
Mr. Buffett had to sell shares and rights for only 55, his
annualized return would plummet to 7%.</p>
