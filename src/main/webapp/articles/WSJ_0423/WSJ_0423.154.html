	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. said it is
considering a $148 million investment to build a new, more
powerful engine.
   The auto maker confirmed reports that it is weighing an
expansion of its Trenton, Mich., engine plant to build
150,000 units a year of a new 24-valve, 3.5-liter engine.
Chrysler officials wouldn't say what vehicle would get the
new engine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Such a project would be consistent with Chrysler's recent
efforts to improve its engines. During the 1980s, Chrysler
was hurt when consumers demanded cars with bigger, more
powerful engines, and Chrysler didn't build either
six-cylinder or multivalve car engines.</p>
<p>Last year, Chrysler added a six-cylinder engine to its
line, but it still doesn't produce any multivalve engines; it
is to begin building its first -- a four-cylinder, 16-valve
engine -- later this year, but the site hasn't been
designated.</p>
<p>The new six-cylinder engine Chrysler is considering
building in Trenton would have dual overhead cams and four
valves per cylinder, two more than conventional engines have.
Multivalve engines deliver increased power more efficiently
than conventional engines do.</p>
<p>Chrysler stopped short of saying it has made a final
determination to build the engine in Trenton, and it declined
to say the decision hinges on getting tax breaks it is
seeking from Trenton city officials. But a Chrysler spokesman
did say the Trenton plant is the preferred site. The company
wouldn't say whether it is considering other locations.</p>
<p>Chrysler said the expansion would add about 550 jobs in
Trenton. About 2,700 people work at the plant now. Last year,
Chrysler employees in Trenton built 338,340 four-cylinder and
six-cylinder engines.</p>
