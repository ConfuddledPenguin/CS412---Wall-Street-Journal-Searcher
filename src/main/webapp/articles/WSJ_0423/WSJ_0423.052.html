	<p class="article-leader">DENVER -- Apache Corp. expects to report that its net
income doubled for the first quarter to about $11 million, or
25 cents a share, from last year's $5.4 million, or 16 cents
a share, Raymond Plank, chairman and chief executive officer,
said.
   Mr. Plank said in an interview that those expectations
primarily were the result of unusually strong natural gas
prices in January; he said earnings may exceed estimates by
10% to 20%. The company had about 44.6 million shares
outstanding at March 31, up from about 33 million a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue for the quarter is expected to be around $68
million, up from $60.7 million last year; cash flow for the
period is expected to exceed $40 million.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Plank warned that "the first quarter is not
going to be indicative of the results for the year ahead,"
primarily because natural gas prices have fallen sharply
since January. But, he said, "with higher volumes and higher
earnings from marketing-related operations, we should see a
continuing reasonably favorable comparison to last year."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Apache sold half its interest in its
Nagasco Inc. gas-gathering system and its marketing
operations to Natural Gas Clearinghouse, a venture in which
Apache owns 31.5%. Mr. Plank said that about 20% of the
company's profit, or roughly $2.2 million, came from its
natural-gas marketing business during the first quarter. That
business contributed profit of $4.3 million in all of 1989.</p>
<p>The quarterly results also were aided by increased
natural-gas sales from six new platforms in the Gulf of
Mexico. Oil production for the quarter, however, was down 4%
because of a weather-related shutdown at one platform.</p>
<p>Mr. Plank said that Apache currently plans to drill about
200 wells this year, although it may re-evaluate its plans if
gas prices remain depressed. The present plan calls for the
company to spend about $80 million to $90 million on drilling
and production this year, up from $73 million last year.</p>
<p>The company plans a total exploration and production
budget of $140 million to $150 million, up from $126.6
million last year. Mr. Plank said Apache is actively
investing in prospects overseas. Currently, all of Apache's
production is domestic.</p>
