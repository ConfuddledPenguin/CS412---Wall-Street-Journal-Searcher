	<p class="article-leader">JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South Africa's trade surplus
narrowed to 1.17 billion rand ($442.8 million) in March from
surpluses of 1.79 billion rand a year earlier and 1.77
billion rand in February, the Customs and Excise office said.
   The figures aren't seasonally adjusted, but export and
import data are adjusted to bring them in line with
requirements for compiling the nation's balance of payments.
Exports in March fell to 4.49 billion rand from 5.22 billion
rand a year earlier, and imports declined to 3.33 billion
rand from 3.44 billion rand.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the first quarter, exports grew to 14.42 billion rand
from 12.92 billion rand a year earlier, and imports increased
to 10.38 billion rand from 9.99 billion rand.</p>
<p>The trade figures include South Africa's exports of gold
bullion, its principal source of foreign exchange earnings.
Imports include the country's purchases of oil and other
petroleum products, despite the longstanding embargo of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>
