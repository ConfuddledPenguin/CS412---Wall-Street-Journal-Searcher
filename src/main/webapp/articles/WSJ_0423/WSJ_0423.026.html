	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Strikebound Greyhound Lines Inc., a unit of GLI
Holding Co., said Friday that it had laid off 275 maintenance
workers in various garages around the country.
   Company spokesman George Gravley said layoffs of office
personnel "could happen," but no layoffs of drivers are
anticipated.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to mechanics and their helpers, those laid off
included parts clerks, truck drivers and other service
workers, the company said. "Obviously, we have a reduced work
load because of the strike," Mr. Gravley said.</p>
<p>The action came as an often violent strike by 9,400
Greyhound employees represented by the Amalgamated Transit
Union entered its eighth week. No resumption of negotiations
on a new contract have been scheduled.</p>
<p>Mr. Gravley said hundreds of union maintenance workers
crossed the picket lines when the strike began March 2. In
addition to 690 maintenance workers represented by the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers, which is not on strike against the company, 695 of
the 1,475 ATU-represented maintenance workers also returned
to work.</p>
<p>The layoffs included 155 ATU members and 120 members of
the machinists' union, said Mr. Gravley, who added that
Greyhound hoped to eventually call them back.</p>
<p>Since the strike began March 2, Greyhound has struggled to
operate with replacement drivers and union crossovers. The
company is running about 72% of the scheduled routes it
operated before the strike. Ridership has been hovering
between 50% and 60% of pre-strike levels, according to the
company, which says it is approaching the "break even" point
in terms of revenue.</p>
<p>Union officials dispute that claim. "Every indicator
points to financial disaster for Greyhound Lines Inc.," ATU
President James La Sala said Friday. "Greyhound management is
now at a crossroads. It can either negotiate a settlement to
this contract dispute or allow this country's only national
bus system to slide into financial ruin."</p>
