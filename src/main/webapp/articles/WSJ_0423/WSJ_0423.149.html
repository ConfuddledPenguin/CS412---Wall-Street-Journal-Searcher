	<p class="article-leader">Corona Corp., Toronto, said it will acquire a 44.6% stake
in a new company to be formed through the proposed merger of
two mining companies, Stikine Resources Ltd. and Prime
Resources Group Inc., both based in Vancouver, British
Columbia.
   Corona said it will acquire the stake in exchange for 16.6
million new Class A shares, giving the transaction an
indicated value of about 128.7 million Canadian dollars
(US$110.7 million).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Corona said the proposed transaction "represents a
potential 20% increase in gold and equivalent reserves, and
approximately a 10% dilution in outstanding common equity."
Corona has about 141.9 million Class A shares outstanding. On
the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, the Class A shares closed
at C$7.75, down 50 Canadian cents, in heavy trading.</p>
<p>Stikine and Prime each hold 50% stakes in the Eskay Creek
property in Northern British Columbia. The property has
created much speculation in the mining industry as a possible
major new precious-metal and base-metal find.</p>
