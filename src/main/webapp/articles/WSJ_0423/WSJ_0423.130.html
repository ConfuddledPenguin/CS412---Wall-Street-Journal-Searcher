	<p class="article-leader">Jacobs Suchard AG, a Swiss chocolate, coffee and candy
company that owns the E.J. Brach candy concern in the U.S.,
is considering eliminating 3,000, or 19%, of its 16,000
full-time jobs world-wide, a spokesman confirmed, but
declined to be specific. Chairman Klaus J. Jacobs last week
was said to have told analysts of plans for such cuts in the
next 12 months.
   The spokesman said the work-force reductions are a
"logical" outcome of the "modernization and concentration" of
factories, a program Suchard calls "Vision 2,000." Suchard
plans to reduce the number of its factories to six major ones
and three smaller ones in Europe from more than 20; some of
those were obtained through acquisitions. Job cuts could
occur in Europe and the U.S., but U.S. factories won't be
closed, the spokesman said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The E.J. Brach unit has presented product mix and
marketing problems since it was acquired by Suchard for $730
million in 1987. In 1986, Brach had pretax profit of about
$75 million, on sales of about $462 million; in 1989, it had
a $50 million operating loss. Suchard has annual profit of
about 275 million francs ($48.7 million).</p>
