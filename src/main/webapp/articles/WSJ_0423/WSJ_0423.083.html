	<h3>Insurers Are Cutting Back or Halting
   Sales of Personal Insurance Policies</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Stricter state regulation, heightened competition and
mounting expenses have turned the once-mediocre returns from
selling personal insurance, such as for autos and homes, into
a flood of red ink for many insurers.
   Insurance companies are reassessing their strategies for
this sector of the market. Some are deciding it's best to cut
back, especially on auto insurance, which many insurers see
as their biggest moneyloser. Other companies are deserting
the personal insurance market entirely.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On Friday, Xerox Corp.'s Crum & Forster Inc. unit became
the latest company to drop out. It announced that it was
terminating its personal insurance business nationwide.
Robert Vairo, Crum & Forster's president and chief executive
officer, said the decision was based on market conditions and
a belief that the business wasn't going to be profitable any
time soon.</p>
<p>Last year, Crum & Forster paid out $1.29 in claims and
expenses for every dollar of premium collected in all its
personal lines. That's far worse than the industry average.
Three-quarters of Crum & Forster's personal insurance
business was done in such states as California, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Florida, Texas and Connecticut, where insurance
regulation is in the midst of being revamped.</p>
<p>"The public and the regulators can't ask us to pay for
insurance that has been mandated by the state and not be able
to recover those costs and make a reasonable profit," Mr.
Vairo said.</p>
<p>In recent months, other insurers have taken action.</p>
<p>Aetna Life & Casualty Co. plans to cut back its auto
insurance business 15% to 20% in states where it's
unprofitable. It will trim agents' auto insurance commissions
to 10% from 15% starting in July, and it has let go some
agents in California. For now, the Hartford, Conn., insurer
said its cutbacks are limited to individual auto insurance.</p>
<p>Last month, Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. told agents it
will no longer accept new auto and personal excess liability
policies after May 1 and asked agents to place renewals with
other carriers.</p>
<p>New Hampshire Insurance Co., a unit of New York-based
American International Group Inc., has accelerated its
withdrawal from the personal lines market and expects to be
out almost entirely by year end.</p>
<p>Travelers Corp., also based in Hartford, no longer sells
auto insurance in California, where it had a significant
share of the market, and it's selectively cutting back on its
personal lines business in other states. The company is also
streamlining its entire personal insurance operations,
eliminating 500 to 600 jobs in over 90 field offices
throughout the country.</p>
<p>Analysts believe more companies will take similar steps.
For consumers, such moves mean they will find fewer companies
willing to insure their cars or homes, especially in states
where insurance reforms have been passed or where new
regulation is on the ballot.</p>
<p>William Yankus at Conning & Co., a research firm, believes
the beginning of a major structural change is taking place in
the personal insurance market. First, the standard companies
drop out of the market. Then, the substandard insurers expand
their business.</p>
<p>These companies are willing to insure most motorists,
regardless of their driving records, but they charge dearly
for the service. Regulators could be forced to provide
alternatives, such as state-run pools. Mr. Yankus believes it
could be 10 to 15 years before the market corrects as tort
reform and good no-fault laws come into place.</p>
<p>Besides what insurers consider an unfavorable regulatory
environment, the very nature of the personal insurance
business leaves little room for fat profit margins. Insurers
are offering generally homogenous products in a highly
competitive market. The direct writers, insurers such as
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., Nationwide Mutual
Insurance Co. and B.A.T Industries PLC's Farmers Group Inc.
unit, which employ their own platoons of agents, have lower
commission costs and thus have an edge over the agency
companies, such as Aetna, Cigna and Travelers, which rely on
independent agents. The agency companies have been slowly
losing market share to the direct writers in the last decade.</p>
<p>Although Crum & Forster's action was spurred by market
forces, analysts believe a recent management change also
might have played a role in the company's move.</p>
<p>Alan Henderson of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
believes Stuart B. Ross, the newly appointed head of Xerox's
financial-services group, has been asked by top management to
improve the cash flow and profitability of his unit. Dropping
some unprofitable insurance lines and shrinking the entire
financial-services operations are likely moves, Mr. Henderson
said. But despite recent speculation, he doesn't believe
Stamford, Conn.-based Xerox will sell its financial-services
businesses.</p>
