	<p class="article-leader">ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc., Costa Mesa, Calif., said a
proposed merger with Galenika, a Yugoslavian drug maker, will
be pursued by ICN rather than its 89%-owned marketing
subsidiary, SPI Pharmaceuticals Inc.
   Terms of the transaction, which was first announced in
February, haven't been disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ICN said a merger with SPI could restrict SPI's ability to
raise capital in the U.S. public markets because of
Securities and Exchange Commission rules that would require
audited financial statements of Galenika for the past three
years, documents that SPI may be "unable" to get, an ICN
spokesman said.</p>
<p>Although the same SEC requirements would apply to ICN, ICN
said it has "greater financing flexibility" than does SPI,
particularly in terms of access to foreign capital.</p>
