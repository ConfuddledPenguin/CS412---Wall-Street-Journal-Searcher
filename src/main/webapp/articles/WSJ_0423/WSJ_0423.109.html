	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- The Canadian government invited the oil industry
to submit by Sept. 29 nominations for oil and gas rights in
the western part of the Beaufort Sea.
   Nominations are expressions of interest in particular
areas. The Beaufort Sea is part of the Arctic Ocean.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Indian and Northern Affairs Department said bids for
exploration rights in the western Beaufort Sea will be called
after the nominations are assessed. Several oil and gas finds
have been made in the Beaufort Sea, but none of the
discoveries has been brought into production because of the
high costs of transporting the oil and gas to markets.</p>
<p>The government last month awarded exploration licences in
the Beaufort Sea's central region. They were the first new
licences to be issued for the region in 20 years.</p>
