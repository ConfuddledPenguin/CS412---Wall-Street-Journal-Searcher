	<p class="article-leader">The New Zealand experiment in free enterprise for the mail
sounds attractive as John Crutcher described it in his March
8 editorial-page article. Unfortunately, in order to make his
case, he left out quite a few facts that would cause the
American people to say "no way in the USA."
   Yes, in the first year of "corporatization" an enormous
profit was shown (equal to about $10 billion if applied to
our volume). But the profit was accomplished by the
following: a 33% increase in the price of a first-class
stamp; a reduction in the number of post offices from 1,200
nationwide to 894 nationwide -- with further reductions this
year to just 340; establishment of a higher-priced mail
service called Fast Post, offering next-day service anywhere
in New Zealand for twice the new first-class rate; a one-time
profit from the sale of former postal property.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Recognizing that New Zealand, with a maximum distance of
600 miles between any two points and a population just 1.5%
that of the U.S., is so different from us that comparisons
are difficult, the fact is that service was reduced, except
for those who wanted to pay 166% more. Local post offices,
postal service and even community identity were decimated. We
have 40,000 post offices in the U.S.; as a businessman I
easily could identify for you which of those would be closed
by a business seeking only to maximize profit. The number
would be well over 10,000 post offices. Is this what the
American people want?</p>
<p>The result in New Zealand is that the government still
owns the post office; that the number of post offices will
have been reduced by more than 70%; and that service has
decreased except for those willing to pay 166% more for
postage. This is not a model for this country.</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly with the premise in Mr. Crutcher's
article. I would like to know, however, how he arrived at his
compensation figure of $42,000 a year including benefits.
Starting postal-service wages are currently $11 an hour,
without benefits. The U.S. postal carrier is at the top of
the range after 15 years and is paid $30,000. To reach the
$42,000 level, his benefits package would have to be 40%.
Even with government largess, I have trouble believing
benefits are 40% of wages. Even if they were, the average,
semi-skilled employee would not be paid $42,000.</p>
<p>Also, comparing New Zealand wages of $15,000 with U.S.
wages is hardly appropriate. I visited New Zealand in 1986
and I would say it's well behind the U.S. in standard of
living.</p>
<p>Obviously, United Parcel Service has demonstrated it can
be successful at delivering packages, so privatizing the
Postal Service probably would result in better service at a
cheaper cost. In the meantime, however, eliminating Saturday
delivery to residences as well as charging higher postage to
bulk mailers would cut costs tremendously. Bulk mailers would
not send three or more copies of the same catalog in one
month if they couldn't mail them so cheaply. There is no mail
delivered to a residence on Saturday that couldn't wait until
Monday.</p>
