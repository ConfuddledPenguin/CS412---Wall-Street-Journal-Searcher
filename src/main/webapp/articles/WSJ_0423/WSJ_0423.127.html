	<p class="article-leader">Recognition Equipment Inc., Dallas, said it sued two
former insurance carriers in state district court, seeking to
recover more than $9 million under its directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies.
   The maker of data management equipment filed the action in
the Dallas court against Harbor Insurance Co., which was its
primary carrier, and St. Paul Surplus Lines Insurance Co. in
the bid to collect on costs and expenses related to defending
Recognition and two former executives in criminal and civil
lawsuits. Harbor, Los Angeles, is a unit of Continental
Corp., a New York-based insurance holding company. St. Paul
Surplus Lines is a unit of St. Paul Cos., a St. Paul, Minn.,
insurer. Both insurance policies expired last year,
Recognition said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company and its two former executives were acquitted
last November of charges that they tried to manipulate the
award of U.S. Postal Service contracts for mail-sorting
equipment. Recognition said that civil suits against the
company relating to the criminal charges are pending, and
that its total claims against the insurance companies for
those lawsuits and others could exceed $10 million.</p>
