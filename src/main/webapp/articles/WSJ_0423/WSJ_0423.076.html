	<p class="article-leader">Professional Bancorp Inc. expects first-quarter net income
of about $100,000, or 10 cents a share, compared with
$267,000, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier, said Joel W.
Kovner, chairman and chief executive officer of the Santa
Monica, Calif., company.
   Mr. Kovner blamed the more than 60% drop on a
significantly higher tax rate, a lower prime rate and an
increase in the bank holding company's Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. assessment. Professional Bancorp's number of
shares outstanding rose to 965,000 after a 25% stock dividend
that took effect last month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the full year, Mr. Kovner predicts that the company
will earn roughly $800,000, or 82 cents a share, assuming
that the prime rate remains at the current rate of 10%.
Professional Bancorp posted 1989 net income of about $1
million, or $1.13 a share.</p>
<p>Professional Bancorp's only subsidiary, First Professional
Bank, has four offices in California whose customers are
mainly physicians. "We're basically a medical bank," Mr.
Kovner said. "Clients have our officers' home phone numbers
and can call day or night."</p>
<p>Couriers are dispatched to pick up deposits from
physicians' offices at no charge. To arrange a loan, a bank
officer will go to the physician's office. "We've assisted in
buying hospitals and locating land because we know the
medical market," Mr. Kovner said.</p>
<p>Mr. Kovner said the company's tax rate in the first
quarter was about 42.5%, compared with 11% a year earlier
when the company paid only state taxes and no federal taxes.
"We've run out of tax credits and any type of net operating
losses," Mr. Kovner said. The 42.5% rate is anticipated for
the full year.</p>
<p>The prime rate is down about 150 basis points from the
year-earlier quarter, Mr. Kovner said. A basis point is
1/100th of a percentage point. "Each 50 basis points is worth
about $300,000 to us in {annual} earnings, or $75,000 a
quarter." The company's FDIC assessment has increased by
$15,000 a quarter, Mr. Kovner said.</p>
<p>Despite the anticipated net income decline, the company
continues to grow. At the end of last month, assets stood at
about $128 million, up 16% from $110 million at the end of
the 1989 first quarter. Deposits grew 17.5% to $120 million
from $102 million.</p>
<p>Professional Bancorp expects to open a new bank office
near Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif., later
this year. Also planned this year or early next year is one
or two new California offices in Loma Linda and/or the
Pomona-Ontario area. Within the next few years, the company
may also establish offices in Long Beach, Calif., Sacramento
and Boston or New York, Mr. Kovner said.</p>
<p>"Our planned growth might include a public offering in the
next year or so if capital markets are appropriate," Mr.
Kovner said. In February, the company eliminated all its
long-term debt and has no short-term debt. "I think debt is
bad unless absolutely necessary. This bank is very
conservatively run on a financial basis and it would be
foolish to bring on debt."</p>
