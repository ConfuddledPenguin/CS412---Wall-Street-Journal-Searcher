	<p class="article-leader">UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- MCA Inc., an entertainment
concern, said it completed the sale of LJN Toys Ltd. to
Acclaim Entertainment Inc., an Oyster Bay, N.Y., computer
software company, for cash and 1.2 million shares of Acclaim
stock. Terms weren't disclosed, but a person close to the
transaction valued it at $20 million to $25 million.
   The deal was valued at $30 million when the sale agreement
was announced last month. The value declined because some of
LJN's receivables were liquidated before the sale closed, MCA
said.</p>
