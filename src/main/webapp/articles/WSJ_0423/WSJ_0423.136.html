	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Two closely held investment banking boutiques,
Blackstone Group of New York and J.O. Hambro Magan & Co. of
London, agreed to work together to arrange mergers and
acquisitions involving companies in the U.S. and United
Kingdom.
   The pact provides that each firm will assist the other in
developing and completing mergers between U.S. and U.K.
firms, but it doesn't involve any cross-ownership between the
two concerns.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Blackstone already has affiliate relationships with Nikko
Securities Co., Tokyo, which owns 20% of Blackstone, and
Banque Indosuez, Paris.</p>
<p>Rupert Hambro, chairman of Hambro Magan, noted that
mergers between U.S. and U.K. companies last year had a total
value of $29.8 billion, up from only $5.4 billion in 1985.</p>
<p>Hambro advised Jaguar PLC in its acquisition by Ford Motor
Co. and Deutsche Bank in its acquisition of Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Peter G. Peterson, chairman of Blackstone, said so-called
cross-border merger activity "certainly is a rapidly
exploding field." He said Hambro Magan has "very good access
at the highest levels" of U.K. companies.</p>
<p>Blackstone has advised Sony Corp. on its acquisitions of
CBS Records and Columbia Pictures and Bridgestone Corp.'s
acquisition of Firestone.</p>
