	<p class="article-leader">PARSIPPANY, N.J. -- Armco Inc. said it reached a final
agreement with Spanish steelmaker, Acerinox S.A. of Madrid,
to form two joint ventures to produce and market stainless
steel products.
   The U.S. joint venture, called North American Stainless,
will consist of a $222 million stainless steel finishing
plant to produce 48-inch and 60-inch-wide chrome nickel
stainless sheet and strip for the chemical, pulp and paper,
construction and food and beverage industries. The plant will
have initial capacity of more than 170,000 tons.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The European venture, named Acerinox-Armco Europa S.A.,
will process and market chrome stainless grades for use in
European automotive exhaust systems. Steel for this venture
will be produced at Acerinox's plant in Algeciras, Spain, and
processed in its service centers at various European
locations. The products will be marketed by the joint venture
company.</p>
<p>Existing operations of Armco and Acerinox will not be part
of the joint ventures.</p>
<p>Armco and Acerinox had announced an agreement in principle
to form the joint ventures in November 1989.</p>
