	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. purchased a 19.5% stake in
Six Flags Corp., which owns and operates seven amusement
parks in the U.S.
   The purchase, valued at $19.5 million, makes Time Warner a
player in a part of the entertainment business in which two
of its competitors, Walt Disney Co. and MCA Inc.'s Universal
unit, already enjoy success.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With its established stable of Warner Bros. cartoon
characters, such as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, Time Warner
could reposition Six Flags' theme parks to emphasize the
animated cadre. The Six Flags purchase is the first made by
Time Warner's recently formed venture unit Time Warner
Enterprises, headed by former MTV Networks president Robert
W. Pittman.</p>
<p>The investment by Time Warner was a natural fit because
Six Flags parks have been licensed by Warner Bros., a unit of
Time Warner, for the exclusive use of the Looney Tunes
characters for the past six years. "We think there is a lot
of growth to be had in the merchandising of the Looney Tunes
characters," said a spokeswoman for Time Warner.</p>
<p>In the future, said James Prager, executive vice president
at Six Flags, the "intent" would be to have even more
interaction with Time Warner properties, such as characters
from the Warner Bros. movie "Batman."</p>
<p>The agreement also gives Time Warner options to increase
its stake to as much as 50% in Six Flags. And analysts expect
Time Warner to do just that. "Time Warner is tiptoeing into
the theme park business, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a
whole transformation of the Six Flags chain," said Richard
MacDonald, a media analyst with the firm MacDonald Grippo
Riely Inc.</p>
<p>Six Flags, based in Arlington, Texas, and owned by an
investor group associated with Wesray Capital Corp. and Six
Flags management, is in need of an influx of cash. Six of its
seven locations need upgrading. New roller coasters will be
added, for example, at a total cost of $27 million, said Mr.
Prager.</p>
<p>Industry officials, who declined to be identified, said
MCA and Paramount Communications Inc. both explored the
possibility of purchasing a stake in Six Flags.</p>
<p>The Time Warner spokeswoman said that Time Magazine Co., a
subsidiary of Time Warner, and Warner Bros.' worldwide
merchandising unit will have an active role with the parks.</p>
<p>Last year, Six Flags had revenue of $394 million, Mr.
Prager said. Total annual attendance for the seven parks is
about 17 million. By comparison, Disney's Magic Kingdom,
EPCOT Center, and the new Disney-MGM Studios, all in the
Orlando, Fla., area, had attendance of more than 23 million
in 1989.</p>
<p>The potential for Time Warner if the theme parks are hits
is enormous. In 1989, Disney's three parks world-wide
registered $2.6 billion in revenue. Analysts say that it
wouldn't be unlikely for Time Warner to expand Six Flags'
reach beyond the U.S.</p>
