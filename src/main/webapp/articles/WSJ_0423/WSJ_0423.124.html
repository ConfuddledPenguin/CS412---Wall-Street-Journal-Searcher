	<p class="article-leader">Ciba-Geigy AG, the big Basel, Switzerland-based, chemicals
group, withdrew a proposal for a capital increase with rights
that would have brought the company 436 million Swiss francs.
It cited as a reason the "marked deterioration" of the Swiss
stock market since the proposal was made on Feb. 21.
   A company executive said the proposal for the rights issue
of 363,270 registered shares was meant to compensate
shareholders for their approval of a capital increase
involving the issue of new shares for employee stock purchase
plans. "The company doesn't need the money," he said, adding
that there are no plans to come back at a later date with a
new rights issue proposal.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The shares for the employee-stock proposal will now be
obtained on the open market, the announcement said. The
company had planned to seek shareholder approval to issue
360,000 new registered shares for the employee transaction.
Management also had intended the rights issue to act as a
"sweetener" to encourage shareholders to approve a plan
allowing owners of participation certificates to exchange
them for registered shares on a voluntary basis. The
certificates-for-share exchange is still planned, the company
said, including the creation of registered shares required
for it.</p>
<p>The capital market proposals were part of a package for
the May 9 shareholder meeting to consider, including a plan
to allow foreign nationals to buy registered shares.</p>
<p>Ciba-Geigy's shares were heavily traded on the Zurich
Stock Exchange after the announcement Friday. The bearer
share rose 40 francs to 2,930 francs and its registered share
added 140 francs to 2,660 francs.</p>
