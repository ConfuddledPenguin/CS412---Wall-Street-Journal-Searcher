	<p class="article-leader">Far West Financial Corp. joined the parade of big,
once-staid California savings and loans that have run up huge
losses and endangered their own survival by diversifying out
of California residential real estate.
   Far West, a thrift holding company with assets totaling
$4.35 billion, disclosed a 1989 net loss of $46.1 million, or
about $5.90 a share. In 1988, Far West had a profit of $8.6
million, or $1.09 a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 1989 results, including an indicated net loss of $39.5
million, or $5.05 a share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31,
leave the company's main Far West Savings & Loan Association
unit in violation of at least two of the government's three
thrift capital requirements. Now, the company must raise at
least $117 million in capital or risk being seized by federal
regulators.</p>
<p>Other crippled California thrifts include Imperial Savings
of San Diego and Mercury Savings of Huntington Beach, both of
which failed recently. Valley Federal Savings of Van Nuys,
Santa Barbara Savings, and Columbia Savings of Beverly Hills
are currently insolvent and seeking to develop survival plans
against long odds. And Southwest loans have badly hurt Great
American Bank, a giant San Diego thrift, which now must raise
more than $300 million of capital to stave off regulators.</p>
<p>Far West attributed the 1989 loss to a $105.9 million
charge to write down junk-bond holdings to market prices, a
requirement stemming from last year's thrift bailout law, as
well as $45.1 million of reserves against problem loans. Far
West has one of the largest junk-bond portfolios in the
thrift industry, reflecting in part its past close ties to
Michael Milken and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Officials of
Far West, based in Los Angeles, couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>The plummeting junk-bond market, a provision of the
bailout law that requires thrifts to eventually divest their
junk bonds, and the interim "mark-to-market" accounting
requirement have devastated junk bond laden thrifts as a
group. Seven of the top 15 thrift holders of such bonds have
failed in recent months, and the biggest, Columbia Savings,
although still in business, is expected to be taken over by
regulators.</p>
<p>Far West made junk-bond bets as long as it could,
according to government data collected by Miami thrift
analyst Kenneth Thomas. The data show that Far West boosted
its junk-bond holdings by $170 million in the 40 days
preceding Congressional adoption of the junk-bond ban last
August, leaving it with a total of $667 million in such bonds
at Sept. 30. More recent data, according to Mr. Thomas,
indicate that the company turned around and sold $274 million
in the fourth quarter and held $393 million in junk at year
end. Other thrifts that made similar purchases just before
the ban have complained that Congress blindsided them.</p>
<p>As precarious as the year-end results appear, analysts
said that, based on further erosion in the junk-bond market
in January and February, Far West may have incurred
additional large losses in the first quarter. Mr. Thomas, for
one, estimated that Far West in the first quarter incurred
junk-bond losses equal to another 10% of its portfolio, or
roughly $39 million. That amount of loss would be enough to
sink the company's key tangible capital to about half of the
federal minimum requirement. The company's "core" and
"risk-based" capital already violate federal standards.</p>
<p>In a news release, Far West indicated that a plan to solve
its capital problems is being revised at the request of
regulators.</p>
<p>Far West does have one thing going for it that many other
troubled thrifts don't these days -- a deep pocket. Canada's
Belzberg family is the company's controlling shareholder;
William Belzberg is its chairman. The family's purchase of
stock in the thrift in the 1970s was one of its first
investments south of the border. But whether the family is
willing to commit substantial further funds at this time
isn't clear.</p>
<p>"It will not look good if they walk away," said Allan
Bortel, a San Francisco thrift analyst. "On the other hand,
it is going to be a very poor return on investment if they do
heal it without government help."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Far
West stock closed at $2.50 a share, down 12.5 cents.</p>
