	<p class="article-leader">A joint venture owned by Hitachi Koki Co. and Nissei
Sangyo Co. of Japan said it plans to explore the sale of
Dataproducts New England Inc. if the venture's $10-a-share
tender offer for Dataproducts Corp. succeeds.
   The two companies, which are affiliates of Hitachi Ltd.,
the Tokyo electronic-equipment maker, launched a $160 million
offer for the parent company on Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the venture, HND Corp., said it may also seek the sale of
Dataproducts' properties in Milford, N.H., and Austin, Texas.
Those properties are currently listed for sale.</p>
<p>In Woodland Hills, Calif., a Dataproducts spokesman said
the filing was expected. "Hitachi is interested in our
printer and supply business; the New England operations don't
fit with that strategy." Dataproducts New England makes
certain security-sensitive printers and data communications
equipment for the U.S. military; the products might cause
complications for a foreign buyer, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Should it acquire control of Dataproducts, HND also said
it plans to continue the company's restructuring and to
review carefully the company's assets, corporate structure
and capitalization to determine what additional changes, if
any, would be desirable.</p>
