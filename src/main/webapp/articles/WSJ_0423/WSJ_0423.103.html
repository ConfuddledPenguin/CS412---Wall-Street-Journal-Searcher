	<p class="article-leader">KABUL, Afghanistan -- The two brothers, aged 12 and 10,
were walking to buy bread when the rocket hit. The older boy
got down, but the 10-year-old ran in fright -- and was caught
in a secondary explosion from scores of mines clustered in
the weapon.
   Wounded in the face, chest, and legs, he lost blood and
died that evening. When an official went to his family's home
to inquire about the incident, the distraught father, a
laborer who had been driven from his village by Soviet
troops, sought to hammer the man with a rock.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Across Kabul, Afghanistan's long civil war has been kinder
to Basir Omarzay. The 46-year-old broker has made a fortune
in the open black market, supplying hard currency to the
government and building his own private banking empire from
Peshawar to Moscow and New York. Mr. Omarzay now lives in an
old German villa amid handsome pine trees. Soviet allies of
the Kabul regime come and go from his high-walled compound.</p>
<p>Pain and profit -- like the dead boy and the banker -- are
old neighbors in Kabul. The Soviet troop convoys are long
gone. The closed U.S. Embassy is a symbol of Washington's
isolation. But a year after many predicted this capital would
fall, the government -- and the war -- remain. The mujahedeen
resistance, backed by the U.S., Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,
hold much of the countryside. The cities belong to the
government, and caught in between are hundreds of thousands
of displaced families and a network of roads that is the last
lifeline of a desperate economy.</p>
<p>The crowded agenda for next month's U.S.-Soviet summit in
Washington includes new options to end this, the bloodiest
and most costly of the regional conflicts of the 1980s.
Diplomatic formulas are being devised for an interim
government and free elections. But Afghanistan is so
fragmented that even a superpower settlement is no guarantee
of peace.</p>
<p>Throughout its history, Afghanistan has been foremost a
tribal confederation. Today it is a heavily armed tribal
confederation. Belts in the market come with or without
holsters. The army, which engineered the pro-Marxist takeover
in 1978, finds itself outnumbered now by a multitude of
Interior Ministry forces, secret security police, and tribal
militias.</p>
<p>A Red Cross official tells of having to deal with as many
as four different guerrilla factions over whether to set up a
clinic in a single village in northeastern Afghanistan. When
a reconciliation ceremony was staged near Herat this month,
it became an ambush in which mujahedeen and security-force
leaders were killed.</p>
<p>The guerrilla attacks on Kabul provoke anger toward the
U.S., but when anti-Americanism is expressed, it is more from
a sense of abandonment than hatred. "Why did they close their
embassy?" demands Deputy Prime Minister Mohammad Hakim of the
Americans. "They don't know us," says the former military
officer, who was trained at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.
"They don't sit with us."</p>
<p>What the superpowers have left behind are weapons and
random violence. The cluster rockets, like the one that
killed the 10-year-old on his way to buy bread, were first
used by the guerrillas last summer, and are financed by the
U.S. Weapons the Soviets supply the government are more
powerful. In a crowded hospital ward, a 40-year-old farmer
from Ghorband describes working in his field when a single
army missile killed livestock and his two sons while wounding
his parents and himself.</p>
<p>The timing and targets of guerrilla attacks on Kabul
suggest little military purpose. On the first day of Ramadan,
the Moslem period of fasting, shrapnel wounded several people
at a market along the river even as another rocket ripped
apart a crowded red Mercedes mini-bus, killing and maiming
its passengers.</p>
<p>It is a war fought from great distances, more often heard
than seen. The roar of Soviet-made SCUD missiles has earned
them the nickname "subways in the sky." Smaller Frog-7's
punch the air as they break the sound barrier seconds after
being fired. Skittish dogs are often the best harbingers of
danger; in a long night of fighting in early March, their
barking awoke the roosters.</p>
<p>After more than a decade of fighting, this isn't a
struggle of clear ideologies or regional divisions. "The
mujahedeen are our brothers," says Col. Hassan Hemat at a
Kabul outpost. Vice President Abdul Hamid Mohtat tells of
crossing enemy lines to go home to the Panjsher Valley in
December 1988 for a family event. Once there, he talked and
ate with the celebrated guerrilla leader Ahman Shah Massoud.
"I was born in the valley. That is my valley," says the vice
president, who comes from the same Tajik ethnic group as Mr.
Massoud. "We have family connections and relatives."</p>
<p>Like the city itself, the Kabul Hotel is beaten down but
defiant. Band music from nonstop weddings blares in the
lobby. Disaffected mujahedeen, housed by the government
upstairs, watch Soviet television and the British "Miss
Marple" -- dubbed in a male Afghan voice. Manning the
switchboard is a geology professor who moonlights to make
ends meet. "How is the life?" he asks each morning in broken
English.</p>
<p>The life is hard. Rationing and an improved distribution
system have helped avoid last year's shortages, but prices
are prohibitively high and corruption in the government
remains an embarrassment to the regime. A week's wages at
least are needed to buy a single live chicken. The poor line
up at bakeries where subsidized flour cuts the cost of bread.
A clinic run by the private International Assistance Mission
distributes its own mix of grains and fruit to counter
malnutrition in children.</p>
<p>Soldiers, taking a page from the Soviets before them,
siphon off military fuel to earn cash in the black market.
Government filling stations are abandoned, and the dusty
smell of the city is heavy with gasoline, as old men carry
their ration home from leaky trucks. Batteries are a major
commodity, for only half of Kabul gets power on any given
day. To compensate, all of President Najibullah's speeches
are televised on two successive nights.</p>
<p>Lack of opportunity drives many men to re-enlist in the
military. Government jobs are valued less for their meager
salaries than for their subsidies. When bombs began to fall
on government buildings in last month's coup attempt, few
workers were hurt because so many skip out after noon to take
second jobs.</p>
<p>Children -- and education -- are the greatest casualties
of the war. Classes are erratic because of the violence.
Shopkeepers keep their families in for safety, and, among the
poor, children are pressed into work even more than in the
past. As scores of soldiers stand idly by, young boys in
Kabul dig a ditch to help repair a torn cable. "We have a
whole generation that doesn't know what to do if peace came
tomorrow," says Alfredo Witchi Cestari, head of the United
Nations' refugee commission here.</p>
<p>What survives is the marketplace and a smuggling network
that prospers as a last source of income in a desperate
economy. Afghanistan's low customs fees attract a flood of
goods, which are shipped legally to Kabul and then smuggled
across the border to avoid the high tariffs erected by
Pakistan, Iran and India.</p>
<p>In the city's bazaars, amid sheep heads, tea and oranges,
men push wooden carts weighed down with towering boxes of
television sets and appliances from the Far East. Indian
tires, Soviet tractors and European auto parts move through
mud-walled warehouses. China courts businessmen with colored
brochures of machine tools made in Shanghai. The old,
long-nosed Bedford trucks of the British empire are shipped
in from Nottingham.</p>
<p>Lighter goods and food come to Kabul from Dubai by air.
Heavier items travel by train from Europe, Leningrad and the
Black Sea or from Pacific ports across the trans-Siberian
rail line. Trucks take over at the Afghanistan border, ablaze
with Pushtun tribal streamers and patterned quilts to block
the mountain cold. Runs, once measured in hours, can stretch
into a week, but the rewards are great. The trip from the
Soviet border to Kabul can earn for a driver a sum equal to
twice a month's salary and subsidies for many government
workers.</p>
<p>It is a network almost everyone uses. The U.N. relies on
it to move relief assistance. Drug smugglers exploit it to
convey contraband into the Soviet Union. Guerrilla factions
have their own stake in the trade -- and therefore in letting
some traffic pass. And the Kabul government takes its cut in
the form of customs and license fees.</p>
<p>The richness of the commerce is a reminder of how much the
nation has come to depend on forces outside its borders.
Afghani bank notes are minted in the Soviet Union. Kabul bus
tickets come from Czechoslovakia. In Kabul, industry has
declined with the loss of raw materials. Until several years
ago, Abdul Azim exported cotton and sesame seeds and employed
150 people at a mill on the outskirts of the city. Today,
cotton production is estimated to be an eighth of what it
once was, and the 56-year-old trader lives on commissions as
an agent for Japan-based Bridgestone Tires, whose product he
sells for re-export outside Afghanistan.</p>
<p>In less than two years, the value of the Afghan currency
has fallen more than 60% against the dollar, leaving the
nation so desperate for hard money that it may reopen its
natural-gas pipeline to the Soviet Union. Without a strong
central bank, a handful of well-connected speculators set the
values in the unofficial exchange. Mr. Omarzay denies his
spectacular rise owes anything to politics -- but then again
he denied his own name in three interviews before admitting
on a fourth try that he wasn't his younger brother from
Dubai.</p>
<p>For his part, President Najibullah barters in loyalties.
The son of a trade agent, he rises on the failures of his
rivals and parcels out money and power to buy time for
himself and a divided ruling party. Merchants and militia
commanders, tribal leaders and newly minted four-star
generals are part of a mix that preserves the government but
that creates a set of fiefdoms, much like the old cantons of
China.</p>
<p>Greater power sharing is promised by the ruling People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan, but Mr. Najibullah appears
bent on remaking not only the party but himself. Once a
middle-class medical student with Marxist leanings, he now
flees the Communist label and seeks to be a populist leader,
appealing to tribal and religious elders.</p>
<p>He gives a clever but often hollow performance. He outdid
himself recently when he claimed that God had instructed him
to travel to a Shi'a shrine in Mozar Sharif, where he pledged
20 million afghanis to finance improvements to the holy
building. The donation struck a false note at a time of
poverty.</p>
<p>In a clumsy, almost comic manner, he used the coup to
bolster his slim military credentials. To dramatize the
event, the government ushered reporters to bomb craters --
ostensibly the product of the coup -- located near a building
the president uses. "Napalm bombs" said officials. When
challenged, a guide mumbled that he meant "Nepal" bombs.
Although the bombs came dangerously close to Mr. Najibullah,
a guard stationed outside the stone building escaped without
injury. "Special defense tactics," the government guide
explained proudly. In fact, the soldier said he saw the jets
coming and lay down.</p>
<p>The Bush administration is hoping that elections may bring
an anti-Marxist victory in Afghanistan similar to that in
Nicaragua. But the history of the last decade has done little
to encourage Afghans to accept either political parties or
any strong central government. The PDPA succeeded years of
rule by kings and their relatives, and the party then sought
to impose wholesale change from the top, without building any
alliances first in the tribal structure or working class.
Today, fear of the secret police is still widespread and
little or no press exists to disseminate ideas.</p>
<p>One voice of dissent is the National Salvation Society,
though the group depends more on the respect accorded its
small membership of old royalist ministers than on any real
activism. Led by Prof. Mohammad Asghar, a former mayor of
Kabul, it is seeking private financial assistance from the
West and could yet play a role in setting up any interim
government. The 74-year-old Mr. Asghar, for example, served
as Justice minister in the 1960s. A second member, Gen. Abdul
Hakim Katawazi, 66, is a Pashtun with ties to tribal leaders
and a background in the Interior Ministry. In an interview,
Mr. Najibullah says he respects the Society and promises to
protect it. Left unsaid is the fact that the secret police
have a station across the street from the Society offices.</p>
<p>Mohammad Ghofran is himself a non-PDPA man and laughs a
lot for an agriculture minister whose government controls
mostly cities. He remembers when he traveled the land years
ago overseeing a farm extension service that employed 3,200
people. Today, the number is about one-tenth that. He still
frets over fertilizer and seed as he did in the old days, but
now there are also the tense encounters with wary villagers
to contend with.</p>
<p>Mr. Ghofran has kept a copy of his degree in pomology from
the University of California at Davis -- signed by then-Gov.
Ronald Reagan. He lost most of his orchards to the
mujahedeen, who angrily cut down the trees when he agreed to
serve in the government again. He laughs.</p>
<p>"There is no choice," he says. "Should I cry?"</p>
