	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian commercial banks raised their prime
lending rates half a percentage point to 14.75%, the highest
level in 7 1/2 years.
   The move on Friday heightened recession fears in some
industries. Canada's high interest rates have already pushed
the residential building industry into a recession, said Gord
Thompson, president of the Canadian Home Builders'
Association. He said builders are being forced to take back
properties in the Toronto area and elsewhere. Some buyers, in
unloading their properties, are giving up large deposits.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The interest rate rise also hit stock prices. The Toronto
Stock Exchange composite index fell 54.99 points Friday, for
a total decrease for the week of 205.6 points. The index has
fallen 7.6% since the recent series of declines began April
9.</p>
<p>Financial analysts said rising interest rates would hit
communication and media companies especially hard, as
advertising revenues declined in response to a slowdown in
the economy.</p>
<p>The interest rate rise has been prompted by concern about
Canadian inflation. Canadian short-term interest rates are
more than 5 1/4 percentage points higher than comparable U.S.
rates.</p>
<p>Canada's consumer price index in March rose a seasonally
adjusted 0.3% from February and 5.3% from a year earlier,
Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.</p>
<p>Economists warned that the inflation outlook remains
ominous, in view of current wage demands and the government's
plan to introduce a 7% consumption tax on Jan. 1.</p>
<p>Canada's high interest rates have pushed up the Canadian
dollar, squeezing Canadian exporters. The Canadian dollar's
rise has led to "declining profits, plummeting orders and
significant layoffs" in the manufacturing industry, said Todd
Rutley, senior economist with the Canadian Manufacturers'
Association, an industry group.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar closed Friday in Toronto at 86 U.S.
cents, down from 86.06 cents Thursday but up 1.5 cents from
mid-March.</p>
<p>Rezmi Markar, associate economist with Data Resources of
Canada, said he expects the prime rate to drop by less than
one percentage point by the end of the year. But he forecast
a new upswing in interest rates in early 1991, because of the
inflationary effect of the planned consumption tax. The
proposed value-added tax, which will replace a more narrowly
based manufacturers sales tax, has been passed by the House
of Commons but still needs approval by the Senate.</p>
<p>Ernie Stokes, a research director with WEFA Group Ltd.,
warned that a recession could occur this year if interest
rates persist at current levels.</p>
<p>As well as inflation concerns, Canadian financial markets
are unsettled by proposed constitutional revisions that would
give Quebec, a largely French-speaking province, "distinct
society" status in the constitution.</p>
<p>The prime rate rise followed an increase Thursday in the
Bank of Canada's bank rate to 13.77%, its highest level in
more than seven years, from 13.61%. The rate is the levy the
central bank charges on its loans to financial institutions.</p>
