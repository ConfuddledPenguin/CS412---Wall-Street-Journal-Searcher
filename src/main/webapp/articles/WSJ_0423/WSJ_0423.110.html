	<p class="article-leader">A U.S. HOSTAGE WAS RELEASED by pro-Iranian kidnappers in
Lebanon.
   After nearly 39 months in captivity, educator Robert
Polhill was freed in Beirut by Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine, a group that holds at least two
other Americans. Polhill, who was taken to Syria before
heading to West Germany, was the first American captive to be
released in almost three-and-a-half years. The 55-year-old
New Yorker said he was "happy and grateful" about his
release, but expressed concern about those still held. Bush
thanked Syria and Iran for their roles in winning Polhill's
freedom, and called for the release of all hostages.</p>

communiques from the extremists, weren't known. At least 17
foreigners are missing in Lebanon.</p>
