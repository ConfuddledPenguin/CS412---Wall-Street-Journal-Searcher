	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- For nearly three years, Jason Berman has been
pleading with the Japanese government to enhance its
copyright protection for certain American records. But every
time, "all I've gotten is a polite nod," says the president
of the Recording Industry Association of America.
   Until last week. Foreign Ministry officials, hearing Mr.
Berman was in town on other business, tracked him down and
asked him for a meeting. They talked for an hour on Friday,
and "it was the first time there was some recognition that
there's a problem and they're going to address it," says Mr.
Berman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In fact, the Japanese have appeared quite accommodating on
a lot of contentious matters lately. Next week, the Bush
administration must decide whether to finger Japan as an
unfair trader in specific markets under the so-called Super
301 provision of the U.S. trade law. Japan would like to
avoid being labeled an unfair trader, and is scrambling to
show progress on each of the four or five issues reportedly
on the short list, although it isn't clear whether real trade
benefits to the U.S. will result.</p>
<p>Just as Mr. Berman's meeting began Friday afternoon,
another session was breaking up across the street at the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, at which
bureaucrats urged officials from 150 companies to increase
their purchases of foreign-made semiconductors. Earlier in
the month, Japanese automobile companies met with American
auto-parts suppliers in Las Vegas, Nev., to negotiate
additional imports, and this past Thursday, MITI asked
Japanese auto makers to designate engineers who can go to the
U.S. to work with American suppliers. The Ministry of Health
and Welfare recently pledged to work closely with U.S.
medical suppliers, who have been upset by changes in
insurance payment policies.</p>
<p>That two-step has already succeeded in staving off threats
in one case. This past Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills announced that Allied-Signal Inc. had withdrawn
its formal complaint about Japanese utilities refusing to buy
its advanced electrical transformers. The Japanese government
will try to work out the matter with the company privately.</p>
<p>Such activity has become common in recent years, each time
a new U.S. trade threat looms. Last year, in the weeks
preceeding the U.S. government's Super 301 decision, the
Japanese announced a series of new import promotion plans.
That didn't persuade the Americans, however, who slapped
Japan for its practices in super computers, satellites, and
wood products. Under the statute, which was implemented for
the first time last year, the accused country has a year to
satisfy the U.S. that it will change the offending practices.
If not, the U.S. will retaliate.</p>
<p>But the Japanese think this year is different, mainly
because they have worked to please the U.S. on so many fronts
in recent weeks. They have already reached agreements on
super computers and satellites, even though the official
deadline isn't until mid-June. U.S. negotiators are coming to
Tokyo this week, and hope to wrap up talks over wood products
by Friday. Earlier this month, Japan agreed to a vague but
potentially sweeping package of reforms under the so-called
Structural Impediments Initiative, talks aimed at wiping out
the underlying causes of the $49 billion bilateral trade
imbalance.</p>
<p>Some factions in the Bush administration think Japan has
already given enough, and are arguing for a reprieve on
Monday. Mr. Bush himself is reportedly leaning that way.
Japan is trying to strengthen its position by saying it wants
a fundamental change in the current confrontational trading
relationship, where the U.S. issues a threat, Japan initially
denies the problem, then caves in under intense pressure at
the last minute.</p>
<p>`Undesirable feelings have spread on both ends," says a
senior Foreign Ministry official. "We'd like to improve our
economic relations." And the Japanese are hinting that this
burst of flexibility of late may disappear if the Americans
knock them again. "If Japan will be named again at the end of
this month, that will be a turning point," the official adds.
"That will certainly restrict the willingness on the part of
the Japanese government to work with the American side."</p>
<p>But, it isn't clear whether the Japanese are actually
promising anything of substance. U.S. auto-parts makers say
they are unfairly shut out of the Japanese market because of
the long-term close relationship between Japanese assemblers
and suppliers. "We admit the high possibility of auto parts
being targeted under Super 301. We are now trying to avoid
that," a Toyota Motor Corp. official said last week. His
company recently said it would nearly triple imported parts
by 1992. Other makers, such as Nissan Motor Co. and Mazda
Motor Corp., have also announced import "action plans."</p>
<p>But U.S. skeptics say such promises are vague, without
clearly specifying how much of the increase will come from
the U.S. They also wonder whether the imports will simply
come from rapidly expanding Japanese parts companies in the
U.S. and other countries. And they say the Japanese may try
to import only the simpler, low-value parts from U.S.
companies.</p>
<p>Japanese semiconductor makers are also rushing with
pledges to increase foreign purchases. In the past two weeks,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and Sony Corp. have
confirmed plans to buy 20% of their semiconductors from
foreign makers by the middle of next year, compared with
about 15% now. The announcements are significant because so
far, consumer electronics companies have been the hardest for
foreign companies to supply. But the U.S. government says
Japan has been promising Americans a 20% market share by 1991
since 1986, and the figure currently stands at only 13.9% --
well below the expected path.</p>
<p>The recording industry is also waiting for something more
concrete before expressing satisfaction with Japan, although
Japanese press reports said the government was preparing to
introduce legislation to meet all of the U.S. demands.
Americans are complaining that among other things, Japan's
copyright law doesn't protect foreign recordings made before
1978, the year Japan joined the Geneva convention. "That's
the heart of rock and roll," says Mr. Berman of the
unprotected recordings. "We estimate losses of at least $200
million a year in revenue."</p>
<p>Mr. Berman said just after his meeting with the Foreign
Ministry that he was happy the Japanese government is now
willing to address the problem, "Unfortunately, we're not
sure what `we're going to address it' means," Mr. Berman
said.</p>
