	<p class="article-leader">Pacific Gas & Electric Co. said in a filing that its
second-quarter results will include a $68 million, or 16
cent-a-share, after-tax charge related to a recent legal
settlement with USX Corp.
   Last month, San Francisco-based Pacific Gas paid USX $14
million to settle a dispute over the cause of a water conduit
rupture in 1982 that delayed the start-up of operations at
Pacific Gas's Helms hydroelectric power facility. USX's
predecessor company filed suit in 1983. Of the $68 million
charge, $8 million represents the after-tax cost of the
settlement. The remainder is a reserve related to costs for
the plant repairs, said a company spokesman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Pacific
Gas said the pact came after a jury finding that the conduit
failure was caused by Pacific Gas's negligence. In addition,
"the jury found that . . . {Pacific Gas's} conduct in bidding
the rebuild of the water conduit constituted a fraud on USX,
entitling USX to punitive damages." Pacific Gas said the pact
was a "compromise" and "does not constitute an admission of
liability by either company."</p>
