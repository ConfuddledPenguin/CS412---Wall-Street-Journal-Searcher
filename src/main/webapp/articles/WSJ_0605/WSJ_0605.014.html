	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Sony Corp. said it will begin shipping this
month in the U.S. a tape deck called the digital audio tape,
or DAT, recorder. DAT machines record and play music with
almost no distortion.
   Sony is the first major Japanese electronics concern to
announce a firm price and shipping date for DAT recorders in
the U.S. While DAT machines have a small following in Japan,
most Japanese companies haven't sold the decks in the U.S.
because of opposition from the recording industry, which
argues that the decks will inspire pirating.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sony's entry could change that sheepishness. Japan's
electronics companies typically are quick to follow the lead
of companies such as Sony into new markets.</p>
<p>Sony said it will begin shipping later this month two DAT
models, the $900 DTC-700 and the $950 DTC-75ES. The decks,
which can record digital music directly from compact disks,
contain circuitry meant to prevent rampant copying. Called
the Serial Copy Management System, the circuitry allows the
user to make only one digital copy from a digital music
source, such as a compact disk, that contains a special
copy-prevention signal.</p>
<p>The machine is too highly priced to be accepted by the
mass of U.S. consumers, who tend to put off purchases of
electronic equipment until prices fall below $500. And there
is little music that is pre-recorded on DAT cartridges, which
are slightly smaller than conventional audio cassette tapes.
Industry executives say there must be a critical mass of
thousands of tapes available before sales of the decks take
off.</p>
<p>But Sony said its machines will sell for a street price of
under $800 and that future machines would come down in price
rapidly.</p>
<p>"Once recording companies see DAT as a viable format,
they'll come to the party," said Martin Homlish, president of
Sony Audio Component System Co., the Sony Unit that sells
audio equipment in the U.S. "It just may take a little time,
as it did with the compact disk, which is now the
bread-and-butter of the record industry."</p>
<p>Mr. Homlish said Sony expects Americans to buy about
100,000 DAT players over the next 12 months. In contrast,
about 4.5 million compact-disk players are sold in the U.S.
every year, he said.</p>
<p>Sony said its Sony Classical unit this month will
distribute 10 prerecorded $19.95 DAT cassettes featuring such
musicians as Vladimir Horowitz, Isaac Stern, Zubin Mehta and
Yo-Yo Ma. Sony said its Sony Magnetic Products Co. unit will
sell blank DAT cartridges for $12 to $18.</p>
<p>Sony's announcement wasn't unexpected: Last January it
said it would begin selling the machines this summer, but
didn't give a firm date or prices. Rival Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co. also said in January that it would sell a DAT
machine this year. Other audio heavyweights, such as Pioneer
Electronic Corp., said this month that they don't plan to
sell DAT machines until the prospects of their use are more
certain.</p>
