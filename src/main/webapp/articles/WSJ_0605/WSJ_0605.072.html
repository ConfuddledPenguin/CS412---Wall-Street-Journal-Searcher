	<p class="article-leader">Efforts to cut trial costs by reducing the size of juries
are largely ineffective, according to a two-year study of
cases tried in Los Angeles.
   In addition, the study found, it's more than twice as
likely that at least one black person will serve on a
12-person jury as on an eight-person jury. About 20% of the
eight-person juries in the study included no blacks, and 31%
had no Hispanics.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The National Center for State Courts conducted the study
of 133 civil trials in municipal court in Los Angeles for the
Judicial Council of California. The council will turn the
information over to the state legislature. State law in
California currently allows eight-person juries in civil
trials when both lawyers agree to the reduced size.</p>
<p>Social scientists, judicial scholars and court
administrators have debated the merits of juries with fewer
than the traditional 12 members since the U.S. Supreme Court
held 20 years ago that the Sixth Amendment was not violated
by use of six-member juries. Six-person juries are now the
rule for federal civil cases, while criminal cases in federal
court still require 12 jurors. Only ten states require
12-person juries in civil actions. The rest allow for juries
ranging from six to 10 persons in civil cases.</p>
<p>While smaller juries have been touted as a way to save
time and money in the increasingly overburdened court system,
the Los Angeles study found that there weren't significant
savings of either time or money. In addition, reducing the
number of jurors lessened the mathematical likelihood of
having at least one minority juror in a given case.</p>
<p>Shari Diamond of the American Bar Foundation, an expert on
judicial administration, says the California study is "one
more piece of evidence" that the Supreme Court's decision to
allow six-member juries was "simply wrong."</p>

<p>SIX-MONTH BAN on civil jury trials upheld by Vermont
Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The moratorium was imposed by the high court itself in
January to avert a state deficit. The plaintiffs argued that
a jury trial delayed is equal to a jury trial denied. But the
court rejected the argument, reasoning the trials were not
being delayed an "unreasonably" long time.</p>
<p>"Caseloads cannot be managed on the simplistic position
that everyone is entitled to an immediate trial whenever they
are ready for one. Vermont courts have long exercised the
power to adopt administrative rules having an incidental
effect on the availability of jury trials in some cases,"
writes retired Chief Justice Albert Barney, who was specially
assigned to write the decision.</p>
<p>The moratorium was imposed after the Vermont legislature
ordered the courts to cut $300,000 from the current year
budget. The ban, scheduled to expire July 1, should save
$75,000, says Lee Suskin, director of trial court
administration.</p>
<p>John Evers, secretary for the Vermont Trial Lawyers
Association, which filed the class-action lawsuit, says,
"It's a sad day in this state, or any state, when the highest
court -- which plays the role of highest protector of basic
constitutional rights -- becomes the body that takes those
rights away. That's what happened here. It makes us all a
little nervous."</p>
<p>He says the association doesn't plan to appeal the
decision because it's not contrary to the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p>BEATING UP FLAG-BURNERS could earn a slap on the wrist
under proposed law.</p>
<p>A bill passed by the Louisiana House of Representatives
would impose only a $25 fine for committing battery against
someone who is defacing the American flag. Currently, such an
act would come under much tougher general battery laws, which
carry a jail sentence of as much as six months and a $500
fine.</p>
<p>Critics say the measure, now pending in the state Senate,
would encourage violence against flag-burners. "This is
government by vigilantes," says state Rep. Robert Adley, who
opposed the bill.</p>
<p>State Rep. James David Cain, who sponsored the house bill,
says the proposal is an attempt to "send a message" to the
U.S. Supreme Court, which has ruled that flag-burning is a
protected form of free speech. There hasn't been much
flag-burning in Louisiana, the lawmaker acknowledges, but "it
just appalls me that someone could burn the American flag."</p>
<p>Mr. Cain insists the proposed law "doesn't say you can go
grab somebody and beat him up." He says it would apply only
to "simple" battery, which he defines as using force without
a weapon. Flagburners still are protected by laws imposing
stiffer punishment for "aggravated" battery, and by the
protesters' right to file civil damage suits against anyone
who attacks them, he asserts.</p>
<p>But others say such a law invites physical attacks.
Christopher Blakesley, a law professor at Louisiana State
University, says the state criminal code's definition of
"simple" battery seems to include taking a punch at someone.</p>
<p>If the proposed law covers "simple" battery, "there's
certainly the possibility for doing more than just taking the
flag away," he says. "It certainly leaves room for a punch,
and possibly more than one punch."</p>

<p>COMPANY TURNS TABLES on EPA and wins $199,158 in legal
costs.</p>
<p>The unusual case involves a civil suit filed in 1984 by
the Environmental Protection Agency against Winchester
Municipal Utilities over alleged violations of the Clean
Water Act by the Kentucky city's newly built waste water
treatment plant. The EPA demanded that the defects be
corrected and sought up to $50 million in damages.</p>
<p>Winchester, which contended that the defects were due to
the plant's engineers, ultimately agreed to pay a $10,000
civil penalty. But the EPA, in turn, extended the deadline
for building a new plant, relaxed interim effluent standards
and reduced penalties for violating those standards. The
agency also agreed that Winchester's violations were not
willful misconduct or the result of negligence.</p>
<p>Winchester then sought payment for its attorney fees under
the Equal Access to Justice Act. The federal law permits
defendants sued by the government to recover their costs if
they prevail and if they can show that the government's
position was not "substantially justified."</p>
<p>In this case, U.S. District Judge Henry R. Wilhoit Jr. in
Lexington, Ky., agreed with Winchester. The judge ruled that
the city prevailed because the final settlement was closer to
its original position than to the government's. Furthermore,
the judge found the EPA's demand for civil penalties was not
"substantially justified" because the plant's engineers, not
the city, were responsible for its defects.</p>
<p>An EPA spokesman, calling the decision "absurd," says the
agency clearly won the case by exacting both a civil penalty
against Winchester and an agreement to build a new plant. The
agency plans to recommend that the government appeal.</p>

<p>PLANNED MERGER between New York and Washington law firms
unravels.</p>
<p>Rosenman & Colin, New York, won't be merging its six-man
Washington office with Casson & Harkins, a 24-lawyer firm
based in Washington. The merger plan was reported here
Thursday.</p>
<p>Asked why the merger was scrubbed at the last minute,
Casson & Harkins's Joseph Casson says, "As frequently
happens, you don't focus on some things till the very end."
He declines to elaborate. Spokespersons at Rosenman & Colin
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>But an individual close to Rosenman & Colin says the
merger collapsed in part because of concerns by partners at
Rosenman that their compensation would be adversely affected
by the alliance. Mr. Casson denies that compensation or any
last-minute questions raised solely by Rosenman were factors
in the decision.</p>
<p>Mr. Casson says his firm, which specializes in health
care, would continue to seek a merger with a New York-based
firm with expertise in tax and securities law.</p>
<p>"They're nice guys, we're nice guys," says Mr. Casson.
"Sometimes deals don't happen."</p>

<p>JUDGE GIVES IMELDA MARCOS a week to rest before returning
to court.</p>
<p>Mrs. Marcos, accused of using $200 million stolen from the
Philippines to buy property in the U.S., collapsed in the
courtroom Thursday and was taken to New York Hospital. She
was released from the hospital Sunday, and doctors said she
was suffering from a stomach ailment.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John Keenan, the federal judge
presiding over the case, says he decided to delay the trial
until next Tuesday after speaking to Mrs. Marcos's doctor.
The doctor "said she's okay, but a few days off would do her
good," according to the judge.</p>
<p>Prosecutors are expected to finish presenting their case
against Mrs. Marcos and her alleged co-conspirator Adnan
Khashoggi shortly after the trial resumes. The defense is
expected to finish in time for the jury to begin
deliberations before the end of the month.</p>
