	<p class="article-leader">NASHVILLE, N.C. -- A Washington, D.C., lawyer who drew
national attention last summer when his private plane crashed
into the Atlantic Ocean has been indicted on 455 counts of
securities fraud and related charges.
   A grand jury here returned a total of 2,695 counts of
securities fraud and other charges against Sonrise Management
Services of Columbus, Ga., Telemedia Inc. of Landover, Md.,
several officers and owners of the two firms and Thomas Root,
the Washington lawyer who allegedly provided legal services
for Sonrise clients.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Root, in a July flight from Washington to Rocky Mount,
N.C., reported blacking out in the cockpit of his
single-engine plane. The aircraft, followed by military
planes, eventually crashed in the Caribbean. Mr. Root
survived the crash, but was pulled from the water with a
gunshot wound in his stomach.</p>
<p>The charges arise from Sonrise's claims that individuals
who invested in the company would receive help in applying
for licenses for radio stations from the Federal
Communications Commission. The district attorney in Nashville
said only a handful of Sonrise's more than 1,600 investors --
who put down more than $16 million -- ever received an FCC
license.</p>
<p>Officials at Sonrise and Telemedia, an
engineering-consulting firm allegedly involved with Sonrise,
couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Root was also
unavailable for comment.</p>
