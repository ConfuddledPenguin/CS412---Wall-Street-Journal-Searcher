	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and the
ten provincial premiers will resume talks this morning in a
bid to resolve Canada's constitutional impasse after making
only limited progress yesterday.
   Mr. Mulroney said last night that a federal government
proposal designed to end the impasse "found a large measure
of acceptance." But two of the three provincial premiers who
have been blocking ratification of a package of amendments to
the Canadian constitution said the new federal plan didn't
satisfy their demands.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday evening's negotiations followed preliminary
discussions Sunday and yesterday morning during which the
provincial leaders set out their positions on the package of
amendments, known as the Meech Lake accord.</p>
<p>Three provinces, Newfoundland, New Brunswick and Manitoba
refuse to ratify the Meech Lake accord as is. The accord is
supported by the other seven provinces and the federal
government.</p>
<p>New Brunswick Premier Frank McKenna said the new federal
proposal "in substance meets most or all of the concerns" of
his province. Mr. McKenna said that if a few details are
ironed out to his satisfaction New Brunswick is now prepared
to ratify the Meech Lake accord.</p>
<p>But the two other holdout provinces didn't budge.
Newfoundland Premier Clyde Wells said "I'm quite unhappy
with" the federal plan. Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon said: "I
really didn't see any tangible progress."</p>
<p>The constitutional deadlock has revived independence talk
in French-speaking Quebec. Many Quebeckers have taken as a
rebuff to their province the widespread opposition of
English-speaking Canadians to the Meech Lake accord, which
would recognize Quebec as a "distinct society" within Canada.
Such a designation would be used by the courts in
interpreting the constitution, but wouldn't give Quebec any
new legislative powers, federal officials said.</p>
<p>Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa reiterated last night that
he wouldn't accept any changes to the Meech Lake accord. But
he said the new federal proposal "wasn't controversial for
Quebec" and dealt mostly with matters to be discussed in
future rounds of constitutional negotiations once the Meech
Lake accord is ratified.</p>
<p>The Meech Lake accord, which was negotiated three years
ago at Meech Lake, Quebec, has to be ratified by all
provincial legislatures by a legal deadline of June 23 if it
is to take effect.</p>
<p>Besides the "distinct society" clause, Manitoba and
Newfoundland object to a measure that would give each
province a veto over reform of the federal Senate, an
appointed body. Newfoundland and Manitoba fear such a veto
would rule out their goal of smaller provinces, like
themselves, achieving greater influence over federal policies
through a reformed Senate.</p>
<p>Mr. Bourassa reaffirmed yesterday that Senate reform
should require the unanimous approval of all provinces
because such reform would affect provincial powers.
Currently, Quebec and Ontario have the largest representation
in the Senate. Most reform proposals would give each province
equal representation in the Senate such as exists in the U.S.
Senate.</p>
<p>Mr. Mulroney said the Meech Lake dispute now "centers
around the {Senate} amending formula." But several premiers
said the "distinct society" clause, the other major sticking
point, wasn't discussed yesterday, adding that it would
probably would be on the agenda today. Quebec officials
repeated that the clause is "untouchable."</p>
