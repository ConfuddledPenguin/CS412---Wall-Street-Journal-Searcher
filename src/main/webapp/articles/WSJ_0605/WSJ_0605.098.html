	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Chase Manhattan Corp. named Joel H. Glasky
managing director and division executive in charge of the
private placements unit of Chase Securities Inc., the bank
holding company's securities subsidiary.
   The 41-year-old Mr. Glasky comes to Chase after five years
in a similar post at Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., a
unit of American Express Co., where he supervised or
participated in over 200 private placement transactions
totaling more than $11 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Private placements are the sale of securities to small
groups of institutions rather than to the public at large.
Because the buyers of such securities are assumed to be
sophisticated investors, the issuance of private-placement
securities don't need the lengthy and complex filings with
regulatory authorities that are required of issues sold to
the public.</p>
