	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that workers in the
nuclear industry who allege that their employers fired them
for pointing out safety problems may sue for damages under
state laws.
   In a decision written by Justice Harry Blackmun, the high
court ruled, 9-0, that federal laws regulating the nuclear
industry don't preclude so-called whistleblowers from suing
for the emotional distress caused by their employers'
treatment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ruling is a defeat for the nuclear industry, which now
faces lawsuits under disparate state personal-injury laws
instead of being held accountable under a single federal law.</p>
<p>The decision reinstates a lawsuit against General Electric
Co. by Vera English, a former employee at the nuclearfuels
plant in Wilmington, N.C. According to GE, the suit asks for
about $1.5 million in compensatory damages and nearly $2.3
billion in punitive damages.</p>
<p>Ms. English was fired in 1984 after she complained that
spills of radioactive materials weren't being properly
cleaned up by workers. To prove her point, she left a
radioactive work area uncleaned and showed her supervisor a
few days later that it hadn't been cleaned or even noticed.</p>
<p>After her dismissal, she filed administrative claims under
federal labor law with the Labor Department, but they were
dismissed. So she sued the company for emotional distress.</p>
<p>Both a federal district court in North Carolina and a
federal appeals court in Richmond, Va., dismissed the
lawsuit, ruling that federal law pre-empted her claims.
Yesterday, the Supreme Court reversed the appeals court
decision.</p>
<p>"As a result of the Supreme Court decision the case will
go back to the federal district court in North Carolina," a
GE spokesman said. "GE is confident it will prevail on the
merits of the state tort claim, which the Supreme Court said
was not pre-empted by the federal law." (English vs. General
Electric Co.)</p>
<p>Lawyer Advertising</p>
<p>The justices ruled, 5-4, that states can't prohibit
lawyers from truthfully advertising themselves as specialists
in certain areas. The high court ruled that although such
advertising may be regulated by states to determine whether
it is truthful, it is protected by the First Amendment and
can't be entirely barred.</p>
<p>The high court ruled against Illinois officials for their
1989 censure of an Edwardsville, Ill., lawyer. The lawyer
noted on his stationery that he is certified as a specialist
in civil trials by the National Board of Trial Advocacy, a
lawyers group that sets standards and maintains lists of
those who have met them.</p>
<p>Illinois officials censured him because the state
professional code for lawyers prohibits claims of
specialization. Similar bans are contained in the codes of
about 15 other states.</p>
<p>But in an opinion written by Justice John Stevens, the
high court ruled that the letterhead is a form of advertising
that is protected by the First Amendment. Justice Stevens's
opinion only commanded four votes, but Justice Thurgood
Marshall provided a fifth vote, agreeing for separate reasons
that the Illinois ban was invalid.</p>
<p>Justice Byron White dissented. Justice Sandra O'Connor
also dissented, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justice Antonin Scalia. (Peel vs. Attorney Disciplinary
Commission)</p>
<p>State Bar Dues</p>
<p>The high court ruled, 9-0, that the use of compulsory bar
association dues for lobbying and to support political causes
violates the First Amendment rights of lawyers who object to
the positions advocated.</p>
<p>The decision, written by Chief Justice Rehnquist, was a
defeat for the State Bar of California. But it will affect
other states as well. In recent years, some 30 states have
had mandatory bar associations, those that lawyers are
required to join. Many of these bar associations use a
portion of their compulsory dues to become involved in local
political issues.</p>
<p>In California, the state bar used dues to lobby for
legislation, file friend-of-the-court briefs, and adopt
resolutions supporting gun control and a nuclear freeze. In a
challenge by 21 lawyers, the California Supreme Court upheld
the bar's activities.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed that ruling.
The court said that a state bar may spend dues to lobby on
issues directly related to the profession, such as
legislation on lawyers' ethics, but not for other, unrelated
matters.</p>
<p>The decision subjects bar associations to the same limits
on dues that the court has imposed on labor unions, although
the American Bar Association had urged the high court to
grant more flexibility. (Keller vs. State Bar of California)</p>
<p>Natural Gas Pricing</p>
<p>The justices agreed to decide whether Congress gave the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the authority to revamp
the pricing for natural gas from wells that were in
production before November 1978. A federal appeals court in
New Orleans ruled in September 1989 that the commission
exceeded its authority in 1986 when it revamped the pricing
system for so-called old natural gas.</p>
<p>If the justices uphold the appeals court ruling, the
commission may order producers to refund $100 million to
consumers, industry groups say.</p>
<p>Old gas is gas produced from wells that were already in
operation when the federal Natural Gas Policy Act took effect
in November 1978. Congress set higher price ceilings for
so-called new gas, gas that would come from newer wells, and
lower ceilings for old gas. But the 1978 federal law also
preserved 15 different categories of old gas with varying
price ceilings, based on the age of the wells.</p>
<p>In 1986, the FERC concluded that the ceilings for old gas
were so low that producers were abandoning old wells, leaving
huge untapped reserves and prompting greater reliance on
imports and on higher-priced new wells. The commission
consolidated old gas into one category, raised the price, and
required producers to renegotiate their contracts.</p>
<p>Pipeline companies, consumers and distributors challenged
FERC's authority for the orders and won in appeals court.</p>
<p>The case was appealed to the high court by the commission
and by two dozen natural gas producers. They said the appeals
court ruling will disrupt natural gas markets and 1,600
natural gas supply contracts that have been renegotiated.

<p>Airline Lawsuits</p>
<p>The high court agreed to decide whether a treaty that
governs liability for international airline flights allows
passengers to sue for damages for emotional distress because
of near mishaps, even though there were no physical injuries.
The justices agreed to hear an appeal by Texas Air Corp.'s
Eastern Airlines Inc. unit.</p>
<p>The case stems from 25 separate lawsuits filed against the
airline under Florida and federal laws by passengers who were
on an Eastern flight in 1983 from Miami to the Bahamas. Soon
after takeoff the engines shut down, and passengers were told
the plane would have to ditch in the Atlantic Ocean. The
pilots were able to restart one engine and return to Miami,
but not before the plane sharply lost altitude.</p>
<p>Most international flights are subject to a treaty,
approved by the U.S. in 1934 and modified in 1966, that
limits airline liability for accidents to property and
individuals.</p>
<p>Last year, a federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled that
the treaty allows lawsuits for emotional distress, even when
there was no physical injury. A federal district court had
dismissed the lawsuits before trial. (Eastern Airlines Inc.
vs. Floyd)</p>
<p>Alabama Business Tax</p>
<p>The high court let stand an Alabama Supreme Court ruling
that the state's franchise tax for corporations doesn't
discriminate against companies located in other states. The
high court refused to hear appeals by General Motors Corp.
and Reynolds Metals Co. General Motors challenged the $6.3
million that it and several subsidiaries paid from 1983
through 1988. Reynolds objected to $1.2 million it paid in
1982 and 1983.</p>
<p>The companies argued that the franchise tax, imposed on
all corporations doing business in Alabama, is calculated
differently for companies based in Alabama than for those
based in other states. The result, they argued, is a much
heavier tax on out-of-state corporations than on those based
in Alabama. But the Alabama Supreme Court concluded that the
tax doesn't violate either the 14th Amendment guarantee of
"equal protection of the laws" or the Constitution's
prohibition on interference with interstate commerce.
