	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The productivity of U.S. business plummeted
in the first three months of this year at a far steeper rate
than the government initially reported. At the same time,
business costs escalated much faster.
   After reviewing new data, the Labor Department said
productivity, excluding that of farm workers, plunged at a
2.7% annual rate in the first quarter, not at the 1% rate the
department originally calculated. That marked the biggest
decline since the fourth quarter of 1981, when the country
was in a recession. In last year's fourth quarter non-farm
productivity edged up at a 0.5% annual rate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, the cost of producing a unit of output --
whether it was a television set or a financial service --
jumped at a 7% annual rate for nonagricultural businesses,
the department said. In an advance report, the agency had
calculated that unit labor costs rose at a 4.5% rate during
the period. These costs grew at a 5.5% annual rate in the
fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The deep revisions disturbed economists, although they
have been worried for some time about the nation's inability
to make significant advances in productivity.</p>
<p>"I thought it was a dismal report," said Allen Sinai,
chief economist at Boston Co. in New York.</p>
<p>Gains in productivity -- or output per hour worked -- are
vital to continued economic growth. The more workers produce
per hour, the better businesses are able to compete across
the globe. Improving productivity is also critical to raising
the country's living standards because it allows businesses
to boost wages without forcing a corresponding increase in
prices or cut in profits.</p>
<p>As they have for some time, the numbers showed that most
of the country's productivity problems are centered in the
economy's vast services sector. Manufacturing productivity,
which is far more precisely measured, actually improved even
more than the big jump the government calculated in its
advance report. It grew at a 4.9% annual rate instead of
4.1%, the department said. The fourth quarter rate of
increase was 3.1%</p>
<p>Partly because of the big gains in output per hour, it
cost manufacturers less to produce their wares during the
period. Manufacturers' unit labor costs declined at a 1.3%
annual rate in the first quarter, a bigger drop than the 0.9%
rate the government initially calculated. Unit labor costs of
manufacturers rose at a 3.7% annual rate in the fourth
period.</p>
<p>That, at least, pleased economists. "Manufacturing is
finally showing the benefits of a year of cost-cutting and
employee cutbacks," Mr. Sinai said. "The non-manufacturing,
non-farm sector, which largely includes services, is where
the dismal record lies both on productivity growth and unit
labor costs."</p>
<p>Generally the deep downward revisions reflected the fact
that the gross national product -- the country's total output
of goods and services -- was smaller in the first quarter
than the government initially believed. The Commerce
Department regularly makes revisions to its estimate of the
GNP as it gathers more information. Based on new data the
department reported earlier this month that the GNP grew at a
1.3% annual rate in the first quarter after adjusting for
inflation, instead of 2.1%.</p>
<p>Gordon Richards, an economist at the National Association
of Manufacturers, said the overall first-quarter productivity
figures weren't consistent with the GNP report and called
them "suspiciously low." He said "it would be reasonable to
expect further revisions either in these productivity numbers
or in the first-quarter GNP estimate."</p>
<p>The Labor Department figured that the output of non-farm
businesses grew only at a 1% annual rate in the first quarter
instead of 2.7%. At the same time it estimated that hours
logged by workers rose at a 3.9% annual rate instead of 3.6%.</p>
<p>The department also released its initial measure of the
productivity of nonfinancial businesses in the first quarter,
a category that covers all corporations doing business in the
U.S. except banks, brokers and finance and insurance
agencies. The results there were grim as well: Output per
hour dropped at a 2.1% annual rate. The department will
revise those figures in the next few months. In the fourth
quarter, productivity of nonfinancial business fell at a 0.6%
annual rate.</p>
<p>Including farms, which economists believe is a less
precise indicator of pressures in the economy, overall
business productivity tumbled at a 2.1% annual rate last
quarter, according to the new report, instead of the 0.5%
rate of decline originally calculated. In the fourth quarter
business productivity edged up 0.4%.</p>
<p>All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>
