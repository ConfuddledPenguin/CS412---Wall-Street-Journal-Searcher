	<p class="article-leader">Shelby Williams Industries Inc. said it expects earnings
in its second quarter ending June 30 to be lower than the
year earlier's record $1.9 million, or 20 cents a share.
   Manfred Steinfeld, chairman and chief executive officer,
said order rates for the Chicago-based company's seats used
in restaurants and other businesses have slowed sharply in
recent weeks.</p>
