	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and
South Korean President Roh Tae Woo said that their two
countries are moving toward establishing diplomatic
relations.
   Last night's announcement foreshadowed an adjustment of
East Asian political and economic relationships that could
potentially be as dramatic as the overhaul of Soviet society
that Mr. Gorbachev is struggling to nurture at home.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The Korean peninsula remains the last area of tension in
the Cold War," said President Roh. "The Cold War on the
Korean peninsula now begins to crack."</p>
<p>Mr. Roh called his unusual meeting with Mr. Gorbachev --
the first between leaders of their two nations since the
division of the peninsula in 1948 -- in a San Francisco hotel
an "epic-making event" and "an important turning point."
While setting no timetable for normalizing relations, he said
it would provide a strong impetus for promoting a new Pacific
order and reducing tensions between the two Koreas. "We do
not want North Korea to remain isolated," he said.</p>
<p>Both the South Koreans and the Soviets -- frosty
adversaries in four decades of mistrust -- now are hungry for
closer trade relations. But Soviet initiatives until now have
been stymied by the knowledge that any movement in that
direction would trouble the hard-line North Korean regime of
Kim Il Sung, who has maintained strong links with Moscow.</p>
<p>Soviet-South Korean trade amounted to only $31 million in
1981, and bilateral relations were all but nonexistent as
recently as two years ago. They opened respective trade
offices only 14 months ago, and the Soviet consular office in
Seoul wasn't opened until April. But trade has been
increasing substantially, and before last night's
developments, the volume of trade was expected to reach $2
billion early in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev's meeting with the South Korean president
came at the end of a whirlwind, five-day U.S. tour that took
the Soviet leader to the White House, the Maryland mountains,
the plains of Minnesota and the Pacific coast. But when Mr.
Gorbachev returns to the Soviet Union with his trade,
environmental and defense pacts, he will be met with internal
political disputes, ethnic passions, food shortages and
economic distress.</p>
<p>In his last day here, Mr. Gorbachev, who has pursued "new
structures" in his drive for perestroika at home, called on
Americans to join him in developing "new structures" in
international relations.</p>
<p>The Soviet leader urged the U.S. and the Soviet Union to
move away from the "twin antipathies" of the West and East
blocs. "They divided countries and peoples much more than
they united them," he told students at Stanford University.</p>
<p>His final day included tea and sympathy with former
President Reagan and Nancy Reagan, a stroll through Stanford,
a drive through the storied hills of San Francisco and more
of the impromptu sidewalk street seminars that have marked
the Soviet leader's U.S. journeys.</p>
<p>Though the metaphor was mixed, the message that animated
almost every public moment of the Gorbachev tour was clear:
"The winds are now blowing," Mr. Gorbachev told members of
the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon,
"filling the sails of the process that places us on the path
of cooperation."</p>
<p>Indeed, the thrust of Mr. Gorbachev's appeal yesterday was
to stress the challenges the Soviet Union faces in battling
"old thinking," to assert that he had "no illusions as to the
possibility of the faster rapprochement of our societies,"
and to argue that the Western alliance itself would have to
evolve to match changes that have occurred since the Iron
Curtain shredded across Europe.</p>
<p>"Everyone must change," he said.</p>
<p>But Mr. Gorbachev, who began his mission as a
commander-in-chief with geopolitics on his mind, concluded it
as a chief executive with investment on his mind -- and
revealed himself to be as shrewd a businessman as he is a
rhetorician.</p>
<p>"We are now watching those who maybe are risking something
but willing to cooperate and watching those who sit on the
sidelines," he told the business executives. "Those who
cooperate with us will obtain many more opportunities in our
market. Those who stand on the side will stay there."</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev said the Soviet Union is moving more rapidly
toward a convertible ruble and assured his audiences that, in
all sectors of society, "we are changing in a serious way and
not just sweeping the yard."</p>
<p>Declaring that the Cold War "is now behind us," Mr.
Gorbachev told the Stanford students that setting aside the
"exhausting and dangerous confrontation" of the postwar era
would enable the Soviet Union to proceed down its new
economic path. "As Soviet-American relations improve," he
said, "military procurement and participation in the arms
race will become a thing of the past."</p>
<p>Mr. Reagan emerged from his 45-minute meeting with the
Soviet president with the conclusion that there "have been
improvements" in U.S.-Soviet relations since Mr. Reagan left
office only 16 months ago. "I'm pleased with all that's taken
place," he said, expressing the hope that "it's going to
continue."</p>
<p>As Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev -- one a doctrinaire
anti-Communist for most of his life, the other a doctrinaire
Marxist-Leninist for most of his -- spoke in the elegant
brick Soviet consulate in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of
San Francisco, their wives met separately.</p>
<p>Mrs. Reagan said the meeting with Raisa Gorbachev -- who
was later pictured lingering at a display of bananas, oranges
and Snickers bars -- went well, and that she had an easy
rapport with the woman she once regarded as something of a
socialist ice queen. "There has been a great misunderstanding
about our relationship," she said.</p>
