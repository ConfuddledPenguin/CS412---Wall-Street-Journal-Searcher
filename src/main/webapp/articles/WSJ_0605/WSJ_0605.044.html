	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- The Charles Schwab discount brokerage
office is buzzing as grizzled stock watchers and retirees
stare intently at stock prices flashing by on the electronic
display board overhead. Younger men in their 30s, dressed
casually in slacks and sport shirts, cluster around Quotron
machines.
   Then Angel Tompkins, a blond actress in trim white slacks
and peach T-shirt, sashays up to a Quotron machine to check
out some stocks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Could this be an indicator? According to ancient market
wisdom, when the likes of film stars and taxi drivers become
buyers of stocks, it's time to think about becoming a seller.
The non-professionals, the reasoning goes, have a habit of
relying on hot tips and buying frothy stocks -- thus helping
create the kind of market euphoria that leads inexorably to a
plunge.</p>
<p>But not this one. Even though Ms. Tompkins played a
negligee-clad bimbo in "Amazon Women on the Moon," a 1986
spoof of late-night television, she is no lightweight. She
says that since 1972, she has turned a credit-card debt of
$62,000 into a $100,000 portfolio of six carefully selected
stocks. Her research includes daily tracking of 215 stocks.</p>
<p>"I am not a gambler," Ms. Tompkins says. Her main
criterion in stock selection: "Is the company merely
promising satisfaction to its customers, or do they really
deliver it?"</p>
<p>The scene here at Schwab's office in the Century City
section of Los Angeles appears to be a microcosm of what
small investors around the U.S. have been doing. Even though
the Dow Jones Industrial Average has rallied 10.5% over the
past five weeks -- it surged 34.22 points yesterday to a
record 2935.19 -- small investors by and large aren't chasing
blindly after untested stocks with high-tech names. Most of
those in Schwab's office are cautiously following blue chips
such as General Electric, IBM and McDonald's.</p>
<p>"Individuals' activity is up, but they are still
skeptical. So far, they are doing more selling of individual
stocks than buying," says Robert Farrell, the chief technical
analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. At Schwab, individuals have
recently started to buy more than they sell, though just
barely.</p>
<p>What small investors want more of is stock mutual funds.
So far this year, buyers of stock funds have outstripped
sellers at a rate of $1.9 billion a month. Their net
purchases total $7.8 billion, up from $5.8 billion in all
last year.</p>
<p>Vanguard Group has opened 168,089 accounts this year,
compared with 65,149 for the comparable period two years ago.
In May, fund groups such as Fidelity Investments,
Massachusetts Financial Services and New England Securities
reported the strongest monthly inflows into stock funds since
1987. The number of telephone calls received by T. Rowe Price
Associates rose 17% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>For Eric Kobren, publisher of Fidelity Insight, an
independent newsletter on Fidelity, the market's rise is a
boon. His subscribers now total 30,000, up from 12,000 after
the October 1987 crash and well ahead of the 23,000 just
before it. "Isn't it crazy?" he says. "With my marketing hat
on, I'm saying, `Let's go, let's go.' But with my investing
hat on, I'm much more cautious."</p>
<p>Thomas Quick, president of Quick & Reilly Inc., says that
52% of the customers at his discount brokerage firm have been
selling stocks lately but that his business has picked up.
"We are hearing from people we haven't heard from in a couple
of years," he adds. However, he says his customers' activity
is a long way from the euphoria just before the crash.</p>
<p>Ever since then, individual investors have sold into
market rallies and bought on price weakness, according to
Philip J. Roth, chief technical analyst at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. Says Merrill Lynch's Mr. Farrell: "They've
gotten the right rhythm."</p>
<p>That's not, however, what a lot of fund managers,
securities analysts and other market professionals think. One
veteran surveyor of household opinion, Albert Sindlinger of
Wallingford, Pa., says small investors are merely "putting
their money where their hopes are." His firm, which surveys
800 households a week, finds that their short-term plans to
buy stock have increased, to 9% of those questioned on May 28
from only 3% a month earlier.</p>
<p>"A bunch of foolish people are convinced that interest
rates will decline with no recession and inflation under
control," Mr. Sindlinger warns. But in his opinion, "this
can't happen. We've got too many debts." He views the current
rally as "a bear-market trap for suckers" -- a brief upsurge
preceding a sharp decline.</p>
<p>In any event, the heavy stock-buying these days isn't the
work of individuals but of mutual funds, pension funds and
other institutions. "Large investors over the past couple of
weeks have been putting money back into the stock market,"
says Peter VandenBerg, a senior vice president and block
trader at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. "Interest rates are
falling, making stocks more attractive, and there is a better
feeling about corporate profits." He adds that whenever stock
prices slide a bit, big institutions are ready to step in and
buy.</p>
<p>And with the public buying stock mutual funds, Dean
Witter's Mr. Roth says, "performance pressures are forcing
the pros to buy stocks" even though many of them have been
bearish for a long time.</p>
<p>Moreover, some analysts say, stocks in general are fairly
valued by most measures. Many strategists think interest
rates are headed lower -- a plus for stocks -- and many
analysts have been raising their earnings estimates for the
second half and 1991.</p>
<p>Polls of investment advisers, futures players and investor
organizations such as the American Association of Individual
Investors indicate "bullishness, but none of them show
excessive bullishness," Mr. Roth says. Analysts see the small
investors' caution as a good sign. When too many people are
enthusiastic, analysts fear that crowd psychology has lifted
stock prices beyond their true worth and has used up the
supply of buyers, setting up conditions for a severe
correction.</p>
<p>So far this is "the quiet bull market," says George A.
Froley III, a managing director of Froley Revy Investment
Co., of Los Angeles. "It has featured no big excesses. Any
stock that's frothy comes back down. But the big stocks keep
chugging up. When the Dow gets to 3000, people are going to
say: `Why am I not in it?'"</p>
<p>John Markese, executive vice president of the American
Association of Individual Investors, says surveys show his
members increasingly believe that any bad news probably is
already out. "They are looking six to nine months down the
line, and declining short-term and long-term interest rates
are making stocks look better," he says.</p>
<p>The regulars at Schwab's Century City office are buying
stocks they know and understand. Howard Caplan, a retired
70-year-old from Encino, Calif., who is wearing a maroon
jogging suit and white captain's hat, says the U.S. has
"plenty of unfinished business -- the savings and loan mess
and the budget deficit" -- but he's still bullish. "Real
estate is crashing and gold stinks, so people will turn to
Procter & Gamble, General Motors and General Electric," he
says. "It's a selective market. I like the blue chips." He
already owns Chevron, GM, Exxon, Citicorp and Allied-Signal.</p>
<p>Ms. Tompkins, who has been in several movies, knows show
biz, so that's where she puts much of her money. Her big
holdings are in Sony, which owns Columbia Pictures, and News
Corp., the Australian concern that owns TV stations,
newspapers and Twentieth Century Fox Film. She says most
investors don't "have any notion of the profit potential" of
the film libraries owned by the two companies. "They are
continual revenue makers," she says.</p>
<p>Small investors around the country seem to be following
the same big-company script. Tom Collins, 47-year-old owner
of a mobile-home business in Athens, Ga., who buys and sells
stocks via his personal computer, has purchased shares of
Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and Reebok International. Melvin Kagan, a
59-year-old retired airline pilot in Honolulu, is adding to
his position in Boeing. "They have a fabulous backlog, and
they have their costs under control," he figures. "There's
still a lot more growth left in that stock."</p>
<p>Young investors also like the big stocks. Mark Wurth is a
17-year-old senior at St. Mary's High School in Paducah, Ky.,
where the nuns are continually telling him to put away his
Wall Street Journal, and he has been investing since age 15
with money borrowed from his parents. "There is still money
to be made in the blue-chip stocks," he declares. He adds
that he would like to borrow more money to buy Coca-Cola and
Walt Disney because he thinks both stocks will climb, split
and climb further.</p>
<p>Companies that may play a role in the economic development
of Eastern Europe are also in vogue with many small
investors. Mary Jane Jarvis, a 57-year-old in Westport,
Conn., says she has bought U.S. stocks with significant
investments going into Europe. Among them are McDonald's,
PepsiCo and Coke. "We'll have to be patient, but, over the
decade, these stocks will do well because of the developing
European markets," she says.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, international stock funds have been the
hottest seller among mutual funds this year. In April,
American Fund Group's Smallcap World Fund racked up sales of
$662 million in its initial offering -- the second-largest
initial stock mutual fund offering on record.</p>
<p>The popularity of international funds is a bit surprising.
Such funds are risky because they put investors at the mercy
of fluctuating currencies as well as volatile foreign stock
markets. And it contrasts sharply with the first four months
of last year, when the only types of stock funds racking up
net inflows of new money were the relatively staid
equity-income funds and growth-and-income funds.</p>
<p>However, a sizable number of small investors remain
skeptical enough to sit this rally out. John K. Byerlein, a
63-year-old industrial-products sales manager in Newport
Beach, Calif., watches stocks' price momentum and compares it
with their historical price patterns and the price patterns
of the entire market. If the market drops below certain
volume figures and if the numbers of advancing and declining
stocks indicate weakness, Mr. Byerlein stays out. So far, he
has been keeping his money in short-term bonds and cash.</p>
<p>"I'm disappointed to miss the run-up in the favored 50
stocks," he says, but adds: "So far, the rally hasn't been
broad enough. My advance/decline indicators aren't positive
enough for me to take a position."</p>
<p>The overall economy also troubles him. "The national debt,
the trade deficit, slowing in the housing market, a recession
ahead, declines in auto sales -- all these disturb me." A
possible "market decline of 700 points" in the Dow Jones
industrials keeps him on the sidelines, he says.</p>
<p>Maybe such a plunge is looming, but you can't prove it by
the regulars of Schwab's Century City office, veterans of a
lot of stock-market history.</p>
<p>Oscar Markowitz of Beverly Hills, an 82-year-old retired
owner of specialty clothing stores who has been through good
times and bad, says he has no fear of the current market.
"Good securities will always be good," he says. "I don't buy
cheap stocks. If I lose, I don't have time to make my money
back."</p>
<p>Recently, he has purchased shares in General Electric and
Westinghouse Electric. Among his other holdings: Philip
Morris and Ford.</p>
<p>"Everything in the market is patience," advises Dorothy
Caplan, Howard Caplan's wife. "These young people think they
can make a killing with puts and calls. You can't predict the
market day by day, week by week. But you can over the long
term. It takes patience, patience, patience."</p>
