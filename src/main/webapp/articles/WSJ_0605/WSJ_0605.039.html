	<p class="article-leader">Jury selection in the drug and perjury trial of Washington
Mayor Marion Barry began yesterday. Can Mayor Barry get a
fair trial in Washington in the face of intensive pre-trial
publicity? Yes, as long as the court fulfills its
constitutional duty to empanel an impartial, not ignorant,
jury.
   The Sixth Amendment to the Constitution requires that
criminal defendants be tried by an "impartial jury of the
State and district wherein the crime shall have been
committed." Many judges, however, equate "impartial" with
uninformed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The problem is not a new one. In 1871, Mark Twain
described the system by which jurors are selected as putting
"a ban upon intelligence and honesty, and a premium upon
ignorance, stupidity, and perjury." Twain's concern was that
judges were responding to the dramatic expansion of the media
-- in 1871, "telegraph and newspapers" -- by banning informed
citizens from juries.</p>
<p>Today technology, combined with an insatiable public
curiosity, has led to an explosion in news coverage and
dramatic re-enactments of crimes. The average hours of TV
usage by household is 7.2 hours a day; average radio usage is
almost three hours a day. And more than 64% of American
households read newspapers.</p>
<p>It is next to impossible for a citizen to be unaware of
major crimes in his community. Even on the national level,
Manuel Noriega, Lt. Col. Oliver North, Exxon Valdez tanker
captain Joseph Hazelwood, billionaire Leona Helmsley, as well
as Mayor Barry, are household names.</p>
<p>Some judges dismiss potential jurors merely because they
are media-literate. Other judges, concerned about the
possibility of not being able to seat a jury in
media-intensive trials, go the opposite way and -- running
roughshod over the Sixth Amendment -- ignore suggestions of
deep bias from potential jurors. The apparent majority,
however, take a middle road and attempt to inquire about
possibly biasing media exposure and to determine whether that
exposure will affect the ability of jurors to be impartial.</p>
<p>The primary means through which they do this is voir dire.
Through a series of questions, the judge (and/or, in many
courts, attorneys) questions potential jurors in an effort to
determine whether they can be impartial. Many critics argue
that voir dire fails to elicit accurate or honest responses
from potential jurors. Who is going to admit publicly to
being a bigot? In fact, some attorneys believe that potential
jurors admit prejudice only as a convenient means of avoiding
jury duty.</p>
<p>Many jurors underestimate their exposure, but with
follow-up questions demonstrate considerable knowledge about
the case. For instance, in the State v. Copeland trial, in
which a black defendant was tried in Medart, Fla., for the
brutal 1978 murder of a 19-year-old white woman, one juror
denied having any knowledge of the case, but admitted upon
further questioning to having "read it and discussed it and
read it in the newspapers."</p>
<p>Even when the voir dire is conducted in the judge's
chambers away from public and press scrutiny, the procedure
is rife with impediments to identifying jurors most likely to
be impartial. For instance, judges and lawyers often indicate
the answers they want.</p>
<p>In Copeland the judge asked: "You haven't read about it
{the case} or heard it on television or anything or discussed
it with anybody whereby you might have formed an opinion
about the case?" And, "well, from what you're telling me,
then, you could sit here and be fair and impartial and listen
to the evidence as it comes to you, as it is presented in
this courtroom and based solely on that evidence?"</p>
<p>Effective voir dire questions are difficult to frame.
Vague, open-ended queries frequently fail to elicit
information about possible bias. Jurors may not understand
what information is prejudicial or improper, or may not even
be aware that they have been exposed to prejudicial
publicity. Specific questions, on the other hand, may give
the potential juror exactly the information the attorney
wants to be certain the juror does not have.</p>
<p>But the ineffectiveness of existing techniques for
identifying and minimizing the impact of bias does not mean
that Mayor Barry cannot get a fair trial. The key lies in
defining an impartial juror. Jurors are not value free and
juries are not blank slates. Nor were they intended to be.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court has identified a number of essential
roles for juries. The most important, according to the court,
is to protect citizens against "arbitrary law enforcement,"
"the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor," and "the compliant,
biased, or eccentric judge." Juries, the court has written,
"interpos{e} between the accused and his accuser . . . the
common-sense judgment of a group of laymen."</p>
<p>If it is to safeguard liberty, protect against official
malfeasance, and represent the community -- as well as
determine the guilt or innocence of the accused -- the jury
must be composed of members with diverse backgrounds,
experience and views. This is why cases are decided by juries
and not individual jurors. The jurors should also be active,
informed members of the community. In fact, the skills of
discernment that most citizens exercise and refine daily in
evaluating the barrage of news, advertising and rhetoric
presented by the media may help jurors to be both impartial
and capable.</p>
<p>As the Supreme Court wrote almost 30 years ago: "It is
sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or
opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented
in court."</p>
<p>The role of courts, then, is not to eliminate all
potential jurors who are media-literate, ignore all evidence
of possible media-induced bias, or rely blindly on
ineffective, ill-targeted methods for controlling bias.
Rather, courts must inquire specifically as to what each
potential juror knows about the case, whether he holds
opinions about the guilt or innocence of the defendant, and
whether those opinions can be laid aside and a verdict
rendered based on the facts admitted into evidence.</p>
<p>This will help the court judge potential jurors'
credibility and the likelihood they can render a decision
based on the evidence. Perhaps more important, it will help
potential jurors consider their own ability to live up to the
constitutional requirement of impartiality and help them
guard against improper bias throughout the trial.</p>
<p>As Mark Twain said: "In this age, when a gentleman of high
social standing, intelligence, and probity swears that
testimony given under solemn oath will outweigh, with him,
street talk and newspaper reports based upon mere hearsay, he
is worth a hundred jurymen who will swear to their own
ignorance and stupidity, and justice would be far safer in
his hands than in theirs. Why could not the jury law be so
altered as to give men of brains and honesty an equal chance
with fools and miscreants?"</p>
