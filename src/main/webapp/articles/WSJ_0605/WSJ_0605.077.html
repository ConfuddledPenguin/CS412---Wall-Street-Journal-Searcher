	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Herbert S. Freiman, a vice chairman of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., is retiring later this year
after 16 years at the securities firm and its predecessors,
company officials said.
   The retirement of Mr. Freiman, who turned 60 years old a
few months ago, is the latest in a line of senior-level
departures from Shearson this year, although it apparently is
unrelated to the firm's recent troubles.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shearson, an American Express Co. unit, in recent months
has announced the resignations or retirements of its chairman
and chief executive officer, Peter Cohen; its president,
Jeffrey Lane; its head of public-brokerage business, Hardwick
Simmons; its chief administrative officer, Robert M. Raziano;
the chairman of Boston Co., a money-management unit, George
Phillips; the head of its Balcor Co. real-estate unit, Steven
Silverstein; and Vice Chairman Joel Margolies, a former head
of the domestic-branch network.</p>
<p>Mr. Freiman, Shearson's trading and sales chief in the
early 1980s, had until late last year been head of Shearson's
capital markets division, before a management shuffle
announced by then-chairman Mr. Cohen, which gave the job to
Richard S. Fuld Jr. Since the shuffle, Mr. Freiman has been
chairman of Shearson's capital-commitment committees.</p>
<p>Mr. Freiman this year had also taken on responsibility for
the money-management businesses, but that chore has since
been assumed by Jonathan S. Linen. Mr. Linen is a former
American Express official who joined Shearson this week to
head the firm's brokerage and money-management businesses, as
part of a planned reorganization of Shearson into separate
brokerage and investment banking halves.</p>
<p>Howard L. Clark Jr., Shearson chairman since January, told
employees in an internal note that Mr. Freiman will remain a
Shearson adviser. Mr. Clark added that Mr. Freiman had
provided him with "invaluable assistance," and that his
"insights into an industry undergoing tremendous change have
helped to shape much of my own thinking about the Wall Street
of the 1990s."</p>
<p>Mr. Freiman, who generally kept a low profile during his
years at Shearson, declined to comment on his retirement
plans.</p>
