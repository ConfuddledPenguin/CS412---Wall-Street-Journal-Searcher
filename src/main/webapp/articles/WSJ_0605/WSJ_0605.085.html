	<p class="article-leader">SOUTHPORT, Conn. -- Sturm, Ruger & Co., which withdrew a
planned secondary offering of shares in March because its
stock price was too low, registered a similar offering with
its shares down a bit more.
   The manufacturer of firearms filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to make a secondary offering of 1,830,000
shares. Sturm Ruger has more than 6.7 million shares
outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Selling the shares are Chairman William B. Ruger Sr., one
million shares; Joanna Sturm, daughter of founder Alexander
Sturm, 750,000 shares; J. Thompson Ruger, who is Mr. Ruger's
son, 40,000 shares; and Claudia Ruger, wife of the younger
Mr. Ruger, 40,000 shares.</p>
<p>After the offering, the holding of the senior Mr. Ruger
will drop to 39% from 54% and that of Ms. Sturm to 4.6% from
nearly 16%. J. Thompson Ruger and his wife would hold about
0.8% each, compared with 1.4% each currently. William B.
Ruger Jr., who isn't selling shares in the offering, holds
nearly 3%.</p>
<p>The company granted the underwriters, led by Kidder,
Peabody & Co., an option on a total 274,500 shares to cover
over-allotments. Those shares would be sold by the senior Mr.
Ruger and Ms. Sturm.</p>
<p>In January, with its shares trading at around $28, Sturm
Ruger registered a secondary offering of 1,850,000 shares,
including one million shares offered by the senior Mr. Ruger.
The offering was to be underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.</p>
<p>In mid-February, the company reported that earnings for
1989 jumped 43% to $18.1 million, or $2.70 a share, as sales
grew 19% to $133.7 million. But on March 8, with the shares
at around $24.50, the company announced it had withdrawn the
offering. A spokesman said then that the share price was too
low and market conditions made such an offering inadvisable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sturm Ruger shares fell 50 cents to $23.50 in
national over-the-counter trading. In 1990, the company's
shares have traded as high as $29 and as low as $23.</p>
<p>Christian F. Baiz, a Kidder vice president of corporate
finance who is handling the underwriting, said Sturm Ruger
"simply wanted to bring the offering back fresh," having
recently named a new president, Gary W. French, and boosted
the quarterly dividend 20%, to 30 cents a share from 25
cents.</p>
<p>Separately, the company said its stock has been approved
for listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol
RGR. The exchange couldn't estimate when it would list the
shares.</p>
<p>For the first quarter, Sturm Ruger reported that net
income dipped 4.3% to $6.2 million, or 92 cents a share, as
sales grew 11% to $42.7 million.</p>
