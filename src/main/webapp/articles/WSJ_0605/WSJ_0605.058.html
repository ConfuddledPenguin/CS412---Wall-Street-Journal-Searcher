	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks surged to their
highest levels so far this year, with financial stocks
leading the advance.
   Traders say investors turned to the long-dormant financial
sector in hopes that an easing interest-rate environment will
fatten profits there.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Weak non-farm employment growth in May, evident in the
Labor Department's report on Friday, and a subsequent spike
in bond prices has encouraged hopes that interest rates will
decline from current levels.</p>
<p>"If rates are coming down then the financials are
certainly going to look more attractive," says Claudia Mott,
small-stock analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. She notes
that the stocks have performed miserably so far this year.</p>
<p>Insurance stocks performed particularly well, sending the
Nasdaq Insurance Index up 7.72, or more than 1.5%, to 514.86.
As of Friday's close, the index was down about 7% for the
year.</p>
<p>Mary-Alice Dennehy, OTC trader at insurance-stock
specialist Conning & Co., says there may be some
follow-through in insurance stocks today.</p>
<p>She notes that trading activity in St. Paul Cos., the OTC
market's largest insurance stock by market capitalization,
was strong both Friday and yesterday. The stock gained 3/4 to
59 1/2 on volume of about 594,000 shares, almost three times
its average daily volume.</p>
<p>Insurance companies earn higher margins with lower
interest rates, and their bond investments surge in value
when rates come down.</p>
<p>Among the OTC market's other big insurance stocks that
gained were Ohio Casualty, which rose 2 1/2 to 46 1/2, and
Safeco, which gained 1 5/8 to 39 1/4.</p>
<p>The buying helped push the Nasdaq Financial Index up 6.25,
or 1.6%, to 398.65. The Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes the
OTC market's largest nonfinancial stocks, gained only about
1%.</p>
<p>But the rotation into financial stocks allowed the OTC
market to extend its string of gains, with the Nasdaq
Composite Index adding 3.48, or 0.75%, to 465.61 -- its
highest level so far this year.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index, meanwhile,
hit a new all-time high, breaking above the 200 level with a
1.1% gain.</p>
<p>OTC advancers led decliners, 1,082 to 907. National Market
System volume moderated to 107,262,500 shares from Friday's
robust 120,669,600 shares.</p>
<p>Intel led the most-active list with a 1 point gain to 48
1/2. The company moved the expiration of its 1992 warrants up
to July 25. Each warrant entitles the holder to buy 1.5
shares of Intel for $45.</p>
<p>Also on the list, Oracle Systems added 5/8 to 20 1/2.
Adobe Systems, however, fell 1 1/2 to 33 1/4.</p>
<p>HEI added nearly 39%, up 1 5/32 to 4 1/8.</p>
<p>Columbia Hospital has agreed to buy the company for $4.50
a share.</p>
<p>Timberline Software has gained 2 to 12 1/2, after surging
16.7% on Friday. The company's executives tell Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report that a newsletter may be
responsible for the sudden interest in the stock. The
newsletter estimates that Timberline will earn 45 to 50 cents
a share in 1990. Timberline's chief financial officer called
the estimates "reasonable."</p>
<p>Prospect Financial lost 1 to 2, after falling 20% on
Friday. The company announced Friday that it expects to
record a charge in the fourth quarter ended in April, and may
not be in compliance with certain regulatory capital
requirements as of July 1.</p>
<p>Players International surged 1 5/8 to 8. The company began
test marketing 900-number telephone games based on the hit
television syndicated game shows "Jeopardy" and "Wheel of
Fortune."</p>
<p>Acclaim Entertainment slid 1 1/8 to 13 1/8. Profit-taking
has hit the stock after it surged to a 52-week high last
week. Acclaim rose to 16 last Thursday, largely on the
prospects for its video game based on the television show
"The Simpsons."</p>
