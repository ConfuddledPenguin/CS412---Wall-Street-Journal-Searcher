	<p class="article-leader">Doskocil Cos. of Hutchinson, Kan., a maker of pork
products and pizza toppings, said it will close its Marshall,
Mo., slaughtering operations, starting next Monday, until
pork industry conditions improve.
   The company, which is operating under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code, said that high hog prices and
reduced demand for pork products have hurt slaughtering
margins, and that it expects this imbalance to continue
through the summer. The temporary closing is expected to
affect about 500 employees, but won't include other
operations at the plant. Doskocil said it expects to reopen
the Missouri facility as soon "as the environment becomes
more favorable," probably within six months.</p>
