   Station Leaves CBS,
   Joins ABC Network</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">A switch to the ABC network from CBS by the top TV station
in Louisville, Ky., and ABC's decision to drop its longtime
affiliate there may leave the two rejected partners with no
choice but to join forces.
   After 40 years of affiliation with New York-based CBS
Inc.'s network, WHAS, the No. 1 station in Louisville, last
week terminated that contract and signed on instead with
rival ABC, a unit of New York-based Capital Cities/ABC Inc.
ABC, in turn, is dropping its longtime affiliate, WLKY, a
unit of St. Louis-based Pulitzer Publishing Co.'s
broadcasting subsidiary.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both CBS and WLKY said the switch was unexpected. "We were
really surprised and hadn't expected this," said Lyn Stoyer,
general manager of WLKY. Although he said his station has had
no formal talks with CBS, the station hopes it can strike an
affiliation agreement with that network. CBS said in a
statement that it, too, was surprised by the switch, and that
its plans for Louisville are under consideration.</p>
<p>Although stations rarely switch affiliations, the
last-place network is always at risk. Last-place CBS has lost
two affiliates in the past three years; Fairfield,
Conn.-based General Electric Co.'s NBC network lost some
affiliates a few years ago when it was in last place. The
three major broadcast networks each have about 200 affiliates
nationwide. Sydney, Australia-based News Corp.'s Fox
Broadcasting Co. network has about 127 affiliates.</p>
<p>George Newi, executive vice president of affiliate
relations for ABC, said the company decided to make the
switch because WHAS is the top news station in the market and
has a greater viewership that will allow his network to
"significantly increase our audience." WHAS is owned by the
Providence Journal Broadcasting Corp. In a statement, Neil
Kuvin, president of the station, said the "local competitive
and business environment in Louisville is so challenging and
volatile that we feel it essential to seize every opportunity
available to move forward." Affiliating with ABC "represents
the boldest and potentially most productive enhancement of
our station imaginable," he added.</p>
