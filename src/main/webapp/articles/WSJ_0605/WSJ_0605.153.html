	<p class="article-leader">In six weeks the first inner-city rail line to serve Los
Angeles in half a century is to open. The 22-mile trolley
between downtown and Long Beach is only an $871 million
start. Tunnels for a far more costly subway are being dug in
the central business district. And if California voters so
choose today, mass transit will lay tracks all over the state
for years to come.
   Two bond issues on the primary ballot aim to provide
locomotion. One, Proposition 108 from the governor and
Legislature, is tied to the fate of Proposition 111, a
measure to double the gasoline tax, hike truck fees 55% and
raise the limit on state spending. The other is Proposition
116, a more ambitious ($2 billion vs. $1 billion for Prop.
108) plan drawn up by fervent citizen-opponents of the auto
culture.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Californians are promiscuous in agreeing to bond issues,
so there's a good chance they'll be working on some sort of
railroad starting tomorrow. Whatever happens, this
megastate's choices are likely to affect national trends.</p>
<p>The rush to rail is still on in some American cities,
despite horrendous cost overruns of the newer systems and
continued grief with the older ones. All the lines are
government owned, and not one pays for itself. Congestion
relief is a hidden gain, but more of it per dollar can be had
from other transit schemes, such as greater use of buses,
jitneys and high-speed lanes for group vehicles. Yet the case
for rail systems is consistently overstated at the time they
are chosen over alternative modes, as the accompanying table
shows.</p>
<p>Still, even in California, rail romances politicians, the
press and much of the public. It seduced the San Francisco
area into a partly underground system 20 years ago, San Diego
a trolley line 10 years ago and Sacramento some street tracks
more recently. And motorist resistance is down -- 25%
population growth in the 1980s brought traffic delays real
and exaggerated. (Periodic planning-agency surveys of commute
times may reflect only drivers' worst memories.)</p>
<p>Prop. 108, to be supplemented by clones slated for the
1992 and 1994 ballots, is the first major concession to rail
by the state Republican Party. Gov. George Deukmejian is on
the hook for it, co-authoring a ballot argument that shouts
it "will pave the way for A NEW ERA OF PROSPERITY." He likely
did this to obtain bipartisan backing for Prop. 111, which is
basically for road money he badly wants and has failed to get
otherwise.</p>
<p>One might think, given the additional gallons of gas
bought for all the new autos crowding the state's highways,
that a static levy would suffice. But that doesn't seem to be
true. More fuel-efficient cars are one reason. Escalating
costs of maintenance as a road ages are another. Lots of
money goes to build sound barriers and relocate residents in
harm's way. Who knows where the billions in new federal
highway dollars have gone?</p>
<p>So the statehouse cabal asks for road relief with a rail
kicker. At least Prop. 108's projects -- as yet unspecified
-- would be situated mostly in high-congestion corridors.
Prop. 116 is more expansive, with more than half of its
proceeds designated for long-distance travel between the
state's metropolises. An Orange County monorail (not in
Disneyland) and bicycle-commuter lanes also are included.
Every major gubernatorial candidate has his or her name on
this one, and visionaries on the left tout it as a way to
convert the defense industry to peace in our time.</p>
<p>More-practical steps to mitigate traffic and the pollution
that goes with it are receiving increasing attention outside
the glare of politics. The Southern California-based Reason
Foundation recently brought together players from the ranks
of regulation, academia and business to discuss
incentive-based ideas, such as peak-hour pricing and
unsubsidized parking, that could alleviate congestion while
actually supplanting taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>It's debatable whether the road improvements of Prop. 111
would hasten more efficient traffic management. Michael
McGill, director of a powerhouse San Francisco civic group
that has emerged as a voice for market-oriented
transportation policies, favors Prop. 111 because it would
fund group-vehicle lanes, ramp meters and other half steps to
pricing, as well as better engineering. However, some
libertarians, along with the Sierra Club's LA chapter, argue
that forcing a supply crunch by not building more roads is
the best way toward alternatives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, near the congestion capital of downtown Los
Angeles sits a professor who disputes the whole notion that
traffic tie-ups are getting worse. Peter Gordon, director of
research at the University of Southern California's Planning
Institute for urban and regional affairs, maintains that
development sprawl and the flexibility of the personal car
allow individuals and employers to find their way around
jams. He points to local and national data showing shorter
commute times where suburb-to-suburb drives replaced
mass-transit trips to the central city. Artificial creation
of high-density corridors will retard this, he says.</p>
<p>The reality of metro transportation may matter less than
an impression of crisis as Californians decide. They truly
may be dying to hop a commuter special, or simply wish others
to "share the joys of rail," as the Los Angeles Times gushed
in one of its weekly editorials backing the ballot measures.</p>
<p>Whichever, with the only real action in the Democratic
primary this time, tax-and-spend items will be favored with a
sympathetic turn out.</p>
<p>If both rail items pass, $3 billion in bonds will be
authorized making California the engine that could pull along
the nation. On the other hand, the ballot triangle could work
against rail if voters choose the more moderate Prop. 108
over Prop. 116, but don't approve the Prop. 111 gas-tax
increase on which 108 depends. It all gets as complicated as
a schedule at Grand Central Terminal . . . except the polls
should close on time.</p>
