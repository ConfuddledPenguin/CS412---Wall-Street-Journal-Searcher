	<p class="article-leader">SHERWOOD CAPITAL Inc. agreed to indemnify J.T. Moran
Financial Corp. for problems arising after Moran's May 1988
purchase of several Sherwood retail offices, but the
indemnification was limited to activities of brokers during
their employment at Sherwood. An article in the April 26
edition said incorrectly that the indemnity covered
"difficulties resulting from brokers' practices after the
purchase."

Center, listed in a table accompanying the commodities story
in yesterday's edition, should have said to buy September
Eurodollar futures on June 25 and sell them on July 20. The
table misstated this trade recommendation.</p>
