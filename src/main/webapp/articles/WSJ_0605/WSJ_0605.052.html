	<p class="article-leader">It doesn't seem to be very big news that the negotiations
in the Bush-Congress budget summit are about to resume. Who
can blame the public or even the media for losing interest?
Farmers and Social Security recipients probably are the only
segments of the American electorate who have any clear idea
of what the federal budget does anymore. It's like a massive,
exploding star of gas and dust, which now measures $1.2
trillion in diameter. Maybe it's a threat to real life, but
how would you know? Many people still keep telescopes trained
on Washington because there is talk of raising their taxes to
close the distance between the budget's revenues and outlays
at the edge of the universe. The summit astronomers say
spending this money to shorten the measurements of the
deficit will produce a prosperous new civilization.
   Let's come down to Earth. Let's visit New Jersey.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unlike life with the federal government, the people of New
Jersey more or less know what is going on around them. One
might say the same about the people of New York, Connecticut
and Massachusetts. All these jurisdictions have one thing in
common with the federal government -- a big hole in their
budgets. And all are now in the process of attempting to
figure out what taxes to increase.</p>
<p>The accompanying table on per-capita spending over six
recent years by these and other states offers a clear idea of
why some states are struggling with their budgets. But
something more important is reflected in this data than the
fact that they've spent more than was prudent, and this is no
more evident than in the case of New Jersey.</p>
<p>New Jersey's new Democratic Governor, former Congressman
Jim Florio, has added a unique twist to the familiar
belt-tightening, tax-raising scenario. Governor Florio, an
unabashed liberal, has proposed to reorganize the way New
Jersey pays for public education. It is a complex formula,
which may be altered by the legislature, but its goal is to
take about $150 million of the state's share of school
budgets away from so-called "wealthy" school districts and
transfer it primarily to inner-city systems, such as Camden's
and Newark's.</p>
<p>The Governor expects the districts losing money to make up
some of the shortfall by raising their property taxes. Also,
Mr. Florio would transfer down to the local level
responsibility for the teachers' pension and Social Security
costs. Moreover, the Florio fiscal package includes, besides
some program cuts, increasing sales taxes and doubling the
top marginal income-tax rate (and using some of this to lower
some property taxes.)</p>
<p>Governor Florio has been attracting some national
attention as a liberal Robin Hood who's willing to transform
the Garden State into Sherwood Forest. If the state's economy
doesn't relocate to Pennsylvania or the citizens don't drive
the legislature's Democrats from office, his national star
will rise, at least in the Democratic firmament. But all this
is New Jersey's peculiar problem.</p>
<p>We're inclined to think that Mr. Florio has done American
politics in general a large favor. Unintentionally, his
proposal will force a lot of people to finally come to grips
with the cost and purpose of the public sector.</p>
<p>The plight of the school districts he plans to cut off
mirrors that of the federal budget and many other state
budgets. Local Jersey school systems say their hands are tied
by the fact that most of their budget outlays are "mandated"
or "untouchable" in the form of teachers' salaries and
benefits, and so most of the cuts have to come out of
vulnerable and "worthwhile" programs. This, of course, is the
familiar Washington "entitlement spending" chorus. It is, in
short, the bullet the system has refused to bite for about 20
years.</p>
<p>Now the choices, as with New Jersey's schools, are getting
pretty stark: Either take on the untouchables --
public-employee salary and benefit structures, the cost of
ever-increasing environmental "mandates" (for example,
asbestos abatement), and federal entitlements -- or watch
those things that are most valued slowly crumble.</p>
<p>The Jim Florios of the world, who are found at all levels
of government, assume that in the crunch voters will again
swallow new taxes to prop up the public sector. Our reading
is that this process has about run its course, and that in
places such as New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and
Washington, it's time to start searching for alternatives to
the "untouchable" status quo.</p>
