	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Joseph G. Fogg III, one of Wall Street's
best-known dealmakers, emerged as a major winner in the
latest management shuffle at Morgan Stanley Group Inc., the
big investment bank.
   Mr. Fogg, who saw his power clipped in 1985, although he
remained a powerful figure at Morgan Stanley, yesterday was
named head of the firm's investment banking division.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The head of the firm's world-wide corporate finance
department since 1985, Mr. Fogg, 43 years old, now will
oversee the firm's entire investment banking operation,
including corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions,
capital markets and real estate.</p>
<p>The appointment helps fill the gap left when Robert
Greenhill -- former vice chairman and head of investment
banking -- was recently slated by Morgan Stanley management
to be president.</p>
<p>But Mr. Fogg won't get to devour the entire loaf left by
Mr. Greenhill; as part of the reshuffling, Donald P. Brennan
was named to head a newly created merchant banking division,
which formerly had been folded into investment banking.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Brennan, the firm's five-year-old merchant
banking operations have grown to be a major driver in the
success of Morgan Stanley. The upshot of the moves: Morgan
Stanley's investment banking division effectively will be
split into two. (Mr. Greenhill's vice chairmanship will be
left vacant.)</p>
<p>The changes cap a management shift at one of Wall Street's
most successful investment banks. Three weeks ago, S. Parker
Gilbert, chairman for six years, said he would retire at year
end; Morgan Stanley's new chairman will be Richard Fisher,
who as president has played a major role in the firm's
strategic direction in recent years.</p>
<p>Both Messrs. Fogg and Brennan will report to Messrs.
Gilbert, Fisher and Greenhill.</p>
<p>By focusing on its international strengths and high-profit
areas such as merchant banking, mergers and acquisitions and
trading for its own account, Morgan Stanley has blossomed
into one of Wall Street's most profitable firms. Despite a
sharp downturn on Wall Street, Morgan Stanley's return on
equity currently stands at 27%, the highest among publicly
traded investment banks.</p>
<p>Analysts said splitting up Morgan Stanley's
investment-banking division makes sense.</p>
<p>"In merchant banking, you wind up becoming owner and
partial manager; in the investment banking business, you're
giving advice," says Alison Deans, an analyst for Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co. "That requires different types of
relationships."</p>
<p>For Mr. Fogg, the promotion is a homecoming of sorts. He
joined the firm nearly 20 years ago as one of the founding
members of Morgan Stanley's mergers and acquisitions
department. He headed that area for several years before
being shunted aside to head corporate finance, when Eric
Gleacher took over the top mergers post. Several months ago,
Mr. Gleacher left Morgan Stanley to form his own mergers and
acquisition firm.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Fogg said he was happy to "be able to
play more of a role back in M&A." But he says he never really
left it. "Even while at corporate finance, the business I've
done separate from the administrative work very heavily
focuses on M&A, particularly takeover defenses," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Fogg has represented Phillips Petroleum, CBS Inc.,
American Brands Inc., Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. and Avon
Products Inc., among others, in resisting unsolicited hostile
takeover attempts.</p>
<p>So far this year amid a merger slump, Morgan Stanley ranks
No. 2 behind CS First Boston Group in advising on takeover
deals. Through yesterday, Morgan Stanley advised on 32 deals
totaling $15 billion, for a 13% market share, according to
Securities Data Co. In the year-earlier period, Morgan
Stanley advised on 83 deals, valued at $19.6 billion, for a
9.4% market share.</p>
<p>Mr. Brennan's assignment reflects the increased importance
of merchant banking within the firm. Launched five years ago,
Morgan Stanley's merchant banking division, which invests
both the firm's and clients' money in deals, currently has
more than $20 billion in assets invested in about 20
companies. Morgan Stanley's investment represents about 15%
of the firm's equity capital.</p>
<p>Mr. Brennan, 49, said in an interview that merchant
banking, despite its potential pitfalls, will be even a
bigger focus within Morgan Stanley. "We will be increasing by
both the addition of investments to our portfolio as well as
an appreciation of existing" investments, he said.</p>
<p>Despite his new title, however, Mr. Brennan's
responsibilities largely will remain the same. As head of the
merchant banking operations, he will oversee activities such
as leveraged buy-outs, venture capital, the structuring of
high-yield junk bonds and the investment of equity capital
for the firm's own account.</p>
<p>Mr. Brennan also will remain chairman and president of
Morgan Stanley's $2.25 billion leverage buy-out fund, which
is currently about 50% invested.</p>
