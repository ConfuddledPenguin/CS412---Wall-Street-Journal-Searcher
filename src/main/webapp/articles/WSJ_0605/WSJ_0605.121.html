	<p class="article-leader">SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- Intel Corp. said it accelerated the
expiration of its 1992 warrants. The company said that any
warrants not exercised will expire at the close of business
on July 25.
   Under the company's warrant agreement, Intel can
accelerate the expiration whenever the stock price closes at
$42 or higher for any 20 trading days within a period of 30
trading days. Intel said it met those conditions yesterday.
Intel's stock closed at $48.50 a share, up $1, in national
over-the-counter trading yesterday.</p>

shares of Intel's common stock for $45 a warrant exercised.
The microcomputer maker currently has 3.5 million warrants
outstanding and expects to raise about $157 million.</p>
