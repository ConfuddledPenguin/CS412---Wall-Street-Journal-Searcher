	<p class="article-leader">We've poured a lot of ink on the activist judiciary these
past few years, but the time has come to say a few good
words. A brace of Supreme Court decisions yesterday showed
common sense prevailing over legal abstractions.
   The court upheld the constitutionality of Bible reading
clubs in public schools. It ruled that undercover police
agents do not need to warn suspects that they have a right to
a lawyer. And it held that when police with a search warrant
find incriminating evidence in plain sight they can seize it
even if the warrant didn't specifically mention it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is a commentary on past rulings that such self-evident
outcomes constitute progress, but you have to start
somewhere. And it is impressive that two of the rulings
commanded 8-1 majorities, while the third drew only two
dissents. Even some of the more liberal members of the court,
it seems, are starting to sense that the court risks losing
public support if it operates in some hypertechnical and
incomprehensible netherworld.</p>
<p>The rules of evidence, for example, bewilder almost any
onlooker. The fundamental problem is the exclusionary rule,
which makes the test of "evidence" not truth but the manner
in which it was seized. At the time this rule was propounded,
Justice Cardozo remarked on its essential silliness, "Because
the constable has blundered, the criminal shall go free." In
addition, the rule gave the Supreme Court the quixotic task
of finding the precise line police may not cross.</p>
<p>Terry Brice Horton, for example, was convicted of holding
up the treasurer of a San Jose coin club, stunning him with
an electrical device and taking cash and coins worth $30,000.
The victim said he recognized Horton's voice, and police got
a warrant to search his apartment. They failed to find the
loot, but did find two stun guns. Their warrant listed coins
but not the guns. Was it constitutional to tell the jury
about the stun guns? Yes, the court said, with Justices
Brennan and Marshall dissenting.</p>
<p>Lloyd Perkins was convicted of a murder he confessed,
while jailed on an unrelated charge, to an undercover
narcotics agent. The agent was introduced into his cell after
another inmate said Perkins had talked of the killing, and
the Miranda warning was not read until after the confession.
Was it constitutional to tell the jury what Perkins said to
the agent? Yes, the court ruled, with even Justice Brennan
joining the majority, leaving Justice Marshall to dissent
alone.</p>
<p>When it comes to religion in the public schools, the court
gets to count angels on pinheads. A moment of silence is an
unconstitutional prayer, it has divined. This set of rulings
has also bewildered onlookers and left much of the public
suspicious and resentful at what it saw as an attempt to
expel religion from public life. Indeed, public school
officials in Omaha might be forgiven for believing they were
obligated to refuse an application for a Christian Bible
study club as an extracurricular activity. But in 1984
Congress passed a law saying public high schools accepting
federal aid must not discriminate against groups based on
"the religious, political, philosophical or other content of
the speech at such meetings." Despite opposition from groups
such as the National School Boards Association, the Court
held that the law was within Congress's right, and meant what
it said. Justice Stevens dissented.</p>
<p>Surely there are other ways to keep students from being
coerced into prayer against their own beliefs, and
authorities other than the Supreme Court who can see the
right thing to do. There even are other ways to discipline
police excesses, especially now that segregationist Southern
sheriffs are no longer the rule. The Supreme Court invites
endless agony and erodes its own standing when it invokes the
Constitution to decide every detail of public life, and it's
comforting to see the court back away.</p>
