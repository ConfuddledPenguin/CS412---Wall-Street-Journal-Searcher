	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Corona Corp. said it agreed to make an improved
offer to acquire the joint owners of a new gold property in a
move to head off a takeover bid by Placer Dome Inc.
   Corona also said it raised its holdings in the two
concerns, Stikine Resources Ltd. and Prime Resources Group
Inc., both of Vancouver, British Columbia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Toronto-based Corona said it plans to merge the two
companies into a new subsidiary to be created through the
spinoff of Corona's gold assets. Corona will retain a 50.2%
interest in the new company, to be known as Corona Gold Corp.
Corona will remain as a holding company with interests in oil
and gas, industrial minerals, gold and financial services.</p>
<p>Corona said it advanced its restructuring plans by as much
as 18 months in response to a takeover bid for Stikine by
Placer. The Vancouver-based mining concern has offered 67.50
Canadian dollars (US$57.50) a share, valuing all of Stikine
at 229.5 million Canadian dollars.</p>
<p>The takeover battle is being fought over the Eskay Creek
gold deposit located in northwestern British Columbia. The
property's estimated reserves to date total about 4.8 million
ounces of gold or equivalent, valued at about US$1.71
billion.</p>
<p>Ned Goodman, Corona's chairman, said the company last week
bought more shares in Prime Resources, raising its stake to
45% from 21%. He said Corona obtained an option from
Stikine's principal holders that would boost its stake there
to 45%.</p>
<p>Corona will offer 6.5 of its shares and two shares of
Corona Gold for each Stikine share. Stikine holders will be
eligible to receive, for each Corona share, 0.38 share of
Corona Gold as part of a special dividend payment to be made
to Corona holders.</p>
<p>For each Prime share, holders will be entitled to receive
one Corona Gold share and one share of a successor company to
be known as Prime Equities Inc., which will comprise Prime
Resources' holdings in junior exploration concerns.</p>
