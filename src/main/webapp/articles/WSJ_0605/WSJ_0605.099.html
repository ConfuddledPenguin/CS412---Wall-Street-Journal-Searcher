	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices jumped to record levels on brisk
volume, with investors snapping up issues that are sensitive
to the monthlong drop in interest rates.
   Bond prices rose slightly in slow trading, adding fuel to
the stock-market rally. Helping nudge bonds higher were
falling commodities prices, especially oil and gold, which
signal lower inflation. The dollar was mixed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 34.22 points to
close at a record 2935.19 in active trading. Records also
were set by Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and, for the
first time in this rally, by the New York Stock Exchange
composite index. The S&P 500 closed at 367.40, up 4.24
points, and the Big Board composite closed at 200.21, up 2.18
points, breaking a record set Oct. 9. The Big Board index
measures all the more than 1,700 common stocks traded on the
exchange.</p>
<p>"Money managers are really feeling the pressure," said
James Solloway, chief economist at Argus Research. "As of
April, we saw some of the highest cash levels ever recorded
-- even higher than in 1982. With that much cash, managers
are very vulnerable to underperforming the market."</p>
<p>With each record high, money managers with cash on their
books become more nervous, traders said. Many institutional
stockholders are showing little inclination to sell, so money
managers are paying more for stocks they want to buy.</p>
<p>"A lot of these funds are supposed to be 100% invested,
but they have some cash," says Dudley Eppel, head of equity
trading at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "They are trying to
buy intelligently, but there are no sellers."</p>
<p>Mr. Eppel says money managers and asset allocators with
cash levels of 30% or more are "sitting there with sweaty
palms; they've turned ashen white."</p>
<p>Anxious investors looking for cheap stocks to buy turned
to many financial issues, which have lagged the market much
of this year. These stocks are trading at much lower
multiples of their per-share earnings than the overall
market, making them attractive to many investors, especially
mutual-fund managers with large stockpiles of uninvested
cash. American Express, for example, which closed $1.875
higher at $31.625 a share, is trading at 12.5 times estimated
1990 earnings. Currently, the comparable price-earnings ratio
of the industrial average is 14.</p>
<p>Other investors went after airline stocks, which also have
been trading at low price-earnings ratios and are benefiting
from the recent and continuing decline in oil prices. Their
buying spree pushed the Dow Jones Transportation Average
18.43 higher to close at 1207.85.</p>
<p>Edward Shopkorn, director of Mabon Nugent's equity
department says: "The market acts incredibly well. People
want to buy stocks; any further downward movement in interest
rates and the Dow Jones Industrial Average could hit 3000."</p>
<p>Ronald Sloan, executive vice president with Siebel Capital
Management Inc., said "the magnet of 3000 in the Dow
industrials is proving irresistible. It's like a flame and
the moths are drawn to it. I don't know what happens when we
get there, but obviously we are getting there."</p>
<p>However, Mr. Sloan worries that the stock market may be
overvalued relative to bonds. "Earnings have to build the
story from here, and I have been disappointed by earnings so
far," he says.</p>
<p>Investors are justified in expecting earnings growth in
certain sectors, said Mr. Solloway, "but the approach we're
seeing now is a bit indiscriminate."</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices climbed in active trading, with 175.5 million
shares changing hands on the Big Board. Advancing issues
outnumbered decliners, 1,105 to 477.</p>
<p>Bond prices rose slightly. The benchmark 30-year U.S.
Treasury bond gained more than an eighth of a point, or more
than $1.25 for each $1,000 of face amount, in slow trading.
The yield was 8.42%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed, rising against the yen partly
because of the strong stock market. In late afternoon New
York trading, the currency was at 1.6855 marks and 152.40
yen, compared with 1.6980 marks and 151.85 yen Friday.</p>
