	<p class="article-leader">SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- National Bancshares Corp. of Texas,
which continues to own three Texas banks after nine others
were declared insolvent, expects to seek protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in "the next day or
so," an attorney for the company said.
   The bank holding company said Friday it would file
immediately for bankruptcy-law protection; however, the
attorney said the company is still preparing papers for the
filing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Regulators declared the nine banks insolvent Friday and
sold their deposits and some assets to NCNB Texas National
Bank, a unit of NCNB Corp. The action left National
Bancshares with banks in Rockdale, Laredo and Eagle Pass.</p>
<p>The attorney said that National Bancshares has an
estimated $8 million to $9 million in non-bank assets, such
as real estate, and that the three banks' combined asset
value is estimated at $9 million to $12 million. However, he
said, the company's true asset value could be $5 million to
$20 million, depending on regulators' claims.</p>
<p>National Bancshares has estimated liabilities of $35
million to $40 million, the attorney said, including $25
million in convertible subordinated debentures and about $4.9
million in debt owed to Federal Asset Management Corp., a
company liquidating assets of the former Texas American
Bancshares Inc. of Fort Worth.</p>
