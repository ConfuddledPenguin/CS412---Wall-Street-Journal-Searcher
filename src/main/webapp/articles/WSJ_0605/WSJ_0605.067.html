	<p class="article-leader">CALGARY, Alberta -- Nova Corp. of Alberta said it agreed
to sell its valve-making subsidiary, Grove Italia S.p.A., to
an affiliate of one of Italy's biggest banks, for 121 billion
lire (US$96.8 million).
   The planned sale, to an investment group one-third owned
by Sanpaolo Finance S.p.A., a unit of Instituto Bancario San
Paolo di Torino, is expected to generate a net gain to Nova
of about 30 million Canadian dollars (US$25.6 million), or 10
cents a share. Nova had first-quarter net income of C$36
million, or 11 cents a share, on revenue of C$1.2 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale, the second announced by Nova in the past two
weeks, was greeted with enthusiasm by investors. In heavy
Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Nova closed at
C$9.125, up 50 cents on volume of about 6.8 million shares.</p>
<p>Nova announced late last month a pact to sell its rubber
operations to Bayer AG of West Germany, for C$1.25 billion.
Proceeds from both transactions will be used to reduce Nova's
long-term non-utility debt, which swelled with its C$1.3
billion purchase of Polysar Energy & Chemical Corp. in 1988.</p>
<p>Nova, which has interests in pipelines, oil and gas, and
petrochemicals, expects long-term debt from its unregulated
businesses to fall to C$450 million to C$500 million once the
transactions are completed, down from C$2.01 billion at March
31. The shrunken debt figure includes the impact of debt and
other liabilities to be assumed by Bayer.</p>
<p>"Nova would be very well capitalized" once the
transactions are completed, "and in a good position to grow
its polyethylene business" when prices for that commodity
rebound, said John McKimm, an analyst in Toronto with
Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd.</p>
<p>Grove Italia is one of four non-core units that Nova put
up for sale nearly a year ago. It estimated the value of the
group at C$500 million. A spokesman said Nova is continuing
to pursue the sale of the other units, though he didn't offer
details.</p>
