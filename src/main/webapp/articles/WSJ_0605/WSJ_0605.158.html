	<p class="article-leader">WEST CHESTER, Pa. -- Commodore International Ltd.
introduced a system that combines the capabilities of a
personal computer and compact disk player.
   The Commodore system, called the CDTV player, consists of
an Amiga personal computer -- without keyboard or monitor --
and a CD player. The system is hooked up to a television to
display video and text.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The CDTV Player makes the personal computer maker an early
entrant into a market that many computer companies consider
to be vast. The companies think that the home market for
computers is finally about to pick up with the introduction
of multimedia machines. For instance, they expect people to
buy encyclopedias on computer disks with video and audio
capabilities, or instructional videos that they can interact
with through the computer.</p>
<p>Commodore has also broken through a price barrier. Its
CDTV Player, whose shipment date wasn't specified, will cost
less than $1,000. Application disks will cost just $25 to
$60.</p>
<p>Still, the market for such systems is very young and will
take time to develop. The various companies involved haven't
agreed on what technological standards they will follow, and
it usually takes the market quite some time to sort out those
issues. It's also not clear how people will use these
systems, and whether they will want reference books or just
more games. In any case, it may take a couple of years for
companies to produce enough application disks to make these
systems attractive.</p>
<p>"Commodore has a history of producing great hardware, but
they don't have enough software available," said Greg
Drahuschak, a securities analyst at Wheat First/Butcher &
Singer. "That is where Commodore has always fallen short."</p>
