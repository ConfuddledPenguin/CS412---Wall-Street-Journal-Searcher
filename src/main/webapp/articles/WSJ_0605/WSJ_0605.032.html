	<p class="article-leader">In your May 14 editorials you describe our ABC News
broadcast, "Peter Jennings Reporting: From the Killing
Fields," as "the centerpiece of the controversy" surrounding
U.S. policy toward Cambodia. Everything I read suggests the
real centerpiece of the controversy is the policy itself, not
our reporting of it. That aside, a couple of corrections are
in order.
   We reported on the U.S. policy of support for a coalition
of forces fighting to regain control of Cambodia, a coalition
whose most powerful member is the genocidal communist Khmer
Rouge. At the heart of your criticism is the contention that
we oversimplified, turning a complicated dilemma into a
"melodrama" with good guys and bad guys. However, you excuse
us for what you see as our failings by condemning all TV
news. You say the fault lies in "the nature of television,
which to tell the news needs black hats and white hats." It
seems to me it is you who reduce something complicated to
something simple. For example, in the Cambodia you describe,
the Vietnamese wear the blackest hats because (a) they are
communist, (b) they are colonialist, and (c) they are
Vietnamese. We portrayed the Vietnamese role in Cambodia as
complicated: They got rid of the Khmer Rouge, but they also
installed a repressive communist regime.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>You made only two specific criticisms of our broadcast.
The first was that the interview with the State Department
official explaining U.S. policy did not look sufficiently
neutral. You manage to ignore what he actually said. You also
accuse us of neglecting to point out that President Nixon
ordered the invasion of Cambodia in 1970 to, in your words,
"keep the Khmer Rouge from prevailing." We don't make that
point because it's not true. Both former President Nixon and
Henry Kissinger have always said the purpose of the invasion
was to wipe out North Vietnamese supply lines and
sanctuaries. The Khmer Rouge were never mentioned. The facts
on this point are not in dispute.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in your letters column, Stephen J. Morris again
has the facts wrong. His letter was hard to make much sense
of, except for his continuing attack on Leslie Cockburn, the
program's producer. Ad hominem attacks are irrelevant to an
assessment of our reporting. The work should be judged on its
own merits. Nonetheless, in an attempt to substantiate his
accusations of political bias, he claims evidence of
"leftist" ideology can be found in "Ms. Cockburn's 1987 PBS
documentary `Murder on the Rio San Juan.'" Ms. Cockburn's
list of credits is extensive. It does not, however, contain
this particular work. Ms. Cockburn was not involved in any
way. It is hard to take anything Mr. Morris has to say
seriously when he has such trouble with the most basic facts.</p>
<p>Amid all the discussion of television technique and the
alleged politics of the program's producer, it is worth
noting that no one is criticizing the actual substance of our
reporting. It's also worth remembering that the basic issue
is the origin and effect of American policy in Cambodia.</p>

<p>(While Ms. Cockburn's book presents much of the same
material as the PBS documentary, it was an error to attribute
the program to her -- Ed.)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>In his May 1 letter, Mr. Jennings takes Mr. Morris to task
for referring to Leslie Cockburn as a "committed left
ideologue." In an obvious reference to McCarthyism, he says
this charge is "straight out of the '50s," and claims Mr.
Morris's charge "seems an anachronism."</p>
<p>This is typical of the media's inability to look at itself
with objectivity. Anybody familiar with Ms. Cockburn or her
work knows she is just what Mr. Morris said she is. Indeed,
Mr. Jennings never denies she is a committed leftist; he just
thinks it is obviously bad manners to point it out.</p>

<p>---</p>
<p>In his April 26 editorial-page piece, Mr. Morris states
that I "substantiate{d} the . . . bald assertion that the
Vietnamese have withdrawn from Cambodia" and contends in an
ad hominem remark that I have not read recent newspaper
reports that "elite Vietnamese troops" were reinjected there.</p>
<p>I decided to await the ABC broadcast before responding. In
it, I note that I said the Vietnamese forces had
"essentially" withdrawn, which I think was a reasonable
reflection of what I said on camera, including whatever may
have been cut from what I may have added about the fact that
some Vietnamese advisers, special forces, etc., may have
returned. Your writer's cheap shot that I was not aware of
news reports that they had done so I reject entirely, and
believe my word "essentially" recognized and accepted this
fact, and is more accurate than his suggestion that the major
Vietnamese presence that earlier existed was still in place.</p>
<p>I do not stand as an apologist for the Phnom Penh regime.
But I do insist that the most important objective of any
policy should be prevention of a return of the Khmer Rouge.
Early elections, under any structure, could best produce an
authority that would be representative of the Cambodian
people, supplanting the various self-appointees now
contesting for power. Let us not delay this process.</p>

<p>ABC did not detail the actual political alliances in
Cambodia, but chose instead to deceive viewers with cheap,
amateurish devices, such as close-ups of "culpable" parties,
followed by photographs of crying, malnourished children.</p>

<p>If my interpretation of recent articles and letters on the
Khmer Rouge is correct, I am confused. ABC speaking through
Mr. Jennings claims the desire to encourage U.S. action to
prevent a Khmer Rouge return to power. Well and good -- but
are not these the same people who (among others) so vocally
opposed U.S. action during the Vietnam War era to prevent the
original Khmer Rouge takeover?</p>
<p>My Air Force service in Thailand 1973-74 provides me with
such a recollection. Had the various networks and print media
opposed the Khmer Rouge as strongly in the '60s and '70s as
they now claim, perhaps we could have saved the lives of
several million Cambodians lost in the killing fields.</p>

<p>What ABC News left out of its documentary is why the once
decimated and demoralized Khmer Rouge are now "capable of
rolling over the PRK {Phnom Penh regime}," as Mr. Jennings
claims. The Khmer Rouge have been able to replenish their
forces with recruits among young Cambodians, who join because
of nationalism and a wish to fight the Vietnamese directing
the Hun Sen regime and to rid Cambodia of the one million
Vietnamese colonizing their homeland.</p>
<p>Although he admitted to Hun Sen's past as a Khmer Rouge
commander, Mr. Jennings failed to report two other facts: (1)
Under Pol Pot, Khmer Rouge commanders either killed as
ordered or were killed themselves, and Hun Sen and his
cohorts didn't flee to Vietnam until the Cambodian genocide
was well into its third year; (2) the rest of Hun Sen's
cohorts, who really wield the power in Phnom Penh, are also
unrepentant former Khmer Rouge leaders. Two Khmer Rouge
factions are fighting each other for control of Cambodia.
They include: Communist Party leader Heng Samrin, former
division commander under Pol Pot; Deputy Prime Minister Hor
Man Hong, reportedly former commander of a Khmer Rouge camp
where at least nine of Prince Sihanouk's officials perished
along with their families; and National Assembly leader Chea
Sim, who was a member of Pol Pot's National Assembly, and as
such helped determine the Khmer Rouge's genocide policy.</p>
<p>To impress visiting dignitaries such as Mr. Jennings, Hun
Sen takes them to Tuol Sleng, the infamous Khmer Rouge
torture center, where thousand of Cambodians were brutally
murdered. Unknown to Mr. Jennings, only 3.1 miles north, at
Tuol Kok, Hun Sen has his own private chamber of horrors,
much smaller in scale but just as deadly. There are 52 of
these centers in Phnom Penh alone, according to informants
inside the Hun Sen government. In his letter, Mr. Jennings
boasts of Hun Sen's improved human-rights record by saying
that only "430 people were detained for political reasons in
1988 . . . 430 too many, but an improvement over thousands."
Not so, according to recent defectors, high-ranking officials
from the Hun Sen regime and students -- sons and daughters of
communist officials in Cambodia]</p>
<p>Defector Vandy Kaon states: "During the past few years,
the leadership promoted the destruction of the country and
the killing of all the nationalists who dared to speak out
for the interest of the country." Mr. Kaon was a member of
the Phnom Penh controlled State Council, chairman of the
National Assembly's Legislative Commission and chairman of
the Cambodian-Vietnamese Friendship Association. His
statement was confirmed by two other high-ranking defectors,
one of whom was the PRK's former ambassador to Hanoi, Sieng
Saran. Recently, 67 Cambodians studying in East Germany
defected to the West and stated, "The Hun Sen-Heng Samrin
regime grossly violates human rights, forces Cambodians to
wage war against all nationalists, and imprisons and kills
any Cambodian who expresses sentiments for peace in
Cambodia."</p>
