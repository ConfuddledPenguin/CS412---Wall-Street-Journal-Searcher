	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Few people doubt that the Clean Air Act will
pass: It's just a matter of time, and of ironing out the
final provisions. For investors who hope to profit, the rub
is that environmental stocks already have been strong for
months.
   Nevertheless, some money managers and analysts believe
they have identified stocks that will benefit heavily from
the new law, and that haven't already been bid up to the
moon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Team Inc. looks good to R. Jerry Falkner, director of
research at Southeast Research Partners in Boca Raton, Fla.,
a unit of Dominick & Dominick. Listed on the American Stock
Exchange, the Alvin, Texas, company specializes in valve
maintenance and repair and monitoring of industrial plant
emissions. Those two specialties accounted for about 60% of
Team's fiscal 1990 revenue of $82 million and will be in keen
demand under the new law, Mr. Falkner says.</p>
<p>Despite these hot specialties, Team stock sells for 12
times the past year's per-share earnings, a bit below average
in today's market. Mr. Falkner cites the company's erratic
earnings history: It had some big losses back in the days
when it was mainly an oil-region company transporting
drilling muds.</p>
<p>Mr. Falkner thinks Team will earn at least $1.50 a share
in the fiscal year that started last week and runs through
next May. He figures that the market will reward Team with an
average price/earnings ratio (about 15) and that the stock is
on its way to 23 or 24. Yesterday it closed at 16 1/4.</p>
<p>Dresser Industries caught the eye of James H. Morgan,
president of Morgan Investments in Greenville, S.C., which
holds some of the shares. Best known as an oil-service
company, Dresser also has a big engineering and construction
arm. "Along with Fluor, it will be a big participant in
reconfiguring refineries to meet the new standards," Mr.
Morgan says.</p>
<p>Dresser, at 52 1/8 yesterday, already sells for more than
20 times trailing per-share earnings. But Mr. Morgan also has
a backdoor play that's cheaper. He recommends Norfolk
Southern, a railroad whose route structure, he says, puts it
in a position to carry heaps of the low-sulfur coal that
utilities increasingly will need. Norfolk Southern is at 41
5/8, less than 12 times the past 12 months' earnings.</p>
<p>"I've always looked at {the Clean Air Act} as a natural
gas bill," says Craig Drill, who runs Craig Drill Capital in
New York. "The thing that wins on every count is natural gas.
President Bush has wanted to help the energy industry. And
since {the oil spill at} Valdez, it's been just impossible."</p>
<p>The beneficiaries, Mr. Drill says, will be "the people who
have large reserves in natural gas {such as} Unocal, and the
people who are good at drilling for natural gas, such as
Parker Drilling." Unocal sells for about 22 times the past 12
months' earnings. Parker has been posting losses, though the
losses have been narrowing.</p>
<p>Ron Barone, analyst at Kidder Peabody, prefers Tenneco
because its gas pipeline "serves the energy-hungry Northeast"
and the Midwest, where high-sulfur coal has traditionally
been used. He expects brownouts in the Northeast, perhaps as
soon as this summer. Besides producing less pollution than
other sorts of power plants, natural-gas fired plants can be
built quickly, he says. He considers Tenneco attractively
priced at 15 times recent earnings, or 69 yesterday, and
thinks the company may soon sweeten its 4.3% dividend yield.</p>
<p>Richard Sweetnam, analyst at Kidder Peabody, says the
"biggest beneficiary" of the new law will be Air & Water
Technologies. Based in Branchburg, N.J., and listed on the
American exchange, the company makes air-pollution control
equipment, scrubbers and monitoring equipment.</p>
<p>When it comes to cleaning the air, says Mr. Sweetnam, Air
& Water Technologies is "standing right in the middle of the
tracks." Competitors such as General Electric, Asea Brown
Boveri and Air Products & Chemicals are big, diversified
companies, not pure plays, he says. Unfortunately, Air &
Water Technologies stock sells for about 38 times the
earnings Mr. Sweetnam expects for this fiscal year (ending in
October) and 20 times the earnings he expects for 1991. Not
much of a bargain there.</p>
<p>More down-to-earth are producers of low-sulfur coal.
Jordan Estra of Oppenheimer & Co. recommends both Nerco and
Ashland Coal, which sell for 13 and 15 times recent earnings,
respectively. Coal producers overexpanded in the energy boom
a decade ago, Mr. Estra says, and they have been hurting ever
since.</p>
<p>But a lot of excess capacity has been shut down. After
five years of falling prices (to a recent level of about $28
a ton), he expects a rebound to perhaps $30 or $31 a ton over
the next two years. Combine that with continued cost-cutting
and increased production, and patient investors could see a
nice profit increase, Mr. Estra says.</p>
