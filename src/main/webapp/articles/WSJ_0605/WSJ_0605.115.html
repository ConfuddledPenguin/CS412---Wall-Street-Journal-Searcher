	<p class="article-leader">Justin Industries Inc. sued a shareholder group led by
investors Perry H. Sutherland and Barry S. Rosenstein,
alleging the group violated securities laws, according to a
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Justin alleged that, among other things, the group
misrepresented itself by failing to disclose adequately in
its initial 13D filing in November its intentions to acquire
the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The complaint, filed in federal court in Fort Worth,
Texas, seeks to prevent the group, which owns about 11% of
Justin, from acquiring additional shares or from taking steps
to acquire control.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the group's $18.50-a-share proposal to
acquire Justin was rejected. The group said last month it is
still interested in acquiring Justin and is continuing to
meet with financing sources.</p>
<p>The group said in the SEC filing that the allegations are
without merit and that it plans to contest them.</p>
<p>Justin, based in Fort Worth, makes building materials and
leather goods.</p>
