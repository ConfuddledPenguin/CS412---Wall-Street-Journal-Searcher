	<p class="article-leader">MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. -- Warner-Lambert Co. said it filed an
application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to
market the experimental drug, THA, for treating Alzheimer's
disease.
   The pharmaceutical and health-care products company has
been testing the drug, also known as tacrine, in
collaboration with the National Institute of Aging for about
three years. If approved, the drug would be the first
treatment available for use against the degenerative brain
disorder.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Warner-Lambert said it sought FDA approval based on data
from two human studies -- one it funded and administered in
the U.S., and another was funded by a British company, Shire
Pharmaceuticals. The U.S. data is from an ongoing test of 150
patients; this study is expected to eventually enroll 300
people. In recent weeks, Warner-Lambert said the data it has
compiled suggests that about 40% of patients given the drug
showed some improvement.</p>
<p>Some independent tests of the drug indicate that, at best,
the drug may alleviate some of the disease's symptoms, but it
doesn't interfere with Alzheimer's underlying cause. The drug
is controversial. Several independent studies published of
late have produced conflicting findings.</p>
<p>Warner-Lambert had said earlier this year that it expected
to file its application with the FDA by July.</p>
