	<p class="article-leader">American Express Co. has quietly yanked a once highly
vaunted perk of its corporate credit card: free car-rental
insurance.
   With no formal announcement, American Express in April
stopped offering excess car-rental insurance to corporate
card holders who work at major companies. The move came only
a year and a half after American Express first offered the
benefit and, according to corporate traveler managers, pushed
it heavily.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"They throw in this perk and then suddenly take it away,"
says Rudolph Monteleone, president of the Association of
Corporate Travel Executives. "It's really upsetting."</p>
<p>What's more, while the change probably won't affect most
companies' liability, it could mean that business travelers
at big companies who use the corporate card for personal use
will now be responsible for car-rental damage -- unless they
buy insurance from car-rental agencies or their own insurance
policies cover such damage.</p>
<p>"There's no doubt this is going to hurt some people who
aren't careful," says Harold Seligman, president of
Management Alternatives Inc., a travel consultant in
Stamford, Conn. "People who think they're covered and turn
out to be wrong could be in for a huge surprise."</p>
<p>For its part, American Express insists that the insurance
was dropped because most corporations already have similar
coverage, either with their insurance companies or through
contracts with car-rental agencies. It also points out that
the benefit still applies to corporate users at companies
with fewer than 10 card holders and to all individual holders
of American Express green, gold and platinum cards. "The
insurance wasn't turning out to be important for the large
companies," says a spokeswoman for American Express.</p>
<p>But at least some competitors, including MasterCard, Visa
and Diners Club, say they will continue to offer the coverage
on their corporate cards. "We still find it's something
companies really like to have," says a spokesman for
MasterCard International.</p>
<p>At least for individuals, free car-rental insurance may be
among the most coveted credit-card perk. Car-rental companies
charge as much as $12 a day for the so-called
collision-damage waiver, which is essentially an agreement
that the renter won't be held responsible for any damage. By
using a credit card, most travelers find they no longer need
to buy the waiver.</p>
<p>When it first introduced the perk on its corporate card in
December 1988, American Express said it issued a news release
and ran several ads touting it. It has since heavily promoted
the benefit for members holding its green and gold cards, as
competition among credit-card companies has mounted.</p>
<p>But corporate card holders got word of the latest change
through a recent billing insert -- and only in the fourth
paragraph. Even American Express officials concede that not
all card holders are aware of the change. "You could easily
have people out there operating on the wrong assumption that
the coverage still applies," says Dolly Bee, a committee
chairwoman for the National Business Travelers Association.</p>
<p>And that could create a huge nightmare for some renters.
According to Ms. Bee, some companies allow employees to use
the corporate card for leisure trips -- or for trips that
combine business and leisure. But since companies don't pay
for damages that occur during vacations, employees must rely
on personal insurance for those trips. And only 40% of
personal automobile insurance covers car-rental damage.</p>
<p>While American Express officials concede that such a
scenario is possible, they defend their notification process.
"There's nothing that's foolproof," says Steve McCurdy, vice
president, marketing, for a unit of American Express.</p>
<p>Some travel-industry officials have speculated that
American Express dropped the insurance because it was too
costly. The company denies that the corporate-card program
has been too expensive, but concedes that it received far
more claims for car-rental damage from green-card holders
than anticipated. And in the process, many claims went unpaid
for months.</p>
<p>The delays, which American Express says it has been
working on, haven't affected most card holders -- they simply
refuse to pay for any car-rental damage until American
Express handles their claims. But the delays have caused a
furor in the car-rental industry, because car-rental
companies are stuck waiting to get paid.</p>
<p>One licensee for American International Rent A Car in
Florida says he stopped accepting American Express cards
because the credit-card company hasn't processed more than
$150,000 in claims. "It's just been a nightmare," says Ralph
Mizrani, chief executive officer of the licensee company.</p>
