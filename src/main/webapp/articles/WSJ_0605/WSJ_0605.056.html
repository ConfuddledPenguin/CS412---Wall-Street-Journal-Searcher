	<p class="article-leader">HAWTHORNE, Calif. -- Even as the Berlin Wall crumbled,
officials of Mattel Inc. rushed in to size up the Eastern
European market. But they were faced with a problem: How to
introduce Western-quality and Western-priced toys to a market
used to playthings that were generally simple and drab, but
cheap?
   The solution: Friendship Barbie, a basic blond version of
Mattel's long-running star that will be sold at cost, about
$6, to introduce millions of consumers to the joys of
U.S.-style shopping.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And where Barbie leads, can Hot Wheels and Mickey Mouse
toys be far behind? Mattel, given up for dead six years ago,
has steadily fought its way back by eschewing volume for net
income, coming up with endless variations of its longtime
staples, and pushing internationalization almost as a
religion.</p>
<p>As the toy industry consolidates and once-hot companies
vanish like spent hula hoops, Mattel has rebounded to become
one of the fastest-growing and most fashionable toy companies
on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Recently, the company drove home the point by reinstating
its dividend, announcing plans to pare debt and landing
toy-licensing rights to News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting Inc.'s
hit television cartoon show "The Simpsons."</p>
<p>Moreover, Mattel's stock is riding high on the New York
Stock Exchange and investors and analysts are looking for the
company to outperform the toy industry. Yesterday, in Big
Board composite trading Mattel closed at $25.875, up 62.5
cents; the stock's 52-week high is $26.375.</p>
<p>It was spindly-legged Barbie that helped haul Mattel back
to profitability, ringing up $590 million in world-wide sales
in 1989; the doll, along with other basic toy lines,
accounted for more than 75% of Mattel's consolidated sales.
Mattel posted net of $68.7 million on sales of $1.2 billion
in 1989.</p>
<p>John W. Amerman, Mattel's chairman, president and chief
executive officer, and his handpicked executives hawk Barbie
and her associates as if the toys were chewing gum or
scouring powder. That comes naturally to Mr. Amerman, a
veteran of Colgate-Palmolive Co. and Warner Lambert Co. who
became Mattel's chairman in 1987 after heading its
international operations for seven years.</p>
<p>"The toy business is a seat-of-the-pants business," says
Robert Sansone, who came in to head Mattel USA in 1987 after
24 years with General Foods Corp. "But most of what we're
doing here is from Marketing 101."</p>
<p>Mattel crash-landed in 1983, shot down by years of
unbridled diversification, sloppy management and a disastrous
plunge into electronic toys. Under former chairman Arthur
Spear, the company bailed out of electronics and
entertainment, but not before posting a staggering $394
million loss for fiscal 1984. The company continued to drift,
even as a flood of competitors' blockbusters took the market
by storm.</p>
<p>Mattel also has had its share of trendy hits. Its He-Man
and Masters of the Universe action figure and vehicle line,
built around a Saturday morning cartoon series the company
paid for, rocketed to $400 million in sales by 1985. But when
the show's costs edged upward and viewership drifted down,
Mattel didn't cut back supply, so the toys languished on
retailers' shelves and profits evaporated. "Inventory is a
killer in this business," Mr. Amerman says.</p>
<p>Chastened, Mattel has trotted out new versions of its
muscle-bound heroes and villains again. But now, Mattel won't
foot the bill for a new cartoon series scheduled for the
fall, and inventory will be kept lean. Mr. Amerman says
He-Man's domestic sales this year may double to about $20
million.</p>
<p>Mr. Amerman streamlined Mattel's management ranks but has
stepped up the company's spending on consumer research,
trying to balance basic marketing with the gut instincts that
toymakers traditionally used to identify promising products.</p>
<p>The company, which alienated some retailers before the
management shakeout with a hunger for volume at almost any
cost, now has senior managers working directly with important
customers. Mr. Amerman oversees the team handling the K mart
Corp. account, while Mr. Sansone works with top management of
Toys `R' Us Inc.</p>
<p>"They treat us as a partner, and that wasn't so much the
case years ago," says Michael Goldstein, vice chairman of
Toys `R' Us, adding: "They've made tremendous strides."</p>
<p>That relationship may stand Mattel in good stead as it
expands overseas. Toys `R' Us's ambitious plan to build a
170-store international chain by the end of 1992 could give
Mattel an extra boost, particularly in cracking difficult
markets such as Japan.</p>
<p>While Mattel is the largest and most profitable
international toymaker with more than $1 billion in
international sales last year, that doesn't prevent some
flops and missteps here and overseas.</p>
<p>Barbie, for example, doesn't stack up to Hot Wheels in
India because of the male-dominated culture. And the Japanese
craze for superfast battery-driven cars didn't translate to
the U.S., partly because Mattel and others misread the hobby
as an at-home toy.</p>
<p>Still, Mattel's overseas business is growing. Lindsey
Williams, president of Mattel International, says the Disney
line should get a boost with the 1992 opening of Euro
Disneyland, and Mattel's network of international offices is
burgeoning. New offices have opened in East Berlin and
Budapest, with another slated for Warsaw by year end.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams says the overseas markets are less volatile
than the U.S., with products slower to peak and slower to
decline. With the overseas appetite for basic products such
as miniature cars, infant toys and large dolls, he says,
Mattel intends "not to waste precious resources introducing
fads."</p>
<p>Mattel and other big toymakers may be better served by the
bread-and-butter approach, analysts agree. "The company may
be losing a little sex appeal by focusing on what it does
well," says John G. Taylor, an analyst with L.H. Alton & Co.
"But they've traded that in for stability and profitability,
and the possibility of sleeping better at night."</p>
<p>Mattel executives use the Simpsons licensing agreement to
argue that the company can retain some sizzle and yet limit
its risk. But because of Mattel's conservative bent, some
industry experts say, it seems less likely that the next
Cabbage Patch or Teddy Ruxpin will wear the Mattel logo.</p>
<p>That seems to be a trade-off Mattel is willing to make.
"You really have to be careful with the mega-hits," Mr.
Amerman says. David Leibowitz, an analyst with American
Securities, agrees. "A blockbuster is such a rare phenomenon,
you just can't plan for it," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Amerman doesn't rule out acquisitions, and says the
company will consider anything from board games to ride-on
toys and other lines. The company recently bought Corgi Toys
Inc. of Swansea, Wales, a maker of miniature die cast cars,
to bolster its position in Europe and supplement its core Hot
Wheels brand.</p>
<p>Mr. Amerman thinks his best seller can become
"billion-dollar Barbie" by 1995. And the Disney line may be
extended beyond infant and preschool toys. Eventually, "the
Disney brand may do in the range of what Barbie does," Mr.
Amerman says.</p>
<p>If not, there's always show business. Mr. Amerman, Mr.
Sansone and Mr. Williams recently brought down the house in
the company cafeteria with a soft-shoe tribute to Mattel
employees for last year's results. The "Toy Boys," decked out
in tuxedoes, glittery top hats and bow ties, sang and danced
up a storm to "There's No Business Like Toy Business" and
other ditties. The finale? A bonus of two weeks' pay to the
unsuspecting employees; that brought a standing ovation.</p>
