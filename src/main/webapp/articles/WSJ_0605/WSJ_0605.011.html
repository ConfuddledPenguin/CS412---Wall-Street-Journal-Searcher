$112.8 million loan to Mozambique to support structural
economic adjustments in the African country through the end
of 1992.
   The IMF said the loan will be disbursed in installments.
The first semiannual installment of $12.1 million will be

pool of resources called the "enhanced structural adjustment
facility," is for 10 years and carries an annual interest
