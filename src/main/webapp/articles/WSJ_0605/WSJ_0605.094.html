	<p class="article-leader">NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. -- Johnson & Johnson said it
established its Ortho Biotech unit as a separate operating
subsidiary.
   Ortho Biotech, a biotechnology company, has been a
division of Johnson & Johnson's Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp.
subsidiary. Among its products, Ortho Biotech markets a
monoclonal antibody treatment used to reverse acute kidney
transplant rejection. And through a Johnson & Johnson
affiliate it markets an anti-anemia drug for patients
experiencing anemia due to chronic renal failure.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ortho Biotech, based in Raritan, N.J., was set up in 1986.
A Johnson & Johnson spokesman said the company shifts
businesses to separate operations when they reach a
sufficient size to benefit from decentralization and
specialization.</p>
