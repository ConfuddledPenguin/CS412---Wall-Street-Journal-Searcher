	<p class="article-leader">Adweek magazine's purchase by Affiliated Publications,
which already owns a stable of entertainment and media
titles, could pose a threat to its hulking arch-competitor,
Advertising Age, industry executives say.
   Adweek's troubled parent, A/S/M Communications, agreed to
sell an 80% stake to Affiliated last week after months of
mounting financial woes. Terms weren't disclosed, but
industry executives say Affiliated paid about $17 million for
the stake, and took on about an equal amount of debt.
Affiliated is known as a savvy publisher whose properties
include the Boston Globe as well as Billboard, Backstage, and
the Hollywood Reporter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The purchase appears to put Adweek, which was well on its
way to becoming an also-ran, on far more even footing with
Advertising Age, one of several publications owned by Crain
Communications. The dueling ad trade magazines had been
fighting a particularly uneven battle in recent months. In an
overambitious expansion bid, A/S/M had loaded up on debt and
launched about half a dozen spinoffs of Adweek, stretching
the magazine's staff thin.</p>
<p>The mounting debt prompted cash flow problems so severe
that paychecks were delayed once, and ultimately several
publications were shut down. The 12-year-old flagship
publication, which has always lagged behind Ad Age in ad
pages, appeared to be falling even further behind.</p>
<p>The toll on the Adweek staff was evident in the magazine,
some industry executives contend. Adweek "has weakened"
editorially, asserts Martin Walker, a magazine analyst with
Periodical Studies Service. In recent weeks, the magazine saw
the resignation of its managing editor, Stewart Alter, and
the reshuffling of other staffers. But with Affiliated's cash
infusion and expertise, Adweek will be able to offer
"stronger competition for Ad Age," says Mr. Walker. "It will
prevent Ad Age from rolling over Adweek. It's a very good
move."</p>
<p>Some changes are already in the works. For starters,
Affiliated executives say, they will make Adweek a part of
the company's fledgling entertainment newswire service, which
offers newspapers stories from Billboard, Backstage and
others. Adweek also hopes to explore other electronic media,
says Kenneth Fadner, an A/S/M co-founder who remains the
company's president and chief executive officer. Adweek and
the other publications could also share some stories, the way
Ad Age occasionally picks up news items from sister
publications such as Automotive News.</p>
<p>Affiliated is known for its strong track record in
building circulation and in marketing, both of which should
help Adweek. Art Kingsbury, an Affiliated executive vice
president, adds that the firm's investment should help calm
distracted staffers and bolster fading morale. "There has
been a lot of uncertainty generated from the publicity of the
last six months," he says. "Hopefully this acquisition will
eliminate the uncertainty in terms of financial liability,
which will be good for the staff."</p>
<p>Both publications still face an ad environment that is
nothing short of miserable. Advertising pages at both
magazines have been falling since 1985. The media companies
and magazines who are the ad trades' bread and butter have
severely curtailed or even stopped advertising in the trades.
Their exit, prompted by restructurings, mergers and their own
soft ad revenue, leaves Adweek and Ad Age fighting for a
share of a shrinking pie.</p>
<p>Between 1985 and 1988, Advertising Age's ad pages slid
18%, according to Media Industry Newsletter. Adweek fared
even worse: Its ad pages dropped 30%. Last year, Adweek's
pages dropped 2%, to about 1,578, while Advertising Age's
pages dropped 8.8%, to about 2,477, according to Space
Analysis Systems. At its 1967 peak, Ad Age logged 4,200 ad
pages.</p>
<p>At Affiliated, not surprisingly, senior executives are
betting that the slump will soon end. "Our view is that this
slowdown may continue on for another year or so, but that it
will come back like all cycles come back," says Mr.
Kingsbury.</p>
<p>But some industry executives believe the slump is
permanent. Looking back at the trades' ad-filled pages of
years past, Lee Fredericks of Space Analysis says: "I
seriously doubt you'll ever see that again. There's more of a
mentality out there {among magazines} that you don't need to
advertise."</p>
<p>Rance Crain, Ad Age's editor-in-chief, diplomatically says
he welcomes the tougher competition, and says Ad Age may even
learn a thing or two from watching Adweek's new foray into
electronic media.</p>
<p>But he says that "neither of us will prosper unless the
entire advertising market is expanded," by wooing new
advertisers like computer software, travel or even consumer
products companies. "I don't think the way to make a buck in
the long range is to try to steal our business," he says. "In
the long range, the way to make a buck is to expand the pie."</p>

<p>Joe Isuzu to Get Boot
</p>
<p>American Isuzu Motors is giving Joe Isuzu, that
pathological liar, the boot. Honest.</p>
<p>The car maker said it will drop the humorous but sometimes
controversial pitchman this August, when it begins
introducing its 1991 model year cars.</p>
<p>The four-year-old campaign, created by Della Femina,
McNamee WCRS, Los Angeles, was made popular by actor David
Leisure. The campaign made the guy a star, and the
commercials helped land him a role on "Empty Nest," an NBC
sitcom.</p>
<p>The Joe Isuzu character sparked controversy among some
dealers who believed the ads undermined the credibility of
their salesmen in the showroom. Isuzu says it plans to focus
more on product specifications.</p>
<p>"The intent with Joe Isuzu was to gain name recognition in
the marketplace," says Leon Rosen, Isuzu's national marketing
manager. "It did that successfully."</p>

<p>PERRIER: Perrier Group, Greenwich, Conn., named Lord
Einstein O'Neill & Partners, New York, to handle the ad
account for its domestic bottled waters. Lord Einstein, which
already handles its Poland Spring brand, now picks up the
Arrowhead, Calistoga, Great Bear, Ozarka and Zephyrhills
brands. Perrier said total billings for the six brands are
$12 million. Hal Riney & Partners was the previous agency.
The Source Perrier unit also said it reassigned its Volvic
brand, an imported bottled water previously handled at Lord
Einstein, to Waring & LaRosa, New York. Perrier said it will
select an agency next month to handle media buying for all of
its brands.</p>

of Commerce and Under Secretary of the U.S. Travel and
Tourism Administration, was named chairman and chief
executive officer of Ayer's Western division, based in Los
Angeles. The office will be renamed Ayer Tuttle. . . . Arthur
Selkowitz was named executive vice president international at
D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles. He had been president of
Penchina, Selkowitz, an agency that DMB&B acquired last year.
