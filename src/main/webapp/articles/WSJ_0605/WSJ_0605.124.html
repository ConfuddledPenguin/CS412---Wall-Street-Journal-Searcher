	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge here ruled that the Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors violated the
constitutional rights of the area's large Hispanic population
when it drew voting boundaries in 1981.
   The suit was filed in 1988 by the U.S. Justice Department,
the American Civil Liberties Union and the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund. It alleged that the Board
of Supervisors illegally drew boundaries to separate the
county's Hispanic community in Central and East Los Angeles
into three separate supervisoral districts, thus diluting
Hispanic voting strength and maintaining an all-white
governing board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Federal Judge David Kenyon said in his ruling that the
County Board of Supervisors "knew that by adopting the 1981
redistricting plan, they were further impairing the ability
of Hispanics to gain representation on the board."</p>
<p>Officials of the Board of Supervisors were in meetings
yesterday afternoon, and couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>It wasn't clear what effect the ruling would have on the
voting boundaries. Judge Kenyon called a hearing for Thursday
to discuss the ruling with the parties involved.</p>
