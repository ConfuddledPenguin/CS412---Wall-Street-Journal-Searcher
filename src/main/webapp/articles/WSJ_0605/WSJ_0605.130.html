	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A stronger dollar and falling commodity prices
helped bond prices post modest gains yesterday.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/4 point
yesterday, or about $2.50 for a bond with a $1,000 face
amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, eased to 8.42%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Traders said the prices started to firm as the value of
the dollar rose against the yen. The dollar ended at 152.40
yen, up from 151.85 yen late Friday. Meanwhile, the Commodity
Research Bureau's futures index, which comprises 21
commodities, fell 1.25 points to 239.23. The CRB index
includes crude oil futures, which fell 36 cents to settle at
$17.14 in the July contract.</p>
<p>The dollar and commodities held center stage largely
because there is little else for players to focus on, the
analysts and traders say.</p>
<p>"It's brutally quiet," said one dealer. The unusually
light calendar of economic releases this week is largely
responsible for the dull trading, which analysts say should
continue for the near term.</p>
<p>"The dollar and lower commodity prices have helped out,
but we're pretty much biding time until next week's data,"
says Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.</p>
<p>Lynn Reaser, a vice president and senior economist at
First Interstate Bank Ltd. agrees: "The market is digesting
Friday's very large gains and waiting for more news on
economic growth and inflation." And "the fact that the market
has been able to retain the gains from Friday is positive,"
said Ms. Reaser. "There's been very little profit taking."</p>
<p>Traders said that investors aren't cashing in on the
profits they reaped Friday when bond prices surged because
they expect prices to rise further when key reports on last
month's retail sales and producer and consumer prices are
issued next week.</p>
<p>On Friday, bond prices rose as much as 1 1/2 points in
response to the May employment report, which suggested a more
sluggish economy than many had forecast.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury bonds ended modestly higher in quiet trading. The
benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 103 15/32 to yield
8.42% compared with 103 8/32 to yield 8.44% on Friday.</p>
<p>The latest 10-year notes ended at 102 26/32 to yield 8.43%
compared with 102 22/32 to yield 8.45%.</p>
<p>The government sold a total of $17.25 billion of
three-month and six-month Treasury bills yesterday at its
regular weekly auction.</p>
<p>The average discount rate on the three-month bills was
7.69% while the average rate on six-month bills was 7.62%.
The rates were lower than at last week's auction when they
were 7.80% and 7.74%, respectively.</p>
<p>The average rate on three-month bills was the lowest since
the average of 7.67% at the auction on May 14, 1990. The rate
on six-month bills was the lowest since the average of 7.58%
at the auction on Jan. 22, 1990.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>

<p>Both issues are dated June 7. The 13-week bills mature
Sept. 6, and the 26-week bills mature Dec. 6.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>The junk bonds of Trump Taj Funding and two other casinos
run by developer Donald Trump plunged yesterday on reports
that the developer is in the throes of a cash squeeze. The
report, which was in yesterday's Wall Street Journal, drove
Trump bonds down as much as 8 points.</p>
<p>However, Trump casino bonds weren't the only junk bonds to
take a beating in yesterday's bond market.</p>
<p>Although most junk bonds, or speculative-grade bonds with
low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended
modestly higher yesterday, the bonds of Charter Medical Corp.
sank.</p>
<p>Charter's bonds weakened on news that the psychiatric-care
company will close about 25 outpatient counseling centers and
idle about 600 employees across the country. Bids for Charter
Medical's 14% senior subordinated debentures, due 2000, are
off about two points at 52.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the junk bonds of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc. gained on a report that British publisher Robert Maxwell
is still interested in acquiring the U.S. publishing giant.</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell, chairman and chief executive officer of
Maxwell Communication Corp., declined to comment on whether
he has been in talks with Harcourt regarding a possible
acquisition.</p>
<p>Harcourt's 13% senior notes, due in 1997, advanced 1/2
point to close at 95 3/4, while the firm's 13.75% senior
subordinated debentures, maturing in 1999, also climbed 1/2
point to 81.</p>
<p>The giant publisher's senior securities have tended to
advance whenever there is talk about a possible acquisition
of the company.</p>
<p>Ben Bendre, a high-yield analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.,
attributes the run-up to the expectation that the 13% senior
notes would be bought back at par with proceeds from an asset
sale.</p>
<p>According to covenants governing the 13% notes, proceeds
from an asset sale must be used to pay off bank debt first
and then for the buy-back of the company's senior bonds.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities were little changed after light
trading.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9% securities for
June delivery ended at 97 1/32, unchanged; 9.5% issues were
at 99 11/32, down 1/32; 10% issues were at 101 3/4,
unchanged, and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5%
securities stood at 98 3/4, up 1/32.</p>
<p>In derivative markets, the Federal National Mortgage
Association issued two real estate mortgage investment
conduits totaling $500 million and Freddie Mac issued one
Remic for $300 million.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae issued a $300 million issue backed by its 10.5%
mortgage securities through Kidder, Peabody & Co. and a $200
million issue backed by 9.5% 15-year securities through
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac issued the $300 million issue backed by 10%
securities through Morgan Stanley & Co.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Tax-exempt bonds ended unchanged to 1/4 point higher in
quiet trading.</p>
<p>Bond dealers said market participants are bracing for New
York State's annual spring borrowing, expected to consist of
$4.1 billion tax and revenue-anticipation notes via
negotiation on Thursday.</p>
<p>The 1990 spring borrowing will be one of the state's
largest.</p>
<p>Because of New York's recurring fiscal problems, market
participants expect that the state's short-term tax and
revenue-anticipation notes may receive a MIG-2 rating from
Moody's Investors Service Inc. -- one notch below the MIG-1
rating last year's spring borrowing received.</p>
<p>They also expect Moody's to downgrade the state's
long-term debt rating, now at single-A-1. In addition, an
SP-1 rating -- below last year's level of SP-1-Plus -- is
expected from Standard & Poor's Corp., several traders say.
Both agencies have the notes under review.</p>
<p>With a rating cut in mind, traders said yields on the New
York bonds are expected to come in between 6.20% and 6.35%,
although some estimates are as high as 6.50%. Underwriting
officials declined to comment on price talk.</p>
<p>Late Friday, New York State Comptroller Edward Regan
announced that he had certified the state's $49.8 billion
budget, clearing the way for the spring borrowing to take
place.</p>
<p>Despite the possibility of a credit rating cut, traders
reported strong retail investor interest in the notes because
of the expected higher yield.</p>
<p>"It's been sort of a blessing that it's taken so long" to
adopt the budget, one trader says. "We've got orders lined
up, a stack of them."</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>British government bonds ended higher in quiet trading,
with activity muted due to the Whit Monday holiday that was
observed in most European countries.</p>
<p>Traders said that British bonds, called gilts, firmed
during early trading in sympathy with Friday's rally in the
U.S. Treasury market. The British market then dipped on an
upward revision of U.K. retail sales data and drifted through
the remainder of the session.</p>
<p>Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% bond due 2003/2007 rose 15/32
to 101 3/8 to yield 11.54% while the 12% notes due in 1995
rose 5/32 to 99 14/32 to yield 12.17%.</p>
<p>Friday's bond rally in the U.S. also bolstered Japanese
bonds yesterday. The price of the benchmark 10-year Japanese
government bond ended at 88.33 to yield 6.90%. (The yield is
calculated in local terms, but would be lower if calculated
by the semiannual compound measure that is used in the U.S.)</p>
<p>West German financial markets were closed.</p>
