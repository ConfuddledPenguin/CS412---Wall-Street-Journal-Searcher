	<h3>Technology: Noyce Death Casts Shadow Over Group Designed to Boost Semiconductor Firms</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">The death of Robert N. Noyce casts a shadow over Sematech,
the semiconductor group that Mr. Noyce, an advocate for U.S.
intervention in the semiconductor war with Japan, took over
two years ago.
   Mr. Noyce, co-founder of both Fairchild Semiconductor and
Intel Corp. and co-inventor of the integrated circuit, had
campaigned for "a new culture" in response to Japanese
semiconductor competition. For Mr. Noyce, that meant
increased cooperation among U.S. companies and greater
involvement by government, a position at odds with the Bush
administration.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Industry observers said Mr. Noyce's death weakens such
lobbying efforts, which had found few supporters outside the
industry. "He carried an image that will be hard to replace,
no question about that," said Richard Skinner, president of
Integrated Circuit Engineering Corp., a consulting firm in
Arizona. "But as for impact, there won't be any -- nobody was
listening to him."</p>
<p>Mr. Noyce conducted his campaign as chairman of Sematech,
an Austin, Texas, group of 14 technology companies including
International Business Machines Corp., American Telephone &
Telegraph Corp., Texas Instruments Inc. and Motorola Inc. The
research group, whose goal is to bring U.S. semiconductor
manufacturing methods into parity with the Japanese by 1992,
receives half of its $200 million annual budget from the
federal government.</p>
<p>But the unprecedented private-public partnership provoked
criticism from companies that claimed Sematech was competing
unfairly against nonmembers, as well as from conservative
politicians. At times, it appeared that Sematech's strongest
claim to legitimacy was Mr. Noyce himself.</p>
<p>More recently, Sematech officials say, Mr. Noyce, who took
the top job when the search committee he was heading couldn't
find a suitable chief executive, believed that the group had
weathered political challenges and could survive without him.
The research facility had been built, the plant had produced
its first wafers, and the Bush administration had reversed
its early opposition to continued funding of the effort.
Indeed, say Sematech officials, Mr. Bush has hailed the
effort as a leading example of U.S. competitiveness.</p>
<p>At the April board meeting, Mr. Noyce requested that a
search committee be formed to find a new chief executive and
indicated that he would like to retire in the fall. A few
weeks later, he had a complete physical and received a clean
bill of health. He died Sunday of a heart attack at age 62.</p>
<p>Charles Sporck, chairman of the Sematech board and
president and chief executive of National Semiconductor Inc.,
declined requests for interviews but issued a statement
acknowledging that a new chief executive must be found
"expeditiously." Company officials, meanwhile, say the office
of chief executive, which also included Turner Hasty, chief
operating officer, and Peter H. Mills, chief administrative
officer, continues to run the group.</p>
<p>"Bob Noyce was a master team builder and a master
consensus builder," said Mr. Mills, contending that Sematech
can function indefinitely until a new chief executive is
named.</p>
