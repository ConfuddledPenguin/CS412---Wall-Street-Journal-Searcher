	<p class="article-leader">The stockbrokers at J.T. Moran & Co.'s Garden City, N.Y.,
office had only to consult their scripts, taped to desks and
walls. The scripts supplied "power phrases," to be used on
people reached through cold calling. "This is going to come
back to us in a big way," was one such line. Another was,
"The perceived value is nowhere near the intrinsic value."
And, "We're gonna hit a home run with this situation."
   If a prospective client hesitated, the broker might get
pushy. "I understand you want to talk with your wife," he
might ask, "but does she go to work with you every day? Does
she make the decisions?"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>More hesitation could elicit a tougher follow-up: "C'mon,
drop your pompons and get into the game with the varsity."
Or, "Take your backbone out of the closet." Or "Put your wife
on the phone; she's more of a man than you are."</p>
<p>High-pressure sales tactics like this are plenty familiar
to Edward Modzelewski. Last month, the 50-year-old physical
therapist got a cold call from a stockbroker who asked him
whether he wanted some investment ideas. Mr. Modzelewski was
horrified. The caller, he says, was one of the same group of
brokers that he contends bilked him "through a pattern of
unscrupulous conduct and illegal stock-price manipulation."</p>
<p>After filing a $2.9 million claim with the National
Association of Securities Dealers in New York against several
of them and the firms where they worked -- First Jersey
Securities, Sherwood Capital Inc. and J.T. Moran -- Mr.
Modzelewski assumed he would never hear from them again.</p>
<p>Mr. Modzelewski and thousands of other investors
nationwide may be victims of what some prosecutors call "the
cockroach factor." Like roaches scurrying from the light,
brokers often flee firms accused of fraud to escape the glare
of government scrutiny -- then set up shop with a new name.</p>
<p>The Moran case seems a prime example. The scripts used by
some of the Moran brokers in Garden City -- not all of them,
by any means -- came straight from the now-defunct First
Jersey Securities, where a number of the Moran brokers once
worked.</p>
<p>Of course, a broker with a blemished compliance record or
experience at a scandal-ridden firm is not necessarily
unscrupulous. Nonetheless, some former Moran clients say they
wish that they had known about their brokers' questionable
pasts and especially about the connection between Moran's
Garden City branch and First Jersey, the target of a highly
publicized investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission and grand-jury probes in New York and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Although recent government crackdowns on illicit
activities in the over-the-counter and penny-stock markets
have netted many swindlers, a lot more slip through the
government's grasp. That is partly because of the huge number
of brokers state and federal regulators must watch. But it's
also because of the way the government prosecutes securities
firms.</p>
<p>"It's a common choice in law enforcement -- whether you go
after the big guys or the small guys, whether you pursue the
street sellers of narcotics or the Colombian cartel," says
Charles Carberry, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan U.S.
Attorney's office. "And typically, because of resources, you
pursue the head of the operation -- in these cases, the guy
who's manipulating the stock and not the guys on the phones
selling it."</p>
<p>As a result, says Richard Berry, the head of enforcement
for the New Jersey Bureau of Securities, "there is a
subculture that will continue on and on after the key players
are put in jail." The small fry, he says, "find a new home,
another firm that will take them in for dirt cheap and that
has an appearance of legitimacy. . . . Investors never know
the difference."</p>
<p>J.T. Moran, one of the firms sued by Mr. Modzelewski, took
in some wayward brokers, although many of its 18 branches
remain untouched by controversy.</p>
<p>Whether John T. Moran, who founded the firm in 1986, knew
he was buying into the "cockroach factor" isn't clear. He
declines to be interviewed. However, his lawyer, Martin
Karlinsky of New York, says: "Anybody who knew about First
Jersey would have to say they were aware there had been
problems, but those were First Jersey problems, encouraged by
First Jersey." Regarding the allegations against Moran, Mr.
Karlinsky says that "nothing has been proved" -- or will be
proved.</p>
<p>In January, Moran, which specialized in making markets in
low-priced stocks, filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. In three years,
Moran had built up a sales force of nearly 1,000 brokers --
some of whom had checkered employment histories -- and became
one of the nation's 20 largest brokerage houses.</p>
<p>In recent months, Moran's problems have attracted the
attention of investigators from the NASD, the SEC, the
Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
several state agencies. The investigators have been looking
into allegations of stock manipulation and fraudulent sales
practices at Moran as well as the financial ties between
Moran and the companies whose stock its brokers pushed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some of Moran's nearly 90,000 customers have
filed claims against it with the NASD and in the federal
bankruptcy court in White Plains, N.Y. They contend that they
were fleeced by Moran brokers who hyped stocks in small
companies with few assets and feeble prospects. Many of these
claims involve Moran brokers who once worked for First
Jersey.</p>
<p>Several suits against Moran cite First Jersey veterans at
the Garden City branch, Moran's largest retail operation.
What happened there, say former brokers not involved in the
lawsuits, is that Moran inherited a legacy of high-pressure
sales techniques from First Jersey brokers, who then became
managers at Moran.</p>
<p>Mr. Karlinsky says that in the spring of 1989, Mr. Moran
assigned to the Garden City office a "special officer to
assure compliance with rules and laws. This was the only
branch where Moran did this. It was the only branch that
needed it."</p>
<p>There is ample evidence that the brokers who came to Moran
from First Jersey did invest clients' money recklessly. Five
former Moran brokers say in interviews that many of their
clients had losses of 50% to 80% of their investments and
that few walked away with a profit.</p>
<p>Michael Magioncalda, a Long Island bagel-shop operator
with a $144,000 claim against the firm and two brokers, has
tape recordings on which one of the brokers guarantees that
Mr. Magioncalda would never lose a cent if he purchased stock
in Moran's parent firm at $1,000 per unit -- a violation of
SEC and NASD regulations. "Even if it went below $1,000, both
he {the broker} and J.T. Moran would guarantee that I would
suffer no losses," says Mr. Magioncalda in his claim, which,
along with transcripts of the tapes, is filed at the NASD in
New York City.</p>
<p>The evolution from First Jersey to Moran went like this:
In the spring of 1974, the SEC accused Mayflower Securities
Co. of stock manipulation and fraud. Later that year,
Mayflower's then-26-year-old president, Robert Brennan, and
the SEC negotiated a settlement that included a 15-day
suspension of Mayflower's trading. In November 1974, a few
days before the suspension was to begin, Mayflower clients
got a letter saying their accounts had been purchased by
First Jersey. After changing little more than the name, Mr.
Brennan and Mayflower's top brokers had set up shop in
Mayflower's New York office.</p>
<p>In November 1984, after a cat-and-mouse game with the SEC
that had already gone on for years, First Jersey agreed to
settle SEC charges alleging stock fraud. Subsequently, a
number of First Jersey managers were indicted. The
indictments out of the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office
resulted in two acquittals, one reversed conviction and a
guilty plea to one misdemeanor count. Cases in which the U.S.
Attorney in Newark, N.J., alleged money-laundering against
three officials and two former brokers have ended so far in
three guilty pleas and one conviction. Some charges are still
pending.</p>
<p>In February 1987, after an avalanche of bad publicity, Mr.
Brennan sold First Jersey's 33 branches, which by then had
1,100 brokers, to Sherwood Capital. "We were tainted,
destroyed, damaged goods," a former First Jersey broker says.
"We desperately needed a new name, a new face. It was all
very smooth."</p>
<p>Sherwood, an over-the-counter market maker with only
institutional clients, wanted to develop a retail force, says
a lawyer familiar with the transaction. "This was a chance to
be a gigantic presence on the Street . . . a firm with
tremendous power to generate money but without the albatross
of a bad name."</p>
<p>But the retail business posted huge losses, and, in the
spring of 1988, Sherwood decided to sell it. Two former First
Jersey brokers who went to work at Sherwood blame the
problems partly on high-pressure sales techniques that led to
sales cancellations and disgruntled customers.</p>
<p>In May 1988, Moran announced it had acquired five Sherwood
offices, in Chicago, Hartford, Dallas, San Diego and
Huntington, N.Y. Moran agreed to pay $1.8 million plus a
warrant to purchase 400,000 common shares of Moran's parent,
Manhattan-based J.T. Moran Financial Corp. Moran acquired
about 250 brokers reputed to be Sherwood's top producers,
including 150 or so at Huntington.</p>
<p>When Moran moved the Huntington office to Garden City last
year, about half the sales staff had once worked at First
Jersey. Gregory Hasho, First Jersey's top producer and later
manager of Sherwood's Huntington branch, stayed on as Moran's
branch manager.</p>
<p>And when Moran filed for Chapter 11 in January, the
31-year-old Mr. Hasho and his troops landed at Vanderbilt
Securities, a small New York firm specializing in
over-the-counter stocks. As many as 150 brokers, including
some First Jersey alumni, are operating in Hauppauge, N.Y.,
in the old headquarters of Investors Center, a firm that
collapsed last year under SEC pressure. Mr. Modzelewski says
he was called from that office last month.</p>
<p>Mr. Karlinsky, Mr. Moran's lawyer, says Moran checked the
brokers' compliance records and found no problems. He adds
that Sherwood agreed to indemnify Moran for any difficulties
resulting from brokers' practices after the purchase. "The
truth of the matter is we have been dragged into these
things," he says.</p>
<p>But it wasn't just the First Jersey connection that Moran
was "dragged into." The troubled pasts of other acquisitions
caused problems. Some newly added brokers led investigators
to Moran's doorstep; others hobbled it because regulators
ruled out new branches.</p>
<p>Moran's 1989 proxy statement lists Adnan Durrani as a
managing director and board member as well as a former senior
vice president at several big Wall Street firms, including
Shearson Lehman. But according to his lengthy NASD record of
compliance problems, the 30-year-old Mr. Durrani, who joined
Moran's Manhattan office in 1987, had been asked to resign
from Oppenheimer & Co. in 1984 for allegedly unauthorized
transfers of customer accounts from his previous job at E.F.
Hutton Co.; fired from Shearson in 1986 for unauthorized
trades and other problems; and "permitted to resign" from
Philips, Appel & Walden Inc. in August 1987 after a New York
Stock Exchange investigator apparently tipped the firm's top
officers to his problems at Shearson.</p>
<p>Mr. Durrani couldn't be reached for comment. Speaking of
him, Mr. Karlinsky says: "His compliance history caused one
to stop and think about it. But we didn't think that,
standing alone, it was a reason not to bring him into J.T.
Moran. {Mr. Moran} had high regard for him and thought he was
an honest and forthright person; he gave reasons for his
compliance problems and he {Mr. Moran} believed him." Mr.
Karlinsky adds that no customers have complained about Mr.
Durrani's work at Moran.</p>
<p>Last year Florida refused to allow Moran to open three new
branches. At Moran's Lauderhill, Fla., office, explains Don
Saxon, the director of Florida's Division of Securities,
"There were violations of our antifraud provisions, failure
to disclose a relationship between Moran and one of its
issues, among other things."</p>
<p>Moran's Lauderhill office was staffed largely by brokers
who had left such firms as Greentree Securities and RLR
Securities Inc. In early 1988, Florida regulators barred
Greentree from the securities business for "having engaged in
dishonest or unethical practices," according to NASD records.
Says Mr. Karlinsky, "I'm aware of compliance problems with
RLR Securities. Moran screened out the brokers who caused the
problems."</p>
<p>What former Moran brokers call the "legacy of First
Jersey" can best be described as boiler-room tactics: brokers
phoning unwary investors and urging, cajoling, even harassing
them into buying highly speculative securities.</p>
<p>Deception pervaded the system, the brokers say. Even the
sound of a stock ticker that some clients heard in the
background was a sham; brokers were simply pounding on
staplers. Over and over, brokers told clients, "Give me 1% of
your trust, and I'll earn the other 99%."</p>
<p>A common practice passed on from First Jersey was the
"three-call" system for landing new accounts. The first, the
"prospecting call," made initial contact with a potential
customer. The "qualifying call" was to find out how much
money the investor had and to titillate him or her with what
the broker called a hot prospect "coming up soon." In the
"sell call," the broker hyped a stock as a no-lose
proposition -- and never let the client hang up without a
commitment to buy, brokers say.</p>
<p>In a $722,845 claim against First Jersey, Sherwood and
Moran on file with the NASD in New York, Mark Everett, who
co-owns a graphic-design firm on Long Island, says that "if
the client hung up, the account executive would call back
soon thereafter with another suggestion. . . . If all else
failed, account executives would buy stock for the customer's
account even though not authorized."</p>
<p>A Connecticut investor, Theodore Vielenski, says in an
interview that he was "hounded a lot" while dealing with
Moran and Sherwood. The superintendent for a Wallingford
contractor complains, "There were times when you said no, you
didn't want to buy, and then you'd get a statement saying you
had bought some shares in some house stock. That, I'd say,
was a big ripoff." He was also bothered that his broker --
the same one at both firms -- wouldn't send him prospectuses
on the companies whose stock he was pushing.</p>
<p>Scott Chopsky, a computer consultant in Bridgeport, Conn.,
says in an interview that he remembers his broker saying,
"This will go through the roof in the next couple of days"
and "You will triple your investment within two months." Mr.
Chopsky, who alleges he lost 80% of his investment, says he
got his first call in the early spring of 1987 when his
broker was at Sherwood. He kept dealing with the broker, at
Moran, through November 1989.</p>
<p>The Garden City brokers would typically make 200 to 300
calls to clients each day. Peter Novrit, a plumber in
Bayonne, N.J., can attest to the phone frenzy. He says, "Even
when I already had an account with Moran, I still got half a
dozen calls to open an account."</p>
<p>He even got one after Moran's bankruptcy filing. "A month
ago, I got a call. The guy said he was from Vanderbilt
Securities," Mr. Novrit says in an interview. "The first
question I asked: `Are you any affiliation of J.T. Moran?'
The guy said yes. I said no thanks." He adds that he lost
close to 90% of his investments at Sherwood and Moran, all
with one broker.</p>
<p>Some former brokers admit routinely misleading clients.
The clients were never warned about the risks in a "house
stock," a stock in which Moran made a market. Former brokers
say clients also didn't know the price they paid for house
stocks included a hidden charge. Anywhere from 20% to 40% of
the price would go to the firm, and half of that to the
broker. Branch managers would get a cut of every sale in the
branch. But brokers often told customers there was no
commission, brokers say. Says Mr. Vielenski in Connecticut,
"They lied to me so much; there was no mention of
commissions."</p>
<p>Known as the "chop," the brokers' cut was the carrot the
firm dangled before them. It encouraged them to sell house
stocks rather than mutual funds or Big Board securities. It
was on its 90 or so house stocks that Moran made most of its
money, say former brokers and clients, by selling and
reselling the shares to clients at constantly higher prices
after having bought them at very, very low prices.</p>
<p>The most infuriating aspect of dealing with the firm, say
several former Moran clients, was the difficulty of selling
their Moran stocks. Former brokers say they were discouraged
from taking sell orders because the firm would lose money.</p>
<p>When Mr. Novrit, the plumber, wanted to sell his 6,000
shares in Istec Industries & Technologies, he says he called
his broker dozens of times but couldn't reach him. Mr. Novri
says his broker had told him in 1988 that Istec, a small
Israeli firm that, among other things, bred tropical fish,
would be "the deal of the century," but the stock began to
plummet in early 1989.</p>
<p>"I wanted out, but they would put me on hold and never
come back. Or I would ask for my broker, and someone would
say he was not at his desk but he'll call you back. And then
he wouldn't," Mr. Novrit says. "Or they'd give me to another
broker and I would say `I want out. I want to sell.' This guy
would say he couldn't do that for me; I would have to talk to
my broker. Then they'd put me on hold. On and on. And the
price just kept dropping." Mr. Novrit finally sold the stock
through a broker at Shearson Lehman Hutton.</p>
<p>When Mr. Magioncalda, the bagel-shop owner, wanted to sell
his $100,000 stake in J.T. Moran Financial, he did reach his
broker. But the broker refused to sell. As the price kept
dropping, Mr. Magioncalda urged him to sell. In his claim,
filed with the NASD in New York, the investor says his
broker, in urging him to buy the units, had guaranteed that
if the stock price ever went below the purchase price, "there
would be an automatic sale order for me, which was never
done." He finally sold the stock through Josephthal & Co. at
a loss of $43,437.50, according to the claim.</p>
<p>Mr. Chopsky had a different problem. The computer
consultant says his broker sold stock out of his portfolio
without telling him and then used the proceeds to buy another
house stock. "I got a notice in the mail saying I owed him
money. He said he thought he was doing me a favor," Mr.
Chopsky says in an interview.</p>
<p>Former Moran brokers at Garden City describe the
atmosphere as "cult-like." The drive to make money was the
ideology, and the leader was Mr. Hasho, the charismatic First
Jersey veteran. Until the second half of 1989, the average
Moran broker was taking home about $8,000 a month.</p>
<p>There are few blemishes on Mr. Hasho's compliance record
other than the recent complaints filed by Mr. Everett and Mr.
Modzelewski. In November 1988, Sherwood Capital filed with
the NASD a disclosure saying 71 of its former brokers,
including Mr. Hasho, had been overpaid commissions at the
time the firm's retail operations folded.</p>
<p>"Each was notified of the overpayment, as was the
broker-dealer they are currently associated with," it says.
"All efforts to resolve this issue, which may or may not have
been brought about willfully, have not succeeded in doing
so." The matter is still pending, NASD records show.</p>
<p>Mr. Hasho, who declines to be interviewed, was a talented
motivator. His posh Long Island estate and $1 million-plus
income was inspiration enough for new brokers. Also inspiring
recruits were the BMWs, Porsches and Jaguars in Moran's
parking lot. To keep the adrenalin pumping, Mr. Hasho and his
supervisors called at least one pep rally a day. Attention
was lavished on the top producers. Laggards were labeled
"negs."</p>
<p>Sometimes, the ridicule was unrelated to production.
Though Ernest Charous was a good producer, his new gold
Corvette was flipped over in the parking lot -- an event
announced over the office public-address system. Another
broker arrived at work on several occasions and found urine
in his coffee cup and on his files. Some former brokers say
they have been harassed over the telephone even after leaving
the firm. (News staffers at this paper repeatedly received
obscene calls while this article was being prepared.)</p>
<p>Moran's brokers vented frustrations by running through the
halls stamping their feet and shouting slogans. After making
a sale, they would ram a water-cooler bottle into the wall.
Partitions and light fixtures were destroyed, a custodian
says.</p>
<p>People who have called on behalf of Mr. Hasho and the
former Garden City branch but won't identify themselves say
the former Moran brokers are spreading false information
about their former colleagues. The motive, they say, is to
attract former Moran clients to their new firms, though some
of the former brokers who are talking to reporters, the NASD
and the SEC no longer sell securities. And the former clients
who are suing, the anonymous callers say, are trying to blame
their own investment mistakes on their brokers.</p>
<p>Even though Moran's second public stock offering, in
October 1988, brought more than $20 million, nothing could
stem the tide of red ink or stop the government from
investigating. In December 1989, several NASD agents visited
the Garden City office and confiscated scripts and other
records. A month or so later, the firm, its parent and two
other subsidiaries filed for protection under Chapter 11.</p>
<p>Just why regulators didn't pick up the scent of problems
earlier is a complicated issue. Investigators and attorneys
blame the limited resources and the difficulties. "Putting
together a stock-manipulation case is a very complicated
process," says Ira Sorkin, a New York attorney who in the
1970s prosecuted many stock-manipulation cases. "If there's a
network of 300 brokers, where do you cut it off? You can't
indict them all," Mr. Sorkin says. "And by the time you have
a case against the ones you do nab, the nature of the
business is such that the rest have scattered."</p>
<p>Mr. Berry, the New Jersey enforcement director, notes the
value of going after the top tier. "It's not a deterrence
unless the message gets out, and it's easier to get the
message out when you've got the big players," he says. But he
adds that the common reluctance to prosecute minor players is
a dangerous thing that many regulators seek to change. "The
failure to hold the brokers accountable sends the message
that they can get away with lying to clients and a wide range
of other crimes on a regular basis," he says.</p>
<p>But none of this assuages the frustration and anger of
former First Jersey, Sherwood and Moran clients. Says Joel
Bernstein, the New York attorney representing Mr.
Modzelewski, "He stuck with his broker largely because he
believed if there was really something wrong, someone, in the
NASD or the SEC, would be out there catching it. He thought
there was a system out there to catch the thieves, if they
existed. Now, he's not so sure."</p>
