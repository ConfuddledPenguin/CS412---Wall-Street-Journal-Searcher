	<p class="article-leader">Courts Rule Both Ways
   On `Pictures of Pain'</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>USE of medical thermography is stirring a heated debate in
the courts.</p>
<p>Controversy is intensifying over whether the technique
effectively diagnoses soft-tissue injuries and should be
admissible in court as proof of injury. Insurance companies,
particularly State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., and
Allstate Insurance Co., a unit of Sears, Roebuck & Co., are
fighting the technique on two fronts: to bar its use as
evidence in personal-injury suits and to avoid paying policy
claims for the tests.</p>
<p>The technique measures skin temperature using infrared
photography. Advocates say thermography takes "pictures of
pain," pinpointing muscle and ligament damage, as well as
nerve irritation that doesn't show up on other tests. "It is
one of the finest pieces of demonstrative evidence in court,"
says Harry Rein, a Florida physician and lawyer.</p>
<p>Critics claim thermograms aren't reliable because they
often show signs of injury where none exists or fail to
detect an injury.</p>
<p>Courts have ruled both ways on the issue. A Colorado
appeals court last summer upheld its use as evidence of
injury in a suit, saying the defense didn't effectively
challenge it, and a New Jersey judge has ordered insurers to
reimburse patients for physician-ordered thermography.</p>
<p>But in March, a Maryland judge called the technique
"invalid" and said State Farm didn't have to pay for it under
the personal injury protection clauses of auto policies.</p>
<p>Insurers, according to Dr. Thomas H. Ravin, a Denver
orthopedist who uses thermography, "have a great fear there
is something that can show people are hurt" who aren't
"smashed to smithereens."</p>
<p>Sick of Legal Bills?</p>
<p>Then Do It Yourself
</p>
<p>PEOPLE ATTEMPTING to handle legal affairs on their own are
finding a lot more tools at their disposal.</p>
<p>Publishers and software makers are catering to the legal
do-it-yourselfer with books and computer programs that
explain how to manage simple legal matters such as an
uncontested divorce or preparing a will.</p>
<p>"A lot of packages and kits are on the market that weren't
there five years ago," says George Milko of HALT, a legal
reform group. A key reason for the interest is the high cost
of lawyers. "Sometimes there's no choice," says Mr. Milko.
"For instance, a woman petitioning for increased child
support may not be able to afford a lawyer."</p>
<p>"Our growth has been phenomenal," says a spokeswoman for
Nolo Press, a legal self-help publisher based in Berkeley,
Calif. Nolo said its sales are $5 million, up from $3 million
in 1988. Among its 60 or so titles, one of the top sellers is
Will Maker, a software package that asks questions and then
plugs in the appropriate legal language for one's home state
and circumstances.</p>
<p>Another software package, Personal Lawyer Lifestyles,
which is marketed by BLOC Publishing Co., Coral Gables, Fla.,
includes a prenuptial agreement and a pact for unmarried
couples who live together.</p>
<p>An American Bar Association spokeswoman says it has found
some guides "to be very good and others not so good."
Potential drawbacks include "not recognizing when you are
hurting yourself or missing an opportunity."</p>
<p>Doing Business Abroad</p>
<p>With Fewer Restraints</p>
<p>COMPANIES in the U.S. are breathing easier about their
dealings abroad as a result of 1988 changes in the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act.</p>
<p>Amendments to the law, which covers business bribes,
sought to make the standards for U.S. companies doing
international business more workable and to rid the law of
ambiguities.</p>
<p>"Corporate executives and corporations certainly feel more
comfortable about the law now," says Robert Craft, an
attorney with Sullivan & Cromwell in Washington. The Justice
Department has yet to issue new compliance guidelines, but
lawyers say they're getting far fewer inquiries from clients
worried about inadvertently breaking rules.</p>
<p>Now, companies break the law only if they knowingly make
an illegal payment. Previously, companies broke the law if
they "had reason to know" a payment was illegal. "Grease
payments," formerly allowed only to low-level foreign
functionaries, are now permitted to facilitate a routine
matter, such as getting a visa or a permit, but not to get or
keep business. And it's proper to make payments allowed under
the written laws of a foreign country.</p>
<p>But the changes have far from eliminated the competitive
disadvantage that U.S. companies sometimes face abroad. After
a European concern with Middle Eastern and Far Eastern units
was taken over by a U.S. company, its foreign managers were
stunned to learn that many of their common business practices
were taboo, says Marc K. Ritzmann, an attorney with
Kilpatrick & Cody in Atlanta. "U.S. companies still often
find they can't engage in activities their local competitors
do every day," he says.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>THE FLORIDA BAR says neglect by lawyers is the most common
gripe of unhappy clients. It said 23% of 7,175 complaints it
received in fiscal 1989 came from people who felt their
attorneys neglected them. An additional 10% were distressed
about fees, and 9% said attorneys showed improper personal
behavior. . . . Pennsylvania's Legislature is considering a
law to exempt manufacturers regulated by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration from punitive damages in
product-liability cases unless they fraudulently concealed
information from the FDA.</p>
