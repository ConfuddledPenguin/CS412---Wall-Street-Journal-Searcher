	<p class="article-leader">Franklin Savings Bank said it applied to the Michigan
Financial Institutions Bureau and the Office of Thrift
Supervision to convert to a state-chartered commercial bank
from its current status as a federally chartered savings
bank.
   The conversion is subject to shareholder and regulatory
approvals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Franklin, based in Southfield, Mich., was the first
savings institution to apply for a national commercial bank
charter after enactment of the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989. However, Franklin
officials said they are now seeking the state charter because
of delays in promulgating the regulations and uncertainties
over the interpretation of such conversions under the federal
act.</p>
