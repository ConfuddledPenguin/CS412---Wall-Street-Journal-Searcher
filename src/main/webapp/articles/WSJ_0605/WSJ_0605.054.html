	<p class="article-leader">LAS VEGAS -- Donald Trump's personal and financial
tribulations are giving him cold feet over a second trip to
the bookstore.
   "Trump: Surviving at the Top," is due for publication by
Random House in October, a sequel to the wildly successful
"Trump: The Art of the Deal," which sold between 900,000 and
one million copies in 1987. But speaking at a breakfast at
the American Booksellers Association convention here
yesterday, Mr. Trump said he called Random House associate
publisher Peter Osnos several days ago and "tried to put the
book off, postpone it for a year."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a jocular speech, Mr. Trump told the ABA crowd that he
was persuaded to go ahead in spite of his reservations by
Random House executives. But, he said, "We may have to end
certain chapters with a question mark. We may have to end the
whole book with a question mark."</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, usually not shy about publicity, said he told
Random House's Mr. Osnos, "This really isn't good timing for
this book: There are so many unknowns. I'm getting the worst
press of my life. How can we bring this book out now? I mean,
the marriage, the this, the that. I named 10 other small
things" that are unresolved. Mr. Trump was referring to the
much-publicized rift with his wife, Ivana, and to reports of
concerns that he won't be able to meet interest payments due
in the next few months. Yesterday, Trump Organization said it
is "meeting with major banks and having cooperative and
constructive discussions" regarding the company's assets.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, who said he is still finishing "Surviving at
the Top," added that he still thinks it might be better to
postpone the book until everything is resolved. "Then I'll
know how the marriage turned out, whether my victory over
Merv Griffin was really devastating." Mr. Griffin's Resorts
International Inc. is under bankruptcy protection following a
well-publicized battle for control with Mr. Trump. "I told
him {Mr. Osnos} that Chapter 11 has to be the Merv Griffin
chapter," Mr. Trump joked at the booksellers meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump was persuaded to write a second book by his
friend S.I. Newhouse Jr., whose family's Advance Publications
Inc. owns Random House.</p>
<p>While he didn't specifically comment on his financial
situation, Mr. Trump did read a paragraph from his new book
that could be taken as a response to those skeptical of his
chances. "Toughness is being a gracious winner and bouncing
back when you lose," he read. ". . . Some say I'm at the
beginning of the end, but I say this is just the beginning of
the beginning."</p>
