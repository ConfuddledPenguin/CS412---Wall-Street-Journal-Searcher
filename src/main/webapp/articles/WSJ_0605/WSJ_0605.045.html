	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The high-yield junk bonds of Trump Taj Mahal
and two other casinos operated by Donald Trump tumbled
sharply yesterday on news that the developer is facing a cash
crunch.
   Trump's casino bonds, already hammered by weakness in the
Atlantic City, N.J., gambling market, dived as much as nine
points, or $90 for bonds with a $1,000 face amount.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bonds recovered slightly later in the day but still
wound up with heavy losses, especially for the bonds of
Trump's costly new Taj Mahal casino.</p>
<p>While the prices of the bonds should not directly affect
Mr. Trump's continuing negotiations with his bankers, they
are an indication of the public's declining confidence in his
ability to stay solvent.</p>
<p>The price decline is likely, however, to cause bondholders
to put pressure on Mr. Trump to make sure that they receive
their interest payments. In the past, companies have used
their own depressed bond prices as a rationale for a
restructuring whereby bondholders would receive less than par
for their bonds.</p>
<p>The sell-off followed an article in this newspaper
disclosing that Mr. Trump's bankers, who are owed $2 billion,
are seeking a restructuring of the developer's assets that
could force him to give up a chunk of his empire. The bankers
fear some Trump properties aren't generating enough cash. As
part of the negotiations, the bankers are opposing his making
a mid-June payment of a relatively minor $30 million on
certain casino bonds.</p>
<p>In a statement yesterday, Mr. Trump's principal holding
company, Trump Organization, said the company is currently
"meeting with major banks and . . . having cooperative and
constructive discussions. Based upon the excellent asset
values and their long-term earnings potential, we are
confident we will arrive at a mutually beneficial solution."</p>
<p>Hardest-hit yesterday were the bonds of Mr. Trump's giant
new Trump Taj Mahal, which is considered the weakest among
the developer's three casino hotels because it is the newest
and has the heaviest debt load. The Taj Mahal, which opened
in April, requires $1.3 million in revenue a day to break
even. Trump Taj Mahal Funding 14% bonds due in 1998 plunged
eight points, or $80 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount, to
close at a price of 57 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Trump Plaza Funding's 12 7/8% bonds due in 1998 fell four
points to close at a price of 81. Trump Castle Funding's 13
3/4% bonds due in 1997 fell eight points to end at 61.</p>
<p>David Feinman, a junk-bond trader at Los Angeles-based
Jefferies & Co., said investors dumped Trump bonds for fear
they would continue to erode on any further news of financial
strains for Mr. Trump. "When approaching any troubled
situation, people would rather sell now" and cut their
losses, he said, "rather than wake up two days from now" and
find prices even lower. "This market is very sensitive to
negative press."</p>
<p>Mr. Feinman said trading volume in Trump bonds yesterday
wasn't especially heavy. He said the thin trading may have
exacerbated the decline. Overall, the developer's interests
have more than $1 billion in bond debt outstanding, in
addition to the bank loans. The Wall Street Journal reported
that bankers have been resisting the payment of roughly $30
million in interest due in mid-June to bondholders of the
Trump Castle casino. The bankers were said to be opposed to
Mr. Trump's making the payment until steps can be taken to
ensure that payments due them will also be made.</p>
<p>Trump has a $50 million bank loan outstanding on the Trump
Castle property to finance expansion of the site, analysts
say.</p>
<p>Some high-yield junk analysts are skeptical that banks
could prevent Donald Trump from making the approaching
interest payments on the Trump Castle bonds.</p>
<p>"It's like Visa telling you not to make your home mortgage
payment because you have a loan" on your charge card, says
one high-yield analyst. "The only recourse the banks have is
that they can put the obligation back to Donald personally."</p>
<p>Ann Lorsung, an analyst at McCarthy Crisanti & Maffei
Inc., said the Trump Taj Mahal bonds were slammed the hardest
because "it looks like the casino's requirements for external
financing are greater than expected." The three casinos'
bonds aren't personally guaranteed by Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump declined to comment through a spokesman.</p>
