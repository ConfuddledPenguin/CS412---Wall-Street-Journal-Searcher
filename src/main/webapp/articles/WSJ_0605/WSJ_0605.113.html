	<p class="article-leader">Builders Transport Inc.. Camden, S.C., said a tentative
agreement to be acquired by Comcar Industries Inc. has
collapsed.
   But the trucking company added that a second takeover
proposal from Trism Inc. is still being pursued.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In February, Builders Transport signed a non-binding
letter of intent to be acquired for $15 a share, or $73.6
million, by closely held Comcar, an Auburndale, Fla.,
trucking company.</p>
<p>Yesterday, however, Builders Transport said that Comcar
isn't willing to proceed with the transaction and that the
letter of intent is "no longer operative."</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Builders
Transport closed at $10, down 75 cents.</p>
<p>Builders Transport added that Trism, the Joplin, Mo.,
parent of trucking firm Tri-State Motor Transit Inc. of
Delaware, has completed its due diligence and is working to
secure financing. Trism has proposed to pay $14 cash plus $3
of preferred stock for each Builders Transport share.</p>
<p>Builders Transport said it is still hopeful that a
transaction with Trism, Comcar or some other party may be
completed. But it said it is also considering other
alternatives, including an internal restructuring.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company said its annual meeting will be
held on Sept. 18, adding that it had waited to set the date
so that all options could be considered at a single meeting.</p>
