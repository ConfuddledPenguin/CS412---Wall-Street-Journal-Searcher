	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- After a year of steady increases, foreign
semiconductor market share in Japan leveled off in the first
quarter, according to independent industry statistics.
   American officials said they were disappointed by the 13%
share, a 0.1 percentage point increase over the fourth
quarter of 1989. The five-year U.S.-Japan semiconductor
agreement expires a year from now, and Americans say the
Japanese promised to work for a 20% foreign share by the end
of the pact.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We're pleased with the changes in attitudes and practices
of Japanese (semiconductor) users," said E. David Metz,
executive director of the U.S. Semiconductor Industry
Association's Japan office. "However, in light of the modest
increase in this most recent quarter, we still need greater
efforts."</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, foreign share grew by nearly one
percentage point over the previous three-month period,
according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (WSTS)
organization.</p>
<p>Japanese industry and government officials, who deny ever
agreeing to a market share target, played down the
significance of the numbers, saying that a dip in the overall
semiconductor market in the first quarter made it difficult
for electronics companies to increase foreign share. They
added that foreign share will likely increase sharply again
in the current quarter ending June 30.</p>
<p>Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry,
which measures market share differently than WSTS, showed
foreign share increasing nearly one percentage point in the
quarter, to 17.2% from 16.3%. A MITI official said the agency
measures orders, while WSTS measures shipments.</p>
<p>When the bilateral trade agreement was first negotiated in
1986, foreign share of the Japanese chip market hovered
around 9%. As the numbers remained stuck during the first
year of the agreement, the U.S. imposed sanctions on certain
Japanese imports using semiconductors.</p>
<p>But in the past two years, companies from both countries
have started working more closely together, and the U.S. has
curbed its criticism.</p>
