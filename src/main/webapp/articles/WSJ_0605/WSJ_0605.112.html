	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- New York Telephone, a unit of Nynex Corp.,
said it plans to establish a separate telephone area code for
the Bronx to meet the rapidly growing demand for cellular
phones and pagers.
   The new area code, 917, would go into effect in September
1992 under a plan filed with the New York State Public
Service Commission. The new area code will also serve all
cellular phones and pagers currently in the 212 area code in
New York City.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Currently, Manhattan and the Bronx share the 212 area
code. Growth in information-intensive businesses could
exhaust telephone numbers available in the 212 area code by
1993. Queens, Brooklyn, and Staten Island, which all share
the 718 area code, woudn't be affected.</p>
