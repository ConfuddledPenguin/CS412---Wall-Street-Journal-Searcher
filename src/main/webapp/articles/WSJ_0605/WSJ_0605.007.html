	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Under pressure from China, several Japanese
banks in recent days have shelved plans to enter the Taiwan
market.
   As many as eight Japanese banks had been expected to
follow Bank of Tokyo after it announced plans in May to open
a representative office in Taiwan. But after criticism of
those plans by People's Bank of China late last week, the
other Japanese banks got the message "not to go to Taiwan
now," according to the managing director of a large Japanese
bank in Hong Kong.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Bank of Tokyo spokesman said the bank still intends to
open a Taipei office. But he said that the issue is "very
sensitive" and that bank officials are conferring this week
on those plans and China's reaction.</p>
<p>A Bank of Tokyo official in Hong Kong said the bank hopes
the controversy dies down so the Taipei office can quietly
open in July as planned, but he conceded that some executives
in Tokyo want to reconsider the move.</p>
<p>Bank of Tokyo's move into Taiwan surprised banking
analysts. Though Japanese banks long ago recognized the
island's economic potential, relations with China had always
been considered too sensitive to risk establishing direct
commercial ties with Taiwan, which China continues to claim
is part of its territory. Many Japanese banks have used Hong
Kong subsidiaries to do business with Taiwan.</p>
<p>If Bank of Tokyo goes ahead, it would be the first
Japanese bank to enter Taiwan since Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank set
up an office in 1960. Dai-Ichi Kangyo's ties to Taiwan have
kept it barred from doing any substantial business with China
in the past three decades.</p>
<p>Still, Japanese authorities apparently thought the time
might be right for a change in policy. Japanese banks have
done little business with China in the past year because of a
government curb on new loans since the Chinese government's
massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing last June.
Meanwhile, Taiwan's economy has remained robust, and economic
relations between China and Taiwan appeared to be improving.</p>
<p>In addition, some large Japanese securities companies had
received clearance from Tokyo to buy into Taipei brokerage
firms. But unlike the banks, which have extensive loans
outstanding to China and hope eventually to resume
substantial lending, the securities firms have little
business with China and so can't be as easily pressured, a
Japanese banker in Hong Kong said.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese banks haven't given up on Taiwan, he
said. They are merely waiting "for a more appropriate time."
A spokesman for Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said
going into Taiwan is a "private decision for the banks to
make."</p>
