	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks closed slightly higher in light trading,
helped by a minor rally in shipbuilding and construction
stocks, traders said.
   But dealers lacked incentive to push the market
aggressively, and institutions and individual investors were
unenthusiastic about trading stocks on the first section,
observers said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, London stocks were lifted off their intraday
lows at the close of quiet trading, with the market shadowing
the fortunes of Wall Street.</p>
<p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 34.25 points to
32925.37, after falling 239.68 points Friday.</p>
<p>At midmorning Tuesday in Tokyo, the Nikkei index had
advanced 25.27 points to 32950.64.</p>
<p>Monday's volume on the first section was estimated at 650
million shares, down from 709.1 million shares Friday.
Advancers outnumbered losers 521 to 417, while 188 issues
were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section added 0.69 point, or 0.03%, to 2427.24. The
index fell 9.19 points Friday.</p>
<p>The second section index rose 18.32 points, or 0.46%, to
3992.94, after advancing 36.34 points Friday. Volume was
estimated at slightly less than 20 million shares, down from
29.3 million shares Friday.</p>
<p>Interest in the second section remains strong, one trader
at a foreign securities firm said, because recent earnings
results offered attractive growth opportunities.</p>
<p>Moreover, prices on the second section are seen as easier
to urge higher, another trader at a Japanese firm said.</p>
<p>With the exception of May 25 and May 28, the second
section index has risen since April 26. From the recent low
of 3313.92 points April 5, the index has recovered 20.5%.</p>
<p>The rebound compares with a 17.6% recovery on the Nikkei
Index since its recent low of 28002.07 points April 2, and a
17.9% recovery on the Topix since its recent low of 2058.82
points April 5.</p>
<p>Reduced commission tables, which became effective
yesterday, were one reason for fundamental softness in the
first section, as well as another explanation for the second
section index's strength, one trader pointed out.</p>
<p>Dealers probably were chasing large-capital issues, such
as shipbuilding, construction and mining shares, in order to
improve volume, and conceivably to make up for the decrease
in their commissions, he said.</p>
<p>On the other hand, institutions, who have just finished
reevaluating their book losses for the year ended March 31,
would only increase costs by participating in the first
section at current prices, the trader said.</p>
<p>As a result, institutions have been selectively
participating in the higher-potential second section issues,
as well as in better-performing Osaka Stock Exchange second
section issues and over-the-counter shares, analysts said.</p>
<p>Market reaction to U.S.-Soviet Union discussions
concerning a united Germany's possible membership in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been indecisive, as
should be expected because the talks likewise were
inconclusive, traders said.</p>
<p>The dollar firmed against the yen, but foreign-exchange
market response to the talks was also limited, equity traders
indicated.</p>
<p>Stock market participants are seeking a clearer move in
currency rates before they will establish speculative
positions on the U.S.-Soviet Union talks, traders said.</p>
<p>Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's scheduled East Asian
visit, meanwhile, is expected to stimulate a firmer response
from the stock market, the traders added.</p>
<p>Despite some afternoon selling pressure, steel stocks
ended mostly higher.</p>
<p>Daido Steel rose 26 yen to 989 yen (17 cents to $6.52),
Nisshin Steel added 10 yen to 990 yen and Tokyo Steel
advanced 200 yen to 4200 yen.</p>
<p>Oil stocks slipped on profit-taking, as Showa Shell fell
30 yen to 1320 yen, and Teikoku Oil Co. dropped 10 yen to
1270 yen.</p>
<p>In London, the slightly weaker pound kept the market under
pressure. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index
gained 7.6 points to 2379.</p>
<p>Dealers said that London lost some of its recent steam, as
the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered slightly under the
psychologically important level of 2900 late in the London
afternoon.</p>
<p>"We've had such an amazing run, we would expect to see a
period of consolidation," said one trader.</p>
<p>Some investors were reportedly distrustful of the recent
sharp rally and weren't prepared to commit further funds to
the market. Yesterday's volumes were consequently depressed,
although start-of-the-week trading is typically slow.</p>
<p>Volume was 430 million shares, slightly under the 499.3
million shares Friday.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index rose 11 points to
1893.4, while in the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100
index contract ended at 2422, compared with Friday's close of
2411.</p>
<p>The market was also slightly depressed by afternoon
suggestions that the food retail sector might start having
supply problems. One unidentified retailer reportedly
complained that its supplies were being disrupted, suggesting
that other large retailers Argyll, Sainsbury and Tesco, might
undergo similar difficulties.</p>
<p>However, this situation couldn't be confirmed with the
individual companies. Argyll was off 6 pence to 234 pence (11
cents to $4.44), Sainsbury eased 4 pence to 290 pence, while
Tesco was off 6 pence at 223 pence.</p>
<p>Among stocks to fall, Enterprise Oil posted the biggest
losses. It fell 17 pence to 648 pence as speculation fades
that Elf Aquitaine will mount a bid for the company.</p>
<p>Boots was up 13 pence to 310 pence, with its earnings
later this week expected to include news that the company's
heart drug, Manoplax, is selling well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, markets were closed in Belgium, West Germany,
France, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden for Whit
Monday. Prices in Milan fell, while South African gold stocks
fell sharply.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, prices closed higher in Sydney and Seoul; lower
in Singapore, Manila and Taipei; and mixed in Hong Kong.
Wellington was closed.</p>
