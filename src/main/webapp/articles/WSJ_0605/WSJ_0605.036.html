	<p class="article-leader">WARSAW -- The parasites crawled in first. At labor offices
each day now, they slump on benches side by side,
recuperating from their latest binges. Every few minutes, a
bureaucrat's door opens, and out weaves another addition to
Poland's lengthening register of the unemployed.
   "The Communists destroyed my health," one says, unsteadily
easing down the steps. He has a yellowing bruise below his
left eye. "I had to steal. I became a bandit. The Communists
did it."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Before Solidarity took over and rewrote the rule book,
Poles who didn't have bona fide jobs -- not only bums but
illegal moneychangers and underground novelists -- had to
pretend they did. Unemployment was a capitalist sin. In
January, Solidarity's sinfully capitalist new government
legalized it and started to pay jobless benefits. So the
parasites who used to pretend they had jobs showed up at the
labor offices pretending they didn't.</p>
<p>That was the first wave. Then, one by one, came those who
did have jobs but only pretended to work. Solidarity had also
restored the boss's right to fire individuals -- with one
month's notice, for almost any reason, and with just five
days for the worker to protest. By mid-February, 107,000 of
the freshly axed, among them tradesmen who couldn't hold
their own, had limped into the labor offices to register as
unemployed. By mid-April this was up to 318,000, and by the
end of May 443,000. Now, two more waves are about to break.</p>
<p>When school lets out, 300,000 high-school graduates will
want jobs. Every one of last year's graduates went straight
to work, as did every graduate of the past four decades. This
year, only half will.</p>
<p>Mass layoffs will come by summer, after three months'
notice and the unions' futile foot-dragging. At least 200,000
layoffs are in the pipeline already at 6,000 failing
factories, not to mention 38 people at the National Center
for the Methodology of Political Studies and 500 at the
Enterprise for Industrial Automation. As many as two million
could be on the dole by year end.</p>
<p>Solidarity hasn't blinked. Brazenly, compared with
governments in the West that try to paper over capitalism's
usual ups and downs, this one advertises unemployment as
central to its economic plan. A healthy percentage of people
without jobs, it posits, will thin the bloated work force and
create a new market, not just for goods but for labor. A
wildcat strike suspended last week at Lech Walesa's urging
has only hardened its resolve. While the Soviet Union's
economists still tremble when they think of the jolt that
unemployment could bring, Poland's extol it.</p>
<p>"There is greater appreciation among people now of their
jobs, and product quality has already improved," Finance
Minister Leszek Balcerowicz boasts in his first-quarter
report. "A certain marginal unemployment is a natural element
of any market economy." Adds his adviser, Jacek Rostowski:
"There has to be a feeling that jobs are no longer
guaranteed."</p>
<p>In theory, the people understand. Since January, they have
seen the economy's output fall 25% as a Solidarity-made
recession closed over the country. Their buying power has
collapsed. But they have also watched the shops fill up with
goods and January's 80% inflation fade to below 5%. For all
of communism's teachings, they accept as a fact that
unemployment, and the threat of it, can be a good thing.</p>
<p>That's the theory. Now for the experience.</p>
<p>"They aren't too depressed yet," says Irena Jasinka,
standing in the hallway of the special labor office for
white-collar workers on the ground floor of a scruffy Warsaw
apartment block. She has been a clerk here 35 years.
"Benefits are new. A novelty. Once they get used to this,
they'll start complaining."</p>
<p>A few yards down the hall, a group of first-timers gathers
at a notice headed, "What every unemployed person should
know." Some are young, some gray, all neatly dressed. They
read quietly.</p>
<p>"It shocks me to see them here," Mrs. Jasinka says. "We
used to get a different sort -- capricious, looking for
something better, demanding everything. We spoiled them. Now,
they'll take anything so someone else won't snatch it away."</p>
<p>The walls of the main room are hung with glass cases, job
offers on index cards tacked inside: "Accountant with
knowledge of foreign trade. English and German required."
"Telex operator. Must speak German." "Engineer. Good
knowledge of English, foreign experience; knowledge of
IBM-AT."</p>
<p>Slim pickings. In Polish, "white-collar worker" translates
as "a person who works with his mind," but the Poles know
them better as "professional tea drinkers." They are the
first to go, and nobody wants them back. Last October,
500,000 jobs went begging in Poland. Now, 29,000 are on
offer, and just 4,000 for tea drinkers, including people who
can speak Gaelic and run supercomputers. As they scan the
index cards, depression sets in.</p>
<p>"I was fired," says Robert Borzecki, turning away from the
cards. A stringy man of 25 in a jacket of many zippers, he
worked until April in the map department of Poland's
geological survey. "Too many people were employed. There was
nothing I could do about it."</p>
<p>His wife, Ewa, stands beside him. She is 24, wears a jeans
suit and has painted her fingernails green. She made up the
menus at the Central Planning Office canteen until she, too,
was fired.</p>
<p>"We don't want to go back to the old way, where you got a
job no matter what," she says.</p>
<p>"We should have unemployment," says Mr. Borzecki, putting
an arm around her. "It's something new, something that proved
itself in the West. But here a man is still a name on a
payroll and nothing else. The old are corrupted. They just
want to survive. Young people who could change things are the
ones who get fired.</p>
<p>"They're afraid a young person with initiative will force
them out. We won't find anything. The woman in there told me.
For people like us, there are no offers."</p>
<p>Poland has set aside $280 million to pay unemployment
benefits this year. (The Borzeckis will get perhaps $50 a
month; today, $20 a month will buy their black bread.) Labor
offices have doubled their staff of 2,000 and put in a new
mind-set. Teresa Popiel, who as the Warsaw region's chief
used to "follow and persecute parasites who were avoiding
work," went to Brussels for three weeks of re-education.</p>
<p>"I saw an office there that employs 300 people and had 11
computer specialists," she says. "I almost had a heart attack
when I saw the building. They had this organized for years
and years, and we only started on Jan. 2."</p>
<p>Now, her officers spend their days phoning company after
company in search of job openings. One branch never knows
what the next comes up with. They have no computers. If they
did, the phone lines wouldn't be good enough to pass on the
details anyway. It's hardly a labor market. Then again, it
wouldn't be even with computers. State-owned companies are
laying people off. They won't be hiring soon.</p>
<p>Solidarity is no fan of those commercial wrecks anyhow. It
lays its bets for new jobs on the same force it relies on to
salvage the country: private enterprise. So far this year,
110,000 small shops have shut, temporarily or for good, yet
many others hung on and 65,000 new ones opened. With easy
loans and Western aid, Solidarity hopes to steer its jobless
toward them. Whether they seize the opportunity will depend,
it seems, on how much nerve is left in them after years of
communism.</p>
<p>Among the index cards at the labor office, someone has
taped up a notice, typed on the multicolored stationery of a
private firm called Meritum: "We employ tradesmen of all
kinds. Please come see us." Jerzy Wasilewski, electrical
engineer, reads it and lights up.</p>
<p>He worked for the state until he hit 40 two years ago,
then left to try his luck as a private electrician. He did
all right until the recession finished him in February.</p>
<p>"I've been here six times," he says, jotting down
Meritum's address. "I'll have to find a job myself. Now,
here's some company looking for tradesmen. I've got my car.
I'll get right over there."</p>
<p>He finds Meritum's offices at the end of a long corridor
in a fourth-rate hotel. It is a seat-of-the-pants
conglomerate: house building, cranberries, steel, computers,
copy shops. Two men sit at facing desks in a room with a pile
of Vietnamese basketry in one corner. Mr. Wasilewski pulls up
a chair for his interview.</p>
<p>"I used to be an electrician," he tells them. "Now, not
much is going on. The labor office has nothing for me."</p>
<p>"Everywhere it sounds bad," one of the men says. "Here
anyone can come and work." Meritum, he explains, will locate
supplies, pay for them, advertise, hunt for contracts -- all
in return for 70% of Mr. Wasilewski's earnings. "You're
qualified. You can do a lot."</p>
<p>Mr. Wasilewski looks amazed. "This is the first
proposition that sounds optimistic," he says.</p>
<p>"You can manage a group of electricians employed by us,"
says the second man. "You hire the people."</p>
<p>"I could create a group like that]"</p>
<p>"Please think about it. Electrical things are always
breaking down. It's not that difficult."</p>
<p>Mr. Wasilewski agrees to round up a team of electricians
and leaves, walking on air.</p>
<p>The risk doesn't faze him; he knows the rewards of
breaking the state's embrace. But Marx didn't teach ambition.
Most of Poland's dazed rejects, raised to believe communism
owed them a living, won't be so eager to start climbing from
capitalism's bottom rung.</p>
<p>"There's a special psychology to Poles seeking a job,"
says Krzysztof Herbst, a sociologist who is setting up a bank
to help the unemployed go into business. "It doesn't have to
be a good job, but stable. That's the important thing. It's
got to be permanent."</p>
<p>Back home from the labor office on a weekday evening,
Robert and Ewa Borzecki are going over the want ads in
Warsaw's morning paper. They share a cramped room in his
mother's apartment with a big dog.</p>
<p>"I'd like to find a job as a secretary," she says, sitting
in the only chair. "Some ordinary office work. There's an ad
in the paper more or less of this kind. Some foreign
company."</p>
<p>"It's responsible," Mr. Borzecki says. He sits on the
floor, leaning against the cupboard. "You have to handle
money. Big sums. If you make the smallest mistake, you'll
lose several months' pay."</p>
<p>"It's more than eight hours a day. No overtime," she says.
Her husband sneers: "Volunteer work." "I called," she says.
"I'm supposed to go tomorrow. . . ."</p>
<p>The new extension on Sonpol's suburban headquarters is
getting a coat of stucco late the next morning. A shipment of
plastic shampoo bottles stands outside the front entrance.
Clerks at numerous desks inside answer numerous telephones.
Another micro-conglomerate, owned by a Swede, Sonpol makes
toiletries and packs meat. It's branching out now and needs
an extra person in the purchasing department. Four candidates
have come and gone. Mrs. Borzecki is due at noon.</p>
<p>In his carpeted office, Tadeusz Kaminski waits.</p>
<p>"Areas that were exclusively the state's will be given
up," says the owner's representative. "A vacuum must be
filled." So Sonpol is moving into milk processing,
fertilizer, opening a travel agency. "Of course, we can't
absorb the whole work force laid off by the state, but we'll
employ several dozen more people."</p>
<p>He checks his watch. It's 12:45.</p>
<p>"My rule is talk to everyone, consider everything. Maybe
this young woman only took our ad into account. It was a
minimum offer. If she has my conviction -- talk to everyone,
consider everything -- she will come. If I see she has
potential, we can negotiate."</p>
<p>But Mrs. Borzecki doesn't seize her opportunity. At 1
o'clock, she still hasn't turned up, and Mr. Kaminski goes
out to lunch.</p>
