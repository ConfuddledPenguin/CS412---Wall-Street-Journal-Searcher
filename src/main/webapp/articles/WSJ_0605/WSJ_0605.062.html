	<p class="article-leader">LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Dillard Department Stores said it
completed the purchase of J.B. Ivey & Co. from a unit of
B.A.T Industries PLC for about $109 million.
   B.A.T decided to sell Ivey, a chain of 23 department
stores based in Charlotte, N.C., along with other, larger
department-store units as part of a restructuring to fend off
hostile overtures from investor Sir James Goldsmith.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dillard owns about 162 department stores in the Central
and Southwest U.S. The purchase of Ivey marks its entrance
into the North and South Carolina markets and expands its
presence in Florida.</p>
