	<p class="article-leader">Hewlett-Packard Co., Palo Alto, Calif., agreed with Hughes
Aircraft Co. jointly to develop and manufacture computers for
government, military and aerospace uses. The agreement will
create $200 million in revenue over the first three years,
the companies estimated.
   H-P and Hughes said they will be modifying current H-P
equipment to produce new machines that meet U.S. military
standards for prevention of eavesdropping into computers.
They will also develop a high-resolution workstation and
"ruggedized" versions of H-P's commercial workstations that
meet the military's demands for reliability.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Los Angeles-based Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp.,
plans to create a special operating unit to deal with the H-P
alliance. H-P will transfer certain related technology to
Hughes and will provide sales support and service.</p>
