	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The major professional body for U.S.
accountants took a position that effectively allows its
members to accept contingent fees and commissions from
non-audit clients.
   The governing council of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, although it hasn't changed the
institute's rules of conduct, voted to enforce the proposed
changes to the ethics rules agreed to by the institute in
August 1988 in a consent order with the Federal Trade
Commission.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since agreeing to the FTC consent order, the institute has
deferred enforcing its rules on contingent fees and
commissions pending final approval of the consent order by
the commissioners of the FTC. The agency gave preliminary
approval to the order in March 1989, but has yet to give
final approval. The institute has said it would automatically
change its rules, which prohibit all commissions and most
contingent fees, once the commission gives final approval of
the proposed consent decree.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of confusion among the members" about the
issue, said Donald J. Schneeman, general counsel for the
AICPA. "We felt there were members who don't have an
{auditing} relationship; and we wanted to remove that cloud"
of uncertainty; the change would allow them to accept
commissions and contingency fees from non-audit clients
without fear of an enforcement action by the institute, Mr.
Schneeman said.</p>
<p>By the same token, the institute "wanted to send a clear
message" to those accountants who have an auditing
relationship with clients that the AICPA would enforce that
part of its ban on accepting such fees. Violation of the
institute's ethics rules can result in a member's suspension
from the institute.</p>
<p>The profession's rules, for example, had prevented an
accountant from taking a commission for advising a client to
buy specific computer hardware, or taking an audit or
consulting job if the final fee is based on the benefit
derived by the client.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the FTC said she couldn't comment on
when the commissioners might approve a final order or whether
they have considered it.</p>
<p>It isn't clear how many accountants will be affected by
the changes. Although the AICPA has a membership of more than
296,000 CPAs in public practice, the institute noted that its
rules don't override state law or the rules of state CPA
societies. Five states, including Texas and Maryland, have
revoked prohibitions against commissions, the institute said.
Five other states, including California and Florida, have
prohibited accountants from accepting the commissions. "State
law would be paramount" wherever there is a discrepancy, Mr.
Schneeman said.</p>
<p>The dispute over the contingent fees has been
controversial. The institute had long resisted efforts by the
FTC to eliminate the group's ban on the fees. The AICPA had
argued that the ban against contingent fees helped
accountants remain independent and objective.</p>
