	<p class="article-leader">Dress Barn Inc., Stamford, Conn., reported a 7% increase
in earnings for its third quarter but a 26% decline for the
nine months ended April 28.
   The operator of a chain of off-price women's apparel
retail stores said earnings for the quarter rose to $4
million, or 18 cents a share, from $3.7 million, or 17 cents
a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 18% to $70.6 million from
$59.8 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the nine months, earnings fell to $10.1 million, or 45
cents a share, from $13.7 million, or 61 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales rose 13% to $208.3 million from $183.6
million.</p>
<p>Dress Barn said it believes the quarter's results "signify
the end of the promotional retail turmoil of the prior six
months." It said it expects a return to its traditional
growth pattern.</p>
<p>Off-price apparel chains recently have been pressed as
department stores and other retailers undertook big
promotions and widespread discounting.</p>
<p>Dress Barn said as of April 28 it had 456 stores
operating, a rise of 54 from a year earlier. It said it
planned to have 470 stores operating by the end of fiscal
1990.</p>
