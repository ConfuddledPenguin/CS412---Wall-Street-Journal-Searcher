	<p class="article-leader">In 1987, Tom Wolfe wrote a novel about an affluent,
powerful white man who suddenly finds himself ensnared in a
corrupt legal system and menaced by the prospect of a long
stay in prison for a crime he did not commit. In 1987, Scott
Turow wrote a novel about an affluent, powerful white man who
suddenly finds himself ensnared in a corrupt legal system and
menaced by the prospect of a long stay in prison for a crime
he did not commit. Both of these vastly praised, much
discussed, indispensable beach companions became huge best
sellers by tapping into this primal Caucasian fear of the
slammer. Meanwhile, back in the real world, poor blacks and
Hispanics keep going to jail, while people like Charles
Keating keep going on Ted Koppel's show. Messrs. Wolfe and
Turow need to get out more.
   Penal implausibilities notwithstanding, there's no denying
that Mr. Turow's first novel, "Presumed Innocent," was a
pretty good one. A high-class whodunit with more twists and
turns than an M.C. Escher drawing, the novel told the story
of a jaded prosecutor in a fictional Illinois town who
suddenly finds himself accused of murdering a female
colleague, who also happened to be his ex-lover. Actually,
she also happened to be everyone in town's ex-lover, which
made it look like Rusty Sabich was being set up by jealous
rivals, one of whom may also have been the deceased's
ex-lover.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unrelentingly misogynistic -- Mr. Turow's women are either
dolls or dumplings -- but snappily written, "Presumed
Innocent" did pull off the Herculean task of making a
39-year-old lawyer seem sympathetic. All in all, the book was
a fine police procedural, a genuine page turner, and a damn
good read.</p>
<p>But that's all it was. Despite Mr. Turow's obvious gifts
and his publisher's stage-managing of his image -- Former
Justice Department Prosecutor Who Used to Teach Creative
Writing at Stanford Tells All -- "Presumed Innocent" was not
and is not a literary masterpiece that transcends the
thriller genre a la Simenon, Conan Doyle or Poe. In its use
of elaborate gimmicks to throw the reader off the trail, it
is a direct descendant of such ingenious detective novels as
Agatha Christie's "Easy to Kill," "The Murder of Roger
Ackroyd," and "Curtain." (Dame Agatha did not have sexy
females stripped, hog-tied and raped, but, unlike Mr. Turow,
she never worked out of Chicago.)</p>
<p>Throughout "Presumed Innocent," Mr. Turow toys with the
reader, relentlessly withholding pertinent pieces of
information. This allows the author to spring a nasty
surprise in the last 20 pages, but it makes everything that
has gone before seem like one, gigantic con job. Which is why
"Presumed Innocent" cannot be put in the same class as Joseph
Wambaugh's remarkable first novels, "The New Centurions" and
"The Choir Boys." In those searing tales of corruption and
betrayal, there was no shuck and no jive.</p>
<p>There's just about nothing but shuck and jive in Mr.
Turow's interminable second novel, "Burden of Proof" (Farrar,
Straus & Giroux, 515 pages, $22.95). Twice as long as it
needs to be, the novel tells the story of Sabich's attorney,
Alejandro Stern, who arrives home one day to find that his
wife of 30 years has committed suicide. He soon discovers
that his wife had herpes, that she recently had withdrawn
$850,000 from her savings account for an unknown purpose, and
that she may have been having an affair with Stern's
brother-in-law, a sleazy commodities trader who is being
investigated by the federal government for defrauding
customers. Stern just happens to be his lawyer, and the
stooge who handled the trades the feds are looking at just
happens to be Stern's son-in-law, whose wife needs an
abortion, though her brother -- who may or may not be a gay
FBI informer, but who is definitely a physician -- is not the
one who's going to be doing it.</p>
<p>This is one hell of a family.</p>
<p>Wracked with grief at his wife's demise, Stern consoles
himself by sleeping with one of his wife's old friends,
trying to seduce his next-door neighbor, before setting his
sights on the young attorney prosecuting his brother-in-law
-- whom he falls in love with during a hot tub session that
takes place while her husband, a postal worker, is miles
away, writing poetry.</p>
<p>Stern also suspects that his wife's doctor may have been
the one who gave her herpes. This doesn't stop him from
trying to feel up the doctor's wife, a tacky thing to do to a
woman who's just found a videotape of her husband having oral
sex with his nurse. It won't spoil the story to tell you that
the pesky brother-in-law ultimately winds up in bed with one
of Stern's girlfriends, because the story is so nutty you'll
never remember any of this anyway. With its endless plot
twists, red herrings, smoke screens, windy philosophizing and
bed hopping, "Burden of Proof" reads like a collaboration
between Dashiell Hammett and John O'Hara: The Maltese Falcon
Goes to Peyton Place.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, the deeper meaning. Like "Presumed Innocent,"
"Burden of Proof" is an attack on the American
jurisprudential system, which Mr. Turow depicts as being
corrupted by overzealous federal prosecutors who will do just
about anything to advance their careers. "Burden of Proof"
will therefore appeal to libertarian whodunit fans who don't
mind all this stuff about herpes, abortion, knocking off your
sister-in-law and defrauding investors, so long as the writer
makes it clear that it's all the government's fault. Well,
maybe not the herpes.</p>
