	<p class="article-leader">LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- Barton Giles, beaming in his sunny
Hawaiian shirt, leans over the green felt blackjack table to
rake in the chips bet by the novices he has just taken to the
cleaners. "None of you are losers -- just nonwinners," he
says in his well-rehearsed patter.
   The 36-year-old former stockbroker and Bible salesman
teaches gambling with free chips at the huge Tropicana Resort
& Casino here. His students aren't croupiers-in-training, but
credulous crapshooters who don't know how. Or benighted
baccarat players. He teaches these games -- and roulette, too
-- to hotel guests in five well-attended sessions per day.
His students, many of them yuppies who have neglected this
important part of their education, are working up the nerve
to play the games and part with their money, which Mr. Giles
implies they almost surely will do.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>He, meanwhile, gets more and more practice at his song and
dance. With a different script, he could easily enough be a
guide on the Jungle Cruise or the Circle Line. "So? You had
fun," Mr. Giles tells his students. "You could have gone to
Disney World, but who ever won money there?"</p>
<p>Instructors like Mr. Giles at maybe 20 casinos here are
the industry's way of wooing this new generation of customers
who really don't know baccarat from ball bearings. The
casinos post signs to advertise the classes, held at the
gaming tables during off hours.</p>
<p>"The first thing you have to learn," Mr. Giles says, "is
how to pronounce it -- bah-cah-RAH. Like Chevrolet. You'd
embarrass yourself if you told friends you just bought a new
Che-vro-lette. Same thing."</p>
<p>Baccarat is a card game in which the hand is dealt from a
box called a shoe. "How scary is that? Playing with a shoe
box," Mr. Giles quips. Each player is dealt two cards and may
request more. The game is won by the player with cards that
add up to nine, or come closest. Tens and face cards count as
zero.</p>
<p>There's a lot at stake for the house in this curriculum.
Blackjack, for instance, typically has a profit margin of
about 17% for the casinos, in contrast to only about 8% for
slot machines. But slots are the rage with today's
know-nothing gamblers, who are a far cry from the casino
clientele of yesteryear. "Twenty years ago," Mr. Giles
observes, one-armed bandits "were just a necessary evil to a
lot of casinos. They were around for the nickel players, and
to provide entertainment for the wives of men at the craps
tables," he says.</p>
<p>William Dayton, vice president of marketing at the
Tropicana, says the slot glut threatens to "take all the
personality out of the casinos."</p>
<p>Younger gamblers are comfortable with TV, video games and
automated teller machines. So slots, with elements of all
three, have an obvious appeal. On the other hand, "the table
games can cause performance anxiety," says Terry Knapp, a
psychologist at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.</p>
<p>That more bettors are passing up the tables is reflected
in the industry's bottom line. Revenue from slot machines in
Nevada has nearly doubled in the past six years, to $2.8
billion in 1989. Growth from table games in the same period
was a more modest 34%, to $1.8 billion. Revenue from slot
machines in the state first exceeded that of table games in
1984, and slots still are king.</p>
<p>Thus Mr. Giles discusses gambling tactics, etiquette and
the lore of the games to entice newcomers to the tables'
smoky mystique. He passes out practice chips, rule booklets
and directions to the Tropicana's waterfall-fed pool, where
guests can swim right up to blackjack tables. "Hey, we're a
classy joint," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Giles tells six students nearest the table to place
practice chips in its betting circles. One man is stingy with
his bets, pulling a single worthless chip out of a huge stack
provided, gratis, by Mr. Giles. "Sir, you aren't buying
certificates of deposit here. Live a little," says the tutor,
drawing laughs from all around.</p>
<p>He keeps up the easy, reassuring banter. "Don't be afraid
of doing the wrong thing at the tables. The dealers will help
if you aren't sure what to do. But keep your chips close in
case the lights go out," he says.</p>
<p>Laurie Williams, a housewife from Indianapolis, clutching
a black vinyl purse, pleads, "Show us how to win."</p>
<p>"That's the one thing they won't let me demonstrate," Mr.
Giles replies. The only sure way to win, he confides, is "Be
lucky."</p>
<p>The casinos have a big advantage in every game, he admits.
He points to the new, $1 million, stained-glass ceiling over
the Tropicana's main room. "Our customers built that."</p>
<p>The neon of Las Vegas beckoned to Mr. Giles in 1979. A
finance major at Michigan State University (where he dropped
out), he later quit a job selling securities at Olde & Co. in
Detroit to learn still other ways of risking money. Enrolling
in an academy for gambling dealers seemed a natural step.
And, two years ago, he became an instructor at the Lady Luck.
He moved to the larger Tropicana in February. His bosses
won't let him divulge his salary, but instructors are said to
earn as much as $50,000 a year. Croupiers can make that much
or more, including tips.</p>
<p>"I'm like Wayne Newton -- performing is part of this job,"
he says, shaking a pair of dice at his craps class. Craps is
the most complicated casino game: Its aircraft-carrier-shaped
tabletop is a maze of squares and oddly shaped outlines in
which chips are stacked for 11 varieties of bets. The
croupier hurriedly taps a hooked stick before raking in
casino wins. And, for luck, gamblers customarily yell out the
numbers or names of their bets.</p>
<p>Gesturing theatrically with the croupier's stick, Mr.
Giles passes out lists of the odds on each type of craps bet.
But he tears his copy up and tosses it in the air. "You won't
remember all this, and you only need to know the simplest
bets to start having fun," he says. He explains the most
basic bet: Pass -- you win if the dice total 7 or 11, and you
lose on 2, 3 or 12. Other numbers are a standoff.</p>
<p>"Learn by watching other people. Don't do what the
nonwinners do. Hey, you might even win."</p>
<p>At the roulette lesson, standing by the gold-trimmed wheel
with its red and black numbered nooks, Mr. Giles says, "You
may have seen a movie scene where the heroine puts all her
chips on the one number. It keeps coming up and she screams
at the big pile of money in front of her. In real life, it's
usually different."</p>
<p>Betting on one roulette number is a 35-to-1 chance, the
worst odds at any table game, Mr. Giles says. The likelier
strategy is placing each chip partially on at least two or
more numbers. The winnings are smaller, but you improve your
odds. He also recommends such conservative wagers as merely
betting that the roulette ball will land on a number that's
even or odd, or in a red or black nook.</p>
<p>`Of course I would like to bet one number like they do in
the movies, but I couldn't afford to play for long," he says.</p>
<p>He insists that his straight-talk approach to the basics
of gambling reflects a fundamental change in the way casinos
treat guests. "Ten years ago, the attitude at a lot of places
was, `Never give a sucker an even break.'" Now the house
wants you to know what you are up against. Then you might
play, and you will probably lose anyway.</p>
<p>As an employee, Mr. Giles isn't allowed to gamble for his
own account at the Tropicana; he would have to go to another
casino to do that. He says he once was a heavy gambler but
isn't anymore. He has a wife and child to consider now, he
says. In the old days, he says, his biggest win ever was
about $12,000 in one day at craps. His biggest loss -- also
at craps: $3,000 in an hour one morning. "I just figure
breakfast cost $3,000 that day," he says.</p>
