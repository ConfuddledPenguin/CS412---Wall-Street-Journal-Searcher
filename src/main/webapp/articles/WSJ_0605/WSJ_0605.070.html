	<p class="article-leader">WICHITA, Kansas -- Kansas Gas & Electric Co. said a ruling
by the Kansas Court of Appeals means the company won't have
to refund $8.7 million plus interest to its customers as
previously ordered.
   The utility said that the court ruled that a $29 million
annual rate increase granted by the Kansas Corporation
Commission effective January 1989 should have been permanent.
Earlier this year, the state commission rejected a staff
recommendation and ruled that part of the rate increase was
subject to refund. The commission at that time also ordered a
second $6.9 million refund that the company is still
appealing.</p>
