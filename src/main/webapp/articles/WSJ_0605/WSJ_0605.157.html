	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court upheld a federal law that
requires public schools to give student religious groups the
same access to scheduling and facilities that other
extracurricular activities have.
   By an 8-1 vote, the justices ruled that a 1984 federal law
requires an Omaha, Neb., high school to accommodate a
Bible-reading club that students wanted to organize.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an opinion written by Justice Sandra O'Connor, the
court said the law treats extracurricular activities as part
of a public forum created by the school. The federal law, the
court said, means the school can't discriminate against use
of the public forum based on a club's religious, political or
philosophical views. This approach, Justice O'Connor said,
doesn't violate the First Amendment's separation of church
and state.</p>
<p>The eight justices in the majority were split into three
opinions. Six of them, including Justice O'Connor, appeared
to believe that the federal law is constitutional in all
respects. Justices Anthony Kennedy and Antonin Scalia
differed on how to analyze freedom of religion issues under
the First Amendment, but not on the law's validity.</p>
<p>Justice Thurgood Marshall, joined by Justice William
Brennan, agreed that the law was constitutional as applied to
the Omaha school, but they warned that school officials must
be careful to disassociate themselves from the religious
message of the club.</p>
<p>Justice John Stevens dissented.</p>
<p>Officials at the Omaha school refused to allow the
religious club to meet, but a federal appeals court in St.
Louis ruled that the federal law required accommodation of
the club. The high court affirmed the appeals court ruling.
