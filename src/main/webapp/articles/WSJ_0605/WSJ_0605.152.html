	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In a further sign of Wall Street's ills,
Citicorp said it is ending its underwriting, distribution and
trading of municipal securities, a move that will cut 35 jobs
from its payroll.
   Instead, Citicorp will focus on offering so-called
derivative products -- instruments that enable issuers to
hedge interest-rate and other risks -- for bonds issued by
state and local governments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an interview, Glen Sergeon, managing director for
Citicorp Securities Markets Inc., said: "To some extent, it
is an excess capacity issue. It's a marketplace where there
are a lot of players. We will focus on our strengths in
derivatives. It's the place where we have an advantage."</p>
<p>Mr. Sergeon said the change won't affect various other
services offered to municipal issuers, including investment
agreements, short-term remarketing and distribution
agreements and various credit and liquidity services. He said
the company is attempting to place the 35 people in other
jobs.</p>
<p>Citicorp is the latest big underwriter to defect from the
municipals market. In 1987, Salomon Brothers dropped its
municipals unit, amid complaints that the business's
profitability had deteriorated severely.</p>
<p>The move also offers the latest evidence that Citicorp is
no longer attempting to be all things to all customers.
Instead, it is focusing on areas where it can make good
returns. So far, that has meant limiting its underwriting of
corporate debt securities, trimming its U.S. government bond
business, and emphasizing fee-generating activities in its
commercial real estate lending unit.</p>
<p>The municipals market has been suffering from severe
competitive pressures since the passage of the 1986 tax act,
which placed a ceiling on the amount of tax-exempt bonds that
states can issue to support private activities, such as
housing developments.</p>
<p>In 1986, the market's peak year, $222.2 billion in new
municipals went to market, and underwriters on average made
$20.95 for each thousand dollars of a bond's face value,
according to the Public Securities Association. By last year,
volume dwindled to $124.3 billion and the so-called spread
fell to $13.44 for each thousand dollars in face value.</p>
<p>Citicorp last year ranked 16th in long-term municipal
underwritings. In 1987, Citicorp got permission from the
Federal Reserve Board to underwrite some types of municipal
securities that had previously been off-limits to commercial
banks.</p>
<p>Andrew Nybo, a research analyst for the securities
association, estimated that 1990 issuance will rise to $135
billion for the industry. Longer term, he said, volume will
climb as state and municipalities rebuild aging public
facilities and federal revenue sharing tails off.</p>
<p>Citicorp's announcement came after the market closed. In
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Citicorp
closed at $24.375, up 37.5 cents.</p>
