	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- In the fading light of May 15, the Royal
Swedish Navy faced a familiar problem: Sonar signals showed
an unidentified submarine lurking underneath a major Swedish
naval exercise in the Baltic Sea near here.
   First noisemakers, a kind of underwater firecracker, were
dropped to warn the sub it was prowling in Swedish waters.
When the sub didn't move, the Swedes dropped Elmas,
grenade-like weapons designed to burn small holes in a sub's
hull -- not big enough to sink it, but big enough to make it
surface. They apparently missed. In the confusion of the
exploding grenades, sonar contact with the sub was lost.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Excitement and frustration come with the job when you are
a Swedish anti-submarine officer. While the tensions of the
Cold War are winding down elsewhere, the Swedes worry that
continuing Soviet submarine patrols in their waters are
somehow related to Soviet contingency planning for World War
III.</p>
<p>"They continue to come. They are using new patterns and
they are more careful," says Gen. Bengt Gustafsson,
commander-in-chief of Sweden's armed forces. In February, he
says, the Swedish navy spent a week tracking a small sub
patrolling inside a mine field meant to stop submarines from
entering Stockholm's harbor.</p>
<p>The navy triggered three of the mines, to no effect.
Later, a Swedish helicopter got sonar contact with a
submarine-shaped object and dumped a load of Elmas on it. It
turned out to be an old artillery target that had been sunk
years ago.</p>
<p>"As long as you don't have the ultimate evidence, you can
do nothing about it politically," says Gen. Gustafsson, who
adds he has no hard proof of the nationality of the recent
intruders. Nonetheless, he is convinced their presence
relates to some kind of "operational preparedness" on the
part of the Soviets.</p>
<p>Operational preparedness for what? That question bothers
many Swedes. A current best seller here is "Operation Garbo,"
a Tom Clancy-like thriller explaining how Soviet subs would
be used to disrupt Swedish mobilization plans on the eve of a
Soviet invasion.</p>
<p>"They {the Soviets} do it because they have done it for a
very long time and there is no risk associated with it," says
Carl Bildt, leader of the Moderate Party in the Swedish
parliament and a critic of what he considers Sweden's lagging
defense budgets. He says he believes the subs are part of a
plan to give the Soviets control of the Baltic in case of
war.</p>
<p>"It is very difficult for us to find them. It will also be
very difficult for intruders to continue forever like this
without being hit," says Anders Thunborg, Sweden's ambassador
to the U.S. and a former head of Sweden's Defense Ministry.
"That's why it's a very dangerous situation for them {the
Soviets} if they are doing it."</p>
<p>Ambassador Thunborg gives the Swedish government's
official estimate of submarine incidents -- about two a year.
Officials in Sweden's Defense Ministry say privately that
provable intrusions are closer to 10 a year. A recent report
by the U.S. Rand Corp. estimates there are as many as 30
submarine intrusions a year.</p>
<p>The Rand report suggests that with the demise of the
Soviet Union's Warsaw Pact in Central Europe, Moscow's
military strategies may rely more heavily on the north. In
any crisis, the Soviets must protect their nuclear-submarine
force based on the Kola peninsula, and they may feel the need
to seize Sweden and Norway to control the sea lanes in the
Baltic and North Atlantic.</p>
<p>The Rand report, entitled "Stranger Than Fiction," cites a
string of incidents since 1981, when a Soviet Whisky class
submarine ran aground near a Swedish naval base. (Russian
officials said that was a navigational error and continue to
insist that no Soviet submarines are operating in Swedish
waters.)</p>
<p>There have been incidents involving as many as six
unidentified submarines and repeated use of Soviet frogmen,
who, according to the Rand report, severed and carried off
one of the new Swedish anti-submarine mines in 1983.</p>
<p>"Swedish officials still insist that they have finally
gotten serious about sinking the next Soviet submarine found
in Sweden's inner waterways," the report continues, but it
concludes: "While this might well be true, it is nevertheless
difficult to believe." The report argues that Sweden
continues to pull its punches to avoid embarrassing its
superpower neighbor.</p>
<p>Swedes take umbrage at that suggestion. Rear Adm. Claes
Tornberg, commander of the Swedish navy, says that in two
more years he will have the nation's first complete
anti-submarine task force afloat. "We didn't have any
anti-submarine capability before, so we were starting at
zero," he says.</p>
<p>Still, even with sub-hunting equipment, finding submarines
in the shallow waters of the Baltic and amid the 24,000
islands of Stockholm's archipelago is tricky; sonars often
are unable to detect submarines sitting on the bottom and
homing torpedoes often confuse big rocks with submarines.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Adm. Tornberg's ships surprised a submarine
stalking a naval exercise in Sweden's inner waters in 1988.
After they dropped depth charges on it, the sub belched a
large bubble of air and escaped. Since then, the admiral
says, fewer subs have been spotted close to shore.</p>
<p>"We have got him to change his pattern and that is
something," he concludes.</p>
