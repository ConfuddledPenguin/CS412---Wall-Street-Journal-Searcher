	<p class="article-leader">TOYOTA: MOST PROFITABLE</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Toyota Motor Corp. was the most profitable Japanese
company in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1990, according to
a study by Japan's Wako Economic Research Institute. Toyota
also was No. 1 last year.</p>
<p>Toyota posted pretax profits of 569.8 billion yen ($3.75
billion), followed by Nomura Securities Co. with 488.8
billion yen and Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. with 484.7
billion yen.</p>
<p>Among gainers in the ranking of 1,612 companies in terms
of unconsolidated pretax profits, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries
Ltd. climbed to 20th place from 43rd place the year before
and Toshiba Corp. moved to 15th place from 24th.</p>
<p>However, electric-power companies dropped below their
prior-year rankings, hurt by a fall in utility rates in April
1989.</p>
<p>Tokyo Electric Power Co. fell to 16th place from ninth
place the year before while Chubu Electric Power Co. dropped
to 35th place from 22nd place.</p>
<p>PHILIPPINE COMPANY UNDER FIRE</p>
<p>The Philippine solicitor general's office asked a regional
court to cancel the franchise of Philippine Long Distance
Telephone Co. for allowing foreign investors to hold a major
portion of the company's common voting shares. While foreign
investors hold only 8.7% of the company's total capital
stock, they possess 58.85% of the voting shares; the
Philippine constitution allows foreign investors to control
only 40% of local companies. The company has an exclusive
franchise, expiring in the year 2003, to operate domestic and
international telephone service in the country.</p>
<p>FOOD FOR EASTERN EUROPE</p>
<p>The United Nations World Food Program said Eastern Europe
could receive as much as a fifth of global food aid this
year. James Ingram, executive director of the program, said
cereal deliveries to the region could total up to 2.5 million
tons in 1990. A program spokesman said the figure -- about
20% of global food-aid shipments -- was the first indication
of the magnitude of such help for Eastern Europe. Relief
workers have said they fear the West's scramble to support
East bloc reforms will worsen the plight of thousands facing
famine in the Third World.</p>
<p>JAPANESE SPACE ROBOT</p>
<p>The Japanese government will decide in August whether to
allocate $130 million to develop, build and launch the
nation's first space robot, said Kazuo Sato of the Ministry
of International Trade and Industry's Industrial Science and
Technology Agency. Several Japanese companies, including
Toshiba Corp., Hitachi Ltd. and Kawasaki Heavy Industries
Ltd., are contributing to the project, Mr. Sato said. The
robot would be used to repair machinery and perform other
tasks difficult for humans outside gravity.</p>
<p>BEEF BAN CONTINUES</p>
<p>France and West Germany ignored the European Community
Commission's instruction to lift their ban on imports of
British beef, a commission spokesman said. Paris and Bonn
last week imposed the embargo, claiming the deadly "mad cow"
virus that has been plaguing British cattle for months is a
health risk. The commission says there is no proof the
disease can harm humans.</p>
<p>IN ITALY: HO-HUM</p>
<p>Voter turnout in a national referendum on environmental
issues in Italy was so low the results of the referendum were
declared invalid. According to complete returns, just 43.4%
of voters cast ballots Sunday and yesterday. More than 50% of
the 46.8 million eligible voters had to participate for the
referendum to be valid. Voters were asked whether they wanted
to restrict hunting and the use of pesticides in food
production.</p>
<p>CLEANING UP EAST GERMANY</p>
<p>East Germany wants to become a center for the development
of technology to repair environmental damage that has
occurred during the past 40 years in Eastern Europe, a top
economics official said.</p>
<p>Martin Dube, vice secretary in East Germany's Ministry of
Economics, said it "makes sense" for East Germany to take on
that role because the country already is a center of high
technology in Eastern Europe. He said East Germany would also
have a comparative advantage in acquiring new technology
after its planned union with West Germany.</p>
<p>Mr. Dube said East Germany's experience of the effects of
pollution, a result of the former Communist government's
industrialization policies, gives the country an added reason
to develop new methods to clean up the environment.</p>
<p>The development of such an industry, Mr. Dube said, would
come after the unification process has brought East German
industry up to Western standards.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>A wax figure of Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman
Yasser Arafat, complete with his usual stubble beard and a
replica pistol, went on display at Madame Tussaud's museum in
London. The museum said the PLO leader himself provided the
suit and the holster; the three-day stubble is made of yak
hair. . . . Delegates from 167 nations gathered in Barcelona
to check the city's preparations for the 1992 summer Olympic
Games. Despite worries that building programs are behind
schedule, the Barcelona Olympic Organizing Committee has said
it will be able to house all the 40,000-strong "Olympic
family" of athletes and officials.</p>
