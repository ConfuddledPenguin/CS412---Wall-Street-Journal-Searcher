	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- After a decade of costly and largely
unsuccessful efforts to improve schools, educational
reformers are beginning to push for fundamental -- and
politically difficult -- changes in the way public schools
are run.
   Liberals are joining conservatives in calling for an
infusion of free-enterprise philosophy that would shake up
the nation's school systems and provide more choices for
parents and students.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Conservatives contend that primary and secondary schools
are too paralyzed by bureaucracy to improve themselves. Only
market incentives to succeed and penalties for failure will
force the restructuring necessary to improve schools, they
argue. They say the best way to provide these incentives is
to give parents a choice among schools and a voucher system
that would enable them to send their children to the best
school they can find. Good schools would thrive while bad
schools would fail, they contend.</p>
<p>Liberals, frustrated by efforts to improve schools, are
beginning to embrace market incentives as well. Albert
Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers,
has proposed giving schools new freedom to innovate by
releasing them from most regulations and then paying bonuses
to staff members in schools that show the most improvement
over five years. "Systems that have totally ignored financial
incentives haven't worked," he says.</p>
<p>This week the Brookings Institution, a think tank here,
will issue a report that recommends abolishing the
distinction between public and private schools and giving
parents the right and the money to choose any school they
want for their children. In their report, "Politics, Markets
and America's Schools," political scientists John Chubb of
Brookings and Terry Moe of Stanford University propose "a new
system of public education that eliminates most political and
bureaucratic control over the schools and relies instead on
indirect control through markets and parental choice."</p>
<p>Such a recommendation from Brookings, considered a liberal
redoubt, shows the changing politics of the education reform
movement. "It's going to have a tremendous impact on the
whole debate on education choice," says Jeanne Allen of the
conservative Heritage Foundation. Until now, she says, "the
movement for educational choice has been conveyed as
something that right-wing conservatives dreamed up."</p>
<p>In the 1980s, most states set stricter graduation
requirements and poured money into schools to boost salaries
and improve teaching. But the results have been
disappointing. The dropout rate remains close to 30%, average
test scores haven't risen, and employers and colleges
complain that many high-school graduates aren't
well-educated.</p>
<p>"Now it's becoming apparent that the very organization of
the school is a problem," says Thomas Kean, who became
president of Drew University this year after eight years of
leading the nation in education-reform efforts as governor of
New Jersey. Because educational bureaucracies resist change,
"you can't tinker at the edges," he says. "You have to go to
the center, and when you do that, some people are going to be
upset. You get into hard, difficult decisions" about the
powers of unions, school boards and legislatures.</p>
<p>Increasingly, critics compare U.S. public schools to an
unresponsive socialist economy. "The public school is
America's collective farm," says Lewis Perelman of the Hudson
Institute, a conservative think tank. "Innovation and
productivity are lacking in American education for basically
the same reasons they are scarce in Soviet agriculture:
absence of competitive, market forces."</p>
<p>Ted Sanders, President Bush's undersecretary of education,
says, "The whole notion that we can hold institutions
responsible by creating bureaucracies is irrational; it just
doesn't work." He predicts that "there are going to be major
shifts in power" away from politicians and bureaucrats as
teachers, principals and parents gain more control over how
schools are run.</p>
<p>Only strong incentives for success and penalties for
failure will force schools to strive for the management
restructuring and renewal that many U.S. corporations had to
undertake to survive foreign competition in the 1980s, Mr.
Shanker argues.</p>
<p>The Brookings study concentrates on expanding parental
choice to send children to any school they want. Each school,
public or private, would be able to determine its governing
structure and establish its admissions standards, curriculum
and operating philosophy.</p>
<p>Choice has become a buzzword of the education reform
movement. Currently, eight states have enacted plans that
allow parents to send their children to any public school
they choose, but Mr. Chubb argues that these plans don't go
far enough.</p>
<p>"Public-school choice, by the time it gets adopted, is
sort of Soviet-style choice," Mr. Chubb says, asserting that
although children can move from one school to another, all
the schools are basically the same. "Choice is politically
attractive when it is not designed to do much," Messrs. Chubb
and Moe write. "But when it's designed to get to the root of
the problem -- when it seeks to liberate the schools by means
of a thorough transformation of public institutions -- it
generates fierce opposition from every nook and cranny of the
educational establishment."</p>
<p>This is what's happening in Wisconsin, which recently
enacted a novel law that will allow 1,000 children from
low-income families in Milwaukee to attend private schools
with as much as $2,500 a year in tuition assistance from the
state. Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson and Polly Williams, a
Democratic legislator who managed Jesse Jackson's
presidential campaign in Wisconsin, pushed through the plan
to expand education choices for innercity students. But
Herbert Grover, the state superintendent of public
instruction, opposes the law, and education unions recently
went to court to block the plan.</p>
<p>The Milwaukee program emerged from public outrage over the
quality of schools. Kentucky, by contrast, overhauled its
education system in response to a court order. The law passed
this year stresses incentives. Successful schools will get
more money, while the state will send in teams to upgrade
failing schools. In an effort to attack the nepotism that
permeated the Kentucky school system, the law requires all of
the approximately 800 employees of the state department of
education to resign on June 30, 1991, and imposes new rules
on local school boards.</p>
<p>"You've got to have guts" to make such fundamental changes
in the way schools are run, says Chris Pipho of the Education
Commission of the States. "There are ticking time bombs all
over the state."</p>
<p>But former Gov. Kean of New Jersey believes only
fundamental changes that make schools more responsive to
parents and students will make it possible for the U.S. to
meet the ambitious education goals, such as world leadership
in math and science, that President Bush and the governors
have set for the year 2000. "The second wave of education
reform is going to take even more courage than the first,"
Mr. Kean says.</p>
