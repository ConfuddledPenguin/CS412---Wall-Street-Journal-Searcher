	<p class="article-leader">PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia -- "KDE DOMOV MUJ?" reads the
banner hanging over the Prague museum entrance -- "Where Is
My Country," the first line of the Czech national anthem.
   It is also a question being pondered across Hybernska
Street by Josef Tosovsky, president of the State Bank of
Czechoslovakia. At age 39, he took office less than six
months ago and now stands at the vortex of attempts to
transform Czechoslovakia's stumbling, centrally planned,
pollution-belching economy into an efficient, market-oriented
one.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Six months ago, Czechoslovakia threw off 51 years of
one-party Communist rule. Two weeks ago, a new government
approved a reform package with many free-market elements.</p>
<p>But the government that did all this could be out of
office within six weeks. General elections are set for this
Friday, and there are 22 political parties competing for
votes. Almost all of them have their own ideas about what
sort of an economy the country should adopt.</p>
<p>"It is said that the average Eskimo can recognize 50 types
of snow," says Mr. Tosovsky. "We in central Europe can
recognize 50 types of {economic structures}."</p>
<p>Regardless, the tall, shy economist holds fast to his
belief that Czechoslovakia must "reintegrate into the world
economy." With others, Mr. Tosovsky is pushing to privatize
Czechoslovakia's extensive state-owned industries, promote
foreign investment and shape up the Czech currency so it can
be freely exchanged for dollars, marks and yen. Currently,
the koruna, or crown, is worthless outside Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Mr. Tosovsky's first job out of college, in the central
bank's foreign exchange payments department, gave him his
initial taste of the way financial markets work. Two later
stints with a small Czech bank in London solidified his
belief that market-driven economies work much better than
state-controlled ones.</p>
<p>Now his life is changing as quickly as the Czech political
scene. Last Dec. 28, while working in London, he was
appointed head of the State Bank by President Vaclav Havel.
By New Year's Eve, Mr. Tosovsky, his wife and two daughters
were back in Prague.</p>
<p>His challenge is to transform a sleepy, highly politicized
institution into an independent, apolitical central bank. He
seeks for his bank the respect of similar institutions around
the world, and the strength to act as the guarantor of a new
Czechoslovak financial system.</p>
<p>Surrounded by leftovers from the old system who are
seeking to hold onto their jobs, and politicians declaring
they want to get from A to Z but don't know how, Mr. Tosovsky
is perceived increasingly as someone who can get the job
done.</p>
<p>"Tosovsky is down-to-earth and practical," says Samuel L.
Milbank, director in charge of central bank relations for
Salomon Brothers Inc. in New York, who has worked closely
with the State Bank. "People believe in him; he comes across
as being a realist with a plan, a vision."</p>
<p>In five months, Mr. Tosovsky has decentralized
decision-making at the bank and, in an institution not known
for its resourcefulness, promoted people with initiative. He
is surrounding himself with people, some of whom he dragged
out of retirement, who hold similar free-market beliefs.</p>
<p>Some view Mr. Tosovsky as just another "apparatchik" whose
star rose during years of Communist rule. When asked if he
had been a Communist, Mr. Tosovsky replies: "We normally
don't write about that in the press."</p>
<p>But as Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs
International, explains, "A lot of people were Communists; it
was a way to survive. There's a difference between the
believers and the nonbelievers. When you talk to the Czechs,
they seem to know who were the good guys and who were the bad
guys." Mr. Tosovsky, he adds, "is a very able, very
professional, knowledgeable guy."</p>
<p>He is also an optimist. He rattles off Czechoslovakia's
advantages: a relatively stable economy, strong industrial
potential, well-educated and skilled workers, relatively
small foreign debt and a 3.4% year-to-year inflation rate
that many major industrialized nations would envy. What's
more, the country last year ran a $974 million hard-currency
trade surplus.</p>
<p>At the end of 1989, Czechoslovakia owed foreign creditors
$7.9 billion in hard currency. But after subtracting money
owed the Czechs by others plus the country's reserves, its
net debt position is near zero, contends Mr. Tosovsky.</p>
<p>Still, he and other Czech officials concede that some of
those loans, particularly ones to Syria and Iraq, aren't
worth much.</p>
<p>Mr. Tosovsky likes to point out that some economists
estimate Czechoslovakia, a nation of 15.5 million people, has
the industrial potential for a country of 30 million. Indeed,
between the two world wars, Czechoslovakia possessed a strong
economy and several internationally respected industrial
companies.</p>
<p>The central banker's viewpoint isn't unrealistic. "I'm
very positive" about Czechoslovakia's chances for economic
reform, says Mr. Hormats of Goldman Sachs. "But investment
isn't simply going to go there out of sentiment. They've got
to embark on a bold economic reform plan. It is the {East
bloc} country where the government ownership is the most
pervasive," But he agrees that Czechoslovakia "isn't a poor
country; it's just been poorly managed for 50 years."</p>
<p>On that score, Mr. Tosovsky recognizes the hurdles. For
example, he concedes that refitting obsolete factories and
ameliorating the country's choking pollution problem -- in
part by reducing dependence on energy-gobbling heavy
industries -- will cost a lot of money.</p>
<p>His fellow Czechoslovaks constitute another uncertainty.
"The new political system will change completely the life of
society. It is very difficult to know how people will react
to the bankruptcy of factories and unemployment; these will
be here," says Mr. Tosovsky. "We may have to slow down. We
shall see if the people are prepared to tighten their belts."</p>
<p>These concerns don't appear to deter commercial and
investment bankers from the U.S., Europe and Japan, who have
been beating a path to the State Bank's drab, unimpressive
gray building.</p>
<p>Mr. Tosovsky opens his desk drawer and flips through a
stack of business cards to recall the names of foreign
bankers who come by to offer advice, seek counsel or just
generally get a feel for what's happening in Czechoslovakia.
"One day, we had 11 foreign banks in," he says. "The
representative offices of foreign banks is growing every
day."</p>
<p>So far, they are mostly European banks. But Citicorp's
Citibank is considering retail banking here, and A.W.
Clausen, chairman of BankAmerica Corp. has paid a visit. To
help cement relations with Mr. Tosovsky and his bank, Salomon
Brothers two weeks ago staged a seminar for its central bank
clients in Prague.</p>
<p>Mr. Tosovsky and the firm are mum on what the Salomon Inc.
unit might do for the State Bank, but he says he expects to
do business with the securities firm. Some investment bankers
predict that Salomon will underwrite Czech government or
corporate bonds and help the central bank gain higher returns
from its roughly $1.75 billion in gold and foreign reserves.</p>
<p>At a recent news conference in Prague, Salomon Chairman
John H. Gutfreund said: "When one looks ahead for
Czechoslovakia, one can assume there will be a government
bond market and companies and banks, both private and public,
which will sell debt and equity. And our basic role is to
make markets: to have capital come and go from other major
markets around the world."</p>
<p>All this, if it comes, is years ahead, Mr. Tosovsky
acknowledges. "Our basic problem is an inefficient economic
system. Because of the close relationship with the political
system, we lost many tens of years," he says. "It isn't
possible to change the situation from one day to another. It
will take a long time, but we are ready to take radical
steps."</p>
