	<p class="article-leader">Vernitron Corp., which had been pursuing a takeover of
Kollmorgen Corp. for 17 months, lowered its holding in the
Simsbury, Conn., maker of motors and electro-optical
instruments to 4.8% from around 5.5%. Separately, a group led
by the New York money manager Mario Gabelli boosted its stake
in Kollmorgen.
   Closely held Vernitron, a Deere Park, N.Y., maker of
motors and controls, said in a Securities and Exchange
Commission filing it sold 77,000 shares of Kollmorgen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week, Kollmorgen appeared to have won a proxy fight
that Vernitron waged for control of Kollmorgen's board.
Despite the election results, Vernitron said it reserves the
right to institute further proposals and to boost or cut its
holdings.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Kollmorgen declined comment. In New York
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Kollmorgen shares
rose 37.5 cents to $10.75.</p>
<p>The Gabelli group said it boosted its stake in Kollmorgen
to 17.79% from 16.29%. It said in an SEC filing it now
controls 1,948,869 shares, including certain shares bought
May 21 to May 31 for $10.50 to $11 each.</p>
