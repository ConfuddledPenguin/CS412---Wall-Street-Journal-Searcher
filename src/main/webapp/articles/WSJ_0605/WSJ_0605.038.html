	<p class="article-leader">NATIONAL LUMBER & SUPPLY Inc., (Fountain Valley, Calif.)
-- Marty Schaeffer, 43, was named to the new post of
executive vice president and chief operating officer. Mr.
Schaeffer will manage all but the financial operations of the
company, which operates low-price home center stores.
National Lumber, which last April filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law protection from creditors, said Mr. Schaeffer,
formerly with Chicago specialty retailer Handy Andy Home
Centers, would be "instrumental" in its reorganization.</p>
