	<p class="article-leader">Eastern Europe is shaping up as a new frontier for Western
franchisers.
   "We're looking at deals in the entire Eastern bloc," says
a spokesman for Carlson Cos., Minneapolis, which oversees the
Radisson Hotels International chain and owns a Radisson hotel
in a joint venture in Budapest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For now, joint ventures are more common than
American-style franchises. McDonald's Corp., which scored a
hit with its nonfranchised Moscow restaurant, is spreading
the golden arches through joint ventures in Hungary and
Yugoslavia and is training some prospective Eastern bloc
franchisees.</p>
<p>But many franchisers see joint ventures as a way to get
established. Baskin-Robbins Inc., which is entering the
Soviet Union through a joint venture with the Russian
republic, says the arrangement might lead to franchising in
the Eastern bloc within five years.</p>
<p>Western businesses of all types are exploring
opportunities as Eastern bloc countries move to spur economic
development. But franchise operations especially think they
stand to play a major role in the creation of a new class of
Eastern European entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>"Nothing better suits the start-up of a free-market
economy than franchising," says David J. Kaufmann, a
franchising lawyer in New York. "Franchisees are immediately
given backing, know-how and marketing prowess that otherwise
would take decades to obtain."</p>
<p>It might also take a long time for a Western franchiser to
make much money in Eastern Europe. Hard currencies are in
short supply there, and repatriating earnings to the U.S. can
be a problem because of both nonconvertible currencies and
currency controls. Moreover, much of the infrastructure
needed by business -- such as an effective telephone network
-- doesn't exist yet in the region.</p>
<p>"We're taking a very long-term view," says James
Cantalupo, president of McDonald's international arm. "If
anybody is looking for a quick buck, these aren't the
countries to go to."</p>
<p>But if a buck is to be made, it might come faster through
franchising. Zenox Inc., an Atlanta company with interests in
manufacturing, nursing homes and other areas, says it has
agreed to pay $180,000 plus royalties for the rights to
franchise Payless Rent-a-Car System outlets and Mister Donut
shops in Hungary and the Soviet Union. It's also seeking to
franchise a New England pizza chain in the same countries.</p>
<p>"We don't have to reinvent the wheel," says Richard G.
English, president of Zenox. "I don't mind paying royalties
to somebody who already has a working system." By the same
token, he says, many Eastern Europeans won't mind paying
royalties to the joint ventures that Zenox aims to set up
with Soviet and Hungarian partners to sell franchises.</p>
<p>More common, at least for now, are joint ventures. The
McDonald's outlets in Hungary and Yugoslavia are owned
directly by McDonald's and its local joint-venture partners.
Similarly, the 700-seat McDonald's restaurant in Moscow is
part of a joint venture between McDonald's Canadian
subsidiary and Moscow city authorities.</p>
<p>But franchising to Eastern European individuals isn't far
off. Mr. Cantalupo of McDonald's says three prospective
franchisees are in training in Yugoslavia, and one in
Hungary. "One thing you're looking for is an entrepreneurial
track record, and in these countries, it's hard to find
that," Mr. Cantalupo says. "But I suspect we'll have more
people available than we have opportunities, eventually."</p>
<p>The potential franchises, though, may not suit many
Eastern Europeans. Well-heeled McDonald's can afford to take
little cash up front for franchises. But smaller American
franchisers tend to be less flexible. "The problem will be
finding people who can afford to buy a franchise," says
Patrick J. Boroian, president of Francorp Inc., an Olympia
Fields, Ill., franchise-development firm. "People in these
countries are broke."</p>
<p>To succeed, franchisers may also have to lay out millions
of dollars to solve supply problems that normally don't arise
in the U.S. and other advanced economies. McDonald's, for
example, says it had to build a bakery and a meat plant to
ensure satisfactory supplies for the Hungarian restaurants.
Mr. Cantalupo says it takes three to five years -- more than
twice as long as in the U.S. -- to start a franchise
operation in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Though relatively few Eastern European franchising deals
have been announced so far, many are in the works, says Mr.
Kaufmann, the franchising lawyer. "A lot of this is hush-hush
because everybody wants to be the first entrant in his
category," Mr. Kaufmann says. "Nobody is tipping his hand."
But he says a dozen of his clients -- in such sectors as fast
food, lodging and business services -- are looking at Eastern
Europe.</p>
<p>Franchisers' ventures in the Soviet Union should feed
interest in the Eastern bloc. Baskin-Robbins, a unit of
Britain's Allied-Lyons PLC, has formed a joint venture with
the Russian republic to produce ice cream -- including a new
flavor, Gorba Chocolate -- in a $30 million plant due to
start up in 1992. "We will now begin to take a much more
active interest in getting involved in other Eastern bloc
countries," says Michael H. Cohn, president of
Baskin-Robbins's international arm.</p>
<p>McDonald's success in Moscow whets the appetite of many
franchisers. The 700-seat restaurant has been mobbed since it
opened in January, with many people waiting hours to get in.
The English-language edition of Glasnost magazine comments:
"The waiting line winds along busy Pushkin Square for well
over 500 yards, easily eclipsing the procession of people
before Lenin's mausoleum."</p>
<p>Franchisers' interest in Eastern Europe will continue to
grow, says Philip F. Zeidman, a Washington lawyer involved in
East-Europe-Law, a venture that aims to help franchisers
establish themselves in the region. Clients looking to enter
the market include a fast-food chain and a personal-computer
retailer, Mr. Zeidman says. "There are going to be some
people who foul this up and lose some money," he says. "But a
lot more of these ventures are going to be established."</p>
