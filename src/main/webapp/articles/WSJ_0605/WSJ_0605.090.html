	<p class="article-leader">Willis Faber PLC, Britain's second-largest insurance
broker, agreed in principle to acquire New York-based Corroon
& Black Corp. in a stock swap valued at #424 million, or
about $712.3 million. The marriage would create the world's
fourth-largest insurance brokerage.
   The agreement could trigger a major realignment of
insurance brokerages in the United Kingdom and the U.S. and
stimulate more consolidation in the industry. An insurance
broker specializes in assisting primarily corporate clients
in seeking and arranging coverage with an insurance company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the engagement announcement itself was received coldly
by the London and New York stock markets. Faber's stock slid
9% in London on uncertainty over whether the deal would be
good for the British concern. The drop triggered a 7% decline
in Corroon shares in New York, quickly removing a small
premium for Corroon holders and sending the per-share
offering price below what Corroon shares closed at on Friday.</p>
<p>The transaction, which is subject to approval by holders
of each company, is targeted for the end of September. Faber
said it would issue 7.8 of new ordinary shares for each of
20.5 million Corroon common, for a total of about 160 million
new shares. The package would be worth #20.67 (about $34.72),
based on Faber's closing price of 265 pence yesterday. The
package was worth #22.69 ($38.13) when it was announced at
the market's opening; Faber shares were trading then at 291
pence.</p>
<p>Some industry observers believe the transaction could
prompt formation of a new set of alliances between major U.S.
and British brokers.</p>
<p>"Everybody has to be reassessing their alliances right
now," said Russell Miller, who heads a San Franciso-based
investment-banking firm specializing in the insurance
industry. He also believes this acquisition could increase
consolidation among insurance brokerage firms that now feel
they must be larger to compete. "You now have a new
billion-dollar player on the scene," he said.</p>
<p>A Faber-Corroon merger would undo Faber's century-old,
profitable relationship with Johnson & Higgins, another major
U.S. broker. Moreover, the market uncertainty reflects
concern about whether Faber would be getting more from
Corroon than it would be giving up. Johnson & Higgins, which
owns 5% of Willis Faber, contributed about 10% of Faber's
earnings last year, Roger Elliott, Faber's chairman, said.</p>
<p>"It's quite a risky deal," said Julianne Jessup, insurance
brokerage analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Ltd.
in London. Ms. Jessup also said there is market concern over
the share dilution that would result from the issuance of 160
million new Faber shares. "It's such a massive issue," she
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Elliott acknowledged that Faber's ties with Johnson &
Higgins would loosen. But he added: "We've been dealing with
Johnson & Higgins for 100 years. People think everything will
be canceled overnight. That's rubbish. It will take three to
five years to cool down, and we still will be doing some
business with them."</p>
<p>Robert Hatcher, chairman and chief executive officer of
Johnson & Higgins, said the different strategies adopted by
J&H and Willis Faber in recent years "caused some friction"
between the two companies. J&H bought a London broker in
1988, which put the U.S. company, currently the
fourth-largest in the world, directly in the London market
and made it a licensed Lloyds of London broker.</p>
<p>While Mr. Hatcher agreed that J&H's working relationship
with Willis Faber won't wind down immediately, he said he
believes there will now be a conflict of interest because
Willis Faber will be the owner of one of J&H's major U.S.
competitors.</p>
<p>For the time being, J&H plans to beef up existing London
operations by acquisitions of other small brokers and by
increasing staff there. Mr. Hatcher said J&H doesn't know
what it will do with its 5% stake in Willis Faber. The
British broker hasn't offered to buy back its shares, he
said.</p>
<p>Richard Miller, Corroon's chairman and chief executive
officer, noted that there might be some compensation for
Corroon shareholders because they will receive a 70% dividend
increase when the combined company begins a quarterly payout
early next year.</p>
<p>The two companies would be merged into a new entity,
Willis Corroon PLC. Faber holders would own 60% of Willis
Corroon, and Corroon holders the rest. Mr. Miller would be
chief executive of the new company and Faber's Mr. Elliott
would be chairman. Both men are 57 years old.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Elliott said there isn't any thought
of renegotiating the deal in light of the stock price drops.
"A deal is a deal, and the deal's been done," he said,
adding: "It's been approved by the boards of both companies."</p>
<p>Mr. Miller also said the two companies "signed a firm
contract" late Friday evening. "There will be no changes in
price."</p>
<p>Both Corroon and Faber officials said the combination of
the companies ideally meets their individual strategies.
There's no overlap between the two companies and the
combination of the two operations won't require any physical
mergers, officials said. Prior to the transaction, Willis was
the fifth largest broker world-wide and Corroon was No. 6.</p>
<p>Faber proposed a 10% increase in its dividend, to 13.2
pence a share, conditional on the Corroon deal going through.
Only Faber holders would get the first part of the payout --
9.9 pence a share payable in November. Holders of the
combined company would get a 3.3-pence-a-share dividend next
January.</p>
<p>Faber said that Willis Corroon would apply to the Big
Board to have its shares traded as American depositary
receipts. An application for listing on London's stock
exchange also would be sought.</p>
<p>In 1989, Faber earned #62.3 million pretax, up 15% from
#54.4 million in 1988. Corroon's net income fell 14% to $36
million last year. Corroon's earnings have declined during
the past two years because of the downturn in
property/casualty premium rates.</p>
