	<p class="article-leader">GORBACHEV MET with Roh in a step toward Soviet-South
Korean relations.
   Foreshadowing an adjustment of East Asian political and
economic ties, the Soviet leader and South Korean president
held talks in San Francisco and said their nations are moving
toward establishing diplomatic relations. It was the first
meeting between leaders of the two countries since 1948 and
came at the end of Gorbachev's five-day visit to the U.S. In
an address at Stanford University, he declared the Cold War
"behind us," and called for "new structures" in international
alliances. He also had a brief reunion with Reagan.</p>

Germany.</p>

<p>THE SUPREME COURT RULED that public schools must allow
religious clubs.</p>
<p>In an 8-1 decision, the justices said public schools
generally must give student religious groups the same access
to scheduling and facilities as other extracurricular
activities. The ruling in a case from Omaha, Neb., where
officials refused to permit a high school Bible-reading club,
upheld a 1984 federal law aimed at allowing religious
organizations in public schools. The court said the statute
doesn't violate the separation of church and state.</p>
<p>The court ruled that police undercover agents may seek to
elicit confessions from jailed criminal suspects without
first giving Miranda warnings.</p>

<p>Rebels in Liberia captured a strategic military checkpoint
near the international airport outside Monrovia, officials
said, and President Doe appealed for U.S. assistance as the
insurgents advanced upon the capital. Four U.S. warships,
meanwhile, arrived off the West African nation's coast to
help evacuate Americans and other foreigners.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Shamir defended the right of Soviet Jews to
live in Israeli-occupied lands, saying a democracy couldn't
limit where people live. His comments were in reaction to
Gorbachev's statement Sunday that the Kremlin might restrict
emigres to Israel if they continued to settle on land seized
in the 1967 Mideast war.</p>

<p>Police in China blocked roads to Beijing's university
area, and tight security elsewhere in the capital stifled
dissent on the first anniversary of the government's
crackdown on a pro-democracy movement. The public was barred
from Tiananmen Square, center of last year's protests, and a
few people trying to demonstrate were arrested.</p>

<p>A U.S. judge in Los Angeles ruled the county's supervisors
violated the constitutional rights of the area's large
Hispanic population when it drew voting boundaries in 1981.
The decision came in a 1988 suit that alleged the supervisors
illegally established boundaries to separate the Hispanic
community, diluting its voting strength.</p>

<p>Jury selection began in the cocaine-and-perjury trial of
Washington Mayor Barry. The official, 54, arrested Jan. 18 in
an FBI sting operation, has accused U.S. prosecutors of
pursuing him with the tactics of "a totalitarian kind of
society." Sources said plea bargain talks between Barry's
lawyers and the prosecutors were at an impasse.</p>

<p>NASA said the space shuttle Discovery sustained possible
damage when an overhead bridge in a hangar at Cape Canaveral,
Fla., snagged a payload door. Separately, space agency
technicans prepared to make a last-ditch attempt tomorrow to
find a fuel leak that caused last week's postponement of
Columbia's astronomy mission.</p>

<p>Mandela traveled to Botswana, beginning a foreign tour.
The black leader is to visit 13 nations, including the U.S.,
on his most extensive trip since being released from a South
African jail in February. In Johannesburg, the government
said it wouldn't force whites-only state schools to accept
black pupils, despite its pledge to end apartheid.</p>

<p>Japanese officials worked to avert the collapse of
Cambodian peace talks in Toyko. The discussions, aimed at
ending the 11-year conflict in the Southeast Asian country,
faltered after the leader of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla
faction failed to attend the negotiations between the Phnom
Penh government and a three-party insurgent alliance.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>More than a million mourners gathered at the tomb of
Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini to mark the first anniversary of
his death. Some of those at the Islamic shrine on the
outskirts of Tehran beat their chests in grief as
loudspeakers at the compound blared anti-U.S. and
anti-Israeli slogans.</p>

<p>The U.S. plans to begin destroying its stockpile of
chemical weapons late this year, well ahead of a treaty
signed Friday at the Bush-Gorbachev summit, officials in
Washington said. The destruction of the weapons, currently
stored in West Germany, would take place on a Pacific island.</p>
