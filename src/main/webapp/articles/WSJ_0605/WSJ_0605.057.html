	<p class="article-leader">THE AX FALLS FASTER than most expected on aerospace
workers.
   U.S.-Soviet detente and congressional budget-cutting
hasten pink slips for white-collar and hourly employees
alike. McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed, GE, General Dynamics and
some small firms disclose plans to trim rolls. The Aerospace
Industries Association tracks 16,000 job-cut notices among
its 54 members in 1990, 28% ahead of its forecast. "This may
just be the beginning," warns AIA economist David Napier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The passenger-plane business, once viewed as a cushion,
doesn't help much: Boeing isn't ramping up new programs, so
it's laying off, too, and McDonnell Douglas's commercial unit
flounders. Firms search for new niches to keep employment
stable, but changing course is tough.</p>
<p>"There will always be some growth areas," such as
electronics, says Karen Berk of the job-matching Aerospace
Human Resources Network.</p>
<p>HANDLING HAZARDS lessen for use of aircraft "composites."</p>
<p>As plane makers add more of the light, reinforced fibers
in their designs, they alert workers on how to better ply
toxic chemicals that strengthen and coat composites.</p>
<p>Worker complaints decline with increased industry concern,
better training and new cautionary signs posted in plants,
the Machinists union says. A third of the cost of Lockheed's
new Palmdale, Calif., composites center is for proper
ventilation and other health controls.</p>
<p>An Occupational Safety and Health Administration crackdown
last year at Boeing and Lockheed helped spur the effort. Now,
manufacturers push suppliers of advanced composites to set
specific exposure limits. "If we don't do it, they're not
going to buy from us," says David Forest, head of BASF
Structural Materials.</p>
<p>PEACETIME "CONVERSION" moves ahead at federal and state
levels.</p>
<p>House members prepare wording for the defense
authorization bill on the need to help defense workers brace
for the changeover. It would list worker qualifications for
relocation and other allowances when defense cuts hit. More
controversial ideas, such as requiring weapons makers to pay
for retraining and benefits, will be saved for floor debate.</p>
<p>"We want to make sure at least something gets on the
table," says Rep. Nick Mavroules (D., Mass.), a member of a
bipartisan House-Senate task force on the issue. California
mulls a worker-retraining program; in Minnesota, stung by big
layoffs by Unisys, Honeywell and other defense firms, a new
0.1% payroll tax raises worker aid. Over 40 aerospace firms
met in Dayton, Ohio, last week to share tips on switching to
non-military work.</p>
<p>One big challenge, says Ohio Gov. Celeste: meeting the
civilian sector's tougher delivery standards.</p>
<p>LOWER YOUR WAGE RATES, the Pentagon tells Lockheed, Boeing
and other companies. They must bring pay in line with other
firms in their areas, or the government says it will find
other sources. The Defense Contract Audit Agency contests
$222 million in "unreasonable" labor charges. Unions grouse
that contractors are exploiting the issue at the bargaining
table.</p>
<p>BLACK PROGRAMS, WHITE FACES: Asians, Hispanics and blacks
make up only 16% of workers in aerospace, with its often
secret, or "black," programs, lagging behind the overall
economy, the General Accounting Office finds. General
Dynamics's space division agrees to offer employment and
$270,000 in back wages to 21 minority engineers whom the
Labor Department says were wrongly denied jobs.</p>
<p>BRAIN DRAIN: Of 30 companies surveyed by the AIA,
two-thirds say they're short of scientists and engineers, and
85% expect such problems in the future. So firms do more to
support education, with 40% of corporate contributions going
for aid, such as scholarships.</p>
<p>OLD AEROSPACE WORKERS don't fade away -- they go back to
work.</p>
<p>More cost-conscious jet makers take back retirees, for
quick, complex assignments. "We know what they're capable
of," says Vince DeBlaze, human resources director at
McDonnell Douglas's jet-fighter factory in St. Louis, which
employs about 200 of its retirees. While fast-food firms hire
many retirees for low-skill work, "we've shown you can do it
with high-tech," says ACS Management Group Inc.</p>
<p>Bob Stein, a manager at Fairchild Controls, says a former
Hughes master scheduler he hired briefly for a new program to
build environmental controls for jet-fighter components "was
able to work faster and smarter -- and then press on."</p>
<p>ACS's Graybeard division, a job shop for former aerospace
technicians, has 2,300 resumes.</p>
<p>THE CHECKOFF: Machinists at Lockheed's
soon-to-be-shuttered, 62-year-old factory in Burbank, Calif.,
staged a rally last weekend to keep their jobs. . . . Boeing
says that for each job created outside the U.S. by its
"foreign sourcing," 20 domestic jobs are spawned. . . .
Northrop holds job fairs to recruit workers for its B-2
Stealth bomber project, saying, "You just might wind up
making history."</p>
