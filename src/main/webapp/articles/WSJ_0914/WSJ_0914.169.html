	<p class="article-leader">JUDGE SOUTER ACKNOWLEDGED an implicit constitutional right
to privacy.
   However, the Supreme Court nominee, on the first day of
his Senate confirmation hearings, declined requests to spell
out what that right encompasses. Responding to questions that
have been raised by Democratic senators and some liberal
groups, Souter attempted to depict himself as a humane,
compassionate judge. The hearing proceeded without rancor,
even though Souter generally refused to give his views on
Supreme Court decisions, including Roe vs. Wade, the 1973
ruling that recognized the right to abortion.</p>

<p>IRAN IS SEEKING to buy grain that the U.S. fears might be
sent to Baghdad.</p>

Argentina, there is concern that some of the shipments might
be transferred to Iraq on humanitarian grounds, despite an
international trade embargo. Meanwhile, Baker and
Shevardnadze discussed whether to propose new U.N. actions
that would tighten the embargo. In Baghdad, the Iraqis issued
what some considered a warning of terrorism against American
targets.</p>
<p>Japan pledged $2 billion in economic aid to Egypt, Turkey

<p>Researchers said they "permanently reversed" diabetes in
10 of 13 laboratory rats by transplanting insulin-producing
cells into the thymus gland of the animals. The novel
approach of using the thymus as the transplant site could
have promising implications for treating insulin-dependent
diabetes in humans.</p>

<p>Gorbachev told Baker that another superpower summit

<p>South African youths went on a rampage in a commuter train
in Johannesburg, hacking to death at least 26 people with
spears and machetes and injuring about 100 as passengers
leaped from the speeding coaches. Police gave no reason for
the attack.</p>

<p>A Tennessee court granted joint custody of seven frozen
embryos to a divorced couple. The Court of Appeals, an
intermediate-level court, overturned a landmark ruling that
had granted custody to the ex-wife. The embryos were created
in vitro at a fertility clinic in December 1988, two months
before the husband sued his wife for divorce.</p>

<p>A New York court overturned a ban on selling a book about

<p>West African troops evacuated 1,000 supporters of

<p>The nation's space program was dealt a major blow by a

all new funding for the Bush administration's Moon and Mars
initiative and cut $863.6 million from the space station's
fiscal 1991 budget.</p>

<p>Nineteen people were formally charged with treason and
murder in connection with the July coup attempt against
Trinidad's government. The alleged coup plotters, arraigned

<p>Sri Lankan troops broke Tamil rebels' three-month siege of
a strategic northern fort in a surprise attack that left 100
guerrillas and 12 soldiers dead, military officials said.
More than 350 soldiers took part in the pre-dawn assault on
the fort in Jaffna.</p>

<p>Michigan scientists are developing a technique for
inserting new genes into specific tissues in the body. In
experiments on pigs, the researchers inserted a new gene into
cells of an artery, and the genetically altered cells then
began producing a new protein. The technique could be helpful
in treating disease.</p>
