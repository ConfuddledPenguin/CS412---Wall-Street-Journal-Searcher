	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A federal grand jury indicted former Family
Savings & Loan Association Chairman Oliver A. Trigg, charging
him with defrauding the thrift in a complex scheme to take
control of Family using Family's own money.
   Mr. Trigg was charged with conspiracy, bank fraud, money
laundering, false statements and tax fraud. If convicted, he
faces a maximum of 94 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
Three others in the case face lesser charges.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to the indictment, Mr. Trigg, while he was
serving as chairman of the board but held no equity in the
thrift, arranged for Family to loan $2.5 million to a third
party to develop a real estate property. Then $1.24 million
of the money allegedly was laundered into Mr. Trigg's
personal bank account and used to buy 51% of Family. He also
allegedly lied about the transaction to federal regulators.</p>
<p>"The transactions involved in this case are prime examples
of the kind of fraud and self-dealing that appears in so many
of the troubled S&Ls around the country," said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Maurice A. Leiter, who is prosecuting the case.</p>
<p>Mr. Trigg attracted local media attention in August 1987
when he acquired control of the thrift, partly because with
assets of more than $140 million, Family was one of the
largest black-owned savings and loans in the nation.</p>
<p>But two months later, the Los Angeles Times published an
article which triggered an examination by regulators, who
called in the Federal Bureau of Investigation in early 1988.
Mr. Trigg resigned from Family a few months later.</p>
<p>Family is still in operation after Washington, D.C.-based
OFC Inc. acquired control in January. President Wayne-Kent
Bradshaw said the thrift expected to post a small operating
profit this year and was in compliance with all federal
regulations.</p>
<p>Mr. Trigg's attorney Arthur Barens said of the indictment,
"We don't believe that Mr. Trigg did anything inappropriate
or engaged in any conduct that resulted in any loss for
Family Savings & Loan."</p>
