	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- West Germany and the Soviet Union signed a 20-year
friendship treaty that forms the framework for broad West
German economic assistance for the shattered Soviet economy.
   Separately, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
confirmed that his government is giving Moscow an
interest-free loan of 3 billion German marks ($1.9 billion)
to cover the skyrocketing costs of maintaining whatever
Soviet troops remain in East Germany over the next four
years. The Soviets have agreed to pull all their troops out
of East Germany by 1994.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>West German officials see the loan, which is to be paid
out in installments, as a necessary part of the aid package.
Since July, when East Germany adopted the West German mark as
its own currency, Moscow has found it difficult to meet the
costs of keeping forces there.</p>
<p>The new loan comes on top of 12 billion marks that Bonn
has already agreed to pay directly to help cover the costs of
removing the troops from East German territory. In addition,
West Germany will pay one billion marks in interest costs on
the 3 billion-mark loan -- making the nation's direct
contribution to the pullout 13 billion marks.</p>
<p>"It's a considerable extra burden on the budget," Mr.
Waigel told reporters. However, he added, it "should be
viewed in the context of German unification."</p>
<p>Mr. Waigel also spelled out, for the first time, where the
12 billion-mark handout would go: 7.8 billion marks for the
construction of new housing in the Soviet Union for returning
forces; 3 billion marks for underwriting Soviet costs inside
East Germany; 1 billion marks for transporting the troops
home; and 200 million marks for retraining those Soviet
soldiers who will be put out of work.</p>
<p>While Bonn's financial inducements may have helped to ease
Soviet objections to German unity, the payments also
illustrate where West Germany is focusing its international
energies. "We view helping the Soviet economy as part of our
contribution to maintaining European stability," says one
West German Foreign Ministry official.</p>
<p>More important, though, is that the new links are
guaranteeing a unified Germany a front-row seat in any
economic revival of the Soviet Union. Indeed, a close look at
the new agreements between Bonn and Moscow shows that the
ultimate result is likely to be tight economic links of a
sort not seen since the days of the czars, when German
businessmen were active in most sectors of the Russian
economy.</p>
