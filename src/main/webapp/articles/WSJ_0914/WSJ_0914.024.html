	<p class="article-leader">MELVILLE, N.J. -- Chyron Corp., unable to secure new
financing, said it intends to file for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   The maker of electronic graphics and videotape and film
editing equipment said it is taking the action because it
can't repay $10 million in loans called yesterday by
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. The bank agreed to provide $9
million to Chyron as debtor-in-possession, however.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chyron hadn't made any loan payments since June 30 and was
seeking to restructure loans and obtain additional financing
from its banks.</p>
<p>But Manufacturers Hanover and Chyron's other major lender,
European American Bank, couldn't come to terms on sharing
loan collateral. Chyron owes $20 million to European
American.</p>
<p>The dispute stemmed from Chyron granting both banks in
1989 a security interest in its accounts receivable as a
condition for the company to pay a quarterly dividend.
European America said that it had first lien on the company's
receivables and that Manufacturers Hanover had the second
lien.</p>
<p>As result, Chyron said, Manufacturers Hanover filed suit
last week against European American, charging the bank with
fraud and breach of contract. Chyron also was named as a
defendant in the suit, but no relief is being sought against
Chyron, the company said.</p>
<p>Chyron had a net loss of $1.9 million on revenue of $44.1
million in 1989.</p>
