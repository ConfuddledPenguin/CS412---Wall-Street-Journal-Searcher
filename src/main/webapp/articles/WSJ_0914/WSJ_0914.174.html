	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Grain futures prices went into an expected nose
dive as markets adjusted to the Agriculture Department's
prediction of record corn and wheat crops this year.
   But prices of corn and wheat futures stabilized in late
trading, supported by the strength of soybean prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The contract for December corn delivery settled at $2.2575
a bushel, down 8 1/2 cents, after flirting with its daily
limit of 10 cents down. The December wheat contract settled
at $2.765, down 6 1/2 cents.</p>
<p>November soybeans rallied at the close, finishing down 7
1/4 cents at $6.34 a bushel after trading as much as 13 cents
down. Strong demand for soybean products and relatively low
world production are exerting upward pressure on soybean
futures prices.</p>
<p>Most analysts, however, predicted continuing deterioration
of wheat and corn prices. Some think corn will drop as low as
$2.05 a bushel in the near future. "It's going to be a slow
grind, but we're probably going down," said Pat O'Connell,
senior grain analyst for Refco Inc. in Chicago.</p>
<p>Prices of corn futures contracts have declined by about 75
cents a bushel since July 4, when they hovered around $3. A
wet spring forced many farmers to delay planting corn, and
fears that the delay could reduce yields drove prices higher
in June. But remarkably good weather during July and August
reversed the price movement.</p>
<p>"This June and July produced the most ideal growing
conditions that I can recall during those months," said Terry
Francl, economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation.</p>
<p>The resulting price declines are as troubling for the
government as they are for farmers. Corn growers enrolled in
government farm programs will be able to make up for some of
the decline in selling prices through increased government
subsidies, meaning that government's costs will rise. In a
symbolic response to the corn sell-off yesterday, Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced that all Agriculture
Department vehicles will begin to burn fuel containing
ethanol, which is refined from corn.</p>
<p>Analysts said the department's crop estimates, contained
in a report released Wednesday, put pressure on the Bush
administration to try to prop up wheat prices. A bill
approved Tuesday by the Senate would require farmers to idle
15% of their wheat acreage in 1991, and similar legislation
is pending the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>But short of extending credit to the Soviet Union for
additional purchases, the government has few options for
stopping the decline in corn prices. "I don't think there's
much the government can do," Mr. O'Connell said. "It's just
going to have to get cheap enough that people will step in
and buy the crop."</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>ENERGY: Crude oil prices rose modestly in increased
afternoon trading after moving listlessly in a narrow range
in the morning. Petroleum products were mixed, with gasoline
weakening slightly and heating oil rising. Traders generally
blamed the market's lack of spirit on a shortage of
attention-grabbing headlines related to the Middle East
crisis. Even a report that Iraq was warning of possible
terrorism against U.S. targets didn't stimulate buying for
long. October crude settled on the New York Mercantile
Exchange at $31.87 a barrel, up 10 cents. Gasoline ended at
93.36 cents per gallon, down 0.48 cents. The decline was
attributed to Energy Department data that showed a 1.8
million-barrel rise in gasoline inventories last week, a
bigger rise than reported recently by the American Petroleum
Institute. Heating oil finished at 83.48 cents a gallon, up
0.89 cents, following strong European prices.</p>
<p>ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices fell for the second
consecutive day. The November contract declined 2.45 cents a
pound to $1.3475. That contract dropped 2.60 cents Wednesday,
making a two-day loss of 5.05 cents. Judith Ganes, analyst
for Merrill Lynch, said selling was prompted by an
Agriculture Department survey released Tuesday that showed
that, despite the damaging frost in Florida last Christmas,
land planted with orange trees rose to 564,809 acres from
537,000 acres in 1988. There also was a 15% increase in the
number of trees, according to the report. "The report
apparently wasn't widely circulated outside the industry,"
Ms. Ganes said. "But apparently enough traders heard about it
so that it triggered selling based on the perception that an
increase in orange-bearing acreage and higher tree population
could result in an increased output of orange juice."</p>
<p>COPPER: Prices fell on expectations of an increase in
supplies. The September contract declined 3.10 cents a pound
to $1.3280, while December, the most active contract, was off
1.80 cents to $1.2695. The September price's premium over
December's thus narrowed by 1.30 cents to stand at 5.85
cents. The cash contract's premium over the three-month
futures contract on the London Metal Exchange also narrowed.
Selling was triggered by predictions that supplies of copper
in LME warehouses will increase this week by 10,000 to 20,000
tons, analysts said; the supply report is due today. On the
Commodity Exchange in New York, the decline in the December
contract was accelerated when the price dropped below $1.27 a
pound. However, it stabilized at $1.2625 and recovered
slightly toward the close. Yesterday's setback doesn't change
the general perception that there is a tightness of
immediately available supplies of copper, one analyst said.</p>
