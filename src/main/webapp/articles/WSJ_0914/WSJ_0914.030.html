	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Canadian Pacific Ltd. said it may buy back as
many as 9.9% of its shares outstanding, which have fallen
steeply in price this year.
   The holding company with interests in transportation,
telecommunications, hotels, energy and natural resources
filed for regulatory clearance to purchase as many as 31.5
million shares on Canadian stock exchanges in a 12-month
period that will begin Tuesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Canadian companies often make such filings on a
contingency basis and renew them each year without actually
buying many shares. But a spokesman for Canadian Pacific said
its filing wasn't a renewal and represented a belief that the
shares are attractively priced.</p>
<p>Canadian Pacific closed yesterday at $15.75 a share, up
12.5 cents, on New York Stock Exchange composite volume of
1.6 million shares.</p>
<p>The company's shares have fallen about 35% on the Toronto
Stock Exchange since last October, while the exchange's
bellwether index of 300 stocks has fallen only about 11%. Its
profit has followed a similar course. First-half net income
was down 34% to 177.8 million Canadian dollars (US$152.9
million) from C$270.4 million a year earlier, mostly because
of a drop in earnings at its 80%-owned Canadian Pacific
Forest Products Ltd.</p>
<p>Analyst Michael Graham of Midland Walwyn Capital Inc. said
a stock buy-back would be a sound move. Canadian Pacific's
shares had a book value of C$24.46 each at the end of last
year, and Mr. Graham estimates their real net asset value at
C$40 to C$50 because of undervalued real estate assets. The
forest-products subsidiary's problems result from a slump in
demand affecting companies all across the industry.</p>
