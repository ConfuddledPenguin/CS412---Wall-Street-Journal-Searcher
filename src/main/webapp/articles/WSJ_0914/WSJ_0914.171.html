	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Budget talks continued for the seventh
consecutive day at Andrews Air Force Base near here with few
hints of a breakthrough on crucial remaining issues, such as
President Bush's proposal to cut capital-gains taxes.
   White House officials indicated they expect the talks to
continue into the weekend. Congressional and administration
negotiators, who met until about 1 a.m. Thursday, divided
into two groups when the talks resumed yesterday to discuss
taxes and ways to enforce a five-year deficit-reduction pact.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We still have got a big gap," Rep. Silvio Conte (R.,
Mass.), one of the negotiators, said yesterday afternoon.
Still, most of those close to the talks remained confident an
accord eventually will be reached, if only because the
economic and political stakes are so high.</p>
<p>The outlines of a possible compromise on taxes are
becoming apparent as similar proposals to tax luxury goods,
increase taxes on alcoholic beverages and raise energy taxes
appear in offers made by both Democrats and Republicans in
the closed-door talks. Analyses of each side's plans showed
that the Republicans' proposal would go easier on rich people
than would the Democrats' proposal.</p>
<p>People close to the talks indicated yesterday that an
increase in the cigarette tax -- currently 16 cents a pack --
is also likely to be supported by both sides.</p>
<p>On spending, both sides have proposed making Medicare
beneficiaries pay more for their health insurance, but
negotiators have scaled back a plan to increase premiums for
upper-income Americans in the face of strong criticism,
people close to the talks said.</p>
<p>On cutting capital-gains taxes, about the only agreement
is that the tax cut would cost the Treasury billions. GOP
negotiators Wednesday acquiesced to figures of the bipartisan
Joint Committee on Taxation showing that the Republican
capital-gains proposal would mean $24.5 billion less in
revenue over five years, according to Rep. Bill Archer (R.,
Texas). Previously, the Republicans said the tax cut would
essentially break even over five years.</p>
<p>To offset that loss, the administration proposed
increasing levies on luxury goods, ozone-depleting chemicals
and some petroleum-based products, and indexing certain
excise taxes for inflation -- all ideas that have at least
some acceptance among the Democrats.</p>
<p>The administration proposal would cut the capital-gains
tax, now as high as 33%, to a maximum rate of 15%. The cut
would only apply to individuals. The administration's
previous proposal called for a top rate of 19.6% for assets
sold after three years. Republicans continue to resist the
Democrats' demand that any cut in capital-gains taxes be
accompanied by an increase in income-tax rates for
upper-income Americans.</p>
<p>Analyses of the competing tax packages by the Joint Tax
Committee show that the Republican plan would reduce the
burden on taxpayers with incomes above $50,000 and increase
it on those with incomes below that. The dividing line in the
Democratic tax package is $20,000.</p>
<p>The contrasts are particularly sharp for upper-income
Americans because Republicans are pressing the cut in
capital-gains taxes while Democrats would impose a new
surcharge on the richest Americans. For taxpayers earning
more than $200,000 a year, the Joint Tax Committee analysis
shows, the GOP plan would cut taxes by 5.5% while the
Democratic plan would increase them by 6.7%.</p>
<p>Both sides are now supporting a new 10% tax on luxury
goods, although they define luxuries slightly differently.
Both parties would tax electronic goods above $1,000, jewelry
above $5,000 and furs above $500. For autos, the Democrats'
tax would kick in above $25,000, the Republicans' above
$30,000. Republicans have a $30,000 threshold for yachts
while the Democrats proposed $50,000. Democrats would also
tax the entire cost of private planes, while Republicans
would exempt them. Aircraft makers Cessna and Beech are based
in Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole's home state of
Kansas.</p>
<p>The Democrats' version would raise $1.3 billion the first
year and $10.2 billion over five years while the Republican
plan would raise about $900 million in 1991 and $7.8 billion
through 1995.</p>
<p>On "sin" taxes, Democrats want to double the levies on
beer and wine, and index the taxes for inflation as of 1992.
That would raise $1.5 billion in 1991 and $8.3 billion
through 1995. An increase of $2 a proof gallon in the tax on
liquor, currently $12.50 a proof gallon, would raise another
$400 million the first year and $2 billion over five years. A
proof gallon is the equivalent of 100-proof liquor, or 50%
alcohol.</p>
<p>Republicans would more than double beer and wine taxes,
which haven't been increased since 1951. But they wouldn't
change the taxes on hard liquor, last raised in 1984.</p>
<p>Despite initial speculation that the Mideast crisis would
doom any new energy taxes, a broad-based tax remains a
possibility, both to raise revenue and to encourage
conservation.</p>
<p>Democrats propose to tax all sources of energy roughly
based on their costs at a rate of 4%, raising an estimated
$7.8 billion the first year and $58.4 billion over five
years. While Republicans are said to be considering some form
of energy tax, their formal proposal has been limited to a
one-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline and other refined petroleum
products, excluding feedstocks.</p>
<p>The Democrats want a seven-cent increase in the
nine-cent-a-gallon federal gasoline tax, which would raise
$5.4 billion the first year and $33.2 billion over five
years. The Democrats' broad-based energy tax would add about
four cents a gallon more to the cost of gasoline at the pump.</p>
<p>Both sides would increase the airline ticket tax, and they
appear to be moving toward raising taxes on life insurance
companies by about $1 billion in the first year, and about $7
billion over five years.</p>
<p>Two ideas common to both parties' plans would each raise
about $100 million a year. One would extend the
0.1-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax that flows into a trust fund
to clean up leaking underground storage tanks at filling
stations. Another would raise levies on ozone-depleting
chemicals.</p>
