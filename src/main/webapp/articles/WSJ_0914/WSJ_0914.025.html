	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Department of Health and Human Services
said it will contact more than one million employers in a
program to collect as much as $600 million in Medicare
payments that were improperly paid to people covered by
private health insurance.
   Congress authorized the effort last year after this
newspaper disclosed that Medicare had paid billions of
dollars in health-insurance claims that should have been paid
by private insurance companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The money was paid to working people over 65 and people
over 65 who were covered by a working spouse's employer group
health plan. In such cases, bills are supposed to be
submitted to private insurance companies first, with Medicare
picking up any qualified uncovered charges. Instead, the HHS
inspector general found that many of these claims went
directly to Medicare because corporations and their insurers
didn't funnel them to private companies first.</p>
<p>Congress authorized the Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs Medicare, to work with the Social
Security Administration and the Internal Revenue Service to
set up an extensive computer matching program to trace the
employment of Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<p>In addition, the HCFA has hired Group Health Inc. of New
York to contact more than one million employers to determine
if Medicare beneficiaries and their spouses were covered by
private plans that should have paid their bills. This effort
will start by the end of the year. Under the law passed last
year, companies will face a $1,000 fine for each such request
for information they fail to answer within 30 days.</p>
<p>"The 1989 legislation provides us with important new tools
to identify cases in which Medicare can recover payments that
should have been made by other parties," said HCFA Director
Gail Wilensky.</p>
<p>In addition to the collection program, which could bring
in as much as $600 million, the Justice Department has filed
suits against several major insurance companies to recover
funds. It is also in the process of launching a program to
alert both employers and insurers to the risks they face by
circumventing the Medicare payment rules.</p>
