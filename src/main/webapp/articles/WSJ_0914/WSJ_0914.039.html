	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- When deputies from the Group of Seven gathered
in Paris this week, they reportedly expressed little dismay
about the falling U.S. dollar.
   Economists predict that the mood of acceptance will extend
to the official G-7 meeting in Washington a week from
tomorrow. Specifically, forecasters expect financial leaders
to stand by rather than intervene in the currency markets,
even though the U.S. currency recently slumped to 1.53 German
marks, a postwar low. "We're not looking for the G-7 to do
anything at this stage," said Julian Callow, international
economist with Chase Investment Bank Ltd.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The G-7 countries are the U.S., Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada.</p>
<p>Mr. Callow and other Chase economists take the position
that the G-7, officially the world's most powerful economic
club, is in "demise," with each of the big economies going
its own way for a time. The Chase team also predicts that the
dollar will test new lows of 1.50 marks and 125 yen in the
next three to six months.</p>
<p>"My feeling is that the economic fundamentals would
indicate that the dollar should fall," said Bill Martin,
chief economist at UBS Phillips & Drew in London. "It looks
like the U.S. economy is moving into recession and that the
Fed will ease" up by dropping interest rates.</p>
<p>European economists aren't very worried about the dollar's
slide. "There's no reason for action now," said Adolf
Ahnefeld, corporate economist at Bosch G.m.b.H. "The present
value of the dollar is about right."</p>
<p>With the American economy edging toward recession,
Europeans are cheered to see a glimmer of good news in the
export picture. "European firms will mostly benefit from
stronger U.S. economic activity," said Sudhir Junankar,
economist with the Confederation of British Industries in
London. "Higher exports make the U.S. less prone to full
recession, and that's good news."</p>
<p>But if the dollar stays low, Europe could find itself
inundated with comparatively cheap American products, warned
David Mars, an economist with S.G. Warburg Securities in
London. "The U.S. exports everything from vegetables to jumbo
jets," he argued. "There's a tendency (in Europe) to
underestimate the competitive pressure." He said he foresees
a day when U.S. exports could force price cuts in Europe, and
lead to calls for the G-7 to prop up the U.S. currency.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the U.S. will be forced to
keep rates higher than its sluggish economy would otherwise
dictate, in order to compete for international savings it
needs to finance its budget deficit. That could make it
harder for the U.S. to jump-start its economy out of the
current slump. However, the Chase report warned, "other G-7
members aren't likely to be prepared to `bail out' the U.S.
by inflating."</p>
