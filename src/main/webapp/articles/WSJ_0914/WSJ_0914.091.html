	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A little-noticed provision of the housing
bill would create the first housing entitlement program, one
requiring rental subsidies to families whose children are
threatened with foster care because of inadequate housing.
   The program, authored by Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.),
is aimed at keeping families from splitting because of
deficient housing. Though deficit pressures and cost concerns
could darken the plan's prospects, the proposal has some
bipartisan support. The initiative would require about $1
billion in budget authority over five years, according to
Congressional Budget Office estimates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Schumer said an entitlement, which makes a specific
amount of funding automatically available each year, was
necessary because "otherwise these kids will be forgotten.
There is such a shortage of housing dollars and such a fight
over them."</p>
<p>Both the House and the Senate have passed legislation that
would overhaul federal housing programs. But it is unclear
whether the entitlement provision, which isn't included in
the Senate version, will survive when the legislation goes
into conference.</p>
