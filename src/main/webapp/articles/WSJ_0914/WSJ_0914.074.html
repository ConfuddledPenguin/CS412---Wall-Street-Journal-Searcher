	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Almost 13,000 employees at Ford Motor Co.'s
Canadian subsidiary were slated to strike at midnight, as
time appeared to be running out for a new contract
settlement.
   Officials of the Canadian Auto Workers union were
continuing to meet with Ford officials last night, but union
insiders asserted that there wasn't any chance a new contract
could be put together before the strike deadline. A Ford
spokesman was more upbeat, but said reaching any agreement at
this point would require "damn hard work."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A walkout by Ford's Canadian employees would idle nine of
the company's plants in Canada. It also could hurt important
Ford operations in the U.S., which depend on parts
manufactured in Canada. Ford officials predict a shortage of
engines and auto glass from Canada would result in several
U.S. operations closing within two weeks of a strike.</p>
<p>The union began contract negotiations last week after
selecting Ford as a strike target. Under the usual system of
pattern bargaining, any contract reached at Ford will serve
as the basis for subsequent negotiations with the Canadian
subsidiaries of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.
Current contracts at each of the Big Three auto makers, which
cover a total of 61,000 employees in Canada, expire today.</p>
<p>Ford has made just one contract offer since the talks
began. That offer, covering such economic issues as wages,
vacations and cost-of-living allowances, was swiftly rejected
by the union, which contended that the company wasn't
offering nearly enough money. Even if Ford should return
before the strike deadline with a mutually acceptable package
of economic terms, there remain such time-consuming issues to
be resolved as health and safety in the plants and medical
benefits.</p>
<p>A Canadian strike would hit some of Ford's most profitable
model lines. The company's St. Thomas, Ontario, plant is the
sole source for the large Mercury Grand Marquis and Ford
Crown Victoria models.</p>
<p>Ford's Windsor, Ontario, engine plant builds the
six-cylinder unit for the Lincoln Continental luxury car. A
lengthy shutdown could hobble operations at the highly
profitable Wixom, Mich., plant that builds the Continental,
as well as the Lincoln Town Car and Lincoln Mark VII. The
Windsor plant also builds many of the engines for Ford's
U.S.-built Taurus and Sable midsized cars.</p>
<p>Another Ford plant, in Niagara Falls, Ontario, is the sole
provider of auto glass to four of the company's light-truck
assembly operations in the U.S. A total of about 80% of
Ford's Canadian output is exported to the U.S.</p>
