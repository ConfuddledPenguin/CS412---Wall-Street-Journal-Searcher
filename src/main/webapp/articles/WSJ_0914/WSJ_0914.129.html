	<p class="article-leader">RTZ Corp. of Britain, a major mining and minerals company,
said first-half profit attributable to shareholders, after
taxes and minority interests, fell 3.6% to #269 million
($500.3 million) from #279 million a year earlier, because of
lower metals prices.
   Earnings per share fell 14% to 27.3 pence from 31.7 pence.
The performance decline came despite a 38% reduction in RTZ's
first-half tax payments, depressed this year by lower
earnings contributions from several highly taxed, partly
owned companies, and accentuated a year earlier by interim
arrangements for the acquisition of British Petroleum Co.'s
mineral assets. Pretax profit dropped 23% to #475 million
from #617 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales declined 19% to #2.66 billion from #3.28 billion.</p>
<p>RTZ said it will increase the interim dividend 20% to six
pence a share from five pence.</p>
