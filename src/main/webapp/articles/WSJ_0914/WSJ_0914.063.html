	<p class="article-leader">Where would you invest $100,000 in these troubled times?
   Let's ask a few investment professionals who have won the
respect of their fellow money managers and investment
strategists. Where's the best place to put the dough,
assuming that it is fresh cash and that the $100,000 won't be
needed for a few years?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As might be expected, many of the pros suggest that
investors go lighter than usual on stocks. But none would
avoid the stock market, which is down 13% from mid-July. Even
the most bearish of the bunch would put $25,000 into stocks.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of where nine pros would advise an
individual to invest $100,000 today. The pros aren't
infallible, of course. Some of them missed the mark in a
similar survey last December by praising growth stocks and
scoffing at recession fears.</p>
<p>NED DAVIS would put half the money, or $50,000, into
stocks. A Nakomis, Fla., investment adviser who is widely
followed by other pros, Mr. Davis would funnel $30,000 of the
rest into 10-year Treasury notes and $20,000 into Treasury
bills.</p>
<p>In Mr. Davis's view, stock prices already reflect most of
the bad news about the Mideast conflict, the U.S. budget
deficit and the thrift crisis: "The data indicates that we're
not falling off a cliff."</p>
<p>Small investors should quit worrying so much about Iraq,
he says. Wars are "stimulative to the economy and the stock
market . . . You can go back and look at how the market has
reacted to every international crisis since the fall of
France, and in three-quarters of the cases, stocks do better
after the crisis."</p>
<p>Mr. Davis is a "market timer," using hundreds of economic
and technical market indicators to discern when to jump in or
out of the stock market. Although stocks hit a bottom Aug.
23, he isn't convinced that a strong upturn is under way.
"Major bull markets need a sold-out condition, deep pessimism
and an accommodative Federal Reserve before they begin," he
says. And stocks now are "reasonably priced."</p>
<p>JOHN M. TEMPLETON, 77-year-old chairman of the Templeton
Group of Mutual Funds, would put $75,000 into stocks.</p>
<p>"If you wait until there are no problems, you will never
make an investment," he says from his Bahamas home. "The wise
time to buy shares is at the point of maximum worry. That is
the time you get shares at bargain prices."</p>
<p>Mr. Templeton suggests putting the $75,000 into
small-company stocks with rapidly growing earnings in the
U.S., United Kingdom and Canada. "Emerging growth stocks
haven't been popular for seven years, so this is where the
bargains are," he says. He would put the other $25,000 into
long-term U.S. government bonds.</p>
<p>The Iraq crisis is probably fully reflected in stock
prices, Mr. Templeton says. Since World War II, "we have had
eight bear markets, seven recessions, wars, inflation and
many more severe political problems than this Kuwait matter."</p>
<p>MARSHALL FRONT -- "Hysteria has swept Wall Street," says
the executive vice president at Stein Roe & Farnum Inc.,
Chicago, which manages $20 billion. "Strong companies are
being thrown out of portfolios willy-nilly. We'll look back
on this as an awfully good buying opportunity in two or three
years."</p>
<p>Historically, when pessimism reigns, it has been a good
time to begin accumulating quality stocks that have been
beaten down, he says. Mr. Front would put $50,000 into such
stocks as Motorola, Fluor, Waste Management, General Electric
and Procter & Gamble.</p>
<p>"While it's hard to gauge how long the decline will last,
the world is not going to come to an end," he says. Many
companies will have good earnings in a modest recession. "You
hear horror stories about bank failures, $50-a-barrel oil
prices . . . all these things are being magnified in
importance. And investors are jumping to the worst
conclusions."</p>
<p>Mr. Front would put $25,000 in short-term government
bonds. Another $25,000 would go into a money market fund as a
reserve for future stock purchases "on a further market dip
or if the Mideast crisis is resolved."</p>
<p>MICHAEL METZ -- The chief investment strategist at
Oppenheimer & Co. believes it would be a mistake to invest
the $100,000 portfolio at one time. He would move in phases.
First, he would put $25,000 into intermediate-term government
bonds and $25,000 into publicly traded German, French and
Italian stock funds, specifically the funds trading at the
biggest discounts to their portfolio value.</p>
<p>He would put the rest in a money market fund. After three
months he would invest $25,000 in small-stock closed-end
funds, perhaps doubling this investment six months later. His
goal: "a diversified collection of bargains."</p>
<p>If war breaks out in the Middle East, Mr. Metz suggests
that investors buy stocks "at that crack in the market. You
have to go contrary to sentiment," he says. "When you feel
like throwing up, it's time to buy."</p>
<p>CHARLES CLOUGH -- The chief investment strategist at
Merrill Lynch & Co. would put $45,000 in "utilities, health
care, natural gas and technology stocks," avoiding the big
consumer stocks such as Walt Disney and Wal-Mart Stores. He
would also put $45,000 in 10- to 15-year government bonds,
and the rest in a money market fund.</p>
<p>Stocks will have a difficult year, Mr. Clough says. But
some of the downside has been alleviated with the recent
slump in prices.</p>
<p>STEVEN LEUTHOLD -- A number of pros are sharply
underweighting their usual stock positions. One of them is
Mr. Leuthold, president of Leuthold Group, a Minneapolis
company that provides research for institutional investors.
He would put only $30,000 into stocks because of concern
about the weakening dollar and the huge U.S. debt.</p>
<p>"The market has another 10% to 15% farther to fall," Mr.
Leuthold says. He would spend the $30,000 on stocks with a
heavy emphasis on pollution control, and battered growth
stocks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he would invest $50,000 in bonds, with $40,000
split between intermediate and long-term U.S. government
bonds and $10,000 in West German bonds. He likes the West
German bonds because they offer an "unusually high" 9%
interest rate and give some protection against a weakening
U.S. dollar. He would put the final $20,000 into a money
market fund to use when stock prices decline further.</p>
<p>LARRY BIEHL -- Interest rates are headed downward,
according to Mr. Biehl, a partner in the San Mateo, Calif.,
money management firm of Bailard, Biehl & Kaiser. Hence, he
suggests investing $50,000 in 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds.
"If you are a fear person or an opportunist, the long bond is
where you'll make your money," he says. The 30-year U.S. bond
now yields more than 8.9%.</p>
<p>Mr. Biehl says the U.S. is in a "slowdown/recession" that
could drag on for 12 to 18 months. He says investors can sit
out the recession with a "decent yield" as they wait for the
economy to revive.</p>
<p>Because he expects corporate earnings to continue to erode
in the recession, he would put only $15,000 in drug shares
and other recession-resistant U.S. stocks, $10,000 in
international stocks, $10,000 in real estate trusts and
$15,000 in a money market fund.</p>
<p>MARY FARRELL -- Several pros advise that individuals buy
blue-chip stocks, many of which have been beaten down in the
sell-off. "This may not be the bottom but these are good
prices for good growth companies," says Mary Farrell,
investment strategist at PaineWebber Inc.</p>
<p>In this vein, another pro, Mr. Davis, suggests Boeing,
International Business Machines, GE, Coca-Cola Co. and
PepsiCo, all multinational companies that can take advantage
of the weak U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>ARNOLD KAUFMAN -- The editor of Standard & Poor's Outlook,
says: "This is no time to be a hero." He would put $40,000 of
the portfolio into two- to 10-year Treasury notes yielding
between 8% and 9%. And he would funnel only $25,000 into
stocks now.</p>

<p>                 Pros' Choices Differ</p>
<p>                                                                                                    

 There's a wide range in how investment professionals would
allocate $100,000 these days:</p>
<p>  Stocks                      $25,000 to $75,000</p>
<p>  Bonds                       $25,000 to $50,000</p>
<p>  Treasury Bills              $0 to $30,000</p>
<p>  Real Estate                 $0 to $10,000</p>
<p>  Gold/Precious Metals        Zero</p>
