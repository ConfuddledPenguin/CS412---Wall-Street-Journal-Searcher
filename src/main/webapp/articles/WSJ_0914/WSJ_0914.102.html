	<p class="article-leader">My colleagues and I are accustomed to seeing attacks by
Nina Shea on Americas Watch. Accordingly, her Aug. 24
Americas column, "Uncovering the Awful Truth of Nicaragua's
Killing Fields," came as no surprise. Nevertheless, because
it distorts the record it requires a response.
   Americas Watch was founded in 1981 and published its first
report on Nicaragua in May 1982. In that report, we discussed
a massacre by Sandinista troops of Miskito Indians at Leimus.
So far as I know, that was the first time that episode, which
took place five months earlier, was reported internationally.
In subsequent reports we chronicled many additional violent
abuses by Sandinista troops and security forces: killings,
disappearances, torture. At the same time, we distinguished
between abuses that we found to be a matter of policy by the
Sandinistas, such as forced relocations and abusive
interrogation practices, and more violent abuses, which were
more sporadic.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ms. Shea says we ignored abuses reported by refugees, but
then, contradictorily, notes that we retraced the steps taken
by her group to interview them. What she leaves out is that,
in May 1987, after we also conducted on-site investigations
in Nicaragua, I sent a public letter to President Daniel
Ortega providing far more detailed information on Sandinista
abuses than Ms. Shea's group had reported. In just one of the
episodes discussed in my 17-page letter, we reported up to 50
killings by Sandinista troops and provided 23 names. That
letter was reproduced in a report we published in May 1987.
Thereafter, we published several additional reports in 1988
and 1989 in which we said that killings of Contra supporters
that we had uncovered during those years amounted to a
pattern, or a policy of such killings.</p>
