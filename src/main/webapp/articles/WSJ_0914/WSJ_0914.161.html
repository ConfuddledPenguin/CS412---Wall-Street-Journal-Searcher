	<p class="article-leader">J.M. Peters Co., a Southern California home builder,
posted a $451,000 loss for its fiscal second quarter, ended
Aug. 31.
   The loss, equal to three cents a share, compares with a
year-ago profit of $3.5 million, or 25 cents a share. Revenue
fell 9.6% to $52.7 million from $58.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Newport Beach, Calif., company said its results are
reflective of "the continued downturn in sales" for
single-family "move-up" housing in most areas of Southern
California. The company builds homes for the "move-up"
market, which is upper-income buyers who have previously
owned a principal residence.</p>
<p>For the six months, the company had net income of $1.1
million, or eight cents a share, compared with profit of $8.5
million, or 61 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue increased
5.2% to $121.9 million from $115.8 million.</p>
