Bank of Japan, the central bank, accepted advisory positions
at a Japanese bank and a British securities house.

adviser, and Kleinwort Benson Group PLC said it will hire him
as a non-executive director.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Japan, it is common practice for retired senior
government officials to join institutions or companies in
fields related to their bureaucratic careers. The practice is
known as "descent from heaven."</p>
<p>Gregory A. Shenkman, managing director and general manager
of Kleinwort Benson's Tokyo office, said Mr. Ohta's hiring
"will bring us some very valuable access within Japan."</p>
<p>Mr. Ohta said that he wasn't sure what role he will play
at the two companies, but that he hopes he can put his
experience as the Japanese central bank's top international
official to use.</p>
