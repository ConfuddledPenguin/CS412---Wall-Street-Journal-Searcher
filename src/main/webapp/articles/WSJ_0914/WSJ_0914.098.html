	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Perceptions that problems in the banking
industry are deteriorating prompted investors to pour more
cash into short-term Treasury bills and notes. The buying
binge helped short-term Treasurys outperform the broader bond
market.
   "Whenever you hear about problems in the banking system,
that tends to help the bill market," said Sung Won Sohn, a
senior vice president and chief economist at Norwest Corp.,
Minneapolis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bond dealers said investors were liquidating various bank
deposits and bank-issued securities and investing the
proceeds in three-month and six-month Treasury bills and, to
a smaller extent, two-year Treasury notes. These securities
are considered the safest in the world and tend to be in big
demand when there are signs of economic or political trouble.</p>
<p>Traders said investors have been purchasing larger amounts
of bills for several months, but the buying seemed to pick up
modestly yesterday as a result of a number of recent reports
about the poor health of the banking industry. And because
the market was so thinly traded yesterday, some dealers said
the Treasury bill purchases may have appeared more sizable
than they really were.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the Congressional Budget Office told the
Senate Banking Committee that it expects 600 to 700 banks
failures to occur by 1993. On Tuesday, one of the nation's
biggest banks, Chase Manhattan Corp., was forced to reset the
rate on $200 million of auction-rate notes to 13.017% from
9.66%. The new high rate is considered a sign that investors
are leery of owning securities issued by bank holding
companies.</p>
<p>Many analysts have said the banking industry isn't as bad
off as the CBO report or the Chase Manhattan auction results
would seem to suggest. Moreover, Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan told Congress yesterday that banking isn't
headed for a disaster on the scale of the savings-and-loan
crisis. But investors apparently aren't taking any chances.</p>
<p>"We've been seeing investors who have moved out of {bank
issued} commercial paper and {certificates of deposit} and
into Treasury bills," for months, said William Brachfeld,
manager of trading at Daiwa Securities America Inc. However,
Mr. Brachfeld said the Chase Manhattan reset note auction
cast a new spotlight on the problems of the industry.</p>
<p>He said that huge amounts of money aren't flowing out of
the banks into the bond market. But, "even if you just have
10% of money shifting from one place to another place, it can
have a profound impact on the market," he said.</p>
<p>The "safe-haven" buying of short-term securities widened
the gap between the Treasury's two-year note and the
benchmark 30-year bond to .96 percentage point from .92
percentage point on Wednesday. The Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond ended slightly lower while the yield rose to
8.96% from 8.94%. Prices of two-year notes ended slightly
higher to yield 7.999%.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>The junk bond market, weary after three days of heavy
selling by the Resolution Trust Corp., fell yesterday as
tumbling stock prices helped accelerate the market's decline.</p>
<p>According to Elizabeth Specter, director of the Resolution
Trust Corp.'s division of finance and administration, the RTC
had been selling about $150 million of junk bonds a week
prior to the Persian Gulf crisis and now is getting back up
to that level of sales.</p>
<p>In an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee
yesterday, Ms. Specter also presented Congress with
statistics showing that the thrift bailout agency sold $550
million of junk bonds to date. As of July 31, the RTC's junk
bond holdings stood at $3.7 billion.</p>
<p>The high-yield market had been hit by selling pressure all
this week after the RTC, the federal agency set up to
liquidate the holdings of the nation's crippled thrifts, sold
about $100 million in junk bonds.</p>
<p>In trading yesterday, junk bonds ended between 3/8 to 1/2
point lower in light trading.</p>
<p>Among the biggest losers of the day were pay-in-kind bonds
of RJR Nabisco Inc., which pay interest in the form of
additional bonds instead of cash.</p>
<p>Since the bonds are widely held by equity investors, they
tend to plunge whenever the equity market registers sharp
losses.</p>
<p>RJR Nabisco's 17.375% convertible pay-in-kind debentures,
due in 2009, finished down 1 3/8 points at 110 3/8 on the New
York Stock Exchange. The other widely held RJR issue, the 17%
exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, ended
1 1/2 points lower at 86 7/8.</p>
<p>The recently depressed junk bonds of Burlington Holdings
Inc. were hit again yesterday. Burlington's 14.25%
subordinated debentures, due in 1999, shed four points to end
at a bid price of 61 on continued concerns that the textile
maker will be financially pinched in a recession.</p>
<p>Other high-yield bonds posting losses were securities
issued by Darling-Delaware Co. Although Darling-Delaware's
14% senior subordinated notes, due in 1999, were quoted 3/4
point higher at a bid price of 22 3/4, high-yield traders
said the bonds are now widely being traded "flat" or without
seven points of accrued interest in this case.</p>
<p>Bondholders who bought the bonds before yesterday would
have typically had to pay the seven points of accrued
interest, bringing the actual price of the bonds to 29.</p>
<p>However, reports that the company lacks the cash to pay
interest on its high-yield junk bonds prompted many traders
to quote the bonds without accrued interest.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond ended lower after a
rocky day. But short-term securities ended unchanged to
firmer.</p>
<p>In early trading, long-term bond prices rose after Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan restated the Fed's position
that an easing in short-term interest rates was probable if
Congress approved a deficit reduction plan that was
well-received by the financial markets.</p>
<p>But later in the session, Iraqi threats of possible
terrorist attacks against American targets in retaliation for
so-called "crimes" against the Arab and Islamic nations
prompted a small rise in oil prices. Long-term bonds then
headed lower.</p>
<p>Also pressuring bonds and intermediate maturity government
securities was stronger-than-expected car sales for the early
September selling period. North American-made autos sold at a
7.1 million unit seasonally adjusted annual rate in the
10-day period, unchanged from the previous period.</p>
<p>The steady sales pace forced many investors to reassess
their outlook for the economy.</p>
<p>The Treasury's 30-year bond was quoted late at 97 23/32,
down from 5/32 from Wednesday, to yield 8.96%. The two-year
note ended at 100 6/32, up from 100 5/32, to yield 7.999%.</p>
<p>The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills fell to
7.36% for a bond equivalent yield of 7.58%, while the
discount rate on six-month bills ended at 7.28% to yield
7.67%.</p>
<p>Municipal Issues</p>
<p>Municipal bonds were generally unchanged with some issues
trading 1/4 point higher.</p>
<p>Secondary market activity was thin ahead of the release of
August producer price index data today.</p>
<p>The focus continued to be on new issues, which were
well-received, traders said.</p>
<p>In the new issue market, after a three-year hiatus,
Louisiana received a creditable reception for an issue of
$199 million general obligation bonds by a Lehman Brothers
group.</p>
<p>The bonds were priced to yield from 6.10% in 1991 to 7.60%
in 2009 and 2010. Underwriting officials said all of the
bonds had been sold within three hours of the pricing.</p>
<p>Approximately 60% of the Louisiana bonds were placed
directly with investors, with the remaining 40% going into
dealer inventories, a Lehman official said.</p>
<p>Among active issues, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% issues due 2018 was unchanged at 97 7/8 to yield 7.37%.</p>
<p>Mortgage & Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities prices edged slightly higher in
listless trading.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities
for September delivery rose 1/32 to 98 29/32 while Federal
National Mortgage Association 9 1/2% securities rose 2/32 at
99 3/32.</p>
<p>Two new asset-backed offerings were announced yesterday-a
$500 million credit-card issue by a unit of Signet Banking
Corp. and a $300 million Federal National Mortgage
Association Remic offering backed by Fannie Mae 9 1/2%
securities. Both were priced by Goldman Sachs & Co.</p>
<p>The class A senior portion of the credit card securities
were priced at 99 37/64 to yield 9.19% while the class B
subordinated portion of the issue was priced at 99 5/8 to
yield 9.588%.</p>
<p>Goldman didn't release details on the Remic issue.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>The Japanese government auctioned 1.2 trillion yen ($8.69
billion) of new three-month bills at an average yield of
8.27%.</p>
<p>The yield, one of the highest at a Japanese bill auction
in recent years, was 3/4 percentage point higher than yields
on three-month U.S. Treasury bills, but still not high enough
to generate strong demand.</p>
<p>"This was a very good auction for the government," said
Nitoshi Ohara, a bond trader manager at Daiwa Securities Inc.
But he said the bills were not popular with investors because
the yields were too low. "We were looking for yields of more
than 8.40%," he said.</p>
<p>Although the average yield on Japan's new three-month
bills was up from 7.852% at the previous three-month bill
auction, Mr. Ohara notes that new three-month certificates of
deposit now yield about 8.46%.</p>
<p>Japan's Ministry of Finance said the auction garnered a
total 2.213 trillion yen of bids. Thus, the bid-to-cover
ratio, which measures the bids received for each bid
accepted, was 1.84.</p>
<p>In trading yesterday, Japan's benchmark No. 119 10-year
bond fell 0.23 point to 82.09 to yield 8.345%.</p>
