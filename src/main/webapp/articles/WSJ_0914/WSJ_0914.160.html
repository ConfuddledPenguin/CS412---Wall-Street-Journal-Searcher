	<p class="article-leader">The chairman of Allianz AG said he expects gross premium
income to climb 16% to about 37 billion marks ($23.2 billion)
in 1990 from 31.8 billion marks in 1989.
   Wolfgang Schieren also said in Frankfurt, West Germany,
that in 1991, the insurer should see another burst of growth
to 40 billion marks, with a contribution from U.S.-based
Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., which it acquired in August.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By 1991, the results of Fireman's Fund will cause the
foreign share of the concern's business to climb to 50% from
42% in 1989, it is estimated.</p>
