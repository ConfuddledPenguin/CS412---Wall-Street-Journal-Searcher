	<p class="article-leader">Judge Thomas Griesa's review of Robert Goldwin's book
about the Constitution -- "Why Blacks, Women, and Jews Are
Not Mentioned in the Constitution, and Other Unorthodox
Views" -- contains the questionable assertion that ". . .
when abolition (of slavery) finally came, it was the laws and
practices of certain states that needed to be changed, not
the Constitution." (Leisure & Arts, Aug. 22)
   He seems to have forgotten the 13th, 14th and 15th
amendments to the Constitution, all of which specifically
addressed slavery and its consequences. The 13th Amendment
specifically uses the word "slavery," in order to abolish it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Slavery was not abolished, as Mr. Griesa (or perhaps Mr.
Goldwin) suggests, by changing the laws of a few states. It
was partially abolished by the Abraham's Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation and the good offices of the Union
Army; but several slaves states fought on the side of the
Union and other states that had outlawed slavery long before
had done so with grandfather clauses that perpetuated it in
isolated instances. For example, there were still a few
elderly slaves in New Jersey at the outbreak of the Civil
War. It was the 13th Amendment that formally eliminated
slavery.</p>
<p>The word "slavery" does not appear prior to the 13th
Amendment because the authors of the Constitution preferred
euphemism to defending the indefensible, a not uncommon
political response to embarrassing realities. Even the
slaveholders preferred euphemism, with "servant" being the
favored description for the victims of the Peculiar
Institution.</p>
<p>That embarrassment was particularly acute because the
members of the Philadelphia convention were otherwise staunch
defenders of human liberty and intended the Constitution to
serve that noble end, and it has, for the most part, in the
ensuing two centuries.</p>
