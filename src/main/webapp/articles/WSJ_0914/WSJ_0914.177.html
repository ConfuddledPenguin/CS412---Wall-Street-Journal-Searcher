	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Nelson Bunker Hunt and his major creditors have
tentatively settled a mineral-rights dispute that had been
holding up the sale of more than $70 million of real estate
from the oilman's estate.
   Hit by heavy losses from their investments in silver and
oil, Mr. Hunt and his brother, William Herbert Hunt, filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankruptcy Code in 1988. Under a reorganization plan
negotiated with creditors last year, Nelson Bunker Hunt was
permitted to keep a 50% interest in the mineral rights to
certain non-producing properties. Mr. Hunt and his creditors
subsequently disagreed over which properties were included
under that clause.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under an agreement filed in federal bankruptcy court here
this week, Mr. Hunt will receive $315,000 from the sale of
two family-owned Canadian oil companies, a 50% interest in
the coal and lignite leases on one Texas ranch and a 60%
interest in oil and gas leases on one Oklahoma property.
Although mineral rights to certain other properties will be
shared, control of most will revert to the trustee
liquidating Mr. Hunt's estate. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Harold
Abramson is expected to rule on the settlement next month.</p>
<p>"We're moving full-speed ahead," said trustee Carter Pate,
who said settlement would allow him to finalize sales on Mr.
Hunt's Circle T Ranch near Dallas and several other
properties in Texas and Kentucky.</p>
<p>The Hunt brothers and their creditors have yet to settle a
dispute involving how much the Texas oilmen should be paid
for their efforts to help the liquidating trustees in both
cases sell their collections of rare coins and antiques.</p>
