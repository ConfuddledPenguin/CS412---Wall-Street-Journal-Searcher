	<p class="article-leader">Applied Biosystems Inc. said it would incur a $5 million
pretax charge in the first quarter ending Sept. 28 to cover
the cost of relocating its liquid chromatography components
operation from New Jersey to California.
   A spokesman said the charge is equal to about $4 million,
or 25 cents a share, after taxes. In the year-earlier
quarter, Applied reported net income of $2.3 million, or 16
cents a share, on sales of $36.8 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The equipment maker for the biotechnology industry, based
in Foster City, Calif., said the relocation would "enhance
its ability to support its customer base, more effectively
coordinate new product development efforts and improve its
overall cost structure."</p>
<p>Liquid chromatography is a process to separate molecules.
Applied said about 20% of the 113 workers employed in the
operation would be relocated; the company employs 1,300
people world-wide.</p>
