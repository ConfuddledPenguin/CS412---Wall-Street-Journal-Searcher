	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- An explosion at a Soviet factory that makes
metals used in nuclear reactors injured several people and
underlined mounting concerns about Soviet industrial safety.
   The accident, which occurred Wednesday in the Soviet
Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, didn't release
radiation or kill anyone, according to Tass, the Soviet news
agency. It reported yesterday that "several people" were
injured in the fire, which began in the basement of the
factory's beryllium metals workshop. Beryllium is a toxic but
non-radioactive metal that the Soviets use in some of their
scientific, space and military reactors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite initial fears of a repeat of the 1986 Chernobyl
nuclear accident, by late yesterday U.S. and West European
nuclear experts were classifying the explosion as a serious
but conventional industrial accident.</p>
<p>Normally, there wouldn't be much radioactive material at
such a metals-forming factory; the only immediately apparent
link to the nuclear industry was that the factory's products
are used in some Soviet nuclear reactors. The plant is also
far from the nearest nuclear-testing site.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't worry about it" posing any health threat
outside the immediate area of the factory, said one U.S.
Energy Department official, who declined to be named.
Supporting that view, Soviet delegates to the International
Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna indicated there wasn't any
radiation danger.</p>
<p>But the accident, whose cause Moscow didn't disclose,
stirred renewed concern in the Soviet capital and elsewhere
about the country's worsening record of industrial safety.
Underlining that concern, the Kremlin dispatched a deputy
atomic-energy minister to visit the accident scene yesterday,
according to one Soviet nuclear industry official reached by
telephone in Moscow.</p>
<p>Tass said the fire was extinguished in about 90 minutes,
but that beryllium contamination at the site was still twice
the permitted Soviet safety level. Beryllium, when inhaled,
can cause a serious lung ailment called berylliosis.</p>
<p>Since the 1986 Chernobyl accident, Soviet officials and
journalists have shown more concern about safety throughout
Soviet industry. Reliable statistics are hard to come by, but
last year the official newspaper Izvestia lamented about the
200,000 Soviet industrial deaths and injuries that occurred
in 1988, many due to careless practices, decrepit equipment,
or even poor washroom facilities when dealing with toxic
materials.</p>
<p>Part of the problem, Western analysts say, has been a
paucity of comprehensive occupational safety laws or
regulations; until recently, most safety standards were split
up among the various ministries that supervised each
industry. To tackle the problem, the Soviet Academy of
Sciences recently launched a major new study of Soviet safety
methodology. And Moscow this year created one, industrywide
safety regulator. So far, there is little evidence of
improved safety, and this week's accident is likely to put
added pressure on Moscow to produce results.</p>
<p>According to Tass, the accident occurred at the Ulbinsky
metallurgical plant near the city of Ust-Kamenogorsk, in the
Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. The site is about 100 miles
east of Semipalatinsk, where the Soviets conduct their
nuclear weapons tests. There wasn't any evidence, however, of
a link between the accident and weapons testing.</p>
<p>With few details emerging from Moscow, Western analysts
speculated that a conventional chemical or gas explosion
might have occurred at the factory, spewing smoke and
beryllium into the air. The resulting smoke cloud was
reported drifting towards the Chinese border, 200 miles away.</p>
<p>Some initial confusion was caused by Tass's description of
the plant as "a major producer of fuel for nuclear power
stations." But Soviet officials Thursday told the
International Atomic Energy Agency that the description
wasn't accurate, a spokesman for the Vienna-based United
Nations affiliate said.</p>
<p>In fact, according to Soviet officials, the beryllium
produced in the factory is used to make non-fuel components
of reactors. Specifically, the material is often used as a
"reflector" inside some reactors. A reflector is a layer of
metal surrounding a reactor's radioactive core. As the
uranium fuel inside the reactor fissions to produce energy,
many high-energy particles race away from the core. A
reflector bounces the subatomic particles back into the core,
to help maintain the atomic reaction and reduce the amount of
radiation escaping.</p>
<p>The big Soviet nuclear program, however, is apparently
unique in using beryllium alloys in reactors; in the West,
various zirconium-steel alloys are used. The U.S experimented
with beryllium decades ago, but it dropped the material as
too expensive and toxic. The Soviets have apparently
continued producing it for some specialized, high-performance
reactors in its space program and its military research.</p>
