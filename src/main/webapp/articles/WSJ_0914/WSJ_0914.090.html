	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Allegheny & Western Energy Corp. said its
TEX-HEX Corp. unit completed two horizontal discoveries, the
Lane No. 4 and the Dickson No. 5, in the Austin Chalk field
in south Texas.
   The energy concern said the Lane No. 4 well tested at a
rate of 2,050 barrels of oil a day and 920,000 cubic feet of
natural gas a day, through a 33/64th-inch choke. The Dickson
No. 5 tested at a rate of 385 barrels of oil a day and
240,000 cubic feet of natural gas a day. The company wouldn't
disclose the choke size or tubing pressure on the Dickson
well, saying through a spokesman that "it doesn't have a
significance."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>TEX-HEX is the operator of all of Allegheny & Western's
Austin Chalk acreage and holds a 25% working interest in the
Lane well and a 50% working interest in the Dickson well. The
company didn't disclose the names of working interest
partners in either well.</p>
