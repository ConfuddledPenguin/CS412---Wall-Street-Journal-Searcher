	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- When Canadians tune in their favorite national
newscasts Monday night, they'll watch a father and son play
an emotion-charged game of pool. The teen-age son's plans for
university are threatened by his father's financial problems,
but the proud father is too stubborn to seek financial
advice.
   Viewers won't be watching a report on the coming recession
or a documentary on parent-teen-ager relationships. They'll
be watching a commercial, cleverly disguised as drama.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Royal Trustco Ltd. has sewn up every second of ad time on
Canada's two national nightly news programs, as well as on a
host of independent programs, for a whole week. The company
even managed to persuade the news shows to rearrange their
usual commercial formats to accommodate its ads.</p>
<p>Each night next week, Royal Trustco will show a different
five-minute ad. The spots will be broken into two segments.
The first half is designed to hook viewers, so they'll stay
tuned to see how the drama works out in the second half.</p>
<p>Along with the troubled father and son, there will be a
daughter who doesn't feel comfortable talking about her
mother's will, an engaged couple trying to sort out financial
differences, two sisters away on vacation talking about money
management and two brothers wondering if they can afford to
buy the family house.</p>
<p>"Love, death, promises, memories and money. Watch the late
news]" exclaim ads at Royal Trustco's branches. The company
hopes the three million Canadian dollar (US$2.6 million)
campaign will bring in well-heeled clients to seek its
financial advice and banking services. The company's motto:
"Peace of mind through sound financial advice."</p>
<p>The television ads, which Royal Trustco touts as "the
world's first five minute-commercial dramas" are the
brainchild of a small Alberta-based agency, Hayhurst
Communications Alberta Ltd. Lois Lockwood, the company's
senior account executive, said the ads are designed to "break
through the clutter" of normal television fare.</p>
<p>"Our objective was to increase Royal Trustco's awareness
significantly," Ms. Lockwood said. With the news shows, "the
audience is already there, and they match our demographic
target."</p>
<p>Hayhurst, which beat out large, established Toronto
agencies for the job, its first national account, has a lot
on the line. Its compensation is tied directly to how well
the ads do. If consumer awareness of Royal Trustco goes up,
so does the agency's fee. If the ads fail, Hayhurst is left
with just enough to cover its costs.</p>
