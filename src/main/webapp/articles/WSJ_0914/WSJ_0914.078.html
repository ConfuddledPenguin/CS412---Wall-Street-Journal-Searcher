	<p class="article-leader">Many state governments, particularly in coastal states
with a large proportion of affluent taxpayers, have faced
unexpected weakness in their tax receipts in the past three
or four years. This has led many states to introduce higher
income- and sales-tax rates, which damaged their own
economies and placed a significant drag on the national
economy as well.
   The states' choice is part of a downward spiral. States'
self-inflicted damage reduces federal tax receipts. Weak
federal receipts then increase the threat of higher federal
rates, hurting the economy and in turn weakening state
receipts. States then raise taxes, and the cycle continues.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One particular federal tax has had an especially harsh
impact on state tax receipts: the 33% maximum marginal tax
rate on capital gains enacted in 1986. Raising the maximum
marginal rate on capital gains to 33% from 20% stopped the
natural growth of taxable state income from this source.
States in which capital gains had previously been an
important source of taxable state income are finding weak tax
receipts, perhaps without understanding the reason.</p>
<p>The chart shows realized capital gains (net after losses)
for the five states that account for nearly half the capital
gains in the entire nation (see accompanying chart -- WSJ
Sep. 14, 1990). Florida and Texas have no income tax, which
is one reason that many people who have accumulated
substantial assets live there. New York, California and
Illinois have long depended heavily on capital gains taxes.
So have New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and
Connecticut.</p>
<p>Until recently, evidence that a high federal capital gains
rate has hurt state collections might have been deemed
ambiguous. People rushed to realize gains in 1986 because the
tax rate was about to rise to 28% the following year. It
might be argued too that in 1987 capital gains were weak
because of the October stock market crash, though there were
plenty of gains in the year's first eight months.</p>
<p>In any case, the ambiguity ended when the Internal Revenue
Service released its 1988 estimates this spring. For all five
states in the chart, the amount of capital gains reported was
less than half of what it had been in 1986, the last year of
20% tax rates, and well below the level of 1985 (about 5%
lower, on average). This decline in taxable state income from
capital gains over three years occurred despite the
nationwide increase of more than 22% in personal income in
that same period.</p>
<p>For the federal government, the weakness in realizations
since 1986 has been at least partly offset by a much higher
average tax rate on a small volume of capital gains. The
maximum federal capital gains tax was increased to 45% in
1975 from 27% in 1968. Yet so few of the affected
high-bracket taxpayers actually realized gains at the
punitive rates of 1975 that the average capital-gains tax (on
both excluded and taxable gains) remained exactly the same in
1975 as it had been in 1968: 15%. The 1985 reduction of the
highest capital gains tax to 20% percent so encouraged
efficient turnover of assets among higher-income taxpayers
that the average tax paid remained exactly what it had been
in the high-tax 1970s: 15%.</p>
<p>In 1988, by contrast, the capital gains tax on the
highest-income taxpayers rose to 28% percent, but the average
tax rate rose to 24%. It is doubtful if there has ever been a
time in U.S. history when so many taxpayers faced tax rates
above 20% on the uncertain rewards from life savings.</p>
<p>States in which capital gains were a particularly
important source of taxable income expected this source of
income to grow between 1985 and 1988. After all, the Dow
Jones average at the end of 1988 was 62% higher than it had
been in 1985. But the states were mugged by the federal tax
law of 1986. By imposing a 28-33% tax -- even on the inflated
capital gains of couples with rather modest incomes -- the
federal government made it extremely expensive for nearly all
taxpayers to realize any capital gains, particularly in
states that added their own tax on top of the federal levy,
where the combined capital gains burden could reach 39%.
Taxpayers responded by avoiding the sale of assets (except
under financial distress), and by making sure that their
future investments were not subject to combined capital-gains
taxes -- they invested in money-market funds instead of
growth stocks. Tax receipts collapsed in states most
dependent on capital gains -- including much of the
northeast.</p>
<p>But this is not the only adverse effect of high federal
capital-gains taxes on state revenues. The increased federal
tax rate on capital gains also provides a greater incentive
to locate small businesses in states with little or no income
tax, because of the brutal combination of federal and state
capital-gains tax on those who sell their businesses. Loss of
deductibility for state income taxes would greatly aggravate
this effect for small businesses remaining in states like New
Jersey, New York and California. For taxpayers in a 33%
federal bracket and an 8% state bracket, for example, the
combined marginal tax on capital gains would rise to 41% from
the current 38%. Even fewer capital gains would then be
cashed in states with high income-tax rates.</p>
<p>Governors of several states most injured by the federal
tax on capital gains are widely considered to be "liberal"
Democrats who are supposed to favor high federal tax rates on
capital gains out of ideological habit. Yet the evidence is
now clear that this federal tax clearly damages their own
state treasuries, even aside from its damaging effects on the
economic growth and on the value of real estate and other
assets. State governors properly complain about the many
other ways in which the federal government attempts to
preempt the states' tax bases -- by limiting the
deductibility of state income taxes or imposing higher
federal excise taxes. Since taxpayers do not have infinitely
deep pockets, the more the federal government takes, the less
is left for the states. Yet in the case of capital gains,
governors of the states most seriously injured appear willing
to impose draconian state tax rates on their citizens rather
than lobby for relief from this counterproductive federal
tax.</p>
