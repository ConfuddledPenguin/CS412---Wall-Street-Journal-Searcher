	<p class="article-leader">BRASILIA -- Brazil signed a letter of intent to the
International Monetary Fund and pledged to resume debt
renegotiations with creditors this month.
   The letter was the result of drawn-out negotiations that
reportedly nearly fell through over disagreement about a
token payment to creditors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Economy Minister Zelia Cardoso de Mello said Brazil
wouldn't make any symbolic payment of arrears to creditors of
the country's $117 billion foreign debt, the largest in the
Third World.</p>
<p>"We want a constructive, definitive and quick solution,"
the official said.</p>
<p>In the letter, Brazil requested a standby loan of $2.016
billion, to be released in six parcels by February 1992.</p>
<p>The government also outlined goals for growth, the budget
deficit and reducing 4,274% inflation.</p>
<p>Some of the targets are: negative growth of 3% for gross
national product this year; a spending surplus of 0.5% of GNP
this year and 0% in 1991; 25% annual inflation in 1991; a
reduction of the deficit of government-owned companies from
2.5% of GNP in 1989 to 1% this year and 0% in 1991.</p>
