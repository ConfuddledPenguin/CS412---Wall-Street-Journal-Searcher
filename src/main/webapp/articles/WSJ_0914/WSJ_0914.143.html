	<p class="article-leader">Italy's Fiat S.p.A. agreed to buy a 60% stake in Spain's
troubled Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones S.A., or Enasa.
Fiat will put up 12 billion pesetas ($120 million) in new
capital, plus 1.2 billion pesetas in cash for the truck
maker.
   The agreement by Enasa's owner, Instituto Nacional de
Industria, comes as a surprise; as recently as this week
Spanish officials had been discussing a possible accord to
sell Enasa to West Germany's Daimler-Benz AG. Negotiations
had foundered on the Daimler's insistence on big cuts in
Enasa's work force and hefty Spanish government grants.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fiat has agreed to keep on Enasa's entire 5,700 work
force, to retain the use of its Pegaso brand for trucks and
buses and to expand into new activities in Spain, INI
officials said.</p>
<p>INI will retain a 40% stake in Enasa and provide 8 billion
pesetas in new capital; both partners' contributions will
total 20 billion pesetas in increased capital for Enasa by
early next year.</p>
<p>Fiat officials said they have agreed to spend about 40
billion pesetas over the next few years on new industrial
projects in Spain. Fiat also said that it has an option to
buy INI's 40% stake in Enasa in six years' time.</p>
