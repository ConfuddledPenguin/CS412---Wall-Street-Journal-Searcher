	<p class="article-leader">Rolls-Royce PLC, the British airplane engine manufacturer,
reported that pretax profit for the first half rose 14% to
#115 million ($214 million) from #101 million, as buoyant
demand offset the impact of a turn-of-the-year strike.
   The results fell below market expectations, which ranged
between #120 million and #130 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales advanced 42% to #1.59 billion from #1.12 billion a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Earnings per share, however, slipped 2% to 9.9 pence from
10.1 pence because of the larger number of shares in issue in
the latest period.</p>
<p>Rolls-Royce, riding a boom in aircraft orders that has
seen earnings improve throughout most of the industry,
benefited during the latest period from a full six-month
contribution from NEI, the engineering company it acquired
early last year.</p>
<p>"The order book currently stands at a record level of more
than #6 billion and the company continues to gain market
share," Lord Tombs, Rolls-Royce chairman, said.</p>
