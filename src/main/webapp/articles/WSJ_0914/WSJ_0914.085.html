	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Bank of Montreal cut its prime lending rate a
quarter of a percentage point to 13.75%, its lowest level
since January.
   John Parish, the bank's assistant chief economist, said
the rate reduction was prompted by a recent decline in
short-term Canadian interest rates and by the country's
economic slowdown. The prime rate is the base rate charged on
loans to businesses and individuals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It was the second time in two weeks that Bank of Montreal
cut its prime rate by a quarter of a percentage point. Other
major Canadian banks have kept their prime rates at 14.25%.</p>
<p>The Bank of Montreal action followed a decline in the Bank
of Canada bank rate yesterday to 12.7% from 12.82%. The bank
rate is the levy by the central bank on loans to financial
institutions. The bank rate, which has declined for 12
consecutive weeks, is set weekly at a quarter of a percentage
point above the average yield on three-month Canadian
government treasury bills at the Thursday bill auction.</p>
