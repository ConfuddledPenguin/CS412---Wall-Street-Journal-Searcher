form of program trading, accounted for nearly half of all
program trading volume at the New York Stock Exchange during
the final week of August.
   The Big Board reported that program trading strategies
accounted for 12.7% of average daily volume of 127.9 million
shares during the week of Aug. 27 through 31. Some 81.2
million shares traded in program strategies, and 38.9 million
shares, or 47.9% of total program volume, were traded in
stock-index arbitrage strategies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>During the week, Kidder, Peabody & Co., a unit of General
Electric Co., traded 15.7 million shares in program
strategies, the most of any firm. Kidder also had the highest
stock-index arbitrage volume, trading 7.9 million shares.</p>
<p>Among the top five program trading firms for the week were

Investment Group (8.6 million shares); Bear, Stearns & Co.
