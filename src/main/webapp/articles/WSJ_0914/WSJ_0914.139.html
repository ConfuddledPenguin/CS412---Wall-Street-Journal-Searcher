	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The debut of Globex, the automated after-hours
futures trading system being jointly developed by the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and Reuters Holdings PLC, has been
delayed until at least the 1991 first quarter.
   The system, which has been beset by a number of launch
delays, was to have begun operating by year end, according to
the partners' previous estimate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest delay results from the need for continued
testing of the complex computer system. Also slowing Globex
is the complicated process of integrating Chicago Board of
Trade financial futures contracts with the Merc contracts
originally included in Globex.</p>
<p>The two futures exchanges had been developing rival
systems, but in May the Board of Trade agreed, in effect, to
fold its system into Globex. At that time, the launch date
was the end of 1989.</p>
<p>Globex and an automated foreign-exchange trading system
being developed separately by Reuters called Dealing 20002,
whose start-up has also been delayed, are based on some of
the same computer hardware and software, a Reuters spokesman
said. But he said the delays in the two automated trading
systems aren't related.</p>
