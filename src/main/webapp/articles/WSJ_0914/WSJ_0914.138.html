	<p class="article-leader">Automatic Data Processing Inc. said it expects
"double-digit" growth in earnings for fiscal 1991, despite a
"modest increase" in revenue.
   Josh Weston, chairman of Automatic Data, projects the rate
of growth in per-share earnings in "excess of 10%," but said
"it's unlikely that it would go up 15% or more."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In fiscal 1990, ended June 30, the company earned $211.7
million, or $2.88 a share, on revenue of $1.71 billion.</p>
<p>In a meeting with securities analysts, the company said
revenue isn't expected to rise as much as earnings, growing
moderately at a rate of about 3%. Nevertheless, the company,
based in New York, said it is being aided by a lower tax rate
because of its increased investments in tax advantaged
marketable securites. That will help push earnings to "record
levels," Mr. Weston said.</p>
<p>Mr. Weston said also that he expects double digit growth
for earnings in the current first quarter. In fiscal 1990
fourth quarter, the company earned $59.7 million, or 81 cents
a share, on revenue of $425.8 million.</p>
<p>Automatic Data Processing provides data processing for
employer services such as payroll, brokerage transactions and
automative dealerships.</p>
