	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- U.S. and Iraqi soldiers may be sweating it out
in the desert, but in Detroit it's party time.
   The 1991 model year begins Oct. 1, and auto makers are
wheeling out some of the biggest and brawniest cars in years.
There's General Motors Corp.'s Buick Roadmaster wagon, a
4,415-pound monster with a V-8 engine that gets 16 miles to
the gallon in city driving. Ford Motor Co. is pitching its
own new V-8 engines, and Chrysler Corp. is offering teasing
glimpses of a 10-cylinder super sports car called Viper.
Japanese auto makers are also revving up: Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. is introducing a new 300-horsepower turbocharged sports
car, the 3000GT.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The cars couldn't have arrived at a worse time, as far as
the on-again off-again energy debate is concerned. With oil
conservation once again on the American agenda, the auto
makers are finding themselves accused of chasing quick
profits at the expense of saving gas. "They are emphasizing
power and options and not efficiency," says Daniel Becker, a
lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "At the same time the U.S. is
becoming more and more dependent on foreign oil, the auto
makers have been backsliding on fuel economy."</p>
<p>As early as today, the U.S. Senate may start considering a
bill that would require new car fleets to average about 34
miles a gallon in five years, and 40 miles a gallon or more
by the year 2001. The bill's complex formula could require
some manufacturers to hit even higher targets. The current
standard is 27.5 mpg, a figure meant to represent the average
fuel efficiency for a manufacturer's entire line of cars.
Small cars usually surpass that limit, large cars usually
fall short.</p>
<p>The auto makers argue that the new targets are impossible
to meet because they are at least 20% higher than the
fuel-economy levels achieved by cars currently on the road.
Don't buy "the illusion that drastic increases in government
fuel economy standards are the answer to an oil crisis," the
car companies are saying in full-page newspaper ads. "They
are not."</p>
<p>But auto makers could do better -- and have in the past.
New-car fuel economy was better two years ago than it is
today, and could improve again with some modest efforts.
Sharply higher fuel-economy standards, however, could prove
highly expensive to car companies and consumers alike. Auto
makers would have to rip up their current product programs,
which were crafted in the cheap-gas era of the late 1980s.
They would also have to build a far higher proportion of
small cars than they currently envision.</p>
<p>New technology will help, but there isn't any easy
solution that will let Americans cruise around in big muscle
mobiles that get 40 miles to the gallon. Thus, many consumers
would have to settle for small cars instead of the Jeeps,
minivans and luxury cars that they have been flocking to in
recent years.</p>
<p>"The largest cars would have to be very small," says
auto-industry consultant George Peterson. "In the case of
Ford, a large car would be an Escort," the company's
bread-and-butter subcompact. In Italy, average automotive
fuel economy is about 34 miles a gallon -- but 80% of the
cars on the road are subcompacts.</p>
<p>The auto makers concede that, thanks to the Kuwait crisis,
fuel-economy standards will get higher, even if the proposal
before the Senate doesn't become law. The only question is,
how much higher?</p>
<p>Many lawmakers haven't forgotten the last go-round in this
debate. In the mid-1970s, Big Three executives insisted they
couldn't build cars that averaged better than 14 mpg.
Congress ordered them to do it anyway. Now, many of those
same executives boast about the technical achievements that
have nearly doubled the average fuel economy of their cars.</p>
<p>Still, Ford says it now costs the company $300 million to
$500 million per model for every additional one-mile-a-gallon
boost in fuel economy. And Big Three executives say they've
run out of technology to make steep gains. None of the Big
Three currently meets today's federal fuel economy standard
of 27.5 mpg. Without radical changes in car design, "we don't
know how to get to 35 miles per gallon by 1995," says Richard
Donnelly, head of GM's engine division.</p>
<p>But people outside the industry have some hints. For
starters, the auto makers might reconsider the latest
consumer-driven trend to put "performance" -- speed and
acceleration -- ahead of fuel economy. "A lot of the
technology used in cars today isn't being used to milk
maximum fuel economy, but to increase driveability or
performance," says J. Dillard Murrell, who helped write an
Environmental Protection Agency study of declining fuel
economy.</p>
<p>Cadillac, for example, notes that its bigger, 1991 V-8
engines get 26 miles a gallon in highway driving, one mile a
gallon more than last year's models. But GM's decision to
boost the engine's horsepower to 200 from 180 washed out a
potentially greater fuel-economy gain from changes in the
engine's design.</p>
<p>Ford, for its part, decided to offer a big V-8 engine in
its Thunderbird this year for the first time in years. Ford's
goal was to have the V-8 model average 23.5 miles per gallon
in city and highway driving. The company found it could
exceed that goal by one mile per gallon, but chose not to.
Instead, it redesigned the car to make it accelerate from
zero to 60 miles half a second faster, and got about 0.4
miles less per gallon.</p>
<p>"If you've got half a second improvement in performance,
you've got to give up something to get it," says J.H.
Kennedy, manager of specialty-car development at Ford.</p>
<p>The auto makers remind their critics that they are simply
trying to satisfy the customer. Indeed, today's "horsepower
race" is a response to a drop in gasoline prices during the
late 1980s that put performance ahead of fuel efficiency on
the shopping list of most Americans. Sales of subcompact cars
have fallen 18% in the past year, while overall auto sales
dropped only slightly.</p>
<p>Also, GM got badly burned in 1986 when it built several
radically smaller luxury cars -- Cadillacs, Buicks and
Oldsmobiles -- just as gasoline prices plunged. Sales of
those models plunged as well, idling thousands of workers and
lots of expensive machinery. Only after GM hastily made the
cars big again did sales start to recover.</p>
<p>The car companies raise another point: At Washington's
insistence, they have shifted their focus from fuel-economy
to making cars safer and less polluting, and that can work
against saving gas. Making a car safer often means making it
heavier by adding steel door beams or airbag hardware. And
tuning engines to run cleaner often results in diminished
fuel economy, partly because extra anti-pollution equipment
adds weight.</p>
<p>The car companies say they can't simply turn on a dime
now. Product plans are set years in advance. Thus, the auto
makers have been designing cars for the mid-1990s to meet
demand for bigger, more powerful cars.</p>
<p>Consider GM's Buick Roadmaster wagon and its sister cars,
the Chevrolet Caprice and Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham. During
the early 1980s, GM expected gas would rise to $2 a gallon or
more by 1990. Production of the rear-wheel-drive -- and thus
heavier -- full-size Buick Estate Wagon was scheduled to end,
and the Caprice was to be replaced by a mid-sized,
front-wheel-drive model.</p>
<p>But when gasoline prices dropped, strong sales of the cars
led GM to decide to keep them big. It invested hundreds of
millions of dollars to update the Caprice and its sibling
cars and commited two factories to build them. It took six
months just to retool one of the factories.</p>
<p>Now, the new Roadmaster and Caprice are hitting the market
-- just in time for another oil shock. GM could redesign the
cars as smaller, front-drive models, but that would take
another three to five years and up to $1 billion.</p>
<p>GM isn't alone in this dilemma. Of 37 North American car
plants operated by the Big Three, 29 now build cars that
average less than 27.5 miles per gallon. Like their
counterparts at GM, designers at Ford and Chrysler are
working now on models for the mid-1990s. From a
fuel-efficiency standpoint, many of these vehicles will be
only marginally more economical than current products.</p>
<p>All this reflects the fact that the Big Three still rely
on mid-sized and large cars for the bulk of their U.S.
automotive profits. "GM and Ford have used large, luxury cars
as cash cows," says John Casesa, industry analyst with the
Wertheim, Schroder & Co. securities firm. Giving those cars
up "could have a terrible impact on profitability," he says.</p>
<p>Even Japanese firms will have trouble doing a 180-degree
turn on fuel economy. They sell lots of gas-sipping
subcompacts, and have better overall fuel economy scores than
the Big Three. But the Japanese have been invading the market
for mid-sized and luxury cars with startling success --
introducing some cars that slurp more fuel per mile than
their American rivals. Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti Q45, for
example, has a V-8 engine and averages 21.5 miles per gallon.</p>
<p>Technological advances may help the auto industry lift
fuel economy. Multivalve engines, for example, have three or
four valves for each cylinder instead of the standard two,
which adds more air to the combustion mixture and thus makes
fuel burn more efficiently. A car now powered by a 2.5-liter
conventional engine could get the same performance with a
2-liter multivalve engine, says environmental consultant K.G.
Duleep. The smaller, lighter multi-valve engine would use 8%
less gasprovided the technology isn't used just to improve
acceleration, Mr. Duleep says.</p>
<p>But even if GM, Ford and Chrysler put multi-valve engines
in all their vehicles over the next several years, engineers
at those companies say they couldn't meet fleet targets as
high as 35 or 40 mpg without substantially cutting the number
of large cars they sell.</p>
<p>They point to the experience of Toyota Motor Corp. Its
Camry is a five-passenger, front-wheel-drive sedan that fits
the ideal car profile laid out by federal regulators. It
comes with a standard 16-valve, four-cylinder engine and an
electronically controlled transmission, and it has high
quality standards. Yet it averages less than 33 miles per
gallon.</p>
<p>That's why Toyota officials moan about proposals to raise
standards to as high as 40 mpg. To hit that level, most
Toyotas sold in the U.S. would have to be tiny cars like the
39-mpg subcompact Tercel. Toyota's highly successful,
250-horsepower Lexus LS 400 luxury sedan, which sells for
$38,000, averages just 23.5 miles a gallon. "We would be an
all-Tercel company," says a Toyota spokesman.</p>
<p>Moreover, blockbuster advances in fuel savings, such as
commercially viable electric cars or two-stroke engines that
get 40 or 50 miles to the gallon, aren't coming any time
soon. GM says it must solve a number of technical problems to
put its much-publicized Impact electric car on the road, even
in limited numbers.</p>
<p>Vehicles powered by propane or methanol are in use in
parts of the country. But auto makers don't have the
machinery to mass-produce these cars. And it will take time
for alternative fuels to become universally available.</p>
<p>Auto makers can cut the weight of cars using plastic or
aluminum instead of steel in bumpers, doors and other parts.
But these materials cost more than steel, and in some cases
entail sacrifices in appearance and durability. And in return
for higher prices, consumers would get only marginal
fuel-economy improvement -- unless cars also were made
smaller.</p>
<p>But auto makers may have little choice as they reckon with
new oil prices. Chrysler recently postponed plans to build a
big rear-wheel-drive luxury car in the mid-1990s and will use
the money to develop a compact sedan instead. GM has decided
against putting a 5.7-liter V-8 engine in the Buick
Roadmaster wagon.</p>
<p>Auto makers also are starting to revamp their marketing
pitches to tilt, once again, toward fuel economy. But if the
preferences of some industry observers are any guide, it will
be a tough sell in the absence of gas lines. Mr. Duleep, the
energy conservation expert, drives a 1989 Nissan Maxima, a
muscular car that gets just 19 miles to the gallon in the
city. Says Mr. Duleep: "I have to use up my share of gas
before everybody else does."</p>
