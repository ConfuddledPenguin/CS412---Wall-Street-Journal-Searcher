	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Although the nation's banks face serious
problems, the industry isn't headed for a disaster on the
magnitude of the savings-and-loan crisis, Federal Reserve
Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said.
   Testifying before the House Banking Committee, Mr.
Greenspan endorsed the idea of raising banks'
deposit-insurance premiums, a move that the administration
and an increasing number of lawmakers support.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Greenspan also reiterated that the Fed would probably
lower interest rates if Congress and the administration reach
a "credible and enforceable" agreement to reduce the federal
budget deficit. It was the first time the chairman has made
such comments since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent oil
prices soaring and heightened fears of resurgent inflation.</p>
<p>Government officials have grown increasingly anxious over
the health of the nation's banks in the wake of the
multibillion-dollar thrift bailout. New alarms clanged this
week when two congressional agencies warned that the federal
insurance fund that protects bank depositors was dangerously
low.</p>
<p>But Mr. Greenspan said the banking industry is much
sounder than its sister thrift industry was several years
ago, when problems that led to the failure of thousands of
S&Ls and the huge taxpayer bailout were beginning to fester.
Banks' levels of capital are higher, he said, and banking
regulation is tougher. He also said bank assets are
shorter-term than those of thrifts, allowing banks to more
easily balance their borrowing costs with lending rates.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Fed chairman said, "The chance of having
the type of problems with banks that we have with thrifts is
very significantly lower."</p>
<p>But Mr. Greenspan agreed that the deposit-insurance fund
"is under stress" with fund reserves, as a percentage of
insured deposits, at a record low. He also said banks are
threatened by an increasing number of sour real-estate loans
brought on by a downturn in commercial real estate.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan said he would favor enhancing the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp.'s authority to borrow from the
Treasury to cope with any shortages in the insurance fund
while Congress is working on changes in deposit insurance.
The FDIC currently has a $5 billion line of credit with the
Treasury, but has never used it.</p>
<p>If insurance premiums are raised, Mr. Greenspan said,
officials must take great care to set a level that wouldn't
push some institutions into insolvency. He suggested the
FDIC, which manages both bank and thrift deposit-insurance
funds, determine a new ceiling on insurance premiums. The
premium on thrift deposits is 23 cents per $100 of deposits,
and the premium for banks is set to rise 4.5 cents next year
to 19.5 cents per $100 of deposits.</p>
<p>The chairmen of the Banking committees, Sen. Donald Riegle
(D., Mich.) and Rep. Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), yesterday
introduced bills that would give regulators the authority to
raise bank deposit-insurance premiums.</p>
<p>There is no question that the insurance fund has led banks
to take risks, knowing that the government would protect
their deposit funds, Mr. Greenspan said. It has also kept
depositors from scrutinizing the soundness of the
institutions they choose to house their money, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan said raising the requirements for bank
capital and strengthening supervision of banks would "go a
long way to eliminate excessive risk-taking by insured
institutions."</p>
<p>He expressed reservations about reducing the federal
insurance limit of $100,000 per account, another idea gaining
popularity. "If we were starting from scratch, the board
believes it would be difficult to make the case that
deposit-insurance coverage should be as high as its current
$100,000 level," he said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, banks, thrifts and millions of households
have made decisions assuming the $100,000 coverage, he said.
"Should Congress decide to lower deposit-insurance limits, a
meaningful transition period would be needed," he suggested.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan also said that in the past "month or two"
banks may have "gone over the line" in restricting their
lending policies. Some banks have tightened lending standards
this year, mostly in commercial real-estate loans, leading to
widespread complaints of a credit squeeze. Mr. Greenspan had
been welcoming the increased prudence, and yesterday
maintained: "A substantial part of the pulling back is good,
not bad."</p>
<p>Separately, Sen. Alan Dixon (D., Ill.) introduced
legislation that would require the Fed to pay into the
bank-insurance fund interest on the $33 billion the industry
keeps in reserve at the Fed. The interest would provide
roughly $2.5 billion annually to the insurance fund, which
currently stands at $13.2 billion.</p>
