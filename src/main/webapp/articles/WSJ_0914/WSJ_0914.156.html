	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A federal bankruptcy court judge here,
granted Management Co. Entertainment Group Inc. a one-day
extension to answer a creditor petition for involuntary
liquidation of its movie unit.
   The extension was granted after the company switched law
firms and amid reports that there is pressure on Jonathan D.
Krane, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, to
resign. Mr. Krane was the subject of a front-page profile
yesterday in this newspaper. Mr. Krane couldn't be reached
for comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a court filing objecting to a longer extension, an
attorney for the creditors said MCEG representatives had told
him that "a dispute is raging and is unresolved concerning
the management of the {company} and that present management
is resisting unconditional ouster without some kinds of
unspecified protection."</p>
<p>MCEG said it expects to make an announcement about plans
for a reorganization today. The company has been negotiating
a possible restructuring with a number of potential investors
including Domino Management Co., a group headed by Norman
Levy, a consultant. Mr. Levy didn't return phone calls.</p>
<p>Leslie A. Cohen, an attorney for MCEG, said the company's
movie unit is considering filing for protection from
creditors under federal bankruptcy law.</p>
<p>MCEG, a movie production, talent management and
distribution company, is in default on more than $100 million
of debt and its largest creditors include the GE Capital unit
of General Electric Co. The petition for involuntary
liquidation of the movie unit was filed by director Nicolas
Roeg and two other creditors.</p>
