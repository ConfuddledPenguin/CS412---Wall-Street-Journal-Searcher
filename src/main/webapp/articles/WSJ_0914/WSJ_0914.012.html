	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Despite President Bush's pledge in Helsinki that
the U.S. will be "as forthcoming as possible" in helping the
Soviet economy, an American business delegation he sent here
found that closer economic ties still face numerous
obstacles.
   The group of 15 chief executive officers, led by Commerce
Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, announced several new ventures
with Soviet organizations and agreed to take part in a U.S.
government-managed program to train Soviet executives.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But significant expansion of business still awaits Soviet
passage of an emigration law and settlement of pre-Communist
Russian debts to the U.S., among other things. Even the
U.S.-Soviet trade agreement, announced with fanfare at the
June summit in Washington, remains in limbo.</p>
<p>"We can't implement the trade agreement until they pass
that emigration law," says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary
of Commerce for International Trade. The law has been on the
Soviet parliament's agenda for months, but legislators
haven't approved it. Mr. Mosbacher said he was told by Soviet
officials that it could be passed within four to eight weeks.</p>
<p>The collapsing Soviet economy is also proving a tough
challenge for would-be Western business partners. The nation
is on the verge of adopting sweeping market-oriented reforms
that aim to decentralize and deregulate much of the economy.
But there is considerable uncertainty over what this would
involve, and what impact it would have on the existing
structure of Soviet trade.</p>
<p>"It's clear that this isn't the easiest time to be
negotiating joint ventures with the Soviet Union," says
Kenneth T. Derr, chairman and chief executive of Chevron
Corp., which is discussing a big oil project in the republic
of Kazakhstan. Mr. Derr and other executives say they are
hedging their bets by keeping close contacts with Soviet
officials at all levels.</p>
<p>"Things are fluid, because you don't know which unit of
government will be making the rules," says Lodwrick Cook,
chairman of Atlantic Richfield Corp. "Right now, if you sign
a deal with the national government, you might also have to
sign with the republic or local governments as well."</p>
<p>Until the reforms are in place, Western executives will
also have to put up with traditional problems of the Soviet
economy, such as the absence of a convertible currency, poor
transport and telecommunications, ambiguous laws and obscure
accounting practices. At the same time, the present system is
showing rapid decline; the daily Izvestia reported yesterday
that industrial production dropped 1.7% in August alone,
continuing a slide that started last year.</p>
<p>Mr. Mosbacher says many of these problems are "not
insurmountable, but there are differences that we need to
work together to overcome." And, in public at least, the
executives appear cheered by the trip, which Dwayne O.
Andreas, chairman and chief executive of
Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., described as "a watershed."</p>
<p>Although common practice in many other nations, it is rare
for the U.S. to send a senior government official abroad at
the head of a delegation of businessmen, and the executives
welcomed the change. "In the past we were badly beaten by
Europeans who had support of their governments when we
didn't," says John J. Murphy, chief executive of Dresser
Industries Inc.</p>
<p>The new ventures announced include agreements between
Sea-Land Services Inc, a unit of CSX Corp., and the Black Sea
and Baltic shipping companies to carry cargo on their
vessels. Alex J. Mandl, Sea-Land's chairman and chief
executive, says the company will also send staff to oversee a
new Trans-Siberian Express rail service that the company
plans to use to transport goods from Asia to Europe.</p>
<p>Mr. Andreas of Archer-Daniels-Midland says he reached
final understanding with Soviet officials for ventures
involving soy protein and grain storage facilities, but gave
no details. And an existing joint venture involving Transisco
Industries Inc. landed orders for equipping 1,000 railway
cars to export oil and chemicals, says Transisco's chief,
Mark C. Hungerford.</p>
<p>Such agreements have been in the pipeline for some time,
however, and aren't related to Mr. Bush's pledge in Helsinki
for greater U.S. private-sector involvement in the Soviet
economy. "All the deals now being cut are being done on an
essentially stand-alone basis," says Mr. Farren of the
Commerce Department. "You come in and do your own special
deals with the ministries." He said a U.S. goal is to get the
Soviets to set up a "generic structure" for normal business
agreements.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the one area where the Soviets are most
hopeful of receiving U.S. technology and expertise, oil and
gas, the American delegation appeared to make little headway,
even though six of the 15 chief executives came from these
industries. Mr. Cook of Atlantic Richfield says he returns
home "better informed and enthusiastic," but admits there are
"political and economic issues still to be resolved."</p>
<p>Chevron, which in early 1989 signed a protocol of intent
to work in the Kazakhstan oil fields, now hopes to reach
final agreement by year end and possibly start production in
1991, Mr. Derr says. While that venture could turn out to be
the biggest investment of any U.S. company in the Soviet
Union, most of the other deals, planned and agreed, are more
modest.</p>
<p>Mr. Mandl said Sea-Land is interested in using Soviet rail
and air facilities for moving freight from East to West. But
he says the company's planned ventures involve investment of
just "a few million dollars." Given the current political and
economic climate in the Soviet Union, "if I had to spend $1
billion, I'd think differently about it," he said.</p>
