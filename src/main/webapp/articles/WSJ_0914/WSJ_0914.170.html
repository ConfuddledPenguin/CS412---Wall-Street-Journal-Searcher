	<p class="article-leader">Go-Video Inc., Scottsdale, Ariz., said a federal court
decision cleared the way for a trial to begin on its
anti-trust suit against five Japanese makers of videocassette
recorders.
   Go-Video, which is marketing a dual-deck VCR, said a U.S.
district court judge in Phoenix, Ariz., denied a motion by
defendants to delay the trial and refused to reconsider his
denial of a previous motion to dismiss the case.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The defendants, which Go-Video accuses of conspiring to
block its efforts to market the VCR, are Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co., Victor Co. of Japan Ltd., Sony Corp., Sanyo
Electric Co. and NEC Corp.</p>
<p>The new VCR, which can record two programs at once, plays
one while recording another and duplicate tapes, hit the
market last June.</p>
