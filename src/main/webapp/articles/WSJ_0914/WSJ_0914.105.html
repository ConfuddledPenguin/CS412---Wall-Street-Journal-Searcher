	<p class="article-leader">SEBOKENG, South Africa -- One by one, the men from the
cinderblock hostels step forward under the towering bluegum
tree to bear witness to the slaughter of the night before.
   It was 2:30 in the morning, they all say, when gunshots
and explosions shattered their sleep in the wretched
dormitories that house South Africa's migrant workers. A
large man called Oupa says a bullet ricocheted off his metal
door. When he opened it, he saw black men with red headbands,
allegedly members of Inkatha, a Zulu-based political
organization, rampaging with spears, machetes, guns and
grenades.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An old man with a limp tells of peeking through a window
and seeing a white man on horseback firing a rifle in all
directions. A younger resident describes how the sun rose to
reveal two dozen corpses. Some were horribly disfigured by
machete blows to the face, he says. Others were both hacked
and shot. As the men regrouped to confront their attackers,
government soldiers opened fire on them. Eleven more hostel
residents fell dead.</p>
<p>Anger surrounds the bluegum tree. Where, the men ask, was
their organization, the African National Congress? Where was
the ANC's armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, or MK? As ANC leader
Nelson Mandela stood before them later that horrible day,
they begged for weapons. They wanted revenge.</p>
<p>Instead, Mr. Mandela, himself boiling with anger after
seeing a man's brain spilling out of a crushed skull at the
morgue, appealed for calm. The savage fighting, which has
left over 700 blacks dead in the past month -- including more
than 20 killed yesterday in an attack on a train in
Johannesburg -- has bloodied his own prestige and that of the
other major peace brokers, the government and Inkatha. And it
has staggered the negotiations he has delicately nurtured
with President F.W. de Klerk.</p>
<p>The ANC, Mr. Mandela explained to the vengeful men, had
suspended its armed struggle. He had no arms to give them.
Trust him, he pleaded. Trust the ANC.</p>
<p>But trust is a fleeting thing in South Africa these days.
For the third time this year, the mortuary and hospital of
Sebokeng are full. March 26, July 22, Sept. 4 -- three
"massacres," as the residents here say, when the main road of
this blighted black township south of Johannesburg became
slick with blood. For the third time, Mr. Mandela came to
visit and reassure. For the third time, the people, weary of
battle, listened to their beloved leader and wanted to
believe.</p>
<p>"Yes, we will trust Nelson -- for now," says Petrus
Dzanebe. But he now sleeps in his clothes, he confesses, and
with one eye open. "We live in fear," he says, "that this
will happen again, at any time."</p>
<p>Should it, local ANC officials fear that Mr. Mandela
couldn't dare return to Sebokeng without weapons. Earlier
this week, even Mr. Mandela himself said the grass-roots call
for armed protection is growing too strong to resist for much
longer.</p>
<p>Mr. Mandela, who has been a free man for seven months
after 27 years in prison, faces a dilemma of Gorbachevian
proportion: Wildly popular abroad, he is desperately
struggling to control the tumultuous course of change at
home.</p>
<p>Where optimism for a "new" South Africa once flourished
following his release in February, dark despair now reigns.</p>
<p>"We don't know where we are going,"' says Phineas
Mthimkhulu, a Methodist minister who dodged several bullets
while assisting the injured during the hostel massacre. "Are
we going up or down, left or right?" He shrugs. "Who knows
anymore?"</p>
<p>Even the ANC, in an internal paper analyzing the violence,
expresses doubt. "We need to ask if South Africans are ready
to move in the direction of a new society. Are we ready to
think in a new way? Is it possible for us to talk of a new
South Africa or is it yet too early?"</p>
<p>Few have remained unscathed by the violence. Inkatha, the
conservative, capitalist antithesis of the socialist-oriented
ANC, can no longer profess its peaceful innocence after more
than 100 supporters, including its regional leader, were
arrested during the Sept. 4 hostel fight.</p>
<p>And the claims of propriety and impartiality by the
security forces -- who deny ANC charges that they aid Inkatha
-- are sounding ever more hollow after a judicial inquiry
ruled that police were "unjustified" in opening fire with
live ammunition on a crowd 30 yards away during the first
Sebokeng massacre on March 26.</p>
<p>Less than a week after that report was made public, the
army opened fired in Sebokeng on Sept. 4. Also, eyewitness
reports of the presence of masked whites in the hostel battle
has fueled suspicions that certain elements of the white
right wing are stirring up black animosities to derail the
government-ANC negotiations over a new constitution and
black-white power sharing.</p>
<p>The ugly appearance of black factional fighting, which has
crippled much of the rest of Africa, is also undermining the
efforts of the government to interest foreign investors in a
post-apartheid South Africa. Mr. de Klerk will be promoting
his reforms when he visits Washington later this month, but,
as he recently told South African businessmen, "There can be
no real reform before stability."</p>
<p>The greatest damage, though, has fallen on the ANC and on
the slender shoulders of the 72-year-old Mr. Mandela. The
unceasing violence, which spreads like an infectious plague
from one township to another in the Johannesburg area, has
exposed the ANC's leadership weaknesses as it emerges from 30
years of exile and makes the transition from liberation
movement to political party.</p>
<p>And Mr. Mandela's inability so far to defuse the factional
fighting has disappointed those who expected him to act more
like a statesman than an ANC cadre. Commentators here note
that his refusal to meet with Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi
as long as Inkatha "perpetuates violence" is precisely the
argument the government used in refusing to negotiate with
the ANC for three decades.</p>
<p>While the ANC's hierarchy has become a partner with the
government in shaping the country's future, grass-roots
supporters are still pursuing the ANC's revolutionary
strategy of making the country ungovernable through strikes,
boycotts and mass protest. In Sebokeng, for instance, youth
leaders still refer to different sectors of the township by
their revolutionary nicknames: Beirut, Nicaragua, Cuba,
Angola, Palestine, Libya, Moscow.</p>
<p>Although relative calm returned to the hostel area --
dubbed Vietnam -- after Mr. Mandela's visit, youths spent the
next few days roaming the Beirut section, blocking the
streets with boulders, hijacking cars and inviting several
clashes with police, who were quick to unleash tear gas. The
youths pointedly ignored Mr. Mandela's instruction to return
to school.</p>
<p>"Give us MK," says a teen-ager wearing a floppy "Coke is
it" hat. He is sitting on one of the boulders blocking the
road. "Give us Hani." Chris Hani, the Umkhonto we Sizwe
commander, is particularly popular among the youth.</p>
<p>The wave of violence began after the ANC suspended its
armed struggle on Aug. 6 in return for an agreement with the
government on the return of exiles and the release of
political prisoners. But as the killings mounted, so did
dissatisfaction and misunderstanding over the suspension. "A
desperate call for arms became deafening," says the ANC's
discussion paper. Some ANC officials, it notes, have been
reluctant to speak in the areas of unrest because they had no
answer to this demand.</p>
<p>"Generally speaking, the vision of unbreakable strength
{the ANC} had nurtured and earned over the years was dented,"
says the paper. "Instead, people felt the ANC was displaying
political paralysis and had fallen prey to de Klerk's sweet
talk."</p>
<p>Also dented is the ANC's decades-long struggle to overcome
the country's ethnic differences exacerbated by the
government's policies of racial segregation.</p>
<p>Although the ANC's membership includes blacks from all the
main tribes, as well as whites, Indians and coloreds (people
of mixed race), the top leadership is predominantly
Xhosa-speaking. The Xhosa image became more accentuated
during the 30 years of banning as the ANC became personified
by the jailed Mr. Mandela, who is a Xhosa.</p>
<p>Thus, when Inkatha, which is overwhelmingly Zulu, clashes
with the ANC, political differences are reduced, in many
minds, to a Zulu-Xhosa tribal war. Inkatha pamphlets urge
Zulus to resist Xhosa domination in any new government; ANC
supporters vow to "kill the Zulus."</p>
<p>Andrew Mapheto, an official in the ANC's Johannesburg
office who wrote the discussion paper, says he was once
almost attacked because he was driving a car with license
plates from Natal province, the home of the Zulus. He also
tells of two Zulu children who were killed when the family
home was bombed. On the day of the funeral, taxi drivers
refused to transport the mourners and local youths said the
cemetery wasn't open to Zulus. The family was told to bury
their dead in kwaZulu, the Zulu homeland.</p>
<p>Sebokeng and the surrounding black townships of what is
known as the Vaal Triangle have contributed two generations
of anti-apartheid martyrs. It was in neighboring Sharpeville,
in 1960, that police opened fire on a large group of
demonstrators. Later that year the ANC was banned and
Umkhonto we Sizwe was formed.</p>
<p>In 1984, a protest against township living conditions and
black local government was met by police fire, triggering a
nationwide wave of unrest and repression that led to the
state of emergency and the intensification of international
economic sanctions against Pretoria.</p>
<p>This year, on March 26, a few weeks before the first-ever
talks between the government and the ANC, Sebokeng residents
were again marching in protest against township conditions
when police again opened fire. More than a dozen people were
killed and 281 injured, many of them shot in the back.</p>
<p>Mr. Mandela rushed to Sebokeng and the ANC postponed the
start of negotiations, demanding an independent commission to
investigate police actions. It was that commission which
labeled the police shooting "unjustified."</p>
<p>On July 22, following an Inkatha rally to whip up support
in a solidly ANC area, Inkatha supporters armed with
traditional Zulu weapons such as spears and machetes clashed
with hostel residents, who are mostly Xhosa, Sotho and
Tswana. Dozens were killed and injured, and the small number
of Zulus who were living in the hostels were forced out.</p>
<p>Until then, residents of the hostels say, the various
tribes had gotten along fine. After the clash, the crowded
16-to-a-room hostels were filled with mistrust and tension.</p>
<p>This set the stage for the Sept. 4 predawn attack. The
night before, the police patrol that had been on duty around
the hostel since the earlier fighting was removed. This, the
ANC alleges, allowed Inkatha supporters to enter the hostel.
Mr. Mandela says that these circumstances, together with
witness accounts of white men fighting alongside the Zulus
that night, arouse the suspicion "of connivance between the
police and Inkatha." Both Inkatha and the police vehemently
deny this and reject claims they work in concert.</p>
<p>In order to defuse the tribal aspects of the fighting,
which the ANC says only helps those who want to see apartheid
entrenched, Mr. Mandela told the residents of Sebokeng that
they mustn't blame Inkatha alone. Revenge against Zulus, he
said, would play into the hands of "right-wing" elements who
want to see blacks fighting blacks. He told the people to
silence their calls for weapons, because arms would only give
the police and army more reason to shoot.</p>
<p>Still, tension blanketed the township. Despite Mr.
Mandela's assurances that he would hold the government
responsible for the killings, the fear of a fourth massacre
loomed.</p>
<p>"Most of our people accept what comrade Mandela says, but
they are very angry and afraid," says Maurice More, the
25-year-old president of the local South African Youth
Congress branch, which is allied with the ANC.</p>
<p>The telephone in his township office rings. A colleague
says police and army vans have been seen making their way to
Sebokeng. "Those of us who are activists are forced to be
vigilant, alert," says Mr. More, turning to look out the
window. "You never know what will happen."</p>
<p>Over in "Beirut," the township's militant teen-agers are
manning their roadblocks, making sure nobody who doesn't
belong here gets through. Police and army vehicles
occasionally roll over the boulders, lobbing tear gas
cannisters along the way. The youths scatter. Five minutes
later, they are back, checking the traffic.</p>
<p>Tear gas lingers over the Central Methodist Church,
located in the middle of Beirut. "One morning we'll wake up
and some of them will be dead," Joel January, the church
secretary, says of the youths. "I tell you, this is no life.
It isn't what we expected a couple of months ago."</p>
