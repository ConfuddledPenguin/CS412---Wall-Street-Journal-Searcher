	<p class="article-leader">The Marlboro Man is riding to the rescue of Mother Russia.
And Winston isn't far behind.
   To help alleviate the Soviet Union's worst cigarette
shortage in decades, Philip Morris Cos. and RJR Nabisco Inc.
have been asked by Moscow to supply 34 billion cigarettes,
the largest export order in either company's history. In
exchange for providing the smokes, the companies will receive
a combination of hard currency and barter items.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although Philip Morris wouldn't comment, analysts said the
agreement -- which calls for the company to supply 20 billion
smokes by year end 1991 -- could add between $50 million and
$100 million in operating profit to its international tobacco
business, which earned $1 billion last year. The value to
RJR, which will supply about 14 billion cigarettes by
September 1991, is expected to be about $40 million in
operating profit. RJR, which is controlled by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co., declined comment on that. Last year, RJR's
operating profit from tobacco exports totaled $328 million.</p>
<p>This summer, Soviet leaders have been trading blame for
what triggered a shortage of some 50 billion cigarettes --
one of numerous shortages of consumer goods caused by the
chaos of a shift to a market-based economy and away from
central planning.</p>
<p>Also, political difficulties in the Baltic republics have
resulted in shortages of cigarette filters, leaving Soviet
factories unable to produce enough cigarettes. Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov has previously said the gap wasn't the fault
of the central government but of provincial mismanagement. He
also blamed panic buying.</p>
<p>The Soviet government approached Philip Morris and RJR,
along with a number of other foreign concerns, about two
weeks ago. The Kremlin acted through the U.S. Commerce
Department after the cigarette crisis prompted street riots.
The collective Russian nicotine fit has been taken so
seriously by authorities that Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev recently fired a government minister who oversees
the industry.</p>
<p>The deal gives both Philip Morris and RJR hitherto
unimaginable access to the man on the street in the world's
third largest tobacco market, with 70 million smokers.</p>
<p>Until now, Philip Morris's Marlboros and other brands have
sold at a substantial premium in Russia, where they have only
been available in duty-free and hard-currency shops. The
company had been exporting 10 million cigarettes a month -- a
figure that will now jump to one billion. RJR said it
couldn't provide a precise estimate of its previous exports,
terming them "small."</p>
<p>"This is a major step to letting foreign cigarettes be
sold in normal cigarette kiosks," a Philip Morris spokesman
said. Added an RJR spokesman: "We think our American-blend
cigarettes will be very popular there -- this is a wonderful
opportunity for us."</p>
<p>Although pricing hasn't yet been set, the foreign smokes
are expected to be priced above Soviet cigarettes, which
typically sell for about 45 kopeks (72 cents) per pack. But
they are expected to be priced below their current premium
levels. In the wake of the summer shortage, Soviet news
reports said that a pack of Marlboros would bring up to 20
rubles ($32) on the black market in Moscow.</p>
<p>RJR wouldn't discuss pricing, terming the subject
"proprietary at this time."</p>
<p>But if Marlboros are coming, Madison Avenue isn't. The
Soviet Union doesn't allow media or billboard advertising,
though it does permit a very limited amount of point-of-sale
ad displays and some sponsorship. Although Philip Morris has
done neither until now, the company spokesman said that "if
there is any, it will be very limited point-of-sale telling
the Russians these cigarettes are available."</p>
<p>A RJR spokesman said the cigarette deal yesterday "all
happened so fast that we're not sure yet how we'll be
marketing it."</p>
<p>Analysts reacted enthusiastically to both deals. "This is
a footstep into a huge potential market," said Diana Temple,
an analyst at Salomon Brothers. Soviet smokers puff 400
billion cigarettes annually.</p>
<p>"This will sap up a lot of capacity which is created by
declining consumption in the U.S.," added Marc Cohen of
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. "To the degree this Russian
business is attractive and representative of growth that
companies can find overseas, it's going to be constructive
for the fundamentals of U.S. tobacco makers."</p>
<p>In another move that bolsters Philip Morris's presence in
Eastern Europe, the company recently bought the largest East
German cigarette factory. The transaction, which will be
completed in October, will give the company 40% of the East
German market.</p>
<p>Beyond the 20 billion smokes, Philip Morris will continue
to supply "significant quantities" of cigarettes to the
Soviet Union from 1992 to 1995. The company will also help
the state agencies of the U.S.S.R. and the Russian Republic
to develop the Soviet cigarette industry.</p>
<p>For its part, RJR earlier this year signed an agreement
with the Uritsky cigarette factory in Leningrad to begin
producing Winston cigarettes by early 1991.</p>
<p>In an effort to calm jittery Russians until the foreign
cigarettes arrive, government officials have undertaken some
stopgap measures. City authorities in Moscow recently
imported two million packs of Bulgarian cigarettes. They sold
out in a morning.</p>
