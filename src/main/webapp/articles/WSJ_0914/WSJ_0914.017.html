   In Auto Rental Fleets</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CAR RENTERS have something new to think about when they
pick a company: air bags.</p>
<p>Like auto makers, several rental car companies are rushing
to make the safety feature a much bigger part of their
fleets. Dollar Rent A Car Systems says about half of its cars
will have them in the 1991 season, which begins next month;
that's more than triple its current proportion. Hertz and
National Car Rental System also will have about half of their
fleets equipped with air bags, while Thrifty Car Rental says
80% of its cars will have them, up from 50% this season.</p>
<p>Thrifty isn't shy about promoting the feature. In one new
TV ad about the air bags, a woman drives nervously in a
rainstorm while a narrator intones: "At Thrifty, we care as
much about safety as we do savings."</p>
<p>Maybe so, but industry observers say a rental company's
interest in air bags is driven mainly by who owns it.
Chrysler recently bought both Dollar and Thrifty, and almost
all Chrysler cars have air bags. Ownership doesn't determine
which auto maker a rental company will buy from, but
certainly influences it.</p>
<p>"It's not like the companies are going out and putting air
bags in their cars," says Dan Rubin, editor of Auto Rental
News. "The fleets they have happen to have them."</p>
<p>By the same token, Avis is 25%-owned by General Motors,
whose lines don't have a lot of air bags. Avis says it will
have air bags in only a quarter of its 1991 fleet.</p>
<p>Most rental companies won't be able to guarantee that any
one customer will get a car with an air bag. Still, many
observers think the availability of air bags will heavily
affect consumer choice. "For a lot of people, one car rental
company is the same as another," says Harold Seligman,
president of Management Alternatives, a corporate travel
consultant in Stamford, Conn. "This differentiates them."</p>
<p>Phoning From Runway</p>
<p>May Get Easier for Fliers</p>
<p>TRAVELERS who carry their own cellular telephones may
finally get a chance to use them when their plane is stuck on
the ground.</p>
<p>Currently, the Federal Communications Commission prohibits
these phones from being used in airplanes, whether on the
ground or in the air. So, the only way to make a call is to
use airline on-board phones, at a cost of $2 a minute. That's
profitable for the airlines, but it has long angered cellular
phone users.</p>
<p>The FCC says the phones can't be used in the air because
they interfere with calls by earthbound cellular phone users.
"We banned them on the ground because we figured people
wouldn't hang up when their flight took off," says Steve
Markendorff, the FCC's chief of the cellular radio branch.</p>
<p>But the agency is reconsidering its position for ground
use. Airlines say the phones can interfere with a pilot's
communication system even on the ground. But cellular phone
companies say the airlines haven't proved this. And so far,
the Federal Aviation Administration says cellular phones
don't seem to pose a risk when they're used on the ground.
"They're not a concern for us," says an FAA spokesman.</p>
<p>Airline Security Often</p>
<p>Isn't a Full-Time Job</p>
<p>AIRLINES TALK a lot about having tough security. But USAir
has a full-time security staff of just 13 employees. Delta
Air Lines has eight. And United Airlines, the nation's
largest carrier, has four.</p>
<p>Of course, airlines contract with hundreds of people to
handle security-related matters, such as X-raying baggage at
airports. They also train many employees on security matters.
But many security specialists say the airlines' staffs are
deplorably low, since they're supposed to help carriers deal
with hijackings, drug smuggling and terrorist acts.</p>
<p>"When you realize how few people they really have, it's
sort of scary," says Denis Day of the Day Partnership, a
travel consultant in Oak Brook, Ill.</p>
<p>Because the staffs are so small, security specialists say,
airlines don't have the contacts they need with local airport
police. In case of real emergencies, many carriers may have
only regular employees working with law enforcement
officials. "If there's a bomb threat," says Steve Gardella, a
security consultant in San Diego, "do you want some
professional helping to handle that, or some guy who's taken
a few security courses?"</p>
<p>Airlines say their staffs are adequate and that few
incidents have occurred in recent years. "To some degree, we
have to rely on the local and federal police agencies," says
Jim Goodwin, senior vice president of services planning for
United. He notes that the carrier recently doubled its staff
-- to four from two.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>SINCE THE Persian Gulf crisis erupted last month, American
Express says sales of traveler's checks in the region are
growing three times faster than usual. Apparently, residents
and travelers there are worried about having their cash and
other assets taken in a war or political takeover. . . . When
it comes to on-time performance, the smaller the better.
Since the government began keeping records three years ago,
tiny America West Airlines and Southwest Airlines have had
the best and second-best overall records, respectively.
Larger competitors claim these carriers do well because their
hubs are in goodweather spots. But that doesn't seem to apply
to Alaska Airlines, a small carrier that flies to a lot of
foggy, snowy cities and has ranked fourth since 1987.</p>
