	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Reports that budget negotiators are
considering increases in Medicare premiums have touched off a
pre-emptive attack that illustrates the political perils any
deficit-reduction plan will face in Congress.
   In the face of gathering opposition within Congress and
from senior citizen's groups, there were reports from the
closed-door budget negotiations late yesterday that
negotiators had scaled back initial plans to boost Medicare
premiums by as much as $3.9 billion next year and $40.8
billion over five years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the initial proposal, once nervously supported by both
Democrats and Republicans at the budget summit, may have
poisoned the well for other efforts to make 33 million
elderly and disabled beneficiaries pay higher premiums for
their federal health benefits.</p>
<p>"This kind of proposal, even it's withdrawn, probably
makes it harder for the summiteers to encourage everyone to
do their fair share" as part of an effort to achieve $500
billion in budget cuts over five years, said Martin Corry,
director of federal relations at the American Association of
Retired Persons, the nation's largest senior-citizens group.</p>
<p>Horace Deets, AARP's executive director, said, "We've been
answering a steady stream of calls. People are incredulous.
They just don't understand this."</p>
<p>The rapid response to the Medicare proposal, first
described in press reports Wednesday, is only one of a
widening tide of protests over the plans being worked out by
budget negotiators.</p>
<p>For example, all 34 members of the New York House
delegation wrote Majority Leader Thomas Foley and Minority
Leader Robert Michel asking them to oppose a Republican
effort to limit the deductibility of state and local taxes.</p>
<p>And George Gould, chief lobbyist for the National
Association of Letter Carriers, said that the union is
threatening to stop making campaign contributions to members
of Congress who vote for a deficit-reduction measure that
includes a proposal to slow the growth of federal pensions.
Part of the budget plan, which is still subject to change,
would cancel the next cost of living increase for federal
employees and hold future increases to less than the rate of
inflation.</p>
<p>The American Medical Association is worried about proposed
Medicare cuts that could cost hospitals and doctors $3.4
billion in fiscal 1991, which starts Oct. 1, and a total of
$31.5 billion over five years. But one of the provisions that
irritates the AMA the most is a relatively low-cost change --
a proposal to charge doctors $1 for each Medicare form they
file by mail, rather than electronically. The $300 million
revenue generator would hurt rural doctors in particular, the
AMA argues. "We definitely will oppose those kinds of
things," an AMA official says.</p>
<p>Every deficit-reduction measure that's taken out of the
package will have to be replaced with something else, unless
the Congressional and White House negotiators trim their
targets of $50 billion in cuts in fiscal 1991 and $500
billion over five years.</p>
<p>Many analysts believe that substantial adjustments are
necessary to slow the rapidly growing cost of the $105
billion-a-year Medicare program. But the politics are
treacherous.</p>
<p>"I don't know how they could even consider a capital-gains
tax cut when they're sticking it to seniors like this" with a
proposed premium increase, says William Ritz, public affairs
director of the National Committee to Preserve Social
Security and Medicare. The committee led the fight to repeal
the law extending Medicare to cover catastrophic illnesses,
along with the surtax the law imposed on some senior
taxpayers.</p>
