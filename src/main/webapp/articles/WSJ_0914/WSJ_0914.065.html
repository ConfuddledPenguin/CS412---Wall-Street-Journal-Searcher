	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- JPS Textile Group Inc., after numerous failed
attempts to persuade bondholders, said it terminated its
offers to buy and exchange about $450 million of its notes
and preferred.
   The company, which initiated the offers July 20 and had
extended them to Sept. 20, said it would be "impracticable"
to continue the offers because a majority of the debt holders
"do not favor them."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest setback for the debt-ridden textile concern
signals a growing reluctance of bondholders to refinance debt
on terms available in today's deflated markets.</p>
<p>The company said yesterday that "financial alternatives to
the offers are being explored," including the possibility of
exchanging equity in the company for the notes and shares.</p>
<p>The action comes only a week after JPS extended its offer
for the seventh time, sweetening the offer for some notes and
shares. But few bondholders were swayed, and many instead
sought exchange offers in which interest rates on the debt
securities would be reduced in exchange for newly issued
equity. "Discussions with representatives of the debt holders
are expected to continue," JPS said.</p>
<p>JPS had hoped to use the proceeds to repay debt that it
incurred when it acquired J.P. Stevens & Co., a maker of
textiles and related products, for $579 million in 1988. JPS
sold the notes and shares to help finance the acquisition.</p>
<p>The company was offering, for each $1,000 principal amount
of its notes outstanding, $850 for the senior notes; $190.22
and 1.7 JPS common shares for discount notes; and $400 plus
1.45 JPS shares for subordinated notes. JPS also offered to
exchange $1,000 principal amount of its 6% debentures and
1.21 JPS shares for each $1,000 principal amount of its
subordinated debt outstanding. In addition, the company was
offering $10 for each preferred Series A share.</p>
<p>The company said that although about $1.6 million
principal amount of senior notes outstanding had been
tendered as of Sept. 6, no other securities had been
tendered.</p>
