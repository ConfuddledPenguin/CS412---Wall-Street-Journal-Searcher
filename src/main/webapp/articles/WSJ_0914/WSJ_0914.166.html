	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Congress approved legislation increasing the
planned size of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to one
billion barrels from 750 million and setting up a pilot
refined-product reserve.
   The measure was approved 391-0 in the House and by voice
vote in the Senate. The Bush administration had threatened a
veto over the billion-barrel size, but aides said yesterday
that the president is expected to sign the measure.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Separately, Energy Secretary James Watkins told the Senate
Energy Committee that, despite concerns about refinery
capacity, the administration expects the nation to be able to
get through the rest of the year without experiencing
significant shortages of oil or refined products. But he
added that the next meeting of the International Energy
Agency on Sept. 26 will be "very key" in determining whether
a multilateral drawdown of emergency oil stockpiles is
needed.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Watkins unveiled a set of measures
designed to boost domestic energy production and spur
conservation. With this package, the department's efforts to
date are aimed at offsetting the loss of more than 1.1
million barrels of oil daily by the end of 1991.</p>
<p>Separately, the Environmental Protection Agency released
an analysis showing that clean-air legislation pending before
a House-Senate conference committee would save 800,000 to one
million barrels of oil a day by the year 2005, when the
provisions are fully in place. Of this amount, 300,000 to
500,000 barrels would come from utilities' switching to
natural gas from oil to meet requirements under sections of
the bill aimed at curbing acid rain. The rest would result
from provisions requiring cleaner-burning fuels and the use
of nongasoline-powered fleet vehicles and cars in some
cities.</p>
<p>The legislation authorizing the continued buildup of the
reserve doesn't set a deadline for filling it, which
currently contains about 590 million barrels of oil that the
goverment began stockpiling in salt domes in Louisiana and
Texas in response to the 1973-1974 Arab oil embargo. The 750
million mark was to have been reached by the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>The legislation also gives the administration additional
flexibility to conduct a test of the SPR, something some
lawmakers and oil-industry officials have been clamoring for
to ensure that in the event of an emergency, any drawdown of
oil would go smoothly. It also provides for a program in
which the Energy Department would set up one or more reserves
that would be separate from the SPR and contain a refined
product, such as gasoline.</p>
<p>In increasing the reserve, the legislation also allows the
U.S. to begin leasing some of the crude oil as a way to
reduce the costs of filling it. In addition, it gives the
president the authority to order a limited drawdown of the
SPR to deal with a domestic disruption.</p>
<p>In his Energy Committee testimony, Secretary Watkins said,
"I do believe we can manage" during the fourth quarter
without serious shortages. He referred to the time between
now and the end of the year as a "transitional period" when
efforts to increase production and conservation are taking
hold at the same time demand is increasing as winter
approaches.</p>
<p>Still, he said the administration is "very concerned about
the ability of refiners to continue operating at near-maximum
capacity for an extended period of time." Moreover, he said
there is a problem with the quality of oil coming on line to
replace the lost Iraq and Kuwait crude and with the
distribution of supplies. Currently, he said, gasoline
inventories are tight but adequate.</p>
<p>In his testimony, Mr. Watkins said that "right now we
don't see any across-the-board gross unfairness" by oil
companies in responding to the Mideast crisis, though he
added that "a few percent" are always going to try to take
advantage of the situation. So far, he said, there has been
just a "normal market response."</p>
<p>Mr. Watkins said the various measures the department has
designed to increase domestic energy production and encourage
industry to switch to natural gas or other fuels would offset
607,500 barrels of oil a day. Among major provisions, the
department will work to resolve a problem over permits that
is holding up production in the Beaufort Sea north of Alaska.
In addition, the department urged Congress to open the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge for exploration.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Watkins said the agency would work to
expedite various natural-gas pipeline projects. He said the
department wants to remove regulatory barriers that prevent
the delivery of natural gas to California, where it could be
used to recover hard-to-get oil.</p>
<p>The department also wants to speed the permit process of
waste-to-energy plants and accelerate the conversion of the
federal automobile fleet to non-gasoline fuels. As a first
step, Mr. Watkins announced the award of a $910,740 contract
to Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. to provide 65
vehicles that can run on either gasoline or an alternative
fuel.</p>
<p>The conservation measures are aimed at saving 530,000
barrels of oil a day. Mr. Watkins said the nation could save
30,000 to 80,000 barrels of oil each day by reducing the
average octane level to 87 from 88.5. Octane measures an
engine's anti-knock capabilities.</p>
