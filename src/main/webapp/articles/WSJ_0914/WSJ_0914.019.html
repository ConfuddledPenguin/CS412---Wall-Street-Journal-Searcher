	<p class="article-leader">MURRAY HILL, N.J. -- C.R. Bard Inc. said it agreed to sell
its Shield Healthcare Centers subsidiaries to a U.S.
subsidiary of Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co., a privately held
maker of household and medical products based in Osaka,
Japan.
   Shield Healthcare, which has centers primarily in the Los
Angeles area, sells medical supplies and equipment for home
patient care. Bard, a health care products concern, said it
will realize a one-time after-tax gain of several million
dollars on the sale, with funds to be used to reduce Bard's
short-term debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Shield subsidiaries had combined sales of
approximately $30 million in 1989. The acquisition is
expected to be completed by Sept. 30.</p>
<p>C.R. Bard has struggled since last year when it was forced
to temporarily withdraw coronary balloon angioplasty
catheters from the U.S. market; the catheters are used as an
alternative to bypass surgery to open blocked arteries.</p>
<p>For the second quarter, C.R. Bard's net income fell 54% to
$10.1 million, or 19 cents a share, from $21.8 million or 39
cents a share. Sales fell 3% to $194.1 million from $201
million.</p>
