	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Takeover investor Carl Icahn won an unusual
auction for a key real estate holding of Integrated Resources
Inc., the formerly highflying tax-shelter company that sought
bankruptcy-law protection last year.
   In an auction in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here, Mr. Icahn
outbid a partnership that includes Meshulam Riklis, another
aggressive investor, by offering $44 million for American
Property Investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By buying API, Mr. Icahn will get control of American Real
Estate Partners L.P., a publicly traded company that owns and
runs some 300 real estate properties assembled by Integrated.
Estimates of the properties' value range widely, between $300
million and $500 million. API is the general partner and 10%
owner of American Real Estate Partners.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Icahn and Mr. Riklis were longtime clients of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the securities firm that helped
Integrated expand rapidly in the mid-1980s via sales of
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds.</p>
<p>With the collapse of both Integrated and Drexel in the
past 15 months, some of Drexel's former clients, such as
Messrs. Icahn and Riklis, are apparently poised to swoop down
and pick up some of the pieces.</p>
<p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. Icahn said he plans to use
his investment in API to get "much more involved in real
estate." He said he sees "very good opportunities in the next
decade because of all the real estate for sale." When
"everyone else is getting out," he said, "that's usually the
time to get in."</p>
<p>But some holders of AREP partnership units voiced fears
that Mr. Icahn would attempt to exploit his control of the
assets at their expense. They said, for example, that Mr.
Icahn as general partner might cut the current $2-per-unit
dividend that now offers investors a hefty 20% annual return.</p>
<p>The holders noted that Mr. Icahn was paying three times
the market value of all of AREP for only a 10% stake plus
control via the general partnership. AREP has 1.4 million
units outstanding, valued at a total of $14 million based on
yesterday's closing price of $10 apiece, up 25 cents, in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>In addition, they said, the AREP structure allows the
general partner to buy and sell partnership properties,
giving Mr. Icahn in effect the right to negotiate deals with
himself or his affiliates. The holders said that could allow
Mr. Icahn to acquire some AREP properties for himself, or
sell properties to AREP, on terms favorable to himself and
unfavorable to other AREP holders.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn, based in Mount Kisco, N.Y., owns 90% of Trans
World Airlines Inc. and has been trying to sell the carrier's
assets, either in whole or in part, to get out from under its
debt load.</p>
<p>Responding to the unit holders' concerns, Mr. Icahn said
investors in three other companies he has acquired, ACF
Industries, TWA, and Bayswater Realty, have done well. "My
record speaks for itself," he said. "I've never taken
advantage of the shareholders. I've always bent over
backwards to be careful with that."</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn's firm, Meadowstar Holding Co., won the auction,
conducted by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard C. Buschman III.
His $44 million offer topped a $43.5 million bid from Sterik
Co., one of whose general partners is Mr. Riklis. Sterik,
based in Auburndale, Mass., owns properties.</p>
<p>Also bidding for the Integrated unit was Oppenheimer &
Bigelow Income Fund I, which submitted offers of $36 million
and $40 million, each with different terms. O&B Income Fund I
has sued both API and AREP, seeking to block the sale of AREP
without the consent of a majority of the partnership units.</p>
<p>Integrated is trying to raise funds to pay creditors who
hold some $1.8 billion in debt. Before the auction,
Integrated had agreed to sell API to Sterik for $40 million.
One of Integrated's other principal assets is a mortgage
investment unit.</p>
<p>Judge Buschman asked that any objections to the sale be
filed in court by Monday. On Tuesday, an Icahn representative
is due to be questioned in a deposition on how he plans to
capitalize the new general partner, and on his plans for
AREP. The next court hearing in the case is slated for Sept.
28.</p>
