	<p class="article-leader">Champion International Corp. said it trimmed capital
spending plans to $750 million a year from $900 million to $1
billion annually for projected spending in 1991 and 1992.
   Andrew C. Sigler, chairman and chief executive officer,
said in Stamford, Conn., "we have nearly completed the group
of major projects we announced several years ago, and with
the likelihood of a softer economy ahead, this was a logical
place to defer the other three projects."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The projects being deferred involve the planned conversion
of the company's brown paper mill in Roanoke Rapids, N.C., to
a white paper mill, the installation of an additional
lightweight coated publications papers machine and
construction of a new pulp mill in Brazil.</p>
<p>Champion is a paper, plywood and lumber company.</p>
