	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices took a dive under pressure from
program selling that was sparked by a midday jump in oil
prices and a rumor of war.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 43.07 points in
light trading to 2582.67, the lowest level since 2532.92 on
Aug. 24. The dollar was sharply lower for the second
consecutive day, this time because comments by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan heightened traders'
expectation that U.S. interest rates will drop soon. But bond
traders weren't inspired; bond prices edged lower in very
quiet trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Peter Grennan, head of stock-index futures trading at
Shearson Lehman Brothers, said the September futures contract
on Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell to its lowest level
since Labor Day as the October crude oil futures contract
surged to $31.45 a barrel; the contract fell back to end at
$31.07, up 10 cents.</p>
<p>The drop in stock-index futures dashed some investors'
hopes that stock prices were poised to move up. It also
attracted program traders, who swooped in to capture profits
by buying the cheaper futures and selling stocks.</p>
<p>Mr. Grennan noted this was the fourth consecutive Thursday
the market posted a substantial loss. Previously, the heavy
selling had been on three successive Fridays. Mr. Grennan
said investors may be trying to beat each other out the door
so they aren't hurt by any Mideast developments or other
surprises over the weekend.</p>
<p>Adding to the downward pressure on stocks, traders said,
was an unfounded midafternoon rumor, apparently originating
in commodities futures pits, that a television news program
reported Mideast war would erupt within hours.</p>
<p>Trading in the dollar was relatively quiet until Mr.
Greenspan told the House Banking Committee that the Fed would
likely push interest rates lower if Congress and the Bush
administration produced a credible pact to cut the U.S.
budget deficit. That remark sparked a sell-off, which
deepened when the Fed chairman went on to acknowledge that
the U.S. banking system is facing serious problems.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices fell. Volume was 123.4 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues swamped
advancers 1,009 to 430.</p>
<p>Bond prices eased nearly 1/8 point, or almost $1.25 for
each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond rose slightly to 8.96%.</p>
<p>The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5677 marks and 136.20 yen, compared with
1.5913 marks and 138.09 yen Wednesday.</p>
