	<p class="article-leader">A New Jersey engineering firm sued the Iraqi government in
what is apparently the first attempt by a U.S. litigant to
claim a portion of Iraq's frozen assets.
   In its complaint filed in federal district court in
Washington, Consarc Corp. of Rancocas, N.J., and its British
subsidiary seek $62 million in actual and punitive damages
resulting from the collapse of an $11 million transaction to
supply Iraq's Ministry of Industry and Minerals with several
industrial furnaces. Consarc charged that the deal came apart
because Iraq "misrepresented" the purpose for which the
equipment was being bought.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Iraqis certified early last year that the furnaces
would be used to make artificial limbs for victims of the
Iran-Iraq war. Last June, however, U.S. authorities blocked
the shipment because of suspicions that the ovens could be
used instead to fabricate parts for nuclear devices. The
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait later prompted President Bush to
freeze all U.S. transactions with Baghdad, including that for
the Consarc furnaces.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department indicated that Consarc is the
first U.S. business or individual to be given a license to
seek recovery of Iraqi assets. All such litigants require the
permission of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets
Control.</p>
<p>The Consarc suit also named the state-owned Rafidain Bank
Iraq; Pittsburgh National Bank, a unit of PNC Financial
Corp.; and the Royal Bank of Scotland as defendants. Rafidain
holds blocked accounts relating to the Consarc contract in
New York and London, while the Pittsburgh and Scottish banks
handled letters of credit related to the financial
transactions, according to the suit. Officials of Pittsburgh
National Bank said they hadn't seen the suit and declined to
comment. Royal Bank of Scotland couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>Consarc's British subsidiary, Consarc Engineering Ltd.,
was to have supplied part of the aborted Iraqi order.</p>
<p>It isn't known whether Iraq will contest the suit. The
Iraqi Embassy didn't answer telephone calls yesterday.
However, shortly after the U.S. froze the Consarc shipments,
Ambassador Sadiq Al-Mashat said the U.S. suspicions were
"completely without basis."</p>
<p>Consarc could win its case by default if the Iraqis choose
not to respond to it, said lawyers familiar with the
complaint.</p>

<p>COURT OVERTURNS BAN on selling book about Israeli
intelligence service.</p>
<p>The appellate division of the New York Supreme Court
yesterday lifted an order barring St. Martin's Press from
selling "By Way of Deception: The Making and Unmaking of a
Mossad Officer." The book was written by Victor Ostrovsky,
who is now in hiding in Canada and claims he spent two years
as a Mossad agent.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, State Supreme Court Justice Michael J.
Dontzin signed an order temporarily halting the sale of the
book and ordered the New York publishing house to recall
approximately 18,000 copies that had already been shipped.</p>
<p>A four-judge appellate panel ruled that the Israeli
government had failed to demonstrate that the lives of its
agents would be endangered by the book's publication.</p>
<p>The Israeli government "has failed to overcome the heavy
presumption against prior restraint on publication," the
panel wrote. The panel noted that the distribution of the
book to 1,500 wholesalers, as well as to book reviewers at
major publications, meant that the order would be
ineffective.</p>
<p>David N. Kaye, a lawyer for St. Martin's, said that the
company immediately began shipping copies of the book to
stores yesterday, and that there would shortly be 150,000
copies in print.</p>
<p>Jonathan Lerner, a lawyer for the Israeli government, said
it is unlikely his client will seek a further review. But he
said Israel may pursue an action seeking damages against St.
Martin's.</p>
<p>"If St. Martin's knew, or should have known, that Mr.
Ostrovsky was under contract not to publish any secrets, then
the proceeds from the publication of the book should go to
the Israeli treasury," said Mr. Lerner, a lawyer with the New
York law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.</p>

<p>SUIT FILED AGAINST ELI LILLY makes allegations about
Prozac.</p>
<p>The son of a man who killed eight people sued Eli Lilly &
Co., the maker of the anti-depressant drug Prozac, which his
father was taking. In the suit, James Thomas Wesbecker
alleged that Lilly failed to test properly Prozac and should
have known that it was unsafe for use for the treatment of
depression.</p>
<p>Joseph Wesbecker entered the Standard Gravure printing
plant on Sept. 14, 1989, killed eight people and wounded 12
before killing himself. Mr. Wesbecker, on medical leave from
the Louisville, Ky., company, was on Prozac for five weeks
before the shootings.</p>
<p>The law suit, filed in Jefferson Circuit Court in
Louisville, is among the first to blame criminal behavior on
Prozac, widely acclaimed as an especially safe and effective
anti-depressant. Other defendants in the case include Dista
Products Co., a unit of Lilly, and Mr. Wesbecker's former
psychiatrist, Dr. Lee Coleman. Five other parties involved in
the Wesbecker shootings have filed suits against Mr.
Wesbecker's estate, Lilly and others. A one-year statute of
limitations will expire today.</p>
<p>A number of lawyers recently have started trying to use
what they are calling a Prozac defense to prove that the drug
made their clients commit murder and should not be held
responsible, said Michael O'Brien, director of research for
the Citizens Commission on Human Rights, a Los Angeles group
established by the Church of Scientology that wants Prozac
removed from the market.</p>
<p>Last week, for example, a Utah judge ordered Joseph
Charles Gardner to undergo a psychiatric evaluation to
determine whether he was influenced by Prozac when he fatally
shot Janice Fondren last July, said Alan D. Boyack, the St.
George, Utah, lawyer representing Mr. Gardner.</p>
<p>The suits have been sparked by a report in the February
issue of the American Journal of Psychiatry by Martin
Teicher, a Harvard University psychiatrist. The article
identified six people who developed violent suicidal thoughts
while taking Prozac. None had previously experienced such
thoughts, the article reported.</p>
<p>Edward West, a spokesman for Indianapolis-based Lilly,
said more than 11,000 people participated in clinical trials
of Prozac, which was approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in 1987, and more than two million patients
world-wide have been treated with the drug.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, assaultive behavior is common in our
society. Mr. Wesbecker had a lengthy history of psychiatric
disturbance, including suicide attempts and homicidal
threats, prior to taking Prozac. Other drugs were found in
Mr. Wesbecker's blood following his death," Mr. West said.
Dr. Coleman couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' lawyers acknowledge it is difficult to
determine whether Prozac or their clients' underlying mental
problems caused their behavior. But Leonard L. Finz, the
lawyer for Mr. Wesbecker's son, said that despite Mr.
Wesbecker's psychiatric history, he had never committed acts
of violence prior to taking Prozac.</p>

<p>PUBLISHERS TEAM UP in case involving unauthorized
anthologies.</p>
<p>The trial, which pits eight of the biggest U.S. book
publishers against Kinko's Graphics Corp., a photocopying
chain, began this week. A decision in the closely watched
case before federal Judge Constance Baker Motley in Manhattan
could clarify the legal use of copyrighted material for
educational purposes.</p>
<p>At issue is the growing business of photocopying excerpts
from college textbooks and then compiling them in customized
versions to be sold to a professor's class. As a result, the
professor can assign chapters from several sources without
requiring students to buy each book.</p>
<p>Kinko's, a 520-store chain based in Ventura, Calif.,
defends its service as a practical way to meet students'
educational needs. The publishers, however, seeking to
protect their $2 billion-a-year college-textbook market, want
Judge Motley to rule that such anthologies violate the
copyright law and should be banned.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs are Harper & Row Publishers Inc.,
McGraw-Hill Inc., Penguin Books U.S.A. Inc., Prentice-Hall
Inc., Richard D. Irwin Inc., William Morrow Co., Basic Books
Inc. and John Wiley & Sons Inc.</p>
<p>Both the publishers and Kinko's "are in a marketplace
competing for student dollars," said Ronald Rauchberg, an
attorney for the publishers, in opening arguments earlier
this week. "The plaintiffs do it with respect for the
copyright laws, paying royalties to the authors who create
these books. Kinko's doesn't do it that way."</p>
<p>Kinko's says it's merely following the practices that have
been prevalent on college campuses for years and accused
publishers of trying to gouge students.</p>
<p>"It would cost a fortune for a student" to buy all the
textbooks used in one anthology," said Dean Olds, an attorney
for Kinko's, in his opening statement. "If {the court's
decision} deprives the students of this smorgasbord of
sources . . . their educational process is going to suffer."</p>

<p>THE TEAMSTERS HAVE RETAINED a new lawyer.</p>
<p>Brendan Sullivan of the Washington law firm of Williams &
Connolly has been tapped by the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, according to people familiar with the union.</p>
<p>For the past two years, the Teamsters union, the nation's
largest union, has been represented by lawyers at the New
York law firm of Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander & Ferdon.
The firm has challenged the government's authority to oversee
union affairs under the terms of a 1989 settlement of
racketeering charges brought by the U.S. attorney in
Manhattan.</p>
<p>But in recent weeks, say Teamsters insiders, Teamsters
President William J. McCarthy has expressed dismay over the
law firm's failure to win on any of its motions involving the
settlement. Other members of the Teamsters executive board
pressured Mr. McCarthy to replace Mudge Rose when it became
public that the union paid the firm nearly $6 million,
according to people familiar with the change.</p>
<p>Mr. Sullivan has represented Oliver North. Williams &
Connolly represented former Teamsters President Jimmy Hoffa,
as well as former United Mine Workers President Tony Boyle,
who went to prison for the murder of a man who challenged his
leadership.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>FORMER MONEY MANAGER Peter Jeffer pleaded guilty to one
count of wire fraud in connection with an alleged
insider-trading ring. He was accused of trading on
information he received from Steven Glauberman, a former
associate at Skadden Arps. Mr. Jeffer, who is cooperating
with prosecutors in the case, entered his plea before Judge
Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum in federal court in Manhattan. Mr.
Glauberman pleaded guilty to three insider-trading-related
counts Wednesday.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A THIRD OFFICER of a New Jersey company pleads guilty to
bank fraud.</p>
<p>Richard Bober, former vice president, secretary and
director of Coated Sales Inc., pleaded guilty in federal
court in Newark, N.J., to charges involving a fraud scheme
that netted him $12 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Bober admitted that he and other officers of the
defunct textile converting company lied about the amount of
the company's assets to secure a $52 million restructuring
loan from BancBoston Financial Co. He also admitted to
violating U.S. securities laws.</p>
<p>Martin Greenberg, Mr. Bober's attorney, said, "Mr. Bober
is anxious to have this matter put behind him and is
cooperating with the government."</p>
<p>Shortly before Coated Sales filed for bankruptcy-law
protection in June 1988, it was considered one of the
fastest-growing companies traded on the over-the-counter
market, according to U.S. attorney Michael Chertoff.</p>
