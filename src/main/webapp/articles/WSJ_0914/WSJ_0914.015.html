	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Newly formed Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. plans to
cut 400 workers in France through a combination of early
retirement and payroll cutbacks, a French union claimed.
   The company declined to comment, but said its governing
board is scheduled to meet today in Paris and that a news
conference will be called next week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail (CFDT)
said the company, created in July through the merger of
Rhone-Poulenc's human health division and Rorer Group Inc. of
the U.S., said the cuts would affect a variety of sites in
France, including plants in Hauts-de-Seine and
Seine-Maritime, as well as six factories of the Propharm S.A.
unit. The CFDT said Rhone-Poulenc Rorer also intends to sell
its factory in Monts, close to Tours.</p>
