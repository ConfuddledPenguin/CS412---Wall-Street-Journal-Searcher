	<p class="article-leader">Los Angeles -- The 1990 Los Angeles Festival was doomed to
be political from the start: "We looked for the most overtly
political and most overtly spiritual work we thought we could
get away with presenting," said associate director Norman
Frisch. Festival director Peter Sellars was determined to
break away from European-based art forms, like those that had
so dazzled visitors at the last two festivals, in 1984 and
1987. He promised to pay more respect to California's rich
new ethnic mix, and help us all to sail out on a great rising
wave of New Age spiritualism, by inviting exclusively
non-European-based, preferably aboriginal, artists from
countries of what is now ominously called the Pacific Rim.
   Major live performances at the festival -- if one may be
permitted that elitist distinction -- were held not at public
parks but at scattered formal arenas, most of them small, for
which admission (as much as $40) was charged. In the 16 days
of the festival, one might see a dozen such ticketed events;
over Labor Day weekend, I saw three. The incomparable court
performers from the Yogyakarta Palace in Java -- now
traveling elsewhere in the U.S. -- are as disciplined, as
out-and-out beautiful a dance and music group as I have ever
seen. "Legend of the Water Flame" -- also touring to New York
-- is a short, stark, high-intensity modernist creation by
several Japanese living cultural treasures, transcendentally
performed by flutist Michiko Akao, actress Kayoko Shiraishi
and percussionist Yasunori Yamaguchi. I also caught the
latest (1987+) offering of New York's avant-avant-garde
Wooster Group -- not quite Pacific Rim, but good friends of
Mr. Sellars, who gave them the idea for the show in the first
place. In it, they superimpose texts, flesh, media and
theatrical styles on a dark, messy high-tech set, in a way
that intentionally and intensely makes no sense at all.
Complex, tautly controlled and largely unintelligible, of and
for the elect, events like these stand at an opposite pole
from the populist, accessible (and free) folk/ethnic
performances that were the festival's primary raison d'etre.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The opening ceremonies on Saturday, arranged as a kind of
multitribal religious ritual, were held below a giant Korean
bell hung in a temple-pavilion at Angels Gate Park, which
dramatically overlooks the Theme Ocean. (At the end, the bell
was rung seven times, for the four points of the compass,
Mother Earth, Father Sky and the Spirit Within. Agnostics
weren't sure how to respond.) We were first blessed and
welcomed by representatives of local Indian tribes, the
people, we were reminded, on whose turf we were all sitting.
There followed long, awkward introductions and short, sharp
performances by troupes from Alaska, Hawaii, Australia, New
Zealand, Mexico, Japan, Korea, Bali and the Wallis and Futuna
Islands, a French territory of some 13,000 people between
Fiji and Samoa probably best known to stamp collectors, whose
jovial singer/dancers became one of the great hits of the
festival. Later in the sunburnt afternoon, wandering among
five stages and an outdoor market set up near the ocean, I
watched a warrior-macho hula, Japanese Taiko drummers, and
the compelling Wallis and Futunese, a dozen husky men in
tapa-cloth kilts who sat in a circle and sang on and on
(betimes sipping kava-root liquor), in a kind of close, high,
penetrating Kentucky mountain harmony.</p>
<p>After an overpacked 10 a.m. mass Sunday at the church
where L.A. began (Nuestra Senora Reina de los Angeles, whose
feast day we were celebrating), male dancers from Oaxaca in
Mexico and the Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico performed in the
patio alongside the church for perhaps 200 people. The
trumpets of a local high school's mariachi band rang out from
the plaza across the street. Depending on a minimalist, in
the end hypnotizing series of quicksteps, kicks, kneebends
and turns, and the repetitive rhythm of drums and a pipe (for
the Mexicans), electric violin and guitar (the Pueblo
Indians), the two formal, imperfect, expressionless troupes
communicated primarily through bare feet or shifting
boot-tips, a few stately or comic ritual gestures, and vivid
costumes. The men from Jemez Pueblo, in fact, were the most
gorgeously and elaborately garbed performers of the week,
each dancer weighed down and half-blinded by a different
array of turquoise, gold, silks, lace, fringe, feathers and
dime-store glitter.</p>
<p>Some of the happiest moments in my thin slice of the L.A.
Festival (the publicists of which claim a grand total of
1,400 participating artists, from 25 countries, at 96
different sites) came through the sort of fortuitous cultural
clashes one encounters in Los Angeles any day of the year. As
the Korean Shamans at San Pedro were doing their weird thing
in white robes and black peaked Pilgrim hats, to wild and
wailing music that could have passed for cutting-edge
European, a little airplane flew past trailing an ad-banner
for Pure Rock, KNAC-105. Along with body paint and grass
skirts, some Maori dancers wore Sony Walkmans, perhaps tuned
to KNAC. I contrived a minifestival of my own cruising along
the many freeways, by switching from KNAC Pure Rock, to
arcane classical on KUSC, to KZLA (93.9), the best
country-western station I've ever found. On Sunday morning,
en route to my Spanish mass, I had the good fortune to come
across the live gospel choir of Second Baptist.</p>
<p>To the opening ceremonies at San Pedro, Peter Sellars
wore, with his white tennies and Bart Simpson haircut, what
looked like an electric-gold and black clown suit. In fact,
it was a native outfit of baggy pants and belted tunic he had
bought that morning at the African Marketplace, one of the
many festival venues listed on the program.</p>
<p>So on my way to LAX Monday morning, I drove to a large,
flat city park in the middle of a lively black neighborhood.
There I spent three happy hours at the one event of the 1990
L.A. Festival that came close to realizing the idealistic
pretensions of its creators. Under a near-African sun, a few
shady trees and palm-roofed pavilions, thousands of genuinely
festive locals strolled along haystrewn paths among more than
200 bazaar stalls. On five separate stages through the fair,
gospel, blues, jazz, steel drum, rap, reggae and Afro-Latin
musicians, poets, storytellers and African dancers performed,
the sound of one overlapping the sound of another in jolly
polyrhythm. But except for the fact that two of the some 120
groups performing on those stages (the Maori and Wallis and
Futuna troupes) were there on loan from the festival
authorities, the African Marketplace has in fact nothing to
do with the L.A. Festival's multicultural, semiglobal
designs. An annual event of and for the black community --
although all comers are made welcome -- it has been going
strong for five years.</p>
<p>(Highlights of this, the festival's final weekend, include
Vermont's Bread and Puppet Theater; Chile's El Gran Circo
Teatro; the Cambodian Classical Dance Troupe; a four-church
gospel choir; a mass Japanese street dance; and John Adams's
opera "Nixon in China," directed by the ubiquitous Mr.
Sellars.)</p>
