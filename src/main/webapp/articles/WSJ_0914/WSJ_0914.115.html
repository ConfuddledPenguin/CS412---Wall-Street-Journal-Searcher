	<p class="article-leader">In response to Geraldine Brooks's Aug. 16 article about
U.S. and British Troops encountering Islam:
   The Arabs and Europeans/Americans have always made for
strange bedfellows as pilots flying together in training and
combat. As a Royal Air Force fighter pilot, I was involved in
training, and trained alongside, nationals of Jordan, Oman,
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar. I also spent the best part
of two years flying Omani fighters.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We had one prince attending fast jet school in North Wales
who refused to rise before noon and frequently went AWOL on
London jaunts. On the other hand, when some of these same
Arab pilots did decide to "turn and turn," they proved to be
excellent combat pilots.</p>
<p>There were also some tragic incidents resulting from the
Arabs' fierce pride. The fear of failure and accompanying
perceived family shame caused some alarming incidents. One
student disappeared along with the chief flying instructor
who was performing a "chop ride." The student was apparently
borderline and rather than be sent home, the price of
failure, he opted to take the jet and the instructor with him
to meet Allah.</p>
<p>The Arab nations have truly been jet-propelled into the
21st century.</p>
