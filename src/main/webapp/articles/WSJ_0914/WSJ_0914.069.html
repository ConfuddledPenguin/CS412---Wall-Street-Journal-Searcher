	<p class="article-leader">It probably was inevitable that as soon as someone started
to talk about creating a new world order, the demagogues
would come out of the woodwork. They could be heard around
the U.S. Capitol this week as Congressmen rained down
denunciations on Japan and Germany for not pulling their
weight in the Gulf. "History has shown that we need to be
tough to get action from Japan," thundered exdove Rep. David
Bonior of Michigan. With Saddam Hussein still fat and sassy
in Baghdad, this may not be the best time for some of the
West's major powers to go off into an alley for a fistfight.
   There is indeed a case to be made that Japan and
especially Germany should be doing more to support the Gulf
intervention. It would be helpful, though, if all the engaged
parties brought more sophistication to the question of the
Japanese-German contribution than was on display in the House
this week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For instance, the arguments over what kind of help Japan
should send, and how much, bring us closer to the day when
the world must face the rebirth of Japan as a leading
military power. Even with its defense budget held just under
1% of gross national product, Japan already ranks among the
world's top five nations in defense spending. Still, there
are people beyond the Beltway -- including Asians who recall
Japan's behavior in World War II -- who harbor misgivings
about a more military-minded Japan. Since that time, of
course, the Japanese have been learning better ways of
integrating themselves into the world.</p>
<p>Japan's awesome productivity has provided cars, stereos,
televisions, watches, computers and cameras that people
world-wide have flocked to buy. Japan now is opening, even if
slowly, to imports, out of a belated recognition that its
workers are entitled to more fruits of their labor. Far more
Japanese are traveling abroad, thereby becoming more
cosmopolitan in their outlook.</p>
<p>Moreover, the challenges these past few years to the
long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party suggest that the
democratic process is starting to seriously permeate Japanese
society. The electorate is fed up with unresponsive LDP
leaders who bulldozed through an unpopular consumption tax
and whose protectionist policies have served a few special
interests at the expense of consumers.</p>
<p>Japan, in short, has been evolving toward a society open
and flexible enough to know the full value of safeguarding
the democratic order. The big question is whether Japan has
already reached the point at which its allies, and its own
citizens, can trust it to stand strictly by the guns of
democracy. Perhaps. What's clear is that Japan has for a long
time been moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>The trick is to encourage that movement, including a
greater Gulf commitment, without driving them back into a
shell. For the moment, Japan's Prime Minister Kaifu has
offered a Persian Gulf aid package worth some $1 billion.
Yesterday Japan's Justice Minister supported a review of the
country's constitution to allow sending non-combat troops to
the Gulf, while another member of the Kaifu cabinet stated
that, "We have a large role to play in restoring peace in the
Gulf . . . and we should take up our responsibilities."</p>
<p>The situation with the Germans is in some ways more
troublesome. Over the past several years, Germany practically
developed a for-profit foreign policy; while the government
was busy with other things, many German firms developed
intimate relations with Saddam Hussein. The German government
is investigating 60 companies suspected of making
weapons-related sales to Baghdad. West German firms are said
to have been in the forefront of Iraq's development of poison
gas capabilities. And this came after a scandal in which
German firms stood accused of supplying Libyan chemical
plants.</p>
<p>Last weekend Helmut Kohl acknowledged that other nations
could say of Germany, "If there is money to be made, they're
there, but if the issue is taking responsibility, they evade
it." Yesterday Mr. Kohl called it "impossible" for a newly
united Germany to remain uninvolved, and tomorrow Secretary
of State Baker will meet with the German President to discuss
this matter.</p>
<p>What we are seeing here is a process of awakening. Just as
Germany was able to recognize and seize the momentum of
history in German reunification, the coalition arrayed
against Iraq's international piracy represents another
turning point in the world's accelerating transformation.
With so much at stake, it is important to push back against
the sort of potentially destructive demagoguery on display in
Congress this week, but it also is essential for Germany and
Japan to recognize that an event is occurring in which both
should be important participants.</p>
