	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- An accounting standards body voted to issue
partial new guidelines on the way financial institutions
account for debt securities held as investments.
   In a 15-0 vote at its meeting in Seattle, the Accounting
Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants said it would require
institutions to disclose information in the notes to
financial statements about the amortized cost and market
value of debt securities held as investments, as well as the
gross unrealized gains and losses for various categories of
debt securities it identified.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The committee's action represents a scaling back of a more
stringent proposal the banking and accounting industries had
opposed that would have required recognizing changes in the
value of certain of the debt securities held as investments
on the income statement. Currently, debt securities held as
investments are marked at historical cost, while those held
as trading assets are marked to market.</p>
<p>The accounting panel earlier this week softened its stand
on the proposal after receiving overwhelmingly negative
feedback from banks and accountants. Those groups criticized
the original proposal because they say it would have created
wide swings in earnings of financial institutions, rather
than give investors a clearer picture of the value of debt
securities held, as was intended.</p>
<p>The panel has yet to decide the issue of when to recognize
a loss when an investment security declines in value. John L.
Kreischer, committee chairman, said the panel would meet with
the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the chief
rule-making body, and staff of the Securities and Exchange
Commission to try to reach a consensus on that issue.</p>
<p>The new guidelines will apply to all financial statements
for periods ending after Dec. 15. Mr. Kreischer said the
panel would probably issue the statement within 60 days.</p>
<p>The categories of debt securities addressed by the new
guidelines include those issued by the U.S. Treasury and
other U.S. corporations and agencies, government and
government-agency securities, municipal debt and
mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>Institutions also will be required to disclose the amount
of debt securities due in one year or less, after one year
through five years, five to 10 years and after 10 years. In
each of those categories, the amortized cost and market value
must be disclosed. Proceeds from the sale of debt securities
held as investments and gross realized gains and losses on
such sales also must be disclosed.</p>
<p>The changes were made as part of an effort to standardize
accounting for debt securities by financial institutions.
They also were prompted by concern about abuses of current
guidelines. Critics say that under existing practice,
financial institutions can enhance their financial profile by
selling securities in which they have a profit while
continuing to carry at cost a different batch of the same
securities in which they have a paper loss.</p>
