	<p class="article-leader">SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO, Calif. -- Elsewhere, palm trees
conjure up images of long, sandy beaches and fun in the sun.
   Not here. The appearance of some new palm trees has
angered residents, made local headlines and become part of a
heated battle in the town's city council.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The hoopla started in February when Robert Maurer, a
real-estate developer, planted 87 very tall palm trees along
a mountain ridge. Mr. Maurer has been involved in a legal
battle with the city over his efforts to build a house on the
ridge, so many residents interpreted the palm trees as an act
of revenge.</p>
<p>"A lot of people are calling it porcupine hill," says
Jeanne Lyon, a travel agent at Uniglobe San Juan Travel.
"People didn't find it appealing. We just like our community
to be as attractive as possible." She also says the trees
look bad because they have unusually short fronds. "They look
like so many stakes stuck along the hill."</p>
<p>The Orange County Register described the scene as "fancy
toothpicks stabbed into a mound of meat loaf." Residents have
written protest letters to the Daily SunPost in San Clemente
and complained to city officials.</p>
<p>City officials are a bit guarded on the politically
sensitive issue. "It's a tough thing to deal with. We're in
litigation," says Stephen Julian, the city manager. But he
adds: "Most people are outraged. Most people feel he did it
to spite the city and to embarrass people."</p>
<p>Mr. Maurer's son, Mark, flatly denies a revenge motive. He
says the family bought the trees at bargain prices because
they were about to be bulldozed and they were planted to line
the intended driveway. "It has nothing to do with animosity
between certain city officials -- and I emphasize certain --
and my father," he says. "My dad likes palm trees."</p>
<p>The younger Mr. Maurer also says the palm fronds had to be
pruned considerably to travel, giving them the appearance of
fancy toothpicks. "We have taken a lot of abuse over
something that is a temporary situation," says Mr. Maurer.
"The fronds will open up as they grow. It distresses me that
no one can see into the future and see that the trees won't
always look like telephone poles."</p>
<p>Mr. Maurer also reasons that the 87 trees, even at bargain
prices, simply cost too much to have been planted for
revenge: "If you wanted to insult someone, there would be
cheaper ways to do it."</p>
