	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Supreme Court nominee David Souter told the
Senate Judiciary Committee that the Constitution protects an
implicit right to privacy, but he declined to spell out what
the right encompasses.
   On the first day of his Senate confirmation hearings,
Judge Souter responded to questions raised by Democratic
senators and some liberal groups by trying to demystify
himself and to depict himself as a humane, compassionate
judge.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Judges must always remember, he said, that "at the end of
our task some human being is going to be affected, some human
life is going to be changed."</p>
<p>Questioned by seven of the 14 committee members, his
answers appeared designed to project an image of moderation,
of a judge who is even-tempered and well-versed in
constitutional law and Supreme Court history. Throughout his
four hours of testimony, he avoided controversy. The hearings
proceeded without rancor, even though he generally declined
to give his views on Supreme Court decisions, including Roe
vs. Wade, the 1973 ruling that recognized the right to
abortion.</p>
<p>None of his responses had the ring of conservative legal
thinking that were the focus of a confirmation fight and
Senate rejection of Robert Bork for the Supreme Court in
1987. His 14-minute opening statement said his role as a
judge is "to make the promises of the Constitution a reality
for our time and to preserve the Constitution for the
generations that will follow. . . ."</p>
<p>In other comments, Judge Souter said the Constitution
clearly protects not only the right to privacy, but also
other rights that aren't expressly mentioned.</p>
<p>Democratic senators on the committee, several of whom in
opening statements expressed concerns about Judge Souter's
record, gave little inkling of whether they were satisfied by
his testimony.</p>
<p>Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) said afterward he was
"not entirely" satisfied with the judge's responses. During
questioning by Sen. Metzenbaum about whether the nominee
understood the plight of women faced with unwanted
pregnancies, Judge Souter said that while at Harvard Law
School he once counseled a woman about abortion. "I learned
what is at stake," Judge Souter said, but he declined to
disclose what advice he offered. Sen. Metzenbaum said the
testimony was "very sincere, very touching, but does not
answer the question" of how the nominee regards abortion.</p>
<p>Concern by some groups about the nominee's commitment to
civil liberties increased. Kate Michelman, director of the
National Abortion Rights Action League, said, "We learned
nothing." Nevertheless, nothing at the hearings, which will
continue today and next week, suggested the judge faces
difficulty being confirmed.</p>
<p>The 50-year-old judge, a former New Hampshire Supreme
Court justice and attorney general as well as a Harvard Law
School graduate and Rhodes Scholar, was selected by President
Bush July 23 to fill the vacancy created by the retirement of
Justice William Brennan.</p>
<p>Judge Souter's answers were often less pointed than the
questions.</p>
<p>Asked by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) whether he
believes the 14th Amendment guarantee of "equal protection of
the laws" protects individuals from sex discrimination as
well as race discrimination, he said it does. But he said the
legal test applied by the Supreme Court in sex-discrimination
cases, written by Justice Brennan in 1976, is "too loose" to
be workable. He offered no substitute.</p>
<p>Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), committee chairman, pressed
Judge Souter on whether he supports a 1965 Supreme Court
right-to-privacy ruling that protects the decision of married
people to use contraceptives. Judge Souter said that he
wouldn't endorse specific cases but that he recognized a
"fundamental" right of marital privacy protected by the
Constitution.</p>
<p>When Sen. Biden asked if he thought the right to decide
whether to have children was protected by the Constitution,
Judge Souter said the right to procreate was part of the
"concept of marital privacy." But he never explained whether
he believes a similar right of reproductive freedom exists
for unmarried people.</p>
