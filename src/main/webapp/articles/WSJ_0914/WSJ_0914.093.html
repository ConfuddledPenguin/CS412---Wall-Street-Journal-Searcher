	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- A group of more than 20 lenders to
architect-developer John Portman said they made "positive
progress" toward restructuring some or all of his roughly $2
billion of debt.
   Mr. Portman is facing a cash crunch and has stopped
servicing tens of millions of dollars of unsecured loans, as
well as the $332.6 million mortgage on his Peachtree Center
office buildings here. That mortgage is held by Equitable
Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and Nippon Life Insurance
Co. of Japan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The lender group, led by Citicorp and Swiss Bank Corp.,
met all day on Wednesday here, and said in a prepared
statement that it plans to meet again soon.</p>
