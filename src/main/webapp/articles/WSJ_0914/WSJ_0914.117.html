	<p class="article-leader">TUCSON, Ariz. -- After Niles Thim pleaded guilty in
January to three felony counts of selling unregistered
securities, State Judge Lawrence Fleischman contrived a
punishment to fit the crime.
   The sentence: Restitution of $9.2 million to 112
investors, a year in prison -- and a half-hour on prime-time
local television.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So it happens that "Niles Thim: Conditions of Probation"
-- originally titled "Niles Thim: How I Stole $9.2 Million"
-- is scheduled for broadcast tonight at 8:30 on Tucson's
KGUN, an ABC affiliate. It's a one-time talk show, starring
-- naturally -- Niles Thim.</p>
<p>Fear not, Phil and Oprah.</p>
<p>"Niles Thim" was taped last Thursday with a studio
audience consisting mainly of pensioners who lost their
savings in Mr. Thim's real-estate deals. Thanks to Mr. Thim's
attorney, Robert Hirsh, "Niles Thim" wasn't very revealing.
"This is boring," whispered an elderly investor dressed in a
plaid shirt and Sansabelt slacks. "It's one big advertisement
for Niles Thim and Bob Hirsh," said a woman. Some investors
even leave during the middle of the two-hour taping.</p>
<p>When Judge Fleischman dubbed the program "Niles Thim: How
I Stole $9.2 Million," Mr. Hirsh argued that his 56-year-old
client wasn't, in fact, guilty of stealing anything; he
pleaded guilty only to selling unregistered securities, under
an agreement negotiated with prosecutors. To make Mr. Thim
appear on a television show with that title would amount to
self-incrimination and cruel and unusual punishment, Mr.
Hirsh asserted. Mr. Hirsh also disliked the original format.
Anyone who lost money in one of Mr. Thim's deals would have
been able to stand up and pound away at his client verbally,
no holds barred.</p>
<p>A state appeals court sided with Mr. Hirsh and halted the
show just hours before it was first scheduled to be taped in
June. Investors who had made the trek to the TV station on
what turned out to be the hottest day in Tucson's history --
the thermometer hit 117 degrees -- left wilted and
exasperated.</p>
<p>After weeks of negotiations, Mr. Thim and his attorney
agreed to do the show, but with different ground rules. The
number of investors in the audience would be limited, and
they wouldn't be allowed to ask questions. All questions
would come from the station's anchorman and a private
detective, and would have to center on the three counts to
which Mr. Thim had pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>"It really messed up the format," laments the show's
producer, Michael Philipsen. "We'd rented wireless
microphones, and {the anchorman} was going to roam the
audience, just like Donahue."</p>
<p>As the taping finally begins, KGUN does its best to create
a talk-show ambience. Mr. Thim, his attorney and the two
interviewers sit in a semicircle in front of a pastel
backdrop. Judge Fleischman, a former Tucson newspaper
reporter, already has explained to about 30 members of the
audience that the show intends "to educate people about what
happened, and keep them from becoming victims." The judge, an
ardent advocate of so-called alternative sentencing, has said
he also wants to "make sure Mr. Thim will learn certain
things about what his conduct has done."</p>
<p>"Alternative sentencing doesn't mean you're being soft on
crime; you're just being wise with the taxpayers' money," the
judge explained before the show, citing the $28,000-a-year
cost to the state of keeping an inmate in prison. Mr. Thim
will serve his jail sentence over four years of probation,
staying behind bars from before Thanksgiving until after New
Year's Day each year.</p>
<p>Before sentencing, Judge Fleischman had arranged with the
station to broadcast the show.</p>
<p>"The studio here at KGUN-9 has been turned into what you
might call a satellite courtroom," silver-haired anchorman
Guy Atchley says as he introduces the program. A woman in a
green velour top and white pants stands before the cameras
and launches into a tearful tale, as Mr. Thim watches
stoically. She is the only investor allowed to speak during
the program.</p>
<p>Her name is Ina Bartenslager, she is a widow, and she lost
more than $30,000 in Mr. Thim's deals, she says. "I've lived
in my home for 31 years, and now my home is up for sale. . .
. I never dreamed in my wildest dreams I'd ever lose it,
especially to you," she says, facing Mr. Thim, who shows no
trace of emotion at first.</p>
<p>Later, though, Mr. Thim snaps, "I appreciate all the pain
she's gone through, but I would remind Ina she did make a
good living" investing and referring clients to him over a
25-year-period. She doesn't disagree, but she is more
concerned over her $30,000. "I need it very, very badly. More
than you," she says.</p>
<p>"I know," responds Mr. Thim. Mrs. Bartenslager may
eventually get some of her money back, but not before Mr.
Thim goes through bankruptcy proceedings and can sell off his
properties.</p>
<p>The money Mrs. Bartenslager lost came from a settlement
she collected after a car wreck a few years back. "Inside my
left arm here it's steel, clear on up to the socket," she
says during a break in the taping. "You know, if it was
legal, I'd go up there and smash him with it."</p>
<p>Things soon get bogged down in legal procedure. Mr. Hirsh
keeps interrupting to object to questions from the
interviewers and mostly allows his client to answer only the
easy ones. When Mr. Atchley tries to grill Mr. Thim about a
limousine he used, Mr. Hirsh breaks in: "We are not here to
have Mr. Thim pilloried with accusatory questioning."</p>
<p>Mr. Thim seems as smooth and rehearsed as a politician,
smiling and calling Mr. Atchley by his first name. When the
anchorman asks, "Do you consider what you did a major crime?"
Mr. Thim responds that he doesn't know what Mr. Atchley means
by "major."</p>
<p>"What would you do differently?" Mr. Atchley asks.</p>
<p>"Register the securities," Mr. Hirsh answers for his
client with a smirk.</p>
<p>"Obviously, Guy, my judgment hasn't been perfect," Mr.
Thim adds. "I haven't been proud that it hasn't worked out."</p>
<p>Prosecutors had asserted that some 600 people lost more
than $25 million when Mr. Thim took his real-estate
investment company into bankruptcy in 1987. Mr. Thim later
was charged with having defrauded the investors in a type of
pyramid scheme in which he sold them mortgages on raw land.
Mr. Thim blames his troubles on a downturn in the economy and
says he had run his business successfully for many years.</p>
<p>When Mr. Atchley points out that a prosecutor had
described Mr. Thim as "a manipulative, egotistical predator
whose ultimate goal was what money could buy," Mr. Thim
simply replies: "Guy, that's the opinion of the writer."</p>
<p>Judge Fleischman, meanwhile, is squirming as he stands
behind the cameras, ready to rule on each objection from Mr.
Hirsh. "I'm digging my nails in my hands at this point," the
exasperated jurist says. The audience, too, is growing testy,
particularly because they can't speak out. Several people let
out audible sighs.</p>
<p>The only other person allowed to query Mr. Thim, private
investigator Jerry Goddard, is annoyed with his repeated
claims that he was merely a victim of Arizona's depressed
economy. Wasn't Mr. Thim, in fact, running a "pyramid scheme"
as prosecutors had said, the investigator asks.</p>
<p>"That's clearly a Fifth Amendment violation," Mr. Hirsh
interjects.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean Mr. Atchley and Mr. Goddard just have
to sit there and eat that," Judge Fleischman says.</p>
<p>"Pyramids don't last 27 years, as did my business," Mr.
Thim interjects.</p>
<p>Mr. Goddard finally gives up, saying on camera that all
he's getting are "rambling unanswers from Mr. Thim."</p>
<p>When Mr. Thim was sentenced, investors had hoped to see a
televised confessional. "I wish somebody would have done a TV
show like this before I pulled this dumb trick of investing
with Niles Thim," says John Krane, a retired policeman from
Cleveland. He says he lost $10,000 in one of Mr. Thim's
deals. Warren Heath, an 82-year-old retiree who lost $40,000,
says he thinks the sentence is odd, "but if it helps, I'm all
for it."</p>
<p>In the end, though, the elderly crowd pans the
performance. "It's an exercise in futility," Joe Spencer, a
retired real-estate investor, says after the taping. "I don't
think anything very educational came out of it."</p>
<p>KGUN is bearing the production costs of the Thim show, and
it is running without commercials. If viewers greet it no
more enthusiastically than the studio audience, they have a
jurisprudential alternative: The slapstick NBC comedy, "Night
Court," will be shown opposite it.</p>
