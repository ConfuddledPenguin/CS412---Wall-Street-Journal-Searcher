	<p class="article-leader">Canadian Pacific Forest Products Ltd., Montreal, said
workers went on strike at its newsprint mills in Gatineau,
Quebec, and Dalhousie, New Brunswick.
   The Gatineau mill has annual capacity of 565,000 metric
tons of newsprint and primarily serves North American
customers. The Dalhousie mill has annual capacity of 340,000
metric tons and mostly serves European and Asian customers. A
metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The strike was called by the Canadian Paperworkers Union.
Members of the same union struck Monday at seven
Abitibi-Price Inc. mills in eastern Canada. Six of those
mills produce newsprint.</p>
<p>Together, the strikes against the two companies have
closed more than 12% of North American newsprint capacity.</p>
