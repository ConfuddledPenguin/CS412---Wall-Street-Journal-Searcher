	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The accounting profession, reversing its
previous position, said it supports proposed legislation that
would require auditors to notify regulators of possible
illegal acts by companies.
   The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants,
accounting's major professional body, reached the new
position after sponsors in Congress proposed language that
would put a greater responsibility on companies to report
alleged illegal acts of corporate officers that have been
identified by auditors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Congress in recent months has explored whether accountants
have failed to disclose evidence of possible illegal acts by
management that is uncovered during audits, particularly in
light of the savings and loan debacle.</p>
<p>In the past, auditors have argued that making them police
corporate behavior would harm their relationships with
clients and saddle them with an unfair burden of
responsibility for the acts of others.</p>
<p>Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who has sought to require
accountants to report wrong behaviors for several years,
asserts that the stiffer rules would "give us a chance to
pick up more problems at the earliest possible stage."</p>
<p>Under existing requirements, when an auditor uncovers
possible illegal acts on the part of a client, he is expected
to inform the corporate audit committee and directors, and
assess whether proper corrective steps have been taken; if
not, the auditor resigns the account, which triggers a
notification to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Under the latest proposal, a company that received a
letter from an auditor, expressing concern about failure to
take proper steps, would have to notify the SEC of the
dispute. If the company failed to do so, the auditor would
have to furnish the SEC a copy of its report. The auditor
would continue to have the option of resigning.</p>
<p>The accounting institute this week notified Rep. John
Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce committee, that it supports proposed changes to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The legislation could be
attached to other pending legislation as early as next week.</p>
<p>In a letter to Rep. Dingell, accounting institute
officials said the proposed changes would "improve investor
confidence in the integrity and reliability of financial
statements issued by those who access public capital
markets." The proposal also has the support of the six major
accounting firms.</p>
<p>Critics have asserted the current rules don't require
prompt enough disclosure of potential problems uncovered
during independent audits. In the latest proposal, if an
auditor writes a letter questioning whether appropriate
action has been taken, the company would have one day to
report receipt of such a letter; if the company failed to do
so, the auditor would have to notify the SEC on the following
business day.</p>
<p>The changes include a new requirement that companies in
their annual reports discuss whether any "material
weaknesses" have been identified and remain uncorrected in
their system of internal controls.</p>
<p>Though previous proposals required auditors to address
compliance with all laws and regulations, the latest changes
require them to report on potentially illegal acts that have
a material effect on a company's financial statement, which
accountants say they already do.</p>
<p>Separately, the proposal requires all publicly held banks
and thrifts to report to the SEC; current rules permit banks
and thrifts that aren't part of holding companies to report
to financial regulators rather than the SEC.</p>
