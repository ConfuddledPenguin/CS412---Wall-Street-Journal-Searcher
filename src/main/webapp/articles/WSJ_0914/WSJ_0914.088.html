	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Allegheny International Inc. said the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved its plan to emerge
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection.
   The company had expected to emerge last month, but the NRC
raised questions. Any transfer of ownership, or control, of a
nuclear license is subject to approval by the NRC.
Allegheny's Chemetron unit has a such a nuclear license.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The maker of Sunbeam and Oster products said it now
expects to emerge from bankruptcy protection the week of
Sept. 24, at which time it will be effectively controlled by
a New York investor group, Japonica Partners.</p>
