	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- It's a love-hate market. The stocks that Wall
Street adores are thriving. But those it despises are
languishing as rarely before.
   A study this week by David Katz, chief investment officer
of Matrix Asset Advisors in New York, gives new evidence of
what many investment pros suspected: Investors today are
making the sharpest distinctions between in-favor and
out-of-favor stocks since the famous "two-tier market" of
1972-74.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If history is a guide, the situation shouts two warnings
at investors. First, the overall stock market may tumble, as
it did with a thud in 1974. Second, investors may want to
rediscover those out-of-favor issues. The proud favorites
often take the biggest falls.</p>
<p>Mr. Katz studied the multiple of stock prices to
companies' book values (assets minus liabilities). As the
accompanying chart shows, he found that the price-to-book
multiples for the favorite fifth of New York Stock Exchange
issues are 2.17 times those of the average stock (see
accompanying table -- WSJ Sep. 14, 1990). This is the biggest
lead for the favorites since 1974.</p>
<p>But stocks in the least-favorite fifth are selling for
price-book multiples 65% below those of the average stock.
This is the fattest discount in the 18-year period the study
covers. (The next-fattest discount was 64%, in 1973.)</p>
<p>In short, the stock market equivalent of prom queens have
even more dates than usual, and the wallflowers are lonelier
than ever.</p>
<p>Take Wal-Mart Stores and Sears Roebuck, for example. No
fewer than 17 brokerage houses recommend Wal-Mart, which
sells for 25 times the company's past 12 months' per-share
earnings. Sears, by contrast, is despised. Only four
brokerage houses recommend it, and Sears stock sells for only
eight times earnings.</p>
<p>"There is no question that Wal-Mart is a vastly superior
company," Mr. Katz says. But he believes it is irrational to
pay three times as much for a dollar of Wal-Mart earnings as
for a dollar of Sears earnings. Investors, in his view, are
"paying too much for the growth prospects in Wal-Mart and . .
. assuming that Sears earnings are never going to grow
again."</p>
<p>At some point, he says, "Sears is going to get a little
bit smarter . . . and Wal-Mart is going to slow down."</p>
<p>Others also believe the market has gone to extremes. "The
gap between {stocks} that are loved and those that are hated,
I've never seen it widen so much," Richard Welty, portfolio
manager with LaTeef Management Associates in San Francisco,
says. "Stocks have been taken to excesses, both on the upside
and on the downside."</p>
<p>Mr. Welty himself is a "growth" manager, one who chooses
stocks with rapidly rising earnings that are expected to
persist. Accordingly, he is content with the way the market
has been acting.</p>
<p>"We've skewed ourselves to the big, blue-chip stocks," he
says. "It sounds terrible, but we're afraid to own some of
the others, even though . . . there are some better values"
in less-known issues. "It makes it sound like we're just
investing with the herd, but boy, it's a lot safer these
days."</p>
<p>While growth-stock managers thrived, "value" managers have
languished. The value crowd seeks out stocks that seem
underpriced in relation to companies' earnings, dividends or
book value. Last year and this year, those apparent bargains
have just kept sagging in price.</p>
<p>But value managers believe their return to favor won't be
much longer in coming. "We will have our time in the sun in
the fairly near future," says Mr. Katz, a strict devotee of
the value school.</p>
<p>Value investing "has worked over a very long period of
time. It has almost never been out of favor for this long,"
David Dreman, a well-known value manager in New York, says.
"I think we're within six months or even less of a major
move" toward a more evenhanded investor attitude on various
stocks.</p>
<p>Mr. Dreman recently studied the performance of stocks with
high price-earnings ratios (typically growth stocks) and
those with low P-E ratios (value stocks) over 18 overlapping
five-year periods, beginning with 1969-1973 and ending with
1985-1989. (The study was limited to large-company stocks.)
In 16 of the 18 periods, value stocks did better.</p>
<p>In only two periods did stocks with high price-earnings
ratios win. One of those periods was the past five years. The
other was the period 1969-1973.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Mr. Dreman believes investors will be
rewarded if they stick with out-of-favor issues such as
banking, computer and auto stocks. Among his holdings are
Ford Motor, International Business Machines, Compaq, Barnett
Banks, Norwest and First Union.</p>
<p>All this has made people say that we are in another market
like that of the early 1970s, when a select group called the
"Nifty 50" stocks captured most of the glory and a huge share
of investors' money. After being bid up to exorbitant
heights, the stocks, including McDonald's, IBM and Xerox,
collapsed in the bear market of 1974.</p>
<p>John L. Manley Jr., a quantitative strategist at Smith
Barney, has listed the stocks he believes are today's
equivalent of the Nifty 50. He dubs it the Sweet 16.</p>
<p>Abbott Laboratories, Boeing, Browning Ferris Industries,
Coca-Cola, General Electric, and General Mills are all
members of the Sweet 16. So are H.J. Heinz, Johnson &
Johnson, Eli Lilly, Merck, PepsiCo, Philip Morris, Procter &
Gamble, Toys "R" Us, Wal-Mart and Waste Management.</p>
<p>"These are the favored few," Mr. Manley says, meaning the
stocks that investors have chased after, not necessarily the
ones Smith Barney recommends.</p>
<p>Not all indicators show that this is a love-hate market.
P-E multiples (stock prices divided by per-share earnings)
haven't gone to the extremes that some other measures have.</p>
<p>And not everyone thinks that stocks are due to become more
equal. R. Joseph Fuchs, director of research at Kidder
Peabody, is among those who believe today's big disparities
could last a long time, or even widen. He believes that the
economy will poke along in the 1990s and that inflation will
be low. Companies and industries will increasingly show
themselves to be clear winners or losers. And this time, he
says, there will be almost "no takeovers to rescue the
turkeys."</p>
<p>Thomas Mench, vice president for investments at Leshner
Financial Services in Cincinnati, says the bedraggled state
of Wall Street also may be contributing to the love-hate
market. Stocks of many lesser-known companies aren't followed
by brokerage houses anymore, he says, so no one is pushing
investors to buy them.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many market veterans say the current
two-tier market isn't likely to last much longer. Robert
Moseson, president of Performance Analytics, a Chicago
concern that tracks money managers, says he has never seen
growth managers outperform value managers by such a lopsided
margin.</p>
<p>Outperforming value managers, he says, "was almost as easy
as killing fish in a barrel" for growth managers. But in the
past, he says, such lopsided results haven't lasted much more
than 18 months -- and it has been that long already. The
growth-stock fans in the past, he says, have tended to shine
when "the market is on very shaky legs."</p>
