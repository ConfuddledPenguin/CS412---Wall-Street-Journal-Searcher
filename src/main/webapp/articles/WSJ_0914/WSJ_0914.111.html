	<p class="article-leader">After a week of horror and dismay at the stunning New
Democratic Party victory in Ontario, businessmen in the
province are now trying to persuade themselves to look on the
bright side.
   The new premier, Bob Rae, has devoted his first week in
office to reassuring business that he does not intend to
carry out his party's numerous resolutions in favor of
nationalizing mines, banks and forestry companies; that he
will dishonor the NDP commitment to let trade union officials
vet every textbook used in the province's schools; that his
promised 60% increase in the minimum wage will be phased in
over four years; and that he does, cross his heart, believe
in a market economy -- so long as it works "efficiently and
fairly." So far, businessmen are professing to be reassured.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It takes strong nerves to be reassured about Ontario right
now. Ontario is one of the most important economic
jurisdictions in North America: Forty percent of Canada's
economic activity is done there. The Toronto Stock Exchange,
which is regulated by the provincial government, is the ninth
biggest (by value traded) in the world. Five of North
America's 20 biggest banks are headquartered in Toronto.</p>
<p>Ontario also has traditionally been the bastion of what
passes for conservative politics in Canada. It was governed
by the Conservative Party for 42 years, from 1943 to 1985.
While every other English-speaking province outside the
tradition-minded Maritimes has consistently put socialists or
right-wing economic populists or both into power since 1945,
Ontario voters normally reward the party seen to be preferred
by the business establishment. Except in 1975-78, when the
Ontario Liberal Party collapsed, the NDP had never before
even managed to finish second.</p>
<p>Perhaps because they have had so little experience in or
near government, Ontario New Democrats are among the wackiest
of the developed world's socialist parties. You will find no
Roger Douglas, no Helmut Schmidt, no Paul Keating, no Laurent
Fabius among them. Their economics are those of a Central
European peasant, circa 1450: They understand the world to be
governed not by neutral economic forces, but by evil spirits
-- ghouls, bankers, goblins, real-estate developers.</p>
<p>Inflation, the NDP believes, is caused not by
overindulgent central banks, but by speculators; and so it
promised during the campaign to enact a 90% profits tax on
the sale of any real estate (other than a primary residence)
within four years of purchase.</p>
<p>Women, the party says, often earn lower salaries than they
would like, not because they tend to choose jobs for which
the demand is relatively low and the supply relatively high,
but because of systemic discrimination; and so the party has
promised and promised again to extend Ontario's "pay equity"
program to virtually every employer in the province --
meaning that civil servants and consultants will rate every
job in the province on a scale of 1 to 400, and punish any
employer who pays a jobholder rated at 250 more than one
rated at 275. It will be no excuse that there were plenty of
people able to do the 275-point job and a desperate shortage
of people able to do the 250-point job.</p>
<p>Auto insurance premiums rocket up, the party says, not
because judges are awarding more generous personal-injury
settlements, but because auto-insurance executives are
grasping and selfish; and so the NDP made a government
takeover of auto insurance one of the centerpieces of its
campaign rhetoric. Rents are high not because municipal
regulations prevent developers from constructing housing fast
enough to keep up with booming demand, but because developers
are gouging the public; and so the party has promised to
squeeze every last bit of mercy out of Ontario's already
stringent rent-control laws.</p>
<p>And yet, Ontario's business community may be right to take
a relaxed view of its new government. First of all, the NDP's
radical instincts are likely to be tempered by its flimsy
mandate: Although the party took 74 of the 130 seats in the
provincial Parliament, it received only 38% of the vote. It
owes its majority in part to the flukes possible in a
three-party system, in part to the unprecedentedly high
number (7%) of ballots cast for fringe Green, Libertarian and
anti-bilingual candidates. Unless the NDP can cajole an added
4% or 5% of the electorate into voting for it next time, it
will almost certainly be swept out of power. The need to
conciliate that 4% or 5% should have a nice damping effect.</p>
<p>The NDP government's operations are also going to be
gravely hampered by personnel weaknesses. Mr. Rae himself is
a highly intelligent man, if uncontaminated by any experience
outside academia and politics. Otherwise, the NDP benches are
a near total talent vacuum.</p>
<p>Business can also take a certain cold comfort from the
depressing fact that it's going to be hard for an NDP
government to do worse than its predecessor Liberal and
Conservative governments. Mr. Rae is planning to tighten rent
controls -- rather than introduce them -- because controls
were first enacted by a Conservative government in 1975. It
was the Conservatives who first imposed "anti-speculation"
taxes on real estate -- in 1971. Mr. Rae's tax-and-spend
policies could hardly be much costlier than those of the
Liberals, which crushed Ontario -- the most lightly taxed
province in Canada when that party took power in 1985 --
under the heaviest taxes in North America by 1990. "Pay
equity" for companies with 100 employees or more was enacted
by the Liberals in 1988.</p>
<p>And for warmer comfort, business may think of this: Mr.
Rae owes his present job to a sudden surge of anger from
Ontario's voters. Liberal Premier David Peterson called this
election, two years before he was obliged to, because his
pollsters told him he was popular. Ten days before the Sept.
7 election, he seemed to be coasting toward another majority.
Then, suddenly, Wham] his party was obliterated and he lost
his own seat.</p>
<p>What happened? In a brilliant series of negative ads, the
opposition Conservatives tapped a seething public resentment
over the Peterson tax burden. The Conservative ads shook
voters loose from the Liberals. But because the federal
Conservative government of Brian Mulroney has been adding tax
upon tax since 1984, the voters decided they did not trust
the anti-tax rhetoric of the local Tories. So a decisive
plurality decided to take a gamble on Mr. Rae.</p>
<p>Mr. Rae is likely to disappoint that tax-shy plurality.
When he does, some canny political entrepreneur is going to
notice that the pompous local wisdom that Canadians are more
"compassionate" -- the local euphemism for redistributionist
-- than their American neighbors is dead wrong. There is, it
turns out, a low-tax constituency in Ontario after all. The
politician who figures out how to speak to it could be
premier of Ontario for a very long time. And then, Bob Rae
may look like a necessary evil, just as four years of Jimmy
Carter prepared the way for three Republican landslides.</p>
