	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Negotiators for the United Auto Workers union
and General Motors Corp. have cleared away all but the
crucial issues of job security and health benefits, and could
agree to a new pact by the deadline tonight, officials on
both sides said.
   "I'd say it's 70-30 there will be an agreement," said a
UAW person close to the talks. Another UAW official said,
"We're positioned for a settlement." Bargainers have reached
agreement on wages and most other issues involved in the
talks, officials said. Whatever agreement emerges from these
talks will likely set the pattern for the UAW's talks with
Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. Current contracts at all
three U.S. auto makers expire at 11:59 p.m. tonight.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Union and company officials cautioned that a final
agreement on the crucial job security and health questions
hadn't been sealed as of late yesterday evening. If the UAW's
contract expires without a settlement, the union could hobble
GM's operations with a national strike, or a series of local
walkouts.</p>
<p>However, the two sides could easily extend their talks
into the weekend without much disruption of GM's operations.</p>
<p>UAW officials have scheduled a meeting Monday in Detroit
for all their top local union officials. Some UAW officials
speculated the meeting was called to give them details of an
agreement, but they also said the meeting could be used to
discuss strike strategies if bargainers fail to reach
agreement.</p>
<p>The pace of the talks at GM quickened markedly on
Wednesday, after GM Chairman Robert Stempel, along with
Alfred S. Warren, a GM vice president and the company's top
bargainer, met with UAW President Owen Bieber and Stephen P.
Yokich, the UAW's top GM bargainer.</p>
<p>Now, negotiations are at a level where, instead of dozens
of people involved in meetings, gatherings are limited to a
handful of high-level officials on both sides.</p>
<p>"We're really at a very intense time of these talks," said
a GM spokesman. "We've made a lot of progress but there are
still some hard issues to get at."</p>
<p>The toughest issues surround the UAW's demands that GM
workers get virtually ironclad job and income security
guarantees. GM's current job security package is an intricate
web of provisions that allows layoffs only under certain
conditions, such as a sales slump. Idled workers get a
portion of their weekly take-home pay from a special fund.</p>
<p>When funds for these programs are full, laid-off workers
can earn almost 95% of their take-home pay for up to two
years. However, massive layoffs at GM over the last three
years have drained the fund and caused workers to be paid
lower benefit levels for shorter time periods. Moreover, GM
has used loopholes in the contract to close four assembly
plants and several parts-making facilities since 1987. At
least two more GM assembly plants in the U.S. are scheduled
to close by 1992.</p>
<p>The UAW has demanded sweeping changes in the current
system, and GM negotiators are understood to have proposed
boosting the levels of funding for some of the income
security programs. Perhaps more importantly, GM is signaling
it is willing to enhance pension benefits to induce workers
to retire.</p>
<p>According to one analyst, GM needs about 20,000 workers to
retire or otherwise leave the company annually over the
course of the three-year agreement. That would lead to
productivity gains of about 5% a year, which would virtually
offset the amount that labor costs could increase during the
term of a new contract.</p>
<p>That sounds simple. But in practice, it isn't, because
some of GM's attrition will come from outright plant
shutdowns. So UAW bargainers are pressing GM to make
substantial income guarantees to workers who are laid off,
but who aren't ready to retire or willing to move to jobs at
other GM locations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, neither the company nor the union would comment
on reports that a deal has been struck on wages. In its
initial proposal to GM three weeks ago, the company proposed
a 2% base wage increase in the first year of a three year
deal, followed by lump sum payments of 2% in each of the
following years.</p>
<p>GM officials also continue to seek changes in health-care
benefits. UAW workers at GM benefit from one of the most
generous health-care plans in the manufacturing sector. GM
officials had proposed requiring UAW employees to pay for a
greater portion of their health-care benefits. Although the
company has softened its aggressive health-care proposal from
the earlier stages of bargaining, GM continues to seek ways
to cut health-care costs.</p>
<p>In a related matter, GM and the Electric Workers union
extended their contract past today's deadline. A GM spokesman
characterized the extension as a normal move the Electric
Workers make to await the outcome of the UAW talks. The
Electric Workers union represents 24,000 people at factories
scattered around the country that build parts for GM
vehicles.</p>
