	<p class="article-leader">BOISE, Idaho -- Morrison Knudsen Corp. said it acquired CF
Systems Corp., a closely held environmental technology
concern.
   Morrison said the acquisition -- the terms of which it
didn't disclose -- was part of an effort to bolster its
environmental cleanup business. It said CF Systems, based in
Boston, has developed several technologies for reduction and
treatment of hazardous wastes, including a solvent-extraction
system for petroleum sludges.</p>
