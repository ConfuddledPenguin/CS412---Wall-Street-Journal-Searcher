	<p class="article-leader">Toshiba Corp. of Japan unveiled plans to deliver a new
generation of computer hard disk drives, a move that rattled
the stocks of several U.S. makers of disk drives.
   In Tokyo, Toshiba said it had developed a 2.5-inch, micro
hard disk drive with a storage capacity of about double that
of currently available 2.5-inch products. The company said
sample shipments would be available in Japan on Oct. 1, with
mass production set for April.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Among the U.S. disk-drive makers whose stock fell on the
announcement was Conner Peripherals Inc., of San Jose, Calif.
Conner stock tumbled $1.625 a share to $20.625 a share in
national over-the-counter trading yesterday. Some 4.1 million
shares changed hands, making Conner the most active
over-the-counter issue.</p>
<p>Also in over-the-counter trading, the stock of Seagate
Technology, based in Scotts Valley, Calif., declined 37.5
cents a share to $8.125. Quantum Corp. of Milpitas, Calif.,
fell $1.125 a share to $16.50.</p>
<p>Toshiba's announcement highlighted the push to produce
smaller, yet more powerful, disk drives for increasingly
popular laptop computers and notebook-sized personal
computers. Toshiba's computer division announced on Wednesday
that it was boosting U.S. production of its popular line of
laptop computers.</p>
<p>Some analysts said they believe Conner, for one, will be
able to fend off Toshiba's challenge. Steven Ossad, a
technology analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco,
said he expects Conner to introduce a 2.5-inch drive next
month that will beat the Toshiba product in value and
performance and will also be more generally available sooner.</p>
<p>"This is not a particularly new phenomenon. When Conner
was in its earliest stages of development, Toshiba announced
a 3.5-inch product and there was the same jumpiness," said
Mr. Ossad.</p>
<p>Toshiba's computer division has also been a significant
purchaser of Conner drives, accounting for about 5% of Conner
sales in the second quarter ended June 30, according to Mr.
Ossad. He said he didn't believe that relationship would be
hurt by the latest announcement.</p>
<p>"Our relationship with the Toshiba computer division
remains very, very strong," said Carl Neun, Conner's chief
financial officer. "We believe we have competed very well in
getting business out of the computer division." He said the
new Toshiba product was a natural next step for the company,
and that Conner was aware that the announcement was coming.</p>
