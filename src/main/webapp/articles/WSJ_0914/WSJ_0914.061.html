	<h3>New Warrant Offers a Bet On Yen, Mark</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">U.S. investors may soon get the chance to bet on the
relative currency values of two of the world's economic
powerhouses, Japan and Germany.
   Goldman, Sachs & Co. yesterday filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission to register five million warrants
whose price over the next two years will rise if the yen
strengthens against the mark, and fall if it doesn't.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though the warrants were designed by Goldman, they'll
officially be offered, as early as next week, by AT&T Capital
Corp., a finance arm of the communications giant. Co-managers
of the offering are Oppenheimer & Co. and Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.</p>
<p>According to an options trader familiar with the terms of
the sophisticated new investment vehicle, this would be the
first cross-currency warrant offered in the U.S., though such
warrants have been sold in Europe. When issued, the warrants
are expected to be listed for trading on the American Stock
Exchange. Earlier this year, warrants on the Japanese stock
market were hits on the Amex.</p>
<p>Most warrants, like options, give holders the right, but
not the obligation, to buy or sell securities, currencies and
other instruments at a specific price on or before a certain
date. But this warrant is more complicated, because while it
offers holders the opportunity to bet on the relative
strength of two foreign currencies, payoffs are made in
dollars.</p>
<p>The value of the proposed warrants is based on the number
of yen it takes to buy one mark. This rate is computed by
dividing the number of yen it takes to buy $1 by the number
of marks required to buy $1. The Wall Street Journal daily
publishes a table of cross-rates between various currencies.
For example, the cross-rate yesterday was 86.879 yen to buy
one mark.</p>
<p>The proposed warrants entitle an investor to a payment in
U.S. dollars if the number of yen to purchase one mark drops
below the number specified in the warrant, known as the
"strike price." This strike price will be the cross-rate
between the yen and the mark on the day the warrant is
issued. The intrinsic value of the warrant is calculated from
a formula specified in the warrant's prospectus. Each warrant
initially will represent $50 of currency and is expected to
be priced between $3.25 and $3.75.</p>
<p>If the value of the yen appreciates relative to the mark
by 14% to about 74.72 yen for each mark, an investor would
double his money, assuming a warrant price of $3.50. Or, if
the yen were to strengthen against the dollar by 10% while
the mark stays at its current level vis-a-vis the dollar, an
investor would make about 42% on his warrants.</p>
<p>Cross rates are just as volatile as currencies themselves.
As recently as the fall of 1989 the yen was under 75 yen per
mark, while in the first quarter of this year the ratio was
as high as 95 yen per mark.</p>
<p>Of course, if the yen depreciates relative to the mark --
meaning the number of yen it takes to buy one mark increases
-- investors in these proposed warrants stand to lose all
their money at expiration. For example, if the yen drops to
150 yen to $1 while the mark-dollar rate remains steady --
yesterday it was 1.5677 marks to $1 -- the warrants would
expire worthless.</p>
<p>These examples are based on the warrants' intrinsic value
and not on what buyers and sellers are willing to pay for the
warrants before expiration. The intrinsic value of the
warrants when they are issued will be zero. They will be
priced on the basis of their so-called time value, which will
be the issue price of around $3.50. As a warrant approaches
expiration, it loses its time value and its price begins to
approach its intrinsic value.</p>
<p>Like the warrants based on the Nikkei stock average that
were sold so successfully earlier this year, purchasers will
not have to wait until expiration to exercise their warrants.
"American-style" warrants can be exercised on any business
day. Holders of warrants also will be able to sell them on
the Amex.</p>
<p>Original purchasers of warrants that were bets the Nikkei
stock average would fall reaped tremendous profits; the first
issue of them came out just as Nikkei average was reaching
its peak. Even purchasers of the second set of warrants have
done well as they were issued when the Nikkei was around
28,000. Currently, it is near 25,000.</p>
