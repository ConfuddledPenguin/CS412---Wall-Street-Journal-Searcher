	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. filed suit in U.S.
District Court here, alleging the Chicago Board of Trade
violated antitrust laws and the Commodity Exchange Act when
it issued a 1989 emergency order requiring soybean traders to
close out their positions.
   The CBOT's action last year was designed to avert a
possible squeeze on traders holding short, or selling,
positions in the contracts, where prices had skyrocketed in
response to a drought-reduced soybean harvest. Ferruzzi, a
grain merchant, had accumulated large quantities of soybeans
and long, or purchase, contracts; liquidating that position
under the order gave the Milan concern significant trading
losses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In one suit, Ferruzzi alleges that "certain members of the
CBOT's board of directors, including its chairman, were
affiliated with trading firms that held short soybean futures
positions in proprietary or customer accounts." The board
issued the order in an effort to avoid losses by
"manipulating soybean prices to artificially low levels."</p>
<p>The CBOT chairman at the time the order was issued was
Karsten Mahlmann, who was also chairman of Stotler Group Inc.
Stotler held a short position, as did its customers, the suit
alleges. And because of the firm's "dire financial straits"
at the time, a loss on its position, or a customer default,
"might have forced the company into default, which in fact
happened a year later." As reported, Mr. Mahlmann resigned
from the CBOT after Stotler collapsed earlier this summer;
the company's financial woes weren't publicly known until
July of this year.</p>
<p>In a separate suit, Ferruzzi asked the court to block a
disciplinary procedure scheduled for next week, in which the
CBOT's Business Conduct Committee will decide on charges that
Ferruzzi's marketplace activities were designed to manipulate
the price of soybean contracts. Ferruzzi's suit alleges that
the CBOT launched the internal investigation "in response to
the criticism of its apparent conflict of interest."</p>
<p>The Business Conduct Committee, which will hear the
charges against Ferruzzi, "is the same body which recommended
the emergency order, decided to initiate an investigation of
plaintiffs, and approved the charges against them," the suit
says. And if it wants to appeal the committee's ruling,
Ferruzzi said, it has to appeal to the CBOT's board, which
"approved and issued the emergency order."</p>
<p>The disciplinary procedures should be blocked because the
CBOT "is incapable of providing (Ferruzzi) with a fair
hearing."</p>
<p>In both suits, only the CBOT is named as a defendant.</p>
<p>Both the Commodities Futures Trading Commision and the
General Accounting Office carried out investigations of the
CBOT's emergency order, and concluded there hadn't been a
conflict of interest.</p>
<p>In a statement yesterday, the CBOT called the suits
"obviously frivolous," and added that it intends to resist
them "to the fullest extent of the law. . . . We will not
permit them to interfere with our responsibility to protect
the integrity of the market through our disciplinary
process."</p>
