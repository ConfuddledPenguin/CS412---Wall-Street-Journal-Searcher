	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Sales of domestic cars and trucks gained
momentum in early September, rising 2.5% on the heels of a
weak August.
   It was the first 10-day period since late July in which
the 10 major U.S. auto makers boosted sales from a year
earlier. The modest increase surprised some analysts, who had
expected car and truck sales would continue spiraling
downward in the wake of rising gasoline prices, economic
uncertainty and growing tensions in the Persian Gulf.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's as if the American consumer is oblivious" to these
economic conditions, said David Healy, an analyst with
Barclays de Zoete Wedd. "There doesn't seem to be much of an
effect on people's willingness to buy cars."</p>
<p>U.S. auto makers sold 217,610 cars and trucks in the Sept.
1-10 period, compared with 212,334 in early September a year
ago.</p>
<p>Sales of North American-made passenger cars rose 6.7% in
early September, to 140,795 from 132,004 a year ago. General
Motors Corp., Honda Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp.
contributed the most to the overall gain.</p>
<p>Passenger car sales in the Sept. 1-10 period hit a
seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 7,130,000 cars,
according to a Commerce Department formula. That rate is
slightly lower than the 7,290,000 car-sales pace a year ago,
and about even with the 7,110,000 cars in late August.</p>
<p>Chrysler Corp. fared the worst among the Big Three. The
company's domestic car sales skidded 15.9%, while its
domestic truck sales dropped 17%.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co.'s domestic car sales were off 0.6%, despite
a 13.9% increase in sales of the redesigned 1991 Ford Escort
compact and the older version. Escort sales have been soft
much of the year. But in early August, Ford started offering
4.8% financing on Escorts, as well as cash rebates. Ford's
truck sales jumped 10.2% in the latest 10 days, largely on
the strength of its Explorer sport-utility vehicle.</p>
<p>GM said sales of its domestic cars rose 6.4%. But the No.
1 auto maker's truck sales were down 13.8% from a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Most of the Japanese auto makers that build and sell cars
in the U.S. continued to show gains from a year ago.</p>
<p>Honda increased sales of its domestically made Accords and
Civics by a whopping 89.1%, partly reflecting increased
production. Toyota boosted sales of its domestically made
cars by 70.9%.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Motors Corp., however, saw sales of its
U.S.-built cars drop 20.7%.</p>
