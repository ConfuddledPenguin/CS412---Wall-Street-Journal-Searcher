	<p class="article-leader">An abiding mystery of George Bush's leadership is its
split personality.
   On foreign and domestic policy, Mr. Bush can seem like two
different men. The one is decisive and cool under pressure.
The other is detached and quick to give in. Foreign Bush can
be stubborn about China, deft toward Europe and Mikhail
Gorbachev, gutsy in taking out Manuel Noriega. Domestic Bush
trades his tax pledge for nothing, treats Democratic leader
George Mitchell as if he were Sam Rayburn, turns the other
cheek to those who sandbagged John Tower.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Foreign Bush was at his best speaking to Congress this
week. His speech lacked flourish, as usual, but the subject
carried its own drama. The Members were rapt. Richard
Gephardt, the Democratic partisan, sounded like a statesman
in his party's response. Liberals warm to Mr. Bush's talk of
"international law," while conservatives admire his assertion
of "American leadership." Whatever the motive, Arthur
Vandenberg's rule applies: Having signed on at the take-off,
Congress won't so easily jump before the landing.</p>
<p>Indiana's Richard Lugar, one of the Senate's cooler heads,
thinks members trust Mr. Bush in a crisis because so many
know him personally. Mr. Lugar was one of 11 old Congress
hands Mr. Bush invited to a dinner in the White House family
quarters two weeks ago. (Others included Sens. John Glenn of
Ohio and Bill Roth of Delaware, and House committee chairmen
Dante Fascell and John Dingell.)</p>
<p>They talked over the nuances of the crisis most of the
evening. A day earlier, Mr. Lugar had said publicly that
something had to be done about Iraq's chemical and nuclear
weapons even if it left Kuwait. "As soon as I walked in the
door," Mr. Bush was asking about it, says the senator. "He's
fully conversant with the idea and isn't necessarily
opposed." Anybody think Ronald Reagan would have had the same
kind of dinner?</p>
<p>Foreign Bush is so strong now that he may be able to
invigorate his alter-ego. His popularity ratings have soared
back into the 70% range. One ranking White House political
aide explains how Iraq has changed everything: "Two months
ago we were looking at, `Bush wants to raise taxes to cover
the S&L mess.' Now we are saying, `If the world can unite to
fight Iraq, why can't Congress pass a budget?'"</p>
<p>Domestic Bush has new political leverage, if he's willing
to use it. Barring a self-inflicted wound, Supreme Court
nominee David Souter will sprint through the Senate; Joe
Biden isn't likely to draw a line in his sandbox. A few
insiders say the president could even afford to veto the
Clean Air bill, as too costly in a time of crisis.</p>
<p>But to succeed at home, Domestic Bush will have to play
against type and fight. He'll have to reject the arguments of
his friend William Coleman about Sen. Ted Kennedy's
civil-rights quota bill. The prominent black Republican has
been a Fifth Column telling Mr. Bush privately that the
Kennedy bill isn't really a quota bill. (Mr. Coleman was also
a chief accuser of Robert Bork.)</p>
<p>Mr. Bush is well positioned politically to veto, having
framed the public debate as quotas or not. But, says one
senior aide, "I don't think he's very comfortable saying no
to Bill Coleman and Ben Hooks" (the NAACP chief).</p>
<p>The biggest test is the budget. Having disarmed on taxes,
Mr. Bush had been in retreat. His Tuesday speech put him back
on offense. It framed the issue as economic growth first,
deficits second. His summit negotiators have suddenly found
some gumption, too. Budget Director Richard Darman had a
90-minute breakfast with GOP firebrand Newt Gingrich last
week, and adopted his 15% capital gains proposal and other
"growth incentives."</p>
<p>Democrats are the ones moving for a change. At the budget
summit, they first offered to increase non-defense spending
over five years. Republicans rolled their eyes. After
haggling, Democrats asked for the GOP "bottom line."
Republicans said cuts of $120 billion.</p>
<p>Democrats came back with less than $100 billion.
Republicans rolled their eyes again, and Mr. Darman inveighed
on the meaning of "bottom line." This prompted Sen. Robert
Byrd, the courtly but obstinate West Virginian, to assert
that he hadn't been treated this way in all his years in the
Senate.</p>
<p>Taxes are the Gordian knot. Republicans want a capital
gains cut, but Democrats want an income tax hike to "pay"
(politically) for it. On top of likely increases in beer,
luxury, cigarette, gasoline and other taxes, a higher income
tax would be a major defeat -- for Mr. Bush and the economy.</p>
<p>The political (and perhaps Mr. Darman's) temptation will
be to accept even a mediocre agreement, then bask in the
huzzahs of a city that defines "leadership" as more federal
revenues. But a pact that endangers the economy won't reduce
the deficit and will leave Domestic Bush weaker than before
(weakening Foreign Bush besides). The more difficult choice
would be to play brinksmanship until Congress gives him a
decent deal and a capital gains cut.</p>
<p>George Bush has been underestimated, in part because his
own unrhetorical presidency follows the most effective
rhetorical president since FDR. Mr. Bush's leadership is
personal, discreet, hands-on. (It's no accident that Michael
Deaver's former office is this president's private dining
room.) But whatever leadership is, it starts before the
water's edge.</p>
