	<p class="article-leader">A technique for inserting new genes into specific tissues
in the body is being developed at the University of Michigan
in Ann Arbor.
   In experiments on pigs, researchers there inserted a new
gene into cells of a small, limited section of an artery. The
genetically altered cells then began producing a new protein,
the product of the new gene, the Michigan scientists reported
in this week's issue of the journal Science.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The technique holds promise of a new way to treat diseases
such as heart disease and cancer as well as genetic diseases,
said Elizabeth Nabel, Gregory Plautz and Gary Nabel, of the
internal medicine department at the Michigan medical school.
Gary Nabel, who is Elizabeth Nabel's husband, also is with
the Howard Hughes Medical Institute on the Michigan campus.</p>
<p>A potential beneficiary of the new technique might, for
example, be a heart patient whose clogged coronary arteries
have just been reopened by surgery or other techniques. With
the new technique, a gene that produced a clot-preventing
protein could be introduced into the wall of the newly
reopened section of the artery, thereby preventing a clot
from forming and plugging the artery a second time.
Alternatively, a gene might be inserted that prevented
arterial cells from proliferating into a new, artery-clogging
deposit, the scientists suggested.</p>
<p>Another possibility, the researchers said, would be to
take a gene that produced a protein that activates the immune
system and insert it into the walls of blood vessels that
supplied a malignant tumor. This way, the immune system might
be triggered to launch a powerful but localized attack on the
tumor.</p>
<p>The experimental Michigan technique differs from
techniques planned for human gene therapy experiments that
were approved by federal regulators at the end of July. In
the latter experiments, scientists will inject volunteer
patients with blood cells that have been genetically altered
in the test tube. The gene-altered blood cells, it's hoped,
will produce proteins that will cure a devastating genetic
defect in one experiment and a lethal skin cancer in another
experiment.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Michigan scientists hope to insert new
genes directly into tissues in the body, rather than in
test-tube grown cells, and to confine the genetic alteration
to specific organs or anatomical sites rather than
circulating gene-altered blood cells throughout the body.</p>
<p>In their pig experiments, the Michigan scientists said
they took a mouse virus long used in medical research and
gave it a new gene that produces a protein called
beta-galactosidase. The protein turns blue when exposed to a
certain chemical, enabling researchers to tell which tissues
were producing the protein and which weren't.</p>
<p>A thin catheter with two balloons along its tip was
inserted into a thigh artery of each of 10 pigs. The two
balloons, separated by less than an inch of space, were
inflated, blocking the artery fore and aft. The genetically
altered virus was injected into the space between the two
balloons and allowed to infect the nearby walls of the
artery.</p>
<p>Subsequent tests with the blue-staining chemical showed
that the cells of the artery walls from infected pigs were
producing the beta-galactosidase protein and were still doing
so as long as 21 weeks later. Equally important from a safety
viewpoint, tests of other tissues such as the lungs, liver
and kidneys for the protein were negative, indicating that
the genetic alteration was confined to the short section of
the thigh artery.</p>
<p>The experiments show that the technique allows "the
introduction of recombinant genes into any site accessible to
a catheter," the researchers said. The technique doesn't
require several weeks of advanced preparation of cells in the
test tube and thus it should help make gene therapy easier
and more widely applicable, the scientists said.</p>
