	<p class="article-leader">PRINCETON, N.J. -- The David Sarnoff Research Center
signed a new agreement valued at more than $100 million to
continue research and development work with the consumer
electronics unit of Paris-based Thomson S.A.
   Under the multi-year agreement, the Sarnoff Center will
continue pursuing new technologies for television systems,
displays and TV receivers carrying the RCA name, officials
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Sarnoff Center, now a subsidiary of California-based
SRI International, was started at Princeton in 1942 by the
RCA Corp. Following RCA's acquisition by General Electric
Co., the consumer electronics business was acquired by
Thomson in 1987.</p>
<p>The Sarnoff Center is also part of a major consortium
trying to develop high definition television systems, in
which Thomson is also involved. In 1989, the Sarnoff Center
posted revenue of $77.4 million.</p>
