	<p class="article-leader">Enron Corp. said agreements have been reached for power
sales, joint-venture operations and gas supply for its
proposed $1.1 billion power project in Teesside, England.
   The Houston-based energy concern said the 1,725-megawatt
facility will be at ICI Chemicals & Polymers Ltd.'s Wilton
Works plant in Teesside, in northeast England. ICI is a unit
of Imperial Chemical Industries PLC.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The project is subject to a number of regulatory approvals
and would add roughly 3% to the power-generating capacity of
England and Wales. Sales agreements have been reached for all
1,725 megawatts of capacity.</p>
<p>The power sales agreements have an initial term of 15
years beginning April 1, 1993, with options to extend. Enron
said four regional electricity companies are expected to
assume a 50% equity ownership, while it will retain the
remaining 50% stake. ICI has an option to purchase up to 10%
of Enron's equity in the facility after commercial operation
has begun. The company said it expects to realize income from
certain project development fees this year, but didn't
elaborate.</p>
