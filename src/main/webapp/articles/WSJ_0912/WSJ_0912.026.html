	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Warner-Lambert Co. has been seized upon by
money managers as a stock sheltered from the effects of
recession. But some of the company's insiders are looking
elsewhere for shelter.
   Insider selling has historically been rare at the Morris
Plains, N.J., drug and consumer products company. This
summer, however, presidents of three of the company's
divisions have trimmed their holdings by $660,971 of stock,
according to insider filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Two of the sales occurred right around the time the stock
hit its 12-month high of $70.125 on Aug. 1. Did the insiders
believe the stock had peaked? They were out of the office
yesterday at the company's annual strategic-planning meeting
in Absecon, N.J., and couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>But Peter Wolf, a spokesman for the company, said, "The
(stock) market has got a lot of people making phone calls and
looking to diversify." Since the officers "still retain
significant holdings, (the selling) is not a display of lack
of confidence. The company's doing swell. "Warner-Lambert
stock hit its high last month on a prediction by Chairman
Joseph D. Williams that per-share earnings would be up more
than 16% this year. The same day, John F. Walsh, president of
the company's international operations, sold 2,011 shares for
$138,377. The shares represented 17% of his holdings.</p>
<p>On Aug. 8, Robert Serenbetz, president of the company's
confectionary division, American Chicle, sold 4,466 shares
for $226,469, according to SEC filings. That sale represented
about one-third of his holdings.</p>
<p>Those recent sales, along with a 4,600-share sale late
last June by Jay M. Gwynne, president of the company's Asia
and Australia Capsugell division, totaled more insider
selling than Warner-Lambert experienced in all of 1989 and
the first five months of this year combined, according to SEC
filings. Mr. Gwynne also sold about one-third of his
holdings.</p>
<p>The three executives who sold shares got prices ranging
from $64.25 to $68.81 a share. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Warner-Lambert shares closed
below that level, at $63.125, up 25 cents.</p>
<p>John Hoffman, associate director of research at Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co., which is recommending purchase of
the stock, said that although Warner-Lambert has declined in
the month, so have the prices of other drug and consumer
stocks. He said Smith Barney considers the stock "a
predictable grower which would weather a recession."</p>

<p>A CHANGE OF CLOTHES: The stock of ClothesTime Inc., an
Anaheim, Calif., apparel retailer, has nosedived from a high
of $13.875 late last year to less than $3 lately.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the company's chairman, Michael DeAngelo, has
been on a selling spree. He has sold 600,000 shares since
July 23 -- almost 60% of his holdings in the company -- for
$2 to $3.75 apiece, SEC filings show.</p>
<p>As previously reported, late last year, Mr. DeAngelo sold
763,467 shares, according to SEC filings. Some of those
shares fetched prices as high as $9.38, SEC filings show. Mr.
DeAngelo declined to comment on the insider sales.</p>
<p>Elizabeth A. Armstrong, analyst at Prescott, Ball & Turben
Inc., said that, for much of last year, the company
experienced double-digit gains in sales at its established
stores. But since about April, she said, there has been
"relatively small increases, or negative growth in sales."</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading, ClothesTime shares closed at
$2.375, down 18.75 cents.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A STRIDENT BULL: Arnold Hiatt, chairman of Stride Rite
Corp., made the largest insider stock purchase reported to
the SEC last week.</p>
<p>Mr. Hiatt spent $2.4 million on 98,000 shares of the
company, a purchase that increased his total holdings in the
Cambridge, Mass., shoe retailer by more than one-third, SEC
filings show. He declined to comment on his purchase.</p>
<p>The chairman paid an average price of $24.30 a share. In
New York Stock Exchange trading, Stride Rite shares closed
yesterday at $23.75, up 50 cents.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, ended June 1, Stride Rite had
record earnings of 60 cents a share, up from 49 cents a share
a year earlier.</p>
