	<p class="article-leader">In June of 1989, a Soviet teenager arrived at the Fort
Worth, Texas, airport sporting an overgrown Beatles mop, a
feeble Charles Bronson mustache and a Bruce Lee button.
Within the next couple of weeks, Alexsei Sultanov exhausted
local video stores of their kung fu movies; cheerfully pulled
two black snakes out of the swimming pool belonging to his
frightened Texas host ("I don't afraid of snakes, no," he
said); and walked away with the gold medal from the Eighth
Van Cliburn International Piano Competition.
   Mr. Sultanov, now 20 years old, is an electric pianist,
and Fort Worth audiences adored him. But the rest of the
world has more easily resisted this pint-sized powerhouse,
who produces rare excitement in his kinetic hammering but who
seems far from ready for the kind of career the Cliburn
competition attempts to launch. He was not the best among the
more than 200 contestants from nearly 40 countries. And he is
only a minor character in Joseph Horowitz's unusual and
probing account of the competition, "The Ivory Trade: Music
and the Business of Music at the Van Cliburn International
Piano Competition" (Summit, 276 pages, $19.95).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It is Mr. Horowitz's intention to discover what turned a
crude banger like Mr. Sultanov into an overnight sensation
with major concert engagements around the world and recording
opportunities. To do this, Mr. Horowitz, a former New York
Times critic, offers intriguing insights into nearly every
facet of musical life, the bizarre personality of the Cliburn
competition and Mr. Cliburn himself, while giving an
engrossing description of down-home Texans courting classical
music glamour on a grand, international scale. Mr. Horowitz
happens to view music competitions as a microcosm of "what
transforms and perplexes Western high culture in the late
20th century -- its popularization."</p>
<p>This is not a new theme for Mr. Horowitz. His previous
book, "Understanding Toscanini," examined the connection
between the rise of the celebrated conductor's spectacular
American career with the increasing use of hype to popularize
classical music. "The Ivory Trade" continues the story,
beginning with Mr. Cliburn's stunning 1958 Tchaikovsky
Competition victory in Moscow, which made the lanky American
a national hero overnight.</p>
<p>The Cliburn competition, born of a spontaneous notion at a
1958 Fort Worth banquet for Mr. Cliburn and held every four
years since 1962, attempts to re-create that kind of success.
In the process it has grown from a provincial mom-and-pop
operation to a slick, high-visibility, multimillion-dollar
operation. But it has not come close to finding another
Cliburn. Only two of its first-place winners, Radu Lupu
(1966) and Cristina Ortiz (1969), have gone on to have major
careers, and neither was made in the wake of the Cliburn
victory.</p>
<p>The landscape of competitions -- and not just the Cliburn
competition -- is littered with sad stories. Mr. Horowitz
pays special attention to Steven De Groot, a South African
uncomfortable in the limelight, who could not adjust to his
1977 Cliburn victory. Depressed and disillusioned, he turned
to teaching in 1981, saying that the experience had so
wounded him spiritually he was no longer even capable of
falling in love. Tragically he died of organ failure just as
the 1989 Cliburn competition was beginning and just when it
seemed he was at last ready for a career.</p>
<p>There are the bland winners who offend no one but who
impress no one either and return to obscurity. There are the
biased judges, promoting their countrymen; the incompetent
judges, minor piano teachers indulging in the luxurious
competition life. There are the wonderful talents too easily
weeded out in hasty, early preliminaries.</p>
<p>And yet competitions have always been an inherent part of
performing. Handel and Scarlatti, Mozart and Clementi, Liszt
and Thalberg dueled in public keyboard battles. Orchestra
musicians compete in auditions for jobs. Some way, too, must
be found to weed out pianists, given that approximately 8,000
graduate from American colleges and conservatories every
spring.</p>
<p>Love them or hate them, competitions also are riveting
dramas, which Mr. Horowitz describes vividly as he
investigates just how the Cliburn became such a mass-market
phenomenon. And in the course of his analytic investigations,
Mr. Horowitz -- cynical, big-city critic though he may be --
finds himself bewitched by Fort Worth, its democratic
audiences and its society. He even takes a surprising liking
for Mr. Cliburn, and offers captivating glimpses into the
weird home the pianist shares with his 90-year-old mother,
his many pianos and Christmas trees.</p>
<p>Mr. Horowitz also becomes passionately involved in the
fortunes of the players he favors. His favorites are losers
-- the unpredictable Portuguese Pedro Burmester and the
intense Russian Alexander Shtarkman -- and Mr. Horowitz's
mission becomes to find a way so that such talent can thrive.
The process of ranking finalists is too arbitrary, he
suggests, and the exposure is too sudden. But Mr. Horowitz's
story doesn't stop there. He has arranged for Messrs.
Burmester and Shtarkman, along with another former Cliburn
loser, William Wolfram, to appear next month at New York's
92nd St. Y in a series called "Goldfingers." And in doing so,
he has perhaps demonstrated the greatest value of
competitions -- they get people involved.</p>
