	<p class="article-leader">Warehouse Club Inc. said a sale-leaseback refinancing
transaction for as many as six facilities, which the discount
merchandiser announced last month, won't close by early
September, and may not close at all.
   The buyer, which Warehouse hasn't identified, "has
informed the company that it is having difficulty in securing
the required financing because of recent changes in the real
estate financing and capital markets," Warehouse said in
Chicago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Warehouse added that it "cannot at present determine when
or whether the transaction will close."</p>
<p>Warehouse had said earlier it expected proceeds of about
$2.5 million from the sale/leaseback arrangement, after
repayment of debt on the properties and certain other related
expenses. The company said in August that it planned to use
the proceeds for working capital.</p>
<p>Warehouse also said it will take a $1.8 million charge in
the year ending Sept. 30 to cover the closing earlier this
week of two unprofitable outlets, one in suburban Pittsburgh
and one in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
