	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- H.J. Heinz Co. said it expects fiscal 1991
net income to be about $2.10 a share, up about 11% over last
year's $1.90 a share but a smaller gain than seen in recent
years at the food company.
   Anthony J. F. O'Reilly, Heinz chairman, president and
chief executive officer, said at the annual meeting that the
company has felt pressure in recent months in its pet food
and Weight Watchers brand low-calorie foods.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Its 9-Lives cat food brand has been hit by more
competition following Alpo Petfoods Inc.'s entrance into the
category. Alpo has gained 10% of that market, Mr. O'Reilly
said.</p>
<p>Heinz said it plans to boost its Weight Watchers business
with a test market of a weight-loss plan that offers personal
counseling instead of traditional group sessions.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Reilly said international markets continue to
expand, with affiliates in Africa and the Pacific Rim showing
improved profits. Heinz plans to double the capacity at its
baby food plant in China in the next few months, he said.</p>
<p>Heinz said it has seen only marginal improvement in its
domestic tuna market; increased harvests of tuna have pushed
retail prices down, despite earlier projections that buying
from new sources could increase costs. Heinz has launched a
new advertising campaign promoting the company's decision in
April to stop buying tuna captured along with dolphins, Mr.
O'Reilly said.</p>
<p>Also, company shareholders approved a stock option plan
for key employees, including a provision that gives Mr.
O'Reilly options to buy four million shares of Heinz stock.
The stock plan was part of Mr. O'Reilly's new five-year
contract with Heinz.</p>
