	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The banking industry's deposit insurance
fund could require Treasury assistance if a recession
strikes, according to the General Accounting Office,
prompting some lawmakers to urge another increase in bank
insurance premiums.
   Charles Bowsher, comptroller general of the GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress, conjured up visions of a
crisis similar to the savings-and-loan debacle in testimony
before the Senate Banking Committee. He exhorted Congress to
avert a need for federal assistance by giving banking
regulators the authority to raise insurance premiums in the
Bank Insurance Fund higher than is currently planned.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We could lose this fund, just like we lost the {savings
and loan} fund," he warned the committee, adding: "We have a
lot of situations out there that could wipe the fund out."</p>
<p>The committee appeared eager to embrace any proposal that
would keep them from having to vote for a potential taxpayer
bailout down the road. "If action is necessary, let's take it
now," said Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the
committee. No one opposed Mr. Bowsher's plan to pile another
bank insurance premium increase atop one scheduled to take
effect next year in order to stabilize the fund.</p>
<p>Bankers generally have agreed that next year's scheduled
increase in assessments to 19.5 cents per $100 of deposits
from 12 cents per $100, is necessary, but that any increase
beyond that would be crippling.</p>
<p>Many analysts don't believe that the banking industry is
in as severe financial straits as was the thrift industry
when a bailout law was passed last year. The industry as a
whole has a stronger capital position, which acts as a
cushion for the deposit insurance fund. Nonetheless, Mr.
Bowsher and the committee found disturbing similarities in
how the industry is increasing its exposure to risk at a time
that its taxpayer-backed insurance fund is withering.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowsher cited, among other things, the insurance
fund's thinnest reserve ratio in its history, expected fund
losses for the third consecutive year, and a decline in the
value of the bank assets it holds. The fund balance has
dropped to $13.2 billion from $18.3 billion two years ago.</p>
<p>Moreover, the fund is weakest at a time when the industry
has exposed itself to greater risks than in the past.
Real-estate lending has increased 12% in the Northeast, for
example, and the region's nonperforming category of
real-estate loans has more than doubled in the past year.
Banks continue to be exposed to highly leveraged transactions
and loans to Third World countries. While risk has increased,
Mr. Bowsher said, there has been no relative increase in
equity capital, the cushion to absorb losses, for individual
banks.</p>
<p>William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., which oversees both the bank and thrift insurance
funds, said that he agreed with the GAO's projection that
bank fund losses could reach $2 billion this year. Moreover,
if Congress gives the FDIC the authority to raise insurance
premiums higher, the FDIC would consider it, he said.</p>
<p>He also hinted that the report may be a political reaction
to the S&L mess. "If I were the GAO, I would cover my rear
end, too," he said.</p>
<p>Kenneth Guenther, of the Independent Bankers Association
of America, said he thought the report was unnecessarily
bleak. "This is the darkest this kettle has ever been
painted. It doesn't do a lot for consumer confidence in the
financial system."</p>
<p>But the GAO testimony joins a growing chorus of concerns
about the health of the banking industry from private
economists, including Daniel Brumbaugh of Stanford University
and Robert Litan of Brookings Institution. The Congressional
Budget Office is scheduled to testify on the bank insurance
fund today and is expected to warn of an insurance fund
stretched too far.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowsher said that assessing the adequacy of the fund
is difficult because accounting rules are frequently used to
hide, rather than identify, problems. Of the 406 banks that
failed in 1988 and 1989, some 31 failed without ever
appearing on the problem-bank list or appearing for only one
quarter. The National Bank of Washington failed recently,
without ever appearing on the list.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowsher advised regulators to do more on-site
examinations, rather than rely on potentially misleading
audits. "Problems are bigger than are being reported," he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Bowsher predicted that 35 banks -- each with assets of
more than $100 million -- would fail this year, including 15
that have already folded. He wouldn't identify them, but said
that the combined assets of the 35 banks totals $45.1
billion. The group was culled from a pool studied by the GAO
that included the 100 largest banks and 200 of the largest
problem banks. None of the 35 are among the 20 largest banks,
Mr. Bowsher added.</p>
<p>Government policy is to maintain the fund at $1.25 per
$100 of deposits, but currently that figure has dropped to
about 70 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday's report provoked a flurry of proposals on
Capitol Hill by legislators reeling from the S&L bailout,
which is expected to cost at least $130 billion. Sen. Robert
Dole (R., Kan.) proposed raising an immediate $1 billion for
the fund by assessing U.S. bank deposits held in foreign
countries.</p>
<p>Rep. Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.) said he will introduce
legislation today to require banks to pay higher premiums.
Some members of the Banking Committee supported Mr. Bowsher's
proposal to raise the insurance premiums before Congress
recesses next month.</p>
