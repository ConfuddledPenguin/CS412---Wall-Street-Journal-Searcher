	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Tenneco Inc. said its packaging unit is taking
part in talks to buy mills and timberland from
Georgia-Pacific Corp. for about $740 million.
   The proposed purchase would be the most ambitious yet by
Tenneco's Packaging Corp. of America unit based in Evanston,
Ill. Already this year, Packaging Corp. has acquired a
corrugated products concern and a maker of specialty
paperboard trays. The unit, despite recent softness in some
of its profit margins, remains one of Tenneco's most
successful operations. The unit had net income of $200
million on sales of $1.3 billion in 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Atlanta, a spokeswoman for Georgia-Pacific said the
negotiations with Tenneco are in line with its plans to sell
off certain assets to reduce some $4 billion in debt incurred
in its acquisition of Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. But the
asset sales are strategic and not essential to handling its
debt load, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Georgia-Pacific, a forest-product concern, said it also is
continuing negotiations "with several interested parties" for
the possible sale of its huge paper mill in Toledo, Ore., as
well as box plants in Modesto, Calif. and Olympia, Wash.</p>
<p>A Tenneco spokesman said GE Capital Corp., a finance unit
of General Electric Corp. of Fairfield, Conn., and other
major investors will supply a "substantial amount" of
investment capital for the acquisition, but wouldn't specify
the amount. GE Capital would purchase the paper mills in
Valdosta, Ga., and Tomahawk, Wis., and lease them to
Packaging Corp.</p>
<p>Similarly, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. of
Boston and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, have
agreed in principle with Tenneco to acquire 540,000 acres of
Georgia-Pacific timberland in Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia
and Florida, and lease it to the Tenneco packaging unit.
Packaging Corp. currently manages more than 600,000 acres of
timberland. The potential transaction also includes the
purchase of 19 Georgia-Pacific box converting plants.</p>
<p>A Tenneco spokesman said the company was "confident" it
would face no antitrust problems with the potential
acquisition.</p>
<p>Packaging Corp. makes conventional brown boxes, as well as
specialty packaging such as foil delicatessen trays and foam
egg cartons. It operates more than 60 facilities world-wide.</p>
<p>Tenneco has pared down its disparate holdings in recent
years, chiefly by selling its immense oil unit in 1988, but
it still has far-flung holdings, including a large
farm-equipment unit, a natural-gas distribution business, a
ship-building unit and operations in auto parts and
chemicals.</p>
