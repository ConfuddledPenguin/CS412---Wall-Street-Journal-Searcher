	<p class="article-leader">Telephone service, reliable and efficient, had always been
the least of Margaret Olt's problems. But last spring, the
arthritic, 83-year-old widow became another casualty of the
long-distance industry's battle for customers.
   A telemarketer called Mrs. Olt at home. All he wanted, he
said, was to save her some money on her long-distance phone
calls by switching her service to MCI Communications Corp.
from American Telephone & Telegraph Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Annoyed by yet "another salesman," Mrs. Olt says, she hung
up on him. But when her next phone bill arrived from New
Jersey Bell, it showed a $5 charge from "some outfit called
the MCI."</p>
<p>In phone-industry parlance, Mrs. Olt had been "slammed."</p>
<p>She thus joined tens of thousands of telephone customers
around the nation who claim their phone service has been
switched without their consent. Apparently the MCI salesman
had authorized New Jersey Bell, the local phone company that
controls the connection to her house, to route all her
long-distance calls through MCI's lines instead of AT&T's.</p>
<p>MCI denies that it would slam a customer, and it contends
that it received oral approval for service from Mrs. Olt. It
adds that her service has subsequently been switched back to
AT&T. "It is not in our best business interests to slam
anybody," says John Worthington, MCI's chief counsel. He adds
that two months ago the company moved to clean up its
telemarketing by moving the people who verify customer orders
out of locations where sales calls are made and taking
supervisory responsibility for verifiers away from sales
managers.</p>
<p>Last year, in any case, at least 100,000 phone customers
complained to local phone companies that their long-distance
carrier had been switched without authorization. Bell
Atlantic Corp., the regional Bell company that owns New
Jersey Bell, says slamming complaints that it received rose
74% from 1988 to 1989, to between 60,000 and 70,000. Bell
Atlantic says that these totals reflect only verified
incidents and that the figures don't include switches due to
clerical errors or some other misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission and consumer
watchdogs say the problem is getting worse. Untold thousands
more consumers have been slammed but don't even know it or
didn't complain, phone-company executives and consumer groups
say.</p>
<p>"It's outrageous," says Richard M. Kessel, executive
director of New York State's Consumer Protection Board. "No
one should be switched without getting a full disclosure
beforehand and without signing a form that shows they agree
to the full terms and conditions of the change."</p>
<p>Customers plagued with extra charges and aggravation
aren't the only ones paying for slamming. Local phone
companies, the first place most customers call when they have
a phone problem, are spending millions processing the
complaints. Those costs increase the pressure on local rates.
Moreover, AT&T says slamming is costing it millions of
dollars, not only in lost revenue but also for processing
complaints from consumers who still think AT&T runs the
nation's phone system.</p>
<p>"It's been happening for the last couple of years, but it
reached a crisis stage in 1989," says Merrill Tutton, vice
president of consumer services at AT&T. However, AT&T's 70.4%
share of the long-distance market still far exceeds the 15.4%
for MCI and the 10.5% for US Sprint, a United
Telecommunications Inc. subsidiary.</p>
<p>Mr. Tutton says the biggest culprits are AT&T's longtime
rival, MCI, and companies that help sell its service. The FCC
agrees but says AT&T isn't blameless.</p>
<p>At the FCC, Kathie Kneff, chief of the informal-complaints
branch, says slamming complaints increasingly cite MCI, "but
we get complaints about other carriers, too, including AT&T."
In the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1989, slamming complaints
to the FCC were: Sprint, 154; MCI, 140, and AT&T, 29. In the
current fiscal year, complaints so far total: MCI, 387;
Sprint, 194, and AT&T, 22. However, most complaints don't go
to the agency.</p>
<p>Sylvia Rosenthal, executive director of Washington-based
Tele-Consumer Hotline, says more than 90% of the slamming
complaints it receives involve MCI and other rivals of AT&T.
"Once in a while, you'll get a complaint about AT&T, but it's
mostly because of a clerical error," she says.</p>
<p>MCI says it is capturing about 100,000 AT&T customers a
week. But Mr. Tutton says that when AT&T asks its former
customers why they left, more than 20% of those contacted say
they didn't know that they had given up AT&T service.</p>
<p>Last January, AT&T sued several of its rivals, including
MCI and its 25%-owned telemarketer, Pioneer TeleTechnologies
Inc., demanding they stop slamming. AT&T's complaint charged
MCI with fraud and deception, including telling AT&T
customers that AT&T was going out of business and that MCI
was a part of AT&T. No trial date has been set in the suit,
which was filed in the federal district court in Newark,
N.J., and has been moved to the district court in Washington,
D.C.</p>
<p>Both MCI and Pioneer, of Sergeant Bluff, Iowa, have denied
any wrongdoing, but a Pioneer spokesman says the company has
hired Arthur Andersen & Co. to audit its verification
procedures.</p>
<p>"It's true we're being blamed more than anyone else,"
MCI's Mr. Worthington says. "But we're making more
telemarketing calls than anyone else." AT&T, he complains,
"is wrapping itself in consumer clothes. But all it's got at
heart is its own commercial interests."</p>
<p>"What would you do if somebody was stealing your
customers?" Mr. Tutton replies.</p>
<p>Consumer groups say slammers prey especially on the
elderly, the hard-of-hearing and people with language
problems. Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer
Action in San Francisco, says most of the complaints fielded
by his organization and its affiliates in California are from
the elderly and Mexican-Americans. James Thompson,
consumer-affairs director of the American Association of
Retired People, says he is "astounded by the number of people
that have been ripped off by this." Fielding a recent
inquiry, he counted 270 letters complaining of slamming then
sitting on his desk.</p>
<p>"What this clearly shows is that MCI and others are
getting desperate in their battle with AT&T for market
share," says Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
"These tactics could backfire" with customers.</p>
<p>Slamming has become most acute in the past two years as
competition in the long-distance phone industry has heated up
and the players are consolidating. AT&T, trying to stem
erosion of its market share, is spending tens of millions of
dollars on ads that tell customers to get promises of deep
discounts from its rivals in writing.</p>
<p>US Sprint is counterattacking with ads that say, "Lighten
up, AT&T." MCI is waging a telemarketing blitzkrieg; it says
it is calling some seven million prospective customers a
month.</p>
<p>Long-distance phone companies needn't present the local
phone company with a customer's written authorization to turn
on service. The order is accepted by telephone with the
understanding that the long-distance company will produce a
signed form from the customer authorizing the change if a
customer disputes it.</p>
<p>Like most phone customers, Mrs. Olt didn't know all this.
She says she still doesn't understand the changes stemming
from AT&T's breakup in 1984.</p>
<p>AT&T's long-distance phone rivals deny that they switch
customers without permission. Some customers give oral
approval and then neglect to sign a form that the
long-distance carrier sends them to confirm their decision to
switch. Others say consumers' ignorance about how the
industry operates is causing confusion.</p>
<p>"This is something we're extremely concerned about," says
John Hoffman, Sprint's senior vice president for regulatory
and legislative relations. "Our {slamming} numbers are
relatively low. The fact is long distance is very
competitive, and people don't expect this."</p>
<p>After AT&T's breakup, the FCC ordered local phone
companies such as New Jersey Bell to provide AT&T's rivals
with equal connections to their local networks. This way,
customers wouldn't have to dial a cumbersome access code to
reach an AT&T competitor. Under this "equal-access" program,
customers could tell their local phone company which
long-distance carrier they wanted. Now, more than 90% of U.S.
phone customers have equal access to all carriers.</p>
<p>(Customers who didn't notify the local company of their
preference were put into a pool and automatically assigned to
a carrier based on the carrier's share of the regional
market. So, if MCI had 10% of the customers in the market,
10% of the pool was assigned to MCI. Some customers who had
ignored repeated bulletins from their phone companies about
the change were later surprised to find that they had been
assigned to another carrier.)</p>
<p>Consumer watchdogs and regulators say the spread of equal
access has made it easier for AT&T's rivals to use the
slamming techniques, while still playing on customer
confusion -- and apathy.</p>
<p>Several big local phone companies, such as Bell Atlantic
and BellSouth Corp., were deluged with slamming complaints
last year. Thousands of businesses such as nightclubs and gas
stations have also been complaining that the long-distance
service they chose for their pay phones was switched without
authorization.</p>
<p>The Baby Bells and other big phone companies, such as GTE
Corp., provide service to millions of customers. So, the
percentage of complaints relative to their overall businesses
seems small. Jan Peters, executive director of the carrier
services organization at U S West Communications, a
subsidiary of the U S West Inc. regional Bell company, says
that out of 100,000 long-distance-carrier switches the
company processes per month, only about 500 to 700 are
disputed.</p>
<p>Since a service change normally costs as much as $5, most
of those customers paid a fee to their local phone company
for being switched if they couldn't prove that the change was
made without their consent. If they could prove a mistake had
been made, the local phone company, with FCC backing, made
the long-distance carrier pay the charge.</p>
<p>To recover the costs of processing these complaints, Bell
Atlantic has raised its fees. It now is charging carriers
$23.45 for each unauthorized residential switch and $39.96
for each commercial pay-phone switch. Despite those fees, Mr.
Edwards says Bell Atlantic's phone companies still expect to
see about 43,000 slamming complaints this year. BellSouth has
established similar fees to cover its costs. Ameritech, the
Midwest Bell company, says it is reviewing its current
charges to decide whether they warrant an increase.</p>
<p>The FCC is reviewing a request from AT&T that would
require written authorizations from customers before any
service changes. AT&T's Mr. Tutton notes that more than 30
groups have filed public comments supporting AT&T's petition,
including the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Office of Consumer
Advocate, the National Association of State Utility Consumer
Advocates, the U.S. Telephone Association and Southwestern
Bell Telephone Co.</p>
<p>But AT&T's rivals refuse to back the idea; they say such a
condition would favor AT&T's dominant position. Mr.
Worthington adds that MCI asks its customers to sign a
confirmation letter and return it for the company's records,
but that of the letters sent out, "we get back 30%." Although
the FCC "requires" such letters as proof that the customer
agreed to switch, the only penalty for failure to have them
is the fee for switching the customer back.</p>
<p>Although carriers are "responsible" for having the
letters, says Steven Spaeth, an attorney in the FCC's Common
Carrier Bureau, the FCC has "decided it's not a good idea to
force them." Mr. Spaeth indicates little sympathy for AT&T.
"AT&T seems to be concerned about a loss of revenues," he
says. "One, I don't think {AT&T's petition} would reduce the
number of abuses, and, two, it would give AT&T a firmer grasp
on market share than it has right now." Says Mr. Tutton: "He
seems to be a little cynical about this, as if AT&T has only
its self-interest in mind."</p>
<p>The local phone companies say requiring written
authorizations would drive up their processing costs.</p>
<p>Perry Wade Lawson of Sneedville, Tenn., doesn't buy any of
these arguments. Mr. Lawson, a 63-year-old with two
artificial hips and heart trouble, says he was slammed by MCI
earlier this year (a charge MCI denies).</p>
<p>"I told them I didn't want the service, and they switched
me anyway," Mr. Lawson complains. "I'm a businessman. I ran a
supermarket for 30 years, and I don't like the way MCI does
business."</p>
