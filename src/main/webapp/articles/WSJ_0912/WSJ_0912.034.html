	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- For seven weeks, liberal interest groups
have been amassing ammunition against President Bush's choice
for the Supreme Court, Judge David Souter. Now those groups
are about to unleash their assault -- and will be firing
mostly blanks.
   With the Senate Judiciary Committee set to begin its
confirmation hearing tomorrow, there is little organized
opposition thus far to the 50-year-old Judge Souter. After
poring over briefs he filed as New Hampshire attorney general
from 1976 to 1978, studying his actions as a state trial
judge from 1978 to 1983, and analyzing his 221 opinions as a
New Hampshire Supreme Court justice from 1983 to 1990,
several groups have voiced concerns about his receptivity to
claims of civil rights and liberties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But no one has apparently come up with the incendiary
statement or ruling that could be used to mobilize forces
against the judge as was the case in Robert Bork's ill-fated
nomination during the Reagan administration. As a result,
Judge Souter seems likely to be confirmed for the seat
vacated by retired Justice William Brennan.</p>
<p>Before he can be confirmed, though, Judge Souter must
steer his way through two or three days of detailed
questioning, primarily by Democratic committee members
struggling for insight into how the little-known nominee
views the Constitution and the court's role.</p>
<p>It is in his responses to this interrogation that liberal
groups hope to garner additional ammunition to stave off what
they fear will be a decidedly more conservative turn if Judge
Souter joins the court. Their best hope is that the former
Rhodes scholar and Harvard Law School graduate will commit a
major blunder in his testimony tomorrow or Friday, giving
them the weekend to begin to try to mobilize opposition. That
is a faint hope, as what little is known of Judge Souter is
that he is calm, cautious and thoughtful, not given to strong
or impulsive statements.</p>
<p>The process is in marked contrast to the 1987 nomination
of Judge Bork, when the nominee's own words and written
record provided the ammunition for a heated political
campaign to defeat him, albeit one that Mr. Bork's supporters
still say was distorted.</p>
<p>Liberal groups also press a subtle argument that the
burden is on Judge Souter to convince the committee that he
is qualified, rather than on his doubters to prove that he is
unqualified.</p>
<p>"David Souter must assure the Senate and the public that
he has an open mind, is forward-looking, and has a vision of
the Constitution which respects individual rights," says Nan
Aron, director of the Alliance for Justice, a coalition of
liberal groups. "If he fails to meet this burden, the Senate
should withhold its consent," she says.</p>
<p>Kate Michelman, director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, expresses a similar sentiment. "All the
evidence weighs against him; there is no evidence on the
other side. The question should be is there enough evidence
to confirm him."</p>
<p>What these groups want from Judge Souter are assurances:
that he recognizes a right to privacy implicit in the
Constitution, that he isn't a zealous adherent to the narrow
text of the Constitution, as they argue that one of his state
court opinions indicates.</p>
<p>In the delicate dance of Supreme Court confirmations, such
assurances are elusive, even when the nominees are
forthcoming. Questions are often posed by senators in terms
of abstract legal concepts, rather than specific cases, to
avoid forcing nominees to commit to views on which they might
later have to rule. But the more abstract the questions, the
more wiggle room there is for the nominee in answering, as
well as in following his own course of action once he is
confirmed.</p>
<p>Conservative groups have received Judge Souter's
nomination favorably, in part because they have been assured
by White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, a conservative
former New Hampshire governor, and others that Judge Souter
has little sympathy for the liberal path followed by the
Supreme Court in the 1960s and 1970s. A report by the
conservative Coalitions for America says Judge Souter's
record "paints a consistent picture of a conservative jurist
passionately devoted to the rule of law."</p>
<p>One strike against the argument of liberal groups that he
must persuade the Senate that he is qualified was the recent
vote of the American Bar Association Standing Committee on
the Federal Judiciary. The 15-member committee unanimously
gave Judge Souter its highest rating of "well qualified."</p>
<p>A few liberal groups, having already decided that Judge
Souter isn't likely to provide the assurances they want, have
decided to oppose the nomination. The most prominent of these
is the National Organization for Women.</p>
<p>Other groups continue to raise questions. "On civil
rights, abortion rights, equal protection of the law and
separation of church and state, Souter's record raises
troubling questions," says Arthur Kropp, president of People
For the American Way Action Fund, a civil-liberties group.</p>
<p>Democratic senators, including the Judiciary Committee
chairman, Joseph Biden of Delaware, and Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts, have spent the past few weeks boning up for
the hearing and are expected to engage in tough questioning.</p>
<p>In a speech yesterday, Sen. Biden said that with the
possible exception of Justice Sandra O'Connor's nomination in
1981, "David Souter has the slightest record on
constitutional law" of any nominee in 25 years. The senator
said he wouldn't seek "assurances" of Judge Souter's views.
But he said precedents of past hearings "suggest that there
is nothing wrong in putting to Judge Souter some rather
specific questions about constitutional issues -- including
religion, speech, civil rights and abortion -- and expecting
some rather specific answers."</p>
<p>Some Republican senators may also have tough questions,
from a different direction. Aides to some Republicans say the
senators want to be certain that Judge Souter doesn't feel
too locked in to old liberal court precedents and that he
feels free to reconsider those that he believes are based on
shaky foundations.</p>
