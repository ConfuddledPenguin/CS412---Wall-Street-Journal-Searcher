	<p class="article-leader">VIENNA, Va. -- The Greatest Show on Earth is coming to
shopping malls across the country.
   Ringling Bros. & Barnum & Bailey Circus, a unit of closely
held Irvin Feld & Kenneth Feld Productions Inc., is launching
a new national chain of circus-theme retail stores that sell
everything from clown noses to handpainted carousel figures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new venture, Ringling Bros. & Barnum & Bailey Retail
Inc., opens its first unit in late October at the Fair Oaks
Mall in Fairfax, Va. Additional stores are scheduled for
Farmington, Conn., and Short Hills, N.J. President Kenneth
Feld said the company plans to open six stores a year.</p>
<p>The stores will sell children's clothing, stuffed toys,
party favors and circus memorabilia. Items include
custom-made suspenders with cutout leather animals as snaps;
juggling kits and handpainted diaper sets. All merchandise is
made specifically for the stores and isn't sold at Ringling
Bros. & Barnum & Bailey Circus events.</p>
<p>The stores imitate a circus environment, featuring circus
wagon doors and three separate rings centered around circus
wagon reproduction showcases. Store personnel, trained by
graduates of the company's clown college, wear official
paint-splattered clown jumpsuits and entertain customers.</p>
<p>Feld Productions is a major live-entertainment company
with annual sales exceeding $260 million.</p>
