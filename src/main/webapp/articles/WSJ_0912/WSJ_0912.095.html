	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev forcefully
backed a sweeping plan to create a market economy within just
18 months, despite strong warnings from Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov that this would lead to a drastic fall in
living standards and soaring inflation.
   Mr. Gorbachev's remarks at a session of the Soviet
Parliament, after weeks of behind-the-scenes debate, seemed
to ensure that the radical proposals drafted by economist
Stanislav Shatalin have won out over Mr. Ryzhkov's more
cautious package.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Gorbachev told Parliament that, "I am more impressed
by the Shatalin program. It brings together the republics on
the basis of what we need." Mr. Ryzhkov, who has faithfully
carried out most of Mr. Gorbachev's orders since he became
prime minister in 1985, appeared stunned.</p>
<p>Although stopping short of criticizing the Soviet leader,
Mr. Ryzhkov told journalists that Mr. Gorbachev had never
told him so clearly about his preference for the rival plan.
"I heard this for the first time myself" at the Parliament
session, he said. He hinted strongly to journalists that he
would resign rather than preside over implementation of the
Shatalin plan.</p>
<p>A few hours later, the Parliament of the Russian republic
overwhelmingly endorsed the so-called Shatalin proposals by a
213-1 vote, and urged other republics to follow suit. Most
seem likely to do so.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev initially hoped that elements of both the
Shatalin and Ryzhkov plans could be combined into one
coherent whole. But the man charged with fusing them,
economist Abel Aganbegyan, said yesterday that the two plans
are incompatible, and attempts to find a compromise have
failed.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryzhkov and his government have worked on their
economic package for about a year, but their timid attempts
to introduce a market-oriented reform have caused growing
exasperation. Last month, Mr. Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin,
the president of the Russian republic, asked Mr. Shatalin to
head a committee charged with devising an alternative.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev is now expected to outline the definitive
draft version to Parliament today, and Mr. Shatalin says he
expects "it will be 99% my plan."</p>
<p>A final decision on the reform package is due to be taken
by the Soviet Parliament later this month after the nation's
15 republics have discussed it. If approved, it is expected
to form the basis of a new union treaty between the republics
and Moscow, which Mr. Gorbachev hopes to finalize by the end
of this year.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Ryzhkov and Mr. Shatalin agree that the Soviet
economy's rapid slide and shortages of basic goods can only
be halted by measures to end decades of central planning and
create a market economy.</p>
<p>They both advocate an initial period of "stabilization,"
followed by large-scale measures to sell off state assets.
They also agree on the need to set up social protection
measures, such as unemployment insurance.</p>
<p>But the two sets of proposals are far apart on several key
issues, both in concept and detail. Mr. Shatalin's package,
which would be implemented over 500 days, advocates strict
fiscal and monetary discipline, the introduction of private
ownership of property on a wide scale and the
decentralization of virtually all government functions.</p>
<p>During a six-month stabilization program, it would seek to
mop up many of the billions of rubles in circulation and cut
the 60 billion ruble ($100 billion) budget deficit to zero
through public sales of land and housing. Then, over the
course of the following year, Mr. Shatalin would sell off
state assets, delegate responsibility for key economic
affairs such as taxation and foreign investment to the 15
republics, cut government subsidies and free up prices on all
but about 150 essential items.</p>
<p>His concept would underlie the planned new union treaty by
establishing a committee of republican leaders, who would
decide what economic powers to give to central government.
The republics would have to allocate money for the functions
they delegate to the central government out of their own
budgets.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryzhkov told Parliament yesterday that he has several
principal objections to such plans. Delegating all economic
responsibility to republics, particularly for taxes, budgets
and banking, would mean nothing short of the breakup of the
Soviet Union, he said. "Will there be a united state or not?
Now it is called the U.S.S.R. What will it be called in the
future?" the prime minister asked.</p>
<p>He advocates keeping some central government control over
the economy, particularly during a difficult transition
period in which the budget deficit would be reduced, but not
wiped out. Companies would pay part of their taxes to a
central budget and the government would run some strategic
industries such as telecommunications, energy and heavy
industry as before, with continued planning by Moscow
bureaucrats. He would also keep tight government controls on
the nation's agricultural sector during an interim period,
and contends that Mr. Shatalin's plan would quickly bankrupt
one in four Soviet farms.</p>
<p>On the key issue of prices, Mr. Ryzhkov rejects outright
Mr. Shatalin's proposals to allow most prices to be set by
supply and demand. Although he agrees the topsy-turvy Soviet
pricing system needs reform, he estimates Mr. Shatalin's
plans would cause a 30% drop in living standards and soaring
inflation such as that plaguing Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryzhkov and his advisers instead want to raise prices
on nonessential consumer goods next year to new
government-set levels. Starting in 1992, the Kremlin would
then gradually allow prices to float. But first, Mr. Ryzhkov
insists, some strict antitrust laws must be implemented that
would break up the nation's huge industrial monopolies, or at
least prevent them from raising prices at will. At the same
time, the government would pay some compensation to consumers
to offset the effects of price rises.</p>
<p>"It's a dangerous thing to let go of prices," he said. "It
would lead to inflation that would be hard to stop."</p>
