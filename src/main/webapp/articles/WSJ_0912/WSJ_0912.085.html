	<p class="article-leader">Sun Electric Corp., Crystal Lake, Ill., said it sold its
Suntronic Systems division, which sells service station
management systems, to a company owned by Knightsbridge Inc.,
a Chicago-based investment concern, and Suntronic's managers.
   Though Sun Electric didn't disclose the value of the
transaction, it said one-half of the purchase price was paid
in cash and the balance in senior preferred stock in
Suntronic Technology Group Inc., the acquiring company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sun Electric said that, as a result of accounting
adjustments associated with the deal, it will record a
third-quarter pretax charge of $1.2 million. In the 1989
third quarter, Sun Electric had a loss of $3.5 million, or 44
cents a share, after a $2.6 million charge related to
restructuring.</p>
<p>It said the Suntronic unit, which has annual sales of
about $9 million, was sold to allow Sun Electric to focus on
further developing and expanding its core business of making
and selling diagnostic and test equipment for the motor
vehicle industry.</p>
