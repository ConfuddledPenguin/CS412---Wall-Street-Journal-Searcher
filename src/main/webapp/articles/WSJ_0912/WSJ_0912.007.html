	<p class="article-leader">CS First Boston Inc.'s effort to create an integrated
global investment bank is showing signs of strain.
   In an internal memo, the parent of First Boston Corp., the
big U.S. securities firm, said it will strengthen the
management role of a group of senior executives to coordinate
CS First Boston's far-flung operations better.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The memo, signed by CS First Boston's chief executive
officer, John M. Hennessy, said an executive committee of the
firm's senior executives will "be more actively involved in
the overall management of the CS First Boston Group under my
direction. This should serve to tie the firm more closely
together."</p>
<p>With much hoopla, First Boston and its European affiliate
merged in late 1988 to create New York-based CS First Boston,
billed as a privately owned, "truly global" investment bank
with closely linked units in New York, London and Tokyo.</p>
<p>But the combination has been hobbled by a slowdown in
traditional securities businesses and continued tensions
between First Boston investment bankers in the U.S. and
Europe. CS First Boston earned only $11 million last year.</p>
<p>The memo effectively puts the future of CS First Boston
more in the hands of its top executives -- even though Mr.
Hennessy will continue to have the final say.</p>
<p>The directive marks the latest management shift at the big
investment bank. Just last week, CS First Boston named
Archibald Cox Jr. president and chief executive of First
Boston Corp., which is the biggest part of CS First Boston.
The step removed Mr. Hennessy from day-to-day control of the
U.S. securities unit.</p>
<p>In an interview yesterday, Mr. Hennessy said the merger
will take time to gel. "It took almost four years before we
got our first ticket" after First Boston started seeking
merger advisory business in the late 1970s, he said.
"Building new products takes time. You have to be patient."</p>
<p>The CS First Boston executive committee will meet at least
once a month, the memo said, and will function much as a
corporate board. Besides Mr. Hennessy, the group will include
the top executives at CS First Boston and its three
investment banking units: Mr. Cox, Anthony Grassi, James
Maher, William Mayer, Hans-Joerg Rudloff, William Voute and
Allen Wheat.</p>
<p>But make no mistake. Mr. Hennessy said in the memo,
"Decisions will be made by consensus, but I will retain the
ultimate power of decision." Mr. Hennessy said in the
interview, "There are seven strong-willed guys around the
table . . . but I don't want people to get the idea this is a
debating society."</p>
<p>In Zurich, Credit Suisse, the big Swiss bank whose parent
controls 44.5% of CS First Boston, also slightly reorganized
Credit Suisse's executive board to reflect the investment
banking changes.</p>
<p>In the biggest change, Mr. Rudloff will step down from the
parent bank's executive board at year end to "concentrate" on
his present responsibilities as chairman and chief executive
of the London-based Financiere Credit Suisse First Boston,
the bank's European investment banking arm. Separately, he
joins CS First Boston's strengthened group executive
committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Rudloff's responsibilities on the parent bank's
executive board, which included monitoring certain investment
banking activities, will be assumed by current executive
board member Hans-Ulrich Doerig. Meantime, a longtime Rudloff
associate, Credit Suisse First Boston's deputy chairman,
Oswald Gruebel, joins the Credit Suisse executive board.</p>
<p>Mr. Rudloff said yesterday that the changes are consistent
with the Swiss bank's strategy to strengthen the management
resources involved in investment banking. "When you start a
management restructuring, you start at the top, and then from
there, other decisions flow," he said. "Many of us have had
to play dual roles" with respect to investment banking. "It
took time to sort it all out."</p>
<p>But by leaving the Credit Suisse executive board, Mr.
Rudloff eliminates a source of possible friction with CS
First Boston colleagues. Though the Credit Suisse post had
taken up little of his time in recent months, Mr. Rudloff's
presence on the powerful executive board was viewed by some
as an indirect provocation to Mr. Hennessy, to whom Mr.
Rudloff has reported for some responsibilities.</p>
