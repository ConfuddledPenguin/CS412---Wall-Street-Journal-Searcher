	<p class="article-leader">AmBase Corp. said its Home Insurance Co. subsidiary has
discontinued efforts to sell its US International Reinsurance
Co. unit because it couldn't get an attractive offer.
   James J. Meenaghan, chairman of Home Insurance, said the
company had negotiated with various potential buyers and it
had reviewed one offer that exceeded the statutory value of
USI Re, but decided against selling the company. "We decided
the net proceeds (of this one offer) weren't enough because
we believe the inherent value of USI Re is greater than the
price we could obtain in today's market."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>AmBase said the decision not to sell USI Re would have no
impact on previously announced agreements to sell Home
Insurance or a controlling interest in the company.</p>
<p>Last month, New York-based AmBase agreed to sell a 50.1%
stake in the company to an investor group shortly after it
had reached a separate agreement to sell Home Insurance to
Vik Brothers International. AmBase said it would proceed with
both offers until a definitive agreement is reached with one
or the other.</p>
