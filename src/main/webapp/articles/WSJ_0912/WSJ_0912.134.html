	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- A Canadian regulatory agency proposed removing a
ban on liquor advertising on television and radio.
   The only alcoholic beverages that can be advertised now on
television and radio are beer, some wine, coolers and other
beverages with less than 7% alcohol.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed change was requested by the Association of
Canadian Distillers. The industry group said the liquor
advertising ban is unconstitutional. It also has initiated a
legal challenge of the ban.</p>
<p>The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications
Commission said it will make its final ruling on the proposed
change after assessing public comments on issues such as the
effect of various types of alcoholic beverages on driving
offenses, domestic violence and work absenteeism.</p>
<p>Under the proposed amendments, the commission would
continue to clear all alcoholic beverages ads before they
were broadcast.</p>
