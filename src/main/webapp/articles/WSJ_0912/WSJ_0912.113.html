	<p class="article-leader">ARMONK, N.Y. -- International Business Machines Corp. said
it acquired a 5% interest in Hogan Systems Inc., a
Dallas-based maker of software for the banking industry.
   Details of the deal weren't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>IBM said the acquisition fits a recent pattern in which
the computer giant has taken equity positions in many small
software concerns, bolstering companies it considers to
provide strategic products. Hogan makes mostly accounting
software for large banks and thrifts.</p>
<p>IBM also said it extended through June 1995 an agreement
to market Hogan's software in the U.S., Canada and Puerto
Rico, and agreed to develop some projects jointly with Hogan.
The marketing agreement has been modified, however, so that
Hogan receives 50% of revenue from IBM's sales of its
products, rather than the previously fixed amount of $9.6
million a year.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Hogan
shares closed at $3.125, unchanged.</p>
