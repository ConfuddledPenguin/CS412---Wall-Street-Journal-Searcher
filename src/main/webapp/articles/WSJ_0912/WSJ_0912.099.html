	<p class="article-leader">Your July 17 page-one article said the American Contract
Bridge League believes that 95-year-old Ruth Thorpe is the
league's "oldest active bridge player." But in April an
article appeared in the ACBL Bulletin about my aunt, Isabel
Robarts Whiteside, who was 96 years old on Dec. 10, 1989.
She, not Ruth Thorpe, must be the oldest.
   She has been an ACBL member for 35 years and became a Life
Master in 1967. While no longer participating in national
tournaments, she drives from her home in Oroville, Calif., to
ACBL-sanctioned games in Chico and Marysville twice a week.</p>
