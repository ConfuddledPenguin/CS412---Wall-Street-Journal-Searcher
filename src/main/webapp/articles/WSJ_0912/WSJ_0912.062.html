	<p class="article-leader">Two consumer groups are seeking to pressure Canandaigua
Wine Co. to discontinue sales of its Cisco brand wine, a
high-alcohol-content product frequently sold beside
less-potent wine coolers.
   Though it isn't labelled as a wine cooler, Cisco is
available in a variety of fruity flavors, which the
Washington-based consumer groups say may lead buyers to
confuse it with such beverages. But Cisco has an
alcohol-content level of 20%, higher than many so-called
"fortified" wines and much higher than wine coolers, whose
alcohol content averages 4% to 5%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two groups, the National Council on Alcoholism and
Drug Dependence and the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, said they investigated the sale of the product in
black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Washington, where Cisco
has come to be known on the street as "liquid crack." The
groups said they will announce details today for a "national
grass roots" campaign to force the company to halt sales of
the product.</p>
<p>Canandaigua denied the consumer groups' charges. "We have
no indication nor evidence in the marketplace that this wine
is being mistaken for a wine cooler," said Marvin Sands,
chairman of the Canandaigua, N.Y., wine producer.</p>
<p>Fortified wines, which are made with cheap ingredients and
bolstered with alcohol, have long been associated with the
shadowy market of low-income alcoholics and indigents. But
the lobbying groups claim that the Cisco point-of-purchase
materials and the product's packaging may trick ordinary
consumers who may be looking for a simple wine cooler.</p>
<p>Cisco is pitched in point-of-purchase displays as a brand
that "Takes You by Surprise]" Cisco is sold in two sizes of
bottles with twist caps similar to traditional wine-cooler
packaging.</p>
<p>"We want to tell consumers what kind of product this
really is and to warn them so there aren't more people who
inadvertently consume it to the detriment of their health,"
said Christine Lubinski, director of public policy at the
NCADD.</p>
<p>"We believe that these allegations are purely hypothetical
and theoretical," said Mr. Sands of Canandaigua, which bought
the Cisco brand from a small Western winery two years ago. He
said, for example, that consumers couldn't be confused
because Cisco costs 50% more than wine coolers and is sold
only in single bottles, not in packs of four like most wine
coolers. What's more, he said, the product isn't advertised
on TV or radio like the other wine coolers.</p>
<p>But officials of the lobbying groups say the complaints
they've received and their own scouting of Washington-area
convenience stores suggests Cisco is often priced only
slightly higher than wine coolers. And it's not uncommon,
they said, to find single bottles of wine coolers in the
refrigerated "carry-out" section of some neighborhood stores.</p>
