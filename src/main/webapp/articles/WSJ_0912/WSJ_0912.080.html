	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Airline passengers bumped from
overbooked flights can turn down the free tickets and refunds
they're offered and sue for damages, a federal appeals court
ruled.
   In a case from Montana, a three-judge panel of the Ninth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a federal ban on direct
state regulation of airlines does not prevent a passenger
from suing under ordinary state law for harm caused by
airline practices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ruling allows William D. West, a Helena, Mont., patent
lawyer, to pursue a suit against Northwest Airlines for
selling tickets that cannot be exchanged or refunded but are
subject to bumping when flights are overbooked. West is
seeking punitive damages.</p>
<p>"Selling nonrefundable tickets limits a traveler's ability
to make changes but not the airline's ability . . . to switch
to a smaller-size aircraft, increasing the chances of
bumping," said attorney Cornish Hitchcock of the Public
Citizen Litigation Group, a Ralph Nader organization that
helped represent West.</p>
<p>The right to sue for overbooking was established in a 1976
Supreme Court decision, a case that started when Allegheny
Airlines bumped Nader from a Washington-to-Hartford flight.
In Tuesday's ruling, the appeals court said the federal
deregulation of airlines in 1978 did not prohibit all such
suits.</p>
<p>The airline was studying the ruling Tuesday and had no
comment, said its lawyer, Jon Metropoulos.</p>
