	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- United Press International, as part of a
long-running restructuring of editorial operations, is
closing bureaus in three Western states and laying off some
full-time reporters.
   UPI spokesman Milt Capps confirmed published reports that
bureaus in New Mexico, Wyoming and Montana, many of them
operated by one person, would be closed. As part of the
restructuring, the news service has also given layoff notices
to one-person bureaus in Michigan and North Dakota, Mr. Capps
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Capps wouldn't confirm the number of full-time
reporters or editors that have been or would be laid off. He
said that UPI at the same time is increasing its network of
stringers in those states and "exploring a number of joint
ventures at the state and regional level" with State News
Service and Financial World magazine.</p>
<p>"Virtually every bureau in the system world-wide is
affected either by increases or decreases," Mr. Capps said.
The changes in the editorial operations began six weeks ago,
he said, and would "last a number of months."</p>
<p>The news service is owned by Infotechnology Inc., which
also owns 47% of Financial News Network.</p>
