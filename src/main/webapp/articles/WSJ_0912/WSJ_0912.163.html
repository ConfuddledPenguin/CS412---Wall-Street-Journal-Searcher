Investors Service Inc. said it placed the credit ratings of
this tire maker under review for possible downgrade,
affecting about $900 million of long-term debt. The ratings
agency said it is examining Goodyear's profit outlook and
cash-flow protection for fixed charges, and is also focusing
on an appropriate valuation of its crude-oil pipeline
investment. Under review are Goodyear's senior debt, rated
Baa-3, revenue bonds, rated Ba-1, and commercial paper, rated
