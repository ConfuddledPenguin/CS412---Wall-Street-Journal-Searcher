	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Algoma Steel Corp. moved five big trucks past
picket lines early yesterday morning to retrieve dies used in
stamping out auto parts from its strike-ridden plants.
   Negotiations between Algoma and the steelworkers union
broke off on Aug. 24, and both sides said it is unlikely the
talks will resume anytime soon. The 6,000 Algoma steelworkers
have been on strike since their contract expired July 31.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move to retrieve the dies, an effort to honor a
contract with the General Motors of Canada Ltd. unit of
Detroit-based General Motors Corp., outraged union officials,
who resorted to calling Algoma "a bunch of liars." A union
official said the trucks' markings were covered up to prevent
identification. The company, a unit of Dofasco Inc., declined
to comment on that issue. Dofasco, Canada's largest
steelmaker, is based in Hamilton, Ontario.</p>
<p>An Algoma spokesman said, "We've shipped these parts out
of the plants to ensure GM a continued supply of these
unfinished auto parts." Some of the parts go to GM directly,
while others are sent to third parties for finishing before
being sent on to GM, he said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Algoma has a longstanding
customer-supplier relationship with GM. "If we did nothing,
GM would manufacture new dies, which would be used by
Algoma's competitors, and Algoma would lose that business,
and that would result in lost jobs," he said.</p>
<p>A GM official said that, while the company owns some of
the dies, its only role in the events is as a customer.</p>
<p>Union officials said the company didn't have any right to
move in while the strike is under way. "We think that this is
a low blow," Doug Watt, vice president of Local 2251 of the
United Steelworkers of America, said. "The company isn't
winning any friends." He said that Algoma is the only
supplier of the parts to GM, and that this is "a major GM
contract."</p>
<p>The Algoma spokesman wouldn't discuss the value of the
contract and wouldn't say where the 30 dies would be shipped,
though a person close to the company said some of the dies
would go to Dofasco plants.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, talks between the United Steelworkers and
Stelco Inc., a Toronto-based steelmaker, continued with the
aid of a mediator. Officials on both sides refused to comment
on the talks. The union represents more than 10,000 Stelco
employees who have been on strike since July 31.</p>
