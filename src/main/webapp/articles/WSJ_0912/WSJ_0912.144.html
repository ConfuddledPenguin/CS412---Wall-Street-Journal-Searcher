	<p class="article-leader">Eastern Airlines is making one more stab at attracting
business fliers: a chance to wallow in luxury and fool the
boss.
   The struggling carrier, scrapping for customers ever since
it went into bankruptcy proceedings 18 months ago, said it is
sharply increasing the number of first-class seats in its 157
aircraft, and will put travelers who typically pay full fare
into them for 15% to 35% less than the usual coach rate on
other carriers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And no one will ever have to know, Eastern indicated.
Tickets purchased under the plan will be for confirmed
first-class spots, but will be written as "Y" class tickets,
the standard designation for coach. The result: no clue that
the occupant sat in a wide leather seat, ate better food,
received priority luggage service, freshened-up with hot
towels or had an individual telephone.</p>
<p>"We're very conscious of corporate travel policies that
say employees must buy a coach ticket and pay a coach price,"
said Martin R. Shugrue, the bankruptcy court-appointed
trustee currently running the carrier. He said the new
Eastern program would "allow business fliers to honor that
policy and stretch out and enjoy" fancier service.</p>
<p>So far, Eastern has had difficulty in attracting regular
business fliers -- people who make last-minute travel plans
and pay the full rate for tickets. Those travelers tend to be
finicky but loyal and consistent customers.</p>
<p>Eastern's much-publicized labor and financial difficulties
scared off such passengers, leaving it instead with leisure
fliers who buy deeply discounted seats far in advance.
Eastern will continue to offer cut-rate coach seats, but
needs a clientele of business travelers to return it to
profitability.</p>
<p>The idea of offering such favored customers the chance to
fly first class isn't new, of course. Continental Airlines
allows full-fare coach passengers to move into first class on
certain flights when space is available. Most carriers let
frequent fliers cash in some of their mileage credits to
upgrade. Delta Air Lines, for example, says that more of its
frequent fliers cash in mileage for that purpose than save up
for free trips to far-off places.</p>
<p>But Miami-based Eastern yesterday called its latest effort
to attract the much-sought-after business traveler
"revolutionary." And it needs some kind of dramatic measure,
industry officials agree. Just last week, Eastern was ranked
next to last among all U.S. and foreign carriers in the Zagat
annual survey of airlines, just ahead of the Soviet
state-owned carrier Aeroflot, never renowned for service.</p>
<p>The perennially upbeat Mr. Shugrue insisted in an
interview that the lure of first class will put Eastern back
on track. "The seats are bigger, the food's better, the booze
is free -- what else can you ask for?" He said Eastern will
heavily promote, explain and sell the program. Once a
passenger tries it, he predicted, "we've got you; you're
ours."</p>
<p>Eastern did its homework on the plan, Mr. Shugrue
maintained. It studied corporate travel policies and
interviewed chief financial officers at a number of major
corporations and also polled travel agents to determine what
business travelers are allowed. In most cases, "corporate
travel departments say to employees, `you must fly at the
lowest available economy fare.' That's what this fare is," he
said.</p>
<p>By even slightly undercutting rivals' full coach fares,
Eastern would apparently satisfy such corporate directives.
While rivals could promptly match Eastern's lower rates and
wipe out that edge, they aren't likely to, industry experts
said.</p>
<p>Eastern said its lowest full coach fare, 35% below rivals,
will be for a ticket purchased three days in advance. It said
its fare for same-day travel is 15% lower than rivals. The
new fares take effect Oct. 1. All tickets will be refundable
and carry no penalty for cancellation or change, continuing a
previous Eastern offer.</p>
<p>Though it tailored prices to corporate travel rules,
Eastern still must win over those who do the traveling. "Once
you lose passengers, the only way to get them back is to do
something different -- something measurably more than other
airlines," said Phil Davidoff, president-elect of the
American Society of Travel Agents.</p>
<p>Customer resistance "can be overcome, if the quality of
the product is good," added L. John Eichner, president of
Simat, Helliesen & Eichner Inc., an aviation consultant. He
warned, however, other measures of service can't slip:
"People don't forgive late planes and canceled planes."</p>
<p>Some in the industry believe that Eastern doesn't have
much time to pull off a turnaround, even if the idea does
catch hold. Eastern's bankruptcy-court creditors have been
patient so far, and Mr. Shugrue insists he has no deadline.
But he has been in charge more than four months since the
court took control of the carrier away from Continental
Airlines Holdings Inc., which still holds its equity. While
Eastern's losses have narrowed in that period, the carrier is
still operating in the red. Recently, an outside investor was
trying to interest creditors in a liquidation plan for the
carrier; Mr. Shugrue has said he will only consider a sale of
the entire carrier.</p>
<p>"To become profitable, you've got to get a higher
percentage of travelers paying more than $200 a seat," said
Mr. Davidoff, the travel executive. To that end, Eastern is
adding 10 to 12 first-class seats on its planes at a total
cost of $8 million. That represents increases of 50% to 100%,
depending on type of plane. Eastern said it is also adding
flight attendants in the section, along with the leather
upholstery, telephones and other amenities.</p>
