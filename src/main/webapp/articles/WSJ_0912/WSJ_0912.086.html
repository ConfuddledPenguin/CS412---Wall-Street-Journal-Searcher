	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Lawyers at the Federal Trade Commission are
unhappy again with the U.S.'s major rare-coin grading
service, with whom the agency settled a big false-advertising
case last month.
   The coin grader, Professional Coin Grading Service Inc. of
Irvine, Calif., has mounted a public relations campaign in
which it portrays the long FTC investigation and subsequent
FTC lawsuit against the company as positive developments. The
reason the company can argue that: Although Professional Coin
signed a consent decree with the FTC, the company didn't
admit or deny wrongdoing, or pay any fine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The campaign included a nearly half-page ad in yesterday's
Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>"After taking an extensive look at PCGS," the Professional
Coin ad declares, the government "did NOT ask us to change
any of our policies or procedures."</p>
<p>That's technically true, if one reads only the consent
decree. But FTC lawyers strongly dispute Professional Coin's
claim that the agency, in effect, gave the company a clean
bill of health. Signing a consent decree is standard practice
in settling civil enforcement actions with the government.
But that doesn't change the fact that the FTC had accused the
coin firm of making "numerous" false and misleading claims
about its objectivity, FTC lawyers say.</p>
<p>Indeed, among other things, the FTC lawsuit said
Professional Coin hadn't provided the "objective or
consistent grading" the company claims and that it did not
"in all cases observe its `strict anti-self interest
policy.'" The consent decree bars Professional Coin from
making false claims in the future.</p>
<p>Barry J. Cutler, director of the FTC's bureau of consumer
protection in Washington, said: "When PCGS goes around
telling everyone they should take a look at the consent
agreement, I wish they'd take a look at the complaint as
well." Mr. Cutler added that the agency doesn't file a
complaint unless it has "reason to believe the allegations
are true." He said the FTC hasn't asked Professional Coin to
change its new ad.</p>
<p>David Hall, Professional Coin chief executive officer,
said, "I don't know for a fact that the FTC doesn't like our
ads. They haven't talked to me about it. But we've always
cooperated with the FTC, and certainly our intention is to do
things in the right way."</p>
<p>The FTC's Mr. Cutler said one good thing is that the
Professional Coin ads, in line with the consent agreement, do
include many more warnings about the volatility of the
rare-coin market than typical coin-company ads of the past.
The important thing, said Mr. Cutler, is that investors and
big Wall Street brokerage firms have been put on notice that
rare-coin investing isn't fail-safe, despite the inroads of
grading services such as Professional Coin.</p>
<p>"I think we fired a rifle shot, and we got attention where
we want to get attention," said Mr. Cutler.</p>
<p>Professional Coin says it has graded nearly 2.3 million
coins valued at about $2.5 billion since its founding in
1986.</p>
