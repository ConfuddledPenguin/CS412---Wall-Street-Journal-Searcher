	<p class="article-leader">The battle betwixt your editor, Robert L. Bartley, and
special prosecutor Lawrence W. Walsh on L. Gordon Crovitz's
remarks on the costs of the Iran-Contra prosecutions
(editorial page, Aug. 9) would be hilarious if the dispute
did not strike at the very foundation of our once-superb
political system. After reading Mr. Walsh's letter one can
only agree with attorney Joseph N. Welch's admonition to Sen.
Joseph McCarthy, June 9, 1954: "Let us not assassinate this
young lad further, Senator. You have done enough. Have you no
sense of decency, sir, at long last]"
