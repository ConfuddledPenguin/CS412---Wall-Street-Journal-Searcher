	<p class="article-leader">FAIRFAX, Va. -- American Capital & Research Corp. agreed
to buy Elder Resources NZFP Ltd.'s 50% interest in two
engineering joint ventures, giving American Capital full
ownership of the units.
   Terms weren't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale is part of Carter Holt Harvey Ltd.'s plan to
divest all of Elder Resources' non-forest assets. Last month,
Carter Holt, a New Zealand concern, acquired 52.7% of Elder
Resources from Elders IXL Ltd., an Australian company.</p>
<p>American Capital said the acquisition of the units, Kaiser
Engineers Australia Pty. Ltd. and Kaiser Engineers
International, will reunite all of the Kaiser Engineers
companies under a single owner. American Capital already owns
the Kaiser operations in the U.S.</p>
