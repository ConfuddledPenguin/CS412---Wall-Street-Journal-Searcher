	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency proposed
tighter standards on carbon monoxide emissions from cars and
light trucks, with the goal of cutting per-vehicle emissions
29% a year and saving as much as 43,000 barrels of oil a day.
   The regulations, which would be phased in for new models
between 1993 and 1995, are estimated to add $19 to $31 to the
average price of a new vehicle. Over the life of the vehicle,
however, owners would realize net savings of $1 to $12,
because of improved fuel economy resulting from more-complete
combustion, the agency said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposal would require auto makers to meet carbon
monoxide standards for tailpipe emissions at temperatures as
low as 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Currently, controls apply only
as low as 68 degrees Fahrenheit. The EPA said carbon monoxide
concentrations increase significantly at colder temperatures.</p>
<p>Vehicle tailpipes spew carbon monoxide as a result of
incomplete fuel combustion. Emissions are particularly high
during the first few minutes after an engine is started, when
it needs extra fuel.</p>
<p>Carbon monoxide, when inhaled, weakens the amount of blood
pumped to various parts of the body and causes a reduction of
oxygen available to muscles and organs. Cigarette smokers and
people with heart disease are especially at risk. Carbon
monoxide emissions exceed federal limits in 41 urban areas.</p>
<p>Some proposals pending before the House-Senate conference
committee that is considering clean-air legislation would go
beyond the agency proposal in regulating carbon monoxide
releases. The EPA said it is studying whether further
regulation is warranted.</p>
<p>The new standards would establish a limit of 10 grams a
mile for passenger cars, 12 grams a mile for trucks weighing
as much as 3,750 pounds and 15 grams a mile for trucks up to
8,500 pounds. Manufacturers that make fewer than 10,000
trucks a year and trucks weighing more than 6,000 pounds
would be exempt from the rule until the 1995 model year.</p>
<p>To meet the new standards, auto makers will have to
improve the engine calibration in most vehicles. Some models
may need multipoint fuel injection for more-precise fuel
control or air injection to provide additional oxygen to the
catalytic converter during starts in cold weather, the agency
said.</p>
<p>The proposed rules will be published in the Federal
Register soon. In addition, the agency will conduct a public
hearing on the proposal 45 days after publication of the
rules.</p>
<p>Auto makers said they've been working with the EPA on
standards for carbon monoxide emissions and expected a
proposal requiring tighter standards at colder temperatures.
However, they declined to comment further until they've had
time to review details of the proposal.</p>
