	<p class="article-leader">Sen. Joseph Biden got a possible Borking started yesterday
by attacking David Souter as an "interpretivist." Sen. Biden
referred to the "harshest" followers "under this common
banner," citing Judge Learned Hand and Justice Hugo Black. By
trying to smear these hitherto honored judges, Sen. Biden
apparently wants to push the "mainstream" far out enough to
exclude any nominee who cares at all what the Constitution
says.
   Indeed, even Justice William Brennan in the foreward to
Justice Black's 1986 memoirs said his place in the "pantheon
of great Justices of the Supreme Court grows more and more
secure with each passing year." Under Sen. Biden's radical
new litmus test, would even Justice Brennan be qualified to
replace Justice Brennan?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sen. Biden's efforts aside, there probably won't be any
surprises along the way to Justice Souter. No one imagines he
would be a judicial activist eager to find shadows, penumbras
or emanations of the Constitution. What we don't know is how
seriously Judge Souter would take his obligation to uphold
the Constitution.</p>
<p>That is, will his understanding of the original meaning of
the Constitution come first? Or will he feel obliged to
follow even illegitimate prior cases?</p>
<p>This question of "stare decisis", or following precedent,
has never been so important. Many Supreme Court opinions now
on the books ignore the Constitution. To the extent these
cases offer rules (as opposed to vague five-prong tests and
multilayer balancing factors), these rules are of
questionable validity. With a new conservative majority, the
excesses of judicial activism will erode quickly or slowly,
depending on how bound the justices feel to the illegitimate
precedents of the past 30 years.</p>
<p>The current ground rules are clear. Conservative judges
are supposed to adhere to precedent, which liberal judges are
free to ignore. Federal Appeals Judge Richard Posner explains
that many conservatives accept the argument that "a good
liberal judge gives little weight to precedents that are not
liberal, but a conservative judge gives great weight to all
precedents, liberal as well as conservative." This creates
what Judge Posner calls a "built-in ratchet" so that "the law
will necessarily grow more liberal."</p>
<p>This double standard is no exaggeration. Any doubters
should consider the answer a judicial nominee gave when a
senator asked what he would do if clear prior law or cases
required a ruling that "offended your own conscience":</p>
<p>"If I were faced with a situation like that, that ran
against my conscience, I would try to find a way to follow my
conscience and do what I perceive to be right and just. Not
that, I would hope not, it would mean I would act
arbitrarily. I was born and raised in this country, and I am
steeped in its traditions, its mores, its beliefs, and its
philosophies; and if I felt strongly in a situation like
that, I feel it would be the product of my very being and
upbringing. I would follow my conscience."</p>
<p>This was the response by Harry Pregerson, now a federal
appeals judge in California, but it is typical of the views
of many liberals Jimmy Carter appointed who promised not to
let the Constitution get in the way. Imagine if Judge Souter
said any such thing.</p>
<p>Judge Souter wasn't often confronted by this kind of
judicial activism when he was on the New Hampshire Supreme
Court, but a review of his some 200 opinions finds about a
dozen cases where the issue played a large role. There is no
liberal-conservative pattern, but he does show some
willingness to consider whether earlier cases were based on
any authority.</p>
<p>For example, he overturned an earlier New Hampshire case
for which he could "perceive no intellectually realistic
basis." As a result, he raised the burden of proof in civil
proceedings for committing people to mental institutions up
to the level required in criminal proceedings. In another
case, he dissented from an opinion abolishing special fees
for probate court. Reading the state constitutional clause
"as it was understood when the framers proposed it and the
people ratified it" in 1784, he said, it was clear that the
prohibition against payments was to stop bribery of judges,
not to outlaw regular statutory fees.</p>
<p>In a case that decided a later owner with no contract
could still sue a builder for latent defects, Judge Souter
issued a one-sentence dissent, "Because I am not satisfied
that there is an adequate justification to repudiate the
rationale unanimously adopted by this court a mere two years
ago." In another case, he enforced precedents on levels of
worker's compensation. "Our obligation is to construe the
statute, not to render its language meaninglessly protean,"
he wrote.</p>
<p>It's important to remember that "stare decisis" is a
method, not a principle. That is, throughout Anglo-American
jurisprudence, judges have abided by the reasoning in earlier
cases as a way to thread cases into one predictable rule of
law. Indeed, until recently, the duty of "stare decisis" was
the best guarantee that judges would not make up the law
willy-nilly.</p>
<p>Then liberal judges systematically rejected any obligation
to precedent. This helps explain the recent breakdown in tort
and contract law. Justice William Brennan refused to uphold
any death penalty. He knew he was making policy instead of
applying the Constitution, but said he found "flexibility
with respect to the call of `stare decisis'." Indeed, liberal
justices established the rule that a precedent can turn into
a pumpkin after 24 hours. On a Wednesday this past June, the
Supreme Court upheld the Arizona death penalty. On the
Thursday, the liberal minority took advantage of the fact
that two conservative justices had to recuse themselves, and
invalidated the same death-penalty law.</p>
<p>There is one good reason to abandon "stare decisis" when
deciding a case. This is when the precedent itself is not
part of any seamless web of judicial interpretation, but
instead is pure judicial lawmaking. Why use a tool meant to
honor precedents to uphold a precedent that itself ignored
long lines of precedent?</p>
<p>Justice Antonin Scalia made a similar point in a dissent
in a death-penalty case last year. Justice Scalia said he
opposed a two-year-old ruling that a jury can't take into
account a victim impact statement when deciding whether to
order the death penalty. "I think it would be a violation of
my oath to adhere to what I consider a plainly unjustified
instrusion upon the democratic process in order that the
court might save face," he wrote. Except for a few decisions
that "have become so embedded in our system of government,"
Justice Scalia said the court should not hesitate to excise
an unjustifiable precedent. "We provide far greater
reassurance of the rule of law by eliminating than by
retaining such a decision."</p>
<p>When asked, Judge Souter might say that what counts is
that a precedent was a good-faith effort to apply the
Constitution, not a judge's "conscience" or his policy views.
If a judge in an earlier case ignored the Constitution, he
should expect no presumption of "stare decisis".</p>
