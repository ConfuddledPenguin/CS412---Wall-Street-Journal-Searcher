	<p class="article-leader">Equifax Inc. said it and Telecredit Inc. set special
meetings of shareholders for Nov. 7 to vote on Equifax's
acquisition of Telecredit in a stock swap currently valued at
about $489 million.
   Equifax, an information-services concern in Atlanta, said
shareholders of record of the two companies as of Sept. 21
will be entitled to vote at the respective meetings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The definitive agreement calls for Telecredit shareholders
to receive 2.69 shares of Equifax common for each share held.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Equifax
closed at $16.375 a share, down from $19.50 a share when the
deal was announced June 21. The exchange will bring the price
for Telecredit to $44.05 a share. However, Equifax has the
option, but not the obligation, of increasing the exchange
ratio to bring it to a $50-a-share value. Telecredit, a check
authorizer and credit processor based in Los Angeles,
conversely can terminate the transaction if the deal doesn't
fetch a bottom price of $50 a share.</p>
<p>Both companies said that proxy materials will be sent to
holders about Sept. 21.</p>
