	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Raiders football franchise
has signed a 20-year agreement to remain in Los Angeles,
ending years of uncertainty for managing general partner Al
Davis, several California cities and exasperated fans.
   Under the terms of the agreement, the private management
of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will renovate the
67-year-old facility at a cost of about $145 million, which
will include the construction of 204 lucrative "luxury
boxes," a key demand of Mr. Davis and a perk he said he had
been promised when the team moved from Oakland in 1982.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since the Raiders left Oakland in 1982, the team has been
involved in litigation with the National Football League, the
city of Oakland and the Coliseum Commission. The Raiders
considered moving to the Los Angeles suburb of Irwindale,
were courted by Sacramento and earlier this year agreed to
return to Oakland when the city offered a package worth $602
million, which was later reduced, and then finally squelched
by community opposition. Meanwhile, Raiders attendance last
year dwindled to less than 50,000 per game in a stadium that
seats more than 90,000. The renovated Coliseum will seat
about 72,000.</p>
