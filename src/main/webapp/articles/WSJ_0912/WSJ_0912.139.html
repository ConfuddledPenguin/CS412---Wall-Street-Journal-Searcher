	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- U.S. and Japanese officials are moving against a
deadline to defuse a dispute over American access to Tokyo's
market for so-called amorphous metals.
   At stake is Allied-Signal Inc.'s future role as a supplier
of the metals for electrical transformers to Japanese
electric power companies. But also, an underlying problem
bedevils U.S. negotiators: What can the U.S. do when Japan
refuses to buy a proprietary American product even as
Japanese companies, with government support, scramble to
develop it themselves?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hints of an 11th-hour deal surfaced last week, when
Japanese and U.S. officials began huddling in an effort to
resolve the issue. The Japanese deny the allegations of
discriminatory behavior, but sources from both sides suggest
that a commercial agreement that guarantees market access for
Allied-Signal could provide a face-saving resolution to the
issue.</p>
<p>Unless a deal is struck by Saturday, Allied is expected to
reinstate its complaint, filed in March under Section 301 of
the U.S. Trade Act, that the Japanese government and certain
companies colluded to block Allied's product from Japan's $90
million annual market for the metal cores used in
electric-power transformers.</p>
<p>At Washington's request, Allied suspended its petition
earlier this year so the U.S. and Japan could work on a
solution. Reinstatement of the complaint would result in an
investigation by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative,
which could order retaliatory action against Japanese imports
to the U.S.</p>
<p>A clash is likely to reignite concern that Japan's
targeting of economically strategic technologies robs the
U.S. of the commercial benefits of American scientific
research. That suspicion has been at the core of disputes
over Japanese policies on such sophisticated products as
supercomputers, satellites and telecommunications equipment.</p>
<p>While Japanese bureaucrats often insist that their
influence over Japanese companies has ebbed as the companies
gained financial muscle, foreign economists and industry
officials say the bureaucrats still play an important role in
nurturing promising industries.</p>
<p>"Japanese industrial policy is alive and well, and it's
increasingly focused on high-tech industries," says Edward
Lincoln, an economist at the Brookings Institution in
Washington. Japanese bureaucrats' response to foreign
criticism has been "not to stop doing what they're doing, but
to stop saying what they're doing," says Mr. Lincoln, author
of a recent book on Japan's foreign trade.</p>
<p>Allied-Signal, based in Morristown, N.J., charges that the
unwillingness of Japanese utilities to install
amorphous-metal transformers, except for experimental
purposes, is a classic case of industrial targeting. Allied
says it poured $200 million over 20 years into developing the
material, and holds exclusive patents on it. But Japanese
companies have spurned the product, even as they make a major
effort, with government help, to make the product themselves,
Allied maintains.</p>
<p>The company says it has collected evidence since the late
1970s: a Japanese government-sponsored research group on
amorphous metals; a subsidized loan to Japan's largest steel
maker to develop a manufacturing process for the material; a
Japanese agency's efforts to persuade Allied to license its
know-how to numerous Japanese manufacturers, despite Allied's
desire to negotiate only with selected companies; and,
according to the company, efforts by members of the research
consortium to impede Allied's patents.</p>
<p>Amorphous metals, unlike conventional metals with their
crystalline molecular structure, have an irregular structure
similar to that of glass. The material's strength, hardness,
flexibility and unusual magnetic properties could ultimately
give it a range of industrial uses. But
electrical-transformer cores are by far its biggest market so
far.</p>
<p>Japanese industry officials agree that amorphous metals
cut energy loss from transformer cores by about 70%. But they
say more research is needed to deal with other concerns --
such as the material's ability to withstand Japan's frequent
earthquakes and lightning storms, and possible extra costs to
install and maintain the units.</p>
<p>Allied contends that studies in the U.S. and Japan have
already eliminated such concerns, and it says the utilities
are stalling. None of the estimated 50,000 transformers in
commercial use in the U.S. has failed, says David Hill,
senior vice president in charge of Allied's Metglas amorphous
metal division. Allied estimates that 5% of new transformers
in the U.S. use amorphous-metal cores, and expects a 50%
share by 1995.</p>
<p>But ultimately, Allied's charge of exclusionary behavior
by the Japanese utilities rests on circumstantial evidence:</p>
<p>-- Nippon Steel Corp., with backing from the
government-run Research Development Corp. of Japan, in 1987
developed a manufacturing technique for amorphous metals
based on work done at one of Japan's national universities.
Nippon Steel is Japan's largest supplier of silicon steel for
conventional transformers. The company is also one of the
largest users of electric power in the country.</p>
<p>-- Ryusuke Hasegawa, a Japanese-educated scientist who
represented Allied's amorphous metals operation in Tokyo in
the late 1980s, says he received subtle hints from Japanese
transformer companies that utilities were delaying investment
in the material until Japanese steel makers could compete
with Allied.</p>
<p>Officials from Japan's three largest utilities, Tokyo
Electric Power Co., Kansai Electric Power Co. and Chubu
Electric Power Co., all deny any suggestion of a concerted
boycott against Allied. Each company says it will base
purchase decisions on cost, quality and reliability of
supply, and that it won't consult with other utilities. Tokyo
Electric and Chubu Electric also say they won't begin
investing in amorphous-metal transformers on a large-scale
commercial basis until at least 1993 -- the year Allied's
basic patent expires.</p>
<p>That timing, the companies say, is coincidence. Some note
that Allied's related patents have longer to run. Fumio
Kodama, general manager of Nippon Steel's intellectual
property division, says that even after the main patent's
expiration, his company couldn't manufacture amorphous metals
without know-how from Allied. Mr. Hill confirms that Nippon
Steel and Allied continue to negotiate a licensing agreement.</p>
<p>Allied and U.S. government officials, however, say they
worry that Nippon Steel or other companies could find ways
around the process patent by 1993. "What we want to avoid is
a situation where there are hints and winks and nods {about
buying material from Allied} and suddenly in 1993 they say we
think we have found a way around the patents," says a U.S.
diplomatic source.</p>
<p>Sources familiar with the governments' talks say that
solid commitments by one or more major Japanese utilities to
buy from Allied could provide a solution. But if one isn't
found, Allied wants the U.S. to slap a retaliatory tariff on
Japanese steel imports to the U.S. and exclude Japanese
amorphous metals indefinitely.</p>
