	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- More forecasts of a slowdown in the technology
sector fueled declines in high-tech stocks, bringing the
over-the-counter market lower.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.24 to 379.49, a 0.6%
loss, as trading remained light in the absence of any major
Mideast developments. Volume rose slightly to 100.1 million
shares from 98.3 million Monday. Declining stocks overtook
advancing shares, 989 to 754; 143 stocks fell to new lows
while only 14 rose to new highs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gloomy economic news continues to keep investors leery of
the market, said William A. Rothe, head of OTC trading at
Alex. Brown & Sons. As fears of inflation, recession and
flare-ups in the Middle East haunt investors, its appears the
market will go even lower before it recovers, said Peter Da
Puzzo, co-head of world-wide equities at Shearson Lehman
Brothers.</p>
<p>Four factors have helped slow the growth in demand for
technology products, according to Lawrence Bowman, portfolio
manager of the $62.5 million Fidelity Select Technology Fund.
Those factors are the traditional summer doldrums in the
industry, larger problems in the economy, the maturation of
some computer-related product cycles and slowing demand in
Europe, Mr. Bowman said in an interview. He added that the
slower growth is "incremental" and not extreme.</p>
<p>"You can do well with companies with robust product
cycles, but you have to be choosy," Mr. Bowman said.
Companies that make low-cost computer clones such as Dell
Computer and AST Research look attractive, he said.</p>
<p>Software makers are a "mixed bag" depending on how long
their products have been on the market, he added. Microsoft,
with the strong demand for its Windows 3.0 software, still
looks attractive, he said. He also is optimistic about the
outlook for workstation maker Sun Microsystems; minicomputer
systems maker Pyramid Technologies; semiconductor equipment
maker Novellus Systems; disk-drive maker Quantum and network
systems maker Novell.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a gloomy forecast by exchange-listed Tandem
Computers and price cuts by exchange-listed Compaq Computer
spilled into the OTC market as investors pared their holdings
in other technology shares.</p>
<p>Sun Microsystems lost 7/8 to 28 3/4; Apple Computer slid 1
3/4 to 34; Microsoft eased 1/4 to 55 1/2; Conner Peripherals
fell 1 to 22 1/2; Applied Materials lost 2 1/4 to 27; and
Intel dropped 1/2 to 32.</p>
<p>Lotus Development tumbled 1 1/2 to 16 1/2. Shares of the
Cambridge, Mass., software maker dropped after its chief
financial officer, Robert Schechter, told money managers at a
San Francisco conference that Lotus was "pulling back" from
its goal of annual 25% revenue growth and of sustaining 25%
return on equity and pretax profit margins. Later in the day,
Lotus Chairman and President Jim P. Manzi said the company
isn't scaling back its growth targets as sharply as the money
managers at the conference perceived. He said the company's
revenue growth target is "20% to 25%."</p>
<p>Ingres soared 3 5/8 to 9 and was the day's most active
stock after ASK Computer Systems said it plans to pay $9.25 a
share in cash for the Alameda, Calif., maker of database
management software products.</p>
<p>In turn, Hewlett-Packard and EDS Corp. agreed to buy a $60
million stake in ASK, giving EDS 19.7% of ASK's shares
outstanding and Hewlett-Packard a 10% stake in the Mountain
View, Calif., computer systems company. ASK closed unchanged
at 8. More than three million Ingres shares changed hands, 75
times average daily volume.</p>
<p>Spear Financial Services jumped onto the most active list
after the Los Angeles company's largest shareholder, Liberty
Mutual Insurance of Boston, sold its nearly 15.9% stake, or
1,086,221 shares, to Spear at 3 1/8. The stock rose 3/8 to 3
1/8 on 1.1 million shares.</p>
<p>In other buy-out news, Sizzler Restaurants eased 1/4 to 16
1/2 after trading as high as 19. Collins Food International,
which owns 66% of the operator of steak restaurants, said it
will acquire the remaining shares its doesn't own in an
exchange offer.</p>
<p>Hogan Systems traded as high as 3 1/2 but closed unchanged
at 3 1/8, after the Dallas maker of software for banking
systems said International Business Machines Co. bought a 5%
stake in the company. The two companies also renewed their
marketing agreements.</p>
<p>The continuing Mideast crisis helped cause a casualty in
the OTC market. Valmont Industries, which halted sales of its
irrigation systems to Iraq, tumbled 1 3/4 to 13 1/4 after the
Valley, Neb., company said earnings for the 1990 third
quarter and full year will be lower than expected and below
1989 earnings of $1.78 a share.</p>
<p>Valmont, which also makes components for the electrical
construction industry, attributed the lower expectations
largely to slower business in the U.S., as well as the loss
of its sales to Iraq. Valmont's sales to Iraq comprised about
1.5% to 2% of its total sales in 1989, according to Vice
President Brian Stanley.</p>
<p>Burritt InterFinancial Bancorp skidded 1 1/4 to 3 1/2
after the New Britain, Conn., financial institution said it
expects a "significant decline" in third- and fourth-quarter
earnings. Burritt said it expects to report nonperforming
loans amounted to between 5% and 6% of assets at the end of
the third quarter. Monday, the stock slipped 1/2.</p>
<p>Calgon Carbon fell 2 1/4 to 34 3/4 after Merrill Lynch
analyst William Genco lowered earnings estimates for the
Pittsburgh marketer of activated carbon, a company
spokeswoman told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Mr.
Genco's estimates had been the high end of analysts'
estimates, DJPIR said.</p>
