	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House approved a measure to improve the
professional standards of the huge Pentagon work force
responsible for buying and developing more than $100 billion
in defense equipment every year.
   The provision would create a career-oriented "acquisition
corps" in each of the service branches and establish higher
standards in education and experience for the managers of
major weapons programs. No Pentagon aide can step into that
kind of job, for instance, unless he or she has first
attended a Pentagon management-training course and has had
eight years of experience in defense acquisition, according
to the proposed rules.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The measure, which was tacked on as an amendment to the
House defense authorization bill for fiscal 1991, passed by a
413-1 vote.</p>
<p>Rep. Nicholas Mavroules (D., Mass.), the principal sponsor
of the amendment, said it would affect as many as 240,000
Pentagon civilians and uniformed personnel engaged in various
aspects of defense procurement.</p>
<p>The Mavroules proposal would convert the Pentagon's system
of revolving officers in and out of procurement jobs with one
that more closely resembles Britain's "procurement executive"
or France's delegate general for armaments. The amendment
also directs the Pentagon to create a Defense Acquisition
University to further the training of these corps.</p>
<p>The House approved by voice vote an amendment that would
help the Pentagon and other federal agencies attract and
retain qualified professionals. The amendment, proposed by
Rep. Benjamin Gilman (R., N.Y.), would allow these agencies
to reimburse employees in critical jobs for the cost of
earning academic degrees and repay their student loans in
exchange for a commitment to do government work for a
specific period of time.</p>
<p>The House also voted 230-188 to block a move by New York
Democrats to designate Staten Island's Navy base for
immediate closure.</p>
