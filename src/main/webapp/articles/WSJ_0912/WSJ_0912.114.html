	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- M.A. Hanna Co. said it plans to sell its Day
International printing products and textile products units
and that its board authorized the repurchase of as many as
2.8 million common shares, or about 10% of its 27.9 million
shares outstanding.
   The specialty chemicals concern said it wants to focus on
its core businesses. Of the stock buy-back, it said its
common is "greatly undervalued and represents one of the best
investments we can make for our shareholders." It said the
buy-back won't jeopardize its ability to fund growth plans,
for which it said it has strong cash flow and solid balance
sheet.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stock repurchases may be made in the open market or in
privately negotiated transactions, the company said.</p>
<p>Hanna said it retained the investment banking firm of
Salomon Brothers Inc., New York, to help with the divestiture
of its Day International Printing Products Co. and Day
International Textile Products businesses. The printing
products unit makes polymer printing blankets and other
products used in the offset printing industry. It is based in
Dayton, Ohio, and has annual sales of about $100 million.
Sales of the Greenville, S.C., textile unit weren't
disclosed.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Hanna closed at $17.75 a share, up 12.5 cents.</p>
