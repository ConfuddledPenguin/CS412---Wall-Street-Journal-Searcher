	<p class="article-leader">Brace yourself for more crowded skies when you fly.
   Crowded with a greater barrage of television commercials,
that is. Long in its infancy, in-flight advertising is
finally taking off -- whether captive passengers like it or
not.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japan Air Lines recently introduced in-flight ads on its
screens for the first time, and Delta Air Lines soon may
follow suit. TWA is putting sponsored newscasts on additional
flights, while British Airways is permitting six minutes of
commercials per hour on its entertainment programs -- twice
as many as five years ago. Advertisers now spend roughly $15
million a year on in-flight TV ads, 50% more than in 1987,
industry executives estimate.</p>
<p>An even bigger boom lies ahead. A number of airlines are
inaugurating in-seat personal video devices this fall. The
tiny TV monitors, in seat backs or armrests, will give
passengers a mix of movies, sports and business programs,
instructional tapes, comedies and music videos. Some systems
under development even feature video games, mail-order
catalogues, duty-free shopping and electronic poker.</p>
<p>The individual screens also will come with a plethora of
advertising messages (except during first-run films), as
cash-strapped carriers scramble to pay for systems that can
cost $1 million per aircraft. First-class and business-class
passengers on JAL's New York-to-Tokyo run began watching
in-seat television last month, along with commercials that
included spots for Martell cognac. American Airlines will
install individual screens for first-class travelers starting
later this month. The carrier already has lined up sponsors
for several of its 15 different videotaped programs.</p>
<p>Airvision, a U.S. unit of Dutch electronics giant Phillips
N.V., yesterday announced that Mexicana Airlines will install
Airvision's six-channel TV sets for all passengers starting
Dec. 15. Similar personal-video systems are planned by next
spring at KLM, British Airways and Northwest Airlines. "All
the main airlines will be flying something {like this} in
first class" within two to three years, says Mark Horton,
British Airways' media services manager.</p>
<p>"If you think we have a lot of advertising now" on
airlines' wide movie screens, "just wait until the individual
video systems come on," predicts Robert Anderson, TWA's
in-flight marketing manger, who is trying to choose a
personal-TV system for TWA. "We will have a lot more," he
says. "There will be a lot more opportunities for advertisers
because there will be a lot more {program} choices."</p>
<p>But how captive is a passenger who can switch video
channels or choose from dozens of videotapes rather than
being restricted to one giant overhead screen? The solution
may be for an advertiser to become a videotape's exclusive
sponsor or run identical spots simultaneously on every
channel. "I think we will ruin" demand from advertisers for
in-flight commercials "unless we offer ad coverage in all the
channels" at once, warns Ken Epstein, sales director for
Flight Level Video Inc., a New York firm that handles
in-flight programs and ads for Pan American World Airways and
TWA.</p>
<p>Seat-back TV eventually should attract advertising from
the same sort of businesses now wooing affluent air travelers
through in-flight commercials on big screens. Among the
heaviest current users are long-distance phone carriers like
American Telephone & Telegraph, financial-service companies
like American Express, and hotel chains and makers of cars,
computers, luggage and cameras.</p>
<p>Few advertisers are rushing to book air time on the new
flying TV sets, however. "It's another opportunity to use the
television screen on board the aircraft," says Ian
Stanborough, managing director of Optimedia International.
Optimedia, Publicis -- FCB's specialist international media
company in Europe, is the ad agency for Ballantine's scotch,
exclusive sponsor of video news broadcasts on long-distance
British Airways flights. "But whether we make it work and do
what we want it to do has yet to be decided," Mr. Stanborough
notes.</p>
<p>Another question mark: Will passengers rebel against a
higher bombardment of TV commercials during their flights --
the way they have booed and hissed ones shown in movie
theaters?</p>
<p>"I don't like advertisements on TV. Why would I want more
of them on the airplane?" asks Kevin Leo, a 26-year-old
computer programmer, as he waits by a Northwest reservation
desk in the lobby of New York's World Trade Center.</p>
<p>To avoid a backlash, the airline industry is promoting
evidence that the flying public doesn't mind in-flight
commercials. That's one finding from a survey of 4,215
passsengers being released today at the World Airline
Entertainment Association's annual convention in Scottsdale,
Ariz. Of those polled by the trade group, 47% felt the amount
of TV advertising during flights was "about right" while 27%
"didn't notice" and 15% said it was "too much."</p>
<p>Some carriers also are setting strict limits on how many
TV commercials they will allow. For Japan Air Lines, it's a
mere 220 seconds per flight. And American Airlines may impose
ad restrictions on its new personal-video system. "We are
very sensitive to commercialization on the airplane," says
Kathy Libonati, American's managing director of product
design. "We don't want the traveling public to think they are
a captive audience."</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>A&P CAMPAIGN: A new TV campaign for Great Atlantic &
Pacific Tea, with the tag line "Look At Us Now," starts this
week in the New York metropolitan area and will soon move to
other markets. The ads, which replace A&P's "Building a Proud
New Feeling" campaign, are the first created by Bozell, which
won the $20 million A&P account in February. A&P is a unit of
Tengelmann Warenhandels Gesellschaft.</p>
<p>NETWORK TV ADS: The Network Television Association, an
umbrella group formed in April by NBC, CBS and ABC to promote
network TV, next week will launch in newspapers and trade
magazines a campaign targeting national marketers.</p>
<p>TBWA Advertising, New York, produced the ads, which carry
the theme "Network TV: It Touches Everyone."</p>
<p>PERSIAN GULF: A trade ad for Pelorus Film Co., a New York
commercial and film production firm, shows a map of the
Middle East with the tagline, "We believe there's one place
in the world where there should be no shooting." The ad,
which will run in advertising trade journals, was created by
Omon's New York office.</p>
