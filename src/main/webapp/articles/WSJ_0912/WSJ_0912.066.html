	<p class="article-leader">We persist in believing that the folks in Washington who
are turning themselves into pretzels to raise taxes are truly
out of touch with the public mood around the country. We
recently encountered an intriguing piece of evidence to
support this view. New Jersey's electorate is in an uproar
over the new taxes proposed by Gov. Jim Florio, who used to
be one of Congress's most ardent liberals and spenders.
Earlier this week, the Philadelphia Inquirer dropped into New
Jersey to visit Mr. Florio's old political stomping grounds,
a district that gave him 82% of its vote in 1986. Something's
changed. Reflecting sentiment in the state, Robert E.
Andrews, a Democrat running for Mr. Florio's old seat, has
pledged that he will vote against any federal tax increase in
Congress. He's offered a plan to cut the federal deficit
without raising taxes, suggesting reforms in welfare and
health programs. Whether in New Jersey or the country
generally, people got used to the idea of working hard to
achieve private economic growth in the '80s. They didn't
think they were working so that government could grow larger
and engorge itself on their incomes. Washington still doesn't
understand that.</p>
