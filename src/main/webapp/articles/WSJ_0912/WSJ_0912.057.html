	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks retreated Tuesday on profit-taking from
Monday's gains and softer sentiments linked to bond market
weakness, traders said.
   London shares fell after an earlier rally failed to hold
and Wall Street pushed London lower.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues dropped 476.24 points,
or 1.9%, to 24604.66. The index soared 1118.83 points Monday.</p>
<p>In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index recaptured 87.92
points to close the morning session at 24692.58.</p>
<p>Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 400
million shares, up from 336.6 million shares Monday. Losers
outnumbered winners 609 to 322, while 137 issues were
unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the first
section dropped 22.58 points, or 1.19%, to 1880.70.</p>
<p>The second section index fell 8.84 points, or 0.24%, to
3603.40. Volume was estimated at six million shares, up from
4.8 million shares Monday.</p>
<p>A technical downward correction was seen as a natural
follow-up to Monday's advance. The Nikkei dropped about 250
points on profit-taking at the morning opening.</p>
<p>Stocks also followed the weaker bond market, traders said.</p>
<p>Bearishness stemming from a higher interest rate
environment kept investors from buying into the market,
traders said. Some speculative issues were the only targets
of buying, which came in small-lot spurts and was mostly by
dealers.</p>
<p>The Japanese government bond market was weaker partly on
unfounded rumors lingering from Monday that Iraqi troops were
headed toward Jordan, but also because of the continued rise
in money market rates, traders said.</p>
<p>The overnight unsecured call money rate was up 1/32 on the
day at 7 26/32% before settling at 7 22/32%. The yield on
December Euroyen interest rate futures closed at 8.75%, up
from 8.69% Monday.</p>
<p>In response, the yield on the benchmark, the No. 119, 4.8%
coupon due 1999 was at 8.345%, up 8.5 basis points, at the
close of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. A basis point
is 1/100th of a percentage point.</p>
<p>With short-term and long-term interest rates looking to
remain at high levels, funds will continue to be pulled from
stocks, traders said.</p>
<p>In addition to interest-rate concerns, the market is seen
as remaining unsteady for the remainder of the month. Trading
ahead of Thursday, which is the expiration day for September
futures and options contracts, will likely reflect
manipulation by futures traders in preparation for the
special price fixing Friday.</p>
<p>Moreover, institutions have little time left before fiscal
book-closings at the end of the month; window-dressing is
expected to heighten volatility.</p>
<p>Investors must also deal this month with margin calls for
purchases made six months ago.</p>
<p>On a day-to-day basis, therefore, only short-term plays,
particularly speculative or incentive-backed shares, are
being targeted.</p>
<p>Minebea rose 100 yen to 1080 yen (72 cents to $7.75).
Kurabo jumped 70 yen to 1870 yen.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical shares were largely higher, with Ono
Pharmaceutical up 100 yen to 4500 yen and Mochida up 70 yen
to 3100 yen.</p>
<p>Higher-quality issues were sold off for profits derived
from gains Monday.</p>
<p>Sony fell 140 yen to 7040 yen, Hitachi fell 30 yen to 1280
yen, and Kyocera dropped 230 yen to 7120 yen.</p>
<p>Nippon Light Metal slipped 30 yen to 1260 yen.</p>
<p>Construction shares, which benefited Monday from the
market's jump, fell sharply. Nippon Hodo fell 110 yen to 2680
yen, Maeda Construction dropped 50 yen to 1570 yen, and
Kajima fell 40 yen to 1360 yen.</p>
<p>London's fall reflected the lower U.S. market. Traders
said the American market was knocked down by a Government
Accounting Office report that several U.S. banks were likely
to fail in the next year.</p>
<p>Volume picked up as a result of overnight positioning and
two-way business generated from program trading. However the
market was still "hopelessly dull" according to one trader,
and stifled by uncertainty over the Middle East and the U.S.
economy.</p>
<p>Speculation ahead of U.K. companies' midyear results was
generating some business, traders said, as institutions
bought stock on expectations of dividend gains.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index was
down 2.7 points at 2144.3. The Financial Times 30 Share Index
fell 4.1 points to 1651. Volume was 338.8 million shares, up
from Monday's 296.4 million shares.</p>
<p>Fisons PLC, a pharmaceutical and horticultural products
concern, recorded a 35% gain in pretax profit following
first-time contributions from V.G. Instruments, a scientific
equipment maker. The shares gained 3 pence to 350 pence (5.6
cents to $6.48).</p>
<p>Paper, filters and plastics concern Bunzl PLC reported a
26% fall in pretax profit resulting from declining sales of
manufactured goods in key overseas markets. Bunzl climbed 9
pence to 69 pence despite the midyear results.</p>
<p>Peninsular & Oriental Steam Co. recorded a 22% fall in
pretax profit as residential and commercial property
development interests depressed earnings. Traders said that
the 8% rise in the midyear dividend payment helped the share
price rise 9 pence to 504 pence.</p>
<p>Positive expectations for Rolls-Royce's midyear results
due Thursday boosted the stock 5 pence to 193 pence.</p>
<p>Enterprise Oil dropped 13 pence to 669 pence on market
rumors that Elf Acquitaine might try to place a stake in the
company again. British Petroleum climbed 2 pence to 369 pence
and Shell was unchanged at 495 pence.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, shares closed higher in Milan, lower in Paris,
Madrid, Frankfurt and Stockholm and mixed in Zurich and
Amsterdam. South African gold stocks closed lower.</p>
<p>Also, stocks ended lower in Taipei, Manila, Singapore and
Wellington, mixed in Hong Kong and Seoul, and little changed
in Sydney.</p>
