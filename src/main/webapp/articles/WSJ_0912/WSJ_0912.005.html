	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian housing starts declined 7% in August to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 163,000 units, from a
July level of 175,000 units, Canadian Mortgage & Housing
Corp., a government agency, said.
   The corporation attributed the August decline to high
mortgage rates and a sharp deterioration in consumer
confidence. It expects housing starts to decline further in
coming months.</p>
