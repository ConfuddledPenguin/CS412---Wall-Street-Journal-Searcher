	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Security Pacific Hoare Govett Group Ltd.
announced plans for its management and employees to buy 51%
of the British securities concern, as part of a
reorganization that would split the company in two.
   Under the plan, Hoare Govett would divide into a company
focusing on United Kingdom and continental European markets,
and another concentrating on Southeast Asia. Los
Angeles-based Security Pacific Corp., which owns 100% of
Hoare Govett, would retain a 49% stake in each of the new
firms. The transaction is expected to be completed early next
year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Security Pacific took control of Hoare Govett in early
1986, when banks were snapping up British brokerage houses
before the deregulation of London's financial markets.</p>
<p>The employee purchase would allow Hoare Govett to regain
its independence, yet retain links to "financially strong"
Security Pacific, said Peter S. Voss, Hoare Govett's chairman
and chief executive officer. "The local management and
employee teams, with their equity incentive, will enable us
to increase our market position" in Europe and southeast
Asia, he added.</p>
<p>The European unit is to be capitalized at about #70
million (US$130 million) and the southeast Asia operation at
$45 million to $50 million, Mr. Voss said in an interview
yesterday. Equity in the concerns would total about #10
million and $10 million respectively.</p>
<p>Both companies intend to continue concentrating on
research, institutional sales, market making and corporate
finance and advisory work.</p>
<p>Peter R. Meinertzhagen, currently Hoare Govett's head of
corporate finance, will become chairman of the European unit.
Mr. Voss will be the unit's chief executive. Tony Lowrie and
Tim Kilpatrick, who now are respectively chairman and
managing director of Hoare Govett International, will lead
the southeast Asian unit. Their precise job titles haven't
yet been determined.</p>
<p>In a statement, David Lovejoy, vice chairman of Security
Pacific, said Hoare Govett would "play a crucial role" in the
U.S. bank's "alliance of securities firms."</p>
