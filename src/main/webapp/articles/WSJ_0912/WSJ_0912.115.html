	<p class="article-leader">BUSH DECLARED "Saddam Hussein will fail" in his occupation
of Kuwait.
   In a televised address to Congress, the president also
said a "new world order" will emerge from the Mideast crisis.
He used some of his bluntest language yet to express the U.S.
stance. Separately, members of the Senate Armed Services
panel criticized Bonn and Tokyo for failing to pay more for
Gulf military operations, and Defense Secretary Cheney said
those contributions may "well be inadequate." Washington said
Iraq announced it would permit American males born in Arab
countries to leave. Citing deteriorating conditions, five
nations said they were pulling their diplomats out of Kuwait.</p>

energy production, but many of his likely proposals will face
a hard sell in Congress.</p>

<p>GORBACHEV BACKED a sweeping plan to create a Soviet market
economy.</p>
<p>The president's statement of support to the Soviet
Parliament, in which he backed radical proposals calling for
a market economy within 18 months, came despite warnings from
Premier Ryzhkov that this would lead to a decline in living
standards. Gorbachev's remarks seemed to ensure that plans
drafted by economist Shatalin have won out over Ryzhkov's
more cautious package. The Russian republic's Parliament
later overwhelmingly endorsed the so-called Shatalin
proposals, and called upon the other republics to follow
suit.</p>
<p>Ryzhkov, who appeared stunned by Gorbachev's remarks,
hinted that he would resign rather than preside over
implementation of the Shatalin plan.</p>

<p>The U.S. and Soviets may drop provisions limiting troops
in Europe, a senior U.S. official said in Moscow, in an
effort to conclude a conventional forces treaty by year's
end. The official, traveling with Baker, said a prospective
ban on non-nuclear aircraft also may be dropped. A 35-nation
summit to sign the treaty is planned for November.</p>

<p>Mandela accused the South African government of waging war
against his African National Congress and said failure to
halt black factional fighting threatened talks on ending
apartheid. The ANC leader met with President de Klerk as
police said nearly 700 people have died in a month of
violence in townships around Johannesburg.</p>

<p>Heavy fighting was reported in Monrovia as rebels hunted
troops loyal to Liberia's Doe -- reportedly slain in a
surprise attack Sunday -- while government forces bombarded
the insurgents from atop the president's mansion in Monrovia.
Doe's supporters asked an African peacekeeping force in
Liberia to help them leave the capital.</p>

<p>Vietnam hailed an agreement among Cambodia's warring
factions, and said it will try to assist international
efforts toward a peace settlement. Separately, Khmer Rouge
guerrillas were told in a radio broadcast by their leaders
that they must carry on their fighting in Cambodia despite
the accord signed Monday in Indonesia.</p>

<p>South Korea was lashed by its heaviest single-day rainfall
in 70 years, leaving at least 30 people dead and more than
25,000 homeless. In Seoul, which was hit by 15 inches of rain
in 24 hours, soldiers used rubber dinghies to rescue people
from low-lying areas around Olympic Park. Property damage was
initially estimated at $15 million.</p>

<p>Three teen-agers received maximum sentences of five to 10
years in prison for the rape and assault of a woman jogger in
New York's Central Park. The youths, tried as adults but
sentenced as juveniles, were convicted last month in the
April 1989 attack but were acquitted of attempted murder.
Three other defendants are awaiting trial.</p>

<p>A Peruvian Boeing 727 jet crashed in the sea 180 miles
southeast of Newfoundland, and officials said 18 people were
believed to have been on board. The plane, en route from
Malta to Miami, had sent out a distress call saying it was
low on fuel.</p>

<p>The EPA proposed tighter standards on carbon monoxide
emissions from cars and light trucks, with the goal of
cutting per-vehicle emissions 29% a year. The regulations,
which would be phased in for new models between 1993 and
1995, are estimated to add $19 to $31 to the average price of
a new vehicle.</p>

<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee is slated to begin
confirmation hearings tomorrow for Bush's Supreme Court
nominee Souter amid little organized opposition. Committee
Chairman Biden, a Delaware Democrat, said he thought that
Souter should be asked questions on abortion and other
constitutional issues.</p>
