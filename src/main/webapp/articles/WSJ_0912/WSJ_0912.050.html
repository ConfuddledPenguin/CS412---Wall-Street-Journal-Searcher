	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The administration stepped up its attack on
proposed textile legislation that is expected to pass the
House next week.
   The bill, which would apply quotas to additional items and
make existing protections permanent, could torpedo current
trade negotiations and cost the U.S. as much as $30 billion
in trade retaliation, a senior official said here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Seattle, meanwhile, U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills told a Council for International Trade meeting, "This
bill would cause tremendous economic harm." She said the
proposed legislation also could "severely jeopardize our
chances of success in the Uruguay Round," the current talks
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the world's
trade treaty organization.</p>
<p>One major reason the administration is accelerating its
campaign against the legislation is that, in the view of many
officials, the textile industry may already have enough
support in Congress to override a presidential veto if the
bill is passed.</p>
<p>The industry says it needs the protection from foreign
competition. But the administration estimates that U.S.
textile exports grew 27% in 1989, capacity utilization at
U.S. mills is high, and unemployment in textile-producing
states is generally below the national average.</p>
