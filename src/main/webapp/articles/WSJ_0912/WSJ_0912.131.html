	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on most certificates of deposit at
major banks and brokerage firms declined in the week ended
yesterday.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold directly by
banks (also called "consumer" CDs) were down slightly,
according to Banxquote Money Markets, an information service.
The average yield on a six-month consumer CD, for instance,
eased to 7.38% from 7.42%, Banxquote said. On a five-year
consumer CD, the average yield eased to 7.90% from 7.91%,
according to the survey of 18 banks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Average yields on CDs sold by leading broker-dealers fell
more. The greatest decline was for a six-month broker-sold
CD, which fell to an average of 7.75% from 7.92%, Banxquote
said. The average yield for a two-year broker-sold CD fell to
8.13% from 8.22%.</p>
<p>Average yields for large-denomination CDs at major banks,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were
flat to down slightly. The average yield on a one-year jumbo
CD remained at 7.72%, while the average for a five-year
maturity eased to 8.25% from 8.27%.</p>
