	<p class="article-leader">On July 27, Potomac Watch columnist Paul A. Gigot, in what
he considered to be a "delicious anecdote," informed us of
"panic in the ranks of People for the American Way, the group
that paid Gregory Peck to smear Judge Bork."
   According to Mr. Gigot, the group had done its homework in
anticipation of the nomination of Judge Edith Jones of Texas,
but were unprepared for Judge David Souter. That is not much
of a delicious anecdote. It is pretty thin stuff, with a
careless statement thrown in: It is not true that I was paid
to speak the narration on the anti-Bork TV spot.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A little research by Mr. Gigot before he sideswiped me
would have disclosed that I have been speaking my piece for
racial and religious tolerance, for equal justice for
minority citizens for more than 40 years, on and off the
screen.</p>
<p>Judge Bork opposed affirmative action. He expressed little
understanding of the deprived and underprivileged, no concern
for the hopelessness of their plight, the bleakness of their
lives. The superior intellect did not appear to be leavened
with human compassion.</p>
<p>Did I smear Judge Bork? No. The TV spot was hardball
advocacy, to be sure. People for the American Way didn't
defeat him. Nor did the Senate Judiciary Committee. He
defeated himself.</p>
<p>I expect that Judge Souter, on those hikes in the
mountains of New Hampshire, will have reminded himself that
while most Americans respect and admire intellectual
achievement, what they trust in a man is common sense, and a
touch of humility.</p>
