	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Drivers with Fuzzbusters can't be busted
by their insurance companies, according to an order by
California's insurance commissioner.
   The commissioner, Roxani M. Gillespie, yesterday ordered
Government Employees Insurance Co., or Geico, to stop
refusing to insure radar-detector owners in the state, saying
the practice violates California's insurance law. The
Washington, D.C., company had requested a hearing after a
motorist lodged a complaint last year charging that Geico
wouldn't renew his insurance after he confessed in a
questionnaire that he packed a radar detector in one of his
three cars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ms. Gillespie found in her decision that Geico had
presented, "No credible evidence . . . that radar detector
users as a class are high-speed drivers or that as a class
they tend to drive in a manner which endangers the safety of
themselves or others."</p>
<p>Geico won't appeal the decision immediately, but will
collect better data and "will eventually prevail" in proving
the connection between radar detectors and accidents, said
Tony Nicely, the company's president. Insurance departments
in Maryland and five other states require insurance companies
to sell policies to radar-detector owners, Mr. Nicely said,
but Geico refuses insurance to such owners in 42 other states
because "we know of no other plausible use of a radar
detector than to exceed speed laws."</p>
