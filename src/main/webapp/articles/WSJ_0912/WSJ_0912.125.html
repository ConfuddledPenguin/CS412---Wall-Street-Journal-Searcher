	<p class="article-leader">At a workshop for American University lab assistants
recently, a hot topic was Saddam Hussein: What motivates the
Arab leader, and why doesn't he view negotiations the way
George Bush does?
   But the topic wasn't foreign relations; it was employee
relations. Saddam Hussein and Mr. Bush were being studied for
insights into conflicts among about 80 university lab
technicians, one-third of whom are foreign-born and many of
whom are Arab-American. Some of the same cultural issues
complicating the Mideast crisis have cropped up inside the
lab.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The workshop was one of hundreds around the U.S. that
focus on cultural differences affecting recent immigrants, as
well as blacks, women and people whose U.S. roots may stretch
back as far as the Mayflower.</p>
<p>White male corporate culture is disappearing, and the
workplace is becoming less a melting pot than a mosaic. The
white male share of the labor force will drop to 39.4% by the
year 2000 from 48.9% in 1976, according to the U.S. Labor
Department, while the share of women and people of African,
Hispanic, Asian and Native American origin will rise. Even
now, because the work force is growing more slowly, employees
of different cultures are in a position to demand more
flexibility from management.</p>
<p>In the past, conformity was the rule -- right down to
shirt color. Even now, the average manager may think: "To be
fair, I should assume everyone is the same and treat them
that way."</p>
<p>But experts on diversity disagree. At the American
University lab, says Gary Weaver, the professor of
intercultural communications who conducted the workshop,
small disagreements have escalated into "real conflict, where
someone was going to get fired." A major reason, he says, is
cultural differences. When a manager from the dominant U.S.
culture saw two Arab-American employees arguing, he figured
he had better stay out of it. But the employees expected a
third party intermediary, or "wasta" in Arabic, and without
one the incident blew up.</p>
<p>The expectation goes back to the Koran and Bedouin
tradition, says Prof. Weaver. While the dominant American
culture is likely to take an individualistic, win-lose
approach and emphasize privacy, Arab-Americans tend to value
a win-win result that preserves group harmony but often
requires mediation. The hope in cross-cultural communication,
he adds, is not to decide "who's rational and who's
irrational" but to understand both perspectives and become
comfortable with them.</p>
<p>Cultural misunderstandings, usually far from overt, happen
every day. Consider these scenarios, offered by human
resource consultants:</p>
<p>-- A female vice president says to a male vice president,
"Do you think we should invite X to this meeting?" The woman
really means, "I think we should invite X," but her colleague
thinks he has been asked a question. Many women have learned
to speak in tentative or questioning tones to avoid appearing
too aggressive.</p>
<p>-- A Latino manager starts a budget-planning meeting by
chatting casually and checking with his new staff on whether
everyone can get together after work. His boss frets over the
delay and wonders why he doesn't get straight to the numbers.
Latino culture teaches that building relationships is often
critical to working together, while the dominant American
culture encourages "getting down to business."</p>
<p>Ignoring such differences can hurt people and
productivity. Managers who don't understand what's motivating
a colleague or employee may provoke resistance or anger, says
Toby Thompkins, a consultant at Harbridge House Inc., a
Chicago-based human resources concern.</p>
<p>But before people can change their approach, say
consultants, they have to reject a basic but wrongheaded
idea. Most assume that "their human nature is everyone's
human nature, and you're OK if you just get down to the
human," says Barbara Deane, editor of Training and Culture
Newsletter in Seattle.</p>
<p>Because negative stereotyping is so damaging, adds Lewis
Griggs, a San Francisco-based producer of films on diversity,
"we are taught" that we should ignore differences, or at best
consider them irrelevant. But "real and relevant" differences
exist, he argues, reflecting genuine cultural habits and
values.</p>
<p>Consultants coach managers and employees to look for and
talk about these differences, largely by presenting scenarios
drawn from real life. For the most part, they aren't blatant
cases of discrimination but the details of day-to-day life.</p>
<p>One territory that's ripe for misunderstanding is body
language. Rules for eye contact, for example, differ among
cultures.</p>
<p>"Say I'm interviewing an Asian woman, anywhere from first
generation to third generation," says Mr. Griggs. Deferring
to authority, she may keep her eyes down, rarely meeting his.
But this goes against everything traditionally taught to
American managers about interviewing. "Here I am," says Mr.
Griggs, "thinking, `She's not assertive, not strong enough,
maybe she's hiding something, or insecure.'" Meanwhile, he
adds, "she sees my persistent eye contact as domineering,
invasive, controlling. We don't trust each other."</p>
<p>"First," Mr. Griggs says, "I have to understand that my
penetrating eye contact isn't God's gift, or the `right' way,
it's just Anglo male Midwestern {habit}." Then, he says, "I
can stay in neutral, be a little less judgmental" and meet
the other person half way.</p>
<p>One danger in such discussions is that dissecting
differences may lead some people to adopt new stereotypes.
The fear was demonstrated at a manufacturing plant in Dallas,
when Bob Abramms, a consultant with ODT Inc. in Amherst,
Mass., showed one of Mr. Griggs's films.</p>
<p>In one scene, portrayed by actors, a Native American woman
is binding together wires in an electronics plant. The boss
sees that she has come up with a better way to do the work,
and, over her protests, makes a big fuss. "Hey, everybody,
this is the kind of work I want to see]" he shouts to the
other workers on the floor.</p>
<p>The boss, of course, thinks he was doing the woman a
favor. The dominant American culture sees public praise as
the best reward for a job well done. But in some cultures,
where the emphasis is on group harmony and cohesion, singling
someone out appears to threaten the group and causes the
individual to suffer a loss of face.</p>
<p>In the next scene, the boss has learned his lesson. He
offers the employee a letter of praise for her personnel
file.</p>
<p>But the film's conclusion got an angry reaction from one
viewer in the plant, another Native American. "She said, `I
don't know what tribe that woman is from, maybe Navaho, but
I'm Cherokee and I want public praise as much as the next
person,'" recounts Mr. Abramms.</p>
<p>"No matter how much we learn about cultures," he adds, "we
have to be aware of differences" within a culture "and of
personal idiosyncrasies and preferences." It may turn out
that the person who wants private recognition is a blond
California woman who just happens to be shy. "The bottom
line," says Mr. Abramms, "is: Ask."</p>
<p>In addition to discussing cultural differences,
consultants also bring up the reverse scenario: when someone
from a minority group displays behavior common to many
cultures but is scrutinized more closely than others would
be.</p>
<p>"In a corporate setting, anything a person of color does
is exaggerated," says Mr. Thompkins of Harbridge House, who
is black. Especially at professional levels, he says,
"they're usually the only one in the room. So if I show up
late for a meeting once, it's noticed. If there are three
{white} guys from finance and one is late, it's not much of
an issue."</p>
<p>A white man may pound the table and be seen by others as
emphatic or exuberant, adds Carmen Colin, a consultant at
ODT. But if a black man raises his voice or gestures, she
says, "it's immediately seen as a threat" by non-black
colleagues.</p>
<p>Says a black manager at a cosmetics firm: "Do we face more
animosity if we are confrontational in a meeting? Yes." Once,
after a meeting where he vigorously argued his position, he
recalls that a white colleague told him casually, "I've never
met a black male who didn't have a chip on his shoulder."</p>
<p>Often, the hardest part of such training is getting people
into it to begin with. Many people are frightened, say
consultants, about bringing tensions to the surface in an
organization that seems to be functioning well.</p>
<p>Even when people acknowledge problems, they often see them
as someone else's affair. In preparation for a seminar on
diversity, Mr. Abramms recently mailed orientation packages
to about 200 executives of a large oil company.</p>
<p>Along with the date, location and other practical details,
each kit included a reprint of a Harvard Business Review
article called "Black Managers: The Dream Deferred,"
describing black corporate experiences. Dozens of the
company's white middle managers, without reading the article,
sent their copies to the one black manager in the group,
thinking, with some good will, says Mr. Abramms, "`Oh, this
will interest Tom.'" When the group met, he chided them.
"You're the ones that need to read it," he said. "Tom knows
what it's like."</p>
<p>People laughed sheepishly, he says. "You begin to see the
absurdity of it, and to realize that the best we'll ever be
is recovering sexists and recovering racists."</p>
