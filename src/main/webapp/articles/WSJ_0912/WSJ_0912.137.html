	<p class="article-leader">In your Aug. 20 article "At Columbia, Comeback Is the Big
Production," you erroneously identify Fred Astaire's partner
in a vintage movie poster from "You'll Never Get Rich"
(Columbia, 1940) as Ginger Rogers. In fact, Mr. Astaire's
co-star in "You'll Never Get Rich" was Rita Hayworth. Mr.
Astaire's classic musicals with Ginger Rogers in 1933-1939
were made at the RKO Radio Studios.
   "You'll Never Get Rich," however, is notable not only for
being one of only two movies Astaire and Hayworth made
together (the other, again for Columbia, was "You Were Never
Lovelier"), but also for the wonderful supporting performance
by Robert Benchley and the rare cameo appearance of the Delta
Rhythm Boys. It is also a fine example of an overlooked
minigenre: the Hollywood movies taking a lighthearted look at
military life that were made between the inception of the
peacetime draft in 1940 and the Pearl Harbor attack, which
abruptly sobered the nation's outlook.</p>
