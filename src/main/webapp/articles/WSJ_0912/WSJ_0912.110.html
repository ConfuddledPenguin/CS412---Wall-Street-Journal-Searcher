	<p class="article-leader">Compaq Computer Corp. reduced by up to 20% the suggested
retail prices for several of its desktop personal computers.
   The computer retailer, based in Houston, reduced the
suggested price of the Deskpro 386/25e Model 120 from $8,499
to $6,999, the 386s Model 1 from $2,799 to $2,499, and the
286n Model 40 from $2,599 to $2,399. Compaq also lowered
prices of more than a dozen other 386 models.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It said the reductions would allow it to take advantage of
fourth-quarter market growth and accelerated movement toward
386-based and 386sx-based personal computers.</p>
<p>Compaq's president, Joseph R. Canion, noted that Compaq
needed to keep its prices in line with its major competitor,
International Business Machines Corp.</p>
<p>Compaq was able to reduce prices because of price cuts in
such parts as microprocessors and disk drives.</p>
<p>The company also reduced by about 25% the price of nine
memory options for its computers.</p>
