	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Swiss Bank Corp. has agreed to guarantee
about $50 million of the $375 million in short-term bonds the
city of Philadelphia wants to sell to postpone its cash-flow
crisis.
   But without other banks backing a substantial portion of
the debt, the city will probably be forced to offer a premium
interest rate to investors if it prices the notes today as
scheduled, said City Controller Jonathan A. Saidel. "It could
be 9%," Mr. Saidel said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Worse, the city might not be able to sell the notes at
all, as was the case last month when the city first intended
to float the issue, originally for $450 million. With
Philadelphia facing a $206.4 million budget deficit for the
current fiscal year, investors were apparently concerned that
the city will not be able to repay the notes.</p>
<p>If Philadelphia cannot sell the notes, officials say, it
will be able to stretch out its operating cash to December --
at best. Even with the note sale, the city says it will run
out of cash a month or two before the fiscal year ends June
30.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman said that Mayor W. Wilson Goode and his
administration would not comment on the note sale, continuing
a pattern of reticence on the city's financial crisis.</p>
<p>But Mr. Saidel, the city's elected chief auditor, said
that so far Swiss Bank, based in Basel, Switzerland, is the
only bank willing to guarantee part of the notes. Officials
are also talking with the Union Bank of Switzerland and
National Westminster Bank of London, he said.</p>
<p>"The local banks all said no," Mr. Saidel said.
Philadelphia-based CoreStates Financial Corp. and
Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank Corp. declined to comment, but
Philadelphia-based Meridian Bancorp confirmed that it
declined to guarantee any of the notes.</p>
<p>"We cannot reconcile the associated risk with our
responsibility to shareholders," a Meridian spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch, lead underwriter of the offering, said that
the city would go ahead and sell the notes with or without
additional lines of credit. "The note sale is going to
proceed as planned," said William James, manager of municipal
trading operations at the brokerage firm. "The mix is part of
the marketing process."</p>
<p>Mayor Goode told residents last month that he would seek
$150 million in emergency tax increases to alleviate the
crisis, but state legislators are balking at granting
Philadelphia permission to do so. The mayor is also
considering selling such city assets as parking garages and a
sports stadium.</p>
<p>Mr. Saidel, an outspoken critic of the borrowing plan,
said he would prefer that city and state officials deal with
the problem now. "Eventually, they're going to wind up with
the same debt," he said. "I think they have to face their
responsibilities today." Although Mr. Saidel cannot block the
sale, his opposition may contribute to investor reluctance to
purchase the notes.</p>
<p>According to preliminary offering documents, the
short-term bonds will be divided into two classes: unsecured
notes and notes secured by a bank's letter of credit.</p>
