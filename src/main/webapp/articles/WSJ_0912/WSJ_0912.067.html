	<p class="article-leader">CALABASAS, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp. said a special
committee of the board met yesterday to consider redemption
of its poison pill plan, but what the panel will recommend to
the full board won't be decided for some time.
   Dallas financier Harold Simmons, who controls a 19.8%
stake in Lockheed through NL Industries Inc., has asked the
company to amend its poison pill provision, allowing him to
buy 10 million Lockheed shares now controlled by the trustee
of the company's employee stock-ownership plan. The poison
pill, which can be activated when an investor obtains 20% or
more of Lockheed's stock, is meant to dilute a hostile
suitor's position and make a takeover prohibitively
expensive.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep has said in the past he is
reluctant to rescind the pill because it would leave the
defense contractor vulnerable to "coercive and unfair
takeover tactics." A Lockheed spokesman said Mr. Simmons
would be notified of the status of the poison pill after the
full board has made up its mind. The next regularly scheduled
board meeting is set for Sept. 24.</p>
<p>In a letter dated Aug. 24, NL asked for an opportunity to
present its case to the special committee, as well as to
review any Lockheed-generated studies on the issue being
considered by the group.</p>
<p>However, both requests were turned down by Lockheed. In an
Aug. 31 letter, Mr. Tellep cited continuing litigation
between NL and Lockheed, saying that "some of the material
which will be presented to the committee is attorney-client
privileged information" and "as such, your request . . .
cannot be honored." He invited NL to submit in writing any
material it wished to provide, but the Lockheed spokesman
said that NL didn't act on that offer.</p>
<p>The chief executive officer of Houston-based NL, J. Landis
Martin, responded in another letter dated Sept. 7 that
"dubious claims of privilege are being asserted" by Lockheed.
He further noted that shareholders voted at the company's
annual meeting to redeem the poision pill, formally known as
a shareholder-rights plan, 54% to 41%.</p>
<p>"You are going through an elaborate charade that will
purport to justify a course of action that avoids compliance
with the resolution," Mr. Martin wrote. "Your efforts to
avoid the committee hearing views with which Lockheed's
current management disagrees confirm the built-in bias in the
special committee's deliberations." The correspondence was
made available through an NL filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</p>
