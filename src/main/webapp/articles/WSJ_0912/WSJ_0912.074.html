buy anytime soon.
   Wall Street analysts are cutting their 1990 and 1991
earnings estimates for the company. Although the stock has
subsided to 31 1/8, a third below its 12-month high, most
analysts are calling it a "hold" rather than a bargain.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Their reasoning: AT&T's heavy expenses in promoting its
credit card won't start paying off until at least 1992. And
recession fears are haunting the company's phone-switch and
computer businesses, just as AT&T was beginning to win
acclaim for getting its computer act together.</p>
<p>"The economy is softening and the outlook for improvement
in the near term, particularly with the Mideast crisis, isn't
good," says Jack B. Grubman, a PaineWebber analyst. "AT&T
isn't immune to this, especially in its equipment business,"
where he estimates profits have been strained by annual
pretax losses of $500 million in computers and office phone
systems.</p>
<p>Robert B. Morris III at Goldman, Sachs notes that the
manufacturing business "is nonrecurring in nature in terms of
sales, compared with AT&T's long-distance business. AT&T is a
company with cyclical exposure."</p>
<p>Joel Gross at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette says that when
the gross national product hummed along at 3% to 4% growth,
AT&T's long-distance business grew at half the industry rate
of 12% to 14%. "In a full recession of negative 2%, AT&T
could hit the low single digits or even flatten in terms of
(revenue) growth," he says.</p>
<p>Larry Prendergast, AT&T vice president and treasurer, begs
to differ: "The current view from our economists is we are
not expecting a recession in the near term," he says,
"although we are more concerned about it than we were several
months ago. . . . We have not changed our guidance of July 19
that we expect 1990 to be better than '89, a record earnings
year." The executive notes that AT&T trades at 11.5 times
analysts' per-share profit estimate for 1990, "in line with
other companies such as MCI, IBM and GE." AT&T stock has
fallen more than 20% since June, when analysts last cut their
estimates.</p>
<p>A companywide reorganization has cut almost 40,000 jobs in
two years, and AT&T Bell Laboratories -- until now the sacred
cow in cost-reduction efforts -- is expected to begin
downsizing later this year. "That's probably a good guess,"
says an AT&T spokesman. "But those would be a couple of
hundred non-technical, behind-the-scenes type jobs."</p>
<p>PaineWebber's Mr. Grubman Friday cut his full-year profit
estimate for AT&T to $2.50 a share from $2.60 -- flat against
1989's showing. He cut his 1991 estimate to $2.70 from $2.95.</p>
<p>Since March, AT&T's credit card operation has broken
banking industry records, signing up nearly three million
accounts and five million cards and racking up more than $750
million in card purchases. AT&T gets its cut from the fees
paid by merchants on those purchases and by long-distance
callers using the card. But analysts aren't sure how much
AT&T has pocketed in transaction fees from the card (and
customers who order the card this year won't ever pay an
annual fee.)</p>
<p>Mr. Grubman estimates that AT&T could be spending as much
as $100 million a quarter to push its plastic against
entrenched giants such as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan. He
says the investment is worth it. "They could have 11 million
cards by this time next year," he says. "If they do and they
get a 3% return on their assets they'll earn 35 cents a share
annually from the credit card business."</p>
<p>Mr. Morris isn't so sure. "It remains to be seen whether
AT&T can make money off credit cards," he says. "Returns in
the industry have traditionally been high, but AT&T's coming
in will likely drive industry returns down." Mr. Morris is
leaving his 1990 estimate for AT&T at $2.60 -- already one of
the Street's lowest -- but he cut his '91 prediction to $2.80
from $3.</p>
<p>Analysts are cautious about the long-distance industry's
prospects. AT&T derives between 50% and 55% of its revenue
and 85% of its profit from long distance. Many analysts cut
their estimates for MCI Communications a few weeks ago. They
worry that the long-distance marketing wars are driving up
selling costs.</p>
<p>AT&T could match the spending of its long-distance foes
easily, but that wouldn't erase its immediate problems. Says
Mr. Grubman: "Long term, AT&T has a very powerful base and is
a good investment. But near term, with all the economic
problems, its stock is going to move more sideways than up.
AT&T's performance will mirror the market's."</p>
<p>One of AT&T's biggest shareholders is the University of
California, which holds about 6.2 million shares and believes
AT&T can produce annual earnings growth of about 11% a year
over the long term. AT&T's 4.2% dividend yield exceeds the
overall stock market's and provides "some dividend support"
for AT&T shares, says Patricia Small, associate treasurer of
the university system, which manages about $16 billion of
pension and endowment funds. "The major question is whether
its growth rate will continue through all kinds of economic
cycles . . . We don't live and die with quarterly earnings
estimates."</p>
