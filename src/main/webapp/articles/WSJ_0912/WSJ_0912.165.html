	<p class="article-leader">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- In an unusual four-way deal, ASK
Computer Systems Inc. said it agreed to acquire software
maker Ingres Corp. using, in part, funds gained from stock
ASK will sell to Hewlett-Packard Co. and EDS Corp.
   ASK, a producer of management systems for manufacturing
companies, said it will pay about $123 million in cash and
debt repayments for Ingres, an Alameda, Calif., maker of
database software. ASK said it will sell a 30% stake to H-P
and EDS, a General Motors Corp. unit, for $60 million to help
generate funds for the acquisition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move is something of a coup for ASK Chief Executive
Officer Sandra Kurtzig, an ASK founder who rejoined the
company last year after a four-year absence, because the
three new partners pull in components that are crucial to the
company's success.</p>
<p>ASK already uses Ingres software in its programs, which
link companies' manufacturing and accounting departments to
the same database. H-P is already a big supplier of
workstations to ASK, which sells the machines with its
software packages. And the link with H-P and EDS, both of
which are big suppliers of systems to manufacturers, could
help ASK in marketing its products to a broader range of
manufacturers. ASK said it expects to announce further
agreements with EDS and H-P in the near future that could
include marketing pacts.</p>
<p>"Getting the EDS seal of approval on their software is a
very nice feather in their cap," said analyst Charles Taylor
of Prudential-Bache Securities, who said he had never seen
anything like ASK's four-way deal before.</p>
<p>The pact provides a savior for Ingres, which has been
troubled by falling net income, which dropped to $76,000 in
the year ended June 30 from $6.2 million a year earlier. Last
May, Ingres agreed to sell a minority stake to Digital
Equipment Corp. but the deal fell through when the two
couldn't agree on terms. ASK, which had been in discussions
with Ingres before the Digital deal, then offered to acquire
Ingres, Ms. Kurtzig said.</p>
<p>Although the deal doesn't represent a very large
investment for H-P or EDS, the ASK connection gives them a
link with a strong company in an important niche in the
rapidly growing field of computer-integrated manufacturing.
"ASK is one of the very few leading companies in the
manufacturing-software business and possibly the only one
available to make an investment in," said Mr. Taylor, the
Prudential-Bache analyst.</p>
<p>While ASK's Ms. Kurtzig calls the acquisition "a home
run," analysts such as Mr. Taylor say ASK could be in for
rough times. The database market is sluggish already, a
plight illustrated by the once-highflying Oracle Systems
Corp.'s announcement last week that it expected to report a
quarterly loss. What's more, ASK has seen profits slide over
the past several quarters as it prepares new products. The
merger "combines Ask's mediocre results with
less-than-mediocre results from Ingres," said analyst David
Bayer of Montgomery Securities. "The transition period could
be fraught with peril."</p>
<p>Under the agreement, ASK will pay $9.25 a share, or about
$110 million, for Ingres' stock and will also pay off the $12
million to $15 million debt on Ingres's books. H-P and EDS
will pay $10.78 a share for ASK stock, H-P buying a 10% stake
for about $20 million and EDS buying a 20% stake for $40
million. ASK said that Chase Manhattan Bank agreed to provide
$20 million in financing for the offer.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading, Ingres's stock
closed at $9, up $3.625, while ASK's stock closed at $8,
unchanged.</p>
