	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Lotus Development Corp. said it has
lowered its growth and profitability goals, reflecting what
it calls a "maturation" of the software market.
   Jim P. Manzi, chairman and president of the software
maker, said, however, that growth and profit trends should
become more predictable than they have been. Lotus is aiming
for long-term revenue growth in the 20% to 25% annual range,
eased from a previous 25% target. Last year, revenue grew 19%
to $556 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Manzi said the company also has scaled back its goal
of 25% pretax profit margins. But he noted that the new
target of a 20% to 25% range would represent an improvement
over the company's actual margins of 15% last year and 17% in
1988.</p>
<p>Lotus's stock fell sharply yesterday in the wake of
reports that the targets had been cut to 20%. Lotus said the
report was incorrect, and the stock rebounded from a low of
$15.25 a share but still closed at $16.50, down $1.50, in
national over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Manzi also said that the company is raising its target
for return on equity to a range of 25% to 30% from 25%.</p>
<p>He said the lower growth goal reflects slower growth in
sales of personal computers. However, he said that because
Lotus will be getting more of its revenue from recurring
software maintenance fees and product upgrades rather than
from PC sales, the revenue will be more predictable than it
has been.</p>
<p>"This isn't rocket science," he said. "There is a
long-term dynamic going on in the entire industry." He
declined to make predictions for specific periods. Lotus
earlier disappointed investors by forecasting an earnings
downturn for the third quarter.</p>
