	<p class="article-leader">Things hadn't been going well for film director Preston
Sturges, for years, when the publisher Henry Holt
commissioned his autobiography in 1959. Mr. Sturges, an
exuberant eccentric, dictated "The Events Leading Up to My
Death" just as he had dictated the quickstep film scripts
that made him famous in the '40s, fast and formless.
   The publishers reacted the way almost everyone seemed to
react to Sturges at the end: with a rejection slip. He died
not long after that.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sandy Sturges, his fourth and last wife, stored the 300
typed pages in the UCLA archives, to keep them safe for her
sons and for future biographers (two Sturges biographies have
been published; a third is due next year.) Then, at the
suggestion of an editor at Simon & Schuster, Mrs. Sturges
expanded the original material with letters and journals and
has become, 30 years after his death, her husband's
collaborator on his autobiography, now retitled "Preston
Sturges by Preston Sturges" (Simon & Schuster, 352 pages,
$22.95).</p>
<p>The most striking thing about this energetic and witty
memoir is how little it has to do with Hollywood, the place
that made Sturges an enormous success and a failure in a very
short period of time. There's almost nothing about his
legendary battles with the studio bosses, his fights for
control and how he lost the fights and the control.
Two-thirds into the book Sturges had lived almost everywhere
but California, and hadn't written or directed anything,
though he had invented a way to print directly onto curved
porcelain makeup jars, had gotten married and had briefly
found success as a cosmetics manufacturer.</p>
<p>Yet by not talking very much about his work, and talking a
great deal about his life, this smart, bouncy book really
gets at the heart of Preston Sturges's films. This is so,
because the Sturges trademark -- slapstick antics and nutty
characters who are very American yet also bizarre fringe
creatures -- turn out to have been lifted directly or
indirectly from his own peculiarly adventuresome upbringing.</p>
<p>His early life was so chaotic and so packed with events
and characters that it's impossible to encapsulate. It's
enough to know that his mother married five times, shuttled
between the U.S. and Europe as though one were a suburb of
the other, sought all manner of artistic and spiritual gurus
and started her own cosmetics company long before most
affluent women were independent enough to dress themselves.
She was Isadora Duncan's best friend; the scarf that choked
the dancer to death was a gift from Preston's mother.</p>
<p>So dilettantism came naturally to her son, and he
practiced it in a feverish way. He was a songwriter, an
inventor, a playwright, a restaurateur, a sailor, a country
gentleman -- before and after he became a screenwriter and
director. His films skipped ingeniously all over the place,
but usually had somebody in them pulling some kind of scam or
other, and often in a place populated by the rich, or the
poor trying to get rich.</p>
<p>They are about smart, pretty women who use what they've
got to get more ("The Lady Eve," "The Palm Beach Story"), and
men trying to do the same though they're not always as sure
about what "more" is ("Sullivan's Travels," "The Great
McGinty"). The Sturges pictures, which are the subject of a
retrospective at New York's Film Forum for the next six
weeks, have a style and pace that hasn't been matched yet.
Though it's easy to find the roots of many Sturges films in
the autobiography, Mrs. Sturges said in a recent interview
that she deliberately avoided too much of that kind of
cross-reference ("It's boring, boring if you haven't seen the
films," she said).</p>
<p>She was 30 years younger than her husband, and you can
still see in her the high-spirited mixture of theatricality,
smarts and giddy enthusiasm that must have drawn him to her.
She lives in a comfortably airy apartment off Sunset
Boulevard with its fair share of Preston Sturges memorabilia
(a model of his yacht, "The Destiny," for example).</p>
<p>Yet she doesn't insult her late husband by conferring
sainthood on him, or by pretending that he was fascinating
all of the time. "He would tell anecdotes like the kind that
were in the book because they'd get a good laugh, and you'd
hear them quite a lot," she said. "Like the one about his
father not being his father was a heartbreaker the first time
-- and less so 50 times later."</p>
<p>Very little of the original autobiography has remained
intact exactly as it was, though most of it is somewhere in
this expanded revision. For example, said Mrs. Sturges, "He'd
start off talking about his forebears and then skipped to
when he went to Chicago and then went off on 50 pages of
anecdotes about Chicago. Then he'd say, `Then I was a month
old,' and that would lead back to his mother and that would
lead to Isadora."</p>
<p>She'd take a sentence about Chicago, then find another
sentence, sometimes 50 pages later, that would follow in a
logical way. "There are not two paragraphs that run the way
they did. The two paragraphs were there, there was just a lot
of other stuff in between," she said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sturges isn't a writer by profession -- she does
estate planning at a Los Angeles law firm -- yet she has
managed to rearticulate "Preston Sturges by Preston Sturges"
in a fast, light style that sounds remarkably the way you'd
expect Preston Sturges to sound.</p>
<p>For instance, there's the description of his induction
into the movie business, just after having had some success
on Broadway with a hit play called "Strictly Dishonorable."
"In Hollywood I started at the bottom: a bum by the name of
Sturgeon who had once written a hit called `Strictly
Something-or-Other.' . . . My wife had decamped, my fortune
was depleted, and even though I was living on coffee and
moonlight, my costs of living continued to cost."</p>
<p>His life was difficult as well as exotic -- he was eight
before he knew the man he thought was his father wasn't --
and he doesn't gloss over the sorrowful times. He takes
death, divorce and poverty as seriously as they should be
taken, but always with the sense that something else is about
to happen that will move things along.</p>
<p>"He never felt as if he'd been impaled," said Mrs.
Sturges. "I don't mean he didn't have the Irish depression
and that's a black one. But if you're as open as he was to
things, anything was there to lighten his heart."</p>
