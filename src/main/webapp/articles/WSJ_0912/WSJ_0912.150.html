	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush called for tax incentives to
encourage domestic energy production, but many of his likely
proposals face a hard sell in Congress and probably wouldn't
produce much oil anytime soon.
   In a nationally televised speech focusing on the Persian
Gulf crisis, the president said, "The Congress should, this
month, enact measures to increase domestic energy production
and energy conservation in order to reduce dependence on
foreign oil." Listing "our energy dependence" among factors
determining "whether we can help our friends and stand up to
our foes," he vowed that "Americans must never again enter
any crisis -- economic or military -- with an excessive
dependence on foreign oil."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Bush administration is expected to release this week a
series of specific proposals that were produced by the Energy
Department and approved by the White House economic policy
committee. Department officials have said the package will be
longer-term and more controversial than an earlier package,
which included calls for Americans to inflate their car tires
more fully and increase car-pooling, and was roundly
dismissed as inadequate by conservation groups.</p>
<p>The new proposals drawn up by the department include a tax
credit designed to encourage efforts to recover hard-to-get
oil from existing fields, and an extension and reshaping of a
tax credit for investments in renewable energy projects such
as solar power. The administration also will repropose
various tax incentives for oil drilling that were included in
the president's budget proposal last January. These include
changes that would reduce the burden of the alternative
minimum tax on producers.</p>
<p>Any of these revenue-losing measures, however, would face
an uphill battle in Congress at a time the lawmakers are
trying to rein in a budget deficit that is spiraling out of
control. The tax changes in the January budget were estimated
to cost $300 million in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.</p>
<p>The president also may urge various federal agencies to
expedite the permitting process required for certain oil
drilling projects in the Beaufort Sea near Alaska and renew
his call for Congress to allow oil drilling in the Arctic
Natural Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. In his speech, the
president urged Congress "to accelerate the development of
Alaskan energy resources, without damage to wildlife."
Environmentalists are already vigorously attacking proposals
to open up the refuge, however.</p>
<p>In addition, the administration may seek to speed up its
consideration of proposed pipeline projects designed to bring
natural gas into California for use in projects designed to
recover hard-to-get oil. Actual production from such projects
would be some time off, though, according to agency
officials.</p>
<p>Among steps proposed by the Energy Department to encourage
conservation are calls for Americans to use gasoline with
lower-octane ratings. Octane measures the anti-knock capacity
of gasoline.</p>
<p>The president also called for efforts to increase
fuel-switching. Higher oil prices are already persuading
industries with dual-fuel capacity to switch to natural gas
from oil. Energy Department officals have looked at ways to
remove barriers, such as transportation problems, that could
inhibit further switching.</p>
<p>In addition, the president may issue an executive order
calling for increased energy efficiency and reduced energy
consumption in federal buildings, and the Bush administration
may urge people to tune up oil burners and replace them as
needed.</p>
