	<p class="article-leader">For six days now, the budget summiteers have been
sequestered in a converted bar at Andrews Air Force Base
outside Washington. For all of their economic relevance, it
might as well be the weird bar in the movie "Star Wars."
   Certainly the creatures in that movie are no stranger than
the summit menagerie in its glass cocoon at Andrews. Bounty
hunter Robert Byrd of West Virginia has his laser gun ready
to shoot anything remotely like a spending cut, much less a
budget-process reform. Republican Pete Domenici, the
intergalactic all-star trader from New Mexico, wants a higher
tax on energy even as he proposes "incentives" for oil
drilling. He'd get a political commission on both]</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Playing the role of tax Wookie, Georgia liberal Wyche
Fowler growls whenever anyone says "capital gains." And who's
that tending bar? Why, it's budget director Dick Darman,
trying to get everyone so sloshed on elaborate concoctions
that they'll forget he gave up the President's no-tax pledge
for nothing. Luke Taxpayer doesn't have a chance with this
crowd.</p>
<p>When it comes to economic substance, the summiteers do
seem from a faraway land. The economy is lumbering and
perhaps stalled. Unemployment jumped last month to 5.6%, and
job growth has virtually stopped. The dollar is sinking and
long bonds are close to 9%, so the Federal Reserve has little
flexibility to ease. Oil prices have climbed past $30 a
barrel, slamming the economy with a new multibillion-dollar
tax.</p>
<p>The summiteers seem oblivious to such real-world concerns.
Iraq? The lessons of the 1980s? They don't mean a thing. What
matters above all else is government "revenues." So the
Democrats opened their bidding with "$206 billion" in new
taxes over five years. Working stiffs would pay more for
beer, wine and gasoline. (The economic logic seems to be that
if a crisis raises the price of something, tax it to raise
the price even more.) The "rich," who in the end turn out to
be the middle class, would see their top income tax rate
climb to 35%, pay more for "luxuries" (like cars), and have
their income cap raised for the payroll tax.</p>
<p>Republicans don't want to be demagogued, so they're
proposing their own luxury tax. They'd also stick it to
Northeastern states with heavy tax burdens -- and Democratic
governors -- by reducing the deduction for state income
taxes. Somehow all of this is supposed to help the economy.</p>
<p>Ah, but what about "spending cuts" and "growth
incentives"? We've seen this movie before too. The opening
Democratic offer actually proposed a net increase in
non-defense spending over five years of some $40 billion.
Each side is offering a multitude of new tax breaks, the
better to buy political influence. Who knows, before this is
through we might yet see the return of George McGovern's
$1,000 tax rebate.</p>
<p>We count it as a hint of progress that the White House has
decided to re-propose a cut in the capital gains rate to 15%.
Mr. Darman is finally lending an ear to Newt Gingrich, the
House GOP whip and the only budget summiteer who's actually
uttered the words "economic growth." No wonder everyone else
wants to keep him quiet in the cocoon, too.</p>
<p>Mr. Darman's plan for sequestration is that everyone
sweats it out until they agree, and then everyone shares the
political camouflage for November. But things aren't going so
smoothly, perhaps because the summiteers are so divorced from
the normal pressures of democracy. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said yesterday, "We haven't seen the kind of
candor we hoped to see." Nonetheless, Mr. Darman was letting
the summiteers out on work release last night to listen to
President Bush speak to Congress.</p>
<p>While they're out, maybe the summiteers will pick up signs
of rank-and-file discontent. There are even hints that
Senator Pat Moynihan might link his Social Security payroll
tax cut with Senator Bob Kasten's capital gains cut. On the
Senate floor Monday, Mississippi Republican Trent Lott caught
the prevailing winds. In his state, he said, "The people
understand that there is too much spending going on up here,
too much positioning, and tax increases are paid by real
people out in the real world."</p>
<p>Mr. Lott said he won't vote for any tax increase, and
added that maybe it's time for George Bush "to go over the
heads of the Congress to the American people and sock it to
the Congress for not being serious." Or maybe next time Mr.
Darman should sequester the entire Congress?</p>
