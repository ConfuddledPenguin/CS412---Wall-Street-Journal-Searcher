	<p class="article-leader">EDEN, N.C. -- Fieldcrest Cannon Inc., citing dismal
operating results, halved its quarterly dividend on common
stock to 10 cents a share from 20 cents and slashed its
quarterly dividend on Class B stock 56% to eight cents a
share from 18 cents.
   Both dividends are payable Oct. 1 to stock of record Sept.
21.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The textile concern's senior vice president, finance, K.
William Fraser, said the board voted to cut the payouts "in
response to our current operating results and the weak market
environment."</p>

or 58 cents a share, compared with year-earlier net income of
$7.7 million, or 74 cents a share. Sales fell to $316.3
million from $346.4 million.</p>
