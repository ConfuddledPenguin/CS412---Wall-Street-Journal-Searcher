	<p class="article-leader">DENVER -- Federal Judge Sherman Finesilver approved an
$13.7 million settlement of a 1984 class action lawsuit
against former directors and officers of Storage Technology
Corp., said Nicholas E. Chimicles, lead attorney for the
70,000 investors who are members of the suit.
   Under the terms of the settlement, investors will receive
$6.3 million in cash and 377,750 shares in Storage Technology
valued at $7.4 million at recent prices. The suit charged the
company's former management with making misleading statements
about finances between June 1982 and October 1984.</p>
