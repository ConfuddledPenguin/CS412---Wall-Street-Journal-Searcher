	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Oryx Energy Co. said it paid $968 million to buy
17% of its common shares outstanding from several trusts
controlled by the founding family of Sun Co.
   Oryx, an oil and gas exploration and production company,
also said it would convert an additional 7.3 million common
shares held by the Pew family trusts into a new issue of
non-voting preferred stock that a trustee is expected to sell
immediately, eliminating the Pew family's 27% stake in Oryx.
Oryx was spun off from Sun in 1988 as Sun Exploration &
Production Co. and has since changed its name.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The trustee for the family, Glenmede Trust Co. of
Philadelphia, couldn't be reached for comment. Oryx said the
transaction resulted after "it became apparent that
Glenmede's long-term objectives were incompatible with Oryx
Energy's strategic plans."</p>
<p>Oryx said Glenmede had sought a higher yield on its
investment, pressing for an increase in the energy concern's
30-cent-a-share quarterly dividend. Robert P. Hauptfuhrer,
chairman and chief executive officer, said that because of
extensive cash needs for the company's exploration and
production activities, "it is not our intention to increase
our dividend."</p>
<p>Oryx paid Glenmede $53.75 a share for the 18 million
common shares. In composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday, Oryx shares closed at $53.625, down 25
cents. The company announced the buy-back after the market
closed.</p>
<p>Oryx, which currently has 105 million common shares
outstanding, said it will have about 87 million shares
outstanding after the buy-back is completed and the preferred
shares are converted back to common for new owners.</p>
<p>Oryx said it will pay for the shares with debt it said it
will eventually eliminate through divestitures. The company
said it has signed letters of intent to sell about $150
million in oil and gas assets by year-end and expects to
divest another $600 million of assets by September 1991.</p>
<p>Separately, the company adopted a shareholders rights plan
under which holders of Oryx common would be entitled to
purchase one one-thousandth of a share of a new Series A
preference stock at an exercise price of $150. The rights are
exercisable, among other things, when a 20% or more stake in
the company is acquired.</p>
