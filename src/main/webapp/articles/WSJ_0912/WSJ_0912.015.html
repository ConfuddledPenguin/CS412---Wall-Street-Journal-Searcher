	<p class="article-leader">Andrew J. Krieger, one of the biggest and most
controversial traders in global currency markets, is back in
the saddle.
   The 34-year-old currency options trader, who made about
$300 million in pretax foreign exchange earnings for Bankers
Trust Co. in 1987, is starting a new investment unit at
Capital Holding Corp., an insurance holding company based in
Louisville, Ky.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>His new job means that, for the first time in two years,
Mr. Krieger will manage enough money to be a major player
again in the $640 billion-a-day currency trading market, the
world's biggest. At Bankers Trust, and later at Soros
Management Co., a New York investment partnership, Mr.
Krieger was known for making trades so gigantic that
awestruck colleagues credited him with singlehandedly moving
currency exchange rates.</p>
<p>The co-head of the new subsidiary, Capital Holding
Currency Advisors, is Jonathan M. Berg, a former Bankers
Trust managing director. Both Messrs. Krieger and Berg have
been named managing directors of the unit, which will be
based in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.</p>
<p>The unit will trade mostly currency options for large
institutional clients, central banks and wealthy individuals,
as well as manage a small amount of Capital Holding's own
funds. An option gives its holder the right, but not the
obligation, to sell or purchase a security or, in this case,
currency at a specific price on or before a specific date.</p>
<p>The new Capital Holding unit will offer investors three
basic products: an aggressive investment involving a high
degree of risk and potentially big rewards; a less-aggressive
trading strategy in which losses are limited to 11% to 15% a
year; and one in which investors are guaranteed the return of
their full initial investments at the end of a prescribed
period. Minimum investments will range from $100,000 to $5
million.</p>
<p>Through Messrs. Krieger and Berg, who will be responsible
for the unit's marketing and sales, Capital Holding hopes to
increase its fee-based income, expand its expertise in
foreign markets, and diversify its portfolios, said Joseph M.
Tumbler, president of Capital Holding's accumulation and
investment group, which also manages Capital's portfolio.</p>
<p>Last year, Capital Holding earned $219.7 million on
revenue of $2.5 billion. At year end, the company had about
$15 billion in assets.</p>
<p>"When Jon {Berg} first told me we're going to Kentucky, I
said: `The horse races aren't for a while,'" Mr. Krieger
said. "When he said, `We're going to Capital Holding,' I
said, `What's Capital Holding?,' and Jon said: `Trust me.'"
The insurance company had been one of Mr. Berg's clients at
Bankers Trust.</p>
<p>"Frankly," Mr. Krieger said, "they wanted to take a look
at me to see what kind of animal I was." Part of the process,
he said, included seating Mr. Krieger in a room "at the head
of a table with 13 people and grilling me for three hours on
everything from how I make trading decisions to how, when and
why I take profits and losses."</p>
<p>Most traders and investors use currency options to hedge
an existing foreign-exchange position or to speculate on
currency movements with a small part of a large portfolio.</p>
<p>By contrast, Mr. Krieger regards options as a separate
investment or asset category, and a conservative way to trade
currencies. Because currency option trading volume is heavy,
"The amount of money I can manage on a leveraged basis with
limited downside risk is very large," said Mr. Krieger, who
earned a reputation at Bankers Trust as a mover of markets
because of his large trades.</p>
<p>The big risk in investing with options is that they will
expire before they can be exercised at a profit. In that
case, the investor loses all of the money initially paid to
purchase the option.</p>
<p>But Mr. Krieger said that with his approach, "I don't have
to be right a whole lot, only about 25% to 30% of the time,
to yield substantial results." This is because options allow
an investor to bet on moves in large amounts of currencies
with relatively small premiums. A $100,000 investment in
options would normally control $30 million to $40 million of
foreign currency.</p>
<p>He also said that during the course of a year, he
generally spends only 10% to 15% of all assets under
management to buy options. "So, even if I'm wrong on every
play, the downside is quite tolerable," Mr. Krieger said.</p>
<p>Like his view of the options he trades, Mr. Krieger is
controversial. Unhappy with the $3 million, or 1%, bonus he
received for making the $300 million for Bankers Trust in
1987, he quit the following February. With a 5% bonus, which
is common for traders, Mr. Krieger would have netted $15
million. "I was very, very disappointed with the bonus on
principal, rather than the actual amount," he said. "It was
more money than I ever thought I'd need, but it wasn't fair."
He also needed a break from the intense world of trading, he
said.</p>
<p>He later joined Soros but said he resigned after making
$45 million for the investment firm in 14 weeks. "My hours
were worse than they were at Bankers," he said. After a break
and travels to India, Mr. Krieger then set up his own firm;
its business will be transferred to the new Capital Holding
unit.</p>
<p>He described the new unit as "a long-term venture; we have
a long-term commitment."</p>
<p>Mr. Krieger's eclectic background includes a master's
degree and doctoral studies in Indian philosophy,
translations of Sanskrit texts, and a brief six-month career
as a professional tennis player. He always intended to make
his career in academia, but in the early 1980s, a combination
of marriage, a child and cutbacks in educational funding
forced him to reassess.</p>
<p>"I was told by my adviser: `You're a great student, you
will be a great scholar, but you won't get a job until
someone dies in a plane crash,'" Mr. Krieger said. "Rather
than wishing someone's death, I decided to change fields."</p>
