	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Criminals, crooks, thugs of all varieties.
Beware.
   Law-enforcement agencies in Boston have hooked up their
version of the Batphone. If you see wrongdoing, day or night,
call 1-800-SOS-FRAUD.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Is the city about to have a crime wave?</p>
<p>Absolutely. But, up here, they call it public works.</p>
<p>Boston, a city with a glorious past of public corruption,
is on the brink of its two largest-ever public-works
projects: the $6 billion cleanup of Boston Harbor and the $5
billion construction of an underground central-artery roadway
and a tunnel to the airport.</p>
<p>Though the harbor cleanup is just under way, and the
central-artery construction has yet to begin, a task force of
nine law-enforcement agencies, ranging from the Federal
Bureau of Investigation to the U.S. Postal Inspection
Service, has assembled a first-strike capability to ferret
out corruption -- as soon as it begins.</p>
<p>"Over the next 10 years, $11 billion will be spent on
these two giant projects -- an amount of cash that will
invite a measure of theft, fraud and corruption," says
Assistant U.S. Attorney Ralph Gants, who is heading the task
force. "We see the task force and hot line as prudent
foresight."</p>
<p>Yesterday, the task force held a news conference to show
off hot-line posters to be hung at job sites and to announce
an advertising campaign to trumpet 1-800-SOS-FRAUD in
newspapers, magazines, radio and television.</p>
<p>Mr. Gants, who believes this is the first hot line to
detect -- and, it is hoped, deter -- fraudulent activity,
acknowledges that the media campaign is bound to ruffle
feathers.</p>
<p>On that, there's some agreement.</p>
<p>"Once they take care of the S&L scandal, they can worry
about some construction worker stealing a two-by-four," says
Mark Erlich of the Massachusetts Building Trades Council, who
is especially miffed that the hot-line ad features a photo of
a construction worker. "Better they should show a contractor
in a blue suit or some sleazy developer."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, operators are on duty. Mr. Gants says agencies
in the task force will rotate covering the phones. Postal
inspector John Burns reports two calls yesterday after radio
stations publicized the number. "Real calls," he says
gleefully, "both possible leads."</p>
