	<p class="article-leader">Helmerich & Payne Inc. said exchange of the remainder of
its 7 1/2% subordinated debentures will result in a $19.7
million pretax gain to be recorded in the current and
following quarter. There are about $34 million of the
debentures outstanding.
   The Tulsa, Okla., contract drilling concern said each
$1,000 debenture is exchangeable for 17.316 shares of Sun Co.
and 17.316 shares of Oryx Energy Co. common owned by
Helmerich & Payne.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Helmerich & Payne said that because holders may exchange
the debentures at any time prior to the official Oct. 12
redemption date, it anticipates exchanging a portion of the
debentures during both the current fourth quarter, ending
Sept. 30, and the first quarter, starting Oct. 1.</p>
