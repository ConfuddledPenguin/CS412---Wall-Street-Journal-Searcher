	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- It was a bad day for rumors. There weren't
any, which left precious little to guide investors in the
financial markets.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 2.97 points lower
on skimpy volume to 2612.62. Stocks generally moved in the
opposite direction of oil prices, though a late sell-off
pushed the October futures contract for crude oil down 54
cents by the close to $30.76 a barrel.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bonds rose in quiet trading, with many investors awaiting
inflation data to be released Friday. The dollar strengthened
against most of the major foreign currencies.</p>
<p>Kurt Schultz, senior stock-index analyst at Refco Group in
Chicago, said the stock market is nervously vulnerable
because of the Mideast situation, with much of the jitters
showing up first in stock-index futures trading. "Even
institutions have a trading mentality," he said, and
investors can either trade against one another or hover on
the sidelines. "Everyone is afraid to explore new territory.
Do you sell at new {intraday} lows? Do you buy at new highs?
Not likely."</p>
<p>Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu
Economics, said Monday's 38-point swing in the Dow
industrials "was all rumor driven." Vague talk of Iraqi
military activity erased "a fairly decent gain and drubbed
the bond and stock markets." Yesterday, he said, stocks
failed to regain the upward momentum evident Monday before
the rumors sparked selling.</p>
<p>"That indicates there's greater wariness about trying to
be too certain of developments with that black box of the
Mideast still out there," Mr. Fabbri said. Low volume also
indicated investors were waiting to hear President Bush's
comments last night on the Mideast crisis, he said.</p>
<p>Bond investors said they are waiting for something
positive to come out of the budget talks in Washington and
for the producer price index, which is scheduled for release
Friday. The measure of inflation at the wholesale level
during August is expected to jump because of soaring oil
prices.</p>
<p>The dollar was buoyed by the growing suspicion that the
Federal Reserve won't ease interest rates soon, a move that
would erode the return on dollar-denominated investments
compared with investments in countries where rates have been
rising.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices fell. Volume was 113.2 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues led
advancers, 835 to 609.</p>
<p>Bond prices rose nearly 3/8 of a point, or $3.75 for each
$1,000 of face amount. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.92%.</p>
<p>The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.5855 marks and 140.30 yen, compared with
1.5820 marks and 139.55 yen Monday.</p>
