	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Citing figures showing that taxpayer
subsidies to Dallas-based Bluebonnet Savings Bank are
considerably higher than the original estimate, Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) urged that the federal government
renegotiate its 1988 sale of the thrift.
   Sen. Metzenbaum said documents obtained from lawyers for
Bluebonnet show government payments to the savings and loan
association will total $573 million for this year. At the
time of the sale, federal regulators estimated that the
figure would be roughly $361 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1988, Arizona insurance executive James Fail purchased
15 insolvent thrifts held by the government and merged them
to create Bluebonnet. The deal has attracted considerable
attention because it included substantial federal subsidies
to the ailing thrifts and because Mr. Fail acquired the
thrifts with the help of Robert Thompson, a Washington
lobbyist with ties to the Reagan and Bush administrations.</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson appeared yesterday before a Senate Judiciary
subcommittee headed by Sen. Metzenbaum. The lobbyist, who
served as a 1980 campaign aide to George Bush and
subsequently as a special assistant to President Reagan, was
sharply criticized for allegedly peddling access to
administration officials. He answered that his expertise was
in "the process" of government and charged, "One of the
reasons I'm here (before the subcommittee) is that I used to
work for George Bush."</p>
<p>The hearing provided a vivid glimpse into the world of
Washington lobbying. Mr. Thompson testified that in addition
to a monthly retainer of $15,000 to $20,000, Mr. Fail agreed
to pay him, for assistance with federal regulators, a
$160,000 bonus and 2% of Mr. Fail's earnings from Bluebonnet.
Citing documents from Mr. Thompson and others, however, Sen.
Arlen Specter (R., Pa.) said it appeared that Mr. Thompson
had been promised 2% of the entire $96 million transaction,
or nearly $2 million.</p>
<p>Thus far, Mr. Thompson has received only the monthly
retainer from Mr. Fail, according to his attorney, Stanley
Brand.</p>
<p>At the hearing, Sen. Metzenbaum said that the subcommittee
originally placed the overall cost to the government of Mr.
Fail's purchase of Bluebonnet at $1.8 billion. Last month,
that figure was revised to $3 billion. And now, the senator
said, "All bets are off with respect to the ultimate federal
financing of the Bluebonnet fiasco."</p>
<p>But according to Mary Creedon, associate director of
savings and loan insurance operations at the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., the new figure didn't necessarily mean that
Bluebonnet's cost to the government was growing. Rather, she
said, the second figure included accrued interest on the sum
and the first figure didn't.</p>
