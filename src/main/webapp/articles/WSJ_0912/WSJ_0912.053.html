	<p class="article-leader">DEARBORN, Mich. -- Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti luxury
division, which stumbled in its first months on the U.S.
market, said it's now on track to sell 40,000 cars in the
1991 model year, which begins Oct. 1, up from about 17,000
cars in the current period.
   A key to Infiniti's plans is the new G20 luxury sedan,
which goes on sale this fall at a starting price of $17,500,
division officials said at a product preview here yesterday.
At that price, the G20, powered by a four-cylinder,
140-horsepower engine, is less expensive than many of its
European competitors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To enhance the image of its flagship Q45 sedan, Infiniti
said it will offer an optional $4,000 "active suspension"
system, one of the first of its type offered in the U.S. The
system uses computer-controlled, hydraulic pumps that drive
the wheels down into the road to counteract the jolts from
bumps. Infiniti raised the 1991 model-year base price of the
Q45 by 2.6%, or $1,000, to $39,000.</p>
<p>Infiniti officials conceded that the brand got off to a
slower-than-expected start in the U.S., and suffered from
comparisons with Toyota Motor Corp.'s more successful Lexus
division. Lexus has sold 40,146 cars as of the end of August,
compared with 13,303 for Infiniti.</p>
<p>William R. Bruce, Infiniti's vice president and general
manager, said the division stuck too long with its initial
arty ad campaign. Moreover, the division took longer to
establish its dealer network than expected.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Bruce said the division expects sales to rise
to 80,000-90,000 cars a year within five years.</p>
