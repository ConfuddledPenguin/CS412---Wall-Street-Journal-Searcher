	<p class="article-leader">Burritt Interfinancial Bancorp's stock plunged on its
announcement that it expects to report that third-quarter
non-performing loans, those not earning interest, will rise
and that earnings in the third and fourth quarters will drop.
   The New Britain, Conn., bank holding company estimates
that non-performing assets will rise to 5% to 6% of assets
for the third quarter from about 1.1% in the second quarter.
As a result, the company foresees a "significant decline" in
profit for the third and fourth quarters.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1989, Burritt earned $1.5 million, or 44 cents a share,
in the third quarter and $1.4 million, or 43 cents a share,
in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The announcement temporarily halted trading of Burritt
stock yesterday; when trading resumed, its stock sank to
$3.50 a share, down $1.25, in national over-the-counter
trading.</p>
