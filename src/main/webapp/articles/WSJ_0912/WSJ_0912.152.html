	<p class="article-leader">Under pressure from the banking and accounting industries,
an accounting standards body is close to scaling back a
proposal that would have made bank earnings more volatile.
   The Accounting Standards Executive Committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants is meeting
this week in Seattle to decide whether to issue a final draft
of a proposal meant to standardize the accounting for debt
securities held by financial institutions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed changes were also prompted by concern about
abuses of current guidelines. Critics say that under existing
practices, financial institutions can massage their financial
profile by selling securities in which they have a profit
while continuing to carry at cost a different batch of the
same securities in which they have a paper loss.</p>
<p>But there has been concern that the proposed guidelines,
rather than giving investors a clearer picture of the value
of debt securities held, would create wide fluctuations in
bank earnings.</p>
<p>John L. Kreischer, chairman of the executive committee,
said that the group is now leaning toward requiring
institutions to disclose unrealized losses, but not include
them in their income statement, as had been proposed.</p>
<p>Mr. Kreischer also said that the committee is considering
eliminating a controversial paragraph that would have
required banks to forecast the interest rates at which they
would sell securities. The group might also eliminate or
change another controversial part of the proposal that would
create a new accounting category that would force management
to state how long it planned to hold a debt security.</p>
<p>"We're concerned that it's very difficult for anyone to
examine intent to hold {a security} for the foreseeable
future," he said.</p>
<p>Forcing banks to declare more pointedly their intentions
about security sales is controversial because those
intentions would determine how the securities are treated on
income statements. It involves using either historical cost
or market value as a measurement. Currently, debt securities
are classified either as long-term investments, which are
treated at historical cost, or as trading assets, which are
marked to market.</p>
<p>The accounting group finds itself in a squeeze, however,
because aside from opposition to the proposed guidelines, it
faces pressure from regulators to go beyond current standards
and to establish more uniform rules within the financial
industry.</p>
<p>Banks have insisted that the treatment of debt securities
under the proposal would cause sharp, unnecessary earnings
declines if more of the securities in a portfolio were
reclassified and valued at the lower of cost or market.</p>
<p>Arthur Stoffel, a partner in the Chicago office of
accounting firm Grant Thornton, said the guidelines would
create "big gyrations" in banks' profitability, and make it
"more difficult for managements to make intelligent buy-sell
decisions."</p>
<p>Bankers said the proposal's effect on banks would depend
upon each bank's securities position. Clearly, if a portfolio
of securities has declined in value since it was purchased,
the effect would be to decrease profits in the period in
which the securities values declined. Banks whose portfolios
had net gains in value wouldn't see much effect since the
securities would continue to be valued at their original
cost. Such unrealized gains might also be disclosed, Mr.
Kreischer said.</p>
<p>Small banks, which often have a larger percentage of their
assets in debt securities due to soft loan demand or local
economic conditions, might be more adversely affected than
large banks.</p>
<p>Bankers also contend that in current form the proposed
guidelines would be virtually unworkable -- and the
accounting panel seems to have come to agree with them. Not
only would it be difficult to audit implementation of the
proposal, the banks argue, but it would also limit banks'
flexibility in altering their asset and liability mix as
economic conditions change. In effect, banks would be forced
to make investment decisions based on accounting treatment
rather than economic factors, they say.</p>
