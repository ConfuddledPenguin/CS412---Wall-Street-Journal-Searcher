	<p class="article-leader">Your Aug. 3 article "Florida Is Gaining Reputation as
Haven for Debtors Who Seek to Shelter Wealth" was informative
and well-researched. However, another bit of information is
crucial to anyone considering filing for bankruptcy.
   Although the article correctly stated that state laws
protect a homestead from the claims of creditors in
bankruptcy, with Texas and Florida having particularly
generous homestead exemptions, a homestead is not protected
from the IRS. Indeed, the Bankruptcy Code specifically
provides that the homestead exemption does not provide
protection from a properly filed tax lien. The IRS routinely
seizes and sells the homes of the delinquent taxpayers.</p>
