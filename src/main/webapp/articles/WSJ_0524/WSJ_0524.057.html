	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- An oversight body of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board made it more difficult for the FASB to issue
accounting-rule pronouncements.
   Heeding criticism from businesses that some FASB
rule-makings were overly complex and costly, the oversight
group boosted voting approval requirements for the
seven-member rule-making body to 5-to-2. Currently, the FASB,
the chief rule-making body for accountants, requires that a
simple majority approve its pronouncements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some businesses applauded the new voting requirements,
which "give the standard-setting process more credibility,"
said Tom Jones, executive vice president of Citicorp. "It was
hard for me to say accounting principles were generally
accepted if they were passed by a bare 4-to-3 majority."</p>
<p>But it isn't clear that the changes will make some FASB
decisions more acceptable. The new voting requirements are
scheduled to go into effect Jan. 1, after the FASB is
expected to finish work on a controversial proposal that
would force companies to accrue or set up a reserve for
future medical benefits of retirees.</p>
<p>The FASB also plans to reconsider controversial standards
it set several years ago that account for
corporate-income-tax expenses. "We have four people in favor
of the changes," said Dennis R. Beresford, chairman of the
FASB, who opposed the tighter voting approval requirements.
"Now that we will have to get at least five favorable votes
to make changes, it's not clear we'll have the votes."</p>
<p>He said the new FASB voting requirements "may actually
work against" the business community on some issues.</p>
<p>William Gladstone, co-chief executive officer of Ernst &
Young, said the voting-requirement change was made "with a
long-term view." Mr. Gladstone, a trustee of the Financial
Accounting Foundation, the board's oversight body, added that
"there wasn't even a hint of anyone trying to get this voting
rule in time to stop or affect anything the FASB board is
doing." The Financial Accounting Foundation's trustees
approved the new voting standards by a vote of 11 to 5.</p>
<p>About 15% of the pronouncements made by the FASB since it
was founded in 1973 were passed by a 4-to-3 vote. But such
close votes have centered on some of the most controversial
issues.</p>
