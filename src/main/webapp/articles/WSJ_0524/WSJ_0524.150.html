	<p class="article-leader">A Florida lawyer accused of helping a former Ashland Oil
Co. chairman sell company secrets to National Iranian Oil Co.
was found innocent on all charges by a federal jury in New
York.
   Charles D. Barnett, 39 years old, had been charged with
one count of conspiracy and six counts of fraud in connection
with the alleged scheme. But in a defeat for federal
prosecutors -- and for Ashland, whose private investigator
first brought the allegations to the attention of prosecutors
-- the jury said Mr. Barnett had committed no crime.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Instead, several jurors, speaking after the verdict was
read, said the jury decided that Ashland cheated the
Iranians. Based on the judge's instructions, the jurors
couldn't convict Mr. Barnett if they believed Ashland had
committed fraud or deceit against Iran.</p>
<p>The U.S. alleged the scheme to sell the documents arose
when Orin Atkins, who was forced to resign as Ashland
chairman in 1981, became hard-pressed for money. Mr. Atkins
pleaded guilty last year to conspiracy and wire fraud and
agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, N.Y., called Mr.
Atkins, formerly a close friend of Mr. Barnett's father, to
testify against the lawyer.</p>
<p>Roy Furmark, an oil broker and middleman in the Reagan
administration's arms sales to Iran, also pleaded guilty to
conspiracy for his role in the Ashland scheme and cooperated
with prosecutors.</p>
<p>Prosecutors alleged that Iran planned to use the stolen
documents in a civil suit it filed against Ashland in 1985
for failure to pay for oil that Iran delivered to it; under
the alleged scheme, in return for the documents Iran would
pay Mr. Barnett and others a cut of any damages it won. In
the oil-delivery case, the Iranian oil company sued Ashland
for $780 million in damages, and settled the case last year
when Ashland agreed to pay $325 million.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Ashland, Ky., company said the Barnett
prosecution "was a criminal case brought by the government
involving matters in which two persons have already pleaded
guilty and Ashland was the victim. Any statement that Ashland
defrauded the Iranians is ludicrous. Even the Iranians, in a
10-year dispute . . ., never made that allegation."</p>
<p>"It's been two years out of my life," said Mr. Barnett,
who plans to return to his corporate and real-estate law
practice in West Palm Beach. "I never thought I was guilty of
anything. I didn't understand why the others pleaded guilty."</p>
<p>Marvin B. Segal, Mr. Barnett's lawyer, argued in court
that his client was performing a legitimate legal service for
the Iranian company, rather than conspiring in an illegal
scheme. After the verdict, several jurors spent about an hour
discussing the case with Mr. Segal and other lawyers. Mr.
Segal said jurors were most concerned about "what Ashland had
done and what they saw as a fraud committed by Ashland. . . .
Their position is, why isn't the government going after
Ashland?"</p>
<p>Herve Gouraige, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted
the case, said, "We accept the jury's verdict," but declined
to comment further.</p>
<p>Mr. Atkins and Mr. Furmark are scheduled to be sentenced
next month.</p>

<p>STEPTOE & JOHNSON will create Moscow office as joint
venture with Soviets.</p>
<p>Although other U.S. law firms have established Moscow
offices, the Steptoe & Johnson venture will be the first law
office run jointly by Americans and Soviets. Apco Associates,
a unit of Arnold & Porter, has a joint venture with the
Soviets, but Apco technically isn't a law firm but a law-firm
subsidiary engaged in non-legal consulting.</p>
<p>The Steptoe venture, named InterLex, will be staffed by
U.S. and Soviet lawyers. Steptoe Managing Partner Robert
Jordan said Sarah Carey, who became a Steptoe partner after
leaving the now-defunct Heron Burchette Ruckert & Rothwell,
was instrumental in setting up the venture, and would serve
as its chairwoman. He said InterLex's clients would include
companies that sell computer equipment and such raw materials
as oil and metals. He declined to name any.</p>
<p>Mr. Jordan said the new law office, which he expects to be
in operation within 30 days, would seek to provide clients
with access to Soviet officials. "Sometimes that has a nasty
connotation," he said, but more often it simply means
"knowing people." Among InterLex's employees will be Irina
Savelyeva, who according to a Steptoe news release was "a
principal author of the new Soviet copyright-protection
legislation." Asked whether the concept of the "revolving
door" is being introduced to the Soviet Union, Mr. Jordan
said Ms. Savelyeva didn't have a "formal position" with the
Soviet government.</p>
<p>But Mr. Jordan didn't rule out hiring former Soviet
officials in the future: "I suppose anything is possible."</p>

<p>LAW FIRM EXPANSION slowed in 1989 at 500 largest firms,
survey finds.</p>
<p>Amid slower overall growth in the economy and a decline in
major corporate transactions, the nation's largest law firms
appear to be more cautious about taking on new partners and
associates. The 500 largest firms grew 7.7% in 1989, compared
with growth of 9.2% in 1988 and 9.9% in 1987, according to
the survey conducted by Of Counsel, a publication of Prentice
Hall Law & Business.</p>
<p>But growth continued unabated at the so-called megafirms.
Chicago-based Baker & McKenzie, which remains the nation's
largest law firm, expanded 15%, to 1,487 lawyers from 1,294.
The next largest, Cleveland's Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue,
grew 22% to 1,150 lawyers. New York's Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meager & Flom reached 1,032 lawyers, up more than 10%.</p>
<p>While most of the firms surveyed expanded modestly last
year, 83 shrank in size. The slowed expansion overall appears
to reflect declining demand for legal work, rising expenses
for office overhead, and growing corporate use of in-house
lawyers.</p>
<p>Many of the firms in the survey indicated that their
reluctance to take on new lawyers could continue through
1990, particularly if the slump in high-paying mergers and
acqusitions work continues.</p>
<p>"I don't think we're going to see a comeback" this year,
said Paul Roy, a partner at the legal consulting firm
Hildebrandt Inc., of Somerville, N.J.</p>

<p>CONVICTIONS of lawyer and accountant in collapse of
Landbank Equity upheld.</p>
<p>The federal appeals in Richmond, Va., denied appeals on
behalf of Frank E. Butler III, a lawyer and co-founder of
Landbank Equity Corp. and Owen R. Thornton the
second-mortgage lender's former accountant. Landbank, of
Virginia Beach, Va., and once among the largest
second-mortgage companies in the nation, collapsed in 1985
leaving more than $100 million in debts.</p>
<p>Messrs. Thornton and Butler were convicted of multiple
fraud and racketeering counts for falsifying credit
applications, doctoring financial statements and
misappropriating loan proceeds.</p>
<p>Both began serving prison terms in January 1989 but
appealed on grounds that their jury was tainted when their
co-defendant, a former Landbank vice-president, committed
suicide after the jury was impaneled. The appeal judges
upheld a lower court's refusal to grant a mistrial.</p>
<p>The judge in the case, J. Calvitt Clarke Jr., polled
jurors individually before allowing the trial to continue.</p>

<p>UNIVERSITY SUES NEA, claiming new grant requirements are
unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Last year, Congress passed a law requiring grant
recipients to certify that none of the funds will be used to
promote "materials which in the judgment of the National
Endowment for the Arts may be considered obscene." The law
was adopted amid controversy over NEA funding of certain
exhibitions, such as the work of the late photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe.</p>
<p>In its suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the New
School for Social Research said the new restrictions violate
grant recipients' rights to free speech and due process. The
suit said the obscenity requirement is too vague to be
constitutional. The school recently won a $45,000 grant to
help fund a sculpture garden, but it has refused to sign the
required certification as a matter of principle, said Floyd
Abrams, attorney for the school.</p>
<p>Mr. Abrams said the suit is the first challenging the
constitutionality of the new restrictions.</p>
<p>He said it will require the court to determine "whether
the NEA can require the surrender of First Amendment rights
as the price-tag for a grant."</p>
