	<p class="article-leader">PHOENIX, Ariz. -- Pinnacle West Capital Corp., which
suspended its 40-cent-a-share common stock dividend in
October, probably won't resume a payout for another three
years, Richard Snell, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, told the annual meeting.
   Pinnacle West, a utility holding company, eliminated its
payout in the face of mounting losses from its MeraBank
thrift unit and considered applying for bankruptcy law
protection. MeraBank is now in the hands of federal
regulators.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a 2 1/2-hour meeting punctuated by calls for the
board's resignation and by angry suggestions of management
incompetence, Mr. Snell repeated Pinnacle West's opposition
to a $1.82 billion takeover offer by PacifiCorp and a $500
million bid from the quasi-municipal Salt River Project
utility for certain electric service territory. Both offers
were made last week and were formally rejected by Pinnacle
West on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Snell said that Pinnacle West can recover from its
ill-timed thrift and real estate diversification that has
cost the company more than $900 million in losses. In the 12
months ended March 31, Pinnacle West, which includes the
profitable Arizona Public Service Co., had net losses of
$559.3 million, or $6.44 a share, on $1.5 billion in
operating revenue.</p>
<p>"Listen closely to this answer -- this company will
survive," Mr. Snell told one testy shareholder.</p>
<p>But many in the audience were less upbeat. "The bottom
line is that this board has failed; if this were a college
course, they would have flunked," shareholder Richard Baron
told Mr. Snell.</p>
<p>About half of the more than 1,000 people in the room stood
when asked by a shareholder how many would accept
PacifiCorp's cash offer of $21 a share. And questioner after
questioner challenged Pinnacle West's rejection of the offer.
Mr. Snell later said the informal poll wasn't representative.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Pinnacle West's stock closed at $16, up 12.5 cents, on volume
of 553,300 shares.</p>
<p>Officials of PacifiCorp, a utility holding company based
in Portland, Ore., didn't directly address the meeting.
However, a number of its officials were in the audience.</p>
<p>Verl Topham, a PacifiCorp executive vice president, said
following the meeting that PacifiCorp would like to bring its
courtship of an unwilling Pinnacle West "to some sort of
conclusion and get on with it." PacifiCorp officials have
declined to rule out hostile action and have said that they
may make a decision shortly.</p>
