	<p class="article-leader">KLM Royal Dutch Airlines reported that rising aviation
fuel prices were partly responsible for a 9% drop in net
income in its year ended March 31.
   Although the results are only preliminary, the Dutch
airline said earnings fell to 340 million guilders ($181
million) from 374 million guilders in fiscal 1989. The
company will issue final figures June 13.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>KLM also said its earnings were hurt by higher levels of
depreciation and an increase in financial expenses.</p>
<p>Despite the drop in net, the Dutch airline reported a
revenue gain of 8.3% to 6.5 billion guilders from 6 billion
guilders.</p>
<p>Operating profit before interest payments fell to 310
million guilders from 390 million guilders in fiscal 1989.</p>
