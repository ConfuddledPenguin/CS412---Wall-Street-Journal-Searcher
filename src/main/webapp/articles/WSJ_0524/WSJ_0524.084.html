	<p class="article-leader">NANHAI COUNTY, China -- Kevin Chen, a Cantonese shoemaker
in south China's bustling export belt, is an apt symbol of
why President Bush wants Congress to agree to extend trade
benefits to China.
   Mr. Chen is a true child of China's decade of economic
overhaul. The 38-year-old ex-farmhand is the director of
Nanhai Pingxi Shoe Factory. The company, based here in this
rural area just south of Canton, makes a million pairs of
running shoes a year for Adidas. Most of his 1,600 workers
are fresh off the farm as well, some of the millions flocking
to new business opportunties that abound in the export-driven
economies of Guangdong province.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"You Americans are always talking about protecting the
human rights of the Chinese people," says Mr. Chen. "If China
loses `most favored nation' trade status, I'll have 1,600
people out of work, back on the farms looking for something
to do. Is that protecting Chinese human rights?"</p>
<p>Mr. Bush, who seems to share Mr. Chen's concerns, plans to
extend for one year China MFN status, which guarantees the
lowest possible tariffs for China's exports. Depriving
Beijing of the benefit would push up tariffs steeply, causing
a loss to China, by its own estimate, of $10 billion a year
in export revenue. Congress can block the proposal, but --
barring a major human-rights blunder by Beijing -- isn't
likely to muster the two-thirds voting majority that would be
required.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as Congress begins pondering the president's
recommendation, there is sure to be fierce debate. The China
sanctions question is double-edged. On the one hand, many
congressional critics of Beijing feel an impulse to deprive
China of preferential trade terms to penalize its leadership
for the massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators last June 4
as well as for its repressive human-rights policies and
partial backtracking on economic overhaul.</p>
<p>But taking away MFN also would surely hurt economic
pioneers like Mr. Chen who have been among the major
proponents and beneficiaries of China's move away from
Stalinism. Moreover, stripping China of trade benefits would
hurt U.S., Hong Kong and other foreign companies that have
invested heavily in export and export-processing ventures in
China.</p>
<p>Consider the case of Nike Inc. For years, the Oregon-based
sports-shoe maker struggled trying to set up a manufacturing
operation in China. Despite Nike's huge initial investments,
the factories it contracted from couldn't meet production
targets, and a huge percentage of shoes didn't meet Nike's
quality-standards and had to be scrapped. "In the early
stages, we did a study that showed it was costing us
practically $100,000 per finished pair," says Richard
Willing, production director for China.</p>
<p>But Nike's patience has paid off. Its five factories in
south China are now making 650,000 pairs a month, and Nike
hopes to export $100 million of shoes from China next year.
Moreover, the China operation has just started turning a
profit. "We're making money, but it's taken 10 years to get
there," says Mr. Willing.</p>
<p>The debate over China's trade status shows how fragile
Nike's hard-won success is. If Congress surprises everyone
and denies China beneficial trade terms, Nike's business here
would be threatened. Tariffs on some shoes would rise to 33%
from the current 13%, making it unprofitable to continue
producing in China.</p>
<p>Like other manufacturers, Nike has a contingency plan
that, if the U.S. ultimately denies China favored trade
status, would shift much of the company's China operation to
Indonesia and Thailand. Many of the 8,000 Chinese employed
making Nike shoes would simply be out of work.</p>
<p>China's exports to the U.S. last year totaled $11.99
billion, up 43% from a year earlier. Despite talk of
sanctions, exports this year are still booming. In the first
two months, China's exports to the U.S. jumped 35%. Most of
the goods are transshipped through Hong Kong, whose companies
also would stand to lose heavily if the U.S. takes away
China's trade benefits.</p>
<p>Nanhai Pingxi's Mr. Chen, whose factory produces Adidas,
has already been burned once by adverse international
reaction to last year's massacre in Beijing. Prior to the
June 4 killings, his sole client was Reebok International
Ltd. But the U.S. company decided suddenly last summer to
pull out of its contract, citing "some garbage about human
rights," Mr. Chen says.</p>
<p>Reebok's shift saddled the factory with a loss of
$500,000, he says, adding that his company still doesn't know
what to do with the material for 170,000 pairs of Reeboks it
imported last year. The factory avoided financial catastrophe
at the end of last year, when it won an order to become a
regular supplier of Adidas.</p>
<p>"If the U.S. changes its trade policy, we'll be hit again"
says Mr. Chen. "When that happens, I might just shut the
factory down and raise mice."</p>
