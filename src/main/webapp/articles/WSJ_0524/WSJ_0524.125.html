	<p class="article-leader">CANBERRA, Australia -- The Australian government said it
won't approve a proposed merger of Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ) with National Mutual Life
Association of Australasia Ltd.
   The proposed merger, announced in April, would have
created the biggest financial concern in Australia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Paul Keating, Australia's treasurer, said the merger would
be "contrary to the national interest and shouldn't proceed."</p>
<p>ANZ is one of Australia's four biggest banks, while
National Mutual is the second-largest life-insurance company.
Therefore, Mr. Keating said, a merger "carries substantial
implications for the future structure and direction of the
financial system in this country."</p>
<p>He said Australia needs effective competition in banking,
life insurance and financial services in general.</p>
