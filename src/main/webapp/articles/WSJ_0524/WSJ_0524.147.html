	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Dun & Bradstreet Corp. said it put up for sale
most of its Donnelley Marketing division, continuing its
policy of shedding nonstrategic businesses.
   Donnelley Marketing is a leading direct-mail distributor
of cents-off coupons and consumer merchandise, and also
provides mailing lists and mailing services. D&B said the
only other segment of Donnelley Marketing -- Donnelley
Marketing Information Services, which markets demographic
information -- isn't for sale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Without the information-services segment, D&B said,
Donnelley Marketing had 1989 revenue of about $225 million,
or 5.2% of D&B's total revenue. The financial-information
services giant said Donnelley Marketing is profitable, but
wouldn't give any further details.</p>
<p>D&B also refused to disclose the price it expects to get
for most of Donnelley Marketing, but one analyst said it will
likely fetch in excess of $200 million. Industry insiders
speculated that the price could go as high as $400 million or
$500 million.</p>
<p>The sale decision fits into D&B's recent policy of selling
businesses that don't fit into its overall strategy. In
recent months, D&B has announced plans to sell five such
units: Datastream International, Interactive Data, Neodata
Services, Petroleum Information and Zytron. D&B has retained
investment bank Goldman, Sachs & Co. to facilitate the sales.</p>
<p>D&B is focusing on information services for three areas:
risk management, marketing, and yellow-pages directories; and
on software for business applications.</p>
<p>Joseph Laird, an analyst who follows D&B for Veronis,
Suhler & Associates Inc., said the sale made sense. "The part
that they're shedding is emphatically not an information
business, while the part that they're keeping is," he said.
"It's a perfectly understandable decision."</p>
