	<p class="article-leader">NEW ORLEANS -- Rolm Co. said it will enable its telephone
switches to communicate with Digital Equipment Corp.'s VAX
computers, strengthening a recent trend toward cooperation
between switch and computer makers.
   Rolm, a Norwalk, Conn., joint venture of International
Business Machines Corp. of Armonk, N.Y., and Siemens AG of
West Germany, made the announcement at a trade conference
here. Earlier this month, IBM got the cooperation trend going
when it said it would let its computers "talk" to telephone
switches made by Rolm, Siemens, American Telephone &
Telegraph Co., and the Northern Telecom Inc. unit of BCE Inc.</p>

to appear on a computer screen as soon as a call is made,
enabling better customer service and opening up new marketing
opportunities.</p>
