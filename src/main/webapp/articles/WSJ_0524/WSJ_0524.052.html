	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush is taking a tough stance
toward current world trade negotiations, insisting that the
talks lead to a broad agreement that includes fundamental
change in agricultural trade.
   "Let me be blunt: to the United States, (having) no
agreement is better than a bad agreement," Mr. Bush said in a
short address at the White House mainly devoted to the talks.
The negotiations are being held under the international
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The president termed
the negotiations, known as the Uruguay Round because they
began in that country in 1986, "the last, best chance for the
world to enter the next century with free and fair trade for
all."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By saying that the U.S. will accept only a broad
agreement, Mr. Bush is raising the stakes in the talks, which
are scheduled for completion at the end of this year. There
has been speculation that the U.S. would settle for a modest
trade accord.</p>
<p>In the talks, the U.S. and almost 100 other nations are
seeking to improve international trade rules. The president
reiterated that his "top trade priority for this year is an
ambitious, multilateral agreement" in the negotiations. If
successful, such an accord could extend GATT rules to cover
trade in goods and services valued at more than a trillion
dollars. Current GATT rules are estimated to cover as much as
two-thirds of world trade, which in 1988 totaled $3.5
trillion, according to a Bush administration trade economist.</p>
<p>The president laid out six main U.S. goals in the talks,
including, first, to have nations remove trade barriers and
subsidies in agriculture. "There simply cannot be a
successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round without
fundamental agricultural reform," Mr. Bush said.</p>
<p>The other goals include: removing tariffs, cutting
government subsidies to exporters, fully integrating
developing countries into the GATT system (currently, they
can seek exemption from some trade rules), developing rules
for such areas of trade as services, investment and
intellectual property; and devising swifter and more
effective means of resolving trade disputes.</p>
<p>GATT's director general, Arthur Dunkel, is visiting
Washington this week to drum up U.S. support for the Uruguay
Round. In a meeting with reporters yesterday, he said that a
successful GATT round would "consolidate" the world economy
by ensuring that nations trade on the basis of market
principles. A failed round, he said, would represent a return
to "the history of the inter-war period," when trade was done
"on the basis of strategic alliances."</p>
<p>Mr. Dunkel said he expects the 15 negotiating groups
tackling different aspects of international trade to have
outlines of proposed agreements by July. He said, "July is
the moment of truth."</p>
<p>Despite concerns about the slow pace of the GATT talks,
Mr. Dunkel said, recent meetings of trade ministers provided
"strong confirmation" that there's a broad commitment to
completing the talks by the December deadline.</p>
<p>The U.S., for its part, is "driving at full speed to
complete the round," Mr. Bush said in his address. But at the
same time, he noted, the U.S. is pursuing a range of other
trade initiatives, including "market-opening negotiations
with Japan," bilateral trade agreements with Canada and
Mexico and a dialogue with the Pacific Rim nations. He also
said Washington is striving to ensure the U.S. will have
access to Western Europe after countries there form an
integrated market in 1992.</p>
