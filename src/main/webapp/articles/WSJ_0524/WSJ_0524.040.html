	<p class="article-leader">A new marketing trend is turning a dispute between
Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp. and its franchisees into a
bitter fight.
   Kentucky Fried Chicken says its marketing idea is simple:
If a customer won't come to your restaurant, then take the
restaurant to the customer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The franchiser is considering placing outlets in two
Sears, Roebuck & Co. stores, and has held preliminary
discussions about similar ventures with other retailers as
well as with supermarkets. But some angry franchisees think
the simple idea could steal big business from their
stand-alone outlets.</p>
<p>The board of the Association of Kentucky Fried Chicken
Franchisees, representing some 3,000 of the 3,600 franchised
outlets, recently voted to proceed with a lawsuit against the
parent company. Last November, the franchisees filed the suit
in federal court in Louisville, Ky., but held off serving the
company with the suit pending negotiations over the dispute.</p>
<p>The litigation seeks to block a new franchise contract
that, some restaurant operators say, threatens their very
existence. Kentucky Fried Chicken, meanwhile, which has been
moving aggressively to modernize the chain and improve its
lackluster performance, says it has no intention of backing
down on its major demands.</p>
<p>The battle highlights the continuing confrontation at many
older franchise systems between the parent company, which
often wants to overhaul and upgrade operations, and
franchisees, who sometimes resist attempts to tamper with
what they regard as a proven formula.</p>
<p>The stakes are high in the restaurant industry, where
everyone from McDonald's to the corner pizzeria is scrambling
for customers. Sales at fast-food outlets are expected to
rise only 3% this year, according to the National Restaurant
Association, a trade group. That's about in line with 1989
figures, which themselves were the worst since 1980.</p>
<p>Kentucky Fried Chicken, which was bought by PepsiCo Inc.
in 1986, is one of the nation's oldest fast-food chains and
has been the most anemic member of Pepsi's otherwise healthy
restaurant group, which includes Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
Kentucky Fried Chicken's president and chief executive
officer, John M. Cranor III, says the provisions in the new
contract would allow the company to compete effectively in
the fast-food business well into the next century. Some
franchisees, however, question whether those same provisions
will put them out of business before the next century
arrives.</p>
<p>At the heart of the controversy are moves by Kentucky
Fried Chicken and other fast-food chains to place outlets in
so-called nontraditional sites. With thousands of restaurants
already lining the streets of most towns and cities,
companies are looking at other locations, such as airports,
amusement parks and athletic stadiums, as future sites for
expansion.</p>
<p>Kentucky Fried Chicken, for example, is working with
Cattleguard Inc., a Houston company that provides
food-service operations to several Sears stores, to test
chicken outlets in two of those stores.</p>
<p>Such nontraditional sites are "where the industry is
evolving," says Michael G. Mueller, a restaurant analyst at
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "You can have a small
unit and still do a lot of business."</p>
<p>That business, however, may come out of the cash registers
of existing outlets, say some Kentucky Fried Chicken
franchisees. John R. Neal, who operates 85 Kentucky Fried
Chicken outlets in the Southeast, says the franchisees are
particularly concerned about so-called institutional barriers
that the company might erect that would hurt their
businesses.</p>
<p>Some airports, for instance, have contracts with companies
such as Marriott Corp. that provide for Marriott to be the
sole provider and franchiser of food services for the
airport. Such a contract establishes an "institutional
barrier" to other food companies that might want to set up
shop. What's to stop Kentucky Fried Chicken, Mr. Neal asks,
from setting up similar contracts with, say, supermarkets, in
which Kentucky Fried Chicken alone -- and not the franchisee
across the street -- would have the exclusive right to
provide Kentucky Fried Chicken to those stores?</p>
<p>"When I'm trying to sell a bucket of chicken for $15.95,
how in the dickens can I compete with a Kroger that's selling
the same bucket of chicken for $9.99?" asks Mr. Neal,
pointing to the grocer's lower fixed costs. "That would be
devastating."</p>
<p>Kentucky Fried Chicken says it is prepared to pay a 2%
"pass-through" royalty to franchisees that find themselves
competing with other Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets in their
own backyards. But Robert Peck, president of the franchise
association, questions the value of such payments. "If a
supermarket sells $200,000 {of Kentucky Fried Chicken
products} in a year, I get $4,000," he says. "But the
supermarket might cannibalize $100,000 to $150,000 of my
sales and put me to the point where I can't be a profitable
operation."</p>
<p>The franchisees acknowledge that the company must search
for new ways to expand. And Kentucky Fried Chicken's new
management team under Mr. Cranor (he arrived in August 1989)
already has made progress in turning the embattled chain
around. In the first quarter, operating profits were up 37%
-- the same rate of growth as Pizza Hut.</p>
<p>"It could get very ugly, but I think cooler heads will
prevail," says Mr. Neal, the franchisee. "The enemy is not
{Kentucky Fried Chicken}. It's the other restaurants out
there on the strip."</p>
