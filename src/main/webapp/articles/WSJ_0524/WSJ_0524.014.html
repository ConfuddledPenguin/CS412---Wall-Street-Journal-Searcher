	<p class="article-leader">Surplus Social Security revenues are now accumulating in
the trust fund at the rate of $50 billion a year, rising to
$100 billion in 1993, $150 billion in 1997 and $200 billion
in 2000. In the next five years the surplus will reach $500
billion. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D., N.Y.) says, let's
reduce the Social Security tax and stop stealing wholesale
from the trust fund to mask the budget deficit. Sen. Ernest
F. Hollings (D., S.C.) calls this $500 billion grab "the
grandest larceny in history."
   Prof. Martin Feldstein (editorial page, April 25)
identifies the key question, namely whether the accumulation
of surpluses in the trust fund actually increases national
saving and capital formation. He then answers the question in
the affirmative -- by a leap of faith -- and berates the
Moynihan proposal for reducing the saving rate. But as
pointed out in his essay, it all depends on the assumptions
made about spending and taxes, and whether cutting the Social
Security tax would force an increase in the budget deficit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>There could be a way to please those who want to reduce
the regressive Social Security tax and those who want to
lower government spending -- while keeping the deficit from
growing and Gramm-Rudman-Hollings intact. Most immediately,
it has to do with the "global political warming," which may
yet yield a "peace dividend" in the form of substantial cuts
in the defense budget. Of course, most every member of
Congress already has plans to spend this money on his pet
project; but a dividend should be paid out to shareholders:
i.e., to the taxpayers. This is the essence of Sen. William
Roth's (R., Del.) tax-cut proposal for lower- and
middle-income taxpayers. But with fierce opposition from
Democratic leaders in both chambers, and absence of White
House support, the Roth proposal may meet the same fate as an
earlier tax-cut proposal by Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas).
Therefore, why not link the Moynihan Social Security tax cut,
on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to defense cuts -- before
someone makes off with the dividend? This scheme would keep
the deficit from growing and meet the objectives of the Roth
bill.</p>
<p>Who knows? After the peace dividend, the "food dividend"
could come next -- if we can get Congress to cut agricultural
subsidies. Pat Moynihan may be onto something.</p>
