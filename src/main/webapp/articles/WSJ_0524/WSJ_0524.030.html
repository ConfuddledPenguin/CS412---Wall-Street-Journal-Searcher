	<p class="article-leader">Doctors ordered significantly fewer medical tests when
made aware of the test costs, according to a study that
supports the growing belief that doctors overuse diagnostic
procedures.
   In an experiment at Indiana University School of Medicine
in Indianapolis, doctors who were alerted about test prices
ordered 14% fewer tests and generated bills that were 13%
lower than similar doctors for whom test charges weren't
flagged. The study also found that the reduced tests didn't
dilute the quality of care provided.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The study, published in this week's New England Journal of
Medicine, provides some of the strongest evidence to date
that many medical tests ordered by doctors are unnecessary
and that doctors generally aren't knowledgeable about their
costs.</p>
<p>Some studies estimate that diagnostic procedures, from
relatively inexpensive laboratory analyses of blood and urine
to high-technology imaging tests that can run hundreds of
dollars each, account for about one-quarter of the nation's
$600 billion-a-year health bill. In recent years, the use of
diagnostic testing has soared, as doctors practice "defensive
medicine" to avoid malpractice suits.</p>
<p>"There is a tradition in medicine dating back to when
little could be done for patients that you do as much as
possible, no matter what the cost," said Clement McDonald, an
internist who co-authored the study with William Tierney and
Michael Miller. "That's no longer true, especially now that
things cost so much. But doctors are given little help in
making choices about care."</p>
<p>In the study, Dr. McDonald and his colleagues suggested a
way to help doctors cut back their reliance on tests. In the
experiment, 121 doctors who staffed Regenstrief Health
Center, an outpatient clinic associated with the university,
were divided into two groups. All doctors at the center order
tests via a computer workstation. But, for one group, the
price of a test flashed on the computer screen when the test
was ordered, while no price was posted for the others.</p>
<p>In a 14-week period prior to the experiment -- when prices
weren't listed for either group -- the doctors ordered tests
at about the same rate. But during a 26-week period, the
group of doctors who could see the charges on the computer
screen decreased the tests' use. These doctors also generated
average test charges for each patient totaling about $7 less
than test charges produced by the other doctors.</p>
<p>The study's authors said the reduction in tests, if
continued for a year at the same rate, would have saved the
health center $250,000.</p>
<p>The researchers found that prior to the study, doctors
queried about test prices were wrong about 44% of the time.
Even those doctors alerted to test prices during the
experiment were unable to remember the prices about 42% of
the time when asked about them in a follow-up interview.
Indeed, the doctors who reduced their testing during the
experiment reverted to their previous high-use behavior when
test prices no longer were listed on their computer screens.</p>
<p>"It appears that physicians may need to be continually
reminded of the charges for tests if they are to maintain
their cost consciousness," the authors wrote.</p>
<p>Dr. McDonald said the researchers are now conducting a
broader experiment in which doctors are advised through a
computer screen about charges and other outcomes associated
with all sorts of procedures and orders they made for
hospitalized patients.</p>
