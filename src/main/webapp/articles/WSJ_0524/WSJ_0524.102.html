	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Plunging gold prices and a flurry of
foreign-investor purchases helped drive bond prices higher in
volatile trading activity.
   "It was a seesaw session," said William Sullivan, a
money-market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. "Each
time the market ran toward the higher end of the range,
sellers came in to take profits and knocked the market
lower," he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, for example, moved
in a wide one-point range yesterday, rising as much as 5/8
point and falling nearly 1/4 point. The bond ended 3/8 point
higher, a gain of $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>Traders on Wall Street said bond prices spurted in early
trading as investors in Saudi Arabia dumped gold and used the
proceeds to buy intermediate-term Treasury notes. On the New
York Commodity Exchange, the June gold futures contract fell
by $15 an ounce, but ended $11.80 lower at $364.60. Other
commodity prices also declined.</p>
<p>Cash also flowed into the U.S. Treasury market from
Canada. Some investors have grown jittery over the Canadian
government's inability to settle a dispute with
French-speaking Quebec, which wants to be recognized as a
"distinct society" within Canada.</p>
<p>During times of political uncertainty, some investors sell
other types of securities and buy U.S. Treasury bonds, which
are considered the safest in the world. This so-called
"flight-to-quality" investing has exacerbated the Canadian
bond market's problems.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Canadian bonds had their worst rout in recent
memory, with some issues falling more than two points. But
the Canadian market recovered slightly yesterday, with
intermediate-term issues ending about 1/2 point higher and
long-term bonds ending nearly one point higher.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told Congress
that cost of the savings-and-loan bailout is soaring. He now
estimates the cost of the bailout could reach $130 billion,
up considerably from earlier estimates. The news was expected
to hit the market hard, because the Treasury will likely have
to borrow the bailout funds in the bond market. The added
supply could put upward pressure on interest rates.</p>
<p>Fears of higher rates, however, were offset by comments
made by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan.
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Mr. Greenspan
said the overall effect of thrift rescue borrowings on
interest rates is "very moderate" and not of great concern to
him.</p>
<p>Dealers said that trading was extremely active yesterday,
which is unusual considering the Treasury was set to auction
two-year notes. Typically, trading activity is quiet on
auction days, in part because surprises at the auction have
the potential to roil the financial markets.</p>
<p>Yesterday's auction, however, was fairly routine. The
Treasury sold $10.88 billion of two-year notes at an average
yield of 8.52%. In when-issued trading activity, the yield on
the notes fell to 8.49%, a sign the notes continued to draw
good demand after the auction was completed.</p>
<p>As expected, individual investors had a healthy appetite
for the new notes. Small investors typically purchase at
Treasury auctions through noncompetitive tenders, which
yesterday totaled $1.67 billion.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>After a steady climb all week, the junk bond market took a
breather yesterday.</p>
<p>Prices of most junk bonds, speculative-grade bonds with
low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended
unchanged to slightly weaker.</p>
<p>Among the go-go junk bonds, or actively traded,
better-quality names, that showed signs of fatigue this
session were Duracell Holdings Corp.'s 13.5% subordinated
debentures which slipped 1/4 point to end at 103 1/4.</p>
<p>Also falling back were junk bonds of Kroger Co. and
Safeway Inc. Kroger's 13 1/8% subordinated debentures,
maturing in 2001, slipped 1/8 point to end at 103 5/8 while
Safeway's 12% subordinated debentures, maturing in 1998, lost
1/4 point to end at 100 1/2.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury notes and bonds ended higher yesterday, after a
volatile trading session.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
101 27/32 to yield 8.57% compared with 101 15/32 to yield
8.60%. The latest 10-year notes ended at a price of 101 27/32
to yield 8.58% compared with 101 15/32 to yield 8.63%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates moved lower yesterday. The discount rate
on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.65% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.89% compared with a discount rate
of 7.74% for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.98% on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.</p>
<p>Applications ...............  $37,565,980,000</p>
<p>Accepted bids ..............  $10,883,045,000</p>
<p>Accepted at low price ......              10%</p>
<p>Accepted noncompetitively ..   $1,665,000,000</p>
<p>Average price (Rate) .......   99.964 (8.52%)</p>
<p>High price (Rate)  .........   99.982 (8.51%)</p>
<p>Low price (Rate)  ..........   99.946 (8.53%)</p>
<p>Interest rate  .............           8 1/2%</p>
<p>The notes are dated May 31 and mature May 31, 1992.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Gains of about 3/8 point were registered by most mortgage
securities.</p>
<p>But some traders said that activity in premium coupon
issues, which posted advances of less than 1/4 point, was
slim.</p>
<p>Activity in that sector was impeded by Tuesday's Public
Securities Association announcement that it will impose
trading curbs on certain high-coupon mortgage issues, mainly
Government National Mortgage Association pass-through
securities, which will be aimed at stopping issuance of
high-coupon mortgages that have experienced rapid prepayment
rates.</p>
<p>The PSA seeks to end a pattern in which high-coupon issues
are being offered and then quickly refinanced. Investors who
have been paying premiums of as much as eight or nine points
for the issues are finding these securities being paid off
much more rapidly than expected, which sharply reduces the
value of their purchase. Most of the affected securities were
issued in the past 1 1/2 years.</p>
<p>Active mortgage securities matched gains in 10-year
Treasury notes, keeping spreads stable.</p>
<p>Ginnie Mae 9% issues, at 8.72%, were trading at a 1.12
percentage-point spread over Treasurys. Late Tuesday, the
spread was quoted around the same level.</p>
<p>Municipals</p>
<p>Municipal bonds ended basically unchanged in quiet
dealings, with issues showing gains of 1/8 to 3/8 point in
spots.</p>
<p>Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issue of 2018 was virtually unchanged at 97
7/8 to yield 7.36%.</p>
<p>No large municipal issues are expected to be priced today.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>British government bonds, called gilts, ended lower on a
larger-than-expected U.K. trade deficit in April.</p>
<p>But because significant support was seen around the day's
lows, some traders believe the rally that began in gilts late
last month may not be over.</p>
<p>Among benchmarks, the 11.75% bonds due in 2003/2007 were
down 3/4 of a point at 100 13/32 to yield 11.67% while the
12% notes due 1995 were off 9/32 at 99 5/32 to yield 12.21%.</p>
