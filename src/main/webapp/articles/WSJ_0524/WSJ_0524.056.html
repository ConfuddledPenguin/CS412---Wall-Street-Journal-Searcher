	<p class="article-leader">INDIANAPOLIS -- The big-name drivers in this weekend's
Indianapolis 500 get big-time money from big-league sponsors
like Marlboro and Budweiser. Then there's Tony Bettenhausen.
   He will sport one sticker for the Union Jack Pub, which
agreed to provide lunches for his crew, and two for Ping,
which gave him a set of golf clubs. His main sponsor is Amax
Inc., a coal and metals company that not only got its name on
his car, but a pile of coal prominently displayed in his
racing garage.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bettenhausen, a balding 38-year-old, is unlikely to
win Sunday, but thanks to a lot of aggressive salesmanship,
at least he will have the thrill of competing in the world's
most famous motor race. It wasn't easy. The first heat in the
Indy 500 is the race for sponsorship money, and even before
turning a lap in his No. 16 fluorescent red and white Lola
racer, Mr. Bettenhausen had to spend nearly a year scraping
together $400,000 to finance his effort. No angle went
untried: At one point, his wife, Shirley, appeared in an ad
for Kroger supermarkets for $1 and some steaks.</p>
<p>There has always been a disparity between the top cats and
the underdogs in racing, but the gulf has widened as more
money has flowed into the sport. Everyone wants to back the
winner, so the elite teams get a disproportionate share while
middle-of-the-pack mavericks like Mr. Bettenhausen struggle
to get by. One top team, Penske Racing Inc., which will spend
up to $3 million on each of its entries, recently signed a
two-year, $30 million deal with Philip Morris to promote
Marlboro. "It's a brutal deal," says Mr. Bettenhausen.
"People will go to your sponsor and ask, `Why are you funding
that loser?'"</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Bettenhausen's David vs. Goliath struggles have
made him something of a local hero here in his hometown.
"He's our version of Rocky," says Tom Binford, the official
race steward and a former chairman of Indiana National Bank,
during an advertising club luncheon in Mr. Bettenhausen's
honor.</p>
<p>Mr. Bettenhausen comes from an oldline,
chew-nails-and-spit-rust auto racing family. His father was a
legendary driver who started taking young Tony to
Indianapolis at age six. A few years later, Melvin Eugene
"Tony" Bettenhausen was killed on the main straightaway while
testing a race car for a friend. A brother-in-law also died
in a crash, and Tony's brother, Merle, lost an arm. In 1987,
a tire flew off Tony's car and killed an Indy spectator.
Another brother, Gary, has only partial use of his left arm
because of an accident, but he will also start the race.
Their mother, Valerie, refuses to watch the race, even on
television.</p>
<p>"Would the Bettenhausens like to get even with this track?
The answer is yes," says Tony. "I plan to keep trying until I
can't pay my bills anymore."</p>
<p>Though he has been racing actively since 1972, Mr.
Bettenhausen has never won a major event. His best finish in
eight tries at Indianapolis was seventh. Other drivers say he
has talent, but has never been able to afford a fully
competitive set of wheels. The conventional wisdom is that
the driver accounts for about 15% of the outcome of an Indy
race; the car, 85%.</p>
<p>Last year, he didn't even make the race. His Cosworth
engine turned out to be a dud, and he missed qualifying by
one-half mile an hour. On race day, when the band began
playing the traditional "Back Home Again in Indiana," he
burst into tears and left the grandstand.</p>
<p>After missing that race, Mr. Bettenhausen's main backer at
the time -- Federal Truck Driving School in Indianapolis --
said it didn't want to pay for another major effort. Over the
years, Mr. Bettenhausen has made numerous overtures to
companies like Coca-Cola, General Foods, Procter & Gamble and
Lever Brothers, but all of them turned him down. So Mr.
Bettenhausen turned to Amax, which employs one of Mr.
Bettenhausen's crew members in an Indiana mine.</p>
<p>Amax agreed to come up with half of the $651,000 that Mr.
Bettenhausen estimated he needed to spend on this year's
race. Three other sponsors chipped in another $90,000. To
help make up for the shortfall, he elected to buy stock-block
engines from Buick, which cost half as much as the $100,000
custom-made Cosworth and Chevrolet motors the top teams are
using. He also bought a one-year-old Lola for $100,000
instead of the $175,000 he hoped to spend on a second-hand
car owned by Penske Racing.</p>
<p>Most of his crew members work without pay. The three
full-time employees make a combined $57,500 a year. Mr.
Bettenhausen himself, in his best year, took home about
$80,000. In leaner years, his earnings have barely exceeded
$30,000 -- for a job that often places him a hairbreadth away
from flaming disaster.</p>
<p>To help make ends meet, he is constantly making deals. He
agreed to let a local radio station put a decal on his car in
return for plugging his sponsors. The decision to put a Ping
golf-club sticker on his car was partly motivated by the hope
that the manufacturer would enjoy seeing its name on
television and give him some money next year.</p>
<p>For Amax, Mr. Bettenhausen agreed not only to emblazon its
logo on his car but also to make personal appearances at
company events. When an ABC-TV crew burst into his garage to
do a segment on a new rule affecting the design of the car,
he quickly slapped two Amax stickers on the part of the racer
they would be filming.</p>
<p>And he worked a deal with speedway officials to get his
trailer truck, with the Amax logo, positioned in front of all
the others in the infield. "Penske Racing has four beautiful
trucks," he says, "but you can't see them because mine is in
the way."</p>
<p>But the bills continue to flood into his small garage on
Gasoline Alley, decorated with Amax banners and the customary
bumper stickers: "The More I Know About Women, the More I
Like About Race Cars" and "Honk If You've Seen Elvis Lately."
On one desk, there's a $6,621.09 invoice for an engine
overhaul, a $390 dry-cleaning bill for his racing suit and
$240 tab for X-rays of racing parts. Mr. Bettenhausen's one
big splurge this year was a new $300 racing helmet with
special vents that keep the air flow from trying to suck it
off his head.</p>
<p>His precarious finances prompt crew members to quip during
a recent dinner about how little he would leave behind if he
was killed in a crash. "You could will me your new golf
clubs," offers crew chief Rick Duman. At the dinner, Mr.
Bettenhausen tells the crew that unless the team finishes
seventh or better in the race, the prize money won't cover
their remaining expenses. "Let's knock on wood that we'll do
well," he says, hitting himself a few times in the head.</p>
<p>In fact, he has already attracted much attention this
year. By skipping other races and practicing here in March
and April, he became one of the few drivers of older cars to
do well this month.</p>
<p>The older models are handicapped by a new rule requiring
something called a diffuser, which restricts the amount of
air flow under the car. New cars are designed to maximize
aerodynamic shape with the diffuser in place, but the older
cars aren't. Many became unstable crates with the diffuser
added. There have been 13 crashes at the speedway this month
as a result.</p>
<p>Mr. Bettenhausen started practicing early enough to figure
out out how to make his car handle well. He certainly
couldn't afford to crash. With enough money for only one car,
a wreck not only would have knocked him out of the race but
also could have bankrupted his company. "One mistake and
we're out of business," he says.</p>
<p>The moment of truth came on May 13, the first day of
qualifying.</p>
<p>Though the speeds he had been posting during practice gave
him confidence he would make the race this year, he couldn't
be certain until he completed his four qualifying laps. Race
cars are so sensitive that even a quarter-turn on an
adjusting screw can make a car lightning fast or slug slow.
Outside temperature and barometric pressure can also affect
performance.</p>
<p>He drove flat out. His average speed was 218.4 miles an
hour, the ninth best for the day and good enough for a
starting position in the fifth row of Sunday's race. When he
returned to the pits, his crew was already celebrating as if
they had won the actual race.</p>
<p>"We beat out a bunch of teams that have
multimillion-dollar budgets," he says. "Maybe Tony
Bettenhausen is finally starting to make his mark."</p>
