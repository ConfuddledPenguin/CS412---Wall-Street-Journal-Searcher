	<p class="article-leader">Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company,
signed an oil exploration and production agreement with the
Soviet Union.
   The agreement, announced in Paris after being signed in
Moscow, provides Elf exploration rights on between 13,500 and
15,500 square miles in the Volga-Caspian region of the Soviet
Union.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Company and Soviet oil officials called it the first such
pact between the Soviet Union and a Western oil partner.
Several U.S. oil companies, including Chevron Corp., have
been negotiating with the Soviets but so far haven't
concluded exploration agreements.</p>
<p>Few details of the Elf-Soviet agreement were disclosed,
and some still must be worked out. But Loik Le Floch-Prigent,
Elf's president, called it a "classic" exploration and
production agreement.</p>
<p>Until recently, the Soviet Union restricted foreign oil
company participation to technical assistance. But the
government now admits its oil industry is having problems and
needs outside assistance. Oil production has been declining,
although the Soviet Union still is the world's largest
producer with output of slightly under 12 million barrels a
day.</p>
