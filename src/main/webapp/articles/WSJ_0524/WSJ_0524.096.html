	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. agreed with
the Soviet Ministry of Communications to explore joint
ventures in telecommunications services, equipment
manufacturing, and research and development.
   AT&T said it will send scientists from AT&T Bell
Laboratories to Moscow later this year to discuss projects
ranging from digital switching technology to satellite
networks aimed at upgrading the Soviet Union's rickety phone
system.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>News of the agreement, signed quietly earlier this month,
surfaced in CommunicationsWeek International, an industry
newspaper. Last December, AT&T agreed to use the U.S.S.R.'s
Intersputnik satellite network for the first time to handle
communications traffic between the U.S. and the Soviet Union,
a proposal the State Department has asked the Federal
Communications Commission to reject.</p>
<p>AT&T also is seeking to supply fiberoptic cable and
transmission equipment to one of Moscow's biggest
telecommunications projects, planned construction of an
8,680-mile, $500 million cable linking Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>In serving technology-starved Eastern Europe, AT&T Network
Systems International recently received a contract to supply
digital switching equipment to Poland to handle international
phone traffic. Yesterday, AT&T Bell Labs said 10 of Poland's
top telecommunications engineers will visit Bell Labs as part
of a free training program sponsored by the U.S.
Telecommunications Training Institute, also hosted by
BellSouth Corp., Digital Equipment Corp. and MCI
Communications Corp., AT&T said.</p>
