	<p class="article-leader">MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan -- This may be one of the world's
sleepiest capitals. It is the principal city of
Pakistan-controlled Azad, or Free, Kashmir. The picturesque
Kashmir of tourist brochures is the one India controls across
the heavily guarded border.
   But Muzaffarabad is having a small boom because of the
tension between India and Pakistan. Tourists, scared by the
violence in India's Kashmir, are coming here. And foreign
reporters, thrown out of India's Kashmir in January, are
flocking to Pakistan's portion to meet Kashmiri militants and
refugees from the south.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Kashmir is a kind of looking-glass place: two areas
bearing similar names but controlled by two countries that
view things conversely and whose armies glare at each other
with identical postures of outrage. It is one of the world's
most dangerous flash points.</p>
<p>India's Prime Minister Vishwanath Pratap Singh has told
his people to be "psychologically prepared" for war.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has threatened a war
of 1,000 years.</p>
<p>It is a potential nightmare for the whole globe. A war on
the subcontinent could go nuclear: India exploded its first
nuclear device in 1974; Pakistan is believed to have nuclear
weapons, too. Even conventional conflict could be brutal as
the animosity between the two countries has been stoked to
boiling point by historical passions and thorny current
problems.</p>
<p>"There has been a steady escalation in tension and
preparation on both sides," says a diplomat in New Delhi. "We
have a great worry that they're going to get into a war that
neither side wants." The U.S. and the Soviet Union have made
it clear that the support they provided in the past -- the
U.S. on Pakistan's side, the Soviet Union on India's -- won't
be forthcoming this time.</p>
<p>"Kashmir is a motherhood issue," says a diplomat in
Pakistan. "War could happen tomorrow. It could happen next
month. It could never happen." Says Zain Noorani, former
Pakistan foreign minister: "When you raise the war tempo to a
certain extent, anything can happen."</p>
<p>India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir, in
1947 and 1965. The territory remains split along the
cease-fire line of 1965 (with alterations made after the
India-Pakistan war of 1971). A former princely state, Kashmir
was given a choice in 1947 to choose union with India, an
avowedly secular democracy, or Pakistan, which was founded in
the name of Islam. The maharajah of Kashmir, a Hindu leader
of a Moslem-majority population, equivocated until
Pakistan-backed troops invaded. He acceded to India.</p>
<p>India considers this the supreme justification of the
secular state. So, along with its post-1947 terror of further
"mini-partitions," India is determined to maintain Kashmir.</p>
<p>To Pakistan, Kashmir's accession to India was a betrayal
of Moslems by the Hindu maharajah and a violation of the
terms of partition that created an independent India and
Pakistan out of British India. Pakistan's long-term pledge:
liberation of the six million Kashmiris in India's Kashmir.</p>
<p>India's tack was to incorporate Jammu and Kashmir state
into its democratic political system, with special
constitutional provisions of autonomy. Jammu is a
Hindu-majority territory adjacent to Kashmir. But politics
proved the undoing of India's Kashmir policy.</p>
<p>In 1984, then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi forced an
alliance between Kashmir's main political force, the National
Conference, and her Congress (I) Party. Kashmiris considered
it a sellout by the National Conference. Corruption spread, a
state-assembly election in 1987 was rigged, and almost
overnight, Kashmir's biggest political force collapsed. The
power vacuum was quickly filled by militants pressing for
independence.</p>
<p>Last May, the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, or JKLF,
the largest of as many as 26 groups, shut down the state in a
strike. Demonstrations and kidnappings by militants led to an
army crackdown in December that continues today. A hard-line
governor was brought in from New Delhi, and he dismissed the
elected state government in February. Foreign correspondents
were thrown out. Round-the-clock curfews made Kashmiris
prisoners in their homes for weeks.</p>
<p>Indian journalists and foreign reporters who have made
surreptitious visits say India's Kashmir is under military
siege. Tourism, the largest industry, is dead. Violent army
raids against militants are frequent. The number of
casualties is hard to determine. The anti-Indian Kashmiri
militants claim that several thousand of their number have
been killed and more than 8,000 arrested. Anti-India
sentiment is raging.</p>
<p>"Morally, India has lost Kashmir," says Shafiz Misgar, the
28-year-old leader of the JKLF's political wing. Mr. Misgar
is now in Free Kashmir, which he calls the "base camp" for
the freedom movement. He talks of friends beaten and
terrorized, of Kashmiri martyrs shot down by the Indian army.
He and his friends say there will be no peace in Kashmir
until they are allowed to vote for independence.</p>
<p>"This isn't a territorial dispute," insists Raja Muzaffar
Khan, JKLF spokesman in Free Kashmir. "The tension in this
region cannot be defused until we are given the right of
self-determination."</p>
<p>India vehemently disagrees, and the world has accepted its
stand that Kashmir is an Indian problem, or at most a
bilateral one. India applies the label Islamic fundamentalist
to the Kashmiri militants in the hope of alienating Western
countries from the militants' cause.</p>
<p>India also contends that Pakistan started the crisis by
training and arming Kashmiri militants on Pakistan soil.
Although these accusations come from Prime Minister Singh
himself, India has yet to prove them. In a recent interview,
Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral conceded that his government has
no hard evidence.</p>
<p>In Free Kashmir, the rebels complain they get nothing but
moral support from Pakistan. But the rebels concede that
Kashmiris were brought to Afghanistan in the mid-1980s for
training with the anti-Soviet mujahedeen, presumably by the
Pakistani military.</p>
<p>On the big issues -- fundamentalism, independence,
alignment with Pakistan -- Kashmiris on both sides seem
confused. At the very least, burgeoning hatred for India has
made many Kashmiris pro-Pakistan and has boosted Islamic
jingoism.</p>
<p>When the JKLF spokesman leaves the room after stating that
the fight is for Kashmiris' right to self-determination, his
followers let slip some significant remarks. "We hate the
Indian secularism," says one. Another calls for a
"theo-democratic state." A slogan on the wall of a
Muzaffarabad house reads: "Pray five times daily because this
is the only way through which we can get success."</p>
<p>The Indian government's emphasis on Pakistan's alleged
training of militants and the rise of Islamic fundamentalism
in Kashmir has helped boost pro-war sentiments in India --
feelings never far below the surface in a country that has
defeated Pakistan in three wars in 43 years.</p>
<p>In Pakistan, 40% of the people in a February poll said
they believed there was a strong chance of war, the highest
level in a tumultuous decade.</p>
<p>Many military analysts believe that India would defeat
Pakistan in a conventional war of about two weeks. The Indian
military is convinced of its superiority, and there is a
rising feeling that another war could help finish off
Pakistan's military for good. But in Pakistan, local
politicians and journalists say, the military believes it has
gained strength from new equipment and that revenge for
previous defeats is long overdue.</p>
