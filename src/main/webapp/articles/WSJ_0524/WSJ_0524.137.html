	<p class="article-leader">Assets of money-market mutual funds rose for the first
time in eight weeks, although yields remained in the narrow
range of the past four months.
   Investors added $2 billion to taxable money funds,
bringing total assets to $376.7 billion, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. The average seven-day
compound yield of the 427 funds eased to 7.98% from 8% in the
week ended Tuesday. Compound yields assume reinvestment of
dividends.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"As yields on alternative investments dropped last week,
money funds became more attractive," said Brenda Malizia
Negus, editor of the Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter.</p>
<p>The average yield on a three-month certificate of deposit
at major banks, for instance, has fallen to 7.56% from 7.63%
two weeks ago, according to Banxquote Money Markets, a New
York information service. Treasury-bill yields turned up a
bit at Monday's auction, to 8% for three-month bills and
8.22% for six-month bills, but they're still lower than a
month ago.</p>
<p>Money-fund yields have been at or just below 8% since late
January.</p>
<p>The average maturity of the funds' investments remained at
44 days for the sixth consecutive week, indicating that a
substantial change in yields isn't likely anytime soon. Money
funds invest in such things as commercial paper (short-term
corporate IOUs), Treasury bills and bank CDs.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the funds slipped to
7.68% from 7.70%. The average 30-day simple yield remained at
7.68%, and the average 30-day compound yield remained at
7.98%.</p>
<p>Assets of tax-free funds also increased, by $403.5
million, Donoghue's reported. This brings the total for the
222 tax-exempt funds tracked by the newsletter to $75.7
billion.</p>
<p>The average seven-day compound yield of the tax-free funds
fell in the latest week, to 5.59% from 5.67%. That's
equivalent to 7.76% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket
and 8.34% for someone paying 33% in taxes. Average maturity
shortened by a day, to 40 days.</p>
