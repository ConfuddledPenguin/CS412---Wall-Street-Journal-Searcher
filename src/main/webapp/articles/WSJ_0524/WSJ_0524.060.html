	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Finance Minister Michael Wilson said Canada's
bitter constitutional debate may have added about 100 basis
points, or one percentage point, to Canadian short-term
interest rates and warned that the political crisis is
scaring off foreign investors.
   Mr. Wilson said he "couldn't put a number" on the impact
of the political debate on short-term rates but didn't
dispute an analyst's estimate of one percentage point.
"Clearly, it's something" like that, Mr. Wilson said.
"Interest rates are somewhat higher than they should be
because" of political uncertainty, he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As reported, a package of constitutional amendments called
the Meech Lake accord must be ratified by all 10 Canadian
provincial legislatures by June 23 or the amendments die. So
far, three provinces are refusing to ratify the accord as
written. The possible failure of the Meech Lake accord has
revived talk of independence in the province of Quebec. The
resignation of a senior federal cabinet minister from Quebec
over the Meech Lake impasse rocked Canadian financial markets
Tuesday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Canadian markets recovered somewhat with the
Canadian dollar closing in Toronto at 84.45 U.S. cents, up
0.30 U.S. cent. The yield on Canadian three-month treasury
bills was practically unchanged in late trading at 13.75%.</p>
<p>"There is an economic element to the Meech Lake debate,"
Mr. Wilson said after a speech here. "I think that it's
important that people realize that this whole Meech Lake
discussion isn't just a constitution or political matter;
it's also an economic matter and it can effect the cost of
money {and} investment decisions," Mr. Wilson said. He added:
"Investment opportunities are being lost by some people
because of the uncertainty."</p>
<p>The government's policy of moderating the rise or fall of
the Canadian unit without setting a target value remains
unchanged, Mr. Wilson said. But he indicated that the
government would move quickly to halt a run on the Canadian
dollar.</p>
<p>"We have a strong reserve position and I think we have
been able to accommodate these {market pressures in the
past, and we'll be able to accommodate any pressures in the
future," he said.</p>
