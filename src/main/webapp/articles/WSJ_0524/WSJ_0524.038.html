	<p class="article-leader">PANAMA CITY, Fla. -- Southern Co.'s beleaguered chief
executive officer, Edward L. Addison, said he had little
knowledge of his son's lucrative ties to the company's
pension fund.
   Mr. Addison, addressing the issue for the first time at
the Atlanta-based utility's annual meeting here, said he is
"truly sorry" about the affair, but insisted he had no role
in steering business to his 30-year-old son.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Speaking to an overflow crowd of more than 800
shareholders, Mr. Addison expressed regret that he couldn't
discuss the pension-fund controversy in detail. "It would
certainly help to express my side of the story . . . and get
rid of some of the pain and suffering to my family, but it is
not the responsible thing to do at this time."</p>
<p>Mr. Addison similarly refused to discuss in detail the
other aspects of a two-year federal grand jury investigation
that is looking into a range of things, from the way in which
the company accounts for spare parts to illegal political
contributions. He cited "respect {for} the privacy of the
grand jury process" as his reason for not commenting on the
inquiry.</p>
<p>Mr. Addison acknowledged that his son, Scott, received
commissions for pension-fund trading activity involving
Southern Co. while a broker at Kidder, Peabody & Co. in
Atlanta, but hastened to distance himself from that
arrangement, insisting, "I know very little of the factual
issues." He added that the "acts were not taken at my
direction."</p>
<p>However, those familiar with the matter have said that the
elder Mr. Addison was told of the proposed arrangement
beforehand and said he would "like to see it done." Southern
Co. has added that the chief executive insisted that the
arrangement be done legally and at competitive costs.</p>
<p>Federal investigators are examining, among other things,
the circumstances under which the younger Mr. Addison
received stock trading commissions from the pension fund,
individuals familiar with the investigation say.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury in Atlanta has subpoenaed records
from a variety of Southern Co.'s pension-fund managers and
has called a number of witnesses to give testimony tied to
the pension-fund relationship. In addition, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation recently joined an investigation by
the U.S. Labor Department's labor-racketeering office of
certain pension-fund transactions, according to the
individuals familiar with the inquiry.</p>
<p>They say federal investigators are also looking at several
of Southern Co.'s vendors that currently conduct some of
their stock trading through the younger Mr. Addison.</p>
<p>Also at the meeting, Mr. Addison said clean-air
legislation pending in Congress would cost Southern $2.5
billion in capital expenditures. He said that cost would
require a roughly 8% rate increase to consumers in the year
2000, the peak year of expenditures.</p>
