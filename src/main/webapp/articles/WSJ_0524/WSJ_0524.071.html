	<p class="article-leader">Few criminal enterprises compare with the scope and
brutality of Latin America's drug barons. They compete for
billions of dollars of profit; their death squads are
responsible for thousands of murders; and they can compromise
and thus destroy the legitimacy of entire governments.
   The most notorious drug cartels can be found in Colombia
and Mexico. Detailed accounts of each are presented in two
new books that transport us right into the belly of the
beast.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The most difficult part of any such account is separating
fact from fiction. Cunning and exaggeration are important
tools of the drug trade, and it's not hard for investigators
to get bamboozled by these hustlers. "Drug Lord: The Life of
a Mexican Kingpin" (Pharos Books, 268 pages, $18.95), by El
Paso Herald reporter Terrence E. Poppa, avoids this hazard
and is the more reliable of the two. Mr. Poppa is a
first-rate journalist who has painstakingly cross-checked the
testimony of convicted dealers, drug agents and police to
document the rise and fall one of the most notorious drug
lords, Pablo Acosta.</p>
<p>Actually a Mexican-born U.S. citizen, Acosta transshipped
Colombian cocaine through his fiefdom in northern Mexico
before his 1987 death in an old-fashioned
"You'll-never-take-me-alive]" shootout with "federales." His
Mexican-U.S. smuggling ring brought 60 tons of Colombian
cocaine a year into the U.S. across the border from Mexico,
where many army garrison commanders provide dealers like
Acosta with logistical support.</p>
<p>Acosta's rise from cheap crook to head of a significant
criminal empire is reminiscent of the film he loved to watch
over and over, "Scarface" in the Al Pacino version. Like
Scarface, Acosta succumbed to the product he peddled --
spending his last days freebasing cocaine 12 to 14 hours a
day, with his drug-induced paranoia finally driving
associates to betray him.</p>
<p>However, though responsible for as many as 20 murders,
Acosta emerges like a gregarious figure from "The Godfather.
He was not without charm and a sense of honor. These
attributes are completely missing from the Colombian drug
lords. There, the stakes are much higher, and so is the
treachery. Acosta bitterly chastized any operatives who hurt
innocent family members, even those of his enemies. But in
the Colombian drug world, the murder of innocents has become
a preferred method of enforcement.</p>
<p>In "The Man Who Made It Snow" (Simon & Schuster, 304
pages, $19.95), drug dealer turned government witness Max
Mermelstein puts a fine point on these horrors: "Colombian
criminals look at a man's family as his weakness," recalls
the author. "They threaten the family first. They warn you
once, maybe twice, then they kill your family, one by one, or
all at the same time, and they do it as easily as snuffing
out a candle."</p>
<p>According to the book jacket, Mr. Mermelstein was "the
American mastermind inside the Colombian cartel." In fact,
his was but one of several major smuggling pipelines from
Colombia into the U.S. But what a pipeline]</p>
<p>From 1981 to the time Mermelstein was arrested in June
1985, he was personally responsible for bringing 56 tons of
cocaine into the U.S. and smuggling $300 million out. He
dealt directly with Medellin cartel leaders Fabio Ochoa,
Pablo Escobar and Rafael "Rafa" Cardona (Mermelstein's mentor
in the drug business). His testimony helped convict half a
dozen drug dons.</p>
<p>Peering into the snake pit that Mr. Mermelstein once
called home is like reading an updated description of
Caligula's court in ancient Rome. The brutality of the
Colombian drug cartel went hand in hand with a life of cheap
materialism: hundred-thousand acre farms with roaming lions,
elephants and giraffes; mansions modeled on Versailles;
Porsches and Mercedes by the dozen; and an adolescent frenzy
for prostitutes and drugs. Unlike most billionaires, the
leaders of the Colombian cartel have made their megamoney in
such a short time that all things -- material and human --
have very little value.</p>
<p>The problem with the book is that Mermelstein is a master
charmer and hustler who also tries to work his hustle on the
reader. This drug dealer, money launderer and accessory to
murder wants us to "understand" his position. There are the
obligatory "I was a bad, bad boy" lines. But the excuses flow
out and we are expected to take on the role of confessor for
a slick crook. Worst are his repeated claims that his
Colombian wife was responsible for getting him in the drug
business. She was, he writes, "in a strange way, the source
of all my problems. When you are married to a Colombian, you
will meet other Colombians, and the other Colombians I met
were all in the dope business."</p>
<p>Still, much of Mermelstein's story is chilling -- and
grippingly told with the assistance of Robin Moore and
Richard Smitten, both seasoned writers on the drug trade.
Mermelstein offers new evidence concerning John DeLorean,
acquitted on drug trafficking charges in 1984. He claims that
his now-dead drug buddy arranged a 20-kilogram cocaine deal
for Mr. DeLorean. He also testifies about Colombian officials
on the cartel payroll, including a senator and a former
commander of the air force.</p>
<p>Until drug exporting countries are able to root out
officials who offer protection to drug dealers like Acosta
and Mermelstein, the drug war is a lost cause.</p>
