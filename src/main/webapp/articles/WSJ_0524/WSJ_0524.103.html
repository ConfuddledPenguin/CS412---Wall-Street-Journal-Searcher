	<p class="article-leader">Michigan's utility commission restricted the ways CMS
Energy Corp. can use $1.5 billion it planned to get after the
sale of Midland Cogeneration Venture assets.
   The order comes after a state court injunction that barred
CMS from transferring the funds. CMS was scheduled to receive
$1.2 billion in notes and $341 million in equity related to
the cogeneration venture from its Consumers Power Co. unit,
in exchange for CMS debentures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CMS stock fell a sharp $2.375 to close at $28.625
yesterday in composite trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.</p>
<p>The commission said in its order that CMS, based in
Dearborn, can use proceeds from the transaction only "in ways
that will secure {Consumers Power's} financial health." The
commission said that may include repaying about $750 million
in Consumers Power bank debt and maintaining a balanced
capital structure for the unit.</p>
<p>CMS called the order "unlawful," particularly the
"attempted assertion over the non-utility, non-jurisdictional
assets of the company." CMS said it will appeal.</p>
