	<p class="article-leader">Honda Motor Co. has quietly adopted a dealer incentive
program to spur sales of some of its Civic cars.
   The move by Honda, which has largely managed to stay out
of the auto industry's widespread price-cutting fray, is the
latest indication of just how tough the U.S. car market is.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales of all cars and trucks, imported and domestic,
during the first four months of this year fell only 2.6%
below 1989 levels, but that's largely because the U.S. Big
Three have been propping up their sales with hefty incentives
averaging roughly $1,000 a vehicle. However, mid-May sales of
domestically built Honda cars in the latest 10-day period
were up 22.4% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Japanese and European auto makers have special lease
programs on many of their more expensive cars. Chrysler Corp.
has even been forced to put incentives on some of its vaunted
minivans for the second time in five months.</p>
<p>The Honda incentive, disclosed to dealers last month but
not announced publicly, is only the third that the company's
Honda division has ever had. The current program, like two
last year, provides cash only to dealers who meet certain
sales goals.</p>
<p>Such a direct-to-dealer program is typical of Japanese car
companies, which prefer dealer incentives over giving money
directly to consumers. The consumer programs traditionally
favored by the U.S. Big Three have been criticized for
hurting the image and resale value of the vehicles involved.</p>
<p>Honda's latest incentive gives dealers between $300 and
$600 for each Civic four-door sedan and station wagon they
sell. These two models accounted for roughly half the 79,067
Civics sold by Honda dealers from January through April.</p>
<p>The incentive program, which runs from April 13 to June
30, "allows us to lower the prices on the cars without the
customer knowing about it," says Roger Paris, general manager
of Plaza Honda in the Brooklyn section of New York City.</p>
<p>Honda, which for a long time appeared nearly impervious to
market downturns because of its popularity, employed dealer
incentives in April and May of 1989 to reverse a
first-quarter decline in total U.S. sales. The year-ago
program covered all Honda models, not just certain Civics.
Sales slid again in June when the incentives expired and
Honda revived its program for July and August.</p>
<p>In the first three months of 1990, Honda sold 56,714
Civics, an 11.5% increase over the same period of 1989. But
in April, Honda apparently discovered its Civic sales were
badly lagging behind those of April 1989, when the auto maker
had dealer incentives in place for the entire month. Even
with the new program, however, Civic sales for all of April
were down nearly 12%.</p>
<p>Since then, Honda dealers report an improvement in sales.
"It's working," says Russ Darrow, who owns a Honda dealership
in Mequon, Wis. "Honda sales are going along quite briskly."</p>
