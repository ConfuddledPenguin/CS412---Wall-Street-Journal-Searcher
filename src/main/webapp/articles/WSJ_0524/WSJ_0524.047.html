	<p class="article-leader">EXECUTIVE PAY IN EUROPE</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Swiss executives make more than their counterparts in
other European countries, a new survey said.</p>
<p>The survey of executive pay at European manufacturing
companies found that, on average, managing directors of
medium-sized Swiss concerns earn the equivalent of $230,475
before taxes and $144,000 after taxes. That's 28% more than
Europe's next best-paid managers, the West Germans; 31% more
than the Italians; and 42% more than the French. And it
dwarfs the lowly British pay rates of 68,500 ($115,970)
pretax and 44,627 net. Other executive pay scales show
similar national trends.</p>
<p>The gaps stem partly from national differences in tax
rates and business climate. But as 1992 approaches, the
differentials are expected to diminish, according to the
study by nine European consulting companies.</p>
<p>Tying executive pay to performance is another trend the
consultants see slowly spreading. In France, West Germany and
Switzerland, 80% to 90% of managing directors get some
compensation in the form of performance bonuses. The British
opt for share options, with 70% of top executives in large
companies participating in such plans.</p>
<p>PINK SLIPS IN EAST GERMANY</p>
<p>More than 100 general directors of East German
state-controlled companies have been relieved of their
duties, the East Berlin Economics Ministry said. The move
implemented a cabinet decision made on May 9. East Germany's
state-controlled conglomerates are being turned into
common-stock companies that will eventually be privatized as
part of the nation's efforts to convert its economy to
free-market principles.</p>
<p>TAIWAN PROTECTS WILDLIFE</p>
<p>Taiwan officials burned more than a ton of confiscated
ivory and 11 lion skins, altogether valued at an estimated
$3.7 million. "The government is determined to implement its
policy to protect wildlife and reverse the nation's
unfavorable image," an official of the Agriculture Council
said. In June, Taiwan passed a law imposing a maximum
three-year prison term for the import or sale of ivory and
wild animals.</p>
<p>YUGOSLAVIAN SHUTDOWN</p>
<p>Yugoslavia's only nuclear-power plant, at Krsko in
Slovenia, will be shut down by 1995, the Slovenian daily
Delor reported. The plant accounts for 20% of the power
generation in Slovenia and about 3% of Yugoslavia's
power-generating potential. The plan to close the plant,
which has been plagued by malfunctioning incidents, was
likely to be cheered by Slovenia's environmentalists, who
have been campaigning for a shutdown, and by neighboring
Austria, whose government repeatedly expressed concern about
the plant's safety.</p>
<p>COCOM EASES RESTRICTIONS</p>
<p>East and West German officials said the 17 member nations
of the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export
Controls, or COCOM, agreed in principle to ease their
restrictions on most technology exports to East Germany.
However, a spokesman for the East German government said
members of COCOM, which was formed to restrict exports of
strategic items to communist-bloc nations, would still want
to maintain controls on weapons and other defense items.</p>
<p>SWITZERLAND TO JOIN AID BANK</p>
<p>The Swiss Federal Council decided Switzerland will join
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The new
institution, which is to have 42 members, will provide funds
to aid the emerging market economies of Eastern Europe.
Switzerland's share of the bank's total capital of 10 billion
European Currency Units ($12.26 billion) will be 2.28%.</p>
<p>TOO RISQUE FOR THE FRENCH</p>
<p>A poster campaign to persuade the French to use more
condoms has been dropped after it was deemed too shocking for
billboards.</p>
<p>A government agency fighting AIDS said the $1.4 million
campaign, to be launched next week, would now appear only in
magazines and newspapers and on television. The prime
minister's office decided the French were not yet ready for
poster-size versions depicting a huge condom accompanied by
messages such as "72% of French people claim to be in love.
How many prove it?"</p>
<p>Condoms "are still a tricky subject in France compared to
other countries," said Dominique Charvet of the
government-backed French Agency to Fight AIDS.</p>
<p>Ms. Charvet concluded: "There's a big difference between
magazines and television screens, which are in the privacy of
people's homes, and big posters splashed around town."</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Soviet troops withdrawing from Czechoslovakia have left
behind environmental damage estimated at more than $125
million, the daily Lidova Demokracie of Prague reported. The
damage includes underground water reserves contaminated by
waste oil that in some places is several yards deep, the
paper said. . . . Arson caused heavy damage to a replica of
Columbus's ship Santa Maria in Barcelona. The tourist
attraction has been occupied several times by Catalan
separatists, who oppose celebrations planned for 1992 to
observe the 500th anniversary of Columbus's discovery of
America.</p>
