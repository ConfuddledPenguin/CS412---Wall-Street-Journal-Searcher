	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The discovery of a new way to manufacture
high-temperature superconductors at the University of Houston
increases the likelihood of widespread commercial use of the
materials, according to scientists.
   The Houston researchers, reporting in the British journal
Nature, said they devised a continuous process for making
rods of the superconducting material. Their first product,
which has some flaws, is small -- a slender rod about the
size of an artist's charcoal drawing stick. But other
superconductor researchers in the U.S. and Britain called it
a significant advance.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It looks like a major step forward," said researcher
George Peterson of American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s Bell
Laboratories. A Nature commentary said it "brings practical
applications for {high-temperature} superconductors closer to
realization." In particular, specialists said, the Houston
process may lead to more sensitive radio receivers and
transmitters.</p>
<p>Superconductors are rare materials that can conduct
electricity without the energy-wasting resistance of copper
and other common electrical materials. Most superconductors
need costly deep-chilling in liquid helium to work, but in
1987 scientists discovered a new family of so-called
high-temperature superconductors that need less chilling and
could have wide commercial uses. A few specialized
applications are already starting to appear, but widespread
use has been held up by a series of difficult scientific
problems.</p>
<p>The Houston team, which includes C.W. Paul Chu, one of the
pioneers of superconductor research, reported an advance
towards solving one of these problems. Although scientists
have been able to make thin superconducting films, useful in
microelectronics, they have had trouble fashioning the
materials into long bars and cables. In such bulk forms, the
materials lose their superconducting properties when exposed
to large electrical currents or magnetic fields. That makes
them unsuitable for such important applications as
electric-power cables and big electromagnets.</p>
<p>But the Houston researchers said they devised a continuous
process to make rods of one common high-temperature
superconductor, made of the elements yttrium, barium, copper
and oxygen. The technique involves moving a long sample of
the superconducting ingredients through a special oven. In
the oven, the material passes through different temperature
zones and comes out fused into a functioning superconductor.
The trick is in precisely regulating the oven's temperature
zones, as slight differences in heating produce radically
different superconducting properties. A similar process,
called zone-refining, is already used in the chip industry.</p>
<p>The process still needs improvement, but samples of the
bar were capable of carrying relatively high superconducting
currents in strong magnetic fields -- specifically, current
densities of between 7,500 and 20,000 amperes a square
centimeter, depending on the magnetic field.</p>
<p>Such results are adequate for building radio receivers and
transmitters, according to Neil Alford, head of
superconductor research at Britain's Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC. Already, ICI and AT&T scientists have jointly
made radio parts -- resonators and oscillators -- out of
laboratory superconductors that are 10 times more sensitive
than existing copper models. But Mr. Alford said bulk
production was one obstacle. "What these {Houston} guys have
done is what nobody else has managed, which was to
demonstrate the feasibility of continuous processing" of
high-temperature superconductors, Mr. Alford said.</p>
