	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- CS First Boston Inc., completing a management
shakeup, hired a Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.
executive who directed Shearson's cost-cutting and layoff
efforts in recent years.
   The hiring by CS First Boston of Shearson's chief
administrative officer, Robert M. Raziano, enabled CS First
Boston to fill two new senior-management posts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the more senior level appointment, Anthony P. Grassi, a
First Boston Corp. managing director, was named chief
financial and administrative officer of CS First Boston. The
job includes business planning, budgeting and all financial
and administrative systems. First Boston is CS First Boston's
U.S. investment bank</p>
<p>Mr. Raziano, meanwhile, will become head of finance,
administration, systems and operations at First Boston. Mr.
Raziano resigned from Shearson this week and his new job --
which combines the former functions of chief financial
officer and the head of administration, systems and
operations -- is effective June 18.</p>
<p>Mr. Raziano assumes the duties of former First Boston
Chief Financial Officer John E. Toffolon Jr., who resigned,
and Fenton R. "Pete" Talbott, the former head of
administration and systems who CS First Boston said will
assist Mr. Raziano "in the transition."</p>
<p>At Shearson, Mr. Raziano was well known as the central
figure in all of that firm's cost-containment efforts,
including the brokerage firm's thousands of layoffs. While
chief operating officer of Shearson's London unit during
1987, for example, he sliced 150 of the unit's nearly 1,300
employees. CS First Boston wouldn't say it hired Mr. Raziano
simply to help with layoffs, but that is clearly part of his
job.</p>
<p>"The reason we have hired Mr. Raziano is because he is one
of the best people on the Street in finance, administration,
systems and operations," said a CS First Boston spokesman,
"and clearly part of that function is making sure we operate
as efficiently as possible."</p>
<p>A Shearson spokesman said there are no plans at this time
to find a successor to Mr. Raziano. Because Shearson plans
soon to split into separate brokerage and investment-banking
units, Mr. Raziano's old job won't exist anymore but will
probably be divided up.</p>
<p>CS First Boston has been in a cost-cutting mode. The firm,
which is 44.5%-owned by the parent of Swiss bank Credit
Suisse, reported a slim $11 million profit last year; this
year it is trying to cut costs by at least 10%, and is
expected to trim hundreds of employees from its world-wide
staff of 6,000.</p>
