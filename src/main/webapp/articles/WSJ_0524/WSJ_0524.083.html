	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- Sharper Image Corp. reported a slightly
wider fiscal first-quarter loss on essentially flat revenue.
   For the quarter ended April 30, the loss widened to $1.4
million, or 17 cents a share, from $1.2 million, or 14 cents
a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 1.1% to $34.7 million
from $35.1 million, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The specialty retailer cited a "sluggish national
retailing environment" and higher expenses from increased
catalogue circulation and from the opening of four more
stores.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Sharper
Image shares plunged 62.5 cents to close at $5.125.</p>
