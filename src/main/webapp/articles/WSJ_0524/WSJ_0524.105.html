	<p class="article-leader">The United Kingdom's Monopolies and Mergers Commission
said that it wouldn't allow retailer Kingfisher PLC to
proceed with its hostile #461 million bid for retailer Dixons
PLC.
   The bid was referred to the commission in January. The
commission concluded that the proposed acquisition would have
combined the two largest retailers of electrical goods and
would bring about a "significant reduction" in the
competition of electrical retailing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Kingfisher bid had valued each Dixons share at 120
pence, and was conditional on its not being referred to the
commission.</p>
<p>Kingfisher's units hold a combined market share of about
9.6%, while Dixons and its electrical-goods retail subsidiary
hold a market share of about 16%. Analysts reckon the
percentages for both companies are significantly higher in
some areas.</p>
<p>Both Kingfisher and Dixons suspended their shares on the
London Stock Exchange pending the announcement, then resumed
trading, with the former closing up at 311 pence and the
latter closing down at 124 pence.</p>
