	<p class="article-leader">The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll was based on
nationwide telephone interviews of 1,007 registered voters
conducted last Friday through Tuesday by the polling
organizations of Peter Hart and Robert Teeter.
   The sample was drawn from 263 randomly selected geographic
points in the continental U.S. Each region of the country was
represented in proportion to its population. Households were
selected by a method that gave all telephone numbers, listed
and unlisted, an equal chance of being included. One
registered voter, 18 years or older, was selected from each
household by a procedure to provide the correct number of
male and female respondents. The results of the survey were
minimally weighted by education and marital status.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chances are 19 of 20 that if all registered voters in the
U.S. had been surveyed using the same questionnaire, the
findings would differ from these poll results by no more than
3.2 percentage points in either direction. The margin of
error for subgroups would be larger.</p>
