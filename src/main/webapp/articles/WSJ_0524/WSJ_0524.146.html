	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks sprinted past the Dow Jones
Industrial Average as technology shares again led the OTC
market.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 2.98 to 456.87, a 0.66%
gain compared with the 0.14% rise in the Dow industrials.
However, while the Dow average set another record, the Nasdaq
index remains almost 30 points below its high of 485.73 set
last Oct. 9.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Nasdaq 100 index, which tracks larger industrial
issues including technology stocks, jumped 6.43 to 472.12, a
1.38% advance. Advancing shares overtook decliners late in
the day, 1,086 to 947. Stocks hitting new highs again
outpaced new lows, 188 to 71. Volume remained hefty at 188.7
million, down from 190.1 million Tuesday.</p>
<p>"From a trader's standpoint, the OTC market looks really
healthy," said Ralph Costanza, managing director of OTC
trading at Smith Barney, Harris Upham. Mr. Costanza explained
that technology shares are providing the leadership needed to
pull smaller stocks higher. Big computer stocks, he
explained, attract both large institutions and smaller
investors.</p>
<p>Mr. Costanza also said he was heartened by the orderly
demand for OTC shares. "Once they start throwing caution to
the wind and start buying anything, then we have to worry,"
he said. "But I'm not seeing that kind of rampant
speculation."</p>
<p>Investors trading through A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis
bought a broad spectrum of stocks, according to Robert
McCready, an OTC trader there. "We saw them pecking away at
some of the banks that have been under pressure," Mr.
McCready said.</p>
<p>Intel traded to a new 52-week high after Merrill Lynch
picked the issue as its "Focus Stock of the Week," according
to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Shares of the
Santa Clara, Calif., semiconductor maker rose 2 to 48; Intel
was the day's second most active issue.</p>
<p>Microsoft jumped 4 3/8 to 75 7/8 on 1.9 million shares
after Wednesday's much-heralded unveiling of the Redmond,
Wash., software maker's Windows 3.0 package.</p>
<p>Oracle Systems was the most active issue, gaining 1 to 19
3/4 on 3.1 million shares. Tuesday, the Belmont, Calif.,
database management software maker created a separate
operating subsidiary and reorganized its management.</p>
<p>Goal Systems jumped 2 1/8 to 17 1/8 after the Columbus,
Ohio, maker of IBM-compatible software announced a loss for
the first quarter ended April 30 of 12 cents a share,
compared with restated net income a year earlier of six
cents. However, that loss included a charge of 20 cents
related to one-time merger and acquisition expenses.</p>
<p>Culp added 1/4 to 8 1/4 after the High Point, N.C.,
textile company said it expects to report a profit for the
fourth quarter ended April 29 and a net gain for the year,
compared with a loss of 20 cents a share in fiscal 1989.</p>
<p>Long Lake Energy added 1/4 to 2 3/4. The New York
developer of electric power plants said it finalized a line
of credit agreement with its principal shareholders and that
its outside auditors removed an April 3 statement expressing
concern about Long Lake's ability to continue as an ongoing
business.</p>
<p>Biotechnology stocks continued to bubble as analysts
highlighted them. Chiron rose 2 1/2 to 32 1/2 after
Oppenheimer analyst Jeffrey Casdin added the stock to the
brokerage firm's list of issues recommended for purchase,
according to DJPIR. According to another person at
Oppenheimer, Mr. Casdin cited prospects for the Emeryville,
Calif., company's hepatitis C test.</p>
<p>Prudential-Bache biotechnology analyst Stuart Weisbrod
recommended investors sell shares of Centocor and Genzyme and
buy Immunex, Cetus and Amgen, DJPIR reported. Genzyme eased
3/8 to 19 3/8; Centocor, down earlier in the day, gained 1/2
to 41 1/2. Amgen rose 2 3/4 to 74.</p>
<p>Shares of Immunex, which Tuesday received a favorable
review of its drug to stimulate white-blood-cell production,
climbed 2 1/4 to 21 3/4.</p>
<p>Cetus advanced 5/8 to 17 1/8. In addition to Mr.
Weisbrod's comments, Cetus traded higher in the wake of
Wednesday's announcement that the Emeryville, Calif., company
won a round in a patent dispute with Erbamont Inc. over a
widely prescribed anti-tumor drug that it imports. More than
1.4 million shares changed hands, nearly six times average
volume.</p>
<p>The day's most prominent loser was Intermec, which plunged
4 1/2 to 18 1/4 on 2.2 million shares. Late Tuesday, the
Lynnwood, Wash., maker of electronic bar-code printers,
scanners and related products, reported net income for the
fourth quarter ended March 31 of 43 cents a share, flat with
a year earlier.</p>
<p>American Republic Bancorp slid 1/2 to 7 1/4 after its
president and chief executive officer, John B. O'Donnell,
resigned. The Torrance, Calif., bank said only that Mr.
O'Donnell resigned because "he may have inadvertently engaged
in activities which appear inconsistent with company policy,"
but didn't provide further details.</p>
<p>Agnico-Eagle Mines lost 1 to 7 1/8, giving back Tuesday's
5/8 gain. The Canadian gold mining company said it plans to
proceed with a planned offering of 40 million Canadian
dollars (US$34 million) of shares and warrants that was
challenged by a shareholder, Jacque Forget. Tuesday, Mr.
Forget said he plans to establish a group of investors to
pursue a takeover bid for the company. Yesterday,
Agnico-Eagle also called Mr. Forget's comments about alleged
management errors "completely unfounded."</p>
<p>Possis extended its losses. Tuesday, the Minneapolis
contract engineering and computer-aided design concern
reported net income for the third quarter ended April 30 of
one cent a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of 10
cents. The stock fell 1/8 to 4 1/8 after Tuesday's 1/8-point
drop.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>CENTOCOR Inc. and Genzyme Corp. shares were downgraded to
"hold" from "buy" by Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
biotechnology analyst Stuart Weisbrod. Yesterday's OTC Focus
column said Mr. Weisbrod advised investors to sell those two
stocks and buy others he is recommending, but
Prudential-Bache said such action was suggested only for
"aggressive accounts." Mr. Weisbrod wasn't available for
comment, but Prudential-Bache made a copy of his research
report available.</p>
