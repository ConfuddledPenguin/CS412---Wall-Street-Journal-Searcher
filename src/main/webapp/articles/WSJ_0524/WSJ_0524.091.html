	<p class="article-leader">PROVO, Utah -- Novell Inc. reported
higher-than-anticipated results for the fiscal-second
quarter, reflecting the continuing boom in the business of
tying computers together in networks.
   For the quarter ended April 28, Novell said profit rose
78% to $20.5 million, or 60 cents a share, from $11.5
million, or 35 cents share, a year ago. Revenue rose 9% to
$120 million from $110.4 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most analysts expected earnings of 53 to 54 cents a share
and revenue in the range of $114 million to $118 million.</p>
<p>Novell principally provides software that allows personal
computers to share printers, information and programs. The
company said the latest quarter's results reflect the
profitable effect of having a growing share of its revenue --
75% compared with 63% a year earlier -- come from software
sales. "There is a direct correlation between that and our
gross margins," a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Novell said the results reflected $400,000 in expenses
from its recently aborted merger with Lotus Development
Corp., Cambridge, Mass. The $1.5 billion transaction fell
through last weekend after the two companies couldn't agree
on the composition of a combined board. Novell said
"additional immaterial merger costs" would be recognized in
the fiscal-third quarter.</p>
<p>For the six months, Novell said profit rose 58% to $35.6
million, or $1.05 a share, on revenue of $225.9 million, from
profit of $22.5 million, or 68 cents a share, on revenue of
$209.1 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>The results were announced after markets had closed.</p>
