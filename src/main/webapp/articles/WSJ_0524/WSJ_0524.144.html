	<p class="article-leader">Trans World Airlines Inc.'s machinists union offered owner
Carl C. Icahn a framework under which employees would take
control of the ailing carrier.
   The union said it proposed acquiring 100% of TWA through
an employee stock ownership plan that would also include the
carrier's pilots, flight attendants and nonunion employees.
The labor group hasn't yet made a formal offer, saying it
hasn't completed an evaluation of TWA's assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, the union is expected to argue that the carrier
currently has a negative value that removes the necessity for
employees to pay anything for it. Under the machinists' plan,
employees would take over only the airline. Mr. Icahn would
keep TWA's investments in such other companies as USX Corp.
Those investments are valued at between $1 billion and $1.6
billion. The union also wants Mr. Icahn to remain responsible
for the company's debt.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn has been seeking to unload the unprofitable
carrier for months. Such a plan would allow him to "exit
gracefully," said machinist union leader Timothy Connolly.</p>
<p>If the machinists' proposal progresses, TWA would become
the second major carrier where employees are seeking to take
control. Last month, UAL Corp.'s board approved a $4.38
billion buy-out proposal from United Airlines unions. The UAL
unions have until Aug. 9 to finance their offer.</p>
<p>The TWA machinists took their inspiration for the plan
from a threat Mr. Icahn made a few weeks ago to transfer
TWA's domestic route system to America West Airlines Inc. But
a transfer of assets won't prove easy.</p>
<p>TWA is $2.8 billion in debt, the result of a 1988
transaction in which Mr. Icahn took the carrier private. The
employee group doesn't want to assume responsibility for the
debt. But it is unlikely Mr. Icahn would agree to remain
responsible for it.</p>
<p>Mr. Icahn said he is open to an employee takeover, but
called the machinists' proposal "a pretty tough deal." He
said before talks can proceed, he wants assurances that the
employees would make concessions to keep the airline going.
He also said he is concerned about labor's ability to
continue making lease payments on aircraft an
Icahn-controlled company owns.</p>
<p>TWA, which had losses of $298 million last year, has been
staggering under the weight of about $490 million in annual
debt service. It has already posted losses of $143 million in
the first three months of this year, when higher costs for
fuel, service and maintenance were factors.</p>
<p>Employee owners would inherit the fundamental problem that
has plagued TWA for years. It is largely an international
carrier with a small domestic route system to feed its
overseas flights. It faces increased competition from foreign
carriers and U.S. carriers with vast domestic routes.</p>
<p>The machinists union contends that the employees, as
owners, would be willing to provide wage concessions and
productivity gains needed to fund growth at the airline.
TWA's unions have refused Mr. Icahn any further concessions.
In turn, Mr. Icahn has postponed placing additional orders
for new aircraft and resisted making other capital
investments in TWA.</p>
<p>The machinists' proposal needs the support of other TWA
unions to succeed. Leaders of the pilots and flight
attendants unions said they would support a change in
ownership, but aren't certain the machinists' proposal can
succeed.</p>
<p>Whether or not the proposal succeeds, TWA's debt needs to
be restructured in order for the airline to survive, said
pilots union leader William Compton. Mr. Compton said the
pilots are also looking into an arrangement whereby TWA
creditors would exchange debt they hold for common stock in
the airline.</p>
