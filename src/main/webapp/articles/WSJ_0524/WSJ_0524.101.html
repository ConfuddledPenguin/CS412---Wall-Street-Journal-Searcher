	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Security Pacific Corp.'s Pacific Northwest
affiliate said it would make a minimum $1 billion in
community-based loans during the next 10 years, the latest
big bank to boost its support for such projects.
   "What is new is the fact that we are making a public
commitment to a minimum dollar amount for an extended period
of time," the Seattle affiliate, Security Pacific Bancorp.
Northwest, said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The commitment covers Washington, Oregon and Alaska, and
is aimed primarily at low-income and moderate-income housing
and small-sized and minority-owned business, officials said.
The Security Pacific affiliate has about $10.2 billion in
assets. Last year, its community loans approximately totaled
$83 million, and so the latest commitment, averaging $100
million annually, would represent roughly a 20% annual
increase.</p>
<p>Big banks have come under some pressure in recent years
from local activists and federal officials to boost such
lending, which is generally mandated by the federal Community
Reinvestment Act. Security Pacific Corp. and Wells Fargo &
Co., based in San Francisco, announced large commitments of
their own earlier this year.</p>
<p>"Top managements are recognizing there may be less risk in
inner-city loans than with some of the other loans in their
portfolio," said Robert Gnaizda, a San Francisco
public-interest lawyer who has met with Security Pacific
officials over community-lending policies.</p>
