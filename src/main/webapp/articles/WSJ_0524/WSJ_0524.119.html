	<p class="article-leader">Chemical Banking Corp. is packaging into securities a
bunch of loans to holders of McDonald's Corp. fast-food
franchises.
   Two Chemical units, Texas Commerce Bank and Chemical
Securities Inc., announced the formation of a separate
company, Golden Managers Acceptance Corp. That company, known
as Golden Mac, is making loans to McDonald's franchise owners
for their restaurants or improvements. The loans then will be
used as collateral for top-rated commercial paper, a very
short-term corporate IOU bought by institutional investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Golden Mac is designed to provide existing and new owners
of McDonald's franchise restaurants with an alternative
source of capital at highly competitive rates, Texas Commerce
and Chemical said. Chemical Securities plans to get the
program going in early June with the sale of about $20
million of commercial paper. Golden Mac is authorized to
issue $125 million of paper, which has been dubbed "McPaper"
by some in the market.</p>
<p>The McDonald's program marks the first time that franchise
loans have been packaged into securities.</p>
