	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Coca-Cola Co., looking for ways to win a bigger
share of the morning beverage market, is developing an
iced-coffee product, according to beverage industry
executives.
   It wasn't clear how close Coke may be to bringing the
coffee to market. The company is studying the product in
focus groups, an industry executive said.</p>

<p>For Coke, the new coffee underscores a burgeoning interest
in beverages outside the traditional soft-drink arena. In
March, Coke started selling PowerAde, a so-called isotonic
sports drink developed to combat Gatorade. Coke's heightened
new-product activity comes as growth in the regular soda
market slowed in the past year.</p>
<p>In its bid for more of the pre-lunch market, Coke for the
past three years has been running a "Coke in the Morning" ad
campaign in certain areas. According to industry estimates,
coffee accounts for 47% of the morning beverage market,
followed by juice with 21%, milk at 17%, tea, 7% and soft
drinks, only 4%.</p>
<p>Iced coffees generally are ready-to-drink coffees that are
chilled. Coke's development of such a product, the industry
executives added, may have been accelerated as a result of
the recent market test of Nescafe Mocha Cooler, made by one
of Coke's biggest global beverage competitors, Nestle Foods
Corp., a unit of Nestle S.A. in Vevey, Switzerland. Being
tested in several U.S. cities, the Nestle product -- a
combination of coffee, chocolate and milk -- is based on an
iced coffee the company introduced last year in the United
Kingdom. Nestle plans soon to distribute that product,
Nescafe Frappe, in France, Spain, Switzerland, West Germany,
Greece and Canada.</p>
<p>General Foods USA is expected to launch its own iced
cappuccino next year, according to a beverage industry
observer. General Foods, owned by Philip Morris Cos.,
wouldn't comment.</p>
<p>Coke has been studying iced coffee for years but
previously had come to the conclusion that there wasn't
sufficient demand for such a product in the U.S. In Japan, by
contrast, where ready-to-drink coffees -- both iced and hot
-- are a $3.7 billion industry, Coke has successfully sold
its Georgia Coffee brand for years. Georgia Coffee's strong
performance there, in fact, is one reason why Japan is
Coca-Cola's biggest profit center.</p>
<p>But recent market research by Bevmark Inc. suggests the
time may be ripe for iced coffee here. Across a broad section
of socioeconomic and ethnic groups, consumers show a strong
acceptance of iced coffee as a substitute for hot coffee and
even, in some instances, for soft drinks, according to
studies by the Los Angeles beverage consulting company.
People still worry about the caffeine content in iced coffee,
the research showed. But consumers tended to prefer the
flavor of creamed and sweetened iced coffees over hot
coffees.</p>
<p>Although iced coffee has tended to be more of a luncheon
beverage, industry consultants said, companies are aiming to
position it as a morning drink to take advantage of
consumers' increasing defection from hot coffee in the
morning to cold and sweet beverages.</p>
<p>The current U.S. market for iced coffees is tiny, less
than $15 million a year, according to Beverage Marketing
Corp., a New York beverage consultant. The chilled products
represent the newest niche coffee marketers are experimenting
with to combat declining coffee consumption.</p>
<p>Iced coffee could be one of the fastest-growing new
beverages in years, some marketers say. "It looks like a
product with tremendous potential to attract younger and
older consumers," said Tom Pirko, president of Bevmark.</p>
<p>What products iced coffee will replace is a matter of
debate. It may hurt iced-tea sales, some beverage experts
said. "It won't cannibalize coffee, but will feed on soft
drinks and other cold drinks," said George Boecklin,
president of the National Coffee Association. If people want
a hot drink, he noted, they won't substitute an iced coffee
for it.</p>
<p>But Michael Bellas, president of Beverage Marketing,
expects older, regular coffee drinkers to be the initial
target of the iced-coffee sales effort. Eventually, he said,
the marketing will be directed more at younger people,
thereby tapping into the soft-drink industry's most important
consumer group.</p>
