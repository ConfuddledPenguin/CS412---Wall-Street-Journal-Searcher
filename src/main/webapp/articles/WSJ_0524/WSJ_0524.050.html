	<p class="article-leader">When you see Blair Brown in "Strapless" you'll think, "She
looks awful," which is exactly what the writer and director,
David Hare, wants you to think. Unfortunately, the rest of
Mr. Hare's intentions don't succeed nearly as well.
   He has laid the groundwork here for a psychological drama
that could have been interesting in the hands of someone with
a better grasp of the visual medium. However Mr. Hare, whose
main work has been for the stage, has managed to wring the
passion and wit out of his own words. Then he tries to give
the limp remains some shape by draping them on the artificial
symbol he constructed to give his work form.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ms. Brown plays a 40-year-old American doctor named
Lillian who has spent her adult life in England. She's
successful and still attractive, though Mr. Hare makes a
point of highlighting every sag and wrinkle to emphasize how
desperate for love she must be. Her work has absorbed her --
up to a point. She makes an effort not to involve herself too
deeply with her patients. She refuses to lead protests
against cutbacks even though her colleagues have asked her.</p>
<p>On a trip to Europe, however, she meets a mysterious
stranger with soulful eyes and unusual directness. Bruno
Ganz, the Swiss actor who played the wistful angel in "Wings
of Desire," couldn't be better cast as this romantic,
unknowable character, Raymond. This Raymond has the
confidence and the clothes of someone very rich and
sophisticated, and the puppyish adoration of a teen-ager
working on his first big crush. Even Lillian, who has lived a
life of enforced calm, can't resist the combination.</p>
<p>For once she acts impetuously, only to find, after she's
taken the dive, that Raymond's pool is empty. For him, the
courtship was the thing, so having made his conquest he's
moved on, and taken his mirage with him. Lillian becomes
obsessed with finding out out more about him so she can free
herself.</p>
<p>There are many models for this kind of cat-and-mouse love
affair, in which a repressed person meets someone who allows
her to drop her inhibitions. Mr. Hare seems to have studied
none of the major classics in this genre. Ms. Brown's Lillian
shows no sign of hidden passion. She's like a modern
skyscraper; chilly, no matter what the natural temperature
might register. And Mr. Hare has managed to take the mystery
out of that born enigma, Mr. Ganz.</p>
<p>As a counterpoint to uptight Lillian, Mr. Hare has brought
in her sister Amy (Bridget Fonda), a flibbertigibbet who
tries to design clothes but mostly hangs around in skimpy
clothes with men of skimpy character. Amy's main occupation
in life apparently has been to find an identity as far from
Lillian's "perfection" as possible. She makes no plans. In
the end the two sisters come to the same conclusion by
alternate routes -- to move forward, they must each be
independent.</p>
<p>But Mr. Hare asks us to reach this conclusion with a most
peculiar symbol. Amy becomes pregnant and chooses to have her
child alone. Mr. Hare views Amy's pregnancy as the catalyst
for her creativity, and has her come up with a fashion
statement that is more statement than fashion: She designs a
strapless gown. Its freefloating bodice stands alone, the way
she and her sister and all their sisters should stand alone,
without support.</p>
<p>Well, Lillian takes one look at this dress design and
suddenly she respects her sister and feels strong, strong
enough to take charge of the protest at the hospital and to
make a speech about English values. By the end the movie
feels like it's hanging pretty much like one of Amy's
designs, strapless.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Somebody must have instructed the makers of "Bird on a
Wire" to figure out as many ways as possible to film Goldie
Hawn's thighs. She climbs up a ladder, giving her pink silk
skirt an opportunity to billow in crude homage to Marilyn
Monroe. She gets thrown to the floor of a speeding car so her
skirt can fly back to her waist. She swings on a rope across
a manmade ravine.</p>
<p>However, none of this distracts from how thin and hungry
she looks. Ms. Hawn's thighs aren't the only attraction in
this equal-opportunity film. Mel Gibson's bodyparts also are
asked to do his acting for him. He bares his backside for his
fans, just after he's uttered one of the film's big laugh
lines: "I've been shot in the butt."</p>
<p>There isn't an original or enjoyable moment in this
hulking action comedy. All the ingredients for everything
have been dumped together, ending up with the movie
equivalent of a corned beef hash carrot cake souffle. Mel and
Goldie giggle and laugh at nothing in particular while they
run from bad guys in motorcycles, cars and planes. There is a
strangely sentimental view of drug smuggling leashed to an
incomprehensible plot that includes corrupt FBI men, evil
druglords, the witness-protection program and a woman
veterinarian who looks like an android.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>VIDEO TIP: Though doomed romanticism wasn't Mr. Hare's
point in "Strapless," maybe it should have been. The subject
was a favorite of David Lean's, before he started making
epics, and one of his best was "Summertime." Katharine
Hepburn is wonderfully poignant as an unmarried middleaged
woman on vacation in Venice, who falls in love with a
charming, unhappily married man.</p>
