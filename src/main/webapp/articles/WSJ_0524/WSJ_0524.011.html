	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Led by declining orders for transportation
equipment, new orders for durable goods dropped 4.1% in April
after showing healthy increases in February and March, the
Commerce Department reported.
   Orders to factories for durable goods, which include
machinery, household appliances, military equipment, cars and
other items designed to last at least three years, fell to
$123.27 billion last month. April's decline follows a revised
6.5% increase in March to $128.58 billion and a 2.4% increase
in February to $120.78 billion. In January, orders tumbled
10.5%, the steepest decline since the department began
recording the figures 32 years ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many economists said the figures confirm what they've been
seeing for the past year -- a flat manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>"The weak factory sector reflects the Fed's tightening
that ended in the middle of 1989," said Mike Penzer, senior
economist at Bank of America in San Francisco. He added that
because there is a lag of two or three quarters between the
time a monetary policy is put into effect and the time the
policy is reflected in factory orders, the factory sector may
experience mild growth later this year.</p>
<p>Orders for transportation equipment plummeted 14.3% last
month after rising 23.4% in March and 10.1% in February. The
February and March increases followed a 27.6% drop in
January.</p>
<p>The reduction reflected declines in both automobiles and
aircraft. Aircraft orders fluctuate a lot, however, and many
economists agreed that the aircraft industry isn't weakening.</p>
<p>"If we're going to maintain the growth rate, as subdued as
it is, we're going to have to get something going," said
Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago.</p>
<p>Excluding the transportation sector, durable-goods orders
fell 0.1% in April after rising 0.9% in March.</p>
<p>New orders for nondefense capital goods, considered an
indicator of future plant and equipment spending, fell 9.7%
last month after rising 13.3% in March and dropping 5.9% in
February. Many analysts said April's drop suggests that
orders for nondefense capital goods will be soft during the
second quarter of this year and won't boost the real gross
national product -- the total output of goods and services,
adjusted for inflation -- as they did in the first quarter.
Durable-goods shipments were down 2.3% in April to $122.07
billion following a 1.4% increase in March. Unfilled orders
increased 0.2% in April to $497.84 billion after rising 0.7%
in March.</p>
