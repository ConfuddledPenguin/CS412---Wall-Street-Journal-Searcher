	<h3>Gold Again Takes a Dive On Heavy Saudi Selling</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Gold prices plunged for the second time in two
months, and for the same reason: heavy selling by Saudi
Arabians.
   On the Commodity Exchange here yesterday, the June futures
contract dropped more than $15 an ounce during the day, but
ended $11.80 lower at $364.60.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decline was less than half the nearly $30-an-ounce
drop on March 26, when an estimated 125 tons of gold were
sold in London. Sales yesterday amounted to 30 to 35 tons, or
roughly one million ounces, according to Jeffrey Nichols,
president of American Precious Metals Advisors, in Toronto.</p>
<p>Even so, "it was a fantastic day, both for selling and
buying," said Ian MacDonald, vice president of Credit Suisse,
New York. After the price plunged, he explained, buyers
rushed in to the gold bullion market with the greatest fervor
since 1979. That demand helped futures prices partially
rebound by the close.</p>
<p>Gold hasn't recovered much of its March decline, trading
mostly in the $360 range since then. It rose 18% from
mid-September through late January to a high of $425, but
then started fading to about $389 before the first round of
Saudi sales.</p>
<p>Most traders weren't nearly as stunned yesterday as they
had been two months earlier. Nonetheless, the sudden
appearance of so much gold for sale in the London market
caused considerable turmoil. The regular morning meeting by
five top London gold dealers to fix gold's price in the
British market, normally an exercise lasting 15 to 30
minutes, dragged on for 2 1/2 hours. This was the longest
fixing since 1968, when gold was allowed to trade in a free
market, a London dealer said.</p>
<p>The selling was attributed to the National Commercial Bank
of Saudi Arabia, headquartered in Jeddah, according to trade
and brokerage sources in London and New York. That was the
same bank cited as the big seller March 26.</p>
<p>An official of the bank in London neither confirmed nor
denied the transaction. If there were any orders, he said,
they would have come from the head office in Jeddah.</p>
<p>With no facts to constrain them, traders and dealers
speculated freely why the Saudis were selling so much gold.
One New York dealer thought it was simply a "bear raid" by
the Saudi traders, who hoped to buy the gold back cheaply
after depressing the price.</p>
<p>Others, noting that the Saudis were buying British pounds
as they sold gold, suggested the Saudis were making a payment
on armaments being purchased from Britain. However, one
London precious metals specialist said that if such were the
case, the business likely would have been done through the
Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, a government agency, and
not a commercial bank.</p>
<p>One oil dealer said he thought the Saudis were selling
both oil and gold, a tactic with which they also were
credited in March. The strategy, the oil dealer said, would
be to sell gold as a hedge against the oil sales-also
creating an opportunity to pick up gold later at a lower
cost.</p>
<p>Mr. Nichols of American Precious Metals said he suspects
the Saudis sold as much as they could in March, but still had
some to sell after prices fell sharply at that time. "They
simply waited for the price to rise again and then sold what
they had left," he said. He noted that the smaller amount
sold yesterday suggested that it was a residual of the March
sales.</p>
<p>One thing dealers, traders and analysts agreed on was that
the selling didn't come from the Soviet Union. Specialists in
London and Zurich said they saw no sign of massive selling
from the Soviet Union, despite persistent market rumors that
Moscow has been dumping gold in recent weeks to help finance
a continuing shortage of hard currency. Fears of continuing
Soviet sales have been an unsettling factor in the market,
they said.</p>
<p>Norbert Schroff, chief dealer at Credit Suisse's precious
metals desk in Zurich, said the Soviets had been heavy
sellers in April. But he added there was no evidence to
support speculation that the Soviets may be using Middle
Eastern gold trading institutions to front for their gold
sales.</p>
<p>While the focus yesterday was on the price plunge,
analysts said the stage may be set for subsequent increases.
Mr. Nichols noted that the March drop had led to rises in
April and May.</p>
<p>Edwin Arnold, metals specialist at Merrill Lynch in
London, said there appeared to be good support for gold at
around $350 an ounce. Kevin Crisp, a researcher of Gold
Fields Mineral Services Ltd. in London, also thought the new
low levels could stimulate new buying interest.</p>
<p>"We find that Middle and Far Eastern jewelry and hoarding
demand rises when gold falls to present depressed levels," he
said.</p>
<p>Gold's drop led other precious metals futures prices
lower, but they proved somewhat resilient. The July delivery
for silver ended at $5.2780 an ounce, for a loss of 5.70
cents, but moved as high as $5.33 from a low of $5.15.
Similarly, July platinum ended with a decline of $6.70 an
ounce at $495.20, but the contract traded at an intraday high
of $499.50 after declining to a low of $491.</p>
