	<p class="article-leader">PepsiCo Inc. said it has received final approval from the
government of India to sell soft drinks and said its joint
venture there plans to spend more than $1 billion to build
Pepsi's food and beverage businesses over the next decade.
   Although the full joint venture was approved by the Indian
government in 1988, Pepsi said opposition from India's
soft-drink industry created considerable uncertainty in the
past two months that Pepsi would receive final clearance to
sell soft drinks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As an almost undeveloped market, India represents vast
potential for Pepsi. In a country of some 800 million people,
Indians annually drink only about 80 million cases of soda --
the same amount sold in Seattle. On a per-capita basis,
Indians drink about three bottles of soft drinks a year,
compared with more than 700 in the U.S.</p>
<p>"This market could literally quadruple on a per-capita
basis over 10 years," said Chistopher A. Sinclair, president
of PepsiCola International. Pepsi is pinning its hopes on
India's growing middle class, currently estimated to comprise
some 150 million people. By year-end, Pepsi plans to
distribute its products in Calcutta, Bombay, Punjab and
Delhi, among other places.</p>
<p>"We're not expecting to make money right away," said Mr.
Sinclair. "We'll be investing the cash flow in the business
for a long time." However, Pepsi, based in Purchase, N.Y.,
does expect to be making a profit in India within five or six
years, he said.</p>
<p>Coupled with Pepsi's recent 10-year agreement to sell soft
drinks in the Soviet Union, the Indian business gives Pepsi
another boost in its campaign to compete globally with rival
Coca-Cola Co.</p>
<p>Coke, which outsells Pepsi more than 2-to-1
internationally, withdrew from India in 1977 over a dispute
with the government that would have required disclosure of
Coke's secret formula. In March, the government denied Coke's
request to re-enter India. Unable to make money after four
years in the mid-1950s, Pepsi itself abandoned the India
market.</p>
<p>One cloud looms over Pepsi's otherwise bright Indian
summer. Last year, the U.S. called India an unfair trading
partner under the so-called Super 301 provision of the 1988
U.S. trade law, alleging that India's strict regulations
hindered foreign investment. The Super 301 provision requires
retaliation if countries don't resolve trade practices the
U.S. deems unfair.</p>
<p>Pepsi wouldn't speculate about what might happen to its
Indian venture as a result of any retaliatory flare-up, but
it isn't taking chances, either. The company recently sent a
letter to U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, stating that
it thinks the Indian approval of the Pepsi venture signals a
laudable openness to foreign investment. "We hope that our
government will not have to take any actions {against India}
under the Super 301 process," the letter added.</p>
<p>Through negotiations that began six years ago, Pepsi was
able to crack the Indian market in 1988, by winning over the
government with a package of political sweeteners, including
food-processing plants.</p>
<p>Pepsi's India joint venture -- consisting of Pepsi, a
private Indian conglomerate, and a government agricultural
agency -- also makes snack-food products. The venture
partners, along with Indian franchisees, will make the $1
billion investment. Over the next decade, Pepsi estimates
that the retail sales of its snacks and soft drinks in India
will total $2.5 billion.</p>
<p>Now Pepsi has new hurdles. For one thing, it will have to
compete with Parle Beverages Ltd., India's biggest soft-drink
company. Led by flagship Thumbs Up cola, Parle holds an
estimated 60% of the $500 million soft-drink market. And,
given the structure of Indian retailing, there are few big
stores for Pepsi to try to win over to make an immediate
splash. Sales battles will likely be protracted
mini-skirmishes over thousands of mom-and-pop outlets, where
shoppers buy one bottle at a time.</p>
