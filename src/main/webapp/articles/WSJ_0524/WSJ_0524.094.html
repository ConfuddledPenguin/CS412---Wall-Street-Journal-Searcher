	<div class="article-body"><p>It's part of a life-insurance agent's job to ask nosy
questions about clients' personal lives and finances.</p>
<p>But the clients rarely turn the tables. That's too bad,
some insurance experts say, because insurance buyers just
might benefit by asking agents a few questions of their own.</p>
<p>Two possibilities: How big a commission will the agent
earn on a given policy?</p>
<p>Is there another policy that could accomplish the same
things for the client, but at a lower cost because it pays a
lower commission?</p>
<p>"If I were a sophisticated buyer, I would want to know
what the commission is," says Harold D. Skipper Jr., an
insurance professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
"It may well be the agent's recommendation is being
influenced by commissions."</p>
<p>Some insurance buyers may want to look into policies
available directly from insurers without sales commissions.
There are also strategies that buyers working with agents can
use to try to get a policy with a lower commission -- and,
possibly, better performance, too.</p>
<p>Such inquiries and attempts to bargain are unseemly to
some people in the insurance business. "You move the process
from a counseling process to a used-car lot," says Jack E.
Bobo, head of the National Association of Life Underwriters,
a big agents' group.</p>
<p>A low commission isn't the only reason to choose a
particular policy, of course. And good insurance agents can
provide valuable assistance for which they deserve to be
paid.</p>
<p>Still, there is a fundamental reason for insurance buyers
to care about the level of agents' compensation. Everything
else being equal, "the dollars that don't go into the agent's
pocket go to work for you," says James H. Hunt, an actuary
and director of the National Insurance Consumer Organization,
Alexandria, Va.</p>
<p>Most insurance buyers give little thought to their agent's
compensation because they don't pay the sales commissions
directly, and commission levels usually aren't disclosed. But
while it's typically the insurance company that pays the
agent, there's no question who's footing the bill, says
Joseph M. Belth, an insurance professor at Indiana
University, Bloomington. "It's built into the pricing of the
product," he says.</p>
<p>The amount can be substantial, particularly in the case of
"cash value" policies, such as "whole" life and "universal"
life, that combine death benefits with a savings component.
Often, the agent's commission on a cash-value policy is
around half of the premiums the buyer pays in the policy's
first year. And at some companies, it can be as much as 120%
of the first-year premiums. There also may be subsequent
payments of, say, 5% a year.</p>
<p>For less costly term insurance, which provides only
protection, commissions usually range from 30% to 80% of the
first-year premiums. But low-commission term policies aren't
always the best buys, because some insurers make up for
higher agents' commissions by cutting their own profit
margins to build market share.</p>
<p>Commissions also can be a significant factor in how a
policy ultimately performs. Consider two universal life
policies from Ameritas Life Insurance Corp., Lincoln, Neb.,
that differ principally in that one pays the seller a
commission and the other doesn't. As shown in the
accompanying table, the no-commission policy has higher
projected surrender values, the sums a holder would receive
upon dropping the contract after a given number of years.</p>
<p>That's especially important to policyholders who drop
coverage after a only few years. And, according to the
industry's Life Insurance Marketing & Research Association,
Hartford, Conn., fully half of the whole-life policies
written in 1989 will probably "lapse" within six or seven
years.</p>
<p>Even policyholders who don't drop coverage benefit when
surrender values are high because more dollars are available
for borrowing via policy loans. Higher surrender values can
also lead to higher death benefits or lower premiums.</p>
<p>Glenn S. Daily, a New York insurance analyst, advises
buying no-commission policies because they give holders "a
big head start" in accumulating policy value. For cash-value
policies, he recommends Ameritas and three other insurers:
USAA Life Insurance Co., San Antonio, Texas; John Alden Life
Insurance Co., Miami; and Lincoln Benefit Life Co., Lincoln,
Neb.</p>
<p>Yet no-commission insurance probably isn't the answer for
the vast majority of consumers. That's because they want or
need the assistance of an agent.</p>
<p>A good agent won't try to sell a policy with an outlandish
commission. But insurance buyers can often nudge their agents
to proffer lower commission contracts. James E. Wilson, a
Columbia, S.C., financial planner, sometimes suggests that
clients get a proposal from a no-commission company and use
that as "ammunition" in negotiating with an agent.</p>
<p>The secret to getting a good deal is understanding the
illusion and the realities of the commission system.</p>
<p>The illusion is that commissions are pretty much fixed.
Indeed, anti-rebating laws in 48 states prohibit agents from
returning part or all of their commissions to insurance
buyers.</p>
<p>The reality is that agents have considerable flexibility
in determining the level of commission they receive in
selling coverage to a particular client.</p>
<p>Probably the easiest way for an agent to be flexible on
commission is by shopping among insurance companies. Some
individual companies even have multiple policies that differ
principally in their commission levels. It's also possible to
structure a hybrid policy with a lower commission by
combining various types of cash-value and term coverage.</p>
<p>An easier route for consumers is to take an indirect
reading of a policy's commission level by looking at the
surrender value in the initial years. NICO's Mr. Hunt
suggests that consumers refuse any policy with a zero
surrender value at the end of the first year; he says buyers
should look for a projected first-year surrender value equal
to at least half the first premium.</p>
<p>"If you adamantly stick to your guns," he says, "you will
find that new proposals will come forth. . . . In effect, the
commission will be going down and your values will be going
up."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>                Why Commissions Count</p>
<p>How commissions can affect a life-insurance policy's
projected surrender value, the amount a policyholder would
get upon dropping the policy after a certain number of years.</p>
<p>Comparison is $100,000 of universal life-insurance
coverage from Ameritas Life Insurance Corp. for a non-smoking
man, age 45, paying a $1,500 annual premium.</p>
