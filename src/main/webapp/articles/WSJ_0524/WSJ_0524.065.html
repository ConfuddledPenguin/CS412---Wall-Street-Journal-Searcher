	<p class="article-leader">Petroleum prices fell as much as 85 cents a barrel in the
wake of a report on increased crude oil inventories in the
U.S.
   The U.S. oil industry's latest weekly count of the amount
of crude oil in storage was up by 4.4 million barrels to a
total of 380.7 million barrels as of Friday. That was the
highest level since 1982. And the report, issued by the
American Petroleum Institute late Tuesday, after most oil
markets had closed, triggered a near free-fall in oil prices
that swept around the world.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the API report of swollen U.S. crude inventories, the
apparent catalyst for this latest price fall, only reflects
the world oil glut resulting from continued high production
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, oil
analysts noted.</p>
<p>"It's only symptomatic; the reality is that the market is
oversupplied (by OPEC)," said Michael Rothman, vice president
and senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in
New York.</p>
<p>Although OPEC agreed in early May to cut back on
production by more than one million barrels a day, Mr.
Rothman said preliminary estimates suggest that total output
hasn't yet been trimmed. "Saudi Arabia seems to have
implemented a reduction," he said, "but that is being offset
by increases from others."</p>
<p>Prices began falling Tuesday night in the U.S. cash market
and then continued declining as trading opened yesterday in
Asia, the Middle East and then in Europe. Spot prices of
Middle East and North Sea crudes were down between 45 cents
and 85 cents a barrel. On London's International Petroleum
Exchange, Brent blend crude oil futures closed 38 to 48 cents
lower.</p>
<p>The price fall came full circle by the time yesterday's
futures trading opened in the U.S. The July crude contract
opened 32 cents a barrel lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, and some traders worried that the plunge would
carry the Merc crude, near $20 a barrel less than two weeks
ago, down to as low as $17.</p>
<p>The July contract did briefly fall through the technically
important level of $18 a barrel, but recovered a bit before
trading ended. It settled at $18.14, down 78 cents. The
August contract ended at $18.77 a barrel, down 65 cents.</p>
<p>There were reports in the oil industry that Saudi
officials, who stubbornly resist any indication that the
kingdom may be returning to its old role of OPEC's so-called
swing producer, will soon grow impatient with Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates and others who had pledged to curtail
output also. The guessing yesterday was that the Saudis, now
apparently back down to their quota of 5.4 million barrels a
day, would expand production again to recapture their
traditional share of nearly 24.5% of OPEC output within two
or three weeks unless it's clear others have begun to reduce
output.</p>
<p>Also affecting the oil market was speculation among some
traders that the Saudis may be selling large amounts of oil
from their above-ground inventories even though they have cut
back on wellhead production. Some linked this to reports the
Saudis also were selling gold. The theory, still unconfirmed,
is that "they are selling oil and gold to get the dollars to
buy British pounds" to help pay for their multibillion-dollar
arms deal with Britain, according to Peter Beutel of Elders
Futures Inc., New York.</p>
<p>Further adding to the worries over the oil glut, meantime,
was word that the Trans-Panama pipeline, which carries
Alaskan crude across the Isthmus, had to be closed
temporarily because storage tanks were filled at either end.</p>
<p>Many in the oil industry expect OPEC to react to the price
fall with further statements that its production is coming
down. But some questioned whether such statements will any
longer be enough to stop the fall in oil prices. "The people
in the industry who are dealing with physical barrels are
going to wait for actual figures," said Neil Chandi,
president, Crescent International Petroleum Ltd.</p>
<p>Still, there were hints yesterday that the heavy flow of
oil from OPEC may be starting to taper off, if ever so
slightly. The volume of oil currently on the water in tankers
still is "extremely high" for this time of the year, said Roy
Mason, who tracks such shipments in a Britain-based
publication called Oil Afloat. "But, on the other hand, the
movement from {OPEC} loading ports is clearly on the way
down," he said, noting that neither Iran nor Saudi Arabia has
entered the spot tanker market in three weeks.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Futures prices closed mixed as early
rallies in many contract months died out or reversed
themselves on reports that the Soviet Union may not be
granted most-favored-nation trading status at the
U.S.-U.S.S.R. summit meeting beginning next Wednesday.
Heavier-than-expected rains across portions of Iowa and
southern Minnesota, reviving fears that some farmers may not
get their crops planted early enough this year, helped
support futures prices early in the session. In the final
hour of trading yesterday, Secretary of State James Baker was
quoted by wire services as saying he doubted the Soviet Union
would be granted most-favored-nation status during the summit
because it apparently won't be able to pass a law encouraging
Jewish emigration by that time. Unfettered emigration of
Soviet Jews is a prerequisite of granting most-favored-nation
status.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices eased. The July delivery ended with
a loss of 1.10 cents a pound at $1.1505. Improving labor
conditions and rising supplies contributed to the decline, an
analyst said. He noted that inventories of copper in
warehouses of the Commodity Exchange rose 1,177 tons to
10,169 tons. It was the third consecutive day of increases
and a three-month high for the supplies. The settlement of a
new labor contract by Kennecott Corp. and the United
Steelworkers removed some concern over possible supply
disruptions that could have resulted if no agreement had been
reached when the current contract expires on June 30.
However, the analyst noted, there still remain two other
American producers that have to negotiate new labor
contracts, and uncertainty would increase again if the talks
are prolonged.</p>
<p>COTTON: The July contract ended with a narrow gain after
profit-taking trimmed early advances. July finished 0.08 cent
a pound higher at 79.85 cents, but earlier had traded at
81.30 cents, a new life-of-contract high for the second
consecutive day. However, one analyst noted, buying lacked
follow-through "because cotton at over 81 cents seems
expensive" and traders decided to take profits.</p>
