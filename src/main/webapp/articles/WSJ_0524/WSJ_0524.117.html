	<p class="article-leader">Ranks Hovis McDougall PLC reported a slim 0.2% rise in
pretax profit for the six months to March 3 and warned that
full-year earnings are unlikely to match the record levels
attained last year.
   Pretax profit for the food group climbed to #81.7 million
($138.3 million) from #81.5 million the previous year, below
the range of market expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>RHM cited increased competition and a 60% surge in
interest costs as factors that eroded profit. As well, the
group said weather conditions in the U.K. hurt consumer
spending. "The hot summer of 1989 adversely affected
consumers' spending patterns on food, and the return to more
normal expenditure was delayed by the mild winter," RHM said.</p>
