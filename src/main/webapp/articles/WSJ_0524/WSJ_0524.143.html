	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of New England Corp. named Kent Price, a
former Citicorp executive, as chief financial officer,
continuing the management shake-up at the troubled bank.
   Mr. Price, 46 years old, will be responsible for, among
other things, the continued downsizing of the bank holding
company, including the sale of its Maine and Rhode Island
banking operations. He will succeed David Payne, who has been
chief financial officer and is taking early retirement in
July.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At least a half-dozen top executives have left the bank in
recent months as its financial difficulties have mounted.</p>
<p>Mr. Price, who is finishing up chores as chief operating
officer and chief financial officer for Barr Rosenberg
Investment Management in Orinda, Calif., has already started
work at the bank's headquarters in Boston.</p>
<p>Prior to a one-year stint at Barr Rosenberg, Mr. Price
spent much of the past two decades overseas. He worked for
Citicorp for 12 years, heading numerous foreign operations.
Four years ago he left Citicorp to take hold of the reins of
Chloride, an industrial and electronics concern experiencing
financial difficulty. "It was a turnaround situation and I
was responsible for reducing the size of that company from
about $1.2 billion to $600 million to $700 million," Mr.
Price said in an interview.</p>
<p>Analysts viewed Mr. Price's appointment as a positive
move, but noted that the bank's future in large part depends
on the length and depth of the current economic slump in New
England. Bank of New England, among the most aggressive banks
in the region in the 1980s, posted a loss of $1.11 billion
last year, largely because of problem real estate loans.</p>
