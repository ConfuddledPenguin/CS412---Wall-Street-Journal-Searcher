	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it plans
to launch in January a Latin American and Caribbean version
of its Turner Network Television entertainment station.
   The planned network, code-named "TNT South" by Turner
executives, is part of the growing globalization of U.S.
cable networks. Turner's Cable News Network already reaches
viewers all over the world; and other cable channels,
including MTV and ESPN, are distributed in Europe and Japan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Scott Sassa, TNT's executive vice president, said the new
channel will include TNT's regular fare of old movies,
theatrical cartoons and documentaries, subtitled in Spanish.
Eventually, he said Turner hopes to beam multiple sound and
subtitle tracks with its video images, so that viewers will
be able to see TNT in English, Spanish or Portuguese.</p>
<p>Mr. Sassa said TNT South will consist of a single
eight-hour block of programming, which will be repeated with
slight variations, three times a day. The satellite feed will
be downloaded by cable operators, direct-broadcast satellite
services and hotels, who will distribute it to viewers. Mr.
Sassa said TNT South is costing Turner "considerably less" to
launch than the $30 million it spent on TNT, but he wouldn't
elaborate. He said Turner expects to break even on TNT South
in three to five years.</p>
<p>"We view this as the first step toward establishing a
world-wide entertainment network," Mr. Sassa added.</p>
