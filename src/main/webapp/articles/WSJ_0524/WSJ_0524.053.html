	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Although Monopoly -- money prices paid by
Japanese collectors hogged the headlines, at the recent round
of art auctions here many works failed to pass "Go." Fueled
by Japanese money, sales of contemporary, impressionist and
modern art at Sotheby's and Christie's May 7-18 brought a
record total of $890 million (3% above November's sales), but
a number of other lots sold below expectations -- or didn't
sell at all.
   Problems were most evident in the area of contemporary
art, where both houses posted high unsold rates of around
35%. Later in the week, the evening impressionist sale at
Christie's was 30% unsold, while Sotheby's did better -- its
record $286 million evening sale was 83% sold. These uneven
results reflect no real market downturn, but some buyer
resistance to relentlessly bullish auction estimates.
Auction-house experts hastened to declare it all a healthy
sign: "Stabilization will be good for everyone," said David
Nash, head of fine arts at Sotheby's. "We think it's good for
the market not to continue to grow at the same rate."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nobody seemed to mind, however, when on May 15 at
Christie's, before a stunned capacity crowd, van Gogh's
"Portrait of Dr. Gachet" sold to Ryoei Saito, a 74-year-old
Japanese paper-processing magnate, for $82.5 million,
eclipsing the record price for any work of art at auction by
more than $28 million. Two nights later at Sotheby's, the
same buyer paid $78.1 million for Renoir's "Au Moulin de la
Galette." Mr. Saito's total outlay for the two works --
$160.6 million -- equals roughly the entire impressionist
sale week total at Christie's as recently as 1988.</p>
<p>The van Gogh and Renoir paintings are considered to be in
a class by themselves, representing the highest possible
quality and desirability. The portrait of Dr. Gachet, van
Gogh's doctor and friend, was painted only weeks before the
artist took his own life in 1890, and seems to epitomize his
losing struggle with the pain of human existence. Consigned
by the estate of banker and philanthropist Siegfried
Kramarsky, the painting had been on loan to the Metropolitan
Museum since 1984. "Au Moulin de la Galette," an atmospheric
depiction of an open-air Parisian dance hall, was painted in
1876 and is one of the most famous images in impressionist
art. The seller was Mrs. John Hay (Jock) Whitney, who bought
it in 1929 for $165,000.</p>
<p>The two records were a psychological shot in the arm for
market watchers concerned about the contemporary sales' poor
showing earlier in the week: The sale totals of May 7-8 at
Christie's were 20% below its low estimates, and at Sotheby's
the two-day total was a third below expectations. The sales
did set 20 artist's records, including $2.53 million paid by
a Japanese dealer for "Abstract Painting" by Ad Reinhardt at
Sotheby's (the old record was less than $400,000). Notable
failures included "Woman as Landscape" by Willem de Kooning,
unclaimed at Sotheby's at estimates of $9 million-$12
million.</p>
<p>Observers agree that the more volatile contemporary market
has lost some of the speculator and investor money that
pushed up last season's prices, and caused this season's
consignors to demand damagingly high estimates and reserves.
"1955-D" by Clyfford Still, for example, sold at Christie's
for a record $1.1 million -- almost $2 million less than its
low estimate. As London dealer Leslie Waddington observes:
"Some of these estimates were 50% above retail prices. You
could buy better pictures at dealers in New York for less. In
fact, I did."</p>
<p>After the contemporary sales, auction experts scurried to
salvage their real cash crop -- the big-ticket impressionist
and modern works coming next -- by suggesting to nervous
sellers that their more optimistic reserves be lowered. But
in some cases such bargaining was not possible: The price was
literally guaranteed. If a guaranteed work or collection
fails to bring the etched-in-stone minimum price, the auction
house pays anyway, effectively transferring ownership to
itself.</p>
<p>After denouncing guarantees as ruinous to the neutrality
of the auction process, Christie's went ahead and gave one to
get five major paintings from the Robert Lehman Collection,
including "Autoportrait" by van Gogh, which sold comfortably
within estimates at $26.4 million to the unidentified
European collector who underbid "Dr. Gachet."</p>
<p>Sotheby's guaranteed several works being "de-accessioned"
from the Art Institute of Chicago and the Guggenheim Museum.
The three exceptional Guggenheim pictures sold above
expectations for a total of $47.3 million. Tokyo chain-store
owner Masco Wanibuchi paid a new record price for Wassily
Kandinsky, $20.9 million for "Fugue." Other guaranteed
property, including some from the Art Institute, barely
limped into estimate ranges, leading to speculation that
Sotheby's might be out some money there.</p>
<p>Prices were strong for property from the estate of Lydia
Winston Malbin, daughter of Detroit industrial architect
Albert Kahn, and a well-respected collector for many years.
The Malbin Collection, which had a May 16 evening sale all to
itself, was heavy on Italian futurism, a short-lived early
20th-century movement that produced a number of stunning
works of art. The collection, which included a number of
high-quality non-futurist work as well, brought $74.3 million
-- close to its projected high estimate. "The Stairway of
Farewells" by Giacomo Balla, circa 1908, was the top futurist
lot, selling to a European private collector at $4.4 million.
Few Americans and only one Japanese buyer participated, while
a large group of European bidders reclaimed rare works by
their countrymen, unavailable to the market for many decades.</p>
<p>Those European buyers can thank the American tax code,
which since 1986 has drastically reduced the advantages of
giving art to public institutions. Traditional museum patrons
such as Malbin, Whitney, Kramarsky and Lehman increasingly
have gone the auction route, leaving American museums to
cannibalize their own collections to buy what is no longer
being given.</p>
<p>The Guggenheim, for example, in a controversial decision,
sold the three early 20th-century paintings at Sotheby's to
raise funds for the acquisition of a minimalist art
collection. These auctions alone included tens of millions of
dollars of art deaccessioned from eight different museums,
and hundreds of million dollars more of might-have-beens that
never made it to public collections at all. Says Samuel
Sachs, director of the Detroit Institute of Arts: "I'm not
sure Congress knows or cares what irreparable damage is being
wreaked on American museums."</p>
<p>But even if the tax laws are amended, Americans with
collections to donate may be rare. Forty percent of Sotheby's
impressionist lots went to Japanese buyers, who accounted for
more than 50% of the dollar value of both impressionist
sales. "My Japanese clientele has gone up 80%," says London
dealer Thomas Gibson. "None of us realizes how vast the
Japanese market is." Maybe not, but we began to get the
picture when a hitherto unknown Tokyo businessman spends
$160.6 million on two paintings in a total of eight minutes.</p>
<p>Tracking Japanese buying patterns obviously is key, and
auction observers see some changes: Unlike the last time
around, Renoirs and Pissarros of lesser interest and inflated
estimates went unsold. Japanese bidders pursued
better-quality impressionist material, while continuing to
exhibit a growing interest in works of the 20th century.
Maseo Wanabuchi, for example, bought the top contemporary lot
at Christie's -- paying a record $6.05 million for "The Kiss"
by Roy Lichtenstein. "The number of Japanese buying
indifferent pictures has shrunk," says New York dealer
Richard Feigen. "They have become more sophisticated."</p>
<p>With the powerful Japanese learning fast, and buyers with
more limited resources already balking at some over-ambitious
estimates, Christie's President Christopher Burge
acknowledges that "average pictures have been struggling."
Quality once again is the name of the game: Knowing how to
get it is a pre-requisite for successful play, and that takes
time, work, dedication and talent . . . or $82.5 million,
whichever comes first.</p>
