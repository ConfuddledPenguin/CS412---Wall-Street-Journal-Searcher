	<p class="article-leader">A dissident shareholder filed suit, demanding that
Builders Transport Inc. set a date for the company's annual
meeting.
   The holder, David C. Walentas, filed the suit in Delaware
Chancery Court. Mr. Walentas and Stanford M. Dinstein,
another holder, hold a total of roughly 6.8% of the Camden,
S.C., trucking company's 4.9 million shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In February, Builders Transport signed a non-binding
letter of intent to be acquired for $15 a share, or $73.6
million, by closely held Comcar Industries Inc., an
Auburndale, Fla., trucking company. In December, Builders
Transport rebuffed a $13-a-share offer from the two
shareholders.</p>
<p>Mr. Walentas intends to solicit proxies at the annual
meeting in an effort to replace the board, said Jonathan
Wagner, attorney for Mr. Walentas.</p>
<p>The company hasn't scheduled the annual meeting because it
is reviewing another takeover proposal it received from Trism
Inc., the Joplin, Mo., parent of trucking firm Tri-State
Motor Transit Inc. of Delaware, said Robert E. Lee Garner,
Builders Transport's general counsel and corporate secretary.
Trism has proposed to pay $14 cash plus $3 of preferred stock
for each Builders Transport share.</p>
<p>The company has sued Mr. Walentas in federal court in
Columbia, S.C., charging him with violating securities laws;
Mr. Walentas has countersued to invalidate an employee stock
ownership plan.</p>
