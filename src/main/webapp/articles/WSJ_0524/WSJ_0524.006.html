	<p class="article-leader">An episode during Secretary of State James Baker's
arms-control negotiating spree in Moscow last week aptly
captures the spirit of his visit -- and exemplifies what is
wrong with the Bush administration's strategy.
   On Friday Mr. Baker delivered the latest in a series of
American snubs to the democratic government of Lithuania. For
two hours, he stood up Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene,
whose country's program -- if implemented by like-minded
reformers throughout the Soviet Union -- threatens to
undermine Soviet military power in much the same way that the
rise of East European democrats has made a hollow shell of
the Warsaw Pact.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Instead, Mr. Baker extended his meeting with President
Mikhail Gorbachev, a man who seems determined to prevent just
such a radical dismantling of Soviet might. According to
press reports, at the appointed hour for his session with
Mrs. Prunskiene, the secretary was proposing a variety of
"breakthroughs," in a desperate bid to "lock up" arms-control
deals affecting strategic nuclear weapons, conventional
forces, chemical arms and nuclear testing prior to next
week's Bush-Gorbachev summit in Washington.</p>
<p>Just as Mr. Baker has failed to grasp that the U.S. lack
of support for Lithuania dramatically reduces the pressure
for radical political reform in Moscow, he seems equally
unaware that the arms-control agreements he personally has
done so much to shape will preserve -- if not improve --
Soviet military capabilities vis-a-vis the U.S. This result
is all too predictable given the structural problems,
verification shortcomings and asymmetrical technological
effects of the incipient accords:</p>
<p>Strategic Arms Reduction Talks: The primary purpose of the
START Treaty is the substantial reduction of
intercontinental-range nuclear arms. Obtaining such cuts
became an "idee fixe" under the Reagan administration, which
came to office critical of its Democratic predecessor's
inability to negotiate a SALT II accord that went beyond
simply limiting the further growth of Moscow's nuclear
buildup.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, along the way -- particularly under the
Bush administration -- the objective of reducing the size of
the Kremlin's strategic arsenal became an end in itself,
supplanting the ostensible goal of enhancing the U.S.
deterrent at lower force levels. As a result, the START
Treaty, as negotiated by Mr. Baker, is likely to give rise to
an even larger ratio of Soviet weapons available to attack a
diminishing number of American targets.</p>
<p>Moreover, the START Treaty is seriously deficient from a
verification standpoint. At next week's summit, Mr. Bush is
expected to sign a "framework agreement" on strategic arms
that immediately commits the U.S. to cutting programs and
budgets, but leaves crucial decisions on verification for
later.</p>
<p>It is apparent from the emerging framework agreement that
the treaty will include provisions that will make a nightmare
of attempts to verify Soviet compliance; some may actually
invite Soviet cheating. Particularly noteworthy was Mr.
Baker's capitulation last September to Soviet demands that
the U.S. drop its proposal to ban mobile intercontinental
ballistic missiles. Moscow wants to keep at least 1,200 such
ICBMs. With this legal infrastructure, it would have the
potential to support a far larger, covertly deployed mobile
ICBM force. For budgetary and operational reasons, the U.S.
isn't likely to have a comparable legitimate system, to say
nothing of an illegal inventory.</p>
<p>START also exemplifies another pernicious effect of
arms-control agreements: They tend to have a disproportional
effect upon the area in which the U.S. has the greatest
advantage -- quality. For example, the constraints Mr. Baker
agreed to last week will limit the number and/or range of
technologically sophisticated U.S. air-and sea-launched
cruise missiles.</p>
<p>The same insidious effect can also result from executive
or legislative branch actions taken to curb activities that
could impinge upon implied treaty commitments. In that
regard, it is very likely that the agreement reached between
Mr. Baker and Mr. Gorbachev to exempt from START the current
version of an extremely promising non-nuclear cruise missile
system, called Tacit Rainbow, will be implemented by the U.S.
government in such a way as to preclude potentially important
modifications or derivatives.</p>
<p>Conventional Forces in Europe: Similar problems beset the
effort to negotiate reductions in NATO and Warsaw Pact forces
in Europe. From a structural standpoint, even a treaty
designed to produce essentially equal levels of American and
Soviet troops and equipment will not correct an underlying
inequality -- namely, the geographic and strategic
asymmetries arising from the Soviet Union's proximity to the
European theater on the one hand and the large ocean barrier
separating the U.S. from its allies on the other.</p>
<p>The CFE Treaty also faces an array of extraordinary
verification problems, none of which was addressed by Mr.
Baker in Moscow. Not the least of these concerns is the
monitoring of Soviet personnel and aircraft, which could be
reinserted at will from territory outside the agreement's
purview. The CFE accord could also exacerbate the already
considerable impetus on Capitol Hill to reduce the number,
quality and technological sophistication of U.S. conventional
forces in Europe.</p>
<p>The Soviets made it clear last week that they are
unwilling to negotiate further cuts in conventional arms at
this time. They stood by this position despite Mr. Baker's
reported offer of no fewer than six significant concessions
in the CFE area. Mr. Baker said yesterday that Mr. Bush will
press Mr. Gorbachev next week to revive negotiations to
remove tens of thousands of troops and tanks from Europe.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the Soviet intransigence: Mr.
Gorbachev believes that NATO is now in such disarray -- and
the U.S. is so obliged to disengage from the continent for
budgetary reasons -- that the need for a CFE agreement as an
instrument for reducing U.S. influence in Europe is much less
important than his need to preserve the Soviet military
presence in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>If so, it stands to reason that Mr. Gorbachev will
similarly seek to suspend or stretch out the much more
important troop reduction agreements now in various stages of
diplomatic evolution between Moscow and its erstwhile Warsaw
Pact allies. Insofar as such accords promise to accomplish
what CFE will not -- that is, the elimination of Soviet
forces from East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Bulgaria -- they are particularly susceptible to new
stonewalling by the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Chemical Weapons: As a first step toward negotiation of a
global ban on chemical arms, the U.S. and the Soviet Union
are expected to sign an accord next week requiring both sides
to destroy substantial parts (80% and 90%, respectively) of
declared, existing stockpiles of such weapons. The word
"declared" is key because no provision is made in the
agreement to establish whether the Soviets' announced
stockpiles conform to reality.</p>
<p>So deficient in this respect are the structural and
verification aspects of this accord that the administration
has taken an extraordinary step. Fearful that the pact could
not muster the two-thirds majority required for the Senate's
consent to a treaty, it will instead submit the document as
an executive agreement -- the approval of which requires only
a simple majority in both houses of Congress. This is a very
dangerous precedent for the even more unverifiable
multilateral ban on chemical weapons now in preparation.</p>
<p>Moreover, the administration acceded to Soviet pressure to
terminate production of chemical munitions. This means that
the U.S. will be permanently precluded from updating its
deterrent capability.</p>
<p>It is bad enough that the U.S. has adopted such a
position, given that there are no provisions for verifying
that the Soviet Union will likewise refrain from producing
toxic chemical agents. It is, however, absolutely
irresponsible for it to do so in the face of evidence of
production and deployment of chemical weapons by countries
such as Libya, Syria and Iraq.</p>
<p>Nuclear Testing Protocol: Finally, Mr. Baker used the
Moscow meeting to settle outstanding differences on a
protocol to the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT). This
protocol is supposed to improve the verifiability of the
earlier accord, which limits U.S. and Soviet underground
nuclear explosions to yields of 150 kilotons.</p>
<p>The real purpose of the protocol, however, is political.
It is designed to allow enthusiasts for still more
restrictive limitations on nuclear testing to aver that the
problems with monitoring the existing pact have been solved.
This would clear the way for negotiations to impose quotas
and/or reduced thresholds -- if not an outright ban -- on
such testing. As yesterday's revelations about safety
problems with certain nuclear weapons makes clear, it is
difficult enough to maintain a safe and effective deterrent
even under the current underground testing regime. Should
such testing be denied, however, matters would become
infinitely worse.</p>
<p>The testing procedures and mechanical arrangements
stipulated in the protocol, nominally in the interest of
facilitating verification, will impose significant new
constraints on the U.S. use of testing as a means of
improving the effectiveness of its nuclear and non-nuclear
military systems. Indeed, it appears that the Soviets have
been particularly successful in this area in using an
arms-control negotiation to constrain U.S. experimental
activities vital to its technological superiority.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Despite such serious flaws, all of these arms-control
agreements -- with the possible exception of understandings
on conventional forces -- are virtually sure to be initialed
at next week's summit. Having invested as much political
capital and personal prestige in arms negotiations as they
have, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Baker is likely to let
problems with the substance of the agreements or criticism of
their diplomacy interfere with the opportunity for a
"successful" summit.</p>
<p>There is, however, a viable alternative to pursuing
traditional arms-control agreements with Moscow: The top
priority of the U.S. should be in joining forces with those
in Lithuania, Azerbaijan, Georgia and elsewhere who seek a
dismantling of the political and economic apparatus that
constitutes the real source of the Soviet threat. If the
Soviet Union's totalitarian and centralized system can be
supplanted with a democratic, free-enterprise one, a sure and
effective control on Moscow's military will be put into
place. That would be far better than any arms agreement.</p>
