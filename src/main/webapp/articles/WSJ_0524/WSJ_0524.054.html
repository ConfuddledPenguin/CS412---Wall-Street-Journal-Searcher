	<p class="article-leader">An air-fare war spread rapidly across the country
yesterday, and industry analysts said it might hurt the
carrier that started it, UAL Corp.'s United Airlines.
   Major carriers, including AMR Corp.'s American Airlines,
USAir Group Inc.'s USAir, NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines, Pan
Am Corp.'s Pan American World Airways, Delta Air Lines and
Midway Airlines said they are matching a surprise fare cut
announced by Trans World Airlines late Tuesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But American and Pan Am said they don't intend to honor
$35 discount coupons that United has been advertising widely
since Monday. TWA said it won't honor the coupons on its
newly discounted fares. To stay competitive, airlines often
accept a rival's coupon. United's coupon is valid for the
discount on a round-trip fare of $175 or more.</p>
<p>United, as architect of the discount coupons, may have
outsmarted itself. As travelers can use the coupons to cut
prices of already reduced fares, analysts believe United,
which also said it is matching TWA's fare cuts, might be
forced to fly people for less than it ever anticipated.</p>
<p>Though some of the other carriers said they will accept
the coupons, United is still most likely to redeem the bulk
of them. The airline blitzed cities with full-page
advertisements reading: "Tear out, then take off."</p>
<p>"The other airlines can really stick it to United," Rick
Boubelik, former staff vice president, revenue development,
at Braniff Inc., said. "United will have the biggest exposure
of potential revenue loss during the peak season. They
shouldn't be playing these games during the summer." United
declined to comment on the financial effects of the fare
discounting.</p>
<p>TWA said its fare cuts were triggered by United's coupon
promotion. But United claimed it didn't instigate the battle.
Instead, it pointed the finger at direct-mail campaigns by
rivals. "We were responding to the distribution of millions
of coupons by our competitors," a United spokesman said.</p>
<p>Among those, New York-based Citicorp, a banking giant, has
been mailing a promotion in which credit-card holders get
coupons that give $25 off the price of a ticket or a free
companion ticket on American Airlines, one of United's
fiercest domestic rivals.</p>
<p>Other carriers such as Midway, TWA and Texas Air Corp.'s
Continental Airlines unit are hyping similar marketing
tie-ins.</p>
<p>It is difficult to estimate how many mailings have been
issued in recent weeks and how deep the discounts are that
they offer. But even if they are widespread, such promotions
have long been a mainstay in the industry, and it isn't clear
whether United overreacted to them.</p>
<p>For consumers bruised by high air fares, the United coupon
offer is attractive. The $35 discount is valid for tickets
purchased through Aug. 31 and for travel through Dec. 14.
Aimed at vacation travelers, the coupons can only be used for
fares purchased at least seven days before departure.</p>
<p>United's exposure might be lessened slightly, because its
ad campaign was short-lived. The company said the campaign
ended yesterday, after only three days. Fliers aren't allowed
to use photocopies of the coupons. The United spokesman
asserted the campaign wasn't cut shorter than planned.</p>
<p>TWA's fare cuts are a quick hit, as well. Tickets have to
be purchased by June 7, though they also are good for travel
through Dec. 14. They require seven days advance purchase,
and have other restrictions that make the fares attractive
mostly to vacationers.</p>
<p>The discounts are steeper than initially believed. For
example, the least expensive round-trip fare between Dallas
and Los Angeles plunged 46% to $198 from $364, and could be
reduced further to $163 using United's coupon, bringing the
saving to 55%.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
UAL shares closed at $153.25, up $1.75.</p>
