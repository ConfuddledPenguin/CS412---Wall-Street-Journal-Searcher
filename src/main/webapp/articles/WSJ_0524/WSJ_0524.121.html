	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In a decision that could trigger new
wrangling over the remains of the Hunt oil fortune, a U.S.
Tax Court judge here ruled that brothers Lamar Hunt, William
Herbert Hunt and Nelson Bunker Hunt don't owe $314 million in
additional federal income taxes for 1982.
   The Internal Revenue Service case against the Hunts, which
was heard last summer, involved a partnership they
established to refinance the huge debts resulting from their
speculation in the 1979-1980 silver market. The IRS claimed
the partnership was an elaborate ruse used by the brothers to
avoid paying taxes on a loan they never repaid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But in a lengthy decision, Judge Jules G. Korner III sided
with the Hunts, ruling that the partnership was valid. He
also criticized IRS tactics, such as last-minute subpoenaing
of numerous bank officials, calling it an effort to "cast an
all-encompassing net in the search for information with which
to build a case."</p>
<p>An IRS spokesman said the government hadn't decided
whether to appeal the tax court decision. Federal attorneys
involved in the case couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
