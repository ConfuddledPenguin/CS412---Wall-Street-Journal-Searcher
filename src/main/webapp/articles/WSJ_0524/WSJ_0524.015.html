	<p class="article-leader">FAIRFIELD, Conn. -- General Electric Co. said it settled
its suit against Daimler-Benz AG that had charged the West
German company with breaking its agreement to jointly develop
a new generation of jet engines.
   Under the settlement, GE said it will get additional
revenue from their existing long-term programs with
Daimler-Benz on engines that generate 50,000 to 75,000 pounds
of thrust. These engines are used in Boeing 747, the Airbus
A310 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11 airplanes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GE, however, agreed to end its agreement with Daimler on
developing the next generation of engines with 85,000 to
95,000 pounds of thrust, the so-called GE90 engines.</p>
<p>GE sued Daimler-Benz last April when, it alleged, the
German concern's Motorenund Turbinen-Union unit, known as
MTU, broke the agreement with GE and entered into "a
memorandum of understanding" with United Technologies Corp.
to pursue a wide range of commercial engine programs.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, MTU will destroy all
proprietary information it has on the GE90 engine. MTU will
be free to proceed with its agreement with United
Technologies' Pratt & Whitney unit to develop the PW4000
engine, which will compete with GE90.</p>
<p>GE declined to say how much additional revenue it will
receive as a result of the renegotiated terms on existing
long-term contracts with MTU. But an official familiar with
the settlement estimated the amount to be "several hundred
million dollars" over 10 to 15 years.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
