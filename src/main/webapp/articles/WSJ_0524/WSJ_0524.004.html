	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- West German business bankruptcies dropped 8.6% in
the first quarter of 1990 from year-earlier levels,
continuing a trend of declining insolvencies that began in
1986, the Wiesbaden-based Federal Statistics Office said.
   The number of business bankruptcies fell to 2,321 during
the quarter from 2,540 a year earlier. The total number of
insolvencies, which includes businesses and individuals,
dropped 7.6% to 3,529 from 3,819 a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Statistics Office official said the declining numbers
are probably illustrative of the improving economic climate
in West Germany. He added that the average size of the
insolvencies has been shrinking steadily because fewer big
companies are going bankrupt.</p>
