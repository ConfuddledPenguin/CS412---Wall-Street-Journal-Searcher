	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- A retired executive of Consumers' Gas Co. said
he plans to lead an effort to acquire the company, if he can
persuade regulators to prevent its proposed acquisition by
British Gas PLC for 1.1 billion Canadian dollars (US$927
million).
   F. Warren Hurst, the retired official, said he formed a
private company, ProNational Gas Inc., which filed an
objection to the acquisition plan with the Ontario Energy
Board. The ProNational intervention argues that an
acquisition of Canada's largest gas utility by a foreign
concern wouldn't be in the public and customers' interests.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Hurst said he hasn't tried to raise financing, because
there isn't any assurance the Ontario board will reject the
British Gas proposal. GW Utilities Ltd., which is controlled
by the Reichmann family of Toronto, already has agreed to
tender its 82% stake in Consumers' Gas to the British Gas
offer. GW Utilities officials weren't available to comment on
Mr. Hurst's announcement.</p>
<p>The Ontario board is expected to hold hearings on the
takeover bid next month. If it rejects the application by
British Gas, Mr. Hurst said, ProNational will seek to raise
short-term financing for a bid with the same C$34-a-share
terms to be offered under the British company's proposal. He
said ProNational would then resell most of the shares to
Consumers' Gas's customers and other parties.</p>
<p>Mr. Hurst, 64 years old, was chief financial officer of
Consumers' Gas until 1971 and a director until 1973. He
described himself as semi-retired, but remains on several
boards. He said he has other partners in ProNational, but
declined to name them.</p>
<p>Mr. Hurst's announcement didn't hurt stock prices:
Consumers' Gas shares rose 37.5 Canadian cents yesterday, to
close at C$31.125 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. GW Utilities
shares closed at $28.50, down 12.5 cents, in American Stock
Exchange composite trading.</p>
