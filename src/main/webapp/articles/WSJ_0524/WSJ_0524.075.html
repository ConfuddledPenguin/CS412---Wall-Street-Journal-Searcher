	<p class="article-leader">New evidence was reported that a long-ignored form of
cholesterol in the blood may be capable of causing coronary
heart disease and heart attacks.
   The new finding is likely to be important in doctors'
decisions on which drugs to use to lower high cholesterol
levels in certain patients. The form of cholesterol involved
isn't affected much by drugs similar to Merck & Co.'s
big-selling Mevacor but is susceptible to some cheaper, older
drugs like niacin and neomycin.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The little-known form of cholesterol is lipoprotein (a) or
simply Lp(a). It is different from the widely publicized
LDL-cholesterol, commonly called the "bad" cholesterol
because it is known to cause coronary heart disease, and
HDL-cholesterol, often called the "good" cholesterol because
it is thought to protect against coronary disease.</p>
<p>Lp(a), like the other forms of cholesterol, is a small
packet of fat and cholesterol enwrapped by a protein. The
protein is what allows the watery part of the blood to grab
the insoluble fat and cholesterol and transport it through
the body. The combined packets of all the forms are known as
lipoproteins.</p>
<p>Lp(a) was discovered in the blood in 1960 by Scandinavian
researchers who suggested at the time that high levels of
Lp(a) might indicate a high risk of a heart attack. It wasn't
until the mid-1980s, however, that other researchers began
finding a correlation between Lp(a) and coronary heart
disease, the clogging of the arteries with fatty deposits
that leads to a heart attack.</p>
<p>In a new study, British scientists said they measured
Lp(a) levels in 115 patients who had inherited a genetic
defect that produces a high level of blood cholesterol. The
54 patients who had developed obvious coronary heart disease
had Lp(a) levels considerably higher than the 61 patients who
hadn't developed coronary disease, scientists from the
Charing Cross and Westminister Medical School in London
reported in this week's New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>The patients all had inherited a condition known as
familial hypercholesterolemia, known to be caused by a
defective gene called the FH gene. The patients had inherited
one defective copy of the FH gene and their total blood
cholesterol levels were two to three times higher than
normal.</p>
<p>Until now, the coronary heart disease seen in such
patients has been blamed on their exceedingly high levels of
the LDL form of cholesterol. But the British researchers said
that in their study, the patients' level of Lp(a) cholesterol
was a better gauge than the LDL level in distinguishing which
patients developed coronary disease and which remained free
of the artery-clogging.</p>
<p>Equally important, the researchers said they found there
are differences in the type of Lp(a) cholesterol in the
blood, reflecting genetic differences among the patients. Two
genetically determined types of Lp(a) were much more common
among the patients with coronary disease than among those
without coronary disease. This suggested that the type of
Lp(a) that presumably causes coronary disease is inherited.</p>
<p>The researchers noted that the FH patients usually are
treated for their high LDL levels with Mevacor-like drugs and
drugs similar to Upjohn Co.'s colestipol or Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co.'s cholestyramine. These drugs, however, have
little effect on Lp(a) levels, which are better lowered by
older and cheaper drugs like niacin and neomycin, sold by a
number of companies under their generic names.</p>
