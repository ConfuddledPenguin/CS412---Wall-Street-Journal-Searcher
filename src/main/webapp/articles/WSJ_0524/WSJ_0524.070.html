	<p class="article-leader">REDWOOD SHORES, Calif. -- Oracle Corp., a unit of Oracle
Systems Corp., said it reached a joint marketing agreement
with Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., to promote
Oracle accounting software with Digital computers.
   Oracle declined to estimate the potential financial effect
of the agreement. The companies hope to benefit from a trend
of users increasingly performing accounting tasks on personal
computers and networks, as opposed to large mainframe
machines.</p>
