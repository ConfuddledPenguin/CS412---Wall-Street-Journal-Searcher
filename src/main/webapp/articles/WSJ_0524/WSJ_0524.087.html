	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Lawrence Brothers Inc. and Chairman John A.
Lawrence denied any wrongdoing in connection with
price-fixing charges filed against them and other makers of
architectural hinges.
   The Sterling, Ill., company and the executive were among
nine defendants, including the New Britain, Conn., tool maker
Stanley Works, that were indicted by a federal grand jury in
St. Louis recently.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stanley Works and the president of its Stanley Hardware
division, Richard G. Martin, have said they would fight the
charges. An attorney for John F. Hollfelder, a former vice
president of sales for the Stanley division, declined
comment.</p>
<p>An attorney for Hager Hinge Co. of St. Louis said the
company "has been aware of the investigation and has been
working with the government since its very early stages."</p>
<p>Scranton, Pa.-based McKinney Products Co., its president,
David B. Gibson, and a former president of McKinney, Robert
A. Haversat, declined to comment. Mr. Haversat now is
president and chief executive officer at Esstar Inc., the New
Haven, Conn., parent of McKinney.</p>
<p>In July 1988, Stanley Works had said it had received a
subpoena from a federal grand jury investigating possible
antitrust violations in the architectural-hardware industry.</p>
