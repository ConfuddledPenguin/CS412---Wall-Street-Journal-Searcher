	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Midland Bank PLC is leading commercial-bank
talks with the Brazilian government to establish a $1.5
billion fund of bank claims that can be swapped into equity
in state-owned companies Brazil intends to transfer to
private hands.
   A spokesman for Midland -- its $2 billion in loans
outstanding to Brazil makes it the country's biggest British
banking creditor -- said the company has had "preliminary
discussions" with Brazilian officials about the fund. The
bank hopes to reach a preliminary accord in the next few
months, prior to a September launch. Chase Manhattan Corp.,
New York, and Bank of Tokyo are among the banks considering
joining the fund as sponsors, Midland said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The discussions come as Brazil, pursuing its bold
anti-inflation program, prepares to resume negotiations on
its $115 billion foreign debt and mount its drive to sell
state companies. Brazil hasn't paid interest on its $65
billion of medium-term and long-term bank debt since
September.</p>
