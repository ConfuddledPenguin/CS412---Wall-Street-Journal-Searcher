Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s April 23 editorial-page article on
ethnic studies falsely implies that the teaching of American
history has been based on honesty and accuracy. After earning
three degrees from an American university, I am more
convinced than ever that history has always been taught as a
means of promoting group self-esteem. For example, Winston
Churchill is presented as a great man, despite the fact that
he favored colonialism -- England's policy of exploiting and
enslaving non-Europeans.
   I am in full agreement with Mr. Schlesinger that
"Novelists, moralists, politicians, fabulators . . ." should
not go beyond historical evidence to tell inspiring stories.
I only ask that historians practice what they preach.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Two centuries ago when Hector St. John de Crevecoeur
observed that "individuals of all nations" in America "are
melted into a new race of man," the people from Africa were
not considered fully human, and the Indians were being
dispossessed of their land. What happened to historical
accuracy and objectivity?</p>
<p>The majority of humanity was excluded from Europe's desire
for "deliverance and assimilation." Immigrants from Europe
replaced their "ancient prejudices and manners" with racial
prejudices against native Indians and offspring from Africa.</p>
<p>Ethnic advocates of "bad history" and the manufacturers of
the "melting pot" myth are both enemies of the truth. The
artificial aspects of ethnic studies can be overcome with
intellectual honesty by all historians.</p>

<p>Mr. Schlesinger articulates so superbly that which deeply
concerns so many of us and which concern we attempt to
express, but for which, lamentably, we lack both Mr.
Schlesinger's skills and a forum with the credibility and
readership of The Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>Mr. Schlesinger promotes the self-esteem of white males by
espousing the same distorted history that has actively
excluded women, African-Americans, Hispanics, Asian-Americans
and Native Americans. He erroneously implies that white male
self-esteem suffers whenever the historical contributions of
other groups are included in the curriculum. The
contradiction of American history and American studies is the
need for Ethnic Studies. Mr. Schlesinger's schizophrenic
reaction to the melting pot is a symptom of the racism that
has perpetuated white male arrogance and group omissions in
the recorded history of this country.</p>

<p>Prof. Schlesinger's views on the current drive by
now-tenured '60s enragees to take over the American education
establishment are entirely what one expects from him: logic,
rationality and broad humanity; in short, liberalism at its
best. As such, unfortunately, they entirely misconceive "da
conditions dat prevail," as Jimmy Durante used to put it.
Sweet reasonableness will get nowhere in this matter because
it is not an academic, an intellectual or even a moral
question that confronts us but purely and simply a struggle
for power -- for jobs, money, control of budgets, and
ultimately the real estate and endowments of institutions.</p>
<p>That being the case, references to Emerson and Thoreau
will be about as effective as the expostulations of the
discomfited Romans to Brennus the Gaul, and will elicit the
same reply they got, "Vae victis," which for our purpose may
be translated "Oy veh]"</p>

<p>I was delighted to read about the need to resist the "cult
of ghettoization" and accept that all Americans, regardless
of origin, can be "melted into a new race of man." While a
student at Washington State and Northwestern universities, I
opposed the efforts of members of my race to promote "black
English," create race-specific intelligence tests and
overload my schedule with ethnic-studies classes, some of
which seemed to promote propaganda rather than serious
studies.</p>

<p>Mr. Schlesinger attempts to minimize Jewish contributions
to American history, along with the contributions of other
non-Christian and/or non-Anglo-Saxon ethnicities.</p>
<p>As a student in New York's public schools in the 1940s and
1950s, I learned almost nothing about Jewish contributions to
the founding of America and its development.</p>
<p>Fortunately, my parents enrolled me in a supplemental
evening Hebrew school. Then, as now, I could never figure out
why the Jewish historical content was omitted from the
public-school teachings. Why did we receive only a
white-bread view of American history?</p>
<p>Members of the Jewish faith were part of the Dutch trading
companies that established New Amsterdam. Each day, as I walk
from the ferry to my office in lower Manhattan, I pass
through South William Street. On the corner of Mill Lane and
South William, mounted on the side of an Italian bank
building, 1 William St., is a plaque noting that on this site
Jewish settlers built their homes in 1654. On the same
street, closer to Broad Street, there was until recently a
plaque commemorating the synagogue built by these early
settlers. It is difficult to accept that these people did not
contribute to, and help shape, early New York history.</p>
<p>And what about the role of Haim Solomon in the American
Revolution? Or Uriah P. Levi in later naval battles? Did not
they and others of the Jewish faith help shape the political,
social and economic direction of our country?</p>

<p>My forefathers were Americans a century before the family
of the president he once served, John F. Kennedy, came to
this great land. Yet, even at this time in our history having
a black serve as a state governor or as a party chairman or
as a general on the Joint Chiefs of Staff is still front-page
material.</p>
<p>Mr. Schlesinger quotes Israel Zangwill's vision of America
as the place "where all the races of Europe are melting and
reforming." My race is not of Europe, and my people's "horrid
past" came not in the old country, but on these shores.</p>
<p>I do not reject the powerful influences of Europe on
America, but I ask that the contributions of Africa, Asia and
South America be granted the light of day in America's
classrooms. I have been educated in a European fashion, I
speak three European languages and I have European
sensibilities, but my face reminds me that I am not European,
and my mind tells me that my non-European heritage counts for
more than a historical footnote along the lines of, "Africa
is the place where the slaves came from." Thanks to the
American classroom, I know more about Mr. Schlesinger's past
than I do my own, and I deserve more than that. I count, too.
I am an American.</p>
