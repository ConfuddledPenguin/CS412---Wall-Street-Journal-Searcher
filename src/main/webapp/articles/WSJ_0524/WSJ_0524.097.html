	<p class="article-leader">Five European and U.S. commercial aircraft makers said
they formed an "international study group" to explore
marketing, environmental and business issues related to
possible construction of an advanced supersonic airliner.
   But the U.S. participants, Boeing Co. and McDonnell
Douglas Corp., said the group members won't share proprietary
data or technology. "This is just a loose, ad hoc agreement
to discuss the ramifications of a new generation plane," said
a spokesman at Seattle-based Boeing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Two of the group participants, Aerospatiale of France and
British Aerospace PLC, whose predecessors built the
supersonic Concorde, recently teamed up to build a successor
to that plane that presumably would include technology
transfer. The fifth study group member is Deutsche Airbus
G.m.b.H. of West Germany.</p>
<p>"The intent {of the study group} is to see what the
world-wide needs might be after the year 2000 and how these
fit with the commercial fleet that would be operating then,"
said Don Graf, manager of St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas's
high-speed transport group. "Nothing unique to a particular
airplane" would be part of the one-year study, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Graf said the group also would consider such
environmental concerns as how engine emissions might affect
the atmosphere and noise pollution caused by sonic booms.
McDonnell Douglas, Boeing and the other participants will
continue their individual research, he said. But he didn't
rule out the possibility that the study might lead to
eventual joint cooperation among some or all of the companies
to build the next Concorde.</p>
<p>Analysts on both sides of the Atlantic were skeptical that
any international consortium would be forged at the end of
the one-year study, or that a new supersonic craft would get
off the ground anytime in the next decade. Environmental
restrictions have toughened, and fuel prices and capital
costs have risen since plans for a U.S. supersonic aircraft
were scrapped in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>The new study group "is a great opportunity to listen to
what your toughest competitors think," said Howard Rubel at
C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc. "I seriously doubt that
there will be an economically-viable project," in the next 10
to 15 years, said Paul Nisbet at Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.</p>
<p>None of the U.S. or European aircraft makers is likely to
try building a new supersonic aircraft without hefty
subsidies from their respective governments -- and government
money will be scarce. Announcement of the study may signal
the start of an industry lobbying campaign for cash in
Washington, Paris, Bonn and London, some European analysts
said.</p>
<p>The lobbying will be difficult. For the forseeable future,
Bonn will be too preoccupied by the costs of German
unification. And British government officials grumble that
the first-generation supersonic airline, Concorde, hasn't
been a financial success. U.S. budget makers are trying to
pare a ballooning deficit. Only the French government, which
heavily subsidizes aerospace research, is a likely source of
support for the consortium.</p>
