	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it raised the
rating on Washington Public Power Supply System's $6.3
billion of revenue bonds outstanding for WPPSS units 1, 2 and
3 to double-A from double-A-minus.
   The rating concern said it also upgraded to double-A from
double-A-minus $17.1 million of WPPSS bonds issued for the
Hanford generating project and $119 million of bonds issued
by the Eugene, Ore., Water & Electric Board for the Trojan
nuclear project.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Standard & Poor's also said it has given a double-A rating
to the supply system's planned offering next month of between
$600 million and $800 million of refunding revenue bonds for
WPPSS units 2 and 3, which didn't default.</p>
<p>The higher credit rating "reflects the improved financial
flexibility of the Bonneville Power Administration," which
secures all these bonds through net billing agreements, S&P
said.</p>
<p>Scott Clements, WPPSS manager of refinancing and
investment operations, said the supply system was delighted
by the upgrade. "We think Bonneville will continue to benefit
from the refunding as we complete the rest of the program,
hopefully before the end of the year," Mr. Clements said.</p>
