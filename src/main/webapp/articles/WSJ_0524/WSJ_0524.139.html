	<p class="article-leader">Bowne & Co. said it completed the purchase of some Sorg
Inc. assets for $5.7 million, including the Sorg name and
trademark and some printing equipment. Both financial
printers are based in New York.
   Sorg has been operating with protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code since August.
The asset sale received bankruptcy court approval Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bowne said it will employ a dozen members of Sorg's New
York management and sales staff, and is considering
applications from four more Sorg employees. It also said it
transferred all of Sorg's work in progress to its own
facility. The agreement excludes Sorg's real estate, Chicago
office and various other assets, and one printing press Sorg
had agreed to sell but turned out not to own, Bowne said.</p>
