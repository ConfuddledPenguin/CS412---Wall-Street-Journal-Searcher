	<p class="article-leader">Those fizzy, fruity wine coolers are dead as a doornail,
gone the way of the mood ring into fad heaven. Or are they?
   Seagram Co., in an unusual bid to regain the confidence of
retailers, is running multipage ads in Beverage Dynamics and
other trade magazines claiming, "Reports on the death of
coolers have been greatly exaggerated." The ad lists "cooler
facts and fiction" and pleads with retailers to support the
brand with display and shelf space.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Seagram pitch comes as total sales of wine coolers
continue in a downward spiral. Last year, sales dropped 19.4%
to 39.5 million cases, according to Jobson Publishing Co.'s
beverage alcohol group. The drop followed an 11% drop the
year before.</p>
<p>But Seagram is ignoring the precipitous slide of the past
few years and looking at the brighter side: For the past six
months, category sales are actually flat, it says, adding
that sales of Seagram coolers are up recently.</p>
<p>"We wanted to get the facts as they exist in today's
marketplace clearly across to the public that distributes and
sells these products to consumers," says Mark Taxel,
executive vice president at Seagram Beverage Co. "The
category decline was coming from a lot of the second-tier
brands that never gave the consumer quality."</p>
<p>Some Seagram competitors take exception. "The wine-cooler
category just really disappeared," says a spokeswoman for
Philip Morris's Miller Brewing unit, which pulled the plug on
its Matilda Bay cooler brand late last year. "The category
started to disintegrate, and it wasn't an economically
feasible thing to stay in."</p>
<p>Actually, both sides may be right. The cooler category did
indeed shrink drastically since the summer of 1987 -- but the
exodus of numerous wine-cooler makers like Miller has been
good news for Seagram and E&J Gallo Winery, which makes
Bartles & Jaymes. Both heavyweights have picked up share, and
together they now account for about 80% of total sales.</p>
<p>"Certainly there was a fad aspect to wine coolers," says
Jon Fredrikson, a wine-industry economist at Gomberg,
Fredrikson & Associates, San Francisco. "But there was a
major shakeout," he says, and the survivors have carved a
healthy business.</p>
<p>Seagram isn't taking any chances. In addition to the pitch
aimed at retailers, it hired a new ad agency, Wells, Rich,
Greene, and this week wheels out a new ad campaign in
anticipation of summer, when the majority of coolers are
consumed.</p>
<p>The new campaign, themed "it's a cooler world," has a
decidedly middlebrow feel to it, with men and women shown
sitting around a table exchanging lively conversation. "We
talked about guys, we talked about girls, hey that's what
life's all about anyway," goes part of a jingle sung by
Nikolas Ashford and Valerie Simpson.</p>
<p>Indeed, the ads don't even attempt to woo the
trend-setting poolside types that sampled coolers but didn't
stick with the product. The target customers "aren't trendy
people," Mr. Taxel says. "Our consumers tend to be a little
more upscale than regular beer drinkers."</p>
<p>For its new effort, Seagram has abandoned its all-star
strategy.</p>
<p>After using Bruce Willis for a time, the company in 1988
brought out three other celebrities, including Woody
Harrelson, Steve Guttenberg and Anne Archer.</p>
<p>The new campaign will promote in particular Seagram's new
Black Raspberry wine cooler. When the category started to
falter, most wine-cooler makers resorted to aggressive
introductions of new flavors to hold consumer interest, but
the innovations didn't help stem the declines.</p>
<p>Canandaigua Wine Co.'s Sun Country cooler, for example,
brought out several flavored coolers, but its share
plummeted. It's now a minor player, but it's planning another
run and is introducing yet another flavor, Melon Berry. But
it doesn't plan to allocate any money to national TV
advertising, instead planning to sponsor special events in a
few markets where the brand continues to sell.</p>
<p>For its part, Gallo says it plans to stick with Frank
Bartles and Ed Jaymes, its two folksy pitchmen, for TV
commercials. A spokesman says Bartles & Jaymes, like Seagram,
had a strong first quarter. "We don't see anything wrong with
the business."</p>

<p>Art, Glasnost and Vodka</p>
<p>Glasnost has already been used to sell everything from
McDonald's to Quintessence cosmetics. Now vodkas are trading
on it in a bid for Russian cachet.</p>
<p>Absolut Vodka said yesterday it will run ads highlighting
works by 26 Russian artists in the June Interview magazine.
The paintings and sculptures featured have, not surprisingly,
one thing in common: Each includes a bottle of Absolut, which
sounds Russian but is actually a Swedish spirit imported by
Carillon Importers Ltd. in New York. TBWA Advertising created
the ads.</p>
<p>The Absolut ads follow a new campaign for Smirnoff vodka,
which recently was reintroduced in the Soviet Union after 73
years. The headline: "Back in the USSR." Smirnoff has been
produced in the U.S. by Heublein Inc. for 50 years.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>ADWEEK: The top three executives of A/S/M Communications,
owner of Adweek, couldn't be reached regarding speculation
that they were in discussions to sell part or all of the
company to Affiliated Publications, Boston. Affiliated
already owns the Boston Globe, as well as Billboard and other
trade publications. Staffers at Adweek have been told that
troubled A/S/M, which has already folded a number of its
publications, is seeking a cash infusion from an outside
investor. Affiliated executives couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>JOINT VENTURE: Chiat/Day/Mojo, Los Angeles, said it set up
a joint venture with Han Brindfors Advertising, Stockholm.
The two agencies plan to develop a pan-European network of
agencies. Chait/Day said the joint venture would be owned
equally, with agencies planned for Italy, France and Spain.</p>
<p>DELLA FEMINA: Jerry Della Femina, chairman of Della
Femina, McNamee WCRS, denied speculation the agency is
selling its Boston office. Industry executives say Della
Femina has been in discussions to sell the Boston office to
Arnold Advertising, a Boston shop headed up by former Della
Femina executive Ed Eskandarian. Arnold Advertising
executives couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>OGILVY & MATHER: Harry Reid, director of Ogilvy & Mather's
Asia region, was named chairman of Ogilvy & Mather Europe,
succeeding Peter Warren, who resigned. Rod Wright, deputy
regional director in Asia, was named to succeed Mr. Reid.
Hans Lange resigned as vice chairman of Ogilvy & Mather
Europe. Ogilvy is a WPP Group agency.</p>
<p>WHO'S NEWS: Stewart M. Alter was named senior vice
president and director of world-wide communications at
