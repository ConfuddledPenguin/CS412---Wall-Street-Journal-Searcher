	<p class="article-leader">Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge I. Raymond Kremer
approved a $13 million settlement on behalf of about 25,000
SmithKline Beckman Corp.'s shareholders on Tuesday.
   The $13 million will be paid pro-rata to shareholders of
SmithKline who held shares between April 10, 1989, and June
26, 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last year, several groups of SmithKline shareholders filed
class-action suits, alleging that the company's directors
breached their fiduciary duties by not seeking potential
acquirers willing to pay a higher price than the one offered
by Beecham Group PLC and by placing devices, such as a poison
pill and golden parachutes, in the way of a hostile bid.
SmithKline ultimately merged with Beecham to form SmithKline
Beecham PLC.</p>
<p>According to the settlement agreement, the defendants
"vigorously deny all liability," but settled in order to
"avoid the substantial expense, inconvenience, and
distraction of continued litigation."</p>
