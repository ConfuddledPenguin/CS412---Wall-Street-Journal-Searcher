	<p class="article-leader">Pic 'N' Save Corp., struggling to fend off a hostile
investor group, offered the group minority representation on
its board and on a newly formed committee to evaluate bids to
buy the company.
   The Dominguez, Calif., retailer of closeout merchandise
put itself up for sale last week in an apparent effort to
discourage shareholders from joining Girard Partners L.P.'s
efforts to oust Pic 'N' Save's board. Girard has said it will
conduct its own auction for the company if it gains control.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pic 'N' Save reiterated that it stands ready to negotiate
all aspects of a confidentiality agreement with Girard to
induce the group to join in the company's bidding process.
Pic 'N' Save offered Girard two seats on its board, which
would be expanded to nine from seven members.</p>
<p>The new committee would be expanded to five from three
members if Girard accepted the proffered board seats. Three
of Pic `N' Save's outside directors were named to the
committee, headed by Bruce Karatz, president and chief
executive officer of Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. The other two
outside directors weren't included because they are scheduled
to be out of the country until mid-June, a Pic 'N' Save
spokesman said.</p>
<p>In La Jolla, Calif., David H. Batchelder, Girard's
controlling partner, promptly rejected Pic 'N' Save's offer.</p>
