	<p class="article-leader">Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady yesterday boosted
estimates of the borrowings for the savings-and-loan bailout
to between $90 billion and $120 billion, up from the
Treasury's original $50 billion lowball estimate. Including
interest on these borrowings, costs of the disaster will hit
$300 billion and maybe even $500 billion, or $2,000 for every
American man, woman and child.
   Secretary Brady is not proposing any new program,
remember, he's just filling in the totals needed to make good
on government bank-deposit insurance, a blank check written
long ago. The various roots of the S&L crisis reach back to
the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Great Inflation of
the 1970s. But to pick a moment when a blank check was
written, turn to the early morning of March 5, 1980. Deposit
insurance then stood at $40,000 an account, and a House
banking-deregulation bill contained no increase. The Senate
bill proposed an increase to $50,000. In the wee hours of the
morning, House Banking Chairman Fernand St Germain pushed
through a conference-committee "compromise" of $100,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It slipped through without any discussion," recalls
former Rep. Ron Paul, a Banking Committee member. "I'm told
everyone was so exhausted that they would have done anything
to get out of that room." The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation begged Congress not to raise the coverage to
$100,000, but it passed as part of the overall bill with only
Mr. Paul and 12 other House Members opposed.</p>
<p>A chief proponent of higher deposit insurance was the U.S.
League of Savings Institutions, the largest thrift-lobbying
group. One of its key lobbyists was James "Snake" Freeman. In
1987, a Justice Department probe focused on the cozy
relations between Rep. St Germain and Mr. Freeman, for
example dozens of meals at Washington's Prime Rib restaurant
on Mr. Freeman's credit card. In 1988, a Justice report was
finally released finding "substantial evidence of serious and
sustained misconduct" on Mr. St Germain's part. Mr. St
Germain went on to lose his re-election bid as his Rhode
Island district elected its first Republican in 50 years.</p>
<p>The St Germain "compromise" allowed money brokers to
bundle large deposits together in lots of $100,000 and chase
the high interest rates offered by often-insolvent thrifts
that were trying to stay open by expanding. To pay these
rates, S&Ls had to turn to high-return loans, permitted under
the 1982 Garn-St Germain bill. In a now-classic phrase, this
was the means of matching marginal lenders with marginal
borrowers. When the risky loans went bad, the S&Ls couldn't
repay deposits, and the insurance stuck the government with
the tab, $300 billion to $500 billion.</p>
<p>Many people warned that while deregulation was necessary,
it would not mix with deposit insurance. We ourselves missed
the importance of the $100,000 figure, but by the time of the
1982 bill warned, "As things stand now, deregulation under
guaranteed banking will give banks a competitive edge in
attracting funds from the public, while compounding the
opportunity for bank managements to behave imprudently." As
early as 1983, the FDIC told Congress that deposit insurance
should be reined in by forcing depositors to take a 10% to
15% "haircut" loss that would encourage some of them to
monitor their local S&Ls. A 1984 regulatory task force set up
by Vice President George Bush made similar recommendations.</p>
<p>Yet deposit insurance has remained politically
untouchable. In particular, the thrift industry and its
associated construction contractors reached into every
congressional district. The Jim Wright and Keating Five cases
have highlighted the extent to which political influence was
used to delay action on the S&L mess and added immeasurably
to its costs. In its January 1989 thrift-bailout plan, the
Bush administration ducked the issue of deposit insurance; it
knew reform was necessary, but knew any such proposal would
mean delay in Congress, and feared that a nationwide run on
the S&Ls was imminent. The issue was bucked to a Treasury
study due out in 1991.</p>
<p>Happily, recognition of the issue is spreading. Henry
Gonzalez, the new House Banking Committee chairman who
pursued the Keating Five case, now says that reform of the
insurance system is the only real way to stop similar
scandals in the future. Budget Director Richard Darman warned
this month that off-budget liabilities like deposit insurance
are a serious threat to the economy and must be capped.
Former Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire
admitted recently there was "no defense" for Congress's
failure in the S&L crisis.</p>
<p>There are various ways to cut back deposit insurance:
reducing the amount per account to perhaps $50,000, insuring
perhaps only 85% of deposits or deposits over some small
amount, simply capping the amount outstanding, or even
turning to private deposit insurance, which has been
successful in the brokerage community.</p>
<p>Specific proposals can be debated once the issue is
defined. But the first step of all is to get history
straight, to recognize that the huge bailout bill comes from
a blank check written in the dark of night.</p>
