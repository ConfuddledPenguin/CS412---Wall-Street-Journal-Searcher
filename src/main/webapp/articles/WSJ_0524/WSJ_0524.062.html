	<p class="article-leader">Yesterday the House voted to spend $250 million on people
who lose their jobs because of the Clean Air bill the House
is going to pass. In Congress, there really is a free lunch,
a tooth fairy and money that grows on trees. House
philosopher, Rep. Jerry Sikorski, called the measure "a
matter of simple justice." More likely it's severance pay for
whichever Big Three auto maker the Clean Air bill ultimately
destroys.</p>
