	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW (AP) -- The government will lay its future on the
line in the Soviet Union's first national referendum, in
which voters will consider a shift to a market economy that
could cost millions of jobs, officials said.
   The government believes it must have clear public support
before starting the potentially destabilizing five-year plan,
First Deputy Premier Yuri Maslyukov told a news conference.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If the program is not approved, it is my opinion the
government should resign," Mr. Maslyukov said, referring to
the Council of Ministers led by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.</p>
<p>It was unclear whether the public would endorse the
changes, which would double food prices Jan. 1, 1991, lead to
widespread closures of inefficient factories, and eventually
allow private ownership of most businesses.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryzhkov was to present the plan today to the Supreme
Soviet parliament, where some radical reformers were planning
to seek his resignation. He survived a similar no-confidence
vote last fall.</p>
<p>No Soviet government has ever fallen because of either a
referendum or a parliamentary vote, although prime ministers
have been forced to resign by the Communist Party leader.</p>
<p>Even if the government falls, Soviet law guarantees that
Mikhail S. Gorbachev would continue the four-year
presidential term to which he was elected by the Congress of
People's Deputies this year. He is also general secretary of
the Communist Party, traditionally the top Kremlin job.</p>
<p>But Mr. Gorbachev has balked at standing for popular
election, and defeat of the referendum would throw the future
wide open, Mr. Maslyukov said.</p>
<p>"If the public refuses to consent to the price rises, then
perhaps we will have to resort to round-table discussions,"
Mr. Maslyukov said, referring to talks that led to the fall
of the Communist government in Poland last year.</p>
