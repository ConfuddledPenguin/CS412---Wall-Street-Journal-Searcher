	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Agriculture Committee adopted a
$3.6 billion compromise plan to prop up milk prices and hold
down dairy prices for the next five years.
   The committee agreed to set the current milk support price
of $10.10 per hundred pounds as a five-year floor price for
dairy farmers. But the plan would allow for adjustments in
the support price to reflect fluctuations in government-owned
surpluses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Committee staffers estimated that the dairy plan would
cost $1.6 billion more than what the current dairy program
would cost if it were extended for the next five years. But
they said that the plan would still be consistent with Senate
Budget Committee guidelines, which House lawmakers are
prepared to follow in the event of a deficit-reduction
agreement.</p>
<p>The plan calls for an automatic price-support rise of at
least 25 cents per hundred pounds if dairy surpluses fell
below 3.5 billion pounds. The current $10.10 price would be
maintained as long as surpluses range between 3.5 billion and
five billion pounds. And if dairy farmers produced between
five billion pounds and seven billion pounds more than the
market could bear, the support price would drop between 25
cents and 50 cents per hundred pounds. But in no case would
it go below the $10.10 floor price.</p>
<p>The government buys surplus cheese, butter and nonfat dry
milk whenever commercial demand isn't sufficient to keep milk
prices from slipping below the support price.</p>
<p>If government purchases were forecast to exceed seven
billion pounds in any year, the Agriculture Department could
inaugurate an inventory management program, beginning in
1992, to hold down milk production.</p>
<p>The compromise was offered by Rep. Charles Stenholm (D.,
Texas), chairman of the dairy subcommittee, and Rep. Steve
Gunderson (R., Wis.), the ranking minority member, as an
alternative to a plan that had been embraced earlier by the
subcommittee.</p>
<p>That plan would have set a floor price of $10.60 per
hundred pounds, imposed assessments on dairy farmers to
discourage production and created a standby system of
two-tier price supports. The Bush administration and some
farm groups strongly objected to a two-tier system.</p>
<p>The committee, in a minor concession to critics of farm
subsidies, voted to put a $250,000 cap on so-called incentive
payments to individual wool and mohair producers and to
freeze the honey-price support for beekeepers at the fiscal
1990 level.</p>
