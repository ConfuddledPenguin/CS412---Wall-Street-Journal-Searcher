	<p class="article-leader">The pressure continues to mount on tobacco companies.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan is
planning to recommend curbs on the industry as part of a
stepped-up campaign against smoking by minors, and Harvard
University disclosed that it has sold most of its investments
in tobacco companies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>HHS officials said Dr. Sullivan will push for restrictions
on cigarette vending machines, a legal smoking age of 19 and
tougher licensing provisions for retailers. Dr. Sullivan will
include these and other provisions in an anti-smoking code he
plans to recommend that states adopt when he testifies today
before the Senate Finance Committee, HHS officials said.</p>
<p>Although 44 states have laws banning the sale of
cigarettes to minors, the laws generally are loosely
enforced, if at all. Studies show that most adults who smoke
started when they were minors. Dr. Sullivan believes that one
of the best ways to fight smoking is to discourage minors
from taking up the habit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, critics said Harvard's move could spark a wave
of pressure on shareholders to sell tobacco stocks, much like
the movement to persuade universities and state governments
to dump holdings in firms doing business in South Africa.</p>
<p>Several anti-industry efforts already have begun. Brad
Krevor, director of the Tobacco Divestment Project in Boston,
said his newly formed group plans to contact hospitals,
insurers and state pension funds. Also in Massachusetts, a
bill cosponsored by state Rep. John Bussinger is being
considered that would require the state to divest itself of
all tobacco stock.</p>
<p>Harvard President Derek Bok disclosed the sale in a letter
dated May 18 to students at the university's School of Public
Health. He said the divestiture was prompted by recognition
of the dangers of smoking and concern over aggressive
marketing tactics to promote smoking among teen-agers and in
countries where the dangers of smoking aren't widely known.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 1989, when the divestitures began, Harvard
owned shares of tobacco companies worth $58 million,
including $41 million of Philip Morris Cos. shares. Harvard
continues indirectly to own part of RJR Nabisco Inc. as part
of a limited partnership managed by the leveraged buy-out
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.</p>
<p>"When the president of Harvard comes out and says, `This
is dirty money, I don't want any part of it,' that's going to
cause a pretty strong ripple effect across the country," said
Greg Connolly, an official at the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health. "It could be the start of a nationwide trend."</p>
<p>The divestiture movement has taken a long time to pick up
any steam. As long ago as 1981, the American Medical
Association vowed to rid its investment portfolio of holdings
in tobacco companies. In 1987, the AMA called on medical
schools and their parent universities to divest holdings in
tobacco stocks, but there was little response to the call.</p>
<p>Besides the efforts in Massachusetts, City University of
New York has resolved to sell its holdings in tobacco
companies, according to Mr. Krevor. City University officials
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association's College
Retirement Equities Funds, a nationwide pension system for
employees of colleges and universities, launched a Social
Choice Account in March. The new account doesn't invest funds
in companies that market tobacco or alcohol, among other
criteria.</p>
<p>But the Investor Responsibility Research Center, which
tracks social issues for investors, said it wasn't aware of
any other university or investment funds divesting shares in
tobacco companies.</p>
<p>That lack of interest may result, in part, from the fact
that most tobacco stocks, despite their embattled image, have
been strong performers. Last year, Philip Morris stock
outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by 36%,
and is ahead by another 5% this year, according to Marc
Cohen, a tobacco analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Philip Morris wouldn't comment on the
possibility of increased anti-tobacco activism on the part of
holders. "Stockholders can make decisions based on any
criteria they choose to employ," he said. "But as a Harvard
grad, I hope they invest in an equally profitable
corporation." A spokesman for American Brands Inc. declined
to comment on the Harvard decision. Officials of Loews
Corp.'s Lorillard Inc. unit couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>The model code that Dr. Sullivan plans to recommend today
to the states will incorporate parts of existing statutes.
Advisers said he will propose that:</p>
<p>-- Vending machines, which account for about 16% of
illegal cigarette sales to minors, be banned or limited to
bars, offices, and other places used largely by adults.</p>
<p>-- Retailers be required to obtain licenses to sell
cigarettes. Currently, 31 states license vendors. Retailers
who sell to minors would run the risk of having their
licenses suspended or revoked.</p>
<p>-- Civil fines be levied against retailers who sell to
minors.</p>
<p>-- Signs warning that sales to minors are illegal be
posted at all points of sale.</p>
<p>Dr. Sullivan also is considering ways to restrict
cigarette advertising aimed at minors, but officials say he
may not be ready to announce any such initiatives today.</p>
