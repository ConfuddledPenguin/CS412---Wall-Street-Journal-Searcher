	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Corporate credit quality fell sharply in the
second quarter, Standard & Poor's Corp. said.
   The rating concern, part of McGraw-Hill Inc., said it
lowered ratings on about $190 billion of debt in the quarter
and raised ratings on $34 billion. The number of downgrades,
207, greatly exceeded the 50 upgrades.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Two large debt issuers, Ford Motor Credit Co. and Chrysler
Financial Corp., contributed heavily to the volume of
downgraded debt in the latest quarter. "In addition, non-U.S.
corporate rating changes were all negative," S&P said. It
also noted bank holding companies had 23 downgrades but only
one upgrade.</p>
<p>Separately, S&P said municipal credit quality remained
weak in the second quarter, largely because of downgrades
among housing issues and ratings of National Rural Utilities
Cooperative Finance Corp.</p>
<p>S&P estimated that it lowered ratings on $14.5 billion of
municipal debt and raised ratings on $8.8 billion. Downgrades
totaled 139 in the quarter, and upgrades 45.</p>
