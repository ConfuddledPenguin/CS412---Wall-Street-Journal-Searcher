	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- Centuries-old Polish mistrust of German intentions
has flared anew, threatening a crucial meeting tomorrow that
is supposed to finally settle the issue of the German-Polish
border.
   Foreign ministers of the two Germanys and the four World
War II allies will be meeting in their third session of the
so-called two-plus-four talks aimed at resolving
international obstacles to German unification. The Polish
foreign minister, invited to attend the meeting in an effort
to settle the nagging border question, has instead raised new
demands.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To Bonn's chagrin, Polish officials are demanding that the
U.S., Soviet Union, France and Britain retain their remaining
occupation rights over Germany, even after unification, until
the new German state signs a treaty with Poland that
recognizes the current borders as permanent. Poland also
wants the treaty to end the West German practice of
recognizing ethnic Germans in Poland as German nationals.</p>
<p>"The Poles mistrust us greatly, and, we think, without
reason," shrugged a senior West German official. "They fear
that once the leverage of the two-plus-four process is gone,
they will lose all leverage with us, and we will lose
interest in a border treaty. They don't want to negotiate
alone with the Germans."</p>
<p>Indeed, Poland's newest demand came against a backdrop of
heightened political tensions between the two governments.
West German officials believe it resulted from their decision
to cut off trilateral negotiations with the East Germans and
Poles, against Warsaw's wishes, over a new draft state treaty
on the border.</p>
<p>Bonn officials angrily responded to the Polish action as
an unwanted distraction at a time when their greater problem
was winning Soviet approval for their unification plans.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl flew to Moscow over the weekend to try
to knock down other remaining barriers posed by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev, mostly involving opposition to Bonn's
demands that a unified Germany stay in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization. Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
said the West Germans would offer Mr. Gorbachev further
economic cooperation and a concrete number to which a unified
Germany would reduce troop levels.</p>
<p>West German officials say Poland is demanding more than
Bonn can give, thus acting as the de facto ally of the Soviet
Union in mounting international barriers to German
unification. Mr. Kohl's government insists that West German
law requires that only a unified German state can finally
settle the border issue. And in an effort to satisfy Warsaw,
both Germanys' parliaments this month declared their
recognition of the present border.</p>
<p>But distrustful Polish officials argue those actions
aren't legally binding on either country now and certainly
wouldn't obligate a reunified Germany. "We have had enough
bad experience in Central Europe, and we want this issue to
be settled in as waterproof a manner as possible," said a
Polish official.</p>
<p>Western officials believe the difference may be smoothed
out tomorrow by offering Poland a statement promising that
the border issue will be settled as the first order of
business of a unified German Parliament in December. Mr. Kohl
set the table for such a solution by sending a letter to
Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki citing Bonn's
willingness to undertake negotiations immediately after
December's all-German elections. Western diplomats say they
can't support Poland's new demands, despite sympathizing with
them, for that would only encourage more Soviet
intransigence.</p>
<p>U.S. officials are also troubled by a more general
worsening in German-Polish relations. Ties had been warming
until a November visit by Chancellor Kohl to Poland was cut
short when the Berlin Wall was opened. Since then, the warmth
has turned to suspicion, with Poland accusing the Germans of
ignoring its interests and the Germans resentful that Warsaw
isn't actively supporting reunification.</p>
<p>German officials are impatient with Polish worries. They
talk of a new economic curtain that could fall between
Germany and Poland that might replace the Iron Curtain if
Poland doesn't clean up its economic house and recognize that
it is following a risky course in upsetting West Germany,
perhaps its greatest hope for economic assistance.</p>
<p>"We won't allow, under any conditions, that the Poles will
decide when and how we are to be unified," says Hans Klein, a
Bonn cabinet member and government spokesman.</p>
<p>German resentment of Poles has also grown discernibly,
particularly in Berlin and East Germany, where thousands of
Poles have streamed through newly opened borders on shopping
trips. The West Germans require visas for Poles, while
allowing other East Europeans to cross freely. One Polish
official complains that West German officials are obsessed
with backing Mr. Gorbachev and his economy, recently offering
a guaranteed credit of five billion marks ($3.06 billion),
while disregarding the danger of Poland's increasing economic
difficulties.</p>
<p>West German officials argue that they have done much for
Poland. Chancellor Kohl has moved to forgive 700 million
marks of Poland's official debt, and he agreed to place all
repayments of a further 500 million marks in loans in a fund
to finance projects "of mutual interest." German officials
say the Poles ignore Bonn's overwhelming commitment to the
bilateral relationship and current borders.</p>
<p>Yet historic Polish concerns were heightened when, after
the parliamentary resolutions of July 1, Bonn and East Berlin
broke off trilateral talks on a draft border treaty Poland
had drawn up.</p>
<p>West German officials say Mr. Kohl opposed Poland's
including in the draft treaty matters that would anger his
conservative constituency. They included a demand that West
Germany abandon its policy of offering German ethnic groups
in Poland benefits such as citizenship and pensions if they
move to Germany. Warsaw has also sought an agreement that
reparations be paid to Poles who served in forced labor camps
during World War II. This would be a costly concession for
Bonn, which estimates that two million Poles and Soviets who
survived the camps are still alive.</p>
<p>For both countries, the border issue raises old
resentments and new animosities. Germans remember with anger
how Winston Churchill, at a dinner during the Tehran summit
in 1943, used three matchsticks to demonstrate for Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin how borders could be redrawn after the
war. He simply moved the matches westward.</p>
<p>Under an agreement reached at war's end, Poland moved out
of eastern portions of its own country, which had been
annexed by the Soviet Union after the 1939 Hitler-Stalin
pact. From the Ukraine, Byelorussia and Lithuania, 1.5
million Poles trekked to the new frontier. Some 4.4 million
resettled from central Poland. Most of the 5.6 million
Germans in what became Polish territory were expelled. Four
million had already fled as refugees.</p>
<p>The Poles, six million of whom were killed during the war,
regained from German territory only about half the land it
lost to the Soviets. But it was valuable property. Its
fertile land had produced agricultural surpluses while its
coal mines produced a fifth of Germany's prewar production.</p>
