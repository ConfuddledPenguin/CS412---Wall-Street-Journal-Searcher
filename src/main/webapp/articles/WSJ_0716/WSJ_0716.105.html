	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Only here would the dawn of a "New Age of
public transportation" be greeted with fire in a subway
tunnel, threats of a freeway collapse and nightmarish
gridlock.
   Needless to say, it all happened on Friday the 13th.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Just as the final bunting was being tacked up for last
Saturday's inauguration of an $877 million trolley line, the
first leg of a planned 150-mile rail network in auto-obsessed
Los Angeles, the rest of the city's transportation system all
but collapsed.</p>
<p>It started when fire erupted early Friday in a service
tunnel of the city's unfinished Metro subway system, located
a few miles from the trolley. The tunnel that caught fire
runs beneath the heavily traveled Hollywood Freeway downtown,
and officials were forced to shut down the freeway for fear
it might buckle.</p>
<p>The result was the worst gridlock in recent memory, as
morning commuters were forced off the freeway and onto the
streets, some caught in traffic for four hours. "This whole
week I've been coming in late to work, and since it was
Friday the 13th, I figured I'd leave an hour early," said one
frustrated commuter, Erick Castillo. The freeway remained
closed through the weekend as workers scrambled to reinforce
the tunnel in time for this morning's rush hour.</p>
<p>No one was seriously injured in the tunnel blaze, the
cause of which hadn't been determined yesterday. But the
incident did bruise plenty of egos and cause political
tempers to flare. City councilman Nate Holden, who opposed
Mayor Tom Bradley in last year's election, demanded, "Who's
minding the store?" and claimed that the fire could delay by
one year the already-late $1.4 billion subway project,
currently set to open in the fall of 1993. Mayor Bradley told
reporters before a tour of the damaged area that Mr. Holden
"must know something we don't know. How did he get in to see
the damage?"</p>
<p>Ultimately, the fire and traffic tie-ups had little impact
on Saturday's festivities, which were marred only by the
remarks of detractors. When the first trolley emerged from an
underground tunnel in a celebratory cloud of blue smoke and
confetti, several in the audience quipped, "It's on fire."
Jonathan Richmond, a transportation consultant who's been a
harsh critic of the city's rail plans, handed reporters
copies of his thesis, "Theories of Symbolism, Metaphor and
Myth, And the Development of Western Rail Passenger Systems;
or Penis Envy in Los Angeles." Some politicians complained,
only half-jokingly, that the seats on the Japanese-made
trolleys were too small.</p>
<p>Still, the trolleys moved smoothly Saturday, carrying some
25,000 people who'd waited in long lines to take the
hour-long ride between Los Angeles and Long Beach. Many
people reminisced about the city's former trolley system, the
expansive Red Car line that was dismantled in 1961. "My
father brought me out for one of the last Red Car rides, and
I thought I'd come out today for sentimental reasons," said
35-year-old Eric Jacobson, a law clerk.</p>
<p>"I think this notion that L.A. cares less about rail is
wrong," said county supervisor Ed Edelman, chairman of the
county's transportation commission. "Where else can you ride
in such comfort, with air conditioning?"</p>
<p>After making speeches at the Long Beach station,
politicians hopped on waiting air-conditioned buses for the
half-hour freeway drive back to Los Angeles.</p>
