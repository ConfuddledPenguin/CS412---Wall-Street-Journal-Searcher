	<p class="article-leader">NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Hospital Corp. of America said it has
obtained $545 million in financing commitments to enable it
to recapitalize its psychiatric-hospital subsidiary.
   Under the transaction, the unit, which owns 54 hospitals,
will borrow $545 million from a group of commercial banks and
other lenders. Hospital Corp., in turn, will use net proceeds
of $500 million from the borrowing -- along with $100 million
currently in escrow and the net proceeds of other pending
asset sales -- to pay off the $696.5 million balance of an
asset-sale bridge loan. The loan is due March 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hospital Corp. was taken private in a $3.61 billion
leveraged buy-out in March 1989. Last December, the company
was set back in its efforts to pay down the debt, when a
planned $1.23 billion sale of the psychiatric subsidiary to
the unit's employees collapsed.</p>
<p>Hospital Corp. said the co-arrangers for the financing
include the Bank of Nova Scotia and Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
of New York.</p>
<p>It said the financing commitments are subject to
definitive documentation and certain other conditions and
that the financing is expected to close in the current
quarter.</p>
