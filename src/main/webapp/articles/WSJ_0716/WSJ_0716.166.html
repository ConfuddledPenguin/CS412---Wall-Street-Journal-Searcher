	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- A group of dissident shareholders of Sherritt
Gordon Ltd. said it plans to launch a proxy fight to unseat
the company's current board and management.
   The group, which has formed Canada SherGor Enterprises
Inc., said it requested the company to call a shareholders
meeting, where it plans to present for a vote an alternative
slate of board nominees. Canada SherGor said it expected a
new board would appoint the group's principals, Ian Delaney
and Bruce Walter, to executive positions at Sherritt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Sherritt Gordon official said the company had no
immediate response to the announcement. Sherritt, based in
Toronto, has interests in nickel refining and fertilizer
production.</p>
<p>Messrs. Delaney and Walter resigned in April as chief
executive officer and vice president, respectively, of
Horsham Corp., a Toronto investment concern. Since then, Mr.
Delaney said the two have built up a stake of between 5% and
10% of Sherritt through market purchases of stock. The group
also has the backing of Eric Sprott, who heads Toronto
brokerage firm Sprott Securities Ltd. In a statement, Mr.
Sprott said he won't be paid for his support.</p>
<p>Mr. Delaney criticized Sherritt's current management for
not doing "much to mitigate the cyclicality of the
commodities" it is involved with. He also was critical of the
current board's low level of investment in Sherritt stock. As
of April, Sherritt directors owned a combined total of about
0.04% of the company's stock.</p>
<p>Mr. Delaney said he doesn't intend to sell any of
Sherritt's assets "for short-term benefit." Instead, "we
intend to build the company and to make {it} our principal
business interest," he said.</p>
<p>Under Ontario company law, the Sherritt board has 21 days
to call a shareholders meeting.</p>
