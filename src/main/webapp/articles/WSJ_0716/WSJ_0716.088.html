	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Despite recent cutbacks by Ford Motor Co. and
continuing weak sales, U.S. auto makers still plan to boost
domestic car output by 11.6% in the third quarter from anemic
year-earlier levels.
   Slow sales are forcing Ford to cut 11,300 cars from its
original third-quarter production plans. However, the No. 2
auto maker still plans to build 11.1% more cars in the
current quarter than a year earlier and is adding to its
third-quarter truck output schedules.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Overall, the 10 major U.S. auto makers plan to build
1,560,704 cars in the third quarter, about 162,000 more than
a year earlier. Truck production is forecast to rise 8.3% to
907,334 vehicles.</p>
<p>Their latest plans are an indication that auto makers
still expect a modest second-half rebound in consumer demand
despite some analysts' concerns about the sluggish U.S.
economy. The plans also reflect how restrained output earlier
in the year is paying off in the form of lean summer
inventories.</p>
<p>But a major force behind the overall increase in U.S. car
production for the quarter is the growing strength of the
U.S. operations of Japanese auto makers. Plants owned by
Japanese auto makers or operated as joint ventures with U.S.
companies are expected to build 334,704 cars in the
July-September period, a jump of nearly 59,000 from the third
quarter of 1989. These operations will build 21.4% of all
domestic cars in the period, compared with 19.7% a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Most auto makers should be able to hold to their
third-quarter production schedules because stocks of unsold
cars are low, analysts say. On June 30, the car industry had
an estimated 59-day supply of cars, which is at the low end
of historical norms, said analyst John Qualls of Hill &
Knowlton Inc. That compares with an uncomfortably high 75-day
supply of cars a year earlier.</p>
<p>"Unless the bottom falls out of the market, I don't see
any problems for the industry," Mr. Qualls said.</p>
<p>Thus, auto makers may be able to spend less on sales
incentives to move out 1990 models by the start of the new
model year Oct. 1, analysts said. Reduced incentives and
increased production would help third-quarter profit at Ford
and General Motors Corp. At Chrysler Corp., however, company
officials have said reduced output of minivans and cars will
sharply depress third-quarter profit.</p>
<p>Auto makers are still forecasting that sales in the third
and fourth quarters will improve from weak 1989 levels
despite signs of sluggish U.S. economic growth. Most company
officials say they expect U.S. car and light truck sales to
total about 14.5 million vehicles, roughly flat with last
year.</p>
<p>Car makers are drawing comfort from surveys such as one by
the Consumer Research Center that shows 8.1% of Americans
plan to buy a car in the next six months, up from 6.7% in
June 1989. "We've been getting fairly good readings in both
May and June," says Fabian Linden, the center's executive
director.</p>
<p>Other analysts are not so sanguine. They say car sales
could be dragged down by a slowing national economy and by
prospects of a tax increase.</p>
<p>Among the Big Three U.S. auto makers, GM plans the biggest
jump in third-quarter car output -- a 12.7% increase from
year-earlier levels. But that largely reflects production
levels at this time last year that were the lowest since
1970, when a strike shut many of the company's plants. GM
plans to increase its light truck production for the quarter
by 4.6%.</p>
<p>Ford has cut its quarterly car production forecast since
last month, partly because of its plan to shut down its
Mustang assembly plant in Dearborn, Mich., for a week in
July.</p>
<p>On the truck side, Ford has boosted its third-quarter
production schedule since June and is running some assembly
plants on overtime. Ford now plans a 25.3% increase from
year-earlier levels. Earlier, the company planned an 18.8%
increase.</p>
<p>Chrysler, which closed a subcompact car plant in Detroit
this year, projects that quarterly car production will drop
5.7% from a year earlier. Chrysler's truck production will be
off a whopping 25.7%, mainly because the company plans to
shut its two minivan plants for a month each to retool for
the redesigned 1991 Chrysler minivans.</p>
<p>All Japanese auto makers with U.S. operations are planning
increased car production except Nissan Motor Corp., which
projects an 18.2% drop because of retooling for the
redesigned 1991 Sentra subcompact model at its Smyrna, Tenn.,
assembly plant.</p>
