	<p class="article-leader">CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia's shorn wool production
is forecast to fall to 1.01 million metric tons in the year
ending June 30, 1991, from a record 1.03 million tons
estimated for fiscal 1990, the Bureau of Statistics said. A
metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
   The bureau estimated that 216.2 million sheep will be
shorn in fiscal 1991, up 1.3% from a record 213.3 million a
year earlier. But the amount of wool cut from each sheep will
fall to about 10.3 pounds from 10.6 pounds.</p>
