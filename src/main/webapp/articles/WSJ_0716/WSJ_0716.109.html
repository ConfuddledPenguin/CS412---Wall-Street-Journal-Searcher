	<p class="article-leader">Willamette Industries Inc., a forest products company
based in Portland, Ore., said second-quarter earnings fell
7.4% to $43.6 million, or $1.71 a share, from $47.1 million,
or $1.85 a share, a year earlier.
   Sales of $491.6 million were little changed from the
year-earlier $491.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said that strong prices for its building
materials helped earnings but that markets were weak for its
pulp and converted-paper products. Operating rates for all
facilities were strong in the quarter, Willamette said.</p>
<p>In the first half, profit eased less than 1% to $86.1
million, or $3.38 a share, from $86.9 million, or $3.42 a
share, a year earlier. Sales rose 3.5% to $961.5 million from
$929.3 million.</p>
