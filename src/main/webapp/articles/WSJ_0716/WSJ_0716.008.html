	<p class="article-leader">Pic `N' Save Corp. said it extended its standstill
agreement with Girard Partners L.P. until after July 29 from
July 15, a move that gives other potential bidders for the
Domingus, Calif., discount retailer additional time to
develop proposals.
   Under the agreement, both companies agreed not to solicit
proxies or consents for control of the company. Pic `N' Save
added over the weekend that it had extended the date of its
annual meeting to Aug. 29 from Aug. 15. Holders of record
July 29 will be able to vote at the meeting. Girard holds a
6.7% stake in Pic `N' Save.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In April, Girard Partners, a partnership controlled by
David H. Batchelder, said it planned to make a bid for Pic
`N' Save and indicated that if it succeeded it would sell the
company. Pic `N' Save then said its board authorized its
investment bankers to seek bids for the company.</p>
