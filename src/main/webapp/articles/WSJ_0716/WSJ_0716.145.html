	<p class="article-leader">With the Federal Reserve moving to lower interest rates,
individual investors are going to be tempted in the weeks
ahead to "reach" for higher yields.
   Interest rates had been drifting lower even before Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan surprised the investment community
last week with his statement that the U.S. central bank is
poised to ease rates in an effort to head off a credit
crunch. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes, for example, have
declined to about 8.4% from nearly 9% just a little over two
months ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Fed's action is likely to send ripples throughout the
investment world, driving down yields on the money-market
mutual funds and bank certificates of deposit that have
become the refuge of yield-hungry investors.</p>
<p>Investors eager for the kind of yields they have taken for
granted until recently may find themselves drawn by the
apparent charms of some unfamiliar investments. Government
"agency" securities, mortgage-backed bonds, junk-bond mutual
funds and some other exotic investments all hold out the
promise of yields that are still tantalizingly high.</p>
<p>But investment specialists caution against leaping too
fast. Many of these investments involve special risks that
often aren't easily recognized. Investors who don't take time
to find out what they're getting into -- and to evaluate
whether the potential returns justify the risks -- are
leaving themselves open for a rude awakening.</p>
<p>"More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all
the stock market speculations, scams and frauds of all
times," warns Raymond F. DeVoe Jr., investment strategist at
Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.</p>
<p>For many investors, safe and stodgy Treasury securities
(or money funds and CDs) may still be the best bet.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here's a look at some of the current
alternatives for yield-oriented investors, and some thoughts
from investment advisers on the potential risks and rewards:</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT AGENCY BONDS: Agency securities are issued by a
variety of government agencies and government-sponsored
agencies, such as the Farm Credit System, the Federal Home
Loan Banks, the Resolution Funding Corp. and the Student Loan
Marketing Association. Typically, they yield one-quarter to
about three-quarters of a percentage point more than Treasury
securities. For example, on Friday, 30-year bonds of the
Financing Corp. (or FICO, which was set up in 1987 to cope
with an earlier phase of the savings and loan crisis) yielded
9.06%.</p>
<p>Bonds of FICO, Resolution Funding Corp. and many other
agencies are not backed by the full faith and credit of the
U.S. government -- unlike Treasury bonds, which are fully
backed. But many people consider the agency bonds virtually
as safe as Treasurys because of the expectation Congress
would always feel obligated to rescue an agency that got into
trouble.</p>
<p>For individual investors, the biggest drawback may be that
the resale market for agency securities isn't as strong or
reliable as for Treasurys. That could make it difficult to
sell one's holdings in a hurry. Also check the tax
consequences: Interest on some issues, such as FICO bonds,
are free from all state and local income taxes, as are all
Treasury issues. But interest on others is taxable at the
state and local level. And, to complicate matters further,
the rules vary from state to state.</p>
<p>MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES: Mortgage-backed securities are
"pass-through" securities, created from pools of mortgages
that are packaged together and sold as bonds; the monthly
payments of interest and principal on the underlying mortgage
debt are "passed through" to investors. They can be bought as
individual bonds, with minimums that range from $1,000 to
$25,000, depending on the issuer, or through mutual funds or
unit investment trusts.</p>
<p>Investors can earn more than a full percentage point above
Treasurys on some mortgage-backed securities, such as those
issued by the Government National Mortgage Association, or
Ginnie Mae. For example, some actively traded Ginnie Mae
securities were quoted Friday at a price to yield about
9.75%.</p>
<p>Ginnie Maes are backed by the full faith and credit of the
U.S. government. Mortgage-backed securities issued by the
Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Maes) and the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Macs), while not
directly guaranteed by the government, are considered almost
as secure.</p>
<p>But mortgage-backed securities have some important
drawbacks. Perhaps the biggest is that it's tough to know
exactly what the return will be. Because homeowners may pay
off or refinance their mortgages at any time, the pace of
principal payments on the securities can fluctuate
significantly. An investor counting on a steady flow of
income for years to come, could find the security repaid much
sooner, especially at times of falling interest rates when
homeowners are often tempted to refinance. The investor could
then be stuck with the need to reinvest at a time when rates
are unattractively low.</p>
<p>So-called collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs,
are designed to improve on traditional mortgage securities by
smoothing the rate of early principal payments. But they are
less liquid, more costly to trade and harder to track. What's
more, CMOs come with sizable recordkeeping and reinvestment
headaches.</p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL BONDS: Bonds of several major foreign
countries, easily available to American investors through
mutual funds, pay much higher yields than U.S. issues. For
example, Canadian government bonds due in three years now
yield about 11.5%, British government bonds more than 12.5%,
and Australian government bonds about 13.66%, according to
Salomon Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>"We feel these higher-yielders are going to be attractive
for global investors into 1991," says Nicholas Sargen, a
director of bond market research at Salomon. In addition to
their high yields, these bonds "offer the prospect of
long-term capital gains" for investors because interest rates
in those countries are likely to drop, he contends.</p>
<p>But foreign-bond yields can be extremely volatile. Earlier
this year, surging global interest rates hammered investors
in international bonds, especially Japanese, Canadian and
Australian issues. Moreover, investors need to keep a close
watch on foreign-currency markets: Unexpected currency
gyrations can easily turn big profits into painful losses.</p>
<p>JUNK-BOND FUNDS: Investors in mutual funds that specialize
in high-yield, high-risk junk bonds took a beating last year.
But now that the value of many junk bonds has been pounded
down, some investors have been tiptoeing back into the funds.
That could be a big mistake.</p>
<p>True, junk-bond mutual funds produced a higher total
return (share-price change plus dividends) during the second
quarter than any other category of domestic bond fund,
according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. But if the
economy slumps, companies with heavy debt burdens are likely
to run into severe trouble, many analysts predict. In fact,
they say the main reason interest rates are falling is
because of the economy's growing weakness.</p>
<p>Thus, investors should be especially leery of bonds issued
by companies struggling with heavy debt burdens. "I still
think the junk area is an area to be very wary about," says
Mr. DeVoe of Legg Mason. "I think you'd be making a big
mistake to go diving into this area right now."</p>
<p>HIGH-YIELD MUNIS: While long-term, triple-A municipals now
yield about 7%, some other issues offer much higher taxfree
yields. But deciding whether those yields are ample reward
for the risks involved requires special scrutiny.</p>
<p>Last month, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey,
a well-known and respected borrower in the municipal market,
lent its name to a $202 million issue of "special project"
bonds with yields that went as high as 9.625% -- equivalent
to a taxable yield of more than 13% for an investor in the
28% federal income tax bracket. But any investors who think
it's possible to buy a bond with that kind of yield and get
the backing of the Port Authority's full faith and credit
haven't done their homework.</p>
<p>The bonds sold last month are, essentially, backed by
rental income from a passenger terminal under construction at
New York's LaGuardia airport for Continental Airlines Inc.
and Eastern Airlines. Eastern is operating under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code; Continental is a unit of
Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.</p>
<p>The bonds, which are unrated, involve "a significant
degree of investment risk," according to the offering
statement. "We made sure the bondholders' risk section
pointed out the risks very plainly," says John Haupert, the
Port Authority's treasurer.</p>
<p>While many professional money managers spurned the bonds,
the issue was heavily oversubscribed, with wealthy individual
investors reportedly among the eager buyers.</p>
<p>For individuals who understand the risks and still want
muni junk, mutual funds offer diversification and
professional management. But investing in a high-yield muni
fund doesn't guarantee you'll get higher returns.</p>
<p>According to Lipper, high-yield municipal funds generated
an average total return over the latest five years of 58.8%.
That's just a hair more than the 57.7% total return on
general municipal funds over the same period. In the latest
year, high-yield muni funds had an average total return of
5.20%; general muni funds had an average return of 5.22%.</p>
