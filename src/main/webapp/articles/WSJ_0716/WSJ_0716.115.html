	<p class="article-leader">Eastern Airlines lawyers are expected to meet with federal
officials today to state how the airline will respond to
criminal charges that it falsified maintenance and safety
records.
   Meanwhile, Northwest Airlines Chairman Alfred A. Checchi
has scheduled talks with representatives of Eastern's
creditors, who have a great deal to say about whether the
ailing carrier will be sold.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Eastern Airlines has been told that it will be charged for
altering records at New York's John F. Kennedy International
and La Guardia airports, according to weekend news reports. A
federal grand jury spent 10 months looking into allegations
that Eastern managers signed off on maintenance work that was
never done, a practice called "pencil whipping." The
investigation also covered Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport,
Eastern's main hub.</p>
<p>Last September, Eastern agreed to pay $2.9 million to
settle similar Federal Aviation Administration claims. As in
most such FAA settlements, Eastern didn't admit to violating
the safety requirements when it agreed to pay the penalty.
Eastern has since closed its maintenance facility at Kennedy
airport.</p>
<p>Eastern officials declined to comment on the possibility
of criminal charges. But a spokeswoman for the airline said
the allegations concern practices that occurred two years
ago. Yesterday, the Associated Press, quoting a federal
prosecutor, said Eastern is cooperating in the criminal case
and that the matter may be resolved within weeks.</p>
<p>People familiar with the coming discussions say Mr.
Checchi is to meet in the next 10 days with Eastern
creditors' financial advisers. They say Northwest, a unit of
NWA Inc., is interested in acquiring Eastern's Atlanta gates
and Miami maintenance base. But a transaction, should one
occur, isn't imminent, and there is no plan yet to make a
presentation to the creditors themselves.</p>
<p>However, Eastern's court-appointed trustee, Martin R.
Shugrue, won't rule out the possibility of a sale of the
entire airline, to Northwest or other bidders. Indeed, in a
news conference in New York Friday, Mr. Shugrue said he has
no intention of selling Eastern assets piecemeal. "I think
that's absolutely the wrong way to go," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Shugrue said he has been in contact with Northwest and
that "a sweet deal from Northwest would be a very good
thing." But, he added, a takeover or merger of the airline is
not the only option, although "it's a very viable way to go."</p>
<p>A spokesman for Northwest declined to comment on any talks
between Northwest and Eastern or on Mr. Checchi's expected
talks with creditor representatives. Mr. Checchi has
previously met with Eastern's unions to discuss how to
integrate workers if there is any combination of the
airlines.</p>
<p>Mr. Shugrue made his comments after meeting with the
airline's creditors and presenting them with a preliminary
business plan. He wouldn't release many details of the plan,
saying only that Eastern will sustain "a substantial loss" in
1990, although it will be less than 1989's $852.3 million
deficit. The airline has no specific reorganization plan on
how to emerge from bankruptcy court yet, but Mr. Shugrue said
he plans to have one by year's end.</p>
<p>However, one person familiar with Eastern projections said
the airline's losses are estimated to be at least $180
million for the last two quarters of the year and could total
$450 million to $500 million for all of 1990.</p>
<p>Eastern has been floundering in Chapter 11 since March
1989. Its parent company, Continental Airlines Holding Inc.
(previously Texas Air Corp.), was ousted from day-to-day
control of the carrier in April, after creditors became
unhappy with the parent's shifting plans to reorganize the
airline. Mr. Shugrue has been in command of the airline since
then, with a mandate to reorganize the carrier or find a
buyer for it. Last month, Eastern told its employees both
Northwest and Pan Am Corp. had expressed interest in some
kind of business combination. Mr. Shugrue said Friday,
however, that Pan Am is no longer in talks with Eastern.</p>
<p>Eastern continues to be short on money and on passengers.
Although Mr. Shugrue says conditions are improving, the
percentage of seats the airline filled in May was only 54%,
although the figure improved in June to 61%. The airline has
said it needs 80% of its seats filled to break even.</p>
<p>Eastern has helped fund day-to-day operations with money
held in escrow from asset sales earlier this year and last
year. A source familiar with the creditors committee said
Easter is likely to ask for and get $50 million from that
fund in late August or early September.</p>
