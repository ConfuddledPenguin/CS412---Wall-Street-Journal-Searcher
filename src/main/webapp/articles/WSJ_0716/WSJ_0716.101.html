	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- With the ink barely dry on a broad economic
agreement signed with the U.S. last month, Japanese officials
will sit down today with European Community officials to
begin talks on some finer points.
   The so-called working group on trade issues, agreed on
during a meeting last May between Japanese and EC ministers,
isn't expected to achieve any major breakthroughs this week.
An official of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and
Industry describes it largely as a get-acquainted session
that will set the agenda for discussions in coming months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the European side is bringing to the table several
issues on which it hopes to see at least some signs of
movement. The EC will argue for an easing of tariffs on
sweets, cheese, sherry and port wine, among other processed
foods. Frozen fish quotas are also likely to be discussed.</p>
<p>European officials say they appear to be making progress
in an effort to ease a Japanese ban on imports of at least
one niche product: Italian prosciutto. The prosciutto now
draped over melon at fancy Tokyo restaurants is imported from
the U.S. and other countries believed to be free of certain
swine diseases. (The U.S., itself, lifted a ban on prosciutto
imports just last year after tests indicated that the
ham-curing process eliminated any such diseases in the meat.)</p>
<p>European officials say the Japanese government is
preparing to send a team to Parma, Italy, to inspect curing
plants in that area; but an official dealing with the issue
in Japan's agriculture ministry declined to comment,
explaining that it wouldn't be helpful to encourage
"speculation."</p>
<p>However, European hopes for further liberalization of a
strict tariff system for leather and leather shoes are likely
to meet with strong resistance. Japan has long argued that
its leather industry needs special protection.</p>
<p>Imports of European shoes to Japan have increased rapidly
since Japan converted its quota system to a two-tiered tariff
system several years ago. Imports from the EC are estimated
to have exceeded 1.5 million pairs in the fiscal year that
ended last March, up from 692,000 pairs three years earlier.
But EC officials contend that the current tariff structure
effectively caps annual growth in imports.</p>
