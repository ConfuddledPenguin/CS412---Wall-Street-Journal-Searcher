	<p class="article-leader">BOWLING GREEN, Ohio -- Mid Am Inc. said it agreed to
acquire Citizens Federal Savings & Loan Association,
Bellfontaine, Ohio, in a transaction that doesn't require the
bank holding company to pay cash or issue stock.
   Citizens Federal doesn't meet new capital requirements, so
Mid Am said it agreed to inject capital into the thrift.
Citizens Federal is a mutual institution, which means it
doesn't have any shareholders and is technically owned by
depositors. Mid Am has $930 million in assets; Citizens
Federal, $80 million.</p>
