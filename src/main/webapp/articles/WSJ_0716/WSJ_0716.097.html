	<p class="article-leader">Chock Full O'Nuts Corp. said it might have to take a
charge of as much as 41 cents a share because it terminated
certain leases it had with Riese Organization, the big
closely held New York-based restaurant operator.
   Riese subleases space in some properties that the coffee
producer and food-service company leases from another
landlord. Riese hasn't paid rent to Chock Full since February
because it contends that the properties had deficiencies
including broken air conditioners and elevators. Chock Full
asserts that the cost for any such repairs falls to Riese.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If Chock Full needs to take the charge, a total of as much
as almost $3.4 million after tax, it would cover past-due
rent, accrued future rents, deferred costs, and estimated
future expense incurred in regaining the properties and
carrying them until it re-rents them.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended April 30, Chock Full earned $6.8
million, or 87 cents a share, on $181 million of sales. The
earnings reflect a $1 million gain from a debt redemption.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Chock
Full's common fell 62.5 cents to $7.75.</p>
