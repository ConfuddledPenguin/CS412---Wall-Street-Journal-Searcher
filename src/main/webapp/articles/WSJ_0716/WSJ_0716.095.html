	<p class="article-leader">Cummins Engine Co. agreed to sell a 27% aggregate stake at
a sizable premium to a trio of friendly corporate investors
for $250 million.
   The complex series of agreements associated with the
buy-in holds the promise of "hundreds of millions of dollars"
in additional revenue annually from Ford Motor Co. and
"significant new business opportunities" with Japan's Kubota
Ltd. and Cummins's joint-venture partner Tenneco Inc., said
Henry B. Schacht, Cummins' chairman and chief executive
officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Schacht said in an interview that the move "provides
major new strength to our balance sheet" and will reduce
interest costs. The proposed pact will also provide
additional anti-takeover protection for the diesel-engine
maker, which has blocked overtures from unwanted suitors
twice in little more than a year.</p>
<p>Under the agreements, Ford, already a significant Cummins
customer, will pay $62.50 a share for 1.6 million newly
issued shares of Cummins common, representing an indicated
10.8% primary holding. With the $100 million investment,
Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford also will receive the right to
boost its stake to as much as 20%.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Cummins shares closed at $51.25, up 50 cents.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Ford signed a long-term
agreement under which Cummins will supply midrange diesel
engines for Ford medium trucks. The auto maker has
exclusively manufactured its own midrange diesel engines,
although it currently buys heavy-truck engines from Cummins.
Mr. Schacht said, "We will transition" from the current
status to supplying Ford with all its midrange engines "over
a period of years."</p>
<p>The executive said Ford has annual sales of about 48,000
such medium-size trucks. The agreement "will be several
hundred million dollars of new business for us" annually when
the transition is complete. The pact will also enable Cummins
to "take a major stake" in the U.S. midrange diesel market.
The company's principal focus has traditionally been on
heavy-duty truck engines.</p>
<p>Houston-based Tenneco, Cummins's partner in a
joint-venture that makes engines for Tenneco's J I Case
farm-equipment unit, will buy a similar stake, also for $100
million, but it won't receive an option to boost its stake.
Cummins said it sees "further opportunities to build on the
existing 50-50 joint venture," possibly in fields other than
agricultural gear. But the companies are still discussing
what form that possibly broadened relationship might take,
Mr. Schacht said.</p>
<p>Japanese tractor manufacturer Kubota will buy 800,000
Cummins shares, also at $62.50 apiece, to acquire an about
5.4% primary stake for $50 million. A Cummins unit currently
manufactures Kubota-designed generators in the U.S. under a
licensing agreement. Cummins called the latest pact, formally
disclosed early this morning, "only the beginning of a broad
strategic alliance." As part of the pact, Cummins said the
two companies are discussing manufacturing Kubota engines
through a joint venture in Europe.</p>
<p>Ford and Tenneco will each be permitted to name a
representative to the Columbus, Ind., company's board, which
currently has 13 members. All three companies "have agreed to
certain voting, standstill and other provisions" for at least
six years, Cummins said.</p>
<p>Cummins's largest holder is Industrial Equity (Pacific)
Ltd., with a 14.9% stake. Stock purchases by the unit of New
Zealand-based Brierley Investments Ltd. last year sparked
speculation that Industrial Equity would bid for Cummins. But
after a protracted legal struggle, Industrial Equity reached
a standstill accord that formally eliminated any possibility
that it would further increase its stake. Prior to that,
Britain's Hanson PLC had acquired an 8.8% Cummins stake, but
members of the Cummins founding family bought the Hanson
stake, eliminating that potential threat.</p>
<p>Cummins has been spending heavily on new products designed
to meet overseas competition and satisfy new pollution
guidelines. Its stock has been hurt in recent quarters by the
significant fall in heavy-truck production, although that
cyclical downturn is thought to have bottomed out.</p>
<p>Mr. Schacht called the buy-in "a vote of confidence in the
company's investment in technical activities." He said he
thinks companies' search for "global competitiveness" means
"you'll find networking of transactions like this" more
frequently.</p>
<p>"We believe that, taken together, the agreements we are
announcing today represent giant steps forward for Cummins as
the world leader in our industry," the executive said.</p>
<p>Part of the proceeds from the stock sale will be used to
pay down debt. But $67 million will be used to buy back the
Hanson stake from the founders' descendants, the Miller
family. The family last year converted that stake into Series
A preferred stock. The remaining $37.4 million of the
family's Series A holdings will be exchanged for 580,247
common shares, representing a price of about $64.50 a share.</p>
<p>The result of all the agreements will be to increase
Cummins common shares outstanding 45% to 14.8 million from
10.2 million.</p>
<p>In 1989, Cummins had a net loss of $6.1 million, or $1.52
a share, on sales of $3.51 billion.</p>
