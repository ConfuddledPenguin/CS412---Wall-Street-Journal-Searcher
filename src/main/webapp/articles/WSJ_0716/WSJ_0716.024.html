	<p class="article-leader">STATE OF CONNECTICUT -- Moody's Investors Service Inc.
said it confirmed its double-A rating on general obligation
bonds of the state, which plans to sell $325 million of the
bonds Tuesday. In April, the rating concern downgraded the
bonds' rating from double-A-1. Moody's said that Connecticut
has strong backing for its bonds, but that it has exhausted
reserves and its finances are "vulnerable to economic
slowdown."
