	<p class="article-leader">ELKHART, Ind. -- Excel Industries Inc., buoyed by
increased sales to its largest customer, Ford Motor Co.,
expects to report second-quarter per-share earnings "as much
as 10 cents a share higher" than the year-earlier 36 cents a
share, or $2.3 million.
   James J. Lohman, president and chief executive officer,
said the improved results mark a faster-than-expected rebound
for the maker of automotive windows, which previously
projected "three down quarters in a row," beginning with the
fourth quarter of 1989. The latest period's profit
improvement came on a slight increase in sales to about $77
million from $75.6 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Excel is the leading independent supplier of window
systems to the North American automobile, truck, bus, van,
military and recreational vehicle markets. Although the
automotive market has been in "some sort of a recession," Mr.
Lohman said in an interview, "we've been able to maintain
{our position} with new products."</p>
<p>Mr. Lohman called the company "pleased as punch" about
Excel's recent performance. "We outperformed the industry,
you could say."</p>
<p>While the second quarter showed improvement, the executive
noted that results for the first half were "significantly
under" the year-earlier six months because of the lackluster
first quarter, when slowing production by automotive industry
customers sent earnings plunging 55%.</p>
<p>Mr. Lohman said Excel is placing more of its products,
particularly modular window systems, on new models "that we
didn't have before."</p>
<p>"We have a lot of products on the new Ford Explorer and
Escort and the new version of the Ford Aerostar all-wheel
drive minivan," Mr. Lohman said. Such expanded lines have
"given us new volume while industry sales have been down for
the first six months."</p>
<p>In addition to being Excel's largest customer, Ford is
also its largest shareholder, with a 40% stake. "We sell
about 55% to 60% of our products to Ford," Mr. Lohman said.
The company expects to become Ford's exclusive window
supplier by 1995.</p>
<p>Excel's automotive window products account for about 74%
of its total sales. Its other major customers include
Chrysler Corp., General Motors Corp. and Nissan Motors.</p>
<p>The company also makes injection-molded interior parts,
such as interior door handles and dipsticks, through its
Nyloncraft Inc. subsidiary, its most recent acquisition.</p>
<p>For 1990, Mr. Lohman said he is currently projecting Excel
will match last year's per-share earnings of $1.18, or $7.6
million, and record "exactly the {$277.1 million in} sales we
did in 1989."</p>
<p>Sales of modular windows have been very "bullish," he
said. But softness in the recreational-vehicle industry has
hurt sales to that segment. Mr. Lohman noted, however, that
the RV market "only counts for about 10% of our total sales."</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, Excel completed the
placement of $30 million of subordinated convertible
debentures with two institutional investors. Mr. Lohman said
the financing was a way to "pay down debt and to provide a
basis for acquisitions."</p>
<p>Mr. Lohman said the company has a goal of splitting growth
equally between acquisitions and internal expansion. "We've
been pretty much on target in the last five to six years,"
Mr. Lohman said.</p>
<p>"We are very much in the marketplace for good companies to
complement our current business base," he said.</p>
<p>Currently, 15%-20% of Excel's business is non-automotive,
or what it calls the transportation-related industry,
including recreational vehicles, mass transit, heavy trucks
and military. "We ideally would like to see that 50%," Mr.
Lohman said.</p>
<p>The company last year entered into a technology-exchange
agreement with Wilhelm Schade, a closely held West German
auto parts concern. "We joined so we can jointly participate
in the world-car concepts" that may be developed by Ford and
GM, Mr. Lohman said.</p>
