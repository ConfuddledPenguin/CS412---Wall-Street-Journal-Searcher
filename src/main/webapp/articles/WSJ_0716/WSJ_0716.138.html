period. Sales grew 4.6% to $27.2 million from $26 million.</p>

increased gross margins stemming from better manufacturing
performance and product-cost reductions. Iomega said its
gross margins were 48% in the quarter, compared with 41% in
the year-ago period. The company said its improved margins
allowed it to invest more in sales and marketing and in
research and development in the period.</p>
