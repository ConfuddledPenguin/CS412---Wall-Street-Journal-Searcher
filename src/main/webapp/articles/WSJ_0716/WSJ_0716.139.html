pharmaceutical concern, said 1990 first-half sales fell 2.3%
to 10.89 billion Swiss francs ($7.83 billion) from 11.15
billion francs a year earlier.
   But in local-currency terms, sales rose 4%. The difference
in the percentage changes owes to the Swiss franc's
appreciation the dollar, yen and pound.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Typical of most Swiss companies, Ciba-Geigy didn't
disclose first-half profit or provide an outlook for
second-half sales. But it said it will disclose first-half
earnings in an interim report to shareholders in mid-August.</p>
<p>Despite the overall first-half sales decline, sales in the
pharmaceuticals division, which accounts for the largest
share of the total, rose 3% to 3.13 billion francs. The
agricultural division's sales slipped 3% to 2.79 billion
francs. In local-currency terms, pharmaceuticals sales were
up 11% and agricultural sales were up 3%.</p>
