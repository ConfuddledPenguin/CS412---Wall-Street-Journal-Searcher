	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Britain's retail price index rose 0.4% in June
from May and was up 9.8% from a year ago, the Central
Statistical Office said.
   The underlying level of inflation, which excludes mortgage
payments and community tax charges, was up 6.9% in June,
compared with 7.0% in May.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The statistical office said the 9.8% annual rise was the
highest since March 1982, when the advance was 10.4%. The
office attributed the rise to higher housing costs, as well
as further increases in gas and electricity prices. The
office noted that sharp falls in some food prices were offset
by increases in other foods.</p>
