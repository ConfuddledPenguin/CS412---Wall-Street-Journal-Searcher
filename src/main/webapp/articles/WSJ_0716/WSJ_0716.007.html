	<p class="article-leader">DILLON, Mont. -- Dust swirls around a bunch of ranch hands
in chaps, boots and sweaty Stetsons as they brand the new
calf crop here at the Lazy 8. Cattle bawl, ropes twirl,
cowboys yip and hoot.
   Suddenly, a giant tour bus lumbers into this cowboy idyll.
The bus pulls up to the corral and stops with a loud hiss of
air brakes. Eleven Japanese men in business suits file off
and furiously begin snapping pictures. The cowboys strike
poses. They're used to this drill. After all, these guys may
act like tourists, but they're the real bosses of the Lazy 8.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Or, at least, that's been the case since Zenchiku Ltd.,
Japan's largest beef purveyor, bought the 77,000-acre spread
two years ago. The visitors are mostly senior officers from
Japanese banks and pension funds -- "big investors" in
Zenchiku, says John Morse, 49, who runs the ranch.</p>
<p>As the businessmen step gingerly around cow pies, Mr.
Morse bustles about, lining up his cowhands for the cameras
and extolling the ranch's assets through an interpreter. The
guests grin and bow. But from the back of the pack comes a
mutter, in perfect English, "This ought to be good. We sure
paid top dollar to get it."</p>
<p>Indeed they did. But for $12.6 million, Zenchiku got a
boothold deep in the heart of the Old West. Just down the
road lies Bannock, once the capital of the Montana Territory.
Virginia City, fabled ghost town, lies a rifle shot further.</p>
<p>Given the Japanese fascination with almost anything having
to do with cowboys, it was probably only a matter of time
before they showed up here. Zenchiku's purchase of the Lazy 8
set off a stampede by Japanese investors, who have spent
nearly $100 million on beef-processing facilities in the U.S.
Now hardly a week goes by, says John Barrows, publisher of
the Dillon Tribune, when rumors don't fly that some Japanese
buyer has picked up another feedlot or packing house.
Zenchiku is one of the few to have tried ranching, though.</p>
<p>With Japan getting ready to dismantle its rigid quotas on
beef imports next spring, that nation's food giants sense a
bonanza on the range. Historically, Japan's 120 million
consumers have spurned red meat; the average Japanese eats
six times as much fish as beef. But the Japanese are
beginning to develop a healthy appetite for hamburgers and
steaks.</p>
<p>Zenchiku's experiment here has drawn intense interest, not
just from big U.S. and Japanese food companies but also from
folks here in Beaverhead County (population 8,000 people,
90,000 cattle). "People are wondering whether we're going to
be the Honda of the livestock industry," says Mr. Morse.</p>
<p>Not Honda, exactly, but the Lazy 8 is no Ponderosa,
either. Just inside the ranchhouse door a row of slippers is
neatly laid out for the visitors from Japan. Mr. Morse ushers
his guests into the sprawling living room, which sports
Western and Oriental art and a 60-mile view of the Bitterroot
Mountains. The bar dispenses Japanese beer and saki. A
Japanese garden just outside the front door is raked daily.</p>
<p>Kazuhiru Soma, a 26-year-old Zenchiku marketing trainee,
mingles with the visitors, speaking Japanese. Zenchiku sent
him and a co-worker here to learn the cowboy trade from the
ground up -- literally, as it turned out. Mr. Soma, who has a
black belt in karate, says the first time he went to wrestle
a calf to the ground to be branded, he tried judo. "I figured
it works on people, why not cows?" Mr. Soma ended up in the
dirt. The calf scampered away.</p>
<p>To win the two-year assignment, Mr. Soma had to write an
essay for his corporate superiors explaining why he wanted to
go to Montana. He'd grown up in a Tokyo suburb and hadn't
ridden a horse until he arrived here, so he based his essay
on Westerns he watched as a youngster.</p>
<p>In his new Stetson, scuffed boots and saucer-size belt
buckle, Mr. Soma certainly looks the part of the cowboy. He
drives a shiny Ford Bronco with a bumper sticker that says
"Have a Nice Day" -- in Japanese. But old habits die hard.
When he makes a new acquaintance, he whips out a business
card from a jeans pocket.</p>
<p>Mr. Soma and Tommy Fukutomi, Zenchiku's other imported
cowboy, call Mr. Morse "Sacho" -- sort of the Japanese
equivalent of "Top Dog." When they are finished talking to
him, they bow and back out of the room. "It's the Japanese
way of showing respect," Mr. Morse says.</p>
<p>Zenchiku has replaced the traditional ranch hierarchy,
where orders flowed from the ranch house to the bunk house,
with Japanese-style consensus management. Each week, the Lazy
8 cowpunchers mosey into a barn for what Mr. Morse calls "an
open forum discussion." The cowboys talk about "calving
goals" and "fundamental principles" with Ed Fryer, the
ranch's 39-year-old foreman.</p>
<p>"We try to combine everybody's experience to reach our
goals," says Mr. Fryer, a tall, lean man in faded Levis, who
sounds somewhat more like a manager of a Toyota plant than a
cow boss.</p>
<p>Some of the changes have drawn a cool reception from the
hands. When Zenchiku decided each of the ranch's 2,800 head
of cattle had to sport an ear tag with its computer ID
number, the cowboys balked. "The men had practical problems
from a workload standpoint," Mr. Fryer explains.</p>
<p>Management and cowhands eventually talked things out. But
the new emphasis on togetherness may have spooked some
cowboys, traditionally loners. About half the ranch's work
force has departed since Zenchiku's arrival. The rest, says
Mr. Fryer, "seem to have evolved to our style of doing
things."</p>
<p>Zenchiku has triggered some local xenophobia. When the
company bought the Lazy 8, the Tribune ran a letter from an
angry woman accusing the company of "taking over our ranching
business." Mr. Barrows's predecessor published a cartoon
showing a pair of cows with Japanese flags branded on their
rumps asking if they had to moo in Japanese. "There are just
too many World War II memories hanging around for some people
to be comfortable about this," says Sonja Williams, curator
of the Beaverhead County Museum.</p>
<p>Mr. Morse sought to defuse local hostility by delivering
an "annual report" on the ranch last fall at Western Montana
State College here. About 130 people showed up, more than
turned out for the governor on his last visit. Zenchiku is
also careful to buy local, including about $200,000 in farm
machinery from a Dillon tractor dealer. "People keep score,"
Mr. Morse says.</p>
<p>In any event, Zenchiku seems to be on target with its
major goals -- better productivity and raising a strain of
beef that will tickle the Japanese palate. The company feeds
its cattle a special mixture of barley, corn and sorghum in
an effort to achieve redder meat with bright, white fat.
Japanese consumers think the yellow-tinged fat generally
found in U.S. beef smells bad when cooked, Mr. Morse says.
Each animal is tracked on the ranch computer from birth to
the slaughterhouse. Zenchiku's hands visit packers to make
sure each animal is cut and trimmed to Japanese
specifications.</p>
<p>The payoff for such rigid ranching can be enormous.
Japanese consumers don't flinch at spending $50 a pound for
Japanese-raised "Waygu" beef. Zenchiku is shooting for the
choice-to-prime niche, which goes for about $20 a pound in
Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Morse is pondering a new role for the Lazy
8: as an executive retreat. He envisions Japanese businessmen
jetting here, donning cowboy duds and sitting around
discussing weighty issues with top U.S. officials. Some 250
Japanese have already visited the ranch, usually on their way
to Las Vegas. Today's group will be off to Colorado for golf
in the morning, after a barbeque dinner of homegrown steak --
and rice.</p>
<p>"We're a stop on the tour," says Mr. Morse, readying a
stack of horseshoes and ties bearing the Lazy 8 brand for his
guests. "This is every Japanese businessman's fantasy."</p>
