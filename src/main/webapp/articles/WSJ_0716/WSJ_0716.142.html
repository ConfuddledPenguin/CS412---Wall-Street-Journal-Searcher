	<p class="article-leader">Comfed Bancorp., struggling to keep from being declared
insolvent by federal regulators, said a plan to restructure
the thrift failed to receive approval by the federal Office
of Thrift Supervision.
   Comfed, Lowell, Mass., said that the action was "not
unexpected," but that it continues to seek regulatory
approval.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last month, the holding company for Comfed Savings Bank
said it expected to receive a report from its auditors,
expressing serious doubt about its ability to continue as a
going concern.</p>
<p>The company also reported a net loss of $38.2 million, or
$4.57 a share, for its fourth quarter ended March 31. A year
earlier, Comfed had a loss of $3.5 million, or 42 cents a
share. For the fiscal year, the company's net loss was $47.9
million, or $5.73 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss
of $3.5 million, or 42 cents a share.</p>
<p>Comfed has assets of $1.4 billion. The thrift's decline,
as with many others in New England, came as a result of a
soured real estate market in the region.</p>
