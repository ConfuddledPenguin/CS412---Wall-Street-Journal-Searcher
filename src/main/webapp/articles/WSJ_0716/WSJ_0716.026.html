	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A 120-foot vessel billed as the world's
largest paper boat has completed its maiden trans-Atlantic
voyage guided by an albatross.
   Well, the boat LOOKS like a paper hat, with a high peak in
the middle and a high point on each end. It DID cross the
Atlantic, albeit in the hold of a ship. And an albatross (a
sculpture) WAS part of its cargo.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Origami Line boat, dubbed the QM -- which could stand
for Queen Mary, Queen Mother or Question Mark -- will be
gawked at for a week or so in the North Cove yacht basin on
the Hudson River near the southern tip of Manhattan. That's
just fine with its creator and captain, sculptor George
Wyllie. Stretching the imagination is part of the motive for
building the boat, he says.</p>
<p>The 69-year-old Mr. Wyllie, a Scotsman who served with the
Royal Navy and as a customs officer before turning to art
full-time, says the boat "is as near to paper as you can get
it to be," given its size.</p>
<p>Mr. Wyllie won't identify the "top-secret" special
translucent material; but he says it's "like paper yet not
quite like paper -- like some newspapers are not quite like
newspapers." Inside the boat is the "engine," a big question
mark.</p>
<p>The boat was conceived for Glasgow's 1989 Mayfest to
underscore the erosion of Britain's maritime pre-eminence and
the decline in shipbuilding on the River Clyde.</p>
<p>For U.S. consumption, the boat's manifest includes
notations from Adam Smith, the Scottish economist who penned
"The Wealth of Nations." Mr. Wyllie says Wall Street has
forgotten "The Theory of Moral Sentiments," Mr. Smith's
companion treatise on conscience and morality.</p>
<p>A paper boat is "something poetic, something we all
enjoyed, or should have enjoyed, when we were young," he
says. "It's kind of like making love," he adds. "If you ask
too many questions about it," it loses something.</p>
