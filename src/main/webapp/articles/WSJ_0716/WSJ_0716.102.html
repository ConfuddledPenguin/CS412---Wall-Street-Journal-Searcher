	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- A federal jury awarded Maryland inventor Robert
W. Kearns $6.3 million Friday to compensate him for Ford
Motor Co.'s infringement of his patents for electronically
controlled intermittent windshield wipers.
   The final amount the inventor will receive after his
12-year crusade against Ford remained unclear despite the
jury decision. Under a 1983 ruling against Mr. Kearns for
waiting too long to sue Ford, the auto maker is responsible
only for paying the inventor $5.1 million covering 10 of the
16 years it used the wiper system.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, motions still before U.S. District Court Judge
Avern Cohn could leave Mr. Kearns with anywhere from $13.8
million, if interest is added in, to nothing, if Judge Cohn
reverses the jury's decision that Ford violated the patents.</p>
<p>In any event, the inventor will get far less than he
originally sought. When Mr. Kearns first sued Ford, he asked
for $975 million in royalties and damages. More recently, he
scaled back his demands to $140 million. Ford offered to
settle the lawsuit last February for $30 million.</p>
<p>"I think this case has made it clear to the American
people that if they want to make money, they should invent
something that isn't automotive," said Dennis Kearns, the
inventor's son, after hearing how much the jury awarded.
Attorneys for Ford said they were satisfied with the jury's
decision, even though it was more than they contended Mr.
Kearns deserved.</p>
<p>The Ford case has been watched closely in the auto
industry because it is the first jury verdict to come out of
a series of lawsuits Mr. Kearns has filed in the course of a
12-year legal battle with the auto industry. Since he sued
Ford in 1978, the 62-year-old inventor has lodged similar
patent-infringement actions against General Motors Corp.,
Chrysler Corp., and 20 other major manufacturers.</p>
<p>In these suits, Mr. Kearns claims that nearly all of the
intermittent windshield wiper systems sold on passenger cars
and trucks world-wide violate one or more of his patents.
Intermittent wiper systems allow drivers to vary the speed at
which the wiper blades pass across the windshield. The key
feature allows wipers to blink periodically to wipe away
light rainfall. Mr. Kearns claims that he invented the design
for the first practical, electronically controlled "blinking"
wiper system in 1963.</p>
<p>Dennis Kearns said he expects the case will be appealed,
if his father can afford to carry on the legal fight. But the
inventor's feelings weren't known after Friday's proceedings.
He stormed out of the federal courthouse in Detroit June 28,
at the start of the awards part of his trial. He then
boycotted the remainder of the proceedings in an apparent
protest of several adverse pretrial rulings by Judge Cohn.
Dennis Kearns said Friday he still didn't know where his
father was staying.</p>
<p>He said the inventor was convinced that the judge's
rulings, which limited the evidence his lawyers could
introduce, made it impossible to fully present his case.</p>
<p>Among other things, Judge Cohn ruled that Mr. Kearns
couldn't try to persuade jurors to set aside traditional auto
industry licensing policies in setting the payment for his
wiper designs. In the first trial, Mr. Kearns had called
expert witnesses who testified that the auto industry's
history of paying a few pennies per car in royalties for new
technology was inherently unfair to inventors.</p>
<p>The jury that delivered Friday's verdict was the second to
wrestle with the complex technical issues of this case. The
first jury ruled in January that Ford had infringed on
several of Mr. Kearns's patents for electronic intermittent
wipers. In May, the same jurors reconvened to decide whether
the infringement was intentional, and how much Mr. Kearns
should get in back royalties. The jurors quickly decided Ford
hadn't willfully violated the patents, but then deadlocked
over the issue of damages.</p>
<p>But during the retrial, Mr. Kearns's lawyer, Paul Janicke,
scaled down his demands, arguing that the inventor was
entitled to 5% of the revenue Ford derived from selling the
windshield wiper systems under dispute, plus an additional $5
per car to account for Ford's infringement on his patents.
That came to about $140 million, based on the 20.6 million of
the wiper systems under dispute that Ford sold from 1971 to
1988.</p>
<p>Had Ford and Mr. Kearns negotiated a license agreement in
1971, they probably would have agreed to divide the roughly
20 cents per car in cost savings that the electronic wiper
system offered. Based on that, the company would have agreed
to no more than a nickel per car, for a total payment of
about $1 million in the 1972-1988 period, said Ford attorney
Malcolm Wheeler.</p>
<p>The amount awarded by the jury came to about 30 cents per
car.</p>
