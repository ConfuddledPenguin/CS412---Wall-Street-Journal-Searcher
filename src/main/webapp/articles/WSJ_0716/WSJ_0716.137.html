	<p class="article-leader">HARTFORD, Conn. -- United Technologies Corp. said its
Carrier Corp. subsidiary will close a compressor plant next
year, resulting in an after-tax charge of $18 million for its
second quarter.
   After the charge, which totals $30 million before taxes,
United Technologies expects second-quarter earnings to be
about the same as the $197.3 million, or $1.50 a share, net
income of the year-before period. A spokesman for United
Technologies, which makes aerospace, building and automotive
products, said second-quarter results would be reported
within the week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>United Technologies said the compressor manufacturing
plant in Syracuse, N.Y., was being closed because Carrier can
purchase compressors for its residential air conditioners for
"significantly less" than it can make them at the facility.
The closing, which is set for early next year, will affect
309 employees. United Technologies anticipates many of the
employees will be transferred to other parts of Carrier, the
spokesman said.</p>
<p>Carrier, a heating ventilation and air-conditioning
equipment company with $4 billion in sales last year, already
was purchasing about half its compressors from other
suppliers, said Howard A. Rubel, an aerospace analyst at C.J.
Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.</p>
