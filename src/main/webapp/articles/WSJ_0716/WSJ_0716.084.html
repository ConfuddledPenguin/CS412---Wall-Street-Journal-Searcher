	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Lower energy costs probably won't work quite
as much magic on the service-heavy consumer price index as
they did on June producer prices.
   The June CPI, due out Wednesday, is expected to maintain
its recent habit of outpacing the more heavily
energy-dependent producer price index, which rose only
slightly in Friday's report. This week's other major
indicators include: the May trade deficit, which is expected
to widen after April's sharp shrinkage; June industrial
production and capacity utilization, which are likely to
slow, and June housing starts, which are expected to remain
soft.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The CPI has shown a much more stubborn pattern through
the first half," said Michael R. Englund, economist for MMS
International, a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., New York. For one
thing, there's been no abatement in the fastest-rising
component: health care services. For another, the PPI
benefits much more directly from a drop in oil prices.</p>
<p>Mr. Englund said he expects June's sharply lower energy
costs to continue holding down the PPI during July. But he
added that tamer energy costs are "unlikely to have the same
effect in the CPI," noting that energy makes up about 8.8% of
the PPI and 7.6% of the CPI. MMS expects the disparity
between the indexes to hold for all of 1990; its forecast
calls for a 4.8% year-over-year jump in the CPI and a 4.2%
increase in the PPI.</p>
<p>Roger Brinner, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, Boston,
noted another reason that the PPI can be expected to lag
behind CPI rises: the aging expansion. "Producer prices are
much more sensitive to the business cycle than services," he
said. As the industrial sector slows, "you'll see much more
softness in the PPI than the CPI," he said. Only recently has
the service sector begun to show signs of softness.</p>
<p>The consensus view expects a 0.3% increase in the June
CPI, up slightly from May's rise of 0.2%. Economists said
that food prices continued to moderate in June but that lower
crude-oil prices hadn't yet worked their way down to retail
gasoline prices. Service costs in general, and medical care
in particular, are thought to have continued a steady march
upward. Apparel prices were expected to slide again in June
after May's giveback to earlier sharp gains.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's report on the May trade deficit is expected to
disclose backsliding after April's contraction. The consensus
view calls for a widening to $7.7 billion from April's $6.9
billion. "We haven't lost our appetite for foreign goods,"
said DRI/McGraw-Hill's Mr. Brinner. He expects the trade gap
expanded to "at least $8 billion," noting the likely jump in
imports presaged by already reported April customs-duty
receipts. Exports are also thought to have increased,
although not as much.</p>
<p>Some economists said oil imports jumped in May as prices
slipped, suggesting some summer stockpiling against
cold-weather needs.</p>
<p>The recent lackluster employment data for June pretty much
set the tone for industrial output and capacity utilization
data due out tomorrow. Industrial output is expected to eke
out a gain of 0.2%, following May's 0.6% increase. Capacity
utilization is expected to be unchanged at 83.6%.</p>
<p>Housing starts, due out Wednesday, are expected to
continue the sluggish level of recent months with an annual
rate of 1,150,000 units during June.</p>
