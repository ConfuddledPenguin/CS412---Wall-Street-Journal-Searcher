	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Tuffier-Ravier-Py & Associes' brokerage firm was
suspended from trading Friday, following an inability to
settle its bills. Stock market insiders now fear the action
will frighten some foreigners away from the French market.
   Tuffier, one of the five largest French brokerages, is the
largest to run into financial trouble following France's 1988
stock market deregulation. It is the main unit of the
brokerage group Tuffier & Associes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tuffier said its brokerage arm posted a 62 million-franc
loss ($11.3 million) in the first five months of the year,
after a 16 million-franc net profit for 1989, down from a 52
million-franc net profit for 1988.</p>
<p>In practical terms, the suspension means that Tuffier's
stock brokerage activities are frozen where they were at the
end of the day Friday, when the suspension was announced. The
suspension may not directly affect the group's other
subsidiaries, which weren't mentioned in the exchange
authorities' statement.</p>
<p>If the brokerage doesn't return to business, a rescue fund
will reimburse cash deposits up to 500,000 francs, and share
transactions up to 2.5 million francs.</p>
<p>Foreign experts say they hope the incident won't seriously
affect investment in the French market. "When a business in
the marketplace does have trouble, it does make people
nervous generally," said Geoffrey Kelly, a director of
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., Barclays Bank's London
investment banking unit.</p>
