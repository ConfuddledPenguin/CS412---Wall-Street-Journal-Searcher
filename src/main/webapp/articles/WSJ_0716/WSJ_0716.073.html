	<p class="article-leader">Tomorrow the House will vote for only the second time in
history on a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution.
The last time, in 1982, the vote in favor was 236 to 187, but
it didn't win the necessary two-thirds. The vote this time
will be close. But even if it passes, the danger is the
winning amendment will treat the symptoms of deficit spending
without applying the needed cure: effective restraints on
spending.
   Democratic House leaders bottled up the balanced-budget
amendment in committee for years, even though this year a
solid majority of 249 Members sponsored it. The only chance
of getting a vote in the full House was to persuade 218
Members to sign a discharge petition bringing it to the
floor. Enough Members were leery of offending House leaders
that the petition languished.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The amendment finally broke free last month when GOP Rep.
Chuck Douglas threatened to reveal the names of those
co-sponsors who were hypocritically refusing to sign the
discharge petition. There was a sudden rush of Members to
sign it.</p>
<p>However, all balanced-budget amendments are not made
equal, and there are sharp differences between the two
versions to be voted on tomorrow. Members will first vote on
a proposal by Texas GOP Rep. Joe Barton, which requires a
balanced budget unless three-fifths of Congress agrees to a
deficit. Increases in government revenues would be limited to
the growth of national income, similar to the Gann limit that
curbs spending in California. A three-fifths vote of Congress
would be needed to raise the limit.</p>
<p>After the Barton amendment, Members will vote on one by
GOP Rep. Larry Craig and Democratic Rep. Charles Stenholm. It
would not explicitly restrain government spending, and
requires only a majority of both Houses to balance the budget
through higher taxes. Only the one with the most votes goes
on for a final up-or-down floor vote.</p>
<p>We have always been skeptical of how much a
balanced-budget amendment could restrain the spending habits
of a wily Congress. Members are expert at creating off-budget
spending, and the 1974 Budget Act, which was supposed to curb
spending, has been waived by Congress 398 times in the past
decade. We've felt there was as much chance that an amendment
would lead to higher taxes as it would curb spending.</p>
<p>Even so, we recognize that tomorrow's vote is an important
one. Here is a short guide to determine the extent to which
your representative is serious about controlling the size of
government:</p>
<p>If a Member votes for both the Barton and Craig-Stenholm
amendments, he or she clearly wants to impose restraints on
how much of the taxpayer's money Congress can take. A vote
against both amendments is a clear endorsement of the
tax-tax-spend-spend mentality. But if a Member votes against
the Barton amendment and for the Craig-Stenholm amendment,
they are trying to snow the voters. In effect, they are
telling them they want to limit government borrowing, while
they oppose the amendment that restrains the spending machine
that creates the need for borrowing.</p>
<p>The Barton amendment is too cumbersome for our tastes,
although we doubt that will be the basis of many votes cast
for or against it. But at least it recognizes that the
fundamental problem facing the country is not primarily the
size of the deficit, but the total resources the government
extracts from the private sector as spending. The
Craig-Stenholm approach makes attempts to raise taxes more
visible, but doesn't do enough to make it more difficult to
pass them into law. Members who support it, but not the
Barton amendment, should be in for some tough questions from
voters this fall.</p>
