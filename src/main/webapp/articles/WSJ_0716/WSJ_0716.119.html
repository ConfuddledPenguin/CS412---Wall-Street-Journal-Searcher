	<p class="article-leader">Suffield Financial Corp., citing a continued sluggishness
in New England's real-estate market, charged off about $2.1
million in loan-loss provisions and posted a second-quarter
loss of $2.2 million, or 36 cents a share.
   This compares with a $472,000 profit, or eight cents a
share, the Suffield, Conn., bank-holding company reported the
year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Suffield said it wrote off about $1.7 million of
nonperforming loans in the quarter and took the $2.1 million
charge to replenish its loan-loss reserves.</p>
<p>"There has been no significant increase in nonperforming
assets during the second quarter," a company release said,
adding: "Nevertheless, we believe it is in the best interests
of the company to increase the allowance for loan losses
during these uncertain economic times in New England."</p>
<p>For the six months, the company reported a loss of $5.4
million, or 90 cents a share, compared with earnings of
$988,000, or 16 cents a share, the year earlier.</p>
