	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southmark Corp. reached a settlement with its
creditors in bankruptcy court, but neither side is crowing
about the reorganization plan they expect to be confirmed
today.
   As part of the settlement, creditors accepted pennies on
the dollar. Southmark, meanwhile, staked its future on a
troubled Houston thrift, all that is left of the company's
grand dream of a real estate and financial services empire.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To win creditor approval of the plan, Southmark had to cut
yet another deal with Gene E. Phillips and William S.
Friedman, the company's former chairman and vice chairman,
respectively. The two were ousted from management last year,
but negotiated a severance agreement that gave them control
of $68 million of Southmark assets.</p>
<p>In court Friday, Southmark agreed to settle contract
disputes with the former officers and signed over to them a
Las Vegas shopping center in exchange for a discharge of the
company's debts there. In return, Messrs. Phillips and
Friedman agreed to end their opposition to the reorganization
plan, removing the last major roadblock to the plan's
approval by Judge Steven Felsenthal.</p>
<p>Adoption of the plan would end the roller coaster ride
Southmark has been on for much of the past decade. When Mr.
Phillips took over the company in 1980, it was a nearly
defunct real estate investment trust with just $450 million
in assets. He quickly built it into a $9 billion
conglomerate, patching together 550 brokerage firms, property
management companies, syndicators and mortgage lenders he
acquired with the aid of Michael Milken's former junk-bond
factory at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</p>
<p>But the real estate collapse in the Southwest thwarted his
plans to construct "the Merrill Lynch of real estate." By the
time it filed for bankruptcy-law protection a year ago,
Southmark listed only $300 million in assets and a whopping
$1.9 billion in debts. And that wasn't the worst of it.
Lawyers for the Office of Thrift Supervision claimed $900
million in potential deposit losses at Southmark's wholly
owned San Jacinto Savings Association, and defendants in
hundreds of class-action lawsuits asserted claims of $850
million more.</p>
<p>Faced with years of litigation and bankruptcy costs of $1
million a week, Southmark and its lenders decided to
negotiate. "The plan is the only viable alternative," said
Andrew DeNatale, a creditors' committee attorney.</p>
<p>Under its terms, Mr. DeNatale's clients get $76 million in
cash and a package of securities in a reorganized Southmark.
Shareholders and class-action litigants get modest equity
stakes in the new Southmark, which would liquidate all of its
assets except for Houston-based San Jacinto.</p>
<p>Southmark struck a separate deal with the Office of Thrift
Supervision. The regulators agreed to drop their bankruptcy
claims if the firm agreed to contribute $100 million in
additional capital to San Jacinto. Although the infusion
would make the thrift marginally solvent, regulators offered
no assurances that forbearance for San Jacinto would
continue.</p>
<p>Analysts expect regulators to seize the thrift regardless.
"Name one big S&L that has survived with a lot of land
holdings in Texas," challenged Frank Anderson, an analyst at
Stephens Inc., an investment banking firm at Little Rock,
Ark. Even if regulators remain tolerant, San Jacinto faces a
daunting fight in overbanked Houston against competitors that
have been reconstructed with federal assistance.</p>
<p>San Jacinto has only a "a hope and a prayer," conceded
Southmark Chairman Arthur G. Weiss, "but it's not even a
close call. It's settle or spend years in court."</p>
<p>Mr. Weiss and the Southmark board will resign after
confirmation, to be replaced by a new slate chosen by
creditors. Glen Adams, who directed the liquidation last year
of Great Western Sugar Co., will become president and chief
executive.</p>
<p>Mr. Adams will have a mandate in the plan to investigate
questionable transactions by Southmark and to bring lawsuits
for recovery. "There's potential for substantial recoveries,"
said Southmark's investment banker William D. Forster, a
managing director of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</p>
<p>A court-appointed examiner urged Southmark to sue Messrs.
Phillips and Friedman for mismanagement, and former Southmark
auditor Grant Thornton for negligence. Creditors already have
sued Messrs. Phillips and Friedman to recover the $68 million
in Southmark assets the two men got in the severance
agreement.</p>
