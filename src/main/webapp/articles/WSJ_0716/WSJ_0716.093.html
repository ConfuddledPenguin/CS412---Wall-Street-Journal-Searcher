	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- National Intergroup Inc. said the Delaware
Supreme Court upheld the company's position that a bylaw
amendment requires an 80% majority vote.
   As a result, the company said a consent solicitation by a
dissident shareholder group, Centaur Partners Group, to
expand the board has failed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Centaur had proposed to amend the bylaws of the company to
increase the board to 15 directors from 12. Because Centaur's
solicitation fell short of an 80% majority, only three seats
will be up for election at the annual meeting July 25, as has
been planned since last year.</p>
<p>Centaur said it was disappointed in the ruling, but would
try to elect three nominees to the board. National Intergroup
is a wholesale drug distributor.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
National Intergroup closed at $18.50, down 25 cents.</p>
