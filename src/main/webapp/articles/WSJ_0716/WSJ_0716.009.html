	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Coffee-producing nations incurred losses of
around $4 billion during the past 12 months, following the
collapse of an agreement to support prices, International
Coffee Organization officials say.
   "The economic situation of African countries, notably
Uganda, Cameroon, Rwanda, Burundi and Ethiopia, is critical,"
says Owusu Akoto, chief economist of the organization, which
acts on behalf of producing and consuming nations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bulk of these African countries' total exports come
from coffee sales, and they are suffering under a huge
foreign debt burden, he says. South and Central American
producers such as Colombia, Guatemala, Costa Rica and El
Salvador are also hurting, Mr. Akoto says. But they managed
to pare their losses to some extent by raising the volume of
their exports to a market that wanted to buy their better
quality "mild arabica" coffee, he says.</p>
<p>International coffee production of 90 million bags of
coffee was already well in excess of consumption totaling 80
million bags in 1989, Mr. Akoto says. And producers sold an
extra 10 million bags from their stockpiles.</p>
<p>As a result, average international coffee prices collapsed
to around 69 cents a pound from $1.15 at the end of June
1989. Despite a rally from lows of 72 cents a pound earlier
in the year, New York futures prices of high grades of coffee
are currently around 85 cents, down from 1989 peaks of $1.60.
The poorer-quality robusta futures that are traded in London
are #558 a metric ton, equivalent to 45 cents a pound,
against 99 cents in the summer of 1989.</p>
<p>"After being protected by the coffee agreement for many
years, producers didn't know what it was like to be in a free
market," says Rob de Jong, a director of E.D. & F. Man
(Coffee) Ltd. There was a rush to sell, he says.</p>
<p>Since production, helped along by a good Brazilian crop,
could rise to as much as 100 million bags, officials say,
only a drought, frost or a new agreement will succeed in
lifting prices.</p>
<p>Moreover, some 10 million bags are in inventories of
Western consumers; so European and U.S. merchants and coffee
manufacturers aren't rushing to buy coffee, dealers say.</p>
<p>Unless the price of coffee rises, Colombia and other
Central American producers will be squeezed this year, Mr.
Akoto says. They don't have sufficient stocks to boost export
volumes.</p>
<p>Consuming and producing nations will discuss differences
at a meeting next Monday and lay the groundwork for a
resuscitation of the coffee agreement in September, says
Nestor Osario, Colombia's delegate at the International
Coffee Organization. Colombia, in particular, needs a higher
coffee price to be able to fight cocaine producers.</p>
<p>So far, however, the two main players in the agreement,
the U.S. and Brazil, are still far apart in their aims,
delegates say.</p>
<p>The U.S., the world's biggest consuming nation, will
accept a support mechanism that responds to free market
forces, U.S. officials say. Export quotas that were
previously applied to lower or raise supplies of coffee
should be allocated on a fairer basis, officials say.</p>
<p>Since Central American nations produce the mild coffee
that consumers require, they should be allowed to sell more
coffee, officials say. The agreement broke down last year
because Brazil, the biggest producer of coffee, refused to
reduce its own export quota. Brazil was and still is prepared
to accept free market conditions, delegates say. Since coffee
accounts for only a quarter of its total exports, Brazil is
under less pressure than other producers.</p>
<p>That stance is still unchanged, a Brazilian delegate says,
but the nation is open to dialogue when meetings begin later
this month.</p>
<p>Regardless of what happens at the meeting, the worst could
be over for the coffee market, Mr. de Jong of E.D. & F. Man
says. Consumption is improving, and over the next decade East
European markets will boost coffee sales. East Europeans
drink only two pounds of coffee per capita annually, he says,
whereas consumption in Western Europe is around 12 pounds per
capita.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for producers, however, any rise in
consumption this year won't be sufficient to match
production, Mr. Akoto says. Manufacturers haven't followed
the free market and cut prices sufficiently, he says.</p>
<p>In Britain, for example, the Office of Fair Trading is
investigating coffee manufacturers, he says.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:</p>
<p>Energy</p>
<p>The week ahead may not show as steep a climb in oil prices
as last week's $1.89 trading rise for the August contract on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, but market watchers do
expect crude futures prices to continue to move higher. The
impetus: The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
forged a strategy for curbing its production, which had
contributed to a world oil glut. Saudi Arabia's acceptance of
a lower output percentage and fierce lobbying by other
Persian Gulf oil ministers elicited promises of production
cuts from OPEC's worst two quota violators -- Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, gasoline futures will continue to be firm
because a significant supply of an important high-octane
gasoline additive remains unavailable. An explosion 10 days
ago at an Arco Chemical Co. plant in Channelview, Texas,
stopped production of the substance, methyl tertiary butyl
ether, for at least several weeks, according to the company.
Authorities late last week were investigating, with some
skepticism, the Islamic Liberation Front's claim that it was
responsible for the refinery disaster that killed 17 people.</p>
<p>Gold</p>
<p>Has gold bottomed out?</p>
<p>Traders will be watching to see if gold's rebound late
last week is just a blip or longer lasting.</p>
<p>The August gold futures contract advanced a total of
$10.10 an ounce Thursday and Friday following Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments Thursday that the central
bank may be ready to lower interest rates to offset rising
rates of commercial banks.</p>
<p>"It's the first time I can recall a Fed chairman signaling
ahead of time that rates may be changed," one analyst said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, August gold rebounded from a low of $352.00,
which was an intraday loss of $3.60 an ounce, to close $3.90
higher at $359.50. On Friday, the August contract surged as
high as $369.00, which represented an intraday gain of $9.50,
before easing somewhat to end $365.70, a net gain of $6.20.
All told, this amounted to a swing of $17 an ounce from
Thursday's low to Friday's high, a very volatile reaction to
Chairman Greenspan's comments.</p>
<p>Several factors still could restrain gold's climb,
however. For one, it's unclear how unsettled the market
remains because of Saudi Arabian gold sales, which hit the
metal early last week and caused sharp price declines for the
fourth time since March. Also uncertain is whether producers
will take advantage of the rally to sell and stifle the
advance, as has often happened before.</p>
<p>Grains and Soybeans</p>
<p>Soybean futures prices are likely to continue to rebound
this week following the release, after the close of trading
Thursday, of government figures showing smaller than expected
stockpiles of soybeans and higher than anticipated exports.
Soybean futures rallied Friday in reaction to the report,
with the November soybean contract gaining two cents a bushel
to settle at $6.325 a bushel. Due apparently to the unusually
wet spring that kept farmers from planting as many soybeans
as expected, stockpiles by Aug. 31 will have fallen 20
million bushels from earlier estimates to 275 million
bushels. By Aug. 31 next year, the government reduced its
soybean stockpile estimates by 80 million bushels to 265
million bushels. The government's latest six-to-10 day
forecast for the Midwest may boost corn futures prices. The
National Weather Service forecast called for above average
temperatures across many Midwestern growing regions, which
could limit corn pollination in some areas, analysts said.
Corn futures for December delivery gained 1.5 cents a bushel
Friday to settle at $2.6725 a bushel.</p>
