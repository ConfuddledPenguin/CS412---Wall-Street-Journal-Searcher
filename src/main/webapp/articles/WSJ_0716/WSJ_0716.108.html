	<p class="article-leader">UNITED EDUCATION & SOFTWARE Inc. (Los Angeles) -- This
troubled company said that Aaron Cohen resigned as president
and chief executive officer. The company, whose principal
unit filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection from
creditors in December, didn't say why Mr. Cohen resigned and
he couldn't be reached for comment. United Education said
that its 67-year-old chairman, Stanley R. Schoen, will
immediately assume Mr. Cohen's titles. Mr. Cohen, 54, will
remain a director and will become a consultant to the
company's ailing correspondence-school unit. The subsidiary
operates about 12 schools, down from a peak of about 35
schools in late 1988.</p>
