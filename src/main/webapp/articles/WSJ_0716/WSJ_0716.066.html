	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Sales of domestically built vehicles were
surprisingly strong in early July, causing guarded optimism
that the industry's lingering sales slump is easing.
   Auto makers reported that sales of U.S.built cars, trucks
and vans rose 2.5% in the first 10 days of July to 255,493
from 249,298 vehicles a year earlier. Following the trend of
recent months, Japanese auto makers reported a 36% gain in
sales of their U.S.-built cars in the period. Chrysler Corp.
posted a double-digit percentage decline, leading a 2.5% drop
in domestic car sales by the Big Three.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The overall early-July sales gain came on the heels of
robust sales in late June. Early-July sales ran at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.3 million cars -- the
first time since February that the annual rate of car sales
in the first 10 days of a month topped seven million. Sales
in the period the previous year ran at a 7.4 million clip,
according to a Commerce Department formula.</p>
<p>Car dealers were pleasantly surprised by the improved
results, especially because the Big Three auto makers
recently raised base prices on 1990 models after trimming
some buyer incentives.</p>
<p>"You've got a buyer out there today who's really not
afraid of anything, unless he loses his job," says Hoot
McInerney, owner of several new-car dealerships.</p>
<p>The stronger sales results, combined with lower inventory
levels, make it less likely that auto makers will be forced
to offer steep incentives in order to clear lots for 1991
models coming out this fall. The results also make it easier
for auto makers to boost vehicle production in the third
quarter as they had planned.</p>
<p>Sales of trucks and vans improved in the first 10 days of
July more than car sales. Domestic auto makers said
lighttruck and van sales rose 5.6% to 99,273 vehicles, while
sales of U.S.-built cars rose less than 1% to 156,220
vehicles.</p>
<p>The market "was stronger than I figured," said David
Healy, an auto industry analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd
in New York. "My temptation is to raise my {industry sales}
forecast for the year." But Mr. Healy said he wants to see
what happens in the mid-July sales period before making such
a move.</p>
<p>General Motors Corp.'s car sales stayed about even with
sales a year earlier but saw an 18% gain in truck sales. The
company attributed that increase to across-the-board gains in
its Chevrolet and GMC Truck units. However, sales of the auto
maker's new plastic-body minivans have been weak. So far this
year General Motors has built 90,089 of the vehicles but has
sold only 62,326.</p>
<p>Chrysler lost ground with its cars and trucks. The No. 3
U.S. auto maker's domestic-car sales fell 19% despite
advertisements in which company chairman Lee Iaccoca seeks to
compare Chrysler cars favorably with Honda Motor Co. models.
Chrysler truck sales dropped 14% partly because its Jeep
Cherokee models are facing stronger competition.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge in that segment comes from Ford
Motor Co.'s Explorer, which helped raise Ford's truck sales
6.1%. Ford's car sales remained flat.</p>
<p>Nissan Motor Co. said its sales appeared weaker because
sales in the previous year were greatly boosted by
incentives. Nissan also blamed the decline on lower
availability of its Sentra subcompact, which will be replaced
with a redesigned version in September.</p>
<p>Total sales of U.S.-built vehicles plus imported vehicles
sold by the Big Three in early July increased 1.8% from
262,625 vehicles a year earlier.</p>
