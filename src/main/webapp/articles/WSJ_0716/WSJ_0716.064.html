   Plays Out on PCs</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>HOW would you like to change the Earth's past and shape
its future?</p>
<p>That's the concept behind SimEarth, a personal computer
game created by Will Wright, the Berkeley, Calif., author of
SimCity, last year's hit computer game with highbrows that
let players rebuild actual cities, such as San Francisco
after the 1906 earthquake and Hamburg after it was bombed in
1944, or design imaginary cities from scratch.</p>
<p>SimEarth extends this idea to the planet itself, giving
players a chance to change the course of the Earth's history
by altering environmental forces. A few inspired choices, and
"dinosaurs won't die off but will rule, and humans won't ever
appear," Mr. Wright says.</p>
<p>Mr. Wright hopes that SimEarth, which will be available on
Apple Macintosh computers next month and on International
Business Machines compatibles soon afterward, will raise
awareness about the intricate connections among natural
forces. In the game, for example, it's a challenge merely to
lay the conditions for multicellular life, much less to spark
the Renaissance. Indeed, promoting civilization is hard: Mr.
Wright says a player bent on improving humanity's lot may
have to unleash a meteor shower that puts an entire
prehistoric people at risk. "Without periodic extinctions,"
he says, "evolution may not occur."</p>
<p>In designing a program to simulate the possible lives of
the Earth, Mr. Wright joins a growing tradition. Computer
models came into fashion in the 1970s, when the Club of Rome
issued a gloomy warning on environmental trends based on a
simulation. Today, such models lay the basis for everything
from forecasting the depletion of the ozone layer to
predicting next week's weather.</p>
<p>Mr. Wright doesn't take too gloomy a view. A skillful
player can keep the Earth alive until the Sun explodes five
billion years from now. And even then, Mr. Wright affords the
player the tools to colonize outer space.</p>
<p>Laptop Makers in U.S.</p>
<p>Look to Japan for Color</p>
<p>NEW color screens will whet people's appetites for laptop
computers, but they may upset the balance of power between
U.S. and Japanese computer makers.</p>
<p>The Japanese are the dominant suppliers of these critical
parts, and the specter of a shortage has U.S. companies
hustling to nail down long-term supplies of color displays
for laptops, especially screens that use an advanced
active-matrix technique just now coming on the market.</p>
<p>U.S. companies fear a repeat of the the 1980s, when
Japan's behemoths gained control of the market for memory
chips by pricing these parts at below cost to drive U.S.
suppliers out of the business. As a result of that coup, U.S.
computer makers have paid more for memory chips, a major
materials cost for their products.</p>
<p>Among U.S. computer makers, IBM seems least likely to be
caught in a bind. It struck a deal last year to produce these
screens jointly in Japan with Toshiba. Hitachi and Sharp also
are offering these displays to U.S. companies. Once volume
production begins next year, they will sell their now-pricey
color screens at below cost in order to prime demand,
predicts Stanford Resources Inc., a San Jose, Calif., market
researcher.</p>
<p>Making Networks as Fast</p>
<p>As Machines They Link</p>
<p>DESIGNERS are starting to pay attention to a thorny
problem involving increasingly powerful desktop computers
used by engineers and scientists.</p>
<p>Almost all of these computers are linked with other
machines, and the networks aren't getting any faster. As a
result, the raw speed of the new workstations is being wasted
when users share or swap data, which occurs often.</p>
<p>Designers are tackling the problem by building devices
that transfer data among workstations and among different
networks of machines at a hundred times the current speed of
10 million bits of data a second.</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation, the Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory and many private companies are funding
efforts to build speedier networks, which will change the
nature of computing by making it possible for a scientist to
receive live video or realistic color models on a
workstation.</p>
<p>But this change won't be painless. Current standards for
networks, such as Ethernet and Token Ring, may need to be
overhauled or even scrapped. And so will current desktop
computers used by researchers. "This is probably the single
most interesting problem that I'm dealing with," says Andreas
Bechtolsheim, a computer designer at Sun Microsystems Inc.</p>
<p>Recording Music on CDs</p>
<p>Isn't Around the Corner</p>
<p>CONSUMERS won't be able to record on blank compact disks
for a few years.</p>
<p>Equipment that both records on and plays CDs is considered
a sure-fire hit with consumers, but a combination of factors
have kept such machines off the market so far.</p>
<p>Officials at Sony Corp. and N.V. Philips, which control
patents on most CD technology, say that a few technical
problems remain before such products are finished, but that
the biggest hurdle is persuading the music industry to
withdraw its opposition to recordable CDs, which the industry
thinks will reduce sales of prerecorded CDs.</p>
<p>After seeing the music industry delay the introduction of
digital-audio tape, there's little optimism that fears about
recordable CDs can be dispelled quickly. "We expect the same
(opposition) . . . so we won't force-feed this," says a Sony
executive.</p>
