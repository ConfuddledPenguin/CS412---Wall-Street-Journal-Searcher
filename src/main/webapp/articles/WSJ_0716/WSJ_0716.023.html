	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Aluminum Co. of America said its directors
voted to accept all provisions of Pennsylvania's new
anti-takeover law. The legislation, signed into law April 27,
allows publicly owned concerns to exclude themselves from all
or part of its anti-takeover provisions within 90 days of
passage.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Alcoa also said its directors acted to redeem all rights
outstanding under the company's 1986 shareholder rights plan.
These rights currently trade with Alcoa common stock. A
redemption price of five cents per right will be paid Aug. 25
to shares of record Aug. 3.</p>
