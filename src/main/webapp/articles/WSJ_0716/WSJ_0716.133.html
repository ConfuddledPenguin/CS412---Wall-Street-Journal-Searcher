	<p class="article-leader">MADRID -- American Airlines and Iberia Air Lines, Spain's
state-owned airline, reached an agreement in a bitter dispute
over Iberia's legal access to computer booking systems in the
U.S.
   Iberia agreed to rejoin American's world-wide Sabre
computer reservation system in exchange for a modification of
the system by American.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a statement Friday, the Spanish airline said the AMR
Corp. unit pledged to change the way international flights
are listed in its computer displays. Iberia had complained
that it was discriminated against on the company's displays.</p>
<p>American also said it would sell its services to travel
agencies at cost, no longer underselling Iberia's booking
services. The company added that the new formula was more in
line with European Community standards.</p>
<p>The rift between the two airlines began in March when
Iberia said it would withdraw from American's Sabre
reservation system, claiming the system prejudiced customers
against buying Iberia tickets.</p>
<p>American said Iberia's withdrawal was aimed at harming the
U.S. carrier's marketing efforts with Spanish travel agents.</p>
<p>The fight intensified when American Airlines filed an
unfair-competition complaint against Iberia with the U.S.
Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>When the department upheld the complaint, Iberia
retaliated by bringing the dispute to EC officials.</p>
<p>Since then, EC and U.S. officials have met and urged the
two airline companies to resolve their differences.</p>
