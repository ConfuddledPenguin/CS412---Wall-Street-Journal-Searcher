	<h3>Defense Giants' Quarter Profits May Elude Hits --- Consensus Has McDonnell And General Dynamics Disputing Cost Overruns</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">The aerospace industry is confronting a big question as
second-quarter earnings reports begin to filter out: Just how
bad will it be for McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General
Dynamics Corp.? Or will it be bad after all?
   The two defense contractors disclosed last month that they
would probably face write-offs because of delays in
developing the A-12 attack plane for the Navy. Now, though, a
consensus seems to be emerging on Wall Street that the
companies -- especially McDonnell Douglas -- may be inclined
to hold off recording any such adjustments. Instead, they
would signal that they underestimated their costs on the
program by a certain amount, but are contesting who will pay
for the overrun -- the companies or the government.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"All you need to do is say a claim is being filed, rather
than declare the loss up front," Paul Nisbet of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. says. "And then you wait
until the matter is adjudicated."</p>
<p>But he adds that there seems to be some "disagreement
between General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas over how they
should handle the situation." Industry observers indicate
that General Dynamics may, on its own, register a charge to
earnings, given that it was booking a profit on the A-12
program for some time. McDonnell Douglas, by contrast, never
did this. And given that the company's loan agreements with
its bankers are tied to its net worth, or assets minus
liabilities, McDonnell Douglas has a special incentive to
avoid write-downs whenever it can.</p>
<p>The companies, both of which are based in St. Louis,
decline to comment on the A12. So do two Defense Department
spokesmen.</p>
<p>Were the companies forced to take a second-quarter hit on
the A-12, it could be substantial. Several securities
analysts, including Peter Aseritis of First Boston Corp. and
Jerry Cantwell of Wertheim Schroder & Co., estimate that each
company could be in trouble to the tune of $300 million
before taxes.</p>
<p>Admittedly, though, the analysts arrive at this figure in
a roundabout way: The companies are said to have underbid
Grumman Corp. on the A-12 contract by $1 billion. Figuring
that perhaps $400 million of that sum was legitimate, because
General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas have significantly
more experience with stealth aircraft technology, that leaves
$600 million to account for, and this amount is then split
between the two.</p>
<p>Besides the A-12, there could be a few other surprises.</p>
<p>Howard Rubel of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. is wary that
General Dynamics may soon have to take a charge on the
single-channel ground and airborne radio system, or Sincgars,
project for the Army. Moreover, market watchers warn that
Lockheed Corp. might report some sort of write-off as a
result of its decision in May to pull its aircraft operations
out of Burbank, Calif.</p>
<p>And McDonnell Douglas recently suggested that it may have
"serious cost problems" on several other fixed-price
development pacts with the Pentagon.</p>
<p>But what many believe is McDonnell Douglas's biggest
thorn, the C-17 cargo plane, shouldn't draw blood in
second-quarter results.</p>
<p>During a tour earlier this month at the sprawling C-17
factory in Long Beach, Calif., company officials emphasized
that no write-offs on the program were in sight. "We're right
up on the bulkhead" of the contract's cost ceiling, but
"we're going to make it," asserts John Capellupo, deputy
president of McDonnell Douglas's transport aircraft unit.</p>
<p>He adds that the company's MD-80 commercial jet line
turned around during the second period. "We promised 34, and
we did 34," Mr. Capellupo says. This success should help
offset continuing high development expenditures on the MD-11
three-engine jet.</p>
<p>Such success also would help damp rumors that McDonnell
Douglas is headed for a bankruptcy-law filing or that the
company's Long Beach facilities will be sold. Speculation to
that effect has been circulating through the financial
markets for the past few days, as has talk that Chairman John
McDonnell is going to resign. The company says all of this is
"absolutely false." But people at the company say that during
the next couple of days, Mr. McDonnell will hold a news
conference and meetings with employees, where he will explain
how he expects to cut $700 million a year in operating costs;
thousands of layoffs are likely to be announced, and the work
force is jittery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Martin Marietta Corp., Northrop Corp. and the
parts supplier Rohr Industries Inc. all look poised to turn
in solid, if unspectacular, results for the quarter.
Companies more oriented toward defense electronics, including
E-Systems Inc. and Loral Corp., are expected to show
year-to-year gains. Raytheon Co. already has logged an 8%
increase in profit for its latest three months.</p>
<p>But the clearest winner, as usual, will be Boeing Co. The
Seattle-based company delivered 100 commercial aircraft
during the second period, up from 81 a year earlier. The
latest number includes 15 747400s, Boeing's most profitable
product.</p>
<p>"The theme for the quarter," Mr. Rubel of Cyrus J.
Lawrence says, "is that you've got to own Boeing" stock.</p>
