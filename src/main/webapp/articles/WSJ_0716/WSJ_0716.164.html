	<p class="article-leader">"I don't have to do business with the enemy," asserts Mark
De Michele, president and chief executive officer of Arizona
Public Service Co., the state's largest electric utility and
a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp.
   General Electric Co. is the enemy, Mr. De Michele says, as
long as its Kidder, Peabody Group Inc. investment-banking
subsidiary continues to "plot tactics" for PacifiCorp. Since
November, the Portland, Ore., utility has made four
unsolicited takeover offers for Pinnacle West or Arizona
Public Service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After Pinnacle rejected PacifiCorp's latest offer of $1.82
billion in May, PacifiCorp said it would explore other
options, including a hostile tender offer for Pinnacle's
stock. That hasn't happened. But PacifiCorp has kept a small
office in Phoenix even though Arizona isn't one of the seven
states in which the utility has operations.</p>
<p>Last week, Mr. De Michele told Energy Daily, a trade
publication, that Arizona Public Service would stop buying
breakers, transformers, meters, and other equipment from
General Electric until Kidder Peabody severs its ties with
PacifiCorp. The decision was endorsed by Richard Snell,
Pinnacle's chairman and chief executive officer, and other
members of his staff.</p>
<p>A spokesman for General Electric, based in Fairfield,
Conn., said that the company's power-generation division
sells equipment to PacifiCorp and Arizona Public Service and
"we're trying to serve our customers." He confirmed that
Kidder Peabody is advising PacifiCorp, but declined to
comment further.</p>
<p>Mr. De Michele concedes that Arizona Public Service
business isn't very significant for General Electric "in the
overall scheme of things" but he believes the new policy will
hurt, anyway. So far this year, Arizona Public Service has
done about $9 million in business with General Electric; last
year the total was about $13 million. General Electric's
total 1989 revenue was about $54 billion.</p>
<p>Arizona Public Service's new policy falls short of being a
total ban because the utility can't get certain replacement
parts for the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station from any
other company. General Electric provided the turbines for the
nuclear plant's three units.</p>
<p>The Arizona utility feels especially betrayed by General
Electric because the supplier's representatives "have made an
all-out effort over the years to be friends" and "now they
want to put me out of business," Mr. De Michele said.</p>
<p>His ire was sparked in March when Kidder Peabody's chief
adviser to PacifiCorp publicly extolled her client's takeover
bid at a utility industry conference. At a Southwest Utility
group meeting in Phoenix, Elizabeth Sobel "came out talking
about what a great deal," PacifiCorp was offering. "I took
umbrage at some of the things she said," Mr. De Michele said.</p>
<p>After voicing his complaints to various people at General
Electric recently, Mr. De Michele received a call last week
from Michael Carpenter, Kidder Peabody president and chief
executive officer. "His bottom line was that it wouldn't do
any good for {Kidder Peabody} to resign because somebody else
would {take their place.}"</p>
<p>Mr. De Michele countered that Arizona Public Service has
done "a tremendous amount of work" with Kidder Peabody during
the past 20 years. "There may even be some
conflict-of-interest or other ethical issues there. {Kidder
Peabody} could be using information garnered in connection
with us."</p>
<p>The General Electric spokesman said Kidder Peabody would
never misuse proprietary information. "Obviously, client
confidentiality is a given," he said.</p>
