	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- In the battle to pull in new mutual-fund
customers, Prudential-Bache Securities is planning a new
strategy: Let 'em in free.
   Prudential-Bache, which runs the country's 13th largest
fund group with $17 billion in assets, has asked the
Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to sell its
mutual funds to customers of other broker-sold mutual funds
-- without charging a sales commission.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Prudential-Bache spokesman declined to comment on the
filing, noting that the SEC still hasn't declared it
effective. But others note that, while Prudential-Bache, a
unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America, may be the
largest fund group ever to make such an offer, its offer
isn't unique.</p>
<p>"We've done it for three years, and we're not the first,"
said Edward Mahoney, president of AMEV Advisers Inc., which
allows owners of other broker-sold funds to buy AMEV funds,
provided they show proof that they sold the other fund within
the previous 60 days.</p>
<p>The idea is to allow a broker to switch a customer between
funds without the client's being charged two sets of
commissions.</p>
<p>What has Prudential-Bache got to attract other fund
customers? Kanon Bloch Carre & Co., a Boston mutual-fund
research firm, gives high marks to Prudential-Bache's utility
fund, its intermediate-term government-bond fund and its
convertible-bond fund. But overall, Kanon Bloch ranks
Prudential's fund family as 40th out of 94.</p>
