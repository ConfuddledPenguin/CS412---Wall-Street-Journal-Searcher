	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The government's thrift-bailout bonds, scorned
as the dogs of the government bond market just a few weeks
ago, are suddenly being viewed as prime investments.
   Bailout bonds are the debt securities sold by the
Resolution Funding Corp., a federal agency created by
Congress to help finance the government's rescue of savings
institutions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So far Refcorp has issued $18 billion of the bonds,
including $5 billion of 30-year bonds sold Tuesday. The
latest auction went smoothly, in contrast to two previous
disastrous auctions of 40-year Refcorp bonds. In the earlier
mishaps, the government sold most of the bonds to Wall Street
dealers, which got stung when they couldn't drum up enough
demand from investors.</p>
<p>But now investors are warming to the Refcorp bonds. Demand
for the securities has picked up considerably since last
week's auction.</p>
<p>"The yield pickup is very attractive," said Allen David
Ellison, an analyst and portfolio manager at Fidelity
Management & Research in Boston. He said that with Refcorp
offering essentially the same ironclad government guarantee
as a plain vanilla Treasury bond, some investors are
wondering: Why invest in a Treasury at 8.5% when Refcorp
yields are 8.9%?</p>
<p>Even some money managers who were down on the bonds a few
months ago like Refcorp a little better now.</p>
<p>Take Ian McKinnon, head of fixed-income investments at
Vanguard Group, the mutual fund company. After Refcorp's
40-year bond auction in April, he riled Treasury officials by
telling USA Today that the Refcorp bond sales were producing
"dogs" for the market and saying: "Maybe the government is
trying to start a kennel."</p>
<p>Well, Mr. McKinnon isn't so harsh these days. Although he
didn't buy Refcorp bonds at last week's auction, "we will
take a good look at them in the secondary market and at the
next auction," he said. "I guess this proves that every dog
has its day."</p>
<p>The new fondness for Refcorp stems from several factors:
the higher relative yields on the securities, analysts'
reports saying Refcorp bonds are nearly indistinguishable in
credit quality from Treasury securities, and a general
perception that interest rates eventually will fall, which
would boost the value of all fixed-income investments.</p>
<p>And as investor acceptance grows, analysts expect the
spread, or gap, between Treasury securities and Refcorps will
narrow, which in effect will make Refcorp bonds more
valuable. At last week's auction, the 30-year Refcorps were
issued with an average yield of 8.93%, or 0.39 percentage
point higher than yields on Treasury securities.</p>
<p>Although marginal yield differences don't always excite
small investors, in the intensely competitive institutional
world of mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds,
even a quarter of a percentage point is considered a
tremendous difference.</p>
<p>But there's more allure to Refcorp than just a higher
yield. Last week, traders said, Metropolitan Life Insurance
Co. purchased a large amount of Refcorp bonds -- possibly as
much as $1 billion -- while selling corporate and
mortgage-backed bonds. On the surface, this might seem like
an odd trade, considering mortgages and corporate bonds have
higher yields than government bonds.</p>
<p>Although MetLife doesn't like to talk about its investment
decisions, other money managers say that big institutional
investors -- especially insurance companies -- are playing
what they call "a relative performance game" with the Refcorp
bonds. Currently, prices of high-grade utility and telephone
company bonds and certain mortgage-backed bonds have become
what the market considers "expensive" relative to Treasury
bonds, meaning only that yields on these securities have
narrowed relative to yields on Treasury bonds. Meanwhile,
Refcorp was sold at a relatively wide spread to Treasurys.</p>
<p>But, says Barbara Kenworthy, a portfolio manager at
Dreyfus Corp., "if you buy the economic downturn theory,
Refcorp spreads will narrow because they are
government-backed bonds, while corporate spreads will widen."
Ms. Kenworthy essentially is suggesting that corporate bonds
will become cheaper and Refcorp bonds will rise in value.</p>
<p>If that happens, "what you give up in yield you more than
make up for in relative performance," she said.</p>
<p>"We view this as a win-win situation," said Mike Martino,
executive vice president and portfolio manager at Back Bay
Advisors, a subsidiary of the New England Life Insurance Co.
"You can win with rates coming down, and you can win with
yields on Refcorp coming closer to yields on Treasurys."</p>
<p>Mr. Martino said that many investors shied away from
Refcorp bonds in the beginning because they didn't fully
understand what they were. "No one likes to invest in the
unknown," he said.</p>
<p>Part of the unknown had to do with the future size of
Refcorp offerings. Congress limited Refcorp's borrowing
ability to $30 billion. Yet as estimates of the S&L bailout's
cost grew from $100 billion to $500 billion, some investors
feared the government would raise the limit and swamp the
market with Refcorp bonds, which would overwhelm demand and
put pressure on prices. Now, however, it appears that more
and more Treasury borrowings will be used to finance the
thrift rescue, which will add to the size of the budget
deficit but not the size of future Refcorp offerings.</p>
<p>Once the full $30 billion have been issued, the size of
Refcorp bonds on the market will be large enough to make it a
fairly liquid market, but small enough for the bonds to
maintain a certain "scarcity" value.</p>
<p>Refcorp bonds were also boosted by analysts' reports. J.P.
Morgan & Co., which is trying to convince reluctant investors
that Refcorp bonds are suitable alternatives to Treasurys,
said in a recent report that Refcorp bonds are "essentially
indistinguishable from U.S. Treasurys."</p>
<p>Corporations and municipalities also are being targeted by
investment firms as potential Refcorp buyers and have been
told that Refcorp bonds could be used as part of a complex
plan to "defease" existing debt. Recently, the accounting
firm of Deloitte & Touche said the credit quality of Refcorp
bonds is high enough to use for defeasing purposes.</p>
<p>Defeasance is a technique whereby a bond issuer may
discharge old, low-rate debt by purchasing a smaller amount
of higher-yielding U.S. Treasury debt. The Treasurys are put
in a trust to service the old debt being retired.</p>
<p>Though the Refcorp bonds aren't direct obligations of the
Treasury, the Treasury guarantees interest payments. And the
principal is secured by zero-coupon Treasurys, purchased by
Refcorp from the Treasury.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Bond prices rose as the Federal Reserve sent what traders
interpreted as a clear signal of a credit-easing move.</p>
<p>Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan prepared investors for the
action by saying Thursday that the Fed was poised to ease
credit because of mounting evidence of a credit crunch. He
didn't say when the move would come, but the answer came
Friday, shortly before noon EDT, when the Fed took action in
the money markets to inject funds into the banking system.</p>
<p>"It's clear now that the Fed has eased," said Donald J.
Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Manhattan Bank. Henry
Engler, economist at Chemical Bank, agreed: "I think it's
about as clear as it gets."</p>
<p>The Fed's maneuver led to a further widening of the gap
between short-term and long-term interest rates, known in
bond market jargon as a widening of the yield curve. Several
investment managers fear the Fed pulled its trigger too soon,
and thus that the bond market's rally may be nearing an end.</p>
<p>Easing credit now could lead to higher inflation later
this year and possibly also drive down the American dollar in
the foreign-exchange markets, investment strategists say.
Some also argue that the Fed should have waited until
Congress and the White House reach a definitive agreement on
slashing the government's huge budget deficits. Now, they
say, Washington lawmakers face less pressure to take bold
action on the deficit.</p>
<p>The Fed's move "probably won't have much of a stimulative
effect on the economy because it's so small, but it also does
little to improve the inflation outlook," says Bob
DiClemente, senior economist at Salomon Brothers Inc. "If
you're looking to the Fed as a bulwark against inflation,
then this doesn't support that case."</p>
<p>Thus, Mr. DiClemente adds, "if you've missed the bond
rally, now is not the time to get in, because we're not
likely to get a big rally from here."</p>
<p>Despite the Fed's move to lower rates, banks once again
showed they are in no rush to cut their own rates. The prime,
or base, rates at major banks remained unchanged at 10%.
Banks use the prime as a peg to set rates on loans to many
small and medium-sized companies, as well as on loans to many
individual investors.</p>
<p>Banks long have demonstrated an uneven way of reacting to
Fed policy changes. When the Fed tightens credit, banks
typically react quickly by raising their prime rate. But when
the Fed cuts rates, banks discover reasons to delay lowering
their rates.</p>
<p>In the long-term bond market, Treasury bond prices rose
Friday by about half a point, or $5 for each $1,000 face
amount. For example, the government's 30-year bonds were
quoted late in the day at 103 7/32, up from 102 21/32
Thursday evening. The yield fell slightly to 8.45% from
8.49%.</p>
<p>Yields fell more on shorter-term Treasury issues. For
example, the yield on the government's two-year notes fell to
8.12% from 8.21%. Thus, the gap between the two-year and
30-year issues widened to 0.33 percentage point from 0.28
percentage point Thursday and only 0.14 percentage point in
late June.</p>
<p>Rates also fell on short-term Treasury bills. The latest
three-month Treasury bill was quoted late Friday at a
discount rate of 7.58%, for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.83%.
That compared with a rate of 7.68% to yield 7.92% Thursday.
The rate on six-month bills wound up at 7.49% to yield 7.89%,
down from 7.57% to yield 7.96% Thursday.</p>
<p>The Fed's move Friday came as the interest rate on federal
funds, or reserves that banks lend each other overnight, was
trading at 8.25%. Now, traders say, the funds rate is likely
to hover close to 8%, down from 8.25% previously.</p>
<p>Mr. Fine of Chase Manhattan described the Fed action as "a
very modest" move and predicted it won't be the last this
year. "I think further ease will come but not for awhile, not
until they {Fed officials} see definitive evidence of a
sustainable moderation in inflation," he said.</p>
<p>In other markets:</p>
<p>-- Corporate bond prices rose. Investment-grade bonds rose
about 1/4 to 3/8 point. In the high-yield market, junk bond
prices rose, too.</p>
<p>-- Junk bonds issued by department and chain stores posted
strong gains, following reports showing stronger retail
sales.</p>
<p>-- Municipal bond prices also rose. The New Jersey
Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bonds of 2018 climbed about 1/2
point to 99 1/2 to yield 7.23%.</p>
