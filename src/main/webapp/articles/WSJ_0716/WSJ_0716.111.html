	<p class="article-leader">Ampal-American Israel Corp., New York, said it was being
sued in New York state court by three plaintiffs who claim to
be holders of Ampal's Class A stock.
   Ampal has industrial, agricultural, real estate, hotel and
other interests in Israel.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The suit, filed as a class action, seeks to enjoin the
proposed sale of the industrial loan portfolios of Ampal's
three banking subsidiaries in Israel to Bank Hapoalim B.M.
Under an agreement reached earlier this month, Bank Hapoalim
would acquire the loan portfolios for $875 million, their
book value at Dec. 31.</p>
<p>Ampal, which said it intends to "vigorously defend the
action," said the plaintiffs contend the purchase price is
unfair. Ampal's president and three other directors also were
named as defendants.</p>
