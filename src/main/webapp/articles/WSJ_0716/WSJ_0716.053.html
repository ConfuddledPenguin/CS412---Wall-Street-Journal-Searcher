	<p class="article-leader">Congress is finally in full cry about the $300 billion
savings-and-loan debacle, blaming political foes, the thrift
industry and now President Bush's son. Things can sure get
nasty when 535 people try to change the subject.
   As November elections loom, scapegoats are suddenly in
season. The cry is to stop "fraud" by "S&L crooks," whoever
these mysterious shysters might be. The Senate fell all over
itself to pass a bill to let judges throw life sentences at
"S&L kingpins," and a House committee whooped through a bill
to assign 600 more FBI and 300 Secret Service agents to
investigate. While fraud should be punished, the main purpose
of the shouting is to deflect attention from the real causes
-- and remedies -- of the S&L mess.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Put the S&L Crooks in Jail," says a new banner in
Illinois Democrat Frank Annunzio's committee room.
Apparently, he doesn't mean Fernand St Germain, the former
House Banking Committee chairman and Mr. Annunzio's soul mate
through years of doing the thrift industry's bidding. A new
Common Cause study reports that Mr. Annunzio received $51,620
from S&L interests in the 1980s, the eighth-highest total
among current House Members.</p>
<p>New Jersey Democrat Robert Torricelli was so upset he
denounced the Common Cause study on the floor of the House
last week. Mr. Torricelli made his last big public splash as
the leading defender of Jim Wright's ethics. He was
unimpressed by special counsel Richard Phelan's evidence that
Mr. Wright threatened to expose one S&L regulator as a
homosexual and browbeat others to go easy on Democratic
campaign contributors.</p>
<p>We could go on (and will in the future), but the point is
that the essential cause of the S&L debacle is in danger of
being lost amid the political name-calling. That cause is an
industry that was born in, and thrived on, political
influence. Congress created, and then nurtured with such
subsidies as federal deposit insurance, a special banking
industry for housing. If that lesson is lost, the solutions
will elude us forever.</p>
<p>The lesson is symbolized by Mr. St Germain, whose close
ties to S&L lobbyists eventually cost him his seat in
Congress. Mr. St Germain personally raised the level of
deposit insurance for thrifts to $100,000 from $40,000 in the
dark of night on March 5, 1980. Years later, he -- aided by
then-Speaker Wright and House Democratic whip Tony Coelho --
helped weaken legislation that would have solved the crisis
at an early date. They had plenty of accomplices, many of
them lathered with the $11.7 million in 10 years of
thrift-industry campaign contributions documented in the
Common Cause study.</p>
<p>Fraud no doubt made things worse, but here some
distinctions need to be made. If Charles Keating and other
S&L operators steered thrift assets for personal use, that's
fraud and should be punished. But the key point is that Mr.
Keating and others could flourish because the system staked
them the taxpayer guarantee of deposit insurance. Even
without committing fraud, they had the legal right to
speculate on risky loans because they had this giant subsidy.
In a phrase that should be repeated again and again, their
risk was "socialized" on all of us.</p>
<p>Neil Bush's problems, on the other hand, appear to be of a
different sort. As a director of the Silverado thrift, he had
a normal fiduciary duty to shareholders. The federal civil
suit that may yet be brought against him would be for
neglecting that fiduciary duty, not for any fraud. Neil
Bush's apparent conflict of interest is that as a director he
voted to approve loans to a business partner. There is no
need to condone this, but unless one is operating solely at
the level of political opportunism, Neil Bush does not appear
to symbolize the thrift debacle.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the mythology of "fraud" will build until
George Bush explains to the country what really caused the
thrift crisis. If he doesn't, Senator Howard Metzenbaum will
continue to make things worse by attacking those willing to
buy failed thrifts that end up in government hands. His
extraordinary one-day inquisition last week sent a message
that any thrift buyer can someday expect to appear before his
committee.</p>
<p>In retrospect, it's clear that the biggest mistake of the
Bush presidency has been failing to educate the public about
the thrift debacle's roots when it first proposed its bailout
legislation. Even 18 months later, the Brady Treasury still
has nothing to say about deposit insurance, while Democrats
are circling around the President's son. All of us -- and Mr.
Bush himself -- may yet pay for this inexplicable silence.</p>
