	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Corporate Data Sciences Inc. said an
investor group that includes its president, Keith Brackpool,
is negotiating the possible sale of a 37% stake in the
company to an unidentified investor group and two British
companies.
   In December 1988, the investor group that includes Mr.
Brackpool, Nelson Asset Management, purchased its stake for
$20.6 million from the same two British companies, Polly Peck
PLC and Telfos Holdings PLC.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Corporate Data currently has 13.5 million common shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>According to the company's financial statements, one of
the British companies, Telfos Holdings, is also a principal
in Nelson Asset Management, which is based in Bermuda. The
other principals in Nelson Asset Management are Kazan Corp.,
a private European investment group, and Alfred Shoenberg, a
former director of Corporate Data and the current president
of Aril Group Inc., which is 50%-owned by Corporate Data.</p>
<p>In a related move, the company said James Frew, 63 years
old, resigned as chairman and a director of Chicago-based
Consolidated Packaging Corp., which is 92%-owned by Corporate
Data Sciences. The company said Mr. Frew's resignation from
the packaging company is a "prelude to the anticipated
involvement of a new investor group."</p>
<p>Mr. Frew couldn't be reached for comment. A Corporate Data
spokesman said his resignation from the post "was mutual." He
will continue as a consultant.</p>
<p>Corporate Data Sciences said the two British companies
have also provided credit facilities to Nelson in connection
with the purchase of the 37% stake. The company said Poly
Peck has extended the due date of a loan to Nelson until Aug.
30 to allow a "satisfactory conclusion" to the talks.</p>
<p>Corporate Data is involved in a restructuring that will
divide it into two separately traded companies, Consolidated
Packaging, a paper concern, and Aril Group Inc., a holding
company that will have kitchen-cabinet operations. Mr.
Brackpool said he plans to resign as president of Corporate
Data when the restructuring is completed.</p>
<p>Corporate Data said it expects to complete the previously
announced exchange of its Medallion Kitchens subsidiaries for
16.9 million shares of Aril Group Inc. common stock before
the end of this month. The exchange will increase Corporate
Data's stake in Aril to 81% from about 50%. Aril, formerly
called Marcom Telecommunications Inc., sold its
telecommunications business last December, leaving it without
any operating business.</p>
<p>When that exchange is completed, Corporate Data said it
will distribute 22.1 million shares of Aril to Corporate Data
stock of record Jan. 22 at a rate of 1.63 shares for each
share of Corporate Data held.</p>
