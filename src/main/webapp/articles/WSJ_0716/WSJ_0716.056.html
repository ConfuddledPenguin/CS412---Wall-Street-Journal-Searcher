	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Inflation has been behaving a bit better
recently. The U.S. consumer price index rose only 0.2% in May
and producer prices just 0.2% in June. But what is likely
over the longer run, over the decade of the 1990s?
   Some well-known economic forecasters are surprisingly
sanguine -- surprisingly in view of the past two decades of
relatively high inflation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a recent research report, Edward Yardeni, the director
of economics at Prudential-Bache Securities, forecasts that
the consumer price index will drop to 4% by year end from
4.6% on a December-to-December basis last year. By 1993, he
predicts, the annual inflation rate will be between 2% and
3%. And he sees "a good chance that in the 1990s the United
States will be among the countries with the lowest inflation
rates in the world" even though he also predicts the American
economy will keep growing.</p>
<p>Mr. Yardeni lists the forces that he expects to damp
inflation in the 1990s.</p>
<p>"The supply side of the global economy," he says, "is
likely to expand as rapidly as the demand side." The upshot:
"Companies will find that prices will be harder to raise,"
and executives will be under pressure to cut costs.</p>
<p>Increasing this pressure, he says, will be a surge in
world trade as "more and more countries adopt free-market
economic systems." So, "global competition will intensify"
and "keep a lid on inflation." And he expects oil prices to
rise "no more than 3% to 5% per year, on average," though he
acknowledges the risk of another oil shock.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Yardeni sees some helpful trends in the
U.S. He says that "productivity growth should improve
dramatically," with labor shortages providing "the major
driving force." He believes both wage inflation and upward
pressures on employee benefit costs "should moderate."
Moreover, "lower interest rates and the restructuring of
corporate balance sheets towards more equity, and less debt,
should lower financing costs for many companies" and "reduce
pressures to raise prices."</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Yardeni predicts that the world's central
bankers will keep fighting inflation with their monetary
policies.</p>
<p>On that count, Mr. Yardeni gets support from Mickey D.
Levy, chief economist at First Fidelity Bancorp.</p>
<p>Looking at the inflation outlook a couple of years ahead,
Mr. Levy says:</p>
<p>"I am decidedly optimistic, more than the Federal Reserve,
more than the administration and more than the consensus
forecasts. I think that the Fed wants lower inflation and is
backing it up with action. And we're just starting to reap
the rewards."</p>
<p>Three years ago, he says, the Fed started to tighten
credit, and "initially it hurt profits. In the next stage,
unit labor costs have started falling." In the second half of
this year, he sees the consumer price index down to a 4%
annual rate of increase, and in 1991 he puts it at 3 1/2%. He
notes that recently the U.S. has had "five good months of the
producer price index and two good months of the consumer
price index."</p>
<p>The producer price index, which measures the prices that
factories and other producers receive for their goods, fell a
bit in February, March and April and rose only 0.3% in May
before posting its 0.2% increase for June. From June 1989 to
June 1990, Mr. Levy notes, intermediate goods rose only 0.2%,
and crude materials fell 3%.</p>
<p>But what if unemployment rises? Will the Fed stick to its
guns? "By and large, yes," Mr. Levy says, despite the
inevitable political pressure to ease credit in an effort to
stimulate the economy and bring unemployment quickly back
down.</p>
<p>Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter
that surveys 51 economists monthly, finds the consensus
outlook for inflation next year mildly optimistic. On the
average, the Blue Chip group expects the increase in consumer
prices to narrow from an anticipated 4.8% this year to 4.2%
next year.</p>
<p>The highest inflation forecast for 1991 among the Blue
Chip economists comes from Michael Evans of Evans Economics
in Washington. He expects the CPI to surge 5.7% next year, up
from the 5.2% rise he anticipates for this year.</p>
<p>"I don't think inflation is licked at all," Mr. Evans
says. He lists five reasons: "Wage gains will continue to
rise." Productivity growth will be "anemic." Service costs,
and especially medical costs, will keep surging. The dollar
will slide a bit, and therefore import prices will climb. And
"energy costs will rise substantially."</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Mr. Evans expects inflation to average 6% a
year. He believes that new environmental legislation will
raise industry's costs significantly. In the mid-1970s, he
comments, environmental laws were a major force behind the
steep inflation.</p>
<p>In addition, he expects productivity to rise only about 1%
a year, partly because he anticipates "relatively little
investment" in the 1990s. And he thinks many industrial
costs, especially energy costs, will climb sharply. He also
says "the budget deficit will be forever" and will tend to
lift costs.</p>
<p>So, whose forecast is most likely to be borne out during
the decade ahead? Many of Mr. Yardeni's arguments seem highly
persuasive. Most of them perhaps can be summed up in the
notion that the world seems to be facing few shortages likely
to accelerate inflation.</p>
<p>But even though most of the forces he cites don't stem
directly from monetary policy, the Fed will, of course,
continue to play a major role, and it will remain subject to
political pressures favoring inflation. So, any forecast of
inflation tends to turn partly into a forecast of political
trends. And predicting political trends can be even dicier
than predicting economic ones.</p>
