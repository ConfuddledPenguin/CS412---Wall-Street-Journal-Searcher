	<p class="article-leader">Before a word is uttered in the New York Shakespeare
Festival's production of "The Taming of the Shrew," there are
happy hints that a rollicking good time is in store. The
lights come up on a set of a dusty frontier town that looks
like it belongs in "High Noon" or "Stagecoach." The music, at
first a sweet Elizabethan melody played by trumpets and
recorder, changes to a merry two-step in piano and bass. A
crow caws and tumbleweeds spin across the stage. Could this
be "Annie Get Your Gun?" Shakespeare's sparring lovers, Kate
and Petruchio, look a lot like Annie Oakley and Wild Bill
Hickok. You just about expect them to interrupt the rope
tricks and the gun games and burst into a chorus of "Anything
You Can Do I Can Do Better."
   It can't be easy to do "The Taming of the Shrew" these
days without provoking feminist indignation. On the surface,
Shakespeare's story of a headstrong maiden subdued by a
masterful husband doesn't work well in a world where even
Disney is letting spunky heroines have their way. Writing
nearly a century ago about Kate's final speech -- the one
that begins "Thy husband is thy lord," -- George Bernard Shaw
wrote: "The last scene is altogether disgusting to modern
sensibility. No man with any decency of feeling can sit it
out in the company of a woman without being extremely ashamed
of the lord-of-creation moral. . . ."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thanks to A.J. Antoon's farcical and ironical direction,
this "Shrew" is unlikely to offend anyone with Shavian
sensibilities. The lovers are as well matched intellectually
and emotionally as any in a Shaw comedy of the sexes. In
keeping with the celebrity mania of Joseph Papp's Shakespeare
Festival, which in the winter season headlined Kevin Kline as
Hamlet and Raoul Julia as Macbeth, the hero and heroine are
played by two actors famous in other media. Morgan Freeman
(Petruchio) recently starred in the films "Driving Miss
Daisy" and "Glory," and just finished work on the movie
version of Tom Wolfe's "Bonfire of the Vanities." Tracey
Ullman is the television comic of a thousand faces.
(Incidentally, Ms. Ullman, an Englishwoman, is about the only
non-American to appear in Mr. Papp's Shakespeare marathon,
which is now at its halfway mark.)</p>
<p>Ms. Ullman plays Kate with a tomboyish fury. She swaggers
and spits like a cocky cowpoke, and twirls her gun as deftly
as Annie ever did. Her tantrums are torrential -- no mere
stamp of the foot for her; she falls down on her stomach,
flailing her arms and legs. At the same time, there's an
undercurrent of vulnerability about her, when she steals an
admiring glance at Petruchio, the only man who's ever
possessed enough self-confidence to appreciate her spirit.</p>
<p>Some actresses have overcome the problems of the final
speech -- the one that so embarrassed Shaw -- by winking at
the audience as if to say that they are letting their
egotistical husband believe he's the king of the castle where
in fact they're really the power behind the throne. Ms.
Ullman's delivery has none of that coyness. It's a fierce
defense of her loyalty to the man who is both her "protector
and friend," as feminist Germaine Greer wrote when she gave
the play her stamp of approval in "The Female Eunuch."</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman brings both an electric sexuality and a
certain nobleness to the role of Petruchio. Swagger for
swagger, he's as cocksure as Ms. Ullman, and it's as much fun
watching the shrew tame her tamer as it is the other way
round. There's also a moral dimension to his crazy bullying
of Kate. He employs a quite solemn tone when he gives his
speech about killing a wife with kindness; by his outrageous
behavior, he hopes to bring Kate to a deeper understanding of
his love and the roles of husband and wife.</p>
<p>There are a few stand-outs among the supporting cast, all
of whom are adequate, if not memorable. Mark Hammer appears
to have been inspired by Slim Pickens, that staple of old
Westerns, for his buffoonish interpretation of Gremio, an
elderly suitor to Kate's goody-two-shoes sister Bianca.
William Duff-Griffin gives a marvelously hoity-toity
performance impersonating Vincentio, the rich father of
another of Bianca's ardent suitors. And Norris M. Shimabuku
is hilarious as a Chinese tailor abused by Petruchio. He is
alternately servile and contentious, blending two Asian
stereotypes from old movies in a way that might anger some
humorless Asian-American media watchdogs.</p>
<p>The actors and actresses use a mishmash of accents. Most
of the supporting cast lay on broad Western drawls, which
work surprisingly well. Petruchio's cigar-chomping sidekick
Grumio sounds like he just played the Borscht Belt. Mr.
Freeman has a languorous Southern accent, which adds to his
sex appeal but is sometimes too soft to compete with the
frenetic action. Ms. Ullman lapses into Cockney sometimes,
like Eliza Dolittle.</p>
<p>Mr. Antoon has streamlined the play, by deleting the
introduction, which has nothing to do with the plot anyway,
and by making a few cuts here and there to speed up the
action. His tinkering also includes switching the names of
several of Petruchio's servants to Western monickers -- Joe
Bob, Beau and Sugarsop. Normally, I'd be inclined to grumble
about a director's monkeying around with Shakespeare's text,
but these changes do suit the zany tone of the production.</p>
<p>That zaniness ended abruptly the evening I saw "Shrew."
Just after the curtain was figuratively drawn at the outdoor
Delacorte Theatre in Central Park, a man in a ten-gallon hat
appeared on stage and begged our indulgence as he launched
into a lugubrious speech about the plight of the National
Endowment of the Arts. It's hard to attend an off-Broadway
play these days without being required to sit through such
partisan politicking -- attacks on Jesse Helms, charges of
censorship. At least, Mr. Papp had the courtesy to save his
spiel for the end, permitting the audience the option of
leaving. But it ruined the afterglow of his charming play. No
matter what side you stand on in the NEA dispute, you're
liable to walk out of the theater seething, not singing.</p>
