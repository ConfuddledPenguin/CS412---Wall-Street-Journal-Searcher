	<p class="article-leader">You wouldn't think Rite Aid would be on anyone's buy list.
Both the company and its president, Martin Grass, are on
trial in Cleveland on a felony charge of bribing an Ohio
official. Profit has been mediocre for two years.
   Yet buying of the stock has begun, and could accelerate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Whatever the trial's outcome, analysts say, the stock
probably will rise. The verdict, expected later this month,
will end 17 months of uncertainty that have scared Wall
Street. "The investment community would react very positively
to the cloud being lifted," says Robert Roth of Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets.</p>
<p>Even if the company is convicted and pays a fine, Mr. Roth
believes the stock will climb. A jail term for Mr. Grass or
loss of pharmacy licenses would hurt the stock, but both
prospects are "unlikely," he says. He rates the stock "above
average," with potential to outperform the market 10% over
the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Fans say the shares, at 36 3/8 Friday, could rise to the
low to mid-40s in the next year or so as profit rebounds now
that an acquisition binge has been completed. There are
skeptics, of course. At more than 13 times Street estimates
of current-year earnings, the stock is a "hold" in the view
of independent analyst Monroe Greenstein, who says: "It's not
overpriced, but not cheap either."</p>
<p>Fidelity Investments purchased 1.5 million Rite Aid shares
in the first quarter, despite disappointing earnings and the
trial. "We see both of those negative issues coming to an end
and a lot of upside potential," says Larry Greenberg,
assistant manager of Fidelity's Magellan Fund.</p>
<p>Says the manager of another fund, which recently acquired
300,000 shares, "Without the trial, this would be a $40 stock
and we wouldn't be in it. How else could you buy a stock with
15% growth potential so cheap?"</p>
<p>Rite Aid has bought more than 700 stores since 1987,
boosting its total to 2,360 stores in 22 states. Heavy
expenses for store remodeling and computer systems held the
company's rise in profit from continuing businesses to only
1% in fiscal 1989 and 3% in fiscal 1990, excluding one-time
charges.</p>
<p>Rite Aid got into legal trouble after acquiring more than
250 stores in Ohio. In January 1989 the Ohio Board of
Pharmacy fined the company $50,000 for allowing
nonpharmacists access to prescription drugs. Rite Aid
complained of unfair treatment. Then in April 1989, Mr. Grass
and the corporation were charged with bribery for allegedly
paying about $33,000 to obtain the resignation of a pharmacy
board member in an alleged scheme to control the board. Rite
Aid denies any wrongdoing, contending that the payment was a
legitimate buy-out of a consulting contract.</p>
<p>Most analysts believe that Mr. Grass, the 36-year-old son
of Rite Aid's chairman and chief executive officer, Alex
Grass, will be acquitted. Even a conviction shouldn't hurt
the company's earnings recovery, says analyst Walter Loeb.
With big acquisitions largely digested, Rite Aid's profit is
starting to pick up. After rising 8% in the first quarter,
ended June 2, earnings are widely expected to rise 15%
annually this year and next. Consensus pershare estimates are
$2.65 for fiscal 1991 and $3 for fiscal 1992. For the year
ended March 3, Rite Aid had profit from continuing operations
of $81.9 million, or $1.97 a share, after a 32-cent charge
for closing a video rental business.</p>
<p>"No matter what happens, I think the stock will go up" to
the low 40s within 12 months, Mr. Loeb says. He rates the
stock a hold, but is considering a buy recommendation once
the trial is over.</p>
<p>Analysts see one big risk if Rite Aid is convicted: States
could try to revoke its pharmacy licenses. Oddly enough,
there is less danger in Ohio than elsewhere. Ohio laws
haven't any provision for penalizing retail pharmacies for
bribery or other nondrug crimes. The pharmacy board could
conceivably revoke Rite Aid's separate license as a wholesale
distributor of controlled substances. But an Ohio official
says such action is "unlikely" and would have little, if any,
effect on retail pharmacy operations.</p>
<p>In New York, where Rite Aid has 252 stores, conviction in
another state would be considered "professional misconduct"
and could result in license revocation, says Charles Adams,
executive director of the state Office of Professional
Discipline. The state can investigate and recommend action to
the Board of Regents. (No action could be taken if Mr. Grass
were convicted but Rite Aid wasn't.) Pennsylvania law is less
clear. The state Board of Pharmacy probably would have
authority to take action, most likely a fine or reprimand,
says Michael Barrett, chief prosecutor for the state's Bureau
of Professional and Occupational Affairs. His staff will give
the board a legal opinion following the trial.</p>
