	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on
about $2 billion of debt of Xerox Corp. and certain
subsidiaries, asserting that the company's profitability
"will remain under pressure" and that debt leverage will
remain near current levels over the intermediate term.
   S&P lowered senior debt ratings of Xerox, Xerox Credit
Corp. and Xerox Credit Overseas Finance N.V. to single-A from
single-A-plus. Subordinated debt was lowered to
single-A-minus from single-A and preferred stock to
single-A-minus from single-A-plus. The single-A-1 commercial
paper rating was affirmed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for Stamford, Conn.-based Xerox, a
manufacturer of copiers and duplicators, had no comment on
the S&P announcement.</p>
<p>S&P said document processing business profitability has
improved, but "the deteriorating profitability of the
financial services side . . . continues to drag down overall
returns."</p>
<p>It noted that Xerox's Crum & Forster Insurance Group is
facing a "continuing downturn in the property casualty
insurance industry."</p>
<p>S&P also said it lowered its claims-paying ability rating
for Crum & Forster Insurance Group to single-A-plus from
double-A. It had been placed on S&P's Creditwatch
surveillance list June 1 because of concern about the quality
of reinsurance recoverables and potential impact on
capitalization.</p>
<p>S&P said that since the mid-1980s, Crum & Forster has
"instituted needed controls" to strengthen its reinsurance
program but suffers from "reinsurance exposures from business
written prior to this time."</p>
