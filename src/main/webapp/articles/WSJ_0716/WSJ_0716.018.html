	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Hungary's state mineral trading company,
Mineralimpex, and international energy trader Phibro Energy
AG have formed a joint venture international mineral trading
company, a Mineralimpex official said.
   The company, called Allcom Trading Co., began operations
July 1, trading "nonferrous ores, aluminum and oil products,"
the Hungarian official said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The official said Hungarian law prohibited the new company
from trading certain minerals, including iron ore and
domestically produced crude oil.</p>
<p>The Mineralimpex official didn't specify the breakdown of
shares in the partnership, but Hungarian joint ventures
usually have been split 50-50 between Hungarian and foreign
partners in the past.</p>

of the venture, and Phibro officials weren't available to
comment.</p>
