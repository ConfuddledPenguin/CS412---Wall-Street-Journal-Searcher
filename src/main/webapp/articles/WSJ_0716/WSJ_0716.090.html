	<p class="article-leader">Are workers who are hurt on the job being blacklisted?
   That's the central question in a dispute over an employer
practice that is growing fast nationwide: the use of accident
records to screen applicants for physically demanding jobs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Louisiana consumer group is raising a storm targeting
Employers' Information Service Inc. of Gretna, La., for
collecting and selling reports on workers' compensation
claims and injury-related lawsuits filed by thousands of
people in several Southern states.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a Fort Collins, Colo., company is amassing
injury records from around the country on a data base that it
says now contains files on 7.5 million Americans. Some 4,000
employers paid the company, Avert Inc., to run checks on
200,000 prospective workers last year, twice as many as the
year before.</p>
<p>Proponents of the practice -- popular in such heavy
industries as construction and oil -- say that injury records
can help employers judge if an applicant poses an
unreasonable liability. Given soaring costs for health-care
and workers' compensation insurance, companies say they can't
afford to hire workers who may be unfit or at high risk for
accidents. Another concern is fraud -- workers who jump from
job to job, collecting money for hard-to-confirm injuries
such as stress or back strain.</p>
<p>"If someone's always falling off scaffolding, there's
probably something wrong," says Michael J. Moore, a Duke
University economist who studies workers' compensation. Adds
Norman D. Bates, a Framingham, Mass., corporate liability
consultant: "You don't want to hire a walking disaster who's
going to end up costing your company lots of money in worker
comp claims."</p>
<p>Injury records represent one of several means -- including
skills exams, drug tests and credit checks -- that are
gaining in use as concern grows among companies about the
quality and character of workers.</p>
<p>But privacy experts and others charge that a lack of
safeguards leaves injury and workers' compensation records
open to abuse. They say employers, in their zeal to cut costs
and keep their workplaces "problem free," may be unfairly and
illegally discriminating against applicants who have made
legitimate claims. If compiling and consulting such records
increases, some worry, people may grow reluctant to report
accidents or pursue workers' compensation -- simply for fear
of reducing their appeal to future employers.</p>
<p>"If you build up these data bases, that works against the
whole concept of healthy people and healthy workplaces," says
Alan F. Westin, a Columbia University professor and former
government consultant who advocates privacy protections for
job applicants.</p>
<p>In Baton Rouge, David Czernik, director of the Louisiana
Consumers League, is seeking constraints on the use of injury
records through a campaign to shed light on Employers'
Information Service. In speeches to consumer groups,
testimony before a congressional panel and at rallies of
previously injured workers, Mr. Czernik has charged that the
organization's files constitute a blacklist. And, he
maintains, workers -- even healthy ones -- are unknowingly
being rejected from jobs because they are on file. "It's
frustrating and victimizing for the individual who wants to
get back into productive work," he says.</p>
<p>Employers' Information Service disputes Mr. Czernik's
claims, and he can't point to hard evidence. But he cites
local workers whose experiences have them worried, such as
22-year-old John B. Lavergne of Ville Platte, La. Mr.
Lavergne says he still suffers pain from a February incident
when he hurt his back while lifting 55-gallon drums on an
oil-drilling rig off the Louisiana coast.</p>
<p>Mayronne Enterprises Inc. of Harvey, La., which operated
the rig, paid Mr. Lavergne's medical bills and salary while
putting him on light duty for two months. But in April, he
says, he was suddenly let go. A supervisor told him the
company wouldn't pay workers' compensation for his
disability, he says, and told him "they were going to make my
life miserable if I saw a lawyer about it."</p>
<p>The supervisor "claimed they were going to put my name in
a computer and I would never get another job," says Mr.
Lavergne. He has since hired a lawyer to file a claim -- now
pending -- to recover the medical costs and lost wages
allowed under workers' compensation.</p>
<p>Mayronne, which is fighting the claim, denies that anyone
threatened Mr. Lavergne. But Mike Mayronne, president,
acknowledges that the company contributes data to and uses
Employers' Information Service. "We use that as a source to
try to weed out people who've been involved in lawsuits and
litigation in this industry and to help scrutinize people
that we hire," Mr. Mayronne says. "You want people who don't
have any complications."</p>
<p>Mr. Mayronne says Mr. Lavergne was hired despite a
previous back-injury claim with another company. "He's
compensated, and the next thing you know he's got another
back injury," Mr. Mayronne says. "We took a chance, and we
got burned on him." While not accusing Mr. Lavergne of fraud,
Mr. Mayronne says doctors weren't able to substantiate his
medical claims. "Nobody's got a problem with anybody who is
legitimately hurt," Mr. Mayronne says. But "a lot of people
are trying to take advantage."</p>
<p>Mr. Mayronne complains that multimillion-dollar disability
claims in the oil services business have helped push the
company's workers' compensation insurance premiums to nearly
$30 per $100 of payroll this year, from $24 in 1987. "It's
out of sight," he says.</p>
<p>Also contributing to a rise in workers' compensation rates
nationwide are soaring health-care costs. Medical expenses
now comprise 40% of the total workers' compensation bill, up
from 30% a decade ago. Compensation for lost income accounts
for most of the remainder. Private employers lost 76 workdays
per 100 workers because of occupational injuries in 1988, up
from 70 in 1987, according to the latest Bureau of Labor
Statistics data. The average claim, meanwhile, rose to an
estimated $9,225 last year from $8,811 in 1988, says the
National Council on Compensation Insurance, which helps set
premium rates in 32 states.</p>
<p>By comparison, checking past injury claims is relatively
cheap: as little as $4.50 for each person through Employers'
Information Service and $5 through Avert.</p>
<p>Both companies say their activities are legal, coming
under the same federal law that allows credit-reporting
agencies to gather and sell personal financial information.
That law demands that applicants be told when they're
rejected because of data in a consumer report, and both
companies inform injury-data users of that rule.</p>
<p>But at the same time, employers who consult injury records
must tread carefully to avoid breaking state laws that govern
how such reports may be used. In many states, including
Louisiana, employers can't legally reject an applicant merely
because of prior injury claims.</p>
<p>That's a restriction Mr. Czernik contends is "widely
ignored." But in their literature, both Employers'
Information Service and Avert warn employers not to reject
workers solely on the basis of their reports. They suggest
using the data to help verify information on applications,
plan pre-employment physical exams and place workers in the
right jobs.</p>
<p>"This is a red flag for further inquiries," says Rutledge
C. Clement Jr., an attorney for Employers' Information
Service to whom the company referred calls. But asked how
abuses are prevented, he says: "There are no guarantees."</p>
<p>Organized in the 1960s as a nonprofit organization,
Employers' Information Service collects information on
employees both from "member" companies and public records.
Mr. Clement declines to say how many workers are documented
in the organization's files, how many inquiries are made each
year or how many companies belong. He says only that
membership has dropped to "several hundred" from many times
that a decade ago, before economic woes in the Gulf Coast
region shut down many construction and oil companies.</p>
<p>Industrial Foundation of America Inc. of Odessa, Texas,
one of a handful of concerns similar to Employers'
Information Service, declined to discuss its operations.
Avert, which says it is the only national provider of injury
records, has doubled its business annually since starting in
1987. Revenue is expected to total $4 million over the next
year, says Michael D. DeWitt, Avert's marketing director.</p>
<p>Avert compiles its data base largely by buying computer
tapes and copying records from state agencies that administer
workers' compensation. Some 39 states make public certain
records of claims, lawsuits and other injury-related matters.</p>
<p>Hensel Phelps Construction Co., Greeley, Colo., started
checking applications against Avert's files two years ago as
part of a screening program that includes special physical
exams to test the strength of prospective workers. As a
result, incidents of back strain have dropped 27%. Still, the
fact of previous claims "wouldn't necessarily mean we'd
eliminate" applicants, says Michael J. Pennington, director
of safety and health.</p>
<p>Allowing that workers whose claims are on record could
fall prey to unscrupulous firms, Mr. DeWitt says Avert relies
on the discretion of its clients to follow the law when using
its files. "I'd hate to see someone not get a job simply
because he's filed a claim," he says.</p>
