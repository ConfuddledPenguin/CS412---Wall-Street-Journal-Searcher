	<p class="article-leader">Persian Gulf oil exporters will hold their output down now
in return for larger shares of OPEC production later.
   That is the chief trade-off in the move engineered by
Saudi Arabia last week to prop up the price of oil.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"When assessments of demand for OPEC's oil show the
momentum for a new production ceiling, possibly by the fourth
quarter, those with the capacity to produce should be given
more than their usual pro rata shares of the increase," said
a senior oil official in one Persian Gulf producing country.</p>
<p>This suggests that the emerging new emphasis on higher oil
prices rather than larger output shares by some leading
Middle East members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries could be short-lived. These countries,
including Saudi Arabia, OPEC's biggest producer, hold most of
the world's spare producing capacity as well as the bulk of
its oil reserves and have long maintained that they should
receive bigger shares of any increases in demand for OPEC
oil.</p>
<p>Still, the five oil ministers who met in Saudi Arabia last
week, from the kingdom as well as from Iraq, Qatar, Kuwait
and the United Arab Emirates, called for a freeze in the OPEC
production ceiling near its current level of 22.1 million
barrels a day and urged all 13 member nations to adhere to
their output quotas. There also were new pledges by OPEC's
chief quota violators, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates,
to support the production limits. And there were indications
from the Saudis that they might agree to a temporary drop in
their percentage share from the 24.5% of the production
ceiling so vigorously defended in the past.</p>
<p>These developments reversed the recent sharp drop in the
price of oil and set the stage for what is now expected to be
a relatively calm midyear conference for OPEC's 13 oil
ministers rather than the stormy, prolonged sessions
previously anticipated. The conference begins July 26 in
Geneva after a one-day meeting of the eight ministers on
OPEC's influential monitoring committee.</p>
<p>"Now, with a framework for at least a temporary agreement,
there is a feeling of cautious optimism rather than the worry
it was all going to spin out of control," said a senior OPEC
official.</p>
<p>The United Arab Emirates officially confirmed its
willingness Friday to return to the OPEC fold with a quota of
1.5 million barrels a day, 25% less than it is currently
producing. Mana Said Otaiba, the country's oil minister, said
the output cuts would begin immediately. He also endorsed a
call by the Iranian oil minister for a $2 increase to $20 a
barrel in the OPEC reference price.</p>
<p>OPEC long ago set $18 a barrel as its "minumum" reference
price for a basket of seven crudes. But the basket's average,
which usually lags by several dollars the price of the U.S.
benchmark crude, had recently fallen to the year's low of $14
a barrel.</p>
<p>The Emirate's acceptance of the quota it had previously
rejected was the crucial point in Saudi Arabia's plan to
restore the OPEC basket average to $18. The Saudis expected
to do that by curbing OPEC's runaway output, which has been
averaging more than one million barrels above the production
ceiling of 22.1 million barrels a day. Before the Emirates
announcement, Kuwait had reaffirmed its commitment to reduce
output from 1.7 million barrels a day to its OPEC quota of
1.5 million no matter what the Emirates did.</p>
<p>There was industry skepticism that neither Kuwait nor the
Emirates would drop production all the way to the lower
levels or hold it there for long. But OPEC sources noted that
the prestige of several heads of state, including King Fahd
of Saudi Arabia, is on the line. Some, such as President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq, have been vociferous in blaming
Kuwait and the Emirates for the one-third drop in oil prices.</p>
<p>Whatever the doubts, the Persian Gulf proposals resulted
in a rebound in oil prices. By Thursday afternoon, the latest
weekly average of the OPEC basket of seven crudes had climbed
back to $15 a barrel. Some oil officials, including the
Emirate's Mr. Otaiba, suggested that the average of the
basket will again reach the minimum reference price of $18 by
the time OPEC meets.</p>
<p>If not, the production ceiling still could be an issue at
next week's OPEC meetings. The Persian Gulf proposals would
suggest an increase of 400,000 barrels a day to 22.5 million
in the third-quarter ceiling to accommodate the Emirate's new
quota of 1.5 million if all other quotas remain the same. But
Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister, said in
Jakarta last week that he opposes any proposal to increase
the ceiling as long as the OPEC benchmark price remains under
$18.</p>
<p>Some Persian Gulf sources said, however, that it may not
be necessary to increase the ceiling much if at all. There
were suggestions that some of the exporters may allow
temporary cuts in their volumes to help make up the new
allotment for the Emirates.</p>
