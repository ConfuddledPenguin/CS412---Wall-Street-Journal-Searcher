	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey
authorized a $378 million people mover system at Newark
International Airport.
   The system, scheduled for completion by 1994, will
transport passengers between the airport's terminals and
parking lots and replace most of the current on-airport bus
routes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Von Roll Transport Systems Inc., Thun, Switzerland, will
design, construct, operate and maintain the system, which
will consist of automated vehicles on fixed, elevated
guideways. The company has built similar systems in Australia
and England.</p>
<p>The system is part of a major Port Authority redevelopment
program; officials project that Newark will be handling 40
million travelers a year by the late 1990s, double last
year's volume.</p>
<p>The Port Authority also approved a $40 million project to
convert Newark's North Terminal to a Continental Airlines air
cargo facility and build a 160,000-square-foot hangar
adjacent to it.</p>
<p>Continental, the principal unit of Continental Airlines
Holdings Inc., received a commitment from the New Jersey
Economic Development Authority to finance the project.</p>
