	<p class="article-leader">FAKE ART IN AMSTERDAM?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Dutch court has lifted a bank-account freeze it imposed
on Christie's Amsterdam after experts questioned the
authenticity of an auctioned painting, a Christie's spokesman
said.</p>
<p>A painting that Christie's listed as Odilon Redon's
"Fleurs des Champs" was sold at a May 22 auction in Amsterdam
for 1.1 million guilders (about $595,000), reportedly to a
Japanese gallery. But the buyer withheld payment after doubts
were raised as to the painting's authenticity, the Christie's
spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman added that four weeks after the sale the
Paris-based Wildenstein Foundation, which is preparing a
complete catalog of the artist's work, said it didn't believe
the work attributed to Redon by Christie's was genuine. In
response, the spokesman said, the Dutch seller of the
painting obtained a court order freezing the Christie's
account until the seller received the auction proceeds.</p>
<p>"But the condition of sale has a provision that Christie's
doesn't have to pay if a payment is not received from the
purchaser," the spokesman said; the court thus lifted the
bank-account freeze.</p>
<p>ARGENTINA'S PHONE SERVICE</p>
<p>The Spanish company that bought part of Argentina's
national telephone company will invest $1 billion over five
years to improve service, officials said. They stressed,
however, it may take two years to repair old lines or provide
new ones to all the Argentines who want them. "To demand
immediate improvements is practically impossible," said Jose
Luis Martinez de Bustamante, the president of Telsur, the new
company. Last month, the Spanish telecommunications monopoly
Telefonica led the consortium that bought the southern
section of Empresa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones.</p>
<p>JAPANESE STOCKS</p>
<p>The number of individual shareholders of Japanese stocks
increased for the fourth consecutive year in 1989, up 11.3%
to 24,090,000, according to an association of Japanese stock
exchanges. The share of Japanese stocks held by individuals
in 1989 increased 0.2 percentage point to 22.6%, the first
rise in 14 years. The share held by financial institutions,
excluding investment trusts, and by securities companies
decreased.</p>
<p>LABOR PACT IN EAST GERMANY</p>
<p>East German factories hit by strikes agreed to raise
wages, shorten work hours and protect the jobs of 350,000
workers for one year. The contract was negotiated by the West
German labor union IG Metall and its East German affiliate
and covers workers at 164 factories in the Berlin area.
Management said the pact might hasten the closing of some
struggling enterprises.</p>
<p>MAKING HONDA ACCORDS IN TAIWAN</p>
<p>Japan's Honda Motor Co. said it would start making Accord
cars in Taiwan in August. Honda officials said initial
production is set at about 1,000 units a month. Already, the
company has been producing Civic cars in Taiwan through a
local concern, San Yang Industry Co., which is 13.5% owned by
Honda's U.S. subsidiary. Officials said San Yang would also
handle production of the Accord cars. They said Honda decided
to add the Accord line in light of the recent rapid growth in
Taiwan's auto market.</p>
<p>ITALIAN ENERGY REPORT</p>
<p>Italy asked the European Community to launch a discussion
with the U.S. and Japan on energy, including the topic of
imposing taxes on energy consumption. In a report, the
Italian government said the rapid growth in global energy use
demands an international effort to cut consumption, save
energy and promote renewable sources of energy. The report
said the EC's energy goals until 1995, drafted in 1985, are
outdated because oil prices have dropped sharply since then
and the 1986 accident at Chernobyl has shattered confidence
in nuclear power.</p>
<p>REPORTING ON JAPAN'S ROYALTY</p>
<p>Japanese newspapers have called on the Imperial Household
Agency to respect press freedoms, a spokesman for the Japan
Newspaper and Publishers' Association said.</p>
<p>The highly secretive Imperial Household Agency, which
manages the affairs of Japan's imperial family, last month
tried to block publication of a candid wedding photograph of
Prince Akishino and Princess Kiko. Most newspapers used the
picture, which showed the bride affectionately smoothing the
prince's hair. The agency then banned the photographer, a
member of the Tokyo Press Photographers Association, from
imperial events.</p>
<p>Under agency guidelines, copyright to all pictures taken
inside the Imperial Palace, including those taken by the
foreign press, belongs to the Imperial Household Agency.</p>
<p>The publishers' association is requesting that copyright
control be given to association members -- some 170
newspapers and television stations.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Thailand's parliament approved in principle a bill under
which producers of fake goods bearing world-famous brand
names would face a maximum $16,000 fine or four years in
jail. . . . Nigerians who smoke in public places could be
jailed for up to two years under a decree published by the
military government. The law prohibits smoking in movie
theaters, elevators, schools, offices and on public
transportation.</p>
