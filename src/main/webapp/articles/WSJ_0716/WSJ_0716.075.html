	<p class="article-leader">MANILA -- The ailing Philippine economy is at a critical
juncture, with further deterioration possible. The government
has begun to address the problem with an ambitious package of
economic and fiscal reforms, but few analysts are betting on
a rapid recovery.
   Growth is slowing as once-robust consumer spending tapers
off. Budget and trade deficits are widening. Inflation and
interest rates remain stubbornly high. Power outages continue
to bedevil manufacturers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Foreign investors and tourists, scared away by the bloody
December 1989 coup attempt, have yet to return in large
numbers. The shellshocked stock market dives with every rumor
of a new coup.</p>
<p>There appears to be no end to the rumors. Worries persist
that dissident soldiers are regrouping for another armed
effort to topple the government of President Corazon Aquino.
The December insurrection was the sixth and bloodiest attempt
to overthrow Mrs. Aquino, who came to power in 1986 after
President Ferdinand Marcos was ousted by a military
rebellion.</p>
<p>Communist guerrillas, meanwhile, who oppose the renewal of
leases on U.S. military bases, continue to threaten violence
against U.S. military personnel and others alleged to be
involved in counterinsurgency activities. Negotiations with
Washington on a new bases agreement are scheduled to resume
in August.</p>
<p>At the same time, Mrs. Aquino's administration
increasingly is viewed as being at odds with itself as well
as with Congress. Early posturing for the 1992 presidential
election threatens to slow the already snail-paced
legislative process and derail administration programs aimed
at raising the living standards of the nation's 62 million
people, most of whom are poor.</p>
<p>Whether the teetering economy steadies or starts sliding
depends foremost on the avoidance of another coup attempt or
other serious political dislocations. Whether the economy
rebounds depends largely on the Aquino administration's
ability to deliver recently promised reforms aimed at cutting
the yawning budget deficit, streamlining trade and industry
policies, and bringing back foreign investors.</p>
<p>Economists and businessmen say Mrs. Aquino's time frame
for action is tightening. Election spending starting in 1991
could give the economy an illusory fillip and provide
politicians with an excuse to further postpone needed fiscal
reforms.</p>
<p>"The big question is whether the economy will be
outward-looking or inward-looking. The momentum is with the
outward-looking guys," says a foreign economist. "But things
have to get done before the actual start of campaigning in
late 1991," the economist warns.</p>
<p>Indeed, if Mrs. Aquino fails to act decisively and soon,
businessmen and economists say she will endanger not only her
reform package, but also her residual good will among the
business community that backed her against Mr. Marcos. "She
has maybe six months, or she will lose her remaining support
among businessmen," says a prominent manufacturer.</p>
<p>Late last month, Finance Secretary Jesus Estanislao
announced -- and the cabinet approved -- broad reforms that
he said address "all the major problems of the economy." The
package aims to lower interest rates, curtail protectionism,
increase exports and raise government revenue through tax and
tariff reform.</p>
<p>Despite the cabinet's endorsement of the package, major
turf battles are expected to be fought between technocrats in
the Finance Department and protectionists in the Department
of Trade and Industry. Influential industrialists already are
beginning to lobby against certain reforms. The industrial
sector is based on import-substitution manufacturing that,
despite some previous liberalization moves, remains largely
protected from overseas competition.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Harvard-trained Mr. Estanislao predicted tough
times ahead for many protected industries as tariff rates
drop. He also said that the package likely would lead to
higher inflation in the short term-averaging 13.5% on an
annualized basis for the next six months, compared with the
government target of 12%.</p>
<p>"When you go through a period of reform, there will be
some bitter pills to swallow," Mr. Estanislao said. "But we
are doing our best to put in some sweetness." The long-term
effect, he said, will be a trade and investment regime that
favors the consumer.</p>
<p>Mr. Estanislao, who was named finance secretary in a
cabinet shuffle after December's coup attempt, is winning
high marks from many businessmen and economists for his tough
stand on deregulation and reform. His intentions also are
welcome news to the International Monetary Fund, foreign
banks and other lending institutions that are members of the
Philippine debt-rescheduling agreement reached last year. The
country's total foreign debt is currently about $28 billion.</p>
<p>A review team from the IMF has been in Manila for the past
week, measuring the country's economic performance and
policies against goals set in the 1989 debt-rescheduling
agreement. The issuance of IMF credits to the Philippines
depends on the country meeting the performance goals at
regular intervals.</p>
<p>Although the December coup attempt has played havoc with
certain of the country's indicators, especially the money
supply, private economists and diplomats say the IMF's main
concern is the widening budget deficit, which is blamed for
fueling high interest rates and inflation.</p>
<p>At the current rate of spending, and without additional
revenue, the budget deficit for 1990 could hit 65 billion
pesos ($2.86 billion), more than double the 33 billion-peso
target in the agreement with the IMF. Most of the funds
needed to cover the budget gap to date are being raised
locally through Treasury bills, which are currently carrying
interest rates of about 24%.</p>
<p>"The underlying problem is the size of the fiscal deficit
they are trying to fund," says a Philippine economist.
Political risk, of course, compounds the interest-rate
equation.</p>
<p>Bank-lending rates are now ranging from 25% to 27%,
presenting a major impediment to business expansion and new
investment. "With 25% rates, who can afford to borrow and
buy, and who can afford to build?" asks Rafael Buenaventura,
president and chief executive officer of Philippine
Commercial International Bank.</p>
<p>Because almost 40% of the budget goes to foreign-debt
payments, there is little room for budget cutting. But
economists and businessmen say the government could make more
efficient use of the money it spends.</p>
<p>It is revenue-raising measures that Mr. Estanislao is
targeting, though it will be difficult for him to find enough
new money to sharply narrow the budget gap this year.
Congress has already approved an increase in the so-called
sin taxes on alcoholic beverages and cigarettes that is
expected to bring in an additional 4.8 billion pesos a year.</p>
<p>A streamlining of the tariff system and a general lowering
of rates is expected to raise revenue collected on imports,
half of which are now estimated to slip through without
payment of tariffs or other charges. The government also is
expected to announce soon an expansion of its program for
pre-shipment inspection of imports that is now conducted by
the Swiss firm Societe Generale de Surveillance S.A., known
as SGS.</p>
<p>The Finance Department and the Central Bank of the
Philippines also plan to reduce bank costs as a way of
lowering interest rates. Bankers expect that a tax on a
bank's gross receipts and a withholding tax on interest
income will be abolished or reduced. They also expect reserve
requirements to be lowered.</p>
<p>Mr. Estanislao would like to abolish a costly
gasoline-price subsidy, but this is a politically sensitive
issue and appears unlikely this year. The December coup
attempt followed a round of fuel-price increases.</p>
<p>Whatever the final makeup of Mr. Estanislao's reform
package, economists and businessmen expect that this year and
next will be difficult ones for the economy. The outlook
beyond 1992 may well depend on who follows Mrs. Aquino as
president -- and the chances of Mrs. Aquino running again
can't entirely be discounted.</p>
