	<p class="article-leader">NEW LONDON, Conn. -- NESB Corp.'s New England Savings Bank
unit plans to eliminate 56, or 13%, of its jobs, close two
offices and sell a third in a major cost-cutting move.
   The bank didn't specify the charge it will take for the
job cuts, to be made through dismissals and attrition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But it "is not going to be that large. What we will save
over the balance of the year will more than offset the
severance costs," Seymour Smith, chief financial officer at
NESB, said. The bank expects to save $1.4 million a year with
the job cuts, plus $900,000 from other operating-cost cuts.</p>
<p>NESB plans to close offices in Branford and Clinton Plaza
and will sell the Milford office. The job reductions, coupled
with those taken earlier this year, will leave the bank with
358 employees, down 21% from 455 a year ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Smith declined to estimate second-quarter results,
saying the bank holding company, which has $1.3 billion in
assets, will report them within about two weeks. In the
year-earlier second quarter, NESB had a net loss of $6.8
million, after a $16 million provision for possible loan
losses.</p>
