	<p class="article-leader">I have been asked to speak about what Republicans are, and
what we must be in the future -- not only in order to win,
but to lead wisely and justly. I can remember what we were,
once, back in the mists of the past.
   I was born in the Democratic precincts of Brooklyn, New
York in 1950, and I grew up with people, the children and
grandchildren of the immigrants of Europe, who thought -- as
I was taught to think -- that the Republican Party, forgive
me, was the party of rich dullards. In our neighborhood,
Democrats were cops and firemen. Republicans had profoundly
uninteresting jobs, like . . . insurance company vice
president. They always seemed like that great cliche --
country club guys, fat, a little self-satisfied, kind of
snoozy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Democratic leadership in those days had something to
say. Let's get this country moving again, let's help people.
In the early '60s they lowered the top tax rates, cut capital
gains, reminded us that a rising tide lifts all boats. They
saw communism not only in military and political terms but in
moral terms -- and they led an America able to articulate its
opposition, its superiority, its faith. Liberals had heart;
conservatives had adding machines. Liberals wanted to help
people; conservatives kept the books, and fretted about the
red ink.</p>
<p>It all started changing in the late '60s, you know how and
the reasons why. By the '70s, the Democrats, still the
majority party, seemed like a giant bound, unable to free
itself from the assumptions of the recent past. A party
whipped by special interests -- tied down by what had become
almost an addiction to high taxes and high spending, in the
thrall of what George Bush called the "idea boutique" at
Harvard Yard -- a party farther than ever from the common
man's common-sense understanding of the world.</p>
<p>Across the nation you could see the stirrings of
discontent. In California, a tax revolt; in middle America,
the anti-abortion movement, composed largely of traditional
Democrats who could no longer tolerate the position of the
party of their parents; in the East, a newly sophisticated
anticommunism that was grounded in both passion and
scholarship. Throughout the land, a simmering sense of enough
is enough.</p>
<p>The Republican Party awoke from its post-Watergate
slumber. Suddenly it was saying wait a minute -- you can't
tax the little guy to death -- you can't tax him 40%, 50% on
his overtime -- you can't take his freedom from him and let
government call all the tunes -- you can't let the economy
stop pumping out the jobs the people need. We backed low
taxes, low spending, enduring values, a strong defense.</p>
<p>And along came Reagan. And because of the ideas he
represented we owned the '80s. Suddenly, almost without
noticing it, the Republican party became the party of the
people. Protector of the people, protector of their
interests. And one day we looked around and realized: My God,
we're not only on the side of the guy at the country club
anymore -- we're on the side of the waiters]</p>
<p>The differences between the two parties were not always,
in a cultural sense at least, clean-cut or unambiguous. But
the point is, we had the issues -- we were on the right side
of the issues -- and the key now, for the future, it seems to
me, is simple: Don't give those issues up.</p>
<p>The message of the '80s, the era of the great Republican
resurgence, is: We are at our best when we believe. We are at
our best when we are in tune with the country, and respectful
of it, when we try not to be more like the Democrats, but
more like us. As we owned the '80s, we can own the '90s. And
we can, before this decade is out, take Congress.</p>
<p>The economy of course is still the issue. We've all been
very happy the past 10 years to have two presidents with high
popularity ratings. They deserved and deserve them. But I
operate with the theory that when there is peace and
prosperity the American people find reasons to like their
president, reasons to see their charm and low-key humor. And
when we don't have prosperity, they find reasons to decide
their president is an unattractive, charmless dolt. (They did
it to Carter.) Not because they're cynical, but because they
hire presidents to run things, and they want results.</p>
<p>We Republicans still have the advantage on the economy,
because to the men and women of America we're still seen as
the grownups on this issue. But we must be true to what we
are. We must continue as the party of low taxes, the party of
lower spending.</p>
<p>We must not lose the tax issue. We must not lose it for
reasons having to do with responsible governance: If we go
down the road we went down in the '70s, our least effective
decade -- if we become "low budget liberals" and let the
budget grow -- if we go down that road it will hurt the
economy and we will stop being the job-producing wonder of
the world. We'll stop being the party of hope, the party of
the people. And we cannot lose this issue for political
reasons: If we become like the Democrats, we will suffer
their fate.</p>
<p>President Bush has been statesmanlike in telling Congress
he'll do a great deal, go to great lengths, to end the budget
mess. Reagan was criticized in the media, and by some
thoughtful voters, for seeming sometimes intransigent,
confrontational, unwilling to talk. Bush has avoided that
charge.</p>
<p>It's right and legitimate that he should tell the
Democrats, "I'll consider anything to make serious progress."
It's good to be reasonable, in a crisis, to declare your
openness to all ideas. But if the ideas offered are,
ultimately, the same old bad ideas -- "We'll spend, and you
raise the taxes to support us" -- then it will be right and
reasonable for the president to push away from the table and
"cut himself a walking stick." That was Tolstoy's phrase
when, at the age of more than 80, he walked out on an unhappy
marriage after almost 50 years. He was endlessly patient --
just like a Republican.</p>
<p>If, in the next few weeks or month the president sees that
no serious structural reform is possible -- that no serious
attempt will be made to control waste, to gain control of
domestic spending; if he comes to suspect that even if he
raises taxes the Democrats won't control spending, and once
again the Republican Party will have the job of "tax
collector for the welfare state" (and every time we go down
this wrong road the Democrats win, because they always seem
to be spending money to help the poor while we'll seem to be
taxing middle-America to bail out bankers and pay lawyers);
if no serious progress occurs it will be right and legitimate
-- and statesmanlike -- for the president to push away from
the bargaining table, stand up, acknowledge what's happening,
declare that an impasse has been reached, and tell the
Democrats: I'm taking it to the people.</p>
<p>The 1990 elections are three months away, and there is
still no more fruitful and legitimate issue for us, and for
the country, than wasteful spending, than a budget out of
control, than congressmen raising taxes -- there is no more
potent issue than this.</p>
<p>There isn't a man or woman in America who doesn't know
that the budget's out of control -- every American over the
age of 12 knows it -- and the funny thing is they're not
tight, they're not skinflints, they just want to know the
money's going to good use.</p>
<p>People are becoming newly re-sensitized to taxes, from New
Jersey to California, they're starting to get clobbered
again. And there's another part of the mix: an anti-incumbent
spirit that is sweeping the country. Everywhere, at the
dinner table, the PTA meeting, the cocktail party, you can
hear it: Throw the bums out. As the majority of Congress are
Democrats this is not exactly bad news. If we take this issue
to the people, the people will support us. I always want to
say to my old friends in Washington: Trust the people. After
all, they had the wit to trust us.</p>
<p>Someone told me the other day, "But George Bush doesn't
like confrontation." Well, George Bush likes peace and
progress -- but I saw him in 1988 when he was 14 points down,
and when it's time to fight, he can mix it up with the best
of them. The part of him that was an 18-year-old fighter
pilot revs up, and with an absolute lack of ferocity, with a
kind of gentlemanly conviction, he hits every target.</p>
<p>So my hope is that this party will take the tax and
spending issue to the people -- because the people are on our
side. And sometimes you only make progress in a negotiation
when you end it. You remember when Ronald Reagan let the
Soviets, in one of their big flamboyant rejections of the
U.S. position, walk away from the arms talks. It was a big
break, big news, headlines that said "Arms Talks Collapse."
Reagan was criticized, as usual. But he said, in his sunny
way, "Don't worry, they'll come back." And they did.</p>
<p>A second issue on which the people trust us -- an issue
which ought by rights to be ours -- is crime. You all know
the facts, the statistics, how crime most grieviously hurts
the poor and middle class. I would add only that this is an
issue that resonates powerfully with my generation, the baby
boomers. We grew up during the great explosion of crime in
America -- grew up hearing our parents say, wistfully, "We
didn't even have to lock our doors at night." We're nostalgic
for what we never knew.</p>
<p>Books like "In Cold Blood," movies like "The Boston
Strangler" infused our art and imaginations when we were
young -- and we have children now, and are afraid. We
Republicans must be the leading anti-crime party. There are
those who worry about the departure of communism as a cutting
issue. But, for those who want to help the oppressed and the
helpless, in domestic terms, crime is the communism of the
'90s.</p>
<p>Another issue: I will tell you frankly that I believe
corruption -- the political corruption of our great cities,
the abuses of the machines, a story so constant and pervasive
that it's always in the papers in New York, but on page 12
because it's not news anymore -- this is another great issue
for us. We are ripe for a Teddy Roosevelt or two -- we are
ripe to seize this issue, because it speaks of the crumbling
of the cities, the anxiety of the suburbs and the abuse of
the poor. The machines are Democratic -- the corruption is
Democratic -- and a poor woman who spends two hours waiting
for a city-run ambulance when her husband has a heart attack
is a victim who deserves our attention. She and others like
her will, in time, join us if we begin to speak forcefully
for their interests.</p>
<p>Another issue, a delicate one, abortion. Lee Atwater is
right -- we are the party of the big tent -- and we old
roustabouts stick together as much as we can. If we are to be
a modern, viable party then we know that debate and
dissension must be a part of us. We care about ideas and can
argue for justice. We have room for disagreement, we don't
shun people for being politically incorrect.</p>
<p>But I will tell you that I feel strongly that we must
continue to be the party that speaks against abortion, that
speaks to the conscience of the nation.</p>
<p>I think that no one, pro- or anti-, is entirely 100%
comfortable with his or her position on this issue. We all in
our hearts have our doubts, and our questions. We all in our
hearts, in our best selves, in our private lives, lean
against abortion.</p>
<p>Both George Bush and Ronald Reagan have said, eloquently,
that abortion on demand coarsens us as a people. You are
familiar with their arguments. But I have a hunch. The
technology of abortion is changing, and more and more it will
come down to one woman, or one couple, standing alone and
deciding. And if we are the party that tells her, or them,
no, rethink it, think twice and three times -- they will not
resent it.</p>
<p>I think the national defense is still a potent issue,
because the American people have common sense. They know
perfect peace and lasting tranquility have never happened in
the history of man and likely never will. A strong America
defense is still the greatest peace-preserving force in the
history of man. Fifty years without a world war -- it was
American strength, and the taxes sacrificed by the American
people to maintain it -- that did that. And when something
works, don't be in such a hurry to make radical change.</p>
<p>Another issue looms on the horizon, coming ever closer. We
must make a connection with America's new immigrants. So many
of them hold the enduring values for which we stand, and yet
those values do not necessarily translate into Republican
allegiance by any means. I do not know what is the modern
equivalent of the local political club -- my people became
Democrats originally because the local Democratic boss made
sure you had a turkey at Christmas -- I don't know what is
the modern equivalent of that presence, but it would be in
our interests to figure it out.</p>
<p>And a word, in closing, on what I think is, right now, a
great challenge to us as a party. It's subtle, in a way. It's
that, after 10 years in power, the people will come to see us
as the Washington Party, when it is we who have opposed the
mischief and machinations and self-interest of that town.</p>
<p>We are not the party that splits the difference with the
Democrats in big rooms on the Hill, we're not the "insider
party," we are not the party of the bureaucracy, of the
federal government, of centralized power of Washington. We
are the opposition in power. We forget this at our peril.</p>
<p>And so what we are talking about this fall, in 1990, in
every congressional race and state Senate contest, is the
continuance of our right and ability to govern this nation --
this great and moving nation, this most generous country on
earth, this most yearning place -- a party, still, worthy of
the people, protector of their interests -- a party that
keeps the faith, that remembers we are at our best when we
believe.</p>
<p>If we only remember what we believe we will own the '90s
-- and we will be right, and we will win.</p>
