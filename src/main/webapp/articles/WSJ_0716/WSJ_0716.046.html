	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A federal court ordered the Teamsters union
to provide full details of a proposed labor contract with
United Parcel Service of America Inc. to all union members
eligible to vote on the pact.
   The order by U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris granted a
petition filed by five members of Teamsters for a Democratic
Union, a dissident Teamsters group. The dissidents want to
see all contract documents, including all 30 supplements that
apply to particular segments of the work force, before taking
a stand on whether to ratify the pact. The Teamsters
international has provided each member with just the basic
contract and the supplement that covers that member.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The court order was issued as UPS and its customers began
bracing for a possible strike when the current contract
expires at the end of this month. The union and local leaders
have recommended that the 140,000 members who work for UPS
reject the company's offer. The union could call the walkout
if more than 50% of those voting opt to reject it.</p>
<p>Sheila Pekar, president of Internal Audit Bureau Inc., a
consulting firm based in Hamlin, Pa., sent a letter to its
clients urging them to "consult with retail accounts
concerning the possible need to change" from UPS to other
carriers.</p>
<p>Ms. Pekar's clients, who include apparel makers now
entering a peak shipping period, use UPS to ship consumer
goods. She noted that UPS spokesmen are optimistic about a
settlement, but don't rule out the "possibility" of a strike.</p>
<p>Alan Caminiti, a UPS spokesman, said that Teamsters
members who work for UPS are paid at least 78 cents an hour
more than other Teamsters and have been offered "a very good
package." He added, "Our people understand the competitive
pressure we're under."</p>
<p>Judge Harris said his injunction is part of "a saga of
litigation" between the dissident group and the union. The
dissidents won similar court orders against the
international's leaders during contract-ratification
balloting in 1987 and 1988. They say they want to see all the
UPS supplements partly to judge whether certain types of
workers are being shortchanged.</p>
<p>Teamsters officials weren't available for comment. Judge
Harris noted that the union contends that the dissidents
don't need all the information they seek and that they
already have decided how to vote anyway. But, he said, it's
not up to the international to determine how much of the
information is enough and when members should stop thinking
about how to vote. The only possible harm to the union
leaders would be "the loss of another political battle with
the TDU," Judge Harris said.</p>
<p>The latest UPS "final" offer, somewhat sweetened from an
offer made late last month, includes a wage increase of 50
cents an hour, or about 3%, each year for three years, and a
cost-of-living increase, capped at 20 cents an hour, in the
second and third years of the contract. It also includes new,
lower-wage tiers for newer employees. And, it calls for an
increase of 35 cents an hour in the employer contribution to
the union health and welfare fund and to its pension fund.</p>
