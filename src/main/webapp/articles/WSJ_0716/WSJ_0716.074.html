	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said he
wouldn't appoint an independent counsel to investigate Neil
Bush, the son of the president, in the $1 billion failure of
a Denver thrift, unless Mr. Bush is accused of a crime.
   Led by Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D. Colo.), 12 Democrats on
the House Judiciary Committee requested Friday that Mr.
Thornburgh appoint an impartial investigator to look into
Silverado Banking, Savings & Loan Association. Rep. Edward
Feighan of Ohio later withdrew his support, calling it an
"error," leaving the Democrats short of the support needed to
request an independent prosecutor. Such a request requires a
majority of the Democrats on the committee.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Neil Bush is already facing an administrative hearing in
September for his role as a director of Silverado. While a
director, he failed to disclose his business associations
with two major Silverado borrowers who later defaulted on
loans. One of those men, Denver developer Kenneth Good, also
loaned Neil Bush $100,000, which he never was asked to repay.</p>
<p>Mr. Thornburgh said that even if Democrats secure the
necessary support, it's unlikely he would name an independent
counsel because the Justice Department doesn't investigate
civil matters. "I am not aware of any evidence or any
allegation from a credible source that Neil Bush has
participated in any criminal activity," he said on ABC News's
"This Week" yesterday.</p>
<p>But Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have alleged the
potential for criminal conduct at Silverado. Moreover, they
said at least the appearance of a political conflict of
interest exists. One Silverado borrower and bondholder, Larry
Mizel, raised $1 million for Republican candidates in 1984.</p>
<p>"The case has criminal implications that should be
aggressively investigated, but the potential for political,
financial, and personal conflicts of interest . . . raise
serious questions about the Department's ability to conduct a
fair and vigorous investigation," said a letter to Mr.
Thornburgh from the committee Democrats.</p>
<p>S&L losses have been piling up for a decade, but heading
into this fall's congressional elections, both parties are
trying to capitalize on the scandal. Democrats have zeroed in
on Neil Bush's woes with federal regulators, while
Republicans have pointed to large campaign contributions to
Democrats from Charles Keating, who sought to have senators
intervene on behalf of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association.
The president is feeling the heat, particularly from his own
party, resulting from his backtracking on his no-new-taxes
pledge, a reversal necessitated partly by the S&L losses.</p>
<p>Edward Rollins, co-chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said that Neil Bush earlier should
have agreed to sign a consent order with federal regulators,
ending the matter. "I think obviously he should have done it,
but Neil Bush think's he's innocent," he said on NBC News's
"Meet the Press" yesterday.</p>
<p>Under the administrative hearing proceedings for Neil
Bush, he faces punishment no worse than an admonishment not
to engage in similar actions again. Earlier this year, five
other Silverado directors signed consent agreements under
which they agreed not to work in the banking or S&L
industries again. Federal regulators also are considering a
$200 million civil suit against Silverado directors,
including Mr. Bush.</p>
