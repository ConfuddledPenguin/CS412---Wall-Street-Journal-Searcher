	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. said it canceled
plans to drill a 60 million Canadian dollar (US$51.9 million)
exploratory oil well in the western Arctic Ocean because of a
lack of industry support for the project.
   The decision means that no new wells will be drilled this
year in Canada's Beaufort Sea region, which leads into the
Arctic Ocean. Gulf Canada, an energy concern, is a unit of
Toronto-based Olympia & York Developments Ltd., which is
controlled by the Reichmann family. It had proposed to drill
as many as four wells in the region over the next three
years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Frank Mitton, manager of Gulf Canada's northern
operations, said the company will decide in the next few
months whether to carry out its plans to drill the remaining
wells. Mr. Mitton said Gulf's decision to cancel the well was
unrelated to an earlier ruling by a Canadian environmental
panel. The panel had recommended that the Canadian government
reject Gulf's plans because the company was unprepared to
deal with a major oil spill. "We cannot drill the well
because we don't have sufficient industry support for it,"
Mr. Mitton said.</p>
<p>The well was to have been located about 18 miles east of
Gulf Canada's big Amauligak oil field. Several oil and gas
finds have been made in the Beaufort Sea but none of the
discoveries has been brought into production.</p>
<p>Gulf is the second company that has canceled an Arctic
exploration program this year. Amoco Canada Petroleum Co., a
unit of Chicago-based Amoco Corp., recently canceled plans to
drill two wells in the Beaufort Sea, because of insufficient
interest from its partners. Amoco plans to carry out some
seismic work this summer.</p>
<p>Ed Zederayko, an oil industry analyst, said low energy
prices and reduced federal government exploration incentives
are causing more companies to defer their offshore drilling
plans.</p>
<p>But a spokesman for Chevron Canada Resources Ltd., which
was to have held about 22% interest in Gulf's proposed well,
said Chevron was committed to going ahead with the plan.
Chevron Canada, a unit of San Francisco-based Chevron Corp.,
"has an ongoing interest in the North," he said.</p>
<p>The Canadian Environmental Impact Review Board had
recommended earlier this month that government regulators
reject Gulf Canada's Arctic drilling plan because of the
potentially devastating effects of an oil spill on the area's
environmentally sensitive coastline. The board, which is made
up of representatives from the federal government, the
governments of the Yukon and Northwest Territories and the
Western Arctic Inuit natives, criticized Gulf Canada and the
government for their "startling lack of preparedness" for
dealing with a major oil well blowout.</p>
<p>Canada Oil and Gas Lands Administration, the government
regulators, had yet to issue its decision on whether it would
accept the environmental board's ruling.</p>
<p>Gulf Canada officials estimated that a hypothetical
worst-case well blowout could release 40,000 barrels of oil a
day for 66 days, or 10 times more oil than was released when
Exxon Corp.'s Valdez tanker ran aground in Alaska last year.
They said the cleanup of such a spill could be beyond Gulf
Canada's financial capabilities.</p>
