	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Two of the siblings who had fought for control of
the famed Gallimard publishing house have agreed to sell
their shares to a bank, setting the stage for the family to
lose majority control, an investment firm said Friday.
   Terms weren't disclosed. If the sale is completed, it
would place 54.3% of the shares in France's largest
independent publishing house in outside hands, marking the
end of 79 years of family control.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Francoise Gallimard and her brother, Christian, have
agreed to join their younger sister, Isabelle, in selling
their shares to the state-owned Banque Nationale de Paris,
according the international investment bank Henry Ansbacher.</p>
<p>Ansbacher was retained by Francoise in January to
determine the value of the publishing house.</p>
<p>Francoise, 49, and Christian, 46, had been trying to wrest
control of the company away from another brother, Antoine,
42, the firm's president and its largest single shareholder.</p>
<p>According to Ansbacher, Francoise and Christian decided to
follow their younger sister's example by selling their
shares, giving Banque Nationale de Paris a total of 36.8% of
the Gallimard shares. Other outside shareholders control
17.5%.</p>
