	<p class="article-leader">WARSAW -- Poland's Solidarity-led government took its
radical economic overhaul plan a step further, as the Sejm,
or lower house of parliament, passed two separate bills to
privatize the more than 80% of industry owned by the state
and to create an agency to oversee the changes.
   The legislation requires Senate approval, but the measure
isn't expected to face opposition.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bills allow for the sale of shares of state
enterprises under an Agency for Ownership Transformations,
which will evaluate companies and put those in the best shape
on the auction block first.</p>
<p>Reacting to public concerns that foreign investors or the
former Communist elite "nomenklatura" would be the only ones
with the needed capital to buy state property, the government
promised that "privatization coupons" would be issued to all
citizens for buying part of the state-owned property.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz also promised that
citizens will be allowed to buy shares on an installment
basis and, in some cases, on favorable credit terms.</p>
<p>Employees will be allowed to purchase as much as 20% of
their companies' shares on preferential terms. Foreign
investment will be at the discretion of the ownership
agency's head.</p>
