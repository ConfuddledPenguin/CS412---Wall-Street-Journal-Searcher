	<p class="article-leader">TONOPAH, Nev. -- After slipping in through a side door,
E.J. "Joe" Shoen, head of the U-Haul rental empire, greeted
his stockholders with a scowl. It was a fitting welcome to a
meeting that had the air of a backwater cockfight.
   As a pistol-packing guard hovered over the sparse crowd
inside a dreary rented hall here, Joe Shoen's aging father
jumped up and began berating him from the floor. Joe quickly
tried to cut him off.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Wait a minute," a red-faced L.S. Shoen sputtered. "Mr.
Chairman, I am your father, I established this company, I
have some points to make. I have never in the history of your
life, in my relationship with you, ever prohibited you or
stopped you from speaking your mind within a reasonable
limit. The fact is I have never stopped you."</p>
<p>But Leonard Samuel Shoen wishes he could.</p>
<p>In 1986, Joe Shoen, a burly lawyer with a Harvard MBA,
ousted his father as chairman of Amerco, U-Haul's parent
company, on the ground that the elder Mr. Shoen's mercurial
style was ruining the Phoenix, Ariz., company. Ever since,
the family patriarch has been fighting to reclaim his empire.
In the course of the longrunning battle, the company that
once dominated the lucrative business of renting out trailers
and trucks has lost market share to aggressive competitors
such as Ryder System Inc. and has wasted assets on
misbegotten diversification moves.</p>
<p>The vicious feud among the Shoens vividly illustrates the
conflicts that can mangle family-run companies when
generations collide. Rife with greed, it has divided L.S.
Shoen's seven sons and five daughters into warring camps and
mired Amerco in lawsuits, plots and purges.</p>
<p>The bitterness runs so deep that a March 1989
shareholders' meeting erupted in a family brawl. The
patriarch's lifetime employment contract, which amounted to a
pension, was terminated by son Joe, who, in turn, accuses his
father of sicking the Internal Revenue Service on him. And
Dr. Sam Shoen, who supports his father, contends that someone
in Joe's group told Arizona medical licensing authorities
that he was a drunken psychopath.</p>
<p>This war of attrition has hurt the company and the family
in countless ways, not the least of which is money. Amerco
has paid $5 million in legal fees so far, and Joe Shoen
complained, during one court hearing, that his attorney bills
exceeded his gross income. "It's as if I had a foot that had
gangrene," he said.</p>
<p>Behind such hostilities lies the almost Shakespearean
tragedy of L.S. Shoen, a man too busy building his empire to
unravel the malignant rivalries festering among the sons and
daughters who would one day inherit it. That failure now
haunts him in the form of two rebellious sons, Joe and Mark.
"Their desire for absolute power is insatiable," Jerry Day, a
Tucson psychologist who has worked with the family, once
wrote of the two brothers. "The more they have, the more they
want."</p>
<p>The empire in the middle of this firestorm is not the
profit machine it was in the 1960s, when U-Haul was a
burgeoning company with no real competition. In recent years,
management missteps and potent competitors have put its
earnings on a roller coaster. They hit $41.6 million in the
fiscal year ended March 31, 1984, then plunged to a meager
$2.2 million three years later, before bouncing back to $36.2
million in fiscal 1989. Through the fiscal first nine months
ended last Dec. 31, the latest figure available, net income
fell again. It dropped 39% from a year earlier to $28.3
million, even though revenue rose 1% to $737.6 million.
Amerco blamed rising vehicle-replacement costs.</p>
<p>But with a fleet of 150,000 trucks and trailers and a
real-estate portfolio worth an estimated $1 billion or more,
Amerco remains an alluring prize. Now, its frustrated,
74-year-old founder's only goal is to regain control long
enough to sell it to an outsider and end the fighting. But in
earlier years, he had a grand vision of U-Haul as the jewel
of a business empire that would endure in his family for
generations.</p>
<p>The son of an Oregon farmer ruined by the Depression, L.S.
Shoen picked fruit, butchered cattle and barbered his way
through three years of medical school before being expelled
for answering for a friend in class. Driven by deep-seated
fear of going broke, the young man friends called "Slick"
boasted that he could pivot on a dime when he got an idea.</p>
<p>And he got a good one as a young World War II naval
officer trying to find a cheap way to haul his family's
belongings from base to base. He built his first trailers on
his father-in-law's farm in Ridgefield, Wash. He started
U-Haul in 1945, with little capital and a cadre of former
blue-collar workers that he transformed into executives with
a home-grown management philosophy that fused the teachings
of Napoleon and St. Francis of Assisi with corny credos such
as ExKH=R (energy times know-how equals results). At staff
meetings, L.S. might distribute Abraham Lincoln's letters or
deliver lengthy lectures on the "Seven Environments of
Organizations."</p>
<p>Obsessed with building his new company, L.S. Shoen left
his wife and children for weeks at a time while he hit the
road with a toolbox under his car seat. Working 16-hour days,
he recruited new dealers during the day, repaired trailers by
streetlight deep into the night and slept in his car. To
establish bases in cities he couldn't visit, he rented
trailers to anyone who promised to drop them off at a service
station that looked like a potential U-Haul dealer. By the
mid-1950s, his dealer network stretched from Portland and Los
Angeles to Miami and New York and accounted for 250,000
rentals a year.</p>
<p>In his vision of the future, this empire was to be handed
over to his 12 children, especially the boys. As teen-agers,
some of his sons spent so much time painting U-Haul trailers
that they joked about having orange blood. Their father
increased their responsibilities as they grew older, even
buying a Phoenix amusement park as a family management
project.</p>
<p>Much to his later regret, Mr. Shoen also gave his children
Amerco stock, so much of it that they eventually owned 95% of
the company and he a mere 2%. While the gifts gave him tax
benefits, they gave his children control over U-Haul's
future.</p>
<p>The Problems Begin</p>
<p>Almost from the start, his dynastic dreams became tangled
in a gnarl of personal problems. His wife of 13 years died of
heart failure in 1957, leaving him with six young children; a
year later, the 41-year-old widower married Suzanne Gilbert,
the 23-year-old daughter of a neighbor.</p>
<p>That spawned years of trouble.</p>
<p>The older sons, Sam and Mike, were packed off to boarding
school, but Joe and Mark, the next in line, stayed home. They
became allies in a grinding war of wills with their
stepmother. "Mark and Joe hated her guts in ways that were
unreal," recalls Mr. Shoen, who says they bombarded him with
tales of his wife's supposed misdeeds every time he came home
from a business trip.</p>
<p>By the time the Shoens and U-Haul moved to Phoenix from
Portland in 1967, the friction had escalated so much that
police were called to the family mansion one night following
an argument between Mark and his stepmother. "He punched her
out, and I mean hard," says the patriarch. In 1977, after 19
years of marriage and five children, she got a divorce. (His
third wife bore his 12th child.)</p>
<p>But the power struggle to come would not be between the
groups of Shoen children from different mothers. Instead, the
primary combatants would be the patriarch's four eldest sons
by his first wife.</p>
<p>In the mid-1970s, they began vaulting into the upper ranks
of U-Haul management. Third son Joe, the president of U-Haul
International, harbored ambitions of succeeding his father,
but company executives knew that L.S. Shoen's choice was
eldest son Sam, the head of East Coast field operations, who,
at his father's request, had abandoned a promising medical
career to join the company.</p>
<p>In addition to wrestling with their own rivalries, the
brothers had to work side-by-side with their father, a
veritable whirlwind of contradiction and eccentricity. He
lived in a mansion designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, yet
insisted on cheap motels and McDonald's hamburgers while on
the road. Though demanding that his executives think for
themselves -- he sometimes handed out $100 bills for good
ideas -- he could explode in anger when things weren't done
to his liking. He once tossed $1,000 in cash from his office
balcony in front of stunned executives to dramatize his point
that they were throwing away money on unnecessary expenses.</p>
<p>U-Haul dealers never knew when the founder, who piloted
his own small plane, might suddenly appear on their lot and
quiz employees or inspect equipment. New Orleans police were
astonished to learn that the apparent burglar they had nabbed
scaling a dealership fence at 2 o'clock one morning was
U-Haul's millionaire founder, who wanted to inspect a damaged
truck he had spotted while driving by.</p>
<p>U-Haul's Fortunes Wane</p>
<p>Sam Shoen says brother Joe was already complaining about
their father's decision-making when they both joined the
company in 1973. "I'd walk home with him at night, and he'd
say, `The company is going bankrupt,'" Sam recalls.</p>
<p>Though L.S. Shoen scoffed at the grumbling, U-Haul was in
trouble. Competitors had begun snaring U-Haul customers, and
soaring fuel prices caused the closing of hundreds of
full-service gas stations that had been U-Haul dealers. In
typical freewheeling fashion, L.S. Shoen responded with a
bold diversification plan; ultimately, he opened a travel
agency, a full-service moving company and a mobile-home
rental service. He also started the first of nearly 1,100
free-standing "rental centers," stocking them with everything
from surfboards and baby chairs to champagne fountains and
folding dance floors.</p>
<p>But the founder's visions weren't always carefully thought
out. In some cases, U-Haul dealers were asked to rent out
items they hadn't been trained to operate. Other items
gathered by Mr. Shoen were simply unrentable, such as the
Asian-made picnic tables that were too small for American
adults. While the company borrowed heavily to finance the
expansion, Mr. Shoen lost customers by stubbornly refusing to
replace aging trucks and trailers.</p>
<p>"They lost their focus and let their core business run
down," says Alex Gould, a transportation analyst at Moody's
Investors Service.</p>
<p>As the business deteriorated, the recently divorced
patriarch tumbled into a deep depression that eventually led
to a two-week stay at a Los Angeles hospital in 1978. He
returned to find Mike grousing about harassment from Joe, and
Sam being accused of incompetence by Joe and Mark, who during
staff meetings began badgering their father about his
decisions.</p>
<p>Not even group counseling sessions with a psychologist and
a family-business expert could bring peace. So L.S. Shoen
shuffled his sons' assignments -- and created even more
resentment. Family members say an angry Mark took over West
Coast operations only after his father agreed not to visit or
communicate with any U-Haul employee in the region.</p>
<p>Eventually, in 1979, Joe and Mark resigned. Still hoping
to bring them back into the fold, L.S. continued to pay their
$86,000 salaries for two more years and let Form Builders
Inc., their new printing business, handle most of U-Haul's
business forms.</p>
<p>Joe and Mark Strike</p>
<p>But Joe apparently had something else in mind. In a 1988
deposition given in one of the family's many legal
confrontations in Arizona Superior Court, a longtime family
friend, Darrell Hamby, testified about a sheet of legal paper
that he frequently saw on Joe's desk during the early 1980s.
Although Joe has denied its existence, Mr. Hamby said he
recalled its title being something like "Getting Rid of the
Founding Father."</p>
<p>By late 1984, L.S. Shoen had given Joe and Mark, who
retained their large stockholdings, plenty of ammunition to
do just that. His refusal to replace U-Haul vehicles had
allowed Ryder to pull almost even in market share. With
U-Haul awash in high-interest debt, the expansion was halted,
and U-Haul laid off 5,000 workers, cut management salaries
10% and canceled the $200 employee Christmas bonus.</p>
<p>Armed with dire warnings about U-Haul's future and
promises of cash dividends on Amerco stock, Joe and Mark
enlisted enough family support to vote their father out as
Amerco chairman at the October 1986 shareholders' meeting.
The shaken founder -- who would later compare his betrayal to
that of Julius Caesar by the Roman Senate -- agreed to
retire, provided that his warring sons met with a
professional mediator to hammer out a compromise on future
management. The result was a disastrous arrangement that
paired Sam Shoen as Amerco president with archrival Joe as
chairman of a four-member board that included younger
brothers Jim and Paul, both his supporters.</p>
<p>Still hoping for peace, L.S. Shoen put the best face on
the coup at a retirement gala that the company dubbed the
"Celebration of Love and Respect." "I do have enough sense to
know that I should stop, move aside and get out of the way
without abandoning ship," he told the crowd. "I do want you
all to know that I trust my sons and daughters --
absolutely."</p>
<p>Just two days later, Mr. Shoen recalls, "I was on the
phone with Joe, and he accused me of stealing hundreds of
millions of his money by the way I had been running the
company. He (was) very brutal about it."</p>
<p>Three months later, Sam Shoen quit as president amid
continued bickering with Joe, who, according to Sam,
frequently countermanded and criticized his decisions. In a
letter, L.S. Shoen called Joe a "con man" and demanded his
resignation. "Your lust for power and greed blind you," he
wrote. "I will not quit until you are out."</p>
<p>Amid the uproar, some of Joe's sibling backers began to
waver, leaving him with less than a majority of assured
votes. That set off a vigorous round of lobbying of family
shareholders. Joe delivered, for example, on his pledge to
declare the company's first dividends, including a
$13.50-a-share whopper that gave family members a windfall
totaling $1.3 million. At the same time, he again canceled
the employees' Christmas bonus, explaining in a company
newsletter that "I won't spend money we don't have on a
discretionary bonus."</p>
<p>Hostilities also increased. That summer, Sam Shoen says,
the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners received an anonymous
complaint, later dismissed, that accused him of being a
psychopath, a drug addict and an alcoholic and of hindering
his father from getting proper medical care. Sam himself, who
was still an Amerco director, began pressing the board to
investigate the relationship between Amerco and Form
Builders, which continued to do much of U-Haul's printing.
IRS investigators also began looking into Form Builders,
focusing on its tax returns for the year ended June 30, 1984;
Sam and his father deny sparking the investigation.</p>
<p>The printing company, which until fiscal 1984 had been
owned by conservatorships of Mark and Joe's three young
children, reported revenue of $2.4 million, all but about
$7,000 of it involving U-Haul printing. Yet the company's
stock was sold that year to a longtime friend of Mark and Joe
for just $33,000. But what really intrigued the IRS, and
ultimately led to a $470,000 judgment for back taxes against
Form Builders, was a $1 million deduction for payments to the
Shoen children's trusts. Form Builders had claimed them as
business expenses.</p>
<p>Kitchen-Table Scheme</p>
<p>By the last weekend in July 1988, Sam and his father had
won over enough family members to gain control of 52% of the
stock. But Joe outmaneuvered them with a scheme hatched, in
part, around his kitchen table. While Sam and company were in
New York talking to investment bankers about what to do with
their stockholdings, Joe and his supporters on the board
pushed through an agreement to sell 8,099 shares of Amerco
treasury stock to five loyal executives for about $22
million, thereby shifting majority voting power back to Joe's
group. The executives didn't even have to come up with the
cash: Joe lent them the $800,000 down payment, which he
borrowed from the conservatorship accounts of his two
children.</p>
<p>Finally in full control, Joe barreled fullbore into a
five-year "back-to-basics" plan calling for replacement of
U-Haul's truck fleet at a cost of $1.5 billion, the sale of
unprofitable assets and the closure of many of the
unprofitable subsidiaries launched by L.S. Shoen a decade
earlier. The new management conducted the overhaul with all
the grace of a midnight coup, trumpeting in one 1989 press
release that "the chains of restraint that hobbled a stagnant
past management group were smashed."</p>
<p>Longtime executives with close ties to the founder were
suddenly asked, with little or no explanation, to turn in
company cars and credit cards. John Fowler, a regional vice
president and a 33-year Amerco veteran, says he was sacked
after refusing to fire another executive.</p>
<p>The firings infuriated the ousted founder. "These people
depended on me," says Mr. Shoen, who vented his rage in a
barrage of Arizona Superior Court lawsuits. One asked the
court to reverse the Amerco stock sale, on the ground that it
was merely a scam to gain control of the company. Three more
suits sought to have Joe and Mark removed as the conservators
of their children's trusts. In yet another action, joined by
sons Sam and Mike, L.S. Shoen accused Mark and Joe of
overcharging Amerco for Form Builders' services.</p>
<p>Headlines about the feud unnerved Wall Street
credit-rating services enough that they issued a low initial
rating on, and effectively killed, a proposed $100 million
Amerco preferred stock offering. Amerco subsequently hit Sam
Shoen with a $750 million suit in the Arizona court accusing
him of trying to sabotage the company by giving confidential
information to outsiders and slandering it to the press. Joe
and Mark personally filed another suit in the same court
against their father, brothers Sam and Mike and their
attorney, Marvin Johnson of Phoenix, and asked the court to
enjoin them from continuing their "war of harassment."</p>
<p>A way out of the tangled web was provided by Jerome
Kohlberg, the leveraged buy-out expert, who in early 1989
made an offer to L.S. Shoen to purchase Amerco for $875
million in cash and securities. But Joe rejected the bid
after meeting with the former Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.
partner on a yacht off Florida.</p>
<p>Bruising Confrontation</p>
<p>That March, a scuffle broke out after the Amerco
shareholders' meeting in Reno, Nev., over attempts by former
U-Haul law director Mike Shoen, who supports his father, to
tape-record the session. Afterwards, Mike posed shirtless for
a photographer to display bruises that he asserted had been
inflicted by his brother Mark, now president of U-Haul
International. In a subsequent interview with the Arizona
Republic, Joe Shoen -- who scheduled the next shareholders'
meeting for remote Tonopah, Nev. -- denied that anyone had
been beaten up. "After the meeting, people acted as human
beings," he said mysteriously.</p>
<p>Through a spokesman, Joe Shoen and his supporters declined
to discuss the Shoen family or Amerco for this article. Harry
DeShong, executive vice president of marketing and recipient
of some of the treasury stock issued in the battle for
control, says: "I don't want to substantiate or corroborate
anything related to the story you are writing."</p>
<p>Although every lawsuit filed against Joe Shoen's group and
the company has been dismissed on the merits, L.S. Shoen and
his supporters have appealed each decision. Meanwhile, the
struggle goes on. L.S. Shoen adopted a favorite nephew in a
move that could effectively increase his influence over some
trust-held Amerco stock. Amerco reduced the damages sought in
its suit against Sam Shoen from $750 million to $30 million
but added as defendants L.S. Shoen, sister Mary Anna
Shoen-Eaton, brother Mike Shoen and all of their spouses.
That suit is scheduled for trial Sept. 10.</p>
<p>Some U-Haul executives and family friends doubt that there
will ever be peace in the house of Shoen. As one former vice
president puts it: "There's no Shoen who will ever run that
company without the other Shoens making his life miserable."</p>
<p>In a long letter to all of his children last year, L.S.
Shoen admitted as much. He lamented the "tragedy which
ultimately may devastate our lives and the lives of our
children and grandchildren." Cut off from his company and
half his family, he spends much of his time pounding out long
letters to lawyers and friends, pouring over Amerco results
and cursing the day he first dreamed of a family dynasty.</p>
<p>"No man should give away his wealth or power until he
dies," the battered empire builder says. "No way. No way."</p>
