	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck & Co. said it expects to report
second-quarter profit plunged about 40% because of
higher-than-anticipated insurance claims and its
deteriorating retail business.
   The company projected earnings of about 65 cents a share,
compared with $391.2 million, or $1.11 a share, a year ago.
Earnings from continuing operations in last year's second
quarter were $334.9 million, or 95 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Edward A. Brennan, chairman and chief executive officer of
the retailing and financial services concern, said he
continues "to expect a solid performance for the second half
of the year, based on our outlook for continued moderate
growth in the economy."</p>
<p>But the announcement prompted analysts, many of whom have
been trimming their forecasts in recent weeks, to cut their
estimates further. Edward Weller of Montgomery Securities
said he is now forecasting full-year earnings of $1.35
billion, or $3.94 a share, down from $1.51 billion, or $4.30
a share, in 1989. "It looks like the eighth year of earning
approximately $4 a share," Mr. Weller said.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
Friday, Sears fell 37.5 cents to close at $34.25. Sears is
scheduled to report second-quarter results next week.</p>
<p>The company blamed higher claims at its Allstate insurance
unit partly on recent fires in California and said profit at
its merchandise group would be lower than a year ago.
Analysts noted that the Sears retail business is still
struggling to meet its sales plan, and that earnings were
under pressure because of markdowns.</p>
<p>Analysts nevertheless saw some cause for optimism.
"They're doing more and more of the right things," Mr. Weller
said. He cited a pickup in catalog sales after a decade of
stagnation and the company's new Brand Central appliance and
electronic departments, which are performing well.</p>
