	<p class="article-leader">Community Newspapers Inc., the newspaper chain that until
recently belonged to Ingersoll Publications Co., agreed to
sell its string of weekly newspapers on Long Island, N.Y., to
its original owner.
   Stanley Henry, chairman of Distribution Consultants Inc.,
said he will acquire the assets to Chanry Communications
Ltd., which publishes This Week newspapers, a chain of 78
weeklies on Long Island. Mr. Henry was president and
publisher of Chanry before selling it in 1987 to Community
Newspapers, one of several newspaper holding companies once
controlled by Ingersoll.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Community Newspapers has been seeking a buyer for the
chain for months. The newspapers have been battered by a
recession on Long Island that has turned the once-profitable
chain into a money loser. Robert Jelenic, chief executive
officer of Community Newspapers, said no other asset sales
were planned. Community Newspapers and Ingersoll's other U.S.
newspaper companies were acquired by investment banker E.M.
Warburg Pincus & Co. in early July after Warburg ended its
partnership with Ralph Ingersoll, chairman of Ingersoll
Publications.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Community Newspapers said that while
Chanry's liabilities will be assumed by Mr. Henry's
Distribution Consultants, "the cash involved in the
transaction will be plus or minus $1 million." In 1987,
Community Newspapers paid an estimated $30 million for
Chanry, including the cost of upgrading the papers from
shoppers to weekly newspapers heavy with local news.</p>
<p>Mr. Henry, who built the Chanry chain, said it was "not a
great time" to be acquiring newspapers. "But I am a Long
Island native," Mr. Henry said. "There is a recession now,
but I believe it will come back." Mr. Henry is also chairman
of Alternate Postal Delivery Inc., a national private
deliverer of magazines, catalogs and direct mail.</p>
