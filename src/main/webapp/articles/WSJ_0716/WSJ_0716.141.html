	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Congress, after a decade of almost
unquestioning support, is showing increased discomfort with
the high cost -- and resulting violence -- of the continued
U.S. role in the war in Afghanistan.
   "I don't want to pull the rug out from under the
administration, but I have a growing impatience with the pace
of the diplomatic initiative," says Senate Intelligence
Committee Chairman David Boren (D., Okla.). "We're fast
approaching a time when we must have a much more full-scale
review of policy decisions."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It might be better if we had a more open debate," says
House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.). "I would like to see
a reduction in the level of violence."</p>
<p>Secretary of State James Baker has sought to elevate talks
between U.S. and Soviet experts, but for months the
administration has chased the elusive goal of defining an
acceptable fate for the Kabul government's Soviet-backed
President Najibullah. Most recently, hopes were raised when
the new Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuli
Vorontsov, signaled the chance of a much reduced role for Mr.
Najibullah, according to officials. Mr. Vorontsov's comments
came in a June meeting with America's U.N. ambassador, Thomas
Pickering, but questions remain whether the Soviet diplomat,
who once served in Kabul, was speaking for Moscow or only for
himself.</p>
<p>Covert funding for the war comes from an estimated $280
million hastily approved by House and Senate Appropriations
Committees last fall, but the same lawmakers are more
skeptical today. The mujahdeen resistance, backed by the
U.S., Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, controls the Afghan
countryside but appears mired in a political and military
stalemate against the Soviet-financed Najibullah regime,
which holds Kabul and other major cities. Resistance claims
of fighting are regarded as suspect by their own supporters,
and within the U.S. intelligence community there is support
for the judgment that mujahdeen forces could fare as well if
both superpowers mutually reduced aid.</p>
<p>"I feel just as hard as flint," says Senate Appropriations
Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, a powerful champion for
continuing aid. But the West Virginia Democrat says he would
consider cuts if an enforceable agreement could be reached
with the Soviets to do the same.</p>
<p>"My concern is we're funding tribes that are fighting one
another," says Rep. John Murtha (D., Pa.), chairman of the
House subcommittee on defense appropriations. And his Senate
counterpart, Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii), recently
portrayed the guerrillas as a force "whose own unity of
purpose has been shattered by internecine strife." Of future
funding, Mr. Inouye says: "I'm certain we will take a better
look at it. The administration should be prepared for that."</p>
<p>As Sen. Inouye's comments suggest, the entire Afghan
policy has proceeded with few questions to date from
Congress. Past pressure has come almost exclusively from a
core group of conservatives who have been willing to invest
time in the issue and are intensely supportive of the
mujahdeen cause. By comparison, more moderate and often more
powerful lawmakers have been silent, rarely challenging U.S.
policy or even educating themselves about the distant war.</p>
<p>A year after the Soviet withdrawal, this tone has changed.
Though no firm consensus has emerged, lawmakers question not
only the costs of the war but the rationale for suppressing
debate by keeping the funding secret. There is no sympathy
for Mr. Najibullah, but members are willing to criticize the
guerrillas and the level of random killing sustained by U.S.
and Soviet assistance.</p>
<p>"I think it is time to review the policy," says Senate
Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D., Ga.), and
much the same sentiment is echoed by Sen. Bill Bradley (D.,
N.J.) and Maine Sen. William Cohen, the ranking Republican on
Senate Intelligence. "I think there are gaps in our
knowledge," says Mr. Bradley, who was an early proponent of
U.S. aid but has become one of the most outspoken critics in
committee deliberations on the issue. "The key is the policy,
and the policy has to adjust to changing circumstances," he
says. "I wonder to (what) extent this has been seriously
reviewed and looked at afresh."</p>
<p>The dissent on Afghanistan comes as lawmakers are
re-examining the secret U.S. role in wars in Cambodia and
Angola. Sen. Boren's panel voted last month to end covert aid
to anti-communist forces in Cambodia, and a secret funding
request for U.S.-backed forces in Angola was trimmed back by
the House intelligence panel this spring. Restrictions on aid
to the mujahdeen in Afghanistan are being discussed as well.
To buy time, Mr. Baker has highlighted his commitment to a
diplomatic solution, but the secretary surprised some in his
own State Department when he testified recently that the
remaining differences are "very, very narrow."</p>
<p>The two sides are near agreement on Afghan elections to be
overseen by an independent commission, but the more crucial
question has always been whether Mr. Najibullah will run the
government while the campaign takes place. A former head of
hated security forces, the Afghan leader is an anathema to
the resistance. And for all his skills as a politician, Mr.
Najibullah has yet to establish his own legitimacy or
direction after Marxism.</p>
<p>One option is for an independent commission -- including
respected Afghans -- to ask Mr. Najibullah and the most
radical mujahdeen leadership to step aside during the
elections. The stalemate underscores the limits of influence
for the two superpowers, which, after spending billions on
opposing armies, have developed an almost collegial
relationship on Afghanistan even as they are held captive by
their conflicting alliances.</p>
<p>Moscow turned to Washington in May, for example, when it
feared heavy rocket attacks by the mujahdeen in Kabul. And in
a plea reminiscent of America's own agony after Vietnam, the
Soviets seek help in freeing their prisoners of war held by
the guerrillas.</p>
<p>In turn, the U.S. is restricted not only by Mr.
Najibullah's survival but Washington's own decision to cut
itself off from Kabul by withdrawing all American diplomats
last year. After staying through the Soviet occupation, the
U.S. pulled out just as Russian troops withdrew. And though
the decision was justified first on security grounds, the
State Department is fearful that it will only further anger
the mujahdeen if a charge d'affaires is sent back now.</p>
<p>With its grassy playing fields and solid German
engineering, the U.S. compound in Kabul has become a symbol
for many Afghans of all the promise -- and emptiness -- of
the West. Pakistan, which is directly enmeshed in the
Afghanistan conflict, retains a highly respected diplomatic
staff in Kabul, while thousands of miles away, analysts in
Washington are reduced to asking returning reporters for
copies of Afghan newspapers they can no longer get. Friendly
diplomats express bafflement at the closed-door policy, and
Washington suffers by appearing to have turned its back at
the very moment when Afghans are trying to reach out to the
West.</p>
<p>"People are very interested in retying their links to
Western countries," says Ross Mountain, a senior official
with the growing U.N. presence in Kabul. Soviet supply planes
land daily, but around the corner from a faded sign in
Russian, Afghan soldiers practice their English. Finance
Minister Hamidullah Tarzi rambles fondly of college days in
southern Mississippi. And Pepsi is coming, lured by a new
generation of tax breaks.</p>
<p>"I frankly think it would be good to have a charge
(d'affaires) there," says Sen. Boren. Massachusetts Rep.
Silvio Conte, the ranking Republican on the House
Appropriations Committee, attached report language to a
House-passed State Department funding bill calling for a
review of the current policy. Sen. Byrd and GOP conservatives
defend the closed embassy as being designed to isolate Mr.
Najibullah, but Rep. Henry Hyde, a strong supporter of the
mujahdeen, says he could support the assignment of analysts
or a charge d'affaires to Kabul. "I'm not offended by the
notion of it," says the Illinois Republican. "I would support
a charge (d'affaires) over there simply because you learn
more from talking and listening to people."</p>
