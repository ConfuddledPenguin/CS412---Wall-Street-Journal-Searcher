	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Only a few days ago, investors had all but
given up hope that the Federal Reserve would cut interest
rates soon, and they were nervously awaiting the onslaught of
second-quarter corporate earnings.
   But on Friday the Fed eased rates; the Dow Jones
Industrial Average climbed to yet another record high, even
briefly tiptoeing across the 3000 mark for the first time.
But have the stock market's worries about profits gone away
-- or even moderated?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Not likely. "When the market wasn't doing well, people
felt rates were going up and earnings were going down," says
Byron Wien, U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley &
Co., who predicted at the start of this year that the
industrials would reach 3000 in the second half. Now, he
says, investors' fears of higher rates and slumping profits
are easing.</p>
<p>But for the market to make major progress from here, Mr.
Wien says, rates will have to come down even more, or
earnings will have to go up. And since the latter isn't
likely to happen in a big way, the push will have to come
from lower interest rates, he says.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Federal Reserve pushed the federal funds
rate, which banks charge each other for overnight loans, to
just over 8% from 8 1/4%, making good on Chairman Alan
Greenspan's remark Thursday that rates would have to fall to
alleviate a credit crunch. But, as promised, the cut was
modest -- too modest to cheer investors about the prospect of
a surge in economic growth that would significantly help
corporate earnings.</p>
<p>A quarter-point move "in the fed funds rate isn't likely
to engender much more than a marginal improvement in
corporate profitability," says Brian J. Fabbri, chief
economist at Midland Montagu Economics.</p>
<p>In terms of truly stimulating economic growth and
therefore corporate profits, "it's the effect on the consumer
that counts," Mr. Fabbri says. And a quarterpoint drop
probably won't lead to the kind of bank-loan rate cuts that
might make consumers feel better about consuming, he says.</p>
<p>It would probably take another quarter-point drop in the
federal funds rate to inspire banks to cut the prime rate,
the benchmark lending rate, Mr. Fabbri says.</p>
<p>Peter Anderson, president of IDS Advisory Group, a
Minneapolis money management firm, says he believes the Fed's
interest rate moves will do little to help corporate
profitability in the short term. That's because the Fed will
use interest rates only to stave off a recession -- not to
stimulate the economy in its present condition, he says.</p>
<p>For example, if Congress reaches an accord soon that lops
$50 billion or $60 billion off the budget deficit, the Fed
may allow interest rates to fall further, but only to offset
the economic damage that would be done by the tax increases
and spending cuts such an accord doubtless would include, Mr.
Anderson says.</p>
<p>Still, despite interest-rate concerns, some analysts think
the stock market has room to move up. Mr. Anderson says the
Dow industrials could rise well past 3000 this year. If
earnings on the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index total $26
to $27 a share this year, while investors are comfortable
with stocks selling at 15 times earnings, that would equate
to an industrial average of about 3250.</p>
<p>"Eventually, at the turn of the year, investors will
become more value-oriented in the market," Mr. Anderson says.
"People's concerns about earnings erosion will begin to
dissipate."</p>
<p>Edward M. Kerschner of PaineWebber thinks the Fed's credit
ease could give companies reason to believe "capital will be
reasonably available for sound and ordinary business needs. .
. . This easier policy could give the profit outlook a boost
later this year and into 1991. Businesses that had been
reluctant or even unable to move ahead because of fears of
unavailable credit will now find those concerns mitigated."</p>
<p>He predicts the stock market could move up an additional
10% to 20% over the next 12 to 18 months, putting the DJIA at
a fully valued 3250 to 3550. But that will only happen if
rates fall another half percentage point, Mr. Kerschner says.</p>
<p>Other analysts are more cautious. Ricky Harrington,
director of asset management at Marion Bass Securities,
Charlotte, N.C., worries that "the Dow is making new highs,
yet we continue to have narrow breadth. . . . That doesn't
mean we can't move to 3100, but it means you take a somewhat
defensive approach to this market. Right now, money managers
are all playing the same game. They are all buying the same
stocks. If they're not buying Procter & Gamble, then they are
sitting on the sidelines."</p>
<p>And in the short term, the outlook for interest rates
continues to worry many analysts.</p>
<p>Late last year, Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at First
Fidelity Bancorp., envisioned that by now the economy would
be showing lower inflation, lower interest rates and
corporate profits flattening out after declining. Although
inflation may be ready to fall and profits are improving
some, the interest rate picture remains troublesome, he says.</p>
<p>"A mere quarter-point decline in the fed funds rate will
not reinvigorate the economy," Mr. Levy says, "nor will it
amelioriate the credit conditions Greenspan spoke about." He
says the credit crunch has to do with softening credit demand
associated with the weak economy. "Better now to be invested
in companies whose earnings are certain to meet
expectations," he says. "In the near term, we need those
profits to sustain the recent stock market gains."</p>
<p>David B. Bostian Jr., chief investment strategist at
Jesup, Josephthal & Co., notes that the stock market's
initial response to the Fed's easing "was euphoric, and in
the short term, investors forgot about all of the earnings
concerns."</p>
<p>But this week, "the market may refocus on earnings," he
says. It probably would take another half-point interest rate
cut to generate enough "economic buoyancy" to help corporate
profits.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>The stock market continued its record-setting rally in
heavy trading, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average poking
through 3000 for the first time.</p>
<p>But although the average established its second straight
record high, it didn't hold above that mark as profit-taking
and futures-related selling sent the market well below the
highs of the session in late trading.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which surpassed 3000
just after 1:30 p.m. on its way to an intraday gain of more
than 33 points, finished 10.40 higher at 2980.20. For the
week, the average posted a gain of 75.25 points, or 2.6%.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index also
established a record high by climbing 1.01 to 200.33,
breaking the previous mark of 200.21, set June 4.</p>
<p>Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index finished just below their all-time peaks as a
result of the market's pullback.</p>
<p>The S&P 500 added 1.87 to 367.31 and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index gained 1.60 to 341.22; their record highs of
367.40 and 341.98, respectively, were also set June 4.</p>
<p>For the week, the S&P 500 rose 2.5% and the New York Stock
Exchange Composite rose 2.3%, as did the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index.</p>
<p>Big Board volume totaled 215.6 million shares, marking the
first time since midMay that the exchange posted back-to-back
sessions of more than 200 million shares. On Thursday, 211.5
million shares changed hands.</p>
<p>Indications that the Federal Reserve is moving in the
direction of lower interest rates fueled the market's latest
rally, traders said, as did several waves of programs linked
to stock-index arbitrage. But index-arbitrage selling --
where traders sell stocks and offset the positions in futures
to capture fleeting price differences -- surfaced in the
final hour of trading to weigh down the market. The Dow Jones
Utilities Average, seen as an interest-rate barometer, closed
0.32 lower at 206.17.</p>
<p>Although utility stocks were left out of the market's
rally, the Dow Jones Transportation Average jumped 22.63 to
1187.59 as railroad and airline issues posted especially
sharp gains.</p>
<p>Railroad stocks rallied after Salomon Brothers commented
favorably on the short-term prospects for the sector. Analyst
Michael Lloyd told Dow Jones Professional Investor Report
that industry traffic was stronger than expected last month,
and he singled out two railroad firms as beneficiaries:
Norfolk Southern, which rose 1/4 to 45 1/8, and Consolidated
Rail, which climbed 1 1/2 to 50 5/8.</p>
<p>Conrail also was the subject of positive comments from
PaineWebber analyst Anthony Hatch, who told the investor
report his second-quarter earnings estimate of $1.22 a share
"might be well short by as much as 20 cents a share" because
of its strong June traffic.</p>
<p>USAir Group paced the rally in the airline sector by
advancing 1 1/2 to 25 3/4. AMR, the owner of American
Airlines, gained 2 to 63 3/8; UAL, the owner of United
Airlines, rose 1 to 160 3/4; Delta Air Lines gained 5/8 to 74
1/4; Southwest Airlines added 1/2 to 27 1/2, and Alaska Air
Group rose 3/4 to 23 1/2.</p>
<p>Gene Jay Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal
& Co., said the rally in transportation stocks is "giving the
signs of confirmation that we want" in terms of the Dow
Theory. The theory holds that an advance in the Dow
transportation average lends support to a rally in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average.</p>
<p>Precious-metals stocks, buoyed by a rise in gold prices,
also were especially strong; August gold futures climbed $6
an ounce, to $365.70, in New York trading.</p>
<p>Battle Mountain Gold rose 5/8 to 11 1/2, Homestake Mining
added 5/8 to 18 3/8, Newmont Mining went up 1 1/2 to 46,
Placer Dome gained 3/8 to 16 3/8, ASA Ltd. advanced 1 3/4 to
47 1/2 and American Barrick Resources added 7/8 to 20.</p>
<p>Motel 6, the most active NYSE issue, jumped 2 3/4 to 22 as
6.7 million partnership units changed hands. Accor, a French
hotel, catering and tourism company, agreed to acquire Motel
6 for $22.50 a unit.</p>
<p>Castle & Cooke, which said several major companies have
expressed interest in acquiring its Dole Food unit, rallied 6
to 36 1/2 as 2 million shares changed hands. The company
retained Goldman Sachs as an adviser on the possible sale of
Dole.</p>
<p>Computer Associates International was second on the most
actives list as trading remained heavy in the wake of its
statement Thursday that second-quarter revenue dropped
"substantially" from a year ago and earnings may also be
lower. The stock, which plummeted 6 1/2 Thursday, dropped
another 3/8 to 9 7/8 on 6.5 million shares.</p>
<p>Sears Roebuck fell 3/8 to 34 1/4 after estimating that
second-quarter earnings from continuing operations would be
65 cents a share, down from 95 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Alcan Aluminium slipped 5/8 to 23 1/4 on 2.4 million
shares. The company reported that second-quarter earnings
dropped 65.6% from a year earlier; the latest results fell
short of analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>Genentech went down 1/2 to 29 after reporting that
second-quarter net income fell 44.8% from a year earlier. The
company also said it expects to record a loss for the year,
reflecting costs tied to its merger with Roche Holdings of
Switzerland.</p>
<p>Nynex lost 5/8 to 78. The staff of the New York Public
Service Commission recommended that the regulatory panel
require the company's New York Telephone unit, which is
requesting a $919 million rate increase for next year, to
instead reduce rates by $81 million.</p>
