	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A House-passed appropriations bill would
authorize the Secret Service to initiate investigations of
savings and loan fraud and would direct the Internal Revenue
Service to step up its tax enforcement against foreign-owned
U.S. companies.
   The $20.7 billion measure won easy approval on a 300-72
roll call, but the expanded power for the Secret Service is
provoking a behind-the-scenes turf war with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation over control of savings and loan
cases.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While Secret Service officials have quietly welcomed the
initiative, the White House has lined up behind the Justice
Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, whose
representatives scrambled unsuccessfully to put any such
Secret Service operations under the authority of Attorney
General Richard Thornburgh.</p>
<p>"There are more FBI guys up here than investigating the
S&Ls," joked Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, the ranking
Republican on the House Appropriations Committee. And while
all sides promised to coordinate efforts, Mr. Conte and House
Democratic Caucus Chairman Steny Hoyer of Maryland used their
positions to establish a legislative record allowing the
Secret Service to initiate investigations where the FBI isn't
directly involved.</p>
<p>The underlying measure, which goes next to the Senate,
funds the Treasury Department, Postal Service and much of the
White House's own operations for the new fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1. IRS funding would grow almost $633.7
million, to $6.13 billion, and the bill requires the agency
to use at least $10 million of the new money to crack down on
foreign-owned businesses.</p>
<p>The administration has protested this provision, but
politically the issue has drawn support from a striking
coalition of Republicans, opposed to raising new taxes, and
industrial-state Democrats looking for a vehicle to strike
back at competing Japanese companies.</p>
<p>By a 201-178 margin, the House rejected a proposal to cut
2% from all accounts other than the IRS. But the committee
leadership agreed separately to freeze allowances for former
presidents at the current fiscal 1990 level of $1.8 million.
Reflecting concern over former President Reagan's trip to
Japan last year, where he reportedly received $2 million in
speaking fees, the bill directs the Treasury to report in six
months on how to reduce expenditures in such cases. The
measure gives the Secret Service authority to accept private
donations to offset security costs in cases where a former
president travels for the purpose of earning a speaking fee.</p>
<p>Among White House accounts, the Office of Management and
Budget would grow to $49.3 million. After late-night
negotiations between the administration and the House
Government Operations Committee, Director Richard Darman was
able to sidestep a move to strike an estimated $4.5 million
for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.</p>
<p>Government Operations Committee Chairman John Conyers, who
met Friday with Mr. Darman and White House counsel C. Boyden
Gray, said he was satisfied that an "agreement in principle"
had been reached on changes sought by Congress in a
long-running fight over the role of the office in determining
regulatory decisions. The Michigan Democrat is among critics
who have demanded greater access to internal documents and
justification on any cost-benefit analysis used in future
cases. Mr. Conyers indicated concessions made by the White
House could expedite new authorization legislation pending in
his committee.</p>
<p>The House action came as Senate Appropriations Committee
Chairman Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.) signaled he would seek to
cut military spending to the level called for in the House
budget resolution. But he said he would trim back as well on
increases in House-passed appropriations bills for domestic
and foreign aid accounts. Discretionary appropriations for
non-defense programs would be $4.8 billion less than the
House, but to preserve some flexibility under Gramm-Rudman
rules, outlays would be pared back by only $3 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Byrd's defense numbers are more favorable to the
Pentagon in some respects than the Senate Budget Committee's
initial recommendations. But by accepting the House ceiling,
he is also demanding an estimated $1.5 billion more in
direct-outlay cuts than the Senate Armed Services Committee
bill reported last week.</p>
