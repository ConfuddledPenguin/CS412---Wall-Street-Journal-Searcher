	<p class="article-leader">Bundaberg Sugar Co. of Australia reported that after-tax
operating profit for the year ended April 30 rose 24% to 28.2
million Australian dollars (US$22.5 million) from A$22.8
million a year earlier.
   An estimated 10.7% increase in the price of sugar to A$361
a metric ton-equal to about 2,204.62 pounds -- boosted
profit, the company said, and all major sectors of the
company performed strongly. Bundaberg forecast in February
that its profit would rise at least 15%, largely because of
higher sugar prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Pretax operating profit rose 25% to A$46.8 million from
A$37.5 million. The company had extraordinary profit of
A$32.7 million from selling its interest in a coal joint
venture; the year-earlier period didn't have any special
item. Proceeds were used partly to eliminate long-term debt
and purchase assets to strengthen core businesses, Bundaberg
said.</p>
<p>Revenue increased 6.8% to A$299.9 million from A$280.8
million.</p>
<p>The dividend was raised 33% to 20 cents a share from 15
cents.</p>
