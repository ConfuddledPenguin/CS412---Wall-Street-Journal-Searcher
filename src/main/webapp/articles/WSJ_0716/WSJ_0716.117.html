	<p class="article-leader">SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. -- Genentech Inc., citing
merger-related expenses, said second-quarter net income was
down 45% on a 15% increase in revenue. Genentech also said it
expects a loss for the year because of merger costs.
   The biotechnology company said net income for the quarter
was $5.3 million, or six cents a share, down from $9.6
million, or 11 cents a share, for the year-ago quarter.
Revenue rose to $112.5 million from $97.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Genentech blamed the drop in net income on $7.2 million in
expenses related to its pending sale of a controlling stake
to Roche Holdings Inc. of Switzerland. The company said sales
of its heart attack drug, Activase, were $48.3 million for
the second quarter, compared with $48 million for the 1989
quarter. Sales of Protopin, a human growth hormone, were
$41.2 million, up from $31.1 million a year ago, the company
said.</p>
<p>Genentech's stock closed Friday at $29, down 50 cents, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
