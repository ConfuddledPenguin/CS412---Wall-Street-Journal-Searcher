	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
downgraded its rating on National Bank of Hungary debt to
Ba-1 from Baa-2.
   The rating concern said the action affects about $2.9
billion in long-term debt of the National Bank of Hungary,
which is the conduit that channels foreign-currency
borrowings into Hungary's treasury.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moody's cited several reasons for its move.</p>
<p>As communist regimes collapse in Eastern Europe, Moody's
said, "Hungary will have to compete with the sudden -- and
much larger -- level of demands for credit from all countries
in the area."</p>
<p>Economic and political crises have intensified payments
difficulties throughout the Eastern European region, Moody's
said, and private lenders are reluctant to increase, or even
maintain, their credit exposure there.</p>
<p>And Moody's said that as the East Bloc unravels, Hungary's
growth in output will be hurt and pressures on employment
will be created. "As Hungary is forced to compete in the
world markets, its hard-currency cash flow is likely to
suffer as well," the rating concern said.</p>
<p>Officials of the National Bank of Hungary office in New
York couldn't be reached to comment.</p>
