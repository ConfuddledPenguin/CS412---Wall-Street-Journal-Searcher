	<p class="article-leader">The mayor of Leningrad, Anatoli Sobchak, made a succinct
comment on last week's Supreme Soviet decrees authorizing
President Gorbachev to move quickly toward economic
restructuring. "I think we'll get to see where Mikhail
Sergeievich stands," said the MP from Leningrad. "Does he
believe in radical economic reform?"
   Mr. Gorbachev has been talking a lot about market
economics. On his U.S. tour he arranged a visit with Milton
Friedman in Palo Alto. But he now is armed with parliamentary
backing -- or so it seems -- for three drastic pro-market
steps. They are denationalization of state-owned property,
the installation of anti-monopoly rules and the creation of a
new banking system and stock exchange.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At first glance it looks like a breathtaking mandate,
coming from a legislative body that has been as timid as Mr.
Gorbachev about effective free-market measures. Presumably,
the Parliament was frightened at the public outrage and panic
buying generated when the government's economic plan,
stressing price increases, was put forth by Prime Minister
Ryzhkov last month. Most likely, the Parliament believes that
the Soviet economy is nearing collapse, which is probably
true.</p>
<p>President Gorbachev is being authorized to transfer
control of huge amounts of property from the central
bureaucracy to the individual republics, including the
Russian federation headed by his rival Boris Yeltsin.
Property ownership gives communist governments much of their
political power through ownership of the buildings where
people live and the factories where they work. Now, that is
supposedly to be passed to lower levels of government.
Denationalization of 60% of state property within three years
is said to be envisioned.</p>
<p>It is by no means certain that the republics will be more
eager than the central government has been to privatize
property. One thing is certain. If such transfers are made,
the Soviet Union will be taking a big step toward
decentralization. That process already is under way on an ad
hoc basis as a result of declarations of independence in the
Baltic and southern republics, not to mention Russia itself.
Giving control of property to those republics demanding
outright independence may appease them for a while, but Mr.
Gorbachev will wonder for how long.</p>
<p>As to anti-monopoly legislation, what can that mean? Will
Mr. Gorbachev start privatizing industry, doing it in such a
way as to create competing companies in each industry?
Presumably the creation of a stock market envisions something
like that, but you have to privatize first before a stock
market makes any sense. And is that new banking system to be
privatized as well?</p>
<p>A lot of this, it seems, will be up to Mr. Gorbachev. But
will he have the stomach for it? For that matter, there is
the question of how one goes about conducting a massive
transfer of titles to property in a place like the Soviet
Union. Reflexively, the central bureaucracy will be tempted
to stall and play games when confronted with this enormous
task.</p>
<p>But perhaps all that will be irrelevant. Backed by the
sense of legislative intent in the Supreme Soviet, don't be
surprised if the republic and local authorities start taking
over whatever is within their immediate reach. Some already
are.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev has a choice. He can either dismantle the
Soviet empire or watch it dismantle itself. Little wonder he
hasn't been feeling well of late.</p>
