	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The National Transportation Safety Board
said it believes the fan-disk fatigue crack that led to the
crash of a United Airlines jet in Iowa was "of a detectable
size" at the time of a major inspection before last July's
accident.
   But the board said it hasn't determined whether the crack
went undiscovered because the inspection was improperly done
or the inspection method was inadequate. In any case, it
called on the Federal Aviation Administration to develop
improved inspection methods -- perhaps involving electrical
current -- for detecting surface cracks in the fan disks of
General Electric Co.'s CF6-6 engines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Anthony Broderick, associate FAA administrator for
certification and regulation, said that he hadn't seen the
NTSB recommendation but that agency engineers will examine
it. "Certainly, we can always improve our inspection
techniques," he said. But Mr. Broderick added that he
believes it's an open question whether the crack was
detectable. "As in many accidents, technical people could
debate this for a long time," he said.</p>
<p>The safety board hasn't yet issued its final report on the
July 19 crash of a DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa, that killed 112
people on board. Investigators have already concluded that a
crack resulting from a metal impurity caused the fan disk to
fly apart. Shrapnel-like pieces sliced through the plane's
hydraulic lines, making the plane almost uncontrollable. The
aircraft crashed during an emergency landing.</p>
<p>The standard procedure for detecting surface cracks is
called a fluorescent penetrant inspection. The disk is
covered with a fluorescent liquid, then washed off, dusted
with a chemical developer and examined under fluorescent
light. Cracks typically show up as a result of absorbing and
retaining the liquid.</p>
<p>In an inspection that took place 760 flights before the
accident, the NTSB said, United used this procedure, but
didn't discover the crack.</p>
<p>"The safety board's investigation has revealed evidence
suggesting that, at the time of this fluorescent penetrant
inspection, the crack was of a detectable size," NTSB
Chairman James Kolstad said in a letter to FAA Administrator
James Busey.</p>
<p>But Rob Doughty, a spokesman for United, said the airline
hasn't any reason to believe that the crack was detectable at
the time of the inspection. He said he hadn't seen the NTSB
letter.</p>
<p>After the accident, the FAA ordered ultrasonic inspections
on the engines like the ones that were on the plane that
crashed. But the board, in its letter yesterday, said it was
concerned that the ultrasonic inspection wouldn't detect
surface cracks. It said the FAA should develop a method using
electrical currents, called an eddy current inspection, to
detect surface cracks.</p>
<p>In a separate action, the board recommended that the FAA
beef up its equipment for detecting wind-shear, a sharp
change in wind speed and direction that can be extremely
dangerous during aircraft takeoffs and landings.</p>
