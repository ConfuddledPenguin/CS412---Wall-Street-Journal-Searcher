	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that a company may
test-market a medical device on which another firm holds a
patent if the effort is part of an attempt to obtain federal
clearance to develop similar devices.
   The court determined, 6-2, that a federal law creating an
exception to patent-infringement claims to allow information
to be gathered about drugs also applies to medical devices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decision was a victory for Medtronic Inc. of
Minneapolis, which was sued for infringement by Eli Lilly &
Co. of Indianapolis. More broadly, it is a substantial defeat
for older, established medical-technology developers with
long-held patents, allowing more leeway and flexibility to
newer, upstart companies.</p>
<p>Older concerns, such as Procter & Gamble Co. and
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. warned in friend-of-the-court briefs
that such a decision would "curtail innovation" by
manufacturers of medical devices. But the attorneys general
of 19 states and the American Association of Retired Persons
filed briefs saying such a ruling would enhance competition
in design and marketing of medical technology.</p>
<p>The decision, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, required
the court to interpret a 1984 technical amendment to the
federal law that regulates food, pharmaceuticals and
cosmetics. The amendment said it isn't patent infringement to
use or sell a "patented invention" of another company if the
purpose is "reasonably related" to obtaining data to submit
to the FDA.</p>
<p>The FDA must approve all new drugs and medical devices.
The amendment was intended to allow competitors to enter the
commercial market as soon as a patent expires, rather than
waiting until then to start the test marketing.</p>
<p>Lilly sued Medtronic for infringement of its patent for a
pacemaker that regulates tachyarrhythmia, or a too-fast
heartbeat. Medtronic cited the 1984 amendment, asserting that
it is manufacturing its own implantable heartbeat regulator
for clinical testing to provide data to the FDA.</p>
<p>Lilly argued, and a federal district court in Philadelphia
agreed, that the amendment applied only to drugs and wasn't a
defense to patent-infringement claims on medical devices. In
1988, a federal jury awarded $26.6 million to Lilly for
patent infringement.</p>
<p>But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,
which handles all patent appeals, ruled in March 1989 that
Congress didn't intend to limit the provision to drugs. The
appeals court sent the case back to the district court to
decide whether Medtronic's use of the devices was solely for
the purpose of gathering FDA clinical data. But Eli Lilly
appealed to the high court, putting the issue of Medtronic's
purpose on hold.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the high court sent the case back to the court
to decide the validity of Medtronic's claim that it was
marketing the implantable heart regulator to gather
information for its FDA application.</p>
<p>Justices Anthony Kennedy and Byron White dissented, saying
Congress intended to limit the 1984 amendment to drugs.
Justice Sandra O'Connor didn't participate in the case. (Eli
Lilly & Co. vs. Medtronic Inc.)</p>
<p>Suing Thrift Regulators</p>
<p>The justices agreed to decide whether federal law allows
lawsuits for damages for the actions of federal bank
regulators that allegedly cause losses to former thrift
directors. The high court agreed to hear an appeal by the
Justice Department in a dispute with Thomas Gaubert, a former
Democratic fund-raiser and onetime chairman of Independent
American Savings Association of Irving, Texas.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court in New Orleans ruled in October
1989 that Mr. Gaubert may sue the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Dallas and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which Congress
has since replaced with the Office of Thrift Supervision.</p>
<p>Mr. Gaubert charged that he lost $25 million in property,
which bank regulators required him to contribute to bolster
the thrift's assets. The contribution was part of an
agreement in which Mr. Gaubert gave up control of the Texas
thrift in exchange for regulators' dropping an inquiry into
his role in an Iowa thrift.</p>
<p>While under the control of federal regulators, the Texas
thrift's value dropped from $75 million to a negative balance
of $400 million, wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert's
property.</p>
<p>Mr. Gaubert, along with four other former officers of
Independent American, was sued last month by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. for approving investments that the
FDIC said caused about $50 million in losses at the Texas
thrift. Last year, Mr. Gaubert was acquitted of bank fraud
charges brought by the Justice Department in connection with
the Iowa thrift.</p>
<p>The case before the Supreme Court involves the Federal
Tort Claims Act, which allows lawsuits for damages against
the government. The Justice Department argues that the
lawsuit is barred by a legal exception to the act unless
government employees were performing "discretionary"
functions. But the appeals court ruled that the actions of
federal regulators with regard to Independent American were
"operational" in nature and weren't covered by the exception
for discretionary functions. (U.S. vs. Gaubert).</p>
<p>Apple Computer Case</p>
<p>The justices refused to hear an appeal by disgruntled
shareholders of Apple Computer Inc. who filed a
securities-fraud lawsuit after Apple's stock dropped 75% in
1983. The lawsuit contended that the company and its
directors made misleading statements about the sales
prospects for the Lisa computer and companion Twiggy disk
drive. In 1987, a federal judge dismissed the class action
without a trial, finding no evidence of a securities-law
violation.</p>
<p>In September 1989, a federal appeals court in San
Francisco affirmed the dismissal of most of the lawsuit. The
appeals court ruled that Apple's directors didn't
intentionally mislead investors about Lisa's outlook, because
the directors reasonably thought the prospects for success
were good. Moreover, the appeals court said that Apple's
optimistic statements about Lisa were offset by gloomy
forecasts and criticisms that reached the market through the
news media.</p>
<p>The appeals court ordered a trial on one issue of whether
Apple officials made misleading statements because they knew
of technical problems with the disk drive that would affect
production of the computer. That part of the case may now
proceed. (Schneider vs. Apple Computer Inc.)</p>
