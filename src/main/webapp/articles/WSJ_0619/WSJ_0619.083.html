	<p class="article-leader">AMSOUTH Bancorp. -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it
lowered its debt ratings on this banking company. The rating
agency also said it downgraded its rating of AmSouth Bank --
the Birmingham, Ala., company's lead bank -- for long-term
deposits. The changes affect about $123 million in long-term
debt. The rating service said the changes reflect uncertainty
about the performance of AmSouth's commercial real estate
portfolio. Moody's said, however, that the performance, asset
quality and capital support of the company's core businesses
should continue to support AmSouth's dominant position in
Alabama. The following ratings were lowered: AmSouth Bancorp.
floating-rate notes to single-A-2 from single-A-1;
subordinated capital notes to single-A-3 from single-A-2. The
Prime-1 rating of the company for commercial paper was
unchanged. AmSouth Bank long-term deposits to double-A-3 from
double-A-2. The Prime-1 rating of the bank for short-term
deposits was unchanged.

	<div class="article-body"><p>SALANT Corp. -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered
its rating on $75 million of this apparel company's senior
subordinated notes to D from triple-C-plus. The rating
concern cited Salant's obligation to suspend interest
payments on the public debt until the company cures a default
on $10.8 million of bank debt. Last week, Salant, which
emerged from bankruptcy court three years ago, said it may
again make a Chapter 11 filing, among other options; under
Chapter 11, a company operates with protection from
creditors' lawsuits while it tries to work out a plan to pay
or settle debts. Salant, which owns Manhattan Industries Inc.
and Denton Mills Inc., last week said that, in addition to
defaulting on the payment of interest and principal, it had
failed to comply with certain covenants in its credit
agreements with its bank lenders. And Salant said it wasn't
able to make an interest payment of $1.9 million on a
different issue of senior subordinated notes. That issue
isn't rated, an S&P spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>SOUTHTRUST Corp. (Birmingham, Ala.) -- Moody's Investors
Service Inc. said it lowered its long-term debt ratings for
this bank holding company and the rating for commercial
paper. Moody's also said the rating for long-term deposits of
SouthTrust Bank of Alabama, a subsidiary, was downgraded. The
changes affect about $105 million of long-term debt. The
rating service said the moves reflect the potential for
deterioration in SouthTrust's commercial real estate
portfolio. Moody's noted, however, that SouthTrust remains
profitable and well-capitalized. The following ratings are
affected: For SouthTrust Corp. -- senior debentures, to
single-A-3 from single-A-1; subordinated capital notes, to
Baa-1 from single-A-2; and commercial paper, to Prime-2 from
Prime-1. For SouthTrust Bank of Alabama -- long-term deposits
to single-A-1 from double-A-3. The Prime-1 rating of the bank
for short-term obligations is unchanged.</p>

<p>UNITED MERCHANTS & MANUFACTURERS Inc. (New York) --
Standard & Poor's Corp. said it downgraded its rating on this
apparel and jewelry concern's subordinated debt to D from
double-C. The company missed an interest payment due last
Friday on its 13 3/4% senior subordinated notes, due 2000;
the debt outstanding totals $116 million. The company is
seeking to restructure its debt. Barring operating
improvements and a meaningful debt restructuring, United
Merchants' long-term viability is questionable, S&P, a rating
concern, said.</p>
