	<p class="article-leader">Great Western Financial Corp. said it agreed to acquire
$700 million in Florida retail deposits from Carteret Savings
Bank, Morristown, N.J.
   Great Western will pay $26.5 million, or about 3.7 cents
on the dollar, for the deposits. The price includes the
purchase of certain Carteret branch offices in Palm Beach and
Broward counties, Fla.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Great Western, a Beverly Hills, Calif., savings and loan
concern, said the acquisition will increase its Florida
deposit base by 40% and substantially boost its presence in
Palm Beach County, one of the fastest-growing areas of the
nation.</p>
<p>Carteret, a unit of AmBase Corp., said the sale is a "key
element" in its plan to streamline its retail banking and
concentrate on New Jersey markets.</p>
<p>The proposed acquisition is considerably smaller than an
earlier Great Western plan to acquire about $2.4 billion in
deposits of CenTrust Bank, another New Jersey concern with
substantial Florida holdings. That deal, which called for a
cash payment of $150 million, or six cents for each dollar on
deposit, collapsed when CenTrust was seized by federal
regulators after running up huge junk-bond losses.</p>
