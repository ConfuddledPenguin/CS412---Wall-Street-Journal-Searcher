	<div class="article-body"><p>NORTH PLATTE, Neb. -- This isolated town of 25,000 people,
located between the clay and sand hills of central Nebraska,
is in a way the heart of America: It's the site of one of the
world's largest railroad yards, where the big freight trains
from the east and west coasts meet.</p>
<p>But even here in the heartland, a mini-invasion of
Japanese is under way. Japanese investors bought a cattle
ranch in nearby Brady last year, touching off a ruckus that
still hasn't abated.</p>
<p>"I know how them Orientals think," says William Thanel,
standing inside his gas station. "When we lose this land, you
can't buy it back from them. It will go from generation to
generation. You'll never get it back."</p>
<p>"Pretty soon they're going to be taking us over," agrees
Helen Higginbotham, as she pours a cup of coffee at Roger's
diner. "That's what I'm worried about."</p>
<p>Like fast-growing kudzu vines, Japanese money is spreading
across America, buying up tens of billions of dollars in
Treasury bonds and sewage-treatment plants, skyscrapers and
ski resorts, grain elevators and golf courses. Japanese
investment in U.S. real estate has increased sevenfold since
1985, while investment in manufacturing leaped to $12 billion
from $3 billion in the same period.</p>
<p>The purchases have included high-profile "trophies," such
as Columbia Pictures and a controlling interest in
Rockefeller Center, and show little sign of slowing. Unlike
the short-lived, oil-fueled Arab investment boom of the
1970s, this one is driven by more fundamental causes. High
savings rates in Japan have left the newly wealthy Japanese
with huge quantities of money to spread around the globe. Low
American savings rates, combined with huge budget deficits,
have left the U.S. dependent on those funds.</p>
<p>Moreover, the dollar's steep decline in the last five
years has turned the U.S. into a bargain basement for the
Japanese. Relatively low land and food prices and even wages
make the U.S. seem almost like a Third World nation in
comparison to Japan. Susumu Ohara, a Japanese newspaper
executive in New York, says he arranges to get menus with no
prices when treating guests from Tokyo at one of New York's
most expensive Japanese restaurants. If his guests saw the
prices, he says, they would think him a cheapskate.</p>
<p>This deluge of Japanese money heightens the economic
uncertainties gnawing at America. For decades, Americans have
been investing heavily overseas and assuring concerned
foreigners that they would benefit from the investments. Now
that the shoe is on the other foot, Americans don't like it
at all. In a recent nationwide Wall Street Journal/NBC News
poll, 69% of registered voters said the Japanese already
invest "too much" in the United States. In North Carolina, a
group called "Help Save America for Our Kids' Future" sends
out mailings claiming that "Japanism" has replaced communism
as the major threat to the country.</p>
<p>Will Japanese money change the face of America, and will
the U.S. thereby lose control over its own destiny and its
influence abroad? That, more than the trade deficit, will be
the issue at the center of U.S.-Japan relations for the next
decade.</p>
<p>There is little question that the nation's future would be
more secure if it could rely on its own capital. But as long
as Americans save so little, that option is closed. "Better
American capital than Japanese capital," says Harvard
economist Lawrence Summers, "but better Japanese capital than
no capital at all."</p>
<p>Less clear is whether Japanese investment is more
worrisome than other foreign capital. Economists tend to
assume business people and investors around the globe are
motivated by the same consideration of the bottom line. But
some close observers of Japan insist the Japanese have
developed a different, more threatening breed of capitalism
-- one driven as much by national goals as individual profit.</p>
<p>"The Japanese have a much stronger sense of `we' and
`they' than Americans" and they are "importing their
insularity into the U.S," says Ivan Hall, a professor at
Gakushuin University in Tokyo. American employees of Japanese
companies, for example, complain their opportunities for
advancement are slim. And American companies say Japanese
firms here favor suppliers from Japan over those in the U.S.
In addition, some observers worry that Japanese companies
work to keep knowledge-intensive, high-paying jobs at home
while situating lower-skilled jobs in the U.S. The observers
also fear that during a global downturn, the Japanese might
shift the burden of unemployment to the U.S. and away from
their own country.</p>
<p>In the end, warns C. Tait Ratcliffe, a Tokyo-based
American economist and consultant, "Japan could adopt a sort
of industrial policy for the U.S. through its investments,"
deciding "which industries are appropriate for America."</p>
<p>Many economists argue that Japanese investment is a
blessing, holding down interest rates and creating jobs.
Moreover, some commentators say that in the new global
market, ownership no longer matters. Harvard professor Robert
Reich argues that it is much healthier to have Sony
television sets made in the U.S. than Zenith televisions made
in Mexico.</p>
<p>But as the Journal/NBC poll shows, most ordinary Americans
don't accept that sanguine view. "If you think ownership
doesn't matter," says Chalmers Johnson, a Japan specialist at
the University of California at San Diego, "you are not
playing the capitalism game any more."</p>
<p>Here in rural Nebraska, ownership does still matter, and
ownership by the Japanese sparks a special ire. "The Japanese
are highly visible, highly successful, and everybody is
envious of their wealth," says Don Bratten, a local
stockbroker. Sentiment is so strong that, after the Japanese
purchased the ranch in Brady, the local district attorney
dusted off a 100-year-old law barring sale of farm land to
"aliens" and filed a suit, now pending, demanding that the
ranch be sold to the state.</p>
<p>George Kuroki sees an element of racism in the dispute.
"That law has been ignored for 100 years," says Mr. Kuroki, a
third-generation Japanese-American whose family came to this
area decades ago. At age 83, he has lived and worked as a
farmer here all his life, but still decorates his house with
Japanese prints and designs. "Why, because a Japanese
national buys it, do they bring it up?" he asks of the old
law.</p>
<p>There is also a feeling in North Platte and elsewhere in
the U.S. that the Japanese play by different rules. "All they
are going to do with this land is raise beef and ship it to
Japan," complains Robert Hill, a railroad worker. "They need
to participate more in our society."</p>
<p>Do the Japanese play by different rules? When Michigan
State University economist Mordechai Kreinin studied the
Australian operations of 62 multinational companies -- 42 of
them owned by U.S. or European interests, 20 by Japanese --
his findings were stark. Factories owned by American
companies, and to a slightly lesser extent European firms,
contained equipment made in America, Japan and a variety of
European countries, without a pronounced national pattern. By
contrast, the "overwhelming preponderance" of the equipment
used in Japanese-owned factories came from Japan, he wrote in
The World Economy, a British journal.</p>
<p>"The Japanese are different," Mr. Kreinin says in an
interview. "When an American or European company buys
machinery to set up a plant, they take competitive bids. But
the Japanese go directly to Japan." He attributes this partly
to tradition, and partly to the so-called "keiretsu" --
large, loosely organized groups of companies in Japan that
own each other's stock and tend to buy from each other.</p>
<p>American construction companies are among those that have
most keenly felt the impact of this tendency to Buy Japanese.
They complain that while American firms building facilities
in Japan generally use Japanese prime contractors, Japanese
companies here don't reciprocate; instead, they generally use
Japanese contractors.</p>
<p>It's the same story in the auto-parts business. Even
though Japanese auto makers now produce more than a million
vehicles a year in the U.S., most of the parts still come
from Japanese manufacturers. Japanese auto makers have
repeatedly promised to buy U.S. parts, and some of them now
have set numerical targets for U.S. purchases. So far,
though, the targets are small and the progress slow.</p>
<p>All told, according to Norman Glickman and Douglas
Woodward, authors of a recent book on foreign investment in
the U.S., Japanese-affiliated companies in the U.S. imported
$71.1 billion worth of goods in 1987 while exporting only
$20.8 billion of goods. The difference -- about $50 billion
-- was about the size of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan
that year.</p>
<p>Mr. Kreinin's Australian study found that, in addition to
preferring Japanese suppliers, Japanese multinationals are
far more likely to rely on managers from home. Most Western
operations he examined were managed entirely by Australians.
Only one of the 20 Japanese operations was wholly
Australian-run. Even when Australian managers were used, they
were often shadowed by Japanese "advisers" who exercised the
real power.</p>
<p>Japanese government statistics partially support his
point. They show that 45% of the top officials and 85% of the
chief executives of Japanese companies' overseas subsidiaries
are Japanese. Only 20% of the top officials of foreign units
in Japan are sent by the home office.</p>
<p>At a Chinese restaurant in Tokyo's Roppongi district, five
young Westerners who work in Japanese corporations also seem
to endorse Mr. Kreinin's finding. They are members of the
Kaisha Society, a group formed to allow foreigners in
Japanese companies to share their experiences.</p>
<p>Alexander Muromcew is one of the group. He studied
Japanese in Japan during and after his undergraduate years at
Dartmouth College, and ultimately joined Mitsui & Co., a big
Japanese trading company, in New York. But the energetic
young man quickly became discouraged. None of the top
executives of the company, and fewer than 10% of the general
managers, were Americans. After he was sent to Tokyo, he
says, the company union explained to him just how different
his employment status was from that of his Japanese
colleagues. He found that he was on a separate track to
nowhere.</p>
<p>Mr. Muromcew says Mitsui is trying to improve conditions
for foreigners, but he decided not to hold his breath: Last
week, he left the company. His advice to Americans who face
the prospect of working for Japanese companies in the U.S.:
"You're going to be discriminated against. Do you want to be
a second-class citizen in your own country?"</p>
<p>In Tokyo, a Mitsui spokesman says the company is working
hard to increase the number of foreign managers in its employ
and to give overseas employees more opportunity to rise in
the company.</p>
<p>Peter Douglas, a Briton and another member of the Kaisha
Society, is more upbeat. He admires Japanese business
practices and enjoys Tokyo. But even he doesn't see much of a
future for foreign managers. "You can learn good techniques
in a Japanese company, but they don't promote foreigners."</p>
<p>Japanese companies say one problem they face in moving
ambitious foreigners up the ladder is finding people who
speak their language well enough. Moreover, even foreigners
proficient in the language may find the keenly formal
corporate culture in Japanese companies difficult to grasp. A
booklet handed to new employees by Dai-ichi Life Insurance
Co., for instance, includes complicated instructions on how
to stand with superiors on an elevator, how to behave during
golf games and how to express one's will without being too
direct. There's even a section entitled, "Funeral: Most
Serious Business Scene."</p>
<p>As for their operations in the U.S., certainly some
Japanese companies are trying to mollify their hosts. When
Americans complained that Japanese operations in the U.S.
didn't contribute much to local charities, Japan's government
began mulling a tax break for overseas philanthropy. And when
Americans complained that the Japanese hired too few
minorities and were insensitive to the concerns of blacks,
Keidanren, Japan's big business group, helped produce a
Japanese-television version of "Eyes on the Prize," a PBS
documentary on the civil-rights movement.</p>
<p>In some cases, at least, the efforts seem to be paying
off. Elaine Jolissant, an engineer at a computer-peripherals
factory in Hillsboro, Ore., owned by Fujitsu Ltd., was
hesitant to work for a Japanese company, fearing that its
"culture isn't designed for women yet." She now insists it
was an unfounded worry. "It turned out to be exactly the
opposite," she says. "They were very kind and respectful
toward me just like everybody else."</p>
<p>Fujitsu has no Americans in top management, but its
Hillsboro facility is run largely by non-Japanese. And while
the plant doesn't formally promise Japanese-style "lifetime"
jobs, employees there feel secure. By contrast, Mrs.
Jolissant says the American-owned company she left to take
the Fujitsu job closed its operations a year later and moved
them to Taiwan.</p>
<p>Still, even in Hillsboro, concern about the Japanese is
apparent. A poll last year by William Watts, a Washington
consultant, found the town evenly split over whether foreign
investment is good or bad. And a visit to McMenamin's pub at
the edge of the town makes it clear that critics of Japan
aren't hard to find.</p>
<p>"Right now, it's good for the economy," says Pete
Batchelor, drinking a beer. "But in the long run, I don't
know."</p>
<p>"We ought to stick with American companies," adds his
drinking companion, Tom Simpson. "This is America."</p>
<p>Try as they might to become better U.S. corporate
citizens, Japanese companies sometimes botch it. Calsonic
Manufacturing Corp., a Japanese auto parts supplier that has
a factory in Shelbyville, Tenn., donated $2 million to help
the town build grounds for its walking-horse shows, something
dear to the town's heart. There was just one hitch: Calsonic
set the dedication for Dec. 7 -- Pearl Harbor Day.</p>
<p>Shelbyville veterans were outraged. "We beat the hell out
of the Japanese" in World War II, says Austin Shofner, a
Marine who was a Japanese prisoner of war for 11 months. "If
we had not, we'd be crawling on our bellies now." Mr.
Shofner, known around town as "the general," thought the
money shouldn't have been accepted.</p>
<p>It was apparently Americans, not Japanese, who set the
date, and it was eventually changed. But by then, any good
will Calsonic had bought with its $2 million had evaporated.</p>
<p>In the end, it will take more than good public relations
to assuage the concerns of Americans. To do that, Japanese
companies would have to begin acting more like their European
and American counterparts: More non-Japanese would have to be
given prominent positions in management and more non-Japanese
suppliers would have to be awarded business.</p>
<p>Officials and experts in Japan say all this will
eventually happen, that Japanese companies simply need more
experience abroad. "This is just the first stage of
international investment," says Kenji Nagano, a senior staff
writer for the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the major business and
economic newspaper in Japan. "To survive, Japanese
multinationals will have to become more international."</p>
<p>But Mr. Kreinin, the economist who studied Japanese
companies in Australia, has his doubts that the culprit is
mere inexperience. "I don't buy that argument," he says. "In
the case of Australia, there were some {Japanese} companies
that weren't all that new. Yet whenever they had expansion
possibilities, they went straight back to Japan" for managers
and suppliers.</p>

<p>Do you think the amount of Japanese investment in the U.S.
is too much, about the right amount, or too little?</p>
