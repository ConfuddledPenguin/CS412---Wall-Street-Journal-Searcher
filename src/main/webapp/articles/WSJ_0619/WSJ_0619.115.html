	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. received
permission from the Federal Communications Commission to
transmit its phone lists to other companies, paving the way
for a new directory service from American Telephone &
Telegraph Co.
   The service, which AT&T calls Find America, had been
awaiting FCC clearance since January. Southwestern Bell will
offer the service to its local business customers under the
name Southwestern Bell DirectLine Custom.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The service is designed to allow corporate customers using
special software to gain electronic access to phone company
customer lists using a computer instead of an operator as an
intermediary. The idea is to spur productivity and lower
directory assistance charges.</p>
<p>An AT&T spokesman said the company has verbal agreements
with the other six regional Bell companies as well as
Cincinnati Bell and Southern New England Telephone Co. to
provide their listings. This should enable AT&T to offer
nationwide listings by the end of the year, the spokesman
said.</p>
