	<p class="article-leader">Talking about contemporary writers, Dame Rebecca West once
mentioned that one of her favorites was "that Polish woman
with the Indian name who lives in New York."
   Well, that in a nutshell pretty much describes Ruth Prawer
Jhabvala, whose 10 novels Simon & Schuster has now finished
reprinting in paperback. A more prolix biographer might also
add that she was born in 1927 to Polish Jewish parents, came
to England as a refugee in 1939, attended London University,
and then moved in 1951 to India with her husband, the Indian
architect C.S.H. Jhabvala, before heading for New York 24
years later.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Along the way, she won the Booker Prize for her novel
"Heat and Dust," and an Academy Award for "A Room With a
View," one of the numerous intelligent screen adaptations
she's written for her good friends, the producer-director
team of Ismail Merchant and James Ivory.</p>
<p>From her first novel, "Amrita" (1955), a tale of forbidden
love, to her most recent, "Three Continents" (1987), a
satiric look at wealthy Westerners and their guru, India has
furnished the background and inspiration for all but one of
Ms. Jhabvala's novels. ("The Search of Love and Beauty" was
set in America.)</p>
<p>Unlike many other Westerners fascinated with India,
however, Ms. Jhabvala claims she never was drawn there by its
mysticism. "If I hadn't married an Indian," she once wrote,
"I don't think I would ever have come here." A social realist
in the tradition of Jane Austen, Thackeray and Henry James
(whose "The Bostonians" she adapted for the screen), Ms.
Jhabvala turns a cooly rational eye on mysticism and
materialism alike, mocking the follies and pretensions of her
characters while maintaining a strong undercurrent of empathy
with their plights.</p>
<p>All this is evident in the last three novels now available
in paperback: They fully display the characteristic strengths
of her style and vision. "The Nature of Passion" (1956), her
second novel, is a classic story of generational conflict.
Lalaji, a rich New Delhi contractor, wants only the best for
his children. Three of them are settled, and his docile
middle daughter is content -- nay, downright eager -- to be
married off in the traditional, parent-arranged fashion. But
the youngest son and daughter are defiantly, petulantly
modern. The rashness of youth, however, is no match for the
wisdom and patience of maturity, and everything works out,
perhaps a little too neatly, in this nonetheless satisfying
novel.</p>
<p>The cultural and generational conflicts safely contained
in "The Nature of Passion" take a more dangerous turn in Ms.
Jhabvala's next novel, "Esmond in India" (1958). Two Indian
families, bound by ties of friendship (and a shared history
of participation in the civil-disobedience campaign that led
to Indian independence) hope to repair the slight breach that
occurred when the daughter of one refused to marry the son of
the other. She chose instead to marry an Englishman, Esmond
Stillwood. An expert on Indian literature, Stillwood has come
to loathe his beautiful, uneducated Indian wife and almost
everything about India, including the way that his little son
seems more and more Indian every day.</p>
<p>But this does not diminish his appeal in the eyes of
Shakuntala, sister of the man spurned by Esmond's unhappy
wife. A modern, college-educated young woman, Shakuntala sees
in Esmond all the romance and poetry of the West. This is a
subtler, more disturbing novel than its predecessor. The
characters are more carefully fleshed out, yet are all the
more inexorably entrapped by their own strong emotions and
powerful misconceptions.</p>
<p>In "A Backward Place" (1965), her sixth novel, Ms.
Jhabvala focuses on European expatriates. Judy, the heroine,
is a lower-middle-class Englishwoman whose marriage to Bal, a
handsome unemployed Indian actor, has provided a way out of
her drab background. She, Bal and their two children share
cramped quarters with his extended family, and while she
struggles to make ends meet, working as a secretary, he hangs
out at coffeehouses, dreaming of stardom. Etta, an
acid-tongued Hungarian, urges Judy to leave this "backward
place," while pseudo-artistic Clarissa enthuses mindlessly
over all things Indian.</p>
<p>The contrasting pretensions of Judy's two friends make for
delicious high (and occasionally broad) comedy that balances
the pathos, not only of Judy's plight, but even of Etta's and
Clarissa's: Being more self-deluded, they actually are more
"trapped" in "a backward place" than the seemingly less
fortunate Judy.</p>
<p>Writing in the tradition of British social comedy, Ms.
Jhabvala -- like Henry James -- has expanded its range beyond
the country village, the suburb, the drawing rooms of a
clearly established social order, and demonstrated its
continuing viability and vitality amid a larger, less stable
world of crumbling social structures, displaced people, and
the fairly constant human tendency to delude ourselves.</p>
