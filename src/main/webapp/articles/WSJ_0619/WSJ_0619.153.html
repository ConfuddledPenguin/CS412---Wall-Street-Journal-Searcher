	<p class="article-leader">BEAVERTON, Ore. -- Richard K. Donahue, a director, was
named president and chief operating officer of Nike Inc.,
assuming duties previously discharged by Philip H. Knight.
   The 52-year-old Mr. Knight remains chairman and chief
executive officer of the maker of athletic wear. He said he
will remain "as involved in Nike's operations" as he
currently is, while counting on Mr. Donahue to help manage
Nike's continuing growth.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is not a change in Nike's management structure but a
supplement to it," Mr. Knight said. "We still have an
extremely strong core of officers who have brought the
company to where it is today. They will continue to do what
they have been doing, and so will I."</p>
<p>Mr. Donahue, 62, is a trial lawyer and partner in Donahue
& Donahue, a Lowell, Mass., law firm. He served as White
House congressional liaison in the Kennedy administration. A
Nike director since 1978, he has been credited with helping
direct the company's international expansion over the past
three years.</p>
<p>Mr. Donahue's appointment marks the second time Mr. Knight
has decided to share some of his duties. In 1983, he
appointed Robert Woodell, a vice president of world-wide
marketing, to the posts of president and chief operating
officer. But Mr. Woodell relinquished the posts to Mr. Knight
a year later; the company, at the time, cited a clash of
management styles.</p>
<p>Mr. Donahue, whatever else his talents, appears to have a
sense of humor. He is a father of 11 children and said he
couldn't turn down an opportunity to help run a company
associated with fitness and whose athletic shoes are promoted
by basketball superstar Michael Jordan.</p>
<p>"I have worked everywhere from the White House down," Mr.
Donahue said, but "this is the only {job} that will actually
impress my kids."</p>
