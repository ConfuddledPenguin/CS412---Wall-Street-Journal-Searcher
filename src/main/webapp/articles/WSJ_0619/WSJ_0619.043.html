	<p class="article-leader">If Mikhail Gorbachev thinks he's on a tightrope trying to
keep the Soviet Union together, he should try uniting the
Great Circus BimBom From Russia.
   About 10 of the Soviet circus's aerialists, known as the
Flying Stankeevs, are in Las Vegas, Nev., at the Landmark
Hotel. Thirty-plus acrobats are fishing and swimming at a
West Virginia ski resort, while more than 60 illusionists and
musicians are holed up at an Atlanta Travelodge motel.
Meanwhile, the circus's 13 horses, 12 soccer-playing Boxer
dogs, five bears, five chimps, three lions and a cart-pulling
goose are in New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The supposed two-year U.S. goodwill tour fell apart in
April, when Kuwaiti financial backers did a disappearing act
following an opening performance in Hershey, Pa. It's been a
zoo ever since.</p>
<p>Unpaid bus drivers and truckers quit but kept equipment as
ransom. The broke BimBom was evicted from a handful of
motels. And now promoters and Americans who have befriended
the troupe can't agree on getting the show on the road.</p>
<p>Andrew Truman, a circus tour director, says a two-year
contract has been lined up in Las Vegas, which is why the
aerialists are there. But Laurie McLeod, a circus truck
driver in Atlanta, where the group split up, says the
performers there, who are wary about the Las Vegas
arrangements, are adamant about not going to Nevada. Instead,
they're trying to work out a contract, possibly in Kentucky.</p>
<p>Mr. Truman says the Atlanta contingent has no choice:
"It's Vegas or Moscow." He says the circus's Russian sponsor,
who controls the terms of the troupe's American stay, has an
agreement with Nevada investors to begin performances in
July, albeit under a different name: the Great Russian
Circus. Evidently the Nevada investors decided to drop BimBom
-- the name of a Russian entertainer -- after clowning radio
stations called it the Bimbo circus.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the West Virginia performers have been told
nearly daily by the Nevada group to have their bags packed
for Las Vegas.</p>
<p>"They were supposed to leave on four different occasions.
Something always comes up," says Steven Drumheller, marketing
director for the Silver Creek Ski Resort, who heard of their
plight and invited circus members to West Virginia.</p>
<p>He doesn't mind, he says, but the lodge is running out of
donated food. And feeding people nicknamed "Grizzly" costs
more than peanuts.</p>
