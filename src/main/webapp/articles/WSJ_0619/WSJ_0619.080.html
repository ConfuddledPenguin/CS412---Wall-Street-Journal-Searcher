	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Commerce Department announced that
starting in early July it will allow U.S. exporters to ship
all but the most sensitive high-technology goods to major
U.S. allies without first obtaining licenses.
   Dennis Kloske, undersecretary of commerce for export
administration, said the change will obviate 20,000 export
licenses a year and help speed up deliveries of $30 billion
in annual shipments to America's best high-tech customers.
"This means giving U.S. businesses an even better chance to
compete in the international marketplace," he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new rule will free exports of most computers,
semiconductor-manufacturing equipment, precision instruments,
telecommunications equipment and other high-technology
products from licensing requirements.</p>
<p>The department said it will maintain existing licensing
requirements for shipments of some critical items, such as
supercomputers, X-ray lithography systems, certain underwater
sensing equipment and cryptographic devices. The new rule,
nonetheless, brings the U.S. and the 16 affected allied
countries a step closer to creating what their authorities
call a "license-free zone" within their borders. All the
countries belong to the Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls, which oversees joint efforts to
keep sensitive technology out of the hands of potential
adversaries.</p>
<p>The relaxation in licensing requirements is designed to
eliminate a disadvantage U.S. exporters face in trade within
Cocom; currently, they have to plow through more paper work
than their competitors in Japan or Western Europe.</p>
<p>The rule doesn't eliminate all paper work; exporters still
will be required to maintain some records in case authorities
decide they need it. But the department said it might end
even the remaining restrictions within a year if all the
Cocom members agree to raise their standards for enforcing
export controls to a common level. Mr. Kloske said Cocom has
set an April 30, 1991, deadline for completing this task.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department action comes on the heels of
Cocom's decision earlier this month to release previously
controlled Western technology to the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe. Despite that relaxation, the U.S. is trying to get
the other Cocom members to agree to uniform licensing
requirements for shipping the most strategically sensitive
goods among Cocom members. The Commerce Department commended
Japan, Canada, Norway and Australia for agreeing to follow
the U.S. lead.</p>
<p>The U.S. still requires licenses for shipments of certain
items even to Cocom destinations because they are considered
high-risk targets for illegal acquisition by the Soviet Union
or by Third World countries with clandestine programs to
build nuclear devices or ballistic missiles. Moreover, the
department said it will maintain existing controls on
shipments of chemical and biological weapons. Also unchanged
is the current U.S. practice of requiring buyers in other
Cocom countries to apply for re-export licenses before
shipping licensed U.S. products to other countries.</p>
