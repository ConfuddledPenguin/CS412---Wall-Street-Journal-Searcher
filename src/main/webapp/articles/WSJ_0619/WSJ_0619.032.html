	<p class="article-leader">From David Dinkins's New York to George Deukmejian's
California, cities and states are worried over budget
imbalances. But they should worry no more. Through the
application of one of the most successful fund-raising
techniques of private charity, localities could wipe out
their budget shortfalls practically overnight.
   The technique is "memorialization" or memorial giving --
the practice of naming things for big givers. Depending on
their generosity or that of their kith and kin, those
memorialized can achieve varying degrees of immortality by
having their names attached to things ranging from an entire
college, medical center or cultural complex to a stained
glass window, hospital bed, pew or tree.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>During the Metropolitan Opera's $100 million Centennial
Endowment Campaign in 1979-1984, $2,500 could buy immortality
in the form of a brass nameplate screwed onto the back of one
of the Met auditorium's 4,033 chairs. (I have sat behind the
chair embellished with the name Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.)</p>
<p>Why should this technique be restricted to private life?
Memorial giving could be a bonanza for financially strapped
cities and states. In New York City, for example, tens,
perhaps even hundreds, of millions of dollars could probably
be raised just by naming or renaming the 300 to 400 buildings
owned or leased by the city for housing its municipal
departments and agencies. The top price tags would most
likely be attached to the gorgeous Georgian City Hall, the
imposing Municipal Building and the marvelously baroque Hall
of Records, but a nice price could be had for the 984 largely
unnamed public schools, the 228 unnamed fire houses and the
75 unnamed police stations.</p>
<p>New York also has 1,472 parks, playgrounds and public
spaces. Many of these parks are only a few acres in size, and
so well within the purse of persons of quite modest means.
The bigger parks -- such as Central and Prospect Parks --
could either be sold in one go to some wealthy
publicity-hungry purchaser or carved into pieces to permit
individuals to buy a single baseball diamond or pond, or even
park bench.</p>
<p>The biggest windfall, however, would probably come from
New York's 6,402 miles of streets. The City Council already
authorizes about two dozen name changes a year. New names can
be suggested for almost any reason, but most usually they are
enacted to honor people or places or events that have had a
certain significance in the community. Thus, West 106th
Street is also Duke Ellington Boulevard, the Lincoln Center
complex contains a Richard Tucker Square and a block of
Christopher Street in lower Manhattan was recently renamed
Stonewall Place to mark the site of a landmark gay rights
uprising. Every New Yorker has heard of Bruckner Boulevard
and the Major Deegan Expressway, although few of them have
the foggiest idea who either man was. (Henry Bruckner was a
former congressman and Bronx borough president, who died in
1942; William F. Deegan was a former tenement house
commissioner.)</p>
<p>Present practices are all very well and could of course
continue. But if a city is renaming its streets anyway, it
seems foolish to miss the opportunity to make money out of
it, with the contributions called for determined by the
prominence of the street, its location and the number of
blocks of it desired. Again for the small giver, there would
be the opportunity to participate through a suitably
inscribed memorial manhole cover.</p>
<p>To be sure, there may be opposition to some name changes,
as there was when Sixth Avenue's name was switched to the
Avenue of the Americas. The Fifth Avenue Association, for
one, is not likely to be happy about the prospect of renaming
Fifth Avenue. But this is small-minded. Given the choice of
being hit with higher taxes to make up local government
deficits, or changing their stationery to read "Rockefeller
Road," "Annenberg Avenue," or "Sony Street," most New
Yorkers, like most Americans, would surely vote their pocket
books.</p>
