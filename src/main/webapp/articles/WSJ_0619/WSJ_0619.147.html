	<p class="article-leader">Novell Inc. plans to toughen the security features of its
network software products, responding to growing concerns
that personal computer networks are vulnerable to disruption
by electronic intruders.
   The Provo, Utah, company already offers limited security
features in its current networking products, which are widely
used by industry. But it is starting to incorporate into
Netware, its main software family, a more sophisticated
approach to security called public-key encryption. The method
enables many people to encrypt messages in such a way that
only one person can decipher them. It also allows one person
to send an encrypted message that numerous recipients can
understand.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To improve the security features of its products, Novell
said yesterday that on Friday it signed a license agreement
covering public-key technology from RSA Data Security Inc., a
closely held Redwood City, Calif., concern. RSA is generally
believed to sell the most efficient public-key software, and
it controls a key U.S. patent underlying its products.</p>
<p>"We considered doing this on our own . . . for about 10
minutes," said Richard King, Novell's vice president of
software development. "There are some things you can roll
your own on, but not this."</p>
<p>Mr. King said Novell would release its first product using
public-key techniques by the end of July. The product, called
Netware NameService, is designed to shorten the time it takes
for personal-computer users to access central computers on
the network where shared files and sensitive data are stored.
Novell's products now require a user to punch in a new
password for each server they wish to log onto. NameService
will make a single password work for all the network's
central computers.</p>
<p>Novell is the first important supplier of networking
software to embrace public-key cryptography, which has been a
controversial subject since its creation by a group of
academic researchers in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>Because it can afford security against intrusion normally
reserved for highly-sensitive government operations,
public-key has been an irritant to the National Security
Agency, which has complained that spread of public-key
cryptography will make it harder for the agency to monitor
secret transmissions. U.S. law allows the sale of public-key
products but restricts their export.</p>
<p>Supporters say public-key can reduce the threat of
computer network disruptions by limiting the spread of rogue
programs, and making it possible for recipients of electronic
messages to be sure they have received an authentic
communication.</p>
<p>"Right now there's nothing in the way of privacy or
authentication" for users of many PC networks, said Ralph
Merkle, a researcher at Xerox Corp.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some security specialists are skeptical
about the commercial prospects for products using public-key
techniques, such as the ones planned by Novell. "Significant
customer demand for (improved security) has just not appeared
yet," said Donn Parker, an electronic security consultant at
SRI International in Menlo Park, Calif. Mr. Parker predicted
it would take several years for public-key demand to mature.</p>
<p>Novell, however, hopes its aggressive stand on security
will give its products an advantage. "It's a feature that
will stand out," said Mr. King. "It shows people we're really
concerned about the integrity of their systems."</p>
<p>While the use of public-key remains small compared with
traditional "one-way" cryptography, it is catching on with
high-technology firms. Last year, Digital Equipment Corp.
signed a licensing deal with RSA Data and Lotus Development
Corp. introduced a software package called Notes that partly
relies on RSA Data's techniques.</p>
