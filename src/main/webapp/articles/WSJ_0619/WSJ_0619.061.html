	<p class="article-leader">Freshman Congressman Peter Smith of Vermont is outraged
that there has been no real investigation of the role
government officials played in creating the S&L scandal. So
he introduced a resolution calling for an independent counsel
to look into the matter. Congress has tried to exempt itself
from the independent-counsel law, but Rep. Smith says it must
be included. "No sitting Member or former Member should be
able to escape scrutiny," he told us. Feeling the heat from
outraged constituents, more than 150 House Members have
signed on to Mr. Smith's idea. We're hardly among the
independent-counsel law's supporters, but it would almost be
worth the price of admission to see one of these
locked-on-target prosecutors go cruising through Congress's
participation in the S&L scandal.</p>
