	<p class="article-leader">Among the many commencement ceremonies Hodding Carter III
has attended ("Commencement Speaking: Bloviating to the Bored
and Boorish," Viewpoint, May 10), mine was not one of them.
This is too bad for Mr. Carter, for if he had, his cynicism
might be tempered just a bit.
   I graduated in May 1982 from Gonzaga University, a small
Jesuit university in Spokane, Wash. The commencement address
was given by William Bennett, then chairman of the National
Endowment for the Humanities. His address was a typical
Bennett performance; very straightforward and to the point.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The point was common-sense advice on how to approach your
first job. The overall theme was plunge yourself into your
work, get to know every aspect of your job, get excited about
even the most mundane tasks, and become a true asset to your
company. It is based on the belief that good things happen to
people who work hard for the sake of a company. This was
well-timed advice that I've tried to follow throughout my
career.</p>
<p>To Mr. Bennett's credit, he did not use the event as a
platform to announce a new policy or political opinion. But
rather, he used it simply to address the graduates. Perhaps
if more speakers followed William Bennett's role, Hodding
Carter would be less apt to scrap the entire tradition.</p>
