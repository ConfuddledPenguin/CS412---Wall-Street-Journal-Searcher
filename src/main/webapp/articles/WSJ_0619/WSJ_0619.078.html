	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices plunged in thin trading,
suggesting to some analysts that the market has sopped up as
much cash as portfolio managers are willing to commit before
the quarter ends.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 53.71 points to
close at 2882.18. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices fell
three-eighths of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 of face
amount, in weak trading. The dollar sagged against most major
currencies amid rumors of a European move to let the dollar
weaken.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Institutional investors weren't big stock sellers, but the
steep drop suggested investors are less enthralled with
certain assumptions that have helped drive the market to
records -- particularly expectations of improving corporate
earnings and falling interest rates.</p>
<p>"The amount and intensity of selling did not warrant a
50-point decline," says market strategist Laszlo Birinyi, of
Birinyi Associates Inc. By his calculations, only about $21.2
million flowed out of the New York Stock Exchange in trades
of less than 10,000 shares, which Mr. Birinyi doesn't
consider a strong signal of an impending market decline.
Selling pressure didn't push prices lower so much as did the
absence of buyers, he says.</p>
<p>One unabashedly bearish market strategist, Abby Joseph
Cohen of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research, isn't surprised the
buyers stayed home. "People simply have run out of reasons to
buy," she says.</p>
<p>But while Mrs. Cohen thinks the drop is merely a foretaste
of as much as a 25% drop in stock prices, Mr. Birinyi sees
the market making no major moves either up or down for a
while; but then it will head higher on the next piece of good
news.</p>
<p>To detect changes in the direction of the market, Mr.
Birinyi watches money flow in and out of the Big Board. He
focuses on the dollar amounts of "non-block" trades under
10,000 shares each. He thinks such trades tend to set prices,
making them a more accurate measure of price moves.</p>
<p>After Jan. 2 of this year, for example, when the Dow Jones
Industrial Average was heading lower, the net money flow into
the market was flat at first and then turned sharply higher
just before the market itself started rising. The money
inflows, and the industrials, have been rising fairly
steadily ever since.</p>
<p>The time to watch for a market downturn, Mr. Birinyi says,
is when the Dow Jones industrials keep rising while money
starts flowing out of the market. That hasn't happened yet,
he says.</p>
<p>James Solloway, chief economist at Argus Research, saw the
decline as "some residual disappointments to last week's
news." Hopes that the Federal Reserve Board may ease interest
rates soon are fading because of strength in the industrial
sector, he says, and some companies signaled disappointing
earnings.</p>
<p>The drop in bond prices also appeared to be continuing
fallout from this past week's economic news. The dollar fell
on unconfirmed rumors that some European central banks wanted
to abandon a 1987 stabilization agreement.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices plunged in anemic trading of 133.5 million
shares on the Big Board.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond rose to 8.46%.</p>
<p>The dollar fell. In late New York trading, the currency
was quoted at 1.6758 marks and 153.66 yen, compared with
1.6875 marks and 153.90 yen Friday.</p>
