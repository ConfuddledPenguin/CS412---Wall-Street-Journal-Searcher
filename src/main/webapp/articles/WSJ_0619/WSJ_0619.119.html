	<p class="article-leader">Three New Jersey banks have tentatively agreed to
contribute about $15 million toward a $60 million loan
guarantee to Donald Trump, people involved in the
negotiations said.
   The agreement, reached in talks yesterday, would remove
one major obstacle to the loan package agreed to by Mr.
Trump's major creditors last week. The New Jersey banks are
said to be divisions of First Fidelity Bancorp, National
Westminster Bank and Midlantic National Bank. The banks
couldn't immediately be reached for comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Even with the New Jersey banks aboard, the developer's
loan package still faces obstacles in winning banks'
approval: Neither Chase Manhattan Corp. nor Citicorp are
believed to have persuaded other creditors who have purchased
portions of their loans to go along with the plan.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has been in intense discussions with his major
creditors for about three weeks after evidence mounted that
the cash flow from his properties would not be enough to
cover interest on about $2 billion in bank loans in the
coming year.</p>
<p>He missed $73 million in payments to Trump's Castle
bondholders and to Manufacturers Hanover Corp. If Mr. Trump's
bondholders are not paid by 12:01 a.m. EDT, June 27, they
will have the right to foreclose on the casino, which could
trigger defaults on many of Mr. Trump's other properties.</p>
<p>Under the tentative agreement reached with Mr. Trump's
creditors, the banks would suspend interest payments and give
Mr. Trump a little more than $60 million. In exchange, Mr.
Trump would put up the bulk of his empire as collateral and
agree to an orderly sale of many of his assets.</p>
<p>The banks are, in effect, betting that the $60 million
will be enough to tide Mr. Trump over, and allow him to avoid
selling his trophies at fire-sale prices. Mr. Trump owns
three Atlantic City casinos, the Trump Shuttle, the Plaza
Hotel in Manhattan, and various other real estate properties.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump's four major New York creditors are units of
Bankers Trust Corp., Chase Manhattan Corp., Citicorp and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</p>
