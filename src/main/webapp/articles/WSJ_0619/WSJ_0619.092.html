	<p class="article-leader">The grass-roots campaign to limit congressional terms
would have a better chance of deserved success if it shifted
its focus from trying to obtain a constitutional amendment to
persuading individual states to limit the number of
consecutive terms a senator or representative from that state
can serve in Congress. Contrary to popular misconception, it
already is in each state's power to take this unilateral
action to restore responsive democracy to its own
congressional elections.
   In recent elections, a trend has been established; in the
1988 elections, 98.5% of all House and 85.7% of all Senate
incumbents who chose to run again were re-elected. As a
result, congressional incumbents increasingly run unopposed.
This year four U.S. senators have no major-party opponent. As
a practical matter nowadays, once an individual enters
Congress, he obtains a lifetime appointment and is insulated
from the electorate. Recent polls show that voters are more
than 2-to-1 in favor of limiting congressional tenure by law.
(Not surprisingly, members of Congress are more than 2-to-1
opposed to the idea.)</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Responding to this erosion of competitive democracy by
Congress, a movement has begun in many states to adopt a
constitutional amendment to limit the tenure of U.S. senators
and representatives to 12 years. The goal is admirable, but
getting an amendment passed would be very difficult. Since
members of Congress obviously will not propose an amendment
to fire themselves every 12 years, two-thirds of the states
would have to call for a constitutional convention to write
the amendment without congressional approval, and then
three-quarters of the states would have to approve it.
Obviously, these supermajorities are hard to achieve in
theory, and in practice the Constitution has never been
amended in this manner.</p>
<p>However, a little-known alternative already exists in the
Constitution and is now being promoted by Terry Considine, a
Colorado state senator. Article I, Section 4, reprinted
nearby, has never been used by the states to limit the right
of a congressional incumbent to stand for re-election, which
may be the reason that some mistakenly assume that such
limitations can be enacted only by constitutional amendment
(see accompanying blurb -- WSJ June 19, 1990). But this
provision has been extensively used by the states to regulate
congressional elections, and its breadth has been clearly
established by an extensive array of Supreme Court cases.</p>
<p>State laws regulating elections have been challenged on
the grounds that they violate either of two constitutional
rights. That is, if they violate either the First Amendment
guarantee of freedom of speech or the 14th Amendment
guarantee of equal protection, then the election regulations
are open to attack. State election laws have fallen on these
grounds when they are shown to be tools of racism,
suppressive of minority political views, discriminatory
against poor people, or just contrary to a fair and open
democracy.</p>
<p>Therefore, state election laws have been defeated that
require voters to pay poll taxes, pass literacy tests, or own
property. Also, various schemes for drawing election
districts have been defeated on these grounds, including
districting that fails the "one-person-one-vote" test, and
at-large districting for city councils. Also, efforts to
restrict candidates, as opposed to voters, have been defeated
where they require filing fees for candidates, since that
prejudices poor candidates.</p>
<p>More to the point, however, state laws restricting
candidates from standing for election have withstood
constitutional challenge under the First and 14th amendments.
The Supreme Court has ruled that independent and minor-party
candidates can be kept off the ballot under certain
circumstances, and that minimum residency requirements for
candidates are permissible. Most important, in a 1982 Supreme
Court case, Clements v. Fashing, it was held that individuals
can be prevented from running for office if they are
incumbents in certain other elected offices.</p>
<p>The facts of Clements are a bit different than restricting
incumbents in Congress from running for re-election, but the
case establishes the constitutional analysis for
anti-incumbent laws. In Clements, Texas laws prohibited
incumbents in certain state offices from running for certain
other state offices. An incumbent challenged the laws on the
grounds that they violated the First and 14th amendments.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court upheld the state laws. It believed that
the voters' freedom of speech was not denied because they
could vote for another candidate of the same mind, and that
the candidate's freedom of speech was not denied because he
could speak, vote and act politically in any way, except
running for the proscribed offices at that time. On the
equal-protection issue, the court believed that the state had
a legitimate interest in regulating the integrity of its
elections and representation, and that no heightened scrutiny
was required because no fundamental right was denied. That
is, the court believed there is no inherent individual right
in the Constitution to stand as a candidate.</p>
<p>The best legal attack on state limits to congressional
elections appears to be by Article I, Sections 2 and 3 of the
Constitution. These two sections set out qualifications for
representatives and senators, respectively. State laws
restricting candidates for congressional elections have been
attacked from time to time on the ground that they actually
set out additional qualifications for such candidates,
improperly adding to these two sections of the Constitution.
State courts have sometimes agreed with such arguments, but
the leading federal cases reject the argument.</p>
<p>In 1974, in Storer v. Brown, the Supreme Court upheld a
California law that prohibited independent candidates in
congressional races who had changed to independent status
from a party affiliation within 11 months of the election.
This was found not to be a void additional qualification
because a valid state interest was pursued. In explaining
this state interest, the court said that "there must be a
substantial regulation {by the states} of elections if they
are to be fair and honest" and that the states' regulation
under the Constitution of "the times, places, and manner" of
their congressional elections may include "the qualifications
of candidates." This is necessary to pursue "the various
routes {of candidates} to the ballot."</p>
<p>Furthermore, this electoral process, if properly regulated
must have competition of ideas, parties and individual
candidates. It is only by this process that "the winner in
the general election . . . {earns} sufficient support to
govern effectively." Obviously, where the incumbent is the
pre-ordained winner in congressional elections, there is no
such competition, earned support and effective government.</p>
<p>The ruling in Storer as applied in a 1974 case in federal
district court in Pennsylvania to keep a congressional
incumbent off the general ballot. In Williams v. Tucker, a
House incumbent was defeated for re-election in a party
primary, and then was prevented by state law from running on
the general ballot for re-election as an independent. The
court found that states can restrict access of congressional
incumbents to the ballot, by using one-year waiting periods
before running for re-election, in order to pursue the Storer
state interest in an effective election process.</p>
<p>Two later federal cases get even more to the point in
reviewing state laws that prohibit certain incumbents from
running for Congress. In the 1980 case, Signorelli v. Evans,
the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York found that a New York
law requiring any state judge to resign before running for
Congress was not an additional qualification because of the
state interest in protecting the integrity of its own
representation. In the 1983 case, Joyner v. Mofford, the U.S.
Court of Appeals in Arizona upheld a law that provided that
no state-office incumbent could run for Congress. This was
found not to be an additional qualification because the state
incumbent was not barred from running for Congress (he only
had to resign from his current state office to run, or he
could just wait for the next congressional election). The
Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal.</p>
<p>The thrust of these cases is that the actions of a
democratically elected state government will not be
frustrated by the "no additional qualifications" clauses, if
the state limits candidates for its congressional races in a
way that does not offend freedom of speech or equal
protection and that pursues some state interest.</p>
<p>A state law restricting an incumbent in Congress from
merely succeeding himself in that office after a number of
years would pass these tests.</p>
<p>The cases about Article I, Section 4 and state regulation
of congressional elections present a consistent philosophy.
To paraphrase Harvard law professor Lawrence Tribe in his
book on constitutional law, candidate restrictions are not
reviewed as strictly as voter registration restrictions,
because most candidate restrictions are designed largely to
protect the electorate from its own shortsightedness.
Furthermore, the capacity to displace incumbents seeking
re-election in favor of the new representatives of a recently
coalesced majority is essential to a democratic system.</p>
<p>Few prospects are more antithetical to rule by the people
than a temporary majority entrenching itself by cleverly
manipulating the system through which voters, in theory, can
register their dissatisfaction by choosing new leaders.
Hence, the rigor of judicial review of election laws is
proportional to their potential for insulating the current
leadership from attack. Thus, courts have reviewed rather
summarily laws that specify requirements for individual
candidates. Indeed, limits on re-election to Congress would
specifically promote these democratic principles.</p>
<p>If a state unilaterally limits the tenure of its
congressional delegation, Congress may be able under the
Constitution to override this restriction by a majority vote
of both houses of Congress. However, to do this, a majority
of the members of Congress would have to go on record as
putting their own self-interest before a provision favored by
two-thirds of their constituency. A clearer statement of
"Congress vs. the People" could not be made.</p>
