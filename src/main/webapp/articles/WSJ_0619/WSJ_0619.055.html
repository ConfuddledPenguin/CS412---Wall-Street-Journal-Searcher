	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Security Pacific National Bank suddenly
closed its Third World debt-trading unit in April 1989 after
it had been in business for little more than a year.
   At the time, the closure of the unit, which was based in
New York, puzzled and surprised traders in the booming market
for Latin American and East European credits. But now new
information is coming to light that may help explain the
move.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to a report Sunday in the Independent, a London
newspaper, Antonio Angotti, the head of the Security Pacific
debt-trading unit, directed trades to be carried out that
involved selling loans at below prevailing market prices to
Fintech Inc., a small broker specializing in Mexican debt,
and that in one case involved a larger than usual commission.
Security Pacific National Bank is a unit of Security Pacific
Corp.</p>
<p>The debt-trading unit was shut down after Mr. Angotti's
three colleagues at the unit -- Stephen Maitland-Lewis,
George Buxton and William Cisneros -- prepared an 80-page
report detailing these trading patterns. According to former
bank officials, they sent it to Security Pacific's then
Chairman Richard Flamson III in March 1989. Reached by
telephone, each of the trio declined to respond to questions.</p>
<p>Mr. Angotti, who is now a White House fellow working at
the U.S. Treasury, declined to respond to questions and
directed telephone calls to his New York lawyer, Rita Hauser.
She said: "A total investigation was made. It went on for
many months. The bank concluded Mr. Angotti had done nothing
wrong." She added, "We entered into an agreement with the
bank," but didn't elaborate.</p>
<p>Security Pacific issued a statement saying: "That very
small sovereign debt unit was set up for the purpose of
selling Security Pacific's less developed country debt --
then about $1.8 billion. Over the next 12 to 15 months the
unit did sell $1.3 billion. We were interested in selling it
down as quickly as was prudently possible. We think we did a
pretty good job. There was an audit which found nothing
untoward."</p>
<p>According to the London newspaper, Security Pacific sold
$120.47 million of Mexican public debt to Fintech through
Swiss Bank Corp. on May 18, 1988, at 53 cents for each dollar
of face value. Fintech sold at least half that debt shortly
afterwards for 53.75 cents on the dollar, reaping a large
profit. Swiss Bank Corp. served as a guarantor of the Fintech
purchase, apparently because Fintech was a small broker.</p>
<p>The transaction attracted the attention of New York debt
traders because it was very large for a secondary loan market
transaction. Generally, such trades total $20 million or
less.</p>
<p>Reached by telephone, Jaime Montelegre, one of the two
owner-managers of Fintech, declined to comment on the
transaction. A Swiss Bank trader didn't return telephone
calls.</p>
<p>During the short life of Security Pacific's debt-trading
unit, several New York debt traders at a number of Wall
Street firms remarked on how it seemed to concentrate its
debt sales on Fintech, which until that time had been a
relatively specialized and little-known broker.</p>
<p>According to the Independent, when Security Pacific sold
about $3.3 million of Uruguayan central bank debt at 60.25
cents for each dollar of face value, Mr. Angotti directed one
of his colleagues, George Buxton, to send out payment
instructions directing that 2.25 cents on the dollar of the
money -- or $73,211.53 -- be sent to a Cayman Islands account
at Nederlandsche Middenstandsbank, account number a/c ABA-421
a/c 195340.</p>
<p>That would be higher than standard commissions, and NMB
apparently wasn't otherwise involved in the transaction.
Peter Geraghty, who runs NMB's Third World debt-trading
operation, said, "To the best of my knowledge, NMB never did
any Uruguayan transactions with Security Pacific." As for the
account number, Mr. Geraghty, says that is the standard New
York clearing account through which all his bank's
international payments go.</p>
<p>Richard Keller, who heads Security Pacific's Latin
American business and who was Mr. Angotti's boss, said: "We
undertook the better part of $1.3 billion of transactions. We
have been very explicit about what was undertaken, and we
have now shut down our trading unit."</p>
<p>Mr. Keller said that "all the transactions that we
reviewed were appropriate," and added that the bank's
internal review of the case "was a standard audit undertaken
by internal investigators."</p>
<p>As reported, the Federal Reserve is looking into some
suspected irregularities and improprieties in the so-called
secondary loan market, which is mostly based in New York but
also operates out of London. It isn't known whether the
Security Pacific case is part of that investigation.</p>
