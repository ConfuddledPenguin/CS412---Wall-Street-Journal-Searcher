	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Budget Director Richard Darman stepped up
pressure on Congress to cut a budget deal with the White
House in the next two weeks.
   Mr. Darman said he expected serious talks between the
administration and Congress to begin as early as tomorrow,
including a discussion of taxes. He stressed the importance
of reaching an agreement before Congress leaves for its July
Fourth holiday, saying that's probably "necessary to get a
deal done in a sensible fashion."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Darman also said it is important to put the agreement
into legislation before Congress leaves for its August
recess. "That is a real midnight hour," he said in response
to questions at a lunch with reporters.</p>
<p>In addition, the budget director said failure to enact a
budget agreement by mid-October would lead to automatic
spending cuts of $80 billion. The Gramm-Rudman budget law
mandates across-the-board cuts, called a sequester, if
deficit targets aren't met. "The sequester size this time
around is so large," he said, "that it cannot be managed by
tinkering with economic assumptions or technical
assumptions." Although large, the $80 billion figure is
smaller than some previous estimates Mr. Darman has
mentioned.</p>
<p>Democrats, including House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri who heads the talks, also have been
saying that the next two weeks are crucial. After a month of
meetings without any progress toward a deficit-reduction
package, they say the wisdom of agreeing to closed-door,
bipartisan negotiations will be in doubt unless there is
discernible progress soon.</p>
<p>But Democratic leaders also say it now is up to the
president to propose a solution to the problem that Mr.
Darman outlines, and they show no willingness to let the
president off the hook. "It isn't enough for the president to
fire a starting pistol and then step back and provide no
other leadership or impetus," said Sen. Wyche Fowler (D.,
Ga.), who is Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell's
delegate to the talks. "The president hasn't prepared the
public for the strong medicine that he is asking us to
produce."</p>
<p>He added, "Mr. Darman has the pulpit and he's got all the
choir books. When he wants to pass out his proposals to the
choir, then we'll see if we can find a tune that we can all
sing on."</p>
<p>Some Democrats also dismissed Mr. Darman's deadline. "I
don't think if we fail to get an agreement before July Fourth
that this whole coach turns into a pumpkin," said Sen. James
Sasser (D., Tenn.), chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
"We're still going to be around here. We've got sufficient
time after that to work toward an agreement."</p>
<p>Mr. Darman wouldn't say whether the administration would
put forward a deficit-cutting proposal this week, as the
Democrats have requested. "We've taken that issue under
advisement and don't either have an answer at the moment or
wish to make a big issue of it," he said.</p>
<p>But he predicted that one of three things will occur this
week: the administration puts a proposal on the table,
negotiators "invent a mechanism to get things on the table .
. . without authorship" or "people say, having failed at
those two things, `Let's break up.'"</p>
<p>The government has until mid-October to complete action on
a budget package before the Gramm-Rudman budget law's harsh
automatic spending cuts. But Mr. Darman and congressional
leaders appear anxious to complete a budget agreement well
before then.</p>
<p>Mr. Darman argued that completing a deal before August is
important because Congress will have to vote for an increase
in the national debt limit before lawmakers leave for their
August recess. Debt-limit increases are always controversial
and in the past have been vehicles for troublesome
budget-related legislation.</p>
<p>In addition, the administration and members of Congress
worry that if they wait until September, lawmakers may be
focused on the November elections and unwilling to approve
the tough spending cuts and tax increases necessary to close
the budget gap.</p>
<p>The budget director also said he planned to speed up the
release of the details of across-the-board cuts "to help
people focus on that." He said he would put the details out
July 15, rather than Aug. 25, as required by the budget law.</p>
<p>While some conservatives have argued that the
administration should let automatic spending cuts take effect
in October, Mr. Darman made it clear that that's not an
acceptable alternative. He said a $60 billion sequester would
force the Bureau of Prisons, for instance, to furlough 5,600
prisoners and would increase current prison overcrowding
"from 68% to 84%." And he said the cuts would lead to
reductions in air-traffic control personnel, resulting in an
"increase in the delays to travelers by 400% to 600%."</p>
<p>Asked whether there's a possibility of reaching a
big-enough budget pact without raising taxes, Mr. Darman
said, "There is on paper. Whether there is as a negotiating
matter remains to be determined."</p>
