	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks posted their fourth-largest loss
this year as they tumbled with exchange-listed shares.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 6.76, or 1.45%, to 460.79,
compared with a 1.83% drop in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. That's the largest decline since a 7.39-point drop
Jan. 30. Declining shares more than doubled advancing stocks,
1,424 to 582, as volume slipped to 157.6 million shares from
168.5 million shares Friday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The day's fall in share prices was orderly and marked by a
lack of buyers, rather than a rush of sellers, traders
agreed. "There was no panic selling," said E.E. "Buzzy"
Geduld, president of Herzog, Heine, Geduld Inc., a New York
dealer for other market professionals. Investors sold stocks
across-the-board and when they did buy, "they were very
particular," Mr. Geduld said.</p>
<p>Professional dealers were active in the market, according
to William A. Rothe, head of OTC trading at Alex. Brown &
Sons. "The dealers are selling to take advantage of the
momentum," Mr. Rothe suggested, adding that other investors
seemed to be cautious about their next moves.</p>
<p>At least one OTC trader said he found some signs of
encouragement in yesterday's fall. "I think the fact that
more people are bearish is bullish for the market," said
Richard Bruno, director of OTC trading for PaineWebber. Mr.
Bruno added that he doesn't expect the market's decline to be
prolonged.</p>
<p>Software Toolworks was the day's most active stock,
dropping 4 7/8 to 19 on nearly 3.5 million shares. A negative
article in Barron's flagged a number of concerns about the
high-flying stock.</p>
<p>The growing Chatsworth, Calif., software company has seen
its stock price triple in the first five months of 1990,
after tripling in 1989 from a low of $2.50 a share, amid the
prospect the company will sell Nintendo-related products.
Barron's cited the maturation and increasing competitiveness
of the Nintendo market; Software Toolwork's lackluster
outlook; insiders' plans to cash out nearly 30% of their
holdings through a secondary offering; the company's history
of growing by acquisition rather than through operating
acumen, and its possible use of aggressive accounting
practices.</p>
<p>However, Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood analyst Robert F.
Kleiber advised his clients that the article painted an
"unfair picture" of the company and recommended investors buy
the stock on weakness, according to a detailed rebuttal of
the Barron's piece he sent to clients.</p>
<p>Potential mergers or buy-outs sparked surges in Healthco
International, which jumped 2 1/2 to 18, and Fiserv, which
rose 2 7/8 to 29 3/8.</p>
<p>After hiring an investment banker last month, Healthco, a
Boston distributor of dental supplies and equipment, said its
board decided to explore all possible alternatives, including
a possible merger or acquisition. Healthco also said there
have been recent expressions of interest in a transaction
involving the company, but didn't elaborate. The company
scheduled a shareholders meeting for Sept. 6.</p>
<p>Last month, Gemini Partners L.P., which holds a 9.96%
stake in Healthco, said it intended to seek control of the
company by nominating a slate of candidates to replace the
current board.</p>
<p>Fiserv, a Milwaukee provider of data processing services,
said it has been approached by a company it wouldn't identify
about a possible corporate combination. The two companies had
preliminary discussions, but Fiserv said it couldn't predict
the outcome of the talks.</p>
<p>American Steel & Wire was among the day's percentage
gainers with a one-point gain to 7 1/4. Friday afternoon, the
Cuyahoga Heights, Ohio, maker of steel rods and wire declared
a special cash dividend of $3.25 a share, payable June 29.
The company also said it closed on $95 million of new credit
facilities.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a number of issues were pummeled after
companies reported negative earnings news.</p>
<p>Silk Greenhouse slid 1 1/8, or 34.6%, to a new 52-week low
of 2 1/8 following a series of adverse news. The Tampa, Fla.,
operator of artificial flower stores reported a loss of 60
cents a share for the first quarter ended April 30, down from
net income of four cents a share a year earlier, reflecting
"substantial" increases in expenses. To curb those costs, the
company said it cut "several hundred" employees from its work
force over the past few months.</p>
<p>Silk Greenhouse also announced that Chief Financial
Officer John Stokely, who joined the company in May, resigned
on June 8 and that two of its outside directors have resigned
since April 30. No replacements were named. Chairman and
President Jere Bradwell said salaries of certain senior
management, including his own, had been "reduced
significantly." Silk Greenhouse had traded as high as 10 1/8
this year and 24 1/4 within the past 52 weeks.</p>
<p>IFR Systems plunged 3 1/4 to 9 1/2, or 25.4%. The Wichita,
Kan., maker of communications testing equipment predicted a
decline in profitability for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1991. The company said fiscal 1990 earnings should be in line
with estimates. However, next year's profits will be
pressured by changes in the timing of deliveries under its
Sincgars Army contract, higher production costs for initial
deliveries under the contract, and an acceleration in
research and development and related manufacturing expenses.</p>
<p>J&J Snack Foods tumbled 2 1/8 to 7 7/8, a 21% decline,
after the Pennsauken, N.J., maker of frozen snack foods said
late Friday it expects earnings for the third quarter ending
June 30 will be lower than the 21 cents a share earned a year
earlier, although sales will be higher. J&J said higher costs
and disappointing retail supermarket sales have hurt
earnings.</p>
<p>First Commerce dropped 2 1/8 to 19 after the New
Orleans-based bank holding company said late Friday it
expects earnings for the second quarter to be 35 cents to 40
cents a share, down from 58 cents a share a year earlier. The
bank also said it expects provisions for loan losses will be
about $12 million for the second quarter, up from $8 million
in the first quarter and $5 million in the year-earlier
period.</p>
<p>CSP fell 1 to 5 5/8 after the Billerica, Mass., maker of
array processors and related computer software and hardware
processors reported net income for the third quarter ended
May 31 of a penny a share, down from eight cents a share a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Multibank Financial eased 3/4 to 11 1/4 after the Dedham,
Mass., commercial bank said late Friday that about $30
million of additions to its loan-loss reserves for the second
quarter ending in June will result in a loss of $11 million
for the second quarter and a loss of $8.1 million for the
first six months of 1990. Multibank reported net income of
$7.4 million, or 79 cents a share, in the year-earlier
quarter and of $14.1 million, or $1.51 a share, for the first
six months of 1989.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>DEB SHOPS Inc. earned 32 cents a share in the second
quarter of 1989. Wednesday's OTC Focus column misstated the
per-share earnings for that period.</p>
<p>(WSJ June 22, 1990)</p>
