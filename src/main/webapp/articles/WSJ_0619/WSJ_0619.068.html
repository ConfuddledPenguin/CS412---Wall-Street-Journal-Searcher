	<p class="article-leader">Nelson Mandela survived 27 years in a South African
prison. It remains to be seen whether he can survive a
two-week visit with the American media. Mr. Mandela's visit
to the United States is scheduled to receive saturation TV
coverage, and by its end, there's little doubt that Mr.
Mandela will sit in the eyes of many millions of Americans as
a man of courage and moral stature. We're more than a little
worried, however, that the bright lights are going to wash
out most of the complex political issues that swirl around
this man and his country.
   Mr. Mandela arrives in the U.S. tomorrow and will address
a joint session of Congress next week. While most such events
will focus on Mr. Mandela as a symbol of determined
resistance to apartheid, he is in fact the leader of an
organization, the African National Congress, that is itself
divided over the means appropriate to dismantle apartheid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Back in South Africa, militant blacks accuse the ANC's
leaders of "selling out" by pursuing negotiations with the de
Klerk government. Mr. Mandela can speak for himself, but
often his statements and actions suggest a man either
unwilling to disown the violent terrorist tactics of many in
his party or unable to disengage from their authority.</p>
<p>For instance, he will visit the U.S. fresh from trips on
which he repeatedly praised Moammar Gadhafi, Fidel Castro and
Yasser Arafat. This Thursday, Mr. Mandela is scheduled to
share a platform in New York with the three Puerto Rican
nationalists who spent 25 years in prison for the 1954
shooting of five Members of Congress inside the House
chamber. Organizer Jaime Estades says this "shouldn't alarm
anybody. Mandela is an ex-political prisoner who is meeting
with other political prisoners." Having been invited to
address a joint session of Congress, why does Mr. Mandela
feel obliged to show solidarity with people who shot up
Congress more than 30 years ago?</p>
<p>When Mr. Mandela was released in February, we expressed
the hope that he would realize that a free South Africa can
be won without continuing the "armed struggle" that has
killed many innocent civilians. Zambia's President Kenneth
Kaunda, host for the ANC's main bases, and Archbishop Desmond
Tutu have called on the ANC to suspend its guerrilla actions.
But Mr. Mandela insists that the ANC won't renounce violence
as part of power-sharing talks.</p>
<p>Mr. Mandela has met the PLO's Yasser Arafat three times,
more than with any other foreign leader. Mr. Mandela says,
"We are in the same trench struggling against the same enemy:
the twin Tel Aviv and Pretoria regimes, apartheid, racism,
colonialism and neocolonialism."</p>
<p>Visiting Angola in April, Mr. Mandela singled out Fidel
Castro's Cuba as an "inspiration" and praised "its love for
human rights and liberty."</p>
<p>Last month, Mr. Mandela went to Libya, where he said
dictator Moammar Gadhafi and he were "comrades in arms." Mr.
Mandela condemned the 1986 U.S. raid on Libya.</p>
<p>While Mr. Mandela is able to spend time and praise on
Messrs. Castro, Arafat and Gadhafi, he canceled a scheduled
meeting in his own country with Chief Gatsha Buthelezi, at
which the two men were to discuss the bloody warfare between
their followers. Three days before the meeting, the ANC
leadership reportedly persuaded him not to meet with the
pro-Western head of seven million Zulus.</p>
<p>Mr. Buthelezi is a nephew of the ANC's founder, and was a
loyal ANC member until the mid-1970s when he broke with the
group over its bombing of civilian targets. When asked about
Mr. Buthelezi in Rome last week, Mr. Mandela said the mere
mention of his name was "unfortunate." Mr. Buthelezi is
"totally isolated."</p>
<p>On the ground in South Africa, the ANC is a different
entity than the one often praised in the West. The ANC is
particularly hostile to objective coverage in the black media
of its actions. Thami Mazwai, an editor of the country's
largest black newspaper, the Sowetan, recently told of how
black newspapers had been threatened by the ANC and other
groups unhappy with coverage of "necklace" murders and
classroom boycotts. He and a Sowetan photographer were
recently cornered by activists intent, he said, on murdering
the two. Bystanders intervened. A regional president of the
ANC recently told reporters that the group "expects most, if
not all, members of the media to become card-carrying members
of the ANC."</p>
<p>Mr. Mandela leads a group that may soon hold
responsibility for the fate of millions of South Africans. If
he is serious about bringing peace to the country, someone
should ask him how it is in the best interests of his fellow
South Africans for him to visit Colonel Gadhafi as a comrade
while refusing even to talk to Mr. Buthelezi, the leader of
his country's largest tribe.</p>
