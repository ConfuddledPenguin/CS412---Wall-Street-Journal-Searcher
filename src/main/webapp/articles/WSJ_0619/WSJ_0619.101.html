	<p class="article-leader">CORPORATE JOB TRAINING expands, but it's still inadequate.
   That view is widely held. Most U.S. companies don't see
the link between "continuous training and continuous
improvement," says Harry Hutson, a Dennison Manufacturing
official. They ought to spend 5% of funds on training, he
says, but most spend well under 2%. Dennison and Marriott
Corp. note pressure, amid a worker pinch, to put a new hire
on the job right away, untrained.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rogers Corp. President Norman Greenman says U.S. firms lag
behind nations such as Germany in training. Dennison, Rogers,
Analysis & Technology Inc. and Minnesota Mining &
Manufacturing beef up their training programs. Motorola will
boost its $60 million training tab, to give 40 hours of
job-related courses a year to its 100,000 employees.</p>
<p>Motorola will emphasize retraining. A software engineer's
"half-life" is three to five years, a spokeswoman says.</p>
<p>SEAFIRST BECOMES the first large bank to bargain
collectively.</p>
<p>After a 12-year battle since the United Food and
Commercial Workers won a union representation vote, the
Seattle-based BankAmerica unit is finally negotiating; but
tough issues such as wages haven't been tackled yet. The
union says calls flood its Local 1182 for organizing help at
other banks such as Security Pacific and Wells Fargo, where
it says workers feel underpaid, overworked and dehumanized.</p>
<p>With banks less than 3% unionized, the industry is
"absolutely ripe" for organizing, the UFCW says, so the
Seafirst contract will loom large. After the Supreme Court
denied a Seafirst claim that the 1978 UFCW election win
wasn't valid, the bank questioned the union's continuity. A
lower court rejected that argument last December.</p>
<p>AS THE ARMY SHRINKS, the civilian market will tighten for
job seekers.</p>
<p>A 25% cut may be due for the 764,000-person army, arising
from plans to scale back defense programs. The Air Force,
down 50,000 since 1987, may slash another 90,000; less
proficient pilots or aircraft-repair workers won't be hired,
as standards are boosted, says a spokesman. The services want
to use attrition, the least painful, but any fast cuts could
mean discharges.</p>
<p>Troop levels and the military's civilian workers already
have eased 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively, from last year.
Finding work will be "difficult," especially for men trained
in special military skills, says AFL-CIO economist John
Zalusky. The American Federation of Government Employees says
workers hit by base closings should be retrained or placed in
vacant military jobs elsewhere.</p>
<p>But a Pentagon study shows more jobs were created than
lost when bases, closed in the past, became civilian airports
or industrial parks.</p>
<p>ON THE ROAD AGAIN: Forty-one percent of 684 responding
members of the American Productivity & Quality Center make
one to 10 business trips a year, and 27% travel between 11
and 20 times. More than half say that over 80% of the trips
are necessary. The champion: a public-sector manager who
makes 150 trips annually.</p>
<p>HEALTH CARE JOBS will grow the most in the 1990s, a Labor
Department outlook handbook and a poll of 100 executives by
consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas agree. Paralegals
will rise 75%, the largest single-job percentage climb, the
handbook says. Challenger's survey ranks entry-level,
computer and customer-service jobs behind health work, in
expected growth.</p>
<p>PUBLIC RELATIONS contributes to profits, 52 chief
executives surveyed by an International Association of
Business Communicators research group said. They gave PR a
235% return-on-investment rating. More-modest PR chiefs gave
themselves a 205% ROI rating, in the six-year, $400,000
study.</p>
<p>PRESCRIPTION DRUGS: a new corporate cost-cutting target.</p>
<p>Avon Products' drug claims, less controlled than hospital
bills, soared 75% in 1989, despite use of mail-order
discounts for workers on long-term care. AT&T spent $25
million for retiree drugs in 1988, more than for active
employees. It mulls mail-order plans and prescription cards
for discounts at certain pharmacies, aiming to replace a
"Cadillac" plan with a "Buick."</p>
<p>Many employer drug-benefit costs climbed as much as 30% in
the past year, says consultant Towers Perrin; it urges moves
such as special drug-use reviews and requiring switches to
cheaper generic drugs. Concurrent Computer trims workers'
share of the health-cost burden if they opt out of the drug
plan. Commercial Metals will better monitor employee claims
and look into discount plans.</p>
<p>Motors Management, a New Jersey auto-dealer chain, says it
will absorb the rising costs until it "gets too painful."</p>
<p>THE CHECKOFF: Lenore Miller is elected president of the
Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, the largest
woman-led North American union. . . . Unionists mail and
hand-deliver their trash to offices of Los Angeles-based JMB
Realty, to support a janitors' strike against a Denmark-based
contractor that cleans several JMB-owned buildings, and even
get into a fracas with police. . . . Don't go too far: The
Kamber Group, a labor PR firm, runs a "partial pro bono"
campaign to promote the 25th anniversary of two anti-poverty
programs.</p>
