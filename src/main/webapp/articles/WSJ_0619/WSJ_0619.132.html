	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Prices of corn and soybean futures contracts
rose in the wake of heavy weekend rains in the Midwest.
   Analysts said the rains prevented farmers from completing
their rain-delayed planting of the soybean crop. The rains
also washed out some fields and further soaked already
waterlogged corn fields.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rally follows the steep price declines that occurred
late last week, which were brought on by profit-taking. On
Thursday and Friday, the prices of some soybean futures
contracts dropped a total of about 20 cents a bushel.</p>
<p>In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade yesterday, the
soybean contract for July delivery rose 10 cents a bushel to
settle at $5.96 a bushel.</p>
<p>The price of the corn contract for July delivery rose 3.5
cents a bushel to settle at $2.865 a bushel.</p>
<p>Today, traders will study government reports released late
yesterday that showed that planting of the soybean crop is
only 79% complete nationwide. Usually, soybean planting is
88% finished by this time of the year. Corn planting wraps up
around the first of June.</p>
<p>Robert Lekberg, an analyst at Farmers Grain & Livestock
Corp., Chicago, said the Agriculture Department's reports
generally fell in line with analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>Sowing of soybeans is lagging particularly in Illinois,
where only 78% of the crop is planted. Normally, the soybean
planting season is finished in that state by this time of the
year.</p>
<p>Because of planting delays caused by the unusually wet
spring, most crop analysts have already shaved their original
projections for a corn harvest exceeding 8.1 billion bushels.
Estimates now range from 7.4 billion to 7.8 billion bushels.</p>
<p>Some traders have been expecting to see a sudden shift in
the weather this summer to hot and dry conditions. But there
isn't any sign of it yet. After the close of trading
yesterday, the National Weather Service's six to 10-day
forecast for the Midwest predicted below-normal temperatures
and normal precipitation.</p>
<p>Prices of wheat futures contracts settled mixed. According
to Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., Chicago, China is interested in buying 500,000
metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat for shipment in October.</p>
<p>Under a program designed to boost U.S. grain exports, the
Agriculture Department compensates exporters that ship U.S.
wheat to certain countries such as China and the Soviet
Union.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>ENERGY: The price of crude oil for delivery during July
fell below the important psychological level of $16 a barrel,
finishing yesterday at $15.94 as overproduction and hearty
supply continue to plague that market. The price for the OPEC
basket of crudes fell last week to $14.24, far below the $18
level cartel members had pledged to support at recent
meetings. And there doesn't appear to be any signs that
either Kuwait or the United Arab Emirates plans to reduce
production to quotas assigned them. Both have for months
flagrantly pumped far more than their alloted quotas. "Only
Saudi Arabia {of the major producers in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries} is holding back on their
output," said Nauman Barakat, first vice president, futures,
for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices rose. The July contract ended with
a gain of 2.10 cents a pound at $1.1390 after trading as high
as $1.1540. Prices were initially strong on unconfirmed
reports that the Ok Tedi mine in Papua New Guinea was
experiencing labor difficulties. One analyst said there
didn't appear to be any published reports but that talk of
the labor problems circulated in London and then in New York.
When the July price rose above $1.1250, fresh buying orders
were triggered, and a quick rally developed to the high of
the day. Also helping prices rise, the analyst said, were
reports that Asarco Inc.'s negotiations with the union
representing its workers had slowed over local issues. The
current contract runs out June 30. The analyst said there was
no known major risk of a strike taking place. Two other major
U.S. mining companies with contracts that also end on June 30
have recently come to agreement, greatly minimizing the
potential for any supply disruptions. Asarco also is expected
to reach agreement soon. A spokesman for Asarco said the
negotiations had been dwelling a little longer than expected
on local issues but said he had no other comment.</p>
<p>ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices again declined. The July
contract was off 3.20 cents a pound to $1.7630, for a two-day
loss of 13.85 cents. Prices traded over a 9.70-cent range, as
low as $1.70 and as high as $1.7970. At the low, the decline
represented a two-day loss of 20.15 cents. An analyst said
the selling continued from Friday, when a report circulated
that Brazilian juice processors would cut their price. The
report was later denied by the processors, but the selling
continued yesterday mostly on a technical basis, the analyst
said. However, he noted, good support developed at the $1.70
level, and the July contract recovered some of its losses.</p>
