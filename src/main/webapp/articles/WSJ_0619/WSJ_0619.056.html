	<p class="article-leader">Merck & Co. said it will cut prices for many prescription
drugs used by Medicaid patients in California, a move
expected to nudge other drug companies to offer discounts,
too.
   Officials from Merck and California said the company
agreed to lower prices about 8% to 12%, saving the state's
MediCal program about $2.8 million a year. Medi-Cal spends
about $30 million a year to reimburse pharmacies for Merck
drugs prescribed for Medicaid patients by physicians in the
state.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The officials said that in exchange for the price
reductions California will remove four of Merck's more
expensive drugs from a restricted list, which meant that the
state wasn't willing to pay for their use by Medicaid
patients. In particular, the state said it will begin paying
for prescriptions of Mevacor, a big-selling drug for lowering
cholesterol.</p>
<p>Merck, based in Rahway, N.J., set off a stir in the
pharmaceutical industry in April when it announced that it
would offer state Medicaid programs its "best price" for
drugs if the states wouldn't restrict the use of Merck drugs.
Merck has provided discounts of about 10% to Veterans'
Administration hospitals and other military organizations,
but hadn't offered the same markdowns to states.</p>
<p>Other drug companies offer even steeper discounts to the
VA, and matching Merck's "best price" offer to Medicaid
programs could involve deep price cuts for them. To date, no
other drug maker has publicly offered to reduce prices for
the state programs, although a spokesman for California's
Medi-Cal program said the state was negotiating a similar
arrangement with another company it declined to identify. The
state spends $570 million a year for prescription medicines
for Medicaid patients, about 16% of the $3.5 billion all
states spend on reimbursement for drug prescriptions.</p>
<p>Several industry officials said Merck's offer is a clever
bit of marketing. Merck has an especially large list of
relatively new drugs that have premium price tags, one reason
why some states restrict their use and encourage doctors to
use less expensive medicines for Medicaid recipients.</p>
<p>While the savings from Merck's discounts aren't large in
relation to total spending for medicines, California and
other states hope that other drug companies will be forced to
match the offer in order to get their drugs off restricted
lists, too. Merck said Utah and North Carolina have agreed to
take price discounts of about $100,000 each and it is
negotiating its discount offer with several other states.</p>
