	<p class="article-leader">JWP Inc. declared a 3-for-2 stock split, payable July 16
to stock of record June 29. Andrew T. Dwyer, chairman and
president, said the move reflects "continued excellent
performance" by the Purchase, N.Y., company, which has
interests in environmental systems and services, and operates
a water utility. JWP has about 25.4 million shares
outstanding. Mr. Dwyer said the split also will make the
stock attractive to a broader group of investors. JWP's
first-quarter net income rose 41% to $11 million, or 50 cents
a share, on a 49% climb in revenue to $513 million.</p>
