	<p class="article-leader">Dancing princesses who live at the bottom of a well. A
house with no floors, where guests must travel by rope from
room to room. A city that has freed itself from the laws of
gravity and circles the earth at leisure. They may sound
vaguely like fairy tales we've heard before, but they are
brand-new, used with startling effectiveness by Jeanette
Winterson in her new novel, "Sexing the Cherry" (Atlantic
Monthly Press, 167 pages, $19.95).
   Ms. Winterson is a young British writer whose last novel,
"Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit" (1985), was about a lesbian
orphan who is raised by fundamentalists. Provocative material
and an interest in fruit seem to be this author's
specialties. For provocation, "Sexing the Cherry" has plenty
of feminist revisionism and sexual violence; as for fruit, it
has descriptions of the first grafted cherry tree and the
first pineapple ever seen in England.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We are in London, in the year 1630, "a foul place, full of
pestilence and rot." A foundling is fished out of the rancid
Thames by a woman of freak-show proportions, with caves in
her face large enough to house fleas. She lives with "fifty
dogs and no company but her own," for she has a habit of
causing grave reproductive damage to any man who gets near
her. Yet the Dog-Woman, as she is known, raises the child she
has named Jordan very tenderly. At age 10 Jordan meets John
Tradescant, gardener to the king, who takes the boy as his
apprentice to design a great garden for the queen.</p>
<p>These are tough times for royalty, though, for this is the
era of the Civil War, when a Parliament full of Puritans and
their leader, Oliver Cromwell, are fighting to overthrow the
king. Eventually, in 1649, King Charles is put on trial and
condemned to death. Jordan, now 19, escapes with Tradescant
to sail around the world in search of exotic plants.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Dog-Woman resolves to avenge the king's
murder. She goes around London killing Puritans and
collecting their teeth and eyeballs in a sack. The
Dog-Woman's fellow Royalists are dismayed by this literal
interpretation of "an eye for an eye and a tooth for a
tooth," but she remains unperturbed, saying that "bodies mean
nothing to me, dead or alive. I would cry for my dogs and my
boy but the rest may vanish as they please."</p>
<p>During Jordan's travels, he stays as a guest in a
mysterious house with no floors. There he glimpses a dancer
escaping from her window by moonlight on a thin rope. Jordan
sets out in search of the dancer, disguising himself as a
woman, and tracks down her 11 sisters, dancing princesses who
tell him stories about the various ways they killed their
husbands. At last Jordan finds the 12th dancer on an island
that exists "sideways in time," and he spends a month with
her before joining Tradescant again.</p>
<p>In 1661 Jordan returns to London, bringing with him the
first pineapple ever to reach England. Tradescant is dead,
and so is Cromwell; Charles II has taken power. Jordan leaves
again to discover more uncharted territory, more exotic
fruits. Then, suddenly, we slip "sideways in time," to London
in 1990, where Jordan and the Dog-Woman are reincarnated as
contemporary Londoners.</p>
<p>Here the novel abruptly loses its convoluted charm,
turning into a glum lecture about modern-day political
corruption, the nuclear threat and environmental hazards.
Then, ending with a bitter portent of apocalypse, it skips
back once more to the 17th-century to recall the ravaging of
London by plague and fire in 1666.</p>
<p>In its combination of history and myth, "Sexing the
Cherry" covers a lot of ground in its 150-odd pages. But Ms.
Winterson is using history and myth for her own very
deliberate purposes. Those dancing princesses who murder
their husbands, that Dog-Woman who dismembers the members of
Parliament, the hero who dresses as a woman: It's clear that
this novel is a feminist power fantasy dressed up as a fairy
tale. Ms. Winterson's deceptively simple prose has echoes of
many literary forebears, all radical innovators in their
time: Dante, Rabelais, Defoe, Swift, Calvino, Garcia Marquez.
But all of these writers were male, and Ms. Winterson's
objective is to claim their territory on behalf of womankind.
Hers is a work of feminist imperialism that manages somehow
to be alarmingly destructive and enchantingly creative at the
same time.</p>
<p>On another level altogether is the American writer Laurie
Colwin's new novel, "Goodbye Without Leaving" (Poseidon, 253
pages, $18.95). If Ms. Winterson's book strives for the
proportions of an epic, Ms. Colwin's is the prose equivalent
of light verse. Geraldine Coleshares, an aimless graduate
student, lands her dream job: as the only white backup singer
for Vernon and Ruby Shakely and the Shakettes. But her glory
days don't last long. Before she knows it, she is married to
a nice lawyer and about to have a baby.</p>
<p>Geraldine has only two emotions: astonishment at her
sudden maturity and gushy love for her husband and newborn
son. Beyond this, neither she nor any of the other characters
seem to have much life at all. This is because Ms. Colwin
offers lots of slick observations about their experience, but
never adequately describes the experience itself. Some titles
from Ms. Colwin's previous novels give hints of the cheerful
banality to be found in her new book: "Happy All the Time,"
"Family Happiness," "Another Marvelous Thing." "Goodbye
Without Leaving" is as fatuously benign as "Sexing the
Cherry" is subversive and powerful.</p>
