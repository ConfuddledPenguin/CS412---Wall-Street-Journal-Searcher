	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Standard & Poor's Corp. said it lowered its
ratings on $8.2 billion of Occidental Petroleum Corp. debt
and preferred stock, citing high fixed costs, heavy dividend
demands and expected weak earnings.
   The New York ratings firm said Occidental's senior debt
and preferred stock were downgraded to triple-B-minus from
triple-B.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to Occidental's securities, the downgraded
senior debt includes similar ratings for Occidental's Oxy USA
Inc., Occidental International Finance N.V., Oxy
Petrochemicals Inc. (formerly Cain Chemical Inc.), and United
Energy Resources Inc. units. Preferred stock downgraded
included that of Oxy Petrochemicals and Natural Gas Pipelines
of America.</p>
<p>Also downgraded was Occidental's subordinated debt, which
was lowered to double-B-plus from triple-B-minus. The rating
on the company's commercial paper was dropped to A-3 from
A-2.</p>
<p>Standard & Poor's said the downgrades "reflect
expectations that Occidental's weak earnings and cash flow
protection measures will continue {to be} substandard for the
foreseeable future."</p>
<p>Occidental declined to comment on the downgrades, which
were announced after the close of trading. In New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, the company's common stock closed
at $26.50 a share, off 50 cents, paralleling declines in oil
issues and the overall market.</p>
<p>Analysts have for some time noted that Occidental, an oil,
chemicals and agricultural products concern, has paid
substantially more annually in dividends than it makes in
profit. Last year, for instance, cash dividend payments
totaled $679 million against net income of $285 million, or
$1.03 a share. Revenue last year totaled $20.07 billion.</p>
<p>S&P noted "high fixed charges stemming from aggressive
debt levels and a very high common dividend payout," which,
it said, "precludes meaningful improvement to the balance
sheet."</p>
<p>The rating concern said asset sales probably will be
required to supplement internally generated funds in meeting
Occidental's capital-spending requirements. It said
Occidental's financial flexibility is enhanced by a large,
diversified asset base.</p>
<p>However, the rating concern said that "absent
larger-than-expected asset sales, material debt reduction is
unlikely" and that debt as a proportion of overall capital is
likely to remain at about 55% or more. According to a recent
calculation, Occidental's debt represented about 58% of the
company's total capital, compared with an average of about
46% for the industry.</p>
