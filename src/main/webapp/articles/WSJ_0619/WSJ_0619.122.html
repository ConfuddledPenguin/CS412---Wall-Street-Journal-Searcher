	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- London's stock exchange may cut its work force
this year by a further 10%, or about 260 jobs, as part of a
continuing effort to reduce costs and increase efficiency.
   Releasing its annual report, the exchange said staff
totals have fallen to about 2,600 from 3,000 in recent years.
"We have clearly set targets to reduce that number further
over the coming year," the exchange said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Peter Rawlins, chief executive officer, declined at a news
conference to give specific targets, though he conceded an
additional reduction "on the order" of 10% is conceivable. He
said the exchange will try to achieve the cutbacks without
layoffs.</p>
<p>Mr. Rawlins said the exchange ended the year with a
#453,000 ($774,403) pretax profit after rebates to member
firms. The small surplus "very much reflects the essentially
break-even position to which we are aiming the finances of
the exchange," he said. After taxes, the exchange swung to a
#603,000 loss, compared with an #11.3 million surplus a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the exchange's chairman, Andrew Hugh Smith,
said he plans to meet with counterparts from other European
Community exchanges in Brussels on July 3 to discuss recent
efforts toward a common informationsharing and stock trading
system for Europe. These efforts have prompted acrimony among
various EC member states, but officials said they are
continuing to try to achieve a compromise to move their unity
campaign forward.</p>
