	<p class="article-leader">IRVINE, Calif. -- Gradco Systems Inc. reported a $28.7
million loss for its fourth quarter, reflecting one-time
write-downs related mostly to the company's closure of U.S.
manufacturing facilities and the loss of Xerox Corp. as a
major customer.
   The maker of paper-handling equipment for copiers and
printing machinery said the latest period's loss amounted to
$3.79 a share. A year earlier, Gradco had profit of $1.8
million, or 27 cents a share.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue plunged 36% in the latest period to $18.5 million
from $28.9 million.</p>
<p>Separately, Gradco said that, as a result of a newly
completed private sale of a 27% stake in the company's
Japanese subsidiary, Gradco will record a one-time gain of
$18 million, or $2.35 a share, for its first quarter, ending
June 30.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the sale will be used mostly to retire
parent company debt and to provide working capital for the
subsidiary. The sale was made to a group of Japanese
institutional investors and is intended to position the
subsidiary for a public stock sale in Japan, Gradco said.</p>
<p>Gradco's announcement was made after the close of trading.
The stock ended the day yesterday at $11 a share, up 50
cents, in national over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>The company said the revenue decline and much of the loss
on operations was due to the withdrawal of Xerox last year as
the company's largest customer. Officials said that last year
Xerox began production of a line of sorting equipment for
Xerox copiers.</p>
<p>Gradco said that on Friday it filed litigation in federal
court in Los Angeles alleging that Xerox is infringing on
Gradco patents. The suit asks damages and seeks an injunction
barring production.</p>
<p>Company officials said Gradco's sales to Xerox fell to $6
million in the year ended March 31 from $27 million in fiscal
1989.</p>
<p>Gradco said its loss for fiscal 1990 totaled $28.1
million, or $4.02 a share, including $23 million in one-time
charges. It had net income of $5.6 million, or 88 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue slid 22% to $89.5 million in
the latest year from $115.1 million.</p>
