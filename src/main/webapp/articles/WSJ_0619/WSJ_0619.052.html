	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The recent relaxation of Western controls on
technology exports to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe may
make it easier for countries in the Middle East to obtain
goods crucial to the production and use of nuclear weapons,
according to critics of the move.
   The items involved include krytrons and spark gaps,
electronic switching devices that were at the center of a
major flap in March when U.S. and British customs officers
arrested six members of an Iraqi ring. The six allegedly were
attempting to put packages containing the parts on a London
plane bound for Iraq.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The change in export rules, according to a spokeswoman for
the Commerce Department's Bureau of Export Administration,
would allow shipment of various previously restricted items
to "certain reliable Eastern European countries like Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia." The U.S., she said, hopes to
negotiate safeguard procedures "by which those countries
closely monitor the end use of such items."</p>
<p>But critics of the move charge that the relaxation could
accelerate the nuclear arms race in the Middle East. "This
means that Iraq can order U.S. bomb triggers through front
companies in Eastern Europe without breaking any laws,"
asserted Gary Milhollin, head of the Wisconsin Project on
Nuclear Arms Control, a Washington research firm.</p>
<p>The Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral
Export Controls (COCOM), approved the deletion of 30
categories of technology from its export-control list two
weeks ago. At least six of the categories, according to Mr.
Milhollin, were previously banned because they could be used
to make nuclear weapons or guided missiles to carry them.</p>
<p>"This points to the need for Cocom to start looking at
North-South proliferation," said Rep. Samuel Gejdenson (D.,
Conn.), chairman of a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee that
oversees international economic policy. "The real national
security risk we now face is Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya."</p>
<p>The congressman added that he welcomes increased trade
with the East bloc as long as it doesn't create security
risks elsewhere.</p>
<p>Iraq has established front businesses in Europe to shop
for controlled military technology, following the example of
Pakistan, which used a network of phony West German-based
companies during the 1980's to buy a large amount of
nuclear-weapons technology illegally.</p>
<p>While West Germany and other Western European nations now
insist that these avenues are closed, allowing the technology
to flow into Eastern Europe will create more of them,
according to Mr. Milhollin. He told a Senate Foreign
Relations Committee panel last week that "these cash-starved
and capital-poor regimes do not have functioning
export-control systems. There will be a great risk that their
companies will break the conditions of sale even if
conditions are imposed."</p>
<p>The technology involved in the changes includes spin
forming machines, which can be used to make high-speed
centrifuges for uranium enrichment, sophisticated
oscilloscopes, telemetry equipment and assemblies of quartz
crystals, all of which were previously controlled because
they could be used to develop missile-guidance systems.</p>
<p>U.S. controls banning direct sale to proliferation-prone
countries remain in effect, according to the Commerce
Department.</p>
<p>The best-known item removed from the 17-nation Cocom's
controls is probably krytrons, fast switching devices that
have featured in previous U.S. criminal cases against
Pakistani agents who tried to smuggle them out of the country
and an Israeli agent who succeeded.</p>
<p>Krytrons are used in a variety of commercial devices,
including copying machines, but more sophisticated versions
have been used in the trigger mechanisms of U.S. nuclear
weapons, which require exact timing of electronically
triggered explosive charges.</p>
<p>Donald M. Kerr, president of EG&G Inc. of Wellesley,
Mass., the only U.S. manufacturer of krytrons, says he
applauds the Cocom decision because krytrons have widespread
commercial uses. "To recognize that this is 50-year-old
technology seems to be sensible," he said. Linking the
technology to nuclear-bomb making, he asserted, is "akin to
saying if you have a cigarette lighter, from that you might
get a car."</p>
