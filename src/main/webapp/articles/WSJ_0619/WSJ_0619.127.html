	<p class="article-leader">Lloyd's of London, the insurance exchange, and Sun
Alliance PLC joined to market big-risk insurance in Europe,
the two sides said.
   The joint venture between Sun Alliance, Britain's biggest
general insurance company, and Lloyd's is aimed at drawing
European-based business to London in the wake of the European
Community's forthcoming market unification.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Called Eurosure, the insurance will be marketed through
Lloyd's four biggest brokers, CT Bowring & Co., Alexander
Howden Ltd. and the insurance-broking units of Sedgwick Group
PLC and Willis Faber PLC.</p>
<p>Sun Alliance and 35 Lloyd's underwriting syndicates will
give the brokers a ready facility to arrange policies on
large risks that they might otherwise find difficult to
handle, a Lloyd's spokesman said.</p>
<p>The areas of risk to be covered are property, business
interruption, public and product liability and marine cargo
cover.</p>
