	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- First Boston Corp. replaced the head of its
junk-bond department and reassigned other executives amid a
deep slump in its bond financing business.
   The big securities firm named managing director William R.
Reid to head its junk-bond operations, succeeding David M.
Malcolm, who was reassigned to head the firm's real estate
group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Several other First Boston executives were also moved out
of the junk-bond group, which like most of Wall Street's
departments specializing in high-yield, high-risk bonds,
doesn't have much to do these days.</p>
<p>Wesley Jones, a managing director, will move to the new
products group, according to people familiar with the firm.
Andrew Fisher, a vice president, is going to the
restructuring group. The moves are the latest signs of
turmoil at First Boston, which has been hit hard by the slump
in the $200 billion public junk-bond market.</p>
<p>The firm hasn't led a junk-bond underwriting so far this
year. By contrast, in 1989's first half, it raised nearly
$1.4 billion through junk issues, generating $45 million in
fees, according to Securities Data Co. For all of 1989, First
Boston ranked No. 6 among junk-bond underwriters, with an 8%
market share. (Industrywide, Wall Street has raised just $1.1
billion from new junk-bond issues so far this year, a 93%
drop from the year-earlier period.)</p>
<p>First Boston also has stumbled in refinancing some
temporary "bridge" loans it made to help corporate clients
finance takeovers. Earlier this year, the firm sold to CS
Holding more than half of a "hung" $450 million bridge loan
to Ohio Mattress Co. when First Boston couldn't easily sell
junk bonds in the market to refinance the loan.</p>
<p>First Boston's parent, CS First Boston Inc., is
44.5%-owned by CS Holding, which owns the Swiss banking giant
Credit Suisse. First Boston earned just $11 million last
year.</p>
<p>The executive shuffling comes amid a slump in First
Boston's overall bond-financing activities. This year through
Friday, the firm slumped to No. 5 from No. 2 in debt
underwriting, raising $12.4 billion through 61 issues for a
9.7% market share, according to Securities Data. Even with a
$1 billion financing deal yesterday, that's still a 16% drop
from the year-earlier level of $15.9 billion raised through
78 issues and a 12% market share.</p>
<p>Mr. Malcolm, who joined First Boston in 1979 from Kidder,
Peabody & Co., declined through a spokesman to comment on his
new post. "It's premature to talk about anything," the
spokesman said. Mr. Malcolm, who will oversee the firm's
20-member real estate group, began his career at First Boston
by launching the firm's leasing operations. He was named
managing director in 1982 and has headed the junk-bond group
since December 1984.</p>
<p>Mr. Malcolm, 43 years old, succeeds William Dickey, a
managing director, who will launch a new real estate division
in Los Angeles, the First Boston spokesman said. Mr. Dickey
will report to Mr. Malcolm; Mr. Malcolm will report to
Charles Murphy, co-head of investment banking.</p>
<p>Mr. Reid, 34, who joined First Boston's junk-bond
department in 1985, was traveling and couldn't be reached for
comment. He joined the firm in 1980 from the Stanford
Graduate School of Business. After serving as an account
officer, he was named a director in 1987 and a managing
director in 1988.</p>
<p>Messrs. Jones, Fisher and Dickey couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>The recent moves aren't the only significant personnel
changes at First Boston lately. Earlier this month, the firm
lost David C. Batten, a managing director since 1978 who
played a major role in building First Boston's capital
markets business, to Blackstone Group.</p>
