	<p class="article-leader">Japan's two leading camera makers, Minolta Camera Co. and
Nikon Corp., reported strong consolidated earnings gains for
the fiscal year ended March 31.
   Minolta said its pretax earnings soared 360% to 17.94
billion yen ($116.6 million) from 3.89 billion yen in the
previous fiscal year. Net profit grew more slowly but still
briskly, climbing 89% to 3.79 billion yen, or 13.58 yen a
share, from 2 billion yen, or 7.36 yen a share. Sales
increased 14% to 347.43 billion yen from 306.07 billion.
Minolta officials traced the strong earnings performance in
part to the yen's decline and the fact that the company's
U.S. unit moved into the black during the year.</p>
