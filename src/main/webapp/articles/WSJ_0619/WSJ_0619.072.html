	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp. may require LTV Corp. to reassume
liability for more than $2 billion in employee pension plans
that the company stopped funding in 1987.
   The ruling strongly reaffirms the authority of the
troubled pension agency, which is operating with a $1 billion
deficit, to protect the federal pension-insurance program
that it administers. An adverse high court ruling could have
increased the deficit to $7.8 billion if other companies
followed LTV's lead of filing for protection under Chapter 11
of the federal Bankruptcy Code and stopped funding of pension
plans, agency officials warned Congress last week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ruling "does send a strong message to all companies,"
said James Lockhart, the agency's executive director, that
they must fund plans adequately and not dump them, "unless
there's a real need."</p>
<p>The ruling is also likely to impede LTV's efforts to
complete a reorganization plan and emerge from Chapter 11. An
LTV spokesman said the situation "still has not changed -- we
couldn't afford the plans then, and we can't afford them
today."</p>
<p>The high court decision, written by Justice Harry
Blackmun, focused on the complex -- but not unusual --
situation in which a company stops funding pension plans,
either because of a Chapter 11 filing or some other inability
to keep up with the growing liability, and then institutes
new pension plans to accommodate union demands.</p>
<p>When a company stops funding pension plans, the pension
agency, which would become liable for the shortfall, has
authority to terminate the plans so that the liability
doesn't continue mounting.</p>
<p>But the agency has adopted a policy that prohibits
companies from instituting what the agency calls "follow-on"
plans that effectively reinstitute the same benefits in new
plans after shifting the old liability to the agency. The
agency views such plans as an abuse of the insurance program
and responds by ordering companies to restore the old plans
and the liability that goes with them.</p>
<p>That was the scenario that evolved between the agency and
LTV. But agency officials have warned that they could face
similar problems with other steel companies, and with
companies in the auto and airline industries as well. Agency
officials have declined to name the other companies. Mr.
Lockhart said the agency is currently negotiating with "a
handful of companies that want to terminate their pension
plans" and that most "would have liked to have had some sort
of follow-on plan."</p>
<p>Yesterday, agency general counsel Carol Connor Flowe said
the high court ruling was "extraordinary" in how far it
supported the agency, even ruling that it need only consider
the policies of federal pension law and not of bankruptcy law
in deciding whether to make companies liable for abandoned
plans.</p>
<p>LTV filed for reorganization in federal bankruptcy court
in 1986, partly because the three pension plans run for
employees of its LTV Steel Co. subsidiary were underfunded by
$2.3 billion, including $2.1 billion in benefits insured by
the agency.</p>
<p>In January 1987, as LTV Steel continued to operate while
in bankruptcy court, the agency terminated the three pension
plans to avoid continued underfunding. Agency insurance
assumed the liabilities for benefits owed under the plans.</p>
<p>A few months later, under pressure from the United
Steelworkers of America, LTV instituted a program to provide
retirement benefits similar to those in the terminated plans.
The agency, however, viewed the new plan as an abuse of
federal pension law and an attempt to transfer the liability
from LTV to federal insurance. In September 1987, the agency
ordered LTV to reassume liability and funding for the three
original plans.</p>
<p>LTV challenged the order, and a federal district court
ruled in June 1988 that the agency improperly ordered LTV to
reassume the plans' operations. In May 1989, a federal
appeals court in New York agreed that the agency exceeded its
legal authority.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Supreme Court reversed the appeals court
ruling. Justice John Stevens dissented.</p>
<p>The agency's Mr. Lockhart said LTV has suggested it may
try to terminate the three plans again, but the agency
doesn't think the steelmaker can do that legally. Moreover,
Mr. Lockhart said, "We're convinced that it has the viability
to afford these plans." The agency will continue to insure
the three plans in the event that problems arise, he said.</p>
<p>The pension agency said the ruling will benefit 60,000 LTV
retirees and 40,000 active workers. Agency officials said LTV
must assume liability both for the $2.1 billion and for
hundreds of millions of dollars more that hasn't been paid
since 1987.</p>
<p>In response to the Supreme Court decision, LTV issued only
a terse statement saying it will continue searching for a
solution that recognizes its inability to fund the plans. In
practical terms, that means negotiating with the agency to
seek partial funding.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the LTV spokesman said, the company could
terminate the plans again. Still, he said, LTV is taking the
position that negotiations will succeed and that the court
decision "is an unfortunate bend in the road, but it's only a
bend -- it's not a dead end."</p>
<p>LTV's creditors, meanwhile, took a less philosophical
view. The ruling means the agency's claims will take
precedence over theirs. "It comes as bad news for creditors,
that's for sure," said Larry Handelsman, an attorney for the
unsecured creditors' committee. Any funding of the pension
plans, he said, "comes directly from the pockets of the
creditors." (PBGC vs. LTV Corp.)</p>
