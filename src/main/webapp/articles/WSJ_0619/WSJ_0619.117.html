	<p class="article-leader">ARMONK N.Y. -- International Business Machines Corp. said
it developed a method that allows computers to recognize
overlapping handwritten letters, a step on the road toward
computers that understand script handwriting.
   Such machines, dubbed note-pad computers, are being touted
as the next big thing in computing, because they would allow
people who are intimidated by technology to write with a
penlike instrument on a computer screen, which can be an
easier way to communicate than typing strings of complicated
commands.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, lightweight, portable note-pad computers
would open up new applications -- inventory-taking, for
example, or use by salespeople, secretaries and journalists.</p>
<p>Several note-pad computers are already being marketed,
most notably by Tandy Corp.'s Grid Systems unit. But these
early stabs at handwriting recognition require users to print
clearly and to leave adequate spacing between letters. IBM
said its advance, which it presented at an industry
conference in Atlantic City, N.J., points the way toward
eliminating these restrictions.</p>
<p>"This is another nice step in a continual progression to
the point where a computer can recognize whatever you slap
down on its screen," said Vern Raburn, chairman of Slate
Corp., a Scottsdale, Ariz., company developing software for
note-pad computers.</p>
