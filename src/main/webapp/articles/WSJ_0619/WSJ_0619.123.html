	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors continued to back away from Treasury
bonds, which fell about 3/8 point, or $3.75 for each $1,000
face amount.
   Traders said the sell-off in Treasurys was a continuation
from Friday when bond prices fell sharply in reaction to
stronger-than-expected May industrial production data.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Investors are expecting the U.S. government to step up its
debt issuance this summer, and that's one reason why they're
turning cautious on the market, said Joseph Liro, economist
at S.G. Warburg & Co.</p>
<p>"For the third quarter, we're talking awesome numbers for
Treasury borrowing," said Mr. Liro. "Counting Resolution
Trust Corp., it looks like $65 to $70 billion for the third
quarter alone," he said. The RTC is the government agency
overseeing the bailout of the thrift industry.</p>
<p>Government demand for debt is growing due to expenses
associated with the savings and loan bailout, and to weak
corporate tax payments, Mr. Liro said. Next week, the first
signs of swelling U.S. debt offerings could be seen in the
Treasury market. Mr. Liro expects the Treasury to announce a
record $11 billion 2-year note offering, and $8.5 billion
4-year note offering. Mr. Liro also expects the Treasury's
weekly bill auctions to swell from about $17.2 currently to
$18 billion sometime later in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The thrift bailout has created new uncertainty about the
size of the government's credit demands, traders say.
Expectations of higher Treasury-bill issuance have narrowed a
traditional money market gauge known as the
Treasury-Eurodollar or TED spread.</p>
<p>Typically, Eurodollars, or dollar deposits in banks
abroad, trade at higher interest rates than Treasury bills
because they are viewed as less secure. But lately, the
spread between Eurodollars and Treasurys has narrowed as
investors have anticpated higher Treasury-bill rates to
accomodate larger federal borrowing.</p>
<p>The TED spread has narrowed to about 0.79 percentage point
recently from its usual spread of about 1.2 percentage points
to 1.5 percentage points, Mr. Liro notes. (The TED spread is
based on trading in futures contracts for both Treasury bills
and Eurodollars.)</p>
<p>What's ironic about the narrowing of this financial market
indicator is that usually it widens in times of financial
distress as investors flock to Treasury bills, commonly
viewed as the safest of all investments. A so-called flight
to quality in Treasury bills usually pushes their rates
lower.</p>
<p>Lately, credit market traders have marvelled at investor
complacency over the deteriorating credit quality of several
banks, corporations, and, of course, Donald Trump.</p>
<p>"Normally, you would expect to see people buy Treasury
bills because if Trump goes under it's an example of how
overextended people are," said Steven Kordas, assistant vice
president of proprietary trading at Carroll McEntee &
McGinley. "People are very complacent because the government
is bailing out everybody."</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>Overall, junk bonds, or speculative-grade securities with
low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all, ended the
session 1/4 to 3/8 point lower.</p>
<p>Among the notable losers were junk bonds of Trump Taj
Mahal Funding Inc. and related casino bonds issued by real
estate developer Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Trump Taj's 14% first-mortgage bonds, due in 1998, dropped
2 1/8 points to end at 51 7/8 on the American Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Trump Castle Funding Inc. 13.75% first-mortgage bonds, due
in 1997, shed 2 points to end at 53.</p>
<p>But junk bond traders said activity in Trump debt was
relatively light and calm. One reason might be is that
holders of bonds on which Mr. Trump has defaulted are at the
front of the creditors' line. Mr. Trump is in 10-day grace
period to meet interest payments on the bonds.</p>
<p>"If he defaults, we own it; we'll take over the
buildings," said Edward D'Alelio, managing director at Putnam
High Yield Funds, which owns some of the Trump Castle bonds.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, junk bonds of Trump Plaza Funding Inc.,
considered the crown jewel of the Trump empire, continued to
show strength.</p>
<p>Trump Plaza's 12 7/8% first-mortgage bonds, due in 1998,
ended at 83, up a couple points from Friday's closing level.
Trump Plaza is in the best financial shape of all Mr. Trump's
casinos, traders said. Investors, they added, are speculating
that Mr. Trump may be forced to sell Trump Plaza.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury securities fell slightly in light trading.</p>
<p>Analysts and traders attributed the selling to a continued
negative sentiment following Friday's bond market rout and
jitters about upcoming supply. The 30-year bond fell 13/32 to
103 2/32 compared with 103 15/32 Friday. The yield rose to
8.46% from 8.42% late Friday. Prices on the 10-year note fell
to 102 15/32, down from 102 23/32 on Friday. The yield on the
10-year rose to 8.48% from 8.45% Friday.</p>
<p>At the government's weekly Treasury bill auction, the
average discount rate for three-month bills was set at 7.74%,
while the average rate for six-month bills was set at 7.64%.
The rates were slightly higher to unchanged from last week's
auction when they were 7.73% and 7.64%, respectively.</p>
<p>Here are the details of yesterday's Treasury bill auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>

<p>Both issues are dated June 21. The 13-week bills mature

<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>British government bonds, or gilts, ended sharply lower on
a deterioration in the government's budget position and other
data suggesting building inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Among benchmarks, the Treasury's 11.75% issue due
2003/2007 was down one point at 101 5/8 to yield 11.51%. The
Treasury 12% bond due 1995 was off 14/32 at 99 5/8 to yield
12.11%.</p>
<p>French Treasurys finished slightly lower after a quiet
session.</p>
<p>The West German bond market was also quiet. The actively
traded 7.75% 10-year note due February 2000 was quoted at
92.70 to 92.85, down slightly from Friday's levels.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Lacking any impetus to move prices higher, tax-exempt
issues ended 1/8 to 1/4 point lower in sluggish dealings.</p>
<p>Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% securities of 2018 were off 1/8, at 98 1/4
to yield 7.33%.</p>
<p>Looking ahead on the municipal new-issue calendar, today
Minnesota will sell $200 million of general-obligation bonds
via competitive bid.</p>
<p>Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Prices of mortgage-backed securities ended with losses of
1/4 point or less, after barely moving from early levels as
participants brace for an influx of new supply.</p>
<p>Among actively traded mortgage securities issues,
Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities for
July delivery were down 7/32 at 99 2/32, while the 10%
securites were down 1/4 at 101 14/ 32.</p>
<p>Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities for July
delivery were off 5/32 at 98 11/32 and the 10% securities
were down 1/8 at 100 13/32.</p>
<p>Fannie Mae July 9.5% securities were 5/32 lower, and the
10% securities were lower by 1/8 at 100 29/32.</p>
