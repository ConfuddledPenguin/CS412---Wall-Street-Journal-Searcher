	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Integrated Resources Inc. said it agreed to
sell a unit that is the general partner of American Real
Estate Partners L.P. to a Sterik Co. affiliate for $40
million.
   The general partner, American Property Investors, owns
more than 10% of American Real Estate Partners, a publicly
traded master limited partnership. AREP manages a portfolio
of more than 320 real estate properties. Sterik, based in
Auburndale, Mass., and its affiliates own more than 180
properties with a fair market value of about $500 million.
Meshulam Riklis, a financier whose Rapid American Corp. has
interests in a variety of companies, is one of Sterik's
general partners.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale by Integrated, which is operating under Chapter
11 protection from creditors, is subject to Bankruptcy Court
approval. It is also subject to higher and better offers.</p>
<p>But the agreement to sell American Property Investors may
be complicated by a lawsuit filed last month by investors in
AREP seeking to prevent any sale of the partnership without
their approval.</p>
<p>The suit by Oppenheimer & Bigelow Income Fund I and Edge
Partners L.P., which hold a total of about 107,000 units in
AREP, is pending in Delaware state court. It also seeks a
unit-holder list from Integrated as a possible step in
converting the partnership to a real estate investment trust,
as well as access to the books and records of the
partnership.</p>
<p>Curtis Trinko, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said they
intend to "move forward to obtain court relief to block" the
sale to Sterik. Mr. Trinko said the investors are considering
asking the bankruptcy court to allow some kind of vote on the
sale by the AREP limited partners.</p>
<p>But Stephen D. Weinroth, Integrated chairman, said he had
been advised that the partnership agreements don't require
investor approval for the sale of the general partner. He
said he didn't think the suit would delay the sale.</p>
<p>Joseph Dempsey Jr., managing general partner of Sterik,
said the company would go ahead with the purchase "regardless
of the suit." Sterik has financing for the purchase.</p>
