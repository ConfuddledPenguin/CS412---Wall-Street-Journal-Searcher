	<p class="article-leader">The Airbus Industrie consortium said Turkish Airlines
ordered five Airbus A-340s and took options on five
additional aircraft in a bid to modernize its fleet.
   The first aircraft will be delivered in spring 1993.
Airbus doesn't disclose the value of contracts received, but
the most recently available listed price for the A-340 is
about $91 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Turkish Airlines also ordered CFM International engines,
valued at as much as $300 million, to power the Airbus
Industrie A-340 planes. CFM, based in Evendale, Ohio, is a
joint venture of Snecma, the Paris aircraft-engine
manufacturer, and General Electric Co., of Fairfield, Conn.</p>
<p>Airbus is a consortium of Aerospatiale of France,
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British
Aerospace PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.</p>
<p>Airbus said Turkish Airlines will use the new planes on
its nonstop service to the U.S. and Asia. The airline already
operates 13 A-340s.</p>
