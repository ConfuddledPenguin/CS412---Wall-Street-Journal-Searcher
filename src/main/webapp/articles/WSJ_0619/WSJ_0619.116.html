	<p class="article-leader">Foxboro Co. toughened its anti-takeover shareholder rights
plan less than a week after the company disclosed receiving
several takeover offers in response to its solicitation of
possible buyers.
   The toughening of the plan raised speculation that
Foxboro, a maker of industrial process controls, doesn't like
one or more of the suitors or offers it has in hand. The
company, based in Foxboro, Mass., hasn't named the suitors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Foxboro shares fell $1.25 to close at $34.875.</p>
<p>Under the amended plan, holders of Foxboro common would
get rights to purchase preferred shares at half the market
value after a party acquires 15% of Foxboro's common or after
a party deemed by Foxboro to be "adverse" acquires 10% of the
shares. Previously, holders could exercise the rights when
someone acquired 30% of Foxboro's shares.</p>
