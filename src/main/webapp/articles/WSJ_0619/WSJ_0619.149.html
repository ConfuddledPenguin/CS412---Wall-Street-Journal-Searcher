fourth-quarter loss of $22 million on sales of about $41
million.
   Results for the quarter ended March 31 include costs
associated with the Fremont, Calif., company's recently
completed sale of a 55% stake in its Asian operations to an
investment group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the year-earlier quarter, the disk-drive maker reported
a loss of $8.6 million on sales of $50.1 million.</p>
<p>Flextronics said the asset sale will result in
"significant net profit" for the current quarter after
accounting for a onetime after-tax gain of about $13 million.
It didn't estimate the profit.</p>
