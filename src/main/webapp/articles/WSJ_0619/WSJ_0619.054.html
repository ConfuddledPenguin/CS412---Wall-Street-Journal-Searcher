	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Sarah Hull battles traffic for an hour to reach
a run-down shopping center next to a Dairy Queen. Her
mission: to enlist a new warrior in the fight for a lower
capital-gains tax.
   Ms. Hull, 28 years old, is a Washington-based operative
for the National Venture Capital Association. Her quarry this
day is a balding businessman named Reese Terry Jr. whose
small company, Cyberonics Inc., is housed in a tiny
storefront here. Stepping out of the scorching heat, Ms. Hull
wanders back to Mr. Terry's cramped office and hands him a
black folder filled with documents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We are conducting a grass-roots campaign to lower the
capital-gains tax," she tells him. "Texas is important."</p>
<p>Back in Washington, a constituent's word is said to be
worth that of five lobbyists. But on this issue, it may be
worth 15. Few tax changes are harder to sell at the
grass-roots level than a capital-gains cut, since the direct
benefits would overwhelmingly go to the richest Americans.
According to congressional tax experts, about two-thirds of
the benefits would go to the 1.3% of taxpayers with incomes
of $200,000 or more a year, and about 83% of the benefits
would go to the approximately 5% of taxpayers who have
incomes of $100,000 a year or more.</p>
<p>That makes Ms. Hull's job especially challenging and, for
her employers, particularly important. Over the past year,
the Arlington, Va.-based National Venture Capital Association
has spent a quarter of a million dollars on the grass-roots
effort. Since February, Ms. Hull and an associate at the
public-relations firm of Robinson, Lake, Lerer & Montgomery
have scoured a dozen states to find and train homespun
capital-gains advocates like Mr. Terry.</p>
<p>Their prime targets are, like him, founders of young,
fast-growing companies who have struggled to scrape together
enough capital to make a go of it, and for whom a lower
capital-gains tax could be translated into the creation of
more jobs. From a politician's viewpoint, this is a
relatively compelling story -- more compelling, at least,
than self-interested pleas from the money men who pay Ms.
Hull to push for a capital-gains cut.</p>
<p>"It sure as hell beats running up to the halls {of
Congress} and squeezing arms and throwing fat checks at
them," contends Daniel Kingsley, executive director of the
venture capital association. The group says it has pieced
together a network of about 250 entrepreneurs, and intends to
use them, as the need arises, to send letters to Washington,
to write opinion pieces for local newspapers, and to meet
with key lawmakers when they return to their districts.</p>
<p>"We are trying to put a face on the issue," Ms. Hull
explains.</p>
<p>Her efforts already have paid off. On March 20 she mailed
an urgent request to her recruits to write to Chairman Dan
Rostenkowski of the House Ways and Means Committee. A model
letter she enclosed asserted that without a capital-gains cut
"the entrepreneurial engine driving our economy won't just
stall; it'll be running on empty." In response, business
executives from Connecticut to California used the identical
phrase in letters to the Illinois Democrat.</p>
<p>President Bush has made cutting the capital-gains tax a
priority. But the Ways and Means Committee, which originates
tax legislation, probably won't consider the change until
congressional leaders and the White House agree on a broad
deficit-reduction plan in budget talks currently under way.</p>
<p>Here in Houston, meanwhile, Ms. Hull meets with success in
rounding up future capital-gains proselytizers from among the
business executives she meets. Mr. Terry readily agrees to
help. So does James Pritchett, president of Trinity Computer
Systems Inc., a maker of computer software for hospitals. "Be
happy to," he says over coffee in his conference room when
she asks him if he would visit a local newspaper's editorial
board.</p>
<p>Ms. Hull also encourages Mr. Pritchett to help lobby the
main focus of her trip here, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas),
chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee. "We
want to get a letter to Bentsen from you," she says, bluntly.
She also wants the executive to meet with the senator.
"That's something down the road we might want to organize,"
she says.</p>
<p>"Any encouragement you can give will be helpful," she
adds. "It's much more convincing when it comes from a
business person in the district."</p>
<p>In the course of the trip, Ms. Hull does meet with some
venture capitalists, but mostly she is referred to hands-on
managers who are more politically persuasive. She lunches at
the wood-paneled Century Club on the top floor of the First
Interstate Bank building here with David Hull, a principal of
Criterion Investments Inc. A natty venture capitalist in
pinstripes, Mr. Hull (who is no relation to Ms. Hull)
suggests she visit the MIT Forum, in which start-up companies
present their business plans for critique. "That's an
audience that's easy to sell," he counsels.</p>
<p>"It's much more effective to push {the lobbying effort to
cut the capital-gains tax} down to the entrepreneurial
level," Mr. Hull suggests. "Then you can equate it to jobs."</p>
<p>Ms. Hull endeavors to make it as easy as possible for the
entrepreneurs to lobby. The documents in the folder that she
provides them constitute a complete modern-day lobbying kit.
They include a sample letter to lawmakers that argues for a
lower capital-gains tax, with a place to "insert your own
story about your company." Another document lists "talking
points" that the executives can use to make the case for
capital gains, including this debatable statement: "Lower
taxes on capital gains will offer all Americans the benefits
of a productive and more competitive economy."</p>
<p>The kit -- and Ms. Hull in person -- suggests that the
business executives can write an editorial for the local
newspaper advocating lower capital-gains taxes. Samples of
such articles written by other business executives are
included. Ms. Hull tells the executives that they needn't
worry too much about the wording, though, because she can
give them plenty of help; her company in Washington has three
ghostwriters on its staff for the purpose.</p>
<p>Not everyone thinks that manufactured sentiment of the
kind Ms. Hull fosters is particularly effective -- including
some of the lawmakers she hopes to influence. "It takes the
spontaneity out of the process, and that is one of the things
that has the biggest impact," complains Democratic Rep.
Michael Andrews of Houston, one of the lawmakers Ms. Hull
mentions as wanting to reach.</p>
<p>Sen. Bentsen also doubts that he will be swayed. "You can
very quickly determine the difference between grass roots and
Astroturf," he says. "It surely doesn't have the same
impact."</p>
<p>Neither lawmaker, though, needs much persuading. Sen.
Bentsen has been working with the Bush administration to
develop a package of investment incentives that is likely to
include a capital-gains cut. And Rep. Andrews is one of the
six Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee who
unswervingly support the tax change. Earlier this year, Ms.
Hull's venture capital association even presented him an
award, which is in the shape of a golden egg.</p>
<p>For this very reason, one of the executives Ms. Hull
visits, Stuart Schube of Acorn Ventures Inc., says he
probably won't write letters about capital gains to his local
lawmakers. "The bulk of the congressmen and senators in Texas
already understand it," he tells her. "You really ought to
check."</p>
