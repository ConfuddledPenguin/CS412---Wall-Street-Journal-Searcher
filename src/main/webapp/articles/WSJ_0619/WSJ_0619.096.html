	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- A manager for a now-defunct aerospace parts
supplier, McHaffie Inc., was sentenced to 20 weekends in
prison and three years' probation for his role in a scheme to
falsify test results on millions of nuts and bolts that are
supposed to hold together aircraft engines.
   Two co-workers, however, had their sentencing postponed.
That's so U.S. District Judge Wallace Tashima would have more
time to sort out who was responsible for starting the 10-year
scam, which prosecutors described yesterday as the
longest-running defense procurement fraud ever uncovered. All
three men and the company pleaded guilty in April.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The man sentenced, 37-year-old William Whitham, formerly
the shop-floor manager at Sylmar, Calif.-based McHaffie, was
"the least culpable" of the defendants, according to Stephen
Mansfield, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case.</p>
<p>Sentencing for the company's president, Norman McHaffie,
and quality-control supervisor James Hicks was delayed until
July 2; each, Mr. Mansfield said, is trying to blame the
other for initiating the crime.</p>
<p>Mr. McHaffie faces as long as 15 years in prison and a
$750,000 fine, while Mr. Hicks could be sentenced to up to 10
years in prison and fined $500,000. The company faces a
maximum penalty of $1.5 million.</p>
