	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices finished lower in thin dealings as lack
of any fresh news kept investors off the trading floor.
   Meanwhile, London stock prices finished near intraday
minimums in dull trading, after a slow start and a poor early
showing on Wall Street.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Tokyo, after closing the morning session with a
moderate gain, the Nikkei Index sagged toward the end of the
day on a few rounds of minor selling by arbitragers, traders
said. The Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 161.60 points,
closing at 32376.80.</p>
<p>"There was no incentive at all to trade," said Masami
Okuma, a senior trader at UBS Phillips & Drew International.
"All kinds of investors fully remained on the sidelines," he
said.</p>
<p>While the first section lacked the energy to boost
large-capital shares, investors, including institutions,
continued to hunt for high-priced, small-capital shares with
bright earnings prospects, traders said, pushing up stocks on
the second section as well as those on the Osaka and Nagoya
stock exchanges.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index fell
318.56 points to 32058.24.</p>
<p>On Monday, an estimated 300 million shares changed hands
on the first section, down from 460.3 million shares Friday.
Decliners outnumbered advancers 632-300, while 190 issues
were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section dropped 15.29 points, or 0.64%, to 2381.03.</p>
<p>The second section index gained 24.99 points, or 0.60%, to
4178.59. Volume in the section was estimated at 36 million
shares, in line with 35.3 million shares Friday.</p>
<p>Trading volume on the first section has been constantly
thinning, from more than one billion stocks traded May 28 to
yesterday's 300 million shares.</p>
<p>"Basically it's all because of {domestic} interest rates,"
which haven't shown a sign of declining, said an official at
Yamaichi Securities.</p>
<p>To many participants' disappointment, U.S. economic
indicators disclosed Friday didn't help to provide any hint
for direction of either U.S. interest rates or the dollar,
traders said.</p>
<p>Another set of U.S. indicators is due later this week,
including final first-quarter gross national product data on
Thursday, but those reports are unlikely to be of much help
in giving the currency market any direction, traders said. As
a result, participants expect institutional investors to
continue to hold off from active trading ahead of German
monetary union, now two weeks away, the traders said.</p>
<p>A few sectors that received what little buying there was
yesterday were pharmaceutical and environment
protection-related stocks.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals gained ahead of the annual conference of
the cancer academy beginning July 3.</p>
<p>Yoshihiro Nomura, an phamaceutical industrial analyst at
Nomura Research Institute, said the market is moving on
expectations of some new products and testing results
scheduled to be introduced at the conference.</p>
<p>However, none of the products or results are at a stage to
make sales or profitability forecasts, the analyst said.</p>
<p>Dainippon Pharmaceutical, which advanced strongly this
past week on the potential earnings prospects of the
company's anti-cancer agent continued to be bought yesterday.
But active profit-taking in the afternoon pushed the stock
down from its intraday high of 3460 yen ($22.47) to close at
3240 yen, up 30 yen from Friday's close.</p>
<p>Also heavily traded was Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, which
added 10 yen to 3040 yen, down from an intraday high of 3110
yen. Mochida rose 50 yen to 4000 yen, while Taisho gained 40
yen to 2390 yen.</p>
<p>Chiyoda Corp., which holds a strong market share in
anti-air pollution equipment, gained 80 yen to 2660 yen. Toyo
Seikan Kaisha advanced 240 yen to 4120 yen on the strong
earning prospects for its beverage cans with safety fliptops.</p>
<p>London shares were marked down early in the session, as
the beginning of the week, a lack of major corporate news,
and the upcoming Royal Ascot race meeting kept fresh interest
at a minimum.</p>
<p>Later in the session, London stocks continued to be
pressured by a drop on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Furthermore, market professionals suggested that
institutional equity investors were beginning to assess the
negative influence that may arise from membership in the
exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System,
after last week's euphoria over the beneficial consequences
of entry.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index fell
21.8 points to 2370.5, slightly better than the intraday
minimum of 2367.4. The index reached a high of 2394.5 near
the start of trading.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index dropped 14 points to
1911.9. Volume was a mild 403.4 million shares after
inclusion of a 120 million-share program trade of second-line
stocks, little changed from Friday's 400.2 million shares.</p>
<p>Among issues, BAA, the airports management concern, rose 7
pence to 423 pence (12 cents to $7.23) after announcing a 29%
rise in pretax profit for the year and the appointment of
Jaguar's chairman, John Egan, as the company's new chief
executive.</p>
<p>Dealers said the banking sector was generally weaker
following news and speculation about banks' exposure to the
troubled British & Commonwealth Holdings.</p>
<p>Barclays, which said it has made a #100 million provision
against exposure to the financial services concern, fell 6
pence to 387 pence, Midland dropped 3 pence to 297 pence, and
National Westminster Bank shed 9 pence to 334 pence. Lloyds,
which has said it is selling its business interest in
Portugal to Banco Bilbao de Vizcaya, fell 2 pence to 287
pence.</p>
<p>There were also worries in the banking sector that some
U.K. banks might be exposed to losses stemming from loans to
Donald Trump, dealers said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Reuters declined 13 pence to #12.81 on
profit-taking, after the stock advanced 7.6% this past week,
dealers said. Additionally, along with the American Stock
Exchange, the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the
Cincinnati Stock Exchange, the British company announced a
definitive agreement to develop a world-wide after-hours
electronic system to trade listed equities, equity options
and other products.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prices closed higher in Frankfurt; lower in
Paris, Amsterdam, Zurich and Madrid; mixed in Brussels and
Stockholm; and unchanged in Milan. South African gold stocks
closed marginally higher.</p>
<p>Also, stocks closed lower in Seoul, mixed in Wellington,
and higher in Singapore, Sydney, Taipei and Manila. Hong Kong
was closed.</p>
