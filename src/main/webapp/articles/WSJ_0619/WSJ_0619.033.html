	<p class="article-leader">It was with sadness that I read your "Chilling Tale" (page
one, May 7) about GE's disaster with the rotary compressor.
It's tragic that such a valiant effort to upgrade
manufacturing in the U.S. failed because of a layered
corporate structure that told the boss what he wanted to
hear.
   It also is astounding to learn that GE was the inventor of
the rotary compressor for appliances and in 1986 "designed a
revolutionary rotary compressor for refrigerators." When I
joined Frigidaire in 1955, it had been using the rotary
compressor exclusively in its "Fridges" for many, many years.
In 1967 we brought the new RI compressor into production
without a hiccup. This new unit had many technological
advances.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In those days, as today, it was customary for appliance
manufacturers to exchange factory visits. These exchanges of
ideas and technology have been a significant factor in
keeping America the world leader in major-appliance
manufacturing. Where else can you buy a 21-cubic-foot Frost
Proof Fridge for $687 when the first 1957 15-cubic-foot
models sold for $700?</p>

<p>Thank you for the fine article on General Electric. Having
worked in both the refrigeration department and the corporate
manufacturing staff of GE, I can say you caught the flavor of
GE's operating style: Act as if there are no problems and do
not, above all, give the boss any bad news.</p>
<p>This fiasco is, I am told by many GE graduates, a repeat
of a very similar problem in the early 1950s. The parts of
the compressor were different but the results were the same.
Sometimes we Americans are so busy shooting ourselves in the
foot that we don't have enough time for Japan-bashing.</p>

<p>We were surprised to read that in December 1987, Tecumseh
Products Co. "had quit" the domestic refrigeration-compressor
business. GE must have been equally surprised by this
statement as we were an on-line supplier of compressors to
its Decatur, Ala., plant at that time.</p>
<p>Throughout our history, the G.E. Motor Group has been a
key vendor to Tecumseh Products and continues to supply us
with motors for all types of compressors. Tecumseh is alive,
well and working hard to satisfy industry demand for
energy-efficient compressors.</p>

<p>The GE refrigerator-compressor fiasco is a symptom of Jack
Welch's management style. In the 27 years I worked at GE and
at the countless technical meetings I attended, there was no
mention of Reginald Jones or Ralph Cordiner when they were
GE's CEOs. Decisions were made on technical and economic
merits. Mr. Welch's name and his "vision" now predominate
meetings, as if he were the guru of turbine-generators. No
wonder the Louisville management did not have the courage to
confront Mr. Welch with any negative news.</p>
<p>Mr. Welch's 1987 vision for Schenectady's
turbine-generator business was emphasis on customer service
while concurrently nuking the Turbine Technology Laboratory
and hundreds of experienced engineers. These were the
engineers and scientists who provided the product
reliability, engineering, quality control, research and
development, manufacturing support and true customer-service
support to the business. We are now working feverishly to
contain the damage caused by Mr. Welch's actions because no
manager had the courage to tell him that his vision for the
business was flawed.</p>

<p>Powder metal is not a new material as you implied. Powder
metallurgy (P/M) parts have been used in appliances and
automobiles for more than 50 years. The average passenger car
contains about 21 pounds of P/M parts in critical
applications in the automatic transmission and engine, a
four-wheel-drive light truck about 30 pounds. Powder
metallurgy is probably one of the fastest-growing sectors
within the world-wide metalworking industry, because of
unique parts properties and production efficiencies.</p>
<p>Our investigation of the circumstances surrounding the
design of the new compressor leads us to believe that the
real culprit was an unfortunate overall design and inadequate
field testing. We also have learned that the lubricant failed
at a low temperature, causing subsequent part failures. To
the best of our knowledge, the same compressor, used in air
conditioners, currently contains two powder metallurgy parts
that are performing without any problems.</p>
<p>In the design and manufacture of any product, the proper
selection, specifying and testing of any material are
critical. In this particular application, an incorrect P/ M
material in combination with the wrong lubricant seems to
have caused the failure.</p>
