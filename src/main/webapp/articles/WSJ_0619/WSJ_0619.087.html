has applied for membership in the IMF.
   The southwest African country, which is an important
producer of diamonds, also has applied for membership in the
World Bank, according to officials of that international
agency.</p>

membership from Switzerland, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. The
applications may be formally approved this year.</p>
