	<p class="article-leader">PROTESTS FLARED in Romania, and police were authorized to
stop them.
   The newly elected lower house of Parliament voted to allow
the police and army to move against anti-government
demonstrators who retook a Bucharest square after being
brutally routed by police last week. Meanwhile, opposition
legislators demanded the government investigate events that
led President-elect Iliescu to summon thousands of miners to
crush last week's protests. Hundreds gathered for a second
day in University Square to seek the ouster of Iliescu, whose
inauguration has been delayed until later this week because
of the turmoil.</p>

<p>A GUNMAN KILLED eight people in a rampage at an auto loan
office in Florida.</p>
<p>The man stalked through the company in Jacksonville,
firing at customers and shooting under desks at hiding
employees before killing himself. Five others were listed in
critical but stable condition after the latemorning shooting
at a General Motors Acceptance Corp. office. The gunman,
identified as James Edward Pough, 42, recently had a vehicle
repossessed by GMAC, according to Jacksonville's sheriff.
Pough mainly used a semi-automatic rifle, but he also carried
a revolver, officials said.</p>
<p>Local authorities said the gunman had killed a man and a
woman in separate shootings early Sunday on the streets near
his Jacksonville home.</p>

<p>Mandela told Canada's Parliament that the struggle of
black South Africans for liberty and equality can't be

nationalist leader intends to travel to New York City
tomorrow.</p>

<p>Administration officials plan to recommend a veto of
legislation to overhaul federal housing programs, partly

National Affordable Housing Act.</p>

<p>Militant Kashmiris declared a government-in-exile to
advance their Moslem secessionist movement in the disputed
northern region between India and Pakistan. The move
complicates already tense relations between the two
countries, which earlier in the day agreed to hold
negotiations aimed at easing the threat of war over Kashmir.</p>

<p>The PLO opened an inquiry into the May 30 Palestinian
guerrilla raid on two Israeli beaches. The inquiry's aim,
according to the head of the organization's security service,
is to find out if civilians were targeted. The U.S. has
threatened to suspend talks with the PLO unless the group
condemns the raid and takes disciplinary steps.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court ruled that police may ask suspected
drunken drivers most routine questions and videotape answers
without warning them of their rights. The 8-1 ruling in a
Pennsylvania case means slurred answers about age, height and
weight may be used to convict drivers who haven't been given
the so-called Miranda warning.</p>

<p>Genscher and Shevardnadze met in Muenster, West Germany,

<p>U.S. safety officials said they believe the fan-disk
fatigue crack that led to the crash of a United Airlines jet
in Iowa was "of a detectable size" at the time of a major

Transportation Safety Board called on the FAA to develop
improved methods for detecting cracks.</p>

<p>A fuel oil barge ran aground in Buzzards Bay off Cape Cod,
Mass., within one mile of the site where the cruise ship the

by a tugboat and was carrying more than five million gallons
of heating oil, officials said.</p>

<p>Central American presidents welcomed a proposal from Baker

<p>Sri Lanka declared an all-out offensive on Tamil
separatist guerrillas. The government left the door open for
talks, but the insurgents pledged to fight. The deputy

had been killed since June 11. Unofficial estimates had put
the overall death toll, including civilians, at more than
450.</p>

<p>The Angolan rebel movement said it was suspending peace
talks with the Angolan government until it had cleared up

along with his senior aides.</p>

<p>Liberia's Doe offered amnesty to rebels poised to
overthrow his government, but the insurgents rejected the
offer. The president said an amnesty would allow the
guerrillas to form an opposition party in the West African
nation. Rebel insistence that Doe must quit was the main
stumbling block during peace talks last week in Sierra Leone.</p>
