	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Express Co. and the Dance Theater of
Harlem announced a four-year partnership to help the
world-renowned but financially struggling dance company with
a $1 million grant and card-holder promotions.
   The dance company and American Express Travel Related
Services Co., a unit of American Express, said they plan to
jointly market the company's performances to American Express
gold card holders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After the unexpected cancellation of some European
engagements last fall, the company was forced to cancel its
winter season here and lay off its dancers for six months to
cope with a $1.7 million operating deficit. With the new
support, the company plans to resume operations on Oct. 1,
with a possible tour to Cairo this fall.</p>
<p>To aid the company's expensive touring effort, American
Express said it will help find supporters for the Dance
Theater wherever it goes. "To obtain local sponsors is very
very important," an American Express spokesman said. "We will
be able to do it for them on a global basis."</p>
<p>Last week DTH also received a $1 million emergency grant
from the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund. The grant is in
two parts, with $600,000 earmarked to reduce debts and
$400,000 for dancer salaries and operations. Last year DTH's
total payroll was $3.3 million for a staff of 140.</p>
