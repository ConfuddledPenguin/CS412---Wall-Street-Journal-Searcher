	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Prudential-Bache Securities Canada Ltd. said it
agreed to sell its retail brokerage business to Burns Fry
Ltd., becoming the second U.S.-owned investment dealer this
year to retreat from the Canadian securities market.
   The Canadian unit of Prudential Insurance Co. of America
said it expects to shift most of its other Canadian
operations, including its corporate finance, institutional
sales and capital markets divisions, to New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Forecasts showed us that the retail business {in Canada}
will not become robust until at least this time next year,"
said George McGough, president and chief executive of
Prudential-Bache Canada. Terms of the sale to Burns Fry
weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>In the three years that Prudential-Bache Canada has
operated as a full-service broker, it hasn't reported a
profit. Exact losses haven't been disclosed but a company
executive said that even if retail activity picked up next
year, it would take until the end of 1992 for the company to
make "a real profit."</p>
<p>Mr. McGough said no decisions have been made on the future
of the Canadian unit, which will retain only about 35 of its
700 employees.</p>
<p>About 400 of the employees will be offered positions with
Burns Fry, all of them retail brokers and support staff.
About 200 others will be laid off. Burns Fry executives said
they will interview some Prudential-Bache Canada traders and
research analysts for other positions.</p>
<p>In January, Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., then the largest
U.S. investment dealer in Canada, agreed to sell its retail
brokerage operations to Toronto-based Wood Gundy Inc. for an
undisclosed sum, citing the closer links between banks and
brokerage firms as a reason for their move.</p>
<p>Prudential-Bache Canada executives didn't liken their
decision to that of Merrill Lynch Canada, a unit of Merrill
Lynch & Co. "This was a purely business move," Mr. McGough
said.</p>
<p>Canada's retail brokerage business still hasn't recovered
from the 1987 stock market crash. Only one-third of Toronto
Stock Exchange member firms reported profits for the first
quarter of 1990, the exchange said last week.</p>
<p>Michael Fusco, president of Dean Witter Reynolds Canada
Inc., now the only U.S. securities firm offering retail
services in Canada, said he sees Canada as continuing to
offer many opportunities for companies with a clear strategic
focus.</p>
<p>"We're purely and simply a retail firm, with only a small
involvement in capital markets and other areas," Mr. Fusco
said. He declined to say whether Dean Witter Canada, which
also has reported losses, will show a profit this year. But
he said the firm's results to date are "on plan." Dean Witter
is a unit of Sears Roebuck & Co.</p>
<p>Burns Fry executives said they aren't worried about the
effects of the current slump on retail brokers. "In five to
10 years, there is no area of the industry that should grow
faster than individual-client services," said Terry Cooper,
executive vice president of the Toronto-based investment
dealer.</p>
<p>The Prudential-Bache transaction will put Burns Fry, which
is 30%-owned by Security Pacific Corp. of Seattle, into the
ranks of Canada's largest retail investment dealers. Burns
Fry said it will have at least 1,900 employees, including 500
retail brokers, following the acquisition of Prudential-Bache
Canada's operations.</p>
<p>In New York, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. Chairman
George Ball told employees in an internal memo that the
firm's revenue, based on first-quarter results, project to
$1.27 billion for 1990, 11% above 1989 revenue of $1.14
billion, when the firm sustained a net loss of about $51
million.</p>
<p>Revenues are rising partly because of an influx of brokers
after Prudential-Bache's takeover of Thomson McKinnon
Securities Inc.'s brokerage network last summer. However,
revenue per broker is down from $223,986 last year to a pace
of $202,232 for 1990, apparently reflecting lower production
from the McKinnon brokers, the memo states.</p>
