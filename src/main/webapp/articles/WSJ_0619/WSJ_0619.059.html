	<p class="article-leader">BELLEFONTE, Pa. -- In the converted red-brick armory here
that Trinity Investment Management Corp. calls its "money
factory," the stock-pickers seem to be losing their knack.
   The pickers, in this case, are computers. For years the
machines have done a marvelous job, crunching through reams
of data on 400 mostly large companies to pinpoint the 75 or
so stocks that find their way into the $4.9 billion of
portfolios Trinity manages. But now, the firm's performance
is weakening, a few clients are leaving, and the human money
managers are trying to explain what went wrong.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Trinity was one of the first money managers to rely almost
exclusively on computer models rather than portfolio managers
to make investment decisions. High-tech equipment handles
most of the task for Trinity's 110 clients, a diverse group
that runs the gamut from Texaco Inc. to the St. Louis-based
Daughters of Charity.</p>
<p>Since it began managing money in 1981, Trinity has
outpaced the overall stock market by an average of about two
percentage points annually, climbing to the top ranks of U.S.
investment advisers. But Trinity's money factory faltered
badly this past year. The same computer-generated,
"quantitative" investment techniques that had often beaten
the market in the past produced a gain of 13.4%, less than
half the 31.7% rise of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.</p>
<p>What went wrong? The computers did the job they were
supposed to do, but they were following an investment thesis
that fell out of favor in the market. What the computers were
programmed to buy was the kind of stocks that had been
winners in the past: stocks with high dividend yields trading
at low multiples of corporate earnings.</p>
<p>About 11 percentage points of last year's 18-point lag
behind the S&P 500 can be attributed to the value style of
investing programmed into Trinity's computers, the firm says.
And so Trinity, far from being inoculated against failure by
its highly statistical approach, got hurt just like more
traditional "value" investors including John Neff, who runs
the $8 billion Windsor Fund.</p>
<p>"What we do is no different than what John Neff does, but
we can do it faster and more accurately," says 69-year-old
Stanford Calderwood, Trinity's chief executive officer. Mr.
Calderwood -- who turned to investment management in the
early 1970s after working as a newspaperman, a Polaroid Corp.
marketing chief, and a rainmaker for public television's
"Masterpiece Theatre" -- seems stoic about Trinity's 1989
results. "Statistically," he says, "we shouldn't catch
another 1989 for another 20 years."</p>
<p>Yet Trinity for the first time has been losing clients
because of its investment results. Six left the firm in the
first quarter on performance grounds; three more departed for
unrelated reasons. Three new clients joined in the quarter
and one loyal client recently added $40 million to its
account. Even so, Trinity had $500 million less in client
money at the end of the first quarter than a year earlier.
And more recently Exxon Corp., which won't comment, pulled a
large account from Trinity, investment professionals say.</p>
<p>Trinity still has an impressive client list. "From our
standpoint, the bad performance in one year is not enough to
want to make a change," says George Keane, president of
Fairfield, Conn.-based Common Fund, which picks money
managers for hundreds of college endowments. "I've had some
discussions with Stan {Calderwood}, and I know it has been
very distressing to him to be so much out of step with the
market."</p>
<p>Trinity says it continues to put full faith in its
computer models. "If the model tells you to buy it, you buy
it, and if the model tells you to sell it, you sell it, so
you don't get hung up on individual stocks," says Mr.
Calderwood.</p>
<p>He and his partner, Eric Levin, built Trinity around that
philosophy. After becoming an expert typist as a Navy
cryptographer in World War II, Mr. Calderwood worked as a
reporter for the Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader and United
Press International. In 1953, he joined Polaroid, moving up
to oversee its marketing and advertising. He lacked the
scientific credentials to rise higher and quit in 1970. Next
he served briefly as president of Boston's public television
station WGBH, where he made "Masterpiece Theatre" a
programming fixture and, after striking out with perhaps 20
companies, persuaded Mobil Corp. to pay for the series.</p>
<p>Mr. Calderwood then entered investment management with a
firm whose clients included the Yale University endowment.
Mr. Calderwood, intrigued by the as yet untapped potential of
computers to sort through stocks, met Mr. Levin, then a
Pennsylvania State University doctoral student who had
designed a model to scan company earnings looking for
undervalued stocks. Mr. Calderwood became majority owner of
Trinity, Mr. Levin's fledgling company, with the idea of
selling their investment research to others. But when a
British investor asked Trinity to put its theories into
practice, the firm began managing money itself.</p>
<p>Mr. Calderwood, rarely seen without a bow tie, is the
firm's Mr. Outside, dealing with clients from his Boston
office and writing extensively on investment topics. The
39-year-old Mr. Levin, who favors blue jeans and cowboy
boots, set up the money factory 11 miles from the Penn State
campus, where he serves as Mr. Inside overseeing the
investment operation.</p>
<p>"Stan was what was needed to take Eric from a researcher
to a money manager," says Kenneth G. Mertz II, chief
investment officer of Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement
System, Trinity's largest client with about $300 million
invested with the firm. As for the firm's investment style,
Mr. Mertz says, "One of their problems is that they are
extemely early in their valuations."</p>
<p>For example, Trinity was hurt in 1989 by its holdings of
retail and office equipment stocks in the fourth quarter, but
both groups rebounded in the first quarter. Mr. Mertz notes
that Trinity's style causes its portfolio to be volatile,
with big performance swings above and below market averages.
So although the firm lagged in 1989, Trinity topped the S&P
500 by 10 percentage points in 1988.</p>
<p>Trying to cater to clients worried about such swings,
Trinity says it will offer an alternative portfolio strategy
that should smooth year-to-year results. A third of Trinity's
clients eventually may switch to the less-volatile strategy,
Mr. Calderwood predicts.</p>
<p>But while the portfolio mix might change, the investment
decisions will still be driven by the iron logic of computers
and not by the emotions of humans. "Everybody wants to
believe there is an investment genius, that there is some art
form to it," says Mr. Calderwood. "I don't believe it."</p>
