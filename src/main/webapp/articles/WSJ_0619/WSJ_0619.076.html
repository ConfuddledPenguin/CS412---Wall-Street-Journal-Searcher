	<p class="article-leader">MARBLE HALL, South Africa -- It is a typical winter's day
in the cotton fields of South Africa: Sunny. Warm.
Apocalyptic.
   Over at the home of Neville Mallinson, who owns 37 Bibles
and a Shell service station, talk of Armageddon fills the
living room air. The host offers a pot of tea and commences
to recite the cataclysmic prophecies in the Book of
Revelation, from memory, as if they were the multiplication
tables. Black majority rule, he concludes, is the evil coming
to devour white South Africa. "If they {the blacks} kill each
other over a papaw or banana," he says, "then what will be
left of us?"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A few blocks away, Stefanie van den Heever pours pineapple
wine while her husband, Chris, plots the preservation of
white civilization in Africa. A bust of Cicero looks on from
the parlor. "We have fought and paid in blood for our
fatherland," Mr. van den Heever says. "We won't give up the
land of our birth. Never."</p>
<p>At the Amarula Restaurant, the only diner in town, mayor
and cotton farmer Willie Scheepers attacks his double rump
steak and relates the lesson of Piet Retief, a distant
relative on his mother's side. Mr. Retief and his band of
Afrikaner pioneers were massacred by the Zulus during peace
talks with Dingane, the Zulu king, in 1838. As a gesture of
good faith, the Afrikaners had left their weapons behind.</p>
<p>"That won't happen again," assures the mayor. He plops his
wife's purse on the table and pulls out a pistol. "She knows
how to use my R-1, too," he says. The R-1 is a standard South
African army rifle.</p>
<p>Fear and loathing stalk South Africa's conservative
heartland these days. The whirlwind of change that has swept
the country in the past few months has inflamed the passions
of the white right. Pride. Prejudice. Defiance. Desperation.
First came the unbanning of the African National Congress,
then the release of ANC leader Nelson Mandela, then the
beginning of power-sharing talks with the blacks. Now, Mr.
Mandela is triumphantly circling the world, arriving in New
York tomorrow to a ticker-tape parade. As the walls close in
on white-minority rule and the cozy privileges of apartheid,
right-wing emotions, so raw and intense, threaten the "new"
South Africa with a level of racial violence unknown even in
the old one.</p>
<p>From the wheat fields of the western Transvaal comes the
crackle of guns at a practice session of the Boere Commando,
a group of white vigilantes who would rather go down shooting
than submit to the black majority. From the mining towns of
the Orange Free State come the thundering threats of a "holy
war" by the Afrikaner Resistance Movement. From the
Vortrekker Monument in Pretoria, the sacred shrine of
Afrikanerdom, comes the pounding of 100,000 feet stomping
defiantly at a mass rally called by the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party. A banner held aloft at the gathering
proclaims, "White nationhood is greater than death." From all
across the "platteland" comes the rebellious message: Stop
the reforms, or else.</p>
<p>President F.W. de Klerk, who began the reforms when he
took over the leadership of the ruling National Party last
year, dismisses threats of resistance and revolt as
"irresponsible, undemocratic and dangerous" and vows not to
be deterred. Yet alarm is spreading through government at the
virulence of the white backlash to Mr. de Klerk's dismantling
of apartheid, the system of racial segregation that his party
created and that he once resolutely defended. Even the ANC,
which has been waging a guerrilla war against white rule for
30 years, recoils at the depth of right-wing emotions. Since
its unbanning, the ANC has been trying to reach out to
whites, including some of the more conservative
organizations, telling them that they have nothing to fear
from majority rule. Mr. Mandela encourages whites to support
Mr. de Klerk's reforms.</p>
<p>But, says Thabo Mbeki, the ANC's director of foreign
affairs, "Some whites believe they have a divine mission to
destroy the ANC. . . . The closer we get to change in South
Africa, one presumes, the more desperate they will become."</p>
<p>Yet Mr. de Klerk, himself an Afrikaner, is reluctant to
order a crackdown, fearing that such a move, such as
disarming radical right-wingers, could spark a tribal war
among the whites, setting Afrikaner against Afrikaner. For
the right wing is no mere lunatic fringe, but a significant
slice of the white population -- farmers, miners, factory
foremen, civil servants, policemen, soldiers. For 42 years,
apartheid has been their security blanket. Today, they defy
anyone to take it away.</p>
<p>"They are our burden, for we have made them what they
are," says Beyers Naude, who has been trying to convert his
fellow whites for the past four decades, first as a maverick
minister in the Dutch Reformed Church and now as a member of
the ANC's negotiating team. "The ideology of apartheid has
been ingrained so deeply, in their outlook, actions and
entire beings. We just can't drop them now. The entire white
community has a responsibility to convince them of their
foolishness."</p>
<p>The elderly preacher sighs. "It is a tedious process," he
says. "But the only alternative is bloodshed."</p>
<p>It is harvest time in Marble Hall, the cotton capital of
South Africa. So much fluff has fallen from the wagons on the
way to the gins that the roads seem to be paved in cotton.
Everything is white.</p>
<p>Marble Hall, located on the plains northeast of Pretoria,
is a bastion of the Conservative Party, the defender of
apartheid and white self-determination. About 3,500 whites
live in Marble Hall, almost all of them Afrikaners. Many are
descended from the Afrikaner pioneers who battled the Zulus
and British for a place they could call their own.
English-speakers are considered "uitlanders," foreigners.
Blacks come into town during the day to work or shop, and by
nightfall they are on their way back to the homelands of
Lebowa and kwaNdebele. This is the ordained neatness of
apartheid.</p>
<p>There are two cotton gins in town, and a marble mine a few
miles out. (The marble was discovered before the farmers
learned to grow cotton, hence the name, Marble Hall.) Church
spires and grain silos rise above the trees. The houses are
solid brick, the streets are neatly paved, the lawns always
green. The only theater in town is a drive-in. Saturdays are
for rugby. Sundays are for church.</p>
<p>Marble Hall once was a National Party town -- as was
nearly every white town in the country -- when the National
Party was still the defender of white supremacy. But the
coming change was evident when Willie Scheepers Sr., the
mayor's father, switched his allegiance.</p>
<p>"I've been National Party from the day I first opened my
eyes," he says. His wife and sons began leaving the party in
1983 when it started tinkering with apartheid by allowing
Indians and coloreds -- people of mixed race -- into
parliament, albeit in separate chambers. For a while, Mr.
Scheepers wouldn't talk politics to any of them. He did vote
for his son when he ran for the city council on the
Conservative Party ticket. But he rooted for the
Nationalists.</p>
<p>Then, one night last year, he was watching the television
news when he heard a report about Mr. de Klerk's return from
a trip to Europe. "There he was at the airport," Mr.
Scheepers recalls, "and someone asks him about the Group
Areas Act {which segregates neighborhoods}. Well, de Klerk
says it is no longer a factor in South Africa, that it is
almost gone." That did it. The Conservative Party had another
member.</p>
<p>"All my adult life, I've had a Group Areas Act," says Mr.
Scheepers, who is 69 years old. "It is the white peoples'
guarantee."</p>
<p>He picks up the National Party's election manifesto of
1988, which he keeps under a lace doily on the coffee table.
Right there, on page two, it says the party's policy "is that
each group {race} should have its own residential areas,
schools, homes for senior citizens. . . ." The Act is still
on the books, but the very notion that the government is now
thinking of scrapping it is treachery enough.</p>
<p>"They've been lying to us," says Mr. Scheepers, a retired
farmer. He wonders how anyone can trust the government now
when it promises to protect white minority rights in the new
constitution.</p>
<p>He feels betrayed, bewildered, angry. "My nationalism is
still the same. My belief in God is still the same. My love
of country is still the same," he says. "I haven't changed.
They've changed."</p>
<p>Since 1948, when it first came to power, the National
Party, along with the Dutch Reformed Church, has told whites
that they have a divine right to rule the country. They
institutionalized racism, made it legal, created an apartheid
theology. It's in the Bible, they said.</p>
<p>Now, although the government may have decided to negotiate
a new constitution with Mr. Mandela and the church has
repudiated apartheid, to many right-wingers he is still the
same antichrist the government and the church always said he
was. It's right there in the Book of Revelation, they say.</p>
<p>Around Marble Hall, Mr. de Klerk is commonly viewed as a
traitor and Johan Heyns, the head of the Dutch Reformed
Church, a Communist. In the past two years, nearly 200 adults
have joined the new Afrikaans Protestant Church, which broke
away from the local Dutch Reformed congregation when it began
preaching about integrating the races. Last week construction
began on a new APC church, which will seat 450.</p>
<p>Over at the van den Heever house, Mr. van den Heever
offers a refill of pineapple wine. "By the way," he says,
smiling broadly, "the most popular video in South Africa
today is the release of Mandela. You just play it backwards."</p>
<p>The Conservative Party would like to run all the recent
reforms in reverse. It is challenging the government to call
a new general election, claiming that the National Party
doesn't have a mandate for its reforms. But the government
wouldn't dare call an election now -- and it doesn't need to
until 1994 -- because the Conservatives, at this moment,
might well win a majority. In the parliamentary election nine
months ago, before the reforms kicked in, the Conservatives
won 31% of the white vote. Such is the current disaffection
with the National Party.</p>
<p>Plan B for the Conservatives is to press their demand for
a white homeland, a chunk of South Africa where whites will
be in the majority and they can rule themselves without
interference. The Conservatives may eventually bring that
demand to the negotiations on a new constitution. "But we
won't go into negotiations to discuss our exit from power,"
says Mr. van den Heever, one of the party's strategists. "No
way."</p>
<p>Both the government and the ANC, however, say the idea of
a white homeland is nonsense and unworthy of negotiation.
But, says Mr. van den Heever, "We know what we want. In some
ways we may look stupid, but, God knows, we aren't."</p>
<p>One thing they believe with certainty is that
power-sharing with the blacks won't work. "You can't simply
take some power from the whites and give it to the blacks.
They won't be satisfied until they have it all," Mr. van den
Heever says. "The biggest problem facing us is that the black
man doesn't have the discipline to rule himself. . . . Look
at Africa. They just don't get on with it."</p>
<p>The right-wingers frequently look to the black-ruled
countries north of the Limpopo River and cringe in horror and
fear at the poverty, corruption and tribal warfare. The
lesson they draw is that black rule will similarly impoverish
South Africa.</p>
<p>"We don't want to be brought down to their standards,"
Mayor Scheepers says.</p>
<p>Adds Mr. Mallinson: "It's easy to say we'll give South
Africa to Mandela. It's OK if he keeps it up to standards and
my wife and children don't get raped. We just don't want to
be ruled by a bunch of hooligans."</p>
<p>On the other side of town, beyond the cotton gins and the
citrus groves, Phil and Cornelia De Wet watch the walls close
in from their tobacco farm. They came to South Africa, the
land of their grandparents, in 1963, having left Kenya after
black independence there. In years since, they have watched
the southward migration of whites from Rhodesia (now
Zimbabwe), Mozambique and Angola, as black governments came
to power in those countries. Now, there is no place left to
go. For the whites of Africa, this is the last stop.</p>
<p>"Life on the farms is getting impossible," says Mr. De
Wet. The other week, his van was stolen from the garage; not
long before, a tractor was taken from the shed. Taxes are
soaring -- mainly, he reckons, to subsidize the black
development. And the blacks are talking ever more loudly
about land redistribution.</p>
<p>"They'll push us so far and then no more," he says.</p>
<p>"It's do or die," says his wife.</p>
<p>The other day, their teen-age son came home from school
with a curious question: Dad, will you capitulate? Replied
the father: "No, I'll fight and die." The son smiled proudly.</p>
<p>"When I came here from Kenya, I started from scratch,"
says Mr. De Wet. "When the ANC takes over, they'll
nationalize my land, and I'll have nothing again. Well, they
can have it. But, by golly, I'll take a few of them with me."</p>
<p>He wipes his face, weathered from years in the African
sun. "Mark my words," he says.</p>
