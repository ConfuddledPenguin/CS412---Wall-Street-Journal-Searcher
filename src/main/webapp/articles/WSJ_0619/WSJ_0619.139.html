	<p class="article-leader">BET PLC of Britain, a support-services concern, said
pretax profit for the year ended March 31 rose 19% to #322.3
million ($550.9 million) from #270.6 million a year earlier.
   Profit after taxes and minority interests and before
extraordinary items rose 23% to #222.2 million from #181
million. Per-share earnings increased 12% to 28.5 pence from
25.5 pence. Profit attributable to shareholders, after taxes
and special items, fell 2.3% to #224.3 million from #231.8
million; the latest year included a #2.1 million special
gain, and year-earlier results a #50.8 million gain from a
unit's sale. Operating profit rose 24% to #362 million from
#291 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales increased 21% to #2.7 billion from #2.2 billion.</p>
<p>BET, noting the results show its stability, said that
support services in the construction industry focus on the
heavy and highly specialized end of that business and helped
BET combat the overall downturn in British building, and that
its other services, including waste removal, office cleaning
and distribution, depend mostly on long-term contracts,
providing resilience.</p>
