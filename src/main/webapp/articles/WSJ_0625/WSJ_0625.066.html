	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- An administrative law judge recommended
giving United Parcel Service Co. authority to offer new
airline cargo service between the U.S. and Japan.
   If the recommendation is approved by the Bush
administration, UPS would be authorized to make six new
round-trip, all-cargo flights weekly between the two
countries. The authority would continue for five years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Acquisition of the route by UPS would be a defeat for
Emery Worldwide Airlines, a unit of Consolidated Freightways
Inc., which also sought the authority.</p>
<p>The law judge, Burton S. Kolko, said UPS "presented a
credible and achievable proposal that will provide greater
public benefits and enhance the competitive environment to a
greater degree in the U.S.-Japan all-cargo air transportation
market" than Emery would.</p>
<p>He recommended giving Emery backup authority for a year to
provide the service should UPS fail to do so.</p>
<p>The recommendation now will be considered by top
Transportation Department officials. Their decision is
subject to review by the White House, which generally goes
along with the department.</p>
<p>A final decision is expected by the end of the year.</p>
