	<p class="article-leader">ERIE, Pa. -- Zurn Industries Inc. said it was awarded two
contracts totaling $65 million from the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California.
   Next month, Zurn said, its Advanco Construction unit will
begin constructing the Etiwanda Pipeline Feeder, one of the
two projects.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It involves installing more than six miles of
12-foot-diameter pipe in Rancho Cucamonga and Fontana, Calif.
Included in the project are five tunnels under roadways. The
project is expected to be completed by March 1992, Zurn said.</p>
<p>Advanco also will build the Etiwanda Control Facility. The
450-foot water reservoir and control facility will intercept
and regulate water flow from the Etiwanda feeder and
distribute it to various water treatment and supply
locations.</p>
<p>Zurn said Advanco will construct its powerhouse building,
pressure control structure and outlet structure. That project
is expected to be completed in April 1992.</p>
