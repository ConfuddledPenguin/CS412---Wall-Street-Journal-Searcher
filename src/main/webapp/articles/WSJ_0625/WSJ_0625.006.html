	<p class="article-leader">KUALA LUMPUR -- Hitachi Corp.'s Malaysian unit, Hitachi
Consumer Products (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd., dismissed about 1,000
striking workers at its electronic parts plant.
   The workers at Hitachi's factory in Bangi, 40 miles south
of Kuala Lumpur, had been on strike last week in an action
the Malaysian government has termed illegal. The labor
protest followed the rejection of efforts by the workers --
who are mostly women -- to seek representation under a
national trade union, the Electrical Industry Workers Union.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under Malaysian labor law, workers in factories that make
electronic parts are entitled only to form in-house unions,
separate from national organizations.</p>
