	<p class="article-leader">Honeywell Inc. dropped a potentially ground-breaking
complaint it recently filed with the International Trade
Commission, under which it sought to block Minolta Camera Co.
from importing certain products into the U.S.
   The Minneapolis-based maker of control equipment that
three years ago filed a patent infringement suit against the
Japanese concern laid the petition before the ITC out of
frustration over the slow pace of that litigation, which it
hadn't expected to go to trial until 1992. The commission
could have provided relief in about 12 months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Friday, Honeywell disclosed that a federal court in
New Jersey had set an expedited trial date of Sept. 3, 1991,
for the civil suit. The company said the court also appointed
a special master to help keep the case on schedule.</p>
<p>The new trial date means a resolution for the patent
dispute in the "same time frame" as the ITC action, a company
spokeswoman said. But it's "preferable," she said, because
"in addition to an injunction, it also offers money damages
if we win the case."</p>
<p>But Honeywell's decision to drop its ITC petition means
that there won't be an expected legal exploration of the
so-called Section 337 Amendment of the 1988 Trade Act. Under
that amendment, U.S. companies can seek to block imports of
products that infringe on intellectual property; the ITC's
historic role has been in protecting U.S. producers from
unfair practices by overseas competitors.</p>
<p>A recent General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade panel
found against that provision of the Trade Act, however, after
determining that the provision discriminates against foreign
companies. The U.S. accepted that ruling, although it is
continuing to address intellectual-property matters in the
current round of GATT talks.</p>
<p>Honeywell's suit says it confidentially provided Minolta
with information for making auto-focus modules with the
understanding that the Osaka, Japan, concern would later
incorporate Honeywell-made modules in its cameras. The suit
also charges that while absorbing this knowledge, Minolta
secretly conducted its own parallel development effort and,
in 1985, introduced products based on Honeywell technology.</p>
<p>Asked whether the ITC complaint was designed to turn up
the pressure for getting its civil case heard, the
spokeswoman heatedly denied the suggestion. Honeywell was
surprised by the court's move, she said, adding that the
company had been pursuing relief through the court and the
ITC on a "parallel" basis.</p>
<p>In disclosing its decision, Honeywell said, "We recognize
that our ITC complaint would have been an important test case
to clarify Congress's intent in amending Section 337 to
protect American technological know-how." The company added
that it "continues to believe that the ITC is an important
and appropriate forum" for protecting U.S. companies'
intellectual property.</p>
<p>Minolta said that it hopes Honeywell will be encouraged to
"discontinue its efforts to drag this straightforward patent
dispute into the political arena." Minolta called Honeywell's
civil complaint "unfounded" and said it is confident "we will
prevail" when the issue comes to trial next year.</p>
