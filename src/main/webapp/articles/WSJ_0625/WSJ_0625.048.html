	<p class="article-leader">JAPAN: WORLD'S NO. 1 DONOR</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japan for the first time replaced the U.S. as the world's
largest donor of official foreign aid in 1989, the Finance
Ministry said. "It's an epoch-making development," said a
ministry official.</p>
<p>Japan's official development-assistance payments totaled
$8.95 billion in 1989. The U.S. was next at $7.66 billion and
France third with $7.46 billion, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Japan's 1989 total, at 1.235 trillion yen, was the
country's largest ever in yen terms, up 5.6% from a year
earlier, the official said. But it dropped 1.9% in dollar
terms, ministry figures show, because of yen depreciation
against the dollar.</p>
<p>Growth in Japanese foreign-aid spending was less
significant in Japan becoming the world's No. 1 donor than a
slowdown in U.S. aid spending, the ministry official said. He
said U.S. development-aid spending declined to $7.66 billion
in 1989 from $10.14 billion in 1988.</p>
<p>HONG KONG PRISON CHANGE</p>
<p>Hong Kong is to end the use of corporal punishment in its
prisons, the government said. It said a Correctional Services
Department study had shown there were better ways to
rehabilitate prisoners than beating them with a cane.
Canings, mainly used against young offenders, have become
less frequent in the British colony in recent years.</p>
<p>MORE VIETNAMESE EXPORTS</p>
<p>Vietnam substantially increased exports in the first half
of this year but failed to increase the growth rate in
agriculture and industry, said the chairman of the State
Planning Commission, Pham Van Khai, according to the Vietnam
News Agency. Mr. Khai said first-half exports -- including
crude oil, rice, pork, rubber, coffee and tea -- were up 40%
from the same period last year. He said imports for the
period were up 6.8%. Inflation averaged 2.7% a month in the
the first five months of 1990, Mr. Khai said.</p>
<p>ROMANIAN PETROCHEMICALS</p>
<p>Romania hopes to upgrade its petrochemicals industry
through joint ventures with Western companies, the state news
agency Rompress said. Rompress said the Ministry of Chemistry
has contacted more than 20 foreign companies, including Dow
Chemical Co. of the U.S., Imperial Chemicals Industries PLC
of the United Kingdom, Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France and
Mannesmann AG of West Germany to discuss possible cooperation
in chemical products. Romania now exports various
petrochemical products including polyvinyl chloride and
solvents.</p>
<p>NEW HONDA PROGRAM</p>
<p>Japan's Honda Motor Co. announced that it has begun a
world-wide program to equip its dealers with
chlorofluorocarbon-gas retrieval devices designed to prevent
the release of CFCs into the atmosphere during servicing of
vehicle air-conditioner systems. In Japan, 2,000 of Honda's
2,600-outlet network will be equipped by autumn with the
gear, a spokesman said. The devices cost 260,000 yen ($1,680)
each, with dealers contributing some of the expense but with
no cost to the customer, he said. Toyota Motor Corp. recently
said its overseas service units are installing similar gear,
while about 30% of its Japanese units have already been
equipped.</p>
<p>WAR CRIMINALS IN BRITAIN</p>
<p>The British government has decided to defy the unelected
House of Lords and reintroduce a bill to allow the
prosecution of elderly suspected Nazi war criminals living in
Britain. Sir Geoffrey Howe, Conservative leader of the House
of Commons, said the government intends during the next
session of Parliament to resubmit the War Crimes Bill
defeated by the Lords June 5. The Lords' powers are limited
to delaying legislation for one year. The elected House of
Commons had passed the bill in December 270-60. Peers who
opposed the bill said fair trials were impossible and
dragging aging emigres before courts would only stir old
hatreds.</p>
<p>BRITISH SHIPYARD BAN</p>
<p>The European Community Commission confirmed it will
continue to block the reopening of shipyards in northeast
England even though world-wide demand for new ships is likely
to double by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>The commission said that when North East Shipbuilders Ltd.
closed last year, with the loss of 4,000 jobs in the
Sunderland area, it allowed the British government to give
state aid to the area on the condition that the shipyards
remain shut.</p>
<p>The decision has angered politicians and union leaders
lobbying for the yards to be reopened. They claim that the
Sunderland yards are among the most modern in Europe and that
several foreign companies have approached the government
offering to take them over.</p>
<p>A commission spokesman said the commission wanted to
eliminate overcapacity in the European shipbuilding industry
and that marginal yards like Sunderland's would have to
remain shut. He concluded: "There's no way 'round that
decision."</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Marc Bohan, the former designer for Christian Dior, is
expected to take over as artistic director of the British
fashion house of Norman Hartnell. He would thus become the
first major French designer to head an English fashion house.
