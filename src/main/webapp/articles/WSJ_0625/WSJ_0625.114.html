	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- When Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was
in California earlier this month, he was treated to a brief
inspirational lecture from Nobel-prize-winning economist
Milton Friedman. Mr. Friedman told the Soviet leader how the
first Western visitors to Meiji, Japan, a century ago wrote
back that the Japanese "were lazy, unmotivated and
inefficient. They would never get anywhere."
   The moral: Economic disparities among nations have little
to do with cultural differences. If Mr. Gorbachev would
simply embrace capitalism, his nation, like Japan, could
become an economic powerhouse.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Soviet leader liked the tale, and repeated it a few
days later. But once back in Moscow, he was quickly reminded
that life is not always as simple as Mr. Friedman's theories.
The Soviet economy is caught in a steep downward spiral. For
Mr. Gorbachev, there is no easy way out. And for Western
policy makers -- if they are so inclined -- there is no easy
way to help.</p>
<p>Soviet economists attending conferences here and in Europe
in recent weeks have estimated that the U.S.S.R.'s economy
may shrink by 5% or more this year. "The Soviet economy,
which was already in poor shape after suffering seven decades
of central planning, has deteriorated even more in the last
year," says Michael Boskin, the chairman of President Bush's
Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p>Bush administration officials say Mr. Gorbachev's problems
demonstrate the folly of piecemeal reforms in a
centrally-planned economy. By freeing up some sectors of the
economy while keeping others controlled, the Soviet president
has only made the nation's economic system more irrational
than ever. And his five year succession of bungled economic
plans has destroyed his credibility as an economic-policy
maker.</p>
<p>This prevailing sentiment is illustrated by a popular
Soviet joke recounted by Marshall Goldman, an economist at
Wellesley University: A farmer goes to his priest to complain
that ten of his chickens have died. The priest instructs him
to give each chicken an aspirin. The farmer returns the next
day to report twenty more chickens have died. The priest
prescribes castor oil. The farmer returns again and reports
thirty more dead chickens, and the priest recommends a dose
of penicillin.</p>
<p>Finally, the farmer tells the priest that all his chickens
have died. "Such a pity," says the priest. "I had so many
more remedies."</p>
<p>This is the mess that faces U.S. officials as they begin
to grapple with the delicate question of whether to provide
direct aid to the Soviet Union. West Germany and France are
advocating an aid package of up to $20 billion, and President
Bush will be forced to confront the topic at the July
economic summit of industrialized nations in Houston.</p>
<p>On political and strategic grounds, there is an argument
to be made in favor of aid. Mr. Bush and Secretary of State
James Baker believe they are within months of signing an
interlocking set of treaties that would seal Moscow's retreat
from Eastern Europe, end its 40-year edge in conventional
arms on the continent, erase the main Soviet nuclear
advantages and unify Germany on Western terms. They privately
argue these agreements depend on Mr. Gorbachev's survival and
retention of leeway in foreign policy, at least in the near
term. Financial aid could help prop him up.</p>
<p>But on economic terms, the case for aid is far weaker,
which is one reason U.S. officials are reluctant to go along.
They won't say much about the sensitive subject for the
record. But privately, some worry that the Soviet president
has taken every opportunity to avoid or delay the painful
reforms needed to get the Soviet economy on track. A stream
of money from the West would merely enable him to buy more
time, and delay reforms even longer.</p>
<p>As a result, any Western aid, they stress, should be
firmly tied to Soviet plans for a severe and comprehensive
economic reform plan, including legalization of private
property and rapid removal of price controls. And any such
plan should allow the West to monitor Soviet economic
reforms.</p>
<p>That won't be easy. Some U.S. and German officials favor
using the International Monetary Fund to oversee the reforms,
as the agency does in similar economic adjustments in Latin
America. But Moscow doesn't belong to the IMF. Moreover, IMF
surveillance causes intense resentment even among the
smallest nations; it is certain to seem an intolerable
intrusion to a nominal superpower with 10,000 nuclear
warheads.</p>
<p>A more modest aid plan being considered by the
administration is simple, humanitarian food aid to address
pockets of hunger. But even here, the problems are immense.
Western officials contemplating food aid worry it would
simply be dumped on docks or at rail and truck depots, where
it would rot or be stolen like so much of the Soviet's own
production. Officials are considering a plan to send Western
trucks and planes directly to interior Soviet cities, where
distribution could be made to consumers or small stores. But
Mr. Gorbachev could see that as an unwelcome intrusion.</p>
<p>Whether any such efforts will help cure the sick Soviet
economy remains far from clear. Harvard economist Lawrence
Summers, an adviser to the Lithuanian government, argues the
best course for the U.S. is simply to sit back and allow the
gradual devolution of economic policy-making power from the
central government to the various republics. At least then,
he contends, there would be experimentation and competition
among the local governments to come up with an economic cure
that works.</p>
