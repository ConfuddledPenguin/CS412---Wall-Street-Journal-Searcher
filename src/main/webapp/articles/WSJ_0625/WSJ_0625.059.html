	<p class="article-leader">SAN DIEGO -- La Jolla Bancorp said shareholders approved
its agreement to merge with Security Pacific Corp. in an
exchange of stock valued at about $110 million.
   La Jolla said 64% of its shareholders approved the merger
at the company's annual meeting on Friday, while fewer than
2% voted against it. The agreement calls for the conversion,
at a rate to be determined later, of each of La Jolla
Bancorp's about seven million shares outstanding into the
right to receive about $15 in market value of Security
Pacific common stock.</p>

Security Pacific's stock closed unchanged at $38.50 a share.
La Jolla Bancorp's stock closed at $13.875 a share, down 12.5
