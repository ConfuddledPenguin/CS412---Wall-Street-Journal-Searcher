	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Groupement des Assurances Nationales, called GAN,
unveiled details of a planned 3.6 billion franc ($639.4
million) capital boost through the issuance of new shares
with warrants attached.
   The capital increase makes GAN the third major French
state-owned insurer to take advantage of a law passed in
December that relaxes the limits on shareholdings in state
insurers by concerns other than the government. Insurers now
may issue 25% of their share capital to private investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Assurances Generales de France plans to tap the market
later this year, and Union des Assurances de Paris has
already launched a 10.5 billion-franc capital boost through a
share increase.</p>
<p>GAN Chairman Francois Heilbronner said the new funds will
help finance the company's acquisitions and investments
abroad. "Up until now, GAN has been able to raise the
necessary funds for its expansion through internal sources,"
he said. "But financial deregulation and the opening of
European borders has created a new situation, which requires
a rapid acceleration of our activities abroad."</p>
