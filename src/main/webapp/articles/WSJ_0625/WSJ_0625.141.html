	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- "Dick Tracy," the closely watched summer
movie from Walt Disney Co., turned in a solid performance in
its second weekend, allaying fears that it might be a flop,
entertainment industry sources said.
   "Dick Tracy" was the top-grossing film for the weekend;
preliminary estimates put its weekend gross at $15.5 million
to $16.7 million. The No. 2 film was the estimated $14.8
million opening of Orion Pictures Corp.'s "RoboCop 2." The
No. 3 movie, Carolco Pictures Inc.'s "Total Recall," made an
estimated $8.6 million for its fourth weekend.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The estimate for "Dick Tracy" appears to be a modest
26%-31% slide from the movie's $22.5 million take on its
opening weekend. "It's a very, very good hold," said Martin
Grove, box office analyst with Baseline, an entertainment
information service. Some movies have slumped as much as 45%
in their second weekend, Mr. Grove noted.</p>
<p>Moreover, the weekend pattern of a sharp 47% drop on
Friday, a smoother 5% slide on Saturday from a week earlier,
and a projected 18% drop for Sunday suggests that
word-of-mouth recommendations are holding up, said Mr. Grove.
He projects that the movie will "easily" top $100 million in
gross ticket sales at U.S. theaters.</p>
