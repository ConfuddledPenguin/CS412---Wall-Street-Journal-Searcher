	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A former market-research manager at Raytheon
Co.'s largest unit and a onetime marketing official at
General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Aircraft subsidiary were
convicted of conspiring to swap sensitive Pentagon planning
documents.
   Frank Caso, who worked at Hughes until last year, and John
Kiely, formerly a market-research manager for Raytheon's
Missile Systems division, were convicted after a weeklong
trial in federal district court in Alexandria, Va.
Prosecutors asserted that, beginning in the mid-1970s, the
two men conspired with employees of other defense contractors
to illegally acquire and trade classified Pentagon documents.
They face a maximum sentence of five years in prison.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Prosecutors presented new details about how such
document-swapping over the years gave major defense
contractors access to some of the military's most sensitive
long-range planning materials. Six individuals and five
companies, including Hughes, Raytheon and Boeing Co.,
previously were convicted of charges stemming from the
investigation code-named "Operation Uncover." The grand jury
investigation is continuing.</p>
<p>Mr. Caso was indicted on charges involving using a post
office box to receive the documents and placing false titles
in Hughes's document-accountability system to try to hide
some of his activities. Mr. Kiely, who was an Air Force major
before joining Raytheon in 1967, was accused of illegally
copying classified documents in the firm's Arlington, Va.,
office as part of a scheme to share them with other defense
contractors.</p>
