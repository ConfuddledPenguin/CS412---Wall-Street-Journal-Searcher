	<p class="article-leader">The Murphy Card. Don't leave home without it.
   Too bad] Somebody else already has that slogan. But no
matter. In a new foray into the realm of prestige charge
cards, Maryland National Bank is offering the Murphys of this
world and the Bowes, Careys, Finnegans, Gallaghers, Hubers,
Kellys, Kennedys, McCarthys, O'Briens, Stewarts and
Williamses -- the chance to have the ultimate in personalized
plastic.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Maryland National, the nation's sixth-largest issuer of
credit cards, is soliciting Americans with those 12 ancestral
British Isles names to order "family cards," with their own
names boldly emblazoned across the top. Applicants can choose
a handsome black card or a more-upscale gold card. Both sport
the family's crest -- well, something like it, anyway.</p>
<p>"The design of the crests is a somewhat educated guess,"
concedes Terrance R. Flynn, senior vice president of MBNA
America, the bank's credit-card subsidiary. "There are some
where there's basically just a description and not much
artwork. In that case we do an artistic rendering of the
verbal description. I won't guarantee it's 100% accurate."</p>
<p>In reality, the family cards are little more than the
standard pauper's Visa cards dressed up in princely garb.
They're the latest offshoot of the affinity-card phenomenon
in which banks cook up cards designed to appeal to various
special-interest groups. Of the 211 million Visa and
MasterCard charge cards in consumers' hands, an estimated 31
million are affinity cards.</p>
<p>As such, the family cards join such earlier prestige
plastic as Leader Federal Bank's "Elvis card" and a proposed
card for the Young Astronauts of Utah that, not surprisingly,
never got off the ground.</p>
<p>Credit-card critics don't take well to such seeming
frivolity. "There are only a couple of dozen really valid
affinity groups," says Spencer Nilson, publisher of a
credit-card newsletter. "All these others are mutants, like
those Ninja Turtles."</p>
<p>But at Leader Federal in Memphis, Tenn., Executive Vice
President Brad Champlin isn't about to concede that the Elvis
card is anything less than a national treasure. He warns that
the current card, featuring a guitar-pounding Elvis in front
of a Wurlitzer jukebox, is "a limited first edition." When
25,000 have been issued (10,000 are outstanding right now),
"we'll retire the current design and register it in the
national archives or somewhere."</p>
