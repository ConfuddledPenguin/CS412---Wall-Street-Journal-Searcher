	<p class="article-leader">POMONA, Calif. -- MMI Medical Inc. reported a 70% drop in
fiscal fourth-quarter net income and said it expects to
report "only nominal" profits for the fiscal 1991 first
quarter.
   MMI Medical, which provides diagnostic imaging services,
said net for the quarter ended April 27 fell to $237,000, or
nine cents a share, from $778,000, or 28 cents a share, a
year earlier. Revenue was flat at $9.7 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Results for the latest quarter include an after-tax charge
of $87,000, or three cents a share, for adjustments to
first-quarter results, which apparently were overstated. MMI
Medical reported net of $576,000, or 21 cents a share, on
revenue of $9.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 1990.</p>
<p>Dudley A. Rauch, chairman and chief executive officer,
declined to disclose details of the restatement.</p>
<p>Mr. Rauch said MMI Medical has suffered from industrywide
pressures in the diagnostic imaging market, where rates for
equipment rentals drop swiftly with the age of equipment. In
addition, the tax rate for the latest quarter jumped to 35%
from 22% a year earlier, as availability of investment tax
credits declined. On the plus side, the company's maintenance
business, which represents more than 70% of revenue, has
shown "continued growth and profitability," he said.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year, net fell 50% to $1.4 million, or 51
cents a share, from $2.8 million, or $1.02 a share, a year
earlier. Revenue was $38.1 million, up from $38 million.</p>
