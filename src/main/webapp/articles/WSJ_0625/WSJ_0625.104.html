	<p class="article-leader">EAST BERLIN -- The U.S. and its European allies plan to
use some coming events to help Moscow swallow the humiliating
loss of East Germany.
   Following a meeting of the four World War II victors and
the two Germanys here Friday on German unification, there was
a consensus that the merger of the two Germanys has acquired
a breakneck momentum, and that despite Moscow's latest
foot-dragging effort, its leverage to block it is declining
rapidly. But the Western allies want to bolster besieged
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev to allow him to complete
the Soviet retreat from Eastern Europe and to carry out a
series of sweeping arms-control reductions while he still
retains domestic political control.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting in London
next month, the allies will focus on reshaping the alliance
to make it less threatening militarily to the Soviet Union --
a step the Soviets are urging. At a meeting of European
Community heads of government in Dublin this week and at next
month's economic summit in Houston of the major
industrialized countries, Western leaders will discuss
economic assistance for the Soviets. And there is optimism
about completing a conventional arms-reduction pact by this
fall, in part because it gives Moscow "some political cover
for withdrawals they are going to have to make in any event,"
said a senior American official.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev is facing serious domestic opposition to
German unification on the West's terms. This pressure adds to
the sharp criticism over his handling of the Soviet economy.
Critics on Mr. Gorbachev's political left welcome freedom for
the German people but are concerned that the way unification
is taking place will produce a powerful Germany, according to
Anatoly Sobchak, the mayor of Leningrad, who recently spoke
at Lewis and Clark College's law school in Portland, Ore.</p>
<p>But Mr. Sobchak said the real danger to Mr. Gorbachev is
from the political right and their allies in the military who
fear Mr. Gorbachev is giving away their war gains. Last week
at the Russian republic's party congress, Gen. Albert
Makashov, commander of the Volga-Ural military district,
complained that "The Soviet army is being driven without
combat out of the countries that our fathers liberated from
fascism." Mr. Gorbachev faces a tough test during a national
party congress next month.</p>
<p>The Soviets underscored this pressure during Friday's
meeting here by presenting a unification plan that would
require a continuing presence of occupation forces for as
long as five years following unification. The plan was
opposed by the U.S., France, Britain and West Germany, at the
meeting of the four World War II victors and the two Germanys
-- known as the "two-plus-four" talks.</p>
<p>U.S. and European officials were quick to tell reporters
that the Soviet hard-line proposal was mainly for Soviet
domestic consumption. Indeed, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, in a joint press conference ending the
two-plus-four meeting, weakened his own proposal by noting
that "the provisions in our draft are not regarded by us as
the final truth. We are ready to seek compromise approaches."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, one U.S. official who specializes in Soviet
affairs said it is difficult to calculate how much pressure
will be exerted on Mr. Gorbachev to resist German
unification. The official added that because of the political
changes that have taken place in Moscow permitting open
criticism, Mr. Gorbachev himself may not know how far he can
go. The official noted that beginning last February, Yigor
Ligachev, a Politburo member who is Mr. Gorbachev's leading
conservative critic, began publicly blaming Mr. Gorbachev for
"losing" Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>It is clear in Berlin how quickly Soviet leverage over
German unification is evaporating. Last Friday's ceremony
removing Checkpoint Charlie, a well-known crossing point
between East and West, symbolized reunification. Several
yards away, providing a symbol of declining Soviet influence,
some youthful entrepreneurs were selling Soviet military
uniforms displayed on hangers attached to a remnant of the
Berlin wall.</p>
<p>Events are moving rapidly. German economic unification is
set for next week, the Western allies hope German unification
will be endorsed at a 35-nation conference in late fall and
West German leaders predict that all-German elections will
take place in December.</p>
<p>Resisting this process could be a dangerous game for the
Soviets. Moscow sees West Germany as its most important
source of help for economic rebuilding and trade. Bonn last
week agreed to guarantee a bank credit for the Soviets
totaling five billion West German marks ($2.98 billion), the
largest ever granted to Moscow by anyone. And this week's
edition of the weekly Der Spiegel says that West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is planning to present a much larger
aid package -- totaling 25 to 30 billion marks -- during a
visit to Moscow in late July.</p>
<p>At the same time, the leverage provided by 380,000 Soviet
troops in East Germany also is growing weaker. The first
demonstrations ever against Moscow's troops there, which took
place earlier this year, underline the danger of their
continuing presence. Soviet officials also fear the domestic
impact of keeping these troops there long enough to witness
the bounties of West German capitalism.</p>
<p>"The effect on troops of the Deutsche mark in Germany
could be more dangerous to the Soviet Union than were drugs
in Afghanistan," said a Soviet Foreign Ministry official.</p>
<p>A U.S. official traveling back to Washington from Berlin
on Secretary of State James Baker's airplane, concluded that
"The leverage the Soviets have, and the only leverage the
Soviets have, is to delay sovereignty" by refusing to give up
their legal rights of occupation. But, the official added, "I
think they must realize that would not be a particularly
profitable course for them to follow."</p>
<p>Ronald Asmas, a Rand Corp. expert on Germany, said, "The
Soviet leverage is currently at its height, but it is
decreasing rapidly."</p>
<p>But even though Mr. Gorbachev is playing a weak hand, U.S.
officials believe it is important to bolster him. Ironically,
the ultimate leverage he may have is the chaos and danger
that would ensue if the Soviet Union were to collapse. After
initially resisting providing economic assistance to Moscow,
the Bush administration now is prepared to reluctantly go
along. The Houston economic summit "will begin the process of
discussing that issue in international forums," said the
official on Mr. Baker's aircraft.</p>
<p>In the West, there is a degree of understanding and
tolerance for Moscow's problems. "I've told my American
friends that we have to avoid turning two-plus-four into
five-against-one," said Karsten Voight, a Social Democrat
member of West Germany's Parliament and a security expert.</p>
<p>At Friday's two-plus-four news conference, when Mr.
Shevardnadze was questioned sharply about his new proposal
for unification, he asserted that Moscow wasn't rejecting the
consensus views of the Western allies. Rather, he said, "We
add something to them." His answer produced a good-natured
laugh from Mr. Baker, who admires a facile response by a
politician who is fighting an uphill battle.</p>
