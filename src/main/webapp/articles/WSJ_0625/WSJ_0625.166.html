	<h3>Travel: Free Tickets Are Getting Many Frequent Fliers Nowhere</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">A lot of frequent fliers are about to get grounded.
   After being promised great trips for their loyalty,
frequent fliers are being told they can't use their free
travel awards to such popular locations as Europe and Asia
for the entire summer -- and even early fall. First-class
upgrades, one of the most popular awards in frequent-flier
programs, are getting increasingly scarce on many routes too,
travel specialists say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The reason? Airlines limit the number of free-trip seats
per flight for award winners. The allocations have always
inconvenienced some fliers, but they've become far more
critical as membership in the programs mushrooms.</p>
<p>"It's never been this bad before," says John Holland,
president of Business Flyer, a trade letter. "The chances of
using a free ticket to a place like Europe right now is about
as good as winning the lottery."</p>
<p>And it could get worse. During a frequent-flier promotion
last winter, airlines gave away one free ticket for every
three flown. Most of those free tickets can be used only from
September to December, and travel experts say frequent fliers
will be scrambling for seats even then. "The smart people are
already booking these trips now," says Randy Petersen, editor
of Frequent, another trade magazine.</p>
<p>Airlines insist the latest problem isn't their fault; they
say they need to limit the seats to make room for paying
customers. "The industry has to be profitable to maintain
these programs," says Earl Quenzel, a staff vice president at
Continental Airlines, a unit of Continental Airlines Holdings
Inc. But critics say airlines are too chintzy with their
allocations. Although they won't specify exact numbers, some
carriers set aside only a small percentage of seats on
popular flights, hardly enough for the nation's 22 million
frequent-flier club members.</p>
<p>"The airlines are basically reneging on a promise to
reward their loyal customers," contends Theodore Harris, a
travel consultant in McLean, Va. "Some of these awards are
about as good as a three-dollar bill."</p>
<p>Certainly many travelers are still benefiting from the
programs, by taking free tickets and hotel stays in less
popular destinations or during off season. Also, two
carriers, Pan Am Corp. and Midway Airlines, say they don't
limit the number of seats for award winners, although they
halt use of the freebies during certain holiday periods. Some
carriers also have removed seat restrictions for club members
willing to cash in twice as many miles as normal.</p>
<p>Several airlines concede that free travel space is filling
up unusually fast.</p>
<p>USAir Group says it has no space for award users who want
to fly to London "until probably at least September or
October, and there hasn't been for some time." A spokesman
for Trans World Airlines says that some seats are still
available for free travel to Europe this summer, but "they're
few and far between."</p>
<p>Space is also tight for frequent fliers trying to redeem
awards with partners in the programs, which include hotels,
car rental agencies and some foreign carriers. Many of these
partners are even stricter with the allocations than the
airlines running the programs. Some foreign airlines that are
partners, for example, have limited the number of seats for
award winners to 12 of 250-seat planes.</p>
<p>Learning of the space shortage isn't always quick and
painless either. "It's a maddening system," says David Wilf,
a frequent flier who says he had to make three sets of
requests through United Airlines to try to book a flight on
Alitalia Airlines, which honors United frequent-flier miles.
Each time, he says, he was allowed to give only three dates,
and then had to wait for United to call back. "It took weeks
just to find out they didn't have any room for me," recalls
Mr. Wilf, a San Francisco attorney. "I was totally
frustrated."</p>
<p>The industry has frustrated frequent fliers before.
Concerned that too many award winners were displacing paying
customers, several carriers abruptly raised the mileage
credits needed to earn free trips a few years ago. The irony
of such moves, say travel experts, is they can alienate the
industry's most valued customers: Frequent fliers who travel
at least 12 times a year may account for only 3% of all
passengers, but they bring in almost a third of the
industry's revenue.</p>
<p>"These are the last people you'd think the airlines would
want to get mad," says Mr. Petersen of Frequent magazine.</p>
<p>For their part, airline officials say space would be tight
anyway on many of the flights frequent fliers want, because
travel is booming to Europe and Asia. "Even somebody with
hard cash is going to have a hard time getting a seat to some
of these places," says a United Airlines spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Some carriers are trying to take a few steps to help their
members. Continental has started taking frequent flier
waiting lists and opening up more space for award winners two
weeks before departure. Other airlines have started advising
travelers to book their freebie flights as much as a year in
advance.</p>
<p>But frequent fliers gripe that they can't take a vacation
on two weeks notice, nor can they plan a full year ahead. And
many wonder whether the very practice of restricting award
space, which airlines mention only in the fine print of their
brochures, is deceptive. Several state attorneys general
questioned the practice and issued national guidelines for
the programs in December 1987. But the airlines sued the
states over the guidelines and a Texas federal judge enjoined
the states from enforcing them.</p>
<p>"Basically, the airlines can do what they want and our
hands are tied," says Steve Gardner, an assistant state
attorney general in Texas.</p>
