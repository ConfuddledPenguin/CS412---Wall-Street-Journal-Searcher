	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- A deafening chorus of activists howling
"shame, shame," all but completely drowned out a speech by
Louis Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services, to
close the Sixth International Conference on AIDS.
   Showered by paper missiles, Dr. Sullivan plowed stolidly
through a speech that was intended to defend the
administration's research efforts to fight the disease. But
this week those efforts have been completely overshadowed
here by the administration's curbs on the travel and
immigration of people who carry the AIDS virus. The policy
was condemned by speakers including Hiroshi Nakajima,
director general of the World Health Organization, minutes
before Dr. Sullivan's introduction unleashed the
20-minute-long protest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>His speech went almost completely unheard. Amid the
shrieking of whistles and air horns, most people missed the
secretary's criticism of an unpopular amendment to the
Americans with Disabilities Act, which permits employers to
reassign AIDS-infected food handlers. The impromptu addition
to his text was timed to coincide with a key vote scheduled
on that amendment today. Scientists agree the virus isn't
passed by casual contact, or through food.</p>
<p>But the hundreds of activists in the audience taking part
in the protest were unmoved by any note of conciliation. They
were joined in some cases by scientists who stood holding
leaflets aloft in silent solidarity against the U.S. travel
curbs.</p>
<p>But many were also dismayed by the display. "I feel like
crying. He should be allowed to speak," said Pierre
Ludington, a San Francisco AIDS activist. A grim-faced
spokesman for the San Francisco AIDS Foundation said he
feared the hostile show would exhaust any remaining sympathy
for activists within the administration. "It doesn't leave us
a lot of maneuvering room," Rene Durazzo, the foundation
spokesman, said.</p>
<p>As the flag bearer for President Bush, who declined to
attend, Dr. Sullivan was dispatched to San Francisco to
represent the administration without anything new to offer
the assembled thousands of delegates. But aides said
yesterday that he knew what he was getting into.</p>
<p>"It was his idea" to try to speak through the clamor, said
Robert Schmermund, deputy assistant secretary for public
affairs. "He wanted to come here and present what the
administration is doing."</p>
<p>Dr. Sullivan's speech brought to noisy closure a meeting
best described in the words of one activist as "not an
academic workshop, but a fight for people's lives."</p>
<p>As AIDS enters its second decade in the 1990s, many
unresolved questions remain to be answered in AIDS clinics
and laboratories around the world.</p>
<p>Even as drugs and behavior change slow its spread in parts
of the United States, new waves of AIDS are growing around
the world. "The AIDS pandemic remains volatile and dynamic.
Its major impact has yet to be felt," said Jonathan Mann,
former AIDS chief at the World Health Organization. Rapid
spread continues in Africa, Latin America, Asia and the
Caribbean, he said. "Heterosexual transmission in India is
fueling a rapidly expanding epidemic," he said. Up to 20% of
prostitutes sampled in the city of Bombay test positive, one
report noted.</p>
<p>In Africa and the Third World, a huge resource gap yawns
between rich and poor countries. And giving has been
strikingly low. "The industrialized world's total
contribution to AIDS {in the developing world} is about $200
million-or one-fifth the AIDS budget of New York State," Dr.
Mann said.</p>
<p>In Malawi, a country of 8 million people, Chief of Health
Services H.M. Ntaba said his annual AIDS budget totals $2
million, or 25 cents per person. It is vastly more than he
has to fight malaria, but still "a drop in the bucket," he
says. AIDS also is expected to leave Africa with a legacy of
between 250,000 and one million orphans, experts said during
the meeting.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, where the country's admitted 490
cases were spread by unsterile medical practices, journalist
Elena Pankova says: "We are afraid to go to the dentist. We
are afraid to take our children to the hospital." Speaking in
an effort to drum up charitable contributions for her
country, she said, "We have no disposable needles or
syringes, and no condoms. Just imagine]" She said the true
size of the epidemic is many times larger than official
figures.</p>
<p>On the domestic research agenda, a major unresolved
dilemma touches the need to balance early treatment of HIV
infection against the risk of encouraging the rise of viruses
that are resistant to drugs like Wellcome PLC's AZT. Margaret
Fischl, a researcher at the University of Miami, said that
earlier treatment is clearly linked with longer-term survival
benefits for people with HIV disease.</p>
<p>Still, the virus can begin mutating to evade the drug
within months of starting treatment. Douglas Richman, a
researcher at the University of California at San Diego,
previewed a new study showing that viral resistance appears
as early as six months in late-stage patients, and 12 months
in early-stage patients. As the time between infection and
the appearance of AIDS stretches out to 10 years and beyond,
scientists worry about mass initiation of long-term AZT
therapy. "Will widespread use of AZT come to resemble the use
of penicillin for now-resistant staph infection?" asked
Hiroshi Mohri, a researcher at the University of California,
Los Angeles. "With passage of time, will AZT become less
useful?"</p>
<p>For this reason, more and more studies now are aimed at
testing a vast array of combination treatments, alternating
AZT with other drugs such as DDC by Hoffman La Roche Inc. or
DDI by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., or with immune-boosting
agents, which try to reconstitute a failing immune system.</p>
<p>Immune-boosting agents will be a major focus for the
1990s, as will treatment for opportunistic infections, caused
by an array of microbes that attack weakened patients. So
far, immune-boosting treatments have been "marginal at best,
and transient," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>Refining the treatment of opportunistic infections
deserves attention as much as the virus itself, he said. "We
already know more about HIV than those other microbes we've
been studying for decades," Dr. Fauci added yesterday.</p>
<p>Outreach to minority populations at risk, especially
intravenous drug users, is a major point of contention
between the scientific community and certain black social
activists. Deborah Fraser-Howe, executive director of the
Black Leadership Coalition on AIDS, spoke as a woman in
Harlem, "raising another generation as the shadow of death
falls across our community." Her speech was picketed by
activists who want free needle exchange and bleach programs
to halt spread of AIDS -- an approach rejected by many
middle-class blacks as encouraging addiction.</p>
<p>Yet white American and European academics like Don Des
Jarlais of New York and Raymond Brettle of Edinburgh,
Scotland, argue it is imperative to make needle use less
perilous for those who can't quit drugs. Moreover, needle
exchange doesn't create new addicts, Dr. Brettle says. "We
have to persuade people that {reducing the harm of I-V drug
use} and primary reduction of drug use are compatible."</p>
<p>Adolescents -- especially runaway teens who are sexually
active and using drugs -- are potential tinder for the AIDS
epidemic. Researchers here said up to 40% of selected samples
of urban runaway youth may carry the HIV virus.</p>
<p>In the arena of vaccine research, where researchers have
shown they can shield test animals from infection and alter
the human immune response, many issues remain. Dr. Fauci said
that the convention of waiting for clear evidence of safety
and effectiveness in animals before human trials, may be
tempered by the increased willingness of affected populations
to take risks.</p>
<p>Major unresolved questions between the activist and
scientific communities still revolve around the validity of
various drugs in community trials, and the adequacy of
expanded distribution programs channeling experimental drugs
to patients.</p>
<p>A trial of the drug Compound Q or tricosanthin, an extract
of Chinese cucumber, by Martin Delaney and Project Inform
purported to show a trend toward rising counts of
infection-fighting T-cells among an uncontrolled group of 46
patients. However, data on all patients were mixed together,
averaged, and extrapolated in a way scientists immediately
attacked.</p>
<p>Arnold Relman, editor of the New England Journal of
Medicine, publicly chastised the activist. "Mr. Delaney, you
are irresponsible. Publish your data and let the chips fall
where they may. Your claims are undocumented, untested and
uncontrolled."</p>
<p>Mr. Delaney, still insisting the drug is promising, said
he plans to publish his data in a medical journal soon. So
far, six of 51 early patients suffered dementia while on the
drug, two progressing to coma, with one coma patient dying of
pneumonia after regaining consciousness.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the jury is still out on academic center trials
of the pure synthetic form of the drug by Genelabs Inc. of
Redwood City, Calif. In a study at San Francisco General
Hospital, 18 patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex
(ARC) tolerated the drug well except for one patient who
suffered "a severe neurologic catastrophe" and died of
uncertain causes 118 days after treatment. Overall, the
patients' immune status was unchanged after the treatment,
researchers reported.</p>
<p>"Parallel track" programs to distribute experimental drugs
even while tests proceed to check effectiveness, promise to
be the subject of continuing wrangling between scientists,
companies and activists. The activist group ACT UP has
attacked Roche's plan to give away the drug DDC as too
narrow, an attack a company spokesman described as "an
affront" to all who worked to bring it about.</p>
<p>But there were moments of unexpected rapprochement too.
Ellen Cooper, a scientist and the Food and Drug
Administration's main liaison with activists on drug
development, has often been reviled by ACT UP as a villain.
But when ACT UP member Jay Lipner on Saturday commended her
role in broadening access to drugs, activists applauded. "I
knew then that hell had frozen over," said an astonished
federal scientist.</p>
<p>The AIDS conference has become the scene of a major trade
show over the years, with major drug companies mounting slick
presentations, next to unconventional products such as a
female condom, and whimsical items such as a Bart Simpson
T-shirt depicting the TV urchin sporting an earring and
purple cape, and saying "AIDS is a global crisis, dude."</p>
<p>Unusual research alliances also were spawned this year,
such as a study of venereal disease in prostitutes, sponsored
by UCLA at the Chicken Ranch Brothel of Pahrump, Nev.</p>
<p>A raucous demonstration last week highlighted the need to
bring more women into experimental drug trials. "Women with
AIDS can't wait till later, we are not your incubator,"
protesters chanted. Dr. Daniel Hoth, of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, replied that he
was promoting plans to bring more women into studies as "a
matter of access, not science" since he said there's little
evidence that women -- except during pregnancy -- react
differently to drugs from men.</p>
<p>While conceding that activists have important
contributions to make to the research dialogue, Dr. Fauci
gently warned them not to overdo it.</p>
<p>"It is particularly devastating when scientists of good
faith and enormous talent have been singled out and denounced
as scoundrels," he said.</p>
<p>Giovanni Rossi, chairman of the 1991 AIDS conference
planned for Florence, Italy, unveiled as his conference logo
an image of Michelangelo's David, and won applause for an
optimistic prediction.</p>
<p>"David was fighting a giant that was threatening his
culture," he said. "He won his battle against Goliath. So
will we."</p>
