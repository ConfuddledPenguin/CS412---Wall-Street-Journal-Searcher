   Money Does Not Grow on Farms</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">James Bovard's May 22 editorial-page article, "Welfare for
Millionaire Farmers," perverts statistics in order to attack
the world's most efficient and savvy entrepreneurs --
American farmers.
   Mr. Bovard correctly attacks the Agriculture Department's
definition of a farmer -- anyone who sells more than $1,000
in agricultural commodities. He then goes on to say that "it
is hobby farming, not commercial farming, that is shrinking."
He errs in not realizing that many of these hobbyists farm in
hopes of one day accumulating enough operating capital to
farm full time. The knowledge necessary to farm successfully
is gained from many years of experience, and the ranks of
future full-time farmers will be filled by many of those able
to make the conversion from hobby farming.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bovard also absurdly states that a farmer can raise a
$40,000 crop of corn in only seven weeks. As a practicing
agronomist with years of experience in helping farmers to
produce corn more efficiently, I believe Mr. Bovard lacks
real knowledge of agricultural production. If he truly knows
how to raise a $40,000 crop of corn in seven weeks, please
have him call me as soon as possible. This information would
revolutionize corn production.</p>
<p>In a cheap shot, Mr. Bovard suggests applying the same
means tests to farmers that are applied to other recipients
of federal handouts. Did Mr. Bovard ever consider the
contribution farmers make to society as opposed to the
average welfare recipient? In many states, agriculture is the
leading industry and "millionaire" farmers are responsible
for supporting those employed in transporting, processing and
delivering food products to the American consumer.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Bovard says farm programs cost the consumer
an additional $10 billion in higher food prices -- equivalent
to more than $80,000 for each full-time farmer. In reality,
the vast majority of this money went to food processors who
took advantage of weather scares to raise prices, while the
prices paid to farmers for their commodities in 1988 were in
many cases lower than in many previous years.</p>
<p>It is true that farm programs could use revision in
appropriate areas. However, the responsibility for any past
abuse of farm or subsidy programs rests squarely on the
shoulders of politicians who benefit from a cheap food supply
for consumers. This cheap food supply induces the political
stability that allows incumbent bureaucrats to stay in office
year after year. As long as bureaucrats make American farm
policy, it is naive to believe that agriculture will ever be
a free-market system.</p>

<p>Mr. Bovard's article is misleading and unjustified.</p>
<p>As an attorney for 43 years in northeast Nebraska, I have
never once encountered in my county a farmer who had an
estate valued at $1 million or more. Also, our office
prepares income-tax returns, including returns for farmers,
and we have not encountered the high income-tax figures
stated by Mr. Bovard. We consider northeast Nebraska to be
one of the better farming areas in the Middle West, but these
income figures are ridiculous and untrue.</p>

<p>Mr. Bovard's is a view that is being printed all too
frequently.</p>
<p>I am a third-generation wheat farmer in Oregon, who after
40 years has a balance sheet that indicates that
million-dollar figure in the article. But what does that
really mean? It means that the factory or business or place
of work, whatever you want to call it, costs that much to
provide an economic unit.</p>
<p>Am I getting rich on government farm programs?
Farm-program payments result because the market price is
below the cost of production, and rural America gets in
financial trouble, which also affects the national economy.
An ever-increasing national debt can trace a considerable
part of its origins to a failure to monetize farm commodities
properly.</p>
