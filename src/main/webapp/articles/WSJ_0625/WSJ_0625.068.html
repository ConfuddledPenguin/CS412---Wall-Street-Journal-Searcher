	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Dallas Semiconductor Corp. said that all
lawsuits between it and SGS Thomson Microelectronics Inc.
have been settled and that the two companies have entered
into a comprehensive, patent cross-licensing agreement.
   Dallas Semiconductor, a specialty chip maker whose
personnel include several former employees of SGS-Thomson's
predecessor, sued SGS-Thomson in state court in January over
a 1986 agreement to swap proprietary information. SGS-Thomson
responded with a suit in federal court, charging patent
infringement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under terms of the patent cross-licensing agreement,
confirmed by SGS-Thomson, all state court litigation has been
dismissed, and a consent judgment has been entered in federal
court.</p>
<p>Dallas Semiconductor said the cross-licensing agreement
covers virtually every patent owned by both companies.</p>
