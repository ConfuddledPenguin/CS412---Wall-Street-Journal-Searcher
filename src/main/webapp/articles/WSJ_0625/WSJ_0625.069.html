	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Conston Corp., a women's apparel retailer,
said it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection in
federal court here after failing to attract investors or
buyers.
   Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor
lawsuits while it works out a plan to repay its debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chairman Charles Conston said management had been looking
"vigorously" for investors or buyers since June 4 and decided
to file for Chapter 11 when those efforts failed.</p>
<p>The company said it had a net loss of about $10.5 million,
or $1.38 a share, for its year ended March 30 and that sales
have continued to decline in the current year.</p>
<p>The company said it has arranged for the sale of its
inventory and has hired a specialist to help it recover from
insolvency and return to business.</p>
<p>The company didn't disclose the amount of its liabilities
or identify its creditors.</p>
