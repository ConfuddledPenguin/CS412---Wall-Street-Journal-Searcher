	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- Dayton Hudson Corp. said it has completed
the $1.05 billion purchase of Marshall Field & Co. from B.A.T
Industries PLC.
   The acquisition of the Chicago-based department-store
chain was delayed because of a request for more information
from the Federal Trade Commission, which examines proposed
transactions to see if they violate antitrust laws. The
retailer said the FTC notified the company that the waiting
period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Premerger Notification Act
has terminated.</p>
