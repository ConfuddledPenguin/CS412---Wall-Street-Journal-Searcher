	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A federal bankruptcy judge agreed to decide
whether the Bankruptcy Court should get involved in efforts
to buy investment partnerships managed by Integrated
Resources Inc.
   Judge Howard C. Buschman III, who is overseeing
Integrated's bankruptcy proceeding, set a July 19 hearing on
whether to block CRI Inc.'s bid to buy the partnerships. The
Rockville, Md., real estate syndicator has proposed to
exchange shares in two ventures it manages for investors'
holdings in four partnerships managed by Integrated.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If CRI's offer succeeds, the company then plans to oust
Integrated as manager of the investments. It also has sued in
Delaware and California to force Integrated to reverse
changes in its management contract adopted just a day before
Integrated filed for protection from creditors in February.
CRI's offer is conditioned on those changes being reversed.</p>
<p>The partnerships, known as American Insured Mortgage
Investors, have about 64,000 investors. Integrated receives
income from managing the partnerships and owns an interest in
the businesses as a general partner. The partnerships, which
CRI has estimated are worth $664 million, aren't part of the
bankruptcy proceeding.</p>
<p>At a hearing last week, the judge didn't issue a temporary
restraining order sought by Integrated. But he set a hearing
date to consider whether to issue a preliminary injunction.</p>
<p>Judge Buschman indicated he would consider at that time
whether a federal Bankruptcy Court should issue an injunction
in a dispute involving the limited partners who aren't a part
of the bankruptcy proceeding. He also said he would consider
examining whether he should issue an injunction taking into
account CRI's refusal to participate in Integrated's auction
of its management contracts and direct interests in the
partnerships.</p>
<p>In February, CRI offered as much as $60 million for the
contracts and direct interests but was turned down by
Integrated, which said the offer contained too many
contingencies. This month, Integrated recommended a $45
million offer from Krupp Cos., a Boston real estate
investment manager. That offer is conditioned on CRI's
proposal being ended.</p>
<p>Integrated's attorneys argue that CRI's tactics are an
attempt to "bust up" the auction. And, they said, CRI's
proposal to buy the limited partnership investments could
reduce the value of Integrated's interests by an amount they
said CRI estimated at $25 million.</p>
<p>In its suits, CRI charged that the managment contract
changes "entrench" the general partners. CRI has said the
changes allow for the management fee to be reset by a third
party designated by Integrated if Integrated is removed as
general managing partner by a vote of the limited partners.
Integrated has said the changes could benefit the limited
partners by allowing lower management fees to be set.</p>
<p>Integrated manages more than 600 partnerships and values
its assets at about $700 million. The company is trying to
sell assets to satisfy creditors, who are owed about $1.8
billion.</p>
