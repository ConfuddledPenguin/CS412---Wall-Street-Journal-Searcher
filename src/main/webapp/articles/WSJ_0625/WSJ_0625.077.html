	<p class="article-leader">The controlling shareholders of First Brands Corp. said
they were seeking buyers for all or part of the company,
setting off a 20% runup in the share price.
   In a filing last week with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the holders, which include CS First Boston Inc.
and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., said they would actively
solicit bids for all or a portion of the consumer products
company's shares or assets. The holders also indicated they
might consider selling their stake in another public
offering.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, First
Brands shares closed at $28.375, up $4.75. About 1.8 million
shares traded Friday, making First Brands the fifth most
active Big Board stock. At the closing price, First Brands
has a total indicated value of $613 million for the more than
21.6 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>First Brands, based in Danbury, Conn., manufactures and
markets such products as Prestone anti-freeze, Glad plastic
bags and STP automobile additives. It was created in a
leveraged buy-out of these businesses from Union Carbide
Corp. in 1986. In December the buy-out group, which includes
company management and other individuals, sold 30% of the
company in a public offering.</p>
<p>At the time of the buy-out, the investors' equity was
about $80 million, according to Donald DeSantis, vice
president and chief financial officer at First Brands. A 30%
stake in the equity was then about $24 million. The public
offering of the 30% stake, at $19 a share, netted the
investors $115 million -- almost a fivefold return.</p>
<p>The timing of Friday's announcement by CS First Boston and
Metropolitan Life, which together hold about 48% of the
shares, surprised some analysts, who wondered why such a move
wasn't made when the 30% stake was offered in December.</p>
<p>The stock's runup also was unexpected. Pat O'Brien, who
follows Union Carbide for Anantha Raman & Co., was surprised
at the share price jump because "the company has been on the
block from day one."</p>
<p>Spokesmen for CS First Boston couldn't be reached for
comment Friday. Metropolitan Life officials declined to
comment. In the SEC filing, the investor group said that
while it still thinks the shares are "an attractive
investment," it has "received expressions of interest" from
third parties.</p>
<p>First Brands reported an 83% decline in profit for its
fiscal third quarter ended March 31, to $2.7 million, or 12
cents a share, but the company said the results were
distorted by gains from the sale of certain businesses in the
year-earlier period. The company started up heavily in debt,
and posted a loss of $7 million on sales of $837 million in
1987. Cost cutting and quality improvements led to a $61
million profit in 1989 on sales of $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Mr. DeSantis said that he wasn't surprised at the move by
the major investors. "But the timing is a bit sooner than we
thought," he said.</p>
<p>"Typically, investment bankers are not long-term
investors," Mr. DeSantis said. "One possibility, which would
be good for the business, would be to find a permanent home,
rather than be controlled by financial investors."</p>
<p>According to the fiscal third-quarter statement, First
Brands' long-term debt was $370.7 million, down from $434.4
million at June 30, 1989.</p>
<p>Ms. O'Brien noted that CS First Boston led the buy-out
creating First Brands under pressure to assist Union
Carbide's defense against a hostile takeover bid from GAF
Corp. "When the investment banks started taking ownership, it
was one of the signs that the price was too high. These
people would rather be back to their own business rather than
run a polyethylene bag business," she said.</p>
<p>The most likely buyer would be one with a strategic
interest, "a chemical company seeking vertical integration,
or an offshore company that wants our company's distribution
strength," Mr. DeSantis said.</p>
