	<p class="article-leader">Two years before the 1964 Civil Rights Act was passed,
local construction unions in Washington, D.C., prevented
black electricians from working on one of the capital's
premiere building projects: the Rayburn House Office
Building. This week in that very same building the House
Subcommittee on Labor Standards will be working on
legislation that will perpetuate discrimination in the
construction industry. Instead, that legislation should be
repealed, once and for all.
   At issue is the 1931 Davis-Bacon Act. Davis-Bacon requires
contractors to pay all workers on federally funded
construction projects valued at more than $2,000 the
"prevailing wage" for that type of work, as determined by the
U.S. Department of Labor. In practice, the Labor Department
uses local union wage scales as a proxy for the "prevailing
wage." Thus, any laborer who does not have the skills to
command union scale is frozen out of these jobs. Typically,
those frozen out are black or Hispanic.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The original supporters of the law could not have hoped
for more -- because, as the historical record shows,
Davis-Bacon was written to prevent black workers, mostly from
the South, from competing with the Northern construction
trades.</p>
<p>So far, debate on Davis-Bacon has focused primarily on its
costs, the estimated $1.5 billion it costs U.S. taxpayers to
pay union scale when qualified workers are available at lower
rates. But that complaint avoids the real evil of
Davis-Bacon: discrimination against black Americans.</p>
<p>The original Davis-Bacon Act was drafted in 1927 by New
York Rep. Robert Bacon after an Alabama contractor won the
bid to build a federal hospital in Bacon's district. As Bacon
reported at the first hearing on his bill, "The bid . . . was
let to a firm from Alabama who brought some thousand
non-union laborers from Alabama into Long Island, N.Y., into
my congressional district." What he meant, of course is that
many of the workers were black -- and willing to work for
less than local building tradesmen.</p>
<p>Bacon's complaints brought a knowing smile from Georgia
Rep. William Upshaw, who commented: "You will not think that
a Southern man is more than human if he smiles over the fact
of your reaction to that real problem you are confronted with
in any community with a superabundance or large aggregation
of Negro labor."</p>
<p>Four years later during the floor debate on the bill,
Alabama Rep. Miles Allgood echoed Upshaw's sentiments: "That
contractor has cheap colored labor . . . and it is labor of
that sort that is in competition with white labor. . . . This
bill has merit . . . it is very important that we enact this
measure."</p>
<p>There was little difference between the language of Reps.
Upshaw and Allgood and the language of an 1857 petition from
white tradesmen to the Atlanta city council. "We, the
undersigned, would respectfully represent . . . that there
exists in the city of Atlanta a number of men who . . . are
of no benefit to the city. We refer to Negro mechanics {who}
. . . can afford to underbid the regular resident mechanics .
. . to their great injury. . . . We most respectfully request
{the council} afford such protection to the resident
mechanics."</p>
<p>Blacks dominated the skilled trades in the South after
emancipation: In some trades there were five times as many
black workers as whites, according to one estimate. In
response, white workers used every political tool available
to restrain black competition. In some cases, officially
sanctioned licensing boards were established to "ensure the
quality of local tradesmen." In other cases, whites sought to
outlaw blacks from practicing specific trades, and even
passed laws to prevent the recruitment of black laborers by
Northern employers.</p>
<p>But, until the passage of Davis-Bacon, the federal
government's policy of accepting the lowest bid on
construction projects allowed black laborers to compete
freely for federal work. Many blacks traveled great distances
and endured harsh conditions for the chance to work, as Rep.
Bacon discovered. The Davis-Bacon Act put a sudden end to
this. Following enactment of Davis-Bacon, black tradesmen
were shut out of many federal construction projects. Of the
4,100 workers on the Boulder Dam project in 1932, only 30
were black.</p>
<p>Blacks were also shut out of the massive public housing
projects sponsored by President Roosevelt's Public Works
Administration. Roosevelt sent representatives to Chicago to
institute a quota system which required that a minimum
percentage of a project's payroll be directed toward black
tradesmen. The result: The blacks got all the low-pay,
unskilled positions.</p>
<p>Despite all the civil rights laws on the books today,
little has changed. According to Ralph C. Thomas III,
executive director of the National Association of Minority
Contractors, "The law in its current form is poison to
minority contractors {and to} minority employment in general
. . . . The law stifles the minority contractors' efforts to
not only hire as many minority workers as possible, but it
also hinders minority contractor efforts to introduce new
workers to the construction field."</p>
<p>Mary Nelson, director of Bethel New Life Inc., a
church-affiliated social service organization in Chicago, has
found that Davis-Bacon adds as much as 25% to her total
budget and often prevents her from using the local unskilled
poor to help refurbish the projects they themselves live in.
Robert Woodson, president of the National Center for
Neighborhood Enterprise, reports that public housing
residents who want to help refurbish their own apartments
often are forced to "volunteer" half a day's work in order to
avoid Davis-Bacon requirements.</p>
<p>Davis-Bacon was intended to discriminate against blacks,
and that is precisely what it has done. It's time for
Washington to bid good-bye to Jim Crow.</p>
