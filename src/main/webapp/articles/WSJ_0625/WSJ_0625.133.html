directors, alleging violations of security laws.
   The suit, filed in federal district court in Portland,
Ore., accuses Tektronix of "withholding material adverse

1990. The electronics equipment maker didn't elaborate on the
lawsuit, calling it "entirely without merit."</p>

13,000 work force and said it was taking a one-time charge of
$70 million against its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings, as a
result of slumping sales. It hasn't announced earnings for
that quarter, ended May 26.</p>

posted a loss of $25.5 million, or 88 cents a share, on
revenues of $421.8 million. It earned $6.4 million, or 22
