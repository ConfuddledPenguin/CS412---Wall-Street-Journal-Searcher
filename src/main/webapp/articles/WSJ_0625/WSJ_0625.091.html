	<p class="article-leader">In most struggling regions, scared and angry entrepreneurs
voice their frustrations mainly to each other. But in Tucson,
Ariz., they are marching on city hall.
   Angry at the effects of a credit crunch, regional economic
slowdown and government policies, Tucson entrepreneurs
organized the Tucson Business Coalition last February to
fight back. Leaders of the grass-roots organization say
membership is already at 1,400 and still growing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In April, the coalition organized a protest march to a
city council meeting by several hundred business people, who
wore buttons and carried banners and signs in the coalition's
colors of red and black. The black, says an organizer, is to
mourn the businesses that have died while red is for the ones
still alive but bleeding.</p>
<p>Being law-abiding citizens, marchers were careful to stay
on the sidewalk and cross with the lights, organizers add.
Confronted with a mass of angry business owners, the council
moved to the nearby convention center to hear them out. A
similar march was held the next day to Pima County's board of
supervisors meeting.</p>
<p>"We haven't had much help from the big boys. So we are
going to do some things on our own," says Byron Howard,
coalition co-chairman and owner of B&H Properties, a local
land-developer.</p>
<p>Similar groups are forming in other Arizona cities, say
coalition leaders, and the protest may eventually go
nationwide. "We would like to take this movement right into
Washington, D.C.," says Bruce Greer, the coalition's other
co-chairman and owner of Bruce Greer Construction Inc.</p>
<p>Some observers believe the ground is getting more fertile
for such militancy. "There is a rising anger among
small-business people" over government-imposed costs and
tight credit, says John Galles, executive vice president of
National Small Business United, a 67,000-member advocacy
group based in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher earlier this month
said a "serious" credit crunch is beginning to grip small
business and other sections of the economy.</p>
<p>However, Tucson coalition leaders are finding their
message isn't universally welcomed. For instance, Mr. Greer
says some of his construction equipment was recently
vandalized. He says the grafitti on the machines indicated it
was done by people who objected to some of his
pro-development stands on behalf of the coalition.</p>
<p>The coalition aims to prune the size and cost of
government and get it out of competition with private
enterprise. It also hopes to lessen the dependence of small
businesses on big financial institutions; coalition members
assert the institutions have turned their backs on lending to
small businesses. Local bankers reply that they are still
interested in lending to small businesses but say the slowing
economic growth rate has hurt the ability of many firms to
qualify for loans.</p>
<p>Dozens of coalition members are spending evenings and
weekends combing through city and county budgets looking for
spending for the governments to slash. The coalition is even
trying to set up an alternate banking arrangement for members
through a local credit union.</p>
<p>Tucson Mayor Thomas Volgy decries some of the group's
"slash-and-burn" tactics, but says it is emerging as a force
to be reckoned with. Mr. Volgy says the coalition's rise
helped kill a recent move to increase business licensing
fees. Because of the coalition, "government is much more
sensitive on a day-to-day basis to the needs of small
business," he says.</p>
<p>Tucson's business problems can be traced to the boom times
of the mid-1980's when Arizona was one of the U.S.'s
fastestgrowing states. Then, the biggest credit problem was
finding ways to spend the multimillion-dollar loans that
banks and thrifts were spewing out.</p>
<p>All that easy money led to some business binges,
especially in real estate. Now Tucson is feeling the
hangover. While population and income levels are still
growing at about 2% a year, that's only a third of the rate
of the mid-1980's. Since most businesses had geared up for
the faster growth, the slowing "feels like a recession," says
Marshall Vest, an economist at the University of Arizona.
Bankruptcy filings in metropolitan Tucson last year hit a
record 3,700 and in the first quarter of this year were up
another 27%, he says.</p>
<p>Exacerbating the slower pace, most of the state's major
savings and loans have been taken over by the federal
government and have adopted lending procedures that make
Uncle Sam look like Uncle Scrooge. Tucson residents joke that
the government has taken the "L" out of their S&L's.</p>
<p>While commercial banks are in better shape, they also have
turned more cautious, Tucson business people and economists
say. Georgia Carlson and her husband, Glenn, recently
discovered just how cautious when their bank told them it was
calling in the $500,000 credit line on their two businesses,
which supply various items to the construction industry.</p>
<p>Mrs. Carlson says the businesses have never missed a
payment on the credit line. But both were hard hit by the
construction downturn, and the Carlsons' banker told them
their firms "had become bad risks," Mrs. Carlson recalls. She
says that unless they can come up with some way to pay off
the outstanding bank balance, they face bankruptcy and
possible loss of their home. (The credit line was personally
guaranteed.) "I'm damn mad and I'm not going to take this,"
says Mrs. Carlson, a leader in the business coalition.</p>
<p>Such anger was a driving force behind the coalition's
formation. But the specific catalyst came from a local
talk-radio show that began airing small-business owners'
complaints. Then the station, KTUC, decided to hold a
luncheon earlier this year where business people could give
local politicians a piece of their mind. "People told me we
would be lucky to get a couple of dozen people there,"
recalls Tom Hassey, KTUC's owner.</p>
<p>Some 500 showed up, along with most major local
politicians. Attendees say the business people ran out of
time before they ran out of gripes. For instance, Nicholas
Locastro, a restaurant owner and coalition activist, says his
property taxes more than doubled since 1983 and his liquor
license fees went up 50% in the past two years.</p>
<p>Given the outpouring, some entrepreneurs decided an
organization was needed. "Instead of just lone whining
businessmen, we thought we'd at least have a bunch of whining
businessmen," jokes Jim Hilkemeyer, who operates two fitness
centers.</p>
<p>Membership in the coalition is restricted to locally owned
small businesses, says Mr. Howard, the co-chairman. "We
aren't the chamber of commerce or old guard," he says with
some disdain. "We want people who know what it is like to
have a Friday morning with a $150,000 payroll due and only
$30,000 in the bank."</p>
<p>Entree costs $25 and as much free time as an entrepreneur
can devote. Hundreds of volunteer hours are being put into
searching for ways to cut government budgets, merge
departments and privatize such activities as printing and
street construction. Mayor Volgy says the coalition's efforts
have led to a "department-by-department examination of what
is and isn't being contracted out."</p>
<p>Coalition leaders say they aren't sure how much lasting
change all this activity will produce. But it has already led
some business people to do things they wouldn't have dreamed
of a year ago.</p>
<p>Bob Jones, president and part owner of Apache Business
Systems Inc., says he always disdained protest marches and
made fun of participants. But when the coalition marched on
city hall, he was among the protesters. "I put my dignity
aside. We had to get {people's} attention," he says.</p>
