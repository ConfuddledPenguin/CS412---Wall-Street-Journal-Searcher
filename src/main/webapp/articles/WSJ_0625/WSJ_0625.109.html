	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French manufacturers have long enjoyed a lock on
the ultra-high end of the luxury-goods market, where the
super rich don Yves Saint Laurent evening garb, eat off
Limoges china with Christofle silverware and wash down foie
gras with a little Chateau Lafite-Rothschild '62.
   But the marketers of French
if-you-need-to-ask-the-price-you-can't-afford-it products are
getting worried. It's not exactly that they're hurting.
French brands control nearly 50% of this very high-margin,
$52 billion-a-year business. But a lot of the people who
don't need to ask the price are now wearing Romeo Gigli
clothes, dining off Royal Doulton plates and sipping
California Cabernet. "French companies can't be complacent,"
says Christian Blanckaert, president of the Comite Colbert, a
grouping of 70 of France's most exclusive brands. "This
industry doesn't just hum along by itself."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To see just how fierce the competition is, and figure out
what to do about it, the Comite Colbert commissioned a study
by McKinsey & Co. that is probably the most detailed snapshot
ever taken of this highly visible but little understood
retailing niche. The consultants chose 14 product sectors,
ranging from shoes to perfume to cars to tableware, and
sampled prices at stores in six countries (the U.S., France,
West Germany, Japan, Italy and Great Britain). To be defined
as "luxury," an item had to sell above an arbitrarily chosen
(and high) price -- for instance 6,000 French francs ($1,053)
for a ladies suit. A brand was deemed French if created and
first commercialized in France, even if it's no longer made
there.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, given these definitions, the French, who
invented a lot of the categories, led the world in nine of
the 14 sectors. They were second in three of them, third in
one, and out of the money only in automobiles, where neither
Renault nor Peugeot makes a car that costs as much as a
Porsche or Maserati. Besides autos, France is weakest in
porcelain, watches, shoes and cosmetics. The U.S. led the
luxury world only in cosmetics.</p>
<p>On the surface, France looks in the swim. The country's
share of the sectors it led in ranged from a definitional
100% for champagne to 59% for haute couture and deluxe
ready-to-wear fashions. It had market share of more than 40%
in eight categories; no other country topped 40% in more than
one. French brands accounted for 47% of the total market,
which grew an average 8% a year between 1985 and 1989. That
put it miles ahead of Italy with 14%, West Germany with 13%,
Britain with 12% and the U.S. with 9%. Business has been
particularly strong for the Comite Colbert's members. Last
year the 70 companies had combined sales of almost $4.8
billion, up 25% from 1988. Exports, which accounted for
nearly 70% of the companies' sales, rose 27%.</p>
<p>And yet all is not good news for the French. While the
home market is big and loyal -- French brands have 84% of the
French market -- Italians have been shunning their neighbors'
wares in favor of local high-priced products. And while
French companies have a 61% share of luxury sales in Japan,
where annual growth has been in the 7.5% range and is likely
to accelerate, some categories fare better than others: Of
all high-fashion, Western-made clothes imported into Japan in
1988, 56% came from Italy and only 15% from France.</p>
<p>"All French luxury-goods makers must beware of the
competition now," says Yves Martin, chief of the McKinsey
study.</p>
<p>The French also think they should do better in the U.S.,
even though they had 49% of the $17 billion in U.S. luxury
sales last year, by far the biggest single supplier, in a
market growing about 13% a year.</p>
<p>One specific problem in the U.S. is the rapid decline of
"better" department stores. Only a few of the French brands
can afford their own boutiques in enough places to cover the
vast American market. Most depend on corners or shelf display
in appropriately trendy stores, especially for clothing and
tableware. But McKinsey says the quick and tumultuous buying,
selling and closing of U.S. stores has confused the French
makers, who are trying to guess which retail chains will be
losers, and which will be good places to reach the ultra
rich.</p>
<p>Tempting as it is, the U.S. is also a crowded and
expensive market. Take perfume, for example. McKinsey found
that the number of new perfumes launched in the U.S. each
year has more than doubled, to 70 last year from 30 in 1980.
And the cost of getting a new perfume on the shelves and
appropriately advertised has skyrocketed from a typical
$300,000 in 1975 to a staggering $15 million now.
Increasingly, the U.S. perfume market is a battlefield for
newly formed luxury giants such as Yves Saint Laurent, now
backed by Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti, and LVMH Moet
Hennessey Louis Vuitton, the alcohol and luggage giant
controlled by Bernard Arnault.</p>
<p>Attacking the U.S. market while retaining an image of
exclusivity also is a continuing problem. Hermes, the
Paris-based leather and fashion goods house, is rich enough
to sell its $179 silk scarves and other products in its own
stores, including several in the U.S. Patrick Thomas,
director general, says the challenge is to maintain the
highest quality at whatever price, and expand the market
while "never tumbling into banality."</p>
<p>Krug, one of the grand old names in champagne, has enough
cachet that some vintages sell for $160 in Paris, nine times
the price of other champagnes. The company sells about 10% of
its high-priced bubbly in the U.S., and aims for more. But
Managing Director Remi Krug fears that a broad advertising
campaign should only hurt it's image as the Rolls-Royce of
champagnes. Instead, Krug has sent a small team to New York
to conduct intimate tastings for wine wholesalers and
aficionados. "Nothing splashy, nothing big," says the
managing director Remi Krug. "We'll progress from word of
mouth, taste by taste."</p>
<p>Not all French luxury goods makers have that luxury of
going slow and steady. France's market share in high fashion
-- where it all started -- has shrunk during the past five
years, at the hands mainly of Italian brands. Milan has
succeeded in creating an image of its clothes as fashionable
yet more utilitarian than the more-extravagant French
designs. Once-stodgy German clothes are gaining ever-more
respect, even from the French.</p>
<p>American jewelers and Italian silverware makers also have
gained share at French expense. In all 14 areas, Italian
brands have grown faster than French ones over the past five
years.</p>
<p>That worries the dozens of family enterprises that forged
the image of the French industry. "Fast growth is whetting
the appetites" of both foreign competitors and big
conglomerates, says Olivier Mellerio, who runs the Mellerio
jewelry company, founded by his ancestors back in 1613. "This
means more competition and more concentration at the same
time." Mr. Mellerio says family companies have a rich
tradition and valuable name, but often lack the money,
management structures and world-wide distribution arms at the
command of conglomerates.</p>
<p>So what should manufacturers do? Mr. Thomas of Hermes says
luxury goods makers and sellers must increasingly try to
create "new" luxury goods out of everyday products. He says
watches and shoes have already undergone such a
metamorphosis, becoming at the high end "works of beauty, not
just things that tell the time or protect your feet."</p>
<p>Likewise, McKinsey says French luxury-goods makers need to
"creatively manage their brands" by continuing to bet on high
quality and high prices for their basic products, but also
paying more attention to marketing and distribution,
advertising and line extensions. Spinning off new products
can generate cash to help shore up the basic brands, and lead
to new spinoffs, the report says.</p>
<p>McKinsey also recommends stepping carefully. For instance,
a high-fashion house bringing out a lower-priced line should
make the spin-off much cheaper, not sell it where the main
brand is sold, and give it a distinctive name and label so as
to not cheapen the image of the exclusive parent brand. Many
French couturiers, such as Christian Lacroix, who is backed
by Mr. Arnault, have successfully introduced separate
ready-to-wear and "deluxe" labels, both priced at fractions
of their showcase one-of-a-kind dresses.</p>
<p>But when the product involved has long sold mainly on
image, such an approach isn't for everybody. "Many luxury
groups have done very well with franchising or licensing,"
says Mr. Krug, "But for us, it would only hurt our name."</p>
