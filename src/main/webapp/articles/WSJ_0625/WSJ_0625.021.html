	<p class="article-leader">WILTON, Conn. -- Deloitte & Touche said it elected its
first new group of partners and principals since the merger
of Deloitte Haskins & Sells and Touche Ross & Co. last
December.
   The company, the third largest U.S. accounting firm, said
the size of the class, 100 members, is about the same as the
combined number admitted to the predecessor firms in recent
years. The firm has about 1,700 members.</p>
