	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Is growth overvalued?
   Growth stocks have been the darlings of 1990. They're at
the head of the market's climb to records this year, and some
of the growth stocks have soared two or three times as much
as broad market indexes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But second-quarter earnings reports loom on the horizon,
and many investors wonder if the markups on growth have
pushed prices too high. Stocks in the good-earnings-news club
weren't spared from Friday's 44.55-point, or 1.55%, knockdown
in the Dow Jones industrials. Wal-Mart Stores tumbled 1 to 61
1/4, a 1.6% decline.</p>
<p>The ratio of stock prices to per-share earnings for many
of these issues is more than double the 16.4 multiple on the
500 stocks in the Standard & Poor's index.</p>
<p>Home Depot, a high-growth company, is trading at a P-E of
38 times earnings, or 2.3 times the multiple of the S&P 500.
Wal-Mart Stores is trading at 30 times earnings, or 1.8 times
the S&P multiple. Bargain hunters are shocked by growth-stock
investors' ambitious earnings expectations.</p>
<p>"If we were coming out of a recession, it would be a time
to buy long-term growth prospects," says William Leugers,
president of Gradison Growth Trust. But, as he points out,
the economy looks closer to the end of an economic cycle than
the beginning. "We don't want to pay for growth," he says,
and an average P-E of 9 on Gradison's Established Growth Fund
shows he means it.</p>
<p>Gradison is making a bet on some cyclical stocks, such as
International Paper and Federal Paper Board, that its
stockpickers think can survive an economic downturn. Both of
those stocks trade at less than half the market P-E, yet both
companies have seen earnings rise more than 20% annually over
the past five years.</p>
<p>Growth-stock investors, who couldn't be happier this year,
won't argue that growth is commanding a high price. But, "Are
we overvaluing growth?" asks Eldon Mayer, chairman of Lynch &
Mayer, which manages $2 billion. "My answer is a clear and
resounding, `No.' "</p>
<p>Indeed, he argues that growth stocks are near record cheap
valuations. If that's true, the stock market could rise
further still with growth issues leading the way. Mr. Mayer
figures about 35% of the S&P 500 consists of growth stocks.
"If 35% of the market is going to be working its way higher,
it rules out a serious bear market," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Mayer's idea of growth stocks is shares of companies
with average annual earnings growth in excess of 15% over the
past five years, and no down years in that period; and
expected earnings growth for the next five years must exceed
15% annually. Recent returns on equity must be at least 15% a
year; and, finally, debt must be less than 50% of total
capitalization.</p>
<p>Yes, the earnings outlook for many companies is dim, Mr.
Mayer agrees. But something happened in the 1980s that will
allow companies with strong earnings ability to survive and
flourish in an economic slowdown.</p>
<p>"You've had an absolute mania in mergers and acquisitions
culminating in transactions that haven't even stood the test
of the short-term, never mind the long-term," says Mr. Mayer.
Conversely, many growth issues have clean balance sheets and
are grabbing market share from their highly indebted
competitors.</p>
<p>It was merger mania that caused many investors to dump
growth issues so they could bet on potential takeover
targets, Mr. Mayer says. "Every year," in the mid-1980s,
"they sold more growth stocks and bought more junk," he says.
That's one reason why the multiple of the top 50 growth
issues was only 1.3 times the S&P index in November 1988, a
historic low.</p>
<p>Mr. Mayer says growth stocks are worth their high
multiples. "If the rest of the world grows earnings at 5%,
and you can assemble a group of companies growing at 20%,
it's not outlandish that you should pay three or four times
the market multiple," he says.</p>
<p>That's not to say he isn't worried. Growth stocks have
caught on with large investors now. As big banks and
insurance companies jump on board the bandwagon, growth-stock
prices could balloon to multiples more than three times
greater than the market; the most recent time that happened
was in the "Nifty 50" rally of the early 1970s. But here's
the danger: If growth issues fall short of current
expectations, big investors might start dumping shares as
fast as they're buying them today.</p>
<p>Growth stocks are typically the most sensitive to earnings
surprises -- either positive or negative -- and to estimate
revisions, says Benjamin Zacks, executive vice president of
Zacks Investment Research.</p>
<p>"Even the slightest estimate reductions in Home Depot
would have a very significant price effect; and if the
company should report a negative quarterly earnings surprise,
investors would probably take the stock down 20%," says Mr.
Zacks. Home Depot is expected to earn $1.89 a share in fiscal
1991, up 33% from $1.42 a share in fiscal 1990.</p>
<p>Warren Shaw, managing director at Chancellor Capital
Management, owns many growth stocks, including Home Depot. He
thinks the stock may be getting a bit rich. But he is happier
betting that growth stocks will fulfill earnings expectations
than he would be putting money into stocks of companies tied
to economic growth; besides obviously being vulnerable to an
economic slowdown, he thinks many of these concerns have too
much debt.</p>
<p>"The issue you have to raise is, what's the risk of being
in growth stocks or not being in them?" says George Boyd,
director of quantitative research at Kidder Peabody. "Is not
the {greater} risk in the low-growth stocks, that value
investors have been buying for a long time?"</p>
<p>Interest rate changes and tax cuts can affect earnings
valuations dramatically, as they did in the early 1980s.
Taking into account current rates, and past valuations,
growth stocks "are fairly valued -- not rich or cheap," says
Mr. Boyd.</p>
<p>But Graham Tanaka, president of Tanaka Capital Management,
says many growth-stock bargains can still be found.</p>
<p>"We're beginning to see a two-tiered growth-stock market,"
he says. One tier contains the high P-E stocks that big
institutional investors have discovered. And the other
contains cheaper, sometimes smaller stocks that have been
overlooked by the crowd.</p>
<p>"You can buy the same kind of growth in Novellus
{Systems}" -- an over-the-counter semiconductor stock selling
at 1.16 times the market P-E -- as in some of the
high-profile stocks, he says. "The real opportunity is to
find them before brokerage houses and institutions put them
on their recommended list," he says. "And there are a ton of
them {still} out there. We feel like kids in a candy store."</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>The stock market ended the week the way it began -- with a
steep sell-off. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost a net
78.71 points this past week, down from the record of 2935.89
on June 15 and the biggest weekly decline since January.</p>
<p>Friday, the average traded in a narrow range most of the
day, mainly higher, then plunged more than 40 points in the
last half-hour as futures-related program selling kicked in
on heavy volume.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrials fell 44.55 to 2857.18, the
lowest level since the Memorial Day weekend. The late selling
surge was attributed to index arbitrage -- offsetting trades
in the stock and index-futures markets to profit from
differences in price between the two.</p>
<p>Traders said little stood in the way of the program
selling, because a number of institutions had already closed
the books on the second quarter and other activity was light.
Friday was the final day for many portfolio managers to make
trades that can be included in second-quarter statements.</p>
<p>New York Stock Exchange volume was 172.6 million shares,
the busiest day of the week. Declining issues outnumbered
advancers, 893 to 607.</p>
<p>Trading was especially heavy in American Telephone &
Telegraph, American Express and Philip Morris, accounting for
9% of total Big Board volume.</p>
<p>Philip Morris was one of only three stocks among the 30
Dow Jones industrials to close higher, up 3/8 to 44 3/4. The
company confirmed it agreed to an acquisition that fits with
a plan to expand international food business.</p>
<p>Dividend-related trades swelled volume in AT&T, the Big
Board's most active issue, which dropped 1 1/8 to 42 1/2.
American Express, second most active, rose 1/4 to 30 1/2
following an offering of 17.5 million shares.</p>
<p>International Business Machines fell 2 3/4 to 116 1/4;
Boeing slipped 1 5/8 to 57 3/8; General Motors tumbled 1 1/2
to 48; Merck slid 1 7/8 to 81 3/4; and United Technologies
dropped 2 1/8 to 58.</p>
<p>First Brands surged 4 3/4 to 28 3/8 after the company
disclosed that shareholders with about 70% of the common
shares plan to solicit takeover bids.</p>
<p>Beverly Enterprises advanced 5/8 to 5 7/8 after County
NatWest USA reiterated a buy recommendation on the stock.
Harley Davidson dropped 3/4 to 25 7/8, with 6.9% of the
company's common stock outstanding sold in a single block.</p>
<p>Eli Lilly rose 1/2 to a 52-week high of 79 1/2, on a
positive analyst report. Compaq Computer fell 3 3/4 to 120
1/4 on a report that sales of one of its products have been
slower than expected. Digital Equipment lost 2 1/2 to 83;
Hewlett-Packard dropped 7/8 to 46 7/8, and Motorola fell 2
1/8 to 86.</p>
<p>Four defense contractors moved lower on news that the
companies face possible debt-ratings downgrades by Moody's
Investors Service. Raytheon dropped 2 to 62 1/2; Litton
Industries plunged 3 5/8 to 71 1/2; McDonnell Douglas fell 1
1/4 to 34 1/2; and Lockheed fell 3/8 to 34 7/8.</p>
<p>MGM/UA Communications rose 5/8 to 17 1/8. Pathe
Communications sweetened its bid for the company.</p>
<p>Rayonier Timberlands fell 1 to 20 and IP Timberlands went
down 5/8 to 21 3/8 on news of a federal endangered-species
decision that is expected to curtail logging in the Pacific
Northwest.</p>
<p>Quaker Oats eased 1/2 to 48 1/4 on the company's
announcement that earnings for the fiscal year would be flat
to slightly lower than a year ago. Curtice-Burns Foods
slipped 5/8 to 17 3/4, also on news of expected lower
earnings.</p>
