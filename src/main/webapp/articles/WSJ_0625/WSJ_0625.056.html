	<p class="article-leader">BROOKFIELD, Conn. -- Photronics Inc. sold out a public
offering of 1,250,000 common shares at $10 apiece, but in
over-the-counter trading Friday, the shares fell below the
offer price.

manufacturer of photomasks fell 37.5 cents to $9.875.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Of the total, Photronics sold 1,050,000 shares and
shareholders 200,000. Photronics will use its proceeds from
the offering to cut debt and general purposes, said Senior
Vice President Michael J. Yomazzo. Photronics now has nearly
4.4 million shares outstanding. Prudential-Bache Capital
Funding, a group within Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., led
the underwriters.</p>
