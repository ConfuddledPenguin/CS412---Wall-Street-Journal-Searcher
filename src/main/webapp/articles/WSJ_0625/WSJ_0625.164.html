	<p class="article-leader">A huge, stinking pile of sleaze was heaved up by the
revelations in the HUD scandal recently, but there was never
much said about how such a thing could come to pass. The
conventional explanation given the public was that it mainly
involved political appointees who misused good programs. We
always thought the problem was more systemic, that it had to
do with the nature of government paid-for housing, real
estate development, the scale of money involved, and the
large claims politicians could make for deciding how that
money was distributed.
   Now, we think it can be fairly said that as Secretary of
Housing and Urban Development, Jack Kemp has been making a
good-faith effort to reform the public-housing system in ways
that benefit the poor first and the political-developer
interests only incidentally. However, talks collapsed last
week between Secretary Kemp and Congressional Democrats over
the current $17 billion housing bill. Mr. Kemp says the
Senate's version of the National Affordable Housing Act will
"institutionalize profiteering and political influence
peddling." Those are harsh words, but we think the concerns
voiced about what is happening to this bill deserve some
detailed attention.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week, Senator Alan Cranston, the main proponent of
the Senate version, said, "I believe that, in general, scarce
resources should go to the most needy." But the act does not
primarily target the estimated 3.8 million Americans who have
what are called "worst-case needs." These are people whose
incomes are no better than half that of their area's median
income, but who pay more than 50% of their income for rent or
who live in substandard housing.</p>
<p>The act's centerpiece, Housing Opportunity Partnership
grants, consolidates and eliminates several existing housing
programs. But HOPs diffuse some benefits away from the truly
needy and seem biased toward the construction alone of new
public housing. A Democratic article of faith is that merely
erecting the buildings equates with help for the poor.
Republicans, however, now emphasize the need to give poor
people an ownership interest in their housing, or an
incentive to own it. Call it the difference between having a
real home or what the public-welfare promoters call
"housing."</p>
<p>In any event, HUD estimates that only one-fourth of the
500,000 developments that would be funded by HOP would end up
with the lowest income groups. The bill's supporters "freely
admit that it is a supply program," says Mary Brunette, a
chief aide to Mr. Kemp. "HOP is meant to create a supply of
housing. And it's biased toward the type of new construction
or substantial rehabilitation that ultimately has the same
cost as new construction, that will create more public
housing units, regardless of whether there is a need in that
community for housing units, instead of focusing the
assistance on the low-income people who may need a rent
supplement to afford a unit of housing that already exists in
that community."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the bill greatly dilutes the administration's
attempts to move housing policy away from the status quo. The
core of the HUD proposal is called Homeownership and
Opportunity for People Everywhere (HOPE). HOPE would make it
easier for the poor to own their own homes, which in turn
would remove these units and their carrying costs from
government-controlled housing stock.</p>
<p>To start this, the administration had asked for $1.89
billion, but Congress slashed this amount to $330 million. A
vital component of HOPE called Operation Bootstrap, which
ties housing vouchers for the poor to child care, job
training and other self-help initiatives, has been reduced to
a pilot program.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most revealing difference is in the debate
over who actually benefits from the competing proposals. The
Senate proposal reduces by 40% the number of "worst-case"
individuals helped. It used to be that 100% of those who
received housing help met the worst-case requirements
described above. But in 1988, Congress cut that percentage to
90%, under the rubric of "tenant diversification." Now
Congress wants to cut this share down to 50%. Because of
this, only 65,000 more of the worst poverty cases will be
helped next year, while better-off people will gain access to
the housing. What's going on here?</p>
<p>The political calculation here is plain. Voter turnout is
very low among the poor. But the middle class votes heavily,
and it's the group that would be most helped by this new
restriction and that the Democratic Party is trying to
romance again. Senator Cranston refers to the "broad
spectrum" that the bill would help.</p>
<p>There also is the matter of letting the poor make their
own choices or letting the bureaucracy as Congress's agent
make the choices for them. Section 8 certificates, a type of
quasi-voucher program already in existence, have allowed many
poor people to choose where they want to live, with limited
restrictions. Currently, there is a 15% cap on the number of
"project-based" certificates, subsidies the poor can use only
if they are willing to live in a specific location. The
Senate's housing act removes this cap, so more of the poor
will be required to move into specific buildings, limiting
their ability to make choices. Landlords of these buildings
won't have much incentive to maintain them, since the tenants
are, almost too literally, a captive clientele.</p>
<p>The Senate bill (which is $4 billion over President Bush's
original request) leaves in place many of the problems that
existed during the time of the HUD scandals. The emphasis
isn't on people; it's on buildings and builders. The
intriguing irony is that Senate Democrats are fighting to
maintain the status quo, and a Republican HUD Secretary is
trying to reverse it.</p>
