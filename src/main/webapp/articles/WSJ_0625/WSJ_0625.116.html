	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.
creditors' committee asked a U.S. bankruptcy court to prevent
the company from liquidating assets until steps are taken to
guarantee that the creditors will have a say in reviewing the
transactions.
   In their request, the creditors accused Drexel of backing
out of a court-sanctioned oversight process that allowed
members of the committee to review liquidation proposals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Drexel filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
on Feb. 13. According to the motion, Drexel ended the
oversight arrangement on May 27, two days before Drexel's
brokerage unit and other subsidiaries joined the parent in
bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>The motion asks that a procedure be set up to ensure that
all liquidation proposals be reviewed by the creditors and
approved by the court. The end result, however, is likely to
be an agreement by Drexel and the creditors to reinstate a
review process similar to the previous arrangement.
Representatives of the creditors and Drexel said they expect
an agreement to be reached before July 19, when a hearing on
the motion is scheduled before U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge
Howard Buschman III in Manhattan.</p>
<p>"The committee is very eager to have the oversight
procedure back in place," said Wilbur Ross of Rothschild
Inc., the committee's financial adviser.</p>
<p>A Drexel spokesman said plans for a new review procedure
were already being made before the committee filed its
motion. He said Drexel wants to include the creditors of
several units as well as the parent's creditors in the review
process.</p>
<p>The creditors, in their motion, said that since the
oversight procedure ended one Drexel subsidiary has tried to
liquidate assets without informing the creditors or the
court.</p>
<p>The Drexel spokesman, however, said no transactions have
been pursued without notifying the committee or the court. He
said the company isn't currently liquidating assets and
doesn't plan to resume doing so until a new review procedure
including the creditors is adopted.</p>
<p>Mr. Ross said the committee also is concerned that Drexel
has missed some potential liquidation transactions in the
junk-bond market in recent weeks. He said that if the
oversight procedure was still in place, the creditors could
question Drexel about whether such transactions should be
made at this time.</p>
<p>The Drexel spokesman said the company has missed no such
opportunities. He said "there has been no compelling reason"
for the company to enter into any liquidation transactions
since the oversight procedure ended.</p>
