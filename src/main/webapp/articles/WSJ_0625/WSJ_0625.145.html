	<p class="article-leader">BALTIMORE (AP) -- A former real estate agent, Marilyn
Harrell, who was nicknamed "Robin HUD" after she claimed she
stole from the Department of Housing and Urban Development to
help the poor, was sentenced to 46 months in prison and
ordered to return $110,000 to the government.
   Ms. Harrell, 46 years old, had acknowledged taking $5.7
million, and pleaded guilty in January to stealing government
property and filing a false tax return. She was given the
sobriquet "Robin HUD" after claiming she gave most of the
money to charity.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But in passing the stiff sentence recommended by
prosecutors, federal Judge Herbert Murray said a "substantial
amount" of the money went to Ms. Harrell and her family. Ms.
Harrell told the judge this wasn't true. Her attorney,
Anthony Gallagher, a public defender, said the sentence would
be appealed.</p>
<p>As an escrow agent, Ms. Harrell collected money from the
sales of property purchased with HUD-guaranteed loans that
had been foreclosed. She became a symbol of mismanagement at
HUD during the Reagan administration, when the scandal broke.</p>
