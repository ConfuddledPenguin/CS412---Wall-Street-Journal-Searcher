	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- An international commission recommended
sharply lower radiation exposure limits for workers regularly
exposed to high levels of radiation.
   The International Commission on Radiological Radiation
Protection, which conducts research into the effects of
radiation on humans, said the risks from ionizing radiation
are about three times as high as was estimated a decade ago.
The organization, made up of scientists and physicians from
the industrialized countries, recommended lowering the
acceptable level of exposure to two rems a year, measured as
an average over five-year basis, from five rems a year. A rem
is a measure of radiation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which sets standards
for worker exposure levels in the U.S., currently sets a
limit of five rems a year with a maximum exposure of three
rems in any three-month period. An NRC official declined to
comment on the new recommendation pending review of the
commission's report.</p>
<p>The chairman of the international commission, Dr. Dan
Beninson of Argentina, estimated that 1.5 million people in
the U.S. were involved in occupations that would put them at
risk of exposure beyond the new suggested range. Dr. Beninson
said that people working in occupations such as nuclear plant
repair, medical radiology and uranium mining could be
affected.</p>
