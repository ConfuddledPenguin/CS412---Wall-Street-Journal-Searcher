	<p class="article-leader">MOLSCHLEBEN, East Germany -- Before Rainer Rauchmaul gets
around to opening the gate in the morning, a few Russians
have usually jumped the fence to check out what's for sale on
his lot.
   As both the organizer and a dealer in one of East
Germany's most colorful weekend "auto markets," Mr. Rauchmaul
takes the Soviet gymnasts in stride. He has to. They are
among his best customers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The Russians are obsessed with buying our cars," says the
East German. "It's too bad they don't have much money."</p>
<p>At least a third of the buyers that show up here on a
typical weekend morning are Soviet officers, who often try to
barter for cars with everything from diamonds to rifles. The
Soviets, drawn from the many military installations sprinkled
around the countryside, seem to realize their days here may
be numbered, and they are scrambling to buy things that will
have enduring value back home. Cars top the list.</p>
<p>"They're afraid they're going to be sent back to the
U.S.S.R. without anything to show for it," says Mr.
Rauchmaul, who sells used cars from his family's farmhouse at
the edge of the auto market.</p>
<p>The rule of thumb for Soviet buyers, it seems, is "the
bigger the better."</p>
<p>"They're hung up on prestige, just like people are
everywhere, and big cars mean prestige to them," says Frank,
a West German car dealer who requested anonymity. Frank,
sporting a bright pink polo shirt and a heavy gold chain,
says half his customers at Molschleben are Soviets. "They're
always looking at Mercedes, but most of them can't afford to
go for that much luxury," he says.</p>
<p>Besides Western cars, the Soviets are snapping up
Russian-made Ladas and Moskviches, which many East Germans
are trying to sell as the country surges toward monetary
union with wealthy West Germany. It isn't unusual to see rows
of Soviet-made cars parked outside the gates of Soviet
military installations -- belonging not to people on the base
but to East Germans hoping to attract buyers.</p>
<p>Even Soviets, however, won't buy East German Trabants. The
sputtering two-cylinder cars are nearly impossible to sell at
any price. "Mercedes good, BMW good, Trabant bad," says a
burly Ukrainian in broken German, when asked what he thinks
of the models on sale here.</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth, I wouldn't expect one of these
cars to make it all the way back to the Soviet Union,"
confesses an East German teen-ager, who nonetheless is trying
to sell his Trabant -- which features an assortment of racing
stickers and a Ford emblem plastered across the dashboard --
for 3,000 East marks (about $895, at official rates). Six
months ago, the car would have easily sold for four times
that or more.</p>
<p>Molschleben's auto market is a perfect setting for the
Soviets. Every weekend, as many as 400 cars converge on a
sprawling field at the edge of this tiny East German village
-- a piece of land belonging to Mr. Rauchmaul. He charges
each seller 10 East marks for the right to do business here.
Beyond that, he pretty much leaves everyone to do what they
like.</p>
<p>The result is a capitalistic free-for-all. Some locals
have set up refreshment stands to peddle a foul-tasting East
German pseudo-cola, while others sell tacky trinkets, such as
stuffed animals that cling to the insides of car windows.</p>
<p>The main business here, however, is used cars. Dozens of
West German car dealers have discovered the market as a
perfect place for unloading cars that they might not be able
to sell in the West, while East Germans use it to get rid of
old Eastern European models.</p>
<p>Mr. Rauchmaul, leading the way onto the lot, points to a
candy-apple red Moskvich that was once the pride of the
town's police chief. The policeman has already bought an
Audi, and the 1975 Russian model -- which features a gaping
hole in the floor next to the gas pedal -- is for sale for
3,000 East marks. "It will be bought," says Mr. Rauchmaul,
"but only by a Russian."</p>
<p>Of course, doing business with Soviets takes some getting
used to. Mr. Rauchmaul has been offered diamonds and even the
gold rings being worn by an officer's wife to sweeten a deal
put together by a cash-strapped Soviet. "I can't do these
sort of deals," says the East German, "because I have no way
of knowing what any of these things is really worth. I'm no
jeweler."</p>
<p>But that doesn't stop the Soviets from trying. Walking
down one of the rows of cars, Mr. Rauchmaul is nearly tackled
by a pair of Soviet officers who have already announced that
they intend to buy three cars today. They want to know what
Mr. Rauchmaul has to offer.</p>
<p>Like a benevolent candy-store owner who doesn't have the
heart to tell children that they don't have enough money to
buy a piece of chocolate, the East German dealer leads them
over to his cars. The men quickly zero in on a 10-year-old
brown Mercedes sedan. Besides cash, an officer quickly pulls
the gold necklace out of his shirt -- pointing to both this
and the gold ring on his finger. But negotiations falter. The
two Soviets head back out into the throng in search of more
attainable targets.</p>
