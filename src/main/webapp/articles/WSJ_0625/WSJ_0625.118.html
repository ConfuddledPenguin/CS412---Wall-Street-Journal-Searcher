	<p class="article-leader">Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, said it will reduce
staffing this year but declined to indicate how deep the cuts
will be.
   The bank holding company, citing the need to operate more
efficiently, said the move stems from a review begun earlier
this year of all business lines. Rumors of broad staff
reductions had raised concerns among Mellon employees, who
fear a repeat of across-the-board layoffs in 1987. After
posting an $844 million loss that year, Mellon cut its work
force to 16,700 from 19,259.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mellon said it is evaluating each department individually
and won't make an across-the-board cut. It said it has
already dismissed trust department employees.</p>
<p>Mellon returned to profitability last year, earning $181
million, or $3.33 a share. But some analysts have voiced
concern about how the bank will grow after cutting expenses
and shedding bad loans. A Mellon spokeswoman said the
impending dismissals don't stem from earnings problems but
reflect efforts to "fine tune" operations.</p>
