	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In the wake of his remarkable political
comeback at home, maverick Soviet politician Boris Yeltsin is
making another sort of comeback as well -- in the inner
councils of the Bush administration.
   After consistently dismissing Mr. Yeltsin publicly and
privately as an eccentric or even dangerous demagogue,
administration officials now say they are gaining a new
respect for the beefy radical. They cite his political skill
in winning election as president of the Russian republic when
mounting political woes are afflicting the man who is still
President Bush's favorite Soviet politician, Mikhail
Gorbachev.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For fear of offending the Soviet president, top officials
still won't publicly say a kind word about Mr. Yeltsin, who
has been Mr. Gorbachev's chief left-wing critic. But in
private they're much more positive about him now.</p>
<p>"There's been a certain evolution in people's views here
lately," says one important U.S. foreign policy official. "He
has shown a political adeptness that has made people here sit
up and think." A second senior official says: "He has to be
taken seriously. He represents real democratic forces in the
Soviet Union."</p>
<p>That isn't to say the U.S. is rooting for Mr. Yeltsin or
shying away from Mr. Gorbachev. All recent evidence points to
a continuing close tie between President Bush and the current
Soviet leader. The Bush administration doesn't even have a
post-Gorbachev plan. And the newest generation of Soviet
reformers -- such as Moscow Mayor Gavril Popov and Leningrad
leader Anatoly Sobchak -- rarely makes it onto the
administration's foreign policy radar screen, even though
many Soviet experts in the West view them as more genuinely
inclined toward democracy than either Mr. Gorbachev or Mr.
Yeltsin.</p>
<p>The new regard for Mr. Yeltsin is largely a result of
respect for the raw political skill and appeal he has
demonstrated in climbing from political oblivion to head
Russia, which occupies two-thirds of Soviet territory.</p>
<p>There is still grave doubt about his dedication to
Western-style government and economics and considerable
nervousness about his tendency to pop off in public.</p>
<p>U.S. officials weren't thrilled recently when Mr. Yeltsin
said he wanted Russia to have a foreign policy "independent"
of the Soviet Union's. And they are deeply skeptical when he
promises an unspecified market reform plan that he pledges
won't burden average citizens. But officials here are now
unwilling to write him off on the basis of some of these
off-the-cuff remarks. "We don't know what he'll produce,"
says a high official. "But we're taking a wait-and-see
attitude."</p>
<p>It was Mr. Yeltsin's blustery rhetoric that turned the
administration against him in the first place. Last
September, while visiting the White House and State
Department, he came across as disorganized and impractical in
talks with Mr. Bush, Secretary of State James Baker and
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft. Among other
things, he touted wild schemes -- proposing, for instance,
that U.S. companies build a million apartments in the
U.S.S.R.</p>
<p>The view of Mr. Yeltsin as simply an erratic populist was
reinforced by tales of heavy drinking during his U.S. tour
and by private criticism from Mr. Gorbachev right up through
the recent Washington summit, where the Soviet leader told
some U.S. officials Mr. Yeltsin was only a "destroyer" and
had no constructive reform proposals.</p>
<p>Even some leading Soviet liberals reinforced that view. "I
cannot imagine how Yeltsin could go to Washington and have
negotiations with Bush and Baker," says Andrei Kortunov, a
reformist Moscow foreign policy expert whose views are
followed closely in Washington. "It would be ridiculous,
because he doesn't know anything about foreign policy."</p>
<p>But one senior administration official now concedes that
the initial negative U.S. assessment was an overreaction and
that "Yeltsin isn't some drunken buffoon."</p>
<p>One reason for the cautious turnaround may be pressure
from U.S. conservatives, who have pressed the White House to
hedge its bets on Mr. Gorbachev. They argue that his
political survival isn't as crucial as it once seemed because
he might be succeeded by an even more liberal figure, notably
Mr. Yeltsin or Mr. Popov or Mr. Sobchak.</p>
<p>"We should not be comfortable about him {Mr. Yeltsin}, but
we should give him the benefit of the doubt," says Leon Aron,
a Soviet expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation who
is writing a book about Mr. Yeltsin. "For years, we've been
pining for a democratically elected leader there, and in
Yeltsin we've come closer than ever to having that kind of a
Russian politician. So we should have a cautious attitude,
but we can't dismiss him."</p>
