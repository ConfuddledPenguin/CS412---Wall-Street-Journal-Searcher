	<p class="article-leader">Henley Group Inc., moving forward in its plan to
liquidate, said it intends to dispose of as much as its
entire 38.5% stake in Itel Corp., a chunk of shares valued at
$381 million at current prices.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Henley said it plans to sell eight million to 16.7 million of
its 18.7 million common shares in the Chicago-based leasing
concern through a public offering "or otherwise."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A Henley spokesman, Norman Ritter, said the filing
includes the possibility that some of the Itel shares would
be swapped with current Henley holders for their Henley
shares. But at least some of the Itel stake will be sold, Mr.
Ritter said.</p>
<p>Henley, based in Hampton, N.H., said it plans to
contribute the remaining two million shares to Fisher
International Inc., a Henley subsidiary that Henley plans to
spin off.</p>
<p>Henley acquired the Itel shares in 1988 as part of a $1.2
billion cash and stock payment from Itel. In return, Henley
sold Itel its stake in Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. and
leasing operations, among other holdings.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Itel
shares fell 37.5 cents, to $20.375. Henley stock fell 25
cents to $31 a share in national over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>Itel officials couldn't be reached for comment, but
Henley's holdings weren't considered a threat to Itel. The
1988 transaction included a 10-year standstill agreement that
restricted how Henley could vote or trade its Itel stake.</p>
<p>At the time, Itel Chairman Samuel Zell asserted in an
interview that the terms of the standstill agreement meant
that Henley would be distributing its Itel shares to Henley
shareholders. But a Henley spokesman said at the time that
Henley planned to keep its Itel shares.</p>
<p>Henley's disposition of Itel shares fits with its current
plan to liquidate. Henley has said it intends to spin off its
Fisher Scientific Group unit and 35% of Pneumo Abex Corp. The
spinoff plan is being reviewed by the SEC.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the sale of any of the rest of the 16.7
million shares will be used to reduce Henley's huge debt load
of about $1.5 billion, a Henley spokesman said. Most of that
debt, about $1.03 billion, is Pneumo Abex's.</p>
<p>But Henley said its plans don't currently call for using
proceeds of the sale to lighten that load before the 35%
spinoff. At current market prices, the 16.7 million Itel
shares are valued at $340.3 million.</p>
<p>In addition to its railcar and container leasing
operations, Itel is involved in dredging, distribution and
wire making. It also invests in stocks of other companies.</p>
