	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A surging stock market probably helped push a
prominent index into the positive zone in May, but economists
caution against overoptimism.
   The index of leading economic indicators, the government's
chief economic forecasting gauge, is believed to have risen
as much as 0.7% in May, after a decline of 0.2% in April. But
the outlook for the week's only other major statistic, May
new home sales, calls for continued weakness.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The (leading) index is largely being driven by a record
month for the stock market," said Stephen S. Roach, senior
economist at Morgan Stanley & Co., New York. A jump in the
price of sensitive materials, as well as an increase in the
length of the workweek, are also believed to have contributed
positively to the index. Negative input to the 11-component
index is expected from unfilled orders, building permits and
money supply, among others.</p>
<p>Mr. Roach looked optimistically to the lengthened workweek
and the recent, unexpectedly large jump in May durable goods
orders as indications that "the manufacturing sector is
slowly starting to turn back up." On the other hand, he noted
that home building, which accounts for about 4.5% of real
gross national product, "is an area of lingering weakness."
The consensus view calls for new home sales to remain
unchanged, following a 1.6% drop in April-the fifth
consecutive month of declines.</p>
<p>"Housing is certainly a drag on the economy," said Cynthia
Latta, senior financial economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill, Boston.
She said several factors are depressing the housing sector.
In addition to the obvious chill of high mortgage rates, Ms.
Latta noted the "rediscovery of risk on the part of banks,"
and an aging population that demands less housing. Most of
the baby boomers are already housed and the current state of
the economy doesn't bode well for trading up anytime soon,
economists said.</p>
<p>Many analysts find it difficult to be cheerful about the
economy, in light of the housing slump and the on-again,
off-again auto industry. Autos and housing together account
for about 7% of GNP. "Really, we're looking to exports to
hold things together for the economy and keep our heads above
water," Ms. Latta said.</p>
<p>Last Friday's tepid consumer spending report for May did
little to encourage optimism. What's more, the government
revised downward its earlier reports on spending in March and
April. Consumption, which accounts for the single biggest
chunk of GNP, is the main engine of the eight-year economic
expansion. "We'll be lucky if consumer spending doesn't hurt
us in the second quarter," Ms. Latta said.</p>
<p>The most hopeful analysts read recent economic tea leaves
to mean the manufacturing sector may be bottoming out prior
to an upswing. But both optimists and pessimists are keeping
a keen eye on employment levels in manufacturing. The next
jobs report isn't due until Aug. 6, but an early survey of
economists found the median expectation calls for a drop in
factory payrolls of 10,000 jobs. The range of expectations
splits neatly from those expecting a drop of 50,000 to those
expecting an increase of 50,000 jobs.</p>
