	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd
Bentsen is surrounded by special-interest pleaders pushing to
extend a major corporate tax break. He is loving every minute
of it. "You really know how to get to a guy," he says with a
smile for the photographer they brought along. At the close
of the April meeting in his high-ceilinged office, he utters
the words that are music to every lobbyist's ears: "I'll do
everything I can."
   But what makes these lobbyists so successful is that most
of them aren't really lobbyists at all. Most are soft-spoken
professors from the University of Houston in Sen. Bentsen's
home state of Texas. They are here to support the
controversial research-and-development tax credit, a
billion-dollar-a-year break that especially benefits a few
dozen big-name corporations -- corporations that, not
coincidentally, are allied with the professors in an
organization called the Council on Research and Technology,
or Coretech.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unholy alliances between business and nonbusiness
interests are the latest thing in Washington lobbying. "The
difficulty of passing legislation has increased
exponentially," says Coretech's top professional lobbyist,
Stuart Eizenstat, who was President Carter's domestic-policy
adviser. "To make common cause with people who would not be
your traditional allies is important."</p>
<p>Money still talks in politics, but it may be about to talk
a little more softly. Congress is moving, perhaps as early as
this year, to reduce the import of campaign cash by
overhauling the entire campaign-finance system. With such
traditional avenues of influence as the political-action
committee falling into increasing disrepute, lobbying stands
at a crossroads. Corporate pleaders will have to rely less on
political contributions to make their case, and more on
subtler -- some might say more insidious -- means. The result
is likely to be more lobbying, not less, and of an
increasingly sophisticated kind.</p>
<p>Coretech represents the cutting edge of this new soft
sell. It doesn't even have a PAC, and doesn't contribute to
campaigns. Instead, it uses the services of a wide array of
modern lobbying specialists, including a publicist, two
scholars, a tax lawyer, video-production experts and, of
course, dozens of researchers from both corporate and
academic realms. "Lobbying is no longer somebody coming with
a bag full of money and laying it on a member's desk or
relying on personal contacts to have that member do you a
favor," Mr. Eizenstat says.</p>
<p>Coretech includes 72 universities and 46 companies. For
the universities, it lobbies to fatten the budget of the
National Science Foundation to $3 billion by fiscal 1993, a
$1 billion rise, and also to authorize an increase of
millions of dollars in U.S. spending on research facilities.</p>
<p>But its biggest issues are clearly corporate, and the bulk
of its $700,000 annual budget is bankrolled by businesses.
Universities become members for $2,000 each; corporate dues
run from $5,000 to $30,000, depending on the extent of
research expenditures.</p>
<p>For the companies, those dues seem a worthwhile
investment: Tax savings from the R&D credit for some of
Coretech's biggest corporate members, such as HewlettPackard
Co., Digital Equipment Corp., Merck & Co. and International
Business Machines Corp., have run into the tens of millions
of dollars a year. The average Coretech member saves at least
a few million dollars from it, officials say.</p>
<p>But critics say the tax credit -- given to companies that
raise their R&D spending by certain amounts -- is basically a
waste, a reward to big businesses for doing what they would
have to do anyway. "It's used frankly more for tax avoidance
than to spur research and development," says Rep. Brian
Donnelly, Democrat of Massachusetts. "In a market-driven
economy, these people are forced to invest by their desires
to make profits."</p>
<p>Rep. Fortney Stark, a California Democrat who is on the
tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, doesn't believe the tax
credit spurs research at all. He thinks it's notable that at
big pharmaceutical companies, for instance, budgets for
research and for advertising have been growing at about the
same rate, even though R&D carries a tax credit and
advertising doesn't.</p>
<p>Even advocates of the credit concede that it hasn't been
as effective as it could be. But that, they say, is because
it has been allowed to lapse periodically since it was
established in 1981. "I can't think of one discussion I've
had internally or externally that said, `What about the R&D
credit?' because we don't know if it's going to be there,"
says Robert Gilbertson, chief executive of Data Switch Corp.
"It's better than nothing, but you might as well forget it
because it's not doing any good. It's just throwing money
down a rat hole."</p>
<p>What Coretech really wants is a permanent extension of the
credit. Its method was on full display during its recent
Lobby Day. At Coretech's request, 108 scientists from 39
states had descended on Washington to meet with lawmakers and
their aides to put the best face on the tax credit.</p>
<p>Those present include corporate representatives, too, but
they tend to stay in the background. The lobby group's agenda
is carefully structured to include an effort to increase
federal funding for college research as well as extending the
corporate tax break.</p>
<p>At an 8 a.m. breakfast briefing, Kenneth Kay, Coretech's
executive director, gives his troops their marching orders.
The college members are specifically instructed to speak on
behalf of corporations, and vice versa. He also tells them to
emphasize that they are scientists, not lobbyists.</p>
<p>"But let me warn you, please, not to spend 15 minutes
doing that," he says. "One of the tests is to look at the
other person's eyes, and as soon as they start to glaze over,
back off."</p>
<p>Another test is to avoid overkill -- which isn't met in
the meeting with Democratic Rep. Thomas Downey: The
delegation is so heavy with Cornell University professors
from his home state of New York that the congressman is
miffed. "It's not by coincidence that you decided to tap my
natural inclination toward my alma mater," he says
sarcastically. "I appreciate being appreciated."</p>
<p>But by the end of the day, the results are in, and they
are good for Coretech. Its lobbyists have met with no fewer
than 150 lawmakers and 100 congressional staffers. And for
the most part, they report, they have gotten a sympathetic
hearing.</p>
<p>In seeking to keep the credit going, Coretech faces one
big problem. "There is no constituency for research," Mr.
Eizenstat says. "Our job is to create one."</p>
<p>One way Coretech does this is by forming a network of
home-state contacts in both the corporate and college
communities. Last year, Coretech spent a day training a few
dozen researchers in how to curry favor with lawmakers back
home, and how to give them credit in the local press for
their support. It was called an "adopt-a-member program."
Now, at the drop of a fax or in response to a phone call,
these people and others who care about research immediately
know best how to ask their legislator for help.</p>
<p>In 1987, the group hired two Brookings Institution
scholars to demonstrate that the R&D tax credit increases the
amount of research corporations do.</p>
<p>Anticipating criticism of the credit from Congress's
watchdog agency, the General Accounting Office, Coretech in
1989 retained a former staffer of the respected Congressional
Joint Taxation Committee to negotiate changes in the credit.
Thus, Coretech's alterations already were moving through
Congress by the time the GAO published its report.</p>
<p>Coretech also works behind the scenes to develop what Mr.
Kay calls "atmospherics" designed to improve the image of the
group and its issue. To appeal to academics, it has published
a pamphlet predicting a shortage of engineers and scientists.
To bring its message to a wider audience, it has produced a
videotape extolling increased federal subsidies for R&D,
featuring the lawmakers who sponsor its bills. And to
ingratiate itself with lawmakers, it sends the photographs it
takes during Lobby Day to newspapers back home.</p>
<p>Coretech's assiduous work paid off handsomely last
December when it learned that President Bush's budget
proposal would drop a related $800 million-a-year R&D tax
break having to do with how multinationals divide their
research expenses between U.S. and foreign operations.</p>
<p>Mr. Kay immediately initiated "a fire drill." Using
Coretech's network, he quickly drummed up letters and
telephone calls to a variety of Bush administration officials
to urge them to include the provision. Mr. Eizenstat and some
congressional allies also made calls, and the tax break was
eventually fully restored.</p>
<p>To try to prevent the episode from recurring, Coretech
recently hired a Republican lobbyist, Craig Fuller, who as
Mr. Bush's former vice presidential chief of staff has close
ties to officials in the administration. The trouble with the
allocation rules "clearly was a wake-up call," says Mr. Kay,
a former aide to Sen. Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana.</p>
<p>Still, Coretech's lobbyists find that in an era of
budgetary constraints, keeping the tax credit is a continuing
struggle. Even its friends offer words of caution. "It's this
overall deficit," Democratic Rep. Michael Andrews of Texas
tells a delegation on Lobby Day. "All too often these issues
are driven by revenue; the merits of the issue are
secondary."</p>
<p>Last year, the House and the Senate Finance Committee both
voted to make the R&D credit permanent. But only a week after
the finance committee vote, the Senate stripped every
revenue-losing provision from its tax bill, including R&D.
Under pressure to reduce the budget deficit, Congress
ultimately decided to extend the credit for only the
equivalent of nine months. Mr. Eizenstat refers to the
episode as creating "the shortest permanent tax credit in
history."</p>
<p>This year Coretech is trying again for a permanent
extension. President Bush, Sen. Bentsen and the House's top
tax-writer, Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of
Illinois, have all come out in favor of it. But while it has
a decent chance, it is far from a done deal. For one thing,
Mr. Rostenkowski's support is still shaky; he has had doubts
about the credit's usefulness in the past, and this year is
focusing his efforts on deficit-reduction, demanding that any
tax cuts be fully paid for.</p>
<p>Coretech goes out of its way to soften up the chairman.
Lobby Day participants stay in town an extra night to meet
with the Chicagoan. At the session, Melvin L. Loeb, vice
president for research and development of Chicago-based
Wesley Jessen Corp., a unit of Schering-Plough Corp., thanks
him profusely for his support, calls him a "champion" of the
cause and hands him an award for his efforts to date.</p>
<p>Rep. Rostenkowski refuses to give a firm commitment. But,
he allows, "I think I'm being boxed in."</p>
