	<p class="article-leader">ANAIWOI, Indonesia -- The coastline in this part of
southern Sulawesi offers a good setting for picture postcards
of tranquil tropical life. But views of thatch-roofed
dwellings amid swaying coconut trees wouldn't show the
reality behind the idyllic facade.
   There's no running water and no electricity. The nearest
doctor is an hour away. While villagers make a living, they
aren't thriving.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For residents like 45-year-old Condoh, whose income comes
from coconuts and rice, life is better than it was in the
past. Road improvements, for instance, make it easier to get
to the hospital. But, "There are many problems, and we aren't
satisfied," the father of four says. "There's not enough
money for school fees."</p>
<p>Anaiwoi is one of hundreds of Indonesian villages where
people generally have higher living standards than in the
past but remain relatively poor. A disproportionate
percentage of such villages are in the eastern half of the
archipelago, where resources are limited and problems with
the infrastructure seem endless. Most eastern provinces are
handicapped by poor soil and inadequate rainfall, so the
region can produce only meager crops compared with fertile
Java and Bali.</p>
<p>Authorities in Jakarta acknowledge that eastern Indonesia
lags considerably behind the country's western region, which
has more sources of income and fewer isolated districts.
President Suharto, in his annual budget speech in January,
talked of the need to help eastern Indonesia catch up.</p>
<p>His statement has prompted a host of seminars urging
investors to "go east" and calling on Jakarta authorities to
give the region special help. There will be help, but it's
unlikely to be particularly special or substantial. Making a
chain of widespread islands attractive for investment is a
daunting task requiring lots of money and political will.
Many political analysts, economists and businessmen doubt
there will be sufficient supplies of either.</p>
<p>They think the long-term prospects for eastern Indonesia
will improve, but it may lag further behind in the short
term. They believe government spending, though being markedly
increased, may remain insufficient to make much difference.
And some suggest the government may end up mainly paying lip
service to helping a region that doesn't carry much clout in
the capital.</p>
<p>Helping eastern Indonesia isn't a burning issue, though
one former governor from the area says there could be
political problems if its people don't feel they're getting a
better deal from Jakarta. Continued neglect "can create bad
feelings against the central government," says ex-Gov. Arnold
Baramuli, now a Jakarta-based businessman. "In the past, the
government has mostly just talked about helping."</p>
<p>The government is now doing more than talk. For the year
that began April 1, budgets for transport and communication
in eastern provinces more than quadrupled from last year.
While the increases have been commended by economists, Mr.
Baramuli dismisses the rises as "meaningless"; he contends
that expenditure in the east remains about the same as for
two resource-rich provinces of Sumatra.</p>
<p>Mr. Baramuli advocates a Marshall Plan for eastern
Indonesia that involves years of massive spending and special
aid programs -- something government is hardly likely to
undertake. Other businessmen have more modest goals: They
want tax holidays and other investment incentives such as
government subsidies to cut loan rates and high transport
costs.</p>
<p>"Industry won't come here if incentives are only the same
as the rest of Indonesia," says Jusuf Kalla, managing
director of a trading company in Ujung Pandang and chairman
of the South Sulawesi chapter of the Indonesian Chamber of
Commerce. "All of Indonesia must get some chance, not just
Jakarta and Surabaya."</p>
<p>Special treatment for eastern Indonesia is "badly needed,"
says Basri Hasanuddin, rector of Ujung Pandang's Hasanuddin
University, the region's largest state university.
Infrastructure in the east, he adds, "is very, very poor
compared with Java." And South Sulawesi Gov. Achmad Amiruddin
says: "If the government doesn't give us incentives, we can't
compete with (western Indonesia) because of our higher
costs."</p>
<p>In Jakarta, ministers have called for as much help as
possible for eastern Indonesia -- but government planners
hint that this is likely to amount primarily to steadily
larger budget allocations and not special incentives.</p>
<p>"We'll keep all the suggestions in mind," a senior
official of the National Development Planning Board says,
"but it's difficult to treat one region in a different way
from others." There are poor provinces in the west, he notes,
that would feel discriminated against if special incentives
are given in the east.</p>
<p>Some economists doubt special incentives should be given.
Iwan J. Azis of the University of Indonesia says extending
investment incentives to the east could harm the overall
national economic growth rate. "You would bring down the
national efficiency by developing the naturally less
efficient areas," he says. Businessmen in eastern Indonesia
argue that if their areas aren't better developed, the
imbalance with Java will worsen, putting an unbearable burden
on Indonesia's most populous island -- which already accounts
for 60% of the population even though it has only 7% of the
land area.</p>
<p>Industrial investment has been booming in Indonesia in the
past three years, but most of it is coming to Jakarta and
other urban areas in Java. Sulawesi hasn't benefited; other
than a shrimp farm and a state-owned nickel smelter, there
isn't any industry near Mr. Condoh's village.</p>
<p>By sheer numbers, most poor Indonesians live in Java, but
in terms of percentage of the population, poverty is more
widespread in eastern Indonesia. A draft World Bank report on
poverty alleviation, completed last December, said while
Indonesia was doing a good job in many ways, poverty was
increasing in some eastern provinces. The draft included the
bank's calculations that the percentage of the population in
poverty in Southeast Sulawesi, for example, increased to 45%
in 1987 from 36% in 1984.</p>
<p>(The bank's final report, completed last month, used
different criteria for defining poverty and contained a more
upbeat assessment. The statement in the draft about poverty
increasing in the east was dropped; the final report says
only that the incidence of poverty in the region "remains
high.")</p>
<p>Government officials in the east argue that their growth
has been slowed by history as well as geography and
resources. Some provinces, such as East Timor, are relatively
new with almost no past economic development. Irian Jaya,
another new province, has huge infrastructure problems and a
population almost wholly without education. Provinces of
Sulawesi, far advanced by comparison, have been held back by
decades of disturbances; Islamic insurgents created chaos
during the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>"Our potential is high, but we had a big problem before
with unrest that has held us back," says Achmad Amiruddin,
the South Sulawesi governor. "There was no peace from World
War II till 1970."</p>
<p>Given the historical problems, some officials maintain
that eastern Indonesia hasn't done badly at all. Central
government funds have built schools, a network of roads and
health clinics in every district -- though some are in a poor
condition.</p>
<p>"We've done a lot with little money," says Alala, governor
of Southeast Sulawesi. "Can you imagine how well we'll do if
we have a lot of money?"</p>
