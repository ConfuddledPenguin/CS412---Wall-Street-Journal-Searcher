	<p class="article-leader">Charles Keating has an idea he thinks the government can't
refuse -- although his critics are already scoffing.
   Mr. Keating wants to buy back $500 million of the assets
of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, with no money down and
government financing, and manage the assets so the U.S.
doesn't lose any money on them. It's all aimed at proving
he's a smart businessman -- not the devious executive the
government says he is.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I've made a lot of money for myself and for other people
over the years, and I just want to show people that what the
government says isn't true," Mr. Keating said in a meeting in
New York with reporters and editors from The Wall Street
Journal. Mr. Keating is chairman of Phoenix-based American
Continental Corp., which was Lincoln's parent before the
government seized the Irvine, Calif., thrift last year.</p>
<p>In five years, under his proposal, the U.S. would get its
$500 million plus interest. And he would contribute an
additional $50 million for creditors of American Continental,
including irate holders of $300 million in almost worthless
American Continental bonds sold at Lincoln branches. Mr.
Keating and two associates would personally guarantee the
$550 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating plans to make his proposal in the next few
weeks to an Arizona federal district court that is overseeing
American Continental's bankruptcy-law filing. The plan
requires the approval of the court, creditors and the
Resolution Trust Corp., the government agency overseeing the
cleanup of the U.S. thrift industry. Even Keating associates
concede it is difficult to imagine the government, which has
a $1.1 billion civil racketeering suit against Mr. Keating
and other former members of Lincoln and American Continental
management, entrusting Lincoln's assets to him. The
government has made the charge that Mr. Keating and his
colleagues engaged in phony tax and loan transactions to
divert money from Lincoln into American Continental.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating has denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>"Psychologically, this may be difficult for the RTC," said
James Feder, an attorney for Mr. Keating.</p>
<p>But Mr. Feder insisted that financially, Mr. Keating is
offering the government a no-risk deal. The $500 million in
assets -- including stock, junk bonds, loans and real estate
-- Mr. Keating would like to manage have been marked down by
the RTC to $250 million, Mr. Feder said. Mr. Keating is
willing to promise the government $500 million, the book
value of the assets when Lincoln, which had assets totaling
$5.5 billion, was taken over in April 1989. The assets don't
include the opulent Phoenician resort hotel in Phoenix, the
crown jewel of Lincoln's real estate holdings.</p>
<p>"The government may sell {the assets} for $250 million.
We're saying we'll give them $500 million plus interest and
return money to the bondholders," Mr. Feder said. Mr. Feder
insisted that by taking the assets at full book value and
promising the extra $50 million, there's little likelihood
Mr. Keating could make a killing. "There's no harm or foul to
the government other than that if he succeeds, he proves the
government wrong," Mr. Feder said.</p>
<p>RTC lawyers working on the Lincoln case couldn't be
reached to comment on Mr. Keating's plan over the weekend.
But it was scoffed at by lawyers for American Continental's
unsecured creditors.</p>
<p>The proposal "sounds like the same thing he's been doing
all along, using government money to do whatever he wants to
do," said Susan Illston, a bondholder attorney. She added
that his offer to personally guarantee the $550 million to
purchase assets of American Continental and Lincoln "doesn't
make any sense. He claims to have no money."</p>
