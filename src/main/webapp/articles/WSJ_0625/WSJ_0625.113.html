	<p class="article-leader">Polly Peck International PLC of Britain and Sansui
Electric Co. completed an agreement that will raise Polly
Peck's holding in the Japanese company to 72% from 51%.
   Sansui is to issue 84.9 million new shares at 940 yen
($6.08) each in a private placement to investors to finance
its purchase of two Polly Peck divisions, Capetronic Group
and Imperial Group. Polly Peck, which announced the deal in
May, said it will take up about 91% of the new issue, with
the remainder going to third-party investors. The
conglomerate said it expects the sale to occur on July 10.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The move is part of larger restructuring aimed at
developing Polly Peck's electronics businesses around Sansui,
in which it acquired a controlling interest last year.</p>
