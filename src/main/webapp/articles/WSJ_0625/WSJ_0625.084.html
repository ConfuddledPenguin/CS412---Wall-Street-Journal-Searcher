	<p class="article-leader">Donald Trump's pending $65 million bank loan appears to be
in the hands of two foreign banks who, as of yesterday, still
hadn't agreed to the proposal.
   Negotiations with the banks, West German-based Dresdner
Bank and French-based Societe General, are expected to resume
today, as Mr. Trump's creditors race to complete the proposal
by tomorrow night's deadline. If Mr. Trump doesn't receive
the $65 million by then, he will likely default on bond
payments on Trump's Castle, which could trigger other
defaults on his $2 billion in bank debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All told, 70 lending institutions must agree to the plan
that would allow Mr. Trump to suspend interest payments on
some $800 million of the bank debt. While a vast majority of
the banks have agreed to the proposal, a single dissent would
wreck the deal, bankers say.</p>
<p>The $65 million loan would be supplied by Mr. Trump's
major creditors: units of Bankers Trust Corp., Citicorp,
Chase Manhattan Corp., First Fidelity Bancorp, Manufacturers
Hanover Corp., Midlantic and the U.S. unit of National
Westminster Bank PLC.</p>
<p>On Friday, three Japanese banks that, like Dresdner, hold
first mortgages on the Trump Tower in Manhattan, lifted their
opposition to the bailout plan. Those banks have purchased
pieces of an original $75 million loan issued to Mr. Trump by
Chase Manhattan.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of the 54 participants in more
than $1 billion in loans issued by Citicorp have also agreed
to the proposal, though a few holdouts remain, according to
people close to the negotiations.</p>
<p>After a long silence, Mr. Trump issued a statement Friday
that expressed optimism that the deal would get done. "An
overwhelming number of the participating lenders,
representing both national and international financial
institutions, have now joined the major banks in supporting
our plan," the statement said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, attorneys representing Chase Manhattan met
with representatives from Dresdner to get the German bank to
accept a second mortgage on the property, to no avail. Today,
senior executives from Chase are expected to call on Dresdner
officers to lobby for the proposal. Societe General owns less
than $15 million of a $200 million loan Chase issued to Mr.
Trump for his purchase of a 72-acre vacant site on
Manhattan's Upper West Side, according to an individual close
to the talks.</p>
<p>The plan's purpose, say bankers, is to help Mr. Trump
avoid bankruptcy court. Instead, the banks want to have an
orderly sale of assets, and to give Mr. Trump time to improve
operations in his airline, casino and hotels empire.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the banks worked through the weekend, while
many of the bankers took yesterday off. If the deal is agreed
to by tomorrow, the seven banks have arranged for a bridge
loan to be extended in case the paperwork for the $65 million
loan can't be completed in time, said a person close to the
talks.</p>
