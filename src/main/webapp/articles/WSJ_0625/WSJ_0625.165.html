	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- With its plan to acquire Swiss coffee and
chocolate maker Jacobs Suchard AG, Philip Morris Cos. is
seeking to strengthen its position in the $550 billion
European food business.
   On Friday, Philip Morris, the tobacco and
consumer-products company, announced it would acquire 80% of
Suchard for $3.8 billion. Suchard's trove of brands, such as
the Jacobs Cafe and Night and Day brands of coffee, and the
Toblerone and Milka brands of chocolate, will significantly
strengthen Philip Morris's presence in Europe before trade
barriers are lifted in 1992. The acquisition also will help
lessen Philip Morris's dependence on U.S. tobacco sales as
consumption steadily declines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With its Maxwell House, Tang, Kraft and other popular
brands, Philip Morris already had $3.1 billion in revenue
from the European markets. But it ranked far behind the two
food industry titans of Europe: Nestle S.A., based in
Switzerland, and the Anglo-Dutch Unilever Group. The Suchard
acquisition will vault Philip Morris into a strong No. 3
ranking from the No. 5 position.</p>
<p>Philip Morris's plan is "to move in the direction of more
Pan-European brands," said Michael Miles, vice chairman of
Philip Morris and chief executive officer of Kraft General
Foods, the company's food unit.</p>
<p>Despite Philip Morris's considerable marketing abilities
-- it is already the world's largest consumer-products
company -- industry experts say its Pan-European strategy is
a gamble. Few companies have successfully developed food
products that please more than a fraction of the 320 million
Western Europeans, with their nine languages and distinct
food preferences. And in spite of enthusiasm over falling
trade barriers, regional protectionist regulations linger.</p>
<p>The acquisition won't materially change Kraft General
Foods' U.S. operations. Under the agreement, Philip Morris
won't acquire Suchard's Canadian operations or its E.J. Brach
Inc. sugar-confection business, based in the U.S. Philip
Morris will reap some revenue from Suchard's U.S. Toblerone
chocolates, which Brach will continue to distribute. Sales of
the triangular candy bars in the U.S. accounted for a paltry
$16 million at retail last year, according to Lisbeth
Echeandia, publisher of Confectioner Magazine.</p>
<p>For now, Mr. Miles insists Philip Morris hasn't any plans
to boost imports of Suchard's candy to the U.S. "This deal
doesn't involve any noticeable expansion of Philip Morris's
business in the U.S," he said.</p>
<p>Industry analysts praised the deal, which is expected to
have little effect on Philip Morris's earnings. "This is
acquisition heaven," said Emanuel Goldman, a tobacco and
beverage analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in San Francisco.
"It's a good fit, and there is virtually no
earnings-per-share dilution." Last year, Philip Morris earned
$2.9 billion, or $3.18 a share, on revenue of $44.1 billion.</p>
<p>The announcement pleased Wall Street. Philip Morris shares
rose 37.5 cents to $44.75 in composite trading on the New
York Stock Exchange Friday. The shares traded as high as
$46.375, but fell late in the day amid a broad decline in the
market.</p>
<p>The planned transaction also squelched Wall Street fears
that Philip Morris was planning a much larger acquisition
that might clip future earnings. Rumors had circulated that
Philip Morris might attempt to buy such giants as Campbell
Soup Co. or PepsiCo Inc.</p>
<p>Analysts also hailed Philip Morris's efforts to pump up
its European operations, where some of company's brands were
stragglers. Under the terms of the deal, Philip Morris will
acquire only Suchard's European operations, which had revenue
of $3.6 billion last year. Sales were divided about evenly
between coffee and chocolate operations. "Strategically, it
is a very good move," said Nomi Ghez, a food analyst with
Goldman Sachs & Co. Philip Morris is "a big, strong player in
the U.S., but it needed more scale in Europe."</p>
<p>Together, Kraft General Foods and Sucard will become
Europe's market leader in ground roast coffee, commanding a
respectable 20% of European sales.</p>
<p>The planned combination also appears to be a good fit
geographically. Suchard's coffee brands are especially strong
in countries where Kraft General Foods' presence is the
weakest.</p>
<p>The acquisition also will mark Kraft General Foods' entry
into the European confectionery market. Although the company
sells gum in France, it does little candy business in other
countries. Suchard, by contrast, is the continent's
third-largest player, with about 13% of the market, after
Nestle with 23% and Mars Inc. with 17%, Ms. Ghez said.</p>
<p>But while the stature of its new brands is assured, Kraft
General Foods' strategy of building Pan-European brands isn't
risk-free. Although a few marketers have succeeded in selling
the same brand across borders, including Philip Morris with
its Marlboro cigarettes and Nestle with Nescafe coffee,
strong local preferences still rule the food business.
Executives familiar with the market there doubt that regional
tastes will be easily changed.</p>
<p>And despite the coming economic unification of the
European Community, a tangle of regulations might still
stymie U.S. marketers. Italy, for example, allows only
products made from durum wheat -- not surprisingly, Italy's
predominant type -- to be called pasta. But most spaghetti or
macaroni is made from many varieties of wheat.</p>
<p>The transaction also will represent an important symbolic
shift in Philip Morris's business. Once the acquisition is
completed, U.S. tobacco sales will account for less than 50%
of the company's total revenue for the first time.</p>
