	<p class="article-leader">Birds gotta fly and regulators gotta regulate, but these
primal instincts do not forgive the Securities and Exchange
Commission its latest overstepping. The unanimous federal
appeals court that recently invalidated the SEC's one-share,
one-vote requirement may have done the agency a favor.
Perhaps now its bureaucrats can remember that their job is to
give shareholders more say, not less.
   The SEC has indeed opposed management-entrenching
anti-takeover devices, but this was no reason to invoke its
authority with dual classes of stock. Unlike standard poison
pills, every state requires that adopting more than one
voting class of stock must be preceded by the vote of a
majority or supermajority of shareholders. Several companies
in recent years approved a higher class of stock, notably
when the possible alternative was losing the benefits of a
controlling family interest. Dow Jones, which publishes this
newspaper, adopted dual classes of stock after non-family and
non-management shareholders voted 2 to 1 to approve the
change.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Judge Stephen Williams of Washington, D.C., was not amused
by the agency's argument that it could substitute its rule
for state corporate law on the ground that it was only
regulating how stock exchanges list firms. "To argue that
Congress's `equal regulation' mandate supports SEC control
over corporate governance through national listing
standards," Judge Williams wrote, "is to gamble that the
court will accept a Commission spin on a statutory fragment
without even a glance at its context. Wrong court, bad
gamble."</p>
<p>That said, a word of caution to the winner of this case.
The Business Roundtable brought the lawsuit because many
chief executives oppose restrictions on what they can do to
foil unwanted takeovers. This opinion is not a clear victory
for that view. The court emphasized that shareholders get to
vote on dual classes of stock, in effect agreeing to rewrite
the ownership contract. This case again raises the question
of why managers should be allowed to take actions that risk
harming share price without first getting shareholder
approval.</p>
<p>One understandable reason the SEC hoped for a different
ruling was to add to its power to stop state legislatures
from interfering in the free national market for corporate
control. Massachusetts and Pennsylvania are the latest states
to throw a protective cloak around firms they incorporate.
The market eventually could take care of the problem. The law
passed to protect Armstrong World Industries has cost
shareholders in Pennsylvania firms some $1 billion in
share-price losses, according to Institutional Shareholder
Services.</p>
<p>There's probably not too much the SEC can do about poison
pills unless it wants to lobby Congress for a federal rule
that all firms must get shareholder permission before
adopting defensive tactics.</p>
<p>SEC Chairman Richard Breeden has had some wise things to
say about reducing the cost of capital in the U.S. compared
with Europe and Japan. The SEC recently has deregulated the
private-placement market and made it easier for foreign firms
to register securities in the U.S. Still, Mr. Breeden refuses
to define insider trading, despite courts reversing
convictions, or pull back on the long, expensive list of SEC
disclosure requirements for most transactions. Mr. Breeden
might consider that the instinct to find things to regulate
in the U.S. by his agency remains the single greatest
difference among the world's securities markets.</p>
