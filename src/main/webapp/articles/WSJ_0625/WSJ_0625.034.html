	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- The government's first land auction in the
fiscal year that began April 1 raised a total of 357 million
Hong Kong dollars (US$45.8 million), far more than the
combined minimum of HK$257 million, and in line with most
market expectations, though weak bidding interest was viewed
by analysts as a sign of continuing caution.
   The auction covered a site for warehouse construction, one
for residential use and a third site for nonindustrial
purposes. "There were only a few bidders, which suggests that
a number of people are quite conservative," said K.M. Wu,
valuation manager for Richard Ellis Ltd., a property
consulting group. "The outlook is still not too certain."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Roger Nissim, the government's land agent who conducted
the auction, sounded a more optimistic note than most
analysts. He said the prices were in line with government
expectations. "There was quite spirited bidding for each
lot," he said. "The three lots are for different types of
users, so that shows quite a healthy sign that various
sectors of the property market are still quite active."</p>
