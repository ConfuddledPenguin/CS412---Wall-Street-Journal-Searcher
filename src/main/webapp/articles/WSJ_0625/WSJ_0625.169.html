	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Conventional wisdom has it that Hong Kong's
stock market has such a wide local following that everyone --
from the rich to the proverbial housekeepers and cabdrivers
-- stands ready to invest in just about anything that moves.
   So it has come as a surprise for the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange to learn from a survey that the colony's
stock-owning public numbers only about 363,000 people, or 9%
of the adult population. "The figure is disappointingly low.
It's a shock," said Francis Yuen, the exchange's chief
executive officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Commissioned by the exchange and conducted late last year,
the survey points to a big gap in efforts to repair the local
stock market's dented image. Such efforts have been under way
since the 1987 Black Monday crash exposed serious management
flaws in Hong Kong's market. They took on added urgency after
last year's brutal suppression on June 4 of pro-democracy
protests in Beijing. In addition to exacerbating public
concern over this British colony's 1997 return to Chinese
rule, that event helped underscore local stocks'
vulnerability to political turmoil in China.</p>
<p>The consequent market reforms and promotion campaigns
undertaken by the government and the exchange have been aimed
mainly at allaying concerns of foreign investors. Little,
though, has been done to woo the local public. One result, as
the survey indicates, is dwindling participation by Hong Kong
investors.</p>
<p>Professing alarm at the phenomenon, the stock exchange is
moving to win back its home market. Its campaign, announced
Thursday in conjunction with release of the survey, consists
of a five-week promotional exhibition. Moving from site to
site in mostly middle-income neighborhoods, the exchange's
display is designed to remind the public that Hong Kong has a
stock market and that people should consider putting money in
it.</p>
<p>"Too much has been done since 1987 to promote the stock
market to foreign investors," Mr. Yuen said. "It's the
individuals we need to do more for."</p>
<p>By his estimate, trading activity used to be split
relatively evenly among three camps -- rich local
individuals, small local investors and institutions, most of
them based overseas. With data only on those local
individuals, rich and otherwise, who owned stock as of late
1989, the survey doesn't show how the overall trading pattern
has changed over the years. Mr. Yuen argued nevertheless that
the role of small-time local investors has diminished
noticeably since the 1987 crash.</p>
<p>Investment interest generally has picked up over the past
couple of months as the market slowly regains ground. As a
result, the value of shares traded each session on many
recent days has exceeded HK$2 billion (US$256.8 million),
double the daily average during the first quarter of 1990.
Much of the increase is attributed to Taiwan investors
switching out of their ailing market. But Mr. Yuen said Hong
Kong can't count on such a boon to last and must try harder
to rebuild investor confidence at home.</p>
<p>He cited comparable surveys that put stock-ownership
levels in the U.S. and Canada at around 16% of the adult
population, saying Hong Kong should do at least as well. But
judging by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's survey, much more
than the five-week promotion may be needed to address what
may be a lack of confidence by the colony's potential
investors.</p>
<p>"Some of it may be just the result of misconceptions about
the market," Mr. Yuen said. "But it will take a long time to
correct."</p>
<p>Hong Kong's survey, conducted from September to December,
bases its conclusions on 2,000 randomly selected adults. For
the survey's purposes, the term stock owners refers only to
those who invest directly in stocks and not those who do so
only indirectly, such as through unit trusts. Among those
2,000, 307 owners and 301 non-owners were picked for in-depth
interviews.</p>
<p>Among the respondents who previously owned stock but no
longer did so at the time of the survey, the most oft-cited
reason for not investing is that they have had an "unpleasant
experience" in the market. Though not specified in the
survey, such experiences, according to Mr. Yuen, stem mainly
from losses suffered in the 1987 crash or during last year's
June 4 political crisis.</p>
<p>As for stock owners, the survey undermines to some extent
the often-cited stereotype of them as greedy, ill-informed
speculators willing to take illogical risks.</p>
<p>White-collar workers, at 29.2%, form a core of the
stock-owning population. Professionals and businessmen follow
with 28.1%. Next come blue-collar workers at 21.7%,
housewives at 12.5%, the retired at 7.3% and, finally,
students and the unemployed at 1.2%.</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Tokyo stocks ended lower in thin trading Friday as
participants took conservative positions ahead of the
weekend, while the yen's softness discouraged buying, traders
said.</p>
<p>London shares were moderately higher.</p>
<p>The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was down 392.70
points at 31694.57. The index slipped 0.49 point Thursday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the Nikkei index gave up
another 339.09 points to 31355.48.</p>
<p>Friday's volume on the First Section was estimated at 350
million shares, down from 409 million Thursday.</p>
<p>Losing issues outnumbered winning issues, 703 to 227,
while 189 were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index (Topix) of all issues listed
in the first section, which fell 5.24 points Thursday, sank
20.50 points, or 0.87%, to 2341.06.</p>
<p>The second section index, which rose 4.15 points Thursday,
fell 16.31 points, or 0.39%, to close at 4135.42. Volume in
the second section was estimated at 20 million shares, down
from 24.5 million Thursday.</p>
<p>Growing concern that Japan may not be able to avoid
inflation in the coming months is suppressing buying
activity, although volume indicates that the bearishness
hasn't gotten out of hand, observers said.</p>
<p>Issues hit by moderate profit-taking and general
bearishness Friday included Canon Sales, down 140 yen (91
cents) to 4,880 yen, Chubu Electric, down 100 to 3,300,
Fujisawa Pharmaceutical, down 30 to 2,020, and Dainippon
Pharmaceutical, off 30 to 3,160.</p>
<p>Nippon Telegraph & Telephone fell 20,000 yen to 1,090,000
yen, KDD dropped 200 to 18,500 and Toho Co. fell 400 to
37,200. NTV fell 200 to 34,700.</p>
<p>But Nintendo rose 200 to 26,100, while JAL was up 100 to
18,100.</p>
<p>Hirose Electric added 140 to 6,990 and Intec rose 100 to
4,870.</p>
<p>Sony ended 40 higher at 8,570 while TDK rose 30 to 6,780.</p>
<p>London share prices finished moderately higher as
investors chose to sit out the session before the opening of
this week's new trading account and expiration of June
stock-index futures and options contracts.</p>
<p>Dealers said there were too many corporate and economic
uncertainties lurking in the background for institutional
investors to get more deeply involved in the market.
Moreover, ongoing major U.K. sporting events, combined with
an unimpressive start on Wall Street, set the market adrift
for most of the session.</p>
<p>The broad-based Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index closed up 8.2 points at 2378.5, down from the intraday
peak of 2381.1 just after the release of British trade
figures. The day's low of 2368.2, reached after one hour of
official trading, was down 2.1 on the day.</p>
<p>At the final tally, the narrower FT 30-share index was up
5.2 points at 1913.5. Volume registered a moderate 497.8
million shares compared with the 415.4 million traded
Thursday.</p>
<p>In the futures market, the June FT-SE 100 index contract
closed at 2390.0, up from its close of 2389.0 Thursday.</p>
<p>Midmorning trade figures, which were slightly better than
market expectations, had only a temporary impact on an
otherwise sluggish market. There was little incentive to
shift existing positions before the forthcoming close of the
second quarter, market professionals added.</p>
<p>May's current account deficit stood at #1.32 billion
($2.27 billion), down from #1.60 billion in April and
compared with estimates of #1.35 billion.</p>
<p>Amid a session of sparse corporate developments, shares in
pharmaceutical company Wellcome were the biggest gainers on
the day. Dealers said the move came in the wake of a hefty
sell-off earlier in the week on bearish forecasts for the
company's Retrovir drug used to combat the effects of the HIV
virus. Dealers contended the drop was overdone and Wellcome
gained 25 pence (43 cents) to 625 pence on volume of 1.6
million shares.</p>
<p>Stocks closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich,
Amsterdam and Madrid and lower in Milan. Stockholm was closed
for a holiday. South African gold stocks closed mixed.</p>
<p>Share prices closed lower in Taipei and Wellington, were
mixed in Hong Kong and Singapore and higher in Sydney, Seoul
and Manila.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
