	<p class="article-leader">MELROSE PARK, Ill. -- Although soft industry conditions
make it "a tougher ball game than it was in previous years,"
Alberto-Culver Co. expects per-share earnings will rise to
about 34-36 cents in its third quarter, ending June 30,
Leonard H. Lavin, chairman and chief executive officer, said.
   Those earnings are largely in line with analyst
expectations for the maker of personal-care products, and
would represent a solid increase from year-ago net income of
$8.3 million, or 31 cents a share, which came on sales of
$182.2 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an interview, Mr. Lavin said a number of retailers,
pressed for cash as a result of leveraged transactions, have
cut back on inventory levels. Others, although not similarly
burdened with debt, have tightened inventory levels by
implementing computer-based systems that allow them to
monitor ordering needs more effectively. Both developments
work to make the marketplace "much more competitive," he
said.</p>
<p>"In order to increase sales, companies are introducing new
products. And to make sure that the new products go,
{they're} putting massive sums of advertising behind them,"
he said. In addition, he said, retailers have boosted the
slotting fees they impose on manufacturers trying to place
new products on the crowded shelves. "Everything is
tightening up the bottom line," he said.</p>
<p>Alberto-Culver boosted advertising and promotional
expenses 15%, to $130 million, in fiscal 1989, Mr. Lavin
said, and the current year will see such expenditures
increase by "at least" a similar percentage. Alberto-Culver
historically emphasizes heavy advertising for its products.</p>
<p>The company's long-term strategy calls for continued
growth. But in its efforts to find acquisitions, Mr. Lavin
said, bigger and less-cautious bidders -- "the people who can
afford to give away lots of dollars or lots of shares" --
have pushed prices to levels Alberto-Culver won't pay. He
said, "We're still looking," however, and added that
Alberto-Culver expects to find a suitable acquisition if it
keeps "knocking on enough doors."</p>
<p>Howard B. Bernick, president and chief operating officer,
said that because of the restructurings currently under way
in the industry, the company expects that "there will be good
{acquisition} opportunities available." And he said that
Alberto-Culver, which has a voting and a nonvoting class of
comon shares, is in a better position to make stock-swap
purchases than other potential buyers.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the company's growth is centered on
internal efforts. Mr. Bernick said he thinks Alberto-Culver
has reached the point where it can "make the investments
needed in supporting our existing brands and introducing new
products."</p>
<p>Alberto-Culver's international division, while anchored by
a solid market position in Canada, is enjoying rapidly
swelling sales in Europe. Alberto earlier this month
disclosed that its United Kingdom operation, where sales have
doubled in the past three years, will spend $17 million to
build a larger factory and warehouse in Wales. International
sales currently represent about 25% of the company's overall
sales; Mr. Bernick said the percentage could be up to 30% in
five years.</p>
<p>The professional division, which sells to beauty-industry
trade and some upscale retail markets, and which historically
enjoys the highest margins, is continuing to perform well,
Mr. Bernick said.</p>
<p>Alberto-Culver also operates Sally Beauty Co., which
operates about 850 retail beauty-supply stores. As a
retailer, the unit tends to generate narrower profit margins.</p>
<p>"We have decided to slow the opening rate" of new stores,
said Mr. Bernick. In the current fiscal year, Sally will open
about 75 stores, he said, compared with 125 in 1988; in 1989
the unit bought and converted 175 stores formerly owned by
Safeway Stores. Besides the expense associated with opening a
new store, sales require a while to build at start-up stores,
Mr. Bernick said. The slowdown in new-store growth is
expected to provide an "all-time record level" of profit
margins, Mr. Bernick said: In the current fiscal year,
"Sally's profits are growing at a rate double their rate of
sales growth.</p>
<p>The Sally unit reported lower-than-anticipated results in
the first quarter of the current year, blaming unseasonably
cold December weather. But the unit's sales rebounded in the
second period, leading Merrill Lynch analyst Vicki Weber to
label the first-period shortfall a "glitch."</p>
<p>Alberto-Culver doesn't use Sally as a captive outlet --
the parent's products represent only 5% of the sales at the
chain, which carries all its major competitors' offerings.
"Sally gives us a big advantage," in that "we're in position
from time to time to pick up a trend" from the retail end of
the business, Mr. Lavin said.</p>
