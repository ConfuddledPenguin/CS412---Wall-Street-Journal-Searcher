	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Continental Airlines said it cut fares for
travel around the July 4 holiday by as much as 51%.
   The reductions vary by market, but the airline said the
maximum round-trip fare in the promotion is $238. That fare
applies to the New York-Los Angeles route, down from $426.
Other reduced fares include $158 on the Denver-Chicago route,
down from $280, and $158 on the Houston-Miami route, down
from $324.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Other airlines matched a similar promotion last year by
Continental, a unit of Continental Airlines Holdings Inc.,
and are expected to do so again this year.</p>
<p>Continental said the lower fares are available on
"hundreds of thousands" of seats. It wasn't more specific.</p>
<p>The reduced fares apply to travel that begins between July
1 and July 7 and returns July 4 or later. The carrier said
tickets must be purchased by Thursday and aren't refundable.</p>
