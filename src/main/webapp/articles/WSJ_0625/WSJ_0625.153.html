	<p class="article-leader">MACON, Ga. -- Charter Medical Corp. said federal
regulators are investigating the company for possible fraud
related to its Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.
   C. Michael Ford, chief financial officer of the hospital
and psychiatric-care company, said the Office of the
Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human
Services has interviewed several former reimbursement
specialists from Charter in connection with the probe. The
interviews, he said, have taken place in the past several
months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Ford added, however, that he isn't aware of any
current employees who have been interviewed.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford said the company expects to make a statement
today regarding the investigation.</p>
<p>Charter, which went private in a 1988 buy-out, posted a
$67 million loss on revenue of $475.2 million for its second
quarter ended March 31. The year earlier, Charter had a $14.6
million loss on revenue of $397.3 million.</p>
<p>The most recent figures, which included a $35 million
pretax charge for accounting problems, have raised some
concerns on Wall Street about the company's ability to
service its debt. Charter has said it will cut capital
expenditures and other costs to ensure its ability to meet
its payments.</p>
