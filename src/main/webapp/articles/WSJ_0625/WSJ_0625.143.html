	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Like their counterparts on Wall Street,
investment dealers on Canada's Bay Street are in the throes
of a major shakeout.
   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.'s Canadian unit, citing
continued losses, bowed out of Canada last week.
Prudential-Bache sold its retail operations to Toronto-based
Burns Fry Ltd., where about 400 Prudential-Bache employees
will find jobs. But at least another 225 workers will find
themselves scrambling to find new jobs. Merrill Lynch Canada
Inc. sold its retail operations in January.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>New York-based Prudential-Bache is a unit of Prudential
Insurance Co. of America. Merrill Lynch Canada is a unit of
New York-based Merrill Lynch & Co.</p>
<p>Only 28 of the Toronto Stock Exchange's 75 member firms
managed to make a profit in the first quarter of 1990. April
and May were even more difficult, many firms report.</p>
<p>"We're seeing a shrinking revenue base in a more
competitive market that also suffers from overcapacity," said
Lyle Stein, vice-president and portfolio strategist at
Toronto-based investment dealer Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc.</p>
<p>While many of these problems are familiar enough on Wall
Street, Canadian securities firms must grapple with
additional dilemmas, ranging from the country's sky-high
interest rates to a great degree of corporate concentration.</p>
<p>"In a rising interest rate environment, it's very
compelling for most investors to be in the money market and
fixed income market," said Robert Schultz, president and
chief executive of Midland Walwyn Capital Inc., one of
Canada's largest investment dealers. Investors buy these
vehicles through brokerage firms, too, he acknowledges, "but
these types of transactions are much less lucrative for us"
than equity investments.</p>
<p>Short-term interest rates are around 13.6% in Canada, more
than five percentage points above similar U.S. rates.
Investment industry executives say that encourages investors
to get out of stocks and into Treasury bills or similar
instruments.</p>
<p>"The retail investor, our bread and butter, is alleged to
be coming back to life in the U.S.," said Nesbitt Thomson's
Mr. Stein. "But unfortunately he hasn't arrived up here yet."</p>
<p>Institutional clients are still in the game, but they're
playing hardball with the brokers.</p>
<p>"In the last 12 months, there's been a contraction of what
institutions are willing to pay as commissions," said John
Ing, president and chief executive of Maisons Placements
Canada Inc., a Montreal-based securities dealer. "It's no
longer a question of negotiating the commission, it's a
question of the institution deciding what commission they
intend to pay."</p>
<p>Mr. Ing said those commissions have dropped from about
eight cents a share three years ago to about three cents this
year, figures confirmed by other major investment dealers.</p>
<p>But it's not only interest rates that keep Canadians away
from stock markets, some investment dealers argue.</p>
<p>Mr. Stein said that Canada's economy continues to
underperform those of other Western industrialized nations,
including West Germany and the U.S. The investment
environment, already seriously affected by rising interest
rates and economic uncertainty, has been further clouded by
the failure of Canada's Meech Lake constitutional accord,
aimed at bringing Quebec back into Canadian Confederation.
While debate over the accord and Quebec's future in Canada
hasn't directly affected the stock market, it has made the
outlook for foreign investment in Canada less certain.</p>
<p>Mr. Stein also cited the specific characteristics of the
Canadian equity market as a reason for the lack of investor
interest. "The equity market here has also gotten thinner,"
he added, "with many large companies having been taken over
and taken out of the market in the last few years."</p>
<p>In 1989 alone, Mr. Stein said, major Canadian firms such
as Connaught BioSciences Inc., Falconbridge Ltd. and
Consolidated-Bathurst Inc. were taken over. The high rate of
corporate concentration in Canada means many of the companies
listed on the stock exchanges have only relatively few shares
available for public trading.</p>
<p>A high proportion of Canada's major publicly traded firms
are in natural resources, such as Abitibi-Price Inc., Inco
Ltd. and Noranda Inc. These companies, hit by the high
Canadian dollar and a downturn in the cyclical markets for
their products, are reporting significantly lower levels of
profitability that makes their stocks less attractive.</p>
<p>There are also too many brokers chasing too little
business, further eroding margins, investment dealers say.</p>
<p>"Between 1982 and 1987, we had a very buoyant market, and
everybody had the view that this was going to go on," said
Midland Walwyn's Mr. Schultz. "But that is capacity that
can't be supported now, and it has impacted profitability."</p>
<p>Added Reay Mackay, chief operating officer of
Toronto-based RBC Dominion Securities Inc. in Toronto:
"Obviously, the industry has an overhead problem as much as
it does a revenue problem." RBC laid off 125 of its 200
London-based employees last month, and said in December it
planned to cut its Canadian staff by 175 people this year.</p>
<p>"If markets stay like this, there will be a further
shakeout" in the form of both mergers of firms and takeovers
of some by others, Mr. Mackay said.</p>
<p>But though bulls are an endangered species on Bay Street,
they aren't extinct.</p>
<p>Charles Winograd, president and chief executive of
Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd., said that although
the retail business in Canada is weaker than in the U.S.,
Canadian firms haven't had to deal with the problems caused
by the frenzied merger and acquisition activity of the past
few years, or with junk bonds.</p>
<p>"In 1988 and 1989, U.S. firms were cushioned by that
business," Mr. Winograd said. "Our toughest times came
immediately after the 1987 crash, and nothing's really
changed: This is a cyclical industry."</p>
<p>John MacNaughton, president of Burns Fry, said his company
plans to generate interest among its extremely cautious
clients by seeking out "creative" new products.</p>
<p>"We just completed the first placement by a British firm
of preferred shares in Canada by overcoming tax, accounting
and regulatory hurdles creatively," Mr. MacNaughton said,
referring to a 135 million Canadian dollar (US$114.8 million)
preferred share issue by Cadbury Schweppes PLC. He said the
company's retail brokers can overcome investor pessimism by
being more aware of the wide variety of products and issues
available.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, we'll see a resurgence in investor
confidence," he said.</p>
