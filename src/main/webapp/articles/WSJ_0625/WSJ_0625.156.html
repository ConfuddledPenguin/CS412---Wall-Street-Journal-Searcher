	<p class="article-leader">MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. -- Central Mortgage Corp. plans to
write off $1.1 million in non-tax-deductible goodwill
associated with the 1987 acquisition of Superior Mortgage
Inc.
   Separately, the bank holding company said it has been
ordered to boost its loan-loss reserves $1.7 million, a move
that will reduce net income for the quarter ending June 30
about $1.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Central Mortgage said the Office of Thrift Supervision
ordered the increase in loan-loss reserves following a review
of its Colonial Central Savings Bank. The majority of the
additional reserves considered necessary by the OTS relate to
six construction projects that had been identified as problem
assets.</p>
<p>Although they agreed to increase reserves, Central Holding
executives said they believe the additional reserves may be
greater than necessary, considering the collateral value of
the properties.</p>
<p>The goodwill write-off comes in connection with Central
Mortgage's closing of its loan-origination offices in Topeka
and Wichita, Kan. Central Mortgage acquired the offices in
1987. Since this goodwill was already excluded from
regulatory capital, the write-off will not affect regulatory
capital, Central officials said.</p>
