	<p class="article-leader">Every day brings another major story or opinion on the
savings-and-loan bailout problem. Two of your stories are
particularly instructive: the May 21 news item on Southwest
Savings Association and Sen. William V. Roth Jr.'s May 22
editorial-page article, "Use Treasury Securities to Cap S&L
Debt."
   The Southwest Savings collapse was due to the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.'s refusal to subsidize the
troubled assets held by Southwest Savings during its
recapitalization just two years ago. We simply did not
foresee then that ensuing government actions would so destroy
property values and otherwise dramatically change the game's
rules.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sen. Roth's article stresses the need to support asset
values (rather necessary when you are asking acquirers to
assume offsetting deposit liabilities). In fact, the
Southwest Plan deals after the Southwest Savings collapse
made such support a cornerstone of those later
recapitalizations. But because of "negative reaction" to the
December 1988 deals, Sen. Roth fosters a plan that is far
more awkward and lengthy (20 years) than was the FSLIC model.
Aside from some obvious technical incongruities in his
proposal, his urging a 20-year marketable subsidy while
ignoring any prepayment feature is in sharp contrast to the
FSLIC nominal 10-year subsidy, which is in fact an overnight
obligation because it's prepayable at the government's
option. Needless to say, those "negative reactors" never
faced or acknowledged the existence of this option, or its
economic value.</p>
<p>And so, based on hysterical critics, the government
trashed the only program that was able to attract capital,
place assets in private hands, avoid dumping with consequent
asset write-downs and credit contraction in viable banks,
allow for cyclical factors to take hold (also relied upon by
Sen. Roth), systematically reduce overbanking, maintain and
enhance franchise values, and to do all this -- without a
Rube Goldberg bureaucracy -- on "de minimus" cash flows (when
compared with the extravagant petitions now facing Congress)
while retaining a valuable option.</p>
<p>But then, we only attracted $3.5 billion in new capital
and only managed (under the then existing rules) some 244
thrifts in 14 months accounting for more than $120 billion in
assets, and had a lavish circa $10 billion cash flow with
which to work in solving some of the system's most
intractable problems, including a sharp reduction in the cost
of funds for the benefit of all financial institutions.</p>

<p>(Mr. Root was executive director of the FSLIC in 1988).</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Sen. Roth's complicated scheme to give Treasury securities
to purchasers of failed S&L loan assets may be
well-intentioned, but it is more likely to increase the cost
of the thrift bailout than to reduce it.</p>
<p>He recommends setting an imaginary number on the value of
every thrift asset within the control of the Resolution Trust
Corp. The imaginary number would, believe it or not, be
wholly unrelated to an asset's actual market value. Instead,
the figure would represent the amount the government would
have to receive to hold the immediate taxpayer losses from
the bailout to $50 billion. As nobody will pay Sen. Roth's
fairyland price for these assets, he would make up the
difference between his price and the market price by giving
purchasers U.S. government Treasury obligations whose market
value is sufficient to close the gap.</p>
<p>According to his plan, the government will pay interest on
these obligations for 20 years. If at the end of that period
the owner of the asset can sell it for the fairyland price,
then the government is absolved of the obligation to pay the
principal due. This savings of principal is the key to Sen.
Roth's plan. But he fails to see that those receiving these
securities will demand government securities with a
sufficiently high market value to compensate them for the
full difference between today's market value for the property
they are buying and the inflated price the government is
demanding. His plan uses mirrors to provide taxpayers with
imaginary savings.</p>
<p>Fixed-price deposit insurance got us into this mess by
putting S&Ls in a "heads I win, tails the government loses"
situation. S&L managers put federally insured money in
high-risk, high-return projects. If the projects work out
well, shareholders reap a bonanza. If they fail, the
government is left holding the bag. Sen. Roth's plan creates
the same perverse incentives. Those who purchase thrift
assets will put them to high-risk uses, because they know
that if their gamble doesn't pay off they are protected by
the government from all loss. If their gamble pays off and
the property increases in value, the government does not get
to share in the upside.</p>
<p>Purchasers of real estate from the RTC have lots of
options regarding what they might do with their property.
Sen. Roth's plan would guarantee that the purchasers would
put the assets to the riskiest possible uses, and that's how
we got into the S&L mess in the first place.</p>
