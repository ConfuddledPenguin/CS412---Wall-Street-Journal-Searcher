	<p class="article-leader">Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises Inc. said it put up for sale
two of its Texas newspapers, the Port Arthur News and its
sister publication, the Orange Leader.
   The closely held newspaper and cable television company
didn't disclose the price it is seeking for the properties,
but said it retained Lee Dirks & Associates, a Birmingham,
Mich.-based newspaper merger and acquisition company, to
assist in the process. Cox said proceeds from the sale would
be used to reduce debt incurred by the 1985 merger of Cox
Communications into Cox Enterprises.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Port Arthur News is a morning daily newspaper with a
circulation of 23,200 on weekdays and 24,900 on Sundays; the
Orange Leader sells 10,100 copies on weekday evenings and
Saturday mornings, and has a Sunday circulation of 12,100.</p>
