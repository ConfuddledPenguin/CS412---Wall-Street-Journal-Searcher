	<p class="article-leader">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- The Malaysian cabinet decided to
privatize Port Klang, the country's largest port, which is
18.6 miles west of here, by placing all of its operations,
with 22 wharves and about 5,000 government employees, under a
single commercial entity, local newspaper reports said.
   The Klang Port Authority, which has operational duties,
would be reduced to a regulatory body overseeing the port.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said details of the
privatization program will be decided later. Mr. Ling said he
couldn't provide details on the equity and privatization
schedule, because the matter was beyond the ministry's
jurisdiction. He said that port workers would have wages
similar to those in the private sector, including bonuses,
and that their pay would be determined by the performance of
the new company to be set up. Equity of 5% in the company
would be allocated to the workers.</p>
