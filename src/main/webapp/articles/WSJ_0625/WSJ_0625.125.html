	<p class="article-leader">What do Sam Walton and Ronald McDonald have in common?
   Both use corporate stationery, business cards and annual
reports made from recycled paper. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., of
which Mr. Walton is chairman, also uses recycled computer
paper, while McDonald's Corp. is big on recycled copier
paper.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Recycled paper has invaded the executive suite despite
price, quality and supply problems. A small but growing
number of big, high-profile companies are seizing on recycled
"white" paper as a highly visible way to demonstrate their
environmental concern to shareholders, customers, employees
and others.</p>
<p>Although it can cost 5% to 10% more than virgin office
paper, using recycled paper "is still the right thing to do,"
says Kevin Heniff, McDonald's senior print graphics manager.
He adds that McDonald's stationery even carries a watermark
showing a McDonald's arch inside the standard triangular
symbol for recycled products, plus the phrase "McDonald's
Recycled Paper."</p>
<p>A McDonald's spokesman says that had McDonald's annual
report been printed on virgin paper, "We could have gotten
crispier, more brilliant" pictures of food. Still, recycled
paper was "more than satisfactory," he says. (On the other
hand, the color graphics in Wal-Mart's annual report look
rather faded.)</p>
<p>At Procter & Gamble Co., the problem has been finding
enough recycled paper on which to print the consumer-products
company's in-house magazine. Still, when P&G Chairman Edward
Artzt recently spoke to financial analysts, 80,000 copies of
his speech were printed on recycled paper and sent to every
P&G English-speaking employee. Moreover, P&G is "looking to"
using recycled stationery, a spokeswoman says.</p>
<p>In Roundy's Inc.'s annual report, John R. Dickson,
president and chief executive officer, strikes a commanding,
full-page pose, while off to one side is his written message
to stockholders: "Quality, commitment and concern for our
world dictate our printing Roundy's 1989 annual report on
recycled paper." Roundy's is a Pewaukee, Wis., food concern.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, executives of Walt Disney Co. write their
letters on recycled corporate stationery, although the
recipients mightn't know that because Disney is still
completing plans to print the triangular recycling logo on
each sheet. Kym Murphy, Disney's new vice president of
environmental policy, says he's also working on plans to have
Disney's annual report and business cards made from recycled
paper. Going recycled "isn't simple," he says. "But we're
going to put our money where our mouth is."</p>
<p>McDonald's Mr. Heniff warns prospective corporate buyers
not to assume that all recycled paper includes the standard
10% "post-consumer" fiber. Some manufacturers, he says, tried
to sell McDonald's a "recycled" product that pretty much had
only mill scrap and the like. (Current federal policy allows
manufacturers to say their product meets federal recycling
guidelines without the paper's having been used by the
public.)</p>
<p>Paper manufacturers get their true post-consumer paper
from a variety of sources. Future Fibres Group Inc., a
private company that markets a line called Sav-A-Source, uses
a lot of old school books. International Paper Co.'s
Hammermill unit makes recycled copier paper out of the likes
of canceled checks and old envelopes. Supply, though, is a
problem, says Carol Baker, an IP product-development manager,
because there isn't yet an infrastructure to collect old
white paper from homes.</p>
