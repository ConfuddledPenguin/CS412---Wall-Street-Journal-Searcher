	<p class="article-leader">Curtice Burns Foods Inc., Rochester, N.Y., said it expects
to report a 40% decline in profit for the June 29 fiscal year
as sales rose about 10%.
   In fiscal 1989, the processor of regionally branded food
products earned $14.9 million, or $1.78 a share, adjusted for
a 3-for-2 split paid Dec. 20. Sales in fiscal 1989 were
$807.3 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it was hurt by a short crop of canning
and freezing vegetables in the Northeast, lower sales in its
meatsnack business and reduced sales of oat bran. Other
factors included costs related to development activities, and
plant and administrative consolidations.</p>
<p>This year will mark only the second time since 1980 that
earnings haven't increased over the previous period, the
company said.</p>
<p>Curtice Burns said that it considers its problems
short-term, and that it expects a return to its historic rate
of earnings in the next fiscal year. The company said crop
conditions have returned to normal this year, recent
acquisitions are producing satisfactory profits, and a major
portion of consolidation expenses are behind it.</p>
