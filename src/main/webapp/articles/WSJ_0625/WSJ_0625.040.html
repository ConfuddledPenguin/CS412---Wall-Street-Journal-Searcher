	<p class="article-leader">Grumman Corp. is offering early retirement incentives to
6,000 employees, or 21% of its work force, in an effort to
bring its employment level in line with dwindling government
contracts.
   If half the eligible employees accept the offer, as
expected, the defense contractor could save $100 million a
year in expenses, say securities analysts who follow the
company. But that wouldn't lead to any lifting of earnings
estimates for Grumman because "they almost have to {cut
employment} to stay whole," said Michael S. Rosen, an analyst
at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Grumman, based in Bethpage, N.Y., said that the retirement
offer is the result of a companywide cost-cutting study and
that acceptance "is completely voluntary." A spokeswoman said
the company is "hoping" the response will obviate future
layoffs. Dismissals may still be necessary, however, because
Grumman's "employment target is still moving" as the
cost-reduction study continues, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The company, which primarily makes Navy warplanes and
other aerospace systems, said the retirement inducements are
being offered to "pension eligible" employees. The plan
provides for a supplement to accrued pension benefits, the
Grumman spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Grumman's need to cut employment follows decisions in
recent Defense Department budgets that slashed spending and
set expiration dates for the company's biggest production
programs. These include the carrier-based A-6E bomber and the
EA-6B radar-jamming aircraft, which are scheduled to go out
of production next year. Production funds for Grumman's F14D
Navy fighter will run out in 1993.</p>
<p>Through layoffs and attrition, Grumman pared its
employment about 10% last year to its current level of about
28,000 employees.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosen, the Wall Street analyst, said Grumman officials
told him that they expect about half the 6,000 eligible
employees to accept the early retirement offer, an estimate
on which Grumman declined to comment. Nevertheless, Mr. Rosen
said he is sticking to his estimate for Grumman to earn about
$60 million, or $1.75 a share, this year, on $3.6 billion in
revenue. In 1989 Grumman earned $67.3 million, or $1.91 a
share, on revenue of $3.6 billion.</p>
<p>"When you do the math on these things, it never seems to
get to the bottom line," Mr. Rosen said of the expected
savings. "These are necessary savings that Grumman and other
defense companies have to do to keep their heads above
water," he said.</p>
