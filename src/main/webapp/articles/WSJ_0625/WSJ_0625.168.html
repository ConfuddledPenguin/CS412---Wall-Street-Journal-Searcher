	<p class="article-leader">HONG KONG -- Earlier this year, an analyst asked William
Purves to assess Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.'s
international operations. The chairman replied dryly that the
record speaks for itself.
   And so it does.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For 1989, the bank's U.S. and Australian subsidiaries
required huge loan-loss provisions, as did Britain's Midland
Bank PLC, in which Hongkong Bank has a 14.9% stake. Hongkong
Bank has fared only slightly better in its international
securities-trading operations: James Capel & Co., its
100%-owned London-based brokerage firm, and Carroll McEntee &
McGinley Inc., a dealer in U.S. government securities the
bank bought in 1986, haven't been as successful as expected.
Further, Hongkong Bank recently disclosed that it carries a
sizable loan exposure to the failed finance company British &
Commonwealth Holdings PLC.</p>
<p>Hongkong Bank's dismal record overseas overshadows an
impressive record closer to home: Group profit, which doesn't
include results of many of the bank's troubled foreign
subsidiaries, advanced 11% in 1989 from the previous year,
while assets in the Asian-Pacific region jumped 25%.
Competitors in Asia consider Hongkong Bank to be the
best-managed bank in the region, and it is highly regarded in
the Middle East and Canada.</p>
<p>Still, troubles elsewhere have raised questions about the
bank's ability to succeed in its ambition to become a truly
global financial institution. At the same time, abandoning
that goal would also mean abandoning its much-publicized
combination with Midland, a bank with problems enough of its
own.</p>
<p>"The Midland Bank merger, which was seen as positive for
{Hongkong Bank's} stock, is now an unmitigated disaster," an
analyst wrote in a recent review of the Hong Kong stock
market. "The best thing Mr. Purves can do is cut the losses,
but he will not."</p>
<p>Investors apparently agree. Many who bought Hongkong Bank
stock earlier this year in anticipation of a merger have
since been dumping their shares. The share price has dropped
more than 20% from its highs earlier this year.</p>
<p>Most analysts agree that the two banks are too far along
in their plan to turn back. Still, if Midland's
well-publicized troubles diminish its luster, Hongkong Bank's
problems with its 100%-owned Marine Midland Banks Inc. of the
U.S. and other overseas operations could do the same to it.</p>
<p>Just several months ago, the two banks appeared to be
headed for a fairly simple combination as early as December,
when Hongkong Bank is freed from an accord that freezes its
stake in the British bank. The merger would create the
world's ninth-largest bank; its nearly $240 billion in assets
would make it slightly bigger than Citicorp.</p>
<p>Analysts have speculated that Hongkong Bank would
establish a holding company in Britain to oversee the
combined operations. Such a setup would both satisfy Bank of
England concerns about local ownership of Britain's four
clearing banks and give Hongkong Bank a domicile outside the
colony before 1997, when Hong Kong is to revert to Chinese
rule. (In the eight years following the Communist takeover of
China in 1949, Hongkong Bank lost all but one of its 33
branches on the mainland.)</p>
<p>But the problems at both banks have raised doubts about
how quickly the transaction will be completed. With or
without the merger, Hongkong Bank will have to learn fast the
intricacies of managing a global bank -- something few have
been able to do well in recent years.</p>
<p>Hongkong Bank didn't create all its problems; sagging
economies hurt several of its overseas operations. Nor is it
alone. Dozens of banks have been stung after venturing into
new and unknown markets, and even by misjudging their home
markets.</p>
<p>However, Hongkong Bank also must confront a unique
problem: The home market it dominates is a tiny British
colony with a population of roughly six million, and the
market is already saturated. Hongkong Bank is the largest
non-Japanese Asian-based bank and the 30th-largest in the
world, making even all of Asia seem slightly confining. The
rational response to these factors, and to the reversion of
Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, would seem to be global
expansion.</p>
<p>That is what Hongkong Bank was thinking three years ago
when it bought its Midland stake. The purchase was an
extension of Sir Michael Sandberg's grand design to transform
the bank into a global player. Under Sir Michael, who served
as chairman from 1977 to 1986, the bank expanded rapidly into
the U.S., Australia, Canada and China, and entered the
securities business world-wide.</p>
<p>In these efforts, the bank encountered aggressive
competitors with similar ambitions. Its local operations
fared well when the local economy was expanding, but often
took a hit when the economy flagged. "If you look at a lot of
problems the bank has been having, they are throwbacks to the
Sandberg era," says Steven Thompson, investment analyst for
County NatWest Securities Asia Ltd.</p>
<p>Enter Mr. Purves, a nuts-and-bolts banker who has been
trying since taking up his post in 1986 to bring order to the
bank he inherited from Sir Michael. The job has been tough.
"I don't think it's possible to brilliantly manage a bank
once it gets to a global size," says Chris Munden, a research
analyst with Elders Roach Asia Ltd., a subsidiary of the
Elders Finance Group Ltd. of Australia.</p>
<p>In Australia, Mr. Purves's team has reduced the bank's
exposure to struggling entrepreneur Alan Bond, estimated to
have been as much as $1 billion at one time.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Hongkong Bank's original intention was to buy
a major money-center bank, but it eventually bought Marine
Midland, whose operations are concentrated in upstate New
York, with a presence in New York City.</p>
<p>"The great thing about Hongkong Bank was that it had no
exposure to less-developed-country debt," says an analyst at
a U.S. investment bank in Hong Kong. However, buying Marine
Midland gave the bank its first taste of Third World debt
management.</p>
<p>In 1989, Marine Midland added $414 million to provisions
against losses on developing-country loans, an 84% increase.
The bank's nonperforming loans totaled $1.2 billion at the
end of the year.</p>
<p>The parent bank also took big losses when the property
market in the U.S. Northeast, Marine Midland's prime market,
soured last year.</p>
<p>Disappointment has also accompanied Hongkong Bank's push
into international securities trading. The James Capel
brokerage operation recovered last year from a loss in 1988,
only to post a loss for the first quarter of this year. And
Carroll McEntee & McGinley, the U.S. government securities
dealer, last year had its second consecutive annual loss.</p>
<p>Asia remains Hongkong Bank's area of special strength.
Profits increased for nearly all of its operations in 25
countries across Asia and the Middle East last year. And
despite the bank's push into new, more distant markets, its
assets in the Asian-Pacific region rose to 48% of total
assets last year from 40% in 1986.</p>
<p>Though worries about Hong Kong after 1997 have figured
largely in the bank's global expansion, it is committed to
retaining a strong presence in the colony, which analysts
estimate now accounts for about 20% of business. IBCA Ltd., a
London-based credit-rating agency, estimates that more than
40% of the bank group's deposits derive from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Given that, and the concentration of assets in Asia, some
analysts say Hongkong Bank would do best to drop its global
expansion plans altogether to concentrate on its successful
regional businesses and its more-distant successes in the
Middle East and Canada.</p>
<p>Deputy chairman John Gray won't hear of such talk, but
acknowledges that "if you look out from Asia-Pacific, it's
very difficult to find areas which offer the same rewards."</p>
