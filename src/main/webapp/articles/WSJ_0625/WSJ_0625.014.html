	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- As PaineWebber Group Inc. embarks upon a
strategy of focusing squarely on stocks rather than bonds, it
is betting that two heads are better than one.
   The firm recently launched a 1,200-employee Capital
Markets division run by a man-and-woman team, including a
former research director who now holds one of the highest
positions any woman has attained on Wall Street.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What PaineWebber has done is to combine its institutional
sales, trading and research operations for both stocks and
bonds under a new umbrella known as Capital Markets. Jointly
heading the world-wide division are two 43-year-old
executives who formerly ran the firm's U.S. stock operations,
Charles Milligan and Margo Alexander.</p>
<p>"The '80s were certainly the decade of leverage and debt,"
Ms. Alexander says. "In the '90s, we will have the
`re-equitization' of industry." PaineWebber never has been a
big bond house, and in fact has trimmed its bond sales,
research and trading operations in the past two years.
PaineWebber Chairman Donald Marron denies the firm wants to
shrink further in bonds, and says the new division simply
reflects "a desire on the part of clients to see a closer
link between equities, debt and futures."</p>
<p>It is rare to find a woman at Ms. Alexander's level on
Wall Street. Ms. Alexander is a Harvard Business School
graduate, with nearly 20 years of Wall Street experience. She
and Mr. Milligan don't shy away from talking about how
unusual it is to find a man-and-woman team running a good
chunk of a major securities firm. And they aren't put out by
the nickname attached to them by irreverent traders at the
firm's midtown Manhattan offices: "The Charlie and Margo
Show."</p>
<p>Mr. Milligan cheerfully shows a visitor a drawing his wife
gave him, after learning that Mr. Milligan would be
co-heading the new department with a woman. The drawing shows
four footprints from left to right, starting with the
footprint of an ape, then a bare human foot, then a man's
shoe, then a woman's heel. Headline: "The Evolution of
Authority."</p>
<p>Mr. Milligan, a former Marine who favors loud outfits such
as red suspenders with a green tie, is the firm's former head
of stock trading. Ms. Alexander says general management
skills are her strong suit. After a decade as a securities
analyst, she was named head of PaineWebber's research
department in 1982. She and Mr. Milligan took over the
institutional stock operations in 1988.</p>
<p>PaineWebber says the firm is committed to a three-pronged
strategy: "gathering" individual investors' assets; expanding
-- while saving money in -- institutional stock sales and
research; and providing investment banking services for
midsized companies.</p>
<p>The two executives say there are practical benefits to the
new team in dealing with outside clients and with PaineWebber
employees. As Mr. Milligan puts it, "I see men who are more
open with Margo, whereas with me, men would see it as a
weakness."</p>
<p>Wall Street never has been known for its management
skills. But Mr. Marron, the chairman, says the new setup will
address that. "They are both good managers," he said; "the
trading and risk management role, which is Charlie, and the
administration, marketing and research, which is Margo."</p>
<p>PaineWebber's customer assets under its control rose 27%
last year to $66 billion. It preserved its strong position in
institutional stock sales and trading, partly through the
acquisition of its first New York Stock Exchange specialist
firm. And it has increased its ranking as an investment bank.
Though it is far from an underwriting powerhouse, for this
year through June 4, PaineWebber ranked fourth among all
investment banks in underwriting fees, reaping $77 million,
or an 8.5% market share, compared with $77.9 million, or a
5.6% market share, in last year's first half, according to
Securities Data Co.</p>
<p>Lawrence Eckenfelder, a brokerage industry analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. who has a "hold"
recommendation on PaineWebber stock, says: "The banking
strategy at PaineWebber is probably the right one, focusing
more on the middle market, developing niches where they have
expertise. I think they're making money in institutional
equity, but where the real money will come is on the
underwriting side; they're well-positioned on midsized
companies, and they do have a strong research effort."</p>
<p>Mr. Milligan and Ms. Alexander say they want to expand the
firm's stock trading and research presence, particularly
outside the U.S. A big part of PaineWebber's strategy has
been the dicey business of revamping how it charges
institutions for stock research that Wall Street for decades
has provided for free.</p>
<p>Along with Morgan Stanley Group Inc., PaineWebber led
efforts to scale back the free services provided by its
institutional stock department. Both firms don't any longer
provide free research services automatically to all
institutions. With trading commissions so low these days,
"It's important for us to pay clients who pay us," Ms.
Alexander says.</p>
<p>Mr. Milligan and Ms. Alexander say they have also saved
money by not hiring too many analysts. The research
department's size -- 45 analysts -- is about the same as it
was in 1984.</p>
<p>"I don't think it'll be evident overnight," Ms. Alexander
says, but clients "will be better served by seeing a more
coordinated approach over product lines."</p>
<p>Despite the talk of a new focus, PaineWebber in the past
has been criticized for trying to do too many things. For
example, when Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. collapsed,
PaineWebber chose to snap up the firm's financial-futures
operation in Paris.</p>
<p>Mr. Marron responds: "We didn't expand in the late '80s
when other people were expanding. We didn't buy a British
brokerage firm and do all those things. There isn't some big
expansion going on (here). . . . We're not dealing with
French stocks, for example." But he says that when an
opportunity pops up, such as Drexel's Paris futures
operation, PaineWebber will buy in.</p>
