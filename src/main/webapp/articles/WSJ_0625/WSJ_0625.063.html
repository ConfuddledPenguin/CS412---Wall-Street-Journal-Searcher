	<p class="article-leader">MILAN, Italy -- Carlo De Benedetti said the effects of the
strong lira will cut into Ing. C. Olivetti & C. S.p.A.'s 1990
group sales by between 300 billion and 400 billion lire ($243
million to $324 million) from what they otherwise would have
been.
   The chairman of the Italian computer and business machines
group also said the strength of the lira will wipe about 100
billion lire off the group's net profit compared with what it
might have been if the lira weren't so strong.</p>
