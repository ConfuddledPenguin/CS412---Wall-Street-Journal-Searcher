	<p class="article-leader">Friction Division Products Inc. agreed to pay $285,000 in
fines as part of a settlement of Labor Department charges of
asbestos-related, workplace health violations.
   The Trenton, N.J., maker of brake pads and linings for
cars and trucks also agreed to pay as much as $1.7 million
more in fines if it violates a consent order by the federal
appeals court in Philadelphia, the department's Occupational
Safety and Health Administration said. The company further
agreed to take a series of actions aimed at abating serious
asbestos-control problems, OSHA said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last July, OSHA proposed fines of $2.7 million against the
company, the largest ever proposed for health violations.</p>
<p>The company agreed to the settlement without admitting
guilt, OSHA said.</p>
<p>Friction Division said that its president was the only
person authorized to comment on the settlement and that he
wasn't immediately available.</p>
