	<p class="article-leader">HOLLYWOOD -- Albert R. Broccoli, producer of the James
Bond films, has put up for sale his interest in the
successful series and rights to the famous British spy's
name.
   Danjaq S.A., Mr. Broccoli's Swiss holding company, owns
the Bond library of 16 films and certain rights to any future
Bond films, television shows or other projects. MGM/UA
Communications Co., Culver City, Calif., holds longterm
distribution rights to the films.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MGM/UA is talking with Mr. Broccoli's representatives
about acquiring his rights, said Dean Stolber, executive vice
president of MGM/UA's entertainment business group. But it is
considered more likely that another buyer will be sought
because negotiations with MGM/UA aren't going well.</p>
<p>An attorney for Mr. Broccoli and Danjaq declined to
discuss the talks and Mr. Broccoli's reasons for selling the
company now. Mr. Broccoli and his partners would continue as
producers of future Agent 007 films after Danjaq is sold, the
attorney said.</p>
<p>While estimates of the library's value weren't available,
film distributors have had a big appetite in recent years for
big-budget action movies. The 17th film in the series is in
development now.</p>
<p>Lazard Freres & Co., the New York investment-banking
concern, is handling the sale for Danjaq.</p>
