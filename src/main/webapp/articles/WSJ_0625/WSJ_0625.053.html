	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Jacor Communications Inc. said it terminated
its agreement to sell FM radio station WMYU in Knoxville,
Tenn., for $11.6 million to Dalton Group Inc. because Dalton
breached terms of the agreement.
   The radio-station operator also filed suit in Hamilton
County common pleas court against Dalton seeking a
determination of rights to Dalton's $500,000 deposit. Jacor
claims Dalton officials failed to show up for the closing of
the agreement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>William Dalton, president of Dalton, based in Potomac,
Md., said, "I don't have any comment, except that we're still
in negotiations" to purchase the station. His company
currently owns one radio station in Cincinnati.</p>
