	<p class="article-leader">Though the West German mark has been stalled for the past
five months, some analysts still think German unification
will lift the currency to new highs and into a more dominant
role in world markets. But this journey will be no
high-speed, trouble-free dash on the autobahn, they warn.
   "There is no precedent for this; it's never been done
before," says Kurt Morgen, a Frankfurt-based member of the
managing board of Dresdner Bank AG.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The engine driving the mark's upward mobility, predict the
bulls, will be a combination of a booming German economy,
higher interest rates, enlarged domestic financial markets
and wider use of the currency in trade and investment,
particularly in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>"The D-mark is going to be the basis for German political
and economic power in Central and Eastern Europe, and
therefore throughout Europe," predicts Peter Rona, president
and chief executive officer of IBJ Schroder Bank & Trust Co.
in New York. Among the implications of this are stronger
German stock and bond markets.</p>
<p>But these forecasts come with timetables that are at least
six months to a year away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, monetary and economic union between East and
West Germany is scheduled to take place Sunday. Apprehension
about its effects has had currency markets on edge since
early February. That's when the mark's 20% rise against the
dollar and yen -- a climb that began last September and
accelerated after the fall of the Berlin Wall in November --
stopped dead in its tracks.</p>
<p>In late New York trading Friday, the dollar stood at
1.6745 marks and 154.85 yen, compared with 1.6778 marks and
154.80 yen late Thursday. Meanwhile, the British pound rose
to $1.7330 from $1.7200.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar was quoted at
155.10 yen; it closed Friday in Tokyo at 154.75 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6743
marks, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 1.6796 marks.</p>
<p>Since early February, the mark has mostly traded in a
narrow band of 1.65-1.71 to the dollar. Slowing its advance
were worries over the inflationary impact of the planned
currency union and the huge outlays needed for overhauling
the East German economy.</p>
<p>The mark also has been weakened by concern about growing
turmoil in the Soviet Union, and it is especially vulnerable
to political instability in Eastern Europe because of
Germany's geographic proximity and trade links to the region.</p>
<p>Few traders or economists expect these negative factors to
disappear anytime soon. The West German budget deficit will
be about 50 billion marks ($29.8 million) this year and rise
to 100 billion marks in 1991, predicts David D. Hale, chief
economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.</p>
<p>"The Bundesbank will have to increase its money supply to
make credit available for growth in East Germany and make it
possible for corporations to raise funds they want to invest
in Eastern Europe," says Thomas Barman, head of treasury
operations for Credit Suisse in New York.</p>
<p>At the same time, "it's very clear there will be
Pan-German elections in December or January. Meanwhile,
unemployment in East Germany will rise toward two million,
which will lead to more pressure for government spending,
which raises inflation," warns Mr. Hale. What's more, he
adds: "There's the unknown cost of Germany having to support
the Soviet Union." Last week, Bonn said it will guarantee a
five billion mark bank loan to Moscow.</p>
<p>This spending spree puts the Bundesbank in a bind. If it
tightens monetary policy too quickly, "it could strangle
growth," warns Eric Taze-Bernard, senior economist at Banque
Indosuez in Paris. Yet if its policies are too lax, Germany
risks accelerating inflation and a weakening mark.</p>
<p>"The big short-term, six-month question is the
independence of the Bundesbank," says Mr. Hale. "Can
{Bundesbank President Karl Otto} Poehl be allowed to do what
{Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul} Volcker did in
1981-1982?" -- temper faster growth and inflation with a
tighter monetary policy.</p>
<p>In the long run, Mr. Hale and others are betting he will.
And as a consequence, many of the short-term mark bears
remain long-term bulls.</p>
<p>Economists at Merrill Lynch & Co. see the combination of a
relaxed fiscal and tight monetary policies propelling the
mark to new highs, just as a similar U.S. policy mix sent the
dollar soaring in the early 1980s. Michael Andrews, a Merrill
economist, predicts the mark will eventually rise toward 1.50
marks to the dollar, surpassing its record of 1.56.</p>
<p>"The {mark} will strengthen, because it will attract
capital," says Mr. Barman of Credit Suisse. "The German stock
market is going to look very, very attractive in years to
come."</p>
<p>Mr. Rona of IBJ-Schroder envisions the evolution of a huge
trading bloc in Eastern Europe that uses the mark as its
payments currency. Neither the Soviet Union nor any of its
six former East bloc satellites -- Poland, East Germany,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania or Bulgaria -- have
convertible currencies. Up to now, trade within the group --
the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, or Comecon -- has
been paid for in so-called "convertible rubles," a hybrid
that is essentially a system of credits and debits.</p>
<p>But as of Jan. 1, 1991, trade between the seven will be
conducted in hard currencies. Besides East Germany, Mr. Rona
believes other East bloc nations will adopt the mark for
trade transactions. "Poland, Romania, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia will be filing up to join," he argues.
"Imports, exports, investment decisions and returns will all
be calculated in D-marks." Even domestic prices and wages
will be figured in marks, he predicts.</p>
<p>Germany "can create a Deutsche mark zone throughout
Europe," asserts Mr. Rona. Already, the Dutch, Swiss and
Austrian currencies are closely tied to the mark, and the
currency has long been the linchpin of the European Monetary
System's exchange rate mechanism, a joint float of nine
European currencies.</p>
<p>"Given the economic links in the region, the mark could
emerge as a more important global currency," says Kemper's
Mr. Hale.</p>
<p>The mark's status could be further cemented by the pivotal
role German companies and banks are expected to play in
Eastern Europe's development. Already, "Germany is the
biggest supplier of credit to Eastern Europe and its biggest
western trading partner," adds Michael Rosenberg, a vice
president at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>George Noble, a portfolio manager at Fidelity Management
and Research Co. in Boston, says that one top Italian
executive called Eastern Europe "a private German hunting
preserve."</p>
<p>Analysts also predict that the large costs of funding
German reunification will lead to a rapid growth in the
German bond, stock, short-term money and futures markets.
"That," says Mr. Hale, "will encourage increased use of the
mark."</p>
<p>Not everyone, however, buys the supermark argument. David
M. Mars, European economist for S.G. Warburg Securities Ltd.
in London, predicts the Bundesbank won't be able to check the
inflationary pressures that unification unleashes. He argues
that despite the central bank's solid reputation as an
inflation fighter, it has oversold its ability to control the
German money supply and remain independent of politics.</p>
<p>Mr. Mars says that at some point, five new members of the
central bank's governing council will come from East Germany
and "they will constantly fight for easier credit policies."
He adds: "Poehl and the rest of the council aren't going to
raise interest rates to fight inflation, and the mark will
weaken."</p>
<p>Mr. Mars also questions East Germans' work ethic after
more than four decades of life under communist rule. Within
six months, he says, "people will start to look for an
alternative to the mark." He predicts it will be the French
franc. Backed by a big economy and a government committed to
low inflation, "France will look like a zone of stability,"
he says.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for
current delivery settled at $350.40 an ounce, down 30 cents.
Estimated volume was a moderate 2.5 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Monday, gold was quoted at $350.35 an ounce.</p>
