	<p class="article-leader">The valiant budget summitteers seem to have agreed on one
thing. The costs of the Savings and Loan bailout do not have
to be included in total budget expenditures, at least not for
the purpose of determining how much expenditures have to be
cut or taxes increased to meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit
target.
   For a change, this politically convenient decision has the
support of distinguished economists. Thus, more than a year
ago (March 1, 1989) Martin Feldstein, former chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers, said on this page:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The proposed thrift-rescue plan is fundamentally
different from other debt-financed spending because the
outlays are essentially only a formal recognition of
government liabilities that already exist. The $50 billion of
new government outlays will therefore not cause spending on
goods and services to rise and will not reduce the pool of
funds available to finance private investment in plant and
equipment or housing."</p>
<p>Since that was written, of course, we have discovered that
we are talking about much more than $50 billion. And just the
other day (June 19) Robert Eisner, former president of the
American Economic Association, repeated the Feldstein
argument on this page, saying:</p>
<p>"Current government borrowing to finance the purchase of
S&L assets only makes explicit an element of deficit or debt
that was implicit earlier in the commitment of backing to S&L
liabilities -- the deposits or money of S&L creditors. . . .
{T}he S&L bailout has nothing to do with the current budget
deficit."</p>
<p>The argument is ingenious, but I do not find it
convincing. The liabilities that already exist and are now
being formally recognized were incurred earlier, mainly in
the 1980s when the S&Ls had losses that the Federal
government had committed itself to make good to the
depositors. These liabilities were not included in government
expenditures when they were incurred. Now it is proposed to
exclude them when they are recognized. This is a plan to keep
the government's books on a cash basis when obligations are
incurred and on an accrual basis when the obligations are
paid off. That would really be Wonderland.</p>
<p>Following that principle, we could exclude from the
current budget all expenditure for Social Security benefits
because the obligation to pay those benefits was incurred
long ago and today's payments are only a formal recognition
of liabilities that already exist.</p>
<p>There are two reasons -- one economic and one political --
for setting a limit to the government's deficit. The economic
reason is to protect the growth of the nation's capital stock
by limiting the extent to which the government's deficit
absorbs private saving and crowds out private investment. The
political reason is to limit government spending to the
amount the government and the public are willing to pay for
explicitly. Both reasons argue for including the S&L losses
in expenditures today.</p>
<p>The nation's capital stock is now smaller than it would
have been if there had been no deposit insurance. One may
take the clearest example. Suppose that between 1981 and 1988
the owner-operators of the S&Ls stole $100 billion from
depositors -- which is, of course, not entirely true. Then
the owners spent $100 billion on Mercedeses and champagne.
But the depositors who lost the money did not cut their
purchases of Chevrolets and beer by the same amount, because
the government had committed itself to make their losses
good. There was more consumption and less investment than
there would have been in the absence of the government
commitment. It is as if the government had borrowed the $100
billion from the depositors and given it to the
owner-operators.</p>
<p>Or, suppose that the $100 billion had been lost because it
had been invested in projects that were no good -- houses
that no one wanted to live in, for example. One hundred
billion dollars of the nation's saving had been crowded out
of productive investment. Because the government insured
their deposits, however, the depositors did not feel any loss
and did not feel any need to increase their saving to restore
their assets.</p>
<p>In any case, because of the government's commitment, there
was more consumption than there would have been without it
and less investment during the period when the losses were
being incurred. Some will say that is water over the dam or,
as economists put it, bygones are forever bygones. Perhaps
these losses should have been counted as government
expenditures when the government's liability was incurred,
but there is no point to counting them as expenditures now,
they will say.</p>
<p>But the consequences of these losses are not bygones. We
are left with a smaller stock of productive capital than we
would have had if the government had not insured the
deposits. That is a present fact that is relevant to present
budget decisions. Unless we are satisfied with the loss of
the capital stock, we should take steps to compensate for it
now. One way to do that would be to include the outlays in
expenditures now and cover them by additional revenues or
reduced expenditures for other purposes.</p>
<p>The political argument for paying the costs of the S&L
bailout is, in my opinion, even stronger than the economic
one. Someone in the government, or many more than one, made
bad mistakes about the S&Ls. They allowed the government's
liability, through the insurance of deposits, to get far out
of line with the government's willingness or ability to limit
its risks by regulating the S&Ls. Some will say that the
insurance was too big. Others will say that the regulation
was too weak. I do not want to enter that argument now. But
surely the insurance was too big for the regulation or the
regulation was too weak for the insurance. And someone is
responsible for allowing that to happen.</p>
<p>If the costs of the S&L bailout are included in the budget
that the public has to pay for explicitly, either in higher
taxes or in reduced expenditures for other purposes, there
will be a demand to find out how that happened and who was
responsible. That will be unpleasant for some people, but it
will induce more prudence in the future. On the other hand,
if the S&L thing is swept under the rug as far as today's
public is concerned, politicians will be reassured that there
is no limit to the liabilities they can safely incur in the
taxpayers' name.</p>
