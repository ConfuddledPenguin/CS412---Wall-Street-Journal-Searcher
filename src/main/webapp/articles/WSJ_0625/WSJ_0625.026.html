	<p class="article-leader">Nelson Mandela, quoted in Friday's early edition of the
New York Times, on the Puerto Rican nationalists, seated in
the VIP row of a Mandela rally in Harlem, who spent 25 years
in prison for shooting five congressmen from the House
gallery in 1954:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We support the cause of anyone who is fighting for
self-determination, and our attitude is the same, no matter
who it is. I would be honored to sit on the platform with the
four comrades whom you refer to.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>James E. McClure and T. Norman Van Cott, of the Ball State
University economics department, in the summer issue of the
Indiana Policy Review:</p>
<p>Advocates of educational choice in primary-secondary
schooling . . . direct attention to fragmentary evidence
offered by primary-secondary school districts that have
implemented choice -- East Harlem in New York City being
cited most frequently. While the latter evidence is
important, it surely strikes many Americans as case-specific,
anecdotal, and insufficient to warrant a general
restructuring of primary-secondary education.</p>
<p>Bringing the evidence from U.S. higher education to bear
on the educational choice issue overcomes these concerns.
Indeed, educational choice is revealed to be alive and well
in all 50 states. It is not the "pig in the poke" many
suggest. . . .</p>
<p>With higher education, students satisfying admissions
requirements can attend any publicly supported school in
their state. Colleges and universities, therefore, must
compete for student enrollment by offering attractive
educational packages.</p>
<p>Each year, parents of high school seniors become aware of
this competition. Deprived of captive students, colleges and
universities employ a variety of marketing techniques to
entice students to their campus. . . .</p>
<p>No doubt many professors, considering themselves above the
marketplace, label these competitive activities "raw
commercialism." Nevertheless, the competition keeps these
"professionals" attuned to their customers. From society's
point of view, of course, the salutary consequences of
colleges' self-interested pursuit of students is a system of
higher education without equal.</p>
