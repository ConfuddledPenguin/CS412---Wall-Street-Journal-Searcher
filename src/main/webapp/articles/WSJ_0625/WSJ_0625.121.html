	<p class="article-leader">The Buick division of General Motors Corp., Flint, Mich.,
said its substantially redesigned 1991 Park Avenue model, now
going on sale, will start at $24,385, up 12% from the 1990
Electra Park Avenue model it replaces.
   A more heavily equipped version, the 1991 Park Avenue
Ultra, will start at $27,420, down 1% from the model it
replaces.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new, full-size Park Avenues have improved engines and
transmissions and sleeker, more aerodynamic looks than their
boxy predecessors. Buick said the new Park Avenue model will
cost more in part because such equipment as anti-lock brakes,
driver's-side airbag and an anti-theft device are now
standard.</p>
<p>The 1991 Park Avenue Ultra's base price is $405 lower in
part because Buick took out a seat that adjusted in 20
directions and replaced it with one that adjusted in just
eight directions.</p>
<p>Buick also said it will eliminate two other models, the
Electra Limited and the Electra T-type, that were built off
the same chassis as the Park Avenue in the 1990 model year.</p>
