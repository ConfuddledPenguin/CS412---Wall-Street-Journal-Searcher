	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- For most of his 28 years on the Supreme
Court, Justice Byron White has been an enigmatic figure, and
the court's current term, expected to end this week, is no
exception to that rule.
   He has long been considered part of the court's
conservative majority, a characterization that remained apt
this term. Liberal pundits have mused for decades that his
appointment in 1962 was one of President Kennedy's biggest
blunders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yet, he provided the court's liberal wing -- Justices
William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and John
Stevens -- with their fifth vote in each of the handful of
5-4 decisions they have won thus far this term, except for
the ruling striking down the federal flag-burning law.</p>
<p>At first glance, some of his votes this term appear
surprising. He wrote the 5-4 decision in April that upheld
federal judges' broad authority to correct illegal school
segregation; he ruled that a judge may order the Kansas City
School District to raise taxes to pay for desegregation.</p>
<p>Although he is generally loath to expand constitutional
protections for accused criminals, he joined Justice
Brennan's 5-4 opinion in January barring the use of illegally
obtained evidence to shake the credibility of a defendant's
witnesses. And last month, he joined another Brennan 5-4
opinion barring the manslaughter prosecution of an individual
who has already pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of drunken
driving for an accident that caused a death.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, he joined still another 54 Brennan ruling.
This one said that the First Amendment prohibits the hiring,
promotion and transfer of state and local government workers
based on their political party affiliations.</p>
<p>Justice White's vote in that case came despite a
dissenting admonition by Justice Antonin Scalia that most
federal judges and Supreme Court justices owe their
appointments to the patronage system. Justice Scalia might
well have been addressing the 73-year-old Justice White, who
was a friend and campaign supporter of President Kennedy and
was serving as an aide to Attorney General Robert Kennedy
when they picked him for the court.</p>
<p>These decisions by Justice White seem out of place in a
voting record that is largely conservative; he has been a
leading critic of the constitutional right to abortion,
affirmative action that discriminates against whites, the
court's effort to erect a wall between church and state, and
the court's rulings affording the news media protection
against libel lawsuits.</p>
<p>But court experts who have followed his tenure closely
don't find his half-dozen votes with the liberals this term
surprising. "A review of his opinions reveals a significant
consistency in perspective, method and conviction," says Kate
Stith, a Yale Law School professor and former White law
clerk.</p>
<p>His consistency becomes apparent when one considers the
court's gradual swing to the right, according to Ms. Stith.
In an article she recently completed, she says Justice White
was in the majority in fewer than half of the 5-4 decisions
in the 1960s, a period in which the court vastly expanded
constitutional rights. In the 1970s, as the expansion of
rights slowed in some areas and halted in others, he was in
the majority in about two-thirds of the 5-4 cases.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, as the court took an ever narrower view of
its role and of the Constitution, Justice White was on the
winning side of three-fourths of 5-4 rulings. And his
percentage is still increasing.</p>
<p>But his occasional liberal votes also are consistent, she
says, with principles and precedents of the court that he has
accepted. She says the Kansas City schools case demonstrates
how Justice White has long taken a broad view of the
authority of federal courts to eliminate past discrimination
in the public schools.</p>
<p>That consistency may be put to one of its toughest tests
in the court's next term, when the justices grapple with the
issue of when a city may be released from a court-ordered
obligation to desegregate its schools.</p>
