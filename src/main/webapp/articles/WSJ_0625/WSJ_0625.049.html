	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Stock promoter Murray Pezim
refused to complete a transaction that would have raised
Corona Corp.'s stake in Prime Resources Group Inc. to 45%
from 20%. Prime Resources owns 50% of Canada's hottest gold
prospect.
   Mr. Pezim, Prime's chairman as well as honorary chairman
of Corona, earlier vowed to derail the transaction unless
Corona altered the terms. Terms call for Mr. Pezim and two
other large Prime holders to swap their 10.2 million Prime
shares for an equal number of Corona Class A shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The parties agreed to exend the closing date to July 5,
though Mr. Pezim said he won't close unless Corona revises
the pact. Corona's spokesman said it expects Mr. Pezim to
stand by the initial agreement.</p>
<p>In Toronto Stock Exchange trading Friday, Corona's Class A
shares, which have sagged in recent weeks, closed unchanged
at seven Canadian dollars (US$5.95) each. Prime, which is
listed on the Vancouver Stock Exchange, closed at C$9.62 a
share, up 12.5 Canadian cents.</p>
<p>The private transaction is part of a complex plan under
which Corona hopes to secure control of British Columbia's
big Eskay Creek gold deposit, now widely acknowledged as the
largest gold discovery in Canada since Ontario's Hemlo find
in the early 1980s. Corona had hoped the purchase would help
cement its control of Prime.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Corona and rival Placer Dome Inc., Vancouver,
are battling for control of Prime's Eskay Creek partner,
Stikine Resources Ltd. Placer Dome has so far acquired about
45% of Stikine under a tender offer that was extended to July
4. For its part, Corona agreed to a lock-up pact with a group
that owns 42% of Stikine and has offered to acquire the rest
through a stock swap.</p>
<p>Mr. Pezim once controlled Corona's predecessor and played
a big role in financing its early exploration at Hemlo. A
Toronto group, led by Ned Goodman, Corona's chairman,
acquired control of Corona in the mid-1980s.</p>
