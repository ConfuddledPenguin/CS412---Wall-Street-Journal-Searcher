	<p class="article-leader">KNOKKE-HEIST, Belgium -- At a NATO-Japan mutual security
discussion in this seaside town a few days ago, an editor of
the Hokkaido Shinbun Press, sitting beside me at dinner,
wondered if I could explain why we were there. He wanted to
know why, if the Soviet Union is falling apart, anyone thinks
there still is a security threat to either Japan or the 16
NATO countries.
   It is a good question. A lot of people, including some at
this unprecedented NATO-Japan conference, already have
assumed the answer: There is no threat. A few of those
engaged in the discussion (we journalists were only
observers) were even predicating their analysis on "peace
dividend" developments that have not yet occurred, such as a
successful conclusion of the Vienna CFE negotiations that are
meant to bring about sharp reductions in conventional forces
in Europe.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If some of these supposedly hardheaded national-security
specialists are delirious over the "end of history" and other
such speculative formulations, it should be no surprise that
politicians are even further down that road. Throughout
Europe and the U.S. there are strong pressures for sharp cuts
in defense budgets. By contrast, Japan's defense spending
will continue to grow at about 3% annually over the next five
years, according to an unofficial estimate, but even in Japan
there is rising debate over whether those increments are
necessary. Until now, the defense budget, which is only about
1% of Japan's GNP, has not stirred much public emotion.</p>
<p>Objective reality -- an expression favored by Marxists
until their own objective reality became so stark -- does
indeed suggest an absence of threat. The Red Army is
withdrawing, albeit slowly, from Central Europe. The Warsaw
Pact has crumbled with the emergence of popular governments
in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and East Germany. The rise
of nationalism within the Soviet republics themselves has
cast doubt on the reliability of the non-Russian troops who
are a major component of the Soviet armed forces. And there
are, of course, expectations that the CFE talks ultimately
will bring about a major withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Central Europe.</p>
<p>But therein lies the paradox of the Knokke meeting. Just
possibly, the diminution of the threat is itself the threat.
The discussants were not having an easy time trying to cope
with the uncertainties of a radical change in the correlation
of forces. There were references to Margaret Thatcher's
remark, vis-a-vis the Soviet breakup, that ice is most
dangerous when it is melting, but not much analysis of why
that might be true.</p>
<p>In fact, with all due respect to the perceptiveness of
Mrs. Thatcher, it may not be quite on the mark in the Soviet
case. A fragmented Soviet Union, preoccupied with the
disturbed relationships of the Soviet republics, may well be
less dangerous to the outside world than was the Soviet Union
when it could be called with some justification a monolith.
When it had both a central political command and a functional
command economy, it could employ significant resources in
furtherance of its imperial ambitions, whether they might be
the construction of a Pacific fleet or the support of regimes
in Angola and Nicaragua.</p>
<p>But what Mrs. Thatcher really was warning against was not
only what is happening in the Soviet Union but what could
happen in the Western alliance. In the absence of a clear and
present danger, the impulse for disarmament in democratic
nations becomes powerful. There always are far more claims on
national budgets than can be satisfied. Arguments that
weapons no longer are needed are mother to weapons defunding.
The number of people who think of weapons as waste greatly
expands when the world seems less dangerous. The U.S. already
has scheduled a 10% reduction of its defense forces in the
Pacific. Its troop presence in Europe will drop sharply if a
CFE agreement is reached. Cutbacks in defense procurement
began in the Reagan administration.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, by contrast, the defense production
mills grind on, making ships, tanks and missiles. There are
reports that the Soviets are anticipating a CFE agreement,
which would call for scrappage of weapons, by shifting
significant amounts of equipment out of Europe to Asian
deployments or naval air wings that the agreement will not
cover.</p>
<p>So a question arises: Exactly how will the world look five
years from now if the Western allies have significantly
disarmed and the Soviet Union has not? More to the point,
what if there is a huge Russian Federation still under some
form of Communist Party control, with a restored command
economy and still sufficiently well armed to intimidate its
neighbors, including those members of the Soviet Union who
might by then have achieved some measure of independence?
Empires decline, but they also sometimes rise again in a new
guise and with the energy of the imperial power renewed.</p>
<p>But that is only one possibility. Russia is not the only
threat to world peace. What about the possibility of war over
Kashmir between India and Pakistan, both presumed to have
nuclear weapons? Or what about the danger of the
still-ambitious Saddam Hussein of Iraq deciding to use his
still-impressive military power to grab more Middle East oil?
Or the possibility that he or some other Arab militant will
decide to employ chemical or biological weapons against
Israel or each other? Or the danger of new adventures by
Vietnam or North Korea?</p>
<p>Some of those possibilities are fairly remote. But Paul
Wolfowitz, U.S. undersecretary of defense for policy,
reminded the Knokke group of the book "Great Illusion" by
Norman Angell, which argued that war was no longer possible.
A short while later came the outbreak of World War I. Then,
it was the Austro-Hungarian empire that was disintegrating.</p>
<p>So the Knokke meeting was born out of some useful
perceptions. From the U.S. comes a desire to fashion its
separate alliances with Europe and Japan into what Mr.
Wolfowitz called a "new international security framework."
From Japan comes a tentative exploration of the possibility
that it can play a global political role more in keeping with
its economic importance. Japan also has a continuing concern
about Soviet ambitions in the Pacific. And from both Europe
and Japan comes a wish not to be abandoned by a United States
that is beginning to display once more those old-fashioned
isolationism symptoms.</p>
<p>In short, the Knokke gathering was an attempt to prevent a
breakup of the Western alliance that would match or surpass
the disintegration of the Soviet empire. Is that a worthwhile
purpose? In this world of brightening prospects for peace but
vast uncertainties about the future, yes would seem to be the
prudent answer.</p>
