	<p class="article-leader">BURNABY, British Columbia -- Loewen Group Inc., a
funeral-home chain, said it agreed to acquire Houston-based
Paragon Family Services Inc. for $65.5 million.
   Loewen said the purchase, which is subject to various
conditions including board approval and possible adjustment
of the price, is scheduled to close Sept. 18.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Paragon owns and operates 47 funeral homes, mainly in the
south-central U.S., and has agreed to acquire nine more.
Loewen said the acquisition would complement its existing
U.S. operations.</p>
<p>Incorporated in 1985, Loewen spent 131.5 million Canadian
dollars (US$111.8 million) on acquisitions through 1989,
according to analyst Tony Yue of Vancouver's Goepel Shields &
Partners Inc. The company now owns 164 funeral homes, 12
cemeteries and related operations, making it the second
largest funeral-service company in North America, behind
Texas-based Service Corp. International.</p>
<p>Mr. Yue said further acquisitions are likely because fewer
than 5% of the 22,000 U.S. funeral homes are currently owned
by operators with multiple locations. In Canada, about 10% of
the 1,400 homes are owned by chains.</p>
<p>Loewen said Paragon's 185 employees will remain with the
company and that three senior executivies will become senior
officers of Loewen.</p>
