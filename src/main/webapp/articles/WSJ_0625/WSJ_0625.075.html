	<div class="article-body"><p>YOKOSUKA, Japan -- It has become a common scene in the
battle between Japan and the U.S. over pre-eminence in
technology: a laboratory in Japan racing against one in
America to be first in a hot new area of computer science.</p>
<p>In this case, researchers at Nippon Telegraph & Telephone
Corp. here have made big strides in the new field, which
involves building machines that can understand and react to
human speech. Already, the NTT system can recognize 32 words.</p>
<p>Eight thousands miles away, though, at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., U.S. researchers
are way ahead. Their computer has mastered more than 400
words.</p>
<p>But in one of those twists that have become common in
U.S.-Japan technology races, the Japanese may laugh last. For
while the U.S. has a better machine in the laboratory, NTT
hopes to begin actually selling a voice-recognition system as
soon as next year. The MIT scientists, on the other hand,
don't have any immediate plans to take their invention
commercial.</p>
<p>Technology is the future. It drives economic growth and
determines the course of living standards. The U.S., which
has great institutions like MIT and dominance in much basic
research, might think it is entering that future with
promise. Yet while Japanese scientists may win fewer Nobel
Prizes, time and again they do a better job of turning
research into products. "We value creativity and
innovativeness, and we don't value production," says Michael
Dertouzos, director of the MIT computer-science laboratory.
"But the money is not in invention, it's in production."</p>
<p>This difference between the U.S. and Japan is clearly
evident to Japanese business people. "When I first visited
the U.S. in 1953 and 1954, Americans were producing very good
goods," says Yotaro Iida, the blunt-talking chairman of
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. "But recently, America has
stopped making things. And as America stops making things,
Japan steps in."</p>
<p>Peter Likins, the president of Lehigh University, blames
federal government science policy, which, he says, tends to
promote basic research, defense and medical science at the
expense of everything else. "The culture of the university,
shaped by government decisions, directed a whole generation
of engineers away from commercial work," Mr. Likins argues.</p>
<p>Michael Porter, a Harvard Business School professor, puts
the problem in broader sweep. Nations, he theorizes, move
through three stages: First, they are driven by the natural
advantages of their people, geography and resources; second,
as they advance, they become driven by innovation, pushing
the frontiers of technology; finally, they are driven by
wealth, which creates "a backward-looking, rearguard action
to protect what they've got." Mr. Porter worries that the
U.S. may be in that third, look-over-the-shoulder stage.</p>
<p>Now, major U.S. institutions like MIT find themselves in
something of an identity crisis. Throughout most of its
postwar history, this university saw itself in global terms:
Its purpose was to spread technological progress throughout
the world. Its doors were open to all, its research available
to all. If this meant providing technology to foreign
competitors of American companies, then so be it. If
countries that took advantage of MIT's research did most of
their own work in private companies, where it was unavailable
to Americans, then that was all right, too.</p>
<p>Today, that attitude is changing, as the school wrestles
with its responsibility to help keep the U.S. competitive.
One sign: a new book, co-authored by Mr. Dertouzos, called
"Made in America." Economic nationalism is on the rise.</p>
<p>"Does the university have a national mission?" asks
Kenneth Smith, vice president for research. People on campus
"never even asked that question before." It was simply taken
for granted that the school's interests were consistent with
the national interest. "But now, it's not that apparent." As
a result, he says, the university has begun rethinking its
role.</p>
<p>Leading MIT professors fret openly that Japanese companies
appear far more interested in the university's research than
American companies do. Two decades ago, Harry Smith, an
electrical engineering professor, and his colleague David
Spears did pathbreaking work in the development of X-ray
lithography, a technology for printing tiny and complex
circuits on semiconductors. Today in Japan, Mr. Smith says,
there are 10 major programs for the development of X-ray
lithography; in the U.S., there are two.</p>
<p>"It should bother everybody," he says. "All the (U.S.)
semiconductor industry except IBM has a very short-term
view."</p>
<p>Ronald Latanision shares that frustration. Mr. Latanision
is director of MIT's Materials Processing Center, which is
working on materials such as high-strength ceramics and
composite metals that may someday replace steel and plastic.
The center's research is open to any company willing to pay a
$10,000 fee. Between 50% and 60% of the companies involved
are American; about half the rest are Japanese. But Mr.
Latanision says the Japanese participate with an enthusiasm
that outstrips that of Americans.</p>
<p>The Japanese are doing their most advanced research under
the auspices of private companies. Sure, American companies
are denied access to that research, says Mr. Latanision, but
the real problem is much broader than that: American firms
"aren't even taking advantage of what they can do here."</p>
<p>Moreover, people in Japan's giant corporate research labs
are encouraged to care as much about the practical
applications of technology as about pure research. Joyce and
Nathanael Fortune have seen this fundamental difference from
the inside of Japanese industry.</p>
<p>The couple, both 28 years old, are among the first of a
new wave of American scientists to migrate to Japan for an
extended stay. Mr. Fortune, who has a doctorate in physics,
is doing work at an electronics lab operated by Japan's
Ministry of International Trade and Industry. Ms. Fortune,
who has a Ph.D. in engineering, is the lone foreigner in a
300-person lab operated by NTT.</p>
<p>"In graduate school in the United States, everybody wants
to be in basic research," not commercial research, Ms.
Fortune says. "It's more aesthetically pleasing." Graduate
students, she says, believe that "if you join a company, your
work may not be published and you won't advance as a
scientist."</p>
<p>In Japan, the incentives are reversed. Universities are
poorly funded, and much of the most important work occurs
within companies. Scientists and engineers who join those
companies aren't expected to pursue their own scientific
curiosity, but rather to work toward breakthroughs that will
help the company. Japanese scientists who come up with
innovations to this end "can write their own ticket" at most
companies, Ms. Fortune says.</p>
<p>Back at NTT in Yokosuka, the potential gain from that sort
of thinking is clear. Yoshitake Suzuki, a researcher, is
demonstrating the company's fledgling voice-recognition
computer system. His program is designed to take a
reservation for an imaginary drivers' training class.
"Drivers' Training School Reservation System," the computer
announces. "Please enter your identification number."</p>
<p>Mr. Suzuki responds slowly through a microphone. "One.
Two. Three. Four." The computer confirms the number and,
after several more seconds of carefully contrived
"conversation," books Mr. Suzuki a lesson at noon on the
25th. Mr. Suzuki then lets his visitor book a reservation,
proving that the computer can also understand voices it has
never heard. "You could use a system like this for making a
doctor's appointment or ordering merchandise," Mr. Suzuki
says.</p>
<p>John Stern, the American Electronics Association's vice
president for Asian operations in Tokyo, sees this fervid
pursuit of technology as an outgrowth of the culture at
Japanese corporations. They don't exist just for the
enrichment of their stockholders, he contends, but also pay a
great deal of attention to the needs of their employees, who
expect to work for them their entire lives.</p>
<p>"Is there anybody in an American company who says, `My job
is to see that this company is still in business 10 years
from now?'" Mr. Stern asks. "In Japan, people have to worry
about continuing to provide employment."</p>
<p>To power the research and development to produce those
jobs, one also, of course, needs deep pockets. And that's
another reason the Japanese have an edge in commercializing
technology -- they have lots of money to invest. Take
biotechnology. Increasingly, U.S. biotech startups, hungry
for financing, are getting acquired by the Japanese, or find
themselves going hat in hand to Japan in pursuit of capital.</p>
<p>On a beat-up side street in Cambridge, Mass., a U.S.
company called Matritech Inc., founded in 1987, is working on
new products to help detect diseases such as cancer. But
Matritech, which wants to stay independent, needs money to
take some of those projects the next step. So Stephen Chubb,
its president, packed a bag and headed to Japan. "We are
talking to U.S. and European companies too," he says, "but
there's a disproportionate interest on the part of the
Japanese." Eventually, several Japanese companies proffered
financing.</p>
<p>During his visit, Mr. Chubb also saw firsthand how Japan
tends to make longterm commitments. While at a cultural
center, he learned of a time capsule the Japanese have sealed
-- and don't plan to open for another 5,000 years. "How long
would someone put a time capsule in the ground in this
country?" he asks. "That indicated to me a difference in
thinking."</p>
<p>When Japanese and American values come together in the
same enterprise, there are many differences in thinking. Or
so discovered the people at Shin Caterpillar Mitsubishi
Ltd.'s facility near Kobe.</p>
<p>SCM, jointly owned by Caterpillar Inc. and Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries Ltd. and founded in 1963, is one of the
oldest U.S.-Japan joint ventures. Today it functions as the
world-wide design center for all of Caterpillar's hydraulic
excavators.</p>
<p>Some 30 American engineers from Peoria, Ill., moved to
Nishi Akashi to work side-by-side with Mitsubishi engineers.
The philosophical differences were apparent immediately. The
Japanese engineers couldn't understand why their American
counterparts wanted to knock off and go home each evening for
dinner with their families; the Americans couldn't understand
why the Japanese didn't want to. The top American engineer
had a private office back in the U.S. In Japan, he ended up
in an open room with seven other managers, his own desk
abutting that of a Japanese colleague.</p>
<p>But the difference that mattered most was how the two
groups viewed their role, claims Noriyuki Itakura, who came
from Mitsubishi. "The Japanese engineer tends to consider the
impact of his design on cost or manufacturability," Mr.
Itakura says. The Americans, he contends, simply "want to
know whether it can be done from an engineering point of
view."</p>
<p>This inclination to take in the bigger picture seems to
explain much of the Japanese success in technological
industries. But there are other critical traits as well: Once
Japan decides it wants to be strong in an industry, it
typically pursues its goal with determination and a view to
the longterm. Japan's approach to aerospace may be the
ultimate example.</p>
<p>America's lead in aerospace is one of its most important
competitive advantages. The industry generates high-wage jobs
and lucrative exports for the U.S. It also creates demand for
other, related high-tech industries such as opto-electronics
and propulsion.</p>
<p>Japan has struggled for 30 years to build an aerospace
industry, undaunted by its own failures and by the
superiority of overseas rivals. In the 1960s Mitsubishi Heavy
and other Japanese aircraft makers did build a 60-seat
commercial plane from scratch -- the YS11 -- but they were
able to sell only 160 of them.</p>
<p>In the U.S., where there isn't much patience when it comes
to losses, that might have been the end of the aerospace
effort. Japan simply regrouped. Representatives of industry
and the government, which had agreed on the initial
industrial policy of developing a purely Japanese airplane,
decided that Japan would instead follow a course of
"international collaboration" as a subcontractor of parts and
systems and as a licensee of foreign technology.</p>
<p>Today Mitsubishi Heavy and other Japanese companies
produce military planes under American licenses, make major
components of Boeing Co. jetliners and are eager to
collaborate with other foreign manufacturers. Mitsubishi
Heavy, for example, is widely expected to announce in the
next year or two that it will begin joint development of a
75-seat airliner with a European company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Japanese companies are winning contracts to
provide some of the highly advanced materials that will go
into foreign and domestic planes of the future. The
government is coordinating research on a new kind of engine
that could propel a supersonic plane from New York to Tokyo
in less than half the 14 hours the flight currently takes.
And, using technology that was created in the U.S. but
largely left unexploited, the Japanese are positioning
themselves to become the major launchers of commercial space
satellites by the end of this decade.</p>
<p>"Because they're investing in technology, they're going to
become an increasingly important player," says Lawrence
Clarkson, a senior vice president of Boeing's commercial
airplane group. "Today they're looked at by the world as
subcontractors. Fifteen years from now they'll be major
players however you define it." Mr. Clarkson says Boeing is
preparing for that day by investing in research and
development and by protecting its most sensitive technology
from competitors. If the industry fails to maintain its edge,
the consequences for the U.S. could be serious.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Iida, the Mitsubishi chairman, is inclined to
issue a chilling warning to his American competitors. Sitting
in his conference room high above Tokyo's financial district,
he says: "If you get out of the business of making airliners,
if you let what happened to you in other industries happen in
aircraft, your economy will really go downhill."</p>
