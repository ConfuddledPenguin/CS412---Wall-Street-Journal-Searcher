	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- A ruling by Canada's Federal Court has allowed
Molson Cos.' brewing unit, Molson Breweries, to register the
trademark Molson's Blue, despite the fact that the brand name
"Blue" is being used by rival brewer John Labatt Ltd.
   A spokesman for Labatt said the company doesn't plan to
change the name of the beer, the top-selling Canadian beer
and doesn't view the court's decision as a threat.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"For more than 25 years, Blue has been distinctive to
Labatt's," said Joe Clark, vice president of John Labatt's
brewing unit, Labatt Breweries of Canada. "It's nonsense for
our competitor to think they can prevent us from marketing
Blue, or sue us for trademark infringement."</p>
<p>Mr. Clark said the company hasn't decided whether it will
appeal the court decision. If Labatt doesn't appeal within 30
days, Molson will be able to register the trademark.</p>
<p>"We're obviously going to pursue this," said John Carroll,
president and chief executive of Molson Breweries. "We have a
long-standing right to the name, and we could probably force
Labatt to cease use of the Blue name."</p>
<p>Mr. Carroll didn't rule out suing Labatt, noting that each
percentage point of market share is worth about 10 million
Canadian dollars (US$8.5 million) to either brewer. Labatt's
Blue has a market share in excess of 20%.</p>
<p>"This is an extremely competitive business where the only
gains by one brewer are achieved at the other's expense," Mr.
Carroll said.</p>
<p>Canada's beer market consists of only two major players,
Molson and Labatt. In early 1988, Molson merged its brewering
assets with the Canadian assets of Elders IXL to form the
jointly owned Molson Breweries.</p>
<p>Molson filed an application to register the trademark in
1978 for use in marketing one of its brands of beer, Old
Stock Ale, which still says on the label "the original blue."
Labatt doesn't own a trademark for its Labatt's Blue name but
has applied for one.</p>
<p>The court rejected an appeal by John Labatt to overturn a
previous decision by the Canadian Trade Marks Registrar
allowing Molson to register the name.</p>
