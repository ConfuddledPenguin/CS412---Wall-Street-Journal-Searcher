	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Representatives of the unions seeking to buy
UAL Corp. will travel to Europe this week to talk with
airlines and suppliers about possibly investing in the labor
group's $4.38 billion buy-out proposal.
   Gerald Greenwald, former Chrysler Corp. vice chairman who
is heading the UAL buy-out effort, is expected to talk with
British Airways PLC, Rolls-Royce PLC, a British jet-engine
manufacturer, Airbus Industries, a European aircraft maker
and Guinness Peat Aviation, a leasing company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>British Airways was an investor in a previous, failed
labor-management bid for UAL. In the earlier bid, British
Airways agreed to provide $700 million in equity in return
for a 15% stake in UAL. The airline's management has refused
so far to participate in the new buy-out effort, but
apparently has agreed to listen to a pitch from Mr.
Greenwald, according to an individual familiar with the
situation.</p>
<p>As previously reported, the unions are also talking with
Boeing Co, the Seattle aircraft manufacturer; General
Electric Co., a Fairfield, Conn., maker of jet engines and
electrical products; and Pratt & Whitney, the jet engine
maker that is a unit of United Technologies Inc., Hartford,
Conn.</p>
<p>The unions are said to be seeking between $500 million and
$1 billion in financing from these companies that would be
subordinate to any bank financing.</p>
<p>In return for their investment, the suppliers would
receive either a note or nonvoting stock in UAL as well as
"preferred-supplier" status.</p>
<p>The labor group is seeking to reduce its dependence on
bank financing. Commercial lenders have been cool to the
transaction, which would result in the largest employee-owned
company in the nation.</p>
<p>Banks repeatedly have expressed concern about the absence
of an outside equity investor. Currently, the only equity in
the deal is the $2 billion of "sweat equity" the unions
agreed to provide over five years in the form of wage
concessions.</p>
