	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson issued an
executive order requiring department heads to bring the state
in line with last week's Supreme Court decision striking down
patronage practices.
   Five Illinois residents successfully challenged the
Republican governor over his party's control of more than
60,000 state jobs. Mr. Thompson, who called the high court's
ruling "naive," told reporters that the death of patronage
"turns politics on its head."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the spoils system may still have some life in
Illinois. While the governor's order ends a requirement of
political loyalty in the state and specifically covers
promotions, transfers and firings, Mr. Thompson said that
when faced with two job candidates with equal qualifications,
"We'll hire the Republican."</p>
<p>Mr. Thompson, the nation's longest-serving governor, will
leave office in January after 14 years.</p>
