	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court ruled that four
Western states have a right to take major oil companies to
court over accusations that the companies conspired to fix
wholesale gasoline prices in the 1970s and to create a
gasoline shortage in 1973.
   The unanimous opinion by three judges of the Ninth U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a 1986 court decision and
is the latest step in a case that has been in and out of the
courts for 15 years. The lower court decision had dismissed
the suit on grounds it didn't have sufficient chance of
success at trial.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The appellate court held Friday that the states presented
sufficient evidence of a conspiracy to send the case to a
jury trial in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The litigation, brought by California, Oregon, Washington
and Arizona, seeks damages that could total billions of
dollars, according to Michael Spiegel, a lawyer acting for
California.</p>
<p>The states are seeking the return of money they contend
they were overcharged for bulk purchases of gasoline between
1971 and 1975, when the suit was filed. There is a separate
action in state court that seeks to recover losses by
consumers from alleged overcharges for gasoline.</p>
<p>The defendants in the case are Atlantic Richfield Co;
Exxon Corp.; Mobil Corp.; Shell Oil Co., a unit of Royal
Dutch/Shell Group; Standard Oil Co., a unit of British
Petroleum Co.; Texaco Inc.; and Unocal Corp. A number of the
companies said Friday they were studying the opinion and
would decide later whether to appeal.</p>
<p>The appellate court said the states' evidence of a
potential conspiracy to affect prices included the use of
news releases announcing wholesale price increases, advance
posting of price changes at company offices and direct
contact with competitors. In the court's opinion, Judge
Dorothy Nelson wrote that "a jury could conclude that the oil
companies agreed, either implicitly or explicitly, to create
market conditions that would facilitate tacit or express
price coordination."</p>
<p>The defendants argued that the evidence was "too anecdotal
and fragmentary to support a broad inference of conspiracy of
the sort alleged."</p>
<p>Florida, Kansas and Connecticut originally were plaintiffs
in the suit but dropped out of it several years ago.</p>
<p>The litigation isn't directly related to an antitrust
lawsuit filed by California and by the city of Long Beach,
Calif. That action alleges that major oil firms conspired to
depress crude oil prices to reduce the taxes and royalties
they paid on crude oil from state-owned tidelands.</p>
