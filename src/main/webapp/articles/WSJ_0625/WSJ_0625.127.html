	<p class="article-leader">Shares of Software Toolworks Inc. fell $2.875 to $16 on
volume of 2.4 million shares in national over-the-counter
trading Friday, apparently reflecting investor fears that the
company's profit for the quarter that ends this week may be
disappointing.
   The concerns were spurred by a company filing Thursday
with the Securities and Exchange Commission indicating that
the company had net income of $5,000 on revenue of $2.7
million in the 30 days ended April 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the wake of the stock drop, the Sherman Oaks, Calif.,
software publisher said that the results "should not be
relied upon by investors as indicative of results for the
quarter." The filing was made to satisfy pooling-of-interest
requirements in the wake of Software Toolworks' March
acquisition of Mindscape Inc., a Northbrook, Ill., software
concern.</p>
<p>Software Toolworks has seen its stock price triple this
year after tripling in 1989 amid the prospect the company
will sell Nintendo-related products. For the year ended March
31, the company reported net of $2.6 million, or 14 cents a
share, on revenue of $68.7 million.</p>
