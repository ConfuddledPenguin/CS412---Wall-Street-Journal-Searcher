	<p class="article-leader">OAKLAND, Calif. -- A municipal court judge here gave
prosecutors and police two more weeks to complete an
investigation aimed at determining whether two members of the
militant Earth First] environmental group were responsible
for a bomb that exploded in their car on May 12.
   Results of that investigation were due last Friday, but
prosecutors said a final report has been delayed because the
Federal Bureau of Investigation is taking longer than
expected to complete a detailed analysis of the bombing. The
blast seriously injured Earth First] member Judi Bari; her
companion in the car, Darryl Cherney, suffered minor facial
cuts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Police took the two into custody after the blast on
suspicion that they were carrying the bomb for a yet unnamed
"ecoterrorist" purpose when it exploded accidentally. Both
Ms. Bari and Mr. Cherney have denied the charges and contend
they were the objects of a murder plot. Both are the chief
organizers of a so-called "Redwood Summer" protest now under
way in Northern California against timber companies'
harvesting of the state's redwood forests.</p>
<p>The demonstrations have thus far resulted in a few dozen
arrests of protesters and vocal clashes with timber and other
local interests, but there has been no reported violence.</p>
