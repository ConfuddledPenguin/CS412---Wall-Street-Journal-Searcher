	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- The Canadian Supreme Court ruled that Apple
Computer Inc.'s silicon chips are software eligible for
copyright protection.
   The court dismissed an appeal by a group of companies that
manufacture Apple II clones, computers that run the same
programs as Apple II. Mackintosh Computers Ltd., Repco
Electronics Co., House of Semi-Conductors Ltd. and Microcom
had copied Apple's Autostart ROM and Applesoft programs from
Apple's silicon chips. Apple holds a copyright for these
programs, which enable its computers to carry out such tasks
as word processing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The companies said they hadn't infringed Apple's copyright
because silicon chips aren't software eligible for copyright
protection. They argued that only the written version of the
programs is protected by copyright, not the chips on which
the programs are etched.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court, upholding a lower court ruling, said
the programs embedded in the chips are a reproduction of the
programs in computer language and are protected by copyright.</p>
<p>The court also upheld a lower court order directing the
companies to turn over any chips containing the copied
programs and an order for an accounting of profits made from
the sale of illegal chips.</p>
