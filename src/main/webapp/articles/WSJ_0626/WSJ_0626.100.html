	<p class="article-leader">BEIJING -- Chinese authorities allowed dissident Fang
Lizhi to leave his yearlong refuge in the U.S. Embassy and
travel overseas, removing a major irritant in U.S.-China
relations.
   The astrophysicist and outspoken human-rights advocate
left Beijing yesterday with his wife, Li Shuxian, aboard a
U.S. military plane. The couple, who took sanctuary in the
embassy after the brutal suppression of last June's
pro-democracy movement, will resettle in Britain, diplomats
said. He has accepted a post at Cambridge University.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>China's official Xinhua news agency said the pair were
given "lenient treatment" so they could seek medical care
abroad. Chinese and diplomatic sources said Mr. Fang has a
heart ailment.</p>
<p>The freeing of the couple, accused by Chinese authorities
of "instigating" last spring's demonstrations, may prompt
calls in Washington for improved U.S.-China ties. The Bush
administration has argued that allowing the pair to leave was
a prerequisite for better relations.</p>
<p>The White House immediately declared, "This humanitarian
action is a far-sighted, significant step that will improve
the atmosphere for progress in our bilateral relations."
Noting that Dr. Fang's second son, who plans to study in the
U.S., is still in China, State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said, "We have no reason to believe that
the son will have any difficulty obtaining permission to
study abroad."</p>
<p>The decision to allow the pair to leave doesn't markedly
alter the political situation in China. Hundreds of persons
arrested after the Tiananmen incident have been released from
prison, but hundreds more prisoners of conscience remain,
often without being charged. But the release of Mr. Fang is
sure to bolster President Bush's argument that his China
policy has achieved tangible benefits.</p>
<p>U.S.-China ties have been icy since June 4, 1989, when
Chinese troops killed hundreds of demonstrators in Beijing.
President Bush curtailed most high-level visits and suspended
military aid and some economic assistance. Washington also
blocked the resumption of normal lending to China from
multilateral agencies.</p>
<p>The Fang release may have been timed by Beijing to ward
off further sanctions. Congress is preparing to vote --
almost certainly favorably -- on Mr. Bush's recommendation to
retain beneficial trade terms for China. But some lawmakers
have threatened an attempt to make future trade ties with
China dependent on Beijing's human rights record.</p>
<p>State Department spokeswoman Tutwiler denied
"categorically" that the U.S. and China cut any deals trading
the Fang release for a lifting of U.S. sanctions against
China. Indeed, she said China would have to free other
prisoners and stop jamming the Voice of America if it wants
"a more normal relationship."</p>
<p>China for months has indicated a willingness to allow the
pair to leave, but only under certain conditions, including
an admission of guilt as well as a guarantee that they
wouldn't engage in anti-China activities overseas. The Xinhua
report hinted at a face-saving compromise: It said the two
dissidents admitted they had opposed the Communist Party's
monopoly on power and ideology, which amounts to a technical
violation of China's constitution.</p>
<p>Such a statement enables Beijing to maintain that the pair
had repented. At the same time, the pair apparently never
admitted any responsibility for last year's demonstrations,
the core allegation against them. Xinhua also indicated that
the couple agreed that "they will not engage in activities
directed against China after they leave the country."</p>
