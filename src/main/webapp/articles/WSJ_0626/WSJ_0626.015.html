	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- One of the advertising industry's best-known
spats, between Chairman David Ogilvy and Chief Executive
Martin Sorrell of Britain's WPP Group PLC, was publicly
patched up.
   At a meeting of WPP shareholders here -- the first such
session at which the two warring executives have shared the
podium -- all was amity. The two men, who had clashed last
year when Mr. Sorrell's WPP took over New York-based Ogilvy
Group, sat side by side in a hotel reception room, warmly
greeting WPP shareholders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When asked, Mr. Ogilvy said of his colleague: "I am very
fond of him -- but I don't want him to know." For his part,
Mr. Sorrell said their relations have "never been better."</p>
<p>The conflict, triggered by WPP's unwelcome bid for Ogilvy,
was noteworthy in the ad industry for its public namecalling.
The 79-year-old Mr. Ogilvy was quoted as calling Mr. Sorrell
an "odious little jerk." A truce was struck in May 1989 when
Ogilvy accepted a sweetened WPP offer of at least $793.8
million, and Mr. Ogilvy was named WPP chairman.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Mr. Ogilvy told shareholders that the
company's profits so far in 1990 "are in line with
expectations both inside and outside the company." In London,
financial analysts forecast WPP pretax profit of between #110
million ($190.4 million) and #115 million, up 46% to 53% from
#75 million in 1989.</p>
