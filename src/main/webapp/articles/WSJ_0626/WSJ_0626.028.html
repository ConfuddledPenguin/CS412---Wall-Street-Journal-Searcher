	<p class="article-leader">PRAISE FOR TOKYO</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A senior Bush administration official yesterday praised
the Japanese government for making progress on all the major
issues in talks to cut the bilateral-trade imbalance but
stressed that none of the matters had been resolved.</p>
<p>The official's remarks, delivered after the first day of
the final round of the so-called Structural Impediments
Initiative, contrasted with the harsh rhetoric coming out of
Washington in the weeks leading up to the meetings. Last
week, U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said, "Japan's
foot-dragging . . . must end."</p>
<p>The most contentious issue is whether Japan will commit to
big increases in public spending over the next decade, an act
the U.S. argues will shift more resources to Japan's domestic
market. A member of the U.S. delegation said the two sides
were still "apart" on the issue but "I would not say we are
far apart."</p>
<p>A Japanese government official said his delegation didn't
increase its proposal from the 415 trillion yen ($2.679
trillion) level given to the U.S. last week. The U.S. has
asked Japan to spend 500 trillion yen over the next 10 years
on public works.</p>
<p>GLOBAL JET DEMAND</p>
<p>Global demand for commercial jets will total about 12,220
planes for the period from 1990 through 2008, according to a
new forecast published by Airbus Industrie. The European
consortium said that about 5,500 aircraft of the estimated
total would be needed to replace aging jets now in service.
The rest would be needed to satisfy traffic growth estimated
at an annual average of 5.5% for the period. Airbus estimated
firm orders had already been placed for some 3,200 jets by
the start of 1990.</p>
<p>AMERICAN EXPRESS IN LONDON</p>
<p>American Express Co. will lease space for a European
headquarters from Olympia & York Developments Ltd. in the
Canary Wharf office complex in East London. The U.S. travel
and financial-services concern said it will take 300,000
square feet of 20 Cabot Square, a 10-story building, in
spring 1992. The new building will be the first European
headquarters for American Express International, bringing
about 1,500 employees under one roof, American Express said.
Olympia & York said it now has leasing commitments for more
than half the space under construction at Canary Wharf.</p>
<p>BRAZILIAN KIDNAPPINGS</p>
<p>The Brazilian government has proposed drastic measures to
put an end to a wave of kidnappings. Kidnappers have seized
25 people in Rio de Janeiro alone this year. "The government
must take vigorous and drastic measures to cut off this evil
at the root," said President Fernando Collor de Mello in a
memorandum to Justice Minister Bernardo Cabral. Measures
proposed to the legislature include freezing the assets of
victims to stop them from paying ransom and increasing the
maximum prison sentence for kidnappers to 30 years from
eight.</p>
<p>AIRPORT SECURITY</p>
<p>Japan plans to tighten luggage security checks at its six
international airports beginning in October, a Transport
Ministry spokesman said. The ministry is negotiating to split
costs with a number of airlines that don't X-ray luggage on
flights to and from Japan, the spokesman said. Elsewhere, the
Geneva-based International Air Travel Association said it
opposed a West German plan to levy a $2 security charge on
embarking airline passengers. "We firmly believe that the
cost of maintaining security at airports . . . should be
borne by the state in question," said an IATA official.</p>
<p>JOINT VENTURES IN EASTERN EUROPE</p>
<p>A study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development shows that there are more than 5,400 joint
ventures with foreign companies in Eastern Europe. But a
large number of these, especially in the Soviet Union, are
"just on paper and inactive"; and, in general, the joint
ventures are noticeably absent from the service sector, an
OECD official said. He added that "while many joint projects
have had a useful demonstration effect, some countries have
to rebuild their legal and economic infrastructure" before
many ventures can bear fruit.</p>
<p>KEEPING JAPAN'S WORKERS HAPPY</p>
<p>Many Japanese companies have been cutting working hours in
an attempt to hold on to employees in a tightening labor
market, the Labor Ministry said.</p>
<p>Ministry officials said a quarterly survey conducted in
May showed that 60% of manufacturers have reduced work hours,
while 64% of wholesalers and retailers took the same step.
The survey, which involved 2,172 companies, also found that
44% of the manufacturers have raised wages and 30% have
improved company welfare facilities to hold workers.</p>
<p>The smaller the companies, the more trouble they have
trying to find workers or keeping them, the officials said.</p>
<p>According to the survey, 47% of the companies with more
than 1,000 people on the payroll have reduced work hours,
while 71% of those with between 100 and 299 people reported
the same action.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Norway and Hungary are abolishing visa requirements for
one another's citizens as of July 15. . . . Melina Mercouri,
Greece's film actress turned socialist politician, will seek
to become mayor of Athens in municipal elections in October.</p>
