	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that states may
require clear proof that a patient in a vegetative state
wishes to die before allowing food and water tubes to be
disconnected.
   By a 5-4 vote, the high court ruled that, in the absence
of strong evidence of the intent of a patient who is
incompetent, states aren't required to honor the wishes of a
patient's family to stop artificial feeding and water and to
allow the patient to die.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The decision, written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
is the Supreme Court's first foray into the legally and
ethically complex and highly emotional issue of the right to
die. The ruling leaves the states substantial leeway to adopt
their own approaches, outlining some significant parameters
for legislatures to follow.</p>
<p>Most significantly, by emphasizing the need for clear
evidence of a patient's wishes, the ruling is likely to
encourage greater use of so-called living wills that allow
individuals to spell out in writing in advance their wishes
about being kept alive through tube feeding or other means.</p>
<p>Living-will laws vary widely, however, in the roughly 40
states that have passed them. While most allow the
termination of artificial-breathing equipment and other
life-support efforts, many don't specifically allow a person
to authorize in advance the removal of feeding and water
tubes. So, there is likely to be new pressure on state
legislatures to modify some living-will laws or to adopt new
ones.</p>
<p>Appeals courts or supreme courts in at least nine states
have found either a state or federal constitutional right to
privacy that limits a state's ability to refuse to stop
artificial feeding of patients in vegetative states. The
ruling yesterday may affect those decisions if state
officials try to impose new limits.</p>
<p>"The ruling means that if you write down your wishes in
advance about tubefeeding, they will have to be taken
seriously," said Fenella Rouse, a lawyer with the Society for
the Right to Die.</p>
<p>Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe agreed that
the ruling "will encourage more precise expressions" of an
individual's wishes, but warned that "living wills are not
foolproof" as they may be challenged as insufficient evidence
of one's intent.</p>
<p>The emphasis on evidence of one's wishes was disturbing to
the American Medical Association. Nancy Dickey, an AMA
trustee, said, "Written decisions made ahead of time are not
the best way to make choices about health care which is
changing all the time." The ruling, she said, "is a voice
against the right of the doctor and patient to make decisions
at the bedside."</p>
<p>The court ruling left unresolved a major question related
to the use of living wills. The court's majority said states
don't have to honor the wishes of a patient's family; but the
justices didn't decide what approach states should take when
a patient has designated a surrogate to make health-care
decisions, either through a living will or through a
power-of-attorney appointment. In a separate opinion, Justice
Sandra O'Connor, who joined the majority, said states may be
constitutionally required to recognize the authority of
surrogate decisionmakers.</p>
<p>The justices recognized for the first time that the
Constitution protects the decision of a person who is
competent to make such judgments to refuse artificial feeding
and water. "That will help fortify the rights of patients,"
said Dr. Dickey.</p>
<p>The high court ruling came in the case of Nancy Cruzan, 32
years old, who has been unconscious since January 1983, when
her brain was severely damaged by a lack of oxygen after a
car accident in southwestern Missouri. Doctors say she won't
recover but that she could live for 30 years receiving food
and water through a tube. Her condition is described as a
"persistent vegetative state" -- more alert than a coma, but
still unconscious. Her parents want to stop providing food
and water to her, saying that she expressed a desire in the
past not to live after a serious injury if she couldn't
function normally.</p>
<p>The Missouri Supreme Court refused to cut off her food and
water, finding her intent unclear. The Supreme Court upheld
that decision, saying a state may require a high standard of
proof of a patient's wishes.</p>
<p>Justice William Brennan dissented, joined by Justices
Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun, saying she has a
fundamental right "to choose to die with dignity." Justice
John Stevens also dissented. (Cruzan vs. Director, Missouri

<p>Comsat Appeal</p>
<p>The high court refused to hear Communications Satellite
Corp.'s appeal of a Federal Communications Commission order
requiring the company to refund $38.8 million to
long-distance telephone companies.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court in the District of Columbia
affirmed the FCC's order in a brief decision in November.</p>
<p>The FCC said that between Aug. 1, 1984, and Dec. 31, 1986,
Comsat, which provides phone links, earned more than its
authorized 12.48% return on investment. Comsat challenged the
FCC's authority to order refunds and other retroactive
relief.</p>
<p>In its December 1987 order, the FCC said that Comsat must
deposit the refund in an escrow account, while the FCC
decided how to disburse the money. Nearly all of it would go
to American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and other long-distance
carriers, the FCC said, and the agency would order the
carriers to refund it to ratepayers. (Communications
