	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Elcor Corp., citing the adverse effects of
unusually heavy rains in the Southwest, said it expects to
report a loss of about $700,000 for the fourth quarter,
ending Saturday.
   The maker of roofing and industrial products, which
reported a $6 million loss in the year-ago fourth quarter,
said the rains temporarily reduced roofing installations in
the area, which resulted in lower-than-expected shipments of
the company's laminated glass fiber asphalt shingles.</p>
