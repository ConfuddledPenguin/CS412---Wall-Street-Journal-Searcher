	<p class="article-leader">We hope someone in the Bush White House is supposed to
keep an eye on budget politics beyond the Beltway. While Mr.
Bush's no-new-taxes pledge still stands as a robust political
strategy, some big-state electorates -- California, New York,
New Jersey -- are encountering the kinds of solutions that
politicians devise to address the universal phenomenon of a
bloated public sector: Increase the tax burden. If the White
House miscalculates the terms of a budget deal with Congress,
it may antagonize voters already steamed up at the economic
policies of their own states.
   In California, a July 1 budget deadline is causing a
meltdown over deficits. The Republican Governor is a lame
duck, and a Democratic legislature must lead in choosing
between taxes and spending.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A conference committee in Sacramento has begun searching
for a way to make the revenue-growth line as steep as the
expenditure track, which right now has been spotted a $2.9
billion lead for next fiscal year. The Democratic leadership
insists that categories such as welfare have to keep rolling
along at double-digit yearly rates of increase.</p>
<p>Two leading Democrats in the legislature have boldly
spelled out plans for a $2.3 billion tax hike. Half the
revenues would come from increasing the top personal income
tax rate back to 11%, where it was before the state conformed
to federal tax revision and eliminated many deductions in
return for a 9.3% ceiling on rates. This higher bracket would
cover income from all sources that exceeds $100,000 for an
individual, $200,000 for a joint return.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in New Jersey, Democratic Governor Jim Florio
has steamrollered his own tax increase through the
legislature. Under newspaper headlines this past weekend
proclaiming "State's biggest tax hike," stories described a
$2.8 billion tax package. Taxes will go up on individuals
with incomes above $35,000 and couples above $70,000. The
highest tax bracket will be doubled to 7%. A higher sales tax
of 7% will now extend to a wide range of previously untaxed
items and services. (Part of the proposal includes plans to
offer property-tax relief to some people.)</p>
<p>During the Reagan years, one of the rationales for cutting
taxes and tax rates was to create economic incentives for
individuals to work harder or more innovatively; in return,
government wouldn't claim such a large share of the new,
additional dollars. It is intriguing to compare this
philosophy with what is driving these state efforts.</p>
<p>In California, Johan Klehs, who heads the Assembly's tax
committee and is one of the sponsors of the new tax plan,
happens to have supported the 1987 rate reductions in
California. He and other Democrats liked the primary effect
of those changes: to cut the tax burden for low-income
residents. Moreover, they were projected to increase the
taxes paid by the rich. And indeed, they apparently did just
that. Mr. Klehs admits, "Actually, personal income tax
revenues have done quite well."</p>
<p>Now, having defoliated many of the tax havens, Mr. Klehs &
Co. want to expose the high-income-earners to the old steeper
rate. History suggests they won't get as much revenue as they
think from this ploy, as creative tax attorneys find new
loopholes. But this kind of bait-and-switch politics may also
poison future attempts to broaden tax bases and reduce rates,
a trend that economists across the political spectrum have
encouraged because it reduces the distortions of the tax
code. California's tax boosters also have in mind a rise in
business taxes to 9.6%, where the rate was before the 1987
changes. The state's Democrats point to unpopular spending
cuts as the alternative.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, much of the money collected annually from
the higher income taxes will be redistributed through a
complex formula among city school systems that the Governor
believes operate at a financial disadvantage to suburban
schools. So far the new taxes and school-spending scheme have
produced an outpouring of bitterness and resentment among
voters who believe they are the plan's losers. In any event,
the Florio philosophy, rooted in sharp class distinctions,
marks a break with the incentive-based economic policies of
the recent past.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, of course, both New York City and New York
State are well along the path to raising taxes significantly
to pay for their public-sector commitments. Coincidentally,
the New York Times last week carried an article about young
Long Island couples who are increasingly thinking of moving
to Florida, partly to escape their high taxes.</p>
<p>So far, a string of presidential vetoes by Mr. Bush
suggests he is sensitive to the dangers of loading the
economy at the federal level with more costs. However, the
revenue side of the Washington fiscal equation remains open
for negotiation. If Washington now adds to a tax burden
already building again in economic bellwether states such as
New York, New Jersey and California, voters in elections from
now through 1992 may go looking for politicians and parties
to tag with the blame.</p>
