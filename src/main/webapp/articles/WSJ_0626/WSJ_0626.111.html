	<p class="article-leader">Carter Holt Harvey Ltd., a New Zealand timber and building
materials concern, said it is buying a 52.7% stake in Elders
Resources NZFP Ltd. from Elders IXL Ltd. of Australia for
822.3 million New Zealand dollars (US$482.3 million), part of
a major restructuring of Elders IXL announced in March.
   The sale is conditioned on Elders Resources' selling all
except its forestry-based assets, which requires
authorization by Elders Resources directors and shareholders,
and approval by regulators in New Zealand and Australia,
where Elders Resources has oil, gas and coal interests.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Carter Holt said the base price values the 411,159,696
shares it is buying at NZ$2 each. The final price is
adjustable to between NZ$700 million and NZ$900 million,
depending on the nonforestry assets' sale price. Once the
stake is acquired, a Cart Holt-Elders Resources merger
proposal will be put to holders of both companies.</p>
<p>Elders IXL's restructuring includes plans to sell
resources and financial-services interests and spin off
agribusiness operations to concentrate on its core brewing
business.</p>
