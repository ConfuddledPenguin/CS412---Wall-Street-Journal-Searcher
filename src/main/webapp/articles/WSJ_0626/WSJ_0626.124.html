	<p class="article-leader">Microsoft Corp. says sales of its new software product
Windows 3.0 have so far exceeded its most agressive
predictions.
   The Redmond, Wash,-based software company didn't disclose
its internal forecasts or say how much sales outstripped
expectations. The new software tool was introduced with
fanfare just five weeks ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, David Readerman, an analyst with Shearson Lehman
Bros. said he expects Microsoft to sell 500,000 units of
Windows 3.0 between its May 22 introduction date and June 30.</p>
<p>In response to the crush of demand, Microsoft said it is
establishing a 24-hour hotline providing user support for the
new product. The company said it also plans to add 60
additional people to its support staff to handle consumer
needs.</p>
