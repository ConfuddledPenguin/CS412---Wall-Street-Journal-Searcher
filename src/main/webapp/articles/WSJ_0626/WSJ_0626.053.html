   Shortly after studying the merits of recycling in class
this spring, sixth-graders at Bel Air Elementary School in
New Brighton, Minn., demanded that the school cafeteria
switch from using plastic-foam lunch trays to washable ones.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When the school board balked, the children staged a
cafeteria sit-in -- where a number of students were suspended
for refusing to return to class. Undeterred, the
sixth-graders appeared at the next school board meeting with
a presentation that persuaded the board to implement the plan
districtwide when school begins again in the fall, at a cost
of $145,000 for new dishwashers.</p>
<p>It's the greening of America, 1990s style. A growing
number of schools, prompted in part by the 20th anniversary
of Earth Day in April, began teaching children to become
environmentally conscious -- as early as the first grade, in
some cases. "Things are swinging back from the attitude, `We
don't care' to `We have to care,'" says Pattye Hitchins, an
Earth science teacher at Glens Falls (N.Y.) High School.</p>
<p>As the New Brighton school officials learned, it could
result in the next generation of consumers being much more
environmentally conscious than today's -- and force marketers
to modify their products accordingly.</p>
<p>"Every week, it seems my daughter comes home with new
information," says Richard Seltzer, a lawyer in Montclair,
N.J., of his eight-year-old daughter, Joanna, who just
finished second grade. "`Daddy, I don't want you to put on
the air conditioner this year because it hurts the ozone
layer. . . . I don't want us to cut down trees because it
hurts the ozone layer.' She already knows about things I
never knew about until a few years ago, and I'm 40 years
old."</p>
<p>Adds Kim Seltzer, an amateur cellist and Joanna's mother:
"She doesn't want us to use plastic bags for garbage. So we
use brown paper bags. When I made her lunch, I used to slice
an apple and put it in a plastic bag. Now we use aluminum
foil."</p>
<p>No figures are available, but thousands of schools across
the country have worked environmentalism into the classroom,
usually in science courses but also in social studies,
English and other subjects.</p>
<p>Florida, Maryland and Iowa are among states interested in
a five-year-old law in Wisconsin that requires public
schools, from kindergarten to 12th grade, to integrate
ecology into the curriculum. Wisconsin just established a
board that will distribute $200,000 annually to develop
environmental-education projects. On a national level,
Congress is considering a bill that would fashion and make
available an environmental-studies program for schools around
the country.</p>
<p>The market for environmental-education materials is
growing, educators say.</p>
<p>Delta Education Inc., a maker of science kits for
elementary school class experiments, began selling a kit
concerning environmental pollution and erosion 16 months ago.
The company says schools ordered 110 kits in the past few
months -- compared with just 65 in 1989. "For a topic that
we've never heard of before {for kits}, we're happy with the
sales," says Tom Richardson, the company's president.</p>
<p>Some schools, of course, have taught children about the
environment for years. Since 1976, for example, third-graders
in the Jefferson County Public School System, in Lakewood,
Colo., have learned about the environment as part of their
45-minute daily science class.</p>
<p>Still, contend educators, in the past three years the
subject has been approached much more seriously. "In the
mid-'70s, we did a lot of expedition stuff. We got kids
outdoors on trips. {Now} you don't see as much rafting or
other experimental education," says Harold Pratt, executive
director for science and technology curricula for Jefferson
County schools.</p>
<p>In Wisconsin, considered a leader in environmental studies
because of its 1985 law, suggested topics include everything
from farmland preservation in social studies to endangered
species in science to noise pollution in physics. Each school
district is left to develop its own curricula. For
kindergarteners, that might mean a walk through the snow
looking for deer tracks; for eighth-graders, it might mean
writing to the Legislature to promote a recycling law as an
English assignment.</p>
<p>At elementary schools in Dutchess County, N.Y., fifth- and
sixth-graders learn about ecology for one class period a day
for 10 weeks. Students study the ecology of their school
grounds, from types of leaves and insects present to habitats
of organisms in the soil to nonorganic factors influencing
the playgrounds. At Belmont (Mass.) Day School,
second-graders study whales and other endangered species.
Students learn about the whaling industry, why whales are now
endangered and why it's important to try to protect them.</p>
<p>And at Glens Falls High School, a full-year course in
environmental studies will be offered next year as an
alternative to chemistry for some students. Ms. Hitchins, the
Earth science teacher there, describes her course's
three-week study of environmental concerns as "the most
important three weeks of the year." For part of their grade,
students are asked to "go and change the world" by
volunteering for an environmental project.</p>
<p>But some educators argue that too much time spent studying
how to recycle aluminum cans or save electricity takes away
from critical subjects like English and history. "Some people
say, `This won't get my kids in Harvard,'" concedes Rustum
Roy, director of the Science Technology and Society program
at Pennsylvania State University and an advocate of
environmental education for grade schoolers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, some parents argue that the approach taken by
many schools is too simplistic. Younger students aren't shown
the drawbacks of strict environmental laws, such as the
effect on products' costs or resulting job losses, and are
led to become self-righteous advocates of causes they don't
fully understand, one parent says. "I've talked to a lot of
other parents {who agree that some children are} being such
little prigs about smoking . . . and using air conditioners,"
says Liza Lunt, a lawyer in Arlington, Mass.</p>
<p>Her eight-year-old daughter, Kate Doniger, and a friend
have decided to operate a lemonade stand this summer and to
send their earnings to Greenpeace, an environmental
organization. "I get concerned that children think that by
doing all these nice things right, they will be making a big
impact, when in fact corporate polluters are doing most of
the damage," says Ms. Lunt. She says children should be
taught that "radical changes are going to have to be made if
we are really going to have an impact on saving the
environment."</p>
<p>Other parents contend that since their children's
generation will bear the brunt of most of the Earth's current
problems, it's never too early to begin preparing them for
it. With that in mind, preschoolers in Troy, Ohio, are
learning about recycling and the interdependence of living
things at the Brukner Nature Center, a nonprofit organization
that promotes environmental awareness.</p>
