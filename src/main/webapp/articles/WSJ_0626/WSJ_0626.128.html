	<p class="article-leader">Material Sciences Corp. said it hired William Blair & Co.,
a Chicago-based investment banking firm, to explore the
possible sale of the company.
   The move follows an April announcement by the Elk Grove
Village, Ill., maker of coatings and laminates that its board
was reviewing "various strategic and financial alternatives"
for the company. At the time, the company said it was "very
concerned" about what it considered the market's
under-valuation of the company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the American Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Material
Sciences closed at $13.75, up $3.375. The company has 4.9
million shares outstanding.</p>
