	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. won a skirmish
in its court battle concerning bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. that
were issued before the food and tobacco company's late-1988
leveraged buy-out.
   Met Life, which owns about $240 million of RJR's old
bonds, filed suit in 1988 arguing that the buy-out hurt the
value of the old bonds and broke pledges made to bondholders.
Among the remedies sought by Met Life was early repayment of
the bonds, some of which don't come due until 2016.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A federal appeals court overturned a lower-court ruling to
which Met Life had objected. Met Life wants to start a 60-day
clock running in which RJR must cure the alleged default on
its bonds or face a series of steps that bondholders can
take. RJR had asked a lower court to, in effect, freeze the
clock until its claim can be heard that there hasn't been any
default.</p>
<p>The lower court had granted RJR an open-ended injunction.
But yesterday's appeals court ruling disallowed that
injunction and directed the lower court to resume
proceedings.</p>
<p>A decisive verdict in the Met Life suit still is a long
way off. Both sides are expected to file briefs with the
federal district court this summer. The district judge,
Michael B. Mukasey, isn't expected to hear the case until
October and isn't expected to rule until early 1991. Whatever
his verdict, it's likely to be appealed, and that could take
another 18 months or longer.</p>
