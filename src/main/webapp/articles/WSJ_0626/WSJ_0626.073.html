	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The yen weakened as Asian investors,
discouraged by yet another decline in the Tokyo stock market,
added to their stockpiles of currencies buttressed by high
interest rates.
   The retreat of the Japanese unit pushed the dollar higher
against most other major currencies as well. Comments by U.S.
Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger near the end of
the trading session caused the dollar to lose some of its
earlier gains, traders said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ms. Seger told the U.S. League of Savings Institutions in
Washington that she favors "some easing" of U.S. monetary
policy in part to bring down the price of the dollar.</p>
<p>Yesterday's clear winner, however, was the Canadian
dollar. The first world trading session since the collapse of
the Meech Lake constitutional accord should have been the
currency's worst hours. Instead, the much-maligned Canadian
currency bounced back from some early selling and actually
ended higher against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Based on yesterday's performance of the Canadian dollar,
commented Valerie Walker, corporate foreign exchange manager
for Harris Trust & Savings Bank in New York, the government
of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney deserves "kudos" for its
efforts to reassure financial markets on the crisis.</p>
<p>The yen, meanwhile, is being hurt by a diverse, seemingly
unconnected, set of circumstances.</p>
<p>Weakness on the Tokyo stock exchange has helped sour
investors on the yen. The Nikkei stock average fell 570.38
points Monday, or 1.74%, following a 392.70-point drop
Friday. But traders noted that the dollar rose past the
psychologically important 155-yen level during Australian
trading, before Japanese stock trading began in earnest.</p>
<p>If the Nikkei is the excuse to sell the yen, low Japanese
interest rates are the prod. The Japanese currency has been
the prime victim of a market whose recent directionlessness
has led Asian investors to seek their profits from
interest-rate differentials rather than currency
appreciation.</p>
<p>"Investors are seeing not too much happening with the
dollar, so they are going for the yield," said Dan Brooks,
chief dealer for Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York. And as for
who is scuttling the yen, Mr. Brooks said, "I think it's
mostly the Japanese doing it to themselves."</p>
<p>Late in the New York trading day, the dollar was quoted at
1.6770 marks, up from 1.6745 marks late Friday in New York.
The U.S. currency was also changing hands at 155.35 yen, up
from 154.85 yen in New York late Friday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the dollar was quoted
at 155.25 yen; it closed Monday in Tokyo at 155.62 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.6820
marks, up from Monday's Tokyo close of 1.6790 marks.</p>
<p>Albert Soria, foreign exchange manager for Kansallis Osake
Pankki in New York, noted that the U.S. dollar has been
reaping gains from the troubles in Canada that might
otherwise have been expected to go to the yen. Japanese
investors, who had been heavily involved in Canada, have
withdrawn some of their assets, he said.</p>
<p>But rather than bringing money home in the form of
repurchased yen, Mr. Soria said, the investors are seeking
out both interest rates higher than Japan's and a safe haven.
The U.S. fits the bill, according to dealers.</p>
<p>Ms. Walker of Harris Trust said the market will now watch
whether yesterday has established a new trading range for
dollar-yen. "The question is: Are we about to form a new
basis of support for the dollar at 155 yen or is this going
to be a one-day aberration."</p>
<p>On the one hand, Ms. Walker said, the New York market
didn't try to take the dollar any higher against the yen than
it traded in Tokyo and never tested buying interest at 156.10
yen, the next important point on technicians' charts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ms. Walker said, when dealers tried to
swing the dollar back below 155 yen, the support level of
155.15 yen held fast.</p>
<p>The yen was also buffeted by non-dollar cross trading,
especially against the mark and Swiss franc. The West German
currency rose as high as 92.95 yen before profittakers moved
in, traders said.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $353.80 an ounce, up $3.40. This was the
highest close in almost two weeks. Estimated volume was a
light 1.6 million ounces.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $352.75 an ounce.</p>
