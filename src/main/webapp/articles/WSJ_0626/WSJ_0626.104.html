	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors shunned the bond market yesterday,
forcing dealers to knock down prices in an attempt to attract
buyers.
   The biggest losses occurred on the longer end of the yield
curve. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly one
point , or $10 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
issue's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its
price, jumped to 8.56%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Short-term securities ended with losses between 1/4 and
1/2 point.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said institutional investors were
noticeably absent from the market yesterday, due in part to
concern about the market's ability to absorb a huge amount of
new notes and bonds to be sold over the next several weeks.</p>
<p>The Treasury sold $17.2 billion of short-term Treasury
bills yesterday and is scheduled to auction $11.25 billion of
two-year notes today and $8.25 billion of four-year notes
tomorrow.</p>
<p>"The auctions are coming up and there's not much buying,"
said Charles Lieberman, managing director of financial
markets research at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp.
"The net result is prices go lower."</p>
<p>William Sullivan, money-market economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said that investors are staying away from the
market for fear that prices will fall further in the weeks
ahead as the Treasury saturates the market with supply.</p>
<p>That could be bad news not only for investors, but also
for dealers. Traders' inventories already are bloated and the
additional inventory is likely to keep prices lower.</p>
<p>Mr. Sullivan of Dean Witter said that evidence that
dealers already hold ample supply of securities is reflected
in the firmness of the overnight repurchase-agreement rate
compared with the federal funds rate. In a repurchase
agreement, a securities firm borrows to finance its
inventory, using the securities as collateral. The "repo"
rate is generally lower than rates on other collaterized
loans made by New York banks. The federal funds rates is the
rate banks charge each other on overnight loans.</p>
<p>The repo rate has been close to the federal funds rate for
about two weeks, reflecting an abundance of collateral to be
financed. An overnight repurchase-agreement rate
substantially below the federal funds rate reflects a
scarcity of collateral.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon the overnight rate stood at about
8.20%, compared with a federal funds rate that fluctuated
between 8.1875% and 8.3125%.</p>
<p>Corporate Issues</p>
<p>The junk bonds of Charter Medical Corp. fell sharply on
reports that federal regulators are investigating the company
for possible Medicare and Medicaid-related fraud.</p>
<p>As reported, officials from the Department of Health and
Human Services have been questioning former Charter employees
involved in the Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement process
for several months.</p>
<p>Bids for the hospital and psychiatric-care company's
high-yield debt dried up yesterday. Charter Medical's 14.25%
subordinated debentures, due in 2002, were offered at 21,
down three points.</p>
<p>The Macon, Ga.-based firm's 14% senior subordinated
debentures, which were trading at 101 1/2 at the beginning of
the year, were offered at 38, down six points from Friday's
closing level.</p>
<p>In recent months, Charter Medical's credit has suffered
from a series of confidence blows. The firm posted a $67
million loss during the second quarter after a pretax charge
of $35 million for questionable accounting practices.</p>
<p>In the overall junk-bond market, prices slipped modestly
in extremely thin trading.</p>
<p>Some traders said a decline in equity prices helped
depress junk bond prices which ended between 1/4 to 1/2 point
lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 12 points
yesterday after falling nearly 79 points last week.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of
101 29/32, down nearly one point from 102 27/32 on Friday.</p>
<p>The current two-year notes were quoted late at 100 1/32 to
yield 8.44%, compared with 100 7/32 to yield 8.35% on Friday.
In when-issued trading, the new two-year notes to be
auctioned today were quoted at a yield of 8.43%, up 0.09
percentage point from late Friday. The when-issued four-year
notes were quoted at 8.54%, up 0.10 percentage point from
Friday.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were higher yesterday at the government's
regular weekly Treasury bill auction. The average discount
rate on three-month bills was 7.78% and was 7.67% on
six-month bills. Those rates were up from last week's
auction, when they were 7.74% and 7.64%, respectively.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>

<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Declines in Treasury bond prices pulled down mortgage
securities as much as 3/8 point.</p>
<p>Lesser losses on mortgage securities translated to a slim
narrowing in yield spreads, but market participants stress
that the spread tightening has done little to break the
recent trend of marginal spread changes.</p>
<p>Spread volatility has been virtually nonexistent in recent
weeks. Since the start of the month, the late-day spread
between Government National Mortgage Association 9.5%
securities and 10-year Treasury notes has been locked in a
maximum range of 0.05 percentage point. The same is true for
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities and Federal
National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities.</p>
<p>Late yesterday, the spread for Ginnie Mae 9.5% securities
stood at 1.27 percentage points, 0.02 percentage point
narrower than late Friday, with Ginnie Mae 9.5% securities
yielding 9.85% and 10-year Treasury notes yielding 8.58%.</p>
<p>Among other actively traded secondary mortgage issues,
Freddie Mac 9.5% securities were 11/32 lower at 97 31/32 and
Fannie Mae 9.5% issues were off 11/32 at 98 15/32.</p>
<p>Ginnie Mae 9.5% securities for July delivery were off 3/8
at 98 18/32.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Municipal bonds ended narrowly mixed, with most issues
steady to 1/8 point lower in ambivalent dealings.</p>
<p>Issues are expected to show only minor price fluctuations
as participants await the outcome of this week's Treasury
auctions.</p>
<p>In secondary activity, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securities of 2020 closed up 1/8 at 97 7/8 to yield
7.37.</p>
<p>Today a Morgan Stanley & Co. group is expected to price
$780 million New York State Dormitory Authority consolidated
second resolution revenue bonds.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>The Canadian bond market was surprisingly subdued
yesterday following the weekend demise of the Meech Lake
constitutional accord.</p>
<p>In recent months, Canadian bond prices have gyrated wildly
due to uncertainty about how such an accord would affect the
Canadian economy. The Meech Lake accord was designed to meet
Quebec's demand that it be considered a "distinct society"
and to defuse independence forces within the province. But
the accord died after two provinces failed to ratify it by a
Saturday deadline.</p>
<p>Although some investors were bracing for a potential
sell-off, the reaction was muted. "The world did not come to
an end," said Jim Beqaj, director of global fixed-income at
Wood Gundy Ltd., Toronto. "It was actually quite
anticlimactic," he said.</p>
<p>The news prompted some selling of Canadian government
bonds during overnight trading in Japan. But the bonds
recovered somewhat during Canadian trading and ended between
1/8 and 1/4 point lower.</p>
<p>Wood Gundy's Mr. Beqaj said the overnight dip in prices
sparked some bargain hunting during North American trading as
investors began to focus again on the economic fundamentals,
which look encouraging for Canadian bonds.</p>
<p>Michael Gregory, an economist at Royal Bank of Canada,
agrees. He said that Canadian bonds are attractive because of
the relatively high yields when compared to U.S. government
bonds. Mr. Gregory expects the Bank of Canada to loosen
interest rates near the end of the summer in response to
slowing economic growth and an easing of inflationary
pressures.</p>
