	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The National Football League Players
Association filed a lawsuit accusing the NFL of illegally
interfering with the union's licensing business.
   In a suit filed in federal court in Manhattan, the union
accused the NFL of intimidating potential licensees to stop
doing business with the players' association. It also accused
the league of enticing individual players into breaking their
licensing agreements with the association.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The suit claims that the NFL is trying to cripple the
union financially by hurting its licensing business, the
union's main source of revenue. Last year, licensing brought
in $6.1 million in revenue for the players' association, the
suit said.</p>
<p>The suit seeks at least $40 million in damages for the
alleged antitrust violations.</p>
<p>The suit accused the NFL of threatening the union's
licensees by telling them they wouldn't be allowed to use the
league's own trademarks unless they broke their licensing
agreements with the players' association. It said the NFL
offered to protect the licensees from any legal actions the
union might take as a result of abandoned agreements.</p>
<p>The suit also charged that the league enticed several
individual players into breaking their agreements with the
association by paying the players $8,500 to $100,000 each to
assign licensing rights to NFL's own licensing arm.</p>
<p>NFL officials couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
