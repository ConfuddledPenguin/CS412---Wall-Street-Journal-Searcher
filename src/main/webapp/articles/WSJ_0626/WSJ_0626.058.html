	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Japan's Daiwa Securities Co. named Koji
Yoneyama as chairman of its U.S. subsidiary, and selected
Nobuo Yonetani to succeed Mr. Yoneyama as president of the
unit.
   Both men are considered internationalists. In addition,
Mr. Yonetani has a strong background in corporate finance, an
area that Daiwa plans to emphasize in the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Daiwa also has established a Delaware-registered holding
company for its U.S. operations, something that could allow
the Japanese securities firm to reduce the capital needed to
support mainline broker-dealer operations.</p>
<p>The chairman's post has been vacant since January, when
Takuro Isoda returned to Tokyo to run a venture capital
company controlled by Daiwa. At the time, Mr. Yoneyama
assumed the chief executive's title and responsibilities,
which he is retaining. He came to the U.S. three years ago as
president and chief operating officer of the U.S. subsidiary.</p>
<p>Daiwa executives said that Mr. Yoneyama has been
considered a rising star in the company ever since the early
part of the 1980s when he was appointed assistant to Daiwa's
executive board.</p>
<p>The 51-year-old executive joined Daiwa out of college and
initially was a stock salesman in Sapporo, his home town. Mr.
Yoneyama's first overseas assignment came in 1971, when he
was transferred to New York for nearly 10 years. After that
he worked at the parent company's headquarters in the
international finance and investment departments, and in 1984
was sent to Zurich to head the firm's Swiss subsidiary.</p>
<p>Mr. Yonetani, 50, is coming from London where he is deputy
head of Daiwa's European operations. He has been posted to
London twice and once to Australia.</p>
<p>Noting that Mr. Yonetani has spent more than 10 years in
London where he "has been doing a lot of corporate finance
and investment banking business," Nobuaki Ohmura, an
executive vice president at Daiwa's U.S. unit in New York,
said: "He has a very strong background in this area" and
"right now, we are expanding our capital markets area. He has
good contacts with European and Australian borrowers and
Japanese institutions, too."</p>
<p>Messrs. Yoneyama and Yonetani are both close to Masahiro
Dozen, who was named president of Daiwa's parent company in
October and who has voiced a strong interest in beefing up
the firm's overseas operations.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Tokyo transferred $100 million to the
U.S. subsidiary, raising its capital to roughly $300 million.
The parent company has the equivalent of $6.2 billion in
shareholder equity, making it one of the most heavily
capitalized securities firms in the world.</p>
<p>Mr. Yoneyama is enough at ease with Mr. Dozen to describe
his superior as someone who plays golf like a farmer, saying
that Mr. Dozen always digs up dirt when he hits the ball.</p>
<p>Unlike several of its big Japanese competitors, Daiwa --
Japan's second-biggest securities firm behind Nomura
Securities Co. -- has shied away from making large
investments in U.S. specialty firms, such as those dealing
with money management, mergers and acquisitions, and real
estate. Instead, Daiwa has preferred to build from within,
but with mixed success.</p>
<p>During the past few years, the firm became a primary
dealer in U.S. government securities and expanded its options
and futures businesses. But along with other big Japanese
brokers, Daiwa's U.S. operations have, at best, been only
marginally profitable. Specifically, the company had
difficulty expanding mortgage-backed securities and corporate
bond operations. And in 1987 and 1988, rising costs plus low
profits led to layoffs, which at one point cut the U.S. staff
to 330 from a peak of 430.</p>
<p>Daiwa currently has about 370 U.S. employees and plans to
add 30 to 50 people -- mostly professionals -- over the next
year in the areas of mergers, real estate, foreign exchange,
mortgage-backed securities and capital markets. Two weeks
ago, the firm set up a capital markets operation, co-headed
by Stephen Bradley, a former Merrill Lynch managing director.</p>
