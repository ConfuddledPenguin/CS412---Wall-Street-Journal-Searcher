	<div class="article-body"><p>New York Public Library: "Portugal-Brazil: The Age of
Atlantic Discoveries" -- More than 150 items -- navigational
instruments, rare books and letters, early maps, original
15th- and 16th-century prints, oil paintings and illuminated
manuscripts -- documenting Portugal's seafaring ways and the
encounter of Portuguese and Brazilian cultures in the 16th
century. Highlights include the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494),
which drew a dividing line in the Atlantic Ocean granting
Portugal all land to the east of the line and Spain all land
to the west; a letter dated May 1, 1500, to Dom Manuel of
Portugal relaying the first news to Europe about Brazil; and
the first edition of Sir Thomas More's "Utopia" (1516), which
was heavily influenced by written accounts of Portuguese
discoveries. Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, through Sept. 1.</p>
<p>Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian Institution,
Washington, D.C.: "Yokohama: Prints From Nineteenth-Century
Japan" -- Eighty-five color woodblock prints tracing the
development of the city of Yokohama from 1860 to 1890, the
period in which the feudal structure collapsed and imperial
power was re-established under the Emperor Meiji. Of special
interest are those that depict foreign ships arriving in
Yokohama harbor; images of foreigners that show a Japanese
fascination with Western clothing and furnishings; and prints
intended to help Japanese pronounce words in English and
other languages. Through Sept. 9. The exhibition then travels
to the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco (Oct. 10-Dec. 9),
and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Jan. 10-March 10,
1991).</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia:
"Sculptures by Duane Hanson" -- Seventeen life-size and
extraordinarily lifelike polyvinyl people sculptures created
by this Minnesota-born artist. Among others, you'll meet a
tired, beer-bellied traveler leaning on his bags, a couple of
older folks seated at a luncheonette table, and two portly
tourists loaded down with cameras. Broad and Cherry Streets,
through Sept. 23.</p>
