	<p class="article-leader">Ciba-Geigy AG, a Swiss chemical group, said present
currency rates are making it harder to reach management's
1990 goal of at least matching last year's profit.
   Hans-Peter Schaer, chief financial officer, declined to
make more specific profit forecasts, saying it was still too
early.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profits will hinge on developments in currency rates and
on the company's efforts to control costs, Schaer said,
adding that to match last year's group net profit of 1.557
billion Swiss francs ($1.10 billion) is the company's goal.</p>
<p>Schaer said Ciba-Geigy was not yet planning investment in
factories and fixed assets in Eastern Europe. However, the
company is boosting its marketing and is trading with
companies there.</p>
<p>Speaking on Eastern Europe to a Zurich business group,
Schaer later predicted that financial risks of investment and
trade will increase for a period, then gradually diminish, as
Eastern European countries reform their economies.</p>
<p>For large companies with a long-term view, he said, "the
cost of lost opportunities is in all likelihood larger than
the risks to be taken."</p>
