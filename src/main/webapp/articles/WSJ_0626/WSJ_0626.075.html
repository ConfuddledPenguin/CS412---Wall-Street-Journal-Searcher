	<p class="article-leader">Your May 9 page-one article "Fashion Statement" provided
this old Sears veteran a rare insight into the latest scheme
to achieve a trendier image for the giant retailer.
   But I think you may have been misled into thinking
something new is happening across the aisle from the paint
cans and manure spreaders. I remember very well before my
retirement three years ago that the same blandishments wafted
reassuringly from the lips of a parade of successive senior
managers and fashion consultants. Can it indeed be possible
to reinvent the wheel?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If Sears, Roebuck & Co. ever decides to stick with any
strategy long enough to see it work, the power of that
venerable merchandising organization will be awesome. But in
fact, Sears has tinkered with so many, often-conflicting,
strategies since the early 1970s (and earlier) that it should
come as no surprise that it is struggling in today's hostile
competitive environment.</p>
