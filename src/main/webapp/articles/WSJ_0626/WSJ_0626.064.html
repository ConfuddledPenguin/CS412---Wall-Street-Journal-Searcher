	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- The average unemployment rate for 16 of the
world's most industrialized countries rose to 6% of the work
force in April from 5.9% in March, the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development said.
   The latest result represents only the second time the
OECD's standard unemployment rate has risen since a general
downward trend emerged in 1986 to bring the rate down 1.8
percentage points over three years. But the organization said
the rate has been steady at 6% since last December, except
for the March decline to 5.9%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sharpest unemployment gains in April were posted by
the U.S. and Finland, with marginal rises recorded by Canada,
Japan, Australia and Italy. The unemployment situation
improved somewhat in France and Sweden, however.</p>
