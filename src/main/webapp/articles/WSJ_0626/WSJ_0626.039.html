	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Community National Bancorp Inc. directors
declared a 5% stock dividend, the first payout in 14 years by
the Staten Island, N.Y., holding company for Community
National Bank & Trust Co. of New York.
   The dividend is payable July 25 to stock of record July 3.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the annual meeting, Community National shareholders
also approved a proposal to reduce authorized shares to 15
million from 50 million. The move will reduce the franchise
tax the bank pays in Delaware, where it is incorporated; the
tax is partly based on the number of shares a company is
authorized to issue. The cut in authorized shares doesn't
affect shares outstanding. Community National has around
three million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>The bank reiterated that second-quarter earnings will drop
from the year-ago period but that it is hoping for an upturn
in the second half.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, net income fell 73% to $211,000, or
seven cents a share, from $793,000, or 30 cents a share, a
year earlier. The bank's provision for possible losses on bad
loans grew to $1.3 million from $200,000. Assets climbed 32%
to $408 million.</p>
<p>In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Community National shares rose 25 cents to $6.75.</p>
