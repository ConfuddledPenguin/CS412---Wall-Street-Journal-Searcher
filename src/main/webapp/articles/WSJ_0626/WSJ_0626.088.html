	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Rising interest rates and worries about
second-quarter profits bumped stock prices lower yesterday.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 12.13 to 2845.05,
a decline of 0.42%. Broader averages took a steeper fall:
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.12 to 352.31, or
0.88%, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index lost
1.64 to 192.60, a loss of 0.84.%</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Volume was light, with 133,100,000 shares changing hands
on the New York Stock Exchange, where declining issues
outnumbered advancers, 1,049 to 496.</p>
<p>Several of the year's most popular stocks were knocked
down yesterday by fears of weaker earnings. Caterpillar's
announcement that profit for the second quarter would be less
than half the $99 million, or 97 cents a share, reported for
the first quarter started the round of earnings scrutiny.
Caterpillar fell 5 to 58 1/2 on 1.9 million shares. In the
year-ago second quarter, Caterpillar posted net income of
$141 million, or $1.39 a share. Also, the company said its
profit for the year would be "substantially lower" than in
the previous year.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 16.42 to
1147.81, primarily due to weakness in airline stocks. AMR,
parent of American Airlines, fell 1 to 63 3/8; Delta Air
Lines slipped 1/4 to 73 3/4. Both airlines have had their
second-quarter earnings forecasts revised downward in recent
weeks, according to Zacks Investment Research. The
second-quarter consensus for AMR fell to $1.90 a share from
$2.06 about a month ago. Delta expectations now center around
$2.21 a share for the quarter compared with expectations of
$2.56 a month ago.</p>
<p>UAL, parent of United Airlines, fell 3 3/8 to 152 in light
volume.</p>
<p>"Everybody is focusing on the (fear) that second-quarter
earnings are not going to be there," said Edward Shopkorn,
director of equity trading at Mabon, Nugent & Co. "People are
getting cautious."</p>
<p>Shearson Lehman Hutton lowered its earnings forecasts on
39 companies last week and boosted projections on only 10,
said Peter Da Puzzo, the firm's co-director of world-wide
equities. With profit expectations coming down and rates
going up, "who's to say that this (sell-off) can't continue?"
Mr. Da Puzzo said.</p>
<p>The actively traded 30-year Treasury bond fell nearly one
full point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount, taking the
yield up to 8.56%. T-bill rates moved higher as the market
absorbed a record $17.2 billion weekly sale of three- and
six-month Treasury bills. Another $29.5 billion in bills and
notes is scheduled for auction later this week.</p>
<p>Tenneco, whose Case IH unit competes with Caterpillar in
the heavy-equipment market, fell 1 1/2 to 65 5/8. Analyst
Robert Christensen of Mabon, Nugent & Co. told Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report the stock's drop appeared to be
a "misplaced reaction" to the projection from Caterpillar, as
Case "doesn't have the same kind of equipment" or as much
exposure in Brazil. Caterpillar said more than half of its
expected second-quarter earnings shortfall was tied to the
performance of its Brazilian unit.</p>
<p>Earnings-related selling also hurt Armco, which skidded 1
1/8 to 7 3/8 after the company projected a loss for the
quarter. Armco said its forecast reflects plans to take about
$70 million in second-quarter charges; also, the company said
it may not be able to continue paying common stock dividends
because of provisions in certain debt agreements.</p>
<p>Philip Morris, which bucked the market's sell-off Friday
amid news of its agreement to acquire 80% of Swiss coffee and
chocolate maker Jacobs Suchard for $3.8 billion, gained 1 7/8
to 46 5/8 and topped the Big Board's list of most active
issues. About 3.2 million shares were traded.</p>
<p>Other blue chips to cushion the fall in the industrial
average included International Business Machines, which went
up 3/8 to 116 5/8; Merck, up 1/2 to 82 1/4; International
Paper, up 3/8 to 51 1/4, and Union Carbide, up 1/4 to 19 3/8.</p>
<p>Foxboro soared 12 7/8 to 51 on 1.2 million shares. Siebe
PLC, a British security systems concern, agreed to buy the
company for $52 a share.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan, which said it expects to save $300
million a year through a restructuring that may include jobs
cuts and asset sales, rose 1/2 to 24 1/8 on 1.2 million
shares. Also, the company eliminated a layer of top
management by dropping the posts of group heads for global,
institutional and individual banking.</p>
<p>Dividend-related trading swelled volume in three issues:
Southeast Banking, which declined 3/4 to 9 3/8 on 2.6 million
shares; Commonwealth Edison, which added 1/4 to 32 1/2 on 1.8
million shares, and Repsol, which rose 1/8 to 23 5/8 on 1.9
million shares. Separately, Duff & Phelps lowered its debt
ratings on Southeast Banking; the agency linked the
downgrading to "severe deterioration" in Southeast's loan
portfolio.</p>
<p>J.C. Penney dropped 2 7/8 to 59 7/8 after Kidder Peabody
downgraded the stock's investment rating and cut its earnings
estimates for fiscal 1991 and 1992, citing indications that
its sales so far this month remain sluggish. The company said
it expects June sales for stores open at least a year to show
a gain in the mid-single digits from last year's level.</p>
<p>Wellman skidded 3 1/4 to 28 1/4. Du Pont, a competitor in
the polyester-fiber business, cut the price of its Dacron
fiber products by 6% to 8%; the company said it will review
the action and "react accordingly" to remain competitive.</p>
<p>Quantum Chemical dropped 7/8 to 17 7/8. Citing
polyethylene sales that hadn't met its expectations, Shearson
Lehman Hutton lowered its projection of second-quarter
earnings.</p>
<p>Honeywell went up 1 3/4 to 98 1/4. The company said a
federal district court selected a special master to handle
its patent-infringement case against Minolta of Japan, which
has been in the courts for more than three years.</p>
<p>Motel 6 rose 1 5/8 to 17 3/4. A published report cited
renewed speculation that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts is seeking
to sell its 51% interest in the partnership.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 1.89
to 357.39. Volume was 12,350,000 shares.</p>
<p>Nikkei "put" warrants are active again, following a
decline in Tokyo stocks Monday. Yesterday, the Denmark and
Salomon Brothers issues made the most-active list at the
American Stock Exchange. The Denmark issue gained 5/8 to 10
1/4; an issue from Salomon gained 3/8 to 9 1/8.</p>
<p>Material Sciences rallied 3 3/8 to 13 3/4 following news
that it authorized William Blair & Co., a Chicago-based
investment banking firm, to explore the possible sale of the
company.</p>
