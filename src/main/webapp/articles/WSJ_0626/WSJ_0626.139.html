	<p class="article-leader">EUROPEAN COURT bars sexual discrimination in pension
plans.
   In a decision binding throughout the 12-nation European
Community, the European Court of Justice says companies can't
set different pension benefits for men and women. The U.S.
Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion a decade ago. But
consultant Kwasha Lipton says the European decision is likely
to have a sharper impact than the U.S. ruling because more
plans there, following the lead of local social security
laws, have a built-in sex bias. Social security laws aren't
affected by the ruling.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sharpest impact could come in Britain, where women get
full retirement benefits at age 60 while men must wait until
65. Pension plans in Belgium, Greece and Portugal also may
have to be rewritten. And U.S. companies operating in Europe
won't be exempt from the change. "Most multinationals will
have to redesign their European subsidiaries' retirement
programs," says Towers Perrin, another consulting firm.</p>
<p>The ruling means "companies face sharp rises in pension
liabilities," Towers Perrin says.</p>
<p>JOBLESS INSURANCE reserves could be inadequate for
recession.</p>
<p>The congressional General Accounting Office says the
federal-state unemployment-pay system -- financed mostly by
payroll taxes on employers -- has accumulated substantial
reserves in the past seven years of economic expansion: $36.2
billion in state trust funds and $8.1 billion in federal
accounts as of January. Yet, a severe recession next year
could force 22 states to borrow $17.4 billion through 1995
and 17 of these states still wouldn't have enough money to
cover benefits, the GAO says.</p>
<p>States could respond as they have in the past: "making it
more difficult for people to qualify for benefits, reducing
the duration of such benefits and increasing employer taxes,"
the agency declares. Employers now pay varying amounts to
states to pay for actual benefits. The federal government
taxes employers up to $5.60 a year for each worker to finance
state and federal administrative costs, loans to states and
one-half of an extended benefits program.</p>
<p>EDUCATIONAL reimbursements thrive despite confusion and
uncertainty.</p>
<p>It's seen more cliffhangers than a Perils of Pauline
serial, but tax code Section 127 continues to entice
companies to subsidize at least part of the tuition of
workers going to school. As written now, the tax code lets
workers escape income tax on up to $5,250 a year reimbursed
by their employers for basic education and undergraduate
programs; M.B.A. and other graduate courses aren't covered.
But the law expires Sept. 30, and its fate is no more clear
now than at a series of other expirations in recent years.</p>
<p>Consultant Hewitt Associates says nearly one in 10 workers
uses the tax break. At General Motors Corp., participation by
hourly workers dropped to 6% last year from 12% in 1987,
before graduate programs were banned. But Freeport-McMoRan
Inc. goes beyond the IRS limits and reimburses all expenses;
firms can deduct the payments as compensation even if the
workers can't exclude the income from their returns. Corning
Inc.'s assistance ranges from high school night classes to
full-time study.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. pays 100% for any course approved by a
boss: "Education makes a better employee," it says.</p>
<p>RECRUITERS NEED four months to fill jobs, a month longer
than a year ago, because candidates are wary of switching
positions, says Executive Search Review.</p>
<p>MOST COMPANIES rely on a job applicant's ability to
complete a hiring form as proof of literacy, yet one in seven
firms can trace serious production delays to illiterate
workers, the Conference Board finds.</p>
<p>NO RESPECT] Two of three scientists in industry complain
employers isolate them on the sidelines and deny them the
"rewards and opportunities" extended nontechnical managers,
R&D Magazine says.</p>
<p>SAN DIEGO Epilepsy Society buys a PostalAnnex+ franchise
for $168,000 to offer experience to people with the disease
who haven't been able to get a job.</p>
<p>ENGINEER JOBS are hardest hires. But companies get by.</p>
<p>One of three "toughest-to-fill" positions on recruiter
hiring lists are engineering posts, says the Professional
Employment Research Council. So companies search wider to get
the talent they need. "We hired all we wanted but it took
longer than usual and we had to work harder," says
International Paper Co. Armstrong World Industries Inc. ends
up talking to 97 candidates for 21 jobs, up from 63
interviews a year ago when it had 22 positions to fill.</p>
<p>General Electric Co. says it's been "extremely pleased
this year with the quality and quantity" of candidates, but
it allows that cutbacks in other industries may be helping it
attract from among a slimmer number of graduates. Black &
Decker Corp. says it, too, hasn't had any recruiting
problems. "Our brand awareness and reputation" helps, the
company suggests.</p>
<p>QMS Inc. says being one of the few employers of high-tech
engineers in southern Alabama aids its quest.</p>
<p>THE CHECKOFF: Telling it like it is: Harris Bank, in a
news release announcing that 320 workers are going to be
fired, inserts a "note to editors" cautioning that "no one at
Harris will receive a `pink slip'; everyone will be informed
in person." . . . A news release we never finished reading:
"The majority of 1990 college graduates are not in the top
10% of their class."</p>
