	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Reflecting robust domestic demand, Japan's crude
steel production in the July-September quarter will grow 4.1%
from a year earlier to 27.8 million metric tons, the highest
level for the quarter in 10 years, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry predicted.
   A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. Ministry
officials estimated total domestic steel consumption in the
July-September quarter will be 19.4 million metric tons, up
3.3% from a year earlier and the second-highest level on
record.</p>
