	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- The president and four other top employees of a
division of LTV Corp.'s Missiles and Electronics Group were
suspended indefinitely pending the completion of a review by
the federal government.
   The five men work for the Buffalo, N.Y., Sierra Research
division of the LTV unit. An LTV spokesman said the division
develops radar and other defense electronics, and its primary
government contracts are with the Navy and Air Force.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The spokesman wouldn't comment on the nature of the
government review of Sierra Research programs. He said the
suspensions, which were effective Friday, are intended as "a
prudent measure . . . to make sure everything is clean and on
the up and up." The spokesman said none of the five men has
been charged "in any way" with wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In a letter to employees of the LTV Missiles and
Electronics Group, group President Robert N. Parker said,
"these suspensions are with pay and are not intended to
prejudge any involvement of these individuals in the matters
being reviewed by the government."</p>
<p>Mr. Parker said he will assume the duties of suspended
President Tom Cobb. Also suspended were Stu Penny, vice
president of business development; Roger Witt, vice president
of operations; Gene Streips, a director of business
development, and project engineer Jack Borkowski. Mr. Witt
declined to comment, and the others couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
