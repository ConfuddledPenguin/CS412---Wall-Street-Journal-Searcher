	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo's Nikkei Index sank heavily in drab trading to close
at the intraday low, pressured by index-linked trading and by
widespread unenthusiasm about the near-term outlook for
stocks.
   Meanwhile, London shares rose on a late afternoon surge,
as investors were cheered by a positive start on Wall Street.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues plunged 570.38 points
to 31124.19. The index lost 392.70 points Friday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index
rebounded 136.50 points to 31260.69.</p>
<p>Monday's volume on the first section was estimated at 300
million shares, off from 350.7 million shares Friday. Losers
widely outnumbered advancers 904 to 120, while 100 issues
were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section tumbled 40.04 points, or 1.71%, to 2301.02.</p>
<p>The second section index fell 47.16 points, or 1.14%, to
4088.26. Volume in the section was estimated at 12.4 million
shares, down from 19.7 million shares Friday.</p>
<p>Insufficient volume has been one of the most detrimental
factors in the market lately, traders said.</p>
<p>Japanese securities firms' research groups have estimated
that Wall Street needs about 170 million shares a day in
order to be profitable, whereas Tokyo needs at least 700
million to 800 million, noted Stephen Leist, manager of
Japanese equity sales at S.G. Warburg Securities (Japan) Inc.</p>
<p>"There's just not enough liquidity," one trader at a U.K.
securities firm said. "Fund managers have no confidence in
this market."</p>
<p>Even if institutional investors had wanted to participate
and take advantage of lower prices yesterday, there wouldn't
have been enough activity to complete the transactions, the
trader noted.</p>
<p>Moreover, although the Big Four securities firms, which
usually try to add volume and initiate buying sentiment, were
quiet as the weak yen would have made such efforts pointless,
traders said.</p>
<p>Institutional money is increasingly flowing out of stocks
and into money market instruments, or toward hedges against
futures, traders said.</p>
<p>The bearishness is underlined by concerns about global
interest rates, partly stemming from uncertainty about German
monetary union, observers noted.</p>
<p>"People are afraid that West Germany might increase
interest rates, which, if that's the case, will of course not
be good for the market. As a result, the market's just going
to stay at this level," the U.K. firm's trader said.</p>
<p>At the same time, he noted, baseless chatter on the
possibility of another Bank of Japan official discount rate
increase and other negative sentiments keep surfacing as
participants become more disenchanted with the market.</p>
<p>"With no stories to watch out for, there's really nothing
else they can do other than talk," he said.</p>
<p>Electricals were mostly lower. But Hirose Electric rose
160 yen to 7150 yen ($1.03 to $46.16), Kyocera rose 70 yen to
8170 yen, and TDK gained 20 yen to 6800 yen.</p>
<p>Sony fell 120 yen to 8450 yen, Matsushita Electric
Industrial fell 30 yen to 2060 yen, and Pioneer fell 30 yen
to 6070 yen.</p>
<p>Domestic-demand related issues suffered from the weaker
yen. Steel, construction, mining and retail shares fell.</p>
<p>In London, nervousness in the early going on the back of
Wall Street's slump Friday had trimmed prices to the day's
minimums. But once the New York market opened steadily,
London investors breathed a sigh of relief and propelled the
U.K. market higher.</p>
<p>In addition, dealers suggested that institutions are still
cash-rich and hesitant to sell any stocks. Indeed, as the
market slipped to lower levels, traders said fund managers
and institutional investors were net buyers of British
equities.</p>
<p>"There's a marked reluctance to sell," said one trader.
"The perception is growing that the U.K. is still one of the
cheapest and best-performing markets on a global basis."</p>
<p>But dealers were quick to warn that participation remained
sketchy on the first full day of the new two-week trading
account. Moreover, some suggested that a cautious tone would
prevail until the end of the week when stock-index futures
and options expire.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
20 points to 2398.5, the day's best level and well above the
early morning 2361.2 minimum. Some dealers suggested that the
index looks set to pierce 2400 today.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index gained 16.4 points to
1929.4. Volume was a calm 379.1 million shares, compared with
the 497.8 million issues Friday.</p>
<p>Interest rate sensitive stocks were better on weekend
media reports that suggested that U.K. interest rates could
be down to 12% by year end from the current 15%. Although
some market professionals suggested that this was too
optimistic a scenario in the near term, several sectors
dependent on interest rates were bolstered.</p>
<p>Among these, builder Tarmac added 11 pence to 284 pence
(19 cents to $4.91), cement and building products group RMC
gained 12 pence to 689 pence, retailers Burton Group grew 11
pence to 169 pence, Kingfisher rose 7 pence to 372 pence,
while Marks & Spencer rose 5 pence to 245 pence.</p>
<p>Dealers said takeover speculation continued to bubble in
the composite insurance sector. Commercial Union Assurance
added 4 pence to 523 pence, General Accident advanced 11
pence to #11.19, Guardian Royal Exchange rose 5 pence to 246
pence, while Sun Alliance gained 3 pence to 332 pence.</p>
<p>Tobacco and luxury products group Rothmans International,
set to disclose year-end results tomorrow, fell 14 pence to
760 pence after strong rises late this past week.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, U.K. controls group Siebe fell 25 pence to 505
pence after saying it was to pay $656.4 million for Foxboro
Co., a U.S. supplier of process automation and control
equipment.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, stocks closed higher in Paris, Frankfurt,
Brussels and Madrid; lower in Zurich; mixed in Stockholm and
Amsterdam; and unchanged in Milan. South African gold stocks
closed higher.</p>
<p>Also, stocks ended lower in Seoul, Wellington, Manila and
Singapore, higher in Hong Kong and Taipei, and little changed
in Sydney.</p>

as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
