	<p class="article-leader">RYE, N.Y. -- Melville Corp. announced plans to create the
nation's fifth-largest drugstore chain by acquiring Peoples
Drug Stores Inc. for $330 million.
   Melville, which owns CVS drugstores, an 811-unit chain in
14 states, mostly in the Northeast, with sales in 1989 of
$1.95 billion, agreed in principle to buy Peoples. Peoples, a
subsidiary of Montreal-based Imasco Ltd., operates 490 stores
in five mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia. It
had 1989 sales of $1.02 billion. The acquisition would
increase the size of Melville's drugstore division more than
50%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Melville, which also owns specialty retailers of apparel,
footwear, toys and household furnishings, said it will
finance the acquisition from operating cash flow and existing
lines of credit.</p>
<p>At the start of 1989, Peoples was nearly twice its current
size. But in three separate transactions, Imasco sold 319
stores to focus on the chain's core mid-Atlantic market.
Analysts say the remaining stores were Peoples' best, and the
price Melville agreed to pay reflects it. While Melville said
it is paying slightly less than book value, analysts say the
purchase price, based on Peoples' 1989 operating income of
$14 million, is a hefty multiple of 24 times earnings.</p>
<p>"The stores they picked up are the successful core of the
drugstores that remained," says Bruce Buckley, editor of Drug
Store News, a trade journal. "But it sounds like Imasco got a
good price."</p>
<p>"CVS and Peoples make an ideal geographic and strategic
fit," said Stanley P. Goldstein, Melville's chairman and
chief executive officer. "Both have excellent store
locations, with similar customer profiles, and Peoples is
positioned in dynamic and growing markets."</p>
<p>Mr. Goldstein, who co-founded CVS in 1963, defended the
price he is paying for Peoples. The chain's operations
already are improving, he said. "We see this as an
underperforming asset."</p>
<p>Robert Huth, Melville's chief financial officer, said
"over time, Peoples should add substantially to the growth
and profitability of the drugstore divisions."</p>
<p>William Smith, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &
Co., says, "There's definitely room for improvement" in
Peoples' operating profit margin, which is less than 2%. By
contrast, CVS's operating margin in 1989 was 7.8%. But given
Mr. Goldstein's record at CVS, which is highly regarded among
drugstore analysts, the acquisition "looks like a good fit,"
Mr. Smith says.</p>
<p>In 1989, Melville earned $398 million on sales of $7.5
billion. In addition to CVS, its stores operate under the
Marshalls, Wilsons, Chess King, Meldisco, Thom McAn, and
Kay-Bee Toy names.</p>
<p>Melville expects to continue to operate Peoples stores
under its current name.</p>
