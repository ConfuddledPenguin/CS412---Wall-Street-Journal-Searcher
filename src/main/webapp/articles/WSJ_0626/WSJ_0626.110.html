	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that states can
require most minors to notify at least one parent before
obtaining an abortion.
   Two court decisions, hailed by abortion opponents, will
stoke abortion controversies in this fall's elections and
could prompt state legislative actions next year to restrict
the right to abortion for minors. The decisions also permit a
half-dozen states to begin enforcing abortion restrictions on
minors that have been blocked by court orders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By a 5-4 margin, the high court ruled it is
unconstitutional for a state to require that a minor notify
both her parents without exceptions. By a different 5-4
margin, the justices said Minnesota had corrected this
constitutional flaw in its state law by allowing minors to
obtain a judge's permission to have an abortion without
notifying her parents.</p>
<p>In a separate 6-3 decision, the court upheld an Ohio law
that requires notification of one parent or a court
procedure. The court procedure requires a minor to specify
whether she is seeking a judge's approval because she
believes she is mature enough to make her own decisions or
because notifying a parent wouldn't be in her best interest.
The court stopped short of deciding whether such a bypass is
necessary when states impose a one-parent notification
requirement.</p>
<p>Abortion-rights activists say such parental-involvement
laws are an artifice for curbing abortions rather than a tool
for promoting family discussions. They argue, moreover, that
forcing some young people to consult with their parents on
such a highly emotional subject can cause irreparable
psychological damage in a family or even prompt physical
harm. They also say provisions forcing teens to discuss the
issue with a judge are intimidating and discomfitting.</p>
<p>"Minors were today's victims," says Roger Evans of Planned
Parenthood Federation of America.</p>
<p>Abortion opponents said the court ruling would spur
legislative action to curb teen abortions. "Given the great
public popularity of laws that give parents some say when
their young daughters are facing the trauma of a difficult
pregnancy, these decisions will encourage state legislators
to pass additional laws," said Burke Balch, state legislative
director of the National Right to Life Committee.</p>
<p>Lawmakers and activists in Idaho and Montana already were
moving to place their state laws in line with the guidelines
established by the high court. "We're going to go ahead and
make some adjustments," said GOP state Sen. Mark Ricks, a
leading abortion opponent in Idaho, where a strict
anti-abortion law was vetoed last spring by Democratic Gov.
Cecil Andrus.</p>
<p>Public support for abortion rights lessens substantially
in cases involving minors, where voters tend to see the issue
as more of a family problem than a question of personal
rights and reproductive freedom. Abortion-rights activists
have avoided making minors' rights the centerpiece of their
movement. Nevertheless, Kate Michelman, executive director of
the National Abortion Rights Action League, called the two
decisions "alarming."</p>
<p>Many abortion-rights activists have avoided a hard line on
the question of abortion for minors; NARAL assisted Democrat
Douglas Wilder in his successful Virginia gubernatorial race
last year despite his support for parental-involvement
provisions.</p>
<p>"The court is going through the exact same balancing act
that every candidate is going through: They want to be a
little pro-choice and a little pro-life," said Douglas
Bailey, a Republican political consultant. "If you're a
candidate, the safest position to be in is to be pro-choice
overall but in favor of some parental notification."</p>
<p>The court's action permits laws to go into effect in at
least six states where they had been blocked: Georgia,
Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, Nebraska and Ohio. Variations of
such laws are already in effect in Arkansas, Utah and West
Virginia.</p>
<p>Parental-involvement provisions are an issue in the Texas
gubernatorial race, and controversies are certain to flare in
other fall elections, particularly in gubernatorial and
senate races in Iowa. The issue probably will be tested in a
public vote in Oregon.</p>
<p>The Alan Guttmacher Institute, which formerly was
affiliated with Planned Parenthood, estimates that about
183,000 abortions are performed annually on minors under 18
years of age, roughly 11% of the total performed in the U.S.
Studies show that about half of the minors who get abortions
consult with at least one parent, with three out of four of
those under the age of 15 discussing the issue with a parent.</p>
<p>"The young women who feel they can talk to their parents
about this situation will do it, and the young women who feel
they can't often have good reasons not to," said Ellen Story,
associate executive director of the Family Planning Council
of Western Massachusetts. "There are abusive family
situations; there are cases when the pregnancy is caused by a
family member; there are instances when this information
could lead to serious health and psychological crises in a
family."</p>
<p>The rulings marked the first time that Justice Sandra
O'Connor voted to find a state abortion regulation
unconstitutional. She joined the 5-4 Minnesota ruling,
written by Justice John Stevens, that a requirement for
notifying two parents, without an alternative for a court
hearing, is unconstitutional. She also was the deciding vote
to uphold the two-parent Minnesota law once the court
procedure is activated.</p>
<p>In the past, she has acted to stop the court's
conservatives from overruling the right to abortion, while
joining them to uphold most state restrictions on abortion.
But yesterday "was the first time that she has said the
constitutional liberty of a woman includes the right to
terminate a pregnancy," said Harvard Law School Prof.
Laurence Tribe. That may limit how far Justice O'Connor is
willing to cut back on the right to abortion.</p>
<p>The decisions showed how divided the court remains over
the issue, taking months to try to reach consensus, yet
producing nine separate opinions in the two cases.</p>
<p>While the justices said a two-parent-notice law must allow
for a court procedure to bypass the parents, they didn't
decide whether a one-parent-notice law also must allow a
court bypass: They simply upheld Ohio's law, which does
provide for a court procedure. That open question, in Justice
Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in the Ohio case, is
likely to encourage states to pass one-parent-notice laws
without provisions for court hearings, according to both
Prof. Tribe and James Bopp of the National Right To Life
Committee.</p>
<p>In the Minnesota case, the justices also voted, 6-3, to
uphold a requirement that minors wait 48 hours for an
abortion after notifying their parents.</p>
<p>In the Minnesota case, Justice Stevens's decision blocking
the absolute two-parent requirement was joined by Justices
O'Connor, William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and Harry
Blackmun. Justice Kennedy, joined by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist and Justices Byron White and Antonin Scalia
dissented, voting to uphold the requirement. Separately,
Justice O'Connor joined Justice Kennedy's bloc to uphold the
two-parent requirement once a court hearing provision is
added. The 48-hour wait was agreed to by six members of the
court, with Justices Marshall, Brennan and Blackmun
dissenting.</p>
<p>In the Ohio case, Justices Blackmun, Brennan and Marshall
dissented from Justice Kennedy's decision. (Hodgson vs.
Minnesota; Ohio vs. Akron Center for Reproductive Health.)</p>
