	<p class="article-leader">BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- MGM Grand Air wants to ease one
of the business traveler's greatest burdens: coach-class
travel.
   The small transcontinental luxury airline said it will
begin offering Aug. 16 a new, upgraded service for standard
coach-class fare. For the standard unrestricted Los
Angeles-New York coach fare of $623 one way, MGM Grand Air
will offer such frills as roomy leather seats, telephones,
video monitors and gourmet meals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The airline, a unit of MGM Grand Inc., has offered a
first-class service, at a current unrestricted fare of $1,017
one way, since September 1987.</p>
<p>The airline's newly reconfigured DC8 Super 62 aircraft
will seat 79, with 39 passengers in first class and 40 in
coach. Those planes will replace MGM Grand's 727-100s and
will nearly double its capacity. The bigger planes prompted
MGM's decision to offer the new service, rather than trying
to fill all seats with first-class passengers.</p>
<p>The cheaper fare raises questions as to whether MGM
Grand's current clientele will try to save a few bucks by
moving to the back of the plane. Charles Demoney, the
airline's president and chief executive officer, said the
company believes those customers will still want first-class
service.</p>
<p>Last year, the airline reported a load factor of 73.9%,
and revenue of $30.2 million.</p>
