	<p class="article-leader">Armco Inc. said it will post a second-quarter loss and may
omit its quarterly dividend, reflecting persistent problems
in its reinsurance business.
   The Parsippany, N.J., steelmaker didn't disclose the size
of the expected second-quarter and first-half losses, but
said they could violate certain debt convenants and prevent
continued payment of the 10 cent-a-share dividend. Armco said
its board will examine options, which the company wouldn't
identify, to continue payment of the dividend and noted that
cumulative preferred stock dividends won't be affected.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Armco
common fell $1.125, to $7.375. Still, analysts noted that the
company had $640 million in cash at the end of the first
quarter and that the dividend announcement, while
disappointing, doesn't indicate a liquidity problem.</p>
<p>Armco said it will take a $70 million after-tax charge in
the second quarter, including $30 million related to the
Armco Financial Services Group companies, which are being
liquidated. The bulk of the remaining charges, which were
previously announced, reflect a $20 million jury award
against Armco in a 1986 breach of agreement suit and a $15
million federal tax assessment.</p>
<p>In this year's first quarter, Armco had net income of
$12.9 million, or 12 cents a share. A year ago, Armco had net
income of $75.6 million, or 84 cents a share, including a $45
million loss from discontinued operations.</p>
<p>Armco ventured into the reinsurance and financial services
business in the 1970s and early 1980s to reduce dependence on
the cyclical steel market. But the operations have been
plagued by huge claims. In 1984, the company stopped writing
new business and began liquidating the bulk of its insurance
companies.</p>
<p>The company has taken several insurance-related write-offs
since then. However, with this latest charge, the company
said it "is confident that the major problems {in its finance
and insurance companies} are behind it."</p>
<p>Charles Bradford, an independent steel analyst, said he
was encouraged by the company's optimistic outlook. "For the
first time, the company is able to say it is confident now
that the problems are behind it," he said.</p>
<p>Should Armco be forced to suspend its dividend, it would
mark the second time in seven years. In 1984, the company
omitted its then 40-cent a share dividend to save cash in the
face of major steel and insurance related write-offs. The
10-cent-a-share dividend was reinstated this past year.</p>
