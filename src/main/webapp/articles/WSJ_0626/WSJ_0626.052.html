	<p class="article-leader">SEATTLE -- A fistfight between organizers. A litigious
Hungarian. Angry fishermen. Too little hype, too few
reservations and too many unsold tickets.
   The Goodwill Games -- Ted Turner and the cable industry's
answer to the Olympics -- appear headed for trouble three
weeks before they begin.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Of course, that's what people once said about Cable News
Network.</p>
<p>On July 20, many of the world's best athletes will convene
here for the second quadrennial Goodwill Games, Mr. Turner's
brainchild meant to foster superpower harmony while creating
17 days of high-profile programming exclusively for cable.</p>
<p>So far, however, it's the games' problems that stand out
in bold relief. Hundreds of hotel reservations have been
canceled, ticket and advertising sales are cool, and both
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. and the games' Seattle
Organizing Committee are expecting big losses. Though Mr.
Turner has never viewed the games as a short-term moneymaker,
a repeat of the 1986 fiasco in Moscow -- a $26 million loss
for Turner Broadcasting -- could doom the games with the
bottom-line-oriented cable operators who now control his
board.</p>
<p>But one lesson learned from years of Ted Turner watching:
Never underestimate the man. His Cable News Network and
Turner Network Television channels were widely ridiculed
during their formative stages, but both blossomed into
thriving networks. No other live, international events are
scheduled during the Goodwill Games, so a few world records
and East-West grudge matches could draw a big global
following.</p>
<p>And if things do work out, as Mr. Turner likes to say,
"How would you like to own the Olympics?"</p>
<p>Turner Broadcasting executives aren't panicking. Mr.
Turner, the company's chairman, declined to be interviewed
for this article, but Paul Beckham, president of the Goodwill
Games and Turner Broadcasting's senior vice president of
finance and administration, says, "If we show progress both
financially and in the quality of the event, then I think the
board will go forward" with future games.</p>
<p>Just what constitutes "progress" may be hard to figure. No
company has ever created a sporting event anywhere near as
grand as the Goodwill Games, so the benchmarks for success
aren't clear. Turner Broadcasting executives and board
members mention such intangible goals as the "excitement" and
"credibility" that the games can bring cable TV; they relish
the prospect of international media coverage and world
records. But audience ratings and ad revenue matter, too, and
U.S. viewers have never shown wide interest in such sports as
gymnastics, swimming and track outside of the Olympics.</p>
<p>"The measurement for success is certainly, `Will people
tune in?' But it's also, `Will it be treated as a serious
sports event?'" says Brian Roberts, a Turner Broadcasting
director and president of Comcast Corp., the nation's
third-largest cable operator. "At a time when nobody is
saying too many nice things about the cable industry, it's
nice to do these things."</p>
<p>At the moment, few people in Seattle are saying too many
nice things about the Goodwill Games. The event's
city-supported local organizing committee is running several
million dollars in the red, in part because of limits on the
advertising it can sell due to conflicts with national
sponsors lined up by Turner. Seattle officials are
threatening to withhold permits for the games unless
organizers come up with $310,000 for extra fire protection;
the games committee wants to pay $17,000.</p>
<p>Moreover, local fishermen are fuming about having to miss
several days of prime salmon fishing in Shilshole Bay while
the Goodwill Games yacht races are held there. Hoteliers are
mad about Turner's recent cancellation of some 700 room
reservations, and they and other travel industry executives
criticize what they say have been lackluster efforts to
promote the games on the West Coast.</p>
<p>"All of us overestimated the notoriety of the games
outside this market," says David Palmer, assistant vice
president of marketing for Alaska Airlines, which has booked
only half the tour packages for the games that it had
expected to sell. Sheila Hyman, a travel agent in suburban
San Francisco, adds, "People are confused as to what the
games even are."</p>
<p>Some incidents have led locals to dub the event "the
Badwill Games." At an early planning session for the games, a
senior Turner Broadcasting executive decked a top official of
the Seattle Organizing Committee for badmouthing the Turner
organization. More recently, Ladislao Jajczay, a Hungarian
English student in Seattle, sued the games' organizers for
using a promotional photograph of himself dressed as a Soviet
basketball player. Mr. Jajczay, who says he didn't understand
what the photographer said when he posed for the picture,
says he hates the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Within Turner Broadcasting, the games have been beset by
management changes and some belt-tightening. Last summer,
Robert Wussler, Mr. Turner's right-hand man since 1980 and
the creator of the first Goodwill Games, resigned to become
chief executive officer of Communications Satellite Corp.'s
Video Enterprises unit. With Mr. Wussler gone and Mr. Turner
spending less time at the Atlanta headquarters, senior
management has focused more on stemming losses and less on
producing a show for the ages, executives say.</p>
<p>"A little bit of the pizazz of the event left with Bob,"
says Rex Lardner, former director of programming for NBC
Sports and general manager of the Goodwill Games. "He was so
much of the heart and soul of the event."</p>
<p>Budgets were cut, particularly for promotional efforts. As
recently as March, Turner's research showed that just one in
four male heads of households in the U.S. even knew what the
games were. Even so, Turner executives gutted plans to
advertise the event on non-company-owned networks and in
newspapers. Other public-relations campaigns were curtailed
as well, including a contest in schools and a multicity tour
by athletes.</p>
<p>Had he remained with Turner, Mr. Wussler says, he wouldn't
have been so thrifty. "Whatever the losses are from the first
two sets of games, if the Seattle games are successful in
terms of media response, Ted Turner has another big hit on
his hands."</p>
<p>Mr. Lardner says the promotional efforts are on track.
"Our big thrust will be on-air promos on our own four
networks," he says, adding that Turner's networks are now
airing one 30-second spot an hour on the games. "This is a
cable exclusive; we want to hit as many cable households as
possible."</p>
<p>Another difficulty has been selling the games to
advertisers. Though several sponsors have signed up,
including PepsiCo Inc., Turner Broadcasting hasn't found one
willing to serve as the sponsor of the games as a whole, for
the big fee that could make the event profitable.</p>
<p>"A number of sponsors are skeptical now," says Mr.
Lardner. "They want to wait and see" how the 1990 games fare.</p>
<p>The company has had better luck with cable systems. To
show the games, the operators must pay a $1-per-subscriber
surcharge to Turner Broadcasting. So far, operators
controlling 80% of the 50 million or so cable viewers who
normally receive Turner's WTBS superstation have agreed to
air the games. It helps, of course, that Turner Broadcasting
is part-owned by cable operators that account for more than
25% of those subscribers.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Turner Broadcasting's expected loss from the
games continues to swell. The company originally said it
expected a loss of about $10 million on the 1990 games, but
it has already taken $13 million in charges to cover losses.
"Hopefully, it won't be too much worse than that," Mr.
Beckham says. "It could be."</p>
<p>Other executives close to the company say the loss will
probably be closer to $25 million, not including so-called
make-goods, the commercial time that Turner Broadcasting must
give advertisers to compensate for any shortfall in promised
audience ratings. The company has guaranteed ratings of at
least 5% of U.S. households watching television during the
games -- though some Turner executives say they'll be content
if they can deliver 3%.</p>
