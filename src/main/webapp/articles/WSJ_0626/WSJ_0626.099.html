	<p class="article-leader">American International Group Inc. said it agreed to
acquire aircraft lessor International Lease Finance Corp. in
a cash-and-stock transaction valued at about $1.3 billion.
   International Lease Finance, based in Beverly Hills,
Calif., is one of the fastest-growing companies in the
jetliner remarketing business. But, by nature, it has a heavy
debt structure and is eager to tap into the giant pool of
cash that American International, one of the world's largest
insurance and financial-services firms, is able to provide.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"With the tremendous appetite for capital that we have,
this is a very appropriate merger," said Steven Udvar-Hazy,
International Lease Finance's president. In fact, as part of
the transaction, American International plans to provide its
new subsidiary up to $125 million in financing.</p>
<p>Maurice Greenberg, chairman of New York-based American
International, said the acquisition is part of the insurer's
strategy to expand its financial-services group, which was
formed in 1987. American International is already in the
interest-rate and currency swap business, as well as in
specialty financing and office equipment leasing. It also
recently formed a commodity trading operation, known as AIG
Trading, with three former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
officials.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenberg said International Lease Finance "provides a
diversified, rapidly growing source of earnings to AIG,"
adding that he believes the International Lease Finance
purchase and the formation of AIG Trading will help the
financial-services group double its operating profit next
year.</p>
<p>Dan Hersh, who tracks International Lease Finance for the
Los Angeles brokerage Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc.,
said he thinks that having American International as a parent
will give International Lease Finance more flexibility in the
way it peddles its portfolio of aircraft, which now consists
of 98 airplanes with an asset value exceeding $3 billion.</p>
<p>"They can take bigger risks with credit now that they're
out of the public market," he explained, adding that being a
"quasi-private" subsidiary will make them more akin to their
chief rival, GPA Group Ltd., of Shannon, Ireland.</p>
<p>Mr. Udvar-Hazy said that International Lease Finance had
been looking for a "strategic combination" since late last
year and was first introduced to American International in
March. Becoming a part of such a cash-rich concern, he
asserted, should "lower the company's funding costs and, in
turn, allow us to lower our leasing rates to our clients."</p>
<p>International Lease Finance has been highly profitable,
riding a world-wide wave in air travel and airplane sales.
Just yesterday, the company reported that second-quarter
earnings soared 57% to $24.7 million, or 64 cents a share,
from a year-earlier $15.7 million, or 41 cents a share.
Revenue for the period ended May 31 jumped 28% to a record
$111.7 million from $87.1 million.</p>
<p>In 1989, International Lease Finance earned $61.2 million.
American International's financial-services group posted
operating net of $149.8 million last year.</p>
<p>American International said it will use internal sources
to fund the cash portion of the acquisition, and Mr.
Greenberg added that the buy-out would cause "virtually no
dilution" of American International's earnings this year.</p>
<p>Terms of the agreement call for International Lease
Finance holders to receive either $32.50 in cash or 50 cents
in cash plus 0.3 American International common share for each
International Lease Finance share outstanding, subject to a
maximum number of shares and certain other adjustments.</p>
<p>According to the deal between the two companies, if the
market price of American International's stock exceeds $104 a
share during a specified period prior to the merger, the
exchange rate will be adjusted so that the value of the
American International common stock portion will equal $31.20
per International Lease Finance share. Similarly, if American
International's stock price is below $86 at the time of the
closing, the value of the American International stock
portion will be adjusted to equal $25.80 per International
Lease Finance share.</p>
<p>The acquisition is still subject to International Lease
Finance shareholder approval, the delivery of various
opinions on the tax consequences of the move and other
conditions. Certain terms also might have to be adjusted to
reflect American International's previously announced 5-for-4
stock split, to be paid as a 25% stock dividend on July 23.
The merger is nonetheless expected to close in the fourth
quarter.</p>
<p>The financial markets closed yesterday before the
acquisition was announced and before International Lease
Finance disclosed its second-quarter results. American
International shares closed at $96.625 down $2.375 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. International Lease
Finance shares fell 50 cents to $27.125 in national
over-the-counter trading. Some short-sellers have been
playing the company's stock of late, expecting the aircraft
buying boom to slow and International Lease Finance's bubble
to burst.</p>
<p>The aircraft-leasing company will operate as a wholly
owned unit of American International, though it will remain
an indpendent debt issuer. International Lease Finance
currently has on the market about $1.5 billion in commercial
paper and medium-term notes.</p>
<p>Mr. Udvar-Hazy will remain president of the unit, which
will maintain its headquarters in Beverly Hills. Louis Gonda
will remain executive vice president. And Leslie Gonda will
keep his post as International Lease Finance chairman, while
also becoming an American International board member. All
three men, who together founded International Lease Finance
in 1973 and collectively control more than 50% of the
company's 36 million shares outstanding, said they have opted
to take stakes in American International.</p>
