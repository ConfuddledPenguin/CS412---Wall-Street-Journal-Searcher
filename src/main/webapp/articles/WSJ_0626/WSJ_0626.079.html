	<p class="article-leader">CHELM, Poland -- "I'm going to ask an indiscreet
question," Jan Pietrzak says into the microphone at center
stage. "Who saw me in the 1970s?" He barks: "Hands up]"
   Out on the peeling wooden benches of Chelm's amphitheater,
50 cheerless miles from the Soviet border, the audience
titters. "I mean, please raise your hands," Mr. Pietrzak
says, now patronizing instead of terrorizing. A few hands go
up. "I'm not surprised. I was rationed then. Is there a
combatant who saw me in the '60s?"</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Not a hand rises this time.</p>
<p>"Ah, the most frightened generation. Won't admit to
anything. Believe me, you are free to laugh." A hand finally
waves in an upper tier. "There's one] Thanks to you, you who
came to see me, I survived until today -- without subsidies,
without a telephone] You'll never get rid of me now]"</p>
<p>The audience breaks into applause.</p>
<p>It has been 16 years since Jan Pietrzak's troupe last
played Chelm, during a brief lapse of Communist vigilance. In
those days, he was lucky to get the show out of a private
apartment and into a basement coffeehouse. No wonder he needs
moral support from his fans today. Poland gave communism the
boot a year ago, but the spectacle of a political revue in
the Chelm amphitheater on a hot Saturday afternoon still is
too bizarre for Mr. Pietrzak to believe.</p>
<p>Poland's famously censored satirist looks out at a crowd
of small-town Poles -- 2,500 of them -- who have come in
their finery, with bags of strawberries and scads of kids,
for two hours of songs, skits and stand-up comedy. Behind
him, across the backdrop, the Communists have left a memento
of their deadpan reign. "Motherland is Our Cause," reads a
slogan in giant red letters. As Mr. Pietrzak's joke goes, it
doesn't specify which motherland.</p>
<p>"After so many years -- in Chelm again," he exults,
striding on stage, past the piano and drums, for his opening
monologue. "The last time I came to Chelm it was in the
Polish Peoples' Republic. This time it's in the Republic of
Poland. The people have been in power for so long, they've
disappeared]"</p>
<p>In blazer and tie, with gray hair and trimmed moustache,
Mr. Pietrzak, at 53, looks a lot less somber than his old
fall guy, the general in dark glasses, but not nearly so
chipper as his hero, the union leader from Gdansk. If
politicians have it tough in Poland's new republic, political
comedians have it tougher. With the Communists out, Mr.
Pietrzak has lost his shtick.</p>
<p>Just getting to see his act used to be an achievement.
Today, a state entertainment agency produces it. And the
people of Chelm may be hicks, but they're no fools. They
expect new material.</p>
<p>The Poles had an analogy for communism's phony freedom:
Democracy is to socialist democracy as a chair is to an
electric chair. Now, Mr. Pietrzak has an update for last
year's dissidents: It's easy to sit down, but a lot harder to
get up.</p>
<p>The old system was a comic's playground, a gag that had
already been running a decade when Mr. Pietrzak began working
the student clubs in 1957. He didn't exactly opt for
political satire. In the ubiquitous state he couldn't avoid
it. As he likes to say, "You'd sing a song about parsley, and
they'd think it was about them."</p>
<p>Unamused, the Communists kicked him out of the clubs in
the mid-1960s and confined him to a coffee shop that seated
only 50. In the mid-1970s, they banned him altogether. He
passed the hat on the apartment circuit until Solidarity
bloomed in 1980 and he became its jester. He got on
television, entertained the strikers with classic one-liners:
"In the Sahara, socialism would run out of sand." And he
wrote Solidarity's anthem, "Let Poland Be Poland." An
American TV special picked it up; Ronald Reagan wrote a nice
letter.</p>
<p>Martial law landed him back underground, then into the
coffee shops again, with a table booked for the censors at
every show.</p>
<p>But now what? The revolution has taken away the fun of
telling anti-Communist jokes that Communists don't get.</p>
<p>Somehow, as he lays into old enemies at the amphitheater
in Chelm, Mr. Pietrzak's lines seem shaded by rancor and
pity. When he sings "Let Poland Be Poland," it sounds more
sentimental than defiant. Beside the stage, his underground
tapes and videos are on sale, repackaged as his "archives."
Is Jan Pietrzak's cabaret in danger of becoming a nostalgia
act?</p>
<p>Not if his first post-Communist troupe can help it. "I
welcome all generations," Mr. Pietrzak announces, bringing on
stage a young comic, Marek Majewski, who lets the audience in
on the cabaret's troubles with a song that goes: "You have to
hit them] Ridicule them] Flog them]"</p>
<p>"Right," Mr. Pietrzak interrupts. "It's easy to say. But
who do you hit?"</p>
<p>"It used to be simple," sings Mr. Majewski. "It was
obvious who made it hard on us. But now it's not them who
have the power. It's -- "</p>
<p>"Us]" Mr. Pietrzak shouts.</p>
<p>That calls for an adjustment. In a democracy, political
satire can't just flog the losers. Accustomed to siding with
the good guys, Mr. Pietrzak has to force himself to pick up
the whip.</p>
<p>Solidarity does have its easy marks. Even Lech Walesa
himself commands an uncommon talent for triple-talk. As Mr.
Pietrzak cracks, "One day Lech thinks the government is good.
The next day he thinks the government is bad. And on the
third day, he denounces what he said on the previous two
days."</p>
<p>The audience breaks up, but this approaches hallowed
ground. A few things are still sacred in Poland. Mikhail
Gorbachev, for one, is too dangerously lame to be an object
of fun. The Poles have another raw nerve right now, but is
there a comedian in the world who can swear off jokes about
the cost of living?</p>
<p>Every comic on Mr. Pietrzak's card takes a potshot at
Poland's crash into capitalism.</p>
<p>Marek Majewski: "Soon Poland will be a country of rich
people, because the poor will die of hunger."</p>
<p>Krzysztof Jaroszynski: "I saw some people walk out of a
grocery with their mouths wide open, like fish in an
aquarium. This is what I call price shock."</p>
<p>Pawel Dluzewski: "They say everybody should set up a
business. A lot of people believe it -- so they open shops,
they open post offices. They do it at night. They aren't
afraid of risk]"</p>
<p>"So many funny things," Mr. Pietrzak tells the audience.
"The price of tickets -- isn't that funny?" At $1.50 apiece,
the people of Chelm aren't laughing. "I'm very amused. Two
tickets for half a liter of vodka. That's what I'm reduced
to. Such an artist]"</p>
<p>His circumstances, kidding aside, are even slimmer. Mr.
Pietrzak has never dwelled on money; he's been pleased to
perform. A master at talking his way out of police stations,
he is less able at negotiating a contract. For this day's
work, he and his cast will share a fee of $300. The state,
producer of the show, still gets the last laugh.</p>
<p>After the finale -- a rousing song that boosts cabaret as
the one true guide to Polish politics -- Mr. Pietrzak can
hardly bear to let his paying customers go.</p>
<p>"Was it worth it?" he calls after them as they depart.
"Will you come next time? It's important]" They applaud in
the affirmative, and he tosses out his closing line, yet
unchanged for the new Poland: "See you in better times]"</p>
