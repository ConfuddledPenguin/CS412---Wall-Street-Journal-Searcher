	<p class="article-leader">Motorola Inc. is gambling that the world needs a new
cellular phone system that uses dozens of low-orbit
satellites to connect people in remote spots to the rest of
the planet.
   The system, to be announced with fanfare today at the
Hayden Planetarium in New York, would cost $2.1 billion to
fully put in space as early as 1996. "We think this is the
way of the future," said John F. Mitchell, Motorola's vice
chairman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the 77-satellite system -- which the company has
dubbed "Iridium" -- faces big obstacles. Among other things,
the Schaumburg, Ill., electronics and semiconductor company
needs partners, money, regulatory approval and customers to
make it work.</p>
<p>The way Motorola sees it, a call from a portable cellular
phone in the middle of nowhere -- beyond the range of current
cellular systems -- would be routed through the
"constellation" of small satellites. That would give the
business person in the boondocks and the skipper at sea
instant, clear contact with anyone else -- and vice versa.</p>
<p>The Iridium system would use digital switching and
transmission to handle both voices and data. But it wouldn't
replace the current land-based cellular system. That means
Motorola could continue to sell existing equipment even as it
pushes expensive new equipment necessary to make calls on the
new system.</p>
<p>A big risk is that consumers will get confused. Craig O.
McCaw, chairman of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the
nation's largest cellular phone service company, noted that
cellular is growing and changing faster than anyone dreamed
just a few years ago. "All of us have a lot of work to do to
see how all these {different networks} are going to fit
together."</p>
<p>Still, Mr. McCaw said his company is "excited" at the
potential of the new system to provide universal phone
coverage.</p>
<p>Others think Motorola's new system is closer to
pie-in-the-sky than satellites-in-the-sky. "This may have
some applications for {airline} flight communications
services and in countries where there is limited service, but
there's no way I can see this technology will be viable
anywhere in the U.S.," said Herschel Shosteck, president of
Herschel Shosteck Associates Ltd., a Silver Spring, Md., firm
that specializes in cellular market analysis.</p>
<p>He noted that by 1992 -- before Iridium is expected to
transmit its first call -- more than 90% of the people in the
U.S. and Canada will have access to regular cellular service.
This will be augmented by the first high-capacity digital
systems. And most of Western Europe will have similar
coverage.</p>
<p>Motorola expects the mobile and portable terminals that it
would make for the system to cost "as low as" $3,000. Though
Motorola expects the price to fall over time, Mr. Shosteck
notes that today's cellular phones are far cheaper at $400 to
$500.</p>
<p>Motorola also must get other companies or countries to
participate in a consortium to operate and pay for the $2.1
billion space portion of the system. Motorola might put up as
much as 20% of that total, but John Pemberton, a mobile
communications analyst at Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn.,
says the cost is far higher than he expected.</p>
<p>In addition, operators of the new network face the
daunting task of getting new licenses from the Federal
Communications Commission and other international bodies to
operate a satellite network in the new frequency.</p>
<p>And since current cellular systems operate at a different
frequency, existing phones "would have to be programmed to
operate with the new frequency," said Gregory J. Vogt, chief
of the FCC's Mobile Services Bureau. "That could be a very
expensive proposition" for customers, he said. Motorola
brushed aside such concern, saying it would design its system
to be compatible with all cellular phones.</p>
<p>Still, Motorola's plan isn't being taken lightly. "They're
a well-established company" both in working with regulators
and coming up with money, said Mr. Pemberton of the Gartner
Group. He says there's an 85% chance that the system will
fly.</p>
<p>In contrast to larger communications satellites now in
high orbit, the Motorola plan calls for small, low-orbit
satellites that would allow easy radio links with portable
cellular phones and clear sound with no delays or "echoes."
It envisions 600,000 to 800,000 users in the first five
years, and millions more after that.</p>
<p>The company says it's investing $40 million to $60 million
to help prove the concept. But it sees itself mainly as a
supplier to the system. Motorola's ambitious schedule calls
for the launch of two demonstration satellites in 1992.</p>
<p>Motorola said the U.S. Delta and Atlas rockets and the
European Ariane could launch multiple satellites, and the
Pegasus air-launched vehicle could send up individual
satellites.</p>
<p>The company said three organizations have agreed to study
the potential of the satellite network: American Mobile
Satellite Corp., which is licensed to provide mobile
communications by satellite for the U.S. (and in which McCaw
Cellular is a partner); and Telesat Mobile Inc., which has
similar authorization for Canada; and the International
Maritime Satellite Organization, a consortium that provides
satellite communications for ships and aircraft. The maritime
group's director general, Olof Lundberg, said it will study
the system as a possible successor to its existing satellite
network.</p>
<p>Motorola also said it has briefed the FCC on its plans and
talked with potential partners. "The technical effort is
going on full bore," said Mr. Mitchell. "By the end of this
year, or early next year, we'll have a much clearer picture
of who the players will be."</p>
