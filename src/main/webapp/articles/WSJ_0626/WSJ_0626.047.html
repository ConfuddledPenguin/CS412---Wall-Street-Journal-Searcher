	<p class="article-leader">Back in the mid-1980s, Pioneer Group Inc. was looking to
diversify away from its core business of managing mutual
funds. So what did this staid, old-line company decide to do?
Prospect for gold in Ghana.
   "I know it's a little unusual to have a mutual fund
company in the gold-mining business," concedes William
Keough, Pioneer's chief financial officer. "We view it as
some sort of earnings protection in the event the stock
market does have a prolonged slump."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The combination of mutual funds and gold mining isn't
exactly winning rave reviews on Wall Street. Compared with
other mutual fund companies that are publicly traded, Pioneer
is a stock-market laggard. While Franklin Resources' stock
trades at 14 times earnings and T. Rowe Price at 13 times
earnings, Pioneer -- which closed yesterday in
over-the-counter trading at $24.75 a share -- trades at less
than ten times its trailing 12-month earnings of $2.52 a
share.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Pioneer has attracted an impressive array of
shareholders, including such top money managers as the
Templeton funds, Tweedy, Browne Co. and Southeastern Asset
Management. A close look at Pioneer helps explain why.
Pioneer is trading for less than the value of its mutual fund
business, alone, say analysts. And some think Pioneer's foray
into gold mining could produce handsome gains.</p>
<p>John Keefe, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
figures a top fund company generally has a value of three
times revenue, or alternatively a little more than 2% of
assets under management. That means Pioneer's fund business,
with annual revenue of $62 million and assets under
management of $7.4 billion, may be have a value of $28 a
share, analysts say.</p>
<p>Pioneer also has $6 a share in cash and investments, net
of all debt. Add that to the value of the fund business, and
Pioneer -- ignoring the gold-mining operation -- is trading
at a 27% discount to its indicated true value.</p>
<p>William Miller, who has bought Pioneer stock for the
mutual fund he manages, Legg Mason Special Investment Trust,
reckons Pioneer's fund business has a value closer to $30 a
share. "The Pioneer funds are well-established funds with
good records," he says. "It's difficult to quantify, but that
would clearly qualify it for some sort of premium (price)."</p>
<p>Pioneer has $7.4 billion under management, $7 billion in
nine broker-sold mutual funds and the balance in private
accounts. Pioneer's largest fund by far is the $4.5 billion
Pioneer II, which has returned an average 18% a year during
the past ten years, versus 17.7% for the Standard & Poor's
500 stock market index and 16% for the average stock fund
tracked by Lipper Analytical Services.</p>
<p>While investment results have generally been good at
Pioneer's funds, critics argue that the fund group has been a
poor marketer. Pioneer seems to have taken the criticism to
heart. It has launched five funds in the past four years, and
three more are planned.</p>
<p>But the biggest potential boost to Pioneer's earnings
could come from the gold mine, which is 90%-owned by Pioneer
and the rest by Ghana's government. Starting up the mine,
located 160 miles west of Accra, Ghana's capital, hasn't been
easy.</p>
<p>"It's not New York," says Mr. Keough, Pioneer's financial
chief. "The concession is part of a gold-ore-bearing reef, so
there are gold-mining operations nearby. We're not out in the
jungle all by ourselves."</p>
<p>Pioneer has sunk more money into the project than it
originally intended. Not only was Pioneer forced to buy out
the 27% stake of its partner, Glencar Explorations PLC, but
the company also has ended up overseeing all the mining
operations after losing an outside contractor.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to pretend that everything has run as
planned," says Mr. Keough. "When you do a project of this
size, obviously there are surprises."</p>
<p>Legg Mason's Mr. Miller reckons the gold mine is probably
worth what the company has sunk into it, $33.6 million, or
about $5.50 a share. But others are more optimistic. "The
real question is whether they get lucky with the gold
business," says one money manager.</p>
<p>The optimists note that proven gold reserves are estimated
at 1.6 million ounces, and probable reserves of an additional
700,000 ounces. Pioneer expects to be producing gold by the
end of this summer, though the mine won't be at full
production until the second half of 1991. By then, the mine
should be producing gold at a rate of 100,000 ounces
annually, Pioneer says.</p>
<p>How much would 100,000 ounces a year be worth? That
depends not only on the price of gold but also on Pioneer's
production costs. For its part, Pioneer is keeping mum on the
production costs. Mr. Keough will say only that, with gold at
$350 an ounce, "we would expect that operations will provide
meaningful contributions to net income" when the mine is in
full production.</p>
<p>Once the gold mine is in full operation, Pioneer will get
an annual 20 cents-a-share boost to its net income if there
is a $25-an-ounce gap between production costs and the price
of gold. If that gap doubles, so will the boost to net.</p>
<p>So how big will the gap be? Nobody knows for sure, not
even Pioneer. But for those given to speculation, think about
this: Pioneer's mine is using a gold-extraction technique
known as heap leaching, which -- depending on the richness of
the ore body -- generally involves production costs of about
$250 an ounce.</p>
