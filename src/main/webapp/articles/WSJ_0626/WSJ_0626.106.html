	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Democratic negotiators at the budget talks
struggled to overcome their differences as President Bush
sought to break an apparent stalemate in the negotiations by
inviting top congressional leaders to breakfast at the White
House this morning.
   Negotiators from both sides have been saying they need to
make significant progress this week if they are to reach a
deficit-reduction compromise before September. But chances
for that are fading. A negotiating session planned for
yesterday afternoon was canceled; Republicans blamed the
Democrats and Democrats blamed the administration.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Democrats uniformly want to avoid blame for the tax
increase they -- and many Republicans -- expect to be part of
any deficit-reduction compromise. But they differ
substantially on tactics. Some want to demand that President
Bush put a new offer on the table before proceeding, even if
that risks breaking up the talks; others are now ready to
quietly pursue a compromise with administration negotiators.</p>
<p>The differences among Democrats reflect both the
institutional characteristics of the House and Senate and
variations in style among the players. Several senators argue
for a more confrontational stance. Some House members side
with them, but others are more conciliatory.</p>
<p>Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) said
yesterday that Congress simply should proceed with its budget
resolution and appropriations bills so that the
administration "will understand that this {the budget summit}
is not going anyplace until the president gives us a more
substantive offer."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush invited to breakfast this morning the top
Democrat and Republican in each chamber -- the same quartet
he invited last month to kick off the budget summit -- as
well as House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), who
chairs the talks. The invitations followed attempts by Budget
Director Richard Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady
to convince distrustful Democrats that the administration
sincerely seeks a deficit-reduction compromise rather than
partisan advantage.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Republican congressional negotiators sought to
raise pressure on the Democrats. "We're waiting for the
Democrats. . . . " said Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), after
meeting with Mr. Bush yesterday. "They are not ready to
discuss serious resolution to issues."</p>
<p>Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) added: "We know what we want
to do. We want a deal. . . . We know we want one. They're not
sure they do."</p>
<p>Mr. Darman, responding to the Democrats' demand for a new
offer, last week essentially repeated Mr. Bush's January
budget request and proposed another $11.7 billion in new
spending cuts. But that apparently did little to advance the
negotiations, instead offering Democrats a new target to
shoot at.</p>
<p>Democrats promptly reminded administration negotiators
that no Republican in the House or the Senate was willing to
put the president's original budget proposal to a vote.</p>
