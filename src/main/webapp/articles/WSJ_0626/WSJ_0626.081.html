	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Southern Co. said its subsidiaries will receive
about $300 million, before taxes, in a settlement with Gulf
States Utilities Co. over disputed power sales contracts.
   Southern Co., the giant utility holding company, said the
proposed settlement will be made in the form of a financial
package, including cash, common stock and deferred payments.
The company said it couldn't estimate the effect on earnings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gulf States, based in Beaumont, Texas, said the settlement
was in the best interests of its shareholders. The
four-year-old dispute "was like a dark cloud hanging over us,
preventing us from looking into the future," a spokeswoman
said.</p>
<p>Gulf States said its cash outlay would total $167 million.
Of the remaining $133 million, $68 million is in an escrow
account, and the balance will be paid in the form of six
million new shares of Gulf States common stock.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman for Gulf States said the company expects
to take an after-tax charge to net income of between $110
million and $115 million in 1990. In 1989, Gulf States posted
a loss of $45.5 million, or $1 a share, on revenue of $1.6
billion.</p>
<p>The dispute began in July 1986. Gulf States, which had
contracted to buy approximately $1 billion in electricity
from Southern Co. over a 10-year period beginning in 1982,
asked Southern Co. to consider renegotiating the contracts
because energy demands had fallen below predicted levels.
When Southern Co. declined, Gulf States filed suit in U.S.
District Court in Beaumont. Southern Co. countersued in
December 1988.</p>
<p>No hearings had been scheduled for the suits. Both cases
were still in discovery.</p>
<p>Southern Co.'s president, Edward L. Addison, said in a
statement, "We're pleased that we've been able to resolve
this contract dispute in out-of-court negotiations and come
to terms that protect the long-term interests of our
companies."</p>
<p>As collateral for future payments, Gulf States said it
will pledge the Lewis Creek Generating Plant, a 520-megawatt
gas-fired facility near Willis, Texas. Gulf States will also
provide Southern Co. with transmission access to the plant at
a rate approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</p>
<p>The settlement is subject to several contingencies,
including approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Southern Co. said the settlement will terminate the contracts
and end litigation between the parties.</p>
