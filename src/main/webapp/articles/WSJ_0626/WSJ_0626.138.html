	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- House and Senate conferees approved
legislation that would bar discrimination against handicapped
individuals on a broad front, including public accommodations
and employment.
   The bill was approved by wide margins in both chambers,
and if the conference version passes the House and Senate, it
is expected to be signed by President Bush. Known as the
Americans with Disabilities Act, the measure would extend to
about 43 million disabled persons the kind of protection
against discrimination now afforded by a patchwork of state
and local rules and in requirements for federal contractors
and grant recipients.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The conferees killed an amendment in the House bill that
specified that food companies could transfer workers with
contagious diseases to jobs that didn't involve handling
food. The amendment dealt with employer concerns about
employees with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</p>
<p>Senate conferees ignored a nonbinding resolution passed by
the Senate, instructing them to accede to the House
amendment. They quoted Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan that the AIDS-causing virus cannot be
transmitted by handling food and that an amendment based on
public "fears and misconceptions" would only complicate
efforts to control the disease.</p>
<p>The Senate conferees also noted that both the bill and
existing law already allow employers to transfer or fire
workers who pose a direct threat to the health and safety of
others.</p>
