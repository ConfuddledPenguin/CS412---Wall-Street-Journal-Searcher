	<p class="article-leader">Sankyo Co., a major Japanese pharmaceutical maker, said
its consolidated pretax profit for the year ended March 31
rose 1.4%, to 36.16 billion yen ($233.4 million) from 35.67
billion yen a year earlier.
   Net income declined 7.9% to 13.02 billion yen from 14.13
billion yen, after paying a larger amount of taxes due to
extraordinary profits caused by the disposition of reserves
for retirement allowances. As a result, per-share net fell to
36.41 yen from 39.89 yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales were down slightly at 425.63 billion yen from 426.04
billion yen.</p>
<p>Sales of agrichemicals dropped 10.9% to 39.17 billion yen,
affected by the government's continuing policy to cut the
number of rice fields.</p>
<p>Sales of pharmaceuticals posted a 1.2% increase, to 282.22
billion yen, while those of foodstuffs inched up 1.6% to
48.79 billion yen.</p>
<p>Sankyo predicted consolidated pretax profit of 40 billion
yen for next year, with expected net income of 18 billion
yen. Sales were projected at 440 billion yen.</p>
