	<p class="article-leader">AMSTERDAM -- Dutch retail sales in April increased a
provisional 6% from the year before, the Dutch Central Bureau
of Statistics reported.
   The 6% gain doesn't take into account increases caused by
inflation, which pushed prices 2.2% higher in April, compared
with April 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The strong rise in retail sales occurred despite the fact
that the long Easter weekend fell in April this year and in
March last year, the government said.</p>
<p>Department store sales, however, fell 4.1%.</p>
<p>The strongest growth came in the food sector, where sales
rose 7.7% from a year earlier. Sales in the non-food sector
advanced just 5.5%, but sales of household articles jumped
18.5%. Sales of flowers and plants rose 12.7% and drugstore
sales increased 10.7%.</p>
<p>In the food sector, sales of meat were up 5.1%, sales of
groceries added 5.8% and sales of milk and dairy products
climbed 5.3%, the statistics bureau reported.</p>
