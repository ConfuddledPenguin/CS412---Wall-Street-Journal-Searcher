	<p class="article-leader">With not much to send around except its spot-headed
president, maybe the Soviet Union could think about exporting
Russian operas. All we ever seem to see are mustily draped
"Sleeping Beauties" from the Bolshoi Ballet and never-ending
shipments of paintings from the Hermitage. Why don't they
send over a production of "Prince Igor" instead with a full
contingent of Polovtsian maidens?
   Here is an undeservedly unfamiliar opera of epic splendor
as worthy of the stage as "Boris Godunov," "Eugene Onegin" or
"Pique Dame," the only Russian operas in regular repertoire.
"Igor's" power comes across even in the new Sony release
recorded in the National Palace of Culture in Sofia featuring
mostly home-grown talent, including Nicolai Ghiaurov, whose
bass voice is as empty by now as the Central Asian steppes
where the Polovtsians pitch their tents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The opera opens with Igor, a faintly historical figure
plucked from Russia's dark ages, leaving his wife and the
comforts of Putivl to subjugate heathen tribes raiding
southern towns. Not much better at this than spothead, Igor
immediately is captured by the leader of the Polovtsians, an
uncommonly courtly fellow who entertains him lavishly with a
full dance rendition of "Stranger in Paradise." The best
tunes from "Kismet" were stolen from "Prince Igor," whose
compositional history is somewhat complicated.</p>
<p>Alexander Borodin could never finish it. A chemistry
professor, he wasn't particularly well-trained in music and
spent much of his life poring over test tubes studying the
properties of nitrogen in a disheveled apartment famous in
Moscow for a large colony of cats who ate his dinner and
attacked his guests. Two friends, Rimsky-Korsakov and
Glazunov, finally completed "Igor" after Borodin's death,
often filling in blanks by pulling from their memories the
melodies Borodin had played for them on the piano -- or just
making things up as they went along. A lot of Borodin seems
to have fallen off the table in the process: The essay
included in the Sony set suggests Rimsky and Glazunov may
have dropped as many as 5,867 bars of music. Borodin only
wrote 6,880]</p>
<p>For all that, and passing on the question of just who
exactly composed this opera -- something Ms. Dorothea
Redepenning of the Sony text doesn't really rassle with --
"Igor" is a surprisingly coherent work, a tad weak on
character development, to be sure, but rich in majestic
tableaux that make a great effect even when compressed down
to CD size. Emil Tchakarov conducts with spirit and breadth;
the singing is variable. Boris Martinovich sings Igor with a
steady, resonant bass long gone from Mr. Ghiaurov, who is
cast as Konchak Khan, the Polovtsian. The prince's wife is
piercingly sung by Stefka Evstatieva. The best performances
come from mezzo Alexandrina Milcheva, who brings a lovely
tone to the Khan's daughter, and the Sofia National Opera
Chorus.</p>
<p>Rimsky always was helping his dead friends. Hardly had
Mussorgsky slushed down his last bottle of booze than Rimsky
sat down with "Boris Godunov," reharmonizing, editing,
reorchestrating. The result was a gussied-up "Boris," slick
and splashy (the Coronation Scene really got Rimsky excited,
adding bells left and right). In fact, as the new Erato set
reminds us, Mussorgsky's own second version is preferable. It
may be more primitive in its wistful, often unconventional
harmonies, but the subject of the opera is no "fin-de-siecle"
sophisticate.</p>
<p>The album was taped three years ago in Washington, D.C.,
with Mstislav Rostropovitch conducting the National Symphony
Orchestra and, less happily (at least for us), his wife,
Galina Vishnevskaya. She came out of retirement to sing what
sounds like a private arrangement of Marina's music.
Punishment of a sort followed. The set was used as the
soundtrack for a weird movie of "Boris" that premiered this
spring. The last time I was in Paris, Ms. V was trying to get
some sort of injunction against the film because it featured
a couple copulating while she was singing offscreen. She
thought it was undignified. I'd worry more about this record.</p>
<p>The rest of the cast is quite fine. Ruggero Raimondi is
very impressive, an unusually velvety Boris, compelling in
his mad scene. Vyacheslav Polosov is labored, but manly still
as the false Dimitri, and there is a memorable vignette from
a Dimitri of the past: Nicolai Gedda, who closes the opera as
the simpleton, weeping quietly over a Russia doomed to
sadness.</p>
<p>Except that somewhere in the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk,
luck and genes combined to produce Dmitri Hvorostovsky. He is
a young baritone born in 1962 who won the Cardiff competition
last summer and just a few months later was signing major
recording deals while being heavily photographed on a sunny
terrace in Monte Carlo. Baritones usually don't take off like
that, but Mr. Hvorostovsky is very special indeed to judge by
his first Philips album.</p>
<p>Sturdily accompanied by Valery Gergiev leading the
Rotterdam Philharmonic, Mr. Hvorostovsky sings Tchaikovsky
and Verdi arias, all of them very familiar pieces (well,
maybe not Tchaikovsky's "The Sorceress"), but then, he will
be singing this repertoire soon enough in the major opera
houses, and we might as well get a foretaste. Easily,
smoothly his voice pours out, incredibly controlled and even,
yet also expressive and beautifully timbred. Only the covered
and constricted top strikes me as oddly problematic in such
an otherwise nearly perfect instrument. Well, there's plenty
to distract from this shortcoming, including the baritone
himself, an unusually good-looking, pouty young man.</p>
