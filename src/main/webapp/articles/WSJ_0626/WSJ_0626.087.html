	<p class="article-leader">Saatchi & Saatchi Co., determined to rid itself of its
consulting businesses at any cost, dumped its Peterson
Consulting unit -- for which it paid $116 million -- for less
than $20 million.
   Saatchi said it agreed to sell Chicago-based Peterson to
the consulting firm's management for an initial payment of
just $2 million, with additional payments over the next 10
years of at least $20 million. Saatchi will also take on
Peterson liabilities with a net total of $5 million --
meaning that initially, at least, it will in effect be paying
Peterson to buy itself back.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"They're giving Peterson $3 million {upfront} to take it.
I don't understand the logic," says Richard Sanderson, an
analyst with Panmure Gordon in London. "They're actually
giving it away."</p>
<p>A Saatchi spokesman readily conceded that the agency won't
come close to realizing its investment in Peterson, and that
the agency is basically just cutting its losses. Peterson "is
a poor, underperforming, loss-making business, and all we're
interested in is getting out at whatever cost it takes -- and
that is plus or minus zero," he said. Peterson was profitable
for the year ended Sept. 30, 1989, but for the six months
ended March 31, 1990, it had a loss of #4 million ($6.92
million).</p>
<p>Saatchi stock barely reacted to the news, with the
company's American depositary receipts closing off 12.5 cents
to close at $4.25 a share in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday. Saatchi shares have already been
hammered, reflecting analysts' low expectations; ADRs now
trade at less than a quarter of their 52-week high of $17.25.</p>
<p>The paltry take for Peterson, bought in 1987, "wasn't a
surprise," says Laurie Goldberger, an analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton. The price doesn't matter that much because
"you don't quite care how {the consulting business} goes
away; they've achieved the benefit of getting rid of the
downside."</p>
<p>The sale of Peterson, along with that of Saatchi's other
consulting firms, has been complicated by the fact that the
firms' major assets are their executives. Saatchi has been
negotiating management buy-outs with the consulting
executives, who hold all the cards because they know their
businesses have no value without them.</p>
<p>"The problem is that these are boutique businesses. If
Peterson's principals leave, then what are you left with? Air
-- and some liabilities," says Greg Ostroff, an analyst with
Goldman Sachs. "I was under the impression Saatchi was just
looking to get out without any more liabilities."</p>
<p>Peterson executives were obviously well aware of their
clout. In a statement, Saatchi said it agreed to the
unfavorable deal because it couldn't find an outside buyer
and because Peterson senior management's contracts expire at
the end of this year. If Saatchi didn't sell to management,
Saatchi "might well find that the business ceased to be
viable" at year end, the company said. Shutdown costs would
be "substantial," it added. Peterson executives declined
comment.</p>
<p>The Peterson agreement, which requires shareholder
approval, comes just a few weeks after Saatchi finally agreed
to sell its biggest consulting firm, Hay Group, back to
management. A deal to sell its largest remaining consulting
firm, Gartner Group, is expected to be set in the next few
weeks. Saatchi also owns three other, small consulting
businesses, but two of them -- an employment agency in the
U.K. and a real estate consulting firm in the U.S. -- are
facing economic downturns in their industries. The Saatchi
spokesman said sales of both of those are "on a back burner."</p>
<p>Saatchi has said recently that it expects proceeds of all
its consulting firms to total #80 million for the year ending
Sept. 30. The Hay sale amounts to #45 million to #50 million.
But Mr. Ostroff says the total figure may be elusive,
considering the prices Saatchi is eking out in its consulting
firesale, and that Saatchi "will probably come up short."</p>
<p>Still, analysts depict the sale as a mark in favor of
Saatchi's new chief executive officer, Robert Louis-Dreyfus.
When he joined in January, the French executive vowed to get
out of the consulting business as quickly as possible -- a
feat Saatchi had been unable to accomplish since putting the
consulting business up for sale last year.</p>
<p>"It's a business they shouldn't have been in, and now
they're out," says Alan Gottesman, an analyst with
PaineWebber. "It's quite an accomplishment to be done with
the deal."</p>

<p>Babbit & Reiman Gets `Us'</p>
<p>Straight Arrow Publishers awarded its $1 million Us
Magazine account to Babbit & Reiman, Atlanta.</p>
<p>Babbit & Reiman replaces Minneapolis agency Fallon
McElligott, which continues to handle Straight Arrow's
Rolling Stone magazine. Us decided to look elsewhere about a
month ago, "when we couldn't seem to agree on a creative
approach," said Leslie H. Zeifman, group publisher.</p>
<p>"We had given Babbit & Reiman a two-week window of
opportunity to prove that they would deliver a tremendous
campaign, and they did," Mr. Zeifman said.</p>
<p>Fallon McElligott had created the magazine's "Definitely
Not Us" ads, which sought to peg Us somewhere between People
and Vanity Fair, even as critics claimed Us's readership was
getting more downscale.</p>
<p>The account is another in a string of wins for
four-year-old Babbit & Reiman. The agency won the $1.5
million USA Today account in January, and has also garnered
Financial News Network and RJR Nabisco's corporate account.</p>
