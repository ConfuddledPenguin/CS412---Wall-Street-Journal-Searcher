	<p class="article-leader">If the quote from Rep. Patricia Schroeder in your May 16
Notable & Quotable is accurate, then Rep. Schroeder is
woefully ignorant of the historical role of business in a
capitalist society if she believes the role of corporate
America is to act as a public service rather than to buy and
sell its businesses. In fact, the role of corporate America
is to do business profitably and legally by acting in its own
best interest, which may or may not involve buying and
selling its businesses. This proper corporate behavior has,
for the most part, proved mutually beneficial to the public
and the corporations, and has provided the greatest good for
the greatest number of people.
   Rep. Schroeder must be talking about the role of business
in the Soviet Union, where, philosophically, business acts as
a public service and has helped produce the standard of
living the Soviet people enjoy today.</p>
