	<p class="article-leader">Public Benches Depart
   From Traditional Design</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>NEW SEATS are showing up in public places -- handsome,
strong and often vagrant proof.</p>
<p>Rodney Kinsman, a London designer, has produced a
futuristic bench that resembles an airplane wing. Seat and
back panels of aluminum, steel or upholstered plywood form a
skin over exposed aluminum brackets, which are mounted on a
steel beam.</p>
<p>Mr. Kinsman's "Trax" seating is in British and European
train stations and is under consideration for airports.
Gullans International of Bridgeport, Conn., plans to import
it.</p>
<p>Intentionally not comfortable, another entry, the
"flip/seat" is more of a perch where people can rest briefly.
It has a rectangular plastic seat that automatically flips
down, out of the way, when not in use. Jack Carter, a New
York City Transit Authority maintenance official, says this
keeps rain and snow from accumulating on the seats. And the
wobbliness makes nap-taking impossible.</p>
<p>The "flip/seat" was designed by David Goodwin of Britain
and is manufactured by Fixtures Furniture of Kansas City, Mo.</p>
<p>More graceful is the "Plexus" seating of LFI/Landscape
Forms of Kalamazoo, Mich. Inspired by a German product, LFI
got Nicola Balderi, an American, to design a contoured seat
that's made of metal grid.</p>
<p>More cities are requesting arms between seats to prevent
vagrants from sleeping. But William H. Whyte of New York, who
writes on cities, says that "for fear of winos, they're
making these public places unpleasant to ordinary people."</p>
<p>Videos in 3-D Build The</p>
<p>Clients' Confidence</p>
<p>CARTOONS HELP architects and builders save time and money,
and make sales.</p>
<p>As computer hardware costs come down and software quality
goes up, 3-D animated videos are allowing home buyers and
business people to "walk through," "drive by" or "fly over"
their new home or office, before a single shovel of dirt is
turned.</p>
<p>"Clients hate surprises," says Michael Mason, president of
Larsen & Ludwig, Pittsburgh architects. "Video animation
means fewer surprises." Mr. Mason's firm uses software made
by Cubicomp Corp. of Hayward, Calif., which can provide 16
million colors and details like the reflection of clouds in
windows.</p>
<p>Jendoco Construction Co. says a Larsen & Ludwig video
helped it win the contract to build a new computer center for
Bell Telephone Co. of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Instead of buying their own systems, some architects
employ consultants such as New York's Corrigan LoVerde Group,
which uses software by Wavefront Technologies of Santa
Barbara, Calif.</p>
<p>Byrne Murphy, vice president of Kaempfer Co., a real
estate developer, says a 60-second Corrigan LoVerde film has
been "extremely useful" in lining up tenants for the
redeveloped Warner Building in Washington. "Unlike a model,
you can ship the video all over the place," he says.</p>
<p>Electronic Woodwinds:</p>
<p>For Now, a Lonely Band</p>
<p>TOY or professional musical instrument? Makers of
electronic saxophones, clarinets and flutes grope for a
market.</p>
<p>Electronic winds look and feel like regular acoustic
instruments. But connected to computers, the air blown in can
generate a built-in accompaniment, or a whole orchestra.</p>
<p>Yamaha has just introduced a wind instrument for the
student and semi-pro markets. Jazz flutist Jim Walker says
that a high school musician could pick up the "WindJamm'r,"
which resembles a clarinet, and "in an afternoon start making
some fun music." Listed at $650, the instrument is a
scaled-down version of Yamaha's WX11, in turn scaled down
from the discontinued WX7, which won design prizes but sold
poorly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, disappointed by poor sales, Akai is redesigning
its electronic wind instrument to make it look and act more
like a real woodwind. The new model will list for about
$1,400. And at the lower end, Casio is having trouble selling
its saxophone -- like "digital horn," even for the discounted
price of $69.</p>
<p>Experts suggest a number of reasons for this poor showing.
There are relatively few wind players and their market, at
least for now, may have become saturated. Unlike piano
players, wind players don't have to lug around heavy
instruments and thus have less incentive to go electronic.</p>
<p>Finally, says Richard Ash of Sam Ash Music in New York, a
large retailer of musical instruments, "wind players are much
more conservative."</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>SOME 47% of large consumer goods companies say they have
changed some of their packaging to be more environmentally
friendly, says a Gallup poll commissioned by Teague
Associates. . . . U.S. and Soviet designers simultaneously
published a 16-page newsletter -- one in English, one in
Russian -- in New York and Moscow. They used the satellite
communications system and printshops of AlphaGraphics.</p>
