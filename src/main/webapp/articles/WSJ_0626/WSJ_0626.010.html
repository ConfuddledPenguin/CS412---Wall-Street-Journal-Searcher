	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Ned Crabb, editor of The Wall Street Journal's
letters column, won a special recognition for headline
writing.
   Mr. Crabb received a Wuxtry award from the International
Society for General Semantics, San Francisco, and its
quarterly, Et cetera. The Wuxtry award is named for the cry
of newsboys at the turn of the century.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some of Mr. Crabb's clever headlines included "Apocalypse
Soon" over a letter expressing concern about the effect of
crack and other drugs on America, in response to a Wall
Street Journal front-page story; and "Woodstock: Monday
Morning Coming Down" over a letter about one person's
disappointment at the music festival two decades ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Crabb is the author of a novel, "Ralph," and a
contributor of humorous essays to the editorial page.</p>
