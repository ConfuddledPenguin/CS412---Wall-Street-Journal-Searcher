Tow, a cable television and cellular telephone executive,
chairman and chief executive of the utility and
telecommunications company.
   As chairman, Mr. Tow fills a position vacant since last
year. As chief executive, he succeeds Ishier Jacobson, who
retires June 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Tow, 60 years old, will continue as chairman and chief
executive of Century Communications Corp., New Canaan, Conn.,
which owns about 2.2% of the Series A common shares of
Citizens Utilities.</p>
<p>Mr. Tow, who has been a director of Citizens for almost 15
months, said the two companies are "not linked from a

to run both companies, a spokeswoman said: "Management teams
at both companies are very strong; they will run day-to-day
operations."</p>
