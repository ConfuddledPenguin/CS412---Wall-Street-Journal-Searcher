	<p class="article-leader">Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Ltd., a London unit of
Los Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp., said a
step-out, or appraisal, well in the Saltire field in the
North Sea indicates the field's estimated recoverable oil
reserves are 30% greater than formerly believed, or about 130
million barrels.
   Previously, the field's recoverable reserves of
high-quality oil were estimated at 100 million barrels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Occidental said the appraisal well had flows at stabilized
daily rates of 9,635 barrels of oil and 13 million cubic feet
of gas.</p>
<p>The Occidental unit said the test-well results also
indicate that the Saltire field, about 120 miles northeast of
Aberdeen, Scotland, is larger than previously believed. As a
result, the company will seek Britain's approval to develop
the field, starting next fall, at an estimated cost of $600
million. Production is expected to begin in the second half
of 1992. Occidental is the well operator and holds a 36.5%
interest in it.</p>
