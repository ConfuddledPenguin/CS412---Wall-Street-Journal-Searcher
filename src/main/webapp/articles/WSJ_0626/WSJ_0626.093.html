	<p class="article-leader">Caterpillar Inc. shares tumbled after the company
disclosed that it expects current-year earnings will be
"substantially lower" than those of an earlier year, on flat
sales.
   The Peoria, Ill., maker of heavy equipment said it expects
significant "negative short-term effects on profit" from
deterioration in the economy of Brazil -- where it operates a
unit -- as well as from delays in completing a costly
plant-modernization effort, and the effects of a corporate
reorganization.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Caterpillar shares dived $5 to close at $58.50 on heavy
volume of almost 1.9 million shares.</p>
<p>In 1989, Caterpillar had net income of $497 million, or
$4.90 a share, on sales of $10.88 billion. The company had
described its 1990 earnings picture in milder terms, saying
only that net would be "under considerable pressure" and
projecting a slight sales increase. But its first-quarter net
of $99 million, or 97 cents a share, was off 30% from a year
earlier, despite a 9% rise in sales to $2.87 billion.</p>
<p>Caterpillar said it expects second-quarter net will be
"less than half" the first-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>"Generally speaking," said Wertheim Schroeder & Co.
analyst Mitchell I. Quain, the problems Caterpillar cited
"appear to be temporary. . . . Most of this is nonrecurring"
and doesn't appear to significantly take away from what he
continues to see as strengthening "earnings power in the
years ahead" for the company.</p>
<p>Still, he noted, Wertheim had been projecting per-share
earnings of about $4 to $4.25 for this year, but "now I think
you'll see everyone go down to about $3 for 1990."</p>
<p>Caterpillar said the largest reason for the projected
downturn this year is what it called a "dramatic decline" in
results at its Caterpillar Brasil unit. The unit was
profitable through 1989 and the first quarter of this year,
but Caterpillar now expects the unit to incur an operating
loss for the year. Caterpillar said sales have softened in
Brazil since a new government economic program went into
effect in March; the government move, by weakening Brazil's
currency, also means that the sales which do occur translate
into fewer dollars for the parent.</p>
<p>Caterpillar also noted, as it has previously, that the
dollar's recent strength vs. the yen makes U.S. exports more
expensive, and makes Japanese goods cheaper to U.S. buyers.
The company's biggest world-wide competitor is Komatsu Ltd.
of Tokyo.</p>
<p>Caterpillar said manufacturing costs will be higher than
anticipated through 1990, because of "slippage" in
implementing its extensive modernization program. While cost
reductions anticipated from the ongoing program will "still
be achieved," the point where such benefits exceed outlays
for the plan now won't come in the fourth quarter, as the
company had expected.</p>
<p>Caterpillar additionally said that it's experiencing
"short-lived" inefficiencies associated with a corporate
revamping announced in January. That plan, designed to make
the company more flexible, established a number of "profit
centers" in place of the vertical structure the company had
employed. But the company said adjusting to the new plan has
produced temporary "disruptive effects."</p>
<p>Caterpillar said all the programs under way, despite the
setbacks some have encountered, will "greatly enhance" its
long-term competitive posture, and added it will continue to
aggressively pursue their implementation.</p>
