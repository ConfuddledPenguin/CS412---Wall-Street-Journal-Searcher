	<p class="article-leader">Anglo-Dutch food manufacturer Unilever N.V. said it has
extended an offer to acquire the remaining 50% of Swedish
food manufacturer Margarinbolaget AB, that Unilever doesn't
already own.
   The offer is conditional on the approval of the
transaction by the Swedish government and would take place
sometime in January or February of 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the terms of the offer, Unilever said it would
increase the equity of Aritmos group of Sweden, which
currently holds the other 50% stake in Margarinbolaget, by
650 million kronor ($107 million). The transfer of the 50%
stake in Margarinbolaget to Unilever would allow Unilever to
expand its food manufacturing capabilities in Northern Europe
while giving Aritmos the equity to expand its sports and
leisure products business.</p>
<p>Margarinbolaget, which has annual sales of around $247
million, sells a range of brand name margarines, frying
products and dairy products.</p>
