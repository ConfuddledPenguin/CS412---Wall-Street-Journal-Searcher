	<p class="article-leader">Siebe PLC, a British engineering concern, won an auction
to buy Foxboro Co. for $656.4 million, but financial analysts
in London questioned whether the loss-ridden U.S. company is
worth the price.
   The Foxboro, Mass., manufacturer of valves and other
automatic process-control devices used in factories posted a
1989 net loss of $4.6 million. For Siebe, based in Windsor,
England, the acquisition would expand its U.S. operations and
fill in holes in its product lines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>News of the $52-a-share offer sent Foxboro's stock
soaring. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading
yesterday, the company's shares jumped 34%, rising $12.875 to
close at $51.</p>
<p>But the offer left London financial analysts and stock
traders scratching their heads. The bid represents a 75%
premium over Foxboro's share price on June 11, when the
company announced it was seeking a buyer. "It looks a wee bit
expensive," said analyst Andrew Chambers of Nomura Research
Institute. By industry yardsticks, he said, a $656.4 million
takeover price would normally be considered reasonable for a
company making about $50 million a year in pretax profits,
rather than one posting a net loss.</p>
<p>In London Stock Exchange trading, Siebe shares fell 25
pence to 505 pence ($8.75), a 4.7% drop.</p>
<p>E. Barrie Stephens, Siebe's chief executive and vice
chairman, called the stock market's sour response "a
traditional knee-jerk reaction" and defended the offer price.
"We offered what we felt the business was worth to us. I
haven't bought profits for my shareholders, I've bought
opportunity."</p>
<p>Mr. Stephens said Foxboro has important control technology
that Siebe lacks. Siebe's controls business, comprising 56%
of its #1.22 billion ($2.11 billion) revenue in the year
ended April 30, 1989, consists of devices for the automotive,
aerospace and construction industries, among others. In
contrast, many of Foxboro's products are specialized for the
chemical, paper, food and power-generation industries. Mr.
Stephens added that about $350 million of Foxboro's $598
million revenue in 1989 came from the U.S., meaning the
acquisition would greatly expand Siebe's U.S. operations.</p>
<p>Mr. Stephens said Foxboro's losses stemmed partly from
soluble problems with a new product range, and he predicted
that "we'll turn it around with (Foxboro managers') help very
quickly." Contrary to some London analysts' expectations, he
said he expects Foxboro to start contributing to Siebe's
profits this year. Siebe also will get some slight benefit
from Foxboro's U.S. tax credits, stemming from past losses,
that Siebe can spread out over several years to reduce its
own U.S. taxation.</p>
<p>Foxboro advisers conceded that by conventional financial
measures the price might appear high. "If you looked at what
(Foxboro) did in the past you wouldn't have paid this price,"
said William H. Strong, an official at New York investment
bank Salomon Brothers Inc., which advised Foxboro on the
auction. But he said that Siebe and competing bidders for
Foxboro were concentrating on the value of the company's
highly regarded technology. He said Foxboro's board
considered at least three firm bids for the company at a
meeting Friday, and Siebe's offer won only by an "extremely
small" margin. He declined to name the other bidders.</p>
<p>In the past few years, Siebe has grown to become one of
Britain's biggest engineering companies. Throughout the
1980s, a string of acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe helped
it post rapid earnings and revenue growth. Its biggest prior
U.S. acquisitions were of Robertshaw Controls Co. and Ranco
Inc. Many London analysts thought the prices Siebe paid were
too high, but their criticisms have turned to praise for the
improvements Siebe has made in those businesses.</p>
