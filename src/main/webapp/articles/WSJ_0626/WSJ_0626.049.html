	<p class="article-leader">FORT WORTH, Texas -- Tandy Corp. said its board approved
amendments to the company's shareholder rights plan that
would allow individual holders to purchase additional shares
at a reduced price if an individual investor accumulates 15%
of the company's stock.
   Previously, the plan could be triggered if an investor
acquired a 25% or greater stake without board approval. The
electronics retailer and manufacturer said the changes
weren't adopted in response to any specific effort to acquire
control of the company.</p>
