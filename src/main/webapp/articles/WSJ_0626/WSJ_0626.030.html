	<p class="article-leader">An investment partnership that Michael R. Milken has
admitted defrauding sued the former Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. junk bond chief seeking more than $6 million in damages.
   The suit, filed in federal district court in Manhattan by
Finsbury Group Ltd., is the first to result directly from Mr.
Milken's guilty plea. The investors in Finsbury, a
Drexel-organized partnership that invests in high-yield
securities, allege that they were defrauded by Mr. Milken
"through a series of artificially rigged securities
transactions."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Milken pleaded guilty to six felony counts in April
and agreed to pay $600 million in fines and restitution. Mr.
Milken admitted in one of those counts that he, along with
former fund manager David Solomon, repeatedly overcharged
Finsbury for millions of dollars of junk bonds sold to
Finsbury by Drexel between 1984 and 1986.</p>
<p>Mr. Milken admitted to overcharging Finsbury to recoup
certain expenses incurred by his Beverly Hills, Calif., junk
bond department in connection with the sale of Finsbury
shares. Mr. Milken also admitted concealing the illegal price
adjustments.</p>
<p>Finsbury claims that the fraudulent activities to which
Mr. Milken pleaded guilty cost the partners more than $2
million. Those damages, Finsbury said, include the payment of
unjustified fees of more than $1.5 million, direct losses of
more than "several hundred thousand dollars" and attorneys'
fees. Under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law, known as RICO, Finsbury is seeking triple
damages.</p>
<p>Besides Mr. Milken, the suit also names as defendants Mr.
Solomon and Solomon Asset Management Inc. Mr. Solomon became
a witness against Mr. Milken last year in exchange for a
grant of immunity from prosecution, and resigned from the
company he founded.</p>
<p>Mr. Solomon was once one of Mr. Milken's largest customers
and managed a high-yield portfolio for the Finsbury fund. Mr.
Solomon, who is believed to have provided the government with
information about Finsbury, had not been sued before for his
activities with Mr. Milken and Drexel.</p>
<p>Finsbury alleges in its suit that Mr. Milken conspired to
induce Mr. Solomon to cheat Finsbury by "promising and
providing Mr. Solomon and his company with other lucrative
deals, fraudulent tax losses and other illegal benefits in
the nature of money, kickbacks and gratuities." Mr. Milken
also has pleaded guilty to helping Mr. Solomon create
fraudulent tax losses.</p>
<p>Although Finsbury alleges that Drexel was "a knowing and
active participant in the criminal fraud scheme," Drexel
isn't being charged because it is currently operating under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code and is protected
from claims by creditors.</p>
<p>Andrew Levander, a New York attorney who is representing
Finsbury, wasn't available to comment yesterday. A spokesman
for Mr. Milken declined to comment on the suit.</p>
<p>Martin Auerbach, the New York attorney who is representing
Mr. Solomon, said: "We do not believe that Finsbury's
complaint accurately reflects events as they occurred.
However, we also do not believe that newspapers are the right
place to set the record straight."</p>

<p>SOUTHWESTERN BELL loses $15 million antitrust case
involving phone books.</p>
<p>A federal court jury in Amarillo, Texas, found that
Southwestern Bell Corp. illegally tried to monopolize
telephone directory advertising in parts of Texas and
Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Upholding claims that the St. Louis company violated
federal antitrust laws, the jury awarded the damages to two
independent telephone directory publishers, Great Western
Directories Inc., of Amarillo, and Canyon Directories Inc. in
nearby Canyon, Texas.</p>
<p>The ruling is a major boost for independent publishers,
who are engaged in an increasingly fierce battle with local
telephone companies for lucrative yellow-page advertising.
Independent telephone directory publishers proliferated after
the 1984 court decree breaking up the Bell system. But in
order to compete, they have to buy copyrighted white-page
telephone listings from local phone companies. Such listings
are needed because they are the most current, and because
they provide leads for selling ads in their own yellow pages.</p>
<p>"Independent publishers from across the country have
supported this case because their survival depends on their
ability to get directory listings at reasonable prices," says
Nancy Stone, an attorney in Amarillo for Garner, Stone &
Lovell, counsel for the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>Great Western and Canyon contended that Southwestern
violated the law by unreasonably raising the price it charged
for the listings, which include the names, addresses and
phone numbers of subscribers. In 1988, Canyon paid $300.70
for the right to copy 6,200 listings, the suit alleged, but
since then it has had to pay $5,000 annually. Great Western's
price per listing went from 30 cents to $1, the suit said.</p>
<p>In upholding the allegations, the jury awarded $5 million
to Great Western, which serves several cities in Texas and
Oklahoma, and $9,400 to Canyon, which serves its local
market. Under federal antitrust laws, the damages are
tripled.</p>
<p>Ms. Stone said the verdict "will cause a lot of other
telephone companies across the country to take a look at what
they're doing."</p>
<p>But a spokesman for Southwestern Bell sharply disagreed.
"We believe the jury's decision is absurd and we're confident
the decision will be overturned on appeal," said Gray
Kerrick, senior vice president, corporate communications.</p>

<p>NEW ALLEGATIONS are made in pollution suit against
Ashland.</p>
<p>As expected, lawyers representing plaintiffs in an
environmental suit against Ashland Oil Inc. amended their
complaint, alleging fraud and attempts to obstruct justice.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that a 1988 letter from Ashland
Chairman John R. Hall assuring residents that emissions from
a refinery in Catlettsburg, Ky., were harmless was false. The
complaint says Art Smith, an air pollution expert employed by
West Virginia, testified that if a person were to eat toxic
emissions from the plant, as the letter suggested they could
do safely, "they would need a stomach and esophagus
transplant."</p>
<p>Mr. Smith testified at a trial in May in which a $10.3
million verdict was rendered in favor of four people against
Ashland. The plaintiffs are part of 1,200 residents who have
other claims pending and are seeking more than $2 billion in
damages.</p>
<p>The amended complaint, filed in Kanawha County Circuit
Court, claims Ashland tried to obstruct justice by
distributing things of value in the county. For example, the
complaint alleges that Ashland gave "thousands of dollars in
cash awards" to teachers, gave cash to a festival commission
and a war memorial and maintained a booth to pass out
promotional items. The plaintiffs also claim that Ashland
formed, or caused to be formed, a group to launch an
offensive against the litigants. After the trial, some of
plaintiffs were threatened and harrassed, the complaint says.</p>
<p>Ashland officials couldn't immediately be reached. Earlier
the company asked the court to overturn the $10.3 million
verdict or to grant the company a new trial, alleging that
297 errors occurred during the trial.</p>

<p>ILLINOIS can't give up its lake bed, judge rules.</p>
<p>A federal judge blocked Loyola University from filling in
18.5 acres of Lake Michigan along the shoreline on Chicago's
North Side. U.S. District Judge Marvin E. Aspen, citing an
1892 ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court, said the state
couldn't give up its public trust over the lake bed of Lake
Michigan.</p>
<p>Upholding the claim of an environmental group, Judge Aspen
said the state's sale of 20 acres of lake bottom to Loyola
for $10,000 was "a transparent giveaway of public property to
a private entity."</p>
<p>The university began driving steel pilings at the site
last week and had already sunk $2 million on planning,
lobbying and construction commitments for its projected $6
million campus expansion. Jeffrey P. Smith, of Chicago's
Gottlieb & Schwartz, represented the Lake Michigan Federation
on a no-fee basis.</p>
<p>A Loyola spokesman said the university was "surprised and
dismayed" by the ruling but hadn't decided whether to appeal
the permanent injunction.</p>
