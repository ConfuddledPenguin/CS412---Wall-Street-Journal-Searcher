	<p class="article-leader">Conde Nast Publications Inc. said it acquired Cook's
magazine with the intent of folding the publication and
adding its subscriber base to its own upscale food monthly,
Gourmet.
   Cook's joins the growing list of magazines that are either
closing down or being folded into other magazines in an
increasingly difficult advertising climate. Cook's is
published by Pennington Publishing Inc., a unit of the
Stockholm-based Bonnier Group, one of the largest media
companies in Scandinavia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Financial terms weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>Cook's guaranteed to advertisers a circulation of about
225,000, but in the past year had failed in several issues to
meet that guarantee. At Cook's, close to 30 editorial and
sales staffers are expected to lose their jobs.</p>
<p>A glossy, sleekly designed magazine started in 1979,
Cook's targeted well-heeled readers who liked to cook their
own gourmet meals and entertain stylishly. However, Cook's
has been unable to compete effectively in a crowded field
that includes such upscale epicurean magazines as Gourmet,
Knapp Communication Corp.'s Bon Appetit, American Express
Publishing Corp.'s Food & Wine, and Telemedia Inc.'s Eating
Well.</p>
<p>The factors leading to Cook's demise, however, aren't
exclusive to the food magazine category. Cook's Publisher Bob
Young said that like other consumer magazines, Cook's profits
were squeezed by aggressive rate negotiating on the part of
advertising agencies and their clients during a general
advertising slump.</p>
<p>"Unlike past recessions in the magazine industry,
magazines are cutting whatever deal they can with
advertisers. Because of it, the revenues per page are
plummeting," said Mr. Young. "Even those magazines that are
on the crest are being pressured to offer deals."</p>
<p>Small to midsized national magazines have been hardest hit
by rate negotiation coupled with slashed advertisers' ad
budgets. Last week, after losing as much as $10 million,
Metrocorp closed down Manhattan, inc. and combined its staff
with Fairchild Publications' M magazine. Other recently
folded magazines include Stern Publications' 7 Days, Time
Warner Inc.'s Southpoint, and CMP Publications' Long Island
Monthly. Several publications, such as Family Media Inc.'s
Taxi and Model, and New American Magazine Co.'s Psychology
Today, have suspended publication for now with promises to
readers and advertisers of being relaunched.</p>
<p>"Our closing just reflects the tenor of the times," said
Cook's Mr. Young.</p>

<p>CONDE NAST PUBLICATIONS Inc. acquired the subscription
list of Cook's magazine, and not the magazine as reported in
yesterday's edition. Cook's publisher, Pennington Publishing
Inc., had previously decided to close the magazine after
efforts to find a buyer failed.</p>
