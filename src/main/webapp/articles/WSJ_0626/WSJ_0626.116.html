	<p class="article-leader">Dayton Hudson Corp., Minneapolis, said it plans to dismiss
about 850 central-office employees of Chicago-based Marshall
Field & Co. by the end of the year.
   Last week, Dayton Hudson completed its acquisition of the
upscale retailing chain from B.A.T Industries PLC of Britain
for $1.05 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Dayton Hudson said the move will slash the central-office
staff of Marshall Field by about half. The retailer said the
terminations don't include store employees or support staff.</p>
<p>Employees of Marshall Field were warned in April by Dayton
Hudson that it intended to consolidate much of the retailer's
Chicago office operations in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The Marshall Field staff that remains in Chicago will
handle matters such as customer service and community
relations.</p>
