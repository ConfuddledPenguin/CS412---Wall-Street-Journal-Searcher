	<p class="article-leader">THE SUPREME COURT RULED on notification for abortion and
the right to die.
   The justices, providing legislators another opening to
curtail abortion rights, ruled that states can require most
minors to notify at least one parent before obtaining an
abortion. However, the high court said mandating notification
of both parents may interfere with the constitutional right
to abortion. Separately, the court ruled 5-4 that states may
require clear proof that a patient in a vegetative state
wishes to die before allowing food and water tubes to be
disconnected.</p>

wishes, the ruling is likely to encourage greater use of
so-called living wills by individuals.</p>

South Africa.</p>
<p>The black nationalist leader, who met for three hours with

violence to free Pretoria from white-minority rule, but said
force wouldn't be used as long as the South African
government negotiates in good faith with the black majority.

against South Africa but said all sides in the anti-apartheid
struggle should renounce violence and repression.</p>

they could receive medical care abroad. Fang is said to have
a heart ailment.</p>

estimated half million people have been made homeless.</p>

control.</p>
