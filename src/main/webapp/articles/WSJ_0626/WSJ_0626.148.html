	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Koito Manufacturing Co. claimed it has evidence
that its largest shareholder, T. Boone Pickens Jr., is trying
to greenmail it. Mr. Pickens dismissed the accusation and
said he plans to buy more Koito stock.
   Through Texas-based Boone Co., Mr. Pickens has a 26% stake
in Koito. But the company has repeatedly rejected his demand
for representation on its board.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, it released a copy of what it said was Boone
Co.'s 1989 Franchise Tax Report to the state of Delaware,
which showed total gross assets of about $1.9 million as of
Dec. 31. Koito said that as of that same date, Boone Co. was
registered on Koito's books as the owner of 39.4 million of
the company's shares, with a market value at the time of
about $950 million.</p>
<p>Koito asserts that the difference between the two figures
reflects its contention that Boone Co. isn't the beneficial
owner of the shares and is acting as an agent for Kitaro
Watanabe, which Koito claims has tried to greenmail the
company before. A greenmailer tries to force a company to buy
back its shares at a price higher than the market price.</p>
<p>But Boone Co. officials released a copy of what they said
was an amended filing, showing assets of more than $916.6
million. They said that they made a mistake in their initial
filing, dated Feb. 21, by failing to include overseas
holdings in Koito, and that the amended filing reflects the
holdings.</p>
<p>"If they think they found a smoking gun, it just blew up
in their face," Mr. Pickens said in a statement. He didn't
say how many additional Koito shares he plans to buy, but he
insists he is a long-term investor, not a greenmailer.</p>
