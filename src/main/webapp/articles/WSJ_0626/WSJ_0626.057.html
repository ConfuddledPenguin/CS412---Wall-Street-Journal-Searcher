	<p class="article-leader">MILAN, Italy -- Italy's consumer prices in June are likely
to have risen about 5.6% from a year earlier, down slightly
from the 5.7% year-to-year increase in May, according to
provisional cost-of-living statistics from six major cities,
which usually reflect a nationwide trend.
   Local inflation indexes in June rose between 0.2% and 0.9%
from May and were up between 5.3% and 6.4% from a year
earlier. These figures followed monthly increases between
0.3% and 0.5% in May, when the year-to-year increases varied
from 5.2% to 6.5%. If the data are confirmed by the state,
inflation would be at its lowest level since December 1988,
when the consumer price index rose 5.5% from a year earlier.</p>
