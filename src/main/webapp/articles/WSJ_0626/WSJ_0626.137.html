	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Office of Thrift Supervision issued
rules spelling out how much thrifts can pay in dividends, a
move that OTS Director Timothy Ryan said was intended to make
thrifts more attractive to buyers and investors.
   Mr. Ryan also said he intends to issue a policy in the
next several days outlining when the OTS will disclose
administrative charges brought by the agency against thrift
executives. The decision could affect whether the thrift
office airs its case against Neil Bush, the president's son,
regarding his actions as a director of a failed Colorado
thrift.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the dividend policy, thrifts that currently meet
capital standards that are due to take effect in 1995 can pay
all their net income and half their surplus capital -- or
capital in excess of the 1995 requirements -- in dividends.
Thrifts that meet current capital standards but not the 1995
standard can pay dividends totaling 25% to 75% of their net,
depending on how close they are to the 1995 requirement.
Thrifts that fall below current capital requirements can't
pay dividends without specific approval from the OTS.</p>
<p>About 1,200 thrifts with $215 billion in assets, or 20% of
the industry's total assets, currently meet the 1995 capital
requirements. The new policy takes the place of a complicated
mix of regulations under which undercapitalized thrifts
generally weren't allowed to pay dividends. In the past,
applications by thrifts to pay dividends were often handled
on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan said the policy was intended to make it clear to
investors that they can get a return through dividends. "We
need to provide for thrifts to increase capital, but we also
need to provide some attractiveness to investors," he said.
"The value of the thrift charter is very much in question,"
he added, referring to the reluctance of investors to buy the
hundreds of insolvent thrifts the government is selling off.
Buyers of insolvent thrifts are required to bring them into
compliance with capital standards.</p>
<p>The OTS also said it plans this week to propose relaxing,
during a transitional period, limits on the size of loans
thrifts can make to an individual borrower. Last year's
thrift-bailout law limited loans to an individual borrower to
15% of the thrift's capital. Previously, the limit was 100%
of capital. The restriction has sparked controversy in the
real estate industry, where many say it has forced lenders to
turn down economically viable projects.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan also said he is working on a policy governing
when the OTS will announce administrative charges brought
against thrift executives. Currently, final judgments against
individuals are announced, but regulators don't announce
charges, for fear of the possible effects on a thrift. In the
case of failed thrifts, Mr. Ryan said, that wouldn't be a
consideration.</p>
<p>Some congressional Democrats have pushed for the OTS to
announce details of its conflict-of-interest charges against
Neil Bush, who was a director of Silverado Banking, Savings &
Loan Association in Denver. Mr. Bush has denied any
wrongdoing.</p>
