	<p class="article-leader">WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said it got approval from
the Food and Drug Administration to sell Ethmozine, a drug to
treat life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms.
   The diversified chemicals company has been developing
Ethmozine since the mid-1970s, when it licensed the drug from
a medical licensing agency of the Soviet Union. Du Pont
expects the drug to be commercially available in the U.S. in
September.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ethmozine, generically called moricizine, was approved for
use in patients with ventricular arrhythmias, a condition in
which the abnormal rhythm occurs in the main pumping sections
of the heart. An estimated 300,000 deaths in the U.S. are
caused by such arrhythmias every year.</p>
<p>John O'Rourke, the product manager, said that although
Ethmozine has been shown to reduce the incidence of these
arrhythmias, studies are still being done to determine
whether that reduction is directly related to longer
survival. Other factors, such as the pumping capacity of the
heart, make it difficult to trace this cause-and-effect
relationship, he said.</p>
<p>Some doctors who have worked with Ethmozine say it appears
safer than some other anti-arrhythmia drugs, which themselves
can induce heart problems in certain patients. Last year, for
example, U.S. health officials cautioned doctors against
using two other drugs for mild arrhythmias after more
patients taking them in a government-sponsored study died of
heart attacks than did patients taking a placebo. The
officials said the drugs -- Enkaid, made by Bristol-Myers
Co., and Tambocor, made by the Riker Laboratories Inc. unit
of Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co. -- should be reserved
for patients suffering from life-threatening arrhythmias.</p>
<p>Mr. O'Rourke estimated U.S. sales of drugs in Ethmozine's
category at $280 million a year.</p>
