	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Oil spilled from a tanker-barge crash began to
threaten shellfish and wildlife in Texas's Galveston Bay and
blocked the busy Houston Ship Channel to most traffic for a
third day. A few vessels were allowed through last night on a
sharply limited basis.
   A collision Saturday between a double-hulled tanker and
two barges originally laden with 1.7 million gallons of
partially refined crude triggered the spill. Initially, Coast
Guard officials estimated that only about 50,000 gallons of
oil from the barges went into the bay, but they have since
raised that to some 500,000 gallons, making the incident a
"major" spill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>So far, the cost of fighting the spill is being borne by
the owner of the barges, APEX Towing Co., a division of APEX
Oil Co. of St. Louis. While that is the usual practice, in
some recent major U.S. spills, the cargo owner has eventually
ended up footing some of the bill. Phibro Energy Inc., a
Greenwich, Conn., subsidiary of Salomon Inc., owns the cargo
here. A company official said Phibro isn't yet paying any of
the costs.</p>
<p>One of the damaged barges was emptied by Monday after
spilling about 48,000 gallons. But the other sank and remains
stuck on the edge where the shallow bay meets the
40-foot-deep ship channel. Its stern sits on the channel
bottom and only its bow is above water. That barge has "holes
in all three holds," said U.S. Coast Guard Petty Officer Gene
Maestas. "If it slips into the channel, all that oil's loose
and it goes where it pleases." The barge, which originally
held about 700,000 gallons, "might even float down the
channel," he said.</p>
<p>Salvage workers stopped most of the flow from the
submerged barge yesterday evening and were concentrating on
pumping to another vessel what was left aboard. The tanker's
outer hull was pierced in the crash, but no oil was lost from
that ship, the Coast Guard said. Last night, a 17-mile slick
was moving on the bay.</p>
<p>At the temporarily closed Port of Houston, 26 ships
yesterday waited to get out while 34 in the bay waited to
come in, said spokesman Lee Vela. The port is the world's
sixth busiest, with more than 80% of its volume related to
giant oil and petrochemical complexes here. Late yesterday,
the ship channel was opened only to inbound barges escorted
by a second tugboat and moving in single file. Ocean-going
vessels were still barred. Officials wouldn't estimate when
the channel might fully reopen.</p>
<p>Local maritime shipping experts estimate the closing is
costing the owners of the idled ships $1 million to $1.5
million a day. During the day, three general cargo ships
switched to the Port of Galveston, and "we're talking with a
number" of representatives of others, said Galveston port
director Doug Marchand.</p>
<p>The cause of the crash remains under investigation. "We've
got a fairly good safety record, but we've got a very narrow
channel. There are a number of fender-bender type accidents
on the channel every year," said Mr. Vela, the Houston port
spokesman. A project that would widen the ship channel to 530
feet and deepen it to 45 feet is awaiting congressional
funding, he said. "That extra 130 feet for ships to pass is
extremely important."</p>
<p>Some groups are already calling the spill a "calamity."
The type of oil spilled is particularly thick and gooey and
"environmentally persistent," according to the Coast Guard.
"All of the birds that live and breathe and eat along the
coast are threatened," especially several endangered
shore-bird species now migrating through Texas, said Gary
Clark, president of the Houston Audubon Society. Others cited
two protected species in particular: piping plovers and brown
pelicans.</p>
<p>David Hankla, a U.S. Fish and Wildlfe Service field
supervisor, said he has "scattered reports of oiled birds,"
but he called the problem "minimal at this time."</p>
<p>Mr. Clark of the Audubon Society said some oil is already
leaking into marshlands. "That's {the birds'} grocery store,"
he said. He also said oyster beds "could be wiped out for
several seasons; no doubt about it." The Texas Department of
Health stopped shrimping and oyster-gathering in some parts
of Galveston Bay, one of the nation's most-productive
estuaries.</p>
<p>The spill, the second major oil-vessel accident here in
two months, angered some local groups, who charge the Coast
Guard was slow to respond on the weekend. "Next to nothing
was happening 28 hours after the spill," alleged Linda Shead,
executive director of the private Galveston Bay Foundation.
"The potential for catastrophe has been there, and we have
squeaked by, but this time it doesn't look like we're going
to squeak by," she said. In June, a huge tanker burned for
days some 50 miles off Galveston, though a major spill was
eventually averted. That case also generated charges of
unpreparedness against government agencies.</p>
<p>Gary Stone, spokesman for Galveston's Emergency Operations
Center, defended the Coast Guard. "No matter how fast they
respond, somebody's going to say they could have done it
faster," he said. He maintained that an industry-funded
response team is needed on the Gulf Coast to coordinate
activities in the event of an oil spill.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what the Coast Guard called "mystery oil"
washed up on two Galveston Island beaches and is being
studied to determine its origin. There has been public
speculation that it may have been illegally dumped by a
passing vessel seeking to use the spill as a cover. "We could
not figure out how oil from the barge accident got around and
hit the beach on the gulf side," said Petty Officer Maestas.
"At that time, our calculations figured that was impossible."</p>
