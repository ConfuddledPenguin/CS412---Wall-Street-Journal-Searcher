	<p class="article-leader">We don't imagine there's too much weeping in the land for
the summary justice meted out by Baseball Commissioner Fay
Vincent to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. However, the
support for Mr. Vincent's decision to deprive Mr.
Steinbrenner of his majority ownership in the team seems to
have little connection to the issue at hand -- the Yankee
owner's dealings with a reputed gambler. Instead, the fans
appear to feel that George is being "sentenced" with exile
for the crime of turning the team into a 17-year-long soap
opera. If the world of politics was as closed and private as
baseball, Mr. Vincent would now go to Capitol Hill to
investigate and ban from public life the perpetrators of the
S&L mess.</p>
