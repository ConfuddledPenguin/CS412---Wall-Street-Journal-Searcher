   Busy Fingers a Rest</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>TIRED fingers? Several companies offer gadgets that dial
the telephone for you.</p>
<p>The gizmos are the latest twist on computerized "personal
organizers." In addition to storing names, addresses and
phone numbers, the machines can generate the Touch-Tone
noises understood by most phones. By holding such a device up
to a phone's mouthpiece and pressing a single button, users
dial the number they see on its liquid-crystal display.</p>
<p>Until lately, electronic dialers were simple devices that
enabled users of rotary phones to generate Touch-Tone
commands to their answering machines, for example. Adding
this dialing capability to the new electronic organizers
"seemed like a natural extension to both products," says
Melissa Stoll of Texas Instruments, which makes two dialers.</p>
<p>TI says its Pro Dialer should appeal to business travelers
because it dials chains of numbers -- a boon to anyone who
must make long-distance calls by dialing an access number . .
. then the desired phone number . . . then a credit-card
number. It also sports a clock that beeps to remind its owner
of appointments.</p>
<p>Sharp Electronics' Dial Master 450 offers a secret code to
protect sensitive phone numbers and a "remark" key that
allows users to add brief comments to each phone listing.
Casio's Quick Dialer 700 keeps track of the time in 26
cities, while the Auradex EZ200, from Aurora Impex, prints
mailing labels. The machines list from $50 to $300, depending
on function.</p>
<p>As yet, no truly high-powered electronic organizer -- one
that swaps data with personal computers -- can also dial. But
Sharp's Andrew Simon says the firm's Wizard product may add
the capability in a future version.</p>
<p>X-Ray `Fax' Machines</p>
<p>Aid Small-Town Hospitals
</p>
<p>FOR CASH-STRAPPED hospitals, a radiologist is no longer
out of reach.</p>
<p>Many small-town hospitals have their own X-ray machines,
but must either share or do without a radiologist, the
specialist who interprets X-rays. While they save the
doctor's $200,000 salary, they often may wait a day or more
while X-ray film is shuttled to another location for
diagnosis.</p>
<p>Now Discovery System, Overland Park, Kan., has come up
with a way to transmit complex X-ray images over regular
phone lines without losing the detail necessary to diagnose
pneumonia, fractures and other common ailments. Its FilmFAX
system isn't a facsimile machine, but a $70,000 combination
of scanners, data compressors, modems and laser output
devices. It can etch images on film or display them on a
video screen. X-ray technicians can use it to send an image
to another hospital in 70 seconds, allowing a radiologist to
phone in a diagnosis in minutes.</p>
<p>At York Hospital in York, Pa., radiologist D. Randy Tabb
uses FilmFAX to diagnose patients whose conditions might
require immediate treatment in the hospital's small outpost
in Shrewsbury, 15 miles away. In four months of use, only two
diagnoses have been revised when compared with actual film, a
far better performance than is possible with systems that use
video cameras to transmit X-ray images, he says.</p>
<p>Video-based systems, such as those made by Image Data,
Irvine, Calif., and Advanced Video Products, Concord, Mass.,
focus mainly on CT-scan and MR-scan images, which contain
much less detail than X-rays.</p>
<p>Whetting User Appetites</p>
<p>With Trial Programs</p>
<p>SOFTWARE companies are offering customers new ways to
test-drive -- and fall in love with -- their products.</p>
<p>Faced with increasingly leery buyers, more firms
distribute "demo disks," computer programs that give a feel
for a new product but don't let users perform key functions.
Others offer flashy videos showing their product in action,
while still others mail fully functional software "for trial
only."</p>
<p>The latest marketing twist comes from a hardware firm, of
all places. Sun Microsystems is distributing an optical disk
that demonstrates the range of business software -- none from
Sun -- that can run on its workstations. The company wants to
convince people that its machines are as versatile and useful
as PCs.</p>
<p>Sun says future versions will include real programs that
can be tried out, then fully activated by calling the
software company and getting a password -- after paying for
the product. Ultimately, Sun hopes to ship a few disks with
every workstation, allowing users to buy as much software as
they want without leaving their desks.</p>
<p>"This is a definite trend in software distribution," says
Gail Bower of KnowledgeSet, which has a demo program on Sun's
current disk. "You wouldn't buy a car without sitting in it
and seeing how it drives. Now there may even be a way to
drive that car right off the lot."</p>
<p>The development could spell good news for Drew Logan, a
Pennsylvanian who has applied for a patent on a new way to
protect software from copying. His method also requires users
to call the software company for a secret code, a step that
users had never been asked to take before. Still, says Ron
Palenski of Adapso, an industry group: "It's my sense that
copy protection is and will remain a dead issue for
mass-distributed business software."</p>
<p>Odds & Ends</p>
<p>SELECTRONICS announced a hand-held electronic version of
Physicians' Desk Reference, a standard source of information
on drugs. . . . International Business Machines devised a
process that allows circuit wires to "heal" certain defects
by themselves. Technicians don't even need to know where the
glitches are.</p>
