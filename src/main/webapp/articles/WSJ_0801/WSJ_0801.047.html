	<p class="article-leader">ELMSFORD, N.Y. -- Clinical Technologies Associates Inc.
said its board in a 3-2 vote decided to dismiss Solomon S.
Steiner as president and chief executive officer.
   The board named Michael M. Goldberg to the top operating
posts and offered Mr. Steiner, 52 years old, who founded the
company in 1985, the option of retaining his board seat and
running the clinical division. Mr. Steiner rejected the
offer, and indicated that he might take legal action.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Clinical Technologies is developing a method by which
drugs that can be administered only by injection -- such as
insulin for diabetics -- can be taken orally.</p>
<p>"The company has come to the point where it must expand..
.and improve its financing," said Arnold J. Friedhoff, the
66-year-old chairman. "We have substantial new research
facilities and ventures. And we felt that (Mr.) Steiner could
help by running the clinical division and (Dr.) Goldberg
could best serve the company by becoming president and chief
executive."</p>
<p>Dr. Goldberg, 31, is founding partner of Montaur Capital
Corp., a New York investment banking firm specializing in
healthcare companies.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Clinical
Technologies shares were quoted at $12.625 bid, up 12.5
cents.</p>
