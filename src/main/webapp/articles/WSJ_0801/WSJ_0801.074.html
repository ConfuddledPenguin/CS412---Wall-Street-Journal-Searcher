	<p class="article-leader">Pity Washington's poor budget summiteers. While they're
stuck debating how much more to tax a six-pack of Budweiser,
their fraternity brothers in Congress are throwing the
biggest party of the summer.
   Despite all the wailing about the "deficit," the spending
taps on Capitol Hill are wide open. The campus police (they
of the "no new tax" pledge) are nowhere in sight, so the
revelers have abandoned all self-restraint. There hasn't been
anything quite like this since John Belushi screamed "toga"
at Faber College. The Bush Administration seems not to want
to spoil the fun by pointing any fingers. Hapless taxpayers
are left asking where all the money went.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since George Bush put "tax revenue increases" on the table
last month, the House of Representatives has passed eight
appropriations bills worth $403.1 billion. That's about $41
billion or 11.4% more than last year, more than double the
inflation rate. The Housing and Veterans bill came in at a
whopping 17% over a year ago, apparently meant as a tribute
to the HUD scandal. The farm bill is rolling in at a record
$54 billion, while a Ways and Means subcommittee has created
a new $4.5 billion foster-care entitlement. Dan Rostenkowski
may curse the deficit, but don't say he doesn't know how to
have a good time.</p>
<p>The farm bill captures the let's-get-busy nature of the
revels. In the House, a rare liberal-conservative coalition
tried to remove the worst subsidies, but "we got waxed,"
reports New York Democrat Tom Downey. Even an amendment to
deny crop subsidies to farmers earning more than $100,000
went down to defeat, though it would have saved $700 million
a year. In the Senate, a bipartisan attempt to trim the
ridiculous sugar subsidy by a mere two cents a pound (to 16
cents) also was routed.</p>
<p>The only Members not enjoying the party are the nerds
trying to resist the peer pressure. After Illinois Republican
Harris Fawell voted to cut back one spending bill by a measly
2%, House appropriators denied a $17 million grant to Argonne
Laboratory in Mr. Fawell's district. Everyone else got the
message.</p>
<p>Minnesota Democrat Tim Penny's proposal to cut each
appropriation bill by 2% lost all but once, much like earlier
efforts to cut by 10% and then 5%. Cheeky Republican Bob
Walker of Pennsylvania then moved to cut spending by
.0000000002%, or $19.90, but he lost too]</p>
<p>What are the Members protecting? The Heritage Foundation's
Scott Hodge has compiled a list that reads like logrolling in
our time: $2.85 million for a fish farm in Stuttgart, Ark.;
$8 million for the U.S. Institute of Peace; $100,000 for an
Army Corps of Engineers investigation of Waikiki Beach (every
fraternity brother's dream); $8.5 million for a
high-occupancy-vehicle traffic demonstration project in
Virginia; and $50,000 for the national bicycle program
manager. And so on.</p>
<p>About the only thing on the chopping block is defense,
with the exception of domestic military bases the Pentagon
doesn't want. The Stealth bomber has to go, but Democrat Gene
Taylor is holding onto his district's Mississippi Army
ammunition plant, just in case someone (say a GOP candidate)
invades the Gulf Coast. A "base closing bill" sponsored by
Democratic Reps. Les Aspin and Pat Schroeder is rigged with
enough bureaucratic tripwires to prevent most bases from ever
closing.</p>
<p>We could go on, but suffice it to say that this is the
crowd President Bush wants to reach a budget "agreement"
with. The talks are stalled, so the latest line is that the
fault lies "within the White House." Reportedly, John Sununu
and Dick Darman are at odds, as if the President doesn't make
up his own mind.</p>
<p>But even if he can agree with Tom Foley and George
Mitchell, how will George Bush enforce anything with the rest
of Congress? Whom can he count on? Senate Appropriations
Chairman Robert Byrd? Not likely, since Mr. Byrd is privately
boasting that as long as he's in the Senate George Bush will
never get a line-item veto or enhanced rescission.</p>
<p>Short of these or other institutional reforms, the only
fiscal discipline in town was "no new taxes." While Congress
still spent into deficit, even it could only go so far. With
that discipline now lifted, Congress is back to its
bacchanal. Mr. Bush has played his best card, but Congress
has yet to put a single spending cut or budget reform on the
table. No wonder the Members are in a mood to party.</p>
