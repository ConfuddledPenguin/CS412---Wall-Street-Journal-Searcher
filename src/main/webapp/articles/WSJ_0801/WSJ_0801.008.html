	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Lincoln Center rarely is a serious place
during the summer. This year, for instance, audiences can
smile away hot city nights with vast amounts of serene,
blissed-out Mozart, with flashy balletic spectacle courtesy
of companies from Moscow and Sydney, with pleasantly operatic
Sondheim, or with cheerful, nostalgic jazz. Afterward, there
is dancing to alfresco salsa in the plaza.
   But somehow a chubby "percussionist" whose singing
resembles the sounds made by a strangling chicken has found
his way into the midst of Lincoln Center's lite summer fare,
as has an unsettling new opera about Charles Manson and even
the dread Karen Finley, the controversial performance artist
who recently ran afoul of the National Endowment for the
Arts. Indeed, just walk into Alice Tully Hall, the most
intimate of Lincoln Center's four main stages. The
institutionally dull lobby has turned festive, thanks to a
visually raucous exhibit of flamboyant and whimsical artworks
by performance artists.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All of this is part of "Serious Fun]" -- an attempt to
reach out to the kind of young, curious, arty audiences that
regularly flock to the venturesome Brooklyn Academy of Music
but almost never to the nation's pre-eminent center for the
performing arts. It did so initially by inviting such
well-known trendy figures as Philip Glass and Laurie
Anderson, while also offering a sampling of some of the
better (or at least more professional) "downtown" dance,
performance art and music. But now in its fourth summer,
"Serious Fun]" has become more daring, more original and . .
. more serious.</p>
<p>It still features big names to draw audiences. Ann
Magnuson, the former downtown performance artist and now
television personality, opened this year's installment with a
polished and entertaining one-woman show in the Lily Tomlin
mold. The showcase programs, such as the annual Megadance
event, which concludes this year's festival today and
tomorrow with new works it has commissioned from eight young
choreographers, are as useful as ever for offering an
overview of the avant-garde scene. And it has continued to
keep the door open for the untalented likes of the
caterwauling David Moss, the above-mentioned "percussionist,"
lest anyone accuse all downtown art of becoming smugly
commercial.</p>
<p>But "Serious Fun]" also has increasingly undertaken to
produce new and potentially important work, but this year's
major undertaking, John Moran's "The Manson Family," was a
lot more serious than fun. Mr. Moran, who is 25 years old,
came to attention last year with his quirky hour-long chamber
opera, "Jack Benny]" in which skits from the comedian's
television show were turned into amusingly surrealist music
theater.</p>
<p>With "The Manson Family," Mr. Moran further pursues his
mythologizing of popular culture, and particularly
television. He originally had titled the opera "Helter
Five-O," and had planned to meld the story of the notorious
cult murder with the once-popular detective show, "Hawaii
Five-O," until CBS lawyers got wind of it, and claimed
copyright protection of the show's title and characters. So
Mr. Moran changed some names, but he nevertheless replaced
Vincent Bugliosi, the Manson prosecutor, with a Hawaiian
detective.</p>
<p>Ultimately "The Manson Family" failed in nearly every way
that "Jack Benny]" had succeeded. While "Jack Benny]"
replaced traditional singing with an electronically altered
version of the TV show's soundtrack, the Manson saga was
mostly just acted, with occasional, incompetent singing. At
its most powerful moments, Mr. Moran's score for piano, viola
and electronics had a dramatically compelling kineticism, but
mostly it was background. Mr. Moran's trick of having actors
repeating action and text over and over -- so striking in
"Jack Benny]" seemed stale and gimmicky here.</p>
<p>But mainly Mr. Moran seemed out of his depth, as he
vacillated between treating Mr. Manson as an idealized
charismatic visionary or as the creep that he really is. His
musical ideas are interesting but not yet strong enough to
propel so charged a subject, and it was up to the finely
acted production by the Ridge Theater to carry him along
through most of the 75 minutes. But Mr. Moran is young, and
he is likely to outgrow some of his cheap theatrics, as Ms.
Finley surely has.</p>
<p>Ms. Finley may have a reputation for once exploiting
shocking vulgarity on stage, but "We Keep Our Victims Ready"
proved a performance piece of surprising eloquence and power.
This is the work for which she has become notorious -- since
it involves smearing chocolate on her partially nude body. In
fact, Ms. Finley was topless for only a minute or two (more
nudity has been seen at the New York City Opera), and that
proved the least effective part of her piece anyway.</p>
<p>Ms. Finley's real talent is in her ability to go from her
slightly awkward and silly normal stage self into a
trancelike state, intoning her text like a vibrant Southern
preacher as she enters inside the feelings of society's
woebegone -- battered women or homosexuals with AIDS. It is a
style of incantation that comes impressively close to music.
Many in the large audience had been drawn to Ms. Finley's
performance simply because of her newsworthiness. I was one
of those, having found her earlier work too overbearing for
my taste, but by the end of the performance the crowd stood
and cheered with fervor. It was an honestly won victory for
Ms. Finley. And it was a victory of sorts for "Serious Fun]"
as well.</p>
<p>The festival presents its share of benign artists who fit
right in with Lincoln Center's summertime philosophy. This
year there have been the likes of Michael Moschen, a
pretentious new-age juggler who aspires to dance but doesn't
come close, and the conventional standup comedy and pitiable
singing of Harry Shearer. But the series producer, Jedidiah
Wheeler, must fight hard to convince an increasingly nervous
Lincoln Center to allow challenging artists on its
prestigious stage, especially given these touchy times for
public arts funding.</p>
<p>Yet brave and undaunted, "Serious Fun]" risked even
grossing out its open-minded audience with the brilliant but
disturbing Italian clown, Leo Bassi, who juggled a piano with
his feet. Then, as a shocking impromptu encore, he pretended
to eat excrement -- even this he did with a weird kind of
flair. Whether most people would take this as Mr. Bassi
intended, as a representation of doing the ultimately
distasteful for freedom of expression, he certainly tested
ordinary notions of what is serious and what is fun.</p>
