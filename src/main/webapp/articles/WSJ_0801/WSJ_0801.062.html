	<p class="article-leader">Ford Motor Co., in its second major divestiture move in a
week, said it will sell its New Holland farm equipment
subsidiary to a joint venture headed by Fiat S.p.A. of Italy.
   The agreement, announced yesterday, calls for Fiat and
Ford to merge their tractor, farm and industrial equipment
businesses into a new company that will be 80%-owned by Fiat.
Terms were not disclosed, but analysts said Ford is likely to
receive more than the $330 million that it paid for the New
Holland operations in 1987.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The New Holland deal, in the works since spring, comes
just a week after Ford announced it will sell its aerospace
operations to Loral Corp. The two sales mark an about-face
for Ford, which acquired New Holland three years ago as part
of an aggressive diversification strategy.</p>
<p>But earlier this year, Ford decided to pare its operations
to automotive and financial services. The New Holland
agreement virtually completes Ford's divestiture program, and
will give the auto maker additional cash to help finance a
big capital spending push in its auto operations.</p>
<p>For Fiat, the Milan auto and industrial products maker,
the New Holland acquisition positions it to become one of the
three biggest farm equipment makers in the world.</p>
<p>Fiat will pay Ford an undisclosed amount of cash and will
also have an option to buy Ford's remaining 20% stake in New
Holland within four years. Ford officials said they expect
Fiat to exercise that option.</p>
<p>Ford is looking to bolster its cash reserves to finance
heavy investments in its automotive business. The No. 2 auto
maker boosted its capital spending during the first half of
this year to $3.3 billion, up 26% from a year ago. Much of
that money is being spent for new engines and transmissions,
and on the recent acquisition of Jaguar PLC.</p>
<p>Ford and Fiat said yesterday they are continuing separate
talks related to a possible joint venture involving
commercial trucks.</p>
<p>As part of yesterday's agreement, Fiat will get a Ford New
Holland diesel engine plant at Basildon, England, which
currently produces 65,000 truck and tractor engines a year,
and has a capacity of more than 100,000 engines a year. Fiat
said it had sought additional engine-making capacity in the
separate truck negotiations with Ford.</p>
<p>The link-up marks a giant step forward for Fiat in the
buoyant U.S. tractor market, where its annual sales of 1,500
tractors, barely 1% of the market, compare with Ford New
Holland's 26,500, a 22% market share. The combined sales will
make the new company one of the big three U.S. suppliers,
along with Deere & Co. and the JI Case unit of Tenneco Inc.</p>
<p>Fiat currently builds farm implements in the U.S. in joint
ventures with Case, and builds industrial machinery in a
European joint venture with Deere. Fiat doesn't expect those
to change.</p>
<p>"We have reason to believe that our existing joint
ventures can co-exist with this agreement," a Fiat spokesman
said.</p>
<p>The new company will combine Fiat's farm and construction
machinery subsidiary FiatGeotech with Ford's New Holland
agricultural-equipment division. The units will retain their
separate market and product identities.</p>
<p>Last year, New Holland and FiatGeotech had combined sales
of 95,000 tractors and a further 30,000 tractors produced in
joint ventures or under license. Sales of other agricultural
and industrial products totalled 54,000 units.</p>
<p>Ford New Holland, with revenue of $2.8 billion last year
and close to 18,000 employees, is slightly larger than
FiatGeotech, which had sales of $2.3 billion and 13,000
employees. FiatGeotech has plants in Italy, Brazil, France
and the U.S., while the Ford unit, based in New Holland, Pa.
has plants and offices in the U.S., Canada, Britain, Belgium
and Brazil.</p>
<p>Fiat officials said FiatGeotech and Ford New Holland had
complementary markets. While Fiat is the market leader in
Europe for tractors, with close to 16%, or 33,500 tractors,
much of its strength is in Italy, where it accounts for 38%
of the market. Ford New Holland has 9% of the European
market, equivalent to 16,500 tractors.</p>
<p>Fiat said it will name the management and the headquarters
location for the joint venture after the transaction is
finalized. Ford officials said they were uncertain how long
it would take to reach a definitive agreement and to obtain
governmental approvals.</p>
<p>The merger isn't the first time that Ford and Fiat have
sought to work together. In the mid-1980s, talks on combining
their car operations in Europe took place but ultimately led
nowhere. However, for the past four years the two companies
have successfully run a heavy-truck joint venture in Britain.</p>

<p>FIAT S.p.A. is based in Turin, Italy. In yesterday's
edition, the location of the Italian automobile and
industrial products maker's headquarters was misidentified.</p>
