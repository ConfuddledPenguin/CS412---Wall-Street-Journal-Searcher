	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Bond prices ended narrowly mixed in quiet
trading after contradictory economic reports caused prices to
meander throughout the day.
   In early trading, a mild bout of selling was inspired by a
stronger-than-expected home sales report. The Department of
Commerce reported that sales of new single-family houses rose
8.0% in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 581,000.
June's increase followed a revised 2.3% rise in the previous
month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 538,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There was a little bit of weakness after the new-home
sales report," said Stephen Slifer, economist at Shearson
Lehman Government Securities. "But people looked at the
numbers again and they seemed to be a bit fictitious." Mr.
Slifer suspects the data overstated the number of homes sold
in the Northeast.</p>
<p>Bond prices later rebounded as investors and analysts
turned their attention to the Chicago regional index of
business conditions, which revealed a growing weakness in the
industrial sector.</p>
<p>The Chicago index declined to 48.3% in July on an
unadjusted basis from an unrevised 53.3% in June. A showing
below 50% suggests that the manufacturing sector is
contracting, while a showing above 50% suggests that the
economy is expanding.</p>
<p>"My sense is you would put more weight on the Chicago
Purchasing Management index," than on the home sales report,
said David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones said the Chicago survey "correlates pretty well,
in direction at least," with recent trends in the National
Association of Purchasing Management national index. The NAPM
national index for July will be released at 10 a.m. today.</p>
<p>At the end of yesterday's session, prices for the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond were quoted 1/16 point
lower while prices for two-year Treasury notes were 1/8 point
higher. One point is equivalent to $10 in the price of a bond
with a $1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>In the corporate bond market, three major corporations
tapped the market for a total of $600 million. Most of the
proceeds from yesterday's offerings will go to refinance
existing short-term debt, a trend that has taken off in
recent weeks as interest rates have declined.</p>
<p>Sears, Roebuck & Co., the Chicago-based retailer, was the
biggest issuer of the day with an offering of $300 million of
seven-year notes through Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Dean Witter
Reynolds. The noncallable notes were priced to yield 9.272%.</p>
<p>Desmond Wong, corporate finance director at Sears, said
the company had been tracking Treasury rates in the
seven-year to 10-year sector for several weeks.</p>
<p>When yields on the seven-year Treasury note dropped to
8.31% on Monday, Mr. Wong said the company decided "to move
quickly" and take advantage of the lower borrowing costs.</p>
<p>Strong investor demand enabled the company to boost the
offering from an originally planned $250 million. Bond
traders said the retailer was able to increase the size of
its offering because investors considered the yields on the
seven-year notes, which are nearly one percentage point
higher than yields on seven-year Treasury notes, very
attractive. The spread, or gap, between yields on Sears debt
and comparable paper have been widened in recent months
because the giant retailer has been hit with a credit rating
downgrade and weak earnings.</p>
<p>Mr. Wong said that while the spread may be considered
wide, the company was able to lock in considerable savings as
a result of the decline in rates.</p>
<p>Other offerings yesterday included American Express Credit
Corp., a unit of American Express Co., which sold $200
million of four-year notes that were priced to yield 8.73%
and Kimberly-Clark Corp. which sold $100 million of 10-year
notes yielding 9.055%.</p>
<p>Although new-issue activity has been somewhat brisk
lately, new issue volume for the month of July was sharply
lower than the same period a year ago. According to IDD
Information Services, a securities-research concern, debt
financings fell 25% to $15.4 billion in July from $20.4
billion in July 1989. But corporate-bond issuance during the
January-to-July period rose 7.3%, IDD said.</p>
<p>In trading, most investment-grade corporate bonds ended
unchanged to slightly lower.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 103 19/32
to yield 8.41%. The price was down from 103 20/32 to yield
8.40% on Monday. Two-year notes ended at a price of 100 7/32
to yield 7.86% compared with 100 3/32 to yield 7.93% on
Monday.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were lower. The discount rate on
three-month Treasury bills eased to 7.49% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.72% while the rate for six-month
bills ended at 7.32% for a yield of 7.69%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Prices of mortgage securities finished slightly lower.</p>
<p>While the secondary market was lifeless, the primary
market saw some action with pricing announcements on three
real estate mortgage investment conduit securities deals
totaling $900 million.</p>
<p>A $300 million issue of Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
Remic securities is being offered by UBS Securities, a unit
of Union Bank of Switzerland. The offering is collateralized
with Freddie Mac 9.5% mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>And pricing details of two Federal National Mortgage
Association Remics were unveiled.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch Capital Markets is underwriting a $300
million Fannie Mae Remic issue, backed by Fannie Mae 9%
mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>The other issue, underwritten by J.P. Morgan Securities,
is also a $300 million Remic collateralized with 9%
mortgage-backed Fannie Maes.</p>
<p>In the secondary market, 9.5% pass-through securities for
August delivery issued by the Government National Mortgage
Association, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae were down 5/32 at 100
3/8, 99 5/8 and 100 1/8, respectively.</p>
<p>In the market for whole loan securities, there is talk
that a bid list of just under $1 billion is being circulated
by the Resolution Trust Corp., which is expected to be a
persistent heavy seller in coming months as the thrift
bailout proceeds. The RTC is the federal agency managing the
sale of assets from failed thrifts.</p>
<p>Whole loans are home mortgages that haven't been packaged
into mortgage securities because they're typically too large
to meet purchasing requirements of the three federal
agencies.</p>
<p>It is expected that the bid list will be readily absorbed
by the market and used in part as collateral for some Remic
deals.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>In the junk-bond market, high-yield bonds, or
speculative-grade bonds with low credit ratings or no credit
ratings at all, closed with declines of 1/8 to 1/4 point,
despite a sell-off in the stock market.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which started crumbling
on fears that the employee buy-out offer for UAL Corp. might
collapse, finished down 12.12 at 2905.20.</p>
<p>"I was waiting for UAL and the stock market to take the
junk-bond market down," said one high-yield trader. "But
although the junk-bond market is not up," there weren't major
losses either, he said.</p>
<p>Among big losers: R.H. Macy & Co.'s 14.5% subordinated
debentures, which shed 1 1/2 points to close at 61.</p>
<p>Among big winners: Santa Fe Pacific Corp. bonds, which
climbed higher on news that the company plans to refinance
$780 million of its 16% senior subordinated debentures. The
refinancing involves exchanging $200 million of debentures
for Santa Fe common stock and redeeming the remainder.</p>
<p>Santa Fe's 16% senior subordinated debentures ended the
day up 7/8 point at 110 5/8 point.</p>
<p>Since the bonds are pay-in-kind bonds that pay interest in
the form of additional bonds instead of cash, their price
reflects accrued interest, which totals nearly seven points,
traders said.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Japanese government bonds snapped out of a three-day
losing streak to post modest gains yesterday. But traders
said the market's mood remains bearish.</p>
<p>The rebound was triggered by the yen, which rose against
the U.S. dollar. The dollar ended at 147.50 yen in Tokyo,
down from 148.60 yen in Tokyo on Monday.</p>
<p>Traders said there was active buying on the part of
dealers who were rushing to cover short-sale positions, which
contributed to the markets rebound. In a short sale,
professional traders sell borrowed securities and later seek
to make a profit by replacing what was borrowed with cheaper
securities.</p>
<p>At the 3 p.m. JST close of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the
price of Japan's benchmark No. 119 10-year bond was 85.30, up
0.27 point, to yield 7.57%. (When calculated using the
semiannual compound method, the yield on the No. 119 bond
ended at 7.06%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)</p>
<p>In West Germany, the government sold 3 billion marks ($1.8
billion) of 10-year bonds via a federal bond consortium. The
bonds yield 8.50% -- about 0.16 percentage point more than
yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes. Traders said that
investors are waiting for today's U.S.-style auction, where a
second class of the 10-year bonds will be sold.</p>
<p>In trading, new supply and a pullback in the U.S. bond
market left prices of West German bonds moderately lower.</p>
<p>Municipal Securities</p>
<p>Municipal bonds ended little changed in uninspired
dealings.</p>
<p>Issues were generally 1/8 point lower to 1/8 point.
Although there was little price action, traders remain upbeat
about the market because of tight supply and the anemic U.S.
economy.</p>
<p>Among actively traded issues, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% issues of 2018 finished 1/8 lower at 99
5/8, nudging the yield up to 7.21% from 7.20% late Monday.</p>
