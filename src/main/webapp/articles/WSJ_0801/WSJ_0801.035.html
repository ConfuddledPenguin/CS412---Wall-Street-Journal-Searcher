	<p class="article-leader">Along the Red River, people always knew where they stood;
north was Oklahoma, south was Texas.
   But soon, that may not be so.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The problem is that the river is a wanderer, shifting
course every time it floods -- which it often does.</p>
<p>When the river overflowed in 1987, for instance, its
shifting course took 140 acres belonging to Thomas Henderson,
a Byers, Texas, farmer, and moved it to Oklahoma from Texas.
With the border relocated, the land no longer belonged to Mr.
Henderson. His Oklahoma neighbors filed a lawsuit to claim
it, but the courts, reviewing deeds and historical records,
handed it instead to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management,
which owned land nearby.</p>
<p>The imbroglio didn't matter much to Mr. Henderson's bank,
which didn't see fit to excise the land from Mr. Henderson's
loan. He pays the bank $13,000 a year for those vanished
acres. "It's really kind of a joke," the beleaguered Mr.
Henderson says. "If you weren't financially involved, you'd
have to laugh at it, really."</p>
<p>But now the Bureau of Land Management is pushing a plan to
set a fixed border that would ignore the shifting river.
Instead, the line would be determined by latitudes and
longitudes. The plan requires the support of both states and
approval by the U.S. Congress. Next week, a committee of
Oklahoma lawmakers is scheduled to begin discussing the
issue.</p>
<p>Farmers seem pleased with the plan. "Wherever they put it
is fine with me, so long as it's set," says Charles
McCullough, a cattle rancher in Devol, Okla., who at various
times has owned as few as 450 acres and as many as 600 acres
on the north side of the river.</p>
<p>Past efforts to set a permanent border have been easier
said than done. Since 1819, the two states have considered
the river's south bank the border. Unfortunately, both Texas
and Oklahoma have used sharply different surveying methods,
with nobody agreeing on the exact location of the south bank.</p>
<p>In 1987, Texas thought it had a solution. It proudly
marked off the south bank with stakes to show officials from
both states. When unveiled the next day, however, the stakes
were about 100 feet off the mark -- and under water. During
the night, the fickle river had shifted again.</p>
<p>"It was a pretty graphic demonstration," says Paul Tanner,
area manager for the Bureau of Land Management.</p>
