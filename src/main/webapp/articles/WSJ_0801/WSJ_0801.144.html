	<p class="article-leader">The Kansas City Royals baseball team, wallowing in the
cellar of the American League West's standings, is on the
block.
   The team said that it has hired a financial adviser,
Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. of New York, to pursue bids for the
team. Currently, the Royals are jointly owned by Ewing
Kauffman, the founder of Marion Laboratories Inc., a unit of
Dow Chemical Corp., and Avron B. Fogelman, a Memphis-based
developer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Fogelman was the subject of a page one story in The
Wall Street Journal last summer, when troubles paying his
bills led to layoffs at his Fogelman Properties Inc. and
speculation that his problems might force him to sell his
interest in the team -- or prompt creditors to seize it.</p>
<p>Mr. Fogelman and Mr. Kauffman couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>Kansas City is one of baseball's smallest markets, but,
with a payroll of about $24 million, according to Sports
Illustrated, the Royals rank as this year's highest-paid
baseball team. During the seven years that Mr. Fogelman and
Mr. Kauffman have owned the team, the Royals nabbed two
American League championships and a World Series.</p>
<p>As part of the purchase of the team, a bidder must be
approved by Major League Baseball and assume a recently
signed 25-year stadium lease. Moreover, bidders must
negotiate a legal thicket involving, among other things, a
$34 million loan made to Mr. Fogelman by the Royals.</p>
<p>Mr. Kauffman has the right to match a bid for the team,
the Royals said.</p>
