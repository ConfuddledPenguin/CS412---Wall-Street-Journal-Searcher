	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Prices of hog and pork-belly futures contracts
jumped as the nation's meatpackers entered their slowest
weeks of the year.
   The supply of mature hogs is usually thinnest in the
summer because of the timing of their reproductive cycles.
That forces meatpackers to bid up prices to find enough hogs
to keep their plants operating.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Reports that cash prices for live hogs were jumping in the
Midwest sent prices of futures contracts higher at the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In trading yesterday, the hog
contract for August delivery rose 0.72 cents to settle at
61.22 cents a pound.</p>
<p>According to some analysts, U.S. slaughterhouses are
operating at about two-thirds of capacity. Federally
inspected slaughterhouses, which have the capacity to kill
roughly 365,000 hogs a day, killed only 241,000 Monday.</p>
<p>The seasonal downturn is being exacerbated this summer by
an unusually tight supply of hogs. The number of hogs
slaughtered last week fell 10% below the comparable 1989
week, according to Jerry Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G.
Edwards & Sons, St. Louis.</p>
<p>After the close of trading, signs emerged that the
slaughter increased yesterday. However, the supply of
fattened hogs probably won't begin to increase significantly
until September. The supply usually peaks in April and
October.</p>
<p>Hog prices have been swinging wildly this year. After
soaring to record levels this spring, hog prices gyrated this
summer amid signs that consumers were cutting back purchases
of the high-priced meat.</p>
<p>The price of pork bellies, which are used to make bacon,
has been particularly volatile this summer. After weakening
in July, contracts for delivery through mid-1991 jumped
yesterday by their daily limit of two cents a pound.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about weakening demand for bacon, prices
increased amid signs that the supply of pork bellies is
dwindling. According to a weekly survey, 7.1 million pounds
of pork bellies were withdrawn from refrigerated warehouses
outside Chicago last week.</p>
<p>The supply of frozen pork bellies, which are refrigerated
for use primarily during the summer, fell to 48.7 million
pounds in warehouses outside Chicago, compared with 78.2
million pounds a year earlier. Another survey tracks frozen
pork-belly supplies in Chicago.</p>
<p>So far, hog traders have shrugged off reports that random
testing by Japan detected sulfamethazine residues in a June
shipment of U.S. pork. A similar discovery in 1988 depressed
prices by sparking speculation that Japan would restrict U.S.
pork imports.</p>
<p>Japan, which is the largest buyer of U.S. pork, has tough
rules about the presence of sulfamethazine residue in meat.
Sulfamethazine, which is widely used to medicate hogs, can
cause an allergic reaction in some people and has been linked
to thyroid tumors in some laboratory rats.</p>
<p>So far, the Japanese government has ordered that pork
shipments from a handful of U.S. plants be checked and
cleared for the residue before being sold in Japan.</p>
<p>Before the discovery, exports of U.S. pork loins to Japan
were running about 25% above 1989 levels, according to the
National Pork Producers Council, which represents hog
farmers. So far, there isn't any sign that U.S. exports are
slipping. Among other things, the weakening of the dollar has
helped fuel U.S. pork shipments.</p>
<p>After the 1988 scare, the hog-farmer group launched a
campaign to teach its members how to use the drug without
tainting livestock.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum prices were strong, while those
of gold rose moderately and silver edged lower.
October-delivery platinum ended with a gain of $10.80 an
ounce at $490.90 after trading as high as $492.50. August
gold was up $2.20 an ounce at $370.00. September silver was
off 1.8 cents an ounce at $4.8220. The lower dollar, tensions
in the Middle East and, most importantly, buying of platinum
by Japanese investors caused the platinum price to surge,
according to Nina Lipton, research manager of the Platinum
Guild International, an industry group. "Platinum has become
an excellent hedge in view of prospects of higher oil prices
that can fuel inflation," she said. "Also, the weakness of
the dollar made platinum cheaper in yen terms. This attracted
Japanese buying of platinum, which triggered heavy
short-covering" by traders who had sold contracts in
anticipation that prices would fall, Ms. Lipton said. The
platinum surge, as well as the lower dollar, also helped
gold, an analyst said. Silver lagged because, in contrast to
the platinum or gold situation, there's no demand for
bullion, she said.</p>
<p>ENERGY: Oil prices mostly rose in light to moderate
activity, with many traders remaining on the sidelines in the
wake of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
meeting. The market moved on a variety of news during the
day, most of it bullish. Delegations from Kuwait and Iraq
held their first round of face-to-face talks in Saudi Arabia
over their bitter disputes that threatened to undo last
week's meeting. Iraq has accused Kuwait of producing beyond
its OPEC quota in a deliberate attempt to undermine the Iraqi
economy. Iraq also accused Kuwait of border violations and of
stealing oil from a field that straddles their border.
Estimates circulated that Iraqi troops along the Kuwaiti
border now number around 100,000, up from earlier estimates
of 30,000. Also, the U.S. Coast Guard estimated that 500,000
gallons of oil have leaked into Galveston Bay in Texas, 10
times its original estimate of last weekend's spill. On the
bearish side, statistics released by the American Petroleum
Institute after trading ended yesterday showed an unexpected
increase in crude oil inventories of 2.9 million barrels last
week.</p>
<p>COFFEE: Futures prices were strong, partly because of
reports that frost damaged the Brazilian coffee crop but
mostly on technically oriented demand. The September contract
settled with a gain of 3.35 cents a pound at 93.80 cents. The
current 1990-91 Brazilian coffee crop, whose harvest began in
May, isn't in any danger from cold weather or frost. The
coffee beans are too mature and have been mostly collected.
The first buds that will eventually bear the 1991-92 crop,
however, are now on the trees, and it is this crop that is
vulnerable to cold weather. Last weekend, temperatures in the
southernmost growing areas of Brazil dropped as low as 34
degrees Fahrenheit. It is believed that the cold caused some
leaf burn and possibly damaged some of the first buds of the
next crop. However, according to Peter Leavitt, vice
president of Weather Services Corp., Bedford, Mass., "Coffee
trees lose blossoms all the time. Subsequent blooms can make
up for any early losses." Milder weather is expected to
continue, Mr. Leavitt said.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices rose. The September contract gained
1.05 cents a pound to $1.2460. Japanese buying of copper
firmed prices in London and subsequently in New York,
analysts said. The London Metal Exchange yesterday reported a
9,300-ton increase in its copper warehouse stocks to 94,275
tons, well above the 7,000-ton increase that had been
expected. But any price-weakening impact appeared to be
offset by a decline in New York's Commodity Exchange
inventories of 751 tons to 11,522 tons. It was the second
consecutive daily drop in the New York exchange's warehouse
stocks. Continuing low global stocks of copper, strong
European demand in addition to that from Japan and a drop of
2% in primary world mine production in the first five months
of this year are all contributing to the current strong price
trend for the metal, according to Fred Demler, first vice
president of commercial futures at PaineWebber.</p>
