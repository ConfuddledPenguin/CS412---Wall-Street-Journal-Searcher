	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks advanced in choppy, nervous trading, sparked
by index-linked buying and improved short-term money market
rates, traders said.
   In London, shares finished a stagnant session firmer but
at intraday minimums in a quiet midweek summer session.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues was up 592.71 points at
31035.66.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index
advanced another 262.67 points to 31298.33.</p>
<p>Tuesday's volume on the first section was estimated at 380
million shares, up from 241.5 million shares Monday.
Advancers widely outnumbered decliners 778174, while 149
issues were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section gained 27.27 points, or 1.23%, to 2252.56.</p>
<p>The Second Section Index rose 73.33 points, or 1.69%, to
4422.33. Volume in the section was estimated at 29 million
shares, up from 12.2 million shares Monday.</p>
<p>Traders said the market is seeking a clear indication that
the yield on the benchmark government bond will recover to a
stable level, perhaps around 7.2%, before posting a solid
rebound.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as short-term money market rates show
signs of improvement, the stock market is likely to have
temporary rallies such as yesterday's, traders said.</p>
<p>The overnight unsecured call money rate dropped one-eighth
of a percentage point this week to 7 1/2%.</p>
<p>But despite some recovery on the benchmark 4.8% coupon
issue due 1999, its yield still traded at 7.57% to 7.60%
after reaching a seven-year high Monday.</p>
<p>Traders said that investment trust funds were busy buying,
using money from positions liquidated over the previous seven
consecutive days of losses for the Nikkei Index.</p>
<p>However, any indication of weakness would trigger an
immediate sell-off, one trader at a domestic securities firm
said. Institutions are much more sensitive about money
realized on the market's decline, he said.</p>
<p>Traders said that institutions, weighed down by poor
holdings, are likely to sell and take profit from gains made
on rallies, as many of the traders missed the opportunity to
do so this past week.</p>
<p>But as for buying, large-group activity drove up the
prices of a wide range of issues only on a short-term basis,
traders said, adding apprehension to the market.</p>
<p>In other market news, trading in shares of Japan Air Lines
will be suspended until next Tuesday, a JAL spokesman said,
to allow for a par-value change. Currently denominated at 500
yen ($3.38) par value, the shares will be changed to 50 yen,
he said. JAL closed at 18,700 yen, up 300 yen.</p>
<p>Also higher was Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, whose
president said that he is considering various measures to
support the company's shares. The stock, which in the past
week hit a series of record lows, was 30,000 yen higher at
1,040,000 yen a share.</p>
<p>Although Kyocera and Fanuc ended slightly lower, most
other high-priced, high-technology shares were higher. Sony
rose 40 to 8,650, while Pioneer added 90 to 6,250 yen.</p>
<p>But most medium-capital shares, such as Matsushita
Electric Industrial, Hitachi and NEC, were softer.</p>
<p>Domestic shares were mostly higher, with oil shares
leading the advances. Nippon Oil rose 40 to 1,380 yen.</p>
<p>Construction, shipbuilding, financial, mining and real
estate shares gained.</p>
<p>In London, share prices were higher from the outset on
optimistic performances in other stock markets, but those
gains were gradually eroded as the session wore on. Little
else captivated the market's attention, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index gained
9.7 points to 2326.2, off the intraday high of 2342.2 and a
shade better than the midafternoon low of 2325.2.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index rose 6.4 points to
1844.5. Volume was 301.5 million shares, down from 341.7
million Monday.</p>
<p>Among the sparse corporate features, National Westminster
Bank fell 10 pence to 315 pence (18 cents to $5.82) after
announcing first-half pretax profit rose 22% to #431 million,
well below market expectations that ranged from #550 million
to #637 million.</p>
<p>The other big clearing banks presented a mixed picture.
Barclays added 4 to 390, Midland fell 3 to 289, while Lloyds
rose 2 to 299. Midland is due to report earnings tomorrow
with Barclays the following day. Abbey National, a former
building society set to report interim results today, closed
unchanged at 214.</p>
<p>STC dropped 11 to 256. Dealers said the shares slumped on
negative media comment after the company's announcement
Monday of a 32% decline in half-year pretax profit and the
sale of the ICL computer division.</p>
<p>Most brewers were down on profit-taking after hefty gains
over the past two weeks. Dealers said the sector has been
climbing steadily, bolstered by expectations of sturdy
profits on the hot weather in Britain this summer.</p>
<p>Bass slipped 7 to #11.11, Allied-Lyons shed 1 to 511,
while Whitbread fell 5 to 462. However, Grand Metropolitan
added 2 to 652, and Scottish & Newcastle closed unchanged at
361.</p>
<p>BPB, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, dropped 2
to 208 on news that French concern Lafarge Coppee is to form
a joint venture with Redland to make plasterboard. Redland
itself slipped 3 to 626.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, shares closed higher in Frankfurt, Paris,
Amsterdam, Zurich, Stockholm, Madrid and Milan. Shares ended
lower in Brussels. South African gold stocks closed higher.</p>
<p>Stocks ended higher in Sydney, Seoul, Taipei and
Wellington, mixed in Hong Kong and lower in Manila and
Singapore.</p>

as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
