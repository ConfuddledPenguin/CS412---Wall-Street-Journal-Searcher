	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush and top congressional
Democrats, surrendering any hope of reaching a
deficit-reduction accord in August, are inching toward
agreement to try to negotiate a pact immediately after Labor
Day.
   A White House official said President Bush and top
congressional Democrats yesterday tentatively agreed to set
firm dates in September for floor votes on an agreement, even
though they haven't reached one. But some Democratic budget
negotiators are resisting what Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.)
termed making any "agreement to agree" on spending cuts and
tax increases.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta (D., Calif.)
said budget negotiators are talking about an ambitious
schedule of resuming talks immediately after Labor Day with a
goal of reaching an accord by Sept. 10, the day the rest of
the Congress returns from its summer recess. The goal would
be to get Congress to enact the agreement by Oct. 1.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush and congressional Republicans want the entire
Congress to ratify that timetable, but a parliamentary
mechanism for that hasn't been agreed to yet.</p>
<p>Preoccupied with tactics, schedules and the pending August
recess, budget negotiators have spent little time in the past
week talking about the substance of what spending to cut or
what taxes to increase. Nevertheless, the White House so far
has displayed no sign that Mr. Bush has accepted advice from
some congressional Republicans that he criticize Democrats
for not putting forward a deficit-reduction proposal of their
own.</p>
<p>But a White House official said that Mr. Bush and top
Democrats have agreed to "break the code of silence" that was
supposed to surround the talks. The new posture would allow
both sides to "debate publicly the merits of ideas," and that
could open the door to more partisan debate in the next few
weeks.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush invited congressional Republicans to breakfast
this morning, and some of them expect the president to begin
criticizing the Democrats soon after that.</p>
<p>Republican budget negotiators continue to insist that Rep.
Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), the House majority leader,
indicated to budget negotiators on July 24 that Democrats
would present a deficit-reduction plan of their own within a
few days. Democrats deny that he made any such promise. "I
don't think there was any reneging," Rep. Gephardt said.
"There may have been some miscommunications about what was to
happen."</p>
