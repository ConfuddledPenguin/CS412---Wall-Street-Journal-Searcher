	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- Procter & Gamble Co. is considering a $200
million expansion of its century-old Ivorydale plant near
this city.
   P&G officials say the soap and detergent plant is one of
several midwestern U.S. plants that could be expanded as part
of its restructuring.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Local officials expect the expansion following the
Cincinnati consumer products company's request for a property
tax abatement on $200 million in plant improvements.</p>
<p>P&G yesterday won a 75% property tax abatement for new
buildings and machinery at the site. The abatement could save
P&G up to $15 million in taxes over 10 years, said David
Main, executive director of Hamilton County Development Co.,
the county's economic development agency.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for P&G said the abatement makes the
Ivorydale site competitive with other locations, but
expansion plans aren't official because "there are several
projects under consideration."</p>
<p>Other P&G sites that could be expanded include laundry and
cleaning products plants in Alexandria, La., and Augusta,
Ga., or a peanut-butter plant in Lexington, Ky. P&G could
choose to build a plant at another site, according to a
company spokeswoman.</p>
<p>It's unclear whether the Ivorydale expansion will include
new products or simply shift production from other plants
that P&G plans to close.</p>
<p>For instance, P&G has announced plans to close its Port
Ivory plant in Staten Island, N.Y. That plant employs 425
people and makes soaps, detergents and cleaners.</p>
