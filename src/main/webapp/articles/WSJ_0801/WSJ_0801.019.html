	<p class="article-leader">CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE, Toronto, said it plans
to issue 150 million Canadian dollars ($130.2 million) of
debentures to mature in August, 2010. It said the debentures
would pay 11.85% interest for the first five years, with the
rate adjusted through an auction process for each subsequent
five-year period. The issue will be underwritten by a group
headed by Wood Gundy Inc. The bank said proceeds would be
added to its capital base.</p>
