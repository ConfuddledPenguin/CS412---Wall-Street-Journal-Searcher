	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Georgia Power Co. said it agreed in principle
to sell one of its coal-fired power plants in a transaction
valued at about $810 million over four years.
   The company, a subsidiary of Southern Co., said it plans
to sell unit No. 4 of its Scherer electric generating plant
in Forysth, Ga., to Florida Power & Light Co. and
Jacksonville Electric Authority. The sale will be made in
stages during the years 1991 through 1995. Florida Power &
Light, a unit of FPL Group Inc. in North Palm Beach, Fla.,
would eventually own 76% of the 846-megawatt unit;
Jacksonville Electric Authority would own the remainder.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Georgia Power said the first part of the sale, totaling
about $300 million, is expected to be completed in the first
six months of 1991. The entire transaction is subject to
negotiation of final agreements and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>James L. Broadhead, chairman and chief executive officer
of Florida Power & Light, said the move will fulfill a
significant portion of the utility's need for additional
generating capacity.</p>
<p>Georgia Power said it hasn't determined how it will use
proceeds from the proposed sales, but added that one
alternative is a special redemption at par of outstanding
first mortgage bonds.</p>
<p>Unit No. 4 of the Scherer facility was completed in 1989.
Units Nos. 1, 2 and 3 are owned jointly by Georgia Power,
Oglethorpe Power Corp., the Municipal Electric Authority of
Georgia, Gulf Power Co. and the city of Dalton, Ga.</p>
