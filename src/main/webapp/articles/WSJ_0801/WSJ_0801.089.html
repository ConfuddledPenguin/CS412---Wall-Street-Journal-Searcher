	<p class="article-leader">Rochester Telephone Corp. is fast becoming the Pac-Man of
the telephone industry.
   When Alan Hasselwander answered the call to be Rochester
Tel's chairman in 1987, he didn't hear enough phones ringing
in northern New York, a slow-growth region. So while most of
the industry held the line, Mr. Hasselwander and his gang of
Rochester natives gobbled up more than a score of
subsidiaries, from Alabama to North Dakota.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 56-year-old Mr. Hasselwander, who started with
Rochester Tel as a plant manager 33 years ago, was anxious to
break out of his home town. "We looked around at the
Rochester area, and we saw a flat existence," he said. "We
looked for opportunities."</p>
<p>They uncovered opportunities where others never looked,
spending some $335.5 million since March 1987 for rural phone
companies in the Midwest and Southeast. These include Urban
Telephone Co. in Clintonville, Wis., a third-generation
family-owned company serving the Menominee Indian
Reservation, and tiny S&A Telephone Co., with 800 lines 30
miles southwest of Topeka, Kan. The subsidiaries are small
(between 1,000 and 22,000 lines) and virtually immune to
regulation, with lots of room for growth.</p>
<p>Tired of dwelling in the industry's shadows, the Rochester
Tel management, a hungry, close-knit group of company
veterans, was intent on proving it could play in the major
leagues. At times they struck out.</p>
<p>The company leaped headlong into fiber optics, building a
cable between Rochester and Chicago, only to find it couldn't
get enough people to use it. Rochester Tel also had to
retreat from a telephone supplies business.</p>
<p>The company has had better luck with its buying binge,
which has built its phone business revenue to a projected
$414 million this year from $322 million in 1986. Net income
also climbed to $72.1 million in 1989 from $39.9 million in
1984. Subsidiaries will control 34% of its 688,000 phone
lines this year. In 1985, the company had 467,000 lines.</p>
<p>While it has acquired most companies with stock swaps,
some recent sellers have demanded cash. This pushed Rochester
Tel's debt ratio over 50%, prompting a lower bond rating.
Executives say they don't plan any more debt deals. Besides,
they contend, the phone business promises steady earnings.</p>
<p>"They're in the most stable, leverageable business in the
universe," said Morgan Stanley & Co.'s Edward M. Greenberg.
Added PaineWebber Inc.'s Jack Grubman, "They understand the
world is changing, so they're pro-active, not reactive. It's
a shame they're not bigger, with more resources. This whole
industry would be a lot more interesting."</p>
<p>In an eat-or-be-eaten industry, Rochester Tel hopes to
devour more small rural phone companies before competitors
get the same idea. It plans to pick up some 40,000 or 50,000
lines a year. At that rate it will soon overtake Cincinnati
Bell Inc., which had 781,000 lines at the end of 1989.</p>
<p>But competition has been increasing for the 1,400
remaining companies, only 400 of which Rochester deems large
enough to be worth buying. (Lightly populated Iowa, for
example, has 144 companies.) The price per access line has
jumped to $2,200 from $1,500 in the last two years. Mario
Gabelli, who with a 7% interest is Rochester Tel's largest
shareholder, said it matters less what the company buys, only
that it buys while it can: "They'll have the opportunity to
trade {the subsidiaries} down the road or just keep them as
good businesses."</p>
<p>The out-of-state expansion will free Rochester Tel from
its captivity under New York state regulations. It also makes
the company more difficult to be acquired, leading some to
see Rochester Tel's expansion as a takeover defense. The
company denies this motive.</p>
<p>Still, General Telephone Co.'s recent merger with
Continental Telecom Inc., which will result in the largest
local phone company in the U.S. with 17.7 million access
lines, stirred speculation that Rochester Tel might be an
acquisition target, as the stock rose three points in one
day. But Nynex Corp., a likely buyer because it surrounds
Rochester Tel's territory, said it isn't in a buying mood.</p>
<p>Bell Atlantic Corp., with 17 million access lines at the
end of last year, was the largest local telephone company
before the GTE-Contel merger two weeks ago. The next largest
company after Rochester Tel is Century Telephone Co. of
Louisiana, with 296,000 access lines. Rochester Tel was the
16th-largest at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Rochester Tel is one of only three metropolitan-area
independents in the U.S. that escaped the Bell companies'
consolidation over the years. Executives trace this
historical anomaly to a deal the company made with rival New
York Telephone early in the century that surrendered Buffalo
but kept Rochester independent.</p>
<p>The acquisitions might also counteract slow business at
home, where the phone division finds annual growth below 2%.
And the company's telecommunications units -- long-distance
service RCI, interoffice service Rotelcom, and a cellular
unit -- have posted lower-than-expected returns. But the
company likes the notion of providing one-stop shopping, and
it sees future growth in its cellular and long-distance
efforts. "We're not ready to throw the towel in," said Fred
Pestorius, chief financial officer.</p>
<p>Competitors and partners say they respect Rochester's
straight-talking, aggressive style. "They don't waste a lot
of time," said John Pigott, president of Anixter Bros. Inc.,
a telephone supplies company in a joint venture with
Rochester Tel. "At big companies, everyone agrees, but
nothing happens," he said. "That doesn't happen with them."</p>
<p>But while the company rings up respect in the industry,
Wall Street hasn't returned the call. Analysts say the stock
is underfollowed and undervalued. In composite trading
yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Rochester Tel
closed at $32, unchanged.</p>
<p>The company sticks to what it knows, avoiding purchases
overseas or in unfamiliar industries. "We're not going to go
out and buy a savings and loan," said Vice President John
Purcell, who heads the acquisitions.</p>
<p>But even in its industry Rochester Tel may have trouble
managing its new size. "I think you get some real problems
when you have a lot of extensions all over the place," said
Jim Geist, chairman of Lincoln Telecommunications Co.,
Lincoln, Neb., the nation's 14th-largest phone company.</p>
<p>Rochester Tel now must coordinate operations and deal with
regulators in nine states. But Kristin Jenks, director of
investor relations, said the company isn't worried about
service consistency. "If we were selling Hershey kisses, it
would make a difference."</p>
<p>Rochester Tel prefers to let the subsidiaries run
themselves with previous management. "That's the reason we
selected them," said Gary Crum, president of the newly
purchased Schuyler Telephone Co., Rushville, Ill.</p>
<p>Mr. Purcell believes home rule for the subsidiaries is
crucial. "There's a lot of talk about getting close to the
customer," he said, "but nobody gets closer to a customer
than the man or woman who runs a small company in a town of
2,000 people."</p>
