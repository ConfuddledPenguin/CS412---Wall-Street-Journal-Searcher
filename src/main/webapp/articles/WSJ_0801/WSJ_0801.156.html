	<p class="article-leader">A U.S. PANEL cleared the first human tests of gene therapy
to fight disease.
   The National Institutes of Health committee approved the
use of gene therapy to treat a fatal form of skin cancer and
an inherited immune-system disorder that affects children.
The panel's chairman said that the approvals move gene
therapy "from abstract science to research and patient care."
Scientists have traced some inherited disorders, including
hemophilia and cystic fibrosis, to malfunctions by genes,
which instruct cells to perform functions. As a result,
researchers are focusing on therapies to replace missing
genes or to enhance the genes' performance as a possible
treatment for disease.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But gene therapy has attracted criticism from groups who
worry that it could lead to tinkering with genetic structures
to improve the human race.</p>

<p>AN OIL SPILL SPREAD off Texas, disrupting shipping and
threatening wildlife.</p>
<p>The spill from a collision between a tanker and two barges
in Galveston Bay blocked most vessels for the third day from
the Houston Ship Channel, though some ships went through last
night. The Coast Guard said only a few dead birds and fish
were reported, but that more were expected as the oil moved
ashore. Initially, Coast Guard officials said only about
50,000 gallons of oil spilled, but they later raised that to
500,000 gallons.</p>
<p>Local maritime shipping experts estimated that the
shipping channel's closing is costing $1 million to $1.5
million a day to owners of idled ships.</p>

<p>A defense spending bill was approved by the House Armed
Services panel that guts the Pentagon's top-priority
strategic programs, shelves production of other weapons and
cuts three times as many troops as Bush proposed. In clearing
the $283 billion bill, the panel cut $24 billion from Bush's
spending blueprint.</p>

<p>Scientists said they are on the trail of a gene that
raises the risk of developing lung cancer, especially for
smokers. Two research reports are the firmest proof yet that
a susceptibility to lung cancer can be passed from generation
to generation, and may explain why lung cancer is relatively
common in some families.</p>

<p>Moslem rebels freed Trinidad's Prime Minister Robinson,
but other hostages seized during Friday's coup attempt were
still being held, according to Trinidad's attorney general.
He refused to say what conditions led to Robinson's release.
According to other officials, the premier had been shot in
both legs and beaten during his captivity.</p>

<p>Federal investigators spread blame for the March 1989
Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska, criticizing the captain,
his third mate, the Coast Guard and state and local
authorities, as well as Exxon Shipping. The National
Transportation Safety Board's findings ended a 16-month probe
concerning the nation's worst spill.</p>

<p>Liberian government troops staged a counterattack on
rebels fighting to oust Doe and recaptured parts of Monrovia.
Meanwhile, the president vowed to "fight until the last
soldiers in the Liberian army die." The offensive came a day
after loyalist troops were accused of killing hundreds of
civilian refugees in a Lutheran church.</p>

<p>A Senate subcommittee rejected fiscal 1991 funding sought
by the Bush administration to establish a National Drug
Intelligence Center under the Justice Department and drug
czar Bennett. Instead, the Appropriations panel chose to
apply the requested $46 million to expand an existing
anti-drug program.</p>

<p>The Irish Republican Army said in a statement that it
killed British lawmaker Ian Gow because of his friendship
with Prime Minister Thatcher and his role in developing
Britain's policy concerning Northern Ireland. Gow, 53, died
Monday when a bomb exploded under his automobile.</p>

<p>Kuwaiti and Iraqi negotiators began talks in Saudi Arabia
on their oil and border dispute, while Persian Gulf-based
diplomats said Iraq had massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's
border. The diplomats said the Iraqi force, triple the number
earlier reported, included about 300 Soviet-made tanks.</p>

<p>A federal jury in Los Angeles found a Mexican businessman
guilty of racketeering, kidnapping and conspiracy in the 1985
death of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena. Ruben Zuno Arce, a
brother-in-law of a former president of Mexico, was the third
defendant found guilty in the trial.</p>

<p>Soviet citizens will be allowed, as of today, to spend and
save convertible currency without stating the source of the
income. The government also plans to open stores selling
certain imported and domestic goods for hard currency.</p>
