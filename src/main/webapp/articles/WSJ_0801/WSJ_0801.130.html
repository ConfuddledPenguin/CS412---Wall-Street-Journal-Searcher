	<p class="article-leader">Eagle Financial Corp., hoping to enhance its stock value,
said it plans to buy back up to 10% of its shares
outstanding.
   The Bristol, Conn., bank holding company said it would
repurchase the shares periodically over the next 12 months in
the open market and in unsolicited negotiated transactions.
The company said it has about 2.7 million shares outstanding.
The shares closed yesterday at $8.75, up 25 cents, in
American Stock Exchange trading.</p>

Federal Savings Bank unit, and Steven E. Lasewics Jr., a
director of the Bristol Federal Savings unit, were named
directors of the parent company, increasing the board
membership to 10.</p>
<p>The boards for the subsidiaries have been replaced by the
