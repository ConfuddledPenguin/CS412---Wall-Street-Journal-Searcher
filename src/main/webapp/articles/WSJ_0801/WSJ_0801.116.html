	<p class="article-leader">Petrofina S.A. said lower petrochemical prices and the
weak dollar knocked its net profit down 12% in the first
half.
   The Belgian oil and petrochemical company said net profit
totaled 10.13 billion Belgian francs ($306.8 million), down
from 11.49 billion Belgian francs a year earlier. The company
didn't provide figures for total sales.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On the Brussels Bourse, Petrofina shares slipped 225
Belgian francs to close at 11,800 Belgian francs. Patrick de
Bellefroid, chief analyst at Puissant Baeyens Poswick & Cie.,
called the results "a bit disappointing" and said his firm
might have to reduce its forecast for the full year, which
had called for earnings about even with 1989's 21.82 billion
Belgian francs.</p>
<p>Though Petrofina's petrochemical results were down
substantially in the half, the company said profit margins
began to improve in the second quarter for two of its main
products, high-density polyethylene and polypropylene.</p>
<p>The weak dollar hurt Petrofina's results partly because
the company derives substantial income from its American
Petrofina Inc. unit.</p>
<p>In Europe, Petrofina said its sales of gasoline and other
motor fuels rose 8%.</p>
