   A Reunified Korea?</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">It is tempting to read great significance into next
month's proposed meeting between the prime ministers of North
and South Korea, given the rarity of high-level contacts
between the two Koreas in the violent 45 years of their
separate existence. But while hope is a natural response, we
have learned to be skeptical that such events, in themselves,
offer promise of Korean reunification.
   Kim Il Sung probably is genuinely nervous about his
godfathers in Moscow. Mikhail Gorbachev's meeting with South
Korean President Roh Tae Woo in California earlier this year
suggested that the Soviets are taking up with Kim's worst
rival. Those fears have been fanned by Soviet-South Korean
talks to normalize relations and trade overtures to Seoul
from Beijing as well.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Kim knows how to play symbolic games. His agreement to
the prime minister get-together probably is another of his
well-practiced exercises in dissemblance.</p>
<p>Something more substantive, a proposed temporary breach of
the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to allow some direct contact
between North and South Koreans, apparently won't happen.
Both governments agreed in principle to a joint rally in the
Panmunjom truce village August 15 to celebrate Liberation
Day, which commemorates Korea's 1945 liberation from Japan.
But in a last-minute spate of demands, gripes and
accusations, North Korea seems to have scuttled that plan.</p>
<p>Our own guess is that for any progress toward
reunification on terms acceptable to the civilized world, the
North's communist regime must go. So far that doesn't seem to
be on Pyongyang's agenda.</p>
<p>South Korea, however, is growing bolder. President Roh not
only approved the prime ministers' meeting and the August 15
rally, but suggested that all Koreans be allowed to travel
freely throughout the peninsula for five days next month. He
even agreed to allow North Korean officials and South Korean
dissidents to meet in Seoul to discuss arrangements for the
rally.</p>
<p>Pyongyang's response was less than gracious. State radio
broadcasts called the offer of travel "fraudulent
propaganda." North Korean diplomats imposed absurd
conditions. To Seoul's suggestion that the Liberation Day
rally be open to everyone, Pyongyang replied that only South
Korea's radical students and dissidents, many of them
sympathetic to the North, would be welcome. To allow anyone
else, North Korea said, would be "an act of challenge we
cannot permit." When the time came late last week for five
North Korean officials to go to Seoul to meet the dissidents
and fix the details of the Liberation Day rally, they found
an excuse not to go.</p>
<p>The contrast between the two Koreas grows more profound
every day. Since 1985 -- the last time a few North Koreans
were allowed in -- South Korea has held free presidential and
legislative elections, hosted the Olympics, and become a
regional economic power. North Korea, under Great Leader Kim
Il Sung, meanwhile has been rounding out its long record of
poverty and international isolation.</p>
<p>Mr. Roh's proposals for breaching the DMZ signify South
Korea's growing self-confidence. It is unlikely, for
instance, that South Korea's increasingly sophisticated
citizens are going to be overwhelmed by a visit to
Pyongyang's Department Store Number 1 or the Victorious
Fatherland Liberation Museum.</p>
<p>The South is not yet a model democracy. The entire
opposition in Seoul's National Assembly walked out after the
ruling Democratic Liberal Party rudely rushed through 25
bills in less than a minute during the closing session last
week. But every step toward political and economic maturity
in South Korea represents another blow to Pyongyang. The
North can only respond to the South's real progress with
gestures, and over time, symbols are no match for substance.</p>
