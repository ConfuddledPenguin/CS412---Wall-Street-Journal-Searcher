	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House passed and sent to the Senate a
bill that would raise the federal borrowing limit to $3.444
trillion from $3.122 trillion, sufficient to allow government
borrowing through September 1991.
   Congressional leaders expect the bill to bog down in the
Senate and a shorter-term extension to take its place. A
short-term alternative already has been moving in the House
even as the lawmakers voted yesterday. The House Ways and
Means Committee has approved a measure that would authorize
the Treasury to keep borrowing through Oct. 15. This version
may reach the House floor later this week. The Treasury says
it will default unless Congress lifts the debt ceiling by
Aug. 15.</p>

although Senate leaders say they may delay their departure in
order to continue working on a deficit-reduction package.</p>
<p>Yesterday's debt bill, which was approved 221-205,
included a provision backed by Rep. Byron Dorgan (D., N.D.)
that would remove the Social Security Trust Fund from the
Gramm-Rudman calculation of the federal budget deficit.</p>
