	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The government reported that sales of newly
built single-family houses rose 8% in June, following a 2.3%
increase in May.
   Sales in June ran at an annual rate of 581,000 units,
according to the report by the departments of Commerce and
Housing and Urban Development. The figures are adjusted for
seasonal changes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales fell 5.7% in April, the report said. Analysts
suggested that the decline in mortgage rates over the past
few months may have led to a rebound.</p>
<p>Many economists regard the home sales figures as
unreliable, however, because they are often heavily revised
in subsequent months. The government itself said in the
report that the margin of error is so great -- plus or minus
12 percentage points -- that the 8% increase reported for
June may in fact turn out to have been a decline.</p>
<p>The departments put the average price of newly built homes
at $152,900 in June, up from $149,700 in May. They said the
median price was $129,900, up from $127,900 in May.</p>
