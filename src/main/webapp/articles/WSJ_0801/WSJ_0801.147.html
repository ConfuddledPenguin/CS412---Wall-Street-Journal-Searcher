   Hinders the Group</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Executives at French nuclear power plant builder
Framatome said the long-running wrangle between shareholders
is seriously hindering the group. But, they said, the dispute
should be resolved by early September.
   Company officials also threw a new element into the debate
by calling for Framatome's one-time rival Schneider S.A. to
take a 20% stake in the company to counter the unwelcome
presence of Compagnie Generale d'Electricite, or CGE.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Framatome has been the focus of a dispute between the
state and the private sector since CGE agreed last March to
buy construction group Dumez Group's 12% stake in the
company, thereby raising its own stake to 52%. State-owned
firms and Framatome's employees own the remaining 48% of the
group's capital.</p>
<p>France depends heavily on nuclear power, and so CGE's move
drew opposition from President Francois Mitterrand and the
governing Socialist Party, neither of whom wanted to see such
a strategic industry pass out of the public sector. They
asked CGE to cut its stake to less than 50%.</p>
<p>Marcel Chabrillac, Framatome's director for nuclear
engineering, sharply attacked CGE yesterday. "CGE has never
brought us anything. It has just taken its dividends. . . .
For some of its shareholders, Framatome is nothing more than
a cash cow," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Chabrillac also said that the uncertainty over the
group's future had held up its plans to develop new business,
especially in the U.S. and in China.</p>
<p>A CGE official said later that the company was willing to
discuss cutting its stake, but he declined to give further
details.</p>
<p>A Schneider official said an alliance between the
engineering group and Framatome was sound industrial logic
because the two companies already worked together on many
nuclear plant projects.</p>
<p>But officials at Schneider and Framatome said several
tricky details remained to be resolved: Both Schneider and
CGE are reluctant to share a role in Framatome with the
other; a price has to be set for any Framatome shares that
CGE sells. And the government, a key player in the
negotiations, is unlikely to smile on Schneider's entry into
Framatome.</p>
