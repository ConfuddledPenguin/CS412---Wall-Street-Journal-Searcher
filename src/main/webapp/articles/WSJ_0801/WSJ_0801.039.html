	<p class="article-leader">Interco Inc. said it reached "basic agreement" with
representatives of its bondholders and banks to restructure
its $1.9 billion in debt, averting at least for now a
bankruptcy-law filing.
   The troubled St. Louis furniture and footwear company,
which had threatened to seek bankruptcy-court protection if
it couldn't otherwise restructure its debt, didn't disclose
terms of the pact. It said only that discussions were
continuing and it expected to announce "shortly" details of
an agreement in principle.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But an individual involved in the negotiations, which ran
through the night Monday, said the major change involves an
agreement by the banks to a "more relaxed" payment schedule
than Interco had originally proposed. It calls for smaller
payments in earlier years and gives the company more time to
rebuild itself, the individual said.</p>
<p>To appease creditors, Interco management also agreed to
consider selling its Converse athletic-shoe unit if Interco
isn't able to meet its new debt-repayment targets. As
recently as June, Interco had talked of Converse as a core
business that wouldn't be sold. "It's the company's belief
that they won't have to sell Converse," another person
involved in the talks said. "But the rest of the world thinks
Converse could go."</p>
<p>Holders of the company's medium-term notes, which predate
the 1988 recapitalization that caused Interco's current cash
crunch, received assurances they would get paid on schedule
over the next three years, the individual added. And he said
holders of "junk" securities issued in Interco's 1988
recapitalization agreed to exchange their bonds for stock
plus some new debt securities that would pay a "modest"
amount of interest in cash, starting in 1993. Interco had
originally proposed an exchange offer that would give these
bondholders stock and convertible bonds.</p>
<p>The bondholders had resisted becoming stockholders in a
weak company that could later slide into bankruptcy. But they
were also understood to be satisfied that the company's cash
flow could support the new bank-payment schedule.</p>
<p>Interco's debt plan was seen as good news in the bond
market. Late yesterday, Interco's 8 7/8% medium-term notes
were quoted at 76 cents on the dollar, up about 10% from the
previous day's prices. Interco's 13 3/4% senior subordinated
debentures rose to 25 cents on the dollar, from 23.75 cents
Monday. Even Interco's stock inched up slightly, to 37.5
cents a share, up 3.125 cents, in composite New York Stock
Exchange trading.</p>
<p>Interco, which makes Lane and Broyhill furniture and
Converse and Florsheim shoes, has been staggering under a
heavy debt load since late 1988, when it paid big dividends
in cash and junk securities to fend off a raider. In May, it
proposed a plan that would have canceled much of the
junk-bond debt and let holders own 70% of the company's stock
instead. The company also threatened a bankruptcy-law filing
if the bondholders failed to agree to the plan.</p>
<p>Interco still could wind up in bankruptcy court if the new
debt-swap offer isn't approved by as many as 95% of the
holders of each class of bonds. But the agreement reached
yesterday increases the chances that it could pursue a
"prepackaged" bankruptcy reorganization plan, if necessary.</p>
<p>Under such an arrangement, any debt swap would require the
approval by holders of only two-thirds of each class of
bonds, the company has said. Interco could then make the debt
swap mandatory for all bondholders, something it couldn't do
without a bankruptcy filing. That would avoid thorny problems
associated with holdout bondholders.</p>
<p>Interco's advisers also say that the prepackaged
bankruptcy option would let Interco emerge from bankruptcy
proceedings within six months -- a far shorter time than the
two years or more that most companies spend in court.</p>
<p>The talks, which began Friday at the New York law offices
of Debevoise & Plimpton and continued in fits and starts
through the weekend, came to a head Monday. That's when
Interco was scheduled to make a bank interest payment of
roughly $10 million, individuals familiar with the situation
said. The missed payment raised the chances that creditors
would file an involuntary bankruptcy petition. Interco had
already defaulted on payments to its holders of its
high-risk, high-yield junk bonds and medium-term note
holders.</p>
<p>Interco said the steering committee of its banks agreed to
unanimously recommend that all principal and interest
payments be deferred through Oct. 1. An individual familiar
with the company's financial position said Interco would have
run out of cash this month if it had made the bank interest
payment on Monday.</p>
