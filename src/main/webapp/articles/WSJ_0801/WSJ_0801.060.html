	<p class="article-leader">I.G. "Jack" Davis Jr., an experienced casino executive who
ran Resorts International for 29 years, was named president
of the Trump Taj Mahal casino. Mr. Davis is the fourth
individual named to the position within the past year. He
will also serve as the facility's chief operating officer.
   The move was announced by Edward M. Tracy, the president
of Donald Trump's casino operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new position marks a return of sorts for the
65-year-old Mr. Davis, who helped conceive the Taj Mahal
project when it was launched by Resorts International a
decade ago. Mr. Davis's relationship with Mr. Trump dates
back to 1987 when, as president of Resorts, he helped
persuade the estate of the company's late founder to sell its
stock to Mr. Trump. After gaining control of the company, Mr.
Davis confirmed, Mr. Trump gave him a $1 million-a-year
salary.</p>
<p>"Jack obviously knows a lot about the project," Mr. Tracy
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis resigned from Resorts after the company was
purchased by Merv Griffin in 1988, but he is believed to have
remained friendly with Mr. Trump. "The casino business stays
in your blood," he said. "I feel I have some unfinished
business to take care of."</p>
<p>Mr. Davis will have his work cut out for him. The Taj
Mahal, which opened to great fanfare on April 2, has not been
the smash some casino analysts predicted, and appears to be a
drain on Mr. Trump's already distressed holdings. In its
first quarter of operations it had a net operating loss of
about $15 million, according to people familiar with the
casino. In July, the facility is expected to gross about $40
million, which would be a record month for any casino, but
would also fall short of what the Taj must gross in the busy
summer months to meet annual debt payments of about $100
million.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal's disappointing performance has led Trump
officials to prepare to propose an exchange offer for holders
of $675 million in junk bonds that Mr. Trump sold to pay for
the property. The offer, which could be announced by the end
of August, would require bondholders to agree to exchange
debt for equity in the casino.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis will succeed Willard "Bucky" Howard, who will
become the Taj's executive vice president and concentrate on
casino operations, Mr. Tracy said. Shortly after the Taj
opened, Mr. Howard replaced Walter Haybert as president of
the casino and hotel facility. Mr. Haybert had taken the
place of Mark Etess, who died in a helicopter crash along
with two other Trump Organization officials in October.</p>
<p>Mr. Tracy said he expected that Mr. Trump's bankers, who
recently agreed to a restructuring of his $2 billion in bank
debt, would be pleased with the decision to hire Mr. Davis.
But, he added, they had not been consulted. For regulatory
reasons, Mr. Trump's lenders have no say in day-to-day casino
operations, Mr. Tracy said.</p>
