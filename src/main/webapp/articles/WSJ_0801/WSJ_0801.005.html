	<p class="article-leader">The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles have spent most of this
year starring in Burger King's ad campaign. But don't be
surprised when they show up instead in ads for rival Pizza
Hut.
   The pizza chain is expected to announce today a massive
promotional tie-in with a 40-city Mutant Ninja Turtles rock
concert tour, kicking off next month at Radio City Music Hall
in New York. Even though Burger King has been promoting the
crime-fighting turtles all year with toy giveaways at its
restaurants, Pizza Hut insists it isn't settling for sloppy
seconds. It's betting a small fortune that kids won't think
so, either: It's pumping $20 million into the September
rock-concert launch alone.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The tie-in is just the latest of hundreds of products and
promotions spawned by the turtles, in a licensing blitz that
seems sure to end in burn-out, sending the turtles the way of
Batman and the Pet Rock. Turtle products are multiplying so
fast that some marketing experts believe the turtles are on
their way out already.</p>
<p>"The minute you overexpose a character, you kill it. And
once you kill it, it will never come back," says Al Ries, a
marketing consultant with Trout & Ries in Greenwich, Conn.
"The owners of the Ninja Turtles are killing their pets by
overexposing them," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Ries contends it's already too late for Pizza Hut and
others to jump on the turtle bandwagon. "I think very much
this is the downside of the Ninja Turtle fad. The younger the
audience, the faster the fads come and go," he says, adding
that "whether or not it pays off for Pizza Hut at this late
stage of the fad, I doubt it."</p>
<p>Certainly, the signs of overkill are present and accounted
for. About 130 licensees have already flooded the country
with more than 500 different Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle
products. Aside from every imaginable souvenir and T-shirt,
the turtles are promoting food brands from Light 'n Lively
yogurt to Thomas's English Muffins. Then there are Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles vanilla-flavored pizza candy, pasta
dinners, peanut-butter graham cookies -- even Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles pork rinds. No kidding.</p>
<p>"What's happening is the old philosophy of get as much as
you can as fast as you can while the property is hot," says
Martin Friedman, editor of Chicago-based Gorman's New Product
News, which tracks new product introductions. "They seem to
be selling the rights to just about anyone who asks." The
strategy may make sense. The fad might well die out as
quickly even if the turtles weren't everywhere.</p>
<p>Mark Freedman, president of Surge Licensing in Jericho,
N.Y., the turtles' licensing agent, boasts that turtles
retail sales will reach $1 billion world-wide this year --
rivaling the record-breaking sales of Batman paraphernalia
last year. Yet he insists the turtles aren't overexposed at
all. He likens them somewhat improbably to Mickey Mouse
rather than to once-hot, now dead-as-a-doornail fads such as
Strawberry Shortcake and Donkey Kong.</p>
<p>"The goal is to create the next set of classic characters.
I really believe this isn't a fad," he says. "Most licensers
run and take the money. We've said no to hundreds and
hundreds of products." Among the requests he's turned down:
fishing rods, vitamins, 900 numbers and condoms. "I think
that was a joke," he says of the latter.</p>
<p>Pizza Hut, a PepsiCo unit, also insists that the turtles
will last -- or at least won't run out of steam during the
yearlong tour and an international leg that's scheduled to
follow. "Everything that's been done before has been with the
cartoon characters. These guys are going to be live rock
musicians. It's different enough to allow us to break
through," says David Novak, the pizza chain's senior vice
president of marketing. "It isn't overexposure; this is new
exposure. We think they'll be hot for years to come."</p>
<p>Mr. Novak says Pizza Hut also will benefit because, as
anyone with kids knows, pizza is the turtles' favorite food.
Mr. Freedman says that, in fact, he approached Pizza Hut
about a promotion before going to Burger King, but that Pizza
Hut executives at the time didn't bite. Chastened now, Pizza
Hut is going all out: sponsoring the tour, using the singing
turtles in commercials and creating promotions around the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie video release and sequel.</p>
<p>In any case, says Steven Leber, co-producer of the rock
tour, overexposure won't be a problem, because the cartoon
turtles are the ones that have been touting all sorts of
products. "These {live} turtles don't endorse all those
products; the only product they talk about is Pizza Hut," he
says.</p>
<p>Still, it's hard not to think overkill when overwhelmed by
Teenage Mutant Ninja giftware, partyware, outerwear and now,
fast food promotions. After Burger King spent seven months
hammering home the turtles, the Pizza Hut promotion will be
somewhat diluted, contends Marty Blackman of Blackman &
Raber, a New York sports and celebrity promotion company.</p>
<p>Because the two fast food chains' promotions are very
different, "there is some credibility" for Pizza Hut, Mr.
Blackman says. "But is there some loss of value? No question
about it. The value of the promotion is diminished because of
Burger King's first and heavy promotion."</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>SHOAL CREEK: Spalding Sports Worldwide, Chicopee, Mass.,
joined a group of advertisers that have canceled plans to
advertise on broadcasts of a professional golf tournament to
be held at the Shoal Creek country club in Birmingham, Ala.,
where there are no black members. The Associated Press
reported that Shoal Creek said it's willing to admit a black
businessman as an "honorary member" and that the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference called off its protest of the
event as a result.</p>
