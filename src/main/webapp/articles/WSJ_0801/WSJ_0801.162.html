	<p class="article-leader">FORT WORTH, Texas -- Urcarco Inc. said two lawsuits had
been filed in federal courts in Dallas and Fort Worth
accusing the high-flying operator of used car lots of
violating securities laws.
   Also named as defendants were certain Urcarco executives,
including Chairman Clifton Morris, and, in one case, the
company's independent auditors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Urcarco said one suit accuses the company of concealing a
"serious liquidity crisis" from the public. The company said
that the other suit asserts that its financial statements
weren't prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles. The suits also challenge the company's
revenue and income recognition policies and the adequacy of
its allowance for loan losses. Each suit seeks class action
status, Urcarco said.</p>
<p>Describing the allegations of a liquidity crisis as
"groundless, frivolous and in bad faith," the company said it
currently has about $65 million in cash on hand and an
available bank line of credit of $45 million. The company
also said it has repeatedly reviewed its financial statements
and accounting policies with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and believes they are consistent with generally
accepted accounting principles.</p>
<p>"The company will vigorously defend these suits," the
company said.</p>
<p>Operating 17 car lots in Texas, Urcarco sells used cars to
people with credit problems, charging high interest rates on
the resulting loans. Since going public last November, the
company has frequently reported dramatic increases in
earnings and seen its stock triple in value, climbing to a
high of $25.50 last April. But the stock has tumbled since
then.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Urcarco
closed down 50 cents at $10.875.</p>
