	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Armed Services Committee approved
a $283 billion defense spending bill that guts the Pentagon's
top-priority strategic programs, shelves production of other
big-ticket weapons and cuts three times as many troops as
President Bush proposed.
   Reflecting intense bipartisan pressure to shrink military
spending in light of reduced U.S.-Soviet tensions, the
committee rejected additional purchases of B-2 Stealth
bombers, built by Northrop Corp. The panel also eliminated
all funds to begin deploying nuclear-tipped MX missiles on
special railroad cars, and it slashed funds for research on
the Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposed space-based
antimissile shield.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Proposed cuts in these three areas alone -- which include
the administration's most sought-after defense items --
account for nearly one quarter of the committee's overall $24
billion cut from Mr. Bush's military spending blueprint for
the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. The vote on the B-2 was
34-20, with nine Republicans voting to halt additional
purchases.</p>
<p>Even Republicans shied away from an all-out committee
battle to try to save the radar-eluding B-2 or mobile MX, for
instance, because support for both weapons is bleaker in the
full House. Funding for SDI, which the panel reduced to less
than $3 billion from the administration's $4.7 billion
request, is almost certain to face another round of proposed
cutbacks when the bill reaches the House floor in September,
when lawmakers return from their August recess.</p>
<p>"The bill reflects the changes in the world," said Rep.
John Kasich (R., Ohio). The committee's message, added Rep.
Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.), is that "we're not going to get
into a bidding war with the Soviets to see who is more macho
by spending more on defense."</p>
<p>After meeting behind closed doors for much of the day,
lawmakers also approved cutting 129,500 troops -- at least
50,000 of which are supposed to come from Europe -- from the
current 2.1 million active-duty force by the fall of 1991.
The administration had proposed trimming slightly more than
40,000 troops.</p>
<p>The committee's bill is bound to upset the Pentagon in
other ways, too. Reflecting lawmakers' often parochial
concerns to keep bases open and save local defense jobs, the
measure projects adding some 22,000 reservists to the force
in fiscal 1991. And, over the objections of Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney, lawmakers authorized some $400 million for
development and long-lead procurement of parts for the Marine
Corps' proposed V-22 tilt-rotor troop transport. The
administration tried but failed to kill the transport in last
year's budget.</p>
<p>The final version of the bill, in part, represents an
endorsement of Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.), who opposed
nearly all of the big-ticket items that were cut and worked
hard behind the scenes to cobble together bipartisan
compromises on other weapons. But in the process, Rep. Aspin
apparently traded away any chance to kill the V-22, shut down
all production lines for the Army's M-1 tank or begin phasing
out production of front-line F-15 Air Force fighters -- all
initiatives embraced by the administration and by Rep. Aspin
in the past.</p>
<p>The Senate, which is slated to complete action on its
version of the defense bill in the next few days, is bound to
be more generous than the House in supporting the B-2 bomber,
SDI and other administration priorities. But there, too,
political horsetrading is expected to keep alive certain
expensive programs the administration is eager to end.</p>
<p>As expected, the committee also shelved for the
foreseeable future production of the Army's proposed $42
billion fleet of LH helicopters, the Air Force's next
generation front-line fighters and the troubled C-17 cargo
planes. The new ground rules adopted by the panel, intended
to delay production of more than $120 billion of aircraft,
call for testing prototypes and completing engineering work
before deciding whether to begin full-rate production.</p>
<p>Although the LH has been the Army's most cherished weapons
program for years, opponents won a surprising 32-22 vote to
place it on hold. "The Army wanted to start bending metal
next year," said Rep. Larry Hopkins (R., Ky.), one of the
helicopter's leading critics. "But the LH is dead. There's no
doubt about that."</p>
<p>The committee also voted to postpone further purchases of
the Air Force's C-17, built by a McDonnell Douglas Corp.
unit. Rep. Albert G. Bustamante (D., Texas) said the
committee voted to withhold production funds until at least
1992, pending the results of C-17 flight tests.</p>
<p>The go-slow approach embraced by the panel also slashed
production funds from the Navy's carrier-based, A-12 attack
planes, which the Pentagon acknowledges have "serious
problems" meeting weight requirements and production
schedules. Moreover, lawmakers voted to withhold all of the
$1.32 billion in production money sought for the Air Force's
AMRAAM air-to-air missile. And the committee barred the
Pentagon from spending more than $2.7 billion of long-lead
production money until Congress receives the detailed
five-year spending plan required by law.</p>
