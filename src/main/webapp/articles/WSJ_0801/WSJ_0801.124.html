	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- GPU Nuclear Corp. said it will pay a $50,000
fine imposed by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission for
a 1987 incident in which a control room shift supervisor at a
Three Mile Island nuclear reactor unit was found sleeping on
duty.
   The utility, a subsidiary of General Public Utilities
Corp., Parsippany, N.J., said the NRC confirmed the findings
of a 1987 company investigation that led to the dismissal of
the shift supervisor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although the commission said its investigation found that
prompt and thorough action was taken by the company to
prevent a recurrence, it levied the fine because the incident
wasn't dealt with adequately by site managers.</p>
<p>The company said a site manager, who was slow to act and
allowed the shift supervisor's behavior to go uncorrected for
months, was dismissed.</p>
<p>The company said an internal investigation began after
people at the unit sent anonymous notes to top managers
accusing the shift supervisor of sleeping on the job.</p>
<p>The utility said the incident occurred while damaged fuel
was being removed from the Three Mile Island Unit 2 reactor
vessel. That work was completed last January, the company
said.</p>
<p>In 1979, a reactor cooling system failed, allowing
radioactive water to flood the Three Mile Island nuclear
power plant near Harrisburg, Pa. It was one of the nation's
worst nuclear power plant accidents.</p>
