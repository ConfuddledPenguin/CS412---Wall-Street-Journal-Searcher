	<p class="article-leader">UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. -- MCA Inc., whose foibles in the
toy business seemed behind it earlier this year with the sale
of its toy operation to Acclaim Entertainment Inc., has once
again found that the business isn't all child's play.
   The big entertainment concern said yesterday that it
agreed with Acclaim on several measures that, combined,
appear to reverse a substantial portion of the earlier sale
of MCA's LJN Toys Ltd. unit for an estimated price of about
$30 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The settlement calls for MCA to take back some assets of
LJN, including both receivables and inventory. As well, MCA
agreed to pay Acclaim $1 million in cash and up to $2 million
of its Acclaim stock, representing a portion of a stake MCA
received in April with the sale of LJN.</p>
<p>In addition, MCA agreed to share with Acclaim part of the
proceeds from the future sale of MCA's remaining stake in
Acclaim.</p>
<p>For its part, Oyster Bay, N.Y.-based Acclaim, one of the
largest licensees for Nintendo computer games, agreed to lift
restrictions on the 1.2 million shares of Acclaim stock held
by MCA, freeing MCA to sell those shares.</p>
<p>Officials of both companies say MCA is expected to return
about 180,000 shares of stock to Acclaim, leaving MCA with a
little over a million shares.</p>
<p>An MCA official said MCA will sell "substantially all" of
its remaining shares in a secondary offering tied to a
currently planned offering of two million new shares of
Acclaim. Acclaim currently has about 18.7 million shares
outstanding, including the shares issued to MCA.</p>
<p>According to Gregory E. Fischbach, chairman and chief
executive officer of Acclaim, differences between the two
companies arose when two sets of accountants poured over the
assets with very different views of their values.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Fischbach nor Richard Baker, vice president
and controller of MCA, would discuss the value or details of
the inventory and receivables returned to MCA.</p>
