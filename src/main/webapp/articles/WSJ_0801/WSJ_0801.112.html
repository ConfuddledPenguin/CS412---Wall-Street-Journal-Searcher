	<p class="article-leader">Continued skittishness toward biotechnology stocks helped
fuel another decline in over-the-counter shares.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.14 to 438.24, a 0.3%
decline, as volume rose to 135.2 million shares from 120.4
million Monday. Declining stocks again outpaced advancers,
1,034 to 912.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sharply falling dollar helped boost the prices of
over-the-counter foreign issues traded as American depositary
receipts. The Nasdaq ADR index of about 40 issues rose 1.88
to 154.96, as L.M. Ericcson Telephone jumped 9 1/2 to 231,
Reuters Holdings climbed 5/8 to 59 and Cadbury Schweppes
gained 1 to 64 1/2.</p>
<p>On the other hand, continued selling in computer-related
and biotechnology shares pushed the Nasdaq 100 index down
1.07 to 445.77 and the Nasdaq Industrial index down 1.06 to
472.81. The Nasdaq Financial and insurance indexes both
posted slight gains.</p>
<p>The choppy market continued to reflect caution among
dealers wary of earnings disappointments and other surprises.
Ralph Costanza, director of trading at Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co., attributed the volatile market to "dealers
wanting to be tight, lean and mean."</p>
<p>"Everyone is cost-conscious around the Street," Mr.
Costanza explained. "No one wants to get caught with big
positions" in stocks, he said. Institutions and small
investors have been relatively inactive in recent days, he
added.</p>
<p>Biotechnology stocks dominated the day's activity amid
news from a meeting this week of a Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee reviewing the products of
several companies.</p>
<p>Trading in Immunex mirrored Monday's wild swings in Cetus.
Immunex traded as high as 34 and as low as 26 1/2 before
closing at 27, down 4, after the FDA panel declined to
approve the company's GM-CSF product to treat graft failure
in bone marrow transplants. Dow Jones Professional Investor
Report said that the committee recommended that testing of
the product be expanded, but didn't allow the company to go
ahead and earn a profit on sales of the product.</p>
<p>Cetus, the day's most active stock, tumbled 3 3/4 to 10
3/8 on 7.3 million shares after the FDA panel Monday
postponed making a recommendation about the use of the
company's interleukin-2 product for the treatment of advanced
kidney cancer.</p>
<p>Among other analysts, Lehman Brothers analyst Teena L.
Lerner cut her investment opinion on Cetus to "sell" from
"attractive," according to Mitch Meisler, executive vice
president of OTC trading at Lehman. Among other biotechnology
shares, Amgen fell 1 3/8 to 86 1/4, Genetics Institute
dropped 1 1/4 to 34 1/4 and Chiron fell 5/8 to 39 1/4. Ms.
Lerner recommended buying those three shares on weakness,
according to Mr. Meisler.</p>
<p>One biotechnology stock stood out among the others. Biogen
jumped 3 1/8 to 26 3/4 after an FDA panel yesterday
recommended approval of alpha-interferon for an additional
use in treating chronic cases of certain types of hepatitis.
Biogen, of Cambridge, Mass., developed the drug, which is
marketed in partnership with Schering-Plough Corp. Morgan
Stanley & Co. biotechnology analyst Michael Sorrell told
DJPIR he repeated his "buy" opinion on the stock yesterday.</p>
<p>Buy-out news fueled a 1 1/4-point jump in UTL Corp. to 4
5/8. Boeing Co. said its wholly owned ARGOSystems unit will
make a $4.75-a-share cash tender offer for the Dallas maker
of electronic warfare systems.</p>
<p>Takeover speculation also helped fuel the 9 1/2-point rise
in L.M. Ericsson ADRs, according to DJPIR. Shearson Lehman
telecommunications analyst Maria F. Lewis suggested the
issues might have risen in takeover speculation after this
newspaper reported that Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. is interested in
expanding its ties with West Germany's Siemens AG as part of
its expansion into the European market.</p>
<p>Check Technology climbed 1/2 to 4 after the St. Paul,
Minn., provider of computerized check-printing services
reported net income for the third quarter ended June 30
jumped to 17 cents a share from five cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>A new issue, Allied Clinical Laboratories, closed
unchanged at 13 on nearly 1.1 million shares. A 1.7
million-share offering of the operator of regional clinical
testing laboratories was made late Monday at $13 a share.</p>
<p>Hologic skidded 2 1/4 to 24 1/4 after the Waltham, Mass.,
maker of specialized X-ray systems said it doesn't expect to
maintain its rate of growth in the fiscal fourth quarter
because of seasonal variations in order rates from Europe.
Hologic also reported net income for the third quarter ended
June 30 rose to 19 cents a share from 14 cents a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Employers Casualty stumbled 7/8 to 3 3/4 after the Dallas
insurer raised its reserves by $100.6 million, reflected in a
loss for the first six months ended June 30 of $9.40 a share,
compared with a loss of $1.60 in the first six months of
1989. For the second quarter, the company reported a loss
$8.49 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $2.15.
Employers Casualty said the major portion of the reserve
increase is for liability losses, including claims made many
years after the policies providing coverage were written.</p>
<p>National Data dropped 1 1/4 to 13 after the Atlanta
provider of billing and other computer services reported a
loss for the fourth quarter ended May 31 of $1.32 a share,
compared with year-earlier net income of 53 cents a share.
The recent loss included charges totaling $19.6 million,
including a $10.7 million restructuring charge.</p>
<p>Mentor Graphics fell 1 to 15 1/4 on 1.3 million shares
after analysts met with the Beaverton, Ore., maker of
electronic design automation systems, DJPIR said.</p>
<p>Hambrecht & Quist analyst Robert G. Herwick, who repeated
an "aggressive buy" opinion on Mentor, said the stock
stumbled after company officials indicated Monday that
third-quarter results might be hurt if Hewlett-Packard
doesn't deliver a new workstation by the end of August. There
appears to be "some risk, but not overwhelming," that Mentor
might miss its August shipment of electronic design
automation systems, which use the workstations, because of
the Hewlett-Packard delay, Mr. Herwick told DJPIR.</p>
<p>However, the analyst said he expects Mentor to rebound
next year after being "marginally profitable" in this year's
third and fourth quarters. Dean Witter Reynolds analyst
Timothy R. McCollum agreed the company's near-term outlook is
"dicey," while saying he's "very positive" on its longer term
prospects.</p>
<p>Among other active technology issues, Intel rose 1 1/8 to
44 1/2; Microsoft fell 1 1/2 to 66 1/2; and Apple Computer
eased 3/8 to 42.</p>

<p>NEW MARKET-MAKING SYMBOL: Shearson Lehman Hutton, which
today officially changes its name to Shearson Lehman
Brothers, also is changing the symbol it uses to make markets
in OTC stocks to "LEHM" from "SAXP." The brokerage firm is
the largest market maker in OTC stocks.</p>
