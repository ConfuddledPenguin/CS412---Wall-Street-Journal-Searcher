	<p class="article-leader">Brooklyn Union Gas Co., New York, said an administrative
law judge recommended that it be allowed a $40.4 million rate
increase, which would be the utility's first rate gain in
five years.
   The increase, to take effect in October, would reflect a
12% return on equity. Brooklyn Union Gas had sought a $49
million increase, reflecting a 13.2% return on equity, to
cover increased maintenance and other expenses. The utility
has until Aug. 14 to challenge Judge Edward D. Cohen's
recommendation before the New York State Public Service
Commission, which is expected to make a final decision by
October.</p>
