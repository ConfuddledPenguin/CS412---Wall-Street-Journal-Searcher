	<p class="article-leader">Scientists said they are on the trail of a gene that
increases the risk of developing lung cancer, particularly
for smokers.
   If the gene can be found, tests could be developed that
could tell which smokers are likely to die of lung cancer
early in life and which might resist the disease until late
in life or never contract it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Two newly published research reports are the firmest proof
yet that a susceptibility to lung cancer can be passed from
generation to generation, and may explain why lung cancer is
relatively common in some families.</p>
<p>"Cigarette smoking is unequivocally the most important
reason why most Americans are struck with this disease," said
Neil E. Caporaso, a researcher at the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md. and lead investigator of one of
the studies. "Yet, scientists have puzzled over why some
smokers get cancer and others don't, why only one in eight
smokers gets the disease. Genetic factors may explain why."</p>
<p>The researchers haven't identified the culprit gene, nor
do they expect to find it immediately. But their reports
shine a bright light as to where other scientists should
look, and are expected to trigger a race among molecular
biologists to find a lung-cancer susceptibility gene as part
of the world-wide effort to map the human genome, the
collection of all human genes.</p>
<p>Lawyers on both sides of the tobacco liability issue
predicted that the new research on the origins of cancer
could have an impact on tobacco liability suits. But both
sides said that the new findings could help their arguments.</p>
<p>Tobacco manufacturers have routinely argued that
scientists have failed to prove a direct biological
connection between smoking and lung cancer. Some attorneys
who represent tobacco companies suggested that new evidence
that some people are genetically predisposed to developing
cancer will further bolster their case by casting further
doubt on the origins of disease.</p>
<p>But Marc Edell, a New Jersey attorney who represents
plaintiffs in tobacco liability suits, said the findings
won't be damaging to plaintiffs. If anything, Mr. Edell said,
the notion that some consumers might be more vulnerable to
disease could mean that manufacturers would be required to
add tougher labels to packages and advertising. "This would
make it more important than ever for manufacturers to warn
consumers specifically about the risks they face," he said.</p>
<p>NCI officials are concerned that the findings may lead
some to believe it may be safe for people without the gene to
smoke. They note cigarette smoking also causes heart disease
and emphysema.</p>
<p>"It's our belief that everyone who smokes has some risk of
cancer," says Curt Harris, chief of the NCI's laboratory of
human carcinogenesis. "We think the gene research will point
out who has a higher, perhaps even much higher, risk than
normal."</p>
<p>The new research appears in the most recent issue of the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute. In one report,
scientists at Louisiana State University Medical Center in
New Orleans and at Albert Einstein College in New York say
that by studying the occurrence of lung cancer in over 300
southern Louisiana families, they found that the disease
struck within the families as if due to a single inheritable
gene.</p>
<p>The researchers, led by Thomas A. Sellers, compared the
disease pattern in three generations of these families with
the random rate of lung cancer in a similar number of
Louisiana families. The cancer families had been gathered
between 1976 and 1979, and in 1981, Mr. Sellers, a graduate
student, began analyzing the disease using new computer
programs.</p>
<p>The analysis strongly suggests that inheriting a
particular gene sharply raises the likelihood of getting lung
cancer for smokers and nonsmokers. The study found that a
person who inherits two copies of the culprit gene -- one
from each parent -- and doesn't smoke has a 14% chance of
getting the cancer by age 50. That risk jumps to 27% by age
50 if the person was a heavy smoker.</p>
<p>Inheriting just one copy of the gene, a more likely
occurrence for most people, raises the risk of cancer, but
mostly for cigarette smokers. At age 50, a nonsmoker with one
copy of the gene has practically no risk at all. But for a
heavy smoker that risk rises to 5% by age 50, to 16% by age
60, and to 25% by age 70. By age 60 a heavy smoker with one
copy of the gene is 6.5 times more likely to get lung cancer
than a heavy smoker without the gene.</p>
<p>George E. Bonney, a geneticist at Howard University in
Washington and an expert in analyzing gene patterns in
families, writes in an accompanying article in the NCI
journal that the sample size of the study is "so large" that
findings are "unlikely to be false." Mr. Sellers, now at
University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, says researchers are
collecting blood from family members in an effort to locate
the offending gene in the families' DNA, or genetic material.</p>
<p>In a second report in the same issue of the journal,
scientists at the cancer institute point to a particular gene
as the possible culprit. In a study led by Mr. Caporaso,
researchers say they found that some people inherit a genetic
trait that makes them more likely to activate cancer-causing
chemicals contained in cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>The scientists found that people who quickly metabolize,
or process, a blood pressure drug called debrisoquine seem to
have a six times higher risk of lung cancer than people who
process the drug slowly. In 1984, some scientists suggested
that the drug might provide a clue to inheriting a
susceptibility to cancer when they found that certain people
who took the drug passed out, meaning large amounts of
processed drug reached the brain. By studying numerous
families, the researchers found that the "fast metabolizing"
characteristic occurred as if due to a single inherited gene.</p>
<p>The NCI scientists compared the occurrence of this
metabolizing trait in lung cancer patients with its
occurrence in a random sample of smokers. Their analysis
showed a strong link between the trait, lung cancer and
smoking. Scientists already know that a particular enzyme is
responsible for processing the drug, and that the enzyme is
produced in cells by a gene located on chromosome 22. There
are 23 matched pairs of chromosomes in every cell.</p>
<p>"What we think is either this gene or a gene located near
it on chromosome 22 also processes one of the many
carcinogens contained in cigarette smoke," Mr. Caporaso says.</p>
<p>Mr. Harris of the NCI says that scientists in Switzerland
are working on a test that could detect the presence of the
enzyme gene in people's blood. "A smoker who has this gene
might want to take periodic chest X-rays," he says. "Lung
cancer is treatable if caught early."</p>
<p>Mr. Harris says the latest gene finding suggests that as
many as five or 10 genes are involved in the development of
lung cancer. Some of the genes may be inherited, and some may
be damaged, perhaps by chemicals in cigarette smoke.</p>
