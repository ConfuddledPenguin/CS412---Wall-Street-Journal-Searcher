	<p class="article-leader">The Commodity Futures Trading Commission charged a
commodity pool operator linked to Chicago Board of Trade
Chairman Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann with misusing investor
funds.
   Mr. Mahlmann wasn't charged with wrongdoing by the CFTC.
But the commission charges are the latest in a series of
blows to his credibility during the past few weeks. His reign
as the most powerful officer of the world's largest futures
exchange is over, even if he remains in office until his
fourth one-year term expires at year end, exchange members
say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The CFTC charged in its complaint that the pool operator,
Stotler Funds Inc., violated anti-fraud laws by effectively
making $5.55 million in loans from two pools to its parent
firm, Stotler Group Inc. That money represented customer
funds that the investors in the pools were told via
disclosure documents would be invested in commodities, the
agency charged.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahlmann is a director of Stotler Funds and chairman
of financially troubled Stotler Group, as well as its largest
shareholder. Neither Mr. Mahlmann nor other Stotler officers,
including Stotler Group's chief executive officer, Thomas
Egan, have returned repeated calls for comment.</p>
<p>The CFTC is seeking a temporary restraining order from a
federal judge in Chicago, where Stotler is based, and is
asking for the appointement of a receiver "to protect the
customer funds in the pool," said CFTC enforcement director
Dennis Klejna.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahlmann's effectiveness as an exchange leader has
been crippled by his Stotler ties. The collapse last month of
Stotler Group's Stotler & Co. unit, which has been forced to
pull out of futures trading for lack of capital, has
tarnished the reputation of the Board of Trade and the
futures industry at a time of increased congressional concern
about lax futures industry oversight, CBOT members say.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahlmann can't escape being tarred by Stotler & Co.'s
failure. His defenders note that he has spent most of his
time on exchange activities while CBOT chairman, leaving the
day-to-day management of Stotler to other firm officials. But
a senior executive of one CBOT member firm said, "He is still
chairman of the company. He looks bad if he didn't know what
was going on, and he looks worse if he did."</p>
<p>Mr. Mahlmann, 52 years old, will be consumed by regulatory
concerns surrounding Stotler for months to come. Futures and
securities regulators continue to pore over Stotler & Co.
financial records and those of Stotler Group, which is on the
brink of insolvency. Regulators say it is almost certain that
disciplinary action will be taken against Stotler and
possibly some of its officers relating to events surrounding
Stotler & Co.'s collapse.</p>
<p>Stotler Group's borrowing from customer funds also may to
be referred to the U.S. attorney's office in Chicago for
possible criminal prosecution, said an officer of the
National Futures Association, a futures industry-financed
regulator. The disclosure of the borrowing from the funds has
already prompted calls from futures regulators for tougher
oversight of intercompany transactions to protect the rapidly
growing managed funds segment of the futures industry.</p>
<p>The CFTC said Stotler Group received a loan of $1 million
from one of the pools, Advanced Portfolio Management, that
equaled about 10% of the fund's assets. And $4.55 million of
Stotler Group commercial paper was purchased by the other
pool, Compass Futures Fund Inc. The commercial paper
transaction was "in effect" a loan equal to about 80% of that
fund's assets, the CFTC said.</p>
<p>Last week Stotler Funds halted redemptions to fund
investors, telling them that Stotler Group had defaulted on
$260,000 in commercial paper payments. Stotler Group
disclosed last week that it defaulted on a total of $750,000
in commercial paper payments and may not be able to make $7.6
million in debt payments due in 30 days.</p>
<p>Late Monday the CBOT's board unanimously reaffirmed its
support for Mr. Mahlmann as its chairman, despite the events
surrounding Stotler. But Mr. Mahlmann's lack of detailed
knowledge about Stotler's activities, even though he has
spent the past three weeks trying to salvage its futures
operations, became apparent during the CBOT board meeting
Monday, say individuals familiar with the meeting. Mr.
Mahlmann told the directors that he had just learned of
Stotler Group's borrowings from certain customer funds hours
before the Monday meeting, the individuals said.</p>
<p>Directors said they had to read Tuesday morning news
accounts to learn the amount of the borrowing and the names
of the funds involved.</p>
<p>"You can bet there were some raised eyebrows around here
after we read the papers," said one CBOT officer.</p>
<p>A letter distributed to exchange members yesterday from
the board pointed out that Stotler's funds aren't directly
regulated by the exchange.</p>
<p>The letter also appeared to be intended to assure members
that the exchange had acted responsibly in handling Stotler's
cash crisis. Some members have asserted that the exchange
might have more aggressively monitored Stotler's activities
in recent years if Mr. Mahlmann hadn't been exchange
chairman.</p>
<p>"This is being called a whitewash on the floor," grumbled
one member about the board's letter.</p>
<p>Despite the generally reassuring tone of the letter, the
board disclosed that Stotler & Co. had operated with
regulatory capital below a key industry benchmark since
September 1987. The letter said Stotler's capital was less
than 7% of segregated customer funds since that time, which
meant the company couldn't withdraw any equity capital.
Futures brokerage firms can be forced out of business if
their net capital falls below 4% of segregated customer
funds.</p>
<p>After regulators disallowed an intercompany funds transfer
of about $13 million from Stotler & Co. to Stotler Group
early last month, Stotler & Co.'s net capital fell below the
4% level. After failing to line up an emergency cash infusion
of $10 million, Stotler & Co. said it was transferring all
customer accounts to other firms and leaving the futures
brokerage business.</p>
