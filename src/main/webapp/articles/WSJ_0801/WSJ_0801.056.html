	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- ITT Corp. said its board has approved a plan
to purchase additional shares of its common and preferred, up
to an equivalent of 10 million common shares. The shares will
be purchased on the open market.
   The new authorization is an extension of a program
announced in April 1987, allowing the company to purchase up
to an equivalent of 10 million common shares. In March 1988,
the board authorized the purchase of an additional five
million common shares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In June, ITT said it intended to use the majority of the
proceeds from the sale of 7% of Alcatel N.V. to buy back
stock. Compagnie Generale d'Electricite of France paid ITT
$640 million for the Alcatel shares. Alcatel is a
telecommunications manufacturing joint venture between ITT
and CGE.</p>
<p>"We continue to believe that ITT shares are an excellent
buy in the stock market today," said Rand V. Araskog,
chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>To date, the company has bought back about 14.5 million
common shares. ITT also purchased 11.7 million common shares
in connection with the formation of an employee stock
ownership plan established in 1989. Also, the company has
redeemed 1.2 million common equivalent shares of convertible
preferred stock since 1987. This brings the total number of
shares repurchased or redeemed to over 27 million shares.</p>
