	<p class="article-leader">TORRANCE, Calif. -- Ashton-Tate Corp. began shipping a new
version of its flagship dBASE IV software package, which
industry observers said should enable the software maker to
reverse a yearlong decline in its revenue and regain lost
share in the database market.
   "This shores things up," said Jeffrey Tartar, editor of
Softletter, an industry newsletter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, the release of the new dBASE IV, the most widely
used database application for personal computers, isn't
likely to restore Ashton-Tate to the prominence it enjoyed
during the mid-1980s. "For real excitement, Ashton-Tate must
get out quality products consistently," said Adam Green, a
database consultant in Lexington, Mass. Rejuvenation "isn't a
matter of selling a single product."</p>
<p>Shortcomings with the initial version of dBASE IV,
introduced nearly two years ago, forced Ashton-Tate to
promise delivery of a revamped version. But the revisions
proved so difficult to make that last year the company
stopped predicting when it would finish the job. Even now the
company will only say the product has been "thoroughly
tested." Users who have tested it say it is reliable.</p>
<p>"Unlike {the first} dBASE IV, this one is going to work as
advertised," said Michael Masterson, president of the Silicon
Valley dBASE Users Group. The program is a programmable
application that stores and retrieves data according to the
user's requirements.</p>
<p>Ashton-Tate plans to give a free copy of the new version
to every registered owner of dBASE IV, which lists for $795.
The company yesterday also released a version of dBASE to run
on minicomputers made by Digital Equipment Corp., which plans
to offer the product with its machines.</p>
