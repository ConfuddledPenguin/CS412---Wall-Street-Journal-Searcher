	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Burdened by expectations of lower U.S.
interest rates and a slowing economy, the dollar continued
its steady descent toward a record low against the mark.
   In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.5869
marks, well below 1.6041 marks late Monday. The U.S. currency
also fell to 145.80 yen from 147.83 yen Monday. Meanwhile,
the British pound rose to $1.8640 from $1.8470.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted
at 146 yen; it closed in Tokyo Tuesday at 147.50 yen.
Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5893
marks, down from Tokyo's Tuesday close of 1.6075 marks.</p>
<p>In intraday trading yesterday, the dollar slipped as low
as 1.5850 marks, just above its post-World War II low of
1.5615 marks set Jan. 4, 1988, according to records at the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p>
<p>Interest rates abroad have been rising recently to the
point where they are comparable to or even higher than U.S.
rates. That situation lowers the allure of dollar-denominated
investments to speculators and international investors.</p>
<p>In addition, the dollar is being pulled down by the large
U.S. budget and trade deficits, as well as the growing cost
of the savings-and-loan bailout.</p>
<p>Traders said that yesterday's fall accelerated when the
dollar fell through the 1.60-mark level, an important support
level on charts that many traders use to forecast currency
movements. Trading was relatively thin, however.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the dollar could bounce back by the end of
August to around 1.6045 marks, according to the average
forecasts in a recent poll of 10 economists and foreign
exchange traders in New York, London, Frankfurt and Tokyo. By
the end of October, the dollar is expected to firm further to
1.6085 marks, according to the average forecast.</p>
<p>Against its Japanese counterpart, the dollar is expected
to be slightly stronger at 148.03 yen at the end of August
and 148.30 yen at the end of October.</p>
<p>The rebound won't be especially vigorous because of the
same factors that were at work in the market yesterday and
recently. A further easing of U.S. monetary policy isn't
expected to occur in August, said the majority of experts
surveyed by Dow Jones International News Service, and the
dollar is expected to benefit slightly in the short term from
continuing instability in the Soviet Union, higher oil prices
and a likely technical rebound in reaction to the currency's
recent drop.</p>
<p>Unification euphoria continues to make dollar-mark rate
forecasts tenuous, many survey participants said. For the
third month in a row, the consensus calls for a stronger
dollar against the mark -- but the June and July forecasts
for the U.S. currency proved far too optimistic.</p>
<p>A month ago, when the dollar was trading around 1.6607
marks and 152.10 yen, a similar monthly survey foresaw the
dollar firmer at 1.6910 marks and 154.30 yen by the end of
July. At the beginning of May, the average forecasts for the
dollar's end-of-July levels were 1.70 marks and 158.88 yen.</p>
<p>Traders said yesterday that further increases in the yen
could be delayed by problems in the Tokyo stock market as
well as rising oil prices. Japan is wholly dependent on
imports of oil, which are priced in dollars.</p>
<p>Irwin Kellner, senior vice president and chief economist
at Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York, said trade-based
logic would dictate a stronger dollar at this point. The U.S.
trade surplus with Western Europe was about $811.6 million in
Maythe latest month for which data are available -- and $1.36
billion in April. Fundamentally, that balance portends a
steady demand for dollars needed to purchase U.S. goods.</p>
<p>The moves of the past few days "obviously make the mark
even more overvalued," said Mr. Kellner. Political and
psychological factors are conspiring to keep the mark as
strong as it is, he insisted.</p>
<p>Hard economic data in support of a stronger mark are in
fact scarce. The West German Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden last week said it doesn't expect reliable East
German cost-of-living data until the end of 1990.</p>
<p>Hartmut Voges, a dealer at Norddeutsche
Landesbank-Girozentrale, said he believes the dollar will
rebound against the mark.</p>
<p>"The U.S. economic data aren't all that good, but when you
look at purchasing power parity, for example, I can't really
imagine new lows for the dollar," Mr. Voges said.</p>
<p>Geoffrey Dennis, chief international economist at James
Capel & Co. in London, was also bullish on the dollar despite
expectations of a quarter-percentage-point decline in U.S.
interest rates. "The downside scope for U.S. rates is small,"
he reasoned, as there is little chance President Bush and the
Congress will agree on a credible federal deficit reduction
package. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has said
such a package is a prerequisite for a further easing of
monetary policy.</p>
<p>Several survey participants said anticipation of higher
oil prices after last week's Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries midyear meeting also will tend to keep
the dollar firm against the mark and yen.</p>
<p>Most dollar-mark rate forecasts hinge on whether the
market has overreacted to the smooth beginning of German
unification.</p>
<p>Most respondents predicted the dollar will remain firm
against the mark in August without making strong gains. Only
two people said the dollar would trade for less than 1.60
marks at the end of either period. Forecasts ranged from a
low of 1.58 marks to a high of 1.65 marks by the end of
August. End-of-October forecasts ranged from 1.55 marks to
1.67 marks.</p>
<p>In the longer term, many of the survey's participants
predict a further weakening of the U.S. economy, increasing
the likelihood that the Federal Reserve will loosen monetary
policy and damage the attractiveness of dollar-denominated
bonds.</p>
<p>Michael Rosenberg, vice president and manager of the
international fixed-income research group at Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets, said that company's quarterly investor
survey shows investors are "warming up to the yen and turning
cold on the dollar."</p>
<p>Yoichi Itoh, chief corporate service officer for Sumitomo
Trust & Banking Co. in Tokyo, said a cheaper dollar would
help U.S. exports and manufacturers when the economy
threatens to slow to a standstill.</p>
<p>Mr. Itoh also said that with the approach of U.S.
congressional elections in November, the administration will
be eager to keep the economy growing. "If the U.S. gets into
even a modest recession this year, for political reasons
they'll have to soften their stance on fiscal policy or
decrease interest rates substantially," he said.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $370.00 an ounce, up $2.20. Estimated
volume was a moderate three million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted
at $370.65 an ounce.</p>
