	<p class="article-leader">PORTLAND, Maine -- One Bancorp reported a second-quarter
net loss of $29.8 million, scuttled a preferred stock
offering and said it hasn't had acceptable offers for
Connecticut and Massachusetts subsidiaries that it had agreed
to sell in a pact with regulators.
   The second-quarter results include a $15.5 million
provision for loan losses, loss of interest income on bad
commercial loans and an adjustment of $6.2 million to the
company's investment in Southstate Bank for Savings, which
has been offered for sale, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The $29.8 million loss, equal to $3.63 a share, compares
with a loss of $10.5 million, or $1.28 a share, in the 1989
second quarter.</p>
<p>One Bancorp's nonperforming assets rose during the second
quarter by $7 million to $297 million, a sign that growth of
nonperforming assets is stabilizing, the company said.
First-quarter additions to nonperforming assets were $15
million, following an average increase of $40 million a
quarter for all of 1989.</p>
<p>In partial accordance with the plan, the company said it
reduced its total assets to $2.2 billion at June 30, down
from $2.3 billion at year-end. The company must still sell
its Bank of Hartford and Southstate units, retire $36 million
of convertible debentures, restructure nonperforming assets
and sell foreclosed real estate.</p>
<p>One Bancorp said it is committed to injecting additional
funds into its Maine Savings unit, but that the ability to
make these required capital infusions "is dependent entirely"
on the sale of the Connecticut and Massachusetts units. The
company said it hasn't been able to get the aggregate selling
price of $55 million for the two units and that appraisals
indicate that the fair market value of the units is now $42.2
million, less than called for in the plan.</p>
<p>Vincent E. Furey, president and chief executive, said in a
statement that preservation of any value in the holding
company's securities will not be possible unless it can
substantially reduce its nonperforming assets and restore
Maine Savings capital to required levels in a time frame
acceptable to savings regulators.</p>
<p>He said, however, that it is "highly unlikely, given
current market conditions, that the company will be able to
satisfy all of the requirements of the capital plan" signed
in January with regulators. The company's ability to continue
as a going concern "will therefore depend upon the level of
progress it can show in meeting the goals of the capital plan
and the willingness of its regulators to grant the holding
company additional time."</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, One
Bancorp closed at 44 cents a share, down 12.5 cents.</p>
