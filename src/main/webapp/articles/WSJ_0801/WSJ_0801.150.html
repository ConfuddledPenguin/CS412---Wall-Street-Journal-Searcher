	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK (AP) -- Grossinger's Hotel and Country Club, the
Catskill Mountains retreat where Rocky Marciano trained and
Eddie Fisher launched his career, has filed for bankruptcy,
the hotel's trustee said.
   A voluntary Chapter 11 reorganization petition filed in
December by Grossinger's in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in White
Plains, N.Y., was converted to a Chapter 7 petition
yesterday, said the hotel's court-appointed trustee, Barbara
Balliber-Strauss.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ms. Balliber-Strauss declined to discuss details of the
action, but said the hotel and its contents will likely be
liquidated under the Chapter 7 petition.</p>
<p>Grossinger's registered its first guests in 1914 and was
run by the Grossinger family for 71 years. Losing money, the
sprawling resort was sold in 1985 by the family to a group of
New York City investors for $9 million.</p>
<p>The tudor-style resort in Sullivan County, about 120 miles
northwest of New York City, has been empty since 1986 when it
was closed for a multimillion dollar renovation and
expansion.</p>
<p>The halls are lined with black-and-white photographs of
famous guests, fighters who trained there and entertainers
who performed there, including Jack Dempsey and Lucille Ball.</p>
