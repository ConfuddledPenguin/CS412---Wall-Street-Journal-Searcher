	<p class="article-leader">NEW KENSINGTON, Pa. -- In this battered old factory town
lives a rare breed of moguls. They work out of a trailer.
They have power lunches at Eat n' Park. Their machines
predate World War II. They type their own letters, and they
clean up after themselves.
   Their company? Alcoa -- the world's largest aluminum
producer. Aluminum Co. of America hopes that by freeing these
workers from the shackles of bureaucracy (and the lap of
luxury), and by letting them work in their own small unit, it
will tap the entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The unit's task: to create a market for Arall, a recently
developed sheet metal. Arall combines aluminum and fiber to
create a material that is 30% stronger than aluminum and 35%
lighter. Trouble is, it's also three to four times more
expensive. The material holds great promise for the aerospace
industry, Alcoa believes, but profits may not come for 10
years, if at all.</p>
<p>Alcoa's experiment is bucking the odds. Large
corporations' attempts to foster "intrapreneurship" --
capturing the zeal of small business owners within large
organizations -- have often failed miserably.</p>
<p>Alcoa's only other effort, in the lighting business,
nearly drowned in red ink. It started to show profits only
after Alcoa bailed it out with more money and tightened
controls. Studies suggest that such ventures fail most often
because they lack autonomy and separate facilities or get
otherwise tangled in the bureaucracy of their corporate
parents.</p>
<p>The trick is getting managers to "operate more on gut
feelings and natural abilities than thinking about what
someone's going to say," says Cindy Iannarelli, training
coordinator at the University of Pittsburgh's Small Business
Development Center.</p>
<p>Alcoa thinks its Arall Laminates unit fits the bill. Arall
employees have their own facility and set their own hours,
typically working on weekends and until 8 p.m. in the
evening. And Alcoa is content to leave them alone -- as long
as they keep the red ink at a trickle.</p>
<p>The aluminum maker owns the exclusive international
license to produce the material, protecting the intrapreneurs
from most competition. And the technology is brand new,
giving the Arall makers a more authentic start-up feeling.</p>
<p>Sandy Nelson, vice president of Alcoa and general manager
of its steel and plate division, thinks the intrapreneurial
format is right for the product. He says Alcoa's larger
divisions would have been too preoccupied to nurse the infant
Arall. "The interference of other products would diminish the
emphasis on Arall," he says. But that's not a problem for
Arall's current makers. "They're a highly energetic team with
a very narrow focus," he says. "That's a powerful
combination."</p>
<p>Mr. Nelson also thinks Arall's fatigue resistance -- a hot
item in the aerospace industry -- will help the unit succeed
where others have failed. "There's a great market
opportunity," he says.</p>
<p>Dutch Prof. Bood Vogelesang invented the material in the
late 1970s for Akzo, the Dutch chemical concern. Akzo sold
Alcoa production rights to the material in 1985. (Akzo has
since had second thoughts, and is now discussing a joint
venture with Alcoa.)</p>
<p>Alcoa let the material sit in its New Kensington research
lab for three years. It wasn't eager to plunge into
production of a material that didn't yet have a market.</p>
<p>The company would have had to spend about $100 million to
bring the new product to market, with no guarantee that it
would succeed. "You have a long, long incubation time," says
Alcoa's Mr. Nelson. It looked as if Arall might die on the
drawing board.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, William Evancho, former head of Alcoa's
steamship division, was bored with his job in the New
Kensington lab. He persuaded Mr. Nelson that he could turn
Arall into a business without spending too much money. Alcoa
gave him a little cash and a lot of latitude.</p>
<p>In January 1988, he took a 29-year-old engineer, Michael
Gregory, as his marketing director and went to find a market
for Arall. Mr. Evancho thinks he can turn Arall into a $100
million-a-year business. But even if he fails, Alcoa won't
have wasted much more than the $20 million it has invested so
far.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old Mr. Evancho isn't a traditional
entrepreneur: His money isn't on the line. But his career
could be. If the project takes off, he will climb several
notches on Alcoa's corporate ladder. If it fails? "I don't
have a job," says Mr. Evancho. "And I have eight kids." Mr.
Evancho says he'd like his pay to eventually be based on
Arall's performance -- though he'd rather wait until the
product starts showing a profit.</p>
<p>Messrs. Evancho and Gregory say they run the business as
if it were their own. At their trailer offices, neckties are
optional. When employees take a cup of coffee, they are asked
to contribute coins to a coffee fund. They put in long hours
at the factory, which looks like a sparse, open hangar. The
machinery itself looks as if it came from a rummage sale:
State-of-the-art control panels operate 1940 heavy machinery.</p>
<p>The two savor their freedom from the Alcoa bureaucracy.
"We're the Oakland Raiders of Alcoa," says Mr. Gregory. Adds
Mr. Evancho: "Sometimes we're the Bad News Bears." They wear
nicknames on their hardhats. The workers call Mr. Gregory
"Papa Dog," so named after he told recruits they would be
referred to as "Arall dogs."</p>
<p>Without club memberships, they spend their weekends in
search of buyers and their early morning hours on the phone
with European aerospace companies. They visit auctions to
pick up equipment.</p>
<p>"It's kind of like we're newlyweds," says Mr. Evancho.
"You get what you can afford."</p>
<p>They're enjoying a protracted honeymoon. "The guys in the
Arall program are more aggressive than the run-of-the-mill
metallurgists at Alcoa," says Richard Pettit, a purchasing
agent at McDonnell Douglas, which agreed to use Arall in the
cargo door of its C-17. "They got their material {used} on an
airplane much faster than usual."</p>
<p>Arall says it expects to take in $1 million in revenue
this year, half of which comes from the C-17 contract and the
rest from retrofitting old planes. Arall executives expect
their cash flow to even out this year, and they predict
profits by 1993. But the business relies on the slow-changing
and unpredictable aerospace industry, and Arall had to scale
back earlier profit projections after Fokker, a Dutch
aerospace concern, shelved its F-100, which would have used
Arall.</p>
<p>Still, rivals seem worried. "When it was part of big
Alcoa, I didn't consider it competition," says Marc
Verbrugen, marketing director for Akzo's rival product,
Glare. Now, he says, he does.</p>
