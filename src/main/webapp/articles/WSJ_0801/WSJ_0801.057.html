	<p class="article-leader">How long is 100 days? Long enough for a country to make a
revolution. Long enough too for the Soviet Union to lock that
country inside its crumbling empire.
   That at least is the view of a clutch of leaders from
newly elected Baltic governments passing through Washington
this summer. The statesmen from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
talk of the disintegration of Mr. Gorbachev's power. They
talk about independence declarations they have made in the
past 100 days and hope that their mission to America will
speed them along the road to full independence. But they also
fear that American help won't come in time to stop a Moscow
that still controls their borders from squeezing them back
into the Soviet order. Some of them even think that by fall
-- 100 days from now -- Soviet troops might turn Baltic
independence into a historical footnote.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ivars Godmanis and Janis Jurkans, Latvia's newly elected
prime minister and foreign minister, represent the optimistic
side of that wager. The pair of Balts checked into
Washington's Mayflower Hotel 10 days ago bearing a message
for Mr. Bush from Boris Yeltsin, the Russian republic's new
president. Mr. Yeltsin suggested opening diplomatic relations
between the Russian republic and the U.S. Soon, the Latvians
hope, new individual nations -- Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania
and Russia -- will start replacing the Kremlin in the
international order. "Everything is great. We see no
problem," burbled Mr. Jurkans into the telephone late one
evening last week after a meeting with Secretary of State
James Baker.</p>
<p>As things turned out, the Latvians did make progress. The
U.S. has never recognized the Soviet annexation of the Baltic
nations in 1940, but it doesn't (yet) recognize the new
Baltic governments either. When the Latvians arrived in
Washington, the White House told them the president had no
time to meet. Messrs. Godmanis and Jurkans were not even
invited to last Wednesday's Rose Garden ceremony
commemorating Captive Nations Day -- even though the annual
event is designed specifically to honor struggles of nations
like Latvia. On Thursday, though, Sen. Robert Byrd (D.,
W.Va.) introduced the two gentlemen to the Senate, and the
president's office got wind of the Yeltsin message.
Presidential time materialized. The Latvians spent 40 minutes
Monday with Mr. Bush.</p>
<p>Whatever this kind of behavior says about the president,
it satisfies the buoyant Latvians. "Creeping recognition," is
how some in Washington have described it. "Fine, don't
recognize us yet," Mr. Godmanis reportedly told Mr. Bush.
"We're not completely sovereign anyway. Soviets still control
our borders." Monday, the Latvians headed for New York, where
a Lithuanian vice premier, Algirdas Brazauskas, was already
busy plugging joint ventures and Lithuanian TV sets.</p>
<p>"We were the first to really feel the bear's paw," Mr.
Brazauskas said, describing the economic blockade the Soviet
Union imposed on Lithuania after it declared independence in
March. But now that the blockade is over, Mr. Brazauskas is
concentrating on doing business. "Invest," he told bankers,
lawyers and phone-company executives at the Cornell Club.</p>
<p>Other Balts present a darker picture. One of them is
Lennart Meri, the 61-year-old Estonian foreign minister who
dropped by the Journal for lunch recently. "We fear a new
totalitarianism" said the blunt Mr. Meri in a voice so quiet
others at the table had to lean forward to hear. In May,
paratroopers moved into waterside Kohtla-Jarva. Moscow lifted
its economic blockade against Lithuania, but it has quietly
widened control of Estonian factories. Moscow has also
assumed control of currency exchange. How will the West know
when the Kremlin restores totalitarianism in Estonia? Mr.
Meri is asked. His reply: "When they shoot me."</p>
<p>Mr. Meri worries specifically that Baltic states will be
forgotten when diplomats draw the new map of Europe.
Czechoslovakia finished its "velvet revolution" after only
one violent demonstration last November. The Germanys are
reunifying this year without a drop of blood spilling. But
months after declaring independence, the Baltic states are
still under the Soviet thumb. Mr. Meri wants to be sure the
Baltic states play a role in a November meeting of the
Conference on Security and Cooperation with Europe.
Otherwise, he fears, that organization will be a "closed
club" so busy congratulating itself on changes in Central
Europe that it leaves the Balts' fate to Mr. Gorbachev.</p>
<p>With independence movements growing as fast as they are in
the Soviet Union, Mr. Meri's fear may be unwarranted.
Whatever future they predict for Mikhail Gorbachev, though,
Balts agree Washington could do more to help their struggle.
The White House and State Department, they say, should start
by focusing attention on Mr. Yeltsin and individual nations'
struggle. The Latvians want an American information center in
Riga, and economists to teach them about Adam Smith and
Milton Friedman. The Lithuanians want business. Mr. Meri
wants the world to notice when Soviet guards start tightening
controls at the borders.</p>
<p>In a cheerful moment, Mr. Meri recalls the first time he
saw America -- from the west side of the Bering Strait, in
1966. "I was standing on the rocks and the clouds were
hanging low. There was a sudden change in the winds and I saw
a black strip of something" -- Alaska. "It was gone the next
moment." The vision may be melodramatic. But it does reflect
the Baltic situation. Now that Balts have got a glimpse of
freedom, they want to keep it.</p>
