	<p class="article-leader">New York -- In my Brooklyn neighborhood lives a crazy man
who stands outside the Jehovah's Witnesses' Kingdom Hall
every morning to scream a long abusive monologue. He doesn't
call himself a performance artist, which might explain why he
hasn't yet been awarded a grant from the NEA. Lincoln Center
hasn't put him on stage yet either.
   Given time, his luck might change. Certainly it did for a
woman named Karen Finley, who played to a packed house at the
"Serious Fun]" festival at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall
on Sunday evening. Ms. Finley is one of the four performance
artists whose grants were denied by the NEA National Council
after they'd been approved by peer review committees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ms. Finley was dropped by a nervous NEA after Washington
columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak reported that she
took off her clothes on stage and smeared her naked body with
chocolate icing.</p>
<p>Nothing sells shows in America like the threat of
censorship: Tickets to both of Ms. Finley's Lincoln Center
shows sold out quickly. The Lincoln Center audience cheered
when Ms. Finley appeared on stage. Wearing red gum boots and
a shiny party dress, she made a few jokes about requests for
product endorsements from Hershey's and Duncan Hines. Almost
immediately, though -- this was, after all, a serious-fun
festival -- she launched into the first of her monologues,
delivered fully clothed from a spotlit rocking chair.</p>
<p>With a strange combination of intense self-pity and
megalomania, she declaimed that the NEA's decision to cut her
grant would lead to the end of all art in America. The Jesse
Helms-sponsored Art Police would shut down an exhibit of
early American quilts after they find a menstrual stain. The
walls of art galleries would be stripped of their obscene Van
Goghs and Picassos. Glass blowing would be prohibited as
homoerotic. Faced with artistic bankruptcy, the conservatives
who created the Art Police would gather on the White House
lawn, frantically trying to paint pictures to replace the art
they've destroyed. But the Art Police would turn on their
masters, and for his finger-painting efforts, Mr. Helms would
be arrested and executed. "A good life is one in which they
think you never piss, yeah . . . A good life is one in which
they think you never piss, yeah . . ."</p>
<p>Ms. Finley recited this monologue, and those that
followed, in two vocal ranges: angry, chest-thumping
shouting; and low, trance-like mumbling in a mysterious
Southern tone (she's from Illinois), which ended each
sentence with phrases such as, "oh yes, chile" and "don'
worry, chile." She seemed alternately possessed by a
television evangelist and the ghost of Elvis Presley. Ms.
Finley sometimes would interrupt herself to laugh at her
jokes or to hush a member of the audience who chuckled at
something she didn't mean to be funny. During the sadder
bits, she'd cover her face with her hands and weep
uncontrollably.</p>
<p>The nudity that so troubled the NEA National Council
occurred in act two ("Why Can't This Veal Calf Walk"). First
she broke away from her monologues to toss candies to the
audience, and give away old T-shirts she'd signed in Magic
Marker. Then Ms. Finley removed her party dress, revealing a
lacy black camisole and bright red underwear. "This is what
they're afraid of]" she hooted. She poured two cups of green
gelatin into the brassiere of the camisole, and strutted
around the stage jiggling her enlarged breasts. She peeled
off the negligee but not the underwear. She smeared chocolate
icing over her bare breasts and legs (the icing represents
human feces). Next she took another bowl, this one filled
with alfalfa sprouts, and stuck the sprouts all over the
icing. She shoved a big handful into the crotch of her
underwear. Little pieces fell out during the rest of the act.
The sprouts (which represent sperm) gave her a green, shaggy
coat. Next she sprinkled candy valentine hearts on to the
sticky chocolate, and plastered herself with Christmas tree
tinsel. It wasn't clear what this was supposed to represent.
She kept her gum boots on throughout.</p>
<p>All the while, she hollered her stream of thought: "I'm
more than a hole, more than a hole, yeah . . . the woman is
private property, the woman is private property . . . no
affordable child care in this country . . . I hate
Independence Day, I want Dependence Day . . . my life is
worth nothing . . . I hate what I love . . . Trump would
rather build the world's tallest building than the tallest
low-income housing . . ."</p>
<p>She likened the Kennedy men to the defendants on trial for
raping and beating the Central Park jogger. Still decked out
in tinsel, she equated the U.S. with Nazi Germany -- "in
principle we are not so very different . . . our ovens are
just at a slower speed . . . some want the homeless dead . .
. we won't give away clean needles . . . we keep our victims
ready, yeah, we keep our victims ready, too . . . our
Auschwitz -- Bensonhurst, Tawana Brawley . . . the white male
wall is crumbling . . . we as the ovens, we as the victims .
. . William Buckley, George Will, Goering and Goebbels . . ."</p>
<p>For the last act, "Departure," Ms. Finley wrapped her
candy-coated body in a white sheet. She sat beside a bed and
crooned about death, homosexuality, AIDS -- the government's
fault -- and the intense misery of the black sheep ("We are
sheep/with no shepherd/We are sheep with no straight &
narrow/We are sheep with no meadow . . ."). Beating her chest
with her fists, she wailed and cried, "the silence on the end
of the phone, the silence on the end of the phone."</p>
<p>Ms. Finley received a standing ovation; afterward the
audience members milled about in the lobby, hashing over
their feelings about subsidies to the arts while a lone man
stood outside holding a sign, "The world is a mess."</p>
<p>Ms. Finley often has dared NEA chairman John Frohnmayer to
come and judge the merit of her act for himself. If he did,
he'd probably find it less controversial than he expected.
Her opinions, ultimately, might have been borrowed from
Village Voice editorials. Her bare breasts, covered in
chocolate, hardly would qualify for more than a PG-13 rating.
The only thing Ms. Finley teaches us to look at differently
is chocolate icing.</p>
<p>And, I guess, alfalfa sprouts.</p>
