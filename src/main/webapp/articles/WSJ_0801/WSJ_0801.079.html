	<p class="article-leader">Following in your father's footsteps is tough at the best
of times, but it has taken on a whole new meaning for fund
manager Paul R. Samuelson.
   Mr. Samuelson is the son of Paul A. Samuelson, the Nobel
Prize-winning economist and Massachusetts Institute of
Technology professor, whose economics textbook for years has
been a staple on many college reading lists. Although the
older Mr. Samuelson never managed money professionally, he
was an early advocate of the "efficient market" hypothesis,
and also developed techniques for valuing call options and
warrants.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Now his 37 year-old son is putting those ideas into
practice. In April, Mr. Samuelson took over the helm at
Colonial Income Trust, a $150 million corporate bond fund.
For the past five years, Boston's Colonial Group Inc. has
been experimenting with so called quantitative investment
techniques.</p>
<p>Quantitative investors are the nerds of Wall Street.
Unloved by traditional stock pickers, these computer-driven
investors shun conventional securities analysis and instead
take their cues from university research. While most
investors speak with awe about legendary stock pickers like
Warren Buffett or John Templeton, the quant heroes are
academics such as Harry Markowitz, Eugene Fama and Paul A.
Samuelson.</p>
<p>So far, Colonial's experiment with quant techniques has
paid off nicely for the firm's stock-fund investors. Over the
past five years, Colonial's quants have taken the fund
group's lackluster stock funds and turned them into
better-than-average performers.</p>
<p>The group's two oldest and largest stock funds, Colonial
Fund and Colonial Growth Shares, were once considered
mediocre performers. But since the start of 1986, Colonial
Fund has posted an annualized total return of 13.4% and
Colonial Growth Shares has returned 17.1%, vs. 13.2% for the
average stock fund tracked by Lipper Analytical Services.</p>
<p>That turnaround has started to attract investors'
attention, and the assets of Colonial's broker-sold stock
funds have almost quadrupled over the past five years.</p>
<p>Buoyed by their success with stocks, Colonial's quants now
are turning their attention to bonds. In the past, the
analysts and fund managers in Colonial's bond department have
produced decent results by using traditional analysis.</p>
<p>"I'd say they're skeptical," says Jarrod Wilcox,
Colonial's chief investment officer. "If it's obvious that
good things are coming out of {the quantitative approach},
they'll be willing to go along with it."</p>
<p>Mr. Samuelson has been given the task of leading the quant
charge into the bond fund area. Like most quantitative
investors, Mr. Samuelson believes the financial markets are
fairly efficient. The efficient market hypothesis holds that
the only successful "market timer" is a lucky one. For Mr.
Samuelson, that means forgoing any attempt at guessing the
direction of interest rates. He believes that predicting
rates is futile because -- with so many analysts making
forecasts -- it is all but impossible for an investor to
consistently outguess competitors.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuelson sticks mainly with investment-grade
corporate bonds. Government bonds are so simple that Mr.
Samuelson's model -- well-suited to corporate bonds with
intricate call features and sinking funds -- becomes
redundant. And as for high-yielding junk bonds, he says,
there isn't any substitute for the spadework done by
traditional bond analysts.</p>
<p>"There are two obvious ways that a quantitative approach
can pay off," says Mr. Samuelson. "One way is to value
securities that have complex features. The other way is to
judge the default rate better than others."</p>
<p>In judging default rates, Mr. Samuelson draws on one of
the quant school's favorite ideas, the Black-Scholes formula.
Developed in the early 1970s by two academics, the formula
was originally used to value options. The formula
incorporates the notion that a call option on a stock is more
valuable if the underlying stock is more volatile. That's
because a call option -- which gives its holder the right but
not the obligation to buy a security at a specified price --
holds greater potential for a large gain if the underlying
stock tends to fluctuate wildly.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuelson now is taking the ideas that underpin
Black-Scholes and applying them to corporate bonds. He uses
the volatility of a company's stock to judge the volatility
of an entire company's value, as measured by the combined
worth of its shares outstanding and its debt. Although a
volatile company value can be a good sign for shareholders,
because it suggests there is a chance for a fat gain, it also
implies that there is a substantial risk of default for
holders of the bonds.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuelson recently bought some Penn Central Corp.
bonds that trade at 100.19, have a coupon of 10 5/8% and
mature in 2000. The bonds cannot be called in early by Penn
Central so, says Mr. Samuelson, "here the only thing I can
say of any use is what its discount should be based on the
default risk. I would estimate that the discount due to the
default risk should be 7%. The actual discount {relative to a
comparable government bond} is 13%."</p>
<p>Though Mr. Samuelson concedes that his model doesn't help
much when there's a high risk of default, he reckons his
analysis can unearth bonds that are cheap relative to a
firm's long-term default risk -- providing that the stock
market is accurately assessing the risk of owning a company's
stock. To make sure he's not being misled by a mispriced
stock, Mr. Samuelson's compares his estimate for a company's
volatility with volatility estimates for companies in the
same industry. Says he, "There's a definite art to valuing
corporate bonds."</p>
<p>To assess the likely return on a corporate bond, investors
generally look at a bond's yield to first call as well as its
yield to maturity. That is because many bonds have special
features that allow companies to buy back, or call, their
bonds before the maturity date. Mr. Samuelson tries to cope
with this problem by looking at a bond's option-adjusted
yield. This calculation takes into account all of the bond's
provisions, including the likelihood that a bond will be paid
off early.</p>
<p>Colonial Income Trust, for instance, owns some USAir Group
bonds, which have a coupon of 12 7/8% and mature in 2000.
With the bonds selling at 109.53, the yield to maturity is
11.2%. But that figure is misleading, because the bond can
first be called in 1995 at 100, giving the bonds a yield to
first call of 10.1%. Figuring in the high likelihood that the
bonds will be called in 1995, Mr. Samuelson comes up with an
option-adjusted yield of 9.9%. That is what Mr. Samuelson
reckons the bonds would yield if they were definitely going
to mature in 1995. He can then use that yield to compare
USAir with other, comparable quality corporate bonds maturing
in 1995.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Samuelson is developing a computer program to
incorporate another of the quant school's key ideas,
so-called portfolio optimization. Optimization draws on the
notion that, while all bonds will react to a change in
interest rates, the default risk of different bonds will vary
as economic conditions change. There is a poor correlation,
for instance, between the default risk of utility bonds and
those of a capital goods producer. By combining such bonds in
his portfolio, Mr. Samuelson hopes to lower the overall
volatility of his fund.</p>
