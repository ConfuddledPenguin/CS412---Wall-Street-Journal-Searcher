	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- The Environmental Protection Agency said it
may be forced to limit the days Southern California commuters
can drive their cars, if existing state and local plans fail
to cut smog by 86% by the end of the century.
   The federal agency's plan, which includes many
anti-pollution measures approved more than a year ago by the
regional South Coast Air Quality Management District and the
California Air Resources Board, seeks to cut carbon monoxide
emissions in this part of the state by 86% by the year 2004,
with the same reduction in ozone emissions by 2010.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Daniel W. McGovern, EPA's western regional administrative
director, said the agency "reluctantly" included guidelines
for so-called no-drive days as a "backstop measure" for
reducing carbon monoxide emissions if the state and local
plans are unsuccessful by their own deadline, the year 2000.
The no-drive plan would use odd or even numbers on auto
license tags to alternate driving days.</p>
<p>"It is in the spirit of presenting all possibilities that
we are presenting the no-drive day," Mr. McGovern said. "It
is not one we are endorsing."</p>
<p>The EPA was forced to issue the plan as a result of a 1988
lawsuit by the California Coalition for Clean Air and the
Sierra Club. An EPA official termed timing of the new plan
"awkward" because state and local authorities were developing
more stringent pollution plans for the Los Angeles area that
may render the federal plan unnecessary.</p>
<p>Mr. McGovern said that since Congress and the president
were revamping the federal Clean Air Act, the new plan soon
may become obsolete and require another revision.</p>
<p>Environmentalists who brought the lawsuit called the EPA
plan insurance that will help make the state and regional
governments stick to their guns, although they noted that the
federal plan takes longer to achieve the goals set by the
state.</p>
<p>"We're disappointed that they did not adopt the state's
timetable," said Jan Chatten-Brown, president of the
California Coalition for Clean Air.</p>
<p>Most measures in the EPA plan don't take effect until
after 1996, and then only if state and regional efforts have
failed to reduce pollution sufficiently.</p>
<p>The federal proposals that could become effective before
1996 include winter and summer reductions in gasoline
volatility, increases in the oxygen content in winter
gasoline and enforcement of federal guidelines to reformulate
gasoline to further reduce emissions.</p>
