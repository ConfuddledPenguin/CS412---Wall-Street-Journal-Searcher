	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In an unusual midweek takeover, thrift
regulators seized United Savings Bank, after the Vienna, Va.,
thrift, with $415 million in assets, experienced an
old-fashioned run on its deposits.
   Following United's report last week that it posted losses
of $11.5 million for the first six months of 1990, nervous
depositors lined up and withdrew $13 million from the thrift
on Saturday, industry sources said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"United was not likely to have been able to meet the
demands of its depositors or to pay its obligations in the
normal course of business," a statement from the Office of
Thrift Supervision said.</p>
<p>United will operate under the management of the Resolution
Trust Corp., which will seek a buyer. All deposits at United
are insured up to $100,000, and government officials
dismissed the possibility of runs at other institutions.</p>
<p>Thrift regulators waited until 4:15 p.m. yesterday to shut
the doors at United's offices.</p>
<p>"Keep in mind, people around here may still relate to the
Maryland situation, where a state insurance fund ran out of
money," in the mid-1980s, a spokesman for the thrift office
said. In that case, some depositors had funds tied up for
weeks or months, while the mess was sorted out.</p>
<p>In the federal thrift cleanup so far, government officials
say, depositors have received their funds in three to four
days even when an institution is liquidated. The far more
common practice is for the thrift to close over a weekend and
reopen Monday under a different name; depositors never lose
access to their funds.</p>
<p>The takeover also was another signal that the
Washington-area real estate market, once considered
invulnerable to recession, is being hit by a slump,
particularly in the commercial sector. United's rapid-growth
strategy was fueled by heavy commercial real estate lending,
the thrift office said.</p>
<p>The thrift office said the thrift was operating in an
unsafe and unsound condition, failed all three capital
requirements under the S&L cleanup law, and relied heavily on
expensive brokered funds for its investments. United has
operated under strict federal supervision for 15 months, but
as of June 30, it classified nearly one quarter of its assets
as nonearning, troubled or losses.</p>
<p>Shareholders will retain no interest in the institution
under government management. It was previously traded over
the counter.</p>
