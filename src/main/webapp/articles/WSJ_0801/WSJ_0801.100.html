	<p class="article-leader">UAL Corp. stock plunged $16.875 a share to $140 after two
more banks, Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp., indicated
they have withdrawn temporarily from work on a proposed $4.38
billion, $201-a-share buy-out of the parent of United
Airlines.
   The move, by the same two banks that had led last year's
unsuccessful $6.79 billion UAL buy-out attempt, threw more
doubt on prospects for this version only nine days before an
Aug. 9 financing deadline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The three UAL unions leading the buy-out are expected to
seek an extension of that deadline at a UAL board meeting
Aug. 8. But it's unclear whether they can demonstrate enough
progress to justify an extension unless they find outside
investors willing to supply additional junior financing.
Without an extension, the unions' right to buy United will
expire.</p>
<p>Yesterday's UAL sell-off in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading began after the American Banker, a
financial newspaper, reported that Citicorp had withdrawn
from a group of banks leading the financing, and that
Citicorp and Chase had skipped a key lenders' meeting Friday.
On Monday, The Wall Street Journal said Chemical Banking
Corp. had withdrawn.</p>
<p>The selling snowballed after people familiar with the
buy-out confirmed that both Citicorp and Chase had "moved to
the sidelines," as one put it, leaving only Bankers Trust New
York Corp. and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. as lead banks for
the deal. The same people said all three drop-out banks were
prepared to rejoin the effort if developments warrant.</p>
<p>As a result of the defections, one person said the two
remaining banks have postponed work planned for this week on
proposed terms of a bank loan of roughly $4 billion. All of
the banks are awaiting the outcome of an effort by the unions
to obtain additional financing, either subordinated debt or
equity.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Gerald Greenwald, the unions' nominee to become
UAL chairman if the buy-out is completed, said the group is
"close to" obtaining debt financing from "more than one"
supplier. But the banks' pullout casts a cloud of doubt over
those talks as well.</p>
<p>In a statement yesterday, the buy-out group said: "We are
continuing to work with a core group of banks to develop a
capital structure satisfactory to them from a credit and
syndication point of view. While there remain a number of
significant issues to be resolved, we continue to work toward
solutions." The group said it was "inappropriate" to comment
on the actions of individual banks. None of the banks would
comment.</p>
<p>Yesterday's developments were the latest twist in a
three-year corporate soap opera. The UAL board accepted the
unions' offer, the fourth since 1987, in early April under
the threat of a proxy fight by Coniston Partners, which owns
11.8% of UAL stock. The collapse of the previous buy-out
attempt in October touched off a 190-point drop in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average.</p>
<p>One reason the bank group seemed to dissolve so quickly as
the deadline neared is that the banks haven't ever formally
agreed to act as lead banks for the transaction.</p>
<p>The group formed initially as a loose collection of about
eight banks that met irregularly with advisers to the
buy-out. The group was meant to be large enough to coalesce
into a so-called club deal. Instead of financing led by only
one or two banks, a club deal reduces the risk for the
individual banks by spreading responsibility for distributing
the loan.</p>
<p>People close to the union effort say they never intended
to make the names of the banks public before the financing
deadline. But in early July, Mr. Greenwald named the five
banks in a confidential progress report to the UAL board.</p>
<p>UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf was on the verge of placing a
mammoth aircraft order valued at $10 billion, but the unions
wanted to head off the order to preserve their bargaining
position with the airline's suppliers.</p>
<p>The unions want to use the order as bait to obtain junior
financing from aircraft manufacturers and engine makers. But
the order by Mr. Wolf, who stands to lose his job if the
unions complete the buy-out, would have taken the bait away.
For Mr. Wolf, the order could have doomed the union effort
and saved his job.</p>
<p>Pressed by the UAL board for evidence of progress that
would justify blocking the order, Mr. Greenwald named five
banks that were working with the union group. Although the
unions succeeded in blocking the aircraft order, the banks'
names soon became public.</p>
<p>When the names of the banks began leaking out, a recorded
message on the pilots' union telephone hotline said on July 7
that the five banks "will be both participating in and
leading the financing." People close to the buy-out effort
didn't discourage that idea, even though the banks hadn't
agreed formally to do so.</p>
<p>The buy-out group may have been trying to use the
appearance of having a bank group to put pressure on the
suppliers to come up with financing. Many of the suppliers
oppose making such investments, both for fear of alienating
other customers and because of the financial risk. But if the
suppliers believed the buy-out would be completed, they
risked losing the order if they didn't invest.</p>
<p>When the bank names became public, some bankers involved
in the talks seemed irked at what one called "an aggressive
interpretation of events." And people close to the buy-out
group say relations with the banks have been strained ever
since.</p>
<p>At the time, the bankers made it clear they wouldn't lead
the financing unless the union group obtained additional
financing. Some of the banks, such as Chemical, have insisted
that financing be in the form of equity from a substantial
investor who could be available to help repair the situation
if the airline's finances deteriorated. Other banks have also
voiced concerns about the way the unions will control the
airline.</p>
<p>Yet despite blocking the aircraft order by current UAL
management, the unions haven't yet obtained any junior
financing. Some banks have indicated they would reconsider
their involvement if the unions succeed in that effort.</p>
<p>At the moment, the buy-out group is trying to minimize the
public relations damage the three banks' withdrawal has done
by stressing that none of the five ever signed a formal
commitment. For that reason, one official close to the
buy-out group said, "It would be wrong to say that any bank
is in or out at this stage."</p>
<p>Another person close to the transaction said it was
possible the banks were posturing to get the buy-out group to
meet their demands. "You have to ask yourself why the banks
are acting this way. Banks just don't go in and out of
deals," this person said. He added that "everything about
this process has moved slowly. The banks might be trying to
shake things up."</p>
<p>The sharp decline in UAL stock left some traders licking
their wounds. Coniston, which acquired its stock for an
average disclosed price of $161 a share, is facing an
indicated loss of about $50 million on its 2.5 million
shares.</p>
<p>Airline analysts said yesterday's decline brings the stock
closer to the level where it would trade in the absence of
any takeover prospects. They put that level anywhere from $90
to $120 a share, based on UAL's expected 1990 earnings of $7
to $13 a share.</p>
<p>"I think there's a fair amount of skepticism that this
deal will get done. It's apparent that the Aug. 9 deadline is
going to be missed, and it shakes people's confidence," said
Helane Becker, airline analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</p>
