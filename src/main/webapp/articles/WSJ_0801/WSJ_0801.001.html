	<p class="article-leader">Christopher F. Edley, a Harvard trained lawyer who led the
United Negro College Fund to become one of the nation's most
successful black charities, will retire after 17 years as
president and chief executive officer, the college fund said.
   Mr. Edley, 62 years old, cited a desire to rest and some
health concerns as the reasons for his move. The college fund
began a quiet national search for Mr. Edley's successor about
two months ago, according to college fund chairman Joe
Williams, who is chairman and chief executive officer of
Warner Lambert Corp. Mr. Williams said the college fund is
looking for a successor with "stature in the black community,
stature in the corporate community, someone who can interface
with the White House, someone who is dedicated to his race."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The New York-based college fund, which supports 41 private
black colleges and universities, raised about $9.5 million in
revenue annually when Mr. Edley took over in 1973. For the
year ended March 30, the fund took in $48.5 million. Mr.
Williams said Mr. Edley was also instrumental in securing a
recent $50 million donation from publisher and philanthropist
Walter H. Annenberg, the largest single donation in the
fund's history.</p>
<p>Mr. Edley said the fund was "like a mom and pop kind of
store that was getting bigger," when he came. "People were so
busy waiting on customers that no strategic thoughts were
being given." The year before Mr. Edley's arrival, the fund
began its first national advertising campaign with the
slogan, "A Mind is a Terrible Thing to Waste." The campaign
and slogan, among the most successful in the history of
public service advertising, gave the fund a national
visibility previously unknown for a black charity.</p>
<p>But, Mr. Edley said, "People do not give money just
because they see your ad on TV. Advertising helps soften
people up." Mr. Edley said he had to focus the fund on
creating a wide range of opportunities for people to actually
give money after seeing an ad. Among the most successful of
these efforts is an annual telethon and other special events
closely associated with sports and entertainment celebrities.</p>
<p>The award-winning college fund ads have become the most
requested of all public service spots handled by the
Advertising Council, a nonprofit organization that produces
and distributes such advertising using member advertising
agencies. Cathy Mitchell, who handles the fund's campaign for
the Advertising Council, said the ads succeed in part because
they convey the basic appeal of the college fund's mission.</p>
<p>"I think that Chris {Edley} is quite a leader. He's
directly involved with the advertising and he knows his
organization. He knows his market and what he wants to
convey," Ms. Mitchell said.</p>
<p>Mr. Edley is a former Philadelphia prosecutor who also
served as counsel to what is now the federal Housing and
Urban Development Department. He joined the college fund
after a 10-year stint with the Ford Foundation. "Really, all
my professional life has been heavily laden with the things
that would advance the minority cause," Mr. Edley said. His
son, Christopher Edley Jr., is a professor of law at Harvard
and was a principal adviser to Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis in his presidential bid.</p>
<p>The college fund, founded in 1944, has gained broad
recognition in the market of sympathetic middle-class givers,
which is about 60% white and 40% black, according to Ms.
Mitchell. And the fund can point to a 13% increase in
enrollment since 1986 at the four-year schools it supports.
The 1988 gift of $20 million to Spelman College in Atlanta by
entertainer Bill Cosby, the largest individual donation to a
black college in history, heralded the next major focus for
the college fund, Mr. Edley says: hitting up black
millionaires.</p>
