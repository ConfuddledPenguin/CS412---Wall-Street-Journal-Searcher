	<p class="article-leader">The dollar slid to its lowest level against the German
mark in more than two-and-a-half years, stalling a
bond-market rally and contributing to a mild retreat in
blue-chip stocks.
   As the dollar sank, more investors sought haven in gold
and platinum, driving up prices. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average dropped 12.13 points to close at 2905.20, hurt by
late waves of computer-guided program selling and plunging
UAL Corp. shares. But broader stock-market indexes rose
slightly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>UAL, parent of United Airlines, nosedived $16.875 to $140
after two more big banks, Citicorp and Chase Manhattan,
indicated they have pulled out of a proposed buy-out. Bond
prices, which have jumped recently, held steady yesterday.
Investors, wary of the dollar's drop, also awaited a batch of
economic reports this morning and on Friday.</p>
<p>The dollar tumbled 1.4% against the Japanese yen and 1.1%
against the German mark, winding up slightly above its
post-World War II record low against the German currency.
Many traders fear that further drops will frighten foreign
investors away from American stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>"It becomes hard to hold the U.S. currency when you have
higher interest rates in nearly all the other currencies,"
said Jeffrey M. Mondschein, managing director in charge of
foreign exchange at Continental Bank in Chicago.</p>
<p>The dollar is drawing special attention this week because
the Treasury this afternoon is expected to announce plans to
sell more than $30 billion of new notes and bonds. Foreign
investors have bought huge amounts of Treasury issues in the
past, helping to finance the U.S. budget deficit. If foreign
investors buy less at these auctions, U.S. interest rates
could rise, hurting the stock market.</p>
<p>"The dollar's weakness is terribly important," said Peter
Canelo, investment strategist at Bear Stearns. "A falling
dollar right before a major government borrowing certainly is
not the kind of thing that makes bond and stock investors
happy."</p>
<p>The dollar's weakness also could rekindle inflation fears
and persuade Federal Reserve officials not to cut U.S.
interest rates any further, several analysts warned.</p>
<p>But Fed officials appear to be focusing much more on the
U.S. economy's weakness than on the dollar. They also are
still facing heavy political pressure to ease credit further
to prevent a potential recession.</p>
<p>Oil stocks once again posted strong gains, helped by a
recent surge in oil prices. Utility stocks also advanced.</p>
<p>In major market activity:</p>
<p>Stock prices were mixed. While the Dow industrials fell,
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.60 to 356.15, and
the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.42 to
194.60.</p>
<p>The dollar tumbled. In late New York trading yesterday,
the dollar was quoted at 145.80 yen, down from 147.83 yen
Monday, and 1.5869 German marks, down from 1.6041 marks
Monday. The British pound rose to $1.864 from $1.847 Monday.</p>
<p>Bonds were little changed. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond rose to 8.41% from 8.40% Monday.</p>
