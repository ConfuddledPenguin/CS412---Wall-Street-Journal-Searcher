	<p class="article-leader">Your exceptional coverage of Donald Trump's financial
imbroglio has fascinated me.
   However, as a professional woman and newly minted Harvard
MBA, I found "Trump Girl: Donald's Latest Venture Is a
Brunette" by Joanne Kaufman (Leisure and Arts, June 26) about
women auditioning as Trump Girl hostesses on the forthcoming
"Trump Card" game show blatantly sexist. The portrayal of
women as blonde and brunette girls who seem to symbolize
sexual triumphs for Mr. Trump degrades all women. Moreover, I
wonder if Mr. Trump and The Wall Street Journal would dare
describe any man in the Trump organization as a boy?</p>

<p>Ms. Kaufman's piece about auditions for the "Trump Girl"
is one of the cutest and slickest bits of writing I've seen
for quite a while. Let's have more from this talented writer.</p>
