	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Employers Casualty Co., citing skyrocketing
claims in its general liability and workers' compensation
insurance lines, said it added about $90 million to reserves
in the second quarter, leading to a net loss of $85.7
million, or $8.49 a share.
   The insurer also said John F. Stephens, 74 years old,
retired as chairman and as a board member. He was succeeded
as chairman by Ernest L. Proud Jr., the company's 57-year-old
president and chief executive.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the second quarter last year, the company reported a
net loss of $21.6 million, or $2.15 a share. In the latest
six months, the net loss widened to $94.8 million, or $9.40 a
share, including $100.6 million in reserves, from a net loss
of $16.1 million, or $1.60 a share in the year-ago period.
Adjusted book value at June 30, 1990, fell to $89.4 million,
or $9.18 a share, from $242.6 million, or $24.93 a share, a
year earlier, the company said.</p>
<p>The company said the major portion of the reserve increase
is for liability losses from policies written many years ago.
"Ultimate loss payouts are being heavily impacted by
settlements and jury awards that are being made in the highly
litigious environment that currently exists in Texas," said
Mr. Proud.</p>
<p>Employers said it plans to reduce premiums written to a
net annualized volume of $150 million, and is looking for
ways to cut expenses. In recent years, net premiums have
averaged above $400 million annually.</p>
