	<p class="article-leader">Lincoln Bancorp and its main subsidiary, Lincoln National
Bank, said they changed their names to avoid further
confusion with Lincoln Savings & Loan Association, an Irvine,
Calif.-based thrift that was seized by the government last
year.
   The new names, effective immediately, are California
United Bank, N.A. for the unit, and CU Bancorp for the
Encino, Calif.-based holding company. The changes were
approved by shareholders in June, but were delayed after
another financial institution, United California Savings
Bank, tried unsuccessfully to prevent the adoption of the new
names.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CU Bancorp said that the mistaken-identity problem caused
by its old name was worsened by the fact that its president
and chief executive officer, John J. Keating, has the same
last name as Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of
Phoenix-based American Continental Corp., former parent of
Lincoln Savings & Loan.</p>
