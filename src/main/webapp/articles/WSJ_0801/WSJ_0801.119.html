	<p class="article-leader">National Westminster Bank PLC, Britain's second-largest
commercial bank, said yesterday its pretax profit for the six
months ended June 30 rose 22% from the year-earlier period to
#431 million ($796.3 million).
   Pretax profit in the first half of 1989, which was hurt by
provisions against loans to lesser developed countries, was
#352 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As in the year-earlier period, the bank's pretax profit in
the latest period was curbed by #425 million in net loan
charges.</p>
<p>But even though the latest period's loan provisions were
down 27% from #585 million in the first half of last year,
the key difference this time around is that the provisions
were to cover exposure in the U.K. and U.S. markets rather
than in developing countries.</p>
<p>Lord Alexander, chairman of NatWest, issued a cautious
statement, saying, "These profits are considerably lower than
we would have wished." Lord Alexander stressed, however, that
"problem-country debt is largely behind us" and that
NatWest's "underlying core business is sound."</p>
