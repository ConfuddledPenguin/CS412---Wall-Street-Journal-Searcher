	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- USX Corp. posted a 15% earnings drop in the
second quarter as oil-related gains failed to offset lower
steel profits and losses associated with the company's
natural gas business.
   The nation's largest steelmaker earned $212 million, or 81
cents a share, compared with $250 million, or 91 cents a
share, in the year-ago second quarter. Sales slid 8% to $4.6
billion from $5 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest quarter includes pretax charges of $99 million
from, among other things, a loss from the anticipated third
quarter sale of certain Texas Oil & Gas Corp. assets, and
costs associated with the company's successful proxy fight
against New York investor Carl Icahn. Mr. Icahn, who owns a
13.3% stake, failed to convince a majority of shareholders to
back his proposal to spin off the steel business. Those
charges were offset by a favorable pretax $112 million
tax-related adjustment. That didn't, however, match last
year's second quarter pretax gains of $140 million from asset
sales.</p>
<p>The company noted that, excluding special items and the
profits from businesses sold, second quarter operating income
actually rose to $428 million from $405 million. Chairman
Charles A. Corry said the company is "building on a three
year trend of improving operations."</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, USX
closed at $34.50, up 12.5 cents.</p>
<p>The strongest leg of USX remains Marathon Oil, where lower
crude oil prices helped boost profit margins in the refining,
marketing and transportation -- so called downstream
operations -- to a record $263 million, compared with $169
million a year ago.</p>
<p>USX, like other steelmakers, has suffered from price
erosion which began in the second half of 1989 and has only
recently begun to reverse itself. Moreover, the industry
faces higher costs, at the same time when shipments, while
improving, fail to match last year's robust levels. At USX,
steel segment operating profits slid 53% to $80 million from
$171 million, also reflecting the absence of operating income
from its Lorain, Ohio plant, which was sold. Steel segment
sales fell to $1.4 billion from $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>Independent steel analyst Charles Bradford noted that
USX's steel-related costs rose about 6%, while prices
improved only about 1%. As a result, he said profits per ton
of steel shipped, while higher than the first quarter,
slipped to $28 from $53 a year ago.</p>
<p>John Tumazos, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp. said USX should have higher steel profits
because, unlike many of its competitors, it has lower labor
costs and a fully funded pension plan. Moreover, he sees
major hurdles ahead, including the relining of a major blast
furnace at Gary, Ind., and upcoming contract talks with the
United Steelworkers of America.</p>
<p>"The major challenge facing this company will be the Jan.
31 labor contract," he said. If USX agrees to a contract
similar to its competitors, including Bethlehem Steel Corp.,
the company's steel labor costs could rise $200 million a
year and nearly erase operating profits, he contends.</p>
<p>Texas Oil & Gas Corp. reported an operating loss of $30
million compared with a loss of $13 million in last year's
second quarter. USX, which had tried to sell all of the
unit's exploration and production properties, now expects to
sell three of six packages.</p>
