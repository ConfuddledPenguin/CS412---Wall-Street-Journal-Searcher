	<p class="article-leader">ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- The brokerage that penny-stock king
Meyer Blinder once boasted would be bigger than Merrill
Lynch, Pierce Fenner & Smith Inc. listed $17.9 million in
assets and $13.4 million in debts in its Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law petition filed in Denver Monday.
   Although the brokerage claims more assets than debts, the
company couldn't raise enough cash to meet immediate needs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Blinder, Robinson & Co., a unit of Intercontinental
Enterprises Inc., listed office-building leases and lawsuit
judgments as its principal unsecured debts. Even in its
demise, the Blinder Robinson was controversial. "It's evident
that the filing is a maneuver to default on a $5.8 million
judgment I have against the firm," said Denver attorney Steve
A. Miller. "I intend to pursue this."</p>
<p>Mr. Miller's client, Donald L. Walford, won the judgment
in a malicious prosecution suit against the firm, which
disputes the claim.</p>
<p>In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Blinder Robinson said it held for customers $70 million in
securities and $4.8 million in cash, and had 250,000
accounts. Blinder Robinson said it ceased securities
transactions before it filed.</p>
<p>Blinder also said it expected to transfer its accounts to
another brokerage. The company had not disclosed the identity
of the brokerage and did not return repeated telephone calls.
The Securities Investor Protection Corp. insures the accounts
to a maximum $100,000 in cash and $500,000 in cash and
securities. A SIPC attorney said the insurance firm was
"gathering information."</p>
<p>Operating problems were the immediate threat to Blinder
Robinson. From its peak of 1,800 salesmen in offices around
the world, the brokerage had dwindled to 43 offices and
perhaps 300 salesmen. Its parent reported losses of $553,000
in the quarter ended April 27 on revenue of $9.5 million.</p>
