	<p class="article-leader">Genzyme Corp. expects to post sharply higher revenue and a
profit after a one-time gain for the second-quarter ended
June 30.
   For the quarter, the Boston-based biotechnology and
specialty-chemicals company expects to report an operating
loss of about $1.4 million, said Henri Termeer, president,
chairman and chief executive officer. However, a gain of $5
million to $10 million from the sale of a unit's stock made
profit $3.6 million to $8.6 million, or 23 cents to 54 cents
a share. The year-earlier profit was $241,000, or three cents
a share, including a tax credit of $195,000. Revenue rose
about 48% to more than $12 million from $8.1 million a year
earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the six months, the indicated net loss was $14.6
million to $19.6 million, or 91 cents to $1.22 a share,
including the secondquarter gain and a first-quarter charge
of $20.8 million from the purchase of a limited partnership's
assets. Year-earlier profit was $407,000, or five cents a
share, including a tax credit of $250,000. Revenue rose about
36% to about $22 million from $16.2 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Termeer said Genzyme's operating loss was reduced
because of higher product revenue, higher cost reimbursements
for the company's experimental drug Ceredase and improved
results at Genzyme's IG Laboratories unit, a genetic-testing
concern.</p>
