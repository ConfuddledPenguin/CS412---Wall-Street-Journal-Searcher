	<p class="article-leader">When will apparel makers start to stitch up their frayed
stock prices?
   Wall Street isn't hovering around the sewing machines in
anticipation. A number of analysts say that all but a few of
the battered apparel and textile stocks face a
longer-than-expected turnaround in a tough retailing climate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It is not business as usual -- and bottom-fishing can be
dangerous, so our advice is to be very selective," warns
Deborah Bronston, an apparel-industry analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities.</p>
<p>Apparel companies have seen their inventories mount up, as
retail sales have only picked up modestly so this year.
"Overall, apparel sales have been slow, and I don't see any
sign of any immediate improvement," says Robert Buchanan, a
retail analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons.</p>
<p>But what's giving apparel makers major headaches these
days are the sweeping changes taking place at the big retail
chains.</p>
<p>From Wal-Mart to May Department Stores, retailers have
been sharply cutting the numbers of suppliers they use. The
retailers' big objective: to keep on top of their inventories
by selecting powerful suppliers with whom they share
computerized sales information.</p>
<p>Even the lucky suppliers that make the cut have a harder
time. Stores have stopped stocking up on "commodity" goods
that don't tend to be fashion-sensitive, such as towels,
basic jeans and cosmetics. Increasingly, they order them on
short notice, causing manufacturers to be stuck with bigger
inventory backlogs and less predictable earnings growth, says
Prudential's Ms. Bronston.</p>
<p>This new order is taking its toll on the publicly traded
apparel and textile stocks. Apparel companies won't thrive
until they get into the swing of a new way of doing business,
which "requires the apparel maker -- instead of the retailer
-- to assume more of the cost of caring for the inventories,"
says Jeffrey Ubben, an investment analyst at Fidelity
Investments. At Fidelity, the giant mutual-fund company,
holdings include Crystal Brands, Leslie Fay and Fruit of the
Loom.</p>
<p>Among the stocks likely to be the slow to rebound,
analysts say, are Hartmarx, which has been stymied by the
long slump in men's tailored clothing, and VF Corp., with
more than half of its production in the stagnant jeans-wear
business.</p>
<p>The apparel companies will weigh in with a mixed
performance in 1990, analysts say. According to Ms.
Bronston's estimates, results will range from a 50% drop in
earnings at Hartmarx to a 45% increase at Fruit of the Loom,
with an average gain somewhere around 6%.</p>
<p>The industry is sharply split between two camps. "Today
you will find a bigger disparity between those companies who
are doing well and those who aren't," says Elizabeth
Armstrong at Prescott, Ball and Turben.</p>
<p>So what's an investor to do?</p>
<p>Most analysts prefer to stick with apparel companies that
have popular brand names and that also offer extensive
product lines. That's because stores tend to group these
goods together, seeking to attract customer with large
boutique-style displays.</p>
<p>Analysts continue to tout Liz Claiborne, which already
blankets the women's sportswear floor and has expanded into
menswear, cosmetics, shoes and jewelry.</p>
<p>The stock is now trading at 29 1/2 or about 14 times
earnings, and "still has room for growth," says Josie
Esquivel of Shearson Lehman Hutton. Ms. Esquivel believes the
stock "has the potential to be a $38 stock" but has been hurt
by recent unloading of the company's stock by several of its
top executives.</p>
<p>Fidelity's Mr. Ubben is among those who champion Leslie
Fay. The company, he says, has reinvigorated the typically
dowdy area of moderately priced women's wear and is "shipping
every three weeks, which is just what the stores want."</p>
<p>He estimates that Leslie Fay occupies only one-fourth as
much department-store floor space as Liz Claiborne, and
trades at a lower multiple. "So the growth opportunity, in
terms of taking up more floor space, is much more than Liz,"
he says.</p>
<p>Acquisition-minded Crystal Brands is another favorite of
Wall Street's bargain-hunters. The company has expanded its
stable of brands in recent years by acquiring well-known
jewelry and menswear firms. Crystal Brands also is gaining
momentum with its Evan Picone brand, as more stores add the
line to give women an alternative to the ubiquitous Liz
Claiborne.</p>
