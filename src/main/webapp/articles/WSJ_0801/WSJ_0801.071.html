	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge has ruled that an employer can cap AIDS
benefits for its employees under the federal statute
regulating employee benefits known as the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. The decision has been
appealed.
   It is believed to be the first case to address the issue
of whether ERISA allows employers to amend their health plans
in response to medical claims submitted for a particular
illness.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>John McGann was diagnosed as having acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, in December 1987 and told his
employer, H & H Music Co., Houston, of the diagnosis. Seven
months later, the company became self-insured and changed its
group medical care plan.</p>
<p>Under the previous plan, employees diagnosed with AIDS
were entitled to as much as $1 million in benefits during
their lifetime. The new plan capped AIDS benefits at $5,000
and also discontinued benefits for chemical dependency.</p>
<p>After learning about the changes, Mr. McGann filed a
discrimination lawsuit alleging that his employer's action
violated his rights under ERISA. He also sued Brook Mays
Music Co., Houston, which administers the plan, and General
American Life Insurance Co., St. Louis, Mo., which provided
excess risk coverage.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Norman W. Black dismissed Mr. McGann's
lawsuit. In essence, the judge's ruling means that under
ERISA employers have the right to change or terminate their
medical plan even if they know about a particular employee's
illness. Judge Black found that the financial strain caused
by the plan had forced the company to make changes or end
health benefits for everyone in the company.</p>
<p>And Judge Black said that H & H Music had complied with
ERISA by providing employees with notice that the group
medical plan was subject to change from year to year.</p>
<p>Employment lawyers say the case highlights a troubling
issue currently confronting corporations. The AIDS crisis has
left many companies unable to cope with the rising health
costs associated with the catastrophic illness, these lawyers
say.</p>
<p>"If you have 40 people in a company and one has AIDS and
it's so expensive that no one can have insurance, then what
are you going to do? It's a disaster for a small mom-and-pop
operation faced with a $60,000 hospital bill for one
employee. And companies are facing that question every day,"
says Robert C. Christenson of the Atlanta firm of Fisher &
Phillips, who has represented employers in such cases.</p>
<p>A handful of states require health insurance policies to
include AIDS coverage. And, about 50% of the states have laws
barring discrimination in employment solely because a person
has AIDS. But employers who are self-insured are governed by
the federal ERISA law, which pre-empts those laws and doesn't
require employers to provide specific benefits in their
health plans.</p>
<p>"This decision appears to validate a dangerous trend under
which employers attempt to circumvent the obligations
otherwise imposed on them by state law by going the
self-insurance route," says Thomas B. Stoddard, executive
director of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a legal
organization for lesbians and gay men and co-counsel for Mr.
McGann.</p>
<p>Under the law, "H & H had the right to do what they did.
They followed the law," says Mark Huvard of the Houston law
firm of Engelhardt Harberg & Huvard, a lawyer for H & H and
Brook Mays. A lawyer for General American said he wouldn't
comment because the case is pending. The plaintiff filed an
appeal last week in Houston.</p>
<p>Mr. McGann's lawyers say they believe that ERISA bars
companies from discriminating in the granting of health
benefits.</p>
<p>Says Donald Skipwith, a Houston solo practitioner who is
co-counsel for Mr. McGann: "In order to protect the group,
the defendants left an employee who had been part of that
group for years and years out in the cold."</p>

<p>PROCTER & GAMBLE SUED two Amway Corp. distributors.</p>
<p>The Cincinnati-based consumer-products giant, eager to
quash rumors linking the company to Satanism, sued the
distributors for spreading the tales and launching boycotts
of P&G brands.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in a federal district court in Topeka,
Kan., seeks an order to stop the distributors, James and
Linda Newton of Parsons, Kan., from circulating the rumors.
Procter & Gamble also seeks compensatory damages of more than
$50,000 and unspecified punitive damages.</p>
<p>Previously, P&G has filed a dozen lawsuits related to the
devil-worship rumor, including actions against three other
Amway distributors. All were settled out of court, the
company said.</p>
<p>The Newtons distributed brochures that accuse the company
of supporting the Church of Satan, P&G alleged. The couple
also told others that P&G's moon and stars logo is a Satanic
symbol and encouraged them to boycott P&G products, according
to P&G officials. The Newtons couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Amway, Ada, Mich., said its distributors
operate independently and declined to comment on the suit.
She said Amway has cooperated with P&G in the past to squelch
rumors about Satanism.</p>
<p>Distributors for Amway sell numerous products, including
detergents, cleaning and personal-care products. P&G sells
leading brands in all those categories, such as Tide
detergent, Spic and Span cleaner and Pert Plus shampoo.</p>

<p>A $100-A-YEAR ASSESSMENT is being fought by New Jersey
lawyers.</p>
<p>New Jersey lawyers are upset about the state's new
automobile insurance reform package. The law, which went into
effect last March, requires all attorneys licensed in New
Jersey to pay a $100-a-year assessment for the privilege of
practicing in the state.</p>
<p>The idea came from recently elected Gov. Jim Florio, a
Democrat who campaigned heavily on the promise to reform the
state's auto insurance system. Last March, he signed into law
a new system designed to cut premiums by 20%, partly by
eliminating the state-operated insurance pool for high-risk
drivers known as the Joint Underwriting Association.</p>
<p>Where do the lawyers come in? Because of bad management,
the pool was $3.1 billion in debt. Insurance companies are
required to pay off $1.4 billion of the debt. But the new law
requires all groups that benefited financially from the prior
system also to chip in -- including doctors, podiatrists,
chiropractors, physical therapists, auto-body shops and each
of the state's 42,000 lawyers.</p>
<p>The lawyers countered with a lawsuit. Now pending in New
Jersey State Taxation Court in Trenton, the suit contends
that the law is overbroad because it affects all lawyers, not
just those who practice personal injury and automobile
negligence cases. Law professors, judges, inactive attorneys,
even second-year judge's law clerks are all required to make
the payment, according to court pleadings filed by Newark
attorney Frederick B. Lacey; he is a former federal judge and
U.S. attorney who is representing the New Jersey State Bar
Association in the case.</p>
<p>Last month, a New Jersey tax judge issued a temporary
restraining order requiring that all payments made by lawyers
to be held in an escrow until after a final hearing on the
new law's legality, tentatively scheduled for September.</p>
<p>The Medical Society of New Jersey, which regulates
doctors, has a separate suit pending and a federal
class-action suit on behalf of all the professional groups
affected by the law is pending in a federal district court in
Camden, N.J.</p>
<p>Several insurance companies, including Allstate Insurance
Co., the state's largest automobile insurer and a Sears,
Roebuck & Co. unit, also are challenging the law.</p>

<p>INSURER ORDERED to pay for AIDS treatment.</p>
<p>In another case involving insurers and AIDS, a New York
state court in Manhattan ordered Empire Blue Cross & Blue
Shield to pay for a bone-marrow transplant for a man who is
infected with the HIV virus, which causes AIDS. The insurer
had refused to pay for the $150,000 treatment, claiming it
was experimental. But Justice Elliott Wilk agreed with the
patient's attorneys that although the procedure may be new
for HIV patients, it is an appropriate therapy for rebuilding
the immune system.</p>
<p>The transplant isn't expected to rid the patient,
47-year-old Tom Bradley, of the HIV infection, but doctors
believe it could improve his health for an additional two
years, said Evan Wolfson, an attorney with Lambda Legal
Defense and Legal Education Fund.</p>
<p>Bone-marrow transplants are unlikely treatments for most
HIV patients because the procedure is usually performed only
when the patient has an identical twin who can act as donor.
Also, the treatment can be done only before the patient has
one of the opportunistic infections that often afflict HIV
patients.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Empire said the company hasn't decided
whether to appeal the decision. He said the transplant hasn't
been used widely enough to have been proved "beneficial and
appropriate" for Mr. Bradley's condition.</p>
