	<p class="article-leader">Eugene Roberts Jr., the editor who led the Philadelphia
Inquirer to 17 Pulitzer Prizes in 18 years and to dominance
in its market, is retiring.
   Mr. Roberts said in an interview that he wanted to quit
three years ago, but family responsibilities and a sweetened
contract changed his mind. "Now the time has come," he told a
somber Inquirer newsroom yesterday. Mr. Roberts, 58 years
old, is executive editor of the Inquirer and president of
Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., a unit of Miami-based
Knight-Ridder Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Knight-Ridder named Maxwell King, 46, to succeed Mr.
Roberts, effective Sept. 1, but at a lower rank. Mr. King, a
Roberts protege and an editor and executive with the paper
since 1972, will hold the posts of editor of the Inquirer and
executive vice president of Philadelphia Newspapers, which
also publishes the Philadelphia Daily News. He joined the
company as an editor in 1972 and has been vice president of
consumer marketing and distribution since 1987.</p>
<p>Revered by many journalists as an uncompromising editor
willing to spend large sums of money to get a story, Mr.
Roberts directed the Inquirer's surge in circulation, revenue
and profit over the past two decades. By 1982, the Inquirer's
ascendancy was complete -- its arch-rival, the Philadelphia
Bulletin, closed, and Philadelphia became a monopoly market
for Knight-Ridder, said John Morton, newspaper-industry
analyst for Lynch Jones & Ryan.</p>
<p>Mr. Morton estimated that the Inquirer will earn roughly
$70 million in operating profit this year, on revenue of
about $460 million. The paper accounts for about 20% of
Knight-Ridder's total operating profit and revenue from
newspapers, he said.</p>
<p>"Gene Roberts spent the money that it took to make the
Inquirer one of this country's leading newspapers," Mr.
Morton said.</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts will remain a consultant to Knight-Ridder. He
said that he wants to travel more and may take a university
teaching post.</p>
<p>Reporters for the Inquirer said there was palpable relief
in the newsroom yesterday when Knight-Ridder named a veteran
Inquirer editor to the top editorial post. But several
staffers expressed doubt that Mr. Roberts is retiring simply
because he wants to travel and teach. They said budget cuts
at the Inquirer, which is suffering from the advertising
slump hitting all U.S. papers, have made it increasingly
difficult for Mr. Roberts to pursue the type of hard-hitting,
investigative journalism that has earned him and the Inquirer
their renown.</p>
<p>"I have no doubt that given the financial pressures, the
{editor's} job has to be incredibly taxing, and a little of
the fun has to be gone," said Frederic Tulsky, a reporter
with the Inquirer since 1979 and one of its Pulitzer Prize
winners.</p>
<p>"It is certainly true that things are tighter this year
and there's a {budget} freeze on," Mr. Roberts said. "But I
think {Knight-Ridder} has shown restraint. We've had no cuts
since the freeze came in late last year."</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts said he's stepping down now, so "I'll still be
young enough to get back in if I get bored. Right now,
boredom sounds wonderful."</p>
<p>Sam McKeel, who worked closely with Mr. Roberts for 17
years at the Inquirer and was the paper's publisher from 1986
to 1989, said he was surprised to hear of Mr. Roberts's early
retirement.</p>
<p>"Gene and I used to go bonefishing together," said Mr.
McKeel, who left the Inquirer last year to become president
and chief executive officer of Sun-Times Co. in Chicago.
"When you bonefish, you talk about a lot of things. We never
had a conversation of any substance about retiring."</p>
<p>But James Batten, Knight-Ridder's chairman and chief
executive, said the company had to persuade Mr. Roberts not
to retire three years ago. Mr. Batten acknowledged the
financial pressures squeezing the Inquirer -- and all the
chain's papers. But he said, "We never had a budget
conclusion that Gene and we couldn't live with."</p>
