	<p class="article-leader">Move over, CDs: Investors who wander into many banks or
thrifts these days are likely to hear a pitch for
tax-deferred annuities.
   Those are savings vehicles that used to be sold
exclusively by brokers and insurance agents. Now a growing
number of banks and thrift institutions are selling them,
touting the ability of tax-free compounding to boost an 8%
return to 13%, or even more.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That can seem like a great deal, especially to someone
earning a feeble 5.5% or so in a passbook savings account.
And, after all, it's your old trusty banker who's making the
pitch.</p>
<p>But annuities sold in bank lobbies aren't any different
from those sold by brokers or insurance agents. Unlike
certificates of deposit, they aren't protected by federal
deposit insurance. Investors buying any annuity have to pay
attention to the financial soundness of the insurance company
that underwrites it. They also have to beware of terms and
conditions that can lock them into low rates for years.</p>
<p>"Don't let the location lull you," says Geoff Bobroff, a
senior vice president at Lipper Analytical Services Inc. who
tracks annuity performance. Investors should always check out
the merits of any annuity they consider buying, he says.</p>
<p>Annuities operate much like individual retirement
accounts. Investors fork over a lump sum (typically, $5,000
or more) for a "single-premium annuity," or pay in
installments for a "flexible-premium annuity." The money then
grows tax-deferred, until it is withdrawn at retirement. At
that time, investors can choose to take the money in a lump
sum, roll it over into another annuity or an IRA, or have
their money paid out to them in installments.</p>
<p>Over half of large banks and thrifts -- those with $750
million in assets or more -- now offer annuities, and will
sell approximately $9 billion in annuities this year, up from
$7 billion in 1989, according to a survey by Kenneth Kehrer
Associates of Princeton, N.J.</p>
<p>The banks' biggest selling point is convenience. Customers
can purchase an annuity as easily as they buy a CD. Some
banks, including New York's Citibank, count annuity balances
towards no-fee checking.</p>
<p>The annuities most commonly sold in banks and thrifts are
"fixed annuities," so-called because the interest rate is
fixed for the first year or so. Thereafter it is guaranteed
not to fall below a certain point, usually 3% to 5%.</p>
<p>Sales brochures for annuities offered by several New York
banks all contain charts showing how an initial cash deposit
grows to Mount Everest size over 20 or 30 years, given a
hypothetical return of 8% and the magic of tax-free
compounding. A taxable investment, also shown on the charts,
grows to only a molehill.</p>
<p>But investors have no assurance they'll actually get that
hypothetical 8% a year. Instead, annuities guarantee an
initial interest rate for the first year or so. Thereafter,
the rate investors get will be reset periodically, usually
annually, depending on how successfully the insurer invested
the money and the percentage the insurer keeps for itself.</p>
<p>This makes it important for investors to ask the issuer
about the rates it has paid over the past several years, says
Mr. Kehrer. Examining the three-year performance of bank-sold
annuities, he finds that "the company with the highest
initial rate doesn't have the highest three-year
performance."</p>
<p>How do rates on bank-sold annuities compare with others?
The average initial rate of the 30 annuities most frequently
sold by banks and thrifts is 8.41%. That's slightly lower
than the average rate paid on annuities sold by brokers and
slightly higher than the average paid on those sold by
insurance agents, says Mr. Kehrer.</p>
<p>"Broker-sold annuities tend to have higher rates because
they have lower commissions, or also because the portfolios
contain riskier, high-yield securities," he says. On the
other hand, annuities sold by agents tend to pay lower rates
because the agents earn higher commissions, he says.
Investors should also compare surrender penalties. Most
annuities impose surrender charges that typically start at 7%
of the account balance during the first year, and then phase
out by 1% a year over the next six years.</p>
<p>Some annuities come with "bail-out" provisions that enable
investors to withdraw their money without surrender
penalties, if the annual interest rate is lowered below a
certain preset minimum. Security Pacific, for example, gives
investors the option to bail out if the renewal rate falls
more than one percentage point below the initial rate.
Annuities with bail-out provisions usually pay a quarter to a
third of a percentage point less than others, says Mr.
Kehrer.</p>
<p>Whatever the surrender penalty, annuity investors who
withdraw money before age 59 1/2 are subject to income taxes
on the earnings that they take out plus a 10% federal
penalty.</p>
<p>Finally, before investing, investors should ask about the
financial soundness of the insurance company that issues the
annuity. Bank officials say that annuities they sell are from
high-quality issuers.</p>
<p>"We do a rigorous amount of due diligence," says Ray
LuBien, executive vice president for marketing for Security
Pacific Insurance Group in San Diego. The bank insurance
group looks at ratings by A.M. Best Co. and Standard & Poor's
Corp., and hires third-party consultants to evaluate
insurers' portfolio quality, he says.</p>
<p>Some others say, however, that investors should be just as
cautious with bank-sold annuities as they ought to be with
annuities sold by brokers or insurance agents. "What makes
them so smart that they can evaluate an insurer?" says
Lipper's Mr. Bobroff. "I don't believe Merrill Lynch would do
any more or less due diligence than Bank of America."</p>
<p>He suggests that investors are safer if they choose
annuities with interest rates that aren't out of line with
the market as a whole. "If the rates are significantly
higher," such as 10%, he says, "the investor should be put on
notice," since the insurer may be making more risky
investments in an effort to achieve the hoped-for higher
return.</p>
