	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. said the agency's fund to cover bank failures
may suffer a bigger-than-expected loss for the year, possibly
as much as $2 billion.
   The FDIC chief, William Seidman, in testimony before the
Senate Banking Committee, also said that lowering the
$100,000 insurance ceiling on individual accounts wouldn't
save the government much money in bank and savings-and-loan
failures. Mr. Seidman, when asked about attempting to limit
depositors to one insured account -- another idea popular on
Capitol Hill -- said it deserves to be studied but would pose
"great administrative problems."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To lower possible costs to the government, the FDIC chief
recommended placing stricter limits on the lending areas in
which banks can use insured deposits. He also called for
international agreements to set procedures for handling
failures of big financial institutions. Bailouts of big banks
have accounted for most of the FDIC's costs in recent years,
but regulators have been reluctant to impose larger losses on
depositors in the big banks partly because authorities in
other countries usually cover all deposits in failures. Mr.
Seidman and other regulators have pointed out that U.S. banks
could lose customers if their depositors are treated more
harshly than depositors in banks overseas.</p>
<p>Mr. Seidman told the committee that spreading real estate
problems and other loan woes could cause enough bank failures
to give the FDIC's bank insurance fund a major loss this
year. A month ago, a top aide to Mr. Seidman suggested that a
loss was likely this year and that a $2 billion loss was the
"worst-case scenario" if a big bank failure occurred.
Yesterday, Mr. Seidman's comments appeared to indicate that
the agency believes a big loss is likely.</p>
<p>Asked by reporters about the likelihood of a $2 billion
loss, Mr. Seidman said that "it's not unreasonable to say
that's the preferred prediction." But he would neither
elaborate nor say whether the FDIC expects a large bank
failure. Though FDIC officials won't discuss individual
institutions, the focus of attention is clearly on ailing
Northeast banks, in particular Boston-based Bank of New
England, which has been forced to set aside hundreds of
millions of dollars for possible real estate losses and was
prodded into a management shake-up by regulators.</p>
<p>Asked about the general economic situation in the region,
Mr. Seidman said, "I don't think conditions are improving in
New England. They may be hitting bottom."</p>
<p>The FDIC's bank fund now stands at $13.2 billion, after
losses of $851 million in 1989 and $4.24 billion in 1988, the
first losses in the agency's history.</p>
<p>The $13.2 billion translates to about 70 cents for every
$100 in insured deposits at banks, a figure policymakers
believe is dangerously low. The FDIC believes that $1.25 for
each $100 is a healthy level, and last year's
savings-and-loan bailout bill increased the premiums paid by
banks with the goal of rebuilding the fund.</p>
<p>With political sensitivity high over Congress's role in
the S&L debacle, several senators pressed Mr. Seidman
yesterday about whether the FDIC will be able to handle
future bank failures without calling on taxpayer funds. "As
far as we can tell now, the {insurance} fund is adequate to
handle any failures that we can identify at this time," Mr.
Seidman said.</p>
<p>The FDIC chairman noted that real estate loan problems
continue to plague banks and show no signs of abating.
Moreover, he said, as banks have lost many of their best
corporate borrowers to the securities markets they have been
forced into making real estate lending a bigger portion of
their business. "Many banks' earnings are directly related to
real estate values," Mr. Seidman said. And, he said, "We have
the weakest real estate markets that we've seen in this
country for many years."</p>
<p>On the issue of deposit insurance reform and restructuring
the financial industry, Mr. Seidman renewed his calls for
tearing down the barriers that prevent banks from fully
entering securities, insurance and other lines of business.
He echoed testimony last week by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, who said that making banks more profitable and
competitive is as important as changing the deposit insurance
system itself.</p>
<p>But Mr. Seidman suggested that the government could limit
its exposure to the risky activities by limiting banks to
using insured deposits in "reasonable, conservative and safe"
investments such as home mortgages and loans to highly rated
corporations. Mr. Seidman didn't offer specific proposals for
change, because the Treasury Department is studying deposit
insurance and the financial industry and plans to make
recommendations by early next year.</p>
