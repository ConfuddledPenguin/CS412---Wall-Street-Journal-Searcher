	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A Senate Appropriations subcommittee
rejected fiscal 1991 funding sought by the Bush
administration to establish a National Drug Intelligence
Center under the Justice Department and drug czar William
Bennett.
   Mr. Bennett is seeking an initial $46 million for the
center, but the Senate panel chose instead to apply the money
to expand an existing anti-drug program aimed at areas of
intensive narcotics traffic. Four metropolitan areas --
Houston, Los Angeles, Miami and New York -- and the Southwest
border region have been designated as targets for the
funding, which would triple to $82 million, including an
estimated $32 million for state and local aid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed intelligence center has been a central part
of Mr. Bennett's drug strategy. But critics in Congress have
argued that the project represents a financial burden to the
Justice Department and could prove disruptive to drug
intelligence operations by other agencies.</p>
<p>"If we don't get this, we'll be partially blind in the war
on drugs," said John Walters, Mr. Bennett's chief of staff
and national security adviser. But despite its stated goals,
the administration's initiative appears weakest with the very
lawmakers who sit both on the Appropriations panel and the
Senate Intelligence Committee.</p>
<p>The decision to deny the funding yesterday had the backing
of Sens. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.) and Alfonse D'Amato
(R., N.Y.), both on the Intelligence Committee. Moreover,
within the full Appropriations Committee, Sen. Ernest
Hollings (D., S.C.), himself a member of the Intelligence
Committee, has taken the lead in challenging funding for the
new center.</p>
<p>Budget and local politics appear to play a part as well.
By reallocating the funds to cover state and local grants,
lawmakers would directly benefit their constituencies in the
Southwest and New York, for example.</p>
<p>"We still think it is a high priority," said Joseph
McHugh, legislative liaison for Mr. Bennett. But he
acknowledged that the Senate strategy could prove attractive
to Southwest and Los Angeles-area lawmakers who dominate the
comparable House subcommittee, which has so far supported
funding for the intelligence center.</p>
<p>The debate over drug policy comes as part of a larger
$20.7 billion bill funding the Treasury Department and Postal
Service for the new fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. An
estimated $5.9 billion is provided for the Internal Revenue
Service, a 7.2% increase over current spending but still less
than the $6.1 billion requested by the administration.</p>
<p>Unlike the House measure, the Senate bill sets no specific
target for increased IRS tax enforcement against
foreign-owned U.S. companies. But in response to a request by
the agency, the Senate bill would give the IRS new authority
to hire outside experts in support of investigations and
litigation efforts against foreign-owned corporations.</p>
