	<p class="article-leader">BENTON HARBOR, Mich. -- Whirlpool Corp. and Japan's
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. said they formally
established a joint venture that will make vacuum cleaners in
the U.S. for domestic and export markets.
   To form the venture, the Osaka, Japan, concern purchased a
majority position in what was formerly Whirlpool's Danville,
Ky., division. Terms of the transaction, including
Matsushita's specific stake, weren't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Whirlpool announced in February that it was seeking a
buyer for the division, which makes vacuum cleaners primarily
for resale by Sears, Roebuck & Co. under the Kenmore brand
name.</p>
<p>But in June, Whirlpool reached a tentative agreement with
Matsushita to form the venture, which is expected to permit
the Japanese concern to expand its manufacturing and
marketing base in North America.</p>
