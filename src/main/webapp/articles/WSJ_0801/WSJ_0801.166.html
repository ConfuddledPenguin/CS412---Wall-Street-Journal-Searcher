	<p class="article-leader">NEW ORLEANS -- Freeport-McMoRan Inc. said it will acquire
all the shares of Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas Co. that it
doesn't already own, citing lackluster investor interest in
the unit.
   In March, the diversified energy concern converted an oil
and gas limited partnership into Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas,
a corporation, in hopes of broadening the investment appeal
of the operation and avoiding what it called "onerous" tax
reporting requirements for partnerships.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Yesterday, Freeport-McMoRan said its "expectation that
Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas would be a more attractive
investment vehicle" than its predecessor "has not been
realized in the marketplace." It said it will issue between
0.270 and 0.329 share of its common stock for each share of
the oil and gas company not already held, according to a
formula it has devised. The parent owns 81.5% of the unit.</p>
<p>A Freeport-McMoRan spokesman said the exact number of
additional shares to be issued hasn't been determined,
although it is expected to be between 6.2 million and seven
million. Freeport-McMoRan had about 54 million shares
outstanding at June 30, and Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas about
23 million.</p>
<p>Freeport-McMoRan stock closed yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading at 35.125 a share, down 25 cents.
Freeport-McMoRan Oil & Gas stock, also traded on the New York
exchange, soared two dollars a share to ten dollars a share.</p>
<p>Separately, Freeport-McMoRan said it would extend payment
of a special 25-cents-per-share cash dividend for the next
four quarters, in addition to its regular quarterly dividend.
The company has been paying the special dividend since
January 1989. Its regular dividend is 37.5 cents a share.</p>
