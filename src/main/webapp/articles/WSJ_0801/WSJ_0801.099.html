	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The National Transportation Safety Board --
spreading around blame for the nation's worst oil spill --
cited an array of failures by the Exxon Valdez's captain, his
third mate, Exxon Shipping Co., the Coast Guard, and state
and local authorities.
   The board's findings, which were unanimous, end a 16-month
investigation into the March 24, 1989, accident in which a
900-foot tanker smashed into Bligh Reef near the Alaskan port
of Valdez, rupturing eight cargo tanks and spilling 258,000
barrels of oil into Prince William Sound. The oil caused
extensive environmental damage and $2 billion has been spent
so far to clean up the spill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The board said the third mate, who was navigating the
vessel at the time of the grounding, didn't maneuver the ship
properly "because of fatigue and excessive workload." It said
his boss, Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, wasn't supervising because
of his "impairment from alcohol." The captain left the bridge
minutes before the third mate began a crucial right turn -- a
turn in which improper execution resulted in the vessel
hitting the jagged submerged reef.</p>
<p>The board said that other direct causes were the failure
of Exxon to "provide a fit master and a rested and sufficient
crew," the ineffectiveness of the Coast Guard's
traffic-tracking service in the area and the lack of
effective piloting services.</p>
<p>The board said that tests on blood samples drawn from Mr.
Hazelwood 10 hours after the accident indicated his
blood-alcohol content was high at the time the Valdez ran
aground. But Mr. Hazelwood, who has a history of
drunken-driving convictions, has steadfastly denied being
drunk.</p>
<p>Yesterday, his attorney, Thomas Russo, said that the
board's conclusions about his client's alcohol use were
"ridiculous." He reiterated contentions that the blood
samples taken from Mr. Hazelwood were mishandled by a
California laboratory. But James Kolstad, chairman of the
safety agency, dismissed those contentions, saying that the
"samples weren't tampered with."</p>
<p>In March, an Anchorage jury convicted Mr. Hazelwood on the
misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil. But it
acquitted him of charges of being under the influence of
alcohol, reckless endangerment and felony criminal mischief.
He is appealing his conviction.</p>
<p>Last week, Mr. Hazelwood's license was suspended for nine
months after he pleaded no contest to charges of negligently
leaving the tanker bridge and violating a ban on drinking
under four hours before sailing. The Coast Guard dropped
charges of drunkenness.</p>
<p>The safety board also criticized Exxon Shipping for
failing to monitor Mr. Hazelwood's drinking problem, and said
the Coast Guard did an inadequate job of tracking ships and
icebergs in the area. The agency faulted Alaska's piloting
rules, saying that in the case of the Valdez, the tanker
shouldn't have been allowed near Bligh Reef unless a
federally licensed pilot familiar with the waterway was
aboard. Such a requirement is now in effect.</p>
<p>The safety board's findings aren't admissible in court.
However, facts uncovered as part of the investigation can be
admitted as evidence.</p>
