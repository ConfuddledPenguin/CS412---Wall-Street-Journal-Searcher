	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Some top Japanese securities companies said they
received instructions from the Tokyo Regional Taxation Bureau
to pay penalty taxes for not reporting what the bureau calls
compensation paid to major clients for losses incurred from
the "Black Monday," global, stock market plunge.
   "Big Four" firms Yamaichi Securities Co. Ltd., Nippon
Kangyo Kakumaru Securities Co. Ltd. and New Japan Securities
Co. Ltd. were among 14 securities companies that were
reportedly ordered to pay a total of 7.5 billion yen ($50.7
million) in penalty taxes for a total of 16.5 billion yen
that was viewed as compensation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When major institutional and individual clients suffered
huge losses in the stock market crash, the securities
companies allegedly compensated their clients by selling
convertible bonds, warrants and government bonds at
discounted prices and later buying them back at higher
prices.</p>
<p>Each company had supposedly reported costs of such
transactions as losses caused by ordinary equity
transactions. But the tax agency identified the reported
deals as compensation, which should have been reported as
entertainment expenses or donations, subject to taxation.</p>
