	<p class="article-leader">BRITAIN'S WILTING EXPORTS</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Confederation of British Industry's latest economic
survey showed that export orders during the four months ended
June 30 were flat, despite company expectations in the spring
that they would rise.</p>
<p>With the government's policy of high interest rates
cooling off demand within the United Kingdom, companies have
looked to exports to offset the domestic slowdown. Now
companies surveyed by the CBI said they were less optimistic
about exports than they had been in April. With total orders
dropping, the CBI said, "manufacturing output is set to fall
back, giving a clear warning of the possibility of a
recession in the second half of this year."</p>
<p>Clouding British exports are price increases brought about
by a combination of rising inflation and higher exchange
rates for the pound.</p>
<p>David Kern, chief economist of National Westminster Bank
PLC, said companies face "weakening domestic demand and
worsening export competitiveness" but also believes the CBI
is probably advancing an overly gloomy line. He said the
confederation, whose members have long been pressing the
government to lower base interest rates, "has always been
arguing -- with remarkable predictability -- that monetary
policy is too tight."</p>
<p>RECYCLING IN AUSTRALIA</p>
<p>Australian Telecommunications Corp., the government
telephone monopoly commonly known as Telecom Australia, is
starting a recycling program for old telephone books. Mel
Ward, managing director of Telecom Australia, said a 12-month
pilot program in Melbourne would find the most efficient
method of gathering outdated directories from customers.
Recycled telephone-book paper will be used by other companies
to make such things as building insulation and seedling pots.</p>
<p>BERLIN'S TRAFFIC JAM</p>
<p>A million extra cars have crowded Berlin's streets since
the Wall was opened last fall, creating traffic chaos and
heavy smog. "We are on the verge of collapse," a West Berlin
traffic official, Klaus Krueger, told the Berliner Zeitung.
He estimated that 1.2 million extra cars will have registered
in the city by the end of the year, many belonging to East
Germans able to buy cars freely for the first time. Berlin
police will start towing away cars for the first time, Mr.
Krueger added.</p>
<p>HONDURAS'S BANANA STRIKE</p>
<p>Chiquita Brands International said it had accepted a
proposal by Honduran President Rafael Leonardo Callejas for a
25.4% wage increase to end a month-old strike by 10,000
banana workers. There was no immediate reaction from the
union to the U.S. company's announcement that it would raise
the basic wage by $62.50, to $308.50 a month. The union
ordered the walkout to back demands for a 54.57% wage
increase. Chiquita at first refused to negotiate and later
limited the acceptable increase to 14.33%.</p>
<p>TAIWAN BANK IN TOKYO</p>
<p>Taiwan's Chang Hwa Commercial Bank Ltd. said it would open
an office in Tokyo. It would be the first Taiwan bank to set
up shop in Japan since the Nationalists fled the mainland for
Taiwan more than 40 years ago. Banking analysts in Tokyo
noted that Chang Hwa's announcement came in the wake of
Japan's decision to lift its freeze on official lending to
China. With Tokyo's loan package for China now reactivated,
"it would be difficult for the Chinese to come down hard" on
Japan for allowing a Taiwan bank office in Tokyo, said one
analyst.</p>
<p>NEW EUROPEAN AIRLINE</p>
<p>Switzerland's regional carrier Crossair has teamed up with
a Czechoslovak air-ambulance and agricultural-spraying
operator, Slovair, to create a commuter airline called Tatra
Air. Crossair said the new carrier would begin flying next
spring, initially from Bratislava to Munich and Zurich with a
37-seat Saab 340 turboprop leased from Crossair. Crossair
said Tatra would have a capital base of 21 million
Czechoslovak crowns ($1.3 million), a third of which will
come from Crossair and the rest from Slovair.</p>
<p>COMPETITION WITHIN THE EC</p>
<p>The level of national aid to European Community industry
remains unacceptably high, posing a serious threat to fair
competition within the single market, the EC Commission said.</p>
<p>From 1986 to 1988, state aid in the community totaled 82.3
billion European currency units ($106 billion) a year,
according to an EC survey.</p>
<p>"Although there has been some significant progress, the
continued high level of aid poses serious threats to a system
of undistorted competition and the completion of the internal
market," Competition Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said.</p>
<p>EC officials said the commission would start taking a
tougher line with member states, which under EC law must have
all aid plans approved by the commission.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>China's domestic postal rates were increased for the first
time in 40 years. Official media said domestic postal rates
had been raised 150%, to .10 yuan (two U.S. cents) from .04
yuan for a local delivery and to .20 yuan from .08 yuan for
intercity letters. . . . Cuba's Internal Trade Ministry
ordered the rationing of razor blades, with an initial
monthly allotment of two blades per adult male.</p>
