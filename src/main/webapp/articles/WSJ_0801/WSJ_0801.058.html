	<p class="article-leader">New York investment analyst Theodore Forstmann, speaking
at a Manhattan Institute dinner this spring:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I would submit that since the day of {J.P.} Morgan, credit
has been increasingly socialized by the federal government.
It has introduced all manner of insurance toward this end.
Parenthetically, many feel that this process sped up
dramatically during President Reagan's term in office -- a
curious result, given his political beliefs. Obviously the
insured deposits in the S&Ls created the perfect context for
the debacle which has ensued. This insurance created a
no-lose situation that many people of dubious character could
not wait to take advantage of. In fact, the final bill to the
American people of $500 billion will exceed the entire amount
the country needed to finance all of World War II.</p>
