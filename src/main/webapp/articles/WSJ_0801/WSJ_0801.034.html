	<p class="article-leader">Xerox Corp. said profit dropped 27% in the second quarter,
but the company produced some encouraging results in both its
major business areas.
   Most of the profit lag came from two factors, Xerox said:
Austerity measures imposed by the government of Brazil, where
the company sells a lot of copiers, and lower capital gains
at its Crum & Forster Inc. insurance subsidiary.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts focused, however, on indicators they consider
more fundamental to the company's financial health, such as
gross margins, expense control and Crum & Forster's "combined
ratio," a measure of the insurer's financial state -- all of
which moved in the right direction.</p>
<p>Excluding the Brazilian results, Xerox's profit from
office equipment advanced a robust 19% from the year-ago
period. And Xerox signaled that the company's recent
disastrous performance in financial services -- the business
contributed only $2 million in profit during the quarter, a
96% drop -- may finally be bottoming out.</p>
<p>"There are some things going on here that could make Xerox
look attractive," said Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. "I'm not yet convinced, but they seem to be doing a lot
of the right things."</p>
<p>For the quarter, Xerox reported net income of $130
million, or $1.16 a share, compared with $179 million, or
$1.67 a share, in the year-ago period. Revenue rose 3%, to
$4.52 billion from $4.38 billion.</p>
<p>Those results came in below analysts' predictions, which
averaged about $1.25 a share, but estimates were so
scattershot and unsure that the disappointment wasn't
meaningful. Xerox's much-battered stock took a 25-cent drop
at the start of trading, but recovered to close at $45.625,
up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
<p>"I think this stock is as burned out as it's going to
get," said Alex Henderson of Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., who raised his rating on Xerox to a "buy" yesterday.
"There were some very nice numbers this quarter, and I'm
optimistic about the second half."</p>
<p>That optimism was shared by most Xerox watchers, but
tempered by Xerox's poor track record in recent years,
sluggish revenue growth and leeriness about a major
new-product push slated for this fall.</p>
<p>Peter Enderlin of Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. said he
cut his estimate of Xerox's 1990 earnings to $4.90 from
$5.10, excluding write-offs, and is maintaining his "hold"
rating. Still, he has started advising clients to buy the
stock "on weakness."</p>
<p>But Daniel Mandresh of Merrill Lynch & Co., who predicts
Xerox will earn between $4 and $4.50 this year, remains
unconvinced. "I'm absolutely impressed by how Xerox has
controlled its expenses, but I look at the top line first,"
he said. "I don't see any reason to adjust my thinking yet."</p>
<p>For the first half, Xerox posted a loss of $124 million,
or $1.77 a share, compared with a profit of $337 million, or
$3.14 a share, in 1989. The 1990 results include a
first-quarter write-off of $375 million for bad real estate
investments. Revenue rose 3%, to $8.77 billion from $8.52
billion.</p>
