	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Corporate chairmen and presidents who
substantially increased their personal stakes in their
companies in recent months made some tidy paper profits,
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.
   Consider 35 stock purchases of $100,000 or more by
chairmen or presidents since April 1. The top executives'
odds of making a profit on their shares appeared to hinge not
on how much money they spent, but on how big a chunk of their
total holdings the new shares represented, an analysis of SEC
filings indicates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chairmen or presidents of 10 companies felt bullish enough
to increase their stakes by more than one-third -- and all
but two have seen the share price of their company's stock go
up. Moreover, most of them chalked up gains, at least on
paper, that beat Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which
rose 4.7% since March 31.</p>
<p>The big guns didn't always guess right. Taking into
account purchases that increased the insiders' total holdings
marginally, the top insiders as a group managed to buy their
own companies' stocks before the price went up 19 out of 35
times.</p>
<p>But when they were right, they were very right.</p>
<p>Robert Weinstein, president of HMO America Inc., a
Chicago-based health-maintenance organization, increased his
total holdings in the company by 62%, SEC filings show. He
paid $231,500, or $4.63 a share, for 50,000 shares in May.
The stock closed yesterday in over-the-counter trading at $7.</p>
<p>Dr. Weinstein said his purchase was a bet that in coming
years HMOs will become "a much more predominant form of
health insurance." Moreover, on a technical basis, he said
the shares were trading at a "ridiculously low"
price/earnings ratio: five, compared with a P/E of 12 to 16
for other HMO stocks.</p>
<p>HMO America has been "tremendously undervalued vs. other
HMOs" because the company "has not made the effort to deal
with Wall Street," Dr. Weinstein said. To correct that, he
said, it plans an aggressive investor relations program.</p>
<p>Scott Nelson, president of EFI Electronics Corp. of Salt
Lake City, spent about $335,000 on 125,000 shares of the
manufacturer of electrical and computer equipment on June 26,
SEC filings show. That raised his stake by 1,875%. Mr. Nelson
paid an average price of $2.68 a share, but the stock closed
yesterday in over-the-counter trading at $3.69.</p>
<p>Mr. Nelson said he bought his shares from Hospital Corp.
of America, which had decided to divest itself of a stake of
about 17% in EFI. He said that he is "happy with the growth
rate of the company" and bullish because recent costly
expenditures for research and development and automation have
been completed.</p>
<p>Nathaniel Gross, president of Bell Savings Holdings Inc.,
Upper Darby, Pa., bought 75,000 shares on July 12, SEC
filings show. His purchase came at a time of some problems
for the company's Bell Savings Bank unit, but Mr. Gross said
the problems are being solved and that he thinks the shares
were a bargain.</p>
<p>He paid $1.50 a share, just above the stock's 52-week low
of $1.25 and well below its 52-week high of $10.50. In
over-the-counter trading, the shares closed at $1.75.</p>
<p>On July 16, the Office of Thrift Supervision imposed a
cease-and-desist order on Bell Savings Bank, limiting its
lending and deposit growth and requiring tighter
administrative and regulatory compliance procedures. Early
this year, the company had announced that the downturn in the
real estate market had negatively affected its loan
portfolio. Bell Savings has agreed to add about $12 million
to loan-loss reserves, bringing the total to $27.5 million at
June 30.</p>
<p>Mr. Gross said Bell Savings now has "adequate loan-loss
reserves," and that he has "complete confidence in the
company."</p>
<p>Another so-far successful purchase was made by Bryan
Lodder, president of Guilford Mills Inc. He bought 9,000
shares of the Greensboro, N.C., textile manufacturer for
$148,500 on June 29, according to SEC filings. He paid $16.50
a share. The stock closed on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday at $19 a share. Mr. Lodder declined to comment, and
a company spokesman said only that it was a "good purchase."</p>
<p>In a previously reported transaction, Thomas M. Garrott,
president of National Commerce Bancorp, spent $1.6 million on
78,285 shares of the Memphis, Tenn., bank holding company in
May, filings with the SEC show. Mr. Garrott increased his
holdings in National Commerce by 34% and paid an average
price of $20.78 a share. In over-the-counter trading,
National Commerce Bancorp shares closed yesterday at $23.</p>
<p>Not all the top executives who increased their holdings
substantially have lucked out. At Action Industries Inc., a
Cheswick, Pa., distributor of promotional literature and
marketing programs, company president and first-time buyer R.
Craig Kirsch spent $140,850 on 45,000 shares of stock, SEC
filings show. He paid $3.13 a share. The stock has eased to
$2.75 in American Stock Exchange trading. He wasn't available
for comment, and the company declined to comment.</p>
