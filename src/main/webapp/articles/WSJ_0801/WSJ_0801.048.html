	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- West Germany's Federal Cartel Office
yesterday said it has made a preliminary ruling against
Volkswagen AG's practice of requiring its dealers to offer
customers only leasing contracts from a VW financial-services
subsidiary.
   The West Berlin-based antitrust watchdog said in the
informal decision that Volkswagen's dealers are being
unfairly hindered from seeking working relationships with
other leasing companies, which at the same time are being
deprived of potential customers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ruling, which could be made legally binding at a later
date, is important since Volkswagen is West Germany's largest
producer of cars, via its Volkswagen, Audi and Seat brands.
The company also claims to be Europe's largest car maker.</p>
<p>The Cartel Office noted that the Wolfsburg-based company's
V.A.G. Leasing G.m.b.H. subsidiary controls about 20% of the
West German vehicle leasing market.</p>
