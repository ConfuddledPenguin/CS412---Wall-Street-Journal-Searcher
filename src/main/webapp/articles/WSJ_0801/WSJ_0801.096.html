	<p class="article-leader">The Federal Communications Commission approved MCI
Communications Corp.'s planned acquisition of Telecom USA
Inc., Atlanta.
   The agency's Common Carrier Bureau found that the
combination "would continue to be subject to vigorous
competition" from American Telephone & Telegraph Co., United
Telecommunications' Sprint Communications Corp. unit and
other long-distance carriers. MCI is the U.S.'s second
largest long-distance company, and Telecom USA is the fourth
largest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An MCI spokeswoman said the company expects to complete
the $1.25 billion merger this month after receiving approval
from various state regulators.</p>
