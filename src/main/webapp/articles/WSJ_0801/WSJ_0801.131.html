	<p class="article-leader">LONG GROVE, Ill. -- Kemper Corp., racked by $161.1 million
in charges to cover problems at its securities-brokerage
division, reported a second-quarter loss of $111.2 million,
or $2.28 a share.
   In the year-earlier period, the insurance and
investment-services concern had net income of $121.7 million,
or $2.46 a share. Revenue rose 12% in the latest period to
$757.9 million, from $677.8 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The one-time charges that hurt Kemper's latest results
include $141.1 million -- some $15 million more than it had
earlier projected -- to cover an overhaul effort at its
brokerage operations. The company earlier said it would take
a $126.5 million charge to write down good will and other
intangible assets at the brokerage concerns, and to cover
costs associated with a staff-reduction program in that
segment.</p>
<p>Additionally, the results include a previously disclosed
$19.5 million net charge to cover an arbitration panel's May
finding that the company should pay a former employee $38.2
million.</p>
<p>Kemper said the revamping of its brokerage operations "is
proceeding on track," and that it continues to expect to have
the restructuring "in place by year end." At quarter's end,
the company said, it has cut the brokerage segment's work
force by about 200 employees, "well on our way to our 600
target."</p>
<p>Through the latest first half, Kemper's life-insurance
operation showed narrower margins, and earnings at its
property-casualty and reinsurance segment were off as well,
in part because of higher-than-normal losses from severe
weather in Europe and the U.S.</p>
<p>Kemper didn't separately break out the segments'
performance for the second quarter.</p>
