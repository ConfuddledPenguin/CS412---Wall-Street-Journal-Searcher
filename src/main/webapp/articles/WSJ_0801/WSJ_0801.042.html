	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Chrysler Corp. said second-quarter
earnings skidded 47% from a year ago, and would have plunged
into a loss without aggressive cost-cutting and surging
results from financial services.
   The No. 3 U.S. auto maker said it had net income of $180
million, or 81 cents a share, in the period. That compares
with net of $341 million, or $1.46 a share, a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chrysler's second-quarter 1990 results included one-time
charges of $22 million for canceling plans to build a small
Jeep with French auto maker Regie Nationale des Usines
Renault, and $13 million paid to some union employees who
took early retirement. Analysts said the charges cut
Chrysler's second-quarter earnings by about 10 cents a share.</p>
<p>The 1989 second-quarter earnings included a gain of $8
million, or four cents a share, from Gulfstream Aerospace
Corp., a unit Chrysler sold earlier this year.</p>
<p>Chrysler's second-quarter profit, while paper thin, showed
that the company's efforts to eliminate $1.5 billion in
operating costs are bearing fruit. Chrysler trimmed $250
million from second-quarter pretax operating costs compared
with a year ago, while pretax savings in the first six months
of the year reached $470 million. These figures are slightly
ahead of the company's goals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, net income at the company's Chrysler Financial
Corp. subsidiary leaped 49% to a second-quarter record of $85
million. Chrysler Financial attributed the increase to higher
interest-rate margins and gains from the sale of receivables.</p>
<p>Without the cost-cutting success and the record
contribution from financial services, Chrysler would have
shown an after-tax loss of $55 million, analysts said.</p>
<p>That's largely because the company sold fewer cars and
trucks while spending substantially more on buyer incentives
for each sale.</p>
<p>Jerome B. York, Chrysler's executive vice president,
finance, said the company spent an average of $1,200 per
vehicle on incentives in the second quarter, compared to just
$700 a year earlier. John A. Casesa, an analyst with Wertheim
Schroder & Co. in New York, estimated the higher incentives
cost Chrysler about $130 million, or 55 cents to 60 cents a
share.</p>
<p>Despite this extra spending, Chrysler pushed about 110,000
fewer vehicles out the doors of dealer showrooms, a decline
of 16%. Chrysler sold 585,615 vehicles in the quarter
compared with 695,552 a year earlier.</p>
<p>The auto maker blamed one-fourth of that decline on the
loss of the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon subcompact cars.
Chrysler stopped making those aged models in January after
their sales had fallen by more than 60%.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Chrysler stock closed unchanged at $15.125.</p>
<p>Although Chrysler finished the first six months of the
year with a negative cash flow of about $400 million, it
strengthened its actual cash holdings. Chrysler did this by
selling off its Gulfstream unit and by completing the $1.1
billion sale and leaseback of the Chrysler Technology Center
still under construction in Auburn Hills, Mich.</p>
<p>As a result of those deals, Chrysler had $4.3 billion in
cash and marketable securities on June 30, compared with $3.4
billion a year earlier and $2.1 billion at the end of last
year. Mr. York told analysts in a meeting yesterday that
Chrysler can raise an additional $2.5 billion by selling
"assets not related to the automotive business" and $1.6
billion by not funding its pensions in the next two years.</p>
<p>Chrysler has a total unfunded pension liability of $2.8
billion. But Mr. York told analysts that Chrysler has been
whittling down the balance, and thus could skip its planned
pension-fund payments of $800 million a year for 1990 and
1991 if that becomes necessary. But he described that as a
"worst-case scenario" and added that Chrysler expects to fund
its product-development programs without resorting to that
step.</p>
<p>"It's a cloudy picture at Chrysler," said Mr. Casesa.
"They're walking a tightrope there now, but they seem to be
getting their finances in order to become a lean and mean
organization like they were before" acquiring American Motors
Corp. in 1987.</p>
<p>Chrysler's earnings fell within the range expected by
industry analysts. But analysts said Mr. York hinted
yesterday that the company expects a third-quarter loss
larger than the consensus 53 cents-a-share loss predicted by
analysts and closer to the worst estimate of a 79
cents-a-share loss.</p>
<p>Chrysler will suffer a third-quarter loss partly because
it is closing the St. Louis and Windsor, Ontario, assembly
plants that build its most profitable vehicles, minivans, for
four weeks to retool for the 1991 models coming out this
fall. Scott Merlis, an analyst with Morgan Stanley & Co.,
estimates Chrysler will lose about $177 million in after-tax
profit from the lost minivan production alone.</p>
