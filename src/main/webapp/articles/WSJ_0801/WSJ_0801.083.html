	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department recommended allowing
Ameritech and Bell Atlantic Corp. to provide long-distance
service between the U.S. and New Zealand and to own
satellites and undersea cables for that service.
   The New Zealand government, as part of its effort to
privatize state-owned companies, selected Ameritech and Bell
Atlantic in June to buy the country's phone company, Telecom
Corp. of New Zealand, for about $2.46 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Justice Department made its recommendation to Judge
Harold H. Greene, who oversees the consent decree that broke
up the Bell System in 1984. Among other things, the consent
decree bars the seven regional Baby Bells from providing
long-distance service.</p>
<p>The department concluded that "there is no substantial
possibility" that the two companies will impede competition
in providing telecommunications between the U.S. and New
Zealand. The department asked Judge Greene to decide the
matter promptly because the transaction goes to closing on
Sept. 12.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Ameritech said the New Zealand partnership
was pleased and encouraged that the department "has
recommended the court act expeditiously to grant the waiver."</p>
