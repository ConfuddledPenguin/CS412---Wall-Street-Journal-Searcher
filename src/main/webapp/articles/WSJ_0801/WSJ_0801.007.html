	<p class="article-leader">UnionFed Financial Corp. said a sharply higher, $9.4
million provision for loan losses resulted in a June 30
fiscal fourth-quarter loss of $1.7 million for the Los
Angeles-based thrift holding company.
   In the year-earlier quarter, UnionFed had an $800,000
provision for loan losses and a $5.6 million profit for the
period. The latest period's loss equaled 23 cents a share,
compared with net income of $1.10 a share a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>UnionFed said its sharply higher addition to reserves
resulted from deterioration in commerical real estate markets
and sounded a back-to-basics theme. "The bank and its
subsidiaries intend to concentrate new lending and
development activities primarily on residential properties
located in California," Roger L. Kringen, chairman and chief
executive officer, said.</p>
