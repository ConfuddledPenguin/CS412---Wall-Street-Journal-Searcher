	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- STC PLC's proposed sale of 80% of its ICL Ltd.
subsidiary, Britain's only mainframe computer maker, to
Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan for #700 million ($1.33 billion) was
approved by shareholders, the British electronics company
said.
   The approval effectively lets STC proceed to complete the
sale of the stake, which was initially announced in July.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In STC's latest first-half results, ICL contributed the
most, despite a slump in pretax profit to #77.7 million from
#115 million a year earlier.</p>
