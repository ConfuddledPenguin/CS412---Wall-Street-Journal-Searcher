	<p class="article-leader">Dress Barn Inc. said directors authorized a buy-back of
about 10% of shares outstanding in an attempt to boost the
share price of the discount women's apparel retailer.
   The company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., said the
board authorized the purchase of as many as two million
shares. "We believe the stock had gone far below where it
should be," said Elliot Jaffe, Dress Barn's chairman and
chief executive officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Dress Barn
shares closed at $8.125, up 12.5 cents. The company
previously stepped in to buy back shares after the October
1987 market crash.</p>
<p>Contrary to market expectations that higher gasoline
prices will dampen customers' willingness to drive to
shopping centers, Mr. Jaffe argues that women will continue
to flock to discount department stores. Dress Barn operates
463 discount apparel stores nationwide and plans to increase
the number of outlets to 500 by the end of the year.</p>
