	<p class="article-leader">George Steinbrenner is taking a lot of abuse these days,
and it's safe to say he deserves most of what he's getting.
To many fans, he's the Nicolae Ceausescu of major league
baseball. But before we take George out to the courtyard and
shoot him, we should consider some of the other people
running professional teams in this country. Mr. Steinbrenner
may be a nightmare, but he is only marginally worse than many
of the others.
   I'm thinking of people like Bob Irsay, the Indianapolis
Colts owner who is nothing more than a bad advertisement for
Mayflower Movers. Then there is Al Davis of the football
Raiders, an itinerant man who wouldn't know loyalty if it
gave him a forearm shiver. San Diego Padres owner Tom Werner
has only been in the fraternity for a couple of months, but
already he's shown big league stuff. He's the one who asked
Roseanne Barr to sing the national anthem.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a group, team owners have done more damage to pro
sports than domed stadiums. They have demonstrated
unbelievable contempt for fans, and their loutish behavior
has taken much of the fun out of our games. Resentment builds
with every ticket-price increase, with every lockout, with
every cable television contract that shuts out more free
television viewers, with every second division team that
makes millions no matter how poorly it plays.</p>
<p>I propose we get rid of these egotistical deadbeats. We
should take our teams away from the owners and put them
instead in public hands. That won't be easy to pull off. But
if we've learned anything from the dramatic events of the
past few years, it is that the will of an oppressed and
wronged people should never be underestimated. Wasn't it just
months ago that Ceausescu was still commissioning statues of
himself, and his wife Elena redecorating the Summer Palace?</p>
<p>It's time for sports fans to revolt. We should take to the
streets in big league cities all over the country. We should
picket stadiums, shun concessions, forsake games, tie up
traffic. We should do all this in an effort to force the
owners to sell their teams to the public in a series of stock
offerings.</p>
<p>This would be a terrific deal for all involved. Investors
would get pieces of their favorite teams as well as stakes in
thriving monopolies. Initial stock prices would be set to
fetch each team's current market value, and given that
franchise values have been appreciating faster than Pete Rose
can say, "Bookmaker," there isn't an owner who wouldn't make
millions. To be fair, they could retain a piece of their
former teams, but no one person or organization could hold
more than, say 5% of the shares. That would prevent a return
to the sort of autocracies that exist today.</p>
<p>Before selling out, owners would sit down with
representatives of the league offices and put together a
10-person board of directors for each team. The board would
need no special expertise in sports, but rather just a sense
of civic responsibility and the ability to assemble a
competent management team. League offices would be involved
in this process to ensure that outgoing owners don't fill the
boardrooms with cronies.</p>
<p>The team board of directors would function like any
corporate board. The would be subject to election by the
shareholders. They would be responsible for hiring the top
executives, who would then put together staffs. Shareholders
would have nothing to do with player personnel moves or
coaching decisions -- but would of course retain the ability
to sell or buy when necessary. Some profit would be passed on
in the form of dividends. The rest would go back into the
organization.</p>
<p>In many cases, even with a change in ownership, an
organization's management rolls may not change at all. A team
like the Oakland A's, for example, is doing well under the
current regime, and there'd be no reason for shareholders to
push for its removal. But perennially feeble franchises like
the Cleveland Indians would likely be overhauled. If the
value of the franchise falls, as it probably would if the
team faltered, then management would be pressured to turn
things around. There'd be no time or place for the sort of
mischief today's owners often make.</p>
<p>The new ownership structure wouldn't necessarily lock
teams into one city. If a team can't cut it financially, then
a move to another town or a sale to outside investors could
easily be arranged. As discouraging as that would be for
some, at least the move would have been initiated by the
votes of thousands of shareholders, and not just the whim of
a single owner.</p>
<p>Public ownership won't guarantee anyone a world
championship. But it would give the fans and the communities
a voice. It would give them some recourse. They wouldn't have
to silently endure the sort of dreary mediocrity with which
the Mariners tortured Seattle for a dozen years. They
wouldn't have to pay ransoms in tax breaks and bond issues to
keep threatening owners from bolting to other towns. An Al
Davis -- or a George Steinbrenner -- would never be able to
break the fans' hearts again.</p>
