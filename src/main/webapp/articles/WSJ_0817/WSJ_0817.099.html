	<p class="article-leader">The National Labor Relations Board accused Sony Corp. of
America of violating federal labor laws in a campaign to oust
a clerical union from its New Jersey and New York facilities.
   In a complaint issued by the Newark, N.J., branch of the
NLRB, the federal agency claims the Sony Corp. unit
photographed employees who were union members and used the
photos in an anti-union videotape. The tape was shown to
workers shortly before they cast their votes in March to
decide whether to decertify the union. The election resulted
in a majority vote for decertification.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>What constitutes an unfair labor practice, according to
the complaint, is the company's failure to explain the
purpose of the photos to representatives of Local 888 of the
United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, an
affiliate of the AFL-CIO.</p>
<p>Union representatives had asked for such an explanation
after employees complained about invasion of privacy and
general uneasiness about having their pictures taken while
busy at work. The company had an obligation to explain the
actions, the NLRB claims, because the photographing affected
working conditions.</p>
<p>"People were intimidated by the photographing," said Larry
Cary, a labor lawyer at the New York law firm Vladeck,
Waldman, Elias & Engelhard, which represents the union. "It's
outrageous for the company to have invaded people's privacy
in this way, to use their pictures without their permission."</p>
<p>Alfred E. Hayes, a Sony vice president in Park Ridge,
N.J., said, "We don't believe the pictures were a problem and
we believe that the election should not be set aside because
of a legal technicality." He added that Sony intends to
contest the NLRB's complaint.</p>
<p>The complaint concerns Sony facilities in New York and six
New Jersey cities. A Sony memo dated March 7, 1990, shows
that decertification campaigns have been successful at Sony
facilities in other locations, including Niles, Ill., and
Hawaii. Mr. Hayes said that 300 of Sony's 10,000 employees in
the U.S. are unionized. The union involved in this dispute
represents the most Sony workers.</p>
<p>In its complaint, the NLRB also charges that the company
used a raffle of a 27-inch television before the election to
"induce" employees to vote for the company and against the
union. "You can have promotional contests to stimulate
interest in an election," said Mr. Cary, "but in this case
the value of the TV was too high for the board to believe it
was not meant to sway votes."</p>
<p>Mr. Cary said that if Sony is found to have had a legal
obligation to tell the union the reason for photographing the
employees, there may be an inference that unions have a right
to know the nature of an employer's anti-union campaign. "If
the board succeeds here, there may be a precedent for unions
to explore the strategies of employers," Mr. Cary said.</p>
<p>If the NLRB wins its case at an administrative hearing and
in possible subsequent court hearings, it will have the right
to conduct a second election.</p>

<p>SOVIETS SUE to halt U.S. watchmaker from selling "Soviet
Military Watch."</p>
<p>A Moscow firm, Vremex, accused Gruen Marketing Corp. of
false advertising and unfair competition in claiming that a
line of $100 quartz watches is connected to the Soviet
military. The suit accuses Gruen, a unit of Jewelcor Inc., of
marketing the allegedly fake "Soviet field watch" to
capitalize on consumers' current interest in the U.S.S.R.</p>
<p>Vremex -- which translates roughly into "Timex" -- is
seeking unspecified damages, a share of Gruen's profits and
corrective advertising. Vremex said Gruen's product,
introduced at Manhattan's Russian Tea Room last year, is
making it harder for Vremex to market authentic Soviet
timepieces.</p>
<p>Gruen, which says it is the official distributor of the
"red-hot fashion accessory" in the U.S., has touted the watch
in ads with the line: "Can 83,000 Soviet infantry commanders
be wrong? Nyet."</p>
<p>In its suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, Vremex
said, "The Gruen watch is not of Soviet origin,
authorization, sponsorship, design or manufacture. Nor is the
Gruen watch similar in style or design to watches actually
worn by the Soviet military." A spokeswoman for Gruen
declined to comment.</p>
<p>The watch, packaged in a caviar tin, is decorated with a
red star and the letters, CCCP, the Cyrillic abbreviation of
U.S.S.R.</p>

<p>FORMER OFFICER of defunct N.J. firm admits role in a bank
fraud scheme.</p>
<p>Bruce M. Bloom, former chief financial officer of Coated
Sales Inc., pleaded guilty to allegations involving a $52
million fraud scheme in federal district court in Newark. Mr.
Bloom admitted that he and other officers of the defunct
textile converting firm lied about the amount of the
company's assets in order to secure a $52 million
restructuring loan from BancBoston Financial Co. in Boston
two years ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Bloom faces a maximum of 10 years in prison and a
$250,000 fine for one count of bank fraud.</p>
<p>"The type of quick fix book-juggling admitted to in this
plea is a corporate tragedy," U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff
said. He wouldn't comment on other former Coated Sales
officials. Mr. Chertoff added that the company's collapse has
been estimated to have cost stockholders close to $100
million.</p>
<p>Mr. Chertoff said BancBoston has reached a settlement with
four other banks that held accounts for the company.</p>
<p>Shortly before Coated Sales filed for bankruptcy-court
protection in June 1988, the company was considered one of
the fastest-growing stocks on the Nasdaq over-the-counter
market, according to Mr. Chertoff. By securing the loan with
fictitious accounts receivable, the officers boosted the
corporation's net sales, total assets and earnings per share,
he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Bloom's attorney didn't return phone calls.</p>

<p>DIVORCED MOTHER allowed to relocate by a New York appeals
court.</p>
<p>The state appeals court in Ithaca, N.Y., overturned a
lower court decision barring Marie Reyes from moving
out-of-state with her children.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the courts have been reluctant to allow
divorced parents to move to distant locations except under
unusual circumstances. The courts don't want to adversely
affect the visitation rights of the non-custodial parent.</p>
<p>Ms. Reyes, who was divorced in 1989, had asked the court
for permission to move to Laramie, Wyo., where her present
husband is a tenured professor at the University of Wyoming.
Christopher A. Ball, Ms. Reyes's former husband and the
father of her children, had opposed the move.</p>
<p>In an unusual ruling, the appeals panel approved the move,
saying it would result in better educational and economic
opportunities for Ms. Reyes. In addition, the panel found
that the proposed relocation would result in Mr. Ball seeing
his children for longer durations and wouldn't unreasonably
disrupt his relationship with them. The court also reversed a
lower court decision awarding joint custody and gave Ms.
Reyes sole custody of the children.</p>
<p>"We live in a mobile society," said Cecile C. Weich, a
Riverdale, N.Y., lawyer representing Ms. Reyes. "The courts
have begun to recognize the fact that women and men will want
to move to join and form new families and to seek new
economic opportunities."</p>
<p>But Richard Stumbar, a lawyer for Mr. Ball, said that both
Ms. Reyes and her husband can find work in New York and there
is no compelling reason for the move. Mr. Stumbar, of the
Ithaca firm Bixler & Stumbar, said his client has appealed
the decision.</p>
<p>"The decision is a departure and a weakening of the rights
of the non-residential parent with respect to the children,"
said Mr. Stumbar.</p>

<p>NORIEGA CO-DEFENDANT is sentenced to 10 years in prison on
drug charges.</p>
<p>Enrique Pretelt, a Panamanian businessman and former close
associate of deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega, had
pleaded guilty in federal court in Tampa, Fla., in June to
two felonies -- conspiring with Mr. Noriega to import drugs
and launder money, and attempting to import 400,000 pounds of
marijuana into the U.S. through Panama.</p>
<p>His pledge to cooperate with the prosecution is expected
to bolster the government's case against Mr. Noriega, who is
awaiting trial on drug charges.</p>
<p>As part of his plea, Mr. Pretelt forfeited $108,000 in
proceeds from his drug activities to the U.S., the
prosecution said. The judge said he would reconsider Mr.
Pretelt's sentence after he completes cooperation on the
Noriega case.</p>
