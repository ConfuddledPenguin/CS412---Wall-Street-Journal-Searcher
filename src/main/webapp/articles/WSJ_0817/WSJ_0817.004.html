	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- PolyGram N.V. said it is preparing for several
major recorded-music releases this autumn, bolstering
expectations that the company's earnings will rebound in the
second half.
   PolyGram, which is 80%-owned by N.V. Philips of the
Netherlands, had reported that profit in the first half
dropped 20% to 118 million guilders ($66 million) from 148
million guilders, largely because of the costs of recent
acquisitions. Per-share earnings fell 26% to 69 Dutch cents
from 93 cents, reflecting an increase in the number of shares
outstanding. Sales, however, jumped 25% to a record 2.18
billion guilders from 1.75 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The profit drop had been expected, and analysts predicted
the company will still report an increase in net for the
year. James Golob of S.G. Warburg Securities in London
forecast net income for the year of 370.5 million guilders,
up 11% from 333 million last year.</p>
<p>David G. Fine, PolyGram's chief executive officer, said in
an interview that the first half was in line with the
company's plan for the year and that prospects for the second
half look strong. He declined to forecast results.</p>
<p>For the second half, the company plans releases by pop
stars Jon Bon Jovi, Elton John, Van Morrison, Jean Michel
Jarre, INXS and Robert Cray. It also promises several "major
event" recordings, including one based on this summer's
"Wall" concert in Berlin.</p>
<p>PolyGram had said results were hurt in the half by a drop
in interest income to eight million guilders from 46 million
guilders a year earlier. That decline reflected acquisitions
over the past year of two record companies, Island
International Ltd. and A&M Records Inc. In addition, PolyGram
said, it had to delay releases of new recordings as it
created a new distribution arm in the U.S. to integrate the
acquisitions.</p>
<p>PolyGram said it benefited strongly from the boom in sales
of classical-music compact disks. The company, whose
classical labels include Decca/London, Deutsche Grammophon
and Philips Classics, estimates its world market share in
classical music is 45%.</p>
<p>One of PolyGram's biggest sellers in the latest half was
"The Essential Pavarotti," a compilation of arias sung by
Luciano Pavarotti. That recording has sold more than 700,000
copies in Britain alone, giving Mr. Pavarotti what Mr. Fine
called "pop star status."</p>
<p>"It's become much more fashionable to play classical
music," Mr. Fine said. "It's not fuddy-duddy anymore."</p>
