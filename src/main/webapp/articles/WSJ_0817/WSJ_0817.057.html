	<p class="article-leader">YERSEKE, the Netherlands -- You might call this place
Mussel Beach.
   Wholesalers and packers of mussels line the waterfront in
Yerseke, the center of an industry that employs 1,500 people
and produces annual exports of about $50 million. Tomorrow,
as many as 50,000 people are expected to visit Yerseke for
the annual Mussel Day. Bands will play, fireworks will burst
and free mussels will be served. Not to be outdone, the
nearby town of Philippine will elect a mussel queen the
following weekend.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite all the hoopla, the mussel-farming business has
had a lot of sand kicked in its face recently. Winter storms
swept away large numbers of mussels just as they were growing
big enough to eat, and mussel farmers here in the province of
Zeeland expect an even bigger decline next year. Traders in
Yerseke think output will be 10% to 20% below average this
year and down as much as 60% next year.</p>
<p>Mussel growers fear they won't be able to raise prices
enough to cover the drop in volume. It's also ominous for
Belgians, who each year gobble up around two billion Zeeland
mussels. About 35% of Zeeland mussels go to Belgium, where
the onset of the mussel-eating season each August is, as one
restaurateur puts it, "truly an event." In his song "Jef,"
Belgian songwriter Jacques Brel could think of no better way
to console a lovelorn friend than a binge of moules and
frites -- mussels and french fries.</p>
<p>The outlook for next year's crop is bleak chiefly because
fishermen have found few baby mussels in the past two years.
"We don't know why," says Leo Lucas, manager of the mussel
producers association. At the Dutch Institute of Fisheries
Research, marine biologist Renger Dijkema ventures that
mussels' enemies, mainly bacteria, have thrived in the recent
mild winters. "The Belgians will be longing for their
mussels," Mr. Dijkema concludes sadly.</p>
<p>They probably will be paying dearly for them, too. Already
this year, wholesale mussel prices in Yerseke are up 20% to
25% from a year earlier. In Belgium, a serving of moules and
frites, traditionally a cheap meal, now can cost more than a
steak.</p>
<p>Growing Zeeland mussels can be a gritty job. Twice a year,
the Dutch mussel farmers fish for their "seed" mussels,
babies about one centimeter, or 0.4 inch, long. The seed is
then scattered onto seabeds rented from the government. After
two or three years of munching on plankton, the mussels are
big enough to be harvested.</p>
<p>The mussels are dredged, purged of sand and barnacles and
dispatched to canneries or rushed to stores and restaurants
in refrigerated trucks. Until cooked, they must be kept alive
at all costs.</p>
<p>An old theory says that shellfish can only be eaten in
months with the "R." But because of refrigerated trucks,
producers now say it's fine to eat mussels in July or August.</p>
<p>Of the so-called Zeeland mussels, only about a third
actually grow up in Zeeland's eastern Scheldt estuary. The
rest come from the Netherlands' north coast or from Denmark
or West Germany. Imports attain the Zeeland name merely by
being dunked in the eastern Scheldt for a week or two to soak
up the "taste of Zeeland."</p>
<p>Given this murky labeling, some restaurateurs clam up
about the exact origins of the mussels they serve. But
Ann-Marie Veulemans of Francois, a seafood restaurant in
Brussels, insists she can distinguish between true Zeeland
mussels and impostors, judging by color, taste and shape. Any
supplier who tries to slip Danish or German mussels into her
order, she warns, can forget about doing further business
with Francois.</p>
<p>Even with an impending shortage, Zeelanders press on with
marketing efforts. Last month, the mussel association told
Belgian journalists about a new study showing that mussels
are much lower in cholesterol than previously thought. Faced
with heavy competition from U.S.-style fast food, the
Zeelanders figure they need to keep flexing their mussels in
the international market. After all, Mr. Lucas says, "the
Dutch don't like them very much."</p>
