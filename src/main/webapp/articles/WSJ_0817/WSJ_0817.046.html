	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Saddam Hussein's name is in the news. But
the question is: which is correct when you're using only one?
   In the New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune
and the Baltimore Sun, the Iraqi strongman is called Hussein,
as in the New York Times headline, "Hussein's Achilles Heel."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But at the Washington Post, the Associated Press, USA
Today, Time and Newsweek, Saddam gets the nod. "Security
Officials Foresee Saddam Turning to Proxy Terrorists," the
Washington Post said.</p>
<p>So far, nobody is using one of the Iraqi leader's full
names: Saddam Hussein al-Tikriti. Nor are they adding
hosannas that his followers might use, such as "Hero of the
Arabs" or "Sword of Islam."</p>
<p>Yahya Sadowski, a Middle East expert at the Brookings
Institution here, says an Arab man can have up to four names.
He will have his given birth name -- Saddam, in this case. He
will have his family or tribal name -- such as Hussein, which
literally means "little beautiful," Mr. Sadowski says.</p>
<p>The Iraqi leader's third name, "al-Tikriti," means "of
Tikrit," a town in central Iraq. But that name was dropped
after 1977 because too many members of Iraq's ruling Ba'ath
party were also "al-Tikriti."</p>
<p>Still another moniker comes from the name of a first son.
Around the Iraqi Embassy here, says press officer Abdulrahman
Jamil, the Iraqi leader is sometimes called "Abu Uday," which
means "the father of Uday," the name of his eldest son.</p>
<p>Most Arabs refer to the Iraqi president as "Saddam," Mr.
Sadowski says. One reason is that Hussein is an extremely
common name in the Middle East and "Hussein" alone would be
confusing.</p>
<p>The U.S. media are trying to avoid the same kind of
mix-up. One reason the Washington Post went with Saddam for
the Iraqi dictator is that "just reading `Hussein' opens up
the possibility that the casual reader would confuse him with
King Hussein" of Jordan, says Michael Getler, the Washington
Post's managing editor for foreign news.</p>
<p>But Ed Wright, an assistant foreign editor at the Los
Angeles Times says, "It's our understanding that {Saddam} is
not a legitimate second reference. It's more of an informal
second reference . . . like the use of `Fidel' for Fidel
Castro."</p>
<p>Even the same publication sometimes can't agree. To avoid
confusion with Jordan's king on The Wall Street Journal news
pages, reporters, editors and headline writers have been
instructed to use "Iraq's Hussein" or "Saddam Hussein." "But
you should not use Saddam or Hussein by itself." The paper's
editorial page, however, uses "Saddam."</p>
