	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank, reacting to the
needs of a U.S. ally caught in the Persian Gulf crisis, said
it is ready to provide more than $1 billion in loan
guarantees to finance the sale of U.S. military helicopters
to Turkey.
   Ex-Im Bank Chairman John Macomber said the board and a
cabinet-level committee that oversees the bank's loan
policies gave it the go-ahead to offer the guarantees if a
U.S. vendor wins the huge award for 200 helicopters. The
likely U.S. supplier is United Technologies Corp.'s Sikorsky
division, which last month clinched another contract to
supply the Turkish National Police with S-70A Blackhawk
helicopters with the help of $37.7 million in loan guarantees
from the Ex-Im Bank.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest prospective deal signals a turning point in
U.S. arms-export policy. The bank traditionally has shied
away from the defense trade, insisting that its limited
resources be used to finance nonmilitary U.S. business. Its
Turkey decision, however, shows the bank is willing to serve
as financier for U.S. arms sales to middle-income allies that
can't afford to pay cash for U.S. weapons.</p>
<p>Mr. Macomber said the gulf crisis surrounding Turkey was a
factor in the bank's decision. "We had to do something faster
than usual" because of the crisis.</p>
<p>The Bush administration has been quietly crafting a new
policy to help U.S. defense contractors expand their export
sales. Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state,
last month ordered U.S. ambassadors to get on board by
helping open doors for U.S. defense vendors, according to his
aides.</p>
<p>The use of Ex-Im Bank financing, however, had remained a
"sticking point" in forming the new policy, the aides said. A
policy paper recommending its use for defense sales remains
stuck in the Office of Management and Budget because of
concerns by some White House aides about the propriety of
expending the bank's resources in this manner.</p>
<p>Mr. Macomber said the prospective Turkish deal is
specifically authorized by a law passed last year that
authorizes such guarantees for military sales to Turkey and
Greece. Democratic Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut
spearheaded the effort to pass this and other laws that
effectively give such companies as United Technologies, based
in Hartford, Conn., wider access to Ex-Im Bank financing.</p>
<p>The Ex-Im Bank's role of financing arms sales to other
allies could become policy if an amendment to the Export
Administration Act introduced by Sens. Dodd and Christopher
Bond (R. Mo.) becomes law. The Senate is scheduled to
consider changes to the export act when it returns from its
August recess.</p>
<p>U.S. defense industry spokesmen said Sikorsky is facing
tough competition for the Turkish sale from French and
Italian vendors, which have the solid backing of their
governments.</p>
