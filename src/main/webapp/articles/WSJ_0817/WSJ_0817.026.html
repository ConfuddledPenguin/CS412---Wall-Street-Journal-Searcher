	<p class="article-leader">LISBON -- Banco Comercial Portugues, a private commercial
bank, said it established a sponsored American depositary
receipt program and expects the ADRs to begin actively
trading next week.
   Each ADR will represent one underlying share and will
trade in the over-the-counter market quoted in the so-called
Pink Sheets. The program is through Morgan Guaranty Trust Co.
Jardim Goncalves, chairman of the $3.4 billion bank, said the
ADR program would diversify the bank's investor base and
allow Americans access to the Portuguese market.</p>
