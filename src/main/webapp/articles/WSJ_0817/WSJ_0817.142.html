	<p class="article-leader">EINDHOVEN, The Netherlands -- Faced with plunging profits
in the first half of 1990 and an expected loss of 2 billion
guilders ($1.13 billion) for the year, N.V. Philips said it
has extensively cut back on lavish plans for the troubled
Dutch electronics giant's 100th anniversary celebration in
1991.
   Rather, Philips spokesman Jan van Schagen said the company
now plans to "commemorate the centenary in an unostentatious
and modest manner."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Although plans hadn't yet been finalized, at one time they
included a street carnival in Eindhoven as well as two major
company exhibits, Mr. Van Schagen said.</p>
<p>"Those are definitely off," said Mr. Van Schagen. "We feel
the situation in which we now are and the way we celebrate
these festivities ought to be in some proportion."</p>
<p>Originally, Philips had been planning to spend "tens of
millions" of guilders on the anniversary, Mr. Van Schagen
said but added he had no estimate for the costs of the
currently planned celebrations.</p>
<p>On Aug. 9, Philips reported that its net income from
ordinary activities plummeted to 43 million guilders in the
first half of 1990 from 420 million guilders in the
year-earlier period. Including extraordinary items, Philips
had a total net income of 373 million guilders in the first
half of 1990 compared with 458 million guilders in the first
half of 1989.</p>
<p>Philips is maintaining an earlier forecast that it will
have to spend 2.7 billion guilders on restructuring efforts
and lay off close to 10,000 workers, mostly in its Western
European operations. The restructuring charge will result in
a loss of about 2 billion guilders for the year, according to
Philips' forecast.</p>
