	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and the
leader of the vast Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, are
cutting their travels short in an effort to halt internal
battles that threaten plans for economic reform.
   Mr. Yeltsin broke off a working tour of Russia and
returned to Moscow Wednesday. Yesterday, the official Tass
news agency quoted Mr. Yeltsin as saying Mr. Gorbachev will
return to Moscow from his holiday in Crimea in the next few
days.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Yeltsin has long been urging more radical reforms than
those proposed by the central government. Earlier this month,
Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin agreed to create a joint team
to work out a new proposal for shifting to a market economy,
based on a more radical plan created by the Russian
government. The agreement was a direct slap at Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov, who is leading a central government effort
at planning economic reform.</p>
<p>Mr. Ryzhkov's most recent proposal, presented in May,
failed to win the parliament's approval because it was
indecisive and would have started with an unpopular immediate
rise in retail bread prices. The government was given until
September to work out something better.</p>
<p>The new joint-team has been working in parallel to Mr.
Ryzhkov's committee and another so-called alternative
commission, and all three are racing to come up with draft
plans for the Soviet and Russian parliaments to discuss next
month. Now Mr. Gorbachev is under increasing pressure to
choose between his prime minister's more moderate reforms and
an alliance with the radical populist, Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
<p>Mr. Yeltsin indirectly criticized Mr. Ryzhkov for
undermining the new team's efforts. According to Tass, he
complained that the Federal ministries of defense and finance
weren't giving the group certain essential data, defying
presidential instructions to cooperate by doing so. He called
for the government to abandon its parallel reform planning.
"One should not duplicate work," he said. "It is necessary to
concentrate on our program, which is trusted by the people
and is both novel and realistic," he said.</p>
<p>Indicating that his intentions to cooperate only go so
far, Mr. Yeltsin threatened that Russia will take its own
course, no matter what. If the Soviet parliament is presented
with two official proposals, he said, "The Russian parliament
will adopt its own plan and the issue will be closed."</p>
<p>In his own republic, which covers the bulk of Soviet
territory, Mr. Yeltsin has supported plans and declarations
that directly contradict the rule of the central government.
Various republics are seeking direct ties with one another as
a way to achieve economic improvements faster than waiting
for central government reform. Whatever economic reform
program the government adopts this autumn will be crucial in
Mr. Gorbachev's struggle to keep testy republics interested
in remaining part of a unified nation.</p>
<p>Some political analysts say the decision to create a joint
team reflected how weak Mr. Gorbachev is becoming, while
others say the president intends to use Mr. Yeltsin's
pressure to push through reforms he himself thinks are
necessary. In any case, Mr. Gorbachev can only be helped if
he wins the support of Mr. Yeltsin, among the most popular
politicians in Russia.</p>
<p>So far the Soviet government has resisted taking radical
steps that might cause immediate sharp inflation or
unemployment. The plan presented by Mr. Ryzhkov in May was
scheduled to take three to five years, and to start with
price reform. The Russian 500-day plan takes about 18 months
and emphasizes privatization of huge state-run industries.
Local news reports indicate that the various economic reform
commissions are now scrapping the idea of starting with price
reform in favor of starting with privatization.</p>
<p>Mr. Yeltsin said he was hopeful that the new group will be
able to complete its work this month, according to Tass. He
said that yesterday the team agreed on a package of emergency
measures to help limit the chaos of a transition to a market
economy.</p>
