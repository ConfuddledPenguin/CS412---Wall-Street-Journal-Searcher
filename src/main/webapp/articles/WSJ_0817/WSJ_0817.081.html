	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Security Pacific Corp. said overall
weakness in the economy would crimp its earnings for the
remainder of the year.
   The bank holding company wouldn't make specific estimates.
But John Kooken, chief financial officer, said Security
Pacific at best expects net income for the second half to
grow less than the 5% increase recorded in profit for the
first six months. Mr. Kooken also said profit for the second
half could be below year-earlier levels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the first six months, Security Pacific earned $195.2
million, or $1.59 a share. In last year's second half, the
company earned $376.8 million, or $3.14 a share. For all of
1989, profit was $740.6 million, or $6.26 a share.</p>
<p>The announcement rocked Security Pacific's stock and
prompted several analysts to lower their 1990 earnings
forecasts for the company. In New York Stock Exchange
composite trading yesterday, Security Pacific closed at
$28.75, off $3.</p>
<p>Livia Asher, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Research/U.S.,
trimmed her 1990 estimate by 65 cents a share, to $5.70. For
1991, she cut her estimate by 60 cents, to $6.20 a share.</p>
<p>Mr. Kooken and other Security Pacific officials were
dismayed by the stock's plunge. "We certainly feel that the
market has overreacted," Mr. Kooken said. "The reaction is
not borne out by the facts."</p>
<p>He said the market may have interpreted the disclosure as
evidence of a swoon in California real estate. Many investors
have been dreading such a downturn because California is
about the only regional real estate market in the country
that hasn't tanked. Recently, several large California
thrifts and some banks have reported losses because of
trouble in California. But Mr. Kooken said the California
real estate market, as well as the local economy, remain
relatively strong.</p>
<p>He attributed the projected slow second half to weakness
in the general economy and said that first-half profit was
pumped up by unusually high non-interest income. He said loan
charge-offs in each of the third and fourth quarters are
likely to match the $160 million Security Pacific reported in
the second quarter. By comparison, the company reported only
$115 million of loan losses in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Separately, Security Pacific said it agreed to sell $100
million of 8.85% notes, maturing Aug. 15, 1993, and
non-callable over the life of the issue. The notes will be
underwritten by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, Lehman
Brothers and Salomon Brothers Inc. Proceeds will be used for
general corporate purposes.</p>
