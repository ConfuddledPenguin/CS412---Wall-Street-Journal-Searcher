3.2 million units of warrants and common shares for total
proceeds of 27.6 million Canadian dollars (US$24.1 million),
to be used to finance the mining company's exploration and
development projects. The units will consist of one common
share and a warrant to buy one-half common share, and will be
priced at C$8.63 each. For each two warrants, a holder may
buy one Agnico-Eagle common share for C$9.13 for about two
years from the date of issue. The issue will be underwritten
by a group of Toronto-based investment dealers, led by RBC
Dominion Securities Inc.</p>
