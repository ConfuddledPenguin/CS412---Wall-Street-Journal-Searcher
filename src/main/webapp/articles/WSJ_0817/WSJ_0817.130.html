	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Canada's main East-West railroad lines were
blocked by two groups of Indians in northern Ontario, halting
freight and passenger traffic between Toronto and Winnipeg,
Manitoba.
   Taking their cue from Mohawk Indians near Montreal who
have blocked a bridge into the city for the past six weeks,
the Indians are seeking provincial and federal government
action on land claims and other issues, government officials
said. Leaders of the Indian groups couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CP Rail, a unit of Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd.,
said the line was blocked at about noon yesterday at Mobert,
Ontario, by Indians from a reservation there.</p>
<p>CP Rail spokesman Paul Thurston said the railroad is
studying ways to reroute rail traffic.</p>
<p>Another blockade began Monday when Indians at Long Lac,
Ontario, blocked government-owned Canadian National Railways'
main East-West lines.</p>
<p>Indian and Native Affairs Minister Thomas Siddon said the
federal government won't negotiate land claims with the
Indians as long as the blockades remain in place.</p>
<p>Industry officials said the two railroads carry about 20%
to 30% of East-West traffic in Canada, with bulk commodities
accounting for most of the railroads' business.</p>
