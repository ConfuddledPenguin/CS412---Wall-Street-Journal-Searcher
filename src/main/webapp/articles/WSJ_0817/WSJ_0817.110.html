	<p class="article-leader">The inspector general of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
is investigating the agency's licensing of the Seabrook
nuclear power plant, amid lingering questions about adequate
evacuation plans.
   The action, conducted by the commission inspector general
David Williams, is unusual and throws at least some
uncertainty on Seabrook's full-power start-up timetable. But
some analysts remain optimistic that the investigation
probably won't lead to a revocation of Seabrook's license.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The $6.6 billion power plant, in Seabrook, N.H., has
demonstrated an ability to operate at 100% capacity in trial
runs and is ready for regular full-power production.</p>
<p>The Seabrook plant is owned by 11 New England utilities,
including Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, with a 35.6%
stake. PS New Hampshire filed for bankruptcy-law protection
in 1988 because it couldn't service its Seabrook debt.
Another Seabrook holder, Northeast Utilities, has agreed to
acquire PS New Hampshire in a deal valued at about $2.3
billion.</p>
<p>"This comes at a very awkward time for Seabrook, and it
puts the financial community in a cautious mode," said Daniel
Scotto, a bond analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp. "It's a hard one to call. We don't really
have any precedent of NRC investigative activity to go by."</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares of PS
New Hampshire and Northeast Utilities were unchanged at
$2.625 and $19.75, respectively.</p>
<p>In 1981 the commission conducted an investigation of
seismic safety designs for the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power
Plant in Northern California. That resulted in a temporary
suspension of a low-power testing license the facility had
received. The plant eventually received a full operating
license.</p>
<p>"I'd be very surprised if the Seabrook investigation leads
to anything serious," said Paul Parshley, a bond analyst at
Lehman Brothers. "The momentum was clearly on the side of
Seabrook, and I don't think anyone would have wanted to
jeopardize {getting} a license by doing something
inappropriate at the time."</p>
<p>A public report of the investigation is expected to be
issued in about a month.</p>
<p>If the inspector general finds wrongdoing, he can
recommend certain actions to the full commission, which will
decide whether or not to act on his findings.</p>
<p>At issue in the licensing inquiry is whether there was any
wrongdoing by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, an
advisory group to the commission. The board's recommendation
that Seabrook be licensed was made public on Nov. 13, 1989.
But, according to a memorandum from the board's chairman,
Ivan Smith, Mr. Williams hypothesizes that the licensing
board, only four days earlier, decided not to recommend an
operating license.</p>
<p>The memo, released by the commission this week, said Mr.
Williams is trying to determine whether the reversal "was
corruptly induced by NRC officers and corruptly made by
members of the licensing board." Messrs. Smith and Williams
have confirmed the investigation, but wouldn't comment on it.</p>
<p>A Seabrook spokesman said the licensing was recommended
Nov. 9 and that the recommendation wasn't made public until
Nov. 13.</p>
<p>Anti-nuclear activists note that if the licensing board
recommended licensing on Nov. 9, it came only two days after
the Atomic and Safety Appeals Board, another NRC committee,
outlined aspects of evacuation plans that still needed
addressing.</p>
<p>They included identifying and mapping evacuation plans for
critically ill patients and other disabled persons living
within a 10-mile radius; providing shelter for beachgoers who
might be stranded; and reaching an agreement with teachers
for the care of school children. Most of these issues haven't
been resolved.</p>
<p>"None of these issues could have been adequately addressed
{during the two days} between the appeals board order and the
time of the licensing recommendation," said Robert Backus, an
attorney for the Seacoast Anti-Pollution League, a Seabrook
opponent.</p>
