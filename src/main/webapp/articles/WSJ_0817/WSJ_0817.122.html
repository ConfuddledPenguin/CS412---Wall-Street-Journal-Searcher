	<p class="article-leader">Cineplex Odeon Corp. said the deadline for the sale of 38
of its U.S. movie theater properties has been extended.
   As previously reported, Cineplex said this week that it
may not be able to complete the $31.8 million sale of the
theaters to Los Angeles-based Plitt Amusement Co. The closing
date of the transaction, originally set for July 31, had
already been extended to Aug. 15.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Toronto-based Cineplex said earlier it may not be able to
complete the sale, one of many required under agreements with
the bankers for the troubled movie theater chain. Cineplex
declined to give a reason for the uncertainty surrounding a
sale, but individuals in the industry said Plitt's bankers
appear unwilling to finance the transaction at the current
price.</p>
<p>Cineplex said it is continuing negotiations with Plitt,
and didn't give a new deadline for closing the sale.</p>
