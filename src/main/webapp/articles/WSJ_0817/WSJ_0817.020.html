	<p class="article-leader">Leaving the corporate womb to start your own business is
scary. But many who try it discover that one of the best ways
to soften the shock is to turn their old employers into
assets.
   For instance, after 32 years at International Business
Machines Corp., Robert Bettendorf accepted an
early-retirement offer last year. He started his own
business, but he hasn't stopped doing work for IBM. Instead,
he made the computer giant his first client.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In his last IBM job, Mr. Bettendorf ran an office that
concentrated on the safety and comfort of IBM products. IBM
hired his new concern, Institute of Office Technology Inc.,
Stamford, Conn., to study the health effects of office
equipment. "I was creating a gap at the company which I was
able to fill," he explains.</p>
<p>Mr. Bettendorf knew before he started his company that he
would get some work from IBM. "Without those assurances, I
might well have gone out and done something else." IBM still
accounts for more than 50% of his business, but he hopes to
reduce his dependency on the corporation through a
combination of seminars and independent consulting
assignments.</p>
<p>Many executives at big companies such as IBM yearn to
start their own businesses. In addition, recent mergers,
acquisitions and cutbacks at companies have forced numerous
others to start new careers. Increasingly, they choose
self-employment. Joseph Jannotta, chairman of Jannotta, Bray
& Associates, an executive placement firm in Chicago, says
that 16% of the laid-off employees whom his firm helps find
work end up as entrepreneurs, compared with only 4% in 1980.</p>
<p>New entrepreneurs frequently find there are many ways that
their old employers can help them in new ventures. Take
Harlan Jessup, who has left General Electric Co. twice.</p>
<p>In 1979, a midlife crisis led him to open a sporting-goods
retail store in Southbury, Conn. The venture failed, and Mr.
Jessup was back with GE by March 1980. On New Year's Day this
year, Mr. Jessup was on his own again. But this time he
couldn't turn back: His division was being phased out. Like
Mr. Bettendorf, he started his own business and turned his
old company into his first client.</p>
<p>But this was just the beginning. More importantly, he
says, GE allowed him to use the training materials he had
developed while he worked at the company. These form an
essential part of the service that his consulting concern,
TeamWork Management, offers. "Developing new materials would
have been an overwhelming task," he says.</p>
<p>GE also allowed Mr. Jessup to spend the three months
between accepting the early-retirement program and leaving GE
on developing his new business. He printed a brochure and
developed a mailing-list during that time. Mr. Jessup now
operates his business from his home in Newtown, Conn.,
helping to develop "self-directed work teams" -- groups of
employees that plan and measure their own work -- for four
divisions of GE.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Jessup is looking to expand his client base. He
thinks he can achieve this through a series of public
workshops he has planned for the end of the year.</p>
<p>Of course, entrepreneurs who turn employers into clients
realize they can become too dependent on a single company.
The relationship can have other pitfalls, too, warn business
owners such as Jeffrey Hartnell. He left Ross Laboratories, a
unit of Abbott Laboratories Inc., to buy into an advertising
agency that now works predominantly for pharmaceutical
companies. He believes that "once you leave your employer's
door, you have to be careful about how you come back and
knock on it."</p>
<p>Mr. Hartnell says that after he left Ross in 1986, he was
afraid of becoming involved in questions of confidentiality.
For two years, therefore, he steered clear of the areas he
had specialized in while an employee of Ross, working instead
for packaged-goods pharmaceutical concerns.</p>
<p>Now his agency, Martcom Inc., does 20 to 25 projects a
year for Ross. "They can be confident now that I won't be a
security problem for them," he says.</p>
<p>While many departing employees find ways to get help from
their old employers, the companies sometimes take the
initiative, too. For five years before retirement and three
years afterward, IBM employees are eligible for reimbursement
of as much as $5,000 for the cost of education. Some
employees have used the plan to take courses in subjects such
as accounting, which help them in starting up their own
businesses, says Kenneth Johnson, manager of the retirement
and capital accumulation programs at IBM.</p>
<p>Sometimes, companies even provide employees with the
business itself. When Allied-Signal Inc. decided to disband
its corporate new ventures group in July 1986, it couldn't
find a place for one venture that it had been developing for
almost 10 years. So it offered the unit to a group of
employees led by Stephen Fields, who had been developing its
main product for several years, time-sensitive and
temperature-sensitive labels for food products. Allied
offered to pay Mr. Fields and five other employees their
regular salaries while they raised the necessary money.</p>
<p>One year later, in August 1987, Allied-Signal sold the
unit, now called LifeLines Technology Inc., for $2 million to
a consortium consisting of venture capital groups, the six
employees and Allied-Signal.</p>
<p>Mr. Fields says going out on his own would have been
impossible without the support of Allied-Signal, which has
continued to provide funding. Besides, he says, "this isn't
the kind of business you could start from scratch." He claims
that the almost 10 years of research into the innovative
product wouldn't have been possible outside of a corporation.</p>
<p>Mr. Fields says entrepreneurship suits him fine. "I get to
control my destiny to a much greater extent than I would in a
corporation," he says. He thinks that the entrepreneurial
approach also makes the company run more effectively, too.
"We're all trying to make money, so there's a real
singularity of purpose."</p>
<p>On top of all this, Mr. Fields says the new owners have
since received offers of more than $10 million for the
company.</p>
