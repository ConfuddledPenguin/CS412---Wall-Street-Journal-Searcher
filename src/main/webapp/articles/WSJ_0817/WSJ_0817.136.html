	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The bond market was knocked down with a
one-two punch yesterday, staggering first on news of rising
inflation then tumbling after a menacing speech by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
   The Treasury's 30-year bond, which plunged nearly two
points during the day, rebounded slightly to end 1 5/8 points
lower. The decline translates into a loss of $16.25 for a
bond with a $1,000 face amount.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Top-quality corporate bonds followed Treasurys' lead,
tumbling as much as 1 1/4 points. But municipal,
mortgage-backed and junk bonds posted smaller declines, with
prices ending between 1/2 and 5/8 point lower.</p>
<p>As prices deteriorated, the yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond jumped to 8.92%, the highest closing
yield on a benchmark bond since May 3, when the yield was
8.98%.</p>
<p>Although institutional investors are bailing out of bonds,
analysts say that yields are approaching levels that
individual investors should consider attractive.</p>
<p>"You have a fragile stock market and bond yields that are
close to 9%. That's a combination that has always attracted
small investors to the bond market," said F. Ward McCarthy, a
managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates.
But buying on the part of small investors alone isn't enough
to reverse the deeply bearish sentiment in the market.</p>
<p>Yesterday's sell-off began as soon as the market opened
and was triggered by a larger-than-expected rise in the
consumer price index, a measure of inflation. The Department
of Labor reported that the CPI rose 0.4% in July. During the
first seven months of the year, the department said the CPI
was running at an annual rate of 5.8%. With oil prices now
rising, some economists believe that 1990 could produce the
highest inflation rate in nearly a decade.</p>
<p>"The core inflation rate is getting worse. This is very
alarming," said Norman Robertson, chief economist at Mellon
Bank Corp.</p>
<p>The CPI report was a disappointment because it reduces the
chances that the Federal Reserve will soon cut short-term
interest rates. Economists generally believe that reducing
interest rates at a time when prices are rising tends to
exacerbate inflation. To avoid that, economists believe the
Fed may vote to keep credit policy unchanged at its next
Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which is scheduled to
take place next week.</p>
<p>"It will be very hard for the Fed to ease interest rates
at this time," said Mr. Robertson. "In fact, the Fed may not
ease unless or until there is clear evidence that we are in a
recession," he said. In recent weeks, the value of short-term
Treasury securities has appreciated due to expectations that
the Fed would ease. But, short-term securities were the
hardest hit in yesterday's early rout.</p>
<p>After the heavy round of CPI-related selling, the market
quieted for a time.</p>
<p>But comments by Mr. Hussein clobbered the market again. In
an open letter to President Bush, which was broadcast by
Iraqi television and picked up by Cable News Network, the
Iraqi strongman said President Bush was a "liar" who was
trying to humiliate the Arab world by using military force in
Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein also threatened to battle Americans troops,
saying that "you will receive American bodies back in bags."</p>
<p>Those ominous words shook up investors. "The part about
sending Americans home in bags raised the prospect of war and
right away people reached the conclusion that oil prices will
rise," putting even more pressure on inflation, said James
Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government
Securities Inc. Inflation is the bane of the bond market
because it reduces the value of fixed-income investments.</p>
<p>Mr. Capra said that investors also fear that a war in the
Middle East could disrupt the budget deficit-cutting process,
which had been one of the few positive factors in the bond
market.</p>
<p>Although yesterday's morning decline reflected heavy
selling, Mr. Capra said that prices fell in the afternoon
largely because dealers were cutting prices.</p>
<p>"The market is trying to reprice itself," he said. After
Saddam Hussein's speech, "market participants reached a
collective consensus that these prices are too high and
yields are too low for this environment. We are seeking
levels where we can attract interest."</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 98 2/32,
down from 99 25/32 on Wednesday. The issue's yield, which
moves in the opposite direction of its price, jumped to 8.92%
from 8.76%. The latest 10year notes ended at 99 22/32 to
yield 8.78% compared with 100 21/32 to yield 8.63% on
Wednesday. Two-year notes ended at 99 26/32 to yield 8.08%
compared with 100 3/ 32 to yield 7.93%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were sharply higher yesterday. The
discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at 7.50%
for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.73% while the rate on
six-month bills ended at a rate of 7.47% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.85%.</p>
<p>Corporate, Junk Bonds</p>
<p>Investment-grade corporate bonds ended as much as 1 1/4
point lower yesterday while junk bonds, high-yield
speculative-grade securities, ended with losses of about 1/2
point.</p>
<p>The biggest loser in the junk-bond market yesterday was
AmBase Corp., which tumbled on concerns that the company's
sale of its troubled Home Insurance Co. unit could be
blocked.</p>
<p>Although AmBase's 14.875% senior subordinated notes
rebounded slightly by the close, the debt securities still
finished 13 3/4 points lower at 81 3/4 on moderate volume of
$3.1 million of bonds.</p>
<p>Fears that the Home Insurance sale might be derailed were
fueled by Shearson Lehman equity analyst Udayan Ghose, who
told traders in a morning call that the deal could be stymied
by regulators or disgruntled shareholders.</p>
<p>"It seems to me that shareholders are unlikely to favor
the deal given what has happened to the stock," Mr. Ghose
told Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.</p>
<p>AmBase, which had promised a special dividend to its
shareholders, said it is unlikely to make any payout based on
the expected proceeds from the sale.</p>
<p>Thursday's sharp declines in AmBase bonds come after the
securities rose by a total of two points Tuesday and
Wednesday on news that the company signed a letter of intent
to sell its troubled Home Insurance Co. unit to Vik Brothers
International, a European-based investor group, for $544
million.</p>
<p>The junk-bond market welcomed the asset sale because the
company said it would use proceeds from the transaction to
help pay off debt. Jack Plaxe, chief financial officer of
AmBase, said the company would not have "done this deal had
we not thought we could pay our debt." Mr. Plaxe also said he
believes the sale will meet with required regulatory
approval.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Municipal bonds followed the Treasury market with
municipal issues ending as much as 5/8 point lower.</p>
<p>In competitive action, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
group priced $100 million Metropolitan Seattle, Washington,
municipality sewer revenue bonds to yield from 6.00% in 1993
to 7.45% in 2030.</p>
<p>Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% of 2018 were 3/8 point lower at 98 3/8 to
yield 7.32%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Prices of mortgage-backed securities ended lower.
Higher-coupon mortgage securities posted smaller declines
than the low-coupon issues, reflecting yesterday's news that
housing starts in July fell 2.6% and that building permits,
an indicator of future housing activity, fell 2.6%.</p>
<p>"That's why the high coupons are doing better," said a New
York mortgage-backed securities trader. "To the extent that
there's less housing, there are fewer people moving, and
lower prepayments," which favor the high-coupon issues.</p>
<p>Among actively traded secondary issues, Government
National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues for August delivery
were down 17/32 on the day at 98 25/32. Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were down 20/32 at 98 10/32,
and Federal National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues were
down 20/32 at 98 27/32.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Fears that oil prices may start to rise again undermined
global bond markets again yesterday. Although the U.S. market
took the biggest hits yesterday, prices also were lower in
Japan, Britain, West Germany, France and several other
countries.</p>
<p>In Britain, domestic economic data along with the
prospects of higher oil hurt bond prices. The government
reported that Britain's underlying annual rate of growth in
average earnings rose to 10% in June from 9.75% in May. The
trend suggests that wage inflation may continue to rise
despite a firm pound and tight monetary policy, analysts say.
In response, Britain's benchmark 11.75% bond due 2003/2007
rose 3/8 point to 98 30/32 to yield 11.89%.</p>
<p>West German bonds ended about 1/4 point lower while in
Japan the yield on the benchmark No. 119 10-year bond rose to
7.92%. The price for the No. 119 fell 0.50 point to 83.52.</p>
<p>(Foreign bond yields are quoted here in local terms and
therefore differ from yields calculated for these markets by
U.S. investment firms, which use a semiannual compound
measure to compare yields across markets. When calculated
using that semiannual measure, the yield on the No. 119 bond
closed at 7.36%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)</p>
