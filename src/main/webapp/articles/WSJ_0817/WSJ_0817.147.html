	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southland Corp. extended its debt-swap offer and
its deal with Ito-Yokado Co., its Japanese suitor, as
expected, after falling far short of getting the approval
from bondholders needed to complete either deal.
   According to the company's latest bond-exchange offer,
dated July 16, the company needs to have 95% of each class of
bonds tendered in order to consummate the deal. Only 28.2% of
the company's 16.5% notes were tendered in the deal. The
highest approval, 74.7%, came in the 13.5% senior notes,
which are about 34%-held by investor Carl Icahn.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Icahn, of Mount Kisco, N.Y., said he tendered all of
his Southland bonds in the company's exchange offer. Mr.
Icahn owns an estimated $180 million of the senior reset
notes, as well as smaller positions in other Southland bonds.</p>
<p>"We like the Southland offer," he said. "The Japanese are
putting equity in. That's what it takes to make these kinds
of deals work."</p>
<p>The deal required only two-thirds of the perferred stock
to be tendered in the deal, and 83.5% were tendered,
Southland said. The company also said its bank creditors
approved a credit-agreement amendment essential to the deal.
The debt-swap offer was extended to midnight Aug. 23 and the
stock purchase agreement with Ito-Yokado was extended to
Sept. 15.</p>
<p>The acceptance by bondholders, while short of the required
95%, was "extraordinary" for such deals, said James Heffernan
of Whitman, Heffernan & Rhein Workout Fund, which tendered
its 13.5% bonds. Usually, bondholders know that such offers
will be extended and they don't tender by the first deadline
date, he said. "These are among the best figures I've seen
for a voluntary exchange," he said.</p>
<p>Analysts observed, though, that Southland's exchange offer
was most popular with holders of its 13 1/2% senior notes,
who would get more Southland equity than other bondholders
under the restructuring plan. Holders of subordinated bonds,
who wouldn't get as much equity, appeared to be holding out
for better terms.</p>
<p>Some investors with lower-ranking bonds voiced concern
that Southland may try a pre-packaged plan to quickly enter
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to force the hand of
bondholders who are holding out.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it might turn out not to be a quicky
bankruptcy. This could turn into just a regular bankruptcy,"
which would take many more months to settle, said William
Eddleman Jr., director of fixed income research for
Dallas-based Barre & Co., a major holder of three classes of
the bonds along with its clients.</p>
<p>Mr. Eddleman, who declined to say whether his firm had
tendered its 15 3/4%, 16 1/2% and 16 3/4% bonds, said
questions over the seniority that was granted to some of the
classes over others could become a major legal issue in a
bankruptcy. That could extend the bankruptcy proceedings
beyond the four months expected for a pre-packaged
bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The exchange offer, the first approved by the bondholder
committee, would give bondholders about 25% of the common
stock of the company. The founding Thompson family of Dallas
would get about 5% of the stock and Ito-Yokado, operator of
7-Eleven stores in Japan, would get about 70% for $430
million.</p>
<p>Southland, the troubled parent of the 7-Eleven convenience
store chain, went into default on its $1.8 billion publicly
traded debt in mid-July, but avoided being forced into
bankruptcy at that time by getting a tentative nod from the
bondholder committee for the most recent exchange offer. The
company owns about 6,700 7-Eleven and other convenience
stores in the U.S. and Canada. Increased competition eroded
sales and profit margins and made it difficult for the
company to service the huge debt from the buy-out.</p>
