	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- If you've pumped oil stocks into your
portfolio but are still looking for ways to speculate on
higher oil prices, Wall Street has a few "Texas recovery"
stocks you could use to top off the tank.
   The idea is that rising oil prices will lift the Texas
economy. But these aren't plays for the faint of heart. They
involve industries such as banking, media and retailing, all
of which have been out of favor with stock market investors
and are vulnerable to a slowdown in the general economy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The companies the Street is recommending have substantial
operations outside the Southwest that might not benefit from
higher oil prices. Moreover, a rapid recovery of the Texas
economy depends heavily on a sustained rise in oil prices,
which is far from a sure thing.</p>
<p>Still, the logic of an accelerated oil-patch recovery
seems compelling to some on Wall Street. Edward Kerschner,
chairman of PaineWebber's investment policy committee, came
up with a short list of potential Texas beneficiaries right
after Iraq invaded Kuwait.</p>
<p>The list includes two banks with big operations in Texas,
Chemical Banking and NCNB; A.H. Belo, which owns the Dallas
Morning News and television stations in Dallas, Houston, and
Tulsa, Okla.; and the retailer Neiman Marcus Group, which
gets about 25% of its revenue from Texas.</p>
<p>Other Wall Street analysts who specialize in the banking
and retailing industries are intrigued by the Texas recovery
play but offer a slightly different menu of choices.</p>
<p>In banking, they point to Banc One and First Interstate
Bancorp, which also have significant Texas banking
subsidiaries. In retailing, another choice is Dillard
Department Stores, which isn't as glitzy as Neiman Marcus but
draws more of its revenue from the Southwest.</p>
<p>Belo is well regarded by media analysts and viewed as one
of the few newspaper companies at which advertising revenue
is on the way up instead of down.</p>
<p>Perhaps the toughest calls to make are those involving
Texas banking. Because of the devastation in the Lone Star
state's banking industry in the past few years, the region's
biggest banking franchises now are in the hands of
out-of-state banks. In assessing how these banks from New
York, California, North Carolina and Ohio may benefit from a
Texas recovery, analysts warn, it is important to remember
how each bank acquired its Texas unit.</p>
<p>Chemical and First Interstate acquired their Texas banks
on a "going concern" basis, without the benefit of financial
aid from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., notes Allerton
G. Smith, a First Boston bank analyst. These Texas banks, Mr.
Smith says, "have had considerable asset-quality problems."
The task of working out those problems "is not yet complete."</p>
<p>This situation presents both risk and opportunity. The
opportunity is that a sustained rise in oil prices may turn
some bad loans or properties into good ones. The risk:
Chemical and First Interstate will continue to own these
banks and their troubled assets whether the Texas economy
revives or not.</p>
<p>"The banks that will benefit the most if there is an
uptick in the Texas economy are the ones with the highest
levels of nonperforming loans," Mr. Smith says. He calls this
the "recovering asset play."</p>
<p>The play is different at NCNB and Banc One, which acquired
their Texas banks courtesy of the FDIC. Because of agreements
that allow NCNB and Banc One to "put" souring loans back to
the FDIC -- return them like unwanted wedding presents --
these two banking companies are largely insulated against
problems that develop in loans made by the previous
management, and hence wouldn't benefit much from rising asset
values alone.</p>
<p>"NCNB and Banc One bought effectively sanitized banks with
the option to `put' future problems to regulators, when and
if they're discovered," Mr. Smith says. But he believes NCNB
and Banc One, which are trying to bring aggressive,
consumer-oriented retail banking to Texas, could benefit from
a surge in consumer spending if Texans believe their
long-wounded economy is on the mend.</p>
<p>Officials of Banc One agree. A rise in oil prices, says a
spokesman, "lifts the spirits of the economy in Texas and
Louisiana and the other oil states. People have a better
outlook and a better feeling, and will likely spend a little
more money and get the economy going a little faster."</p>
<p>In percentage terms, NCNB has the biggest stake in Texas,
with 51% of its total assets of $66.2 billion there. About
32% of the $40 billion of assets that Banc One manages are in
a Texas bank, which Banc One owns jointly with the FDIC. Banc
One will buy full ownership of the Texas bank within two
years.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Smith sees Chemical and First Interstate as
potential short-term plays, he prefers NCNB or Banc One
because of their consumer banking strategies. "Long term," he
says, "the retail distribution concept at NCNB or Banc One is
the investment concept I would prefer to use here."</p>
<p>One bank that analysts aren't recommending as a play on
the Texas economy is First City Bancorp. Though it is one of
the few remaining big Texas banks with publicly traded
shares, First City is viewed as vulnerable to problems far
from its Houston base. Among the First City borrowers that
have entered bankruptcy-law proceedings this year are Drexel
Burnham Lambert of New York, Federated Department Stores of
Cincinnati, Garfinckel's of Washington, D.C., and Circle K of
Phoenix, Ariz.</p>
<p>In posting second-quarter earnings, First City disclosed
that because of a previous commitment, it now has "a
substantial direct lending relationship with a European
group" and is helping the borrower sell certain assets
backing the loan. The assets, First City said, "include
properties located in a renowned Mediterranean resort and in
a major European capital."</p>
<p>Eric I. Hemel, a First Boston banking and thrift analyst,
rates First City a "hold." He says, "The primary concern
among investors in First City is its out-of-state loans, not
its in-state loans." The recent European loan is a problem
because of the "mystery factor," Mr. Hemel says. "Nobody
knows what it is or why it's there."</p>
<p>Neiman Marcus, perhaps more than any other retailer, is
associated with Texas-style conspicuous consumption,
symbolized by at least one truly big-ticket item in each of
its catalogs. The latest is a one-month round-the-world trip
by supersonic Concorde for $40,800 a person ($42,800 if you
want a room of your own).</p>
<p>But Neiman Marcus now has stores in 20 cities, only three
of which are in Texas. And the stock that travels under the
Neiman Marcus name includes ownership of two other retailers
at opposite ends of the fashion -- and price -- spectrum:
tony Bergdorf Goodman, with a single store on Fifth Avenue in
New York City, and youth-oriented Contempo Casuals, with 228
stores in regional shopping malls.</p>
<p>Peter Farwell, a Neiman Marcus vice president, says sales
at the Neiman Marcus store in the Houston Galleria have been
growing faster than at any other store in the chain. "We've
seen an impressive recovery already," Mr. Farwell says,
adding that a rise in oil prices "certainly couldn't hurt
it."</p>
<p>What could hurt Neiman Marcus, however, is its Horchow
mail-order catalog business. For the fiscal year that ended
in early August, Horchow is expected to post an operating
loss "substantially larger" than the $8.3 million operating
loss a year earlier, Mr. Farwell says. Horchow is trying to
cut costs and improve productivity.</p>
<p>Jeffrey B. Edelman, a retailing analyst at Barclays de
Zoete Wedd, describes Horchow as a "bottomless pit" for
Neiman Marcus and notes that the company will continue to
expand its store base, diluting Texas's contribution to the
bottom line.</p>
<p>As a Texas recovery play, Mr. Edelman prefers Dillard
Department Stores, which he estimates gets about 50% of its
revenue from Southwestern states. Dillard "is probably as
good a beneficiary as any in retailing" from an increase in
oil prices, Mr. Edelman says. This week, Dillard completed a
stock offering.</p>
<p>Because of a sense that the Texas economy was coming back
to life even before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the veteran
media analyst John Morton of Lynch, Jones & Ryan views A.H.
Belo as one of the few currently attractive stocks in the
newspaper industry.</p>
<p>In the case of Texas, Mr. Morton quips: "They've been in a
depression for years. A recession looks like up to them."
Though Belo also owns television stations in Sacramento,
Calif., and Norfolk, Va., most of its properties are squarely
in the oil patch.</p>
<p>Mr. Morton believes Belo could be a double play of sorts,
because management has revived the flagship Dallas Morning
News and someday could drive the rival Dallas Times-Herald
out of business. If the situation "plays out the way it has
played out in other markets," such as Washington, Cleveland
and Philadelphia, Mr. Morton says, "that will be a big
bonus."</p>
