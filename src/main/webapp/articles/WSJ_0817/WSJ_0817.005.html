	<p class="article-leader">COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
granted Ohio Edison Co. a rate increase of 8.5%, or about
$142.3 million, less than the utility's request for a boost
of about $216 million.
   The commission said the typical Ohio Edison customer using
500 kilowatts an hour of electricity now pays about $57.23 a
month. Under the increase, this will rise to $62.38 a month,
the commission estimated.</p>
