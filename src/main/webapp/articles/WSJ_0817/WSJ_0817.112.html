	<p class="article-leader">Toshiba Corp. of Japan will double production of laptop
personal computers at its West German unit by October, half a
year earlier than initially planned, to meet surging demand
in Europe, a company official said.
   Toshiba Europa G.m.b.H., the West German unit, began
producing 5,000 laptops a month at a new 25 million-mark
($15.9 million) factory in Regensburg, Bavaria, last April,
with plans for monthly production of 10,000 units within a
year, a target that was moved up six months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company is exporting from Japan that part of European
demand that can't be supplied locally.</p>
<p>Toshiba holds a 38% share of the European laptop market.
It is producing three laptop computer models of its T-series,
compatible with International Business Corp. machines, with
plans to begin producing an additional model. It also is
considering producing book-type personal computers at the
West German facility.</p>
