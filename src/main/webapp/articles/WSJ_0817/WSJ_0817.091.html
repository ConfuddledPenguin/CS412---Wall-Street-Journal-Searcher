	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices buckled under the pressure
created by signals of increasing tensions in the Middle East
and evidence that U.S. inflation may have been on the rise
even before the recent surge in oil prices.
   Growth stocks and recession-resistant consumer issues
paced the market's downturn, while oil and precious-metals
stocks bucked the decline -- a pattern which has prevailed
since Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait two weeks ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had risen less
than one point in the two previous sessions, posted its
lowest close since the Mideast crisis began by plummeting
66.83 to 2681.44.</p>
<p>Among broader measures, Standard & Poor's 500-Stock Index
tumbled 7.67 to 332.39, the New York Stock Exchange Composite
Index skidded 3.81 to 182.73 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index fell 7.14 to 308.16.</p>
<p>Declining issues outpaced advancers by 1,300 to 330 on the
Big Board. Trading activity remained fairly light, with
138,850,000 shares changing hands, compared with 135,210,000
Wednesday.</p>
<p>The market initially headed lower amid disappointment with
the consumer price report for July, which showed that the
so-called core inflation rate -- prices excluding the food
and energy sectors -- rose 0.6% last month. The overall
consumer price index, helped by a 0.7% decline in energy
prices, rose 0.4%.</p>
<p>"The numbers should have been better than they were, and
investors received a message that inflation is running at too
high of a level," said A.C. Moore, director of research at
Argus Research Corp.</p>
<p>Prices continued to fall as the session progressed amid
two major developments which dashed hopes for any quick
resolution of the Middle East conflict:</p>
<p>-- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in a televised address
delivered by a spokesman, referred to a Jihad, or holy war,
against the U.S. and threatened that Americans would die in
the Middle East.</p>
<p>-- King Hussein of Jordan, who met with President Bush to
discuss the crisis, denied afterward that he had carried a
message from Iraq. Several reports said the king had been
given a peace proposal by Saddam Hussein to be taken to
President Bush.</p>
<p>The market plummeted to session lows in the final hour of
trading, setting off one of the exchange's "circuit breakers"
designed to put the brakes on market declines.</p>
<p>At 3:41 p.m. EDT, with the Dow Jones industrials down 50
points, the Big Board's "uptick" rule for program trades tied
to stock-index arbitrage went into effect -- prohibiting
arbitrage-related stock sales until after the issues moved
higher.</p>
<p>But the "circuit breaker" didn't stop the market from
ending the day at session lows, and selling in index futures
following the close of stock trading laid the groundwork for
possible arbitrage selling at today's opening.</p>
<p>September contracts on the S&P 500 ended the session at a
discount of about 1/2 point to the cash index -- well below
the level at which traders could lock in profits by
purchasing the futures and selling baskets of stocks.</p>
<p>And with the Middle East situation still in flux, "Traders
with positions aren't going to want to hold anything over the
weekend while they're waiting for any kind of news," said W.
Daniel Williams III, a vice president of trading at Dillon,
Read & Co.</p>
<p>Blue-chip consumer stocks hit hard in the latest session
included Philip Morris, which went down 2 to 45 1/4 in
composite trading of 1.5 million shares; McDonald's, down 1
1/8 to 29; Procter & Gamble, down 2 7/8 to 80 5/8; Coca-Cola,
down 1 1/2 to 43 1/8; Merck, down 4 1/8 to 83 3/4, and Eli
Lilly, down 4 1/8 to 71 1/2.</p>
<p>Within the growth-stock category, Boeing fell 1 3/4 to 50
5/8 on 1.5 million shares, General Electric lost 1 3/8 to 64
7/8, Limited Inc. dropped 1 3/8 to 17 3/4 and Waste
Management fell 1 3/4 to 37 7/8.</p>
<p>Oil stocks, bolstered by the surge in oil prices, closed
little changed. Exxon lost 1/4 to 51 3/4, Texaco fell 1/8 to
62 1/4, Chevron slid 1/8 to 77 1/2, Mobil rose 1/4 to 66 3/4,
Amoco slid 1/4 to 56 1/2, Unocal added 1/8 to 32 3/4 and
Royal Dutch Petroleum gained 1/2 to 83 3/8.</p>
<p>Gold stocks showed strength across the board. Homestake
Mining rose 1 1/2 to 23 1/8, Placer Dome rose 1 to 19 1/2,
Battle Mountain Gold gained 3/8 to 12 3/4, Hecla Mining went
up 3/8 to 13 and ASA Ltd. advanced 2 5/8 to 56 1/4.</p>
<p>Ohio Edison, the most active Big Board issue, plunged 2
1/2 to 17 3/8 on 2.2 million shares. Ohio regulators decided
to grant the company a one-time rate increase of $142.3
million, rather than the three-step, $216 million rate boost
it had requested -- a decline that led analysts to believe
its common-stock dividend may be cut.</p>
<p>The utility said the decision would have "a materially
adverse effect" on its results and its board could be
expected to consider the payout at a meeting scheduled for
Tuesday. Edward J. Tirello, an analyst at Smith Barney,
Harris Upham, suggested the board could reduce the annual
payout to $1.50 a share from $1.96, according to Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard, which reported that net income for its
third quarter ended July 31 was down 5% from a year ago,
dropped 1 7/8 to 35 7/8 on 1.3 million shares. Analysts
generally had expected that the company would post higher
earnings for the quarter.</p>
<p>Navistar International, second on the most actives list,
dipped 3/8 to 2 7/8 as 2.2 million shares changed hands. The
company posted net income of $6 million for the third quarter
ended July 31, compared with $28 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Security Pacific skidded 3 to 28 3/4. Analysts at several
brokerage houses lowered earnings estimates on the company
following a disclosure that it expects second-half results to
fall short of the year-earlier level, citing weakness in the
U.S. economy and the likelihood of slow growth in
non-interest income, according to the Dow Jones investor
report.</p>
<p>Issues of other West Coast-based bank holding companies
also fell sharply. Wells Fargo tumbled 3 1/8 to 59 5/8, while
First Interstate Bancorp fell 1 3/8 to 31 1/4.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 3.81
to 336.83. Volume totaled 14,160,000 issues.</p>
