	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- The Republican Party has lately been sending
a campaign armada through this riverfront city. Jack Kemp and
Dan Quayle have steamed through; Oliver North and, possibly,
George Bush, are on the way.
   Their goal -- to elect a Republican to Congress -- isn't
unusual, but their vessel is: The candidate, Ken Blackwell,
is a black conservative.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For decades, Republicans have had little success extending
their influence into the black community. Indeed, no black
Republican has been elected to the House as a voting member
since GOP Rep. Oscar De Priest of Chicago, who was unseated
in 1934 by Republican-turned-New-Deal-Democrat Arthur
Mitchell (himself the first black Democrat elected to
Congress).</p>
<p>This year, the party is attempting to turn that historical
tide with three black candidates for the House: Gary Franks,
a Waterbury, Conn., alderman pitted against former Rep. Toby
Moffett; Al Brown, a Louisville, Ky., businessman challenging
Rep. Romano Mazzoli; and Mr. Blackwell, a former Cincinnati
mayor and, until last March, a deputy undersecretary at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development under Mr. Kemp.
Of the three, it is Mr. Blackwell -- who blends opposition to
taxes, gay rights and abortion with support for affirmative
action -- who excites conservative activists the most.</p>
<p>To win, he must beat a formidable opponent: Charles Luken,
the current mayor of Cincinnati and son of the popular,
conservative Democratic incumbent. When Rep. Tom Luken
announced in January that he wouldn't seek another term,
Charles Luken was judged a shoo-in to succeed him. Convinced
by Ohio Republicans that Mr. Blackwell was the man to beat
Charles Luken, Washington party officials recruited the HUD
official for the job. He declared his candidacy, returned to
Cincinnati in March, and now finds himself in a very close
race.</p>
<p>Mr. Blackwell has traveled a unique route to his current
candidacy. A student activist and president of the
African-American Student Association at Cincinnati's Xavier
University in the 1960s, Mr. Blackwell agitated for more
courses in black studies and more minority hires. After a
brief professional football stint with the Dallas Cowboys,
Mr. Blackwell became an administrator and psychology teacher
at Xavier, then ran for city council on the reformist
Charterite ticket in 1977.</p>
<p>As late as 1980, Mr. Blackwell was a strong supporter of
Jimmy Carter; at one news conference, he joined several urban
politicians in denouncing Ronald Reagan as a "disaster" for
urban America. One year later, however, Mr. Blackwell left
the city's Charter Party to become a Republican and committed
Reagan supporter. A leading catalyst in persuading him to
make the switch was Jack Kemp, whom he met at a National
Football League function in 1979. "Kemp was constantly
sending me speeches and working papers," Mr. Blackwell
recalls as he sits in a quiet corner of Cincinnati's
walnut-paneled Queen City Club, where he is waiting to meet
two business-community supporters. When Mr. Kemp became HUD
secretary, he brought his protege to Washington.</p>
<p>Today, Mr. Blackwell styles himself as a social and
economic conservative. He's a supply-side true believer,
advocating a cut in capital-gains taxes to 15% from as much
as 33%. Limiting taxation is the "best way to check the size
of government," Mr. Blackwell says. At HUD, he was a strong
advocate for tenant purchase and ownership of public housing
as a means of "empowerment" for the poor.</p>
<p>Mr. Blackwell takes a hard-right line on most social
issues as well. He opposes legalized abortion, and led a
successful city council crusade to require local hospitals to
provide for "humane" disposal of fetuses such as burial or
incineration. (The measure was subsequently struck down in
federal court.) He opposes the civil-rights bill currently
being constructed by Congress, arguing it amounts to "quota
legislation." But he still maintains he's for affirmative
action when it's "legitimate and fair."</p>
<p>Democratic candidate Charles Luken is campaigning as a
conservative too, opposing abortion and favoring a cut in
capital-gains taxes to 22%. In an ironic twist, Mr. Luken
positions himself as the anti-Washington figure in this
contest, despite the fact that his father served eight terms
in Congress and has long been a major recipient of
special-interest campaign contributions.</p>
<p>Both candidates will spend a lot of money as fat-cat
contributors and special interests line up to donate in a
close race with no incumbent. Mr. Blackwell says he already
has raised almost half of his $750,000 target and last month
began running a television ad touting his rise from
"working-class origins" to membership in the Bush
administration.</p>
<p>Although the elder Mr. Luken has held this seat since
1976, the district, which includes suburbs as well as the
western part of Cincinnati, is more a Republican one; George
Bush won with 63% of the vote in 1988. In a reversal of the
usual calculus, it's the black candidate who expects his
strongest showing in the suburbs, home to German-Catholic
Republicans who long ago abandoned Cincinnati's
"Over-the-Rhine" neighborhood. "Good luck to you," chirps one
elderly white man as Mr. Blackwell passes out refrigerator
magnets in front of the Green Township Thriftway.</p>
<p>But Mr. Blackwell also hopes to split the black vote --
somewhere around 15% -- despite his Republican label. Ed
Brookover, regional field representative for the National
Republican Congressional Committee, contends that Mr.
Blackwell has the ability to "connect with the black
community while representing the strong conservative values
that our party stands for."</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, however, the GOP candidate's
conservatism rankles some of the city's black leaders. "He
votes against the interests of his own community," complains
Marian Spencer, a Charterite and former city council member
who attributes Mr. Blackwell's party switch to opportunism.
And he's taking flack for his association with Oliver North,
who reportedly will be paid $8,000 to come in to stump for
the Republican contender. Charterite City Councilman Reggie
Williams -- a former starting linebacker for the Cincinnati
Bengals and someone who has been wooed by national
Republicans, too -- draws a pointed parallel: "I remember
when Sammy Davis was embracing Richard Nixon. That turned a
few stomachs."</p>
<p>But Councilman Williams still is leaning toward supporting
Mr. Blackwell, and the conservative black congressional
candidate doesn't seem in a mood to trim his sails. For
instance, he rejects the "bleeding-heart conservative" label
attached to his mentor, Jack Kemp, explaining that on certain
issues such as organized labor, "Kemp is to the left of me."</p>
