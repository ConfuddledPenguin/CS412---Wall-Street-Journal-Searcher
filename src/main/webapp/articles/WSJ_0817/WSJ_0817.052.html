	<p class="article-leader">In response to several questions posed by Wall Street
Journal editors about the future of Quebec, the province's
premier, Robert Bourassa, wrote the following:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For a good number of years now, Quebec nationalism has not
implied the desire to live in seclusion: Quebec's
determination to ensure cultural security is absolutely
compatible with its determination to create new political and
economic relationships with its partners and to open up to
foreign cultures.</p>
<p>The rising integration of national economies is encouraged
by the liberalization and the multiplication of world trade.
Market globalization incites smaller economies to specialize
their production and expertise in order to carve a place for
themselves in the international economic order. Therefore,
smaller economies such as Quebec's may expect to keep their
competitiveness facing the giants. The new international
economic order does not eliminate the legitimacy of the
aspirations of nations to master their own development but
obliges them to rethink their economic strategies and to show
initiative.</p>
<p>It is Quebec's and the rest of Canada's challenge to
identify a political and constitutional system that will
provide Quebec with the position and powers necessary to its
development and to the strengthening of Canadian and North
American economic partnerships.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The differences of opinion between Quebec and the
government of Canada go way beyond economic problems alone,
but these differences are nevertheless considerable. Probably
the most important economic problem that Quebec has to face
is the macroeconomic policies of the Canadian government.</p>
<p>Firstly, given the policy of high interest rates enforced
in Canada, the cost of capital is higher than in other
industrialized countries. This situation puts obstacles in
front of investment ventures that otherwise would be
profitable and slows down Quebec's economic growth, while
unemployment levels remain above 9%. Furthermore, high
interest rates cause an artificial rise of the Canadian
dollar in terms of other foreign currencies. At the actual
rate, which the Bank of Canada tries to preserve, the
overvalued dollar substantially reduces the power of Quebec's
enterprises to compete, and export levels are reduced.</p>
<p>Secondly, even though Quebec shares the Canadian
government's goal of deficit reduction, it does not accept
the federal government's demands to the provinces to reduce
their expenses and to raise taxes in its place. For example,
the reduction in transfer payments to provincial governments
constitutes the main budget cut measure announced in the last
federal government budget. This behavior makes budget
planning far more complex for the government of Quebec, the
objective of which is a systematic budget reduction while
maintaining a competitive fiscal burden. It also tends to hit
more sharply the poorer provinces, which goes against one of
the great principles of the Canadian constitution.</p>
<p>Finally, the present system brings a costly duplication of
public services in too many areas. The result is a fiscal
burden higher than necessary, and an inefficiency that can be
significant in services offered to the population. In a
context of increased economic competition on the world
market, governments and enterprises must rationalize their
interventions, and produce at minimum cost the best public
services possible.</p>
<p>The government of Quebec is convinced that the welfare of
its people will depend on a sound macroeconomic policy, on a
budget policy of the federal government that does not put the
province at a disadvantage, and on a maximum efficiency in
the supply of public services if it wants businesses to face
with success the challenges of international competition and
technological change.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>During the '60s -- and even into the '70s -- active state
intervention to sustain economic development in Quebec was
desirable for several reasons: the insufficient presence of
the core sectors; the absence of Francophones at the
decision-making level of private enterprises; entire sectors
of the economy that needed to be modernized, etc. During this
period, the government's role probably was more pronounced in
Quebec than in most Canadian provinces, even though several
provinces had recourse to governmental intervention in one
form or another.</p>
<p>Today, the situation has changed. Since 1985 the
government's role has mostly been to create an environment
that favors the birth of entrepreneurship, and the
establishment of new businesses and investment. Moreover, the
tax burden of enterprises and individuals has been reduced.
Furthermore, the government has privileged an approach for
fiscal incentives to stimulate investment into the
fundamental determinants of our growth: research and
development, introduction of new technologies and skill
development.</p>
<p>Even described in broad outline, these developments help
us to easily understand why it is in Quebec -- and not
elsewhere in Canada -- that we found the greatest support for
the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Today's Quebec is ready
to carry through the necessary investments to meet the
challenges provoked by international competition and
technological change. Quebec thus will enter this period of
re-examination of its relationship with the rest of Canada
truly believing in its capabilities and its future.</p>
<p>In short, the government thinks that by uniting as many
favorable conditions as possible for business, the Quebec
society will be able to prosper and preserve its cultural
coherence. The Quebec government therefore must maintain a
fiscal burden compatible with economic growth and speculate
on mechanisms that will favor the development of a private
sector very competitive on a world scale rather than impose
itself through direct commercial and industrial action. st</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>If the Quebec government's intention was to substantially
modify the rules of the present economic system, I would
understand investors' concerns. However, on the contrary, the
new arrangement sought after by Quebec within the Canadian
federation will take into account the necessity to maintain
-- ideally, to improve -- commercial relations between Quebec
and the other Canadian provinces, such as Ontario. Quebec's
future, whatever political arrangement will be accepted, must
lean on a strong and prosperous economy. That guarantees the
future improvement of the population's standard of living and
the preservation of the distinct character of the Quebec
society.</p>
<p>Viewed from this angle, a rearrangement of the Canadian
federation ultimately could enable Quebec to provide itself
with additional tools to be better prepared to face the
economic situation foreseen for the '90s. Thus, an
economically and financially stronger Quebec would be the
result.</p>
