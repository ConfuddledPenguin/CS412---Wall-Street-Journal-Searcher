	<p class="article-leader">President Bush and Jordan's King Hussein appeared to make
little progress toward resolving the U.S. showdown with Iraq,
and even as they talked, fears grew about the fate of
Americans under Iraqi control.
   The Jordanian monarch, a neighbor and friend of Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein, visited President Bush for two hours
at the president's Maine vacation home in hope of defusing
the military tension that has been building since Iraq
invaded Kuwait. The king indicated that Amman generally
intends to abide by international sanctions against Iraq by
choking the flow of Iraqi goods through the Jordanian port of
Aqaba. But neither he nor President Bush expressed any
optimism about a negotiated end to the crisis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I did not come away from that conversation with any
feeling of hope that Saddam Hussein would do that which he's
been called upon to do under international law," Mr. Bush
said.</p>
<p>For his part, King Hussein said he was "leaving with a
clearer idea of what the president's thinking is." But he
acknowledged that there hadn't been any breakthrough. At one
point in a brief exchange with reporters, he seemed almost
fatalistic as he pledged to continue trying to bring his U.S.
and Iraqi friends together.</p>
<p>"I suppose one has to have hope," he said. "Without hope
you can't get anywhere. And the dangers are such that it's
unthinkable to contemplate the idea of giving up and not
trying one's best to resolve this problem to the satisfaction
of all." The king denied persistent reports that he carried a
specific message or negotiating proposal from Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Separately, a senior Jordanian official told reporters
that Jordan doesn't intend to condone Iraq's occupation or
annexation of Kuwait. He said Jordan's low-key response to
Baghdad's moves, which has been so mild as to anger U.S.
officials, was designed to keep alive King Hussein's efforts
to reverse Iraqi policy. He suggested the king's effort was
derailed by the rapid international diplomatic and military
response that escalated tensions.</p>
<p>While prospects for a diplomatic resolution of the crisis
remained weak, the outlook also grew dimmer for the quick
departure of Americans who have been stuck in Iraq and Kuwait
since the invasion. In a move that troubled Bush
administration officials, Iraqis overseeing the occupation of
Kuwait declared that the estimated 2,500 Americans in Kuwait
should gather at a Kuwaiti hotel. The officials issued a
similar demand for British citizens.</p>
<p>By gathering these foreign nationals in one spot, Iraqi
authorities would increase their control over them. The order
raised fears that the Americans and Britons in Kuwait might
be moved to Iraq.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Iraqi
authorities told the U.S. ambassador to Kuwait, Nathaniel
Howell, that the Americans were being gathered to protect
them from some unspecified threat, and they asked him for
compliance within two hours. The ambassador replied that he
would inform Americans but couldn't order them to move. He
protested the demand.</p>
<p>A senior State Department official said the Iraqi
commander who conveyed the order hinted to the ambassador
that if Americans didn't comply, he would send his troops out
to round them up.</p>
<p>President Bush tried to avoid escalating U.S. rhetoric
about the Americans, arguing that "it's more dangerous, I
think, if I heighten the concern." But he said the order for
Americans to gather was a "violation of international norms"
and added: "Anything that compels individuals to do anything
against their will would, of course, concern me."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Saddam Hussein issued another statement,
calling Mr. Bush and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak "liars"
and warning that if the U.S. persists, "you are going to
receive some American bodies in bags." The Iraqi leader also
said that for the U.S. to demand that he withdraw from Kuwait
is like Iraq demanding that the U.S. "withdraw from the
southern states in the United States."</p>
<p>While Iraq has sent hints in recent days that it's
interested in negotiating about its occupation of Kuwait, Mr.
Bush continues to show little interest in holding such talks.
King Hussein, after his meeting with President Bush, said
their discussion was "open" and "candid," words that suggest
the talk was blunt.</p>
<p>King Hussein did please U.S. officials by suggesting that
Jordan is observing U.N. economic sanctions against Iraq and
won't serve as a conduit for goods heading to Iraq in
violation of the U.N.-ordered embargo. Just three days ago,
President Bush threatened to stop ships going into Jordan's
only port, Aqaba, if their cargo is destined for Iraq.</p>
<p>Later, the Pentagon formally announced the procedures U.S.
warships will follow to prevent civilian vessels from picking
up or delivering shipments to Iraq and Kuwait. The decision,
which had been expected but wasn't spelled out until
yesterday, authorizes the U.S. Navy to interdict cargo ships
by warning them to stop, searching them for materials covered
by United Nations sanctions and using "the minimal amount of
force necessary" to divert the vessels to other ports.</p>
<p>The Jordanian port of Aqaba is explicitly included in the
"primary area of operation" in the Persian Gulf, Gulf of
Oman, and the Red Sea announced by the Pentagon.</p>
<p>During his discussion, King Hussein also told Secretary of
State James Baker that Jordan is seeking a ruling from the
United Nations about whether food shipments would be allowed
under its sanctions resolution, which allows shipments of
goods for undefined humanitarian reasons. Referring to food
shipments, King Hussein said: "I believe there are certain
categories or areas where the situation is unclear."</p>
<p>Taken together, the comments suggest that Jordan intends
to follow the trade embargo voted by the U.N. in response to
Baghdad's military takeover of Kuwait but also wants to
please Iraq by exploiting any loopholes considered legally
acceptable.</p>
<p>President Bush suggested that he was generally, but not
totally, satisfied with Jordan's position, saying
"differences that possibly existed with Jordan have been
narrowed."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush also showed little concern about Iraq's attempt
this week to settle its differences with Iran, a step some
analysts said could ease military pressure on Baghdad and
lead to economic cooperation between the two states. He
expressed pleasure that Iran, which fought an eight-year war
with Iraq that ground to a halt only two years ago, continues
to criticize the Iraqi invasion.</p>
<p>After King Hussein left the presidential retreat, Mr. Bush
met with Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al Faisal. The Saudi
official later said the U.S. decision to offer troops to
defend Saudi Arabia against possible further Iraqi military
moves "will long be remembered." He asserted that the next
move in the standoff is up to Iraq and said, "What we are
hoping for is for Iraq to respond to international will and
Arab will."</p>
<p>Separately, a senior Jordanian official suggested that
abiding by U.N. sanctions is particularly important to Jordan
because of Amman's own insistence that the Israeli-occupied
West Bank be returned to it under a 23-year-old U.N.
resolution.</p>
<p>The official also said that Iraq's move into Kuwait may
have represented a "miscalculation" by Saddam Hussein, who
probably didn't anticipate the international response it has
aroused. But the Jordanian urged the U.S. to avoid a similar
miscalculation and refrain from military hostilities with
Iraq. He said a military fight "in the long run is going to
be a major disaster, and mostly for you, the U.S." because it
would incite radicals and Islamic fundamentalists throughout
the Middle East.</p>
