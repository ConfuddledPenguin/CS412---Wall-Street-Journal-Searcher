	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Board Governor John LaWare
said that the Fed's new capital requirements for banks
probably won't be proposed until early next year.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said in congressional
testimony last month that the Fed believes higher capital
requirements are needed to deter unusually risky lending by
banks. In a disclosure that surprised the markets and the
banking world, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed was working on
proposals that would increase the capital requirements for
banks above the levels set recently in an international
accord called the Basel agreement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Mr. LaWare said in an interview that the new capital
proposals wouldn't be issued anytime soon, partly because the
Fed is concerned about the current market for bank security
issues, which would be used to raise capital. "We are aware
that the markets are so wretched for bank securities now that
it does no good to mandate something attainable by the
industry only at an unacceptable cost," the Fed governor
said.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. LaWare said, the Fed wants to see what
proposals for revision of the deposit insurance system and
banking structure are made by the Treasury in its study due
at the end of the year. The Fed's capital proposal would
naturally have to take into account any changes called for by
the Treasury, Mr. LaWare said.</p>
<p>In particular, Mr. LaWare said he expects the Fed's
capital proposal would be coupled with a proposal allowing
regulators to take certain actions against a bank as the
bank's capital dwindled, and perhaps to take control of
institutions before capital was completely exhausted. Many
experts argue that such an approach would save the government
big sums in bank bailouts, but legal experts question whether
it would be an unconstitutional taking of property. "I think
they'd be part of a package," Mr. LaWare said, referring to
the capital and "early intervention" proposals.</p>
<p>Mr. LaWare wouldn't discuss interest rates, in keeping
with the Fed's policy of not commenting on them within two
weeks of a meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee, which
determines monetary policy. The committee meets next Tuesday.
But Mr. LaWare did say there were continued signs of a credit
crunch, in which banks were restricting lending beyond the
point the Fed would like to see.</p>
<p>"It's hard to see it in the macroeconomic data. But the
anecdotal evidence is increasingly strident and persuasive,"
he said. Last month, after Chairman Greenspan said for first
time that banks had restricted their lending a bit too much,
the Fed pushed down the Fed funds rate from to 8% from 8
1/4%.</p>
<p>Mr. LaWare said he expects that credit from banks could
remain tight in the foreseeable future, as banks continue to
"downsize" to raise their capital ratios by reducing assets.
"The banking system is generally in compliance" with the
Basel capital standards, Mr. LaWare said, "but banks may want
a cushion if they expect they will take more losses in real
estate or LBO {leveraged buy-out} loans."</p>
<p>In the real estate area, Mr. LaWare said he didn't see any
turnaround on the horizon for ailing markets in New England.
"It's hard to say" that real estate has bottomed out there,
he said. "I wish I could say with any conviction that it had.
There may still be some room to go down."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he expects West Coast real estate markets to
see further weakness. "I suspect there's some price
resistance settling in" in residential real estate, Mr.
LaWare said. "With the economy slowing, people are not
willing on the residential side to step up to those big
prices."</p>
