	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- A Noranda Inc. subsidiary succeeded in
overturning an agreement that would have settled a legal
dispute regarding ownership of a large copper and zinc
deposit in northern Quebec, in which Noranda has an indirect
interest.
   The Supreme Court of Quebec late Wednesday ordered the
owners of the Louvicourt deposit, Aur Resources Inc. and
Louvem Mines Inc., and Louvem's parent, St. Genevieve
Resources Ltd., to cancel the settlement proposal. Lance
Tigert, treasurer of Noranda Minerals Inc., said the court
found that the agreement violated the company's rights under
a shareholder pact with St. Genevieve.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Tigert said Noranda already has begun negotiations
with the other parties to arrive at a new settlement of the
legal dispute. He criticized the earlier accord, to which
Noranda wasn't a party, as being "lopsided."</p>
<p>The settlement would have given Toronto-based Aur 60% of
Louvicourt, which has been hailed as one of Canada's largest
base-metal discoveries in recent years. Louvem, based in
Montreal, would have kept 40% of the deposit. Louvem is owned
21% by Toronto-based Noranda and 50% by Montreal-based St.
Genevieve.</p>
<p>Negotiations could bog down on the important issue of who
will operate the mine, with both Noranda and Aur determined
to retain this role.</p>
<p>Pierre Gauthier, chairman and chief executive officer of
St. Genevieve, said the court also instructed the company to
cancel a notice of sale of 23% of Louvem's shares for a total
of 32.8 million Canadian dollars (US$28.7 million). Noranda
has the right of first refusal on any Louvem shares sold by
St. Genevieve.</p>
<p>But Mr. Gauthier said St. Genevieve might still seek to
sell part of its Louvem shares -- a move that could pressure
Noranda to agree to a settlement of the legal dispute. Mr.
Gauthier said Noranda would lose the right to veto any
settlement agreement if the combined interests of Noranda and
St. Genevieve in Louvem fell below 50%.</p>
