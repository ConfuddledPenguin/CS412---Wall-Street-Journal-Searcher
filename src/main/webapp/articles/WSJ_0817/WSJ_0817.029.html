	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. said the six-day strike at
a parts plant in Flint, Mich., forced the company to idle the
Van Nuys, Calif., assembly plant that builds the Pontiac
Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro.
   The California facility was closed yesterday, putting
about 3,500 employees out of work. It will reopen Monday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Flint walkout, which ended Aug. 13, caused GM to shut
all or part of nine U.S. assembly plants. All but the Van
Nuys plant and a truck plant in Ohio are scheduled to reopen
by today.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 10 major domestic auto makers planned to
build 111,263 cars this week, down 12.2% from 126,654 cars
manufactured a year earlier.</p>
