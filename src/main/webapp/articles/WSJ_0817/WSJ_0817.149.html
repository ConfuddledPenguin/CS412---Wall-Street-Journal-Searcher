	<p class="article-leader">SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- Raven Industries Inc. plans to
increase its quarterly dividend 20%, and expects to report
that net income for the second quarter ended July 31 rose
about 8%, David Christensen, president and chief executive
officer said.
   The company attributed the earnings increase to a high
level of defense-equipment sales for the quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Christensen said Raven will soon announce a dividend
increase to nine cents a share from 7.5 cents a share,
payable Oct. 15 to stock of record Sept. 21.</p>
<p>He estimated that net in the second quarter rose to about
$1.3 million, or 42 cents a share, compared with $1.2
million, or 38 cents, a year ago. Sales fell roughly 2% to
$21.4 million from $21.8 million.</p>
<p>In the six months, Mr. Christensen estimated that net rose
9% to $2.3 million, or 74 cents a share, from $2.1 million,
or 66 cents. Sales fell about 3% to $40.9 million from $42.3
million.</p>
<p>The company's backlog of orders as of July 31 rose 18% to
$43.2 million from $36.7 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Raven's electronics division will report that operating
profit more than doubled, largely because of increases in
orders for defense-related equipment. Sales of agricultural
controls for herbicide sprayers were also strong, said Mr.
Christensen.</p>
<p>The plastics division, which makes glass fiber tops for
pickup trucks and tanks for storing industrial chemicals,
expects a 76% increase in operating profit from last year's
second quarter.</p>
<p>The clothing division expects to report that operating
profit fell 39%, partly from the loss of a contract with the
Defense Department to make uniforms.</p>
<p>Mr. Christensen said he expects to report "record" sales
and profit for the year ending Jan. 31, but he declined to
elaborate. Last year the company earned $4.2 million, or
$1.31, on sales of $91 million.</p>
