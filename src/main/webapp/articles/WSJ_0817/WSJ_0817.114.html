	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal appeals court here called off
the election for a seat on the Los Angeles County Board of
Supervisors until the court reaches a decision on a Hispanic
voting rights suit in the nation's most populous county.
   By a 2-1 vote, the appeals panel stayed a ruling by U.S.
District Judge David V. Kenyon ordering a special primary
election using the new district lines, which are designed to
help elect a Hispanic to the county's five-member governing
board. Judge Kenyon ruled in June that the county
discriminated against Hispanics when redrawing district
boundaries after the 1980 census. On Aug. 3, the judge
rejected a redistricting plan drawn up by the county board
and then accepted one developed by civil-rights groups.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both sides were frustrated with the latest decision.
Attorneys for Los Angeles County had argued that a November
runoff election from a June primary in the old district
boundaries should be allowed to go ahead until the appeal was
decided. A Hispanic group and the American Civil Liberties
Union wanted a new election to be held based on the map
accepted by Judge Kenyon.</p>
<p>"Neither side has demonstrated that the equities strongly
favor going forward with their chosen election on November
6," wrote the appeals court judges. A full hearing is
scheduled for Oct. 1.</p>
