	<p class="article-leader">Reader's Digest Association Inc. said fiscal
fourth-quarter earnings nearly doubled from a year earlier,
despite mounting losses at its specialized magazine
operations.
   But the Pleasantville, N.Y., media company attributed the
jump in earnings largely to the negative effect of charges
taken in the 1989 fourth quarter. Excluding the effect of the
1989 charges, per-share earnings rose about 16% in the latest
period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the quarter ended June 30, net income rose to $20
million, or 16 cents a share, from $10.3 million, or nine
cents a share, a year earlier. The 1989 quarter included
costs from a program of awarding stock to senior management
and relocation of a U.K. subsidiary.</p>
<p>For fiscal 1990 -- the first full year of operations since
the company went public on Feb. 15 -- net rose to $176
million, or $1.48 a share, from $151.5 million, or $1.28 a
share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Revenue reached a record $2.01 billion, up 17% from $1.8
billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Reader's Digest said its largest contributor to earnings
was its book publishing and home entertainment unit, which
had a 19% rise in operating profit, to $229 million. Reader's
Digest magazine, including its domestic and numerous
international editions, had operating profit of $75.4
million, a 22% increase from 1989.</p>
<p>A growing area of weakness was the company's special
interest magazines, which include New Choices, Family
Handyman, Travel Holiday, American Health and the recently
acquired Moneywise, a U.K. personal finance magazine. Losses
at the unit grew to $26 million from $17.2 million in fiscal
1989.</p>
<p>Reader's Digest chairman George V. Grune said the losses
were due to "investment spending" on magazines to improve
their editorial quality. He said soft advertising for
consumer magazines also contributed to the unit's losses.</p>
