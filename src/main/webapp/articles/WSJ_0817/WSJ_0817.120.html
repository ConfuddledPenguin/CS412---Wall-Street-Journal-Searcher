	<p class="article-leader">BUSH MET with Jordan's King amid fears about Americans
under Iraqi control.
   The two leaders seemed to make little progress toward
resolving the U.S. showdown with Iraq. "I did not come away
from that conversation with any feeling of hope that Saddam
Hussein would" withdraw from Kuwait, Bush told reporters
after his talk with King Hussein, who also acknowledged there
hadn't been any breakthrough. In Kuwait, Iraqi military
authorities overseeing the Kuwaiti occupation declared that
Americans and Britons in Kuwait should assemble at a hotel. A
State Department official said the Iraqis hinted that if
Americans didn't comply, Saddam Hussein would send troops to
round them up.</p>

townships that left at least 156 people dead.</p>

<p>An investigation is being conducted by the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission concerning the agency's licensing of

<p>Gorbachev will interrupt his vacation to work on the draft

the plan, due to be completed Sept. 1.</p>

<p>Scientists learned how a particular gene can sharply boost
the amount of fat that is circulating in the bloodstream,
increasing the risk of heart and other diseases. The finding,

triglycerides.</p>

<p>The U.S. Export-Import Bank said it is ready to provide

<p>A jury began deliberating the cases of three former
Northwest Airlines pilots accused of being drunk when they

are innocent of flying-while-intoxicated charges.</p>

<p>Social Democratic leaders declared the end of East
Germany's shaky coalition, a move that could delay
unification with West Germany. But the party leaders' move,
sparked by Premier de Maiziere's firing of four cabinet
ministers a day before, still requires approval from the
party's parliamentary caucus, which is to meet Tuesday.</p>

government subsidies and increased prices.</p>

three years, and some such as Los Angeles and New York failed
more frequently, the agency said.</p>

slogans at the officers.</p>
