	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Anxiety about developments in the Middle East,
inflationary fears and the dollar's weakness in world
foreign-exchange markets sent gold-futures prices surging
$6.60 an ounce.
   December gold ended at $417.90, just a dime shy of the
day's highest trade, after reports of new threats by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This market is strictly being run by Iraq," said William
O'Neill, senior futures strategist at Merrill Lynch. "Any
sign of heightened tension is immediately being reflected in
the gold market."</p>
<p>At the same time, he added, the rise in the price of gold
reflected problems of the dollar and concern about inflation
following release of the consumer price index for July. The
government report showed that prices, excluding energy and
food, rose 0.6%. Expectations had been for an increase of
about 0.4%, Mr. O'Neill said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. Mint reported that sales of American
Eagle gold coins are soaring, a strong indication of a flight
to safety and away from dollar-denominated assets. In the
first 14 days of August, sales of the coin totaled 44,000
ounces, the Mint said, more than in each of the three
preceding months. Sales of the one-ounce version of the coin
accounted for 41,500 ounces, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>The total sales compare with 40,000 ounces in May, 43,000
in June and 20,000 in July, the Mint spokesman said. The drop
in July came because it is typically a slow month for coin
sales, he said.</p>
<p>Further evidence of gold enthusiasm came from Earl Hadady,
editor of the Bullish Consensus, a Pasadena, Calif.,
organization that takes daily surveys of sentiment among
investment professionals. While negative sentiment about the
stock market has been growing, he said, "almost seven out of
10 traders are bullish" on gold.</p>
<p>That's cause for caution, said Mr. Hadady, because it
suggests "the market is now beginning to be overbought. When
you get such a preponderance of buyers, the buying trend
begins to run out of steam. We're looking for the gold market
to top out soon."</p>
<p>In other markets yesterday:</p>
<p>LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Live cattle futures closed narrowly
mixed as traders evened up their contract holdings ahead of
this afternoon's release of the government's cattle on feed
report for July. Most futures analysts are expecting a 5% to
6% increase in the number of cattle placed on feed lots last
month compared with July 1989. The number of fattened cattle
being shipped off feed lots to be slaughtered rose about 3%
in July, compared with a year ago, analysts estimated. Live
cattle futures for October delivery gained 0.12 cent a pound
to close at 77.92 cents. The increased supply of cattle on
feed lots as of last month won't reach slaughterhouses for
about five months, so the October contract hasn't been
affected by predictions for more crowded feed lots. But
December live cattle futures dipped 0.02 cent a pound to
76.52 cents, reflecting the outlook for an increased
slaughter by year end.</p>
<p>SUGAR: Futures prices were higher despite two bearish
developments. The October contract ended with a gain of 0.24
cent a pound at 11.14 cents. Before the opening, a report by
F.O. Licht, a West German sugar statistical firm, projected a
one million-ton surplus for the 1989-90 season, which ends
Aug. 31. Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers,
said the surplus had been anticipated, following a Cuban
report earlier this year that the country's production would
be higher than some outside estimates. Around the close of
trading, the second set of French sugar beet tests was
reported. France is expected to produce 7,101 tons of beets
per hectare. (A hectare is equal to 2.47 acres.) This
compares with 5,803 tons in the first test on Aug. 1, and
6,861 tons in the previous season's second test. Sugar
content of the beets was put at 18.88%, compared with 17.31%
on Aug. 1 and 16.63% a year earlier. According to Ms. Kaul,
the recent dry spell didn't affect the beets because it
wasn't prolonged enough.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices were easier. The September contract
was 0.90 cent a pound lower at $1.3265. In early trading, the
contract was up to $1.3460. Japanese demand for copper, which
has been a big spur for prices, was absent in London
yesterday, an analyst said. There were no other fundamental
developments, and traders by and large were watching to see
if the inflationary impact of higher oil costs will adversely
affect the already softening U.S. economy and reduce demand
for copper.</p>
