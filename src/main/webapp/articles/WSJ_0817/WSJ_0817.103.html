	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Navistar International Corp. eked out a fiscal
third-quarter profit amid signs that the slump in the truck
industry is worsening.
   Earnings were slightly better than expected; some analysts
had expected the company to report a small loss.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The maker of trucks and diesel engines said net income for
the quarter ended July 31 dropped 79% to $6 million from $28
million, or eight cents a share, it earned for the similar
1989 quarter. The company said its per-share net income for
the latest period was less than a penny because of its
obligation to pay dividends on the Series G preferred stock.</p>
<p>Revenue dropped 10% to $972 million from $1.08 billion.
Navistar said the number of medium and heavy trucks it sold
in the quarter sank 15% from a year ago.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Navistar fell 37.5 cents to $2.875. The stock was the
second-most-active issue on the Big Board, with almost 2.2
million shares traded.</p>
<p>Navistar trimmed its estimate of industrywide demand for
trucks in North America -- signaling that a recovery in truck
orders probably isn't materializing as expected. After
slumping in 1989, industrywide new truck orders have been
stable at low levels for several months.</p>
<p>With more economists predicting recession, Navistar
trimmed its fiscal year forecast by 2,000 to 140,000 heavy
trucks, which would be down 19% from last year. Industrywide
demand for medium-sized trucks will probably drop 6%, the
company said.</p>
<p>Truck sales could drop further still if the Middle East
conflict raises fuel prices for a prolonged period, analysts
said.</p>
<p>Because Iraq's invasion of Kuwait disrupted Middle East
oil supplies, the price of fuel has jumped more than 30% for
some transportation companies. That is eroding profit margins
at the large truck fleets, which might prompt some to slow
purchases.</p>
<p>"Earlier in the year we thought there was a possibility
that sales would turn positive in the second half of the
year," said Larry D. Hollis, a securities analyst at Robert
W. Baird & Co. in Milwaukee. "That increasingly isn't
likely."</p>
<p>Navistar said it plans to build 4% fewer trucks in the
fourth quarter compared with the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts expect Navistar to break even on an
operating basis for the quarter ending Oct. 31.</p>
<p>With the economy apparently weakening, however, some
analysts are speculating that manufacturers such as Navistar
might have to set aside more money to cover potential losses
on loans to customers and dealers.</p>
<p>"The truckers are getting incredibly squeezed," said
Mitchell I. Quain, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder, New York.
Mr. Quain has been recommending that his clients sell the
stock.</p>
<p>Analysts said they aren't aware of any problem with the
quality of the loans made by Navistar. But the loan-loss
provisions in the third quarter for the company's credit unit
and manufacturing operations were about $7 million -- an
amount that analysts said might be too small. Receivables at
those businesses total about $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>A company spokesman wouldn't confirm the loan-loss
provisions, describing that information as proprietary. "We
believe they are adequate," the spokesman said.</p>
