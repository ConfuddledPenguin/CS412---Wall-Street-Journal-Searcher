	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- Anxious to keep sales from
slipping further this year, Chrysler Corp. is trotting out
another survey that once again asserts its cars are better
than Japanese models.
   This time, Chrysler is saying that two groups of
California consumers -- consisting of people who own only
domestic-brand cars -- preferred Chrysler models over
competing cars made by Toyota Motor Corp. Specifically,
Chrysler's advertising says, the consumers picked the Dodge
Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim over the Toyota Camry, and chose
the Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance over the Toyota
Tercel.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last May, Chrysler began an aggressive advertising
campaign that said another group of buyers picked the same
Chrysler models over Honda Motor Company's Accord and Civic.
As with the earlier claims, the latest surveys were conducted
with groups of 100 "import intenders," defined by Chrysler as
domestic-brand car owners "who are thinking about buying an
imported car." The surveys didn't ask any owners of foreign
cars for their evaluations.</p>
<p>Chrysler selected so-called import intenders "because
these are the people we're trying to get to take a look at
what we have these days," says Chrysler spokesman Tom
Jakobowski. But some advertising executives and pollsters
have criticized the Chrysler survey as being too limited in
the types and numbers of consumers surveyed.</p>
<p>Chrysler is aiming its advertising squarely at Japanese
car makers, who claimed a record 26% share of the U.S. market
last year and have continued their gains this year.</p>
<p>Chrysler, on the other hand, has seen its share of the
U.S. car market fall to 8.8% so far this year, from 10.4% a
year earlier. When the year is over, Chrysler may wind up in
fifth place -- behind Honda and Toyota -- in sales of cars
alone, although Chrysler would still lead those companies in
combined sales of cars, trucks and minivans.</p>
<p>While Chrysler's car-market share remained flat after the
ads challenging Honda, the campaign seemed to help boost
sales of the compact Spirit and Acclaim. Sales of those
models, which have received high quality ratings, jumped 19%
to 112,052 cars in the first seven months of this year. But
some of the gain is attributable to slower production last
year when the cars were just beginning to hit the market.
Sales of the Shadow and Sundance were off 19.8% through the
end of July.</p>
<p>In fact, so far this year Honda has sold more U.S.-built
Accords and Toyota more U.S.-made Camrys than Chrysler has
sold Spirits and Acclaims combined. Likewise, U.S.-made Honda
Civic subcompacts have outsold the Shadow and Sundance.</p>
<p>Chrysler started airing two commercials with the Toyota
comparison on network and cable television Wednesday, and it
will run print ads beginning Monday. Unlike the Honda
comparisons, the new broadcast campaign won't feature
Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca. Instead an announcer will
say during the ads: "The cars that beat the Honda Civic now
beat Toyota. Who's next?"</p>
<p>Chrysler commissioned the survey from U.S. Testing Co.
Market Research Inc., the same Wheeling, Ill., firm that
conducted the Honda comparisons. Chrysler said the two groups
of consumers, consisting of owners of General Motors Corp.
and Ford Motor Co. cars, tested the Chrysler and Toyota
models over a 2.4-mile route and were asked to compare 33
attributes. The consumers weren't told that the test was
sponsored by Chrysler, the company said.</p>
<p>Of the 100 consumers in the Toyota Camry LE comparison,
Chrysler said 80 picked the Spirit and Acclaim. In the Honda
comparison, Chrysler said 83 preferred its two models to the
Accord.</p>
<p>The group that tested the Shadow and Sundance against the
Toyota Tercel Deluxe preferred the Chrysler vehicles 91 to 9,
Chrysler said.</p>
