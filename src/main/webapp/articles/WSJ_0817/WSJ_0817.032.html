	<p class="article-leader">Hewlett-Packard Co., citing stiff competition and cuts in
defense spending, reported a 5% drop in net income for its
third quarter ended July 31.
   The Palo Alto, Calif., maker of computers and electronic
instruments posted net of $178 million, or 73 cents a share,
compared with $187 million, or 79 cents a share, in the
year-earlier period. Analysts expected HP to earn about 80
cents a share. Revenue for the quarter increased 8% to $3.2
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>HP said its results were hurt by weaker spending in
defense, aerospace and health services and by loss of market
share in personal computers and workstations, where
competition is fierce and HP's offerings lately have lagged
the industry.</p>
<p>In response, analysts cut slightly estimates for HP's
fourth quarter and fiscal 1991 earnings, but said they were
pleased with the company's efforts to hold down increases in
operating expenses, which grew 6% in the third quarter.</p>
<p>"Expenses were the upside surprise," said Steven
Milunovich, an analyst at First Boston Corp. "They're doing
the job there."</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, HP's stock fell $1.875 a share to close at $35.875
a share.</p>
<p>However, growth in orders for the quarter slowed, with
orders rising 9% from the year-earlier period to $3.3
billion. The company's growth in orders is generally higher.
The sluggishness "led us to view the months ahead with
caution," said John Young, HP's chief executive, in a
prepared statement.</p>
<p>While part of the slowdown is due to global economic
factors, the company's difficulties in PCs and workstations
-- two expanding markets -- are especially worrisome. Last
year, the company became the biggest supplier of
workstations, desktop computers used by engineers and
scientists, after purchasing Apollo Computer Inc. But this
year Sun Microsystems Inc. has overtaken HP, which is in a
battle for second place with Digital Equipment Corp.</p>
<p>Mr. Young, in an interview earlier this week, vowed that
"Sun isn't going to run away with this marketplace" and that
the company planned to introduce more competitive models
later this year.</p>
<p>In PCs, HP had been gaining momentum in recent years, so
the slowdown here is a surprise. While the company has never
broken out of the "second tier" of PC suppliers, it hopes to
win important niche markets with new models based on Intel
Corp.'s state-of-the-art 486 microprocessor. But sales of
those models are disappointing, company officials told
analysts.</p>
<p>To counter slippage in PCs, Mr. Young yesterday named
Jacques Clay as the PC group's new chief and said the group's
headquarters will move from Sunnyvale, Calif., to Grenoble,
France, where Mr. Clay has run the company's European PC
division. HP's former PC chief joined Apple Computer Inc.
recently.</p>
<p>Improving its market position in PCs and workstations is
critical to HP's future because its minicomputer business,
once a mainstay, is under siege. "The minicomputer business
is faced with obsolescence," said Peter Rogers, an analyst
with Robertson Stephens & Co.</p>
