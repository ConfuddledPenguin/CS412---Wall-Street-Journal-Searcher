	<p class="article-leader">At Nintendo, customer feedback helps us deliver
top-quality entertainment products. We were particularly
distressed, therefore, when our good customer, the Honorable
Alex Kozinski, offered his perspective in a July 27 Leisure &
Arts page article.
   We share with Judge Kozinski an abiding concern for game
quality. We actively search world-wide for the best software
developers. Contrary to the judge's impression, we do not
control these developers. We work with them intensively to
unleash the creative talents that are so apparent in games
designed for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Our intensive
game-evaluation system, which includes input from players
such as Judge Kozinski, ensures that our developers are
constantly one step ahead in creating games that will pique
consumer interest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Our customer services have expanded since 1985 and have
become even more comprehensive. Game counselors now answer
over 50,000 consumer game inquiries on game play per week.
The Judge apparently had an unsatisfactory experience trying
to return a defective cartridge to an unnamed retailer. He
should be assured that Nintendo retailers will accept a
defective product for immediate exchange. Retailers receive
full credit for any defective products returned to Nintendo.
Customers who choose to send products directly to Nintendo
for repair can expect to receive their items back in just
three to five days on average. By the way, we pride ourselves
on a software defect rate of less than one percent.</p>
<p>So we say to Judge Kozinski that we have not become "fat
and flabby." We do not take you and your son for granted as
Nintendo players. We know that, apart from your backgammon
board, there are other entertainment options available to you
inside and outside the video game business. Whatever your
doubts, we have the perfect prescription for your apparent
game burnout, an exciting new brainteaser, "Dr. Mario," which
comes to market this fall. It is sure to be another of the
Nintendo mega-hits.</p>
