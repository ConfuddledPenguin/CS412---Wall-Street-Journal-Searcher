	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Shares in Reuters Holdings PLC were hit by
reports of snags in the upgraded version of the company's
Dealing 2000 system, a communications network for
foreign-exchange markets.
   On London's Stock Exchange, Reuters stock fell 7.9%, while
American depositary receipts plunged 11% to $51.375 in
national over-the-counter trading in New York. The sell-off
was prompted by a negative research report by Wertheim
Schroder, a New York investment firm. The firm reportedly
took Reuters off its list of recommended stocks, citing
problems with Dealing 2000-2.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wertheim refused to provide copies of its report or to
discuss its message.</p>
<p>Also, Trading Systems Technology, an industry newsletter,
said in a recent edition that Reuters was having testing
problems with the new system.</p>
<p>The system, which represents a major investment and a
potentially significant source of profits, will allow
foreign-exchange dealers to communicate with as many as four
parties via computer terminals. Dealers could also enter bids
and offers, which the system would match up.</p>
<p>In London, the company dismissed reports that the Dealing
2000-2 project is having problems, though it said that
"further testing is required on peripheral systems and
overall system integration."</p>
<p>Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal,
owns Telerate Inc., which, among other things, competes with
Reuters in the electronic currency trading market.</p>
