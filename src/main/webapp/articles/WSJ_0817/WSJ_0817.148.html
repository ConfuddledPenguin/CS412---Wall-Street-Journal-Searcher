	<p class="article-leader">BEDFORD, Mass. -- Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. has agreed
to accept less interest on a $500 million loan to the parent
of Prime Computer Inc. in exchange for a larger equity stake
in the big computer maker.
   The move comes as Prime reported operating profit of $19.2
million for the second quarter, its first operating profit in
six quarters, on higher revenue of $403.5 million. Prime was
acquired last year in a $1.3 billion leveraged buy-out by DR
Holdings, a closely held unit of J.H. Whitney & Co., a New
York investment concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The revision in loan terms appears to acknowledge
Shearson's difficulty in unloading the debt on the junk bond
market. "This was a bridge too far, the six-week loan that
went on forever," says Byron Walker, a credit analyst at
Moody's Investors Service Inc. "It's a big embarrassment."</p>
<p>Julie T. Katzman, a Shearson vice president, said that
Prime "has been servicing its debt and delivering terrific
performance." She said that Shearson doesn't plan to write
off any of the debt and that "in the long run we expect our
investment in Prime will give us extremely attractive capital
gains." She said the move reflected Shearson's confidence in
the long-term prospects of Prime and the collapse of a viable
public market for acquisition-related junk debt.</p>
<p>DR Holdings disclosed a net loss of $36.2 million for its
second quarter, reflecting purchase accounting and interest
payments and including such non-cash charges as depreciation
and amortization of goodwill. Its results aren't directly
comparable with Prime's year-ago loss of $19 million, on
revenue of $382 million. Prime's stock isn't publicly traded,
though it still has debt outstanding.</p>
<p>Shearson and Prime executives said that under the revised
loan terms, Prime will pay a sharply lower rate equal to
about 12.5%, or 4% over the floating London interbank rate,
rising to 5% over that rate in 1993 -- saving Prime about $40
million a year over current interest costs. In return,
Shearson will get an additional 7.5% equity interest in DR
Holdings, and a further 1% of equity every quarter the
present loan is outstanding to a maximum of 25%. Through
direct and indirect holdings, Shearson currently holds a 19%
stake in Prime.</p>
<p>Shearson is a unit of American Express Co.</p>
<p>Lawrence W. Eckenfelder, a Prudential-Bache analyst, said
the revision of terms of the Prime loan "sounds like a good
move for Shearson, assuming they recover their principle some
day." He added that those concerns had diminished recently as
Prime's results improved, "though Shearson certainly isn't
out of the woods yet."</p>
<p>Prime had been under siege by investor Bennett S. LeBow --
backed by the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert -- until
J.H. Whitney acquired it a year ago. Since then, Prime has
reported a string of losses on declining sales and cut its
payroll by 2,500, to 9,100 workers.</p>
<p>Yesterday's reported results represented significant gains
for Prime. "It was a terrific quarter for us," said James F.
McDonald, vice chairman and chief executive. He said the
company has become increasingly focused on software and
services, which now account for more than 70% of revenue,
with the traditional minicomputer business amounting to less
than 30%. The computer-aided-design business, boosted by the
$435 million acquisition of Computervision Corp. in 1988, has
become the fastest growing part of the company, he said.</p>
<p>Despite its problems, Prime has attracted high-profile
management talent since the buy-out. In January, former
Digital Equipment Corp. senior vice president John J. Shields
joined as president and chief operating officer. Also, Prime
recently won a $180 million piece of a five-year Electronic
Data Systems Corp. Army computer contract.</p>
