	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- History has known scores of kings in exile. Now
there is an economy in exile.
   Welcome to the new Kuwait. You can find it at the local
Kuwaiti bank branch here that is suddenly headquarters for a
multinational financial giant. And at the London Bridge City
property development along the River Thames. And at the local
office of the Kuwait state oil company, one of Europe's
largest gasoline retailers. Since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
two weeks ago, London has become the refuge and headquarters
of most of Kuwait's exiled business leaders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>They are keeping their country's vast international
financial and business empire going -- and even thriving --
despite the occupation of their home by a foreign power and
world-wide restrictions on asset transfers that hamper normal
operations. "Kuwait's assets can, to a great extent, function
in exile -- however unjust the exile is," says a spokesman
for United Bank of Kuwait PLC, a big London-based bank owned
by Kuwaitis.</p>
<p>With $100 billion in overseas investments, Kuwait's wealth
long has given it international economic clout beyond its
tiny size. Its economy is three times the size of Greece's.
It pumps gasoline from Stockholm to Rome. It commands one of
the world's largest tanker fleets. It owns U.S. real estate,
Malaysian plantations and such blue-chip investments as
roughly 14% of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, just under 20% of
chemical giant Hoechst AG and 10% of Britain's Midland Bank
PLC. In the U.S., it owns Santa Fe International Corp., a San
Francisco-based oil and gas concern. That global scope has
made the events since the Iraqi invasion more than just
another scramble by some rich Arabs to get themselves and
their money out.</p>
<p>Kuwait's senior businessmen, financiers and money managers
are gearing up to make their economy-in-exile a force to be
reckoned with. If they succeed, they may be able to bring
enormous financial influence to bear on the debate over the
future of their country.</p>
<p>"We may not have been able to defend ourselves
militarily," says a former Kuwaiti cabinet minister now in
London. "But we have resources."</p>
<p>And though Kuwaiti politicians haven't made any official
promises, the average exile-on-the-street in London is all
for using the wealth to bankroll the Western military
campaign. "If you ask any Kuwaiti, they are ready to pay,"
says Abdulla Alsaleh, a Kuwaiti real-estate developer now in
exile here. "What Mr. Bush has done is excellent. It's fair.
We should pay our part of the cost."</p>
<p>In a coffee shop in a Kuwaiti neighborhood behind
Selfridge's, the posh London department store, the
52-year-old Mr. Alsaleh laments that his Kuwaiti credit cards
are now worthless. The local National Bank of Kuwait branch,
where he has an account, is limiting withdrawals to #1,000
($1,900) a week. And the British private school where he
plans to enroll two children this autumn charges #6,000 a
year. "They say they will take it in installments," he says.
"We have to control costs."</p>
<p>His friend, a Kuwaiti broker at Shearson Lehman Inc.'s
London office, enters the coffee shop. The broker says he
spent the first few days after the invasion calming his many
Kuwaiti clients-in-exile, fearful for their investments;
they're all safe, though global asset restrictions prevent
them from transferring funds out of Britain. Even customers
still trapped in Kuwait aren't entirely cut off. One trading
order was smuggled out over the desert.</p>
<p>"It's `Desert DHL,'" Mr. Alsaleh chortles.</p>
<p>Mr. Alsaleh, whom the invasion trapped in London while he
was vacationing with his family, affects a jovial mien -- but
he's clearly worried. "I'm trying to organize my life," he
says. Though he professes confidence that he will one day
return to his Kuwaiti business and properties, "it may take
some time."</p>
<p>While waiting, the Kuwaitis have formed their
financial-establishment-in-exile around the nucleus of the
Kuwait Investment Office, which controls much of Kuwait's
global portfolio. Key people include Khaled al-Sabah, deputy
general manager and chief day-to-day controller of the
office, who has been in London most of the week. Also in
London is the governor of the Kuwaiti central bank, and
numerous private bankers. Other officials, from the oil
minister to the managing director of the Kuwait Investment
Authority -- who escaped overland in a 48-hour dash across
Iraqi lines several days ago -- also are in frequent contact
with London from the Persian Gulf and elsewhere.</p>
<p>In a stuffy conference room across London, the management
board of National Bank of Kuwait meets in exile, many
directors having escaped days earlier in furtive trips across
the desert.</p>
<p>"We are establishing a sort of informal cabinet," says a
senior Kuwaiti monetary official involved in the group. "A
substantial portion of the human infrastructure has gotten
out of Kuwait. With the assets and people out of the hands of
the invading powers, Kuwait is able to pull its act together
and reorganize to be more effective -- no matter how long it
takes for the situation to go back to normal."</p>
<p>For the moment, the situation is anything but normal. The
asset freeze imposed by most Western governments means
Kuwaiti holdings overseas generally can't be moved across
borders or disbursed. But U.S. and U.K. authorities, in
particular, have been flexible with the exiled Kuwaiti
businessmen; Kuwait Petroleum, for instance, can now transfer
funds around its European operations. And most private
Western bankers, on the advice of their countries' central
banks, have resumed many dealings with the Kuwaitis. A
crucial factor in gaining this status, bankers say, was that
so many of their countries' exiled financial leaders were
directly on hand in London to prove to authorities that they
-- and not Iraq -- were in control of the Kuwaiti assets.</p>
<p>Thus, in the New Bond Street offices of Kuwait Petroleum,
an unusual drama is unfolding of an oil giant making do
without a home country or its own oil. The company, operating
in Europe under the apt "Q8" brand name, owns a vast network
of 6,533 gasoline stations and three refineries, also in
Europe, to retail Kuwaiti petroleum products. Now, under its
exiled directors, it's scrambling to keep the business going
by buying oil from others. Competitors confirm it is
succeeding.</p>
<p>"We're optimistic" about securing Saudi crude, says David
Robson, marketing director of Kuwait Petroleum International
Ltd., the company's European marketing arm. "We will continue
like any other oil company," buying oil from producers and
refining and marketing it.</p>
<p>At the investment office, officials also have succeeded --
with the aid of the Bank of England -- in ensuring the office
can continue to invest with some semblance of normalcy. But
traders and bankers familiar with the investment office
suggest that the upheaval caused by the asset freeze may lead
the agency -- which had become a more-aggressive investor in
recent years -- to lower its profile. The office may raise
cash and reduce its long-term block holdings, they say.</p>
<p>The logic behind such a move, traders say, is that it
would keep the fund more liquid to provide capital to the
Kuwaiti government in exile and avoid possible investment
restrictions by governments concerned about the strategic
ramifications of a large Kuwaiti holding.</p>
<p>Officials of the Kuwait Investment Office declined to
comment for this article.</p>
<p>As news of Iraq's invasion rocked the world financial
markets nearly two weeks ago, fund managers at the Kuwaiti
office and other Arab funds in London quickly decided to
reduce their exposure to the markets.</p>
<p>Kuwaiti financial executives "wanted to be liquid"
immediately following the invasion, says Robert L. Thomas,
director at Midland Bank PLC's Midland Montagu international
financial unit, a London institution that trades with the
Kuwaiti office.</p>
<p>Over the longer term, the asset freeze raises legal
questions that could lead to years of litigation among
Kuwaitis with claims to the assets and banks with
counterclaims. "There is too much money just to sit there for
five or six years," says Prof. Harold Koh, an international
law expert at Yale Law School.</p>
<p>The biggest question is who owns the assets. In the long
term, the assets belong to the Kuwaiti people, most of whom
are still in the country. Indeed, the investment office's
reason for existence is to invest the proceeds of oil revenue
to benefit future generations when the wells run dry.
However, the entity that has always controlled the assets is
the internationally recognized Kuwaiti government -- now in
exile -- which would seem to have strongest legal claim to
managing the holdings.</p>
<p>Kuwait continues to have expenses for its embassies and
for its ruling family -- and these claims are likely to be
the first to cross central bankers' desks.</p>
