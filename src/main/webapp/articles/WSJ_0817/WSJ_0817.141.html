	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Leonard Green & Partners said it agreed to
buy Carr-Gottstein Inc., Alaska's largest food-and-drug
retailer and wholesaler, for about $300 million.
   This is the first acquisition by Leonard Green & Partners,
a merchant banking firm specializing in leveraged buy-outs
that was founded late last year by Leonard Green, formerly a
partner of New York-based Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen Ltd.
Leveraged buy-out activity in general has dropped since last
year's collapse of the junk-bond market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokeswoman for Leonard Green & Partners said the
acquisition of Carr-Gottenstein, which should be completed in
the fall, wouldn't involve junk bonds. She wouldn't elaborate
on the nature of the financing.</p>
<p>Mr. Green, who was credited with much of the success that
Gibbons, Green had with arranging LBOs in the 1980s, said he
left that firm because of "philosophical differences" with
his partners. Since setting up his own shop, he has been
struggling to match his prior track record; he has said his
goal is to complete between six and nine buy-outs, valued at
$100 million to $500 million each, in the next three years.</p>
<p>Carr-Gottstein includes Carr's food and drug stores, the
J.B. Gottstein Co. wholesaling operation, the Oaken Keg
liquor stores, several shopping centers in Anchorage, Eagle
River, and Fairbanks and several other distribution-related
concerns.</p>
<p>The acquisition provides for new stores and remodeling of
existing stores. Carr's General Manager John Cairns and its
vice president of operations, Mark Williams, will retain
their management positions, Leonard Green & Partners said.</p>
