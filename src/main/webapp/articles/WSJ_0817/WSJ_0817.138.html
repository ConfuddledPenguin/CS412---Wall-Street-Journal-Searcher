	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A shareholder filed suit, charging AmBase
Corp. with disseminating false information about a special
dividend to inflate its stock price in recent weeks.
   The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, seeks
class-action status. The suit claims that investors were
misled from May 14 until Tuesday, when the company announced
details of an agreement to sell its Home Insurance Co. unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On May 14, AmBase said that it was suspending its
quarterly common stock dividend but that it expected to pay a
special dividend to shareholders when it closed the sale of
Home Insurance. But Tuesday, when AmBase announced the sale
of Home Insurance to Vik Brothers International, it also said
it no longer expects to pay the special dividend.</p>
<p>AmBase, a financial-services company, said this week that
it will use proceeds from the $544 million sale of Home
Insurance to help pay down debt.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that AmBase should have disclosed
earlier that it wouldn't be able to pay the special dividend.
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of all shareholders who bought
stock between May 14 and Tuesday, claims that AmBase kept the
information secret to entice investors. The lawsuit seeks
unspecified damages.</p>
<p>A company spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Ambase shares fell 87.5 cents to $1.875. On Wednesday, the
stock plummeted $4.75 to close at $2.75.</p>
