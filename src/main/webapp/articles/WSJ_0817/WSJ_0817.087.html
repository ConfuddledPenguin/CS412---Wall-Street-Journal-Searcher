	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Walter Yetnikoff, the outspoken chief
executive officer who steered CBS Records into world
prominence and engineered its $2 billion sale to Sony Corp.,
is preparing to pull back from his management duties at the
company.
   According to executives familiar with the plan, Mr.
Yetnikoff just signed a new agreement that calls for him to
leave the chief executive post after two years. In the
meantime, he is to gradually pull out of active management
and focus on grooming his successor, the executives said. The
most logical candidate at present for that post is Tommy
Mottola, president of CBS Records domestic operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Yetnikoff was said to be unavailable late yesterday,
and Sony officials couldn't be reached for comment. But
people close to Mr. Yetnikoff stressed that he wasn't forced
out of the company and had in part initiated the move. As
reported, Mr. Yetnikoff spent several months last year
undergoing treatment for alcoholism, and has been publicly
outspoken about his efforts to combat problems with substance
abuse. Since successfully undergoing treatment, however, Mr.
Yetnikoff is said to have been unhappy at work, and is in the
midst of a second divorce.</p>
<p>Mr. Yetnikoff is also said to be distressed by the highly
unflattering portrait of him in a new book, "Hit Men" by
Frederic Dannen. Mr. Yetnikoff is one of the central
characters in the book, which focuses on the top record
labels in the industry, and their involvement with
independent promoters who have been linked to organized
crime.</p>
<p>Mr. Yetnikoff was an early enthusiast for getting Sony
into Hollywood, and took part in early negotiations to buy
MGM/UA Communications Inc. When those failed, he helped
persuade Sony to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainmnent Inc.
and to hire producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber as its new
management team. Mr. Yetnikoff is said to be bitterly
disappointed that he has been unable to play a more active
role at Columbia. When Sony bought Columbia last year, it
announced plans to make Mr. Yetnikoff chairman of an umbrella
committee overseeing records and music.</p>
<p>However, company insiders said that never came to pass,
largely because Mr. Guber, the chief executive of Columbia,
resisted the idea -- and Mr. Yetnikoff's involvement in
Columbia's affairs. In a recent telephone interview, Mr.
Yetnikoff acknowledged that he was not actively involved at
Columbia, but indicated that it was because he had his hands
full in the record business.</p>
<p>Mr. Yetnikoff, a Brooklyn native who worked his way
through Columbia University Law School, started in the early
1960s as an attorney at CBS, rising through its ranks by
cultivating strong relationships with rising artists and
signing up acts such as the The Rolling Stones. Proud of his
reputation for outrageousness, Mr. Yetnikoff frequently threw
tantrums or screamed insults in Yiddish, and feuded with
other executives and even recording artists such as Paul
Simon, who fought a long and acrimonious legal battle with
CBS Records when he defected to Warner Records, now a unit of
Time Warner Inc.</p>
<p>Mr. Yetnikoff's most bitter recent feud was with Larry
Tisch, the billonaire chairman of Loews Corp. who acquired
control of parent company CBS Inc. Mr. Yetnikoff was
frequently angry that Mr. Tisch wouldn't accede to his many
demands or let him spend money the way he wanted to, and
publicly berated Mr. Tisch on several occasions. Mr. Tisch
ultimately authorized Mr. Yetnikoff to seek a buyer for the
company, and he played a prominent role in the sale to Sony.</p>
<p>Although Sony doesn't provide detailed breakdowns of its
operations, CBS Records is believed to have had sales of
about $3 billion and operating profit of about $450 million
in the year ended last March.</p>
<p>Mr. Yetnikoff surprised the record industry in 1988 when
he hired Mr. Mottola to replace Al Teller as president of the
CBS domestic records group. Mr. Mottola, a manager of such
groups as Hall & Oates who also had a short-lived career as a
singer, had never run a company. Although insiders say his
administrative skills still leave something to be desired, he
has strong relations with talent, a key factor for success in
the music business.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Mottola has been at the helm, he has reorganized
the U.S. operations, hiring a number of strong young
executives from rivals such as Time Warner Inc.'s Warner
Records. With his new team, he has started to wean CBS from
its dependence on more established superstars such as Billy
Joel and Bruce Springsteen. Mr. Mottola has focused on
developing successful new acts popular with younger record
buyers such as Living Color, Indigo Girls and Bonham. The
company's most phenomenal success in that market has been New
Kids on the Block, considered one of the industry's hottest
new groups.</p>
