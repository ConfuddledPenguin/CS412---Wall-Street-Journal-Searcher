	<p class="article-leader">Cetus Corp.'s embattled president and chief executive
officer, Robert Fildes, resigned under pressure yesterday,
two weeks after a Food and Drug Administration panel rebuffed
its cancer drug interleukin-2. In addition, more than 10% of
the company faces layoffs next month, according to Cetus.
   The hot-tempered Mr. Fildes, 52 years old, is being
succeeded by Cetus veterans who seem to have been selected to
neutralize his combative legacy and to woo FDA regulators
whose help Cetus needs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Ronald E. Cape, 56, the founder and chairman of Cetus who
is regarded as the company's scientific visionary, succeeds
Mr. Fildes as chief executive. Hollings Renton, 43, who
previously had risen from chief financial officer to chief
operating officer, now becomes president as well.</p>
<p>The biotechnology company, burdened by losses stemming
largely from its $120 million investment in IL-2, also said
it will reduce its 950-person work force by 100 people
beginning in September. Other belt-tightening measures are
expected, and Cetus is now actively seeking a deep-pocketed
partner to help fund development of IL-2 and other products.</p>
<p>Cetus, its morale at its lowest ebb ever, has been slapped
with at least two lawsuits by shareholders angry over the
IL-2 debacle. The company's stock, which had traded as high
as $22.50 during the past year, slid to $13 after the FDA
hearing and closed yesterday at $8.75, down 50 cents, in
national over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>Mr. Fildes, a 30 year-veteran of the pharmaceutical
industry, will remain a consultant to Cetus. "My sense of
priorities and the board of directors' priorities differed,"
he said, in an interview, but declined to identify the bone
of contention. Indeed, he said the strategy made public
yesterday by Cetus was one "I and my management team put
together." Though Mr. Fildes denied it, some industry
observers believe it was the former president's style, as
much as his substance, that was at issue.</p>
<p>When the FDA panel rejected Cetus's bid for IL-2 approval
on July 30, asking for more data, Mr. Fildes fired off a
defiant statement, labeling the move "a tragedy" for advanced
kidney cancer patients who have no other hope. Even analysts
such as Denise Gilbert of County NatWest Securities, who
strongly backs the product, winced at his "belligerent" stand
at a time when Cetus needed to send a message of conciliation
on complex scientific issues.</p>
<p>Sources close to the FDA, noting the panel had sent Cetus
back for better data analysis and spared it the stigma of a
formal negative vote against IL-2, said regulators were
affronted by the attack.</p>
<p>In an interview yesterday during his first afternoon as
president, Mr. Renton was the voice of conciliation and
subdued confidence about possibilities for Cetus's
turnaround. But he didn't try to minimize the depth of the
pit into which Cetus's morale and credibility has plunged.
Rather than blaming the FDA as his predecessor had done, he
stressed that "it's our job -- the company's job -- to
convince the FDA that this drug should be approved. We've got
to rebuild credibility. We've been damaged in everybody's
eyes."</p>
<p>Analysts generally greeted the changes announced yesterday
as strong but salutary medicine. But they questioned whether
they were enough to cure the problems at Cetus, based in
Emeryville, Calif.</p>
<p>Robert Kupor, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody & Co. in New
York, praised the new executive team as "more level, more
realistic, less bombastic and less emotional" than old
leadership. But, he said, "these actions dramatize the extent
of Cetus's problems without sufficiently correcting them."
Even with a 10% cut in expenditures, and even if the company
can summon enough data to get IL-2 approved by year end, Mr.
Kupor predicts Cetus will continue to post losses until 1993.</p>
<p>"This is positive for Cetus," Ms. Gilbert said, adding
that Mr. Fildes led Cetus in building up a huge
infrastructure, expecting IL-2 to be approved in 1990. "Now
there's a risk of having to do clinical trials over again,
and a need to reduce expenses. At some point, Bob {Fildes}
must have disagreed with that."</p>
<p>With Cetus's stock price now depressed, Ms. Gilbert fears
the company is in great danger of a takeover and a piecemeal
sell-off. "I think there's more value in the pieces of the
company than in Cetus as a whole," she said.</p>
<p>Large companies may be hungrily looking at Cetus's PCR
technology, which uses gene amplification to do everything
from diagnosing diseases to identifying criminals, she said.
Others may covet its generic chemotherapy drug business,
which generated $30 million in sales in the year ended June
30. There is also Cetus's research portfolio, including IL-2
and experimental drugs for a raft of cancers and infectious
diseases, she added.</p>
<p>As recently as last week, Mr. Fildes pluckily insisted on
the value of Cetus's business and the richness of its
research pipeline. "The question isn't whether Cetus becomes
profitable," he said, "but when." That's one theme Mr. Renton
continued to sound yesterday, contending Cetus will mine the
value in PCR, chemotherapy and IL-2, as well as in other
products such as the blood-cell growth factor M-CSF.</p>
<p>So far, Cetus still hasn't obtained a date for its meeting
with the FDA to seek clearer guidance on what it needs to do.
The FDA panel principally objected to the methods in Cetus's
study and its failure to document that IL-2 not only shrinks
kidney tumors, but actually prolongs patients' lives. Also,
because the drug is toxic and seems to help only 20% of
kidney cancer patients, the panel asked Cetus to pinpoint
which patients seem most likely to respond to treatment.
Scientists and analysts said this won't be easy.</p>
<p>"I think they'll have a harder time than we did,"
predicted Elliott Grossbard, director of clinical research
for Genentech Inc., which suffered a similar rebuff on its
first FDA hearing for the heart drug TPA. But Genentech was
able to bounce back quickly because "we had the data between
our hip pocket and our drawer," he recalled. "Cetus may not
have those studies," added Dr. Grossbard.</p>
<p>Mr. Kupor of Kidder Peabody said that there's a lesson for
the entire biotechnology industry in Cetus's rebuff by the
FDA: "Even though the FDA told you that you probably don't
need to do a placebo-controlled trial, you should probably do
them anyway." He said the surest and most convincing way to
get a drug approved is still to test a new drug against a
sugar pill.</p>
<p>Instead of doing such a study, Cetus had compared
IL-2-treated patients against a different study group
receiving the drug beta interferon. But the control group
turned out to be older and sicker than the IL-2 group, thus
invalidating any comparison, said FDA scientist Jay Siegel.</p>
<p>Judith Blakemore, Cetus vice president of biological
therapy development, insisted Cetus can statistically
"correct" for such flaws, salvage its study and get IL-2
approved without spending costly years of additional work to
redo its clinical trials.</p>
<p>"The FDA has never asked us to do a placebo-controlled
trial," she said. "You just can't do it in this disease. The
outcome would be too poor for the untreated group." For his
part, Mr. Renton says he hopes the existing study can be
preserved, but he hastened to add that the FDA will be the
judge, "and I'm not pre-empting anything the agency might
say."</p>
<p>Besides being Cetus's tattered flagship and last best hope
of profitability, the drug remains the only active agent for
patients with advanced kidney cancer -- a fact even FDA panel
members conceded. One intensely interested party is Eugene
Schonfeld, a patient who founded the National Kidney Cancer
Association. "We know it's no miracle cure," he said of IL-2.
"But it's our best shot."</p>
