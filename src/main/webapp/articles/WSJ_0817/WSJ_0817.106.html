	<p class="article-leader">EVENDALE, Ohio -- General Electric Co.'s aircraft engine
division will eliminate 1,500 jobs, mostly through attrition,
in response to cuts in military spending.
   GE Aircraft Engine said that even though its commercial
business is up significantly from a year earlier, the backlog
of orders "will not be enough" to offset the predicted cuts.
The backlog currently is about $20 billion, with orders for
delivery over the next 10 years, it said. The backlog two
years ago was $12.4 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A GE spokesman said that since 1987 the commercial part of
the aircraft engine business has absorbed about 5,000
employees from the military side. He said 47% of the aircraft
engine's $6.8 billion in revenue last year came from military
contracts. That percentage is expected to drop to 35% by
1992.</p>
<p>The cutbacks will be shared equally by the unit's Lynn,
Mass., and Evendale, Ohio, operations. Attrition will account
for about 1,000 jobs over the next 18 months, and the
remaining 500 people will be laid off. GE Aircraft Engine
employs 46,170 people in the U.S.</p>
<p>The layoffs reflect the cancellation of the Navy's P-7
anti-submarine attack aircraft, a reduction in the Air
Force's program for B-2 bombers, and a delayed production
schedule for the Navy's A-12 fighter plane, among other
cutbacks.</p>
<p>These are the first significant layoffs at the aircraft
engine division in response to defense spending cuts. Last
April, GE's aerospace division announced that it would
eliminate 4,200 jobs, farm out production of standard
component parts, and consolidate several plants.</p>
