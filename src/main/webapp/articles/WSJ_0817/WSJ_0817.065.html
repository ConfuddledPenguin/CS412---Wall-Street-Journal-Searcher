	<p class="article-leader">Scientists learned how a particular gene can sharply boost
the amount of fat circulating in the bloodstream, increasing
the risk of heart and other diseases.
   The new finding, made by transplanting the suspect human
gene to mice, suggests why many people have high blood levels
of triglycerides, the common fats that seep into the blood
stream from the diet and from the liver. The study, published
in this week's issue of Science, was conducted by researchers
at Rockefeller University in New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Triglycerides' role in causing disease is neither as
certain nor as well publicized as the link between high blood
cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease. But high
triglyceride levels -- hypertriglyceridemia -- have been
linked to coronary disease as well as diabetes, pancreatitis,
kidney failure, and alcoholism among other conditions. High
triglyceride levels are common among people who are obese and
sedentary.</p>
<p>Uncovering the genes that underlie high levels of fats and
cholesterol in the blood is expected to lead to new tests
that can pinpoint people with a genetic predisposition for
heart disease and other problems. The research, by revealing
the genetic defects involved, could also lead to new,
tailor-made treatments for the various disorders linked to
high blood fats.</p>
<p>Generally, doctors grow concerned when they find a
patient's triglyceride levels are above 250 milligrams of fat
per deciliter of blood. Some doctors consider levels above
150 milligrams to be unhealthy. About 10% of all men over the
age of 35 years have triglyceride levels above 250 milligrams
whereas such high levels are relatively uncommon in women.</p>
<p>In the new report, the researchers pinpoint a gene called
the C-III gene as a probable source of high triglyceride
levels. Normally, the C-III gene produces a protein that
wraps itself around globules of triglyceride fats in the
early stages of the body's processing of fats. The C-III
protein allows the fats to be grabbed by the watery part of
the blood stream for transport to other parts of the body.</p>
<p>High levels of the C-III protein occur in people with high
triglyceride levels but until now it hasn't been known
whether the excess protein was causing the
hypertriglyceridemia, explained molecular geneticist Jan
Breslow, who headed the research team.</p>
<p>To find out, Dr. Breslow and his colleagues took the human
C-III protein gene and implanted it into the germ cells of
mice. The result was two lines of so-called transgenic mice,
each with functioning copies of the human C-III gene.</p>
<p>One of the lines of mice happened to end up with 100
copies of the human C-III gene. These mice produced large
amounts of the C-III protein and had levels of triglycerides
in their blood stream on the order of 1,000 to 1,500
milligrams per deciliter of blood, or several hundred times
higher than normal mice.</p>
<p>The second line of transgenic mice had only one or two
copies of the human C-III gene. They had triglyceride levels
about double those of normal mice and thus more closely
resembled the human situation.</p>
<p>The results, the researchers said, show that overactivity
of the human C-III gene can lead to high triglyceride levels.
They speculated that some as yet-undiscovered mutation of the
gene, or the genetic elements that control it, leads to the
gene becoming overactive and producing excess C-III protein
that, in turn, raises triglyceride levels. Exactly how the
C-III protein raises triglyceride levels isn't yet known.</p>
