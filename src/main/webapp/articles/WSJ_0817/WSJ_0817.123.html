break into a Pentagon computer used by the office of the
Secretary of the Air Force.
   Investigators also searched 17 locations yesterday in New
York, Westchester County and Long Island, seizing computer
equipment and data storage devices. Five men, ranging in age
from 17 to 32, were arrested in the sweep and charged with
computer tampering and trespass, unauthorized entry and theft
of services. They were suspected of breaking into a computer
at the City University of Bellevue, Wash. Investigators said
the 14-year-old was also linked to the Bellevue intrusion.</p>
