	<p class="article-leader">A federal judge in Arizona approved a plan that allocates
money paid in the settlement of litigation stemming from
Washington Public Power Supply System's $2.25 billion bond
default in 1983.
   U.S. District Judge William Browning of Tucson approved an
allocation plan proposed by New York-based Chemical Bank and
plaintiffs' lawyers earlier this year. According to the plan,
$93.5 million will be put into a fund to be distributed by
Chemical Bank to all bondholders. The rest will be used for
attorney's fees and reimbursement of litigation expenses and
then distributed to plaintiffs who bought bonds before June
1983.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Plaintiffs who bought WPPSS bonds before June 1983 and
Chemical Bank, a unit of Chemical Banking Corp. and trustee
for the estimated 24,000 bondholders, reached approximately
$700 million in settlements with the defendants last year.
The defendants include WPPSS, several utilities in six states
in the Northwest, the Bonneville Power Administration, the
state of Washington and various professional firms.</p>
<p>Bondholders will be reimbursed based on their reported
losses and proportions will vary depending on when they
purchased the bonds. Actual losses will be reduced in many
cases by a deemed "salvage" value of 22 cents on the dollar
assigned to the bonds. The approved plan, which included
speculators who bought after the default, appears to offer
current holders at least nine cents on the dollar.</p>
