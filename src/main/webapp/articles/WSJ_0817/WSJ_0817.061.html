	<p class="article-leader">HAMPTON, Va. -- Once it was enough to get together 20 or
so relatives, feed them macaroni salad on a picnic table and
hope that Betty Ann's ex-husband didn't show up and ruin
everything.
   Now clans like the Colemans, who trace their roots to
mid-19th century Virginia, attend convention-style reunions,
lasting two or three days, complete with cruises, computer
print-outs of the family tree and personalized gee-gaws --
souvenir thermos bottles and pouches emblazoned with "The
Coleman Family Reunion, 1990, Hampton, Va." If an unruly ex
attends, it's not so obvious. These reunions are big.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The trend toward pricey, Love Boatish reunions is
particularly prevalent among black families like the
Colemans: middle-class, well-educated, proud of their
accomplishments, with lots of relatives eager to establish
family ties.</p>
<p>Businesses have been quick to respond. The Memphis Hilton
Hotel, for example, has scheduled 15 reunions this summer --
all for black families. "It's a good piece of business for
us," says Kitty Bronaugh, the hotel's director of catering.
Holiday Inn Hotels is focusing on black reunions as part of
its Family Programs marketing. And for the second year in a
row, Kraft General Foods is targeting black audiences with
its Kool-Aid brand "Family Reunion Sweepstakes," which
carries a grand prize of $20,000 toward reunion expenses.</p>
<p>The Coleman confab -- staged at the Radisson Hotel in
Hampton, Va. -- cost $45,000. To keep his family's expenses
under $2,500, Charles Coleman traveled with his wife,
daughter and grandchild by train for three days to Hampton
from Los Angeles.</p>
<p>For those among the 150 reunioneers who couldn't stay with
a relative, the hotel cost $65 a night. Then there was the
$125 registration and activity fee. This included a trip to
colonial Williamsburg, a junket to Busch Gardens, and a
cruise on the sleek Spirit of Norfolk, which went around the
harbor a few times while the Colemans chowed down on roast
beef, salmon and chicken breast "supreme." James Harris,
known as "Uncle Dick," a big man with a fixed grin and a
white yachting cap turned backward, asked one of the servers
about the cuisine: "Where's the fried chicken? You don't have
any chitterlings? This is not family reunion food," he says.</p>
<p>But no one seemed to mind the food, or the expense. For
67-year-old Charles Coleman, the journey was well-rewarded.
"This is a sight to behold," he declared after seeing his
relatives and home state for the first time since 1936. "This
is where it all began."</p>
<p>The Colemans have been holding biennial reunions since
1976. At the first, 20 family members gathered at the Houston
home of Percy and Sally Creuzot, who operate a chain of Texas
barbecue restaurants. The group began talking about Alex
Haley's book "Roots," tracing a legendary black family's
lineage. That triggered a discussion of their own family
heritage. When 84-year-old Aunt Gerri -- who has since died
-- started sharing a wealth of names and family history, they
decided it was time to take notes.</p>
<p>"We got down on the living room floor, rolled out some
white meat-wrapping paper and started writing," recalls
Gordon Coleman.</p>
<p>From that simple list has evolved a 25-yard-long computer
printed family tree, bearing about 250 names.</p>
<p>According to research by Coleman family members, their
ancestry began in 1832 in Halifax County, Va., when Gordon
Coleman, the son of a doctor, had an affair with Edmonia, one
of the family's slaves. Edmonia had been an African tribal
princess before her arrival in America, according to
government documents. Their child, Charles Spurgeon Coleman,
was born in 1858 and later, he and his wife, Elizabeth
Gaines, a freed slave, had 14 children. Thus the begatting
began in earnest.</p>
<p>Charles and Elizabeth's great-great-granddaughter, Grace
Harris, says that the recent interest in reunions and lineage
have changed attitudes toward family events once considered
scandalous or embarrassing. The fact that the Coleman family
started through an illegitimate childbirth was not discussed
during her childhood, recalls Ms. Harris, vice provost at
Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond.</p>
<p>"Now we see this is nothing to be ashamed of," she says.
"This is part of the whole black experience in America. We're
more open about saying this is part of our heritage."</p>
<p>At this reunion, family members honor that heritage. One
morning on the campus of Hampton University -- where freed
slaves were taught to read under a gigantic "Emancipation
Oak" tree that still stands -- the Colemans gather in a
circle and hold hands. They pray for deceased family members.
Mamie Bacote ends her prayer by reading aloud names of the 31
family members who graduated, between 1913 and 1985, from the
122-year-old historically black college. Twenty-seven
graduates are attending the reunion.</p>
<p>"We came back to Hampton to show the kids that this is
where many family members received an education," says Gordon
Coleman, a fourth generation descendant. "We want our kids to
have a sense of family and self-worth and to know who they
are."</p>
<p>That sense of self-worth is also the driving force behind
the nationwide Black Family Reunion, held annually by the
National Council of Negro Women. Dorothy Height, who heads
the group, says the extended black family has "historically
been our strength."</p>
<p>This reunion is "for those who can't afford their own,"
she says. Ms. Height points out that the purpose of the
reunion -- held in as many as six different cities each year
-- is "to make each other feel better about our society's
problems. The families that really need to be strengthened by
reunions may never be able to otherwise afford one." This
past weekend, 200,000 people gathered in Cincinnati to
discuss infant mortality and pre- and post-natal care, issues
that concern senior citizens and young fathers, as well as
education, careers, fitness, sports and beauty.</p>
<p>The Colemans have an elaborate reunion because "we are
fortunate enough to be able to," says Ms. Harris. But, she
adds, "We ask ourselves is just getting together enough" --
or should it be even fancier?</p>
<p>Three-year-old Jenna Johnson, Gordon and Edmonia's
great-great-great-granddaughter, has a more carefree attitude
toward the reunion. Dressed in a turquoise jumpsuit with
white barettes in her hair, she takes to the stage of the
cruise ship's main deck, and begins a solo performance
beneath flashing red and blue lights.</p>
<p>Her impromptu dance to the band's '60s medley of rock 'n'
roll and soul hits gets things started. Family members rise
from their seats and begin clapping and urging Jenna on.
Minutes later the dance floor has filled with nearly 70
family members -- including grandparents -- forming lines and
taking syncopated sliding steps to the right, then the left,
backward, forward, dipping their hips, spinning around and
ending with a kick.</p>
<p>"We're doing the Electric Slide," explains Teddy Bacote
III. "We like to do it when we get together for family
celebrations."</p>
