	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Erol Aksoy, managing director and principal
stockholder of Turkey's Iktisat Bank, paid $8 million for a
two-thirds interest in Park Avenue Bank, which caters to
wealthy individuals.
   The 43-year-old Mr. Aksoy, who also is chairman of Banque
Internationale de Commerce of Paris, plans to expand Park
Avenue Bank's operations to include financing trade.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Aksoy, a native of Istanbul, named Huseyin Unver, 41,
president of Park Avenue Bank. Mr. Unver has been Iktisat
Bank's representative here for the past year; prior to that,
he was a vice president and area manager responsible for
lending activity in several Middle East countries for Irving
Trust Co., now part of Bank of New York Co.</p>
<p>Park Avenue Bank, a private bank, has one branch and $15
million in assets. The bank has posted a loss of about
$600,000 so far this year, Mr. Aksoy said. Iktisat Bank, with
about $1 billion of assets, earned about $20 million in the
fiscal year ended June 30, he said.</p>
<p>Banking services to the wealthy is a very competitive
business and "New York is an expensive place," Mr. Aksoy
said. But in trade finance, a small bank can be more flexible
than the majors, Mr. Aksoy said, adding that requests for
letters of credit, which are principal trade financing
instruments, generally require a response in no more than 24
or 48 hours.</p>
