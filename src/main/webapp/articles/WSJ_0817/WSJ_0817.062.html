	<p class="article-leader">Literary types have always tended to take a pretty dim
view of science. Their attitudes range from Romantic contempt
-- Wordsworth's "We murder to dissect" -- to the snobbery of
Oxford dandies who used to refer to the subject as "Stinks."
The big gulf between the scientific community and the
humanities crowd, already noted by the
scientist-turned-novelist C.P. Snow in his famous "Two
Cultures" lecture in 1959, has not gotten any smaller.
   "A Literary Guide to Science" (Norton, 517 pages, $24.95)
is the latest ecumenical gesture on the part of science
toward the literary world. Its editor, Walter Gratzer, is a
researcher in biophysics at London University, who must also
have been doing rather a lot of bedtime reading over the
years. Here he has compiled more than 200 excerpts from
novels, memoirs, biographies, plays, reportage and verse,
plus a few complete short stories -- that represent
"incursions of science into literature." Each is preceded by
a pithy introduction. Although the selection is heavily
weighted toward the 20th century, he's not forgotten about
Swift, Pope, Byron, Flaubert and Samuel Butler. There is
almost no science fiction, which by and large is neither very
literary nor very scientific.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"A Literary Guide" is well-leavened with comedy, beginning
with an amusing account by James Thurber of his inability to
see absolutely anything through a microscope, to the immense
annoyance of his botany professor. Only after a year of
trying every conceivable adjustment of the instrument did he
finally manage to record an image of "a variegated
constellation of flecks, specks, and dots," which he took for
plant cells until his enraged instructor pointed out that
Thurber had drawn a reflection of his own eye.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the book we are treated to the spectacle of
Renaissance astronomer Tycho Brahe's tame elk imbibing too
much beer and falling fatally down some stairs; of
archbishops struggling with books on relativity theory (only
to be told by Einstein that "it is a purely scientific matter
and has nothing to do with religion"); and of Alexander
Graham Bell trying to get the dying President Garfield to
swallow a light bulb so that the assassin's bullet inside his
body could be located.</p>
<p>Otherworldly though scientists are reputed to be, here we
see them acting all too human, both in fact and in fiction.
They sabotage one another's experiments, steal credit for
discoveries, bicker about the order of authors' names on
scientific papers, develop neurotic obsessions with the Nobel
Prize, and get duped by psychics; one even pronounces nuclear
as "nucular," just like Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>A particularly unattractive physicist named Otto Warburg
accepts the status of "honorary Aryan" from the Nazis so that
he can remain in his Berlin laboratory even though he is half
Jewish. Asked by a journalist how he felt about the charge
that he was "a great scientist but a rotten human being,"
Warburg replied without a twinkle in his eye: "I am glad they
do not say the other way around."</p>
<p>More appealing is the rounded character portrait drawn of
that towering British physiologist J.B.S. Haldane -- who was
also a classics scholar, an ardent communist, a war hero and
a wag. We are given engaging views of the man from
biographies, memoirs, and from Aldous Huxley's novel "Antic
Hay," in which he was a character. Also included is a
surprisingly good short story by Haldane himself, a dryly
witty thriller about a conspiracy to extract gold from sea
water.</p>
<p>Pop topics are not scanted by "A Literary Guide." Those
who have forgotten about Kurt Vonnegut's "ice-nine" will find
a brief refresher from his "Cat's Cradle," plus another
account by Mr. Vonnegut of how the idea for this
ocean-congealing substance was first offered by a General
Electric scientist to H.G. Wells, who declined to make
fictional use of it. Wilhelm Reich's notorious orgone box,
which was supposed to do everything from healing wounds to
improving orgasms, gets sent up by that great puncturer of
science frauds, Martin Gardner.</p>
<p>Mr. Gratzer admits that he may have omitted worthy stuff
due to ignorance, but how did he come to ignore Joyce and
Nabokov? Did science touch their writing? It did. Nabokov's
memoirs include a marvelous account of his scientific
fascination with butterflies. Joyce devoted an entire episode
of "Ulysses" to the theme of science and coined the term
"quark" (used by physicists to denote the basic building
blocks of matter) in "Finnegans Wake."</p>
<p>There are sins of commission as well as omission: Many of
the excerpts Mr. Gratzer has included from forgotten
scientific novels are too brief to achieve critical mass, and
are written in less than delicious prose. But the average is
pushed up well above the purchase threshold by literary gems
from the likes of Primo Levi, Michael Frayn and John Updike,
who plainly knows as much about contemporary physics as he
does about Kierkegaard and funky sex. With items such as his
charming bit of doggerel about neutrinos streaming through
the bodies of lovers in Nepal, this guide ought to keep even
the most jaded literary aesthete amused.</p>
