	<p class="article-leader">EL PASO, Texas -- Farah Inc. said that William F. Farah
and Charles C. Wood were removed by shareholders from the
company's board.
   The apparel maker said that 75% of the shares represented
in a shareholders' meeting last Friday, and 55% of all shares
outstanding, voted to remove the two men.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Farah started the proxy battle over the membership of
the board by demanding that the other seven of the company's
nine board members be ousted. The company countered with a
proposal that Mr. Farah and Mr. Wood be removed.</p>
<p>The result marks the end of Mr. Farah's 53-year career at
the company founded by his parents. As reported in a page-one
story in The Wall Street Journal last week, Mr. Farah's
25-year reign as chief executive officer was tumultuous, as
the former chairman outlasted several potential successors
and survived an earlier ouster.</p>
<p>A company statement said, "Now that this special
shareholders' meeting is behind us, management and the board
can look to the future and concentrate on returning the
company to profitability."</p>
<p>Last week, the company projected it would report a
third-quarter loss in about two weeks. For the six months
ended April 30, Farah had a net loss of $2 million, or 32
cents a share, on sales of $59.9 million.</p>
