	<p class="article-leader">Failing hope that the standoff over Kuwait will be
resolved soon sent the over-the-counter market into another
tailspin yesterday.
   Traders say they have dumped whatever stock they can get
rid of so that they aren't exposed to any further short-term
price shocks. But institutional investors are edging toward
the door as well, traders say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There are institutions that say `I've held on so far
waiting to see what happens, and now I don't like what I'm
seeing,' " says William R. Rothe, head of OTC trading at
Alex. Brown & Sons. Mr. Rothe says those investors are now
beginning to sell.</p>
<p>But with traders unwilling to hold stock for long and the
market bare of buyers, any stock for sale exacerbates the
price slide.</p>
<p>That's what happened yesterday when the Nasdaq Composite
Index lost its grip in the afternoon and tumbled 9.18 points,
or 2.23%, to 402.27.</p>
<p>The New York Stock Exchange Composite Index fell about 2%.</p>
<p>Volume increased to 114.9 million shares from Wednesday's
light volume of 105.2 million shares.</p>
<p>OTC advancers trailed decliners, 586 to 1,398.</p>
<p>Traders say the market was unnerved by Iraq's call
yesterday afternoon for U.S. citizens in Kuwait to assemble,
fearing that the move is a step further toward making them
hostages.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a growing belief that a recession is either on
its way or under way is eroding the underlying support for
stock prices.</p>
<p>Reuters' ADR's topped the most-active list on volume of
nearly three million shares. The international news and
financial information services company dropped 6 3/8, or more
than 10%, to 51 3/8, after Wertheim Schroder removed the
stock from its recommended list. The Wertheim action
apparently arose from concerns that Reuters is having
problems with its new Dealing 2000-2 foreign exchange trading
system.</p>
<p>A Reuters' spokesman disputed reports that there are
problems with the system, however. The spokesman said results
of first-phase testing of the system are "on the whole quite
positive."</p>
<p>First Executive fell 9/16 to 1 13/16. The insurance
company voted to pay dividends on its preferred stock issues.
Those dividends were thrown into doubt Wednesday when it was
disclosed that the company was considering not making further
payments on its preferred stock in order to conserve cash. In
1989, First Executive paid out about $44 million in dividends
on its various classes of preferred stock.</p>
<p>Northeast Bancorp fell 5 1/4 points to 12 1/4 after the
Federal Reserve Board appeared to have nailed the coffin shut
on the bank's merger agreement with Bank of New York.
Wednesday, the Fed denied Bank of New York's petition to
acquire Northeast in the merger, which has been pending for
more than six years. The merger has been in jeopardy since
the two banks disagreed over Northeast's book value earlier
this year.</p>
<p>National Savings Bank of Albany tumbled 5 3/4 to 20 after
Trustco Bank said it has ended its efforts to buy National
Savings. Trustco said it made six offers for the bank, all of
which have been rejected. Trustco most recently offered 1.3
of its shares for each share of National Savings' stock.
Trustco ended unchanged at 28.</p>
<p>Lotus Development dove 2 1/4 to 17 after Goldman Sachs and
Kidder Peabody each cut their third-quarter earnings
estimates for the company.</p>
<p>The initial public offering of Marcam, an application
software company focused on the manufacturing industry, got a
warm welcome from Wall Street. The 1.26 million-share
offering, which was priced at $14 a share, began trading
yesterday at 15 and quickly rose to a high of 19 1/2. The
stock ended the day at 18 on volume of more than 1.5 million
shares.</p>
<p>Ohio Casualty gained 1/4 to 41 3/4 after announcing a
buy-back of an additional 1.5 million of its shares.</p>
<p>Florida-based First Home Federal Savings & Loan
Association added 7/8 to 18 7/8.</p>
<p>Huntington Bancshares said it has received all necessary
regulatory approvals for its acquisition of First Home
Federal.</p>
<p>Spire slid 3/8 to 3 after reporting Wednesday that its
second quarter profit fell to $12,800 from $130,000 a year
ago.</p>
<p>Emulex added 3/8 to 6 3/8 after reporting fiscal fourth
quarter net income of 10 cents a share, compared with 20
cents a year ago. The earnings were better than analysts had
expected, however.</p>
<p>DS Bancor rose 1/2 to 8 3/8. The company said a
Connecticut businessman holds a 7.2% stake in the bank and
intends to acquire more. DS Bancor said the investor's
objectives are compatible with those of the bank's board and
management.</p>
