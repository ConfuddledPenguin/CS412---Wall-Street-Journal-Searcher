	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Sears, Roebuck & Co., moving swiftly to cut
costs and improve retailing profits, plans to eliminate
thousands of jobs over the next several months.
   The retailing and financial services concern is understood
to be targeting administrative staff members at its
headquarters here as well as employees who perform
non-selling duties at its 850 U.S. stores. An individual
familiar with the plan said Sears hasn't determined yet
exactly how many of its 337,000 U.S. merchandising employees
will be fired.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the individual said Sears expects the job cuts to
result in annual savings of more than $100 million.</p>
<p>And that's apparently just the beginning as Chairman
Edward A. Brennan seeks to turn around the company's
faltering retailing business. In a management shakeup last
week, Mr. Brennan reassumed day-to-day control of the $31
billion-a-year merchandise group and vowed to cut costs.</p>
<p>A Sears spokesman said only that "Mr. Brennan is looking
at all opportunities to enhance revenues, improve margins and
reduce costs in all areas. This review is ongoing and no
final decisions have been made."</p>
<p>Sears executives are now understood to agree privately
with analysts that it must reduce expenses by at least $500
million annually to become competitive. That's because,
despite years of trimming costs, Sears's operating expenses
are still among the highest in retailing. Last year, those
expenses consumed 30 cents of every Sears retail sales
dollar, compared with 23 cents at K mart Corp. and 16 cents
at Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</p>
<p>"More than ever, they're questioning the way they did
things -- all the safety nets," said another individual
familiar with the situation. Sears "has a business system
that is more complicated than it has to be."</p>
<p>The first step involves cutting corporate overhead by
combining the company's corporate and merchandise group
headquarters staffs. By year end, the company expects to
eliminate overlapping jobs in such departments as personnel,
finance and planning, including some jobs at the officer
level, according to an individual familiar with the plan. The
600-member corporate staff previously oversaw both the core
merchandise group and Sears's financial service operations.
These include its Allstate insurance, Dean Witter brokerage
and Coldwell Banker real estate units.</p>
<p>Sears also intends to eliminate thousands of non-selling
jobs at its stores, mostly in 1991. Workers who perform such
duties as receiving and stocking merchandise and staffing
customer service and personnel offices now account for as
many as a third of a store's employees, the individual said.
At most department stores and other mass-merchandising
chains, non-selling employees make up less than 20% of a
store's work force.</p>
<p>Sears officials believe relying more on automation will
reduce the number of non-selling employees. The approach was
recommended by an outside consultant, the Garr Associates
unit of Deloitte & Touche, hired by Sears late last year.
Some of Sears's competitors such as crosstown rival
Montgomery Ward & Co. already are trimming their costs with
such a system.</p>
<p>People familiar with the situation, in fact, say Sears
broke off merger talks with Montgomery Ward because Sears
executives concluded they could cut costs on their own. As
reported earlier, Montgomery Ward's chief executive officer,
Bernard Brennan, approached Sears two months ago about
merging Ward into Sears, but he wanted to run the whole show.
The two Brennans are brothers.</p>
<p>Sears executives are understood to have recognized that
Bernard Brennan could have taken an ax to costs as he has at
Ward. But that would have been an admission of failure on
their part. Sears executives also are understood to have been
troubled by Ward's flat sales over the past several months.</p>
<p>The talks nevertheless forced Sears executives to
recognize that their company desperately needs to become more
efficient -- and fast. Ward had "at least a three-year head
start" in areas such as reducing non-selling expenses in its
stores, one of the individuals said.</p>
<p>Sears stock closed yesterday at $29.875, off 75 cents, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
