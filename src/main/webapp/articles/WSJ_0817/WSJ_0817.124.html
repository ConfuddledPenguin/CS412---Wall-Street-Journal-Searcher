	<p class="article-leader">Automatic Data Processing Inc. posted a 13% rise in
earnings for the fiscal fourth quarter, and projected a 10%
per-share earnings increase for fiscal 1991.
   In the quarter ended June 30, the computer services
company earned $59.7 million, or 81 cents a share, up from
$53 million, or 73 cents a share, a year ago. The growth was
fueled in part by a lower effective tax rate. Fourth-quarter
revenue was $425.8 million, up from $418.1 million last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the fiscal year, earnings were up 13% to $211.7
million, or $2.88 a share. Revenue was up 2% to $1.71
billion.</p>
<p>The company predicted only "modest" fiscal 1991 revenue
growth, in part because in the recent fiscal year it sold its
manufacturing and banking information services and Canadian
brokerage quotation services, as well as 81% of its Brazilian
business.</p>
<p>The company said that capital spending would remain at
about $100 million in fiscal 1991.</p>
