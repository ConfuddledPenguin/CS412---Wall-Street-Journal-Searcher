	<p class="article-leader">Western Union Corp. holders of its preferred shares
approved the company's plan to reclassify the preferred as
common, at a reconvened annual meeting in Upper Saddle River,
N.J.
   The reclassification, which required approval by holders
of at least two-thirds of the preferred, is a critical part
of the financial services and communications company's
recapitalization plan. Western Union has said it might have
to make a bankruptcy filing unless it can recapitalize.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company also is offering to swap new notes and common
shares for two issues of notes outstanding totaling $530
million. The issues are $500 million of 19.25% notes, of
which the company is seeking at least 95%, and $30 million of
16% notes, of which it is seeking at least 80%.</p>
<p>The exchange offer was extended to next Monday from last
Wednesday.</p>
