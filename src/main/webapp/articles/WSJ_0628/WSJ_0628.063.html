	<p class="article-leader">Charter Medical Corp., the troubled psychiatric and
general-hospital chain, named Michael Z. Kay, a hotel
developer, to head its hospital operations.
   Separately, Charter conceded that it had overcharged
Medicare by $900,000. The company said earlier this week that
federal regulators were investigating Charter concerning
possible fraud in its Medicare and Medicaid billings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The hiring of Mr. Kay, 50 years old, underscores Charter's
strategy of marketing its way to higher occupancy rates. Mr.
Kay fills a vacancy created in March when James D. Daher was
fired by Charter's chairman and president, William A.
Fickling, in the midst of a special audit of widespread
accounting irregularities throughout the hospital chain. Mr.
Daher maintained he was unfairly blamed for the problems,
although no reason was given for his dismissal.</p>
<p>Mr. Kay is currently president and chief operating officer
of the Portman Hotel Co. in Atlanta, a unit of closely held
Portman Cos.</p>
<p>As executive vice president of hospital operations, Mr.
Kay will be one of a triumvirate of key officers working
under Mr. Fickling, Charter's founder who led a $1.6 billion
leveraged buyout of the company in 1988.</p>
<p>Mr. Kay hasn't any background in health care. But both he
and Charter pointed to common ground between the hotel and
hospital businesses, particularly in the area of marketing.</p>
<p>"We're really excited because of his experience in the
operation of hotels and his tremendous marketing skills,"
said J. Rodney Laughlin, executive vice president of human
resources and development.</p>
<p>Charter and Mr. Kay said the executive will draw on his
skills of selling the company's services to groups as the
industry shifts from obtaining most of its patients from
individuals and doctor referral to obtaining them through
contracts with employers and other groups.</p>
<p>"Increasingly, hospitals get their business from group
sources such as insurance companies, managed-care companies
and from the government and military," said Mr. Kay, who
assumes his post July 1.</p>
<p>Mr. Kay was well known to Mr. Fickling because of advisory
services that Portman Hotel Co. has provided to hotels Mr.
Fickling's family controls, Mr. Kay said. Mr. Kay has also
served in the past few months as a marketing consultant to
Charter.</p>
<p>Mr. Laughlin said Charter is banking on Mr. Kay's skills
in implementing strategic plans "to help us respond to the
changing industry over the next three or four years."</p>
<p>Charter, which until recently enjoyed almost unbridled
growth, faces serious problems in servicing its debt as the
economic environment for psychiatric hospitals tightens and
insurers and employers push for shorter hospital stays and
other ways to reduce costs. For instance, while hospital
admissions rose 20%, patient days rose only 8% and expenses
soared 26% in the quarter ended March 31.</p>
<p>In addressing the Medicare probe, Charter said it
discovered certain hospital cost reports filed with Medicare
were incorrect and resulted in a request for "about $900,000"
in excessive reimbursement. It said that it reported the
matter to its Medicare agents and corrected its filings
accordingly.</p>
<p>The inspector general for investigations for the Health
Care Financing Administration in Atlanta said this week that
the agency is looking into allegations of possible Medicare
and Medicaid fraud related to reimbursements to Charter.</p>
<p>Charter also acknowledged that the Labor Department is
"continuing its review" of Charter's Employee Stock Ownership
Plan. The investigation was disclosed in an SEC filing
earlier this year but gained little publicity. Charter said
it believes the Labor Department investigation probe is "not
unusual" for ESOPs involved in leveraged buyouts and said it
doesn't believe that any improprieties exist in the ESOP.</p>
