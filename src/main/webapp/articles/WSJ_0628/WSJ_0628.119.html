	<p class="article-leader">MIAMI -- A violent dispute over a call for peaceful
dialogue among Cubans could shift the grounds of Washington's
policy toward Havana, dominated for decades by the concerns
of hard-line anti-Castro Cubans in the U.S.
   From a dilapidated mansion in Havana, the head of Cuba's
tiny human rights movement has called for debate among all
Cubans, including exiles and the government of Fidel Castro.
A dialogue is needed, says Gustavo Arcos, to find a way out
of the dead end at which Mr. Castro's communist revolution
has arrived.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In Miami, Armando Valladares, the U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva, himself a
former political prisoner in Cuba, toured the city's
Spanish-language radio stations to condemn Mr. Arcos's plea
as "treason."</p>
<p>But the U.S. State Department said Mr. Valladares, who is
an ambassador for a little more than six weeks a year, wasn't
speaking for the U.S. And U.S. diplomats in Havana reassured
Mr. Arcos of U.S. backing for his human rights efforts.</p>
<p>Exile organizations and personalities in Miami have rushed
to take sides. The Cuban American National Foundation, which
has the most influence in Washington, strongly backs Mr.
Valladares. It's the latest brouhaha to shake this
Cuban-exile capital. But, say many Cuban experts, it is much
more important than it seems.</p>
<p>The emergence of Mr. Arcos could lead to a change in
Washington's tough Cuban policy, dominated for years by the
voting power of nearly one million conservative Cubans, most
of them Republicans, in the key state of Florida.</p>
<p>At issue is whether the U.S. will back Cuba's internal
opposition, as it has done in Eastern Europe, Nicaragua and
Chile, in a bid to bring democracy to the island, or whether
U.S. policy will continue to be dominated by exile groups.
Mr. Valladares speaks for the exiles, who fear that after 30
years in the anti-Castro trenches they may be left out in the
cold if Cuba joins the march away from communism.</p>
<p>Havana's response has been mixed. First, a deputy foreign
minister called the dispute a power struggle between
traitors. But on Tuesday another top official said Cuba was
ready to talk with "dissidents and discontents" but not with
the Miami exiles. President Bush told Hispanic journalists in
Washington Tuesday that he would welcome exile talks with Mr.
Castro if the exile community so desired.</p>
<p>For a quarter century, U.S. policy has aimed to punish the
Castro regime rather than replace it, says Harvard
Cubanologist Jorge Dominguez. But the Castro government is
good at keeping dissent in check during hard times, he says,
and despite increasing hardships, the regime isn't about to
fade away.</p>
<p>"Democracies don't happen," says Mr. Dominguez. "They have
to be made."</p>
<p>Mr. Dominguez says the collapse of communist regimes in
Eastern Europe shows that dialogue between opposition and
government was a key factor in bringing about a democratic
transition everywhere but in Romania and Bulgaria. "Arcos's
strategy isn't crazy," says Mr. Dominguez. "It leads to
victory."</p>
<p>Carlos Alberto Montaner, an influential exile writer
living in Spain, says some Cuban exiles don't realize that
most of the gains in Eastern Europe were obtained through
negotiation. "The same thing could happen in Cuba," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Arcos's background makes him a potential mediator. He
has credentials as a revolutionary and courageous opponent of
the Castro government. Some exiles think he could play a key
role in a post-Castro transition. Now dismissed by Havana as
a traitor, the same epithet used by Mr. Valladares, Mr. Arcos
was Mr. Castro's companion-in-arms against dictator Fulgencio
Batista. After Mr. Castro's triumph, Mr. Arcos was ambassador
to Belgium but became disenchanted with the revolution and
was imprisoned, off and on, for 10 years.</p>
<p>Mr. Arcos's call for discussions has been backed by the
international Christian Democratic organization. The Latin
American Workers' Central, a 12 million-member labor
confederation aligned internationally with the Christian
Democratic movement, has asked Poland's Lech Walesa to
nominate Mr. Arcos for the Nobel Peace Prize. Other
parliamentary groups in Latin America and Europe are also
working for his nomination.</p>
<p>Lisandro Perez, a sociologist at Florida International
University, says Mr. Valladares's attacks on Mr. Arcos are
more understandable when another lesson from Eastern Europe
is drawn: exile communities had little to do with the
collapse of those regimes.</p>
<p>"Groups outside of Cuba have to be jealous," says Mr.
Perez. "In the sense that if Arcos's project is successful,
then it will exclude exile proponents of continuing Cuba's
isolation."</p>
<p>Emotions are running high. Recently in Miami, a bomb
heavily damaged a museum associated with exiles thought to
favor a dialogue with Mr. Castro. Also, radio station WQBA
fired a commentator and terminated a contract with two
researchers, all human rights advocates supporting Mr. Arcos.
The three say the station gave in to political pressure,
which the station strongly denies.</p>
<p>Mr. Perez warns that the bomb that damaged the museum
might be the first of many. "As a segment of the exile
community becomes more isolated, terrorism will increase in
Miami."</p>
