	<div class="article-body"><p>STEVEN BERKOWITZ, A CHICAGO BUSINESSMAN and art buff, now
spends his time and money helping talented ghetto children
graduate from graffiti to careers in the visual arts.</p>
<p>Three years ago, at age 45, Mr. Berkowitz sold his $60
million-a-year Christmas ornament business to Alco Standard.
He stayed on as chairman but, relieved of day-to-day chores,
gained time for what he calls his "passion for art." Already
a collector, he opened an art gallery. To work with children,
another passion, he created the Marwen Foundation (named for
his two daughters, Marcy and Wendy).</p>
<p>By March 1988, Marwen was ready to start its pilot program
of free after-school art classes in community centers around
Chicago. By September, the foundation had added internships
and, a year later, art scholarships. Advertising agencies
like Leo Burnett, Chicago museums, galleries and individual
artists took on Marwen interns for paid summer jobs. Nine
advanced students are now lined up for four-year,
college-level art schools.</p>
<p>Since starting, the foundation has worked with 2,900
children, ranging in age from five to 19, and the Marwen
annual budget has grown to $250,000 from $80,000. Mr.
Berkowitz originally picked up the whole tab but this year he
will pay half. The rest will come from Illinois and Chicago
government art organizations, and from private individual and
corporate donors.</p>
<p>The most visible creations of the young Marwen artists are
street murals in downtown Chicago. These came about when
Robert Wislow, chairman of U.S. Equities, a Chicago
developer, invited Mr. Berkowitz to have his charges decorate
construction-site fences at two projects -- and to earn $3.50
an hour while doing it. Mr. Wislow had sat on school boards
with Mr. Berkowitz; Marwen's executive director, Diane
Fitzgerald, had taught art to Mr. Wislow's daughter.</p>
<p>The first mural encloses the 85,000-square-foot site of
the Harold Washington Public Library, designed as the city's
main library. For this, the young artists filled 22
four-by-ten-foot panels  with scenes from Chicago life -- the
late Mayor Washington, basketball star Michael Jordan
stuffing a shot, etc. (When the library is finished, Diane
Fitzgerald hopes to auction the panels off.)</p>
<p>A second gallery decorates the fences guarding Union
Station in the Loop, which Mr. Wislow's firm is restoring.
For this project, Marwen's artists created outsized portraits
of Chicago celebrities -- among them, coach Mike Ditka of the
Chicago Bears, Mayor Richard Daley and TV star Oprah Winfrey.</p>
<p>Marwen's muralists have also just finished their first
permanent work, this one for Chicago's First National Bank.
The bank commissioned them to do a 95-foot panorama in the
city's Lincoln Park, site of the new branch bank that houses
it.</p>
<p>Developer Wislow, who now sits on the Marwen board, was
awed at the way the young artists tackled the jobs. "They
came on with teams to boss the work, budget costs, research
the material, create concepts and working drawings, and
finally finish  the project. This was not just handing a kid
a paintbrush."</p>
<p>Steven Berkowitz is naturally delighted that his
brainchild is now becoming a permanent part of the Chicago
scene. But he shys away from self-congratulations, recalling
instead a conversation with Ben Nunez, a Marwen student and
one of its scholarship candidates. When the philanthropist
told the young artist about Marwen's new planned college
scholarship program, Mr. Nunez replied politely but firmly:
"You owe it to us."</p>
