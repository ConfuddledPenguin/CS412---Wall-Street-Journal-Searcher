	<p class="article-leader">Mecca Leisure Group PLC, in an about-face from its initial
protest, said yesterday it will accept a #512 million ($890.6
million) bid for the company by the Rank Organisation PLC.
   Rank is a British communications and entertainment group.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mecca's board originally argued that the bid undervalued
the British bingo parlor, restaurants and resorts group.</p>
<p>However, in its statement yesterday, the company said it
recognized it would be unable to reduce its debt
significantly in the near term enough to make its recent
heavy investments pay off.</p>
<p>"Mecca would benefit from being part of a larger group,"
the company's statement said.</p>
<p>It also noted that its acceptance of the Rank offer
stemmed in part from the temporary disability of its chairman
and chief executive, Michael Guthrie. Mr. Guthrie, the
architect of Mecca's acquisition-led expansion, is recovering
from recent heart surgery.</p>
