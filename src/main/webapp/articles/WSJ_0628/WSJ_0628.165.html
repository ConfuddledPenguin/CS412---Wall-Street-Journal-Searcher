	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston called a proposal before the Massachusetts Legislature
for a 5% sales tax on services "a potential economic
disaster."
   Richard Syron, in an unusually strong comment by a Federal
Reserve president, said the tax would hurt the state's
competitive position in services and could drive business
away from Massachusetts -- and even result in lost tax
revenue.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The state Senate recently approved a proposed sales tax on
fees charged by mutual funds and other financial services,
accountants, lawyers and public relations firms, among
others, to help eliminate a budget deficit now estimated at
about $1 billion for the fiscal year ending Saturday; the
Senate bill also includes a small increase in the state
income tax. The state House, however, has passed a bill that
relies mostly on a larger increase in the state income tax.</p>
<p>The two legislative bodies haven't been able to resolve
their differences. Business groups are lobbying strongly
against expanding the sales tax, which would be among the
broadest on services in the nation, while labor groups are
lobbying for it and against increasing the income tax.</p>
<p>The state's budget deficit, and the legislature's deadlock
on a solution, have resulted in Massachusetts' having the
lowest-rated general obligation bonds in the nation, with a
Baa rating from Moody's Investors Service Inc.</p>
