	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- It was a night of Irish song and dinner
hosted by Raytheon Co. for Massachusetts lawmakers.
Executives who had risen from the missile division mingled
with men who had climbed through city wards and the committee
system of Congress.
   Former House Speaker Thomas O'Neill returned, alongside
his Boston College friend, James Dineen, a Raytheon
consultant and former lobbyist. In joking tribute, a jumbo
golf club -- bought by the company's marketing division --
was presented to the retired Speaker. "Adds an extra 25 yards
to my drives," says Mr. O'Neill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The May dinner at a posh Washington hotel followed months
of maneuvering in which the Massachusetts delegation added a
few yards to Raytheon's drives as well. Facing cuts in
Pentagon spending, the Lexington-based company tapped all the
power of the state's liberal lawmakers, protecting its
valuable defense contracts while buying time to pursue
overseas sales of its Hawk and Patriot surface-to-air
missiles.</p>
<p>The company preserved more than $40 million to continue
production of the Hawk -- even as a senior Pentagon official
acknowledged the Army already has more than it needs. Another
$248 million, cut by the Senate, was restored after two
liberal Massachusetts bulls -- House Rules Committee Chairman
Joseph Moakley, a Democrat, and Rep. Silvio Conte, the
ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee --
intervened to protect a plan for co-producing the Patriot
with Italy.</p>
<p>"Ought to be called the Conte Stallion," says the feisty
Republican.</p>
<p>From New England to Naples, the Italian Patriot is a study
in the pork-and-pasta politics of weapon choices in a
post-Cold War world. The program also paints a portrait of
liberals going to bat for the local defense contractor --
even as they call for Pentagon cuts.</p>
<p>The Raytheon missiles are defensive, but the aggressive
tactics underscore the stakes in this year's budget wars.
With fewer dollars, the bottom line is to outlast the
competition and hope for a larger share of what remains. Or
as a Raytheon executive bluntly described it: "Fewer eaters
of a smaller pie."</p>
<p>The company boasts a new, more diverse base nationally,
but arms sales are ever-more important to its Massachusetts
division. Only 16% of the workers there are nonmilitary,
compared with 29% in 1979. "They told me 3,200 people were
going to hit the streets if we didn't get the Hawk money,"
Rep. Moakley recalls. "I told them, `You fellas better learn
how to make mobile homes.'"</p>
<p>Foreign sales offer some reprieve, but in a tight world
market, the Patriot project banks on close ties between the
U.S. and Italy. "At no time in modern history has our strong
trans-Atlantic partnership been more crucial," said President
Bush in toasting Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti in
March. Watching at the black-tie dinner was Raytheon's
president, Dennis Picard.</p>
<p>When conceived under the Reagan administration, the
U.S.-Italian agreement was a model of burden-sharing and
technology transfer between friends. But as the Soviet threat
has diminished, the high costs have drawn criticism at home
and abroad. "It is of very limited value," says Rep. John
Murtha, chairman of the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee. "It is a program whose time has come -- and
gone."</p>
<p>Under the program, the U.S. must put up $500 million to
pay Raytheon for the most sophisticated radar and control
equipment, while an Italian consortium would be licensed to
co-produce Patriot launchers and 1,280 missiles. Rome would
gain a modern air defense and enhanced status in NATO. But it
must invest over $6 billion as part of the deal to procure
not only Patriot but also shorter-range, Italian-made air
defense systems to protect U.S. bases in Italy.</p>
<p>Like Washington these days, Rome may resort to its own
version of off-budget financing. "The means by which the
money will be found is not yet clear," says Giuseppe
Bedeschis, manager for the three Italian arms companies in
Consorzio Italmissile. Special legislation is required but
has yet to be presented to parliament, even as the Pentagon
has approved a $414 million contract for Raytheon to begin
work on the U.S. share of the program.</p>
<p>Part of the Pentagon's eagerness may be its own desire to
build a new Air Force base in southern Italy. Thousands of
Patriots are already deployed in Europe against a crumbling
Warsaw Pact. Even though the existing Patriots are mobile,
and could be shifted to confront threats from elsewhere,
officials defend the new production as needed and hint darkly
of the threat to Italy and NATO from Moammar Gadhafi across
the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Raytheon Chairman Thomas Phillips speaks too of a "threat
from Libya." But in Italy this analysis weakens. "Our main
threat is not Gadhafi," says Mr. Bedeschis. Libya, in fact,
was a large investor from 1976 to 1986 in Fiat S.p.A., whose
SNIA-BPD subsidiary is a partner in the Patriot program.
SNIA's own history is controversial because of its alleged
involvement in rocket projects financed by Iraq, and though
the company denies any wrongdoing, critics argue it has
contributed to the development of the very type of tactical
missiles the Patriot is meant to protect against.</p>
<p>Building the American missile is foremost a lesson in
systems engineering, says Mr. Bedeschis, but Italian defense
contractors hope for an edge too in breaking into the U.S.
and foreign markets. "Our armed forces are not a big enough
client for our weapons industry," explains Italian Sen. Luigi
Poli, a former Army chief-of-staff.</p>
<p>Selenia Industrie Elettroniche Associate S.p.A., another
partner in the consortium, needs work for its plant in
Naples, and will gain as well from the sale of its Spada
air-defense system to the government. Contacts with U.S.
lawmakers are limited, but Rep. Charles Wilson (D., Texas), a
member of the House Appropriations defense subcommittee, has
been entertained in Rome and Washington by executives of
Contraves Italiana S.p.A., whose Skyguard system would be
paired with Spada as part of the project.</p>
<p>For its part, Raytheon's stake could reach more than $1.2
billion, counting fees from the Italian share, but the timing
is crucial. The company is pursuing sales in the Mideast and
South Korea; the Italian program is crucial to keeping down
costs because it permits the company to keep its production
lines open.</p>
<p>Raytheon is a skilled and proven contractor but its
success has fostered a certain arrogance, as when executives
speak of the Massachusetts missile plant as a "national
treasure." Dark clouds illustrate a glossy Patriot brochure
released last year with the prediction that "Warsaw Pact air
forces will continue their qualitative growth well into the
next century." Today, without seeming to lose a step, comes a
multicolored map listing the spread of tactical missiles in
"Third World Nations."</p>
<p>"They are very hard-nosed," says Rep. Nicholas Mavroules
(D., Mass.) of Raytheon. His seat on the House Armed Services
Committee has made him a valued company ally -- and a
recipient of Raytheon speaking fees. "We're buying them time
for a transition period."</p>
<p>But three weeks after the May dinner -- and days after the
award of the Italian Patriot contract -- the mood and message
were confident at the company's annual meeting. "Raytheon is
not rushing to diversify," read the headline in the next
morning's Boston Globe.</p>
