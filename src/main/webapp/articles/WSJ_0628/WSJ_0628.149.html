	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Equimark Corp., which has seen the top three
executives at its main banking unit depart in recent months,
said it sees higher-than-expected losses in the second
quarter.
   The expected net loss of between $12 million and $17
million reflects an ill-fated acquisition attempt in Texas,
bad commercial and real estate loans and litigation-related
expenses, Equimark said. Equimark expects that loss despite
an anticipated one-time $14.2 million gain from the sale of
its credit-card business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1989's second quarter, Equimark earned $4 million, or
33 cents a share.</p>
<p>The forecast of wider losses comes amid speculation that
Equimark wants to clear its balance-sheet problems now to
attract buyers. But Equimark Chairman Alan S. Fellheimer said
there are no plans to sell the bank.</p>
<p>Chris Kotowski, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., said that
he had expected a loss of $6 million to $7 million and that
Equimark's consumer credit problems were worse than
anticipated.</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer said Equimark released its earnings
forecast at the request of the New York Stock Exchange. In
composite trading Monday, the stock plunged 15.3%, closing at
$6.25. Yesterday, the share price closed at $6.50, down 12.5
cents.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, Equimark had a loss of $15.4
million, compared with a profit of $5.7 million, or 50 cents
a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>In addition to a high provision for possible loan losses,
Equimark said it had losses in its unsuccessful effort to
acquire National Bancshares Corp. of San Antonio, Texas.</p>
<p>Equimark also incurred costs related to litigation, but
Mr. Fellheimer declined to indicate what the litigation
entailed.</p>
