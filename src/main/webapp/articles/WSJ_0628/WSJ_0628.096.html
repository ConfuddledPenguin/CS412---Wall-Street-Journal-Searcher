	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- The Canadian dollar is demonstrating again what
attractive interest rates can do for a shaky currency.
   Economists have been predicting a decline in the Canadian
dollar for more than a year, and with good reasons: The
country has a huge foreign debt. The government is running a
massive budget deficit. The trade balance is deteriorating.
And there is the persistent push for independence in Quebec,
which accounts for one-fourth of the population.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Canadian dollar, on the basis of its purchasing power,
"is overvalued about 8%," says Francis Scotland, managing
editor of International Bank Credit Analyst, a Montreal-based
forecaster of currency trends.</p>
<p>Traders were braced for a fall in the Canadian dollar,
after a constitutional plan to appease Quebec was killed over
the weekend. But the currency again defied predictions and
rose every day this week, closing in Toronto yesterday at
85.50 U.S. cents, up from 85.38 cents Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar's strength owes to a relentless fight
against inflation by the Canadian central bank. The Bank of
Canada has pushed short-term Canadian interest rates about 5
1/2 percentage points above U.S. rates, double the margin of
two years ago.</p>
<p>The interest spread is keeping the Canadian dollar firm,
says Jody Foulks, vice president, foreign exchange, at Harris
Trust & Savings Bank in Chicago. Mr. Scotland, the editor,
says Bank of Canada Governor John Crow has become the Western
world's fiercest inflation fighter.</p>
<p>Rates are so high that they make it very pricey to sell
the Canadian dollar short, betting the oft-predicted decline
will materialize soon. It costs about half a cent a month for
each Canadian dollar to run a short dollar position, says Rod
Fowler, foreign exchange director at the Bank of Montreal.</p>
<p>Some high rollers took the risk Friday, betting that the
constitutional agreement with Quebec would fail. But on
Monday, the Canadian dollar rose one-tenth of a U.S. cent.
This forced speculators to buy back Canadian dollars that
they had sold with borrowed funds in anticipation of a Monday
decline that would have produced profits on the difference.</p>
<p>With Canada's constitutional setback, traders "bought on
the rumor, sold on the news," says Richard Witten, vice
president and chief of foreign exchange trading at Goldman,
Sachs & Co. in New York. He says traders decided that the
news wasn't bad enough to do without the big interestrate
differential favoring the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>Aron Gampel, Bank of Nova Scotia economist, agrees that
"the Bank of Canada's anti-inflation stance continues to be a
beacon for foreign capital inflows" into Canada. But he says
the 5 1/2 percentage-point premium of Canadian rates over
U.S. rates "can't persist." He says the Canadian economy is
"close to stalling out, with serious strains in manufacturing
and construction."</p>
<p>The anti-inflation policy is beginning to show positive
results, as well. Most inflation indicators are moving in the
"right direction," Finance Minister Michael Wilson said in an
interview. But both Mr. Wilson and Gov. Crow remain concerned
about rising Canadian wage settlements and their damage to
Canada's competitive position in the U.S.</p>
<p>The U.S. and Canada trade more with each other than do any
other pair of countries, and the U.S. takes about
three-fourths of Canada's total exports. Canada's unit labor
costs -- the most commonly used measure of how competitive a
country is on production costs -- grew 6.9% in the 1989
fourth quarter. The growth of U.S. unit labor costs remained
close to 5% throughout last year.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson said the government won't relax its monetary
policy until inflationary pressures are clearly under
control. "We know that financial markets will be watching
very closely to see if we ease in a premature way," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson is concerned about the potential inflationary
effect of a planned 7% consumption tax that is to take effect
Jan. 1. While he doesn't expect the tax itself to boost the
consumer price index by more than 1.25 percentage points next
year, he is worried that it could trigger a new round of
inflationary wage settlements.</p>
<p>Canada's recent inflation record has been encouraging,
says Michael Gregory, Royal Bank of Canada economist. Its
consumer price index in May rose a seasonally adjusted 0.2%
from April, the same rate as in the U.S.</p>
<p>Mr. Gregory predicts that the downturn in inflation will
allow short-term Canadian interest rates to decline modestly
about late August or September. This retreat in turn would
trigger a drop in the Canadian dollar to about 82 U.S. cents,
he says.</p>
<p>Sylvain Leith, National Bank of Canada economist, says the
Bank of Canada "has set its sights on joining the ranks" of
strong-currency countries, such as West Germany and Japan.
But he says the Canadian dollar will remain shaky until the
Canadian government is able to reduce significantly its big
budget and trade deficits. Canada's current account deficit
in its balance of payments totaled a record 5.08 billion
Canadian dollars (US$4.33 billion) in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Canada has built up a foreign debt totaling C$229 billion,
or about 35% of its gross national product. "Not only must
Canada pay a large premium for attracting foreign capital,
but the value of its dollar can also be significantly
affected by the whims of foreign investors," Mr. Leith says.</p>
