	<p class="article-leader">KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- BHA Group Inc., a maker and supplier
of parts for air-pollution control equipment, said it hired
First Analysis Securities Corp., a Chicago-based investment
banking firm, to find ways to raise capital to finance its
continued growth.
   The company said it will consider alternatives such as a
joint venture, a private investment by a strategic partner,
or a public offering of its common stock. BHA said the
actions will help it take advantage of international
opportunities, including those in Eastern Europe, and provide
a financing source for certain projects.</p>
