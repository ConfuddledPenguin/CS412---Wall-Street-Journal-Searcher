	<p class="article-leader">Groupe Bruxelles Lambert S.A. said it agreed to sell a
19.5% stake in Cie. Internationale des Wagons-Lits & du
Tourisme S.A. to Societe Generale de Belgique S.A.
   GBL declined to specify the exact price but said it was
appreciably above Tuesday's closing price of 9,450 Belgian
francs ($277) for shares in Wagons-Lits, a Franco-Belgian
travel company. At Tuesday's market price, the stake's value
would total about 10 billion francs ($293 million).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale increases the chances that the French hotel giant
Accor S.A. will gain control of Wagons-Lits' chain of about
160 hotels, analysts said. Accor, in which Generale holds a
12.6% stake, has long expressed an interest in those hotels.</p>
<p>Generale won't have a free hand at Wagons-Lits. France's
state-owned Caisse des Depots & Consignations is the largest
shareholder in Wagons-Lits, with about 28%. Sodexho, a French
catering company, owns 18.6%, and Rolaco Holding S.A., an
Arab-owned investment firm, has 5.8%.</p>
<p>But Generale also acquired from GBL an option to acquire a
further 7.25% stake between now and July 1, 1991.</p>
