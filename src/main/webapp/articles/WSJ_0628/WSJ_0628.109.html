Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. signed a four-year contract
to supply Rover Group PLC of Britain with transmissions.
   Officials of New Venture Gear, the joint venture that
builds transmissions and parts, said the contract represents
the first work the venture received from outside the two auto
makers. The companies announced their intention to form a
venture last October.</p>
