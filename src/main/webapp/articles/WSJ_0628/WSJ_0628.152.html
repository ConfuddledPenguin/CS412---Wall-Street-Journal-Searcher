	<p class="article-leader">NORWALK, Conn. -- The Financial Accounting Standards Board
agreed to delay for a year the effective date of its pending
rule requiring companies to account for costs for retirement
benefits other than pensions.
   The FASB, the rule-making body for the accounting
profession, had indicated it would make the rule effective in
1992. The latest decision would require companies to adopt
the proposed rule in 1993, although some companies already
have begun to recognize the costs. (Technically, the rule
would cover companies with fiscal years that begin on or
after Dec. 15, 1992.)</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposal is of great concern to many companies because
it will require companies for the first time to reflect on
their books the present and future costs of benefits -- such
as medical and insurance coverage -- that employees will
receive after they retire. The total is huge, perhaps $400
billion by some estimates. And the prospect of incurring such
costs has prompted some companies to decline to provide
medical and insurance benefits for retirees.</p>
<p>The FASB has been circulating the "exposure draft" of the
proposal for comment, and hopes to issue a final rule before
yearend. The proposal has been in preparation for a decade.</p>
<p>FASB Chairman Dennis Beresford said the one-year extension
reflected concern in comments from more than 400 companies
and groups. "We received information that it would be hard to
accumulate information, and to train actuaries. It would be
fair to give companies one more year to do it in an orderly
fashion."</p>
<p>The group tentatively agreed to allow companies the option
of taking a one-time charge to income for benefits the
companies already are committed to pay. Companies that don't
choose that option could account for the accumulated costs
over a 20-year period, instead of the previously proposed 15
years. However, that language is subject to further review,
Mr. Beresford said.</p>
<p>The previous draft didn't permit the option of recognizing
the costs all at one time. About 90% of the comments on that
issue favored permitting one-time recognition, perhaps
indicating that many companies will take that option.</p>
<p>After recognizing previously accrued costs, companies
would take as an annual expense the estimated cost of
benefits to be earned in subsequent years.</p>
<p>Most companies previously haven't reflected in their books
non-pension retirement benefit costs. Amounts paid to
retirees in the current year are deductible, but amounts for
future years for both retirees and employees are subject to
more stringent rules for a tax deduction.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, some companies already have decided to take
the charge expected to be required to get it behind them.
Dallas-based LTV Corp. in late 1988 recorded a $2.26 billion
charge to cover its entire unfunded liability for such
benefits for current and retired employees.</p>
<p>Despite the proposed changes, the FASB proposal still
presents major difficulties for many companies. "I wonder if
FASB isn't running a little scared," said Bill Miner, an
actuary in Chicago for employee benefits consultant Wyatt Co.
"The rules are very onerous, particularly to rustbelt type
companies, those that have a large number of retirees."</p>
<p>Moreover, he said, many companies oppose the rule because
it will require assumptions that are difficult to make.
"Figuring out the rate of future medical cost increases is
one issue that looms out there," he said.</p>
