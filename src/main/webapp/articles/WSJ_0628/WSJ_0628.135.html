	<p class="article-leader">Salant Corp., New York, and its Denton Mills Inc.
subsidiary said they filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
   Ray Williams, chairman and chief executive of the apparel
company, said continued softness in the retail apparel market
"has made it impossible for us to satisfy our obligations to
our lenders on a timely basis."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Salant said it has arranged with CIT Group/Factoring for
as much as $100 million of secured financing for working
capital, subject to court approval.</p>
<p>Mr. Williams said the company "strongly believes" it will
be able to operate effectively while negotiating with
creditors. He said "production will not be restricted and
shipments to our customers will not be delayed."</p>
<p>This is the second time in recent years that Salant has
been in bankruptcy court proceedings. The company earlier
this month defaulted on a $10.8 million payment of bank debt
and warned that it might have to file a Chapter 11 petition.</p>
<p>Salant has $75 million of subordinated notes outstanding
as well as other debt.</p>
