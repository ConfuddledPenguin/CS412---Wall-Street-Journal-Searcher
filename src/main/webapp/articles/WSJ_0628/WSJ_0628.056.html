	<p class="article-leader">LONG BEACH, Calif. -- McDonnell Douglas Corp. said
Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines converted three options on
MD-88 twin-engine jets to firm orders, bringing the carrier's
order backlog to 30 of the planes from the St. Louis-based
aircraft maker.
   Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed, but industry
specialists said the average MD-80 series aircraft sells for
about $30 million. Delta, the largest operator of MD-88s, has
taken delivery of 62 of the planes to date.</p>
