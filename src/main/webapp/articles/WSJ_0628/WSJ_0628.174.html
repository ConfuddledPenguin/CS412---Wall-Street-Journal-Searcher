	<p class="article-leader">SEOUL -- South Korea's conglomerates have a problem: Most
Americans don't know a Sunkyong from a SsangYong or a
Samsung.
   So the largest South Korean companies, including the three
sound-alike companies above, are planning to spend some $10
million on image ads in U.S. business publications this year.
Although not a lot of money, the spending boost marks a
growing awareness among South Korean companies that they have
to build a distinctive corporate image in the U.S., their
most important overseas market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We find that most Western guys don't know the names of
the groups," says Oke Dal Hyuk of LGAD Inc., the advertising
affiliate of Lucky-Goldstar Group. "We are all at the first
stage." Only Hyundai Group, which has thousands of cars on
U.S. roads acting as rolling billboards, has significant name
awareness in the U.S.</p>
<p>Image advertising has become crucial to South Korean
companies because the U.S. prices of South Korean-made
products are quickly rising to match those of Japanese
imports. So South Korean companies must get consumers to
trust their brands the way they trust Japanese competitors'
names. "It is possible that foreigners might think that
Koreans are unreliable," says Lee Sang Chan of the public
relations and advertising department at SsangYong, a company
just beginning to sell a few of its products in the U.S.
under its own name. "Our goal is to plant a subconscious
image in the mind of the general public," he says.</p>
<p>Because the South Korean companies' No. 1 goal is to find
overseas business partners, most of the image advertising is
aimed at business executives, not consumers. They want
overseas executives to use South Korea as a source of supply,
and even more importantly, to sell advanced technology to
South Korean companies so they'll be better able to compete.</p>
<p>Making South Korean companies household names will be an
uphill battle. The companies tend to look alike because they
make many of the same things, each afraid to risk letting
another domestic company outflank them. Moreover, they tend
to run look-alike ads. A typical South Korean ad will mention
that the conglomerate is young, fast-growing, large and in
almost every business from petrochemicals and construction to
electronics and finance. And they usually use a bit of
nondescript but old-fashioned-looking artwork. "We don't have
much know-how in international marketing," says Oke of LGAD,
which recently spruced up its ad campaign for Lucky-Goldstar.</p>
<p>As the companies spend more, they are becoming more
sophisticated. Once content to let the in-house staff design
the ads, more South Korean conglomerates are seeking outside
help. Samsung, for example, used Bozell Inc. to produce its
new $3 million world-wide ad campaign that features
photographs of four people from around the world who have
benefited from Samsung products.</p>
<p>The best example of the improvement in South Korean ads is
Daewoo Group. Its first international campaign began in 1983,
the first for any South Korean company. "In terms of
advertising, the U.S. was a strange market for us," says Lee
Sung Bong, Daewoo's manager of international advertising and
public relations. So it sought the help of J.W. Thompson.</p>
<p>This year, Daewoo took a giant leap forward. It decided
that instead of spending a certain percentage more each year,
it would spend as much as it takes to reach 50% of its
intended audience in major business publications. As a
result, it's increasing spending on image ads in the U.S.
100% to $4.5 million.</p>
<p>Some South Korean companies aren't sure that image ads are
the way to go. Hyundai, which says it spent about $100
million on auto advertising last year, spends only $1.7
million telling people that "if you think we only make cars,
you're 21% correct." Samsung and Lucky-Goldstar, major
exporters of televisions and other electronic goods, each
spend about 5% of their $50 million overseas ad budgets on
corporate image ads.</p>
<p>But Richard Winger, a partner at Boston Consulting Group
in New York, says, "For Korean companies that have just come
into the mainstream, image advertising makes a lot of sense."</p>

<p>Cadillac Backs Conner</p>
<p>General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division is putting $3
million behind Dennis Conner's 1992 quest to defend the
America's Cup.</p>
<p>Cadillac in 1987 supported the New York Yacht Club's bid
for the prestigious cup but this time around decided to put
its name and technical support behind Mr. Conner, a four-time
America's Cup winner who was the skipper of Stars & Stripes,
which recaptured the cup from Australia three years ago.</p>
<p>"We want it to stay in the U.S.," said Peter Levin,
Cadillac's director of advertising. Cadillac chose to support
Mr. Conner because of his "focus, experience and ability to
successfully defend the cup," Mr. Levin said.</p>
<p>Cadillac's early announcement may encourage other sponsors
to pledge their support sooner rather than later, Mr. Conner
said. He intends to build three boats in preparation for the
1992 yacht races, which will require some $30 million in cash
and other types of support from about 400 companies. "We have
several other equally important commitments, but Cadillac is
the first to announce," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Conner said he's "optimistic the goals will be reached
in a timely manner" but acknowledges that raising money for
these types of events is difficult these days. "Believe me,
corporate America is watching their pennies," he said.
"Cadillac looked at me very closely. There are a lot of other
worthy marketing opportunities out there, and they put me
through the hoops," he said.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>SAATCHI BREAKAWAY: An agency formed by eight defectors
from Saatchi & Saatchi's London agency has won its first
account. The breakaway agency, Cowan Kemsley Taylor, will
handle the launch of Vanity Fair's U.K. edition next March.
Billings weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>GARTNER TALKS: Saatchi's negotiations with its Gartner
consulting group unit, which is trying to buy itself back,
have been thrown into turmoil. Executives close to Gartner
said that the consulting firm had been progressing with plans
for a management buy-back, but that Saatchi -- without
notifying Gartner -- began negotiating with a third party.
"Things were coming together, and without any warning, a
third party got involved. Saatchi told Gartner at the last
minute," one person close to the talks said. Gartner declined
to comment. A Saatchi spokesman wouldn't comment on the third
party but said, "It isn't correct to say anything has been
broken off. Let's hope we don't have long to wait."</p>
