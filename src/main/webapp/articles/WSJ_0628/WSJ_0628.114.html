	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, now firmly headed in a
conservative direction, covered a broad range of issues
during the 1989-90 term.
   The court will release one final list today of cases that
the justices agreed or refused to review when the new term
begins Oct. 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This is a summary of the major rulings of the high court's
latest term. The names of the cases and the votes are

may infringe on the legal rights of the original copyright
owners or their heirs for works produced before 1978.

and some other federal laws. (Golden State Transit Corp. vs.

higher fees in court-assigned cases was illegal price-fixing.

a law also requires a court hearing procedure. (Ohio vs.
Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 6-3)</p>

to die, states may require clear evidence that a patient in a

<p>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM</p>
<p>-- The First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom
doesn't mean a state must excuse individuals from complying
with valid criminal laws, such as those barring use of the

student religious groups the same access to scheduling and

under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations law. (Tafflin vs. Levitt, 9-0)</p>
<p>NEWS MEDIA</p>
<p>-- The news media aren't immune from libel lawsuits for
expressions of opinion and may face damage awards if such
statements are proved to be false. (Milkovich vs. Lorain
Journal Co., 7-2)</p>
<p>-- Detroit's two newspapers, owned by Knight-Ridder Inc.
and Gannett Co., were allowed to begin joint operations under
a federal law that sidesteps antitrust concerns. (Michigan
Citizens vs. Thornburgh, 4-4)</p>
<p>TAXATION</p>
<p>-- States must give retroactive tax refunds to taxpayers
who were required to pay a tax that the state should have

retroactive if the tax's invalidity is based on changes in
constitutional law. (American Trucking Associations vs.

challenge state taxes imposed on their U.S. subsidiaries, but

and to support political causes violates the First Amendment.
(Keller vs. State Bar of California, 9-0)</p>
<p>-- Federal appeals courts should defer broadly to judges'
decisions to fine lawyers for filing frivolous lawsuits, but
additional fines can't be added for frivolous appeals.
(Cooter & Gell vs. Hartmarx Corp., 8-1)</p>
<p>-- Fines for filing frivolous lawsuits may be imposed only
on individual lawyers, not on law firms. (Pavelic & LeFlore
vs. Marvel Entertainment Group, 8-1)</p>

federal environmental laws that private citizens provide 60
days' notice to companies and state and federal officials
before filing pollution lawsuits. (Hallstrom vs. Tillamook
