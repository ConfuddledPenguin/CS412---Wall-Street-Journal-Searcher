	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Hunt Manufacturing Co. said second-quarter
net income plunged 48% from a year ago, reflecting a general
softness in sales and special problems with a recent
acquisition.
   Second-quarter net fell to $2.5 million, or 15 cents a
share, from $4.8 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier. Sales
in the latest quarter rose 5.6% to about $50.7 million from
$48 million a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hunt, a maker and distributor of office products and art
and craft products, blamed most of the decline on a decrease
of about 10% in sales of several major product lines and on
major losses incurred by the Data Products business, acquired
last June.</p>
<p>In addition, a company official cited some start-up
problems in Hunt's new operation in Mexico that have hampered
performance.</p>
<p>Trading of Hunt shares was delayed yesterday morning while
the company disseminated the earnings news. Hunt shares
closed at $13.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, down $2.</p>
<p>For the latest six months, Hunt reported that net income
dropped 26% to $6.4 million, or 40 cents a share, from $8.7
million, or 54 cents, despite a 5.5% increase in revenue to
$100.1 million.</p>
<p>Hunt's chairman and chief executive officer, Ronald J.
Naples, said the magnitude of the earnings drop has "all but
dashed our previous expectation of another record earnings
year," unless the company can manage to make "a remarkable
recovery."</p>
<p>However, Mr. Naples expressed confidence that sales would
rebound in the second half as more customers replenish
inventories.</p>
