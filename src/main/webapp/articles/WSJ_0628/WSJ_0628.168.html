	<p class="article-leader">Lloyd's of London posted a 22% decline in pretax profit
for 1987, and executives said the giant insurer faces leaner
times ahead.
   The decline, to pretax earnings of #509.2 million ($887
million) from a record #650 million in 1986, reflected
tighter underwriting conditions, higher expenses and huge
catastrophe losses in 1987. In that year, a series of storms
-- including a hurricane that swept Britain and Western
Europe in October -- led to higher claims.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a result, underwriting profit for the year fell 45%, to
#411.7 million, from #744.5 million. In particular, Lloyd's
said underwriting profit in its nonmarine lines was
"disappointing" at #8.7 million, a drop from #218.3 million a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Lloyd's reports its results three years late to account
for the filing of claims and litigation. Profit from
underwriting and investment operations represents the
aggregate results of 401 syndicates back by 28,770 investors.</p>
<p>Murray Lawrence, chairman of the 302-year-old insurer,
said Lloyd's continuing exposure to U.S. asbestos, pollution
and other so-called "long-tailed" liability policies makes
the 1988 and 1989 accounts look even "less satisfactory" than
1987. Profit in 1988 may be lower than 1987, in part due to
such disasters as the explosion aboard the Occidental
Petroleum North Sea oil platform.</p>
