	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A pioneer of the country-fund craze in the
U.S. has found a new home.
   Michael Horsburgh, who co-headed Bear Stearns Cos.'
international equity department for nearly 10 years before
leaving last year, joined Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment
Management to launch and head its U.S. investment-fund
business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a senior managing director at Bear Stearns, Mr.
Horsburgh, 45 years old, was principally known for the
development of several funds that invested in securities of a
single country. His work helped open the field of country
funds to U.S. investors, leading to a frenzy among Wall
Street securities firms to launch investments in such exotic
markets as Malaysia and Turkey.</p>
<p>Unlike early country funds that had focused on markets in
countries that had been closed to U.S. investors, Mr.
Horsburgh developed funds -- such as First Australia Fund and
Scandinavia Fund -- that invested in nations already open for
investors. He also helped launch First Hungary Fund.</p>
<p>Mr. Horsburgh resigned from Bear Stearns last fall after
13 years at the big securities firm. But Bear Stearns
insiders say he was forced out after disagreements with top
Bear Stearns executives over the firm's international
investment strategy.</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Horsburgh said he left Bear Stearns
"completely friendly," adding that he felt it was "time for a
change."</p>
<p>Two Bear Stearns executives with global stock experience,
James Sheehan and Dennis Baum, succeeded Mr. Horsburgh in
heading the firm's international equity area.</p>
<p>At Barclays de Zoete Wedd Investment Management, a unit of
the investment banking and securities arm of British bank
Barclays PLC, Mr. Horsburgh will serve as managing director
and concentrate on launching an investment-fund business in
the U.S., largely for institutions. The unit currently
manages $35 billion for institutional investors in Europe,
Japan, Hong Kong, Australia and Canada.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Horsburgh conceded that the
competition will be stiff, but said there's room for growth.
"The use of international investments has certainly grown,
but it's still significantly lower for the average (U.S.)
institution than the typical institution in Europe," he said.</p>
<p>The move by Barclays is part of a broad strategy at
increasing its U.S. presence. Earlier this year, the firm
hired several former Drexel senior stock analysts and support
staff to beef up its international securities business in the
U.S. The hires included economist Richard Hoey, investment
strategist Abby Joseph Cohen and financial-services analyst
John Keefe.</p>
<p>Before joining Bear Stearns, Mr. Horsburgh was a partner
at Hoare, Govett Ltd., a London securities firm. He joined
Bear Stearns in 1976 as an institutional equity salesman and
was appointed co-head of the international equity department
in 1980.</p>
