	<p class="article-leader">Landmark Land Co.'s problems deepened when developer Barry
G. Hon terminated a previously announced agreement to buy one
of Landmark's California developments for $275 million.
   Landmark, of Carmel, Calif., declined to say why the
contract had been terminated; Mr. Hon couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plan had been the latest in a series of attempts by
Landmark to divest itself of real estate held by its Oak Tree
Savings Bank unit. Landmark has been under pressure to boost
Oak Tree's capital position to comply with increased capital
requirements of the Financial Institutions Reform and
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, or FIRREA.</p>
<p>Separately, Landmark said that the federal Office of
Thrift Supervision ruled that the Oak Tree thrift must boost
"general and specific reserves" by $47.5 million. The real
estate concern said that at least $30 million of these
reserves relate to Oak Tree's loans outstanding for the La
Quinta Hotel resort in Southern California.</p>
<p>Landmark said it was considering appealing the reserve
ruling; the company said it has obtained appraisals from two
national concerns that indicate the value of La Quinta
properties far exceeds Oak Tree's loan exposure. Nonetheless,
the OTS determination means that Oak Tree technically doesn't
meet all of the capital tests established by FIRREA and is
subject to "certain growth restrictions," according to
Landmark. These restrictions include the renewal or
acceptance of brokered deposits, without regulatory approval,
the company added.</p>
<p>Oak Tree, within 60 days, must also submit a plan to
regulatory agencies outlining how it will meet capital
requirements in the future, according to Landmark. In the
interim, Oak Tree's "status as a federally insured
institution remains unaffected," the company said.</p>
<p>Landmark last month said it had retained Salomon Brothers
Inc. to find "a strategic partner or asset purchaser" for
Landmark. In April, Landmark thought it had solved its
problems when it struck an initial agreement to sell to Mr.
Hon, a Southern California developer, all of its real estate
holdings for $967 million. But that plan unraveled after
federal regulators objected to provisions under which New
Orleans-based Oak Tree would have provided 75% of the
financing for the purchase. Regulators said the move would
have committed more than 20% of Oak Tree's assets to a single
borrower.</p>
<p>Landmark is a thinly traded real estate concern 28% owned
by its chairman, Gerald G. Barton, and 24% owned by Olympia &
York Developments Ltd., a Toronto conglomerate controlled by
the Reichmann brothers. In American Stock Exchange trading
yesterday, Landmark closed at $8.125, off 37.5 cents.</p>
