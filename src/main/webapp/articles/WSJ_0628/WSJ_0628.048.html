	<p class="article-leader">ASHLAND, Ky. -- Ashland Oil Inc. said its exploration unit
has completed the $107 million purchase of natural gas
properties from a unit of Occidental Petroleum Corp., New
York.
   Ashland said the acquisition includes about 550,000 acres
of natural gas producing and undeveloped properties in West
Virginia and Eastern Kentucky. Nearly 700 producing wells on
the properties average about 18 million cubic feet of natural
gas per day, the company said, adding that total proved
reserves could total 142 billion cubic feet.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The acquisition will more than double Ashland's existing
Appalachian acreage and increase the company's total natural
gas production by over 30%, the company said.</p>
