	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The U.S. Health and Human Services Department
improperly rejected thousands of heart-disease patients who
applied for disability benefits, a federal appeals court
ruled.
   The decision will require the department to reconsider the
applications of at least 150,000 New York state residents,
according to the New York Attorney General's office, which
brought the case. Although it applies only to New York
residents, the decision could be used to challenge the
department's policy in other states.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The court in Manhattan ruled that since 1980, the
department has unfairly relied on treadmill tests to
determine whether heart-disease patients were disabled.</p>
<p>"The treadmill test, while recommended by many medical
experts as a good diagnostic tool, results in misdiagnosis of
ischemic heart disease on more than one-third of the
occasions," the appeals court said. Ischemic heart disease,
caused by the narrowing of the arteries, is the most common
heart ailment. "An individual who doesn't show signs of heart
disease during the treadmill test may still be severely
disabled from ischemia," the court said.</p>
<p>HHS has great leeway in deciding how benefits are granted,
but it overstepped its authority in using only the treadmill
test to evaluate heart-disease patients, the court said.
Instead of solely relying on the treadmill test, the agency
should also consider doctors' evaluations, angiograph
readings and other tests that give a more complete picture of
whether the patient is disabled by the disease, the court
said.</p>
<p>"As a result of this decision, the federal government will
no longer be able to cruelly deny justly deserved benefits to
thousands of vulnerable disabled people," said New York
Attorney General Robert Abrams in a statement. "The policy
was just another example of the Reagan administration's
efforts to balance the budget on the backs of the weakest in
our society."</p>
<p>The decision will also require the U.S. to pick up the tab
for millions of dollars in disability benefits that New York
state has been paying, Mr. Abrams's office said. New York
estimates that it pays $8 million annually in such benefits,
and that the U.S. owes it $50 million for payments made since
1980.</p>
<p>Diogenes Kekatos, an assistant U.S. Attorney who
represented HHS, said no decision has been made on whether to
appeal the decision.</p>
<p>David Udell, an attorney with Legal Services for the
Elderly in New York, said the case was the first class-action
to challenge the agency's reliance on the treadmill test. He
said the decision is likely to be used in challenging the
agency's policy in other states as well.</p>
