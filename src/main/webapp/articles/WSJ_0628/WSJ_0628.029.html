	<p class="article-leader">ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- Rochester Community Savings Bank said
it expects earnings for its second half ending Nov. 30 to
exceed fiscal first-half profit of $9 million, or 65 cents a
share, noting that it expects "significant long-term earnings
growth" from the April purchase of a 19-branch mutual thrift
in central New Jersey.
   The savings bank also said it is benefiting from continued
growth in bank fees and service charges, stable mortgage
banking income, and the issuance of $125 million of auto
loan-backed securities.</p>
