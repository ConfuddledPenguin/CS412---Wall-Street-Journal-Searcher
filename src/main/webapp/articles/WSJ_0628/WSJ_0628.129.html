	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The remarkable growth of the nation's biggest
pension funds is concentrating stock ownership and voting
power in fewer and fewer hands.
   While much attention has been given to the rapid growth of
U.S. pension funds, including almost a tripling of their
assets in the 1980s alone, new statistics show the biggest of
the big funds have expanded even more significantly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Between 1985 and 1989, for example, assets of all pension
funds climbed to $2.47 trillion from $1.59 trillion, an
increase of 55%. During the same time, the 20 biggest
corporate and public employee pension funds grew to $621.76
billion from $336.53 billion, an 85% jump, according to
statistics compiled by the Columbia University Law School
Institutional Investor Project.</p>
<p>The accelerated growth among the giants of the pension
world means that the 20 biggest retirement funds now account
for more than 25% of all pension assets, including stocks,
bonds and other investments, up from slightly more than 21%
in 1985.</p>
<p>"We see a tremendous concentration of economic power in
the biggest institutional investors," says Carolyn Kay
Brancato, economist for the Columbia project. While
institutional investors number in the thousands, a
disproportionate share of their power "is being crystalized
in a small group" of the biggest funds, she says.</p>
<p>The growing clout of these pension giants is particularly
evident in the stock market and, especially, their holdings
of America's biggest companies. For example, the 20 biggest
pension funds owned 9.1% of International Business Machines
Corp. and 10.6% of General Motors Corp. at the end of 1989.</p>
<p>And the rapid growth of the biggest pension funds is
putting more power in the hands of those institutional
investors most likely to try to use it.</p>
<p>Last year, institutional holders showed their clout by
managing to defeat anti-takeover proxy proposals made by
Honeywell Inc. management. And Texaco Inc. last year agreed
to name a director from candidates submitted by the $54
billion California Public Employees Retirement System.</p>
<p>The biggest institutional shareholders say their growing
size shouldn't be viewed as a threat to companies'
managements. "There is more concentration, but there is more
sophistication" among the biggest shareholders, says Roland
M. Machold, director of the New Jersey Division of
Investment, which oversees $24.5 billion in state pension
money. "That is an opportunity to work together," he says.</p>
<p>Still, this growing concentration of stock ownership in a
few hands has the potential to shift the balance of power
between shareholders and corporate managements.</p>
<p>"The model of {publicly traded} companies as owned by
thousands of anonymous stockholders simply isn't true," says
Bernard Black, a former Securities and Exchange Commission
aide who now is a Columbia law professor. "There are a
limited number of large shareholders, and they know each
other."</p>
<p>But even the biggest institutional investors don't move in
unison. GM sparked ire from some institutional holders when
it included a measure to increase pension benefits sharply
for Chairman Roger Smith, who is to retire Aug. 1, and other
GM executives. While New York state's public employee pension
system voted against the GM proposal, the California fund
voted to approve it.</p>
<p>The fastest-growing retirement systems are those for state
and local public employees. These public funds have taken the
lead in challenging corporate managements in proxy votes and
pressing their own suggestions about the way companies should
be run. State systems such as Wisconsin's $20.03 billion fund
are doubling in size every five years, and the California
public employees fund is expected to reach $1 trillion by the
year 2014.</p>
<p>Public funds account for 13 of the 20 largest pension
funds, according to the most recent tally by Pensions and
Investments, a trade publication.</p>
<p>In addition to outpacing the asset growth of corporate
funds, public funds are allocating much of their new wealth
to stocks, reducing their traditional reliance on more
conservative bond holdings. As late as 1968, public funds in
California and 15 other states didn't hold any stocks in
their portfolios. In 1970, according to New York Stock
Exchange statistics, stocks equaled less than 17% of the
assets of state and local pension funds. But by 1988, their
stockholdings more than doubled to 37% of their portfolios.
Today, California's two giant state funds hold a total of $38
billion in stocks.</p>
<p>Corporate pension funds, meanwhile, cut their portfolio
allocations to stocks to 45% in 1988 from 60% in 1970,
according to the Big Board. Corporate plans remain much
bigger stock investors in dollar terms, however, and held
shares equal to 20.8% of the exchange's total capitalization
at the end of 1988, compared with 9.1% for public plans.</p>
<p>With fewer conflicts of interest than other institutional
investors, public pension funds -- as well as mutual funds,
the second-biggest accumulators of stock in the 1980s --
"will be more likely to advance their own proposals and
oppose management proposals," Mr. Black, the Columbia
professor, says.</p>
<p>Pension fund officials often argue that their ability to
gang up on companies is greatly exaggerated. Their forces are
divided, because corporate pension funds play almost no role
in anti-management fights, and many, if not most, public
pension funds have neither the stomach nor the resources to
enter proxy frays, fund officials say.</p>
<p>New York State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, who controls
the state's largest pension fund, says that "even though
there appears to be a lot of power on the institutional side,
there is a lot of countervailing power" for companies'
managements in the form of state anti-takeover laws, the
advantages that the SEC proxy voting system gives managers
and in poison-pill and other corporate defenses.</p>
<p>Yet another constraint is the maze of SEC regulations that
prevent a pension fund from acquiring more than 5% of a
company's stock without incurring complicated disclosure
requirements. Still other rules effectively ban funds from
discussing proxy matters with more than nine fellow
shareholders unless they want to begin a formal
proxy-solicitation process.</p>
<p>But pension funds are pushing proposals to get the SEC to
overhaul its rules for proxy contests, and the agency says it
is considering changes.</p>
