	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co., citing
lower equipment sales and the costly startup of its new
credit card, said second-quarter earnings will likely fall
below those in the year-earlier quarter.
   AT&T's announcement knocked the wind out of the company's
stock and led analysts to lower their estimates for the
second quarter, as well as full-year forecasts for 1990 and
1991. Many also downgraded AT&T stock to "hold" from "buy."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
AT&T fell $2.125 to $39.125 on volume of 11.5 million shares,
making the stock the most-active Big Board issue yesterday.
AT&T's normal daily volume is 1.8 million shares. The decline
also lopped about $2.34 billion off AT&T's market
capitalization, given the company's nearly 1.1 billion shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>While AT&T said second-quarter earnings will probably be
lower than the $699 million, or 65 cents a share, in the 1989
period, the company still expects 1990 earnings to surpass
1989's profit of $2.7 billion, or $2.50 a share.</p>
<p>"We expect to have a record year this year in terms of
earnings and our objective continues to be a mininum 10% to
12% {annual} increase in earnings," said Morris Tanenbaum,
AT&T vice chairman and chief financial officer. While "we
think it will be difficult to hit our objective, we will make
every effort to do that."</p>
<p>AT&T's profit problem underscores the magnitude of
Chairman Robert E. Allen's high-wire challenge at AT&T. His
campaign to slash costs, refine AT&T's management structure
and protect the company's "golden-goose" long-distance
business has been highly successful. AT&T had record profit
in 1989, and the company recently boosted its dividend for
the first time since the court-ordered breakup in January
1984.</p>
<p>However, problems in AT&T's office phone systems and
computer businesses continue to drain profits. Also,
potentially lucrative ventures such as credit cards and
international businesses are demanding huge start-up funds
and are years away from delivering the kinds of profits that
can offset losses elsewhere.</p>
<p>Analysts were quick to point out that AT&T's problem in
the second quarter doesn't portend a calamity. "This is far,
far, far from being any kind of a catastrophe," said Jack B.
Grubman, telecommunications analyst at PaineWebber Inc. "If
there's a silver lining in this news it is that the core
business, long-distance, is healthy as ever. . . . And while
the new credit card will cause short-term blips in earnings,
AT&T has been signing up a boat load more customers than it
thought it would by now, meaning it will reach critical mass
to make money faster."</p>
<p>AT&T has signed up more than two million cardholders --
even after rejecting 40% of all applicants, notes Mr.
Grubman. The company recently said purchases with its
Universal MasterCard and Visa cards totaled more than $100
million, excluding revenue from phone call charges.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Mr. Grubman lowered his per-share estimates
for the second quarter to 58 cents from 72 cents, and to
$2.65 for 1990 from $2.90. For 1991, he now expects AT&T to
earn $2.95 a share instead of $3.40. Mr. Grubman was one of
several analysts who cut his recommendation to a "hold" from
a "buy."</p>
<p>"Investors have been paying a hefty premium {based on}
AT&T's long-distance business," said Robert B. Morris III, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs. The announcement "refocuses the
market's attention on AT&T's exposure to product life-cycles
and the economy {in addition to being} just a long-distance
company."</p>
<p>Mr. Morris, who has had AT&T stock as a "hold" for the
past six months, lowered his second-quarter per-share
estimate to 60 cents from 72 cents, and cut his forecast for
1990 to $2.60 a share from $2.80. For 1991, he expects AT&T
to earn $3 a share, down from $3.15 a share.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, AT&T's revenue from product sales,
including telephone and computer equipment, increased 1.2% to
$2.72 billion. In 1989, equipment sales rose 1.7% to $11.5
billion, while profit margins flattened out and costs rose
6.1% to $6.97 billion.</p>
<p>These numbers have led analysts to speculate that AT&T
will have to dump some of its equipment businesses. Many have
long held AT&T's communications equipment operations, which
include office phone switches and computers, to be
expendable. Mr. Grubman estimates that AT&T's losses are $400
million to $500 million a year on business systems and $300
million on computers.</p>
<p>"The equipment business basically stinks," said Mr.
Grubman. "AT&T should take a look at exiting some of these
businesses."</p>
<p>"A driving factor in PBX {office phone switch} sales is
company relocations," said George Kelly, an analyst at Morgan
Stanley & Co. "When a company moves it usually buys a new
phone system, and with the real estate market down . . . this
is affecting AT&T's sales."</p>
<p>Mr. Tanenbaum said there are "absolutely no plans to exit
or sell" any of AT&T's equipment businesses. And Mr. Allen
said: "Be assured, the anticipated lower second-quarter
earnings will not lead to any short term `fixes' that will
handicap the business over the long haul."</p>
