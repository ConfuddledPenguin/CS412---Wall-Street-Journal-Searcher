	<p class="article-leader">LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Vencor Inc. said it expects
second-quarter net income to be about 10 cents a share.
Year-earlier net was two cents a share.
   Vencor said the increase reflects improved results at two
hospitals recently acquired by the company. The company,
which specializes in providing long-term hospital care for
patients who suffer from catastrophic illness, expects to
release results in late July.</p>
