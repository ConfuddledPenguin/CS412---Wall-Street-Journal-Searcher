	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Bally Manufacturing Corp. said it is extending
its offer to exchange common shares for its 13 5/8%
subordinated debentures due Jan. 2, 2001, until 5 p.m. EDT
July 11.
   The offer by the gambling and health-club concern
originally was slated to expire yesterday, at which time
holders had tendered only about $20 million of the
four-year-old $135 million issue of junk bonds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bally is trying to retire its junk bond issue at a
discount to the original price. Each holder of debentures
accepting the offer would receive 57 shares of Bally common
stock for each $1,000 principal amount of debenture.</p>
