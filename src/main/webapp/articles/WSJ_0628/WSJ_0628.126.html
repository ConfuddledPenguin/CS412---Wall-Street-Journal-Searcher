	<p class="article-leader">Fluor Corp. and Parsons Corp. said they received contracts
for chunks of Saudi Arabia's massive project to overhaul and
expand its oil and gas production facilities. Analysts valued
each of the contracts at between $2 billion and $5 billion.
   Aramco, the state-owned Saudi Arabian company, is boosting
its energy-producing capacity at a time when world-wide
demand is on the rise. The project, which oil-industry
experts say could cost $40 billion over nine years, has been
divided into three parts, by geographic regions of the
country.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fluor, based in Irvine, Calif., said its Fluor Daniel Inc.
unit will act as overall program manager in the northern
region of Saudi Arabia. It will expand and de-mothball
Aramco's production facilities there, including its oil and
gas plants, pipelines and offshore drilling platforms.</p>
<p>Parsons, a closely held Pasadena, Calif., engineering and
construction concern, confirmed that it had received a
similar contract naming it program manager of the southern
region. A Parsons spokeswoman said she didn't believe that a
central-region manager had yet been named. Aramco officials
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Les McCraw, Fluor vice chairman and chief executive
officer, said, "In a prospective way, it's the most
significant contract we've received in the last decade." He
wouldn't disclose the contract value, however, saying it
would be "premature to speculate on how the program will
unfold. Over the next several months, we will be defining
costs and determining schedules."</p>
<p>Parsons also declined to put a value on its contract or
discuss other details of the award. The company's spokeswoman
said it was equivalent in nature to the Fluor award, however,
and will include both engineering and construction work.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Fluor's stock rose 87.5 cents to close at $46 a share on
volume of 621,700 shares.</p>
<p>Fluor said it will start the project next month, working
primarily out of its offices in Houston and in Al Khobar,
Saudi Arabia. It will staff the effort with engineers already
on the payroll, Mr. McCraw said.</p>
<p>Fluor may be renovating some production facilities it
helped build in Saudi Arabia during the oil boom of the 1970s
and early 1980s, he added. Unlike some other American
engineering and construction companies that left the Middle
East when oil prices fell, "we stayed and did other things,"
he said.</p>
<p>Analysts expect other U.S. contractors to be involved in
the project, the largest by Aramco in nearly a decade. "The
last time we were looking at a multibillion contract from
Saudi Arabia was probably 1982," said Herbert Hart, an
analyst at S.G. Warburg & Co. in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Companies he and other analysts mention as possibly vying
for some of the new work include San Francisco-based Bechtel
Group Inc.; the M.W. Kellogg Co. unit of Dresser Industries
Inc., Dallas; Foster Wheeler Corp., Clinton, N.J.; and the
Lummus unit of Asea Brown Boveri, a Swiss/Swedish industrial
concern.</p>
<p>Bechtel declined to comment. None of the other companies
could immediately be reached.</p>
<p>Mr. McCraw said he wouldn't be surprised to see several
other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries "do something similar, maybe not of the same scope
and breadth, but similar. There is a desire for more
production capacity, driven by the perception of energy
growth over the decade of the 1990s."</p>
<p>Fluor's five-year contract includes options for four years
of additional work on the project. The extent of the program
is still being defined, Mr. McCraw said, but "we will be
involved in planning, analysis and direct execution of the
engineering effort" as well as defining the role of
subcontractors.</p>
<p>Mr. McCraw said that because Aramco intends to release the
work over several years, the financial impact it will have on
"any single quarter or year for us is still uncertain. We
intend to be conservative in reporting this work in our
backlog." He added, however, that Saudi Arabia will pay Fluor
in dollars, rather than in barrels of oil, as analysts claim
it has paid other U.S. companies in the past.</p>
