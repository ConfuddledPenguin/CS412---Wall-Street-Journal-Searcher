	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stocks rallied on improved volume Wednesday, helped
by technical and fundamental factors, traders said.
   The Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 740.98
points at 32312.75. The index gained 447.58 points Tuesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the Nikkei index fell
104.91 points to 32207.84.</p>
<p>Wednesday's volume on the first section was estimated at
600 million shares, up from 396 million shares Tuesday.</p>
<p>Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues 751 to 214,
while 156 issues remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues in the first
section advanced 39.05 points, or 1.68%, at 2362.40.</p>
<p>The second section index rose 44.19 points, or 1.07%, to
close at 4155.77. Volume in the section was estimated at 29
million shares, up from 18.3 million shares Tuesday.</p>
<p>Trading was helped by a shift in sentiment that the U.S.
could lower interest rates, noted Kevin Haag, a trader in
overseas operations at Nomura Securities Co.</p>
<p>Comments Tuesday by President Bush that he'd accept a tax
hike as part of a deficit reduction plan could cause a change
in the fiscal situation, putting less demand on the credit
markets, Mr. Haag said.</p>
<p>"As a result, we could see lower yields in the {U.S.},
which means an opportunity for lower yields in Japan, which
is encouraging for equities," Mr. Haag said.</p>
<p>Some stock market participants said they weren't overly
optimistic that the U.S., followed by Japan, would see lower
rates. "If everyone was so sure that rates were going to
fall, the Dow {Jones Industrial Average} wouldn't be having
so much trouble," one trader noted.</p>
<p>And while the Nikkei index managed to rise more than 2%,
bond prices and the yen-dollar rate weren't so striking, they
pointed out.</p>
<p>Also, volume, though improved from its lower levels of the
past few weeks, wasn't strong enough to imply that buyers had
returned in full force, traders noted.</p>
<p>However, the reappearance of institutional buying
Wednesday was a bullish factor that shouldn't be underplayed,
traders added.</p>
<p>While lower-rate hopes buoyed market sentiment throughout
the day, the actual rise in stock prices was largely
technically driven, traders said.</p>
<p>Wednesday was the first day of trading for July
settlement, and investment trust funds began placing fresh
cash on the market, they noted.</p>
<p>Moreover, arbitragers were seen buying steadily all
through the day, as futures continued to trade at a premium
to the cash indexes.</p>
<p>Buying was particularly heavy on high-priced, blue-chip
issues. One trader at a leading U.K. securities firm
speculated that talk among the Big Four domestic brokerage
houses that the market had become too unfocused, with too
wide of a range on interest in small shares, resulted in more
directed buying.</p>
<p>That the Big Four were discussing such strategy "may well
be," Nomura's Mr. Haag said, but Wednesday's rally wasn't
dealer-led. Instead, institutional buyers were reacting to
technical buy-signals, he said.</p>
<p>NEC was a prime reflection of institutional support, Mr.
Haag said. The stock rose 120 yen to 2,020 yen (78 cents to
$13.06).</p>
<p>Kyocera continued its recent strength with a 300 yen gain,
to 8,630 yen. Fanuc gained 310 yen to 7,360 yen. Sony,
meanwhile, rose 360 yen to 8,870 yen, and TDK rose 270 yen to
7,320 yen.</p>
<p>Hitachi rose 50 yen to 1,550 yen, Matsushita Electric
Industrial gained 90 yen to 2,150 yen and Toshiba added 40
yen to 1,110 yen.</p>
<p>Fuji Photo Film soared 230 yen to 4,620 yen, and Advantest
rose 220 yen to 6,290 yen.</p>
<p>London shares finished a stagnant session lower, weakened
by technical factors ahead of the expiration of the Financial
Times-Stock Exchange 100 Stock-Index future contract.</p>
<p>Dealers said the broad-based index slipped back when the
premium on the June futures contracted to near parity with
the cash market. There are technical pressures to get the
futures premium down in order to smoothly unwind basket
trades that could dump a large amount of equities into the
market come the Friday contract expiration, some analysts
said.</p>
<p>"As the premium in the futures collapsed, the cash market
decided to tumble in line with it," said one director of
equities.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index closed
down 26.3 points at 2373.5, a bit better than the 2369.1
intraday low. The market was at its best in the first 10
minutes of trading at 2394.1.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30-Share Index was down 24.0 points at
1902.6. Volume registered a modest 389 million shares, down
from the 461.2 million issues traded Tuesday.</p>
<p>Market watchers said there was concern over the
vulnerability of companies that are largely dependent on
their dollar earnings.</p>
<p>Dealers suggested that dollar-dependent internationals
were dumped on worries over the new tax plans being fashioned
by the White House. Dealers said the first impression on the
tax news was that it would be unfriendly for the dollar, and
hurt Britain's overseas earners.</p>
<p>Sterling's strength on anticipated imminent entry into the
Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System also
bruised some members of the sector.</p>
<p>Imperial Chemical Industries shed 22 pence to #11.62 (38
cents to $20.21), B.A.T lost 11 pence to 652 pence, Reuters
skidded 18 pence to #12.37 and Glaxo Holdings declined 11
pence to 799 pence.</p>
<p>BICC dropped 16 pence to 442 pence after announcing it was
to raise #177 million from a rights issue to help finance the
purchase of a larger stake in Grupo Espanol General Cable.</p>
<p>Rothmans International dropped 2 pence to 753 pence after
announcing that its year pretax profit rose 24%.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Frankfurt,
Zurich, Stockholm and Madrid; lower in Amsterdam, Paris and
Milan; and mixed in Brussels. South African gold stocks
closed marginally higher.</p>
<p>Also, prices closed higher in Singapore and Seoul, and
lower in Hong Kong, Taipei, Manila, Wellington and Sydney.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
