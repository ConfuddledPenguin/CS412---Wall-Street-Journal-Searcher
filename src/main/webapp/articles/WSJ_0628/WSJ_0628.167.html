	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- A federal judge here ruled that George V.
Koskotas, a Greek banker accused by the Greek government of a
scheme to embezzle $200 million, can be extradited to Greece.
   Judge Douglas Woodlock, upholding a magistrate's order
filed last year, said Mr. Koskotas, 35 years old, can be
extradited by the State Department to face charges that he
"misappropriated and embezzled" funds from the Bank of Crete
between 1986 and 1988, while he was serving as bank's
chairman, managing director and majority owner. Mr. Koskotas
has two months to appeal the decision.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Koskotas affair, as it is called in Greece, began
enveloping the government of former Greek Premier Andreas
Papandreou in the fall of 1988. Although Mr. Koskotas fled to
the U.S. where he was arrested by Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents, the banker's claims that he embezzled
the money with Mr. Papandreou's approval and deposited the
money in accounts of Mr. Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist
Party were a factor in the fall of the government last year.</p>
<p>For the past 19 months, Mr. Koskotas has been in a Salem,
Mass., jail while his attorneys have filed motions to avoid
extradition. Among the claims overruled by Judge Woodlock are
that both the terrorist group called 17 November and the
Greek secret police are under orders to kill Mr. Koskotas.</p>
