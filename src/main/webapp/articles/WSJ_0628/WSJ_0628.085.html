	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The government's chief economic forecasting
index flip-flopped again, rising solidly last month after
declining slightly in April, the Commerce Department
reported.
   In its second about-face in four months, the index of
leading indicators, which is intended to foreshadow the
economy's health six to nine months in advance, jumped 0.8%
in May, more than recuperating from a 0.1% decline in April.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite the strong increase, many economists believe the
wobbly performance of the leading indicators this year means
the economy's future remains precarious. The fluctuations in
the index over the past year leave it only two percentage
points above its level a year ago.</p>
<p>"That tells me that the economy is moving sideways," said
Richard D.C. Trainer, senior economist at Bank of Tokyo New
York Group. "It's not rebounding, it's not about to topple
into a recession. But it's moving at a very slow pace, a
snail's pace."</p>
<p>The economy has weakened over the past year, largely the
result of a Federal Reserve campaign to fight inflation by
keeping interest rates high. Manufacturing and housing have
been particularly bruised because purchases in those sectors
often involve borrowing.</p>
<p>Still, many economists believe the economy doesn't face an
imminent recession. The latest rise in the leading indicators
gave further evidence to support that conclusion. But the
index flashed some worrisome signals, too.</p>
<p>Building permits, one of the 11 economic indicators making
up the index, fell for the fourth consecutive month, hitting
a disturbingly low level. And an index of consumer
expectations dropped more than any other of the index
components, another in a string of recent signs that
Americans' personal spending is tapering off.</p>
<p>But at the same time, factory workers put in a longer
average work week than the month before and manufacturers'
orders for capital and consumer goods increased. Both suggest
the beleaguered manufacturing sector could be picking up a
bit.</p>
<p>"The May leading indicators show that except for housing
and construction, the production side of the economy is
beginning to recover," said William K. MacReynolds, director
of forecasting at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington.
"But consumers are becoming more pessimistic, leaving future
economic growth in doubt."</p>
<p>Some analysts believe three consecutive declines in the
leading indicators forewarn an impending recession. But many
economists dismiss this rule of thumb, noting, for example,
that the index dropped for five consecutive months after the
stock market crashed in 1987 but the economy escaped a
downturn.</p>
<p>Most analyst believe the relative strength of the U.S.
economy in the coming months will depend on the direction of
interest rates. Federal Reserve officials are scheduled to
meet in Washington Monday and Tuesday to set policy for the
ensuing six weeks, but they are expected to leave rates alone
for now.</p>
<p>Here are the net contributions of the components of the
Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After
various adjustments, they produced a 0.8% increase in the
index for May and a 0.1% decline for April.</p>
<p>                                    May       April</p>
<p>                                    1990      1990</p>
<p>Workweek ........................   .30       -.07</p>
<p>Unemployment claims .............   .08       -.08</p>
<p>Orders for consumer goods .......   .24       -.07</p>

<p>Money supply ....................  -.12        .00</p>
<p>Consumer expectations ...........  -.17        .10</p>
<p>The seasonally adjusted index numbers (1982=100) for May,
and the change from April are:</p>
<p>Index of leading indicators ......  146.2      .8</p>
<p>Index of coincident indicators ...  134.2      .1</p>
<p>Index of lagging indicators ......  118.9     -.2</p>
<p>The ratio of coincident to lagging indicators was 1.1,
unchanged from the previous month.</p>
