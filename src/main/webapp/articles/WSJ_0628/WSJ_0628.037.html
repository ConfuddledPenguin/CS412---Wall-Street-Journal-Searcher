	<p class="article-leader">CANTON, Ohio -- Timken Co. said it will build a $23
million plant in Altavista, Va., to make tapered roller
bearings, as part of the previously announced $1 billion
capital investment program to strengthen the company's
position in the global bearing business. Timken also makes
seamless mechanical alloy tubing.
   The plant, which will make bearings for wheels and drive
trains on trucks and cars, will initially have 50 employees
but could ultimately have 200.</p>
