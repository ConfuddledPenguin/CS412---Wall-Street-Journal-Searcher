	<p class="article-leader">As our Gerald Seib detailed yesterday, President Bush's
offshore-drilling edict was the product of extended political
calculation. The oil industry rightly objects to his
restrictions on their merits, but we suspect he got the
politics of the situation pretty near right. Given the
psuedo-environmentalist ethic now in force, little new
coastal extraction was to be expected soon in any case. Of
course, White House leadership on difficult issues is
welcome, but the greater responsibility in this case lies
with Congressmen and state officials, including conservative
Republicans, who formed a near-solid wall of opposition to
drilling; with judges, who've demonstrated hair-trigger
sensitivity to anti-drilling lawsuits; and with that segment
of the public that wants cheap gasoline but is intolerant of
the hazards of either tankers or less risky drilling
platforms off the coast. In time, as oil grows dearer, the
matter may become riper for rational choices.</p>
