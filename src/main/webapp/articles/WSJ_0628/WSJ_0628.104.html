	<p class="article-leader">Investors took some of their cash out of money market
mutual funds in the latest week, as yields didn't budge.
   The average seven-day compound yield, which assumes
reinvestment of dividends, remained at 7.96%, according to
IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. Assets of the 431 taxable
funds tracked by the Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter
slipped by $611 million to $378.9 billion in the week ended
Tuesday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most of the withdrawals were from funds open only to
institutions, said Martha Wittbrodt, editor of Donoghue's.
She said some of that cash may have been invested directly in
short-term Treasury securities. Yields on Treasury bills sold
at Monday's auction were about a tenth of a percentage point
higher than on the average money fund.</p>
<p>Money funds invest in such things as Treasury bills,
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and bank
certificates of deposit. Average maturity of the funds'
investments remained at 44 days, indicating no substantial
change in yields any time soon.</p>
<p>Average maturity has been 43 or 44 days for nearly three
months. The average seven-day compound yield has been at or
slightly below 8% since late January.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
remained at 7.67%. The average 30-day simple yield again was
7.67% and the average 30-day compound yield stayed at 7.96%
for the second consecutive week.</p>
<p>Yields on tax-exempt funds rose slightly, although assets
fell. The average seven-day compound yield of the tax-free
funds, for instance, increased to 5.45% from 5.40%. That's
equivalent to 7.57% for someone in the 28% tax bracket and to
8.13% for those paying 33% in taxes.</p>
<p>Assets of 222 tax-exempt funds declined to $75.9 billion
from $76.1 billion. Average maturity lengthened to 43 days
from 40.</p>
