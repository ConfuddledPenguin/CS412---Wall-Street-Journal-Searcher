	<p class="article-leader">American Healthcare Management Inc. said it will move its
corporate headquarters from Dallas to a western suburb of
Philadelphia by Oct. 1.
   Steven Volla, president of the operator of hospitals, said
the move will allow the company to take on a new management
team in the wake of its emergence late last year from
reorganization under federal bankruptcy laws.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Volla said about 15 members of American Healthcare's
current management team will relocate to the Philadelphia
area, and about 35 people working in the Dallas office will
be laid off.</p>
