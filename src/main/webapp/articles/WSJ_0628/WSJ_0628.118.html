	<h3>Liberal Justices Are Losing Their Voice As Influence on Pivotal Decisions Fades</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Despite the Supreme Court's surprise support
for federal affirmative-action programs yesterday, the high
court's liberal wing was almost entirely neutralized in the
term just ended.
   The court's four liberal justices, who have combined
experience of 91 years on the high court, wrote only a
handful of important majority opinions. And many of those
either preserved current law or were on subjects, such as
business and regulatory issues, in which the court's deep
ideological division didn't play a role.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In this regard, though the composition of the court
remained unchanged, the latest term differed from the
previous one. The court clearly became more conservative in
the 1988-89 term, but the liberals were in the fight. They
were able to eke out an occasional victory and write some
significant opinions.</p>
<p>This term, says Walter Dellinger, a professor at Duke
University Law School, with the possible exception of the
affirmative-action ruling, "There is not a single significant
case decided or written by the liberal justices in which
major new ground was broken.</p>
<p>"In nearly every case that divides the court
ideologically, there are now five justices for a conservative
result," Mr. Dellinger adds. In case after case, the only
suspense was whether the sometimes disparate views of the
five conservatives would coalesce around a single rationale.</p>
<p>For the liberals, who are among the court's most senior
members, this unusually passive role is a distinct change and
a frustrating one, according to court insiders. The liberal
wing consists of Justices William Brennan, 84 years old,
Thurgood Marshall, 81, Harry Blackmun, 81, and John Stevens,
70.</p>
<p>Even some liberal victories this term were written by
others. It isn't uncommon, especially in closely divided 5-4
decisions, to assign the majority opinion to the justice who
is the least committed to the position, figuring that will
produce a narrow product acceptable to all five justices.</p>
<p>That apparently was the strategy followed by Justice
Brennan in the important 5-4 ruling upholding the authority
of federal judges to require school districts to raise taxes
to pay for school desegregation. With Chief Justice William
Rehnquist in dissent, it fell to Justice Brennan as the
senior justice in the majority to decide who would write the
opinion. The assignment went to the usually conservative
Justice Byron White, who probably wrote a narrower opinion
than any of the liberals would have.</p>
<p>The decision was one of the most important liberal
victories of the term. But it was a reaffirmation of federal
court power to correct civil rights violations, not a new or
expanded principle. Moreover, it wasn't written by the
liberals.</p>
<p>To be sure, there were other liberal victories, but none
that recognized new constitutional rights and only a few that
expanded rights. Justice Brennan's opinion yesterday,
upholding two Federal Communications Commission preference
programs to aid minorities and women in obtaining broadcast
licenses, was a broad endorsement of federal affirmative
action. But the ruling, while unexpected, is an extension of
a 1980 Supreme Court decision.</p>
<p>Similarly, Justice Marshall's opinion striking down North
Carolina's death penalty law was foreshadowed by an earlier
ruling. And Justice Brennan's decision striking down the
federal flag desecration law was based almost entirely on the
ruling a year ago invalidating the Texas flag law.</p>
<p>The abortion issue provides a long-term illustration of
the pattern. Through most of the 1980s, a bare liberal
majority held back state efforts to restrict the right to
abortion. Now, for the second consecutive year, the liberal
wing had to content itself with rulings that upheld new state
restrictions, though the most severe aspects were struck
down.</p>

<p>This chart shows the different voting blocs of five
justices and how often they voted together in the Supreme
Court's 5-4 decisions. Classifying cases as "5-4" involves
some subjective judgements in cases in which the five votes
were achieved through multiple opinions.</p>
