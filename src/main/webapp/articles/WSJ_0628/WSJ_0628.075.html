	<p class="article-leader">I met this morning with the bipartisan leadership -- the
Speaker, the Senate majority leader, the Senate Republican
leader, the House majority leader and the House Republican
leader -- to review the status of the deficit-reduction
negotiations. It is clear to me that both the size of the
deficit problem and the need for a package that can be
enacted require all of the following: entitlement and
mandatory-program reform; tax revenue increases; growth
incentives; discretionary spending reductions; orderly
reductions in defense expenditures; and budget-process reform
to assure that any bipartisan agreement is enforceable and
that the deficit problem is brought under responsible
control. The bipartisan leadership agree with me on these
points. The budget negotiations will resume promptly with a
view toward reaching substantive agreement as quickly as
possible.
   -- George Bush, June 26</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gosh, even we didn't realize how badly the Democrats
wanted to raise America's taxes. We'll get to Lips Bush in a
moment, but the sonic boom of elation that Democrats and the
press sent rolling across the land at the mere prospect of a
"tax revenue increase" is a phenomenon you almost have to
stand back a few steps from to take in completely. We'll get
hold of ourselves eventually, but you almost want to reach
into your wallet and Fed-Ex them 20 bucks just to keep the
party going.</p>
<p>"He's reversing 10 years of Republican catechism on
taxes," cried CBS's Lesley Stahl. "The charade is finally
over," said New Jersey's jubilant Congressman Robert
Torricelli, whose party seems to have spent the last decade
chained to a wall in Ronald Reagan's dungeon. The New York
Times and Washington Post rolled out headlines normally
associated with the ends of wars or statements by Mikhail
Gorbachev. "I Lied]" shrieked a delirious New York tabloid
over the President's picture. Others ran long pent-up wish
lists of schemes to tax, hound and soak the rich wherever the
rascals may be hiding. Flush them out]</p>
<p>In time, we suppose, the hot air is going to leak out the
balloons and the Beltway will fall back to Earth. What has
changed? The answer is not much at all has changed, if you
share the premise, as we do, that political Washington has
pretty much lost contact with the rest of the country. Here,
for instance, is what conservative Newt Gingrich's Democratic
opponent said back home in Georgia: "Washington has forgotten
that the majority of Americans work for a living and can't
afford a tax increase." A cynic's reaction to Mr. Bush's
statement (and we think a corrosive cynicism toward politics
is indeed spreading among the electorate) would be that
everyone knew that Washington would raises taxes eventually
and little of it will go to reduce federal spending.</p>
<p>If indeed this is the scenario that plays out, if Mr. Bush
gets TEFRA'd by Congress with phony spending cuts the way
Ronald Reagan did in 1982, then the President will deserve
all the "Jimmy Bush" ridicule that will be heaped upon him.
However, it's far too early in the game to throw in the towel
on this President.</p>
<p>You'll notice that there were a few other items in that
Bush statement, specifically: reform of entitlements and
so-called mandatory programs, budget-process reform and
growth incentives. We don't think this is boilerplate. Mr.
Bush's closest aides have insisted to anyone who would listen
as far back as the New Orleans convention that he was serious
about putting in place institutional controls on the federal
spending process, an achievement that eluded Ronald Reagan.
Mr. Bush says the point of these reforms is to make any
budget agreement "enforceable." Currently, the principle of
enforceability doesn't exist in the budget process, which is
among the reasons the public holds Congress in such low
regard now.</p>
<p>Real, set-in-concrete budget-control reform, coupled with
Mr. Bush's cut in the capital-gains tax, would be very much
in the economy's long-term interest, and we have said
previously that we'd accept a tax increase to achieve those
goals. But the budget-reform proposals in Mr. Bush's Tuesday
statement are high hurdles for Democrats to cross before they
get to their promised land of new taxes. We doubt they can
jump that high. We wonder if they'll even try.</p>
<p>As the budget summit proceeds, there are in fact a few
signs by which anyone interested can tell if the negotiators
are serious. If over the next several weeks you find that
news stories are starting to report regularly on the details
of plans to control entitlements and mandatory spending
programs and to create new budget disciplines, such as
rescission powers for the President, then you'll know
something interesting is in the works. But if all you see is
day after day of changes on the tax-increase story, more
read-my-lips ridicule and tales of Republican anguish, then
you'll know nothing serious is going on.</p>
<p>A budget summit that ignores the other items in Mr. Bush's
statement is going to end in impasse. Should that day arrive,
George Bush, with Tuesday's statement, will escape blame for
the breakdown. The one lesson we will have learned is that
the Democratic Party exists now for the purpose of raising
taxes. That wild party they threw for themselves in the media
in the wake of Mr. Bush's statement makes this point
unarguable.</p>
