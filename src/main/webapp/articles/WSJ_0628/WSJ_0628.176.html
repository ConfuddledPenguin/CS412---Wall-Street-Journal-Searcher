	<p class="article-leader">ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Florida Federal Savings Bank said
that a U.S. District Court judge in Tampa, Fla., ordered
Florida Federal to pay $17 million of restitution and fined
the bank $2.2 million for its conviction of student-loan
fraud.
   In addition, the bank said that the Office of Thrift
Supervision has asked it to enter a consent agreement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Florida Federal was found guilty last month of falsifying
student-loan documents between November 1986 and May 1987.</p>
<p>Judge Ben Krentzman also sentenced Robert O. Harmas, a
former Florida Federal officer, to two years in prison in
connection with the student-loan scandal. In addition, Judge
Krentzman placed James J. LaMantia, another former officer,
on probation for three years and ordered him to do 300 hours
of community service.</p>
<p>"The court's recent decision defines a significant
component of the potential student-loan loss and, thereby,
helps clear the way for Florida Federal to be recapitalized,"
said the bank's president and chief executive officer, John
W. Sapankski.</p>
<p>He added that "there are several investment groups
currently performing `due diligence' on Florida Federal, and
once the student loan uncertainty is quantified and settled,
we can look for investor commitments to be made."</p>
<p>Mr. Sapanski said Florida Federal is also negotiating
settlements of the student-loan matter with the civil
division of the U.S. Justice Department and with the U.S.
Education Department.</p>
<p>Mr. Sapanski said the Office of Thrift Supervision, which
has overseen Florida Federal under a supervisory agreement
for a year, has asked the bank to enter a more stringent
consent agreement, because its regulatory capital has fallen
below $15 million.</p>
