	<p class="article-leader">Rogers Corp. said it will take a second-quarter pretax
charge of about $7 million and will post a loss for the
quarter and the full year.
   The Rogers, Conn.-based maker of electronic parts said it
is taking several steps to reduce costs and improve profit
margins, including selected divestitures and a "significant"
reduction in salaried payroll through terminations and
early-retirement offers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In last year's second quarter, Rogers had net income of
$386,000, or 13 cents a share, on sales of $43 million. For
the year, the company had net of $1.6 million, or 53 cents a
share, on sales of $175 million.</p>
<p>Norman L. Greenman, president of Rogers, said that
"savings from the actions taken are projected to recover the
entire amount of the one-time charge within two years."</p>
