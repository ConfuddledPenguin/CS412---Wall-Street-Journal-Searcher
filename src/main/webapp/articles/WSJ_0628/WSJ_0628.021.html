	<p class="article-leader">AUSTRALIA'S `BARBARIANS'</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Australia's universities are producing science and
engineering graduates who are so specialized they are
incapable of relating to the rest of society, an Australian
Senate report claims.</p>
<p>Sen. Terry Aulich, chairman of the Senate's Education
Committee, said his two-year inquiry suggested the country's
$2.6 billion education system is producing narrow-minded
graduates he dubbed "skilled barbarians."</p>
<p>Universities "are cramming everything they can into a
three- or five-year course within a narrow field but not
teaching students how to live in a society and how it
functions," the Labor Party senator said, adding: "Some
contact with the humanities is absolutely essential."</p>
<p>The report said many engineering, medicine and other
science graduates are "culturally illiterate." Even small
challenges outside their narrow fields left them floundering,
it said.</p>
<p>FRANCE BANS ALL TOBACCO ADS</p>
<p>France's National Assembly approved a ban on all tobacco
advertising and most liquor advertising starting in 1993. The
law forbids direct or indirect advertising for tobacco
products, including sponsorships of sports and cultural
events. Legislators from wine-growing regions succeeded in
excluding most wines from the liquor-ad ban. The bill is part
of an anti-smoking campaign by the government. Cigarette
prices are due to rise by 15% later this year, and the
national railroad announced this week that smoking is to be
banned on all of its commuter trains.</p>
<p>TURNABOUT FOR NATO</p>
<p>The North Atlantic Treaty Organization will begin allowing
its diplomats and officials to travel to East Germany
whenever they like without special permission. "The rules
about travel were our own special little Berlin Wall and it's
starting to fall apart at last," said one NATO diplomat. The
travel restrictions, drawn up because of fears about security
leaks, entrapment or blackmail by communist agents, haven't
been lifted for any other Warsaw Pact state and also remain
in force for China, North Korea and Vietnam.</p>
<p>TOKYO WATER SHORTAGE</p>
<p>Tokyo might have to ration water this summer because of an
unusually dry rainy season, a spokesman for the Bureau of
Waterworks said. "Reservoirs are already more than half
empty," the spokesman said. The rainy season begins early in
June and ends in late July. This year there has been less
than half the normal rainfall in May and June. Officials from
Tokyo and the five neighboring prefectural governments will
meet today to discuss the problem.</p>
<p>PAPER FROM FINLAND</p>
<p>Finland's paper exporters said they would continue trading
with the Soviet Union after confirmation that the Soviets
have begun paying back debts totaling more than $25 million.
Thomas Nysten, president of Finnpap, the organization of
Finnish paper producers, said banks had confirmed receipt of
$15 million. "We also have unconfirmed information that the
Soviet Union has paid a further $2 million, so . . . we have
decided to continue paper deliveries to the U.S.S.R.," he
said. Last week, Finnish paper exporters suspended all trade
with the Soviet Union to protest the nonpayment of debts.</p>
<p>SAPPORO VENTURE IN WASHINGTON</p>
<p>Sapporo Breweries Ltd., Japan's second-largest beer
brewer, said it has teamed up with a U.S. farm operator to
buy vineyards in the state of Washington. Sapporo officials
said their company has established Sapporo Vineyards USA Inc.
in Seattle together with Wyckoff Farms Inc., operator of one
of the largest farms in Washington, to manage Snipes
Vineyards, which they bought for an undisclosed price. The
new company, capitalized at $2 million, is owned 51% by
Sapporo, 30% by Wyckoff Farms and the rest by a Japanese
trading house, Okura & Co.</p>
<p>AIRLINE LINKUP CHALLENGED</p>
<p>The European Community Commission objected to the linkup
of British Airways, Sabena and KLM on the ground that some
aspects of the pact violate EC competition rules.</p>
<p>Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner for competition affairs,
said the commission will now enter into negotiations on how
to modify the linkup to meet EC competition rules. He said
the concept behind the linkup, which is to create a
Europewide air hub at Brussels Zaventem airport, is a good
one. But he said the form of the linkup among the three
airlines could harm competition among EC airlines.</p>
<p>The linkup is effectively a unit of Sabena that is called
Sabena World Airlines. British Airways and KLM both have 20%
stakes in the venture, with the remainder held by Sabena, now
a holding company.</p>
<p>Under EC rules, the companies have eight weeks to reply to
the objections.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Officials in Jakarta were set to meet today to discuss how
to rid the Indonesian capital's streets of beggars, including
children who sing for money. "People who beg have no
discipline," said one official. "By begging, they violate
regulations." . . . In Malaysia, a Thai man found guilty of
possessing a pistol was hanged, the national news agency
Bernama reported. Under Malaysian law, anyone found in
possession of firearms, ammunition or explosives can be
charged with a crime; if convicted, they can be sentenced to
death.</p>
