	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it placed
the long-term debt and commercial paper ratings of Bank of
New York Co. under review for a possible downgrade.
   Moody's cited the bank's exposure to highly leveraged
borrowers and troubled real estate, as well as its proposed
takeover of Northeast Bancorp in Stamford, Conn., as
potential problems. Moody's and other rating firms already
have reduced their opinion of other money center banks' debt
for many of the same reasons.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for the bank said that while disappointed by
Moody's announcement, "we believe our basic businesses are
well diversified and our earnings power remains sound."</p>
