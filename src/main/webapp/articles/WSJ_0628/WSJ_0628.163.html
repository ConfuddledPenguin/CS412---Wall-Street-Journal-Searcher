	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee
approved by voice vote a bill that would give the Securities
and Exchange Commission the power to impose fines for a
variety of securities-law violations.
   The SEC's authority to levy fines currently is limited to
insider-trading cases. For other violations, such as
short-selling offenses or fraudulent sales practices, the
agency must choose between an injunction or barring the
offender from the securities industry altogether.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to giving the SEC the power to impose fines,
the bill would allow the commission to impose
cease-and-desist orders against securities-law violators.
"This injunctive remedy would mean the SEC would no longer be
required to go to court to secure a temporary restraining
order or permanent injunction," said Rep. Matthew Rinaldo
(R., N.J.).</p>
<p>The bill also would permit the SEC to ask courts to
prohibit people convicted of a securities-law violation from
serving on the board of a public company. Moreover, the bill
would let the SEC impose on violators fines of up to $100,000
for individuals and $500,000 for firms, or the amount of
their profits, whichever is greater. The bill is identical in
most respects to a measure passed by the Senate Banking
Committee.</p>
<p>The committee also passed by voice vote legislation aimed
at curbing fraud and abuse in the penny-stock market. The
bill would, among other things, substantially increase
disclosure requirements for some penny-stock issues and
expand SEC power to bar crooked penny-stock salespeople from
the securities industry.</p>
