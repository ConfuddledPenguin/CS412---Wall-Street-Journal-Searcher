	<p class="article-leader">Newmark & Lewis Inc. expects a profit on a 27% sales rise
for its year ending Jan. 31, said Warren G. Hyman,
co-chairman and co-chief executive.
   In the previous year, the discount retailer of electronics
and appliances had net income of $117,000, or two cents a
share, including the effect of an accounting change. Sales
totaled $245.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Hyman declined to estimate profit. But he said he
expected sales of between $310 million and $315 million. He
said the current year will include results for nine months of
the retailing assets of Brick Church Appliance Inc., acquired
in May.</p>
<p>The Hicksville, N.Y.-based company also plans to try to
reduce its sales and general and administrative expenses,
which totaled $66.9 million last year, in part by controlling
expenses more tightly and by achieving some efficiencies of
scale with the acquisition of Brick Church.</p>
