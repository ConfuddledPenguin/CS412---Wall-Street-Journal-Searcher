	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In a reversal of his position, House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski plans to
introduce a bill creating tax-free enterprise zones in
impoverished areas.
   The Chicago Democrat plans to hold a press conference on
the subject today, a senior aide to the chairman said. His
change of heart greatly increases the chances that some sort
of enterprise-zone bill will be part of any tax legislation
enacted this year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Bush administration, particularly Housing Secretary
Jack Kemp, has been pushing a proposal to establish as many
as 50 enterprise zones in distressed urban and rural
communities. Investments made in the zones would be given
tax-favored treatment, costing the government an estimated
$300 million annually by fiscal 1993. But the
administration's proposal has been rebuffed in the past,
partly because of a lack of support from Mr. Rostenkowski.</p>
<p>Mr. Rostenkowski's proposal would allow for fewer zones
than the administration proposal, but tax staffers said it is
designed to cost the same amount.</p>
<p>The aide to Mr. Rostenkowski said it was a coincidence
that the Ways and Means chairman's change of heart came in
the same week that President Bush reversed his position on
tax increases. "The chairman has been looking at this for
quite a while," the aide said.</p>
