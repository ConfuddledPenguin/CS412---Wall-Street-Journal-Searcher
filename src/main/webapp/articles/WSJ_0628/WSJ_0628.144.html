	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- U.S. and Japanese officials said they settled
most of the issues outstanding in the Structural Impediments
Initiative talks by early Thursday morning and added that
they were pushing to reach a final agreement by Thursday
afternoon.
   After meeting all night, the negotiators broke off after 5
a.m. and agreed to reconvene at 11 a.m. Negotiators said
there was still a chance they wouldn't complete a final
report by Thursday afternoon, in which case they would
probably resume talks in the U.S. next week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The wide-ranging talks, advocating sweeping changes in
macro and microeconomic policies in both nations, are aimed
at altering the underlying causes of the $49 billion
bilateral trade imbalance.</p>
<p>Attempting to resolve the most contentious issue of the
SII discussions, the Japanese government during the night
said it would spend 430 trillion yen ($2.780 trillion) on
public works over the next 10 years, 15 trillion yen more
than it stated last week. The Japanese government added that
Nippon Telegraph & Telephone Corp. and Japan Railway Group,
which are currently being privatized, will spend about 25
trillion yen over the next decade.</p>
<p>The U.S. argues that an increase in public spending will
shift resources to Japan's domestic economy and cut its trade
surplus, while Japanese officials have expressed fears that
too much spending will fuel inflation.</p>
<p>At 10:40 p.m. Wednesday, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
spoke with President Bush by telephone and told him he had
made the "maximum effort" in putting together the package.
The two sides are pushing to complete a report before the
Houston summit meeting of the seven leading industrialized
democracies in two weeks.</p>
<p>The major issue outstanding when the talks recessed
Thursday morning, a member of the U.S. delegation said, was
whether Americans thought the increase would have a
sufficient economic impact. He said U.S. officials were
analyzing the data before the late morning meeting. "We would
have liked to have seen more," he said, but added that "it
does clearly reverse a 10-year trend" of public spending
declining relative to the size of the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>The two sides, according to the senior Bush administration
official, did reach agreement on the other major policy
issues. Most notably, he said, Japan agreed to "a significant
shortening" of the time required to obtain a patent and gave
"commitments" on increasing penalties for antitrust
violations and strengthening the rights of private parties to
bring antitrust lawsuits.</p>
<p>Japan also agreed to set up an import advisory council
under the prime minister that will propose projects to boost
imports and will also take measures to provide 24-hour
clearance for imports, the U.S. official said. The U.S. is
also satisfied with actions Japan has taken since an interim
SII report was written in April to streamline its
distribution system, most significantly to insure that large
retail stores can get permission to open less than two years
after applying for a permit. Currently the process can take
more than 10 years.</p>
<p>The U.S. official said that the two sides were still
haggling over the details of how to follow-up on the SII
final report to make sure both sides adhere to their promises
and that the actions have the desired effect. He said the
U.S. was also pushing Japan to reaffirm clearly that it is
committed to reducing its capital account surplus. In recent
weeks, some Japanese officials have argued that Japan should
preserve its surplus, in part to help aid needy countries.</p>
<p>While most of the focus has been on Japan, the process is
supposed to be a "two-way street." U.S. negotiators said
President Bush's announcement Wednesday that he would support
an increase in tax revenue proved to the Japanese the U.S. is
serious about reducing their budget deficit, action the
Japanese say is crucial to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign
capital.</p>
<p>Concerned with mounting trade tensions, and a seemingly
intractable trade imbalance, the two countries agreed to set
up the SII forum last July to supplement an endless series of
sector-specific spats.</p>
<p>While many analysts have expressed cynicism about the
value of the SII talks, U.S. officials say it could have a
significant effect in reshaping the Japanese economy and
bilateral economic relations within two to three years. If an
agreement is reached amicably, both countries will also
likely hail the pact as further evidence of the decline in
tensions between the two countries.</p>
