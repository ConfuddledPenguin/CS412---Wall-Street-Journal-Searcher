	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- MCorp said it agreed to sell its interest in its
Brownsville, Texas, bank for about $17 million to a private
investor group led by the bank's management.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MCorp, which had all but five of its banks seized by
federal regulators last year, has been attempting to
liquidate its assets to pay creditors. MCorp said the final
price of the Brownsville bank, which has $445 million in
assets, may vary depending on the bank's net worth at the
time of sale.</p>
<p>MCorp said it expects to complete the sale, subject to
approval by a federal bankruptcy-court judge and by
regulators, by Dec. 31.</p>
