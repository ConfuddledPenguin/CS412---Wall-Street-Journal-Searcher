	<p class="article-leader">Midwest banks are bracing for a wave of problem real
estate loans.
   From Pittsburgh to Minneapolis, Midwest banks have more
shaky loans for offices, hotels, shopping centers and
apartment buildings than they've had in decades. And though
the credit troubles so far appear less serious than those
experienced by Northeast banks, Midwest lenders are making
sizable additions to loan-loss reserves. They also are
tightening up lending standards, putting a crimp in new
construction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There's no question there are widespread financial
problems in real estate," says Norman Robertson, chief
economist at Mellon Bank Corp. in Pittsburgh, who counts the
Midwest as a problem region.</p>
<p>Many Midwest bankers say the big charges have already been
taken, but some observers think they are too optimistic.
"It's becoming clear that the problem is much worse and much
more universal than people thought a year ago," says A. Gary
Shilling, a New York economic consultant. "History suggests
that bankers seldom get the entire cancer out on the first
trip to the operating room."</p>
<p>Investors share his concern. The price of many Midwestern
bank stocks are scraping bottom as investors anticipate
further problems. Common shares of Pittsburgh's PNC Financial
Corp., for instance, hit a low of $29.50 on Monday, 40% below
the 52-week high. AmeriTrust Corp. stock also is down 40%
from the Cleveland bank's 52-week high.</p>
<p>PNC, one of the largest Midwest regional bank holding
companies, added $108.9 million to its loan-loss reserves in
the first quarter, about three times the amount normally set
aside for potential loan losses. And PNC officials project a
$65 million to $75 million provision for the current quarter.
The extra provisions cover problem real estate loans PNC made
in the East and Southeast, specifically in Philadelphia and
New York and in Georgia and Florida, officials say. Midwest
real estate loans haven't presented unusual problems so far,
PNC says.</p>
<p>AmeriTrust reported a first-quarter loss because it was
forced to downgrade $140 million of loans that officials
still expect to be repaid on time. Following the downgrades,
the bank boosted loan-loss reserves to $219.3 million, or
2.64% of total loans and leases, from $110.2 million, or
1.34% at the end of last year.</p>
<p>Those actions result from "a more stringent view of all
real estate loans" by bank regulators, rather than a
deterioration of AmeriTrust's loan portfolio, says James W.
Otto, executive vice president and chief financial officer.
The bank made an addition to loss reserves greater than was
required to cover loan downgrades, he says, because officials
wanted to be sure they don't take a second hit later.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, industry sources say regulators are examining
loans at Mellon this week. While such examinations are a
regular practice, this year they have frequently resulted in
downgrading of some loans. Mellon says as a matter of policy
it doesn't comment on regulatory matters.</p>
<p>Equimark Corp., another Pittsburgh bank holding company,
said yesterday it will lose between $12 million and $17
million in the second quarter, stemming in part from bad real
estate loans. The price of Equimark shares has been more than
halved in the last year, reflecting its deteriorating credit
quality.</p>
<p>Even Banc One Corp., generally regarded as one of the
best-managed banks in the nation, expects more troubles
ahead. The Columbus, Ohio, lender said in a recent Securities
and Exchange Commission filing that its nonperforming loans
could rise by as much as $70 million, or 25%, in the second
quarter.</p>
<p>Some bankers contend the Midwest region isn't the problem
per se: the underlying economy is more stable than in much of
the U.S. right now, and both lenders and builders were more
cautious than in other regions. Instead, many problem loans
now surfacing at Midwest banks are tied to real estate
projects in the Northeast or Southwest.</p>
<p>Still, the Midwest commercial real estate market looks
healthy only by comparison. About 23% of top-quality office
space in Indianapolis is vacant, for instance, commonly
leading to discounts of 35% as developers scramble for
tenants. Cleveland's vacancy rate, meanwhile, probably will
almost double by 1994. Overbuilding of offices, retail space,
hotels and apartments in the Minneapolis area has led to a
sizable drop in effective rental rates, says David G. Hansen,
senior vice president, First National Bank, a unit of First
Bank System Inc., Minneapolis. As a result, his bank has
drastically curtailed commercial construction lending.</p>
<p>Overbuilding in the region could prove a big problem if
there's a lengthy recession. And even without a recession,
Midwest bank earnings won't be robust for at least a year or
two. Besides the higher loan-loss provisions, some bankers
admit that they're turning down loans they would have made a
year ago. Fewer loans mean lower profits.</p>
