	<p class="article-leader">New York -- Money, hope and glory . . . Angelo Gaja first
heard those words at the tender age of eight. As a boy, Mr.
Gaja (pronounced Guy-ya), one of Italy's top wine producers,
used to spend the last weeks of summer vacation at his
grandmother's vineyard in the Langhe hills of the Piedmont in
northwestern Italy.
   "Wine is a good business," she would tell him as they
walked in the vineyard or through the maze of barrels in the
cellar. "It brings you three necessary things in life: money,
not a lot, perhaps, but enough, if the wine is good; hope,
that comes from always working to make the wine better; and,
if the wine is very good, a little bit of glory."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Winegrowing has brought all three to Mr. Gaja, and in
large measure. Dynamic and energetic, he is something of a
modern legend in the world of wine, one of a handful of
innovative Italian wine producers who have thrust Italy into
the vinous limelight with wines of intensity and finesse.
Barbaresco, the wine he made famous and the one that brought
him glory in return, is a firm, deep, long-lived red that for
years had stood in the shadow of the Piedmont's most famous
red, Barolo.</p>
<p>Made from the same grape, the nebbiolo, Barolo and
Barbaresco come from steep hillsides of the Langhe west of
the medieval town of Alba, an area also known for such
gastronomic delights as white truffles and hazelnuts. Barolo
is the region's power red, inky and potent, usually
undrinkably tannic in its early years, beginning to mellow in
eight to 10. Barolo is stout and imperial, Barbaresco is
slender and svelte, a shade lighter in body with the focus
more on fruit and finesse than power. It can age just as long
as Barolo, and often does so with greater elegance and charm.
I much prefer, for instance, the Gaja 1964 Barbaresco to any
'64 Barolo that I've tasted.</p>
<p>His work with Barbaresco is only one of the innovations
that has brought glory to Angelo Gaja. He was the first to
use small oak barrels for aging reds in the Piedmont. He
planted the first Cabernet Sauvignon vines in the Piedmont in
a century. He was among the first to bottle Barbaresco from
individual vineyards, each with its own identity (Sori San
Lorenzo, Sori Tilden, Costa Russi). Mr. Gaja's innovative
instincts became apparent as soon as he joined the family
operation in 1961.</p>
<p>As the fifth generation of Gajas (who came to the Piedmont
from Spain in the 17th century), he was the first to halt the
practice of buying grapes and produce wines only from
family-owned vineyards. He studied wine making at the
Enological Institute in Alba as well as the University of
Montpellier in France, and holds a degree in economics from
the University of Turin in Italy.</p>
<p>Mr. Gaja's grandmother, Clotilde Rey, managed to instill
in him her deep commitment to quality. The better the wine,
she told him repeatedly during his summer visits, the more
people will pay for it. "The words didn't mean much to me,
then," Mr. Gaja recalled during a visit here. "I was just a
kid; it wasn't till I was in my 30s that I began to realize
that all my efforts to produce the best were really inspired
by her."</p>
<p>In her honor Mr. Gaja named his first Chardonnay vineyard,
planted in 1979, for her and his firstborn daughter, Gaia.
The 1984 Gaia y Rey Chardonnay created a sensation when it
appeared in 1986, was rated the top Chardonnay in the
Gault-Millaut wine olympiad and became the first Italian
Chardonnay to grace the wine lists of three-star restaurants
in France.</p>
<p>Mr. Gaja planted Cabernet Sauvignon in 1979, five acres on
the hillside below the family home in the village of
Barbaresco -- much to the disapproval of his father,
Giovanni. Each time the elder Gaja passed the vineyard he
would shake his head in disgust and mutter "Darmagi]" which
means "What a pity]" in Piemontese dialect. So Mr. Gaja named
the vineyard Darmagi -- now a family joke since the Gaja
Cabernet commands $75 a bottle.</p>
<p>It probably would bring more since there is so little
produced, under a thousand cases, but Mr. Gaja will not price
it above his vineyard-designated Barbarescos, which he feels
are his best wines. "I planted Chardonnay and Cabernet
because I couldn't resist the challenge of seeing how they
would do in the Piedmont," he said. "These are two of the
world's great wine grapes, both widely planted. What would
Piedmont Cabernet and Chardonnay be like? How would they
measure up to the best planted elsewhere?"</p>
<p>Gaja Cabernet and especially the Chardonnay proved
themselves even beyond Mr. Gaja's expectations (and have
prompted others to plant Chardonnay in the Piedmont). But his
heart and soul remain commited to Barbaresco, to which his
family has deep emotional ties.</p>
<p>His first single-vineyard Barbaresco was Sori San Lorenzo
("sori" means hilltop with a southern exposure; San Lorenzo
is the patron saint of Alba). It is the firmest and deepest
of Gaja Barbarescos, the one in need of longest aging. Costa
Russi, rich in texture, with the flavor of ripe berries, is
usually drinkable soonest. Sori Tilden, however, is the Gaja
wine most sought after. Fermented over the course of three to
four weeks, it combines power and finesse, offering the
greatest complexity of the three. Yet it is remarkably smooth
and harmonious, especially the currently available 1986.</p>
<p>The '86 Barbarescos are somewhat less dramatic than those
of 1985, 1988 and probably 1989 -- all considered the
Piedmont's top vintages of the '80s. The prices of the 1986s
do not reflect lesser stature -- $93 for the Costa Russi, and
$95 each for the San Lorenzo and the Sori Tilden, but they
are more often seen on wine lists than in wine shops. In
fact, Mr. Gaja has been criticized to some extent for
catering to restaurants over private consumers.</p>
<p>"I am not against private collectors," he insists, "but
what I don't like are the speculators who buy wine to trade,
not to drink. Our wines reach a wider audience in
restaurants."</p>
<p>Just how far-flung his public is Mr. Gaja knows from
direct experience. He spends a great deal of time traveling
around the globe, far more than a decade ago, when English
was still a foreign language to him. Now, self-taught, he
speaks English fluently and clearly enjoys the ease with
which he can personally present his wines, not only here but
in the growing market of the Pacific Rim.</p>
<p>Asia is only one of Mr. Gaja's current challenges. In 1988
the family purchased a 70-acre vineyard in the Serralunga
district of Barolo, an area noted for powerful, aggressively
tannic Barolo. The move surprised some who had rather
expected him to expand production with his successful
Cabernet and Chardonnay (he has in fact added another
Chardonnay, the Rossj-Baj). "I cannot say that people are
becoming bored with Cabernet Sauvignon," he explains, "but I
see interest in the market for something other than Cabernet.
Knowledgeable wine drinkers are looking for new tastes, and
Barolo and Barbaresco have scents and flavors that are
unique. The wines of recent vintages show more balance and
that, I think, is the direction for the future with nebbiolo.
The time is at hand for elegance rather then sheer opulence."</p>
<p>The first estate-bottled Gaja Barolo, from the outstanding
vintage of 1988, will be available in 1992. No price has been
set as yet.</p>
