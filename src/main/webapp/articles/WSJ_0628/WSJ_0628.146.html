	<p class="article-leader">A Colorado state court found that May Department Stores
Co. illegally deceived customers, in a widely watched case
involving the company's advertising practices.
   The ruling affects only the Denver-based May D&F unit of
the St. Louis department-store operator, but it's considered
likely to have a wide impact in the retail industry, where
promotional pricing practices are drawing increasing scrutiny
from state officials around the nation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>May D&F said it is "disappointed" by the decision. "We
believe our advertising practices are fair and appropriate,"
the company said, adding that it is considering an appeal.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Colorado Attorney General Duane
Woodard claimed that May D&F duped consumers by artificially
inflating its so-called original or regular prices, and then
promoting discounts from those prices as bargains. The state
sought an injunction against the practices, under the state's
Consumer Protection Act.</p>
<p>May denied the charges, contending in part that its
procedures comply with federal law, which would take
precedence over the state statute.</p>
<p>But yesterday afternoon, in a 17-page ruling, Judge Larry
J. Naves wrote that May D&F's practices didn't comply with
the Federal Trade Commission Guides Against Deceptive
Pricing. The comparative price advertising policies May
established in 1986 failed that test, said Judge Naves, and
so, to a lesser extent, did the amended policy May adopted in
1989.</p>
<p>The case, which May opted to fight rather than to settle
out of court as other retailers have done in similar cases,
deals with the pricing of such mundane items as saucepans,
rotisseries, coffee-makers, mattresses and glassware. But it
has provided an intriguing view of how retail price
promotions can make consumers think they're getting a better
deal than they really are.</p>
<p>In general, May acknowledged that in certain sections of
the store it offered items at what it called the "original"
or "regular" price for 10 days at the start of a six-month
selling season. But few items moved at these levels. The
company then would drop the price, and advertise the items as
below "original price." Further discounts from those
realistic prices were touted as sales prices of limited
duration, as "15-hour specials" and the like. At the end of
the six-month season, the items were briefly marked up again
to the generally noncompetitive levels for another 10-day
period that would re-establish the next 170 days' prices as
"bargains."</p>
<p>The court found that the state "has proven by a
preponderance of the evidence that May D&F violated all
three" of the deceptive practices alleged in the complaint.</p>
<p>"May D&F's `original' price for practically all of its
merchandise in the Home Store (section) was a fictitious high
price established as a reference price for the purpose of
subsequently advertising bargain reductions from that price,"
the judge wrote. "The clear expectation of May D&F was to
sell all or practically all merchandise at its `sale' price."
The company's policy as amended in 1989 was a "step in the
right direction," he said, but May's "failure to disclose to
the public its subjective and unique" methodology for price
labeling affected consumers' choices "to their detriment."</p>
<p>The court enjoined May D&F from establishing a reference
price for the sole purpose of future markdowns unless it
"fully and completely" discloses to consumers its method of
determining those original prices at the same time, in its
ads. It also is prohibited from using price terms "which have
meanings unique to May D&F," unless it also publishes a
glossary of such terms. The order prohibits the unit from
advertising sales of limited duration "in such manner as to
communicate to consumers a false sense of urgency to
purchase," when similar price levels are routinely scheduled
throughout a selling season.</p>
<p>The court ordered May D&F to pay an $8,000 fine to the
state -- much less than the more than $1 million the state
had sought -- and directed the company to pay costs and
attorney fees to the state; an official at the attorney
general's office estimated that would total $250,000 to
$400,000.</p>
<p>The attorney general's office called the ruling "not only
a significant decision but a major victory. The court agreed
with our position in all respects." An official said such
practices hurt not only consumers, but also work to the
"disadvantage of small-business competitors who can't compete
with these kinds of advertising shenanigans."</p>
