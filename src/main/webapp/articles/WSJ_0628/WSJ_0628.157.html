	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Lisbeth R. Barron, an analyst at S.G. Warburg,
has done the unthinkable. She has pulled her neutral
recommendation on Time Warner and advised clients to sell
their shares.
   Virtually every other Wall Street analyst is bullish,
touting Time Warner as tomorrow's global media giant. But Ms.
Barron's opinion has more than scarcity value. Her scrutiny
of Time Warner's numbers -- no less than her conclusion --
departs from the crowd, and they suggest that the Street is
off the mark.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's very easy to get caught up in this excitement" over
Time Warner's potential in foreign markets, she says. "But
when you get down to core markets, the numbers don't shine
through."</p>
<p>Valuing Time Warner has been problematic since last year's
merger of Time and Warner Communications -- not least because
the company won't have earnings for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The company, having turned down a $200-a-share offer from
Paramount, is unusually eager to boost its stock price. And
it has given an encouraging nod to analysts who value the
firm at about $250 a share.</p>
<p>Analysts, in general, have reached such values by
estimating what various pieces would fetch in sales to
private buyers. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, for instance,
calculates a "private-market value" of $225 a share and then
concludes that Time Warner's stock should someday sell at 75%
of that figure, or $168.75.</p>
<p>"We're not in a world where this company will get taken
over," DLJ's Mark Manson concedes. "So why value them at what
a private buyer would pay? You have to value it somehow. And,
historically, that's how they've traded."</p>
<p>Ms. Barron's numbers suggest another route. She is bullish
on Time Warner's individual units, though not as bullish as
the consensus. Noting the advertising slump, she is cautious
on Time Warner's publications. She says it will be hard to
significantly boost film profits compared with 1989, when the
company launched the blockbuster Batman. And Home Box Office
earnings she sees as flat.</p>
<p>With all that, Ms. Barron forecasts 1990 operating cash
flow, or the cash provided by operating units, at $2.3
billion, within 10% of what other analysts predict. And she
forecasts that the figure will climb at a healthy 10% to 15%
per year.</p>
<p>That hardly sounds bearish. But Ms. Barron focuses on free
cash flow, the amount of operating cash left after paying
interest on Time Warner's $10.5 billion in debt, dividends on
common and preferred stock, overhead and capital spending.
And, she notes, "interest expense and dividends on its
preferred stock will cut dramatically into free cash flow."</p>
<p>This year, Ms. Barron estimates free cash flow of perhaps
$4.27 a share. By 1993, assuming the company's pay-in-kind
preferred converts to cash, free cash flow should double to
perhaps $9 a share, Ms. Barron says.</p>
<p>But if Ms. Barron's estimates are correct, Time Warner is
trading today at a pricey 11 times the free cash flow
anticipated in 1993. In other words, were the stock to stand
still, it would still be expensive, relative to cash flow,
three years later.</p>
<p>For companies such as Time Warner, free cash flow measures
how much cash will be left to retire debt. And in the absence
of earnings, free cash flow is the best available proxy.</p>
<p>Permeating the Street's thinking is a grand vision of the
Time Warner of the future benefiting from synergies and
economies of scale in its many markets.</p>
<p>In the future, according to Time Warner's many fans, the
average Joe will be surrounded by a galaxy of the company's
audio and visual products, and it will matter not whether
this Joe lives in Albany, N.Y., or Alsace-Lorraine, France.
As barriers fall in Europe, Time Warner will be there.</p>
<p>A Kidder Peabody report says, "the new entity is
structurally positioned to compete in an increasingly global
market." Kidder's Christopher Dixon cites Time Warner's joint
venture in Scandinavian pay television as evidence. "It has
the critical mass and size to gain market share," he says.</p>
<p>Ms. Barron isn't convinced. Time Warner missed out on
buying music powerhouse Geffen Records, which was acquired by
MCA for nearly $500 million in stock. "Time Warner's
investment bankers just told the world that their stock is
worth $250 a share, so how can they use stock {at its current
level} to acquire anything?" she asks. And highly leveraged
Time Warner is unlikely to purchase much by issuing more
debt.</p>
<p>Jerry Levin, Time Warner's vice chairman, won't discuss
the company's precise valuation. But in his view, valuing the
company at a strict multiple of free cash flow is simplistic.
Ticking off such features as Time's control over
distribution, its geographic spread, its technological
prowess, and the franchise nature of assets such as Time
magazine, Mr. Levin says, "These aren't fungible products. I
attach a premium to them." As for the company's flexibility,
he says, "everything that's strategically necessary, we're
going to do."</p>
