	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stocks finished higher as investors bought up
blue-chip shares despite disappointing earnings news from
American Telephone & Telegraph.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 19.80 to 2862.13.
Volume totaled 146,620,000 shares on the New York Stock
Exchange, where advancing issues outpaced decliners 851 to
597.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>AT&T stunned analysts yesterday morning when it announced
that second-quarter earnings, to be reported in midJuly,
would be below the $699 million, or 65 cents a share,
reported in the year-earlier quarter. Analysts had been
anticipating earnings improvement; in a recent poll of 11
analysts by Zacks Investment Research, the lowest estimate
was 68 cents.</p>
<p>The stock finished down 2 1/8 to 39 1/8 on huge volume of
11,528,900 shares. AT&T's composite volume was the third
highest of the year for any Big Board issue, and the highest
since 14.3 million shares of Amax were traded Feb. 5.</p>
<p>"Everybody thought the AT&T numbers would pull the market
down," said Richard Meyer, head of equity trading at
Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co.</p>
<p>But to the surprise of many traders, the AT&T sell-off
didn't spread to other stocks. As a result, investors'
confidence rose, and they started buying health, drug and
consumer issues and other stocks of companies with a history
of solid earnings growth. Stock-index arbitrage buy programs,
where traders buy or sell stocks and offset the position in
futures to profit from price differences, also lifted shares.</p>
<p>Among broad averages, Standard & Poor's 500-stock index
rose 3.08 to 355.14; the New York Stock Exchange composite
index climbed 1.40 to 193.87 and the Dow Jones Equity Market
Index added 2.59 to 330.29.</p>
<p>"Some of the consumer nondurable stocks, which look
overvalued, are getting more so because it is the safe place
to put money on a short-term basis," said Robert Stovall,
president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers.</p>
<p>Drug stocks, many of which are trading at a higher
price-earnings ratio to the overall market, advanced.
Bristol-Myers Squibb added 1 7/8 to 63 1/4 on 1.3 million
shares; Merck advanced 1 3/8 to 84 1/4; Johnson & Johnson
rose 1 3/4 to 66 5/8; Warner-Lambert gained 1 7/8 to 64 1/8,
and Eli Lilly climbed 1 5/8 to 81.</p>
<p>Prudential-Bache Securities analyst Barbara Ryan told Dow
Jones Professional Investor Report she expects second-quarter
earnings for the group to be up 14% from a year earlier on a
10% sales rise.</p>
<p>Humana surged 3 to 48 1/2 to lead a rally among
health-care issues. Manor Care rose 1/4 to 14 1/4, Community
Psychiatric Centers gained 1/2 to 26 3/4 and National Medical
Enterprises added 1/2 to 37 1/8.</p>
<p>In the pollution-control sector, Waste Management rose 1
3/4 to 41 on one million shares. Browning-Ferris Industries
rose 3/8 to 43 1/2; the company agreed to sell used aluminum
cans to Aluminum Co. of America for recycling. Alcoa closed
unchanged at 63 7/8.</p>
<p>Amid the slump in AT&T, two other notable casualties of
earnings-related selling this week extended their declines:
Caterpillar, which fell 1/4 to 52 1/4 as 1.5 million shares
were traded, Dow Chemical, which dropped 3/8 to 57 on 1.4
million shares.</p>
<p>But United Telecommunications, which went through a bout
of selling two weeks ago after PaineWebber lowered estimates
of the company's earnings, gained 1 3/8 to 38 3/4 on 1.2
million shares. Other telephone stocks also fared well
despite the selling in AT&T; GTE climbed 1 1/8 to 32 and Bell
Atlantic added 7/8 to 50.</p>
<p>L.A. Gear rose 1 1/8 to 27 1/4 after the company reported
earnings of 51 cents a share for the quarter ended May 31, in
line with its projection earlier this month of 50 cents to 60
cents a share. The stock had lost 1 3/8 points Tuesday as
market players awaited the results.</p>
<p>PPG Industries retreated 2 7/8 to 46 3/8. This newspaper
detailed the environmental problems facing the company
because of chromium-waste pollution in Jersey City, N.J.,
where PPG once processed chromium ore.</p>
<p>Fluor gained 7/8 to 46. Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil
company selected the company's Fluor Daniel unit to manage
the expansion of its oil and gas production facilities. Terms
weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>Sotheby's Holdings dropped 5/8 to 16 3/4 after the
1989-1990 art auction season ended with a disappointing sale
in London, in which 58% of the artworks put up for bids
failed to sell.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the earnings front, Family Dollar Stores
added 1/2 to 13 after reporting that net income for its
fiscal third quarter, ended May 31, was up 65% from a year
ago.</p>
<p>West Co. lost 1 3/4 to 17 3/8. The company said its
second-quarter earnings could be more than 50% lower than a
year ago because of production problems in the U.S. and a
curtailment of business in Brazil.</p>
<p>Times Mirror dropped 1/8 to 31 1/2 after saying that
operating results for the second quarter "will show no
improvement" from its first-quarter results.</p>
<p>Hunt Manufacturing fell 2 to 13 3/8. The company said its
earnings for the fiscal quarter ended June 3 were down 48%
from the year-ago period, and its hopes for record net income
this year have been "all but dashed."</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.25
to 357.05. Volume totaled 12,350,000 shares.</p>
<p>Bolar Pharmaceutical fell 3/8 to 5 1/8. Certain sellers of
SmithKline Beecham common stock filed a class-action suit
against Bolar over its alleged submission of fraudulent data
to the Food and Drug Administration to obtain approval for a
generic version of Dyazide, SmithKline's blood-pressure drug.</p>
