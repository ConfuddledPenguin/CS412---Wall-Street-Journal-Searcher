	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Don R. Dixon, former owner of the defunct Vernon
Savings & Loan Association, pleaded innocent to charges that
he illegally used thrift funds to reimburse employees for
expenditures on political contributions and female escorts.
   Mr. Dixon's arraignment yesterday in federal court here
came one day after his former accountant was convicted of tax
fraud in connection with two loan transactions at Vernon
Savings. One transaction involved the financing of the yacht
"High Spirits," a vessel that was based in Washington, D.C.,
and frequented by congressmen, thrift executives and
lobbyists.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The accountant, Wellington O. Rothwell, was convicted late
Tuesday by a federal jury here on eight charges. His
investment partner, real estate salesman Rosswell H.
Westmoreland, was convicted of three charges. The charges
against both men, which included conspiracy, attempted tax
evasion and subscribing to false tax returns, were based on
the concealment of taxable commissions earned by Messrs.
Rothwell and Westmoreland in connection with the two Vernon
loan transactions.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys Barry Sorrels and Gary Udashen indicated
in court that they would ask for a new trial on behalf of
their clients, who are scheduled for sentencing Aug. 2. Mr.
Rothwell, 55 years old, faces a maximum possible sentence of
30 years in federal prison and a $500,000 fine. Mr.
Westmoreland, 42, could receive a maximum sentence of 13
years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>
<p>Mr. Dixon, who was indicted earlier this month, is
scheduled for trial Aug. 20 before U.S. District Judge A. Joe
Fish here. Mr. Dixon is charged with 38 separate counts
related to the allegedly improper reimbursement of Vernon
employees' expenditures for political contributions and
female escorts on thrift junkets. The charges aren't related
to those against Messrs. Rothwell and Westmoreland.</p>
<p>Federal thrift regulators took control of Vernon Savings
in 1987 and found that as much as 96% of its $1.2
billion-plus loan portfolio was in default.</p>
