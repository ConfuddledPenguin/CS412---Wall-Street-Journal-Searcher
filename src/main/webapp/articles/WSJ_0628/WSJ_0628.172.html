	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- BCE Inc., a telecommunications, manufacturing,
financial services and resources concern, said it agreed to
sell most of its 48.9% stake in Encor Inc., a Calgary,
Alberta, oil and gas company, to a group of investment
dealers for subsequent resale.
   After the stock market closed yesterday, BCE said it will
sell 14,850,600 units for seven Canadian dollars (US$5.97)
each to the dealers. Each unit consists of three Encor common
shares and two warrants. Each warrant entitles the holder to
purchase from BCE one Encor common share for C$2.65 until
Jan. 21, 1992.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>BCE said it holds 74,253,930 Encor common shares. Upon the
sale of the units, its holding in Encor would be reduced to
29,702,130 shares, or about 19.6%, prior to the exercise of
the warrants. If all the warrants were exercised, BCE said,
its stake would be reduced to less than 1%.</p>
<p>BCE said it continues to hold 29,850,000 Encor redeemable
convertible preferred shares. These shares are convertible
into 74,618,433 Encor common shares, or about 33% of the
total on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>BCE said the sale of the units is expected to close on or
about July 20. It said proceeds will be used principally to
reduce short-term debt. BCE said the transaction won't have
an immediate effect on earnings.</p>
<p>Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd. and RBC Dominion
Securities Inc., both based in Toronto, are co-managers of
the dealer group, BCE said.</p>
