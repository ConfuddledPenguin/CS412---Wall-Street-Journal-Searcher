	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed an omnibus housing bill
after a day of rancorous debate that centered more on the
regional inequities of the savings-and-loan bailout than on
the merits of housing legislation.
   The bill, approved 96-1 last night, is a compromise
reached Tuesday by the Bush administration and key senators.
But the floor debate quickly deviated to the S&L bailout as
several senators representing the Northeast and north-central
states charged that the bailout represented a transfer of
wealth from their states to the Southwest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"When was the last time New York had this kind of
assistance?" asked Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.) as he
brandished a copy of the federal water projects legislation
that he maintained was heavily weighted to Texas and other
Southern and Southwestern states. He answered: "When we built
the Erie Canal."</p>
<p>Yesterday's action continued the debate over who pays for,
and who benefits from, the $100 billion the U.S. expects to
spend on the thrift-industry cleanup, not including interest.</p>
<p>Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.) offered an amendment that
would target community-development funds to housing
jurisdictions based on a formula that takes into account the
amounts individual states will receive in the S&L bailout.
The D'Amato amendment was offered in response to an amendment
by Sen. Phil Gramm (R., Texas) that would allocate funds
based on population, similar to general revenue-sharing
programs that were largely scuttled during the Reagan
administration.</p>
<p>"To tie this to the savings-and-loan bailout is, pure and
simple, outrageous," Sen. Gramm said. "I have been offended
by the whole level of logic in this debate."</p>
<p>Sens. D'Amato and Gramm ultimately agreed to turn the
matter of the formula for community-development grants over
to Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, who is to study the current
formula and report his recommendations to the Senate by July
1, 1991.</p>
<p>At a news conference before the debate, Mr. Kemp called
the bill "the most significant step toward committing this
country on a bipartisan basis to combating the conditions of
homelessness, hopelessness, despair, and poverty that has
taken place in this town since the original War on Poverty."</p>
<p>The compromise bill calls for outlays of $18.1 billion in
fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1., $19.5 billion in fiscal
1992 and $21 billion in fiscal 1993. It includes agreement on
four major provisions that had kept the two sides haggling
for the past three weeks. The administration won on two of
the four major points, including what it hopes will be full
funding for a home-ownership initiative that would provide
funds for public housing tenants to purchase rather than rent
their homes or apartments. The administration also won
changes in the Federal Housing Administration
mortgage-insurance program to provide a stronger capital base
for the fund.</p>
<p>Additionally, agreements were reached on the eligibility
requirements for housing assistance, targeting more of the
funds to the very poor, and allowing housing jurisdictions to
fund new construction after they demonstrate special need for
new housing.</p>
<p>Secretary Kemp acknowledged that the funding levels in the
bill are subject to change. "It is obvious," he said, "that
the budget summit will have an impact, not only on the final
authorization, but the final appropriation of housing funds."</p>
<p>The House Banking Committee has approved a housing bill
that would be considerably more expensive than the Senate
version.</p>
