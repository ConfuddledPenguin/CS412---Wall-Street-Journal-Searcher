	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA - The Canadian government temporarily shelved its
Hibernia oil project spending bill because of growing
anti-Newfoundland sentiment in the wake of Canada's failed
constitutional talks.
   Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said the Hibernia
legislation has been postponed until the fall because a vote
now could have killed the bill.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed bill would authorize the government to
contribute 2.7 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.3 billion) in
grants and loan guarantees to develop the Hibernia oil field
offshore Newfoundland.</p>
<p>The government had planned to hold a vote on the spending
bill this week before it recesses for the summer holidays.
But it postponed the bill after several members of the Quebec
Parliament threatened to reject it in retaliation for
Newfoundland's failure last week to ratify the Meech Lake
accord.</p>
<p>The Meech Lake Accord, which was designed to meet Quebec's
minimum constitutional demands and diffuse separatist
sentiment in the largely French-speaking province, died when
the Newfoundland and Manitoba legislatures adjourned without
ratifying it.</p>
