	<p class="article-leader">MARINA DEL REY, Calif. -- L.A. Gear Inc. posted a 36% drop
in net income for the second quarter ended May 31 to $10.2
million, or 51 cents a share, in line with estimates it made
earlier this month.
   The drop from $16.1 million, or 91 cents a share, a year
earlier, represents the first decline in earnings for the
high-flying sneaker maker in three years. Sales, however,
were a record $225.4 million, up 33% from $169.6 million a
year earlier. Year-earlier per-share earnings were restated
for a 2-for-1 stock split in September.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>L.A. Gear shares climbed $1.125 to close at $27.25 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, after a
skittish Wall Street sent the stock price tumbling $1.375 a
share Tuesday on anticipation of the earnings release.</p>
<p>The company blamed the earnings drop on lower gross profit
margins, which were around 35%. L.A. Gear has been selling
more of its lower-priced, less-profitable shoes in an attempt
to gain market share. Earnings were also affected by
increased sales of L.A. Gear apparel and international
footwear sales, both of which have lower profit margins than
domestic footwear sales.</p>
<p>Company executives told shareholders at the annual meeting
here that profit margins should be better in the next two
quarters, as the company launches new and potentially more
profitable lines. The executives declined to be more specific
about earnings, however, saying the company doesn't make
projections.</p>
<p>The new footwear will include a highly touted line
promoted by singer Michael Jackson available for the
back-to-school season, and an expanded line of hiker-style
shoes. Robert Greenberg, chairman and chief executive
officer, also told shareholders that the company will
introduce an "inflatable Regulator" sneaker in the third
quarter to compete with Reebok International Ltd.'s
successful Pump basketball shoes, and a bouncy-soled
"catapult" shoe to compete with Nike Inc.'s Air shoes.</p>
<p>Incoming orders for the second quarter were about $400
million, up more than 50% from a year earlier, L.A. Gear
said. That, coupled with the "expected strong retail demand
for our new higher margin styles . . . should contribute to
renewed earnings increases in subsequent periods," Mr.
Greenberg said.</p>
<p>The company said earlier this month that with the drop in
second-quarter earnings, net income for the full year should
be "approximately equal to the low end" of analysts'
estimates, which at the time ranged from $4 to $4.50 a share,
compared with $3.01 a share for fiscal 1989.</p>
<p>In the first six months, net rose 13% to $24.1 million, or
$1.20 a share, from $21.4 million, or $1.23 a share adjusted
for the stock split, while sales jumped 75% to $412.7 million
from $235.7 million.</p>
<p>L.A. Gear also said it will increase its annual
advertising and promotions budget about 8%. The company had
planned to spend more than $50 million this year, up from
$36.3 million the prior year.</p>
