	<p class="article-leader">THE JUSTICES UPHELD broadcast-licensing programs favoring
minorities.
   By a 5-4 vote, the high court ruled for the first time
that Congress may authorize affirmative action, not simply to
correct effects of past discrimination, but to promote other
goals, such as racial and ethnic diversity. The ruling upheld
two FCC policies -- adopted by the agency but later ratified
by Congress -- that give minority-owned and women-owned firms
preference in vying for broadcast licenses. Also by a 5-4
vote, the court made it more difficult for citizens' groups
to challenge federal land-use and environmental policies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In another decision, the justices ruled that states may
permit alleged victims of child abuse to testify through
indirect methods intended to avoid the trauma of having to
face defendants in court.</p>

<p>NASA FOUND a focusing flaw in mirrors aboard the Hubble
Space Telescope.</p>
<p>As a result, the $2.5 billion orbital telescope won't be
able to perform many of its planned scientific experiments.
Space agency officials said they had discovered that one, or
possibly both, of the telescope's mirrors was flawed during
manufacturing. The agency failed to detect the problem during
years of testing on the ground of the telescope, launched in
April by the space shuttle Discovery.</p>
<p>NASA is hoping that a replacement camera, which is due to
be launched by the shuttle in about three years, will be able
to correct for the mirror's flaws.</p>

<p>Iraq's President Hussein said another war is "inevitable"
in the Mideast unless the U.S. blocks what he sees as
aggressive policies by Israel's new government to drive
Palestinians from their land and to dominate the Arab world.
"We shall respond to an Israeli attack whenever it comes and
wherever," he said.</p>

<p>The Senate passed an omnibus housing bill following a day
of rancorous debate that centered more on the regional
inequities of the savings-and-loan bailout than on the merits
of housing legislation. The bill, approved 96-1, is a
compromise between the Bush administration and key senators.</p>
<p>The House approved a foreign-operations bill totaling more
than $15.6 billion that would reduce U.S. arms assistance
outside of the Middle East by nearly 13% in fiscal 1991 and
also withhold one-half of El Salvador's new military
assistance after Oct. 1.</p>

<p>The NRC announced guidelines to raise the amount of mildly
radioactive waste and other material that is exempt from
regulation. The approach is designed to give the agency a
framework for granting blanket exemptions to consumer
products and low-level radioactive waste, as well as such
activities as decontaminating reactors.</p>

<p>The Soviet Union's ideology chief stated that it is
unlikely next week's pivotal Communist gathering in Moscow
will be postponed or will turn against Soviet President
Gorbachev. Politburo ideologist Medvedev also said the
platform to be proposed to the congress has been reworked in
response to criticism from both the left and right.</p>

<p>Mandela praised slain civil-rights activist King in
Atlanta, but the South African black nationalist leader
refused to adopt King's nonviolent approach in the struggle
for black rights. Local civic leaders staged a jubilant
welcome for Mandela in the city, which became the cradle of
the U.S. civil-rights movement under King's leadership.</p>

<p>Fifty more aftershocks rumbled through northern Iran,
shaking buildings and killing a relief worker who was trying
to dig out bodies buried under debris by last week's
earthquake. Bad weather was blamed for the crash of a relief
helicopter in Gilan province. Tens of thousands of homeless
people took shelter in makeshift tent cities.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A federal appeals court ruled that the HHS improperly
rejected thousands of heart-disease patients who applied for
disability benefits. The decision will require the department
to reconsider the applications of at least 150,000 New York
residents, according to state officials.</p>

<p>An ex-model testified she used cocaine, marijuana and
opium with Washington's Mayor Barry "over 100 times" and that
he once told her he was addicted to cocaine. Appearing at
Barry's drug and perjury trial, Rasheeda Moore said they had
a sexual relationship and shared drugs between 1986 and 1988.
She aided the FBI in his arrest.</p>

<p>East-West arms negotiators agreed to limit the number of
tanks and armored combat vehicles in NATO and the Warsaw
Pact, delegates said. One Western diplomat at the Vienna
talks on reducing conventional forces in Europe said
agreement on the two weapons categories represented "a very
major step" toward an overall accord.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>A West German businessman received a five-year prison
sentence for helping Libya to build a plant suspected of
producing poison gas. A Mannheim regional court found Juergen
Hippenstiel-Imhausen guilty of violating export laws and tax
evasion by sending equipment to Libya for construction of the
facility at Rabta near Tripoli.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Montreal neurologists reported that the first potential
treatment for muscular dystrophy passed early safety tests,
offering a glimpse of the kind of dramatic payoffs that might
come from mapping the 50,000 to 100,000 genes in the human
genome. The effectiveness of the experimental treatment,
however, isn't known.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The Peace Corps is withdrawing its 261 volunteers from the
Philippines and suspending work there because of fears that
communist rebels may kill or kidnap them. The New People's
Army guerrillas have vowed to step up attacks on U.S. targets
as part of a campaign to force removal of U.S. military bases
from the Philippines.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Armed vigilantes patrolled Zambia's capital and soldiers
held people at gunpoint in a stadium to try to stop the worst
rioting in the nation's history. At least 23 people were
reported killed in the violence, which was sparked by
increases in food prices.</p>
