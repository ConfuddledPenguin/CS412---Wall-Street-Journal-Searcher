of intent to form a joint venture with
Creditanstalt-Bankverein, the Viennese commercial and
investment bank, to provide futures brokerage services to
central and Eastern European investors.
   The Chicago futures and brokerage firm, a subsidiary of
Rodman & Renshaw Capital Group Inc., said the joint venture,
CA Global Futures AG, would be 70%-owned by the bank and
30%-owned by Rodman. In a related transaction, the bank will
invest $5 million in the brokerage firm in return for 4.99%
of Rodman & Renshaw Capital Group's stock and some
subordinated debentures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both transactions are subject to the signing of a
definitive agreement and regulatory approval. The
transactions are expected to be completed by Sept. 30.</p>
<p>Kurt Karmin, Rodman & Renshaw Inc.'s chairman and chief
executive officer, said the $5 million, which isn't required
to fund the firm's existing or planned operations, will be
used to retire existing debt.</p>
<p>Jerome de Bontin, a managing director of Rodman & Renshaw
Inc.'s financial futures department, will be co-managing
director of the joint venture, based in Vienna. The bank will
choose the other co-managing director.</p>
