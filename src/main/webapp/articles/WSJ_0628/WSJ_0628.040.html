	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Delegates to an international government
conference agreed on most details for creation of a $160
million global fund to protect the world's ozone layer.
   The fund, to be managed by the World Bank and two United
Nations agencies, will help developing nations start
converting their industries to ozone-friendly technologies.
As the first large fund targeted at a specific global
environmental ill, the fund may become a model for how the
world will finance such other problems as the threat of
global warming and the loss of species.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We are establishing a new political mechanism to deal
with the environmental crisis," said Mostafa Tolba, executive
director of the United Nations Environment Program.</p>
<p>The fund will pay the first three years of developing
countries' efforts to phase out use of chlorofluorocarbons,
or CFCs, halons and carbon tetrachloride -- all man-made
chemicals, used in refrigerators, air conditioners, spray
cans and factories -- which eat away the atmosphere's
protective layer of ozone gas. The developed nations, which
represent 85% of world consumption of these chemicals, are
expected to agree here tomorrow to ban usage by either 1997
or 2000. The world's developing nations will have an extra
decade to ban the substances, but say they will still need
financial help from the fund to adopt ozone-friendly
substitutes.</p>
