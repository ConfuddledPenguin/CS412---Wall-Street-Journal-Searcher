	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The more bond and stock investors thought
about President Bush's willingness to do anything -- even
raise some taxes -- to trim the U.S. budget deficit, the more
they liked it.
   Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices rose nearly 3/8 of a
point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount, though trading
was light. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 19.80 to
close at 2862.13, also in light trading. The dollar rose
against the mark but fell against the yen; most of the action
was in such high-yield currencies as the British pound and
Canadian and Australian dollars.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The general impression left by the statement the president
made Tuesday morning was that any economic harm from higher
taxes wouldn't be immediate and that the Federal Reserve
Board might ease interest rates if a deficit-cutting package
nears congressional approval.</p>
<p>Helping bond prices rise was yesterday's surprisingly
successful auction of U.S. Treasury four-year notes. Demand
outstripped the supply by a large enough margin that
investors' worries about a glut of government debt were
eased.</p>
<p>Robert Smentkowski, a bond trader at Security Pacific
National Bank in Los Angeles, said prices rose shortly after
1 p.m. Eastern time when rumors circulated that the note
auction had gone well. The market already had been rising
because of a growing sense that politicians "seemed to be
serious about talking about reducing the deficit," Mr.
Smentkowski said.</p>
<p>The bond rally helped push stocks higher, with investors
continuing to buy the so-called defensive stocks of companies
with secure earnings, said Philip Eagan, co-managing director
of institutional services at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.</p>
<p>The industrial average would have been higher if American
Telephone & Telegraph shares hadn't been trounced after news
that the company expects lower second-quarter earnings than
many analysts had anticipated. But unlike similar
disappointments earlier in the week, AT&T's news didn't scare
investors out of other stocks. One reason, Mr. Eagan said,
was that analysts saw good news for AT&T's rivals in its
profit troubles.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose on volume of 146.6 million shares in New
York Stock Exchange trading. Advancing issues outnumbered
decliners, 851-597.</p>
<p>Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond eased to 8.48%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6645 marks and 154.45 yen, compared
with 1.6630 marks and 154.67 yen late Tuesday.</p>
