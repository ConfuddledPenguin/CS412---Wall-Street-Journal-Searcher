	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Treasury's sale of four-year notes was a
big hit with investors yesterday and helped to pull the bond
market out of the summer doldrums.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended nearly 3/8
point higher, a gain of about $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. Tax-exempt, corporate and asset-backed
securities were lifted by the momentum of the rising Treasury
market and ended with gains of between 1/8 point and 1/4
point.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the auction, the Treasury sold $8.31 billion of
four-year notes at an average yield of 8.50%. Unlike the
Treasury's moderately successful sale of $11.25 billion
two-year notes on Tuesday, yesterday's four-year sale was
considered a blockbuster.</p>
<p>"It was a very strong auction," said Michael Moore,
manager of government trading at Continental Bank, Chicago.
"There was significantly more demand for the four-year note
than the dealer community anticipated," he said.</p>
<p>The Treasury said it received $44.78 billion of bids for
the $8.31 billion of bonds it sold, or 5.39 bids for each bid
accepted. That was the highest ever "bid-to-cover" ratio at a
four-year note sale and it far surpassed the previous record
bid-to-cover ratio of 5.07-to-1 set at the October 1985
four-year note sale, according to Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</p>
<p>William Brachfeld, executive vice president at Daiwa
Securities America Inc., the U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Daiwa
Securities Co., said the bidding was so strong that many
dealers received smaller allotments of the four-year notes
than needed to fill customer orders. He said that dealers who
placed bids at the winning 8.50% yield had expected to
receive at least 50% of the bonds they requested. Instead, he
said they will get just 20%.</p>
<p>There were rumors that one institutional investor in the
Middle East purchased $2.5 billion of the four-year notes
through a New York-based primary dealer. That may have
accounted for the larger-than-expected demand.</p>
<p>Just after the auction, "the Street pretty much knew there
was a big buyer," said Michael T. Moran, manager of
government trading at Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities
Corp.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, investors from the Middle East have
re-emerged as major players in the U.S. Treasury market and
have been dumping commodities such as gold and reinvesting
the proceeds into the U.S. and British bond markets. At the
same time, many Japanese investors, who had been big buyers
of Treasury bonds, are pulling back.</p>
<p>Daiwa's Mr. Brachfeld said that Japanese participation in
the U.S. Treasury market has been light for most of this
year. "The bottom line is that figures show that Japanese
investors have been net sellers," of U.S. Treasury securities
and not net buyers, he said.</p>
<p>Trading activity in the bond market picked up shortly
after the auction results were announced as dealers scrambled
to buy four-year notes and bonds with other maturities on the
secondary market.</p>
<p>That buying helped to push down the yield of the new
four-year notes in when-issued activity to 8.45%, well below
their auction average.</p>
<p>Beyond the rumored buying by the large Middle Eastern
investor, dealers said demand for the new four-year notes was
stimulated by growing optimism that the federal government's
efforts to pare the federal budget deficit will be
successful.</p>
<p>Although there was no fresh news on the budget talks,
dealers said investors were heartened by President Bush's
statement Tuesday indicating that tax increases are needed to
shrink the deficit.</p>
<p>"Some optimism that the budget talks will lead to cuts in
the budget deficit contributed to the buying at the auction
as well as the overall positive tone in the bond market,"
said James Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman
Government Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Despite the favorable four-year note auction and increased
hopes that the budget deficit will be reduced, dealers warn
against expecting any steep gains in bond prices in the near
term.</p>
<p>Caution ahead of the July 6 release of the June employment
report is likely to put a damper on trading activity, they
said.</p>
<p>"I don't think we'll be in a terrific up trend until we
get through the employment report," said DLJ's Mr. Moran.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of 102 26/32
to yield 8.48% compared with a price of 102 15/32 to yield
8.51% on Tuesday. The latest 10-year notes ended at a price
of 102 11/32 to yield 8.50% compared with 102 5/32 to yield
8.53%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates were a little lower. The discount rate on
three-month bills ended at 7.78% for a bond-equivalent yield
of 8.025% while the rate on six-month bills ended at 7.67% to
yield 8.068%.</p>
<p>In the agency market, the Federal Farm Credit Banks
Funding Corp. priced $3.07 billion of short-term securities.
The bonds were priced at par to yield 8.15% for three-months,
8.20% for six-months and 8.30% for one year.</p>
<p>Here are details of the Treasury's four-year note auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.</p>
<p> Applications                $44,779,849,000</p>
<p> Accepted bids                $8,313,399,000</p>
<p> Accepted at low price                   20%</p>
<p> Accepted noncompetitively      $796,000,000</p>
<p> Average price (Rate)        100.000 (8.50%)</p>
<p> High price (Rate)           100.033 (8.49%)</p>
<p> Low price (Rate)            100.000 (8.50%)</p>
<p> Interest rate                        8 1/2%</p>
<p>The notes are dated July 2, 1990 and mature June 30, 1994.</p>
<p>Junk Bonds</p>
<p>The bonds of casinos operated by developer Donald Trump
were again the main focus of the junk-bond market.</p>
<p>The bonds, which have gyrated wildly in recent weeks,
surged again yesterday on news that Mr. Trump was able to
meet some junk-bond interest payments.</p>
<p>Trump Taj Mahal Funding Inc.'s 14% first-mortgage bonds,
due in 1998, finished at 52 5/8, up 1 1/8 points. Trump
Castle Funding Inc.'s 13.75% bond rose 1/2 point to 61 1/2.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Trump still faces a staggering debt burden,
one junk-bond trader said his debt payment on the Castle
bonds "removes some near-term uncertainty," and helped buoy
other Trump bonds.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. continued to climb and
now are trading near par. One junk-bond trader said some RJR
debentures have picked up nearly 20 points since falling to
their lows last November.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>British government bonds fell sharply as the pound eased
against the West German mark.</p>
<p>Traders said the value of sterling began to weaken late
Tuesday after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher voiced doubts
about the effectiveness of fixed exchange-rate systems,
although it wasn't clear whether Mrs. Thatcher was referring
to the European Community's current exchange-rate accord.</p>
<p>In light of the confusion, the value of the pound was
quoted late yesterday at 2.8975 marks, down from 2.9135 late
Tuesday. In bond trading, Britain's 11.75% bellwether bond
due 2003/2007 fell 26/32 to 102 25/32 to yield 11.32%.</p>
<p>In Canada, the bond market continued to recover from the
drubbing of recent weeks. The benchmark 10.5% 10-year bond
was quoted late at a price of 99.050, up 0.80 percentage
point to yield 10.66%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities prices finished with modest
gains yesterday.</p>
<p>Helping to support price levels is the relatively light
new supply in the mortgage-backed sector.</p>
<p>The only mortgage-backed deal announced yesterday was a
$200 million issue of Federal National Mortgage Association
real estate mortgage investment conduit securities.</p>
<p>The securities, offered by Kidder, Peabody & Co., are
collateralized with 8.5% Fannie Mae securities.</p>
<p>Coupon rates ranged from zero percent on a principal-only
class to an initial rate of 9.21250% on a floating-rate class
that is priced over the one-month London Interbank Offered
Rate and reset monthly.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association 9.5% securities
for July delivery were up 7/32 at 99 to yield 9.78%.</p>
<p>Among other actively traded mortgage securities in the
secondary market, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5%
securities for July delivery were up 7/32 at 98 11/32 and
Fannie Mae 9.5% securities for July delivery were also up
7/32, at 98 27/32.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Among new issues, the state of Maryland issued $95 million
of general-obligation bonds priced to yield from 6.10% for
three-year notes to 6.90% for 15-year bonds.</p>
<p>Retail investors, rather than institutions, were the big
buyers of the GOs, according to lead underwriter Marine
Midland Capital Markets. The strong retail interest may be
tied to high credit quality; Maryland is one of only eight
states that carries a triple-A credit rating.</p>
