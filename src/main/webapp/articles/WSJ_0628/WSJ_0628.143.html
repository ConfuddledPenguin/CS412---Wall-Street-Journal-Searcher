	<p class="article-leader">Air Products & Chemicals Inc., Allentown, Pa., said it
acquired a 49% interest in Sapio Industrie, an Italian
producer of industrial gases with annual revenue of about
$100 million.
   Terms weren't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The acquisition of the Sapio stake follows a string of
other European investments made by Air Products since the
mid-1980s that total more than $500 million. In April, for
example, Air Products increased its stake in Carburos
Metalicos, the largest industrial gas supplier in Spain and
Portugal, to about 30%. The expansion effort in Europe has
effectively doubled the company's asset base there.</p>
<p>The company said four Air Products executives, including
two European vice presidents and the general manager of the
company's own Milan-based operation, will become members of
Sapio's nine-member board.</p>
