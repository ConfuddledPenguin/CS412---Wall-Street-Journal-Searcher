	<p class="article-leader">SCHAUMBURG, Ill. -- Motorola Inc. said a federal appeals
court in Washington, D.C., issued a stay pending appeal of a
lower court's order enjoining sale of certain microchips.
   The chips at stake are microprocessors or
computers-on-a-chip, made by Motorola and its rival Hitachi
Ltd. of Japan, which have been embroiled in an 18-month
patent infringement dispute.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The two companies earlier this week said they had agreed
on a framework for negotiating an out-of-court settlement.
Motorola wouldn't comment on the talks, but Hitachi has said
it is hopeful an agreement can be reached in two or three
months.</p>
