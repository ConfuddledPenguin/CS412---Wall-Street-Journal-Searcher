	<p class="article-leader">New York -- No matter what else happened, the day wouldn't
be a total loss for Joanne Shapiro. She'd barely arrived at a
Broadway studio to audition for the Trump Girl, the name
given the hostess of "Trump Card," a syndicated game show
named after you know who debuting this fall, and wow (there's
no business like show business), she bumped smack into Robert
Goulet. "I'm doy-ing," gasped the 28-year-old who was wearing
blond hair and a short off-the-shoulder black dress. "He's
still very good looking. I gave him a kiss and my picture."
   Meeting Mr. Goulet was an omen of good things to come,
figured Ms. Shapiro. That and the fact that she knew Donald
Trump's mother. Knew her personally. "And she is a DOLL,"
enthused Ms. Shapiro, who runs Blondie's, a Jamaica, Queens,
boutique patronized by Mother Trump. "But the store is just a
side thing. I've seen Donald," she added. "He's always
dressed very nice."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to Thomas L. Cantone, vice president of
entertainment for Trump Atlantic City Properties. "Trump
Card," which will be taped at Trump Castle Hotel and Casino,
is modeled after "Full House," a Bingo-style game show that
had a successful run on British TV. Its American developer,
Lorimar Television, which claims a commitment from 90
stations so far, made a presentation to Mr. Cantone, who in
turn pitched the idea to Mr. Trump. "He liked it
immediately," noted Mr. Cantone, one of four judges at the
session.</p>
<p>"We didn't want to restrict ourselves," he said of the
decision to make the audition an open call. "We wanted to
give everyone a chance to be seen."</p>
<p>Admittedly, the judges were not quite sure what they
wanted in a hostess. It came down to a certain gleam in the
eye, a certain intangible something, a certain Vanna-be
quality. "You'd like friendliness and warmth," said Barbara
Miller, a Lorimar senior vice president, who would capture on
videotape those women whose friendliness and warmth merited a
second look.</p>
<p>"We really have no idea what we're looking for but I know
what we're not looking for. I don't want someone who's hard
looking. I don't want a show girl. We know we want somebody
pretty. And you'd like a little intelligence."</p>
<p>While Ms. Miller acknowledged that there is little overlap
between the skills required for the Trump Girl and those
required for, say, rocket science, "this is not as easy as
everyone thinks," she insisted. "While you're just standing
there you have to look like you're doing something. What
Vanna White has is that she'll stand there but she's really
involved," said Ms. Miller. "She's excited for the
contestant."</p>
<p>During the two-day screening, the judges learned a few
things. They learned that hope springs eternal in the female
breast and that the delicatessen down the street is incapable
of getting a lunch order straight. They also learned the
utility of keeping their facial expressions as bland as
American cheese. This last skill came in especially handy
when the panel was confronted by a 50-year-old in tap shoes
who did a soft shoe and listed four different names on her
application: her acting name, her poetry-writing name, her
dancing name and her holistic name. "There's no reason the
Trump Girl can't be an old lady," she said, shuffling off to
Buffalo. "She doesn't have to be young."</p>
<p>Three by three the women came in, some clutching
professionally shot 8-by-10 glossies, some carrying snapshots
taken by their next of kin. Mostly they were would-be models
and actresses anxious to shake hands with whoever seemed the
most influential member of the paper-shuffling panel.</p>
<p>There was a card dealer from Trump Castle, looking for a
job upgrade and a third-grade teacher in a turquoise dress
that hugged her body until it cried "Uncle."</p>
<p>"My third-grade teacher never looked liked that," said
Trump Castle's Mr. Cantone as the educator tottered out in
her purple pumps.</p>
<p>Next came a recent high school graduate and a college
freshman to whom Ms. Miller stressed the importance of a good
education. And there was a woman, who, as she explained, was
not a model, actress, dancer or singer but rather a
production assistant from Philadelphia. "I called in sick to
come here," said the woman, whose makeup was by
Sherwin-Williams and whose name is being witheld for the sake
of her continued employment in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The demands on the finalists would be more onerous --
they'd participate in a mock run-through of "Trump Card" with
its host, former Miami Dolphins football star Jimmy Cefalo --
but the open call was a cakewalk. Applicants were asked how
they heard about the job (they read about it in "Variety"),
whether it sounded interesting (they said it did). Then they
were asked to do an about face -- "so we can see how pretty
you look," said Ms. Miller -- walk toward the mirrors and
execute a turn. Admittedly, this turning business confounded
some of the girls who weren't sure in which direction to
turn, what to do with their arms while they were turning or
what to do once they successfully negotiated the turn.</p>
<p>"That's it. Thank you so much. We'll let you know," Ms.
Miller said smoothly except on those few occasions when she
wanted to put someone on videotape. "I came all the way from
Long Island for this," mourned one contestant who didn't make
the cut.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go home and beat somebody up," said Ms.
Miller after nodding yet another warm farewell to yet another
trio of women so unappealing it was doubtful that even the
tide would take them out. "This is spoiling me for open
calls."</p>
<p>Out in the reception area, there was much speculation
about what the job entailed. "I think it would be a lot of
dealing with people one-on-one," said Stephanie Milewski, 21,
who views dealing with people one-on-one as one of her
principal strengths.</p>
<p>"It sounds like a Vanna White thing," said model Shay
Hunter.</p>
<p>"I hope it entails more responsibility than she has," said
one responsible-looking actress.</p>
<p>"I don't think Vanna's so great," said Joanne Shapiro.</p>
<p>Rumor had it that Donald Trump himself -- schedule and
creditors permitting -- would breeze by to have a look at
prospective Trump Girls and offer his two cents. Although
many of those questioned professed a lack of interest in the
man and his millions and his recent financial troubles,
appearances told a different story. There were enough Marla
Maples and Ivana look-a-likes to fill Trump Tower. "He's like
a character out of a novel Jackie Collins would write," noted
a dazzling blond model, Sheri Montgomery ("as in Ward,
General and Elizabeth"), "Millions, billions, wife, children,
mistress . . ."</p>
<p>"Do you think he is looking for Marla?" asked a
dark-haired young woman."Maybe I'd better just go home."</p>
<p>"Being blond helps," believed blond Sharon O'Brien. "He
likes blondes, doesn't he? That's what I hear." (As a matter
of fact, Southern brunette Debi Massey prevailed in the end.)</p>
<p>What would the women say to Mr. Trump if he walked in
right this very minute and joined the judge's panel? "Nice to
meet you," said Ms. Montgomery.</p>
<p>"Go ahead, Donald, choose me," said actress Tanesha Gary,
opting for a direct approach to the art of the deal. "You
know I'm who you want."</p>
