   For PCs on the Go</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ALTHOUGH MANY computers weigh only a few pounds, marketing
types on the road may lug around 50 pounds of computer
equipment. Many simply can't do without color screens, which
are available only on bulky, desktop machines.</p>
<p>Now, some tired arms may get needed relief, as a few
companies have announced laptops with impressive color
screens that weigh in the 15-to-20-pound range.</p>
<p>Dolch Computer Systems of San Jose, Calif., and Dauphin
Technology of Lombard, Ill., both recently announced systems,
available this fall, that use screens from Hitachi Ltd. The
U.S. arm of Sharp Corp., in Mahwah, N.J., has demonstrated a
system that it says should be available by the end of the
year. Consultants add that at least a couple of other
companies will introduce color laptops by the fall, and such
systems will be widely available by next spring.</p>
<p>There are still drawbacks, of course. The screens are
expensive, adding as much as $4,000 to the cost of a laptop.
Even as prices fall over the next year, systems with color
screens will probably carry a $1,000 to $1,500 premium. In
addition, the systems weigh far more than the four to six
pounds of so-called notebook computers -- a weight that more
customers are coming to expect. They also consume so much
power that they can't run on batteries, meaning an umbilical
cord must still attach the systems to a wall socket.</p>
<p>The limitations mean that the systems will initially be
bought only by the truly weary. But at least they're a start.</p>
<p>Help Arrives to Deliver</p>
<p>Satisfied Customers</p>
<p>CUSTOMERS RARELY understand why they must set aside a
whole day to get that new couch delivered -- or how the
delivery person manages to always come right after they've
ducked out for a short errand.</p>
<p>But an energy utility has produced a system that should at
least narrow that window during which delivery or service is
promised. The system should also ensure that calls are made
only when someone is home.</p>
<p>The system, called C-ARDS and marketed by CNG Energy Co.
of Pittsburgh, involves attaching a small computer terminal
to the radio in each service van. When getting set to go to
the next stop, the driver puts the cursor on the customer's
name and hits a button. The radio transmits the name to a
central computer, which calls the home and plays a message
saying that the service person will arrive within a few
minutes. If no one picks up the phone, the visit is
rescheduled.</p>
<p>Because the driver checks in after finishing each job,
that also helps the central office keep track of who's where
at what time. Cox Cable Cleveland Area Inc., a unit of Cox
Enterprises Inc. and a test site for the CNG system, says
C-ARDS has let it narrow the window during which it promises
service to roughly three hours from four. The system also
lets the cable-TV company call customers during the day of
installation or repair and give them more precise estimates.</p>
<p>"It's working," says Ron Hammaker, general manager of Cox
Cable Cleveland.</p>
<p>Now if that couch could just come on a Saturday.</p>
<p>One Little Chip Spells</p>
<p>A Lot More Capacity</p>
<p>THE DAYS are long gone when having any sort of hard disk
in a personal computer was considered a luxury. These days,
many PCs have hard disks that can store 320 megabytes of
data, and some even surpass a gigabyte -- a billion
characters of data, or enough capacity to store as many Great
American Novels as most people would ever care to write.</p>
<p>But consumers thirst for capacity, so computer makers try
to stuff bigger and bigger disk drives in their machines.</p>
<p>InfoChip Systems Inc., a small company in Santa Clara,
Calif., says it has an easy way to increase capacity, and
without bigger disk drives: It has a chip that it says will
roughly triple the capacity of current disk drives.</p>
<p>InfoChip will sell the chip on a $199 circuit board, which
buyers can simply plug into their existing PCs to instantly
add bytes. The company also hopes to sell the chip to PC
makers, which can build them into their computers,
inexpensively enlarging capacity.</p>
<p>The chip operates by doing very fast compression of data
when the PC is trying to write on the hard disk and,
conversely, rapid decompression when the central processor is
trying to read data. InfoChip says the chip shouldn't slow
the system; writing data can take longer, but reading data
can be done faster.</p>
<p>John Murphy, a consultant at Wohl & Associates, Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., who saw the chip demonstrated at the Comdex
trade show this month, says: "This is the most interesting
thing I've seen at Comdex in years."</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>THE PIPE ORGAN at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris has
been a group undertaking for centuries, with the organist
hopping around to the various keyboards while assistants work
the stops that help control them. Complicating things
further, it can take seconds for a keystroke to work its way
through the instrument and reach the huge pipes. Now, an IBM
PC is being wired into the works, letting the organist
program the positions of the stops ahead of time and
eliminate the delay in the sounds. . . . A chemistry journal
edited at the University of California-Santa Cruz not only is
distributed on floppy disks: Tetrahedron Computer
Methodology, published by Pergamon Press, includes software
on the disks that do such things as draw 3-D molecules and
rotate them on-screen to demonstrate a point.</p>
