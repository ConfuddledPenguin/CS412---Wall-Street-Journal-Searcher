	<p class="article-leader">The first potential treatment for muscular dystrophy
passed early safety tests and offered a glimpse of the kind
of payoffs that might come from mapping the 50,000 to 100,000
genes in the human genome. The effectiveness of the
treatment, however, isn't known.
   Neurologists in Montreal said that doses of normal muscle
cells had been safely and successfully injected into a single
afflicted arm muscle of each of three boys with muscular
dystrophy. Seven other boys will receive the experimental
treatment in coming months. All the boys are aged six to
eight years and are suffering the early stages of muscular
dystrophy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The injected normal cells, it is hoped, will supply a
muscle protein, the lack of which is the cause of the
relentless deterioration of the muscles that is the hallmark
of muscular dystrophy.</p>
<p>It will be several months before the Canadian researchers
can determine whether the injected muscle cells will produce
the protein and whether the protein will stop or reverse the
steady weakening of the surrounding muscle. Effectiveness
will be judged by comparing, in each boy, the strength of the
biceps in the treated arm with the strength of the biceps in
the opposing arm which received only injections of salt
water.</p>
<p>"For the first time in a large muscle, we've determined
that the procedure is feasible as well as safe," neurologist
George Karpati of the Montreal Neurological Institute
reported on behalf of a team involving scientists from five
Canadian medical institutions.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview, Dr. Karpati said many
researchers had been skeptical that the experiment could be
done. The Canadian team, he explained, had now shown that it
is possible to take a few immature muscle cells and culture
them in the test tube to produce millions of copies. Each boy
received up to 55 injections of one million copies each of
his father's myoblasts, which are immature muscle cells.</p>
<p>The first three boys receiving the injections also showed
that the procedure was free of the adverse effects that some
researchers had feared, Dr. Karpati said.</p>
<p>The Montreal announcement differs from a similar report
made early this month by researchers at the University of
Tennessee in that it involves a much larger muscle. The
Tennessee scientists injected normal muscle cells into a
small foot muscle of eight boys with the disorder. The
treated muscle controls the big toe; the first of the eight
boys to be treated has experienced a slight increase in
strength of the treated toe, the researchers reported.</p>
<p>The technique, technically known as myoblast transfer,
also will be tried this summer by research teams in Boston
and San Francisco.</p>
<p>The unprecedented advance against muscular dystrophy now
under way is giving impetus to the organized effort to locate
and identify all 50,000 to 100,000 human genes, an effort
known as the human genome project. Scientists say muscular
dystrophy is the first and most dramatic example of how gene
mapping can lead to the conquest of a genetic disease.</p>
<p>Although muscular dystrophy was first recognized as a
distinct disorder in the 1870s, its cause baffled scientists
for more than a century. They knew only that it was caused by
a defective gene that was inherited from the mother and that
it showed up almost exclusively in boys.</p>
<p>In the early 1980s, new techniques for locating and
identifying, or "mapping," unknown genes began to emerge from
biology laboratories. In the summer of 1983, the Muscular
Dystrophy Association, which is best known for its annual
Jerry Lewis Telethon, picked three teams of scientists to use
the new gene-mapping techniques for a $5 million crash search
for the muscular dystrophy gene.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1986, the team at Boston's Children's
Hospital, led by molecular geneticist Louis Kunkel, found the
muscular dystrophy gene, edging out by only a few months a
competing team at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.
Within a year, the Boston researchers found that the normal
version of the defective muscular dystrophy gene produced a
protein that they dubbed dystrophin.</p>
<p>It was quickly discovered that boys suffering the most
common and severest form of the disease, Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, completely lacked dystrophin, while those with a
milder form, Becker muscular dystrophy, had defective
versions of the protein.</p>
<p>What dystrophin normally does in muscle tissues and how
its lack leads to the muscle deterioration seen in muscular
dystrophy isn't known. But dystrophin's clear link to the
disease led to the current experiments to see if
transplanting normal dystrophin-producing muscle cells will
prevent the deterioration of particular muscles in afflicted
boys.</p>
<p>If the transplanted cells "take" and their dystrophin does
in fact stem the destruction of the surrounding bicep muscle,
researchers would still have to figure out how to treat the
entire patient rather than a single muscle. "The next phase
would be to go on and try to inject multiple muscles,"
particularly the muscles involved in breathing, walking and
arm movements, Dr. Karpati said.</p>
