	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Democrats, trying to reciprocate for
President Bush's statement that tax increases are needed to
reduce the deficit, began offering possible cuts in popular
government benefit programs at bipartisan budget talks.
   "Tit for tat," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser (D., Tenn.). "They talked about their sensitive point
yesterday -- taxes. We talked about our sensitive point --
entitlements."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Rep. Leon Panetta (D., Calif.), chairman of the House
Budget Committee, listed a host of ways to trim spending on
entitlement programs, including Medicare, federal employee
pensions and agricultural spending. Programs for the poor
weren't mentioned, but participants said there was discussion
-- though no agreement -- about increasing federal income
taxes on Social Security benefits paid to upper-income
Americans.</p>
<p>The Democratic proposals would trim spending on
entitlements less than President Bush and Republican
congressional negotiators have suggested. Negotiators are
aiming at a $50 billion reduction in next year's projected
deficit. The Republicans want entitlement cuts of $10 billion
or more.</p>
<p>Despite the continuing differences, budget negotiators
yesterday engaged in what House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt (D., Mo.) described as a "freewheeling" discussion
of other ways to cut entitlement spending.</p>
<p>Republicans, even those who have criticized the Democrats
recently, went out of their way to praise them yesterday.
"We're moving in the right direction," said Sen. Phil Gramm
(R., Texas).</p>
<p>When the budget talks resumed yesterday after a break of
several days there was a markedly different atmosphere, which
both sides attributed to Mr. Bush's statement on Tuesday that
"tax revenue increases" are needed to reduce the deficit.</p>
<p>"The climate in there is pretty good -- for obvious
reasons," agreed Sen. Wyche Fowler (D., Ga.).</p>
<p>"The whole tenor has changed. It is very determined," said
Sen. Pete Domenici (R., N.M.). "Whatever it was that kept us
from . . . seriously talking seems to have left the scene."</p>
<p>One sign that the talks have moved into a more serious
phase was a demand from the Senate Finance Committee that it
and the House Ways and Means Committee, rather than summit
negotiators, decide what taxes to increase. But others,
including the administration and congressional negotiators
who don't sit on the tax-writing panels, insisted that the
outlines of a tax increase be shaped at the summit table.</p>
<p>"We're going to work in tandem," said Senate Finance
Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas).</p>
