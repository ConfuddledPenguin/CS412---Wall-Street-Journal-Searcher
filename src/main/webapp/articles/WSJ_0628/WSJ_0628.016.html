	<p class="article-leader">DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. said it plans to invest
$95 million to modernize its Dearborn Glass Plant.
   A main element of the plan is replacement of two of the
automotive windshield making operations with highly automated
in-line processes, Ford said. Plans call for first line to be
fully operational in the fall of 1991 and the second line
about a year later. The company also plans a major rebuilding
of the plant's Float Furnace facility, beginning in October
1991, and a 77,000-square-foot building expansion.</p>
