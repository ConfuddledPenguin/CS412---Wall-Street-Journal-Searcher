	<p class="article-leader">French auto maker Peugeot S.A. said it expects
consolidated revenue for 1990 to exceed the 7.9% gain it
reported for the first quarter, when sales totaled 44.14
billion francs ($7.90 billion).
   Jacques Calvet, chairman of the French auto group, didn't
specify the scope of the expected improvement, but he said it
would reflect catching up on production lost to a flood in
one of the group's main plants in February, as well as the
success of new models launched in the luxury end of the car
market during 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Calvet didn't forecast full-year earnings or cash
flow, although he said he wouldn't be disappointed if
consolidated 1990 cash flow came in close to the 1989 level
of 18.553 billion francs.</p>
<p>Calvet also said the net treasury position of the group
showed a surplus of between 1.5 billion and 2 billion francs.
As reported, Peugeot was a net debtor until the end of 1989.</p>
<p>For all of 1989, Peugeot's consolidated net profit after
payments to minority interests was 10.30 billion francs on
revenue of 152.96 billion francs.</p>
