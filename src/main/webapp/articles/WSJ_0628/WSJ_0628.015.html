	<h3>If Anyone Makes a Fuss About It, Well, Then, Let Them Eat Bread</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">As the Fourth of July approaches, those uninhibited
public-relations people in Philadelphia are at it again,
shamelessly bragging for the third straight year about having
"the world's largest birthday cake."
   If only it were true; but, alas, the claim seems
half-baked.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Once again, the concoction, sponsored by convenience-store
operator Wawa Inc., will be 80 feet long, 10 feet wide and
weigh about 1,800 pounds. On the nation's birthday, an
estimated 25,000 people milling around the Liberty Bell will
be offered a little taste of freedom, including a portion
iced to look like the American flag.</p>
<p>The unpatriotic implications of flag eating
notwithstanding, celebration organizers prefer heaping on the
superlatives. Dava Guerin, vice president and group
supervisor at Weightman Schaefer, the festival's
public-relations firm, confidently says the cake "actually is
the world's largest." She adds: "I don't know how it's going
to taste, but it is the world's largest."</p>
<p>Local newspapers have already trumpeted the coming of the
cake, but for three years, it seems, no one has questioned
the claims about its record size.</p>
<p>However, Martin Day, an editor for the Guinness Book of
World Records in London who hadn't heard of Philadelphia's
claim, reports the world's largest cake -- 90,000 pounds, 84
feet by 114 feet -- was served up in 1986 in Austin, Texas.
Britain's Prince Charles sliced it with his sword to
celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of the
republic of Texas.</p>
<p>According to Guinness, Philadelphia's cake doesn't even
beat the first world's-biggest-cake on record, which emerged
from the oven in 1958 at 10,000 pounds. For that matter,
neither does it beat the previous two years' alleged "world's
largest" cakes in Philadelphia; they were the same size and
from the same recipe.</p>
<p>Frank Cooksey, who was mayor of Austin in 1986, says
Texans "aren't inclined to exaggeration like folks in
Philadelphia," and he thinks festival officials should "be
ashamed of themselves for making claims that can't be
substantiated."</p>
<p>Ms. Guerin explains that the festival's boast is meant to
be figurative. "When you see something so big," she says, "it
is the most natural thing to call it the world's largest."</p>
<p>But the cake's baker, who requests anonymity, concedes
that it might be safer just to call his creation the world's
largest "regular Fourth of July birthday cake in Philadelphia
on that day."</p>
