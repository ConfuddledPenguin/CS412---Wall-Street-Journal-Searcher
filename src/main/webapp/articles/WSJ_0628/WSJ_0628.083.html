	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House approved a foreign-operations bill
of more than $15.6 billion that would cut U.S. arms
assistance outside the Mideast nearly 13% in fiscal 1991 and
withhold half of El Salvador's new military aid after Oct. 1.
   The 308-117 roll call followed final reductions from the
military and World Bank accounts that the Bush administration
considers the most important, but the White House prevailed
elsewhere on two heated fights over international family
planning and U.S. assistance to the non-communist forces in
Cambodia.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>By a 260-163 margin, the House approved a $7 million
provision continuing the Cambodia funding. However, the
program would be limited to non-lethal assistance, and new
restrictions were imposed in response to criticism that the
insurgents are mounting military operations in cooperation
with the Khmer Rouge.</p>
<p>The victory represented a personal triumph for Rep.
Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.), who has been a major influence in
shaping the U.S. policy, but Washington's role in the war
remains controversial because of the brutal history of the
Khmer Rouge when it took over Cambodia in the 1970s.</p>
<p>The overt funding at issue is supplemented by a covert
intelligence program supporting the non-communist resistance
groups. And though no direct aid is permitted to the Khmer
Rouge, critics argue that it has become impossible to
guarantee that U.S. assistance isn't helping the Pol Pot
forces in battle or political negotiations.</p>
<p>The restrictions on military aid to El Salvador are in
line with provisions adopted this spring by the House, but
the State Department is pressing for a less severe
alternative that would withhold about 30% of the assistance.
Secretary of State James Baker has warned that he will seek a
veto if a compromise can't be reached, but the administration
faces opposition from some of its strongest supporters in the
past on Central America.</p>
<p>"I'm not just going to roll over," said Rep. John Murtha
(D., Pa.), chairman of the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee. "I want something that shows the Salvador army
they have to reform."</p>
<p>Though Israel is among those protected from cuts in
assistance, the Israeli government was warned in floor debate
that it too could face reductions if no agreement is reached
on new settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>"The U.S. has no obligation to fund directly or indirectly
settlements that we regard as an impediment to the peace
process," said Rep. David Obey, chairman of the Foreign
Operations subcommittee. The Wisconsin Democrat made a "flat
commitment" that he would support cuts if recommended by the
Bush administration in response to the Israeli settlement
issue.</p>
<p>Under pressure from the administration, the House
Appropriations leadership had agreed to provide $50 million
in new capital for the World Bank. But this funding, $60
million less than the president's request, was hurt by a
sweeping 2% reduction approved minutes before final passage
of the bill. Total U.S. contributions to international
financial organizations would be effectively frozen at
current levels, but U.S. Export-Import Bank funding was
exempted and would grow to $750 million, 50% above the White
House request.</p>
<p>The same 2% cut helped to push total foreign military aid
down to $4.6 billion, or about $222 million below this year's
level and more than $410 million under the president's
budget. Secretary Baker is sure to demand the restoration of
part of these funds in the Senate, but in the House
allocation, the State Department and Pentagon benefit from
added flexibility allowed by Mr. Obey, who resisted efforts
to earmark funding outside the Mideast.</p>
<p>Among countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
Turkey stands to be most affected by the proposed military
cuts. But the shift in priorities stands to benefit Eastern
Europe, where the bill would add an estimated $180 million to
the administration request for economic assistance. Aid to
sub-Saharan Africa would grow to $800 million, or 40% above
current funding, but this increase is combined with new
restrictions effectively denying any direct funding to
Zaire's Mobutu regime.</p>
<p>An estimated $245 million is allocated elsewhere for
population-planning accounts, including $1.5 million for
Romania. But on a 224-198 roll call, anti-abortion forces
upheld restrictions that effectively bar two of the largest
organizations, the International Planned Parenthood
Federation and the United Nations Fund for Population
Activities, from participating.</p>
<p>The floor action came as President Bush's ambitious moon
and Mars space initiative met further setbacks in the Senate
Commerce Committee, which cut all of an estimated $188
million in new money for the undertaking. The House
Appropriations Committee this week made even deeper cuts from
related programs, and though the White House hopes to restore
funds in the Senate, the Commerce Committee vote was a
serious blow to this effort.</p>
