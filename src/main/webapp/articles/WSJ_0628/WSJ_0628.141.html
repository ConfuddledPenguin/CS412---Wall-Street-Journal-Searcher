	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- The huge overhang of world-wide crude oil
inventories further depressed energy prices, sending them
into a systematic, steep decline.
   "The market gave ground," said Andrew LeBow, a futures
trader with E.D. & F. Man International Futures Inc. "There
wasn't any one bit of news that sent it down; it was mostly a
slow, steady erosion."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bearish sentiment abounded, and talk in the futures pits
was that storage facilities for oil in the U.S. are full.
Tankers loaded with crude are stacking up offshore trying to
find buyers, market participants say. And some companies are
taking options on giant ships called very large crude
carriers with plans to use them as storage tanks.</p>
<p>Weakness in commodity markets from London to New York
prompted at least three major oil companies to reduce the
price they pay for the benchmark West Texas Intermediate
crude. Sun Co., the Marathon Oil unit of USX Corp. and
Phillips Petroleum Co. all cut their posted price by 75 cents
a barrel to $15.50.</p>
<p>In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for
August delivery sank 46 cents to $16.68 a barrel as volume
picked up from recent sessions.</p>
<p>Traders said the latest American Petroleum Institute
statistics on inventories, released Tuesday afternoon,
confirmed that the long-term oversupply situation hadn't
eased, contributing to yesterday's market weakness. Although
crude stocks declined by 531,000 barrels last week, market
players dismissed the drop as insignificant. They noted that
supplies are about 41.5 million barrels above year-earlier
inventories and consider that a glut difficult to wear down.</p>
<p>Excess production by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries is the biggest contributor to the
oversupply, traders said. "We figure OPEC is producing about
one million barrels a day too much," one trader said. Even if
the group curtails production sharply, "it's going to take a
long time to clean it up," he said.</p>
<p>Gasoline inventories aren't as high as crude stocks,
traders said, and gasoline contracts have been relatively
strong as a result. Yesterday, however, gasoline for July
delivery ended at 59.49 cents a gallon, down 1.83 cents, on
the New York Merc.</p>
<p>The API said gasoline inventories declined by 354,000
barrels last week, but market participants were expecting a
larger drawdown ahead of the July Fourth holiday. Even though
the holiday falls in the middle of the week, traders were
still expecting demand to increase more than it has.</p>
<p>Some traders paint a bearish picture for gasoline prices.
Refinery utilization hasn't yet peaked this summer, they say,
and when more production comes on line, there could soon be
an excess of gasoline.</p>
<p>"We'll see more gasoline supply on the market, and it
doesn't look like demand is there," Mr. LeBow said. In
addition, the amount of gasoline refined from each barrel of
crude has increased in the summer, putting more product on
the market.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices for pork belly futures
deliverable in August closed 1.95 cents a pound higher at
58.30 cents, just shy of their two-cent daily limit, after a
report detailing the shrinking supply of frozen bellies. Pork
bellies are used in the production of bacon. The report,
released after the close of trading Tuesday, said that
warehouse supplies dropped by about four million pounds last
week after a 4.7 million-pound decline the previous week,
said Charles Levitt, a futures analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in Chicago. Warehouse stocks of frozen pork
bellies, at about 73 million pounds, are 29% lower than the
103 million pounds reported a year ago, and they are being
shipped out at a faster rate than last year as well, Mr.
Levitt said. The brisk demand in recent weeks is due in part
to the price of fresh pork bellies exceeding those in cold
storage, he said. Traders also are covering their short sales
-- or buying contracts to offset those sold earlier as a bet
that prices would decline -- to avoid taking a significant
position in the market ahead of tomorrow's release of a
50-state hog and pig report, analysts said. August live hog
futures gained 0.3 cents a pound to close at 58.92 cents.</p>
<p>SUGAR: Futures prices rose. The July contract gained 0.28
cent a pound to close at 12.66 cents, only 0.04 cent shy of
the session's high. Judith Ganes, soft commodity analyst at
Merrill Lynch Futures, said the market was strengthened by a
U.S. Department of Agriculture world estimate for sugar
released after the close of trading Tuesday. The report
predicted that supplies will fall short of demand by 2.3
million tons for the crop year ending in August 1991. Many
people in the sugar business had been expecting a slight
oversupply instead. "Even though many in the trade are
skeptical about this projected deficit, it will have a
tendency to make traders not want to be too short," Ms. Ganes
said. She said world sugar supplies still are tight and that
any production problems could worsen the supply picture. "I
am not willing to shut the book on the bull case yet," she
said. Harry Schwartz, tropical analyst at Cargill Investors
Services in New York, said much of the recent sell-off in
sugar came on the belief that the Soviet Union would be
incapable of buying sugar. "That's just not so," he asserted.
"They do have dollars, and they will buy sugar sooner or
later." The Soviets, he said, are shrewd traders and might
even have jawboned the market a bit by stressing their poor
financial condition. "Just think how much further their sugar
dollars will go at 12 cents a pound when compared with buying
at 16 cents," he said.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices rallied after falling the previous
two days. July copper settled near its high at $1.10 a pound,
up 1.65 cents. The market was buoyed, according to John
Gross, publisher of the Copper Journal, by the prospect of a
strike against Asarco Inc., a major copper producer. The
current labor contract expires Saturday. Meanwhile, Mr. Gross
said, the level of warehouse supplies is having a confusing
effect on the market because inventories in New York's
Commodity Exchange are rising while London Metal Exchange
stocks are falling. However, he said, the total held by both
exchanges has risen 21% since the end of March to 84,599 tons
from 69,702. Mr. Gross said several factors could be viewed
as supportive of the market in addition to the Asarco
situation. A technical factor is that the July contract has
twice fallen to the $1.07 area and then rebounded. "Some
people would view that as a double bottom," he said, which
some technical traders say could presage a major upward move.
Among fundamental factors, Mr. Gross said, copper prices
might also be supported by the auto industry's plans to
increase production in the third quarter by 10% over the same
period in 1989.</p>
