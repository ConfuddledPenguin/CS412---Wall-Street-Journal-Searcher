	<p class="article-leader">E-Systems, Inc., Dallas, said it has received a
"multimillion-dollar" contract from a Mobil Corp. unit to
test its computer-based mass storage system over a three-year
period.
   The contract represents the first adaptation of the data
storage system for a nongovernment group, said Philip J.
Rasch, manager of business development for the project.
E-Systems, an electronic systems and products company, hopes
the contract with Mobil will give it a leg up on an estimated
$2 billion market in the 1990s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The mass storage system will store the oil company's
exploration data on tape cartridges similar to those used by
video cassette recorders. The recording system was adapted
from one produced by Ampex Corp., Redwood City, Calif., for
broadcast television. The cassettes are stored on shelves and
retrieved by robot for playback on a recorder; the system is
operated by a minisupercomputer produced by Convex Computer
Corp., Richardson, Texas.</p>
<p>Ampex has the rights to market its portion of the system,
primarily the recording device, for non-automated uses.</p>
