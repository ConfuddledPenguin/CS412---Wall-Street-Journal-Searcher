	<p class="article-leader">RED BANK, N.J. -- Hovnanian Enterprises Inc., a developer
of moderately priced suburban homes, said it expects sharply
lower earnings for its year ending Feb. 28, 1991, as the
sluggish regional economy continues to hurt sales.
   The company said it expects earnings of $5 million to $7
million, or 25 cents to 35 cents a share, on revenue of $290
million to $325 million. In fiscal 1990, net was $21.8
million, or $1.05 a share, on revenue of $410 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The fiscal 1990 earnings were 24% below fiscal 1989's.
While projecting a second year of decline, the company
stressed its belief "that fundamental demand for
competitively priced homes in the best locations remains
strong." In the past, the company has had up to 75% of its
volume in townhouses and single-family homes priced between
$70,000 and $130,000, which sold quickly, but such homes have
become harder to develop and harder to sell.</p>
<p>"In the past years we had that success. People were
camping out, waiting on long lines -- we had to hold
lotteries," said John J. Schimpf, executive vice president.
But with layoffs and employment uncertainties in the New York
metropolitan area and a great supply of unsold houses in its
important central New Jersey market, buyers have become very
picky.</p>
<p>"There's been healthy skepticism about housing prices in
the metropolitan area. A lot of the pent-up demand for
housing has been run out of the marketplace," Mr. Schimpf
said. Instead of cutting prices, however, Hovnanian is
offering buyers appliance packages and paying closing costs
to aid sales. Such incentive costs, along with declining
sales volumes, are depressing earnings, Mr. Schimpf said.</p>
