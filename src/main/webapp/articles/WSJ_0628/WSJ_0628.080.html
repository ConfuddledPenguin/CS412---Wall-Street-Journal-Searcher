	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court, upholding federal
programs designed to increase the number of broadcast
licenses held by women and minorities, broadly supported the
power of Congress to adopt affirmative-action plans.
   By a 5-4 vote, the high court ruled for the first time
that Congress may authorize affirmative action, not simply to
correct the effects of past discrimination, but to promote
other goals, such as racial and ethnic diversity.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ruling, written by Justice William Brennan, upheld two
Federal Communications Commission policies -- adopted by the
agency and later ratified by Congress -- that give
minority-owned and women-owned businesses preferences in
competing for broadcast licenses. The court said the FCC's
rationale -- that minority ownership is desirable because it
promotes diversity in broadcast programming -- was sufficient
to justify the affirmative-action plans.</p>
<p>The decision is the most sweeping endorsement of
affirmative action ever issued by the court, but its
practical effect may be limited for two reasons. First, the
ruling applies only to federal programs and doesn't alter the
effects of last year's high court decision restricting the
ability of state and local government programs to give
preference to minority-owned businesses. Second, the
political climate in Congress isn't likely to bring about any
major minority-business preference programs.</p>
<p>However, the decision will make it easier for Congress to
preserve existing plans, including the FCC policies, and
affirmative-action requirements in federal public-works
transportation programs and Education Department projects.
The decision also will help to bolster the transportation
affirmative-action plans against pending court challenges.</p>
<p>The decision was an extension of a 1980 ruling in which a
splintered high court upheld a minority preference program
adopted by Congress for federal publicworks contracts.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the majority said that Congress may adopt
race-oriented policies, as long as they are benign, meaning
not intended to discriminate against anyone, and as long as
"they serve important governmental objectives within the
power of Congress and are substantially related to
achievement of those objectives."</p>
<p>The decision provoked a strong dissent by Justice Anthony
Kennedy, who said the court was permitting "racial
classifications" like those that kept blacks and whites in
"separate but equal" facilities until the desegregation of
the 1950s and 1960s, and that led to the internment of
Japanese-Americans during World War II.</p>
<p>"Policies of racial separation and preference are almost
always justified as benign, even when it is clear to any
sensible observer that they are not," Justice Kennedy wrote,
citing as an example an apartheid policy statement of the
South African government.</p>
<p>Justice Sandra O'Connor also wrote a dissenting opinion,
joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices
Kennedy and Antonin Scalia.</p>
<p>The high court ruled on two FCC policies. In one, a
federal appeals court for the District of Columbia in April
1989 declared unconstitutional the FCC's distress-sale
policy, which allows a broadcast company that is in danger of
losing its license to avoid that risk by selling the license
to a minority-controlled business.</p>
<p>The appeals court ruled for Alan Shurberg, a computer
consultant seeking a television license in Hartford, Conn.,
since 1982. The FCC awarded the license in a distress sale to
Astroline Communications Co., a partnership led by Richard
Ramirez. Astroline appealed the ruling, and the Supreme Court
reversed the appeals-court decision.</p>
<p>Also in April 1989, a different threejudge panel of the
same appeals court upheld the constitutionality of an FCC
policy that gives minority and women applicants some
preference in receiving new licenses. The appeals court ruled
for Rainbow Broadcasting Co., a 90% Hispanic-owned company to
which the FCC awarded a UHF television license in Orlando,
Fla. The policy was challenged by Metro Broadcasting Inc.
Metro appealed the decision, and the Supreme Court affirmed
the appeals-court ruling.</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said the policies were "aimed at
creating more diversity, and we think they have achieved
that. We're pleased that the cloud of doubt has been removed
from them."</p>
<p>Andrew Jay Schwartzman, executive director of the Media
Access Project, a public-interest communications law firm,
said the decision was "obviously a big surprise." Mr.
Schwartzman called the decision "the most important, clearly
positive affirmative-action ruling in some time." (Metro
Broadcasting Inc. vs. FCC.)</p>
<p>Environmental Lawsuits</p>
<p>The justices, by a 5-4 vote, made it substantially more
difficult for citizens' groups to mount broad legal
challenges to federal government land-use and environmental
policies. In a decision written by Justice Scalia, the
justices barred the National Wildlife Federation, an
environmental group, from suing to challenge Interior
Department plans to open up millions of acres of federal land
in Western states and Alaska to mineral leasing and mining.</p>
<p>The high court ruled that individuals or groups who
propose to sue over federal land use must offer detailed
evidence of how they would be hurt by the government's
actions; moreover, the evidence must demonstrate injury from
the proposed leasing of specific tracts of land, not for the
overall, general land-use plan.</p>
<p>Justice Harry Blackmun dissented, joined by Justices
Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John Stevens. (Lujan vs.
National Wildlife Federation).</p>
<p>Child-Abuse Witnesses</p>
<p>The justices, by a 5-4 vote, ruled that states may permit
alleged victims of child abuse to testify on closed-circuit
cameras or through other indirect methods intended to avoid
their facing defendants in court. Such methods may be used
only when absolutely necessary to protect against emotional
trauma to a child, the court said, and when the defendant's
right to have an attorney cross-examine the child witness is
preserved. Under these circumstances, the defendant's Sixth
Amendment right to confront witnesses isn't violated, the
court said in an opinion written by Justice O'Connor.</p>
<p>The decision marks the first time the court has directly
endorsed the constitutionality of alternative means of
testifying for children in child-abuse cases. But it ratifies
what most states have adopted for their courts. Thirty-seven
states permit use of videotaped testimony of children; 24
states allow use of one-way closed-circuit television in such
cases.</p>
<p>Justice Scalia dissented, joined by Justices Brennan,
Marshall and Stevens. (Maryland vs. Craig).</p>
<p>By another 5-4 margin, in a second case, the court
disallowed a physician's testimony in court about statements
made to him by an alleged child-abuse victim who was
considered incapable of testifying herself. The court said
testimony about the alleged victim's statements can't be used
unless prosecutors explain why the child is unavailable to
testify and why the child's statements to the third party
should be considered reliable. Justice O'Connor wrote the
opinion. Justice Kennedy dissented, joined by Chief Justice
Rehnquist and Justices Blackmun and Byron White. (Idaho vs.
Wright).</p>
