	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Horn & Hardart Co., having largely refocused
to become primarily a direct marketer through catalogs, will
name Jack E. Rosenfeld president and chief executive officer.
   The 52-year-old Mr. Rosenfeld, who heads the company's
Hanover Cos. catalog operations, succeeds Donald Schupak, 47,
who took the three top posts at Horn & Hardart two years ago.
Prior to that, Mr. Schupak had been Horn & Hardart's vice
chairman, responsible for directing Hanover. He will remain
as chairman for an interim period and will be a company
consultant for three years thereafter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under Mr. Schupak, Horn & Hardart has been selling its
restaurant and real estate holdings to focus on Hanover,
which markets a range of goods through 22 catalogs. Recently,
Horn & Hardart completed the sale of its Bojangles fast-food
chain to a group including Sienna Holdings, a Los Angeles
investment firm.</p>
<p>For 1990, Mr. Schupak forecasts Hanover will show more
than $20 million of operating profit and $500 million of
sales, indicating a doubling of sales and tripling of
earnings from two years ago. Horn & Hardart as a whole
reported a loss for the first half of 1990 of $5.7 million,
or 41 cents a share, on revenue of $314.3 million.</p>
<p>Still to come in the restructuring, Mr. Schupak says, is a
refinancing of $17 million of 11% debt and repayment or
refinancing of $60 million of increasing-rate debt, currently
at 10.5%. Both issues are due in October 1991. And the
company must sell the last of its land and restaurant
holdings, including some New York real estate and restaurants
and the 80-unit West Coast restaurant chain International
King's Table.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenfeld says Hanover probably will reduce the number
of its catalogs slightly, although he wasn't specific.</p>
