	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The pound rose and the yen fell as the
currency markets reacted to a jump in oil prices.
   The dollar gained against its Japanese counterpart but
fell against other major currencies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In late New York trading, sterling was quoted at $1.8810,
up almost four cents from $1.8435 late Friday in New York.
The dollar was changing hands at 137.35 yen, up from 136.65
yen in New York late Friday.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency was also quoted at 1.5590 marks and
1.2978 Swiss francs, down from 1.5785 marks and 1.3190
francs.</p>
<p>In Tokyo early Tuesday, the dollar was trading at 136.52
yen, down from 137.33 yen at the close there Friday, the last
day markets were open in Japan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at about 1.5565
marks, down from Friday's Tokyo close of 1.5764 marks.</p>
<p>On Monday, the markets paid more attention to news from
the Middle East than to a statement issued over the weekend
by the Group of Seven -- the financial leaders of the seven
major industrialized nations. Currency prices followed oil
prices, which soared after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
threatened to attack Israel and bomb Saudi Arabian oil fields
unless the United Nations embargo against Iraq is lifted.</p>
<p>The benchmark crude-oil futures contract on the New York
Mercantile Exchange rose above $39 a barrel before closing at
$38.25 a barrel, up $2.82 on the day.</p>
<p>Because of its oil fields in the North Sea, Britain is a
net exporter of oil, though a small one. Japan, on the other
hand, imports 95% of its petroleum needs and is considered
the most vulnerable among major nations to higher oil prices.</p>
<p>The pound is called a petrocurrency or a petroneutral
currency and generally moves in the same direction as oil
prices, while the yen is tagged a petrodependent currency and
moves against oil prices. Direct trading between the two
units is being called the "petro cross," because it is the
most sensitive to oil markets. The pound shot up to 258.36
yen in New York yesterday from 251.91 yen Friday.</p>
<p>Reflecting the nervousness of global investors, the price
of gold jumped. Gold is generally seen as a haven for
investors in times of turmoil. On the Commodity Exchange in
New York, gold for current delivery rose $13.60 an ounce to
$403 an ounce. Estimated volume was a heavy five million
ounces.</p>
<p>Stock markets suffered around the world, with New York's
Dow Jones Industrial Average shedding 59.41 points, or about
2.4%, to 2452.97 -- its lowest level since July 3, 1989.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the G-7 seemed to give dollar sellers the
go-ahead after its meeting Saturday in Washington, but the
market was overloaded with other influences and didn't really
take the officials up on it.</p>
<p>In their concluding statement, the financial authorities
of Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S. and West
Germany said that, following the yen's appreciation since
their last meeting, exchange rates are now "broadly in line
with continued adjustment of external imbalances."</p>
<p>The yen has gained 7.4% against the dollar since July,
when the G-7 met in Houston. In theory, a strong yen would
help close the U.S. trade gap with Japan because it makes
Japanese goods more expensive.</p>
<p>Initially, the G-7 statement moved some market
participants to sell dollars from their homes. Although the
Tokyo markets were closed in celebration of Autumnal Equinox
Day, other Asia-Pacific dealers said they were surprisingly
busy.</p>
<p>"What we're seeing is New Yorkers calling on a Sunday
afternoon wanting to sell dollars," an Auckland dealer said.</p>
<p>But the dollar's downward momentum was broken in New York
when French Economics Minister Pierre Beregovoy told
reporters in Washington that the G-7 "would have to consult
and decide what to do" if the dollar continued declining.</p>
<p>However, most of the market's attention was focused on oil
prices and yen cross trading. The Japanese currency fell as
investors sought to cover long, or overbought, yen positions.
These investors had bet on a G-7 statement even more
supportive of the yen's appreciation than what they got, and
they hadn't foreseen the leap in oil prices.</p>
<p>The pound, meanwhile, rode into the session on a raft of
short, or oversold, positions after its decline of more than
three cents Friday. Dealers looking to take profits on that
decline found excuses even before oil prices took off.</p>
<p>During the weekend, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer John
Major ruled out an early interest-rate cut. Yesterday, the
British government reported the U.K. trade deficit for August
at #1.1 billion, below expectations of a #1.4 billion
shortfall.</p>
<p>The dollar ended European dealings broadly weaker. Action
was thin early in the day because of the holiday in Japan.
But traders said dollar selling accelerated in the European
afternoon, when U.S. markets opened.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at
$401.35 an ounce.</p>
