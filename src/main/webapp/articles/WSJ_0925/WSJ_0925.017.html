	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Biogen Inc. said it was awarded a
European patent for genetically engineered beta interferon,
an experimental drug for treating various kinds of cancer and
viral infections.
   A naturally occurring form of the substance, which is made
by certain human cells, has been sold for several years in
various European countries, Biogen said. Last year, Biogen
and Asta Pharma AG of West Germany, a division of Degussa AG,
agreed to develop jointly a genetically engineered version of
the drug for marketing in certain Western European countries.
Biogen plans to develop the drug separately for marketing in
the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Biogen's European patent covers DNA molecules, genetically
altered cells and methods employed in making a genetically
engineered form of the drug, the company said. Clinical tests
indicate the drug may be useful in treating a number of
disorders, including hepatitis C, a liver disease; multiple
sclerosis, a nerve disease; and cancers such as melanoma,
brain tumors and lymphoma, Biogen said.</p>
