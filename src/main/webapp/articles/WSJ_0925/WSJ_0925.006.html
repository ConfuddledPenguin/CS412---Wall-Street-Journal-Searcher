	<p class="article-leader">Your page-one Aug. 24 "What's News" item about Southern
Baptists would have your readers believe that the
"fundamentalists," those rascals who took control of the
unsuspecting Southern Baptist Convention, represent the
radical departure from the historical creedal viewpoint.
   A literal interpretation of Scripture long has been a
cardinal tenet of Southern Baptists, along with a belief in
its verbal, plenary inspiration. The characterization of the
opponents of this orthodoxy as "moderates" is a further
attempt to position the fundamentalists as holding the
aberrant view. It is unfortunate that you cloud the truth:
that a liberal group is attempting to pull the Southern
Baptists from their traditional roots. The so-called
moderates are staging the coup, not the fundamentalists.</p>
