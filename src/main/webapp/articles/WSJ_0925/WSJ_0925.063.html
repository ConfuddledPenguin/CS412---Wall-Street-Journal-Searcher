	<p class="article-leader">States Turn to Bans
   To Make Recycling Pay</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>WISCONSIN and Massachusetts are the first states to ban
disposal of a broad range of recyclable materials, from
newspapers to plastic containers. The laws adopted this year
are intended to promote investment in recycling plants by
ensuring a steady supply of raw materials. Landfill and
incinerator operators are subject to stiff fines (as much as
$25,000 a day in Massachusetts) if they dispose of materials
covered by the bans.</p>
<p>The Wisconsin and Massachusetts laws go further than
selective bans in other states covering car batteries, yard
waste, tires or appliances. By 1995, bans in the two states
will encompass metal, glass and plastic containers,
newspaper, cardboard and office paper, while Wisconsin also
covers magazines and foam plastic. Wisconsin seeks to develop
markets for recyclables by requiring 10% recycled content in
plastic containers by 1995 and 45% in newspapers by 2001.</p>
<p>The waste disposal industry is protesting such broad
disposal bans. The National Solid Wastes Management
Association, a trade group, says bans will flood markets with
tons of recyclables that can't be sold. The group also
complains that enforcement provisions unfairly target waste
handlers, rather than generators.</p>
<p>Connecticut repealed its disposal ban this year and
adopted a law that spreads responsibility for recycling.
Starting Jan. 1, communities must adopt and enforce laws
requiring residents and businesses to separate recyclables,
while haulers and disposal facilities must inspect waste and
report violators. So far, 11 states and Washington, D.C.,
require separation of recyclables.</p>
<p>Blue Bags Making It</p>
<p>Easier to Sort Waste</p>
<p>SEVERAL CITIES say they have found a cheaper and more
convenient way to collect cans, bottles and other
recyclables. Residents can mix their recyclables together and
dispose of them in blue trash bags instead of sorting them
into the plastic bins used in most programs.</p>
<p>Because bagged recyclables are collected by regular
compactor trucks during normal pickups, proponents say the
bags reduce or eliminate the need for expensive new trucks,
additional collection routes and bins. The convenience of
bags could induce more people to recycle, they say.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh this week began bag-based recycling with 50,000
households, which will use the blue recycling bags. Although
the recyclables still must be sorted at a central facility,
the city estimates it will save $5 million a year. After
sorting, the bags also are to be recycled. A three-month test
showed that compacting recyclables in bags didn't hurt their
resale value. Blue bags are being used or tested in Houston,
Mobile, Ala., Erie, Pa., and elsewhere. "This system is
convenient for everyone and provides recycling at the lowest
possible cost," says Earl Joyner, a Mobile official.</p>
<p>Environmental groups haven't taken a stand yet on the
bags. They aren't convinced that contamination, such as
broken glass mixing with other recyclables, won't reduce
their value.</p>
<p>Everyday Electric Items</p>
<p>Are Causing Concern</p>
<p>AMERICANS are increasingly anxious about possible
cancer-causing effects of electromagnetic fields from power
lines and ordinary electric appliances. A recent
Environmental Protection Agency analysis shows there is cause
for concern. The draft report concludes that exposure to low
frequency magnetic fields, commonly given off by residential
distribution lines, household wiring and appliances, is a
"possible, but not a proven, cause of cancer in people."</p>
<p>The report cited two statistical studies suggesting that
children with higher exposures from residential power lines
are twice as likely to get leukemia and cancers of the
central nervous system. There is little evidence of risk to
adults, except in high-exposure occupations.</p>
<p>But federal officials and leading academic experts say
there isn't nearly enough evidence yet to justify regulating
electromagnetic field exposures. They want a major expansion
of research.</p>
<p>Until there are definitive answers, some experts advise
"prudent avoidance." Examples: Move non-digital electric
clocks several feet away from your head at night; don't use
electric blankets; move beds away from the wall where power
lines connect to your house; and, if practical, sit at least
two feet away from personal computers.

<p>Backers of Methanol</p>
<p>Focusing on Mileage</p>
<p>METHANOL FUEL would get a big boost as an alternative to
gasoline if Congress requires a lot more miles per gallon in
addition to cleaner air. Derived from natural gas, coal or
even sewage sludge, methanol delivers both, as well as more
power and acceleration.</p>
<p>Environmental Protection Agency tests show prototype
Toyota and Nissan cars that run on 100% methanol get between
10% and 40% more fuel efficiency, up to 25% more horsepower
and better acceleration. Yet they reduce emissions of
smog-producing hydrocarbons and cancer-causing chemicals by
90%. Even vehicles that run on either gasoline or 85%
methanol produce 5% to 10% gains in economy, with 30% to 50%
less pollution.</p>
<p>EPA officials say methanol vehicles would meet Senate
proposals for at least 20% higher fuel economy, while
allowing Detroit to continue making popular and profitable
gas-guzzlers. U.S. auto makers will deliver more than 4,000
methanol vehicles for testing by 1993. But these vehicles
probably won't be mass-produced until 1995 or later because
the fuel isn't widely available.</p>
