	<p class="article-leader">Alan P. Hoblitzell Jr., who built up MNC Financial Inc.
from a local bank into a fast-growing super-regional
financial-services company during the 1980s, has abruptly
left the company.
   Mr. Hoblitzell, MNC Financial's chairman and chief
executive officer, announced his decision to leave the
company at a special board meeting he convened Saturday. He
referred to his departure as an early retirement, effective
immediately.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As recently as nine months ago, Mr. Hoblitzell had been
touted as Baltimore's most innovative and pioneering bank
chief. MNC Financial, with $27.5 billion in assets, is
Maryland's largest bank holding company. It continued to be
an aggressive real estate lender in the Baltimore-Washington,
D.C., area even after many other banks in the Northeast
retrenched as the real estate market soured.</p>
<p>But Mr. Hoblitzell's star faded fast when the company's
real estate problems surfaced earlier this year. Analysts
said rumors began circulating through the city's banking
community that Mr. Hoblitzell's job was on the line after MNC
reported a $74.7 million second-quarter loss.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoblitzell's successor is Alfred Lerner, a
Cleveland-based multimillionaire who emerged as the company's
largest shareholder when MNC acquired Equitable Bancorp. in
January.</p>
<p>Several analysts believe Mr. Lerner was responsible for
Mr. Hoblitzell's sudden departure from MNC Financial. The
analysts contend that Mr. Lerner has been increasing his
control over the bank since the Equitable acquisition was
completed.</p>
<p>John Bailey, an analyst with Ferris Baker Watts in
Washington, D.C., said yesterday's news "was no surprise. It
seems like just a formality." Mr. Bailey noted that in recent
weeks several key MNC managers have been replaced with former
Equitable executives.</p>
<p>When MNC couldn't raise equity capital in the open market
last month, Mr. Lerner agreed to buy up to 100% of a $180
million convertible preferred stock offering. Mr. Lerner's
8.9% stake in MNC jumps to nearly 25% if he does purchase the
entire preferred issue. The offering is set to close in
November.</p>
<p>"Since Alfred Lerner said he was going to take the
preferred, the handwriting was on the wall. It was just a
matter of timing," said Nancy Bush, an analyst with Brown
Brothers Harriman in New York. She added that Mr.
Hoblitzell's departure "is disturbing to morale during such a
critical period."</p>
<p>In a phone interview, Mr. Lerner said it "was not my
preference" to see Mr. Hoblitzell leave MNC Financial. "(Mr.
Hoblitzell) didn't feel he was up to what it would take to
fix this place. He felt it could be done better by someone
who had a more hard-nosed view of the world."</p>
<p>Mr. Lerner said he "didn't plan to stay in the chief
executive's slot indefinitely." But his immediate strategy is
to help MNC straighten out its real estate problems. That
means he'll spend more time in Baltimore, but he doesn't plan
to move from Cleveland.</p>
<p>At the end of the second quarter, $522 million or nearly
69% of MNC Financial's nonperforming assets were commercial
real estate loans. The company is trying to sell its MNC
Credit Corp. unit, a commercial finance and leasing operation
with $1.2 billion of assets. A company spokesman said the
sale was needed to lessen the holding company's cash needs.</p>
<p>Federal regulators are in the midst of completing a review
of MNC's loan portfolio and they could ask the company to
reclassify more loans as nonperforming. Such a move would
require MNC to boost its loan-loss reserves, analysts said.</p>
<p>Yet, analysts also noted that unlike other banks hurt by
bad real estate loans, MNC Financial has a lucrative
credit-card operation, with sizable earnings that could
provide a cushion during these rough times.</p>
