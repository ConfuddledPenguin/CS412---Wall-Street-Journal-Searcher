	<p class="article-leader">MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- ASK Computer Systems Inc. said it
agreed to allow EDS Corp. to market ASK products to EDS'
manufacturing customers.
   Under the agreement, EDS will offer ASK's
management-information systems, ASK said, while ASK customers
will gain access to EDS' services in consulting, systems
planning and systems integration. The pact comes a week after
ASK announced it agreed to sell a 20% stake to EDS, a unit of
General Motors Corp., and a 10% stake to Hewlett-Packard Co.
in order to finance its acquisition of software maker Ingress
Corp.</p>
