	<p class="article-leader">Add another familiar name to the list of management
mavens: Theodor S. Geisel.
   S as in Seuss. As in Dr. Seuss.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The children's author who put "Green Eggs and Ham" on
practically every kid's breakfast plate is being served up as
recommended fare to grown-up managers. Cynthia Eisenhauer,
for one, urges her staff at the Iowa Department of Employment
Services, where she is director, to savor the wisdom in the
86-year-old author's most recent book, "Oh, the Places You'll
Go]"</p>
<p>Here is one such morsel:</p>
<p>You have brains in your head.</p>
<p>You have feet in your shoes.</p>
<p>You can steer yourself</p>
<p>any direction you choose.</p>
<p>"It's inspirational and encourages people to set high
standards and work to achieve them without being
discouraged," exclaims Ms. Eisenhauer.</p>
<p>Carolyn B. Elman, executive director of the American
Business Women's Association, agrees. She has been pushing
the book to her group's 100,000 members. Unlike many
how-to-succeed books, she contends, "this book lets you know
everyone fails at some time and that you have to pick
yourself up and just go on." Dr. Seuss's prescription:</p>
<p>Out there things can happen</p>
<p>and frequently do</p>
<p>to people as brainy</p>
<p>and footsy as you.</p>
<p>And when things start to happen,</p>
<p>don't worry. Don't stew.</p>
<p>Just go right along.</p>
<p>You'll start happening too.</p>
<p>Nearly 800,000 copies of the book have been sold since it
was released early this year, reports Random House, which is
marketing it "as a book for anyone starting out on a new
adventure in life," says a spokeswoman. Described on its
jacket as a graduation speech for "out-starting upstarts of
all ages," the book has been on the New York Times fiction
best-seller list for more than 30 weeks.</p>
<p>Like Grinches, some big-name management gurus are giving
their newest colleague the brushoff. "I haven't gotten to it
yet," says Peter Drucker, who suggests he prefers Shakespeare
to Seuss as a management tool.</p>
<p>What does Dr. Seuss say about all this? "While I had no
intention of speaking directly to managers when I wrote the
book, I'm pleased when readers get something beyond what I
intended."</p>
