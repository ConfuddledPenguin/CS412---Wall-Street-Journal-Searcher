	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- John Portman said the contractor that built his
San Francisco Fashion Center has delayed payment to several
subcontractors on the job, prompting a slew of liens filed
against Mr. Portman.
   At least 14 liens have been filed against Mr. Portman on
the 800,000-square-foot building by tradesmen and suppliers
who say they haven't been fully paid for their work. Mr.
Portman, who has suspended some debt repayments because of a
cash shortage, is in talks with lenders on restructuring the
collateral on his $2 billion of debt.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Portman said in a statement that Portman Cos. has paid
all invoices issued to it by the Fashion Center's contractor,
Denver-based Stolte Corp., "promptly and in full." He said
"typical end-of-the-job negotiations for final close-out of
the project," amounting to about $500,000, are expected to be
resolved in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mr. Portman said, because Stolte has
postponed paying some subcontractors, Portman Cos. will issue
all remaining payments jointly to Stolte and the
subcontractor involved in a particular portion of work.</p>
<p>Jim Jones, Stolte's vice president of finance and
administration, said that Portman Cos. has paid all its bills
to Stolte and that Stolte is in "normal" negotiations with
subcontractors to pay for the large number of change orders
made on the San Francisco project. He said Stolte has yet to
give Portman the building's final bill, which he estimated at
$3 million.</p>
<p>Stolte's parent company, John Holland Holdings Ltd. of
Australia, is up for sale, and Mr. Jones said that possible
transaction may be having some effect on resolving the bills
of subcontractors. He wouldn't elaborate.</p>
<p>But Clem Grant, president of Dual Lock Partition Systems
of Beaverton, Ore., one of the lienholders, said, "It's not
normal for us to have to put aside $87,000 and negotiate
after-the-fact for payment on base contract work."</p>
