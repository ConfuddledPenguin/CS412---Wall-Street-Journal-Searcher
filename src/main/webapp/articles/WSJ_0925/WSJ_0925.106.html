	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate overwhelmingly approved
legislation aimed at restoring protection of older workers'
retirement benefits.
   The Senate voted 94-1 for the measure, after leading
backers and former opponents worked out a compromise. That
agreement between Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio and David Pryor
of Arkansas, Democrats pushing the bill, and Republicans
Orrin Hatch of Utah and John Heinz of Pennsylvania attempted
to meet employers' concerns that earlier versions would lead
to costly benefit packages and make it difficult for the
employers to offer early retirement to older employees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Senior Bush administration officials had recommended that
the president veto an earlier version, but a White House
spokeswoman yesterday said that the administration hadn't
reviewed the compromise and didn't yet have a position on it.
The House hasn't yet moved ahead with its version of the
bill, and employers want to prevent the House from going
beyond the Senate compromise measure in assuring retiree
benefits.</p>
<p>The Senate compromise measure would bar employers from
discriminating against older workers in providing such
benefits as pensions and disability payments. It eliminates a
provision that would have penalized employers retroactively,
for benefit plans that don't comply with the bill but would
have been in effect before its enactment.</p>
<p>The agreement also allows employers to avoid
discrimination against older workers by combining benefits,
rather than considering each benefit separately. Non-union
employers would be given 180 days, instead of 60 days, to
comply with the new requirements.</p>
<p>The legislation is designed to overturn a 1989 Supreme
Court ruling that gave employers wide leeway to restrict
retirement pension and health benefits. The ruling reversed
an appeals court decision that had favored June Betts, who
had to retire at age 61 because of illness after six years as
an Ohio speech pathologist. Because she was over 59, the
state denied disability in accordance with state law.</p>
<p>The high court decision was one of several rulings that
civil-rights groups said rolled back much of the gains they
had made over the years in winning legal protection for
workers' rights.</p>
