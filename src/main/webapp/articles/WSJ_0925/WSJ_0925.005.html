	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Having invested millions of French francs
computerizing their trading over the past five years, Paris
stock brokers next month plan to take another big step: a
fancy new system to fully computerize their back offices,
where the market's paperwork is done.
   Defenders say the new system, called Relit, will dynamize
the French market and help to make it more competitive with
London. London hasn't computerized its back offices and is
watching the Relit experiment with interest. But detractors
worry that the cost of Relit, coming just as Paris feels the
clutch of a bear market, could break some brokers' backs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One of France's largest brokerage firms, Tuffier-Ravier-Py
& Associes, filed for bankruptcy in July, squeezed by thin
margins, sluggish volume and an ambitious expansion program.
Many brokers fear that the added expense of even more
technology could force more firms to follow Tuffier.</p>
<p>Relit's backers shrug off that kind of criticism. They say
Relit, which is similar to the systems at New York exchanges,
will eventually cut the time of share delivery as it does
away with lost trades and unsettled business that have
plagued the bourse in the past. By linking banks' and
brokers' back offices to a central clearing house in a single
computer network, Relit will be able to check all trades and
then match deliveries with payments.</p>
<p>However, next month's start-up is a tentative beginning;
the system still faces major obstacles. Next month it will
handle only off-market trades. Then in November it will take
in 11 of the lesser-known cash market stocks.</p>
<p>The sticking point will come with handling the monthly
settlement market, where the vast majority of Paris trading
is done. That market, which is unique to Paris, allows
traders 30 days' free credit before they have to settle
trades. Relit's backers have promised to bring the monthly
settlement stocks onto the system by May, but they haven't
yet agreed among themselves whether that means doing away
with the current system.</p>
<p>Relit's supporters acknowledge that the system raises
problems, but argue that without it the Paris bourse would
not be able to keep up with rival exchanges. Pierre Gobet, a
director at Pinatton S.A., admitted the project could hurt
some of the smaller brokerage firms but described Relit as
"inevitable" in a global market.</p>
<p>At the moment, French back offices, unable to keep pace
with the forced march of modernization, trail far behind the
trading rooms in terms of efficiency. In a matter of years,
trading has been literally electrified.</p>
<p>Computerized trading and expanded hours have multiplied
trading capacity by about five times since 1988. But back
offices have only increased their capacity by about one and a
half times. It isn't hard to identify the back offices'
problem: too much paperwork. At present, back office clerks
have to settle share trades on the Paris bourse in any one of
23 different ways.</p>
<p>Relit will standardize the process. And it will solve an
old headache of the French bourse -- unsettled trades -- by
seeking immediate confirmation of any deal by computer.
Currently, many back offices confirm transactions with their
clients by mail, causing oversights and unsettled orders in
the process. In 1988, 17 billion French francs ($3.2 billion)
worth of unsettled trades were festering in the system.</p>
<p>Some brokers say it will take a shakeup like Relit to lure
foreign investors back to Paris. But even if it does win
business back, Relit's start-up costs could force another
shake-out in Paris broking.</p>
<p>Many brokers fear that smaller brokerages might be forced
to close down their own back offices, sub-contracting out to
those that are already equipped. Some large brokerage firms
say they are ready to take on the work. No one has taken up
their offer yet, but it may be only a matter of time. "Some
of the smaller companies will just have to consider whether
it's worth going on," one broker said.</p>
