	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The American Stock Exchange delayed today's
scheduled start of options trading on its Japan Index of 210
stocks.
   "We have regulatory clearance. We are just smoothing out
some last-minute details," a spokeswoman for the Amex said,
declining to be specific. The Amex said it will announce
another launch date today. The trading is designed to allow
investors to bet on the direction of Japan's stock market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, the two big Chicago commodity exchanges this
week are launching vehicles of their own for betting on the
Japanese market.</p>
<p>The Chicago Mercantile Exchange today is to introduce
futures and options on the Nikkei Index of 225 Tokyo stocks.
And the Chicago Board of Trade plans to trade in futures and
options on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Index of more than 1,200
stocks, starting Thursday night and continuing thereafter in
day and night trading.</p>
