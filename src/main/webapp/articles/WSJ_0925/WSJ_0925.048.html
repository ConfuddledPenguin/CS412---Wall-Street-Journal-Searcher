	<p class="article-leader">Like all new business partners, the three who founded
Cimtelligence Corp. five years ago hoped for smooth teamwork.
   But soon they fell into protracted disputes -- and even
shouting matches, says Charles Granville, now president of
the Lexington, Mass., computer-software producer. "It was
destructive for morale and performance," he says. "We
couldn't get anything agreed to." The start-up remained bumpy
for nearly a year -- until one partner left.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unlike the other two partners, this man had worked only in
large corporations, far removed from the fast pace and tight
budget of the start-up. "There were big-company vs.
small-company cultural differences," Mr. Granville says. With
hindsight, Mr. Granville says the former partner, Richard L.
Simon, was a poor match in the first place.</p>
<p>Mr. Simon says "many other issues" were involved in the
breakup but he agrees the match was poor. "It's important for
a set of partners to have personal and business values that
click," he says.</p>
<p>In having second thoughts about a business partner, the
Massachusetts entrepreneurs are hardly alone. Steven Berglas,
a Boston psychotherapist, tells of a New England food company
whose two partners "actually got into fistfights."</p>
<p>Lawyers, psychologists and business consultants all say
problems between small-business partners are common. Indeed,
Lewis Shattuck, president of the Smaller Business Association
of New England, thinks some entrepreneurs avoid partnerships
"because of all the horror stories about partnerships that
don't work."</p>
<p>But unless an entrepreneur wants to go it alone and has
the necessary money and talents, he or she may have little
choice but to take on a partner. So many businesses get going
only after the creator of a product is paired with a
financial partner that Wilton S. Sogg, a Cleveland lawyer,
has lectured to business classes about "Barney Bright and
Jerry Gold -- the guy with the idea and the guy with the
money." In arranging such partnerships, "the human part is
more important than the legal documents," Mr. Sogg warns.</p>
<p>Experts say choosing the right partner is one of the most
critical tasks an entrepreneur faces. Successful partners
complement one another, but Mr. Berglas, the psychotherapist,
says many partners vie for control and undercut one another
instead. He tells of a computer-peripherals company run by
two brothers. "Each of them sabotages the other's projects --
it's straight sibling rivalry," he says.</p>
<p>Andrew Martin, a founder of Smartfoods Inc. -- now a
Marlborough, Mass., unit of PepsiCo Inc. -- says he was on
vacation in 1986 when one of his partners, Ken Meyers,
unexpectedly arranged with investment bankers to oust him as
president and assume the title himself. And a former
Smartfoods distributor, Thomas E. Protheroe of Hartford,
Conn., recalls "a lot of bickering going on" among some of
the founders. (Mr. Meyers, still at Smartfoods, insists there
was an orderly transition that Mr. Martin himself had
invited.)</p>
<p>Having had problems with partners, some entrepreneurs are
taking steps to avoid a repeat of the troubles in new
relationships. Mr. Martin says he hopes to avoid surprises
and bickering at Simpak Inc. and Annie's Farm Inc., two
current enterprises that he owns along with partners. To
build trust and talk over differences, he says, "I'm making
sure that we're face to face on a totally nonbusiness basis
for at least one week every year. Hopefully, there won't be
any subterfuge and nobody will do anything behind people's
backs."</p>
<p>Authorities also suggest that prospective partners make
sure their work habits and ethics are compatible. Mr. Sogg,
the lawyer, says he knows one entrepreneur who is "very open
and generous," sharing his knowledge even with potential
competitors, and another who is "very protective of his
business," asking even job applicants to sign secrecy
agreements. "I absolutely wouldn't put them together in a
business deal," Mr. Sogg says.</p>
<p>In choosing partners, some people prefer old friends.
Daniel R. Case, a founder of Application Techniques Inc., a
computer-software maker in Pepperell, Mass., says he avoided
many problems by going into business with Gary M. Cook, whom
he had known for many years. "When you've had a friend for
years, obviously there's a certain level of compatibility,"
he says.</p>
<p>Others agree that personality counts. At Advanced
Marketing Systems Corp., a computer-software company in
Westford, Mass., Chairman Jay K. Alperin has gotten along
well with his partner, Kenneth E. Lajoie. "We had to have a
good sense of humor," Mr. Alperin says. "You really can't
have one person holding grudges."</p>
<p>Partners needn't be close friends, though. Richard Lopata,
a Chicago management consultant, says he had a successful
partnership with Richard E. Petersen for many years. "We
never socialized, we weren't close buddies, but we had a lot
of respect for each other's judgments," Mr. Lopata says.</p>
<p>Close friends or not, successful partners must establish a
decision-making process that works smoothly. In rare cases
where the partners disagree at Application Techniques, Mr.
Case says, he always defers to Mr. Cook. "I've always
respected his authority," Mr. Case says. "You have to have a
structure in a company."</p>
<p>A clear agreement on roles helps. One Cleveland
entrepreneur says he brought in three "passive" partners for
his manufacturing company, which needed their money. At
least, they were supposed to be passive. "As time went on,
they became more and more active in trying to impose their
will," he says. At the now-troubled company, "an inordinate
amount of time is consumed dealing with partners, rather than
dealing with the issues," he says.</p>
<p>Often, it's especially important for partners to
anticipate money-related issues. John C. Rennie, chairman of
Pacer Systems Inc., says he and his partners always agreed on
when -- or whether -- to draw profits from the Billerica,
Mass., electronics company. "I've seen some excellent little
companies blow apart because one guy thought he was building
a comfortable little cash cow, but the others were looking
for explosive growth and capital gains," he says.</p>
<p>Though many problems can be anticipated and resolved
early, the greatest feat is to find a partner who can cope
with the crisis nobody ever predicted, experts say. Warns Mr.
Sogg, "Something unexpected always happens. It's the ability
to roll with the punches that counts."</p>
