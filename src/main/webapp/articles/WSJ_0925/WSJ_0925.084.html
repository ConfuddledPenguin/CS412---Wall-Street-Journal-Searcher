	<p class="article-leader">Panic buying in the wake of Iraqi threats against Middle
East oil fields drove petroleum prices to the highest levels
in a decade.
   The run-up of more than $3 a barrel for some crudes added
to the prospect of inflation, depressed the U.S. stock market
and increased support for tapping into the U.S. Strategic
Petroleum Reserve.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Only a month after breaking the $30 a barrel mark, several
crudes surged beyond $39 a barrel in trading with the U.S.
futures price reaching $39.20 briefly. Some North Sea oil was
valued at $40 a barrel on European spot markets in late
trading, although details of transactions at those levels
weren't confirmed.</p>
<p>Even though it dropped back from the high, crude traded on
the New York Mercantile Exchange posted a futures record.
Crude oil for November delivery was up $2.82 a barrel to
settle at $38.25. That was the highest price for this type of
oil, a light low-sulfur crude, since West Texas Intermediate,
the U.S. benchmark, reached $39.80 a barrel in the cash
market in March 1980.</p>
<p>Fuels reflected the escalation in crude oil prices. In
U.S. futures trading, heating oil and unleaded gasoline for
October delivery rose nearly seven cents a gallon each to
settle at $1.04 a gallon each.</p>
<p>The oil-price surge followed a weekend statement from
Baghdad by Saddam Hussein that he would strike at Middle East
oil fields before he would let U.S.-led sanctions "strangle"
Iraq. Although the Iraqi president has issued warnings
against a U.S. attack on Iraq, his new remarks were
interpreted as indicating he might strike first.</p>
<p>Iraq failed in its eight-year war with Iran to halt that
nation's oil flow. Oil and military analysts questioned
whether Iraq could be any more successful in destroying Saudi
Arabia's well-defended installations if it tried.</p>
<p>Still, Saddam Hussein's statement advanced war fears
another notch and kept alive the possibility of major
disruptions of the flow of oil from the Middle East, which
holds the bulk of the world's reserves. As a result, the new
threats were quickly reflected in higher petroleum prices
around the world as trading opened yesterday.</p>
<p>"The market is very, very jittery," said Peter Beutel,
director of the energy group at Pegasus Econometric. "People
are afraid we are going to see a war in the Middle East."</p>
<p>Few oil analysts were bold enough to forecast the
direction of the oil market after the rapid escalation of
recent days. Several suggested that $40 is no longer out of
reach and that $65 may well be the likely target, as some
studies have predicted, if war breaks out.</p>
<p>Most private and government energy officials continued to
maintain that the industry's supply-demand fundamentals don't
justify the current levels of pricing. Barring an extremely
cold winter or a disruption, oil supplies should be ample,
they said.</p>
<p>"The market is anticipating an awful lot," said Peter
Gignoux, manager of the international energy desk in London
for Shearson Lehman Brothers. "Without hostilities, we are
totally, fully priced."</p>
<p>Most oil economists agreed that oil market participants
are clearly reacting to the words of Saddam Hussein. "The
market now is suggesting we are on a war footing," said
Lawrence Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry
Research Foundation, "and a war premium has been built into
the {pricing} system."</p>
<p>The Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a non-profit
organization that receives some financing from oil companies,
is a leading supporter of opening up the U.S. Strategic
Petroleum Reserve to help damp the escalation in oil prices.
Its position is that the artificially high prices damage
economies.</p>
<p>"We believe it's time to release SPR barrels" to prevent
further deterioration of the U.S. economy, said Mr.
Goldstein.</p>
<p>Under the law that established the reserve, President Bush
must make a "finding" that there is justification for
commercial releases of oil from the reserve because of an oil
shortage. But proponents of opening the reserve contend that
the evidence of supply restraints won't show up until long
after the shortage has begun.</p>
<p>A test of the system is planned for next month, however.
Recent legislation approved by Congress to establish a new
target of one billion barrels of oil for the reserve, which
contains slightly under 600 million barrels, would permit
withdrawals, totaling as much as five million barrels, in
such a test.</p>
<p>"It could have the same psychological effect on the market
that a commercial release would have," Mr. Goldstein said.</p>
