	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Three investors filed suit against Unocal
Corp. over the recent conversion of its Union Exploration
Partners Ltd. to a corporation, claiming that investors are
losing income and substantial tax benefits as a result.
   Unocal has said the newly created Union Exploration Corp.
will pay a yearly corporate dividend, fully taxable, of only
40 cents a unit. In 1989, unit holders got $1.8188 per unit,
the lawsuit says.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Unocal spokesmen couldn't be reached yesterday evening to
comment on the suit, which seeks class action status and
unspecified damages. Unocal said in June that it was
converting the partnership to a corporation, effective Aug.
1, because of recent tax law revisions and "the improving
climate for investments in domestic oil and gas exploration
and development."</p>
<p>Unocal created the partnership in 1985 to hold its
gas-rich properties in the Gulf of Mexico as part of its
takeover defense against raider T. Boone Pickens. Unocal and
its Union Oil Co. of California subsidiary held a controlling
95% stake and sold the rest for $22 a unit to the public,
primarily small investors who wanted a steady stream of
tax-deferred cash payments. In the weeks after Unocal
announced the conversion, the market value of the partnership
units fell to less than $12 a unit from $18.25.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, filed in federal court here, investors
Thomas Farber, Louis Cohen and Harold Browner allege that
Unocal failed to disclose in documents issued in connection
with the conversion that the original partnership agreement
required consent of holders of 98% of the units for any such
a conversion. The company allegedly has said it didn't need
approval from the public unitholders for the change, the suit
claims.</p>
