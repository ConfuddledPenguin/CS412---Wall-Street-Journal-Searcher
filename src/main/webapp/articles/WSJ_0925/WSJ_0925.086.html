	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's steady grip on credit
is reducing any chance of skirting a recession and could
prolong one if it occurs, according to Bush administration
and private economists.
   The Fed's interest-rate policies haven't changed since
midsummer. But economic statistics released since then
suggest the economy is grinding to a halt. Employment growth
is the slowest it has been since the 1982 recession. The
housing and construction industries are in a deepening slump.
Consumers, after borrowing and spending heavily throughout
most of the 1980s, seem to have run out of steam.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Concerns about the economy, and the Fed's reluctance to
ease rates, is also causing the stock market to plummet.
Yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at
2452.97, off 59.41.</p>
<p>"Recession seems very likely unless something changes very
promptly," says Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern
Trust Co. in Chicago. An easing of short-term interest rates
by the Fed might prevent or cushion a recession, he said.</p>
<p>Administration officials express growing frustration at
the Fed's unwillingness to move. Holding interest rates
steady in the face of a weakening economy, they argue,
amounts in effect to a tightening of credit.</p>
<p>But Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan expresses concern about
rising oil prices, a plummeting bond market and signs of
inflation in areas other than oil. As a result, he continues
to hold credit firm.</p>
<p>At a meeting late last month, a majority of the members of
the Fed's policy-setting committee leaned in favor of a
modest reduction in rates, according to officials who
attended that meeting. The committee apparently gave Mr.
Greenspan the leeway to make a modest cut in short-term rates
if conditions allowed it.</p>
<p>But the Fed chairman so far hasn't used that discretionary
authority, causing considerable grumbling among top
administration officials. And in testimony to Congress last
week, Mr. Greenspan gave little reason to expect an easing
soon.</p>
<p>His tough anti-inflation stance received some moral
support this weekend from the finance ministers and central
bankers of the seven leading industrial nations, who met in
Washington. The group largely rejected the arguments of
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady that lower interest rates
are needed, and instead called for "stability-oriented
monetary policies." Most of the six other nations continue to
grow at a solid pace, and thus face a greater risk of
inflation than recession.</p>
<p>Some administration officials speculate that Mr. Greenspan
may be delaying any easing move to put pressure on the budget
negotiations between the White House and Congress.
Negotiators are aiming for a budget agreement by the end of
the week.</p>
<p>Mr. Dederick argues that Fed officials also know that even
if there is a recession, they won't get the blame this time.
"It's not the Fed that shocked the economy," he says, "it's
Saddam Hussein."</p>
<p>Mr. Greenspan spoke yesterday to the National Association
of Business Economists but gave no clues to his thinking on
current policy.</p>
<p>Lee Hoskins, president of the Cleveland Federal Reserve
Bank and a voting member of the Fed's policy-making Open
Market Committee, also spoke to the business economists
yesterday and underscored his anti-inflation views. He said
he favors a tight policy that would prevent the price level
from deviating by more than two percentage points from its
base line. "When prices deviate from the base line level, the
Fed should act to bring prices back in line," he said.</p>
<p>"Critics contend that events like the Persian Gulf
conflict and the consequent oil-price shock make achieving
price stability impossible," he said. "What these critics
fail to recognize is that an economic environment where price
stability is credible and expected is considerably different
than the environment in which we have lived over the past two
decades or so."</p>
<p>Mr. Hoskins, along with Fed Governor Wayne Angell, opposed
any tilt toward easing at the August meeting of the Fed's
policy committee.</p>
