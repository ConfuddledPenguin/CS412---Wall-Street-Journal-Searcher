	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A fledgling investment boutique of Lehman
Brothers alumni folded, and several top partners joined
another Wall Street firm headed by former Lehman executives.
   The dissolution of Stamford Co. stemmed from a sudden
pullback of capital by its parent, Stamford Capital Group
Inc., amid the deep slump in the investment banking business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Launched last year by Sheldon S. Gordon, former vice
chairman at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., Stamford was
modeled after Wall Street's traditional investment banking
partnerships. But trading losses and a slowdown in merger
activity and other traditional investment banking activities
stung the firm badly.</p>
<p>The demise of the firm -- its core partners were all
former executives of Lehman Brothers, which was bought by
Shearson in 1984 -- is a vivid reminder of the difficulty
facing Wall Street's investment banking boutiques these days.</p>
<p>"The real lesson here is that it has to be the right idea
with the right people at the right time," Mr. Gordon said,
adding that he will concentrate now on private investing. "We
had the right idea with the right people, but the timing was
poor."</p>
<p>Several of Stamford's top partners, meanwhile, have jumped
to another securities firm with strong Lehman ties: Primerica
Corp.'s Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. They include James
Boshart, who was hired at Lehman Brothers 20 years ago by
Lewis Glucksman, who now is a Smith Barney vice chairman. Mr.
Boshart will head Smith Barney's corporate finance
operations.</p>
<p>Clifford Goldman, Stamford's former chief financial
officer and another former Lehman executive, will become a
managing director supervising Smith Barney's administration.
Mr. Goldman initially will focus on the financial reporting
of the firm's businesses, a Smith Barney spokesman said.</p>
<p>Another senior Stamford partner, Judah Frankel, will join
Smith Barney as a managing director in its mortgage-backed
securities department. Several other former Lehman executives
have left Stamford in the past several months, as the firm's
fortunes have sagged.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some of Stamford's business lines are likely to
be bought soon by senior management as separate entities,
people familiar with the firm said. For example, Stamford's
corporate finance and mergers group, which focused on
companies involving transactions valued at between $15
million and $150 million, is likely to be bought out by a
small group led by Arnold Hoffman, another former Lehman
executive who ran Stamford's middle-market merger activity,
the people said.</p>
<p>A planned partner in the new entity, to be called Middle
Market Group L.P., is Shearson Lehman Brothers itself.
Shearson's interest stemmed from a joint venture worked out
with Stamford last year, in which each firm received revenue
from certain transactions involving midsized companies.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Shearson, a unit of American Express Co.,
said, "We'll continue to have an interest in the
middle-market group."</p>
