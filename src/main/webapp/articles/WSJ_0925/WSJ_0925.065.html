	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- U.S. government bond yields rose to their
highest levels since March 1989 as soaring oil prices stung
investors around the world. Long-term Treasury bonds now
yield about 9.2%, up from 9.12% last Friday. Bond prices,
which move in the opposite direction of yields, fell 5/8 of a
point, or $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount. Bond prices also
slumped in Germany and the U.K.
   Traders fear higher oil prices will lead to significantly
higher inflation, the archenemy of fixed-income investments.
Many investors also fear higher inflation will torpedo hopes
for credit-easing moves anytime soon by the Federal Reserve
and other major central banks. Thus, more investors are
shying away from long-term bonds and turning instead to
short-term Treasury bills, noted for safety and security.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We're still fighting the same battles: tensions are
escalating in the Middle East, oil prices are up sharply, and
there's no agreement" on how to cut the U.S. government's
huge budget deficit, said Steven Saslow, executive managing
director at Carroll McEntee & McGinley Inc. "So buyers are on
the sidelines." Treasury bills are increasingly popular among
investors, he said, "because money is seeking a safety net,
and the safest instruments are Treasurys."</p>
<p>Investors are especially leery of bonds and stocks issued
by major New York banks. For example, prices tumbled
yesterday on bonds of Citicorp, Chemical Banking Corp. and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</p>
<p>Fears are widespread that Chase Manhattan Corp.'s recent
dividend cut and its decision to reduce its staff by 5,000
employees could signal troubles at other large banks. Several
traders cited an article in The Wall Street Journal yesterday
that quoted a banking industry executive as saying that a
high-ranking official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
had told him Chase isn't the weakest of the New York
money-center banks.</p>
<p>The Fed official was said to be surprised that it was
Chase, and not another bank, that was getting so much
negative attention in the stock market. The official didn't
identify the other bank or explain his criteria for weakness.
Yesterday afternoon, a Fed spokesman said the Fed would have
no comment.</p>
<p>However, several bond dealers said trading in bank bonds
yesterday was very light, allowing even relatively small
trades to produce large price swings. Some traders also argue
that investors are overreacting to the Chase news, and that
yields on bank bonds already more than compensate investors
for the perceived risks.</p>
<p>"The rumors in the market today are patently ridiculous,
and I don't think it is responsible to give them any
credence," said Michael Callen, sector executive in charge of
Citibank's wholesale banking division for the U.S. and the
rest of the developed world. "We have a very different
profile than other banks in New York, and we have very
different types of earnings streams." Mr. Callen also
reiterated his comment in yesterday's Wall Street Journal
that "no one around here is talking about a dividend cut."</p>
<p>Whatever the case, the price of Citicorp's 9.75%
subordinated capital notes, due in 1999, fell about 2 1/4
points to 89 5/8. The yield jumped to 11.65% from 11.15%
Friday.</p>
<p>Chemical Banking's 9.75% subordinated capital notes, due
in 1999, fell to 75 7/8, down one point from Friday, to yield
14.75%, up from 14.50%. Manufacturers Hanover's 8.50%
subordinated capital notes, due in 1999, now yield 12.70%, up
from 12.50% late Friday.</p>
<p>However, Chase Manhattan bonds, which have fallen sharply
recently, held steady yesterday even as the company's stock
dropped sharply again.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the credit markets, prices of junk bonds,
those issued by companies with low credit ratings or no
ratings at all, fell sharply. Among the hardest hit were
bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc., Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.,
Ralphs Grocery Co. and Marriott Corp. Traders said the stock
market's sharp drop yesterday unnerved junk-bond investors
already worried that the economy's weakness will hurt
companies struggling to cope with heavy debt burdens.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Investors reacted to higher oil prices by shunning
long-term bonds.</p>
<p>Among actively traded issues, the government's 30-year
bonds were quoted late yesterday at a price of 95 20/32, down
about 5/8 point. The yield rose to 9.17% from 9.12%.</p>
<p>Traders say the 9.17% yield late yesterday was the highest
closing level of any day this year and also the highest
closing level on a comparable Treasury issue in at least a
year and a half. Several other long-term issues that are less
actively traded now offer even higher yields than the 30-year
issue. For example, some Treasury bonds now yield about 9
3/8.</p>
<p>Today, the Treasury will sell new two-year notes. Trading
in the "when-issued" market yesterday, those notes were
quoted at a yield of 8.17%, up from 8.10% Friday. The yield
on the new four-year Treasury notes, to be sold tomorrow,
rose to 8.54% from 8.48%.</p>
<p>"The market got killed" because Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein "was rattling sabers," said David Resler, senior vice
president at Nomura Securities International Inc. "A lot of
the movement {in Treasury bond prices} was off of oil and the
heightened uncertainty about what's going on in the Middle
East."</p>
<p>The Treasury yesterday held its regular weekly sale of new
three-month and sixmonth bills. Here are details:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>
<p>                               13-Week       26-Week</p>
<p>Applications ............ $32,765,965,000 $24,809,290,000</p>
<p>Accepted bids ...........  $9,239,630,000  $9,205,195,000</p>
<p>Accepted at low price ...             62%             54%</p>
<p>Accepted noncompet'ly ...  $1,575,025,000  $1,401,050,000</p>
<p>Average price (Rate) ....  98.150 (7.32%)  96.294 (7.33%)</p>
<p>High price (Rate) .......  98.157 (7.29%)  96.309 (7.30%)</p>
<p>Low price (Rate) ........  98.150 (7.32%)  96.289 (7.34%)</p>
<p>Coupon equivalent .......           7.56%           7.73%</p>
<p>Both issues are dated Sept. 27, 1990. The 13-week bills
mature Dec. 27, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Mar. 28,
1991.</p>
<p>Corporate & Junk Bonds</p>
<p>Corporate bond prices slumped, with junk bonds posting
especially large declines.</p>
<p>Among the biggest decliners were junk bonds of RJR Nabisco
Inc., Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., Ralphs Grocery Co. and
Marriott Corp.</p>
<p>RJR Nabisco's 17.375% convertible payin-kind debentures,
due in 2009, finished down 1 7/8 points to close at 109 5/8
on the New York Stock Exchange. The other widely-held RJR
issue, the 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures, maturing
in 2007, ended 2 1/8 points lower at 85 3/8. RJR pay-in-kind
bonds pay interest in the form of additional bonds instead of
cash.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, junk bonds of Carter Hawley Hale continued to
plummet. Carter Hawley's 12.25% senior subordinated notes,
maturing in 1996, finished down six points at 57 while its
12.50% senior subordinated debentures, maturing in 2002,
ended down three points at 51.</p>
<p>Prices of bonds issued by Carter Hawley and many other
retailers have been hammered in recent weeks by fears that
consumer spending will be light this Christmas because of the
economy's weakness.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, in the high-yield market, Ralphs Grocery's 14%
senior subordinated debentures, due in 2000, dropped five
points to 77.</p>
<p>Marriott's 9.125% senior notes, due in 1995, fell five
points to 91, while its 9.375% debentures, due in 2007,
finished down four points at 92 1/2.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, prices of many investment-grade corporate bonds
also slumped, with some actively traded issues falling about
1/2 point. Larger declines, though, came on bonds of several
large New York banks.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Actively traded municipal bonds posted losses of 1/2 point
to one point in a fairly active session, suffering the same
fate as the other bond markets as oil prices surged.</p>
<p>The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20% bond due 2018
closed one point lower at 95 3/4, boosting the yield to 7.55%
from 7.47% late Friday.</p>
<p>No sizable municipal issues of more than $50 million were
priced yesterday.</p>
<p>Mortgage & Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed securities fell 1/8 to 3/8, also hurt by
soaring oil prices.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2%
securities for October delivery fell 1/4 point to 97 21/32,
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2% gold participation
certificates fell 7/32 to 98 5/32, and Federal National
Mortgage Association's 9 1/2% securities fell 7/32 to 97
31/32.</p>
<p>In the asset-backed market, Morgan Stanley & Co. and
Norwest Investment Services Inc. priced $400 million of
creditcard certificates at 99.9375 to yield 9.11%. The
securities are collateralized with Visa and MasterCard
receivables sold by Norwest Bank Iowa, a unit of Norwest
Corp.</p>
<p>Separately, Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc. has set up a
"special purpose corporation," called Hamilton Funding Corp.,
to finance the purchase of short-term, money market
securities off balance sheet. The maximum size of this
"asset-backed commercial paper program" will be $1.5 billion.
Hamilton yesterday issued just under $200 million of
commercial paper and hopes to issue between $500 million and
$1 billion by Friday.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>German and British government bond prices fell yesterday,
hurt by higher oil prices and fears of additional turmoil in
the Middle East.</p>
<p>Bonn's 8 1/2% issue due 2000 dropped 0.38 point to 96.19
to yield 9.095%. British government bond prices also ended
lower. Britain's 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 fell 1/2 point
to 99 25/32 to yield 11.76%.</p>
<p>However, shorter-term British bonds were little changed.
For example, the U.K.'s 12% bonds due 1995 fell only 3/32 of
a point to 99 28/32 to yield 12%. And the 11 3/4% bonds due
1991 were unchanged at 99 1/8 to yield 14.32%.</p>
