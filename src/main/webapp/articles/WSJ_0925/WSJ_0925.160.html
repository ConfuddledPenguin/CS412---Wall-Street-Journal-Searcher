	<p class="article-leader">BURBANK, Calif. -- Walt Disney Co.'s home video unit will
release "Dick Tracy" about one week before Christmas, priced
for the rental market at $94.95, according to individuals
close to the situation.
   But in a twist, Disney will then provide extensive
marketing support to retailers who want to slash prices and
sell the used tapes to consumers about a month later.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The "rent and sell" program reflects Disney's ambivalence
about whether "Dick Tracy" is more suited to the rental or
sale markets. Last summer, video distributors said the film
seemed a shoo-in to be priced at $20 to $25 for sale directly
to consumers. It appeared to have all the attributes for
"sell-through" -- big box office success, appeal to children,
music, a distinctive visual style attractive to collectors --
and Disney executives were reported to have decided to
release it in November as a sell-through title.</p>
<p>But "Dick Tracy" ran out of gas in theaters after the $100
million mark, while an earlier Disney release, "Pretty
Woman," continued to win audiences all summer long. Disney
market research showed that "Pretty Woman" was the strongest
potential film for sell-through, especially to younger women.</p>
<p>"Pretty Woman" will join Disney's animated films "Peter
Pan" and "The Little Mermaid" in stores during the Christmas
buying season. Disney officials are said to feel the market
will be too glutted for another major sell-through title,
especially when other companies are releasing "Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles," "Total Recall" and other films.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Disney preferred not to wait until next year
because its marketing campaign for "Dick Tracy" is losing
voltage.</p>
