	<p class="article-leader">Walk down most any Main Street these days and it's hard to
miss the parade of pedestrian billboards: kids sporting Bart
Simpson regalia, men in Marlboro T-shirts, ladies in Porsche
sunglasses.
   But what you might dismiss as more commercial clutter, ad
agency D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles sees as the next
frontier in advertising revenue. In what DMB&B says is an
industry first, the shop has set up a trademark licensing
division to create in-house a service that often has been
overlooked or is merely an afterthought.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>DMB&B says offering the licensing services, in which a
client's corporate logo is emblazoned on just about any kind
of apparel, product or accessory in exchange for a small cut
of the sales, is but one more effort to provide top-drawer
communications services to its clients.</p>
<p>But the shop, like all other agencies, clearly needs to
come up with new services to help offset declining revenues
as many clients, recession-wary, tighten their ad budgets. As
the licensing business has grown -- world-wide merchandising
revenues now approximate $65 billion, according to the
Licensing Letter -- executives at DMB&B have marked it as a
potential gold mine. It's a business, they say, that Madison
Avenue can't afford to ignore.</p>
<p>"We think licensing should and will take its place as a
very well-regarded and effective marketing tool," says Bill
Haney, a senior vice president at DMB&B who leads the shop's
licensing group. He calls licensing the "fifth arrow" in the
marketing quiver, following advertising, public relations,
direct mail and sales promotion.</p>
<p>Traditionally, companies that agree to "license" their
logos hire an independent licensing agent or use an on-staff
executive to find suppliers -- makers of T-shirts or
thermoses, for example -- that will pay them a fee for
permission to make and sell products adorned with a
particular logo. The agent, of course, gets a handsome cut of
the sales.</p>
<p>Now DMB&B would like to wrest control of their clients'
licensing budgets away from those independent agents and
provide the service on its own, pocketing the fees in the
process.</p>
<p>Though just in its infancy, DMB&B's new licensing
operation already has one blue-chip client signed up: General
Motors, which has enlisted the agency to supervise licensing
for its Cadillac and Pontiac divisions. The shop is helping
GM slap its logos on everything from driving gloves to toy
cars.</p>
<p>GM has a huge licensing program, with about 500 separate
licensing agreements. The auto maker had been handling all of
its licensing arrangements in-house, but an increasingly
heavy work load prompted the company to begin a search for an
independent agent about a year before DMB&B first offered to
handle the business.</p>
<p>"We had already come to the conclusion that to do it right
was really more than we were capable of doing alone," says
Ken Enborg, trademark counsel at GM. "I was excited about
DMB&B picking up the torch."</p>
<p>DMB&B says it recently struck a joint venture with Bliss
House, an independent licensing agent, and executives there
will work alongside staffers at DMB&B's office in Bloomfield
Hills, Mich. The shop will explain the licensing
opportunities to all of its clients soon and plans to offer
the capability world-wide after the first of the year.</p>
<p>It's not clear, though, how successful DMB&B or other
agencies that jump onto the licensing bandwagon will be. To
be a big hit, the agency will have to convince some of its
clients to sever relationships with independent agents or
close down in-house operations. Anheuser-Busch, whose
Budweiser brand is handled by DMB&B, directs its own
licensing activities in-house. Another large client, Procter
& Gamble, says it doesn't do much licensing of its
trademarks, anyway.</p>
<p>Nor are the people that DMB&B would like to put out of
business -- independent agents -- likely to cotton to the
agency's plans. "I don't think it's a natural thing for an ad
agency to be involved in," says a spokeswoman for Licensing
Corp. of America, a Time Warner unit that peddles Bugs Bunny,
Daffy Duck and other Warner cartoon characters, as well as
coordinating licensees for corporate monikers like Burger
King and Pillsbury. "I wish them luck, but it's a highly
specialized trade. Time will tell if they'll be able to make
a go of it."</p>

<p>Corporate Ads Set Pace</p>
<p>Spending for corporate advertising continued to outpace
overall ad spending in 1989, according to a study by Public
Relations Journal, a trade magazine.</p>
<p>Corporate advertising, which generally focuses on the
company rather than specific products, was up 11.5% to nearly
$1.4 billion. Overall ad spending, at $123.9 billion, rose
only 5%.</p>
<p>Sears Roebuck bumped out American Telephone & Telegraph as
the No. 1 corporate spender, while Ford maintained its No. 2
spot. Chrysler, Campeau and Prudential Insurance rounded out
the top five. AT&T wasn't even in the top 10.</p>
<p>Much of the gain in corporate ads came from spending on
cable-TV networks, which rose 91%; Sunday magazines, up 86%;
and network radio, up 37%. Those increases reflect a growing
tendency to "narrow-cast" messages, said James Foster, author
of the study and president and chief executive of
Brouillard/LGFE, a WPP Group unit. Corporate ad spending on
outdoor ads and network TV fell.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>BUY-BACK: Interpublic Group, which suspended a stock
buy-back a month ago, said it resumed buying back its common
shares on a regular basis. The company suspended the
repurchase program pending its acquisition of the remainder
of Britain's Lowe Group. Interpublic authorized the buy-back
of up to 5.1 million shares in 1986 as part of a strategy to
"enhance shareholder value," a spokesman said. When the
buy-back was suspended, the company had repurchased about 3.4
million shares. Interpublic has more than 33 million shares
outstanding.</p>
<p>TRUMP SHUTTLE: Trump Organization, New York, pulled its
Trump Shuttle ad account from Scali McCabe Sloves, New York,
and awarded it to Great Scott Advertising, a small New York
shop. Billings were estimated at $8 million to $10 million
when Scali McCabe, a unit of WPP Group, won the business last
year, but the account now is believed to be much smaller.</p>
<p>WHO'S NEWS: James K. Agnew resigned as general manager of
J. Walter Thompson's Los Angeles office "to pursue other
career interests." Mr. Agnew said he had expected to be
assigned an international post, but that an offer never
materialized. Thompson, a WPP Group unit, said Bill Lane,
executive vice president of JWT West, would assume Mr.
Agnew's duties.</p>
