	<p class="article-leader">Your Aug. 27 editorial "EPA v. Private Property" was very
timely for us here in Chatham County, Ga. Under the new
guidelines for wetlands determination, it has been estimated
that 85% of the undeveloped land in Chatham is now wetlands.
Consequently, use of this land has come to a screeching halt.
There have been numerous meetings with the government
agencies concerned and they have come up only with evasive
replies.
   I own a tract of land that was originally granted by King
George II in 1758. The only restrictions in the grant are
that "all White Pine trees if any . . . and . . . one Tenth
part of Mines of Silver and Gold" are reserved for the King
and his heirs. Also, certain developments must take place in
a given time frame. This includes that for "every fifty Acres
. . . do Clear and drain three Acres of Swamp or sunken
ground or drain three Acres of Marsh if any such contained
herein. . . ."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Our forefathers threw off this yoke of oppression and
tyranny for freedom and rule by the people. Now this new
government has declared 95% of my land as wetlands coming
under its jurisdiction and control. I may do nothing in this
area without applying for permission, at which time the
government will decide what I may or may not do and how it is
to be done, if at all.</p>
<p>There is now in this county a backlog of more than 3,000
requests before the government for wetland permits, delaying
infrastructure projects, economic development efforts and use
of property by private citizens. Comparing these current
rules and regulations with those of the oppressive king, I am
starting to wonder if we really do have more freedom than
before. Was our Revolution really a success or did we just
trade one House of Lords for another?</p>
<p>By the way, there are no white pine trees on the land and
I'm still looking for the silver and gold.</p>

<p>In addition to your usual ranting and raving about
environmental regulation, your editorial proclaims that
"private property rights lead to a cleaner environment
because they imply individual responsibility." Has it
occurred to you that the unchecked exercise of "private
property rights" led to many of the thousands of abandoned
toxic-waste sites now being addressed by the federal
Superfund law and similar state statues?</p>
<p>Also, please describe something desirable about the
relentless assertion of "private property rights" now
ravaging the South American rain forests.</p>
<p>And please note that "hoi polloi" is not correctly
proceeded by the article "the."</p>

<p>In your Aug. 20 editorial "Whose Wetlands Mistake?" you
have tried to characterize the federal wetlands regulatory
program on the basis of a single event. If prosecutors played
fast and loose with John Pozsgai, who was convicted of
turning a wetland into a dump, then Mr. Pozsgai should be
granted relief and the prosecutors curbed. That's not
editorial material. Your statement that this is an example of
arrogance on the part of the environmental community is, and
it's wrong.</p>
<p>The environmental community's use of the full weight of
the law is a cornerstone available to all members of our
society. Your condemnation of its use by the environmental
community is unworthy of a paper of your stature. The
national abuse of wetlands and its serious adverse
consequences to public health, welfare and safety have been
well documented. If your staff is among those who still
believe that environmental concerns are an exercise in
exaggeration, I recommend an assignment to Eastern Europe or
China to see firsthand, as I have, the human misery brought
about by that mind-set.</p>
