	<p class="article-leader">MINNEAPOLIS -- First Bank System Inc. said Darrell G.
Knudson, 53-year-old vice chairman and a director, will
retire Dec. 31, and will, "as available, continue to be an
adviser" to the bank holding company.
   Mr. Knudson was First Bank System's acting chief executive
officer, following the September 1989 resignation of D.H.
Ankeny Jr., until John H. Grundhofer was named chairman and
chief executive last January. Mr. Grundhofer said Mr. Knudson
"had this company moving in the right direction by the time I
got here."</p>
