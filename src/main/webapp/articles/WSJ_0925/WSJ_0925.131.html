	<p class="article-leader">General Binding Corp., Northbrook, Ill., intends to
acquire VeloBind Inc. for $50 million, or $9.77 a share, the
companies said.
   VeloBind's stock crept up recently before the Fremont,
Calif., maker of office binding systems acknowledged it was
in merger talks. The stock price jumped $1.125 a share in
over-the-counter trading to $7.50 on Friday, Sept. 14. The
following Monday, when VeloBind disclosed it was in merger
discussions with an unidentified company, the stock advanced
another $1.125, to $8.625. It closed yesterday at $8.75, off
25 cents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The proposed merger, expected to be completed by Dec. 28,
needs the approval of VeloBind shareholders and government
regulators. Proposed terms call for General Binding, a maker
and marketer of business machines and related supplies, to
buy all of VeloBind's shares outstanding and options to
purchase shares.</p>
