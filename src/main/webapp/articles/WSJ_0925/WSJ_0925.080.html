	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Gold futures posted the largest one-day gain
in more than three years as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
raised Mideast tensions another notch and oil prices boomed
to record highs.
   The most-active December gold contract ended with a gain
of $13.80 an ounce at $408.30, just under the high of the day
of $409. It was the largest one-day gain since April 14,
1987, when the April contract also advanced $13.80 to
$450.90, according to the Commodity Exchange in New York. It
was the first time the December contract was above $400 since
Aug. 24, when it settled at $423.20, the exchange also noted.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The gold rally pulled up silver and platinum prices, which
had been laggards in recent trading. December silver rose
12.5 cents an ounce to $4.9950. October platinum was up $8.40
an ounce at $460.70.</p>
<p>"This is a very uncertain market," said Sharon Ziemian,
vice president of Citibank. "The market is turning on the
perception of Middle Eastern problems and the price of oil,
depending on whatever military problems develop there."</p>
<p>War jitters were triggered by bellicose statements by
President Hussein over the weekend, and resulted in a record
futures price for crude oil at $39.20 a barrel on the New
York Mercantile Exchange. In Europe, Brent crude was reported
to have traded at $40 a barrel, according to analysts.</p>
<p>In gold, as a result, there was heavy buying of contracts
that had been previously sold by traders in the expectation
of lower prices, analysts said. As December gold thrust above
$400, the advance was accelerated by waiting buy orders that
were triggered by prices rising through that area, they said.</p>
<p>One analyst said a contributing factor to the strong rise
was that producers hadn't sold into the rally as has been the
case in recent years, stifling advances. However, he noted,
"If we get another rise of this kind, it will certainly
encourage them to become active sellers."</p>
<p>Another analyst observed that last week there was some
hope of a diplomatic resolution to the Middle Eastern crisis,
"but those hopes were destroyed by President Hussein's
comments."</p>
<p>Peter Cardillo, director of commodity research for Jesup
Josephthal & Co., said that gold has a strong technical base
and that December could top $425. That price has been a
strong resistance level as far back as March; since July four
attempts to go above $425 have been unsuccessful. "The
current advance can even go as high as $435 or $440," he
said.</p>
<p>According to Ken Gettinger, vice president of Union Bank
of Switzerland's New York office, "President Hussein's
comments apparently convinced traders that some kind of
military action is inevitable, with the only question as when
it is going to happen."</p>
<p>Mr. Gettinger said that along with the record prices in
oil, a sharp drop in the stock market also contributed to
gold's strength.</p>
<p>"Traders are speculating that the December price might hit
$410, and that there's no telling how high it can go if
there's military action," he said.</p>
<p>Giving the market a sound underpinning, one analyst said,
was that demand for gold bullion had picked up in Europe for
the first time in a while.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Mounting concern about the size of
the Soviet grain harvest, and rising inflation fears, boosted
futures prices. Harvest delays are continuing in the Soviet
Union because of bureaucratic inefficiencies and shortages of
fuel and tractor spare parts. The delays are causing analysts
to boost their estimates of tens of millions of bushels of
grain that are likely to rot in the fields this season, and
predict that the Soviets will receive some form of export
grants from the U.S. in the near future. Meanwhile, sharply
higher gold and crude oil futures prices rekindled concern
that the inflation rate would rise at a brisker pace than in
recent months. Grain and soybean prices typically advance
during inflationary periods. Wheat futures for December
delivery gained five cents a bushel to close at $2.7525.
December corn futures advanced three cents a bushel to close
at $2.2875 and November soybean futures added two cents a
bushel to close at $6.1350.</p>
<p>COFFEE: Futures prices declined. The December contract
ended 3.5 cents a pound lower at 94 cents. According to one
analyst, Brazil, at an International Coffee Organization
meeting in London over the weekend, left the door open for
further negotiation on the restoration of quotas and prices
in the International Coffee Agreement, but wasn't ready to
engage in negotiations now. The agreement expires in
September 1991, and Brazil was agreeable to extension of the
current administrative agreement for one year, the analyst
said. Apparently there were some traders who were harboring
hopes that negotiations might begin on economic clauses of
the agreement and were disappointed when that didn't happen,
according to the analyst. However, she said, this is the
season when roaster demand for green coffee picks up, which
could help prices to level off and even recover somewhat.</p>
<p>COTTON: Futures prices dropped sharply. The
soonest-to-expire October contract, which has no trading
limits, was off by 4.09 cents a pound at one point under
heavy selling before partly recovering to end at 73.70 cents,
down 1.95 cents. The decline was accelerated as the price
dropped below key support levels. The December, March and May
contracts all were down by their daily limit of two cents a
pound at one point. December settled at 71.14 cents, down
1.90 cents. The October contract actually started off with a
gain of 0.25 cent, said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for
Prudential-Bache, but then the boom in oil prices and the
drop in the stock market created concern that the already
slumping economy could get worse. "This would translate in
fewer textile sales and a drop in demand for cotton," Mr.
Simon said.</p>
