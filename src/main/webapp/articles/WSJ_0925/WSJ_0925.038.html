	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Founder Peter Diamandis and two other top
executives of Hachette S.A.'s Diamandis Communications Inc.
abruptly left the magazine publisher in a falling out with
their French parent company.
   Hachette said in a statement yesterday that it would
rename the unit Hachette Magazines. Hachette said that while
Mr. Diamandis's contract does not expire until Dec. 31, it
had been "mutually agreed that his employment would
terminate" yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Diamandis, who was until yesterday president and chief
executive officer of Diamandis Communications Inc., declined
to comment. The 58-year-old executive had said recently that
he wanted to stay with DCI, the magazine company he had
created in October 1987, when he led a leveraged buy-out of
CBS Inc.'s magazine division. Six months after the buy-out,
Mr. Diamandis sold his company for $712 million to Hachette,
making a substantial profit.</p>
<p>But in recent months, Hachette and Mr. Diamandis clashed
openly over the handling of DCI magazines; Mr. Diamandis said
he felt a personal allegiance to the editors and publishers
of his magazines. Mr. Diamandis and Hachette failed to come
to terms at a board meeting last Tuesday, where Mr. Diamandis
reportedly opposed a planned restructuring that would involve
layoffs and the possible sale of magazine titles.</p>
<p>Hachette executives didn't return calls, but in a release,
Daniel Filipacchi, vice chairman of Hachette, said the
company was committed to the magazines "while striving to
maximize the company's efficiency and reducing waste." Mr.
Filipacchi will take on Mr. Diamandis's role as chairman and
chief executive of Hachette magazines.</p>
<p>Also departing yesterday were two other high-ranking
executives who with Mr. Diamandis had formed the management
group that led the buy-out of CBS. They include Robert F.
Spillane, executive vice president of DCI, and Arthur Sukel,
senior vice president and chief financial officer. By
yesterday afternoon, the offices of Messrs. Diamandis,
Spillane and Sukel had been cleaned out and personal items
stored in boxes, according to company insiders. Messrs.
Spillane and Sukel also couldn't be reached.</p>
<p>DCI publishes 17 magazines and about 50 special, one-time
titles, and has annual revenue of about $600 million.</p>
<p>Trouble between Hachette and Mr. Diamandis began last
spring, when Hachette forced Mr. Diamandis to put Woman's Day
-- one of the largest-circulation magazines in the U.S. -- on
the auction block. Mr. Diamandis at first strongly opposed
the move, then finally agreed to it. By late July, Woman's
Day had not been sold, and Hachette had been forced to knock
down its price to under $175 million from more than $200
million. But possible buyers reportedly still think the price
is too high, and no sale has materialized.</p>
<p>Mr. Diamandis was also angered by Hachette's decision
earlier this month to close down Memories magazine, a
news-nostalgia magazine that he had helped create.</p>
<p>Late yesterday, Hachette moved quickly to take tighter
control of the company. Besides Mr. Filipacchi, who will take
personal control of the magazines unit, all editors will
report to Jean-Louis Ginibre, Hachette senior vice president
and editorial director. David J. Pecker, formerly vice
president and controller of DCI, was named chief operating
officer and chief financial officer of Hachette Magazines.</p>
<p>The abrupt departure of Mr. Diamandis now raises the
question of how Hachette will treat other top managers,
editors, and publishers at the company, many whom have close
professional and personal allegiances to Mr. Diamandis.</p>
<p>Mr. Diamandis won many friends by spreading the wealth to
employees through stock options and bonuses. At the time of
the leveraged buy-out, top executives were issued stock
options in DCI, which Mr. Diamandis intended to take public.
When Hachette purchased DCI, it purchased the options of the
executives. Mr. Diamandis made sure that lower rungs of
employees, even secretaries, received stock or at least
one-time payments.</p>
