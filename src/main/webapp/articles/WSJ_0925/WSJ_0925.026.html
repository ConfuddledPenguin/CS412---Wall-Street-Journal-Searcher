	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- NBC News may lay off about 25 employees, or
2.5% of its work force, according to a memo from NBC News
President Michael Gartner distributed to the division. No
timetable was set.
   Separately, anchor Jane Pauley signed a new five-year
contract with National Broadcasting Co., a unit of General
Electric Co., and Mr. Gartner said in the memo that her
summer series, "Real Life with Jane Pauley" would return as a
regularly scheduled weekly series. The program, which will
serve as a mid-season replacement for a failing NBC
entertainment series, is likely to return as a half-hour
program, as opposed to the one-hour length in its summer run.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Meanwhile, CBS News said it would begin a nightly
half-hour program at 11:30 p.m., beginning Monday, to be
anchored by correspondents Lesley Stahl and Charles Kuralt
that would compete with ABC News's "Nightline." Unlike
"Nightline," however, the CBS News broadcast, originating in
Washington and New York, will not be a single-topic show.</p>
<p>CBS faces stiff opposition from its 200-plus affiliates,
however. Only 80% of its affiliates broadcast the current
late-night offerings of such action adventure shows as
"Wiseguy." In comparison, NBC has a 99% clearance rate from
its affiliates for the "Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson."</p>
<p>Although details of Ms. Pauley's contract couldn't be
determined, individuals within the NBC network said her total
contract could be worth about $7 million.</p>
<p>In the memo, Mr. Gartner said some employees would be
reassigned to Ms. Pauley's show or an expanded investigative
journalism unit. "Nevertheless," Mr. Gartner wrote, "still
others whose skills don't match those needed for the new
shows or any other shows, perhaps as many as 25, may be laid
off." An NBC News spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p>NBC News, with an annual operating budget of about $250
million, has about 1,000 employees, the smallest number of
the major broadcast network news divisions. In comparison,
CBS News, a unit of CBS Inc., has about 1,370 employees and
ABC News, a division of Capital Cities/ABC Inc., has about
1,200 employees.</p>
