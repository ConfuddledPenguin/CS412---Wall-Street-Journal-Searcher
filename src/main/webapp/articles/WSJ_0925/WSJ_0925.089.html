	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- Societe Lyonnaise des Eaux, a water treatment
concern, and Dumez S.A., a building company, said
shareholders approved their plan, unveiled in July, to merge
and create a broad-based group capable of offering a full
range of services, essentially to local and national
governments, from water treatment to road building and
urbanism.
   Under the plan, Lyonnaise des Eaux will absorb Dumez
through a 4-for-3 share swap.</p>
