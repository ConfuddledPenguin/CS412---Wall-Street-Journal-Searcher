	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A major coalition of civil rights
organizations urged the Senate to reject the nomination of
Judge David Souter to the Supreme Court.
   The 180-member Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said
in a two-page statement that Judge Souter hadn't shown "that
he has a commitment to constitutional guarantees of
individual rights and liberties."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A number of women's rights groups and abortion rights
groups, all members of the Leadership Conference, previously
announced their opposition to Judge Souter.</p>
<p>The Leadership Conference is the most influential civil
rights lobby here, but its opposition isn't likely to signal
real trouble for the nomination. The civil rights coalition
isn't expected to mount the full-scale campaign that it did
in 1987 against the nomination of Robert Bork. The decision
to oppose Judge Souter wasn't made in time for the
confirmation hearings, and the statement in opposition went
virtually unnoticed when released Saturday.</p>
<p>Moreover, the opposition may be too late to have much
impact. Approval by the 14-member Senate Judiciary Committee,
scheduled to vote Thursday, is nearly ensured. Several
committee members, whose votes against Mr. Bork were crucial,
already have endorsed Judge Souter. These include Democrats
Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Howell Heflin of Alabama and
Republican Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The only senator who has announced opposition so far is
Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), who isn't a member of the
committee. The full Senate is expected to vote on the
nomination next week.</p>
