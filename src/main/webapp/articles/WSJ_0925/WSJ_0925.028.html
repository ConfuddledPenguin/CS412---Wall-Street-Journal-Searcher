	<div class="article-body"><p>Although Swiss voters in a weekend referendum narrowly
rejected a proposal that the country's five atomic power
plants be dismantled within the next 30 to 40 years, the
Socialist Party, which had backed the proposal, hailed the
vote as marking a "turning point" in the country's energy
policy.</p>
<p>According to the final official result, 52.9% voted
against the shutdown. The Socialists blamed the narrow
rejection of the shutdown proposal on an expensive publicity
campaign by the utility industry. The Socialists also noted
that 54.6% approved a related draft constitutional amendment
that bars construction or licensing of new reactors until the
year 2000.</p>
<p>The Swiss government, which had opposed both initiatives,
also voiced satisfaction at the results. It said the vote
proved that most Swiss felt the country can't renounce
nuclear power.</p>
<p>Environmental activists, noting that Switzerland is a net
exporter of electricity, say that increased energy efficiency
and alternative energies would permit a nuclear shutdown.</p>
<p>LATEST SHORTAGE IN CUBA: PAPER</p>
<p>Cuba, blaming shortages in Soviet supplies of newsprint
and paper pulp, said it was cutting back its national
state-run press by turning two dailies into weeklies and
suspending an armed-forces newspaper. The official newspaper
Granma, representing the views of the Communist Party, would
remain as the only national daily from Monday to Friday, with
a Saturday edition for Havana only.</p>
<p>MORE FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN CHINA</p>
<p>Foreign investment in China rose for the third consecutive
month in July after the decline experienced between January
and April, according to semi-official news reports. The China
News Service reported the country approved 632 new
foreign-investment projects in July with total contracts
valued at around $536 million. Actual investment during the
month totaled $284 million, according to the Ministry of
Foreign Economic Relations and Trade.</p>
<p>CAR SLUMP IN SPAIN</p>
<p>Spanish car sales are seen skidding 10% in 1990. In a
survey of car makers conducted by the magazine Economia,
industry leaders attributed the drop in sales to Spain's
strict credit restrictions, a stiff value-added tax and the
Gulf crisis. "The Persian Gulf crisis has provoked soaring
oil prices and concern that we're heading for a recession . .
. all of which implies a decline in consumption," one auto
official told Economia.</p>
<p>BRITAIN'S POLLUTION</p>
<p>The environmental group Greenpeace termed Britain "The
Dirty Man of Europe" and called for policy changes on air,
water and waste. Greenpeace said in a report that in the past
year Britain had made "some green gestures" but that the
nation was still the largest manufacturer of ozone-destroying
chlorofluorocarbons in Europe and faced more legal actions
from the European Community over water and air pollution than
any other country. The report was called "political
pollution" by Environment Secretary Chris Patten, who today
will present a policy document on the environment.</p>
<p>CHILE LIFTS `FIDDLER' BAN</p>
<p>Chile's government lifted a 16-year-old ban on the film
"Fiddler on the Roof," suppressed by the former military
regime of Gen. Augusto Pinochet for alleged Marxist content.
The current civilian government said it lifted the ban
"because the nation has started a time of real implementation
of the principles of democracy and freedom."</p>
<p>AUSTRALIA'S ASBESTOS PROBLEM</p>
<p>Health experts say Australia faces a rising tide of
asbestos-related deaths that will not peak until the first
decade of the next century. The nation already has the
world's highest rate of mesothelioma, a fatal cancer of the
lungs, heart and abdomen caused by inhaling asbestos fibers.</p>
<p>James Leigh of the Australian Mesothelioma Register says
1,900 people have been diagnosed as having mesothelioma in
the past 10 years, and the incidence of the disease is
growing rapidly. So far this year, 167 people have already
registered, compared with 214 in the whole of 1988 and 270 in
1989.</p>
<p>"It's been quite a big jump from 1988 to 1989 and the
curve of incidence doesn't predict a flattening off until the
year 2010," Dr. Leigh said.</p>
<p>"Over the years, millions of (Australians) in many
occupations have been exposed to the asbestos fibers" that
cause mesothelioma, said David Ferguson, one of the country's
leading experts on diseases caused by exposure to asbestos.
"Blue asbestos was used in an estimated 3,000 Australian
products."</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Beijing University gave International Olympic Committee
President Juan Antonio Samaranch an honorary professorship.
Mr. Samaranch is in Beijing with other committee members to
assess the city's suitability as a site for the Olympics in
the year 2000. . . . Also in Beijing, the grandson of Mao
Tse-tung is waiting on tables at the Asian Games athletes'
village, a Shanghai newspaper reported. Wang Xiaozhi, 18,
volunteered with classmates from Beijing Foreign Affairs and
Tourism Vocational School, the newspaper said, noting: "Every
time . . . he finishes work, he wipes the tables and windows
of the dining hall. He gains praise from his classmates and
the athletes."</p>
