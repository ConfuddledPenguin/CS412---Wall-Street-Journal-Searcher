	<p class="article-leader">The rail industry is lobbying furiously to scrap a
little-noted paragraph in both Democratic and Republican
budget proposals that would cost railroads and their
employees at least $400 million over the next five years.
   Almost lost in the politics of the budget negotiations is
the proposal, which would substantially boost the taxes paid
to fund retirement benefits for rail workers. The Bush
administration has proposed the higher payments to help
reduce what it estimates to be a $34 billion unfunded
liability.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Supporters of the budget proposal want the rail industry
to step up rail retirement contributions to reduce the risk
that the federal government would eventually have to bail out
the fund. But railroads say the higher taxes aren't needed
because the retirement fund is financially healthy.</p>
<p>The "fund doesn't need the money," said Richard Briggs,
executive vice president of the Association of American
Railroads, a trade group. But budget negotiators are "trying
to raise the tax as a gimmick to reduce the deficit."</p>
<p>Drew Lewis, former Transportation secretary who is
chairman of Union Pacific Corp., has fired off letters to a
half dozen congressional and administration budget
negotiators calling the tax unfair and unnecessary. Mr. Lewis
was co-chairman of a blue-ribbon commission created by
Congress in 1988 to find ways to cut the federal budget
deficit. Smaller railroads say they would be hit particularly
hard. David Hughes, president of Bangor & Aroostook Railroad
in Bangor, Maine, said he would have to cut capital spending
10% to pay the higher taxes.</p>
<p>Rail labor is also lobbying against the higher taxes,
which will "make it that much more difficult for us to get
any wage and cost-of-living increases out of the railroads,"
said Fred Hardin, president of the United Transportation
Union.</p>
<p>The Commission on Railroad Retirement Reform, created in
1987 to review the fund's financial health, said in a report
issued Friday that the fund is financially sound in the
intermediate term and isn't likely to experience cash-flow
difficulties in the next 20-25 years. However, the commission
suggested that Congress consider transferring new railroad
employees to Social Security and setting up private pension
funds for them.</p>
<p>Railroad workers aren't protected by Social Security but
are covered by the railroad retirement fund. The federally
administered system provides railroad retirees with one layer
of benefits equivalent to Social Security payments and a
second layer that more closely resembles a private pension
plan. Last year the railroad industry and its employees
contributed $2.3 billion to fund the second layer of benefits
for some 980,000 beneficiaries.</p>
<p>The federal Office of Management and Budget is trying to
raise those taxes that fund the second layer of benefits. OMB
officials declined to comment.</p>
<p>Controversy isn't anything new to the fund. Last month
auditors for the Railroad Retirement Board's inspector
general found under-reporting of payroll taxes by some
railroad companies. Critics long have said the fund faces
potential problems as the number of railroad workers dwindles
and leaves fewer workers to pay the benefits of retirees. The
retirement fund currently covers more than 300,000 active
employees.</p>
<p>In February, President Bush proposed several changes that
the OMB said would save $42,850,000 in fiscal 1991. These
included altering the cost-of-living adjustment formula,
freezing cost-of-living adjustments on rail pensions for one
year and limiting railroad retirement benefits available to
married couples who both worked for railroads.</p>
