	<p class="article-leader">MEDTRONIC Inc. (Minneapolis) -- Jack W. Schuler, former
president and chief operating officer of Abbott Laboratories,
was elected a director of this biomedical device maker. Mr.
Schuler was forced to resign last year from Abbott, citing
"differences in philosophy" with Abbott's then-chairman and
chief executive officer, Robert A. Schoellhorn. His
resignation set off shock waves in Abbott's executive suite
that earlier this year resulted in the ouster of Mr.
Schoellhorn by the drug maker's board. With the addition,
Medtronic has 12 directors.</p>
