	<p class="article-leader">Jerry Weintraub joined the exodus of employees from
Weintraub Entertainment Group, which earlier this month
sought bankruptcy-law protection from creditors.
   Mr. Weintraub, the 52-year-old founder and majority
shareholder of the ailing entertainment concern, resigned as
chairman and chief executive officer. It wasn't clear what
his future involvement with the private Los Angeles company
would be.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Concurrent with Mr. Weintraub's resignation, Warner
Brothers said he will produce movies for the Burbank, Calif.,
film studio under a "major long-term agreement." A spokesman
for the Time Warner Inc. unit said details of the agreement
weren't available.</p>
<p>Mr. Weintraub's assistant at Weintraub Entertainment
directed questions about his successor to Kenneth Kleinberg,
president and chief operating officer. Mr. Kleinberg didn't
return telephone calls.</p>
