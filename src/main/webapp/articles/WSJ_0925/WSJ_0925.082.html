	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Pessimism about the economic outlook and a
sharp jump in oil prices sent stock prices to their lowest
levels in 14 months.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 59.41, or 2.36%, to
2452.97, the fourth consecutive slide and the lowest level
since July 3, 1989.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Crude oil for November delivery closed $2.82 higher at
$38.25 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange
yesterday, following new threats of aggression from Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Trading wasn't especially heavy on the New York Stock
Exchange, where 162,210,000 shares changed hands. But the
damage to individual stocks was steep. Only 233 stocks
advanced on the Big Board, while 1,423 declined.</p>
<p>Money managers and traders alike stared grimly at the
indiscriminate selling of some of the year's favorite shares.
So-called recession-proof sectors, such as pollution control,
food and beverages, slid easily into losses as buyers
remained cautious and reluctant. Traders said some money
managers are simply getting out of stocks, not trying to hide
in the "safe" groups any more.</p>
<p>Waste Management, a favorite this year, was down more than
a point during the session, but late bargain-hunting pared
the issue's loss to 3/4, to 32 3/4. Boeing, another popular
issue, tumbled 2 7/8 to 40 3/8, despite news that a division
of Lufthansa had placed a large order for jets; the stock was
also downgraded by analysts at Lehman Brothers and First
Boston, according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.</p>
<p>Cyclical stocks also took a drubbing. It was an especially
bad day for several metals issues. Copper producer Phelps
Dodge tumbled 4 5/8 to 53 3/4; Reynolds Metals fell 3 7/8 to
63 1/2. Aluminum Co. of America fell 3 3/4 to 63 3/4. Stories
in yesterday's Wall Street Journal and this week's Barron's
magazine note that aluminum prices could drop swiftly if the
world economy continues to weaken. Also, Lehman Brothers and
PaineWebber downgraded the industry group, while aluminum
prices fell on commodity exchanges.</p>
<p>"There are no places to hide in a bear market," said
Ronald Sloan, executive vice president at Siebel Capital
Management Inc. "The only way to preserve capital is not to
own stocks."</p>
<p>The widespread selling pushed broader averages to the
lowest levels in 17 months. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index
fell 6.73, or 2.16% to 304.59, the lowest close since April
17, 1989; the New York Stock Exchange composite index fell
3.52, or 2.06%, to 167.51, the lowest close since April 13,
1989.</p>
<p>Computer-guided sell programs played only a marginal role
in the market's decline. The Big Board's "uptick rule," which
hinders many forms of program trading, kicked into effect
when the Dow industrials were down more than 50 points
shortly before 11 a.m. EDT.</p>
<p>American Express dropped 2 to 20 3/4 on trading of
slightly more than one million shares. This newspaper
reported yesterday on an effort by American Express to smear
rival banker Edmond Safra.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan topped the most-active list, with a 1
5/8-point loss to 11 1/8 on volume of more than five million
shares. On Friday, Chase announced plans to take hefty
third-quarter charges for a restructuring and possible loan
losses and cut its dividend by more than half.</p>
<p>Among other bank stocks following Chase lower, Citicorp
dropped 1/2 to 15 1/4 on volume of 2.4 million shares and
Chemical Banking fell 1 7/8 to 15 1/8. Bankers Trust slid 2
to 32 1/4, Continental Bank lost 5/8 to 8 1/4, Mellon Bank
lost 7/8 to 18 7/8 and Wells Fargo eased 1 3/8 to 49 7/8.</p>
<p>UAL fell 8 1/2 to 92 1/4. The United Airlines Pilots
Association asked its members to express their support for
the union-led buy-out effort, in order to counter opposition
by UAL's chairman, Stephen M. Wolf. In a letter to its
members, the union claims that Mr. Wolf has advised the UAL
board that the buy-out isn't supported by rank-and-file union
members.</p>
<p>The union also indicated that if the buy-out effort fails,
it is prepared to return to the "traditional labor-contract
negotiating table" with the possibility of a strike if its
demands aren't met by top management.</p>
<p>Computer Associates went down 1/2 to 4 7/8 following a
critical article on the company's founders in Sunday's
edition of the New York Times.</p>
<p>Corroon & Black added 1/4 to 29 1/2 after declaring a
$2.50-a-share special dividend. The dividend will be payable
15 days after the completion of the company's stock-swap
merger with Willis Faber. On Friday, Aon Corp. withdrew a
$40-a-share offer for Corroon & Black at Corroon & Black's
request.</p>
<p>American Brands fell 1 3/4 to 66 1/4. A Mississippi jury
is expected to decide shortly whether an American Brands unit
bears any responsibility for the lung-cancer death of a
Lexington, Miss., man in a closely watched case. While most
analysts expect the jury to rule in favor of the company,
product-liability suits have caused short-term volatility in
tobacco stocks in the past.</p>
<p>Marriott dropped 1 1/2 to 10 7/8, its lowest level in at
least eight years. Lehman Brothers and Wertheim Schroder made
cautious comments on the company yesterday, noting that the
hotel chain holds a sizable real estate portfolio that it
would like to sell. Last Tuesday, Prime Motor Inns filed for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Code, largely as a result of slumping real estate prices.
Prime Motor closed unchanged at 11/16.</p>
<p>Yesterday's short list of winners was crowded with gold
stocks. Hecla Mining gained 5/8 to 10 3/4; Homestake Mining
rose 1 1/4 to 21 5/8; ASA Ltd. jumped 2 5/8 to 50 1/2; Placer
Dome went up 1 to 18 1/2; Newmont Gold rose 3 1/8 to 46 1/2;
Coeur d'Alene Mines gained 1 to 28 1/2, and Newmont Mining
added 2 1/8 to 44 1/8.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 3.17
to 312.84. Volume totaled 14,050,000 shares.</p>
