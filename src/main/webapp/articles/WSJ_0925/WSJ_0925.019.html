	<p class="article-leader">Rowland Worldwide (New York) -- Mitchell Kozikowski,
president and chief executive officer of the public-relations
company's U.S. operations, resigned, citing "philosophical
business differences" over the growth of the company in the
U.S. Herbert Rowland, chief executive of Rowland Worldwide,
said the parting was amicable. The company will form an
office of the president, consisting of the company's four
executive vice presidents, to manage the New York office.
Rowland, with offices in five continents, said it has annual
billings of more than $50 million.</p>
