	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration is preparing to
furlough thousands of federal workers -- from air traffic
controllers to White House spokesmen -- beginning next week
unless budget negotiators reach a last-minute accord.
   The five congressional and three administration
negotiators met again last night. Before the meeting,
Democratic leaders suggested there might be an accord, at
least in principle, by midweek. Administration officials,
however, emphasized that substantial differences remain,
though they acknowledged that negotiators are making
progress.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In what amounts to a high-stakes game of chicken, the
White House yesterday renewed its vow to veto any
congressional attempt to delay the automatic spending cuts
slated to begin Monday, the first day of the new fiscal year.</p>
<p>If President Bush doesn't flinch, the impact will be
immediate -- and not just on the paychecks of federal
employees who will be told to stay home a day or two each
week. "It's seven days to Armageddon," Rep. Steve Gunderson
(R., Wis.) warned on the House floor.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration, for instance, says
that its plan to furlough controllers 2 1/2 days in the first
two weeks of October will force the cancellation of 3,000
domestic flights a day. The FAA had been saying that the
cancellations would begin Monday, but after meeting with
airline industry representatives yesterday, the agency said
it is postponing the cancellations until 3 a.m. next
Thursday. Flights will be delayed as necessary Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday of next week.</p>
<p>Takeoffs and landings at 40 airports will be restricted,
the agency says. At Chicago's O'Hare Airport, the busiest
airport in the nation, no more than 70 landings an hour will
be allowed. But at the peak hour from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m., 98
arrivals are scheduled -- so the FAA says 28 flights must be
canceled. Airlines are to notify the FAA by noon Friday what
flights are to be canceled.</p>
<p>In many other agencies, the initial impact of spending
cuts won't be as drastic. Although plans won't be final until
later this week, the Social Security Administration is now
planning to work six-hour days instead of its usual
eight-hour days Monday through Thursday and close all of its
offices across the country for the day on Oct. 5, according
to Kevin Moley, assistant secretary of health and human
services for management and budget. But Social Security still
expects to be able to deliver benefit checks on time;
benefits themselves are exempt from the spending cuts.</p>
<p>And in some corners of the bureaucracy, the cuts will have
little instant impact. At the main offices of the Treasury,
typical of many agencies, furloughs won't be ordered next
week. A spokeswoman said employees will have to take off two
days without pay during the two weeks beginning Oct. 8 --
assuming nothing has changed by then.</p>
<p>Unless the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law is altered,
the government must reduce spending by an estimated $85.4
billion in fiscal 1991 to meet the law's $64 billion deficit
target. With about three-quarters of all federal spending
exempt from the cuts -- including military personnel -- the
remainder will be hit hard. The White House budget office
says spending by affected agencies must be slashed by 32.4%,
six times the cuts imposed last year when Congress missed the
budget deadline. "Every other year, this exercise has been at
the margins. This year it is meat and potatoes," said Mr.
Moley of HHS.</p>
<p>The spending cuts are so deep that Congress and the
president are certain to prevent them from lasting all year.
But administration officials insist they will let them take
effect next week to increase the pressure on Congress to
reach an agreement. "We think those are an important
discipline," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
yesterday.</p>
<p>Congress is contemplating incorporating a provision that
would delay the Gramm-Rudman cuts until Oct. 13 or Oct. 20
into an emergency temporary spending measure that must pass
by Oct. 1 to keep the government running. Republicans are
mobilizing to defeat that bill. And Mr. Fitzwater reiterated
previous warnings that such a measure would be vetoed if it
waives the Gramm-Rudman spending cuts. But he added: "We'll
wait and see what the situation is when we get there."</p>
<p>Congressional and administration officials expect that the
spending cuts would be waived, or at least delayed, if
negotiators reach an agreement soon -- even though the
agreement won't be enacted into law for weeks.</p>
<p>Federal agencies have been issuing furlough notices for
weeks and drafting contingency plans, but in many corners of
the bureaucracy, managers confess uncertainty about how the
cuts actually will be executed.</p>
<p>Some agencies can absorb the spending cuts for the first
few weeks without furloughs -- by deferring purchases,
delaying travel and leaving vacancies unfilled. But the White
House budget office has limited agencies' flexibility and
issued stern warnings about the criminal penalties that
managers face if they expend unappropriated funds.</p>
<p>Under the Gramm-Rudman rules, small agencies that spend
nearly their entire budgets on personnel are hit particularly
hard. The office of the U.S. commissioner to the Delaware
River Basin Commission must cut $67,000 from its $206,000
allocation for salaries and expenses. Since the commissioner
is exempt, the only other employee, staff assistant Barbara
Cranford, has been instructed to take off 255 days of the
260-day federal work year. She is planning to work five days
next week and stay home after that.</p>
<p>"You're sort of numb," said Mrs. Cranford, who has worked
for the federal government for 35 years, 22 of them at the
commission. "You sort of hope that Congress wakes up. They
expect civil servants to be responsible, and we hope Congress
will be responsible."</p>
