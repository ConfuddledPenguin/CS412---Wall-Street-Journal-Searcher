	<p class="article-leader">Scottish & Newcastle Breweries PLC of Edinburgh, Scotland,
a brewing and leisure concern, said it raised its stake in
the Dutch leisure concern Center Parcs N.V. to 80% of the
ordinary shares outstanding.
   The two companies said last week that they were in talks
that could lead to Scottish & Newcastle's buying all the
Center Parcs shares that it didn't already own.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The purchases last Friday involved 747,146, or 5.2%, of
Center Parcs's ordinary shares, and 39.1% of its 5.75%
sterling convertible subordinated bonds and 4.2% of its 3.75%
guilder convertible subordinated bonds. Scottish & Newcastle
said its holding of all classes of Center Parcs securities
now stands at 70%, up from 60.3%. The price paid for the
additional stake wasn't disclosed. Last Thursday, the
companies said Scottish & Newcastle would pay about #180
million ($332.3 million) to acquire the balance of Center
Parcs.</p>
<p>Though the initial terms of Scottish & Newcastle's
friendly stake last year included a three-year standstill
pact, Center Parcs said last week that it would benefit from
being a Scottish & Newcastle unit.</p>
