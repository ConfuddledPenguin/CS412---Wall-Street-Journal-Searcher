	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush again drew a clear line
against any negotiations to end the showdown over Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait.
   In an occasionally contentious session with
representatives of Arab-American groups, Mr. Bush was pressed
to negotiate with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein as he has with
other world leaders. At one point, Mr. Bush retorted: "No
negotiations -- withdrawal totally from Kuwait."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bush said that discussions with Iraq's leaders might
be possible once Iraq fully complies with United Nations
Security Council resolutions demanding unconditional Iraqi
withdrawal. But he reasserted that the U.S. won't "yield one
inch" on its demand for an unconditional withdrawal.</p>
<p>The president, also pressed about depriving Iraqi children
of food through the U.N. trade embargo on Iraq, declared more
openly than in previous statements that he is willing to let
shipments of food reach Iraq if international relief
organizations supervise their distribution. "We want to get
the food to those that need it," Mr. Bush said, but the U.S.
is "much less interested in feeding Saddam Hussein's army at
this point."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in an important indication that one key link in
the trade sanctions may be holding, Iran announced that it
had arrested 29 people for trying to smuggle food into Iraq.
Iran's official news agency said that two groups of smugglers
were handed over Sunday to a court in the Kurdish city of
Sanandaj, 50 miles from the Iraqi border, and that officials
seized rice, flour, sugar, vegetable oil, dates, raisins,
powdered milk and tomato sauce.</p>
<p>U.S. officials, while maintaining that they expected Iran
to honor the sanctions, have been looking for such tangible
evidence that the country would spurn overtures from Iraq
that it help to circumvent trade sanctions.</p>
<p>The Iranian announcement came as Syrian President Hafez
Assad, who is sending thousands of troops to Saudi Arabia to
deter further Iraqi moves, extended a visit with Iran for
talks apparently aimed at solidifying Iranian cooperation
with the sanctions.</p>
<p>Mr. Assad, who met U.S. Secretary of State James Baker
earlier this month in Damascus to coordinate actions against
Iraq, held his third meeting in three days with Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani yesterday. He had been scheduled
to leave after that, but Iran's official news agency said he
is remaining for more talks.</p>
<p>President Bush's remarks ruling out negotiations with Iraq
matched in tone Baghdad's unyielding declarations made Sunday
asserting that the seizure of Kuwait is permanent and
threatening a widespread Middle East war if Iraq is
economically "strangled." Moreover, the Iraqi news agency
quoted Saddam Hussein yesterday as saying that he would fight
"for 1,000 years" to keep Kuwait.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush's appearance before Arab-Americans was scheduled
in part so the president could condemn prejudice and acts of
hatred aimed at Arab-Americans. But while the audience
enthusiastically applauded those remarks, some seemed to
question his unbending stance toward Iraq, and Mr. Bush
responded firmly and at times testily.</p>
<p>When one questioner voiced concern that the U.S. was
pledging to restore an unelected monarchy in Kuwait rather
than bring democracy to that state, Mr. Bush retorted: "The
objective is to see that naked aggression does not pay off,
sir . . . Iraq is no model of democracy, nor was Kuwait. That
isn't the question here -- the question is international law
and respect for one's neighbors." Many in the audience
applauded, indicating support for Mr. Bush's stand.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush complained bitterly that Saddam Hussein isn't
allowing humanitarian food shipments to Iraq to be
distributed by international relief workers. He asserted that
Iraq's stance, rather than the international sanctions, is
keeping food from thousands of Asian refugees trying to flee
Iraq and Kuwait.</p>
<p>Separately, the Bush administration continued trying to
persuade Congress to approve the president's request to
forgive almost $7 billion in Egyptian military debts to
reward Egypt for its stand opposing Iraq's occupation of
Kuwait. The request faces opposition. Some lawmakers are
considering inserting in a short-term spending bill a waiver
of an Egyptian debt payment due Oct. 2.</p>
