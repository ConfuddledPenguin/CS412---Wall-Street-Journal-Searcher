	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A Pittsburgh laboratory barred from
submitting test data for new generic-drug products to the
Food and Drug Administration may now submit data for certain
tests, according to the agency.
   Biodecision Laboratories, a unit of Biodecision Inc., may
submit drug studies completed since Jan. 11, 1990, an FDA
spokesman said. But he added that studies done before that
date will require an audit by an independent scientific
accounting firm before the FDA will grant approval.
Biodecision currently has about 20 applications pending at
the agency.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The FDA suspended all drug approvals involving data from
Biodecision in July, after it found that the lab had
performed faulty tests on 11 generic-drug products prior to
their approval. The tests had been submitted to the FDA as
part of the drug-approval process. Since the company was
founded in 1971, the laboratory has done testing for
virtually every major generic-drug firm.</p>
