	<p class="article-leader">News Corp. disclosed details of a planned restructuring of
its share capital, aimed at fueling its expansion while
keeping the company firmly under the control of its chief
executive officer, Rupert Murdoch.
   Directors are asking shareholders to approve a proposal to
alter the Sydney, Australia, company's authorized share
capital to create a three-tiered structure. That structure
would be composed of common stock, preferred limited-voting
ordinary shares, and nonvoting ordinary shares. Currently,
the company has only full-voting ordinary shares on issue and
preference shares, issued through subsidiaries, that are
redeemable, nonvoting and basically debt instruments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>News Corp.'s directors said they don't want to issue more
ordinary shares because it "might have the effect of
diluting" the Murdoch family's 45% controlling interest.</p>
<p>If shareholders approve the plan at the company's annual
meeting next month -- a prospect made more likely because Mr.
Murdoch's family can vote its stake -- News Corp. directors
said they will make a free scrip issue to existing
shareholders.</p>
