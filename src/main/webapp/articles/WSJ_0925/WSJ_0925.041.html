	<p class="article-leader">Public Service Co. of New Mexico, abandoning attempts to
sell itself, unveiled a business plan that embraces much of
the controversial strategy associated with its former
chairman.
   The beleaguered utility, based in Albuquerque, also said
it ended talks with a group of investors led by Wheeler Peak
Capital Corp. after the two sides failed to reach a
compromise on a confidentiality agreement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under its new strategic plan, PS New Mexico will pursue
previously untapped markets, use recently approved economic
development rates to market its excess capacity and attempt
to sell all or portions of certain excess power generation
facilities. The company also said its board authorized it to
find more opportunities for selling power outside its service
area.</p>
<p>"The board is willing to authorize additional expenditures
to increase capacity to reach markets in the west,
particularly California," John Ackerman, president and chief
executive officer of PS New Mexico, said in an interview.</p>
<p>Like many utilities in the Southwest, PS New Mexico
aggressively overbuilt its capacity in anticipation of the
widely expected Sunbelt boom that never happened. That excess
capacity and an ill-fated diversification effort pushed the
utility to the brink of financial disaster, forcing it to
suspend common dividends, cut its staff by 20% and sell off
non-utility assets. Last spring, it hired Morgan Stanley &
Co. to help it decide by summer's end what to do to pull
itself out of its financial morass.</p>
<p>"Management and Morgan Stanley have conducted a very
thorough analysis of alternatives," Mr. Ackerman said in a
statement. "We believe that the strategic plan presents the
best option available to the company."</p>
<p>The plan also harkens back to strategies laid out by Jerry
D. Geist who resigned as chairman and president of PS New
Mexico in June, saying he was too closely associated with the
problems that led to the utility's woes. Mr. Geist, architect
of PS New Mexico's diversification efforts, also had
championed marketing power throughout the Southwest.</p>
<p>The same obstacles the utility faced in selling itself
outright may impede efforts to sell its energy, analysts
said. Foremost among those is the scarceness of buyers,
generally Southwest utility companies, who aren't already
themselves grappling with excess capacity problems.</p>
<p>In July, Wheeler Peak, an Albuquerque venture-capital
company run by a former PS New Mexico executive, floated the
idea of acquiring the utility for $12 a share and equity in
the continuing company. Its partners in the transaction
included Southwestern Public Service Co., a Southern Union
Co. affiliate, and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., a unit
of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.</p>
<p>PS New Mexico closed yesterday at $9.875, down 37.5 cents,
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
