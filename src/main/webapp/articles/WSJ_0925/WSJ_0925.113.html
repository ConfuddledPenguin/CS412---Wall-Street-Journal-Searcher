	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- After just a few days of negotiations, Chile
and its commercial bankers tentatively agreed to a proposed
$1.8 billion debt rescheduling, and the nation said it soon
will issue $320 million of bonds with the help of some of its
major bank creditors.
   Chile, which in recent years has had the strongest
economic growth in Latin America, hasn't borrowed in
international credit markets in recent years but is trying to
return to those markets now after several years of reform and
strong export-led growth.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Because of its good economic performance, the nation has
been lauded by many foreign bankers and economists. "We've
been listening to the financial markets saying that Chile
belongs to a different category" than other heavily indebted
developing nations, said the nation's finance minister,
Alejandro Foxley.</p>
<p>The proposed rescheduling agreement was reached between
Chile and a representative committee of banks. The agreement,
which still has to be ratified by the nation's bank creditors
around the world, would extend $1.8 billion of debt principal
payments for four years and continue an arrangement under
which Chile pays interest once a year instead of twice a
year. The $320 million Chile expects to raise would help the
nation meet its financing needs over the next three years,
Mr. Foxley said.</p>
