	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- With just one more month left to be recorded
in the federal fiscal year, the deficit amounted to $241.72
billion, the Treasury said.
   The deficit target for fiscal 1990, which ends Sunday, set
by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law was $100 billion.
In the first 11 months of last year, the deficit totaled
$145.81 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The deficit for the month of August was $52.75 billion,
more than double the $22.15 billion reported in August last
year. Spending in August was increased by about $25 billion
because wage and benefit payments normally made in September
were made early to avoid Labor Day weekend delays, the
Treasury said. As a result, the government may run a modest
surplus in September.</p>
<p>Revenues in August were $78.49 billion, up 3.1% from
$76.14 billion last August. Outlays were $131.24 billion, up
33.5% from $98.29 billion.</p>
<p>So far this year, federal receipts totaled $928.59
billion, up 4.2% from last year. Individual income taxes are
4.8% ahead of last year, and Social Security payroll taxes
are 7.2% ahead of last year. But corporate tax receipts are
running 9.2% behind last year's totals, primarily because
profits are down.</p>
<p>Outlays totaled $1.17 billion in the first 11 months, up
12.8% from last year. The Treasury said the Resolution Trust
Corp., the primary arm of the thrift industry clean-up
operation, has spent $37.78 billion so far this year.</p>
