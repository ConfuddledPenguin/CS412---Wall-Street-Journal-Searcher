	<p class="article-leader">Helene Curtis Industries Inc., citing costs of product
introductions, particularly the slower-than-expected
launching of its Finesse line in West Germany, said earnings
from continuing operations dropped 47% to $3.5 million, or 38
cents a share, in the second quarter ended Aug. 31.
   Net income fell to $2.1 million, or 23 cents a share, from
$6.6 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the quarter, the personal-care products company took a
charge of 15 cents a share arising from the sale of its
beauty-supply distribution business. It said that business
accounted for $45 million in sales and a loss of $600,000, or
seven cents a share, in the lastest fiscal year. The
company's sales and earnings were adjusted to reflect the
sale.</p>
<p>Net sales from continuing operations jumped 22% to $228.8
million. The company, based in Chicago, said its consumer
business remains strong, led by such product launches as the
introduction of Degree anti-perspirant in the U.S. and the
Salon Selectives brand in Japan.</p>
