	<p class="article-leader">CALABASAS, Calif. -- Lockheed Corp., saying it wants to
"address concerns expressed by some of our shareholders,"
softened its poison-pill plan to allow for a specific type of
"qualifying offer" that wouldn't be subject to any of the
plan's anti-takeover measures.
   But at the same time, the defense contractor's board
spurned proposals from financier Harold Simmons to amend or
redeem the pill in a way that would permit one of his
companies, NL Industries Inc., to buy 10 million additional
shares of Lockheed common stock from the employee stock
ownership plan or on the open market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Either of Mr. Simmons's proposals, Lockheed noted, would
effectively lay 35% of the company's stock in the hands of
the Dallas investor, who led an unsuccessful proxy battle for
control of Lockheed earlier this year. Mr. Simmons, through
Houston-based NL, holds a 19.8% stake in Lockheed.</p>
<p>Under previous terms of the poison pill, known officially
as a shareholder rights plan, provisions diluting a suitor's
stake would be triggered as soon as his investment rose above
20%. Now, under the so-called "chewable pill" that Lockheed
adopted yesterday, the company would suspend those provisions
as long as:</p>
<p>-- The bid for the company is a fully financed, all-cash
offer for all shares outstanding.</p>
<p>-- Owners of a majority of the shares outstanding
(excluding the offerer's) accept the bid.</p>
<p>-- The offerer provides and updates "a written fairness
opinion" from a nationally recognized investment banking
firm.</p>
<p>-- The offerer commits to a second-step transaction
providing equal treatment of all shareholders on the same
terms and price.</p>
<p>-- The offer remains open for at least 60 business days.</p>
<p>The California Public Employees' Retirement System, a
major institutional holder that has encouraged Lockheed to
amend its poision pill, said yesterday that it was encouraged
by the new action. "It looks like they're addressing some
issues that we had raised," said DeWitt Bowman, chief
investment officer for the fund.</p>
<p>But NL was hardly mollified by the board's move. Instead,
J. Landis Martin, NL's chief executive officer, attacked the
decision about the 10 million shares as confirming "to me
that (management) is afraid to death of losing the ESOP
vote." He declined further comment.</p>
<p>NL has sued Lockheed in federal court in Los Angeles,
claiming that the employee stock ownership plan, while it's
supposed to be administered by an outside trustee, is really
executing "a creeping, management-led, employee buy-out of
the company." Lockheed counters that the employee stock
ownership plan is run independently and provides
"motivational incentives to a broad base" of employees and
takes advantage of "significant tax and economic benefits."</p>
<p>In a letter to NL dated yesterday, Lockheed Chairman
Daniel Tellep stated that the board had extensively reviewed
NL's proposals concerning the 10 million shares, but rejected
them unanimously "as contrary to the best interests of
Lockheed and its shareholders." He went on to describe the NL
proposal, which offered to buy shares from the employee stock
ownership plan at $35 each, as "nothing more than an attempt
to acquire control of Lockheed without offering a fair price
to all shareholders."</p>
<p>"The NL proposal provides no significant economic benefit
to the ESOP or other Lockheed shareholders and could be
economically detrimental to Lockheed," Mr. Tellep said.
"Since last spring's annual meeting, we have met several
times with Mr. Simmons to brief him on our performance and
plans. Clearly, Mr. Simmons recognizes the underlying value
of Lockheed stock, and he is attempting to take advantage of
the current industry and market environment, contrary to the
best interests of other Lockheed shareholders."</p>
