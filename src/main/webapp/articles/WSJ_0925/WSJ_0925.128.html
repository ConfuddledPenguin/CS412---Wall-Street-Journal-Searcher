	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Jurors in a closely watched tobacco-liability
case found in favor of the plaintiff but didn't award any
damages.
   The decision, reached in Oxford, Miss., appeared to signal
a victory for American Brands Inc. The case was widely
predicted by tobacco experts to be favorable for the
plaintiff. However, as of late last night, people familiar
with the trial said that Judge Eugene Bogen hadn't dismissed
the jury, indicating that the 9-3 verdict in favor of the
plaintiff wasn't final.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nathan H. Horton, a housing contractor, died of lung
cancer in 1987. His family charged American Tobacco with
"marketing a defective and unreasonably dangerous product."</p>
<p>American Tobacco, a unit of American Brands, has denied
any responsibility for Mr. Horton's death, but the case
raised hopes among anti-smoking forces. Mississippi state law
is more favorable to plaintiffs than most other states. Under
its so-called comparative-negligence law, the jury could have
awarded damages to the Horton family even if it had found the
tobacco company bore only 1% of the responsibility for Mr.
Horton's death.</p>
<p>"What jurors are saying is that they didn't like what
tobacco companies did but they don't think smokers deserve to
be paid for what they did," said Victor Schwartz, a
tobacco-liability expert at the firm of Crowell & Moring, of
Washington, D.C. "There is no psychological negative in this
for the industry -- the only negative is when they have to
pay." Mr. Schwartz added that "if ever the plaintiffs were
going to win it was this one" because the liberal Mississippi
law was favorable to plaintiffs.</p>
<p>But Edward Popper, associate professor of marketing at
Bryant College, Smithfield, R.I., and a plaintiff's witness,
said, "For the jury to have found for the plaintiff, they had
to determine the product was unreasonably unsafe and that to
some extent Mr. Horton was unaware of that."</p>
<p>American Brands, which has been under a gag order, said it
couldn't comment on the outcome of the case. The plaintiff's
attorneys couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
