	<p class="article-leader">Rodamco N.V., a $4.5 billion international property
investment fund based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands,
suspended its longstanding policy of redeeming shares in the
face of a massive outflow of funds.
   The move stunned investors, and several Dutch analysts
predicted that Rodamco's share price will fall at least 10%
to 20% as a result. Because Rodamco will no longer buy its
own shares at approximately book value, investors wanting out
will have to sell them at the prevailing stock market price.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some analysts said the sudden policy change will hurt the
image of the entire Robeco Group, of which Rodamco is one of
the largest funds. Robeco Group, the biggest independent fund
manager in Europe with the equivalent of nearly $24 billion
under management, has shown lackluster investment results
over the past several years. Meanwhile, executive turnover
has been high at the group amid a reorganization orchestrated
by management consultants McKinsey & Co.</p>
<p>Rodamco shares were suspended from trading on the
Amsterdam Stock Exchange yesterday and today to give
investors time to digest the news. Andre Mulder, an analyst
at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Nederland, said Rodamco shares
might fall to between 60 guilders and 65 guilders when
trading resumes Wednesday. Rodamco closed Friday at 73.30
guilders.</p>
<p>Rodamco has "destroyed its image of being a very stable
property fund," Mr. Mulder said. "They will have extreme
difficulty getting investors' confidence back."</p>
<p>Rodamco officials insisted they had no choice. The fund
has repurchased more than 20% of its shares over the past
nine months at a total cost of about 2.3 billion guilders
($1.29 billion). Investors have been bailing out to take
advantage of higher yields on money market investments, and
many are worried about Rodamco's heavy exposure to the weak
British and U.S. real estate markets, which account for about
70% of the fund's assets.</p>
<p>The heavy repurchases have cut deeply into Rodamco's cash.
Had the trend continued, the fund said, it would have been
forced either to borrow heavily or sell "a potentially large
number of property investments in difficult markets."</p>
<p>A Robeco spokesman acknowledged yesterday that the company
could end redemptions at any time for its other main
offerings, the Robeco and Rolinco equity funds and the
Rorento bond fund. But he said such a move was "very
unlikely" given that those funds trade in marketable
securities, which can easily be cashed in on short notice,
unlike real estate.</p>
<p>Through August, Rodamco produced total returns on an
annual basis of 5.25% over the past two years and 8.31% over
five years, according to Theodoor Gilissen Investment
Research of Amsterdam.</p>
<p>For Robeco, an international equity fund, the returns were
1.88% over two years, putting it near the bottom among 14
Dutch-based international equity funds tracked by Gilissen.</p>
