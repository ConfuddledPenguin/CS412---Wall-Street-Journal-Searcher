	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks swooned to their lowest level
since February 1988 as a surge in oil prices intensified
investors' fears of a recession.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index plunged 10.09 to 352.16, a 2.8%
drop, as volume eased to 114.8 million shares from 124.2
million Friday. Declining stocks buried advancers, 1,702 to
446, while 444 stocks fell to new lows and only 14 reached
new highs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The pessimism is pretty strong," said Richard Holden,
manager of the OTC department at Alex. Brown & Sons,
Baltimore. Investors sold stocks as prices for crude oil
futures reached a new high, traders said. Adding to
investors' gloom is the lack of progress in resolving the
nation's budget deficit or the conflict in the Mideast. "It
all adds up to a pretty ugly picture," Mr. Holden said,
adding that he doesn't see any indications the market will
stage a major rally.</p>
<p>It may be the fourth quarter before OTC stocks fall to
their lows for the year, said Merrill Lynch technical analyst
George Constantine. "There's been a tremendous amount of
damage done" to OTC stocks, he said in an interview. A large
number of smaller stocks are lower now than they were in the
fourth quarter of 1987 after the market collapse, he noted.
By the end of August this year, 55% of the stocks traded on
Nasdaq had fallen 30% or more below their highs of last year,
Mr. Constantine said. On the New York Stock Exchange, 45% of
the shares traded there fell a similar amount.</p>
<p>Because of uncertainties about the economy and about Wall
Street, investors aren't paying the premiums they once did
for fast-growing smaller stocks, Mr. Constantine explained.
However, if the market reaches a low in the fourth quarter,
the stage could be set for a rally in small stocks, he said.</p>
<p>Corporate stock buy-backs are providing some business for
over-the-counter trading departments, said Robert King, head
of OTC trading for Robinson-Humphery Co. in Atlanta.</p>
<p>DF Southeastern rose 1/2 to 9 3/8 after the Decatur, Ga.,
thrift announced it will repurchase up to $2.5 million worth
of common stock. The American depositary receipts of
Anangel-American Shipholdings, a Greek shipping company,
added 1/8 to 9 3/4 after announcing a buy-back of up to one
million shares.</p>
<p>Even the OTC market's jewels were tarnished, as investors
took profits in some of this years's better-performing
stocks.</p>
<p>Microsoft dropped 2 to 58 1/2; Sun Microsystems fell 1 1/4
to 27 1/4; Reuters Holdings slipped 1 1/2 to 40 1/8; Amgen
tumbled 3/4 to 46 7/8; and New England Critical Care lapsed
7/8 to 21 1/8.</p>
<p>Apparel stocks swooned after this newspaper reported that
analysts expect the industry to report another quarter of
depressed earnings. G-III Apparel slipped 1 1/2 to 4 1/4 and
Liz Claiborne eased 1 to 24, even though Liz Claiborne is
expected to post decent third-quarter gains. Footwear maker
Nike skidded 1 1/2 to 65 1/2.</p>
<p>Investors didn't spare the shares of companies that
reported earnings disappointments.</p>
<p>Qume plunged 4 1/8 to 2 3/4 after the Milpitas, Calif.,
maker of IBM-compatible products said a proposed buy-out of
the company could be in jeopardy. A group led by David S. Lee
said that it will halt its plan to acquire Qume if all of its
conditions can't be met by Sept. 30. Qume also said it
expects to report a loss of about $1.5 million for the second
quarter ended Aug. 31, compared with year-earlier net income
of $3.1 million, which included a one-time gain of about $1.4
million.</p>
<p>Autoclave Engineers plummeted 2 1/4 to 6 1/2 after the
Erie, Pa., equipment maker reported a loss for the first
quarter ended Aug. 31 of 15 cents a share, compared with
year-earlier net income of 23 cents.</p>
<p>AST Research slipped 1 7/8 to 16 7/8 after the Irvine,
Calif., maker of personal computer systems unveiled a new
model of one of its products and cut the price of an older
model.</p>
<p>Collagen tumbled 1 1/4 to 18 5/8. After the market closed,
the Palo Alto, Calif., biomedical concern said it plans to
delay until early next year the spinoff of its Celtrix unit.</p>
<p>First Interstate of Iowa fell 1 to 4. Late Friday, the Des
Moines, Iowa, commercial bank said it will charge off $2.1
million of commercial real estate and other commerical loans
in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Two Ohio insurers fell sharply. Cincinnati Financial
dropped 3 to 80 1/2 and Ohio Casualty fell 2 1/2 to 33 3/8.
Analysts attributed the drop in Cincinnati Financial to
worries about the insurer's investment portfolio and to
profit-taking in the strong-performing stock, Dow Jones
Professional Investor Report said.</p>
<p>NovaCare tumbled 2 to 16 3/8 in heavy trading after
Barron's magazine raised questions about an offering of 4.5
million shares planned by the Valley Forge, Pa., provider of
speech therapy services.</p>
<p>Among the day's few gainers, Immunex rose 1 1/2 to 28 1/4.
The Seattle biotechnology concern said the Food and Drug
Administration approved the use of its granulocyte
macrophage-colony stimulating factor -- an agent which
stimulates the production of white blood cells -- under
certain conditions, for patients with life-threatening
diseases who have no alternative drugs available to them.</p>
<p>A favorable mention in Barron's boosted the shares of KLA
Instruments 1/8 to 7 3/8. The magazine said earnings should
rebound for the San Jose, Calif., company.</p>
