	<p class="article-leader">Pinault S.A., a wood and paper concern, unveiled a
friendly bid for the 67% of Cie. Francaise d'Afrique
Occidentale it doesn't already own in a share swap that
values all of the distribution and trading company's common
at about 6.04 billion French francs ($1.14 billion).
   Francois Pinault, chairman of both French concerns, said
the move is aimed at building an international industrial and
services group focused on distribution, services such as
equipment leasing, Pinault's core wood holdings and CFAO's
international trading arm. He said the combined concern would
have 1990 revenue of about 32 billion francs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the merger bid, Pinault will offer six of its shares
for every five CFAO shares outstanding. That parity
represents a 37% premium over the last price quoted for CFAO,
before both issues were suspended yesterday, pending the bid.</p>
<p>After payments to minority interests in 1989, Pinault
earned 584 million francs on revenue of 10.19 billion francs,
and CFAO earned 302 million francs on revenue of 31.185
billion francs.</p>
