	<p class="article-leader">The practice of having midwives deliver babies and provide
prenatal care is undergoing a rebirth in the U.S.
   All 50 states long ago legalized the practice of midwifery
by registered nurses operating mostly from hospitals. But
midwives who aren't nurses and largely do deliveries at home
are now seeking legal status.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Montana legalized non-nurse midwives last year, and a
half-dozen states are considering legalization. Washington,
which set up a scholarship fund to train midwives in 1989, is
considering additional funding. And the nonprofit Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has held two
seminars in the past year to promote the profession,
following the World Health Organization's declaration of an
"urgent need" to promote midwifery throughout the U.S.</p>
<p>Midwives were fairly common in the U.S. until the late
1930s. But medical groups are greeting their resurgence much
as they might welcome pestilence and plague. For years,
doctors have portrayed midwifery as dangerous and dirty,
successfully suppressing the legal use of midwives in all but
11 states.</p>
<p>"Midwives are retrogressive," says Albert Haverkamp, a
member of the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists' obstetrics committee. In Florida, three of the
state's largest medical groups are battling midwives'
legalization efforts. New York's nurses association is
blanketing legislators with two full-time and 200 volunteer
lobbyists to fight the midwives. And in California, which
made midwifery illegal in 1936, two legalization bills have
been defeated in the past two decades because of intense
lobbying by medical groups.</p>
<p>Many midwives practice illegally, so experts can only
guess that their total number nationwide is somewhere between
2,000 and 6,000. About 1% of births are midwife-attended, but
that number rises in states where the practice is legal. In
Washington, midwife-attended births soared 50-fold from 1975
to 1988, now representing more than 4.3% of total births.</p>
<p>Fueling demand for midwives are poor and rural women, but
also many middle-class and affluent professional women who
shun more impersonal, high-tech hospital care. "They want
someone to treat them as an individual, not as a potential
lawsuit waiting to happen," says Joan Remington, a Flagstaff,
Ariz., midwife. "Women are tested to death and begin to think
they are a disaster waiting to happen."</p>
<p>Demand for midwives is also being driven by the sickly
state of obstetrics. One in eight obstetricians -- hurt by
malpractice insurance costs averaging $38,138 and soaring to
more than $236,000 in some areas -- has simply stopped
delivering babies, according to the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists. One in four won't handle a
high-risk pregnant woman; more than a third won't take
Medicaid patients. Nearly 800 counties, 26% of all counties
nationwide, lack any clinic where women can get prenatal
care. At Los Angeles public hospitals, women sometimes
deliver babies unattended in the hallway.</p>
<p>In New York, according to a report by the state health
department, seven counties lack any comprehensive prenatal
care for poor women and several have infant mortality rates
that are more than double the national average. But the state
health commissioner, David Axelrod, believes that midwifery
can help solve the problem, and he has lobbied relentlessly
to legalize midwives and use them in hospitals.</p>
<p>As births continue to inch upward, others also see
midwives as one way to improve the country's relatively high
rate of infant mortality and to extend care to areas doctors
don't cover. The World Health Organization says that in the
European countries that have lower infant mortality rates
than the U.S., midwives are used in an average of 70% of the
births. "We talk about risks, but midwife births have very
good outcomes," says Susan Givens, a policy analyst with the
National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality, which was
set up by Congress.</p>
<p>Many women who use midwives say they compare the potential
risks of a low-tech birth, often at home, with the hazards of
doctors' relatively routine use of high-tech equipment and
drugs. Most doctors, for example, use electric fetal
monitors. Recent studies show the monitors reduce neonatal
mortality and morbidity, but they require a woman to lie on
her back, canceling the benefits of gravity and preventing
her from walking around, both of which help labor progress.
The position can also constrict certain arteries and reduce
the flow of oxygen to the fetus, leading to fetal distress
and the need for a Caesarean section.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, the risk of having a Caesarean is
high for women who give birth in U.S. hospitals. One in four
hospital deliveries involves a Caesarean nowadays, compared
with 4% to 12% in Europe, and studies show that the procedure
increases maternal disease, infection and hysterectomies.
Last year, the National Center for Health Statistics found
that the number of Caesareans performed on women hospitalized
for delivery between 1980 and 1987 jumped 48%.</p>
<p>Still, doctors question the qualifications of many
midwives and the safety of home births. Some states, such as
Washington, require midwives to take a three-year
state-accredited midwifery course and pass a licensing exam.
But in Texas, midwives need only plunk down $5 to become
registered. Montana has a five-hour course on emergency
medicine taught by non-physicians.</p>
<p>Most worrisome, says Dr. Haverkamp, the obstetrician, is
that two of every 100 of his seemingly low-risk deliveries
develop unforeseen complications requiring an emergency
operation to save the infant or the mother. "There are cases
where you don't have time to get to a hospital," he says. The
umbilical cord might become caught between the infant's head
and the mother's cervix, cutting off oxygen, or the fetus
might not fit through the birth canal, for example.</p>
<p>"We are being sued out of the profession and creating a
corps of poorly trained individuals to take care of women
instead," Dr. Haverkamp says.</p>
<p>Robert Keszler, a senior special investigator for
California's state medical board, has investigated 300
midwife-assisted births resulting in dead or brain-damaged
babies, and he believes that almost all of them could have
been avoided.</p>
<p>He points to the case of Rosalie Tarpening, who was
illegally assisting in a birth two years ago in Turlock,
Calif. The fetus had contracted pneumonia and died in the
womb during labor, which dragged on for three days before Ms.
Tarpening extracted the body. "Anyone who knew anything about
delivering babies would have recognized the problems" and
intervened to save the infant, says Mr. Keszler. Ms.
Tarpening, who eight years earlier was convicted of
practicing medicine without a license, was convicted last
year of second degree murder and sentenced to one year in
jail, five years' probation and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p>Midwives counter that such incidents are rare and that
babies die in hospitals, too. Many states that allow midwives
to practice permit them to treat only low-risk women and
require that they have doctor backup available, or even have
doctors screen their patients. They must often carry oxygen
and anti-hemorrhaging drugs. In Arizona, there hasn't been a
maternal death since the state licensed midwives 32 years
ago.</p>
<p>"We are well trained. We don't do incantations and cross
our fingers as the baby comes out," says Elizabeth Lee, a
Harvard University graduate who took a seven-month training
program and apprenticed for two years before practicing in
Eagle Pass, Texas.</p>
<p>Justine Clegg, a Dade County, Fla., midwife who uses warm
baths, relaxing music and hot compresses to help women
deliver, says women will employ midwives whether or not they
are legal. In California, midwives have brazenly set up an
association and certification process. Legalization and
licensing, Ms. Clegg says, would ensure competence and a
greater willingness by midwives to turn patients over to a
doctor's care if problems develop.</p>
<p>Such a system might have helped Teresa Hoeppner of Lytle
Creek, Calif. After three easy deliveries in a hospital, she
opted to have her fourth birth with a midwife. "We thought
having a child at home would be a great experience for us and
our children," she says. "The hospital had been cold; the
nurses were mean and did unnecessary testing." Her midwife
said not to worry when a sonogram disclosed a uterine fibroid
tumor and an excess of fluids, a possible sign of
pregnancy-induced diabetes. But during a birthday party for
one son when she was eight months pregnant, she started to
bleed profusely.</p>
<p>Doctors say that only a speedy trip to the hospital 30
miles away, seven units of blood and an emergency Caesarean
saved Mrs. Hoeppner's life. She had developed diabetes and
should have been closely monitored in a hospital late in her
pregnancy, they say. Four days later, she buried her fully
formed stillborn daughter. The midwife was fined $250 and
given two years' probation. She has since moved to Oregon,
where midwifery isn't illegal.</p>
