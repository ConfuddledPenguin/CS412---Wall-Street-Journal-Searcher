	<p class="article-leader">Emerson Electric Co., St. Louis, said its board approved a
plan to spin off its defense operations as a company to be
known as Esco Electronics Corp.
   Under the planned distribution, Emerson holders of record
as of Oct. 5 will receive one Esco share for each 20 shares
of Emerson. The company said the Securities and Exchange
Commission cleared the spinoff. The Esco shares will be
treated as a taxable distribution, it said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales for the latest fiscal year of the units that will
comprise Esco totaled about $600 million, or 8% of Emerson's
overall sales. Pretax earnings were about $15 million, or
1.5% of the parent's overall pre-tax profit, Emerson said.</p>
<p>Emerson also said it won't be suspended from competing for
U.S. government contracts. In May, Emerson pleaded guilty in
federal court in St. Louis to inflating cost proposals on
certain military contracts, agreeing to pay $14 million.
Since the settlement, the company's status as a potential
bidder had been under review.</p>
