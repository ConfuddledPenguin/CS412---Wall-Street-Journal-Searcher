	<p class="article-leader">Omaha, Neb. -- This probably is not a place for people who
don't eat anything with large, moist, soulful eyes. Even so,
Omaha, a town of modest charm with spacious parking lots, has
its attraction. I mean Opera Omaha, now in its 32nd season
and, under Mary Robert's direction, an interesting showcase
for young voices featured in repertoire mixing standards with
unusual works.
   Just recently, for instance, local abattoirs resonated
with the sounds of mostly obscure music as Opera Omaha opened
its fall festival with a typically ambitious program. In
addition to an evening of Kurt Weill, sung by Angelina Reaux
-- in a leg cast after she tripped over one of the town's few
remaining cobblestones -- the company presented Gaetano
Donizetti's opera "Maria Padilla" -- about the
throne-obsessed mistress of Pedro, the Scourge of the Moors
-- and the American premiere of John Casken's "Golem" --
which I think was about the famous mythic man of clay a
medieval rabbi sculpted out of river mud, whispering the name
of God.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I'm not sure though. Each piece exuded mystery of a
different sort. How did a work as unflaggingly melodic as
"Maria Padilla" fail to maintain even a toehold in the
operatic repertoire? How did a talented composer like Mr.
Casken come to write such a dreary little opera? In both
cases, at least some of the blame must go to the librettos.
They are foolish. Donizetti at least battled for a better
libretto, but I don't know what Mr. Casken's excuse could be
-- he wrote most of it.</p>
<p>Yet there is another reason for "Maria Padilla's" failure
to glitter much beyond the premiere in 1841 at La Scala. As
William Ashbrook writes in his splendid volume on Donizetti's
operas, that was the season Verdi's spectacular house debut
eclipsed all the other events, including "Maria Padilla" -- a
work the scholar describes as "one of Donizetti's richest and
most original scores." Verdi's "Nabucco" pulverized "Maria
Padilla" and the piece kept gathering dust throughout this
century, only showing its fine features in a London
presentation in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Mr. Ashbrook, who was on hand for Opera Omaha's "Maria
Padilla," seemed disinclined to disagree with his verdict,
and I doubt that many gathered in Witherspoon Concert Hall
thought he should. Attractively staged by the
designer-director John Pascoe, well-paced by John DeMain, the
company's music director, and often impressively sung, this
production made a strong case that "Maria's" musical virtues
far outweigh its dramatic flaws.</p>
<p>The main problems center on the heroine's bland character
and her troublesome demise. In a pretty tune, Maria describes
a dream she had in which a crown adorned her head. Hardly has
she time to catch her breath, when the future king of Castile
comes hurtling through her balcony, and after an exciting
duet, Maria has moved to his bed and closer to the throne.
Unfortunately, she soon gets an earful from one of opera's
many dreadful fathers, who cannot bear to see her happy and
goes mad to punish her. In one ending, Maria kills herself
when Pedro takes a wife; in another, he dumps the bride and
crowns Maria.</p>
<p>In Omaha, Maria was stabbed by one of her father's
cronies. This third try at an ending fails to convince,
because Maria has shown no evil traits worth punishing and
the patience of an angel waiting for her father to finish a
mad scene not much shorter than Lucia di Lammermoor's.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Opera Omaha's inventiveness came out more
persuasively in the production. The Witherspoon auditorium in
the Joslyn Art Museum -- a handsome art deco building from a
time when Omaha's architecture didn't hit you square between
the eyes -- is quite a challenging venue for opera. There is
no pit and the orchestra is on stage behind the singers --
who take their cues from several TV monitors. The sound is
surprisingly good and I wonder if more companies shouldn't
entertain the notion, since it does remove from sight
beatifically lit time-beaters on elevator platforms and,
besides, reduces the sets to a minimum, another good thing in
an era of soulless, glitzy productions.</p>
<p>Opera Omaha spent $14,000 on the sets and costumes for
"Maria" and "Golem." For the Donizetti, Mr. Pascoe achieved
pretty effects by just moving in a few arches and dropping
gauzy curtains, while letting richly worked costumes do the
rest. Renee Fleming was a radiant-looking Maria in her black
gown sprinkled with diamonds. She has stage presence, and if
she is not yet complete mistress of the ornamented line and
the telling phrase, she nevertheless gave a pleasurable
performance. Ms. Fleming was well-matched by Motti Kaston, as
Pedro, a burly young baritone with a big, lively voice and a
personality to match. Finesse will come later. Hans Gregory
Ashbaker's muscular tenor coped quite successfully with the
father's florid mad scene, and there were fine cameos from
Stella Zambalis and Arturo Valencia as well as solid
contributions from the large and busy chorus.</p>
<p>"Golem" only required a handful of performers and a small
ensemble of musicians who confronted a score harder to bring
to life than a gob of clay. As the subject for a short opera,
the Golem myth -- much fleshed out in the 19th century when
the poor thing acquired the rabbi's daughter as a love
interest -- would seem promising, with its tension between
master and monster, played out in a Prague eerie with
kabbalistic muttering.</p>
<p>Mr. Casken turned this into an incomprehensible tale
padded with obscure references to Prometheus, clumsy pointers
to the Holocaust and an annoying lumpen chorus borrowed
(badly) from Brecht. All this was regrettable since Mr.
Casken's music is basically appealing, with its shimering
tonal palette and flickerings of melody. Just how it came to
pass that Mr. Casken should have received for this first dim
venture into opera the prestigious Britten prize for
composition is a puzzle deeper than any imbedded in the
"Zohar."</p>
<p>The production of Gluck's "Alceste" that opened the Lyric
Opera of Chicago's season was not easy to figure out either.
A nobler subject has rarely touched a composer's heart. Queen
Alceste, hearing from a reliable source -- an oracle -- that
Admetus, her sick husband, will die unless a sacrificial
substitute is found, volunteers herself. He refuses the
gesture; she insists, and only the intercession of the
rambunctious club-swinging Hercules returns her to the world
of the living for a happy end.</p>
<p>In writing "Alceste," Gluck intentionally stripped his
opera of superfluous vocal ornament and wearisome spectacles,
the better to project intensity of feeling and to etch the
drama. That Alceste can still have the effect Gluck desired
is proved by tapes of the young Maria Callas and Dame Janet
Baker at career's end.</p>
<p>In Chicago, the emotional impact was zero. Jessye Norman,
usually a communicative artist, often sang flat while
sounding faint at the top. Towering over the prompter's box,
invoking the gods of Styx in one of the most glorious arias
ever written, she brought to mind a tired diva requesting the
check after a disappointing meal. Only at hell's gates did
she sing with her usual expressiveness and secure tone.</p>
<p>If anything, the staging by Robert Wilson, first seen in
Stuttgart, exacerbated the feeling of distance. Long ago, he
fascinated with his surprising images, finicky lighting,
glacial movements and gibberish-spouting characters that took
us in a freefall into another realm only remotely connected
to the subject at hand.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a similar magic filtered through "Alceste."
For instance, he presented as visual metaphor for impending
doom, an airborne, slowly twisting, slowly growing cube that
eventually dwarfed the people of Greece, when a conventional
director might have just darkened the lights. More often, the
usual tiresome Wilsonian parade of spastics ever so slowly
crossed the stage. Ms. Norman appeared to have a double for
no reason I could figure out. One Ms. N is enough. Not
knowing how to handle the chorus, Mr. Wilson tucked it away
in the pit, where the musicians were already having a rough
time under Gary Bertini's flaccid baton.</p>
<p>Anyone who remembered that Gluck's orchestral sonorities
influenced Berlioz was bound to be puzzled by the covered,
colorless sound emanating from the pit.</p>
<p>The tenor Chris Merritt alone made a strong impression as
Admetus, his bright nasal tones and tense posture conveying
the dying man's hysteria. But for mysterious reasons only the
director can explain, he spent an alarming amount of time
holding up his right hand and staring at it. I wondered
whether he'd adorned it with cues just in case the staging
put him asleep and he needed to find his place in a
performance that seemed to go on till the crack of dawn. Or
was it doom?</p>
