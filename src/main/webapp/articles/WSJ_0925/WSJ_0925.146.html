	<p class="article-leader">Foersaekringsbolaget SPP of Sweden, a big mutual insurer,
said it agreed to raise its voting stake in Gota AB, a
financial services concern, to 48% from 4% in a transaction
valued at 4.6 billion Swedish kronor ($794.4 million).
   The move continues the recently intensified consolidation
of bank ownership in Scandinavia. SPP would be the first
Swedish insurer to wrest a major stake in a bank, as Gota has
securities trading and financial units but its crown jewel is
Gotabanken, Sweden's fourth-biggest bank. The sellers are
Proventus AB, a Swedish investment company that owns 29.8% of
Gota, and Kansallis Osake Pankki, Finland's biggest bank,
which holds a 14.4% voting stake.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>SPP officials said the proposed link with Gota would
provide the distribution clout needed to increase sales of
SPP insurance and investment products. Insurance coverage for
individuals, especially so-called unit-linked policies
recently introduced in Sweden, is expected to become the
fastest growing and most competitive corner of financial
services in coming years.</p>
