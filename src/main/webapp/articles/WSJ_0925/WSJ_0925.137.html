	<p class="article-leader">Chrysler Corp. is recalling 106,000 of its 1987 cars to
reduce excessive carbon-monoxide exhaust, the Environmental
Protection Agency said.
   The affected models are the Plymouth Caravelle and
Reliant; Dodge Aries, Daytona, 600 and Lancer; Chrysler New
Yorker, LeBaron, LeBaron GTS and Town and Country Wagon. All
have 2.5-liter, fuel-injected engines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cars emit excessive amounts of carbon monoxide in their
exhaust as a result of incomplete fuel combustion. Too much
carbon monoxide in the air reduces the amount of available
oxygen, a situation particularly harmful to people with lung
disease or anemia.</p>
<p>Chrysler agreed to the recall after the EPA discovered the
problem during testing. The company is notifying only car
owners who haven't already had their fuel injectors replaced
under warranty.</p>
