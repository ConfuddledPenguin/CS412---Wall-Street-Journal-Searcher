	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Time Warner Inc. and United International
Holdings Inc., eager to break into the Eastern European cable
television market, said they formed a joint venture to
operate cable television systems in Hungary.
   Company officials would not disclose the level of
investment. This is the first tie-up between Denver-based
United International, which operates several cable television
systems in Europe, and Time Warner, one of the world's
biggest media and entertainment companies. United
International is also the largest franchisee of Blockbuster
Video stores in the U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokeswoman for Time Warner said the joint venture,
which seeks to develop and operate cable systems as well as
provide programming services, has been approved by the
Hungarian government. Time Warner will focus on developing
programming, while United International will supervise the
technical side of improving Hungary's cable systems. Planning
for the project is expected to be completed by early
December, with new programs scheduled to be launched in early
1991.</p>
<p>Time Warner officials said it chose Hungary because the
television market is relatively well-developed, as are the
financial and legal institutions. Moreover, with some 400,000
to 500,000 Hungarians already tuning into cable television,
officials of both companies are optimistic about the market
for new cable programs. United International said it has been
exploring the Hungarian cable market for more than a year and
already has some agreements with local cable systems.</p>
