	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Japanese auto makers, finding themselves in the
rare position of playing catch-up, are jumping aboard the
air-bag bandwagon, hot on the heels of their Detroit rivals.
   The latest convert to air bags is Honda Motor Co., which
yesterday said it will make both driver- and passenger-side
air bags standard on virtually all Honda and Acura models
sold in the U.S. by late 1993. (A few, low-priced, stripped
cars may not have standard air bags, company officials said
late yesterday.) It now appears that air bags, once spurned
by auto makers from Detroit to Tokyo, will be standard
equipment on nearly all the cars sold in the U.S. by the
mid-1990s. For the American market, air bags are becoming a
must-have feature on a par with power brakes or fuel
injection.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Honda decided about two months ago to go all-air bags,
Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the company's new president and chief
executive officer, said at a news conference in Detroit. With
that move Honda may leapfrog some competitors, most of whom
currently offer only driver-side air bags. Bags for the
passenger side of the front seat represent a more difficult
engineering proposition, because it's easier to make an air
bag project from the steering wheel than from the dashboard.</p>
<p>The Honda announcement comes just a month after General
Motors Corp. said it will put driver-side air bags in all its
cars by 1995. Ford Motor Co. says it expects to make driver
and passenger air bags standard in all its U.S. models by the
"mid-1990s." Nissan Motor Corp. says it will have driver-side
and passenger-side air bags in its light trucks and most of
its car models by 1995. And Toyota Motor Corp., the No. 1
Japanese company, will put air bags in its cars as it
redesigns the models over the next few years.</p>
<p>"We're working toward putting an air bag in all our
vehicles," says Robert McCurry, executive vice president of
Toyota's U.S. sales arm. "We feel long-term the air bag is
the way to go." Toyota also plans to equip its Previa minivan
with air bags, company officials say.</p>
<p>All this is sweet vindication for Chrysler Corp., which
led the industry by making air bags standard on all its
U.S.-made models last fall. Now, Chrysler is trumpeting its
air-bag leadership in ads that feature testimonials from
Chrysler owners who credit the air bag with saving their
lives in a crash. Chrysler executives also chide their
Japanese rivals for being slow to offer their customers this
technology.</p>
<p>The major Japanese auto makers have indeed lagged behind
Chrysler in pushing air bags into their cars. Honda, for
example, currently offers standard air bags on only two
models, the $22,600-and-up Acura Legend, and the $60,000
Acura NS-X luxury sports car. GM was little better. Only
about one-seventh of the GM cars sold this year have had air
bags.</p>
<p>Auto makers have resisted air bags for two big reasons:
cost, and lingering doubts about technology and consumer
acceptance.</p>
<p>Just last year, GM Chairman Robert C. Stempel (then the
auto maker's president) explained his company's go-slow
approach on air bags by saying they added more than $500 to
the cost of each vehicle. That's why GM outfitted most of its
high-volume, low-priced and mid-priced models with "automatic
seat belts."</p>
<p>The GM belts were anchored to the door, and wrapped around
the driver as the door closed. Japanese auto makers,
meanwhile, opted for motorized belts. In these systems, the
shoulder strap moved back and forth on a track over the door.
Drivers had to latch a lap belt manually.</p>
<p>But automatic belts, while less costly, aren't popular
with many consumers. GM's belts, in particular, have become
the target of criticism from safety advocates, who say the
belts are clumsy and too easy to unlatch.</p>
<p>Moreover, air bags appear to be capturing the imagination
of a public increasingly concerned about safety. "There's
been an extraordinary surge in popular support for air bags
as people have become aware of their benefits," says Chuck
Hurley, vice president of the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety.</p>
<p>That surge is partly the result of some highly publicized
incidents in which air bags saved drivers from serious
injury, Mr. Hurley says. One such case is the "Culpeper
crash" in which two air bag-equipped Chryslers collided
head-on near Culpeper, Va., and the drivers walked away
virtually unscathed. Chrysler has featured this case in some
recent advertising.</p>
<p>There's evidence that the Culpeper crash wasn't a fluke.
In a study of air bag-equipped U.S. government vehicles, the
National Highway Transportation Safety Administration found
that in 167 accidents in which the air bag inflated, all but
14 of the drivers sustained minor injuries or no injuries.
The remaining 14 received "moderate to serious" injuries.</p>
<p>To be sure, air bags alone can't guarantee a car's
success. Chrysler has the most to gain from the growing
popularity of air bags, since all of its domestically built
cars have them. But the company's U.S. car sales and market
share have been sliding most of this year anyway.</p>
<p>As for Honda's announcements that it will go Chrysler one
better by offering standard passenger-side air bags, the
Chrysler spokesman says: "They've got to play catch-up. So
they not only play catch-up, they announce they're going to
go ahead. Obviously, {passenger-side air bags} are something
we're working hard on, too."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>HONDA MOTOR Co. will make driver- and passenger-side air
bags standard on all cars sold in the U.S. by late 1993. In
yesterday's edition, a company spokesman incorrectly stated
that the stripped-down versions of some models might not have
standard air bags.</p>
