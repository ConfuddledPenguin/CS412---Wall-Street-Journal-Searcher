	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Telefon AB L.M. Ericsson picked a new
president for its public telecommunications division, part of
a reorganization intended to broaden management control over
the company's rapid international expansion.
   The Swedish concern said Hakan Jansson, currently a senior
executive at the Radio Systems division and formerly head of
research and development for Public Telecommunications, will
return to his old division as its new president on Jan. 1. He
succeeds Jan Stenberg, a lawyer who headed the company's
biggest division since 1985.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Stenberg already was a member of Ericsson's executive
committee. Under the planned reorganization, he'll now assume
broader responsibilities stretching across previous
divisional boundaries.</p>
<p>Ericsson's new chief executive officer, Lars Ramqvist,
wants Mr. Stenberg and the company's chief financial officer
Carl-Wilhelm Ros to take a more direct role in management of
international operations. As a three-member executive
committee, Messrs. Ramqvist, Ros and Stenberg will inherit
reporting responsibilities for local units in Ericsson's 10
biggest markets.</p>
