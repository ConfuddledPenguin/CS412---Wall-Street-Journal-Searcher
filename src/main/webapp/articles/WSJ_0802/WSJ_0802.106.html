	<p class="article-leader">While I'm sure it matters not a whit to anyone other than
his family or those who knew him well, your reference to the
great automotive designer Harley Earl, in your story on
Giorgetto Giugiaro, misspelled his name (page one, July 12).
Also, his contributions to the legacy of automotive design
went far beyond tail fins and two-tone paint to include
curved windshields, power windows, the Corvette and a number
of other innovations too numerous to list.
   Harley J. Earl II</p>
