	<p class="article-leader">It is well known to readers of this newspaper that before
you fully commit a company's name to a new consumer product,
you test-market it. George Bush has spent about three months
test-marketing a new consumer product called Tax Revenue
Increases. So far, the one thing we know for sure about Tax
Revenue Increases is that Washington's Democrats think it's
the greatest thing since Coca-Cola introduced New Coke.
   The label on the can claims that if you pour the stuff on
the federal budget, by morning the deficit will have shrunk,
the fed funds rate will drop 150 basis points, markets will
revive and GNP growth will spurt upward. Having drunk deeply
from this new formula, the Democrats want Mr. Bush to get out
front and sell the wondrous concoction to the American
people. Well, it now appears that after watching the
Democrats behavior under the influence of Tax Revenue
Increases, Mr. Bush may be having second thoughts about
betting his presidency on its sales potential.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A few years ago, Coca-Cola Co. pulled off a stunning
marketing success with its about-face restoration of Classic
Coke when the public revolted at its abandonment of Coke's
original formula. A few days ago, Congressman Newt Gingrich
suggested that Mr. Bush regroup behind something called
"Republican Classic" -- an original partisan formula of
resisting both new taxes and new spending.</p>
<p>The news out of Washington yesterday suggested that Mr.
Bush is indeed mulling a new marketing strategy for the
budget summit. He can continue to be "nondivisive," pursuing
a budget deal with the Democrats. Or he can get partisan
during Congress's August recess and start using the
President's bully pulpit to berate the Democrats for offering
no concrete spending cuts, threaten a sequester and promise
vetoes of the ever-higher spending bills being passed on
Capitol Hill. We hope Mr. Bush pursues the latter strategy.</p>
<p>One immediate benefit of the President using the bully
pulpit is that it would give the American people an
all-too-rare understanding of where the White House stands on
a major public-policy issue. Yesterday, for instance, the
White House apparently was upset that following a breakfast
with some 150 congressional Republicans, Mr. Gingrich went
out on the driveway and put too hard a spin on Mr. Bush's
frustration with the Democrats' summit negotiators. White
House press secretary Roman Popadiuk then gave a press
briefing to soften the Gingrich spin.</p>
<p>The White House mightn't have to worry about whether its
friends are misinterpreting its intentions if it made its
intentions clearer. That sort of clarity is one of the
benefits of partisan politics. Up to now, the administration
has seemed determined to make the budget summit an exercise
in "responsible government." It's easy to sympathize with the
administration's strategy; the Democrats control both houses
of Congress and no reform of the spending machine will pass
without some Democratic support. So you negotiate, as the
White House says, "in good faith."</p>
<p>No doubt Mr. Bush's goals are worth pursuing: gain lasting
institutional control over federal spending, reassure the
markets that we still have rational government, achieve a
downward slope for the deficit, reinvigorate presidential
authority in the budget process, cut the capital gains tax
and reignite the economy. But at some point you have to stand
back from the negotiations and ask yourself if the Democrats
share any of these goals, or whether their agenda is off on
another track.</p>
<p>This week, for instance, House Democrats passed a defense
bill that virtually sequesters the Pentagon and makes the
office of the Secretary of Defense barely relevant. Their
already-enacted domestic appropriations bills are pumping up
federal spending well beyond the rising tax revenues coming
into the Treasury. And it seems obvious that one of the
party's big goals for the budget summit is to achieve some
sort of soak-the-rich tax increase that presumably will help
win back the Reagan Democrats who keep putting Republicans in
the White House. What does any of this have in common with
the administration's views of responsible government?</p>
<p>By all means let's dedicate the dog days of August to a
round of political partisanship over the direction of the
federal budget. One of the growing political problems of our
time is that the public is beginning to view Washington as
essentially "them," a congealed glob of indistinguishable
politicians who cause problems like the S&L mess or runaway
federal spending. The behind-closed-doors budget deal,
whatever its high intentions, runs the risk of contributing
to this corrosive cynicism.</p>
<p>If there are fundamental philosophical disputes between
Republicans and Democrats over taxes and spending, let's get
them out where the public can see them. That's what a
democracy is for. Come September, Mr. Bush may have concluded
that it really is time to bring back his own version of
Coca-Cola Classic.</p>
