	<p class="article-leader">Cigna Corp.'s second-quarter net income rose 7% to $158
million, or $2.05 a share, while Travelers Corp.'s net
dropped nearly 11% to $102 million, or 98 cents a share.
   While both companies saw earnings increase for their
employee benefits and group-health business, the continued
pricing war in the property/casualty area hurt their results.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The lack of improvement in property and casualty industry
pricing conditions will constrain both 1990 and 1991 results,
said Wilson H. Taylor, Cigna's chairman and chief executive
officer. Cigna, based in Philadelphia, said property/casualty
operating profit fell to $17 million from $27 million a year
ago.</p>
<p>As a way of improving results in this market segment,
Cigna plans to accelerate the previously announced
consolidation of its domestic property/casualty field
offices. Later this year, the company expects to take a
charge of no more than $65 million, on an after-tax basis, to
reflect these consolidation costs.</p>
<p>Consolidated revenue at Cigna rose 26% to $4.8 billion in
the second quarter. For the six months, net fell 13% to $200
million on revenue of $8.7 billion, which rose 16% from the
1989 first half.</p>
<p>Travelers Chairman Edward H. Budd said that the company
has taken on a number of programs to reduce operating costs
and improve the quality of its book of business in the
property/casualty area. During the second quarter, the
company restructured its agent commission schedule to provide
agents with incentives for bringing in higher-quality
automobile insurance business. Travelers, based in Hartford,
Conn., also announced plans to withdraw from the personal
lines market from nine states.</p>
<p>While net from Travelers' commercial property/casualty
business rose 23% to $65 million, partly due to realized
capital gains of $20 million, earnings from its personal
property/casualty lines plunged to $300,000 from $6 million a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Travelers also said its results were adversely affected by
continued underperforming real estate assets. While real
estate conditions had improved in the Southwest, the company
said markets continued to soften in other areas. The company
is continuing its program for restructuring loans, property
sales and the management of foreclosed properties to maximize
value longer term.</p>
<p>Travelers' second-quarter revenue fell to $3 billion from
$3.2 billion a year ago. For the six months, earnings fell to
$193 million, or $1.85 a share, from $212 million, or $2.06 a
share.</p>
<p>In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday,
Cigna closed at $47.25, up 25 cents, while Travelers closed
unchanged at $27.375. The news concerning Cigna was released
after Big Board trading had ended for the day.</p>
