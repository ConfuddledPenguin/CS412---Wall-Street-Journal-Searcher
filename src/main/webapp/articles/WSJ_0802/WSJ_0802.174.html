	<p class="article-leader">Crude oil for September delivery at the New York
Mercantile Exchange jumped 85 cents a barrel in heavy and
sometimes frantic trading, finishing at $21.54. Heating oil
and gasoline prices roared upward as well, with many contract
prices climbing the daily limit set by the exchange.
   Rumors that Iraq had invaded Kuwait sparked the buying
binge. Reports that Iraq abruptly walked out of negotiations
with Kuwait, abandoning a second round of talks scheduled for
yesterday morning, provoked additional buying interest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Late last night, the Kuwaiti Embassy reported that Iraqi
troops crossed into Kuwait. The action followed the
deployment of about 100,000 Iraqi troops at Iraq's border
with Kuwait.</p>
<p>Sharply higher prices are indicative "of the market's
concern that there could be some type of military action on
the part of Iraq," said Michael Rothman, senior energy
analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. "It was clearly a
case of buying the rumor."</p>
<p>Officials of Kuwait and Iraq were meeting in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, to try to settle differences that threaten to disrupt
the current uneasy peace in the Middle East. Iraq is asking
Kuwait to compensate it for $2.4 billion of oil it alleges
was pumped from an oil field straddling their border. The
exact location of that border has been disputed by the two
countries for years.</p>
<p>Iraq has also charged Kuwait with flooding the market with
crude oil to keep oil prices low and wreck the Iraqi economy,
which is heavily dependent on oil for revenue. It is also
demanding that Kuwait forgive the huge debt Iraq owes its
tiny neighbor. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia lent Iraq money to
support its 1980s war effort against Iran.</p>
<p>Also considered bullish were reports by Dow Jones
International Petroleum Report that Kuwait told some U.S.
customers it was cutting the amount of crude it would sell
them for September delivery. Traders interpreted this as a
sign that Kuwait is going to comply with its daily production
quota of 1.5 million barrels set by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries.</p>
<p>But some market participants are leery of the sharp price
run-up. If Kuwait's production were suddenly removed from the
market, supply tightness would surely occur, but with
inventories near record highs, "fundamentally nothing has
changed," said Nauman Barakat, first vice president of energy
futures for Shearson Lehman Brothers. "A lot of the run-up is
emotion and hype."</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices surged to fresh life-of-contract
highs in most deliveries on strong foreign demand. The
September contract ended with a gain of 4.25 cents a pound at
$1.2885 after trading at a contract high of $1.2920. A strong
boost also came from a U.S. Mint tender for the purchase of
8.7 million pounds of copper. Offering prices ranged from
$1.2839 to $1.3151 a pound, according to an analyst. He said
these high prices came in the face of continued indications
of a sluggish U.S. economy. "This means that the copper
industry is expecting tighter supplies later in the year,"
the analyst said. Market leadership at the moment is coming
from Western Europe and Japan, where demand is buoying
prices, he said. In futures, prices rose above previous
contract highs except for the most distant delivery months,
as aggressive buying of futures contracts by computer-guided
funds fueled the strong advance, the analyst said. Another
analyst observed that this is the third consecutive summer
that copper prices have rallied, contrary to a historical
pattern of sluggish summer consumption and lower prices. "Not
only that," he said, but yesterday "aluminum, zinc, tin,
nickel and lead prices were also strong. It makes you wonder
if we here in the U.S. are not aware of something that may be
taking place when all these base metals go up together."</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices rose. December delivery
gold rose $3.20 an ounce to $382.40. September silver was up
3.3 cents an ounce at $4.8550. October platinum advanced
$1.30 an ounce to $492.20. Peter Cardillo, director of
commodity research for Jesup, Josephthal Inc., New York, said
renewed tensions between Iraq and Kuwait helped prices to
firm, but the main upward thrust came from strength in the
bond market, "which indicated lower interest rates, which is
favorable for gold." Another analyst observed that the rally
ran into resistance at just over $375 in the August contract,
which ended at $373.30 for a gain of $3.30, and at just over
$385 in the December contract. A third analyst said
inflationary potential from the strong surge in crude oil
prices was a price-firming factor for gold. One reason
current resistance levels are so important in gold, he said,
is that after the Saudi Arabian sales of gold in March, the
market consolidated into a trading range in which the bottom
was about $384 for the December contract. "The December price
has been having difficulty getting above that. But if it
does, we could see further gains of between $10 and $15," he
said.</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: A sell-off during the last half of
trading dragged the price of November soybean futures
contracts down 13.5 cents a bushel. Analysts said the selling
was prompted by concerns about the amount of purchases of
grains, including soybeans, by the Soviet Union. In addition,
they said, some investors liquidated positions in soybean
futures as prices fell past preset stopping points, which
exacerbated the sell-off. Argentina, a soybean producing
country with the world's lowest soybean meal prices, reported
lower-than-expected exports to the Soviet Union. "That just
refocused the market's attention on the fact that the Soviets
have been basically absent," said Anne Frick, soybean analyst
for Prudential-Bache Securities. Other grain futures prices
also declined, partly in sympathy with soybeans and partly on
reports of relatively favorable growing conditions.</p>
<p>SUGAR: Futures prices fell sharply. The October contract
was off 0.54 cent a pound at 10.55 cents. Liquidation of
contracts has continued to depress prices because demand for
sugar in the world market hasn't been enough to spark a
desire to buy futures contracts and support prices, one
analyst said. China had been expected to buy sugar at around
10.50 cents, "but if she doesn't, who will?" the analyst
asked. Also, the analyst said, traders are expecting a report
from a major sugar trade firm on the 1990-91 sugar crop,
whose season begins Sept. 1. "Some may be expecting the
report to show a relatively small shortfall of production
under consumption or for production to even top usage. This
is in sharp contrast to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
recent preliminary estimate that a significant production
shortfall will take place," the analyst said.</p>
