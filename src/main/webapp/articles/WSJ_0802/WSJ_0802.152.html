	<p class="article-leader">MILAN, Italy -- The Chamber of Deputies approved a bill
that restricts private ownership of Italy's press and
television and establishes strict guidelines for media
advertising. The bill now returns to the Senate, Italy's
upper house, where it's expected to have an easy passage.
   The measure strikes at the heart of issues -- media
financing and ownership -- that are intricately bound up with
both the wielding of political influence in Italy and the
financing of its political parties. It limits cross-ownership
of television stations and newspapers, particularly affecting
the media empire of Silvio Berlusconi, who controls three
television stations and the Milan-based daily Il Giornale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Newspaper owners controlling more than 16% of the national
market will be banned from owning national television
stations, while those controlling between 8% and 16% of the
market will be restricted to one such station. Those with
less than 8% will be permitted to control two stations.
Groups with no papers will be allowed up to three stations.
Officials of Mr. Berlusconi's company, Fininvest S.p.A., say
the bill means he has to give up Il Giornale, and lose $86
million a year in advertising.</p>
<p>The measure also limits the advertising breaks during
drama programs, restricts the showing of sexually explicit
material and requires private TV and radio owners to
broadcast news items.</p>
