	<p class="article-leader">BRUSSELS -- European Community Commission sources said the
EC may substantially cut production subsidies to the European
consortium Airbus Industrie to try to resolve a long dispute
with the U.S.
   The sources said commission negotiators, acting on behalf
of the four countries involved in the consortium -- Britain,
France, Spain and West Germany -- have offered to cut all
production subsidies on aircraft with more than 100 seats.
This category would include the Airbus 330 and 340 aircraft
that are at the heart of the dispute.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Figures weren't immediately available on the amount of the
subsidies covered by the EC offer.</p>
<p>The U.S. trade delegation in Washington has indicated that
if the commission made such a move, it wouldn't take the
issue to the Geneva-based General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.</p>
<p>The U.S.'s original deadline for resolving the dispute was
Tuesday, but now negotiations between the two sides are set
to continue.</p>
<p>Sources say the commission is also offering to cut
subsidies for development costs by as much as 50%. The U.S.
wants no more than 35% of the costs subsidized.</p>
