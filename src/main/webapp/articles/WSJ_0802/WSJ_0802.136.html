	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- The Stempel Era at General Motors Corp. has
begun, even if new GM Chairman Robert C. Stempel doesn't like
that label.
   "Frankly, we aren't looking for stories on Bob Stempel,"
Mr. Stempel said during a first-day-on-the job news
conference yesterday. "We want the focus to be on GM and GM
products."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Thus did Mr. Stempel, who turned 57 years old a month ago,
launch his administration of the world's largest industrial
corporation. He said GM is done with big acquisitions,
already has announced all the factory shutdowns it needs to
make, and is concerned that consumers may be jittery about
the economy in the wake of the savings-and-loan fiasco.</p>
<p>But the nuances were more important than the news. Among
them:</p>
<p>-- The finance men and central-office staffers who ran GM
for decades are taking a back seat, literally. The executive
vice presidents in charge of finance and corporate staffs sat
farthest away from Mr. Stempel on the dais at yesterday's
briefing. And they were the last to make presentations. Mr.
Stempel's hand-picked executive team is dominated by people
like himself -- engineers and executives with broad vehicle
operations experience.</p>
<p>-- Mr. Stempel wants to avoid the fate of his predecessor,
Roger B. Smith, who became The Issue at GM. The new chairman
shared the spotlight yesterday with GM's six other top
executives, and deferred to each in turn to discuss his area
of responsibility. All together, the seven men used the words
"team" or "teamwork" 27 times in just over an hour.</p>
<p>-- The new philosophy at GM is back-to-basics. "We've been
through enough mergers, diversifications, and acquisitions
for a while," said Mr. Stempel. "I look for this team to
focus on cars and trucks." Lloyd E. Reuss, 53, who as GM's
new president is assuming one of Mr. Stempel's former titles,
added that it's now time "to move the organizational focus
from what we are going to do to how we get it done. The `how'
is always much more difficult than the `what.'"</p>
<p>Messrs. Stempel and Reuss said GM's traditional top-down
management style is going to change. "There's a definite
effort to reduce layers of management," Mr. Stempel said. "A
definite effort to move decisions down" closer to local
operations. However, he declared: "We aren't going to take GM
apart and put it back together again."</p>
<p>That's what Mr. Stempel's predecessor, Roger B. Smith, did
in 1984, when he shredded GM's huge body and assembly
divisions and reassembled the pieces as a large-car group and
a small-car group. But Mr. Stempel has shown in his career an
aversion to the big-bang approach to change.</p>
<p>Instead, Mr. Stempel is making subtle changes in GM's
organizational structure. For example, for the first time GM
won't have a chief operating officer interposed between the
chairman and the major operating groups.</p>
<p>In another first, GM's quality and reliability staff will
report directly to the chairman. That isn't a big change in
practice. The quality-control staff reported to Mr. Stempel
when he was president. But now quality improvement has as
much importance, at least symbolically, as financial
management.</p>
<p>Likewise, the strategies Mr. Stempel and his colleagues
outlined for GM's key markets reflected changes in emphasis,
not sudden switches.</p>
<p>The man running overseas operations, Vice Chairman John F.
Smith Jr. (no relation to the retired chairman), said GM is
"very bullish" on its prospects in Europe, and is hopeful for
a recovery in the battered Brazilian market. Mr. Smith also
said he'd like to export some of GM's new Saturn cars as part
of an effort to boost the auto maker's exports from North
America to 250,000 vehicles a year from the current 112,000 a
year.</p>
<p>Mr. Reuss, who runs North American and component
operations, illustrated his strategy with a diagram --
immodestly labelled "Framework for Greatness" -- that looked
like a plate balanced on a spear. Mr. Reuss said he'd like to
see plants working on the same three-shift systems that have
produced record profits in Europe.</p>
<p>Robert T. O'Connell, the top finance man, said the finance
staff's new role will be to act as "creative partner in
helping the company achieve true greatness."</p>
<p>This optimistic talk reflects the urge for a honeymoon
period for Mr. Stempel among many GM employees. But a
honeymoon, if any, will be brief. GM still faces a struggle
to boost the marginal profits in its North American auto
operations. More immediately, Mr. Stempel must negotiate a
new national contract with the United Auto Workers union,
which is furious over plant closings in recent years. UAW
leaders issued a statement yesterday hailing the new chairman
as a "car guy," but warning that he mustn't "treat workers as
expendable."</p>
<p>Still Mr. Stempel sounded upbeat.</p>
<p>"I felt terrific this morning," he said. "Someone on the
radio said, `Guess who's got a new job today?' And they
mentioned my name."</p>
