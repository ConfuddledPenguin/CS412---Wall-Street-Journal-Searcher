	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Evidence that the nation's industrial core is
contracting may be bad news for the economy, but it
invigorated the bond market.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said
yesterday that its index of business conditions declined to
47.4% in July, down from 51.1% in June. The index is designed
so that a reading below 50% should indicate that the
manufacturing segment of the economy is declining and a
reading above 50% should suggest that manufacturing is
expanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The NAPM report "got the market off to the races," said
Steve Ricchuito, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Securities Inc. He said the NAPM report, which followed a
string of anemic economic indicators, fueled speculation that
the economy is in trouble and that the Federal Reserve may
eventually come to the rescue by cutting short-term interest
rates.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose more than 5/8
point yesterday, which translates into gains of about $6.25
for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The yield on the
benchmark bond, which moves in the opposite direction of
prices, fell to 8.35%.</p>
<p>Some analysts were surprised that bonds held their gains
considering oil prices spiked higher. Often, rising oil
prices rekindle inflation fears, which hurts bonds. But some
traders explained that bond investors view the rise in oil
prices as temporary.</p>
<p>"People looked beyond {yesterday's} price move," said
Michael Moran, manager of government trading at Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. He said that investors
believe the forces pressuring oil prices, "will go away
eventually." Prices for oil, as well as food and several
other commodity prices, are extremely volatile.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Moran suggests that oil prices could become a
negative factor for the bond market if prices continue to
rise, and especially if "some of the oil uptick finds its way
into," the producer price index report. The PPI, due to be
released next week, is a measure of inflation on the
wholesale level.</p>
<p>The bond market didn't blink at news the Treasury intends
to sell $32.25 billion of securities next week at its
quarterly refunding of the government debt. Many analysts
were expecting the refunding to total about $31.5 billion.</p>
<p>But given expectations of a weakening economy, lower
inflation and declining interest rates, more supply was
looked at by many participants as "an opportunity to buy"
bonds said Samuel Kahan, chief financial economist at Fuji
Securities Inc., Chicago.</p>
<p>The refunding will comprise a record $11.5 billion of
three-year notes scheduled for sale next Tuesday; $10.5
billion of 10-year notes scheduled for sale next Wednesday
and $10.25 billion of 30-year bonds to be sold next Thursday.</p>
<p>The Treasury said the auctions would be contingent on
legislation raising the debt ceiling, which injects a note of
uncertainty that could push rates higher or keep them from
falling much further.</p>
<p>When-issued trading will not begin until a debt ceiling
bill is passed, which means dealers will be less certain of
investor demand for the securities they are underwriting.</p>
<p>In its quarterly refunding news release, the Treasury also
projected a massive net market borrowing requirement of
between $65 billion to $70 billion during the fourth quarter.
That will be a record amount of borrowing.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>The Treasury's announcement that it will sell a record
$32.25 billion of notes and bonds at next week's quarterly
refunding of the federal debt didn't move bond prices an
inch.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of
104 8/32, up from 103 19/32. The yield eased to 8.35% from
8.41%. The latest two-year notes ended at 100 9/32, up from
100 7/32. The yield on the two-year notes fell to 7.83% from
7.86%.</p>
<p>Short-term rates moved moderately lower yesterday. The
discount rate on three-month bills fell to 7.43% for a
bond-equivalent yield of 7.66%, while the rate on six-month
bills fell to 7.27% to yield 7.63%.</p>
<p>Corporate, Junk Bonds</p>
<p>Corporate bond investors put aside memories of the
Seabrook nuclear power plant's troubled history and eagerly
snapped up $211.8 million of secured lease obligation bonds
backed by the plant, which is now operating.</p>
<p>United Illuminating Co., a major shareholder in the New
Hampshire nuclear power plant, indirectly issued $82.77
million of 16-year bonds priced at par to yield 9.76% and
$129.06 million of 30-year bonds priced at par to yield
10.24%.</p>
<p>The transaction was structured as follows: The Seabrook I
bonds are considered obligations of United Illuminating. The
bonds were issued by Meridian Bank, the owner-trustee in the
transaction, which was acting on behalf of a unit of
Citicorp's Citibank unit, which invested $38 million for an
equity stake in the nuclear plant. In the sale-leaseback
transaction, United Illuminating sold a 7% stake in the
Seabrook plant to Meridian Bank.</p>
<p>The bonds are secured by United Illuminating's lease
payments to Seabrook, as well as by the portion of the
Seabrook plant that was sold.</p>
<p>Proceeds from yesterday's debt sale will be used to redeem
United Illuminating's outstanding high-coupon debt starting
in mid-August.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade corporate debt market, high-grade
corporate bonds ended 1/2 to 3/4 point higher.</p>
<p>In the junk-bond market, concerns about the unraveling of
the buy-out offer for UAL Corp. damped sentiment in the
high-yield market, sending low-rated or unrated
speculative-grade securities 1/8 to 1/4 point lower.</p>
<p>Among the junk bonds that registered marked declines were
Fort Howard Corp.'s 12 5/8% subordinated debentures which
fell 1/2 point to 97 1/2. The bonds started to drop after
news that the company's chairman and chief executive is
resigning.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Municipal bonds finished flat to 3/8 point higher.</p>
<p>A little new supply came into the municipal market when a
Goldman, Sachs & Co. group won the Maryland Department of
Transportation's $100 million consolidated transportation
revenue bonds, Series 1990.</p>
<p>The bonds were priced to yield from 6% in 1993 to 6.80% in
2005. All bonds were sold by the time dealings finished.</p>
<p>In secondary trading, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% securites of 2018 ended 1/8 higher at 99 3/4, with the
yield unchanged at 7.21%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities closed higher.</p>
<p>The issuance of derivative products stalled yesterday,
following Tuesday's introduction of $1 billion in new real
estate mortgage investment conduits.</p>
<p>"There's no way to keep up the issuance we saw {Tuesday},"
said one trader. But, he added, with the market rallying, and
with expectations of lower interest rates intact, "we'll
definitely see some more deals soon."</p>
<p>Among actively traded issues, Government National Mortgage
Association 9.5% securities were up 10/32 at 100 23/32.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9% issues were up 15/32 at
97 26/32, and Federal National Mortgage Association 9% issues
were up 15/32 at 98 10/32.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>The West German bond market set a record in new-issue
volume with the sale of eight billion of new 10-year
government bonds.</p>
<p>The bonds, issued with a coupon rate of 8.5%, were sold
during two days. Three billion marks ($1.89 billion) of bonds
were placed Tuesday via the traditional federal bond
consortium. Yesterday, 2.9 billion marks of the bonds were
sold through a U.S.-style competitive auction and 2.1 billion
worth were allocated to the Bundesbank, West Germany's
central bank.</p>
<p>Dealers said the bulk of both days' sales ended up in the
portfolios of West German banks or were purchased by
professional traders for arbitrage accounts.</p>
<p>Other domestic investors showed little interest in the
bonds. International investors were light buyers at the
auction, dealers said. Japanese investors, who had been
expected to buy large amounts, took "very little," according
to a trader in the Frankfurt office of a Japanese bank.</p>
<p>In the secondary market, prices of the new 10-year bonds
fell as much as 1/2 point, weighed down by the heavy supply,
recurrent reports of East Germany seeking more cash from West
Germany and a sell-off in the futures pit.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Japanese and British government bonds ended
moderately higher yesterday.</p>
