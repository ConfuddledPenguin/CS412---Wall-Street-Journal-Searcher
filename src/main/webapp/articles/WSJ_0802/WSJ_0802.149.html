	<p class="article-leader">The accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche will "vigorously"
defend itself against a lawsuit filed in connection with its
work as auditor of the failed FirstSouth Savings & Loan
Association of Pine Bluff, Ark., a spokeswoman for the firm
said.
   The suit, filed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
last week in federal court in Little Rock, Ark., seeks a
minimum of $400 million in damages from the accounting firm
for allegedly faulty audits performed by one of its
predecessors, Deloitte Haskins & Sells.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Deloitte Haskins, which merged last December with Touche
Ross & Co., had performed audits of FirstSouth's books in
1983, 1984 and 1985.</p>
<p>The suit specifically accuses Deloitte of ignoring
"grossly deficient underwriting" of loans and letters of
credit at the thrift; of failing to recognize that the thrift
was delaying the recording of losses on nonperforming loans
by "parking" the loans with insiders; and of failing to
detect violations of federal limits on loans to one borrower.</p>
<p>The new lawsuit against Deloitte is the most recent of the
government's aggressive efforts to recoup some of its losses
from the failure of FirstSouth. Last year, the government
obtained $27.6 million through separate settlements with
FirstSouth's former law firm, the thrift's officers and
directors and a now-disbanded Dallas mortgage brokerage firm
that had placed several loans with the thrift.</p>
