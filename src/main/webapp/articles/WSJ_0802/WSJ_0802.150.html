	<p class="article-leader">BSN Corp. said that PaineWebber Inc. is soliciting offers
to buy all or parts of the assets of the Dallas sporting
goods manufacturer. BSN expects the offers to exceed the
company's book value of $9.20 a share.
   BSN's board already has rejected unsolicited offers that
it considered inadequate. Houston-based Pelham Investment
Associates Limited Partnership has acquired 7.3% of the
company's shares and has sought to buy a controlling
interest.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The BSN board commissioned an appraisal of the company in
response to the purchase inquiries. "The study showed us that
the value of the company is in excess of book value," said
Michael Blumenfeld, president. In trading on the American
Stock Exchange, BSN shares closed yesterday at $5.625, up
37.5 cents.</p>
<p>BSN also said it postponed its plans to sell its Sports
Supply Group division in a public offering until it has
evaluated the response to PaineWebber's solicitation. The
board also expanded the company's share-repurchase program to
two million shares from one million subject to asset sales.</p>
