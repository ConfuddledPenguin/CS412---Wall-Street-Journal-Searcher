	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Senate Appropriations Committee approved
a $20.7 billion bill funding the Treasury and Postal Service
through fiscal 1991 and incorporating provisions to deploy
Secret Service agents in federal investigations of
savings-and-loan fraud.
   The final language represents a compromise between the
Secret Service and the rival Federal Bureau of Investigation,
which strongly resisted an initial House-passed proposal
giving the Secret Service new authority to initiate its own
S&L inquiries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Senate bill is phrased to give authority to the
Justice Department to "accept" assistance from the Secret
Service. But within these parameters, the Secret Service
would have the same authority as the Justice Department to
conduct civil and criminal inquiries.</p>
<p>"I believe it is critical that the Secret Service be
brought into the picture as soon as possible," said Attorney
General Richard Thornburgh, in a letter this week to the
appropriations leadership. Mr. Thornburgh's hand is
strengthened by the compromise. But the FBI came to the
negotiations reluctantly and, according to sources, was
apparently prodded by suggestions from the committee that it
could otherwise lose $98.4 million elsewhere in the bill for
its Washington field office.</p>
