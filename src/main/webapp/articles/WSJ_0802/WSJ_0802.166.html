	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Loews Corp.'s second-quarter net income fell
41%, reflecting a 58% profit drop at its insurance business.
   Analysts said the fall in earnings in the insurance
business was expected. They were surprised, however, by the
15% drop in Loews's tobacco profit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Second-period net dropped to $192.9 million, or $2.60 a
share, from $329 million, or $4.38 a share, a year earlier.
The results also reflect a loss from realized investments of
$16.8 million, or 23 cents a share, compared with gains of
$61.5 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Revenue at Loews, which has interests in hotels, watches,
ships and insurance, among other things, grew 3.4% to $3.09
billion from $2.99 billion.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Loews shares
dropped $4.50 to $99.75 on heavy volume of 643,000 shares.</p>
<p>Earnings from the CNA Financial insurance business dropped
to $70.4 million from $169.5 million. The tobacco business,
which generates about 50% of the parent's profit, saw
earnings fall 15% to $104.5 million from the year-earlier
$122.8 million.</p>
<p>"I wasn't expecting a shortfall in the tobacco business,"
said Diana K. Temple, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. "The
earnings were about 40 cents less than I thought." The
company attributed the lower earnings at the Lorillard
tobacco operation to a drop in demand after prices were
raised in May.</p>
<p>Loews also said it had purchased in the open market about
952,000 of its common shares during the past six months and
said it intends to buy additional shares periodically. At
June 30, Loews had an average 74.1 million shares
outstanding, down 1.3% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>For the six months, Loews said net fell 22% to $416.6
million, or $5.60 a share, from $533.5 million, or $7.08 a
share, for the like 1989 period. Revenue rose 8.3% to $6.07
billion from $5.61 billion.</p>
<p>The latest six-month results reflect a gain of $70.2
million, or 94 cents a share, on the sale of three oil
tankers.</p>
