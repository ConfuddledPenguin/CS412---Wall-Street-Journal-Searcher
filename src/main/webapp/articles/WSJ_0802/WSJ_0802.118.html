	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stocks finished only slightly lower, despite a
big rout in bank shares.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average eased 5.94 to 2899.26.
New York Stock Exchange volume surged to 176,810,000 shares,
the heaviest since July 24, when 181.9 million shares traded.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Several bank and savings and loan stocks were taken down
in aggressive selling yesterday. Traders said the bad news
has been mounting, and yesterday the selling intensified in
dozens of shares. Among the big losers: Chemical Bank fell 1
to 22; Citicorp slipped 5/8 to 19 3/8; Wells Fargo tumbled 2
5/8 to 65 7/8 and Security Pacific slid 1 to 30 5/8.</p>
<p>A page one article in this newspaper yesterday described
how many of the traditional profit centers of big banks are
eroding.</p>
<p>Savings and loan associations weren't spared. HomeFed fell
1 1/8 to 10; H.F. Ahmanson dropped 3/4 to 19 and Great
Western Financial slipped 1/8 to 15 3/8. "Investors are
worried about California real estate," said Nancy Spady,
analyst at Morgan Stanley. "Unfortunately, I don't think
people are differentiating between commercial and residential
lenders." She said she maintains a "buy" recommendation on
Great Western Financial and Ahmanson because of their focus
on residential real estate lending. She added, "HomeFed's
credit-quality problems are linked primarily to multifamily
and commercial real estate outside of California."</p>
<p>Traders said the market was full of crosscurrents
yesterday. The National Association of Purchasing Management
said its July index of business conditions fell to 47.4% from
51.1% in June. The decline ended three consecutive months of
increases. A reading below 50 indicates that the
manufacturing segment of the economy is generally declining;
above 50, that it is generally expanding.</p>
<p>While this weak economic data gave a boost to bond prices,
stocks didn't fall significantly. Investors continue to look
beyond lagging economic indicators to hopes for stronger
corporate profits in the months ahead. Their enthusiasm for
earnings strength could be seen in Eastman Kodak, which
jumped 4 1/4, or 11%, to 42 3/8, making the stock the largest
gainer on the Big Board yesterday.</p>
<p>Kodak earned $1.19 in the second quarter, up from 24 cents
the previous year; the results beat the consensus by 20
cents. Many analysts raised their full-year estimates after
the report.</p>
<p>Earnings growth is still the dominant theme in the stock
market, but investors are searching for stocks in which they
can buy growth cheaply.</p>
<p>"I sense a growing nervousness and bearishness," said J.
David Mills, portfolio manager at Boston Co. Advisers. He
said growth-stock investors are losing confidence that their
stocks will continue to be big winners in the second half.
"The ability to forecast earnings in this economy is tough,"
he added.</p>
<p>So while high-profile growers, such as Procter & Gamble,
which fell 1 1/4 yesterday to 85 1/2, get notched down day by
day, other stocks such as Fund American -- whose earnings
outlook is brightening after a five-year spate of stagnant
profits -- are turning up. Fund American gained 1 5/8 to 38
1/8 yesterday.</p>
<p>Still, in a slowing economy, big multinational companies
are paying out more earnings in dividends, which attracts
many investors. Arnold Kaufman, editor of Standard & Poor's
"Outlook" newsletter, noted that dividend increases on an S&P
universe of some 7,500 stocks this year may be the lowest
since 1971, the year President Nixon mandated a freeze on
corporate dividends. But while the dividend outlook on S&P's
broad universe of stocks is sickly, dividends paid by the 500
S&P companies are expected to grow about 8% this year.</p>
<p>Through July, only 825 companies have increased dividends,
down from 1,037 a year earlier. Dividend cuts rose 36.5% for
the same period and omissions increased 88.5%, S&P said.</p>
<p>"The weakness in dividends is a direct reflection of poor
corporate profits, and it also reflects the increase in
corporate leverage," said Mr. Kaufman.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recent rally in oil stocks continued as
September crude-oil futures rose well above $21 a barrel --
the price target set by OPEC at its meeting last weekin New
York trading. Exxon added 1/4 to 52 1/8 on two million
shares, Mobil rose 1/8 to 65 3/8, Amoco gained 3/8 to 56 and
Atlantic Richfield went up 1 1/8 to 130 1/2.</p>
<p>Utility issues remained on the upswing as well; the Dow
Jones Utility Average posted its seventh consecutive advance
by rising 2.89 to 212.90. Detroit Edison climbed 7/8 to 29
5/8, Houston Industries gained 3/4 to 34 1/2, Public Service
Enterprise Group rose 5/8 to 26 1/8 and Scana added 3/8 to 33
3/4.</p>
<p>Another traditional "safe haven" for investment funds, the
precious-metals sector, also fared well. Battle Mountain Gold
added 1/2 to 11 7/8, Homestake Mining rose 1/2 to 19 7/8,
Placer Dome gained 1/2 to 17 3/8 and ASA Ltd. rallied 1 3/8
to 48 3/4.</p>
<p>However, American Barrick Resources fell 1 1/8 to 21 after
saying it doesn't expect the current estimate of gold
reserves at a property in Nevada to be "expanded
significantly" as a result of continued exploration drilling
there. Results to date indicate the site holds about five
million ounces of gold, the company said.</p>
<p>UAL fell 4 1/8 to 135 7/8 amid further uncertainty about
whether a union-led group would succeed in obtaining
financing for its $4.38 billion buy-out bid. Three of the
five banks that have been working with the group -- Citicorp,
Chase and Chemical -- now have withdrawn from financing
talks.</p>
<p>Home Depot gained 2 3/8 to 36 5/8 on 1.3 million shares.
Prudential-Bache Securities repeated its buy recommendation
on the stock; analyst L. Wayne Hood called Home Depot his
"single best idea" in the retailing group. Also, the company
said it hasn't experienced a slowdown in business during the
current fiscal quarter.</p>
<p>Promus went down 2 3/4 to 23 1/8. C.J. Lawrence, Morgan
Grenfell lowered the stock's investment rating to "sell" from
"buy."</p>
<p>Loews, which posted a 41% drop in its second-quarter
earnings, fell 4 1/2 to 99 3/4.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.30
to 353.30. Volume totaled 10,880,000 shares.</p>
<p>Stevens Graphics Series A dropped 3 5/8 to 10 1/8. James
A. Cole resigned as the company's chief financial officer and
was succeeded by David H. Skinner, who previously held that
position at Sili-Tex.</p>
<p>Cubic rose 1 1/8 to 19 1/2. The company reported that net
income for the June quarter climbed 23% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Timberland Class A added 3/4 to 10 1/2 after the company
reported a profit for the second quarter, compared with a
year-ago loss.</p>
