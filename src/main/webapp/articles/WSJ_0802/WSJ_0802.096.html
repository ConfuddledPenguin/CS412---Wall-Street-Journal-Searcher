	<div class="article-body"><p>THE LEGEND OF THE GREAT missionary doctor Albert
Schweitzer lives on among a handful of U.S. surgeons who
spend time away from lucrative practices to bring modern
medicine to the Third World.</p>
<p>Calling their activities "Operation Smile," these doctors
volunteer their special skills to bring, quite literally,
smiles to the faces of their patients. Typical is Leonard
Sharzer, a 47-year-old plastic surgeon with a successful
Manhattan practice.</p>
<p>Dr. Sharzer routinely devotes a few hours each month to
providing free facial surgery for the indigent at a Bronx
hospital. But in October he led 35 other medical volunteers
to Kenya, where for three weeks he personally operated on 40
children, mostly to correct harelips and cleft palates. These
at-birth deformities, crevices in the lip or the roof of the
mouth, impede speech. They are routinely mended in the U.S.
before an infant is three months old; in poorer countries,
however, the congenital defects often remain untreated and
the afflicted may become social outcasts.</p>
<p>Dr. Sharzer first heard about Operation Smile last year
from a fellow physician, William Magee, at a medical-school
reunion. Dr. Magee, a plastic surgeon who spends 20 hours a
week on Smile despite a busy practice in Norfolk, Va., and
his wife, Kathy, who is a nurse, founded the nonprofit
organization in 1982. The Magees did so after participating
in a 1981 trip to the Philippines at the invitation of a
province there to operate on patients and teach local doctors
surgical techniques. The couple came away feeling overwhelmed
by the number of people needing their skills.</p>
<p>Smile teams have returned annually to the Philippines
since 1982. Other countries added since include Kenya,
Liberia and, last year, Vietnam. So far this year there have
been five missions; two more, to Kenya and Ghana, are
scheduled.</p>
<p>A total of about 4,000 operations have been done by the
teams since 1982. In addition to repairing harelips and cleft
palates, the teams remove tumors and rebuild limbs or facial
features deformed at birth or disfigured by disease or
accidents. "The goal is to restore human dignity," says Dr.
Magee. Operation Smile also brings some foreign patients to
the U.S. and provides free operations for needy U.S.
patients.</p>
<p>Operation Smile raises the $1.5 million it spends annually
from private donations and from 2,500 youths at 12 high
school and college "Happy Clubs," which raise funds through
car washes and benefit dances. It also has 11 chapters that
raise funds through special benefits. Three of these chapters
-- in Washington, New York and Cincinnati -- raise their own
separate funds for their trips. For example, Gerard Byrne,
publisher of Variety magazine and a prep school classmate of
Dr. Magee, is among the leaders of New York's current drive
to raise funds for a Smile mission to Vietnam in February.</p>
<p>Costs average about $100,000 a mission, excluding supplies
contributed by such companies as Johnson & Johnson and
reduced fares and free cargo space offered by Northwest
Airlines. Team members, who use vacation time to make the
trips, each contribute $250 toward their travel expenses. The
value of their professional time on each trip -- some 50
surgeons participate regularly -- is an estimated $5,000 to
$10,000 per doctor.</p>
<p>The pay: the smiles from their patients.</p>
