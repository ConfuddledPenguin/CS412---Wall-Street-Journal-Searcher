	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- The star, director and producers of the hit
science-fiction film "Aliens" filed suit against Twentieth
Century Fox Film Corp., charging that the movie company
didn't pay them their fair share of the profit.
   The suit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by
actress Sigourney Weaver, director James Cameron, producer
Gail Anne Hurd and executive producers Gordon Carroll, Walter
Hill and David Giler. They alleged that Fox failed to include
all the film's revenue in account statements and made
improper expense deductions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fox, a unit of Australia-based News Corp., also allegedly
set aside improper and excess reserves and provided
inaccurate accountings, the suit charged.</p>
<p>The complaint seeks unspecified damages, a judicial
determination that the film is now in net profit and an
accounting. Ms. Weaver claims she was to receive 10% of the
1986 film's net profit. "Aliens" was the sequel to the 1979
science fiction hit, "Alien," about monsters in deep space.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Fox said the company had no comment on the
suit.</p>
