	<p class="article-leader">Following is an editorial from last Friday's Bangkok Post.
It refers to the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting
held in Singapore earlier this week:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The chief subject of corridor discussions at a conference
in Singapore this weekend on the economy of Pacific nations
will focus on Southeast Asia's longest-running war without
bloodshed. Singapore's tireless dispute with the foreign
Press has escalated again. The government has barred
reporters from the region's two leading economic publications
from covering the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation
conference. By keeping away The Asian Wall Street Journal and
the Far Eastern Economic Review, Singapore has assured
diluting serious discussion about the region's economy.
Delegates, including senior regional and international
ministers, will be debating and discussing the Press ban.
Indeed, it will be a major topic when U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker meets Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
<p>From a simple assertion of government rights, Singapore's
unrelenting pursuit of certain media and correspondents has
intensified to this. With their circulations severely
restricted, the two publications are effectively barred from
the vast majority of the Singapore public and visitors to the
Republic. The issue has consumed a large amount of Mr. Lee's
time and that of his deputy and appointed successor Goh Chok
Tong. The hard-line, no-compromise stance of Mr. Lee's
government has made Singapore appear petty in the eyes of
many. These certainly include many executives who do business
in, or with, the island republic.</p>
<p>In all of this, the Press has become the underdog.
Predictably, it has gained much public sympathy, if not
outright support. By continuing its public battles with two
of the region's leading business publications, Singapore has
cast itself in the role of persecutor as well as prosecutor.
Neither of these is a role desirable for the Singapore
government in this instance.</p>
<p>It is possible, certainly, to consider Singapore's
position in the dispute. Mr. Lee and his government maintain
they have the right to bar access to reporters of media they
consider unfriendly. Of course they do. But the disputes in
these cases have sunk to making picayune and obscure points.
The fact is that neither publication, for example, has called
for the ouster of the Singapore Government, let alone its
overthrow. The full-page advertisement {a reprint of an
editorial that ran in the Asian Journal July 23 explaining
the company's position} in Tuesday's Asian Wall Street
Journal left many readers wondering how two eminently
sensible organizations -- the newspaper and the Singapore
Government -- could be reduced to such bickering.</p>
<p>They can be excused for asking if this is a tempest in a
teacup. Mr. Goh has made it clear that reporters from the
parent organizations of both publications may cover the
weekend conference. Only those employed specifically by their
Asian partners are banned. Thus, to many, it will seem that
there is neither a crime nor a punishment. The physical
barring of reporters is therefore more puzzling than ever.</p>
<p>The Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference is a
major international meeting. Current practice in almost every
country, and quite correctly so, is to allow the Press to
cover such meetings. Singapore neither helps its own case
nor, in the end, the publications it seeks to punish. By
barring serious economic reporters from a serious economic
conference, the Singapore Government succeeds only in
appearing oppressive, hardly the judgment it seeks. That the
outside world cares little about the specific reasons for
such action only further hurts Singapore's image.</p>
<p>Mr. Lee and Mr. Goh, both statesmen of the world class,
can perform better than this. Most governments in the world
have come to a truce, however uneasy, with foreign newsmen
without either giving up their own rights, or forcing
reporters to give up their claims to cover news as they and
their publications see fit. The Singapore Press dispute has
dragged on for years. Instead of seeking impossible redress
for events in a past long forgotten by the public, Singapore
might well consider calling a truce and looking to the future
in this matter. A fine, diplomatic beginning would be for
Singapore to make a quick reversal and allow reporters from
the two publications to attend this weekend's very important
meeting.</p>
