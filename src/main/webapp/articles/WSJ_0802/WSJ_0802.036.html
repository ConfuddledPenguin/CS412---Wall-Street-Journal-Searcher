	<p class="article-leader">LA JOLLA, Calif. -- Despite a restructuring plan and
management shake-up announced by Pic 'N' Save Corp., Girard
Partners L.P., an investor group controlled by David H.
Batchelder, said it will continue its battle for control.
   Girard, which holds 6.7% of the discount retailer's common
stock, said it will resume its solicitation of proxies to
elect its nominees to a majority of seats on the company's
board at the Aug. 29 annual meeting.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Girard also said that it intends to purchase additional
shares of Pic 'N' Save common in the open market and
privately negotiated transactions.</p>
<p>Some analysts think Mr. Batchelder's chances to win the
proxy fight aren't good. "Unless he comes up with a program
that is more attractive than management's, his chances are
slim," said Barry Rothberg, an analyst at Mabon, Nugent &
Co., a New York investment firm. "Management's restructuring
plan was reasonably well-received by investors."</p>
<p>Pic 'N' Save stock closed at $10.625 a share, up 62.5
cents, in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.</p>
<p>Pic 'N' Save, which specializes in close-out merchandise,
said Tuesday that it had been in discussions with Girard to
try to find a way to avoid resumption of a proxy fight but
that Girard's demands were unacceptable to the board. These
demands included a proposal for a "reconstituted board,"
according to the Girard SEC filing. Mr. Batchelder didn't
return a telephone call asking him what he thought of Pic 'N'
Save's new plan.</p>
<p>That plan would cut costs and resume a $60 million stock
buy-back program in an effort to placate shareholders. The
Dominguez, Calif., company also announced the resignation of
its chairman, president and chief executive officer, Lewis
Merrifield III, who had been under fire for increasing
expenses and overexpansion. The moves appeared to meet most
of the demands of the Batchelder group.</p>
<p>Mr. Batchelder, a former protege of T. Boone Pickens, the
Texas-based takeover specialist, still hasn't made a profit
on his investment in Pic 'N' Save. "His cost is $10.80 a
share and that doesn't include his legal, administrative and
proxy solicitation costs," Mr. Rothberg said.</p>
