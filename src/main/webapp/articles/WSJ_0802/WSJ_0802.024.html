	<p class="article-leader">CONCORD, Calif. -- Fibreboard Corp. said it decided
against selling its Northstar-at-Tahoe resort after an
18-month search failed to turn up a buyer at a satisfactory
price.
   The company announced plans in December 1988 to sell the
resort, located near Lake Tahoe in Northern Calif., as part
of a restructuring aimed at focusing itself on core wood
products and insulation businesses. The company said it
entered into "serious" talks with two buyers, both
foreign-based, but wasn't able to close the transaction.
Fibreboard carries the resort on its books at about $19
million; some analysts thought the company was hoping to
fetch double that price in a sale.</p>
