	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- National Heritage Inc. said it received from
LPIMC Inc. notices to terminate contracts under which it
manages 29 nursing homes and retirement centers owned by
LPIMC-controlled limited partnerships, and notices of default
on leases covering 14 LPIMC properties.
   The Dallas-based manager of long care facilities said it
is contesting the notices and is negotiating with LPIMC to
resolve the dispute. The contracts and leases continue in
force, National Heritage said.</p>
