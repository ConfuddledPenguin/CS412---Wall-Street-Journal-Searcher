	<p class="article-leader">More than one-third of patients afflicted with chronic
hepatitis B were treated successfully with Schering-Plough
Corp.'s version of interferon, a large team of medical
researchers reported.
   The report is the first time researchers have claimed
success in treating a form of hepatitis that afflicts about
5% of the world's population. It is the most serious form of
hepatitis in that many infected persons develop a chronic
form of hepatitis in which the virus continues to multiply in
the liver for years afterward, often leading to cirrhosis or
liver cancer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The researchers reported that daily injections of
interferon for 16 weeks stopped the hepatitis B virus from
multiplying in 40% of the patients who had suffered a chronic
state of active virus infection and hepatitis for as long as
seven years.</p>
<p>Most of the patients who were successfully treated
apparently became "silent" or inactive carriers of the
hepatitis B virus. But in 10% of the patients, most of whom
had had hepatitis B for less than two years, the interferon
treatment appeared to eliminate the virus, the researchers
reported.</p>
<p>"We can cure people who might otherwise have a lifelong
infection with serious consequences if we get to them early
enough," said Robert P. Perrillo, associate professor of
medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. Dr. Perrillo
headed the team of scientists from a dozen medical schools
and Schering-Plough who tested the interferon treatment.</p>
<p>Hepatitis B, once known as serum hepatitis, is transmitted
sexually, through contaminated needles, through blood
transfusions or from infected mother to child. It differs
from hepatitis A, which is usually transmitted in
sewage-contaminated food. In the U.S., hepatitis B afflicts
less than 1% of the population and is most often seen in
sexually promiscuous people, homosexual males, drug addicts,
health care workers and infants born to mothers who are
carriers. In parts of Africa and Asia, however, hepatitis B
afflicts and is carried by about 20% of the population.</p>
<p>The report, published in this week's issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine, is the second coup in as many
days for Schering-Plough's interferon alfa-2b, which it sells
under the brand name Intron A. Tuesday, an advisory group of
medical experts recommended that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration approve the company's request to sell Intron A
for the treatment of chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis, a
catchall designation for hepatitis in which blood tests fail
to detect the A or B virus.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said Schering-Plough applied to the
FDA last October for clearance to make claims that Intron A
was effective in hepatitis B but hasn't yet received such
approval. It took 13 months for the approval of Intron A's
use in non-A, non-B hepatitis.</p>
<p>The interferon treatment isn't cheap. The Schering-Plough
spokesman said that the average retail cost to the patient
would be about $5,000 for the full 16-week course of shots
used in the hepatitis B experiment.</p>
<p>Schering-Plough's interferon alfa-2b is one of two
genetically engineered interferons on the market. Roche
Holdings Ltd.'s Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., Nutley, N.J., sells
interferon alfa-2a, which has some slight molecular
differences from the Schering-Plough product. Both
interferons are sold for the treatment of a type of leukemia
and for the Kaposi's sarcoma cancer that hits many patients
with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</p>
<p>The tests of interferon alfa-2b in hepatitis B involved
169 patients who had had chronic hepatitis B for at least six
months. Because the outward clinical symptoms of the disease
vary widely from none to severe fatigue, the diagnosis of
hepatitis B was confirmed in liver biopsies and by blood
tests that indicated the virus was actively multiplying in
the liver.</p>
<p>In the experiment, 85 of the patients were taught to give
themselves daily shots of five million units of interferon
for 16 weeks. Periodic blood tests over the following months
indicated that in 31 of these patients, the virus had quit
multiplying in the liver. In addition, the blood tests on 10
of the patients indicated the virus had disappeared.</p>
<p>By contrast, of 43 patients whose daily shots were of a
placebo or inert substance, only three showed a spontaneous
loss of virus multiplication, and blood tests indicated all
continued to harbor the virus. Another set of 41 patients
received only one million units of interferon daily. In this
group the virus became inactive in seven and disappeared in
one patient.</p>
<p>Half of the patients receiving the maximum five million
units of interferon also had been pretreated with a steroid
hormone that had shown some benefit in other forms of
hepatitis. The steroid treatment, however, seemed to make
little difference in the overall results.</p>
<p>So far, only two patients have experienced a reactivation
of the virus, although the researchers cautioned that a
long-term follow-up is needed to determine the treatment's
efficacy and to find out whether it reduces the risk of
cirrhosis and liver cancer.</p>
<p>The major adverse effects of the interferon treatment were
changes in appetite, insomnia, acne and flu-like symptoms
such as fatigue, fever and headache.</p>
