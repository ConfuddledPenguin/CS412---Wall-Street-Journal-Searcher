	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Three new economic reports suggest the U.S.
economy remains stagnant.
   The Commerce Department said its index of leading economic
indicators was unchanged in June, following a roller-coaster
0.7% rise in May and a 0.2% drop in April. The department
also reported that spending on construction was virtually
unchanged during June. And the National Association of
Purchasing Management reported a sharp drop in its index of
manufacturing health for July.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest figures, which follow a string of anemic
economic indicators, fueled speculation among some economists
that the economy is headed for a downturn. "I expect a mild
recession to begin in the fourth quarter," said Chris
Varvares of Laurence H. Myer & Associates, an economic
research and consulting firm in St. Louis. Other analysts
predict the economy will escape recession, but remain very
sluggish.</p>
<p>Six of the 11 indicators in the Commerce Department's
forecasting index turned down in June. A drop in unfilled
manufacturers' orders contributed the biggest decline,
followed by a drop in the money supply.</p>
<p>Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said he was disturbed particularly by the decline in
new and unfilled orders for manufacturers goods. "This is
where we were hoping to have strength," he said.</p>
<p>Separately, the Commerce Department reported that new
construction reached an annual rate of $447.5 billion in May,
barely changed from $447.6 billion in June. An increase in
spending on office buildings during the month was offset by a
decline in spending on housing.</p>
<p>And in the first hint of the economy's health in July, the
National Association of Purchasing Management said its index
of factory health plunged to 47.4% in the month, from 51.1%
in June and 50.7% in May. The index largely reflected a
decline in orders for factory goods, which fell in July after
five straight monthly increases. According to the purchasing
managers, a reading below 50% indicates the manufacturing
economy is shrinking.</p>
<p>"The manufacturing economy started the third quarter
poorly, abruptly ending a three-month moderate, but solid,
increase in growth," said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the
group's survey committee and director of materials management
at Pitney Bowes Inc. "The weakness of new orders in July now
casts a shadow over the previous expectations for continued
growth in the economy."</p>
<p>The purchasing managers report showed that exports
continue to be the one bright sport in the economy. The new
export orders index rose to 57% in July from 56.5% in June.</p>
<p>The export figure isn't seasonally adjusted, but other
figures in the three reports are.</p>
<p>Here are the net contributions of the components of the
Commerce Department's index of leading indicators. After
various adjustments, the index was unchanged for June.</p>
<p>                                       June     May</p>

<p>Consumer expectations ............... -.10     -.17</p>
<p>The seasonally adjusted index numbers (1982=100) for June,
and the change from May, are:</p>
<p>Index of leading indicators ......... 146.0     .0</p>
<p>Index of coincident indicators ...... 134.3    -.1</p>
<p>Index of lagging indicators ......... 119.8     .2</p>
<p>The ratio of coincident to lagging indicators was 1.12, up
from 1.11 in May.</p>
<p>Here are the Commerce Department's figures for
construction spending in billions of dollars at seasonally
adjusted annual rates.</p>
