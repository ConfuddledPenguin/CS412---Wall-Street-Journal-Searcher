	<p class="article-leader">Divorce and Therapy
   Under the Same Roof</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>AN AUSTIN, Texas, law firm is offering divorce clients an
unusual fringe benefit: free group therapy sessions conducted
right in its office.</p>
<p>Boozer & Tull says the weekly meetings are designed to
focus attention on the anger and frustration that spouses
often bring to divorce cases. "We fix their legal problems,
but they go out the door worse off emotionally than they came
in," says Jennifer Tull, a lawyer with the firm.</p>
<p>Many law firms have working arrangements with
psychiatrists and psychologists, but in-house therapy
sessions are unusual. The voluntary meetings are conducted by
Larry Bugen, an Austin psychologist paid by Boozer & Tull on
a per-meeting basis.</p>
<p>The therapy could also aid lawyers -- by reducing the
threat of malpractice suits. "If clients are working out
their anger with a group, maybe they won't turn it on me,"
says Ms. Tull.</p>
<p>So far, one client group has gone through the eight-week
course of sessions, and Ms. Tull says the feedback is
positive. But Donn C. Fullenweider, president of the American
Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, is skeptical. The Houston
lawyer thinks psychiatry and law should be kept separate
because they have different goals and sometimes end up
providing conflicting advice. "When one overlaps the other,"
he says, "you're bound to have problems."</p>
<p>Testing the Limits</p>
<p>Of Lawyers' Ads</p>
<p>THE DEBATE over lawyers marketing their services on
television gets more fuel from a nationwide "advertising
cooperative."</p>
<p>The Personal Injury Trial Lawyers Association, based in
New Orleans, solicits lawyers to buy memberships in the
organization. In return, PITLA finances local, regional and
national television commercials promoting the use of member
lawyers. Members pay a monthly fee of $500 to $700, plus a
pro-rated share of the cost of producing the TV ads.</p>
<p>The commercials instruct potential claimants to call a
toll-free number. Staffers refer the callers to lawyers on a
rotating basis. Founded in 1986 by marketing executive G.
Lenn Brown, PITLA claims a 1990 TV ad budget of about $36
million, up $20 million from 1989. Its commercials, produced
by a New Orleans ad agency also founded by Mr. Brown, now run
in 230 cities in 49 states, he says.</p>
<p>The association doesn't advertise in Iowa because of the
state's tough advertising restrictions, Mr. Brown says. Carl
V. Nielsen, executive director of the Iowa Bar Association,
says lawyer advertising is permitted, but the bar doesn't
allow dramatizations, "And the people who do commercials
don't like that." PITLA ads sometimes use actors.</p>
<p>In March, Tennessee regulators blocked the association's
commercials, charging that the group is an unauthorized
lawyer referral service. The association sued, alleging
restraint of trade and First Amendment violations. The two
sides subsequently agreed the organization could air its
commercials while they try to work out a formal settlement.</p>
<p>The American Bar Association isn't taking a position on
the group, but it hears from skeptical lawyers each time
PITLA enters a new market. "I can almost gauge {their}
marketing efforts by the calls I get," says William Hornsby
of the ABA Commission on advertising.</p>
<p>More Companies Bitten</p>
<p>By `Cobra' Lawsuits</p>
<p>COMPANIES ARE facing more suits under a federal law
requiring companies to offer group health coverage to former
employees.</p>
<p>Enacted in 1986, a section of the Consolidated Omnibus
Budget Reconciliation Act, nicknamed Cobra, requires most
employers to let workers extend their health insurance for at
least 18 months after they have been terminated or have
voluntarily left their jobs.</p>
<p>But workers say some employers are not complying with the
law, and their complaints are beginning to reach the courts.
In the past year, the Labor Department sued Eastern Airlines
and Dayton Hudson, charging that they denied Cobra benefits
to employees. Both firms made concessions in settling the
cases without denying or admitting the allegations. Private
suits are pending in Texas, Florida and South Carolina.</p>
<p>Lawyers say some companies inadvertently fail to notify
employees of their Cobra rights because the law is complex
and relatively new. But other companies resist extending the
benefits because they fear it will drive up health-care
premiums.</p>
<p>The "big issue," says a Labor Department spokeswoman, is
whether an employee was properly informed of the right to
purchase extended coverage. Cobra requires employers to give
written notice of that right. Another disputed issue is when
an employee is considered to have been fired for "gross
misconduct." Such employees are exempt from Cobra benefits.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>NEW MEXICO'S bar association has formed a committee to
combat the image of lawyers as greedy and unethical. It isn't
easy. "The more you say, `I'm not a crook,' the more people
say you are," says committee member Randi McGinn of
Albuquerque. . . . A federal court in Lubbock, Texas, is
pondering whether cowspeak is a protected trademark. Yet
Inc., a restaurant operator, is trying to guard the "Mooo"
slogan it uses on "Mooonues," from which patrons order Mooo
meals. Yet Inc. sued the Western Sizzlin restaurant chain of
Dallas, charging that it misappropriated the trademark with
its own too-similar slogan: "Moo."</p>
