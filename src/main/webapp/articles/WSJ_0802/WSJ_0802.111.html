	<p class="article-leader">Contrary to your July 23 editorial "Singapore Scheme," the
Singapore government does not need the APEC {Asian-Pacific
Economic Cooperation group} conference to "legitimize" its
policy on foreign publications. It is Dow Jones that is
trying to use the conference and the presence of foreign
government ministers to pressure Singapore into lifting the
restrictions on The Asian Wall Street Journal and the Far
Eastern Economic Review.
   Our policy on foreign publications is a well-known and
longstanding one: Their circulation in Singapore is a
privilege, and not a right; they should not interfere in
Singapore's domestic politics; and they should be subject to
the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts. Karen Elliott
House, vice president/international of Dow Jones & Co., told
Goh Chok Tong {first deputy prime minister of Singapore} in
Washington, D.C., in April 1990, that Dow Jones had no
difficulty with these conditions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It follows from this policy that foreign correspondents
have no right to be stationed in Singapore. That an APEC
meeting is taking place does not entitle AWSJ and FEER
correspondents to enter Singapore. The government sees no
reason to grant this privilege to AWSJ and FEER, because they
have repeatedly engaged in domestic politics and taken on the
government. Ms. House acknowledged in a letter to Mr. Goh
that "our activities in Singapore are at the sufferance of
Singapore's constitution, laws and regulations."</p>
<p>More than 170 correspondents from international news
agencies and major foreign and regional newspapers and
magazines will be covering the APEC conference. They include
correspondents from AP-Dow Jones News Service and The Wall
Street Journal. Excluding FEER and AWSJ correspondents will
not in any way impair news coverage of any event in
Singapore, including the APEC conference.</p>
<p>The government restricted AWSJ's circulation for refusing
to publish official replies to a hostile article. AWSJ
challenged this in the Singapore High Court. The court ruled
against the AWSJ. Ms. House wrote to Mr. Goh that "we
recognize that Singapore's courts have held that The Asian
Wall Street Journal in 1986 engaged in the domestic politics
of Singapore. We have no further rights of appeal from that
decision; it is final, and we accept it as such." Why is AWSJ
still complaining?</p>
<p>As for the prime minister's libel suits brought against
FEER and AWSJ, if the courts find them unfounded, they will
dismiss them with costs against the prime minister. One case
has been decided against FEER. FEER has appealed, and the
Court of Appeal will decide. But when the judgment was
delivered, Dow Jones issued a statement suggesting that the
court was unfairly in favor of the prime minister. This
statement became the cause of the further actions.</p>
<p>We have never maintained that it was not open to Dow
Jones's lawyers to raise arguments in Singapore courtrooms,
claiming rights that amount to participating in domestic
politics as if their clients were Singapore citizens. It is
fully within the law for them to make these claims in their
defense of the action. Whether such claims are sustainable
will be decided by the courts. The question is: Do the
lawyers' claims represent Dow Jones's official position? If
they do, then what was the worth of Ms. House's assurances to
Mr. Goh, that "it is never our intent . . . to engage in
domestic politics"?</p>
<p>The editorial itself clearly shows Dow Jones's intent to
interfere. It criticizes the government for being "embroiled
not only with its natural political opponents, but also with
longtime associates," because it "engaged in a tiff with the
Catholic Church and exchanged unpleasantries with the Privy
Council," and for "heavy-handed efforts to stifle local
dissent and criticism." These are all internal actions and
policies. Foreign publications can report on them, but they
have no business taking sides for or against them.</p>
<p>If Dow Jones does not seek to interfere in Singapore
politics, why did it take advertising space in a Singapore
newspaper on July 30 to print in full this editorial,
attacking the Singapore government?</p>
<p>Until Dow Jones understands that its promise not to engage
in Singapore's domestic politics means not taking sides for
or against the government on Singapore's internal actions and
policies, the restrictions on AWSJ, FEER and their
correspondents will stay.</p>
