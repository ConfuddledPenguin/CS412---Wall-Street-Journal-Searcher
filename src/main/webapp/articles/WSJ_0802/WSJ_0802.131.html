	<p class="article-leader">FHP International Corp., a health maintenance organization
based in Fountain Valley, Calif., said earnings for its
fourth quarter, ended June 30, will be hurt by a recent $10
million jury verdict against it.
   In a medical malpractice suit, the jury awarded the
plaintiffs $10 million plus interest and costs, FHP said. As
a result, FHP will increase its malpractice reserves for
claims relating to the period 1975-83.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>FHP said its medical treatment was entirely appropriate in
this case and that it intends to request a new trial and to
seek a reduction of damages. If the requested relief isn't
granted, it will appeal.</p>
<p>The company said it hasn't determined the suit's exact
impact on earnings for the fourth quarter and the year. In
the year-earlier fourth quarter, FHP posted a $7.7 million
profit, or 65 cents a share, on revenue of $199.3 million.
For fiscal 1989, FHP reported net income of $22 million, or
$2.05, on revenue of $699.1 million.</p>
<p>The company declined to provide further details on the
malpractice case.</p>
