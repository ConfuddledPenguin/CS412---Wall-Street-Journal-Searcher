	<p class="article-leader">ROANOKE, Va. -- A group of private investors said they
agreed to buy Nautilus Sports/Medical Industries Inc. from
Travis Ward International Inc. for a price in excess of $14
million, according to a Nautilus spokesman.
   The investors include Dan Baldwin, former president and
chief executive officer of Nautilus; Charles Ho, owner, TKH
Holdings Ltd. in Sarasota, Fla,; Jim Patterson, Louisville,
Ky., founder of Rally's, Long John Silver's and Chi Chi's
restaurants; and Les Aberson, a Louisville attorney.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nautilus, a maker of exercise machinery, is based in
Dallas. The company's headquarters will be moved to
Independence, Va., the site of its manufacturing facility,
said John Urmston, chief operating officer.</p>
<p>Founded in 1970 by Arthur Jones, the company gained a
reputation as the premier producer of fitness equipment. In
the mid-1980s, however, sales began to slide, and Mr. Jones
sold the company to Travis Ward, a Dallas investor. Mr.
Urmston said current revenue and earnings figures for
Nautilus weren't available.</p>
