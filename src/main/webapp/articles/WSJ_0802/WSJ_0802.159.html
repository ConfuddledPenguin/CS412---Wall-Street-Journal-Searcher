	<p class="article-leader">Compaq Computer Corp. said it cut prices on its laptop
personal computers in a move to hold onto its commanding
share of the battery-powered lightweight models.
   Compaq dropped its suggested retail price by $500 and $800
on its LTE/286 models, and by $300 and $400 on its LTE
models. The Compaq PCs now list for prices ranging from
$1,999 to $3,999, compared with the previous range of $2,399
to $4,799. The Compaq models account for 65% of retail sales
of laptop computers, according to surveys by
Storeboard/Computer Intelligence, a market research firm.</p>

light as the Compaq models, said Eugene Glazer, an analyst
with Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>Compaq also cut prices on Advanced Graphics System
components.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Houston-based Compaq said it opened its 18th
sales subsidiary in Hong Kong to serve dealers in Hong Kong,
South Korea, mainland China and Taiwan. In the first half of
this year, Compaq sales abroad were larger than its sales in
North America.</p>
