	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Late in 1988, Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev was having lunch with President Reagan and
President-elect Bush and explaining the trouble facing him in
implementing his ambitious reforms. Finally, Mr. Bush spoke
up in a tough tone: What assurances could the Soviet leader
offer Americans that these reforms would succeed? Testily,
Mr. Gorbachev retorted: "Not even Jesus Christ knows the
answer to your question."
   It was the sort of tense exchange that had longed marked
U.S.-Soviet relations. Today, it shows how far the
Bush-Gorbachev personal relationship -- arguably the world's
most important -- has come. The relationship has moved,
sometimes fitfully, from wariness to warmth, and is now
probably the closest ever between a Soviet and an American
leader.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bush, who was initially a skeptic and who was accused
of dragging his feet in responding to Mr. Gorbachev, now is
an enthusiast criticized for growing too attached to him. Mr.
Gorbachev has evolved from a polemicist whose conversations
were colored by Communist ideology into a leader who recently
flew by helicopter over Washington's suburbs and peppered Mr.
Bush with questions about buying and selling houses in a
capitalist system.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal
about his relationship with the Soviet leader, talked of how
he and Mr. Gorbachev have used extensive personal
conversations, private correspondence and a process of sizing
up each other from afar to forge a cooperative relationship.
Among other things, Mr. Bush disclosed how the two leaders
exchanged private letters in 1989, setting the stage for
their future face-to-face meetings.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush says he slowly became a believer during 1989, as
he watched the Soviet leader let Eastern Europe peel away
from the Soviet empire. "I don't think I ever was down on
Gorbachev or negative about him," Mr. Bush said in the
interview. "But what I think has changed was the whole
Eastern European scene. And we had communications with him
during a lot of this period of change, quiet communications,
letters that we didn't feel inclined to discuss a lot. And I
think, from my standpoint, I saw a man who was trying very
hard to go forward with reform. And as one event after
another affirmed that, why more confidence grew up."</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev, in turn, appears to have become a believer
in Mr. Bush when, aboard a Soviet cruise ship off Malta last
December, the president plopped down a list of more than a
dozen steps he was willing to take to help close arms-control
deals with Moscow and pull the Kremlin into the world
economy. "I came knowing your support for perestroika, and I
was going to ask you for specifics," Mr. Gorbachev said,
according to American officials at the meeting. "Now you've
given them."</p>
<p>Today, U.S. officials claim that the trust the two have
developed was instrumental in Mr. Gorbachev's historic
announcement two weeks ago that he will accept a united
Germany inside the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p>
<p>At the Washington summit meeting two months ago, "we
talked in a wonderfully relaxed way" about Soviet fears that
a united Germany in NATO would threaten Moscow, Mr. Bush
says. He says he stressed that "we weren't interested in
having them worry all the time about a NATO aggression
against them . . . and I think he saw we were sincere about
it."</p>
<p>Skeptics, however, say the Soviets were persuaded much
more by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his potential
billions in aid than by Mr. Bush's sincerity.</p>
<p>More broadly, conservative critics charge that Mr. Bush
has tied American policy too closely to Mr. Gorbachev, whom
they consider an erratic and timid reformer. They argue that
Mr. Bush is closing the door to alternative leaders, such as
Boris Yeltsin, who would make more radical Western-style
reforms.</p>
<p>"We've thought for a long time that he was over-investing
in Gorbachev," says Frank Gaffney, a Reagan administration
Pentagon aide who now heads the Center for Security Policy, a
conservative think tank. "If anything, he is now helping to
prop up the principal figure in the Soviet Union who is
acting as a restraint on radical, fundamental reform there."</p>
<p>What's more, such critics complain, the president's ties
to Mr. Gorbachev have made it impossible for Mr. Bush to sell
his own defense budget in Congress, because lawmakers don't
sense a Soviet threat when leaders are so chummy.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush replies that he has little choice but to deal
with the Soviet leader he finds in power -- and that it is to
his benefit to build good working ties with whoever that is.
"He's the guy in charge, he's the guy I'll deal with," Mr.
Bush says. "When he's not sitting there I'll be dealing with
whoever is sitting in that chair."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush also indicates he is willing to open lines to
Gorbachev foes, noting that he just met with the prime
minister of the breakaway Baltic republic of Latvia. He says
he "undoubtedly" would be willing to meet with Gorbachev
opponents whenever he travels to Moscow for another summit.
(Tensions between Mr. Gorbachev and his opponents actually
may be easing; he and Mr. Yeltsin have formed a committee to
develop a common plan for further reforms of the Soviet
economy.)</p>
<p>There also seem to be distinct limits in the relationship
between Mr. Bush and the Soviet leader. Mr. Bush continues to
resist any direct U.S. financial aid for the gasping Soviet
economy, and American officials say Mr. Gorbachev hasn't
directly asked for any, perhaps fearing rejection.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Bush seems happy that it is Mr. Gorbachev he is
dealing with: "I must say I enjoy being with him and I
certainly don't dislike him," he says.</p>
<p>In the last eight months alone the two have held more than
20 hours of talks during two summits. And where personal
telephone conversations between superpower leaders once were
virtually unheard of, these two have talked by phone three
times this year already.</p>
<p>At first glance, it seems that there isn't much in common
between the 66-year-old Mr. Bush, a prudent leader who was
reared in well-manicured Greenwich, Conn., and the
59-year-old Mr. Gorbachev, a flamboyant risk-taker who hails
from the peasant farms of southern Russia.</p>
<p>Yet there are similarities. Both are called pragmatic, a
term neither regards as pejorative. And they share a
seemingly endless reservoir of nervous energy. "These are
compatible personalities in the sense that both are
high-energy people, restless," says national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft.</p>
<p>Interviews with a number of past and present U.S.
officials, as well as with Mr. Bush himself, indicate there
was little hint of the historic changes in store when the two
men were first introduced in 1985 at the funeral of
Konstantin Chernenko, Mr. Gorbachev's predecessor.</p>
<p>After the funeral, Vice President Bush met with the new
Soviet leader for half an hour in an elaborate, gilded
conference room in the Kremlin. Americans who attended the
meeting say that, aside from a vague comment about how the
"old powers" could no longer control other nations, Mr.
Gorbachev gave no sign of any plan for the sweeping
reconstruction of Soviet policy that was to unfold in the
next five years.</p>
<p>There was an inkling of the Gorbachev sense of humor, Mr.
Bush recalls, when his host rolled his eyes as a translator
seemed especially slow at one point. "He could also be tough
as hell, as I saw there," Mr. Bush says, and grew especially
agitated over U.S. questions about human rights inside the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p>When Mr. Gorbachev visited the U.S. for a 1987 summit
meeting, he showed his feel for American politics by
pointedly asking for a private meeting with then-candidate
George Bush. Then the Soviet leader displayed some political
showmanship of his own when, as the two were riding together
in a limousine through downtown Washington, he leapt out at a
street corner and began shaking hands.</p>
<p>"I thought, `Here's a guy that really likes the smell of
grease paint and the roar of the crowd. He's just like one of
us politicians,'" the president recalls.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush was president-elect the next time the two met,
when they had their tense exchange about Mr. Gorbachev's odds
for success. When Mr. Bush took office in 1989 a more serious
sizing up began -- and more tensions emerged.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush, voicing skepticism about the depth of change in
the Soviet Union, set out on a go-slow approach and ordered a
series of "policy reviews" on the situation. Mr. Gorbachev
grumbled to other leaders about Mr. Bush's caution.</p>
<p>But that began changing -- secretly -- in July 1989. Mr.
Bush paid a visit to Eastern Europe, where officials of the
newly democratic nations of Poland and Hungary sang Mr.
Gorbachev's praises and urged the U.S. to support him. So on
his way home from Europe, Mr. Bush sat down in Air Force One
and wrote a letter to Mr. Gorbachev suggesting an informal
get-together -- a suggestion that led to last December's
Malta summit.</p>
<p>There, Mr. Bush became a clear booster of perestroika, Mr.
Gorbachev's reform program. As he sat down at a table on the
Soviet cruise ship Gorky for a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev,
Mr. Bush laid out his two typewritten pages of proposals. For
the next hour, he sketched out a plan for closing a series of
arms-control deals, negotiating a new U.S.-Soviet trade
relationship and drawing the Soviets into the Western trade
and banking systems.</p>
<p>Though the Bush-Gorbachev relationship was beginning to
take shape, it didn't fully develop in Malta, for gale-force
winds cut short their time together. Moreover, a dispute
still festered over Soviet shipments to Cuba of arms that
were reportedly being transshipped to leftist rebels in El
Salvador. Then, soon after Malta, a serious storm cloud took
shape: Mr. Gorbachev imposed an economic stranglehold on
Lithuania, the first Soviet republic to seek independence.</p>
<p>With these tensions in mind, Mr. Bush plotted a way to
work on his personal chemistry with Mr. Gorbachev at this
spring's Washington summit: He insisted that one day be set
aside for private talks at Camp David.</p>
<p>The weighty issues of arms control and Germany were
handled in two days of Oval Office meetings. Mr. Bush heard
what he considered reassuring words about Lithuania. "We
talked at length about Lithuania and the Baltic States, and
his pointing out to me that, `Look, the constitution provides
for secession. . . . We've got the provisions for that. We
just want the law abided by.' Who would have thought a Soviet
leader would be talking like that, back when I first met
Gorbachev?" And, in perhaps the most notable sign of their
growing cooperation, Mr. Gorbachev, who is setting up a
powerful new presidency of his own, asked to send his top
aide to the White House for some organizational pointers. Mr.
Bush said yes.</p>
<p>Then the two boarded a helicopter and flew on a Saturday
morning to the seclusion of Camp David. Mr. Bush wasn't sure
the Soviet leader would warm to the idea. "We were told he
won't ride in a helicopter, certainly won't want to go for a
walk. He's a formal kind of guy," Mr. Bush says. "Next thing
you know we have our ties off and (are) sitting in a
beautiful setting and (going) for a walk on the trails
there."</p>
<p>For most of the day, both leaders sat at a round patio
table, aides at their side, and talked. They discussed
Afghanistan and the Middle East, and they sparred over Cuba.
Mr. Bush declared that relations between the U.S. and the
Soviet Union can't be "totally normal" until the Kremlin
stops providing $5 billion worth of aid annually to Fidel
Castro; Mr. Gorbachev talked only vaguely of putting
relations with Cuba on a "commercial basis" that would
curtail some subsidies. There was no solution, but Mr. Bush
says "I confidently expect" a change.</p>
<p>One incident during the retreat stands out in the minds of
American officials. At a break in the talks, Mr. Gorbachev
wandered off and came upon the pit where Mr. Bush indulges
his passion for pitching horseshoes. Mr. Gorbachev picked up
a horseshoe -- and threw a ringer. Mr. Bush, learning of the
episode, ordered aides to retrieve the horseshoe and mount it
on a plaque.</p>
<p>That night, at an informal dinner, Mr. Bush gave the
horseshoe to the Soviet leader. Mr. Gorbachev was moved and
responded with an emotional speech of thanks that drew on the
meaning of a horseshoe as a good-luck symbol in Russian as
well as American culture. "I hope this means good luck on my
house and good luck on your houses, good luck on your people
and good luck on my people," he said.</p>
