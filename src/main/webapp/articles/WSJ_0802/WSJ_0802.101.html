	<p class="article-leader">Gloomy economic tidings sent investors shopping for bonds,
gold and utility stocks.
   But fears of weakening corporate profits helped depress
the Dow Jones Industrial Average 5.94 points to 2899.26.
Several broader market indexes also fell slightly.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the foreign-exchange market, the dollar pulled out of
its recent tailspin, climbing sharply against the mark. The
dollar also rose against the British pound but managed only a
small gain against the Japanese yen. Several traders predict
the dollar will resume declining because they expect interest
rates to climb overseas and to ease in the U.S.</p>
<p>Speculation about lower U.S. rates intensified early
yesterday after the National Association of Purchasing
Management's report for July showed more economic weakness
than analysts had expected. That report "heightened prospects
for lower interest rates" but also "depressed expectations
for corporate profits," said A.C. Moore, research director at
Argus Research Corp.</p>
<p>"All year, this market has been a tug of war between
disappointing earnings, which are bad for stocks, and
declining interest rates, which are good for stocks," said
Byron Wien, investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. "Right
now, the focus of the market is more on earnings than it is
on rates."</p>
<p>Treasury bond prices advanced more than 5/8 point, or
about $6.25 for each $1,000 face amount, even as the
government disclosed plans to sell a record $32.25 billion of
new notes and bonds next week. The timing of the auctions
depends on when Congress raises the nation's debt ceiling.</p>
<p>While stock prices generally slumped, utility stocks
continued to attract investors because utilities are big
borrowers and especially sensitive to interest rate changes.
The Dow Jones Utilities Average rose 2.89 points yesterday to
212.90, which many traders interpret as signaling lower
interest rates ahead.</p>
<p>Gold prices have rebounded recently after a deep slump
earlier this year. Traders attribute the turnaround partly to
Middle East tensions, the dollar's recent weakness, and the
U.S. economy's growing sluggishness. Some analysts also cite
growing prospects for another credit-easing move by the
Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>In major market activity:</p>
<p>Stock prices fell. Declining issues outnumbered advancers
by 777 to 733 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Bond prices rose. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond fell to 8.35% from 8.41%.</p>
<p>The dollar rebounded. In late New York trading yesterday,
the dollar was quoted at 147.18 yen, up from 145.80 yen late
Tuesday, and at 1.5885 marks, up from 1.5869 marks.</p>
