	<p class="article-leader">The stock market's retreat from record territory has left
many investors hungry for clues: Is this just a pause in a
continuing upward climb, or are stock prices really in for a
slide?
   No one can say for sure, of course, but this could be a
good time to step back from the market's day-to-day gyrations
and take a look at some widely watched indicators. These
measures -- financial ratios, trading patterns and the like
-- have traditionally been viewed as stock-market signposts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The gauges aren't perfect. Market professionals frequently
disagree on how to interpret a particular reading. And many
of the indicators are "far from reliable," said Alfred
Goldman, director of market analysis for A.G. Edwards & Sons
in St. Louis.</p>
<p>Still, the indicators can be useful in evaluating the
market in light of longer-term trends. While these measures
won't tell what stock prices are going to do tomorrow, they
may help investors cut back their stock holdings when the
market is vulnerable and increase their exposure when the
risks are lower. The whole idea is to "play the
probabilities," said Gerald Perritt, a Chicago newsletter
editor and money manager.</p>
<p>Here's a guide to four popular indicators that several
analysts say are now flashing caution signals:</p>
<p>PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO: This common ratio for evaluating
whether an individual stock is cheap or expensive is also
applied to the broader market. The current level of a market
index, typically the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, is
divided by the past 12 months' per-share earnings of the
companies in the index. A high market P-E means stocks are
highly priced relative to corporate earnings and, thus,
possibly poised for a tumble. Investors can keep an eye on
the P-E for the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average
in this newspaper each Monday.</p>
<p>At the moment, the P-E for the S&P 500 is about 16. While
that's still well below the P-E ratios of 20 or more that
have often preceded major declines, it is above the long-term
average of about 13. And it is far higher than the P-Es of 7
or 8 that have often accompanied market troughs.</p>
<p>When the ratio exceeds 15, the stock market "is starting
to get pricey," said Arnold Kaufman, editor of Outlook, a
newsletter published by Standard & Poor's Corp. That's
particularly true when corporate-earnings prospects are less
than robust, as they are now, he said. "You don't want to
bail out at these levels, but you do want to keep an eye on
developments."</p>
<p>DIVIDEND YIELD: Another way analysts gauge the
reasonableness of stock prices is by comparing prices to the
dividend income stockholders receive. The key figure is the
"dividend yield" of the S&P 500, the annualized dividend
income provided by the underlying stocks as a percentage of
the index level. The S&P-500 yield is also published in this
newspaper on Mondays.</p>
<p>The current S&P yield is about 3.4%. Like the market P-E,
that's a lot closer to a sell signal than it is to a buy
sign. "Whenever that thing has gone below 3%, the market has
invariably sold off," said Mr. Perritt, the Chicago editor
and money manager. The last time was in 1987.</p>
<p>The indicator has averaged about 4.5% over the past
several decades. A dividend yield of 5% or 6% is generally
considered a buying opportunity.</p>
<p>Mr. Perritt said the current dividend yield is giving the
same message as the market P-E: "There is not huge cause for
concern, but the market may be topping." He has been advising
investors to pare back their stock-market exposure. But he
also notes that stocks have sometimes traded at clearly
"overvalued" levels for an extended period before falling.</p>
<p>MARKET BREADTH: You could call this one "the Dow Jones
Industrial Average vs. the rest of the stock-market world."
Various ways to measure "breadth" show that the climb in the
30-stock Dow Jones average over the past year wasn't
accompanied by a comparable advance in the broader stock
market.</p>
<p>That lack of breadth "is a classic warning sign," said Mr.
Goldman of A.G. Edwards. "Either the broad market pulls those
selected winners down, or the generals pull the troops up.
What usually happens is the broad market wins."</p>
<p>One of the easiest ways for investors to monitor breadth
is to compare the percentage changes over time of various
market indexes. While the Dow Jones average has climbed 10%
over the past 12 months, the S&P 500 has advanced only 3.6%,
and the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks has
declined 3.3%.</p>
<p>Market analysts mostly focus on the divergence between the
Dow and the "advance-decline line" for issues traded on the
New York Stock Exchange. Despite a rally this spring, that
measure is down from a year ago. That says the daily declines
in individual Big Board stocks have outnumbered the gains
over the past year.</p>
<p>Investors can easily chart the advance-decline line:
Subtract today's declining issues from advancing ones to get
a net change. Starting with any base number, add or subtract
the change; repeat daily.</p>
<p>TRADING VOLUME: "Volume tells you the conviction behind a
move," said Gail Dudack, a market analyst at S.G. Warburg &
Co. And as the Dow climbed toward 3000, she said, "volume was
not convincing."</p>
<p>Ms. Dudack said she would be more bullish about the Dow if
daily trading volume on the Big Board had remained
consistently above 200 million shares as the average made its
recent move from 2900 toward 3000. "We had a couple of good
volume days," she said, "but it wasn't sustained."</p>
<p>Robert Farrell, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch &
Co., said this is the first time since 1972, a cyclical peak
in stock prices, that record prices haven't been "confirmed"
by record trading volume. He focuses on the month-by-month
averages of daily volume on the New York exchange. The figure
was 154 million shares in June, the most recent month for
which data is available; that's also about the average for
the first half of the year.</p>
<p>In contrast, the average daily trading volume was 193
million shares in August 1987, and it was 180 million or more
for several months that year.</p>
