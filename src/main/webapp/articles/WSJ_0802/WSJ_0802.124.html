	<p class="article-leader">Abbey National PLC posted a 38% rise in first-half pretax
profit to #280 million ($522 million) from #203 million a
year earlier.
   Profit at Abbey National, which converted in early 1989 to
a commercial banking concern from a building society,
generally was in line with analysts' forecasts.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bank said in a statement, "The first half has been
satisfactory, but we continue to be cautious about the second
half." It said that because there is no sign yet of U.K.
interest rates starting to fall, Britain's housing market
probably will remain under pressure. "Continuing competitive
pressure on margins" will also mean that "caution is the
order of the day," the company said.</p>
