	<p class="article-leader">International Business Machines Corp. said it will set up
its office products business as a separate operation,
preparing the way for its sale to Clayton & Dubilier in a
leveraged buy-out.
   Although financial details weren't disclosed, industry
executives estimated the price at nearly $2.3 billion --
roughly in line with earlier reports that IBM planned to sell
the business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the business is of modest size by the computer
giant's standards, the typewriter, keyboard, printer and
office-supply operations being spun off would fit in the top
half of the Fortune 500 list, with revenue of $2.5 billion to
$3 billion. Their disposal will enable IBM, which had 1989
revenue of about $63 billion, to cut its head count by nearly
6,000 -- with roughly 5,000 people moving to the new company
and 1,200 jobs being eliminated.</p>
<p>Those cuts indicate that IBM is increasingly serious about
trimming costs and employees in order to focus on its core
computer business. It has already cut employment by about
30,000 in recent years to fewer than 380,000 people, but this
is the first time IBM has disposed of a business such as
typewriters that has been so central to its history.</p>
<p>In the process, IBM is tacitly acknowledging that it isn't
as efficient a manufacturer as it thought it was. It had
spent $350 million in the mid-1980s to modernize the facility
in Lexington, Ky., where most of these products are made and
had held up the plant as an example of how U.S. companies
could match Japanese manufacturing expertise. But industry
executives said that a recent study by IBM found that it
still couldn't make products as cheaply as competitors. While
profitable, the businesses don't generate the returns that
IBM gets on its computer lines and aren't considered
strategic so IBM decided to dispense with them.</p>
<p>IBM, in Armonk, N.Y., said it won't take a charge related
to the job reductions, because it already allowed for this
possibility as part of a $2.4 billion write-down it took in
the 1989 fourth quarter. It indicated it could eventually
have a gain related to the sale but wouldn't break it out as
a separate item and said any gain wouldn't be material.</p>
<p>In the absence of any clear effect on IBM financial
statements, IBM's stock price moved little; it closed at
$111.625, up 12.5 cents, in composite trading on the New York
Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>IBM was vague on many details of its plans, saying it had
signed only preliminary agreements with Clayton & Dubilier.
IBM said it is setting up its U.S. office products operations
as a separate business and hopes to sell a majority stake to
Clayton & Dubilier. IBM also said it is considering including
its overseas office products operations in the new company.
IBM said it will retain some equity in the business, but
didn't specify the amount or say what it expected to be paid
for the rest of the business.</p>
<p>Industry executives said they expect IBM to keep a 15% to
20% stake in the new company, with Clayton & Dubilier
acquiring the rest. Clayton & Dubilier would then allocate
15% of the equity to the new company's employees and top
management, led by IBM vice president Marvin Mann, who will
become the new company's chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Most buy-outs concentrate equity ownership in the hands of
a few top executives. The proposed IBM deal, however, would
give stock-appreciation rights to all employees of the new
company. That would give them at least a small share of
whatever profits the buy-out eventually yields.</p>
<p>IBM said it will try to get 1,200 people to quit their
jobs in Lexington by offering incentives to the 4,400 people
there who are involved in the office products businesses --
roughly 1,000 at the site are involved in other businesses
and aren't affected. The incentives are similar to ones IBM
has offered in the past and are generous -- as much as two
years' salary plus $25,000 and continuation of some benefits.</p>
<p>As often happens these days with IBM battling to break out
of a five-year earnings lull, the job cuts raised concerns
that IBM was shedding its tradition of no layoffs. But an IBM
spokesman said no one will be forced to quit. He said the new
company is expected to maintain IBM's values, presumably
meaning that layoffs would be a last resort, if any are ever
ordered.</p>
<p>IBM said 200 to 250 people in Boulder, Colo., also will be
assigned to the new company. The rest of the 5,000 people in
the new company will come from overseas and from hiring that
will be done to beef up marketing.</p>
<p>IBM will be by far the biggest customer for the new
company and will sell the midrange printers under its own
name. The new company also will be able to use the IBM logo
on its products, although that right will be phased out in
coming years as the new company begins to use its own
name-which has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>IBM has made similar arrangements in recent years as it
has tried to become more focused. Last year, it sold most of
its large Rolm telecommunications business to Siemens AG of
West Germany, and just in the past month it announced a plan
to sell most of its automated-teller-machine business into a
joint venture with Diebold Inc.</p>
<p>The office products spinoff "is just, I think, an
extension of the kinds of things we've been doing," IBM
Chairman John F. Akers said in an interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Akers said IBM will continue to keep the pressure on
costs because the market is so competitive, but added that
"we're very encouraged by the results we've had so far" this
year. "We're performing as we've expected to perform."</p>
