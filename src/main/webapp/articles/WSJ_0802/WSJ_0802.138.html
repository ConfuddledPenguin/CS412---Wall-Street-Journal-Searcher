	<p class="article-leader">McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it filed a shelf registration
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $1.15 billion
in senior and/or subordinated debt securities.
   Including the unissued portion of an earlier shelf
registration, the St. Louis-based defense contractor said it
will be able to issue up to a total of $1.5 billion in senior
and/or subordinated debt securities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The aerospace concern said it intends to use the net
proceeds from the sale of securities to finance inventories,
provide other working capital, repay debt and for general
corporate purposes.</p>
<p>Last week, Standard & Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors
Service Inc. each lowered their ratings on debt of McDonnell
Douglas, citing its weakened financial condition and the
troubles it is having with military programs, such as cost
overruns on the Navy's A-12 attack plane. According to S&P,
total debt of McDonnell Douglas and its finance unit is $5.2
billion.</p>
