	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and two
regional Bell companies plan to develop a radio technology
that could significantly boost the capacity of cellular radio
systems, the companies said.
   AT&T has signed an agreement with Qualcomm Inc., a San
Diego company that pioneered the Code Division Multiple
Access, or CDMA, technology for use in cellular radio
systems. Nynex Corp. and Chicago-based Ameritech plan to
install the systems in their networks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plan by three of the industry's biggest players to
develop and use the technology is significant because their
approval could help make it a standard for the cellular
industry and so-called personal communications services of
the future.</p>
<p>Personal communications service networks, as envisioned by
the telecommunications industry, will allow millions of
customers to carry lightweight, pocket-sized phones by the
end of this century. But the networks will require enormous
transmission capacity -- many times greater than conventional
cellular telephone networks. In several major cities,
including New York and Los Angeles, these cellular networks
are suffering increasingly from capacity shortages.</p>
<p>CDMA systems are said to offer up to 20 times more
call-handling capacity than the conventional cellular
systems. The CDMA systems assign a special electronic code to
each call signal, allowing more calls to occupy the same
space and be spread over an entire frequency band. By
contrast, the current standard for future digital systems,
time-division multiple access, or TDMA, offers three-to-seven
times the capacity of existing systems and works by placing
each call signal into a time slot and transmitting it within
a single frequency.</p>
<p>"We are launching the next-generation digital cellular
technology," said Allen Salmasi, vice president of planning
and development at Qualcomm. "Basically these agreements will
put us on the map as a major supplier of CDMA equipment for
the cellular industry." AT&T declined to comment on the
agreement.</p>
<p>Nynex Mobile Communications Co., which has the more
ambitious plan of the two regional phone companies, said that
late next year in New York City it will roll out the nation's
first wireless personal telephone service. The company plans
to start out small with one new switch in Manhattan.
Yesterday, it announced a multimillion-dollar agreement to
buy the cellular switching gear from AT&T for an undisclosed
amount.</p>
<p>Nynex also said it agreed to buy $3 million of digital
telephone handsets from Qualcomm to sell to its customers.
The phones are expected to be smaller, lighter and cheaper
than most existing cellular phones.</p>
<p>Nynex Mobile, which will use frequencies already assigned
to it for cellular telephone transmissions, conducted a trial
of the new technology from February to June, and was
enthusiastic.</p>
<p>"For densely populated areas like New York, personal
telephone service will offer consumers the most flexible,
portable and practical personal communications system
available," said Robert Keller, Nynex Mobile's chief
operating officer. "When PTS is introduced next year, a
telephone number will no longer represent a place, but
rather, a person."</p>
<p>Like conventional cellular service, personal telephone
service will connect with the phone system through radio
antennae. However, the antennae will be smaller. Dubbed
microcells, the antennae will be connected to a digital
network that uses the CDMA technology, which assigns to each
call a distinct code that the network can sort. That allows
many calls to be transmitted on the same frequency, with each
call remaining discrete.</p>
<p>Ameritech Mobile Communications said it will be studying
the benefits of CDMA technology but during the evaluation
period still supports the current TDMA standard.</p>
<p>"It is critical that we select the appropriate technology
to meet customer needs while optimizing that very valuable
resource called radio spectrum," said Roger Pachuta,
Ameritech Mobile's vice president of network and customer
services.</p>
