	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Aur Resources Inc. said it reached a settlement
in a legal dispute over the ownership of a large copper and
zinc deposit it discovered in northern Quebec.
   The agreement, reached between Aur, its partner Louvem
Inc. and Louvem's parent, St. Genevieve Resources Inc., gives
Aur a 60% stake in the deposit, called the Louvicourt
property, hailed as one of the largest base metals
discoveries in Canada in recent years. Louvem will own the
remaining 40% of the property.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Louvem agreed to transfer a 10% working interest in the
Louvicourt property to Aur in exchange for five million
Canadian dollars (US$4.3 million) and a 2.5% interest in the
deposit's net profits. Aur agreed to pay a further C$7
million to Louvem, half when commercial production at the
property reaches a level of 10,000 tons a day and the
remainder on the first anniversary of that date.</p>
<p>The companies said the settlement is conditional on
approval required by Louvem and St. Genevieve from a Noranda
Inc. unit, or on Noranda and St. Genevieve holding a combined
interest of less than 50% of Louvem. Noranda holds a 22%
stake in Louvem and 19% of St. Genevieve, which in turns owns
56% of Louvem.</p>
<p>St. Genevieve said it advised Noranda of its plan to sell
up to 4.1 million Louvem shares at C$8 each. If Noranda
doesn't exercise its right of first refusal to buy those
shares, and enough are sold to reduce the combined holdings
of the two companies in Louvem below the 50% threshold, the
agreement will take effect.</p>
