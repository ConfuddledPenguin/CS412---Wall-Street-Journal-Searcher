	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Researchers here found antibiotic-resistant
bacteria in almost all infants they studied in two developing
countries, suggesting that such bacteria have become a major
public health threat world-wide.
   However, only about half of U.S. infants they studied
carried such bacteria -- a surprisingly low prevalence,
considering the heavy U.S. use of antibiotics. The finding
offers new hope for the fight against antibiotic-resistant
bacteria in the developed world, said Thomas F. O'Brien, a
co-author of the study and a physician at Boston's Brigham
and Women's Hospital.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Doctors are increasingly alarmed about the proliferation
of disease-causing bacteria that resist antibiotics. When
patients take antibiotics, their internal microbes
susceptible to the drugs die off. But if resistant strains of
bacteria are present, they quickly grow like weeds in a newly
cleared field. Thus, the more antibiotics used, the more
antibiotic-resistant bacteria there are. And once a resistant
strain arises, it can travel fast -- penicillin-resistant
gonorrhea bacteria, for example, have spread internationally
in recent years.</p>
<p>Moreover, scientists have discovered that genes conferring
resistance can move from one strain of bacteria to another.
That means antibiotics are turning benign bacteria that exist
in all animals' intestines into reservoirs of
antibiotic-resistant genes. Such genes can later be
transferred to disease-causing bacteria with devastating
results.</p>
<p>In their study, published in today's issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine, the Boston researchers found
that more than 95% of healthy infants they surveyed in
Caracas, Venezuela, and in Qin Pu, China, carried at least
one strain of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in their
intestines. Some of the infants never had been given
antibiotics, an indication that resistant bacteria are
ubiquitous in the infants' environments and infect them soon
after birth.</p>
<p>Heavy, indiscriminate use of antibiotics in the Third
World probably accounts for the finding, said Dr. O'Brien.
One reason is poor sanitation, causing high rates of
infectious disease. Moreover, "in the developing world, it's
a big event to go to the doctor," he said. "Consumers are
very oriented to coming home with something to take," which
typically is an antibiotic. And if they can't afford to visit
a doctor, Third World consumers often get antibiotics from
pharmacists or street vendors, Dr. O'Brien said.</p>
<p>The drugs also are used heavily in the developed world --
accounting for around 35% of drug prescriptions for U.S.
children under the age of three in 1986, according to one
study.</p>
<p>But U.S. doctors typically use them selectively.
Laboratory tests on their patients can tell them which
antibiotic, if any, will best kill the infecting bacteria.
Thus, "we don't so often get the situation where people are
banging away at a bacteria with an antibiotic until a
resistant strain emerges," said Dr. O'Brien.</p>
<p>When such strains do emerge, U.S. doctors respond with
newer -- and usually costlier -- antibiotics that haven't yet
spawned bacteria immune to them. But now, "multiresistant"
bacteria, which are immune to different antibiotics, are
emerging. More than half of the resistant bacteria found in
babies the Boston researchers studied -- including the U.S.
ones -- were immune to more than one antibiotic.</p>
<p>Still, the fact that perhaps half of U.S. infants begin
life without resistant bacteria suggests that many people,
with a little care, could avoid such microbes, said Dr.
O'Brien. For instance, he said, consumers should avoid taking
unneeded antibiotics. And they shouldn't chop meat, which
might contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria, on surfaces used
to prepare salads.</p>
