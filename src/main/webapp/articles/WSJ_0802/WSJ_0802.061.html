	<p class="article-leader">NATIONAL HEALTH LABORATORIES Inc., a subsidiary of Revlon
Inc., said it began the public sale of 13 million shares of
its common stock at $13.25 each. The company said an
additional 1.8 million shares would be offered for sale
subject to underwriters' over-allotment options. The public
offering, which was announced last month, would boost the
percentage of stock traded publicly to 20% from 5% if all the
shares are sold. Consequently Revlon's stake in the La Jolla,
Calif., medical testing concern would shrink to 80% from 95%.
Proceeds from the sale are expected to help Revlon's owner,
Ronald Perelman, repay bank debt and help enhance the value
of Revlon's assets. In national over-the-counter trading
yesterday, National Health closed at $13.125, down 12.5
cents.</p>
