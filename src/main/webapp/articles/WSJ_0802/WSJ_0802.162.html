	<p class="article-leader">Briggs & Stratton Corp.'s net income reached $7.7 million
in the fiscal fourth quarter, or 54 cents a share, after a
year-earlier loss of $25.1 million, equal to $1.74 a share.
   The Milwaukee maker of light engines said sales in the
quarter ended June 30 increased 34% to $255.7 million from
$190.5 million a year earlier. The company said the spring
lawn-and-garden selling season "was a pretty good one."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the fiscal year, profit hit a seven-year high of $35.4
million, or $2.45 a share, a substantial turnaround from the
previous year's $20 million loss, equal to $1.39 a share.
Sales rose 14% to $1 billion from $876.4 million, aided by a
19% rise in unit shipments of engines.</p>
<p>Discussing fiscal 1991, officials said they believe
engine-unit shipments and sales "will be a bit lower." But
they added that the company "will be working to achieve
modestly higher earnings."</p>
