	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Kidder, Peabody & Co. named a new head of its
national sales force to jumpstart its strategy of focusing on
wealthy individuals, small companies and small institutions.
   The General Electric Co. unit named managing director
Michael A.M. Keehner to succeed Charles V. Sheehan in
overseeing Kidder's 45 branches that cater to individual
investors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an interview, Mr. Keehner said he hopes to be "getting
our people better focused" and help the sales force better
target wealthy markets with the proper resources and support.</p>
<p>The 47-year-old Mr. Keehner, currently chairman of Kidder,
Peabody International Ltd., has never been a broker. But he
has held a variety of management positions at the firm. Among
other things, he has headed Kidder's asset finance group, and
was president and chief executive officer of the firm's
exploration and production subsidiary from 1982 to 1988. He
also was chairman of Kidder Peabody Realty.</p>
<p>Kidder, which has 1,400 brokers, has never been a major
force in the retail-investor market. But it recently has been
trying to carve out a niche in focusing on the higher end of
the individual-investor market, to separate itself from big
retail firms such as Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>In a statement, Michael A. Carpenter, Kidder's chairman
and chief executive, cited the "depth of his management
experience across many areas of the firm and his strategic
capabilities."</p>
<p>Mr. Keehner will assume his new duties at the end of the
year, when Mr. Sheehan retires.</p>
