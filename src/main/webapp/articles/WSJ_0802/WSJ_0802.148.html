	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Operations were halted yesterday at two of
Canada's largest steel producers as about 16,000 union
members began striking following a breakdown of contract
talks.
   The shutdowns at Stelco Inc. and Algoma Steel Corp., a
subsidiary of Dofasco Inc., come as Canada's steel industry
is under pressure from a slowing domestic economy and
increased penetration of the Canadian market by U.S.
steelmakers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Leo Gerard, director of District Six of the United
Steelworkers of America, said the union, which represents
about 10,000 workers at Toronto-based Stelco, rejected what
the company has called its final contract offer, proposing
wage increases of about 2.5% in each year of a three-year
pact. The union is seeking a higher wage settlement and
better protection against inflation for workers and
pensioners.</p>
<p>At Algoma, where the union represents about 6,000 workers,
monetary issues haven't been broached, Mr. Gerard said. Talks
with the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario-based company broke down
over language concerning the contracting-out of work.</p>
<p>Officials at both companies said an orderly shutdown of
operations had been underway for several days in anticipation
of a strike. Fred Telmer, president of Stelco's steel
division, said inventory stockpiles have been transferred to
customers. Mr. Telmer added, "We're in a closed mode."</p>
