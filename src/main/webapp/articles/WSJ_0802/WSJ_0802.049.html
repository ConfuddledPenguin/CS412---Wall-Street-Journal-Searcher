	<p class="article-leader">MONTREAL -- Canadian production of market pulp in June
dropped 15% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at
80% of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 500,000 metric tons of
market pulp in June, compared with 590,000 tons a year
earlier. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The June operating rate of 80% was down from 85% in May
and from 96% a year earlier.</p>
<p>For the six months through June, Canadian mills produced
3,251,000 metric tons of market pulp, a 9.1% decline from
3,578,000 tons a year earlier. The industry operated at 86%
of capacity in the first half, down from 97% a year earlier.</p>
