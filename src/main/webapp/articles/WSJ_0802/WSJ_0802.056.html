	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- After decades of collecting dust in storage,
some 1,000 items of Coke memorabilia go on display tomorrow
in a new museum here. On one wall, a 1908 ad shows that, even
before Maxwell House, Coca-Cola was "Good to the Last Drop."
Nearby, another turn-of-the century ad pitches the
short-lived Coca-Cola cigars.
   Coke estimates that as many as half-a-million people a
year will spin the turnstiles at the World of Coca-Cola, its
three-story, $15 million monument to itself.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Coca-Cola Co. museum is the latest -- and perhaps most
ambitious -- example of the growing use of corporate
historical exhibits as promotional tools. Seeking fresh ways
to reach an advertising-bombarded public, companies are
converting themselves into nothing less than tourist
attractions through a confluence of marketing, education and
entertainment.</p>
<p>"People are beginning again to use their plants, factories
and headquarters as sales tools," says Bruce Weindruch,
founder of the History Factory in Washington, which
chronicles corporate histories and designs documentaries and
exhibits. Even though corporate museums are "blatant
advertising," adds Felice Jo Lamden of Lynch Museum Services,
a Pennsauken, N.J., consultant, "It is more palatable because
it is educational."</p>
<p>Corporate museums aren't new, of course. Hershey Foods
Corp., Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. and Anheuser-Busch Cos.,
among others, have had popular museums or tours for decades.
There has been a bit of a reversal on plant tours, however,
as worries about legal liabilities and industrial espionage
led to closings of tours by companies like Gerber Products
Co. this year, and Kellogg Co. four years ago.</p>
<p>Quantifying the current trend is difficult, but clearly
the interest level has grown recently. So far this year, the
History Factory has designed five major corporate exhibits --
the most in any of its 10 years. In February, more than 100
people from a variety of companies attended a business-museum
conference in Wilmington, Del., titled "Selling History? How
and Why Corporations Interpret the Past." And, responding to
demand, Victor Danilov, a retired president of Chicago's
Museum of Science and Industry, next year expects to publish
a how-to book on designing corporate museums.</p>
<p>Later this year, Motorola Inc. will parade employees,
suppliers and schoolchildren through an immense museum that
will chronicle its decades of developing radios, TVs and
semiconductor chips. At the historical society museum in
York, Pa., tourists can find a century's worth of Pfaltzgraff
Co.'s pottery products in an exhibition hall, titled
"Pfaltzgraff, America's Potter." At its headquarters in New
York, Sterling Drug Inc. just opened an exhibit on its
history, which includes a 1918 box of Bayer aspirin powder.</p>
<p>And since late last year, 11 American Security Bank
branches in the Washington, D.C., area have had indoor
exhibits tying the history of each branch to the local
neighborhood. Automatic teller machines display historical
trivia, including, for example, how some of the banks earlier
this century had ladies' departments where women could get
freshly minted cash and coins to avoid soiling their white
gloves.</p>
<p>There are at least 100 corporate museums in the U.S.,
according to Mr. Danilov's research, and another 125
overseas, where Japan leads with 34. Tossing in places like
visitors' centers at utility plants, and corporate-sponsored
art galleries, the total in the U.S. is more than 200. Most
involve some description of a company's history, goals and
values, along with a sprinkling of artifacts. Says Mr.
Danilov: "No two are the same."</p>
<p>Corporate museums are frequently housed in a headquarters
building or a major plant, and are free to the public. But
some companies send exhibits on tour. For several years, RJR
Nabisco Inc. has circulated to state museums a collection of
paintings used in early 1900s advertisements for Cream of
Wheat cereal and Ritz crackers, among other products.</p>
<p>The Coca-Cola museum is a free-standing building, near
Atlanta's Underground nightlife and shopping area. Even
though there is a $2.50 admission charge and a gift shop with
Coca-Cola clothes and toys, the company says the museum isn't
a profitmaking venture.</p>
<p>Inside is everything from the 1887 patent application for
a product listed as "Coca-Cola Syrup and Extract" to the
company's well-known trays and cardboard cutouts, with
celebrities like Jean Harlow and Cary Grant pitching Coke.</p>
<p>People can walk inside eight-foot tall Coca-Cola cans to
watch brief movies on Coke's history. Machines dispense
several of Coke's exotic drinks from around the world, such
as a tutti-frutti drink sold in Costa Rica. A high-tech
fountain machine fires thin streams of Coca-Cola 20 feet
through the air.</p>
<p>Glitz aside, the museum offers a rare glimpse at the
company's early struggle to lure consumers to a new drink
with an odd name, Coca-Cola. Initially, it was pitched as
something of a miracle elixir. "Cures the worst headache,"
says one ad. "The wonderful nerve & brain tonic and
remarkable therapeutic agent," says another.</p>
<p>In some ways, what the museum doesn't have is almost as
interesting as what it does, underscoring the difficulty
companies may have in presenting their history objectively.
There is, for example, no reference to cocaine. The company
has denied that the drug was ever in its drink, but that
lingering legend is arguably a real part of Coca-Cola lore.
(The "Coca-Cola" name was derived from two of the drink's
ingredients, flavoring extracts from both the coca leaf, from
which cocaine can be produced, and the cola nut.)</p>
<p>What's more, with three floors and thousands of words and
images on the history of Coke, there's not one mention of
Pepsi-Cola Co., its main competitor. Granted, Coke did foot
the bill for the museum. But by most accounts, Pepsi has had
a big impact on the direction of Coca-Cola's history,
especially in forcing Coke into its greatest marketing
fiasco, the 1985 introduction of a reformulated Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>Philip Mooney, Coca-Cola's archivist, says the museum does
indeed offer an objective history. "Cocaine has never been an
ingredient, and the whole history of that is pretty well
undocumented." On Pepsi, he says, "Essentially we were
focusing on our company, not focusing on other influences in
the marketplace. It's really a story, a case study, of a
consumer product and how it has interfaced with consumers
over 104 years. We could have chosen to tell other stories .
. . but we leave it to others to tell the cola war stories."</p>
<p>Compared to a nearby wall that enshrines Coke's classic
Santa Claus ads, New Coke is treated more like a historical
footnote. A can of New Coke is in a display case next to a
can of the original formula drink, which was reintroduced in
a stunning about-face as Coca-Cola Classic after howls of
protest from Coke drinkers.</p>
<p>A text panel notes that on the day Coke announced it would
bring back its original formula in 1985, ABC News interrupted
"General Hospital" with a special bulletin, and 18,000
appreciative people lit up Coke's switchboard in Atlanta.</p>
<p>The display quotes Coke President Donald R. Keough: "Some
critics will say Coca-Cola made a marketing mistake. Some
cynics will say that we planned the whole thing. The truth is
we are not that dumb and we are not that smart."</p>
