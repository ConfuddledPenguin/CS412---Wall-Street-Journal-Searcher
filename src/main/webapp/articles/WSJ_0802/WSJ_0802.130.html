	<p class="article-leader">Your July 16 editorial Asides "Sweet Revenge," charging
that "Democrats" froze the office expenses for former
presidents in order to "reach" back to "whack four American
Presidents," is slightly bizarre in view of the fact that the
author of the amendment to freeze the freebies was the Hon.
Joseph Skeen of New Mexico -- a Republican.
   Talk about "reaching."</p>
