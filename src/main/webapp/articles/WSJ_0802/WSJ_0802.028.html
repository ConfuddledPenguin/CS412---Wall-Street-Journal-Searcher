	<p class="article-leader">Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Oppenheimer
Management Corp.'s senior executives agreed to acquire
Oppenheimer Management, a $14 billion mutual fund company,
from British & Commonwealth Holdings PLC for approximately
$150 million.
   The acquisition, which will give MassMutual an 80% voting
interest in Oppenheimer Management, will set the life insurer
up as a major player in the mutual fund business. "We tried
growing {a mutual fund business} ourselves, but it's going to
take forever before we reach a significant size," said Thomas
B. Wheeler, chairman and chief executive officer of
Springfield, Mass.-based MassMutual. "But with $14 billion
under management, we've achieved the critical mass that we
need."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>British & Commonwealth was forced to sell its U.S. unit
because it needed to raise $2 billion to pay debt. In April,
it was forced to write off about $900 million in losses at
another subsidiary, Atlantic Computers PLC. In early June,
the firm entered "administration," the U.K. equivalent of
Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer and MassMutual are putting up about 50% of the
buy-out price and plan to finance the remainder.
Oppenheimer's senior managers are contributing $12 million of
equity capital for the buy-out.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the $150 million price for Oppenheimer
was modest. But Jon S. Fossel, Oppenheimer's president and
chief executive, said $7 billion of the company's $14 billion
in assets consists of money market funds that Oppenheimer
manages for other concerns, including $6 billion for A.E.
Edwards & Sons, the St. Louis-based brokerage firm.
Management fees for money market funds are usually slimmer
and transaction costs are higher than for traditional stock
funds, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Fossel said the accord between the two companies "is a
pretty neat marriage." Although Oppenheimer will be an
independent unit of the insurance company, he sees some
eventual joint activities for the two concerns. Oppenheimer
would like to sell variable annuities, and Mr. Fossel hopes
to tap into MassMutual's expertise and back-office operations
in these areas. MassMutual's 3,500 agents who are licensed to
sell mutual funds will have additional funds to sell. Right
now, they sell about 26 of Oppenheimer's 50 funds.</p>
<p>Mr. Wheeler said the Oppenheimer acquisition will also put
MassMutual on an equal footing with some top life insurers
who already own investment management firm or mutual fund
companies. He said he expects the Oppenheimer business to
generate substantial revenue for MassMutual, which is the
11th largest life insurer in the U.S.</p>
<p>MassMutual has a small family of funds with $350 million
in assets. Many of these funds will be eventually folded into
the Oppenheimer funds.</p>
