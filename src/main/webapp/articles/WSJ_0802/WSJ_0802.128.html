	<p class="article-leader">Investments in money market mutual funds hit a record
level in the latest week, after increasing for four weeks in
a row.
   Assets of 431 taxable funds totaled $385.4 billion, up
$587.4 million, at the close of business Tuesday, according
to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. The total is $200
million above the previous record of $385.2 billion in the
week ended last March 27.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Money fund assets continued to climb even as yields
continued to slip. The average seven-day compound yield,
which assumes reinvestment of dividends, dropped to 7.84%
from 7.88%.</p>
<p>Martha Wittbrodt, editor of the Holliston, Mass.-based
newsletter, said the decline reflects the Federal Reserve's
recent easing of interest rates. But money funds continue to
draw deposits because their yields still beat those of
competing short-term investments, such as Treasury bills.</p>
<p>Average maturity of the taxable funds remained the same in
the week ended Tuesday, at 44 days. That's within the range
of the last few months; average maturity has been as short as
29 days and as long as 53 days in recent years. Money funds
invest in such things as short-term Treasury securities,
commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs) and bank
certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
slipped to 7.56% from 7.59%. The average 30-day simple yield
also eased, to 7.62% from 7.65% and the average 30-day
compound yield dropped to 7.91% from 7.94%</p>
<p>Yields on tax-exempt funds were flat to down. The average
seven-day compound yield of 226 tax-free funds remained at
5.21%, Donoghue's reported. The latest yield is equivalent to
7.24% for an investor in the 28% tax bracket and 7.78% for
someone paying 33% in taxes.</p>
<p>Assets of the tax-exempt funds decreased to $78.7 billion
from $78.8 billion. Average maturity remained at 51 days.</p>
