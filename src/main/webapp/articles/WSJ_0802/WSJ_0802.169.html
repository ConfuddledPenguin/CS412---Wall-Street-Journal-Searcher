	<p class="article-leader">Aifs Inc., San Francisco, said a majority of its debenture
holders approved a previously proposed buy-out of the
company's shareholders and that it had settled class-action
lawsuits challenging the transaction.
   As previously reported, a group led by Chief Executive
Officer Roger O. Walther is proposing to acquire the company
for $6.50 a share. Aifs is an operator of cultural and
educational exchange programs for students. The group hopes
to complete the transaction in September.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Aifs said a majority of holders of its $10 million
outstanding in debentures had backed the plan after the
company agreed to boost the interest rate on the debentures
to 13.5% from 11.25% and to offer to repurchase one-quarter
of the debentures at 90% of par value plus interest for a
period of 90 days following the buy-out's completion.</p>
<p>The company also said the Delaware Court of Chancery
approved a previously reported settlement of shareholder
lawsuits challenging the buy-out, which was originally
proposed at $5.25 a share. Mr. Walther said the court granted
$125,000 in attorney fees for the plaintiffs.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the American Stock
Exchange, Aifs stock closed at $6.375, up 25 cents.</p>
