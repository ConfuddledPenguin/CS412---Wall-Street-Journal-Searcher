	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- First City Bancorp of Texas said it formed a
merchant bank unit to pursue management buy-outs,
recapitalizations, expansion opportunities and divestitures
for medium-sized companies based in the Southwest.
   The bank holding company said the merchant bank has
already secured two agreements to place about $150 million of
debt on the market, and added that "current business levels"
