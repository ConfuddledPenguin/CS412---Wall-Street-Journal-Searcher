	<p class="article-leader">TAMPA, Fla. -- A federal grand jury returned indictments
against four employees of E-Systems Inc., alleging that the
men repeatedly falsified test results and other records
concerning the manufacture of U.S. Army field radios.
   "We are aware of the indictments," said a spokesman for
the Dallas-based defense contractor. "These employees are on
administrative leave. We can only extend to these employees
their constitutional guarantee of a presumption of
innocence." An investigation of the company continues.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>E-Systems closed its Memcor plant in Bushnell, Fla., in
1986 after the Army declared that the company was in default
on two contracts valued at $19 million and terminated the
contracts. E-Systems appealed, claiming $13 million in
damages. The criminal investigation arose from that dispute.</p>
<p>The indictment alleges that three managers and a
supervisor at the Memcor plant ignored requirements to report
test failures and repairs on the Army field radios and
covertly created false documents on untested radios.</p>
<p>The indictments charged the men with one count of
conspiracy to defraud the government and five counts of
making false claims. In a related case in January, Justice
Department attorneys won a conviction of Memcor production
supervisor Sadonna S. Hobbs for perjury. She was sentenced to
16 months in a federal correctional facility.</p>
<p>E-Systems expects a speedy resolution of investigations, a
spokesman said.</p>
<p>"The company is negotiating a complete resolution of all
matters pending," said Barbara Kittay, an attorney in the
Justice Department's fraud section.</p>
<p>E-Systems announced a second-quarter after-tax charge of
$8.6 million to cover Memcor claims; the company expects no
further charges, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Charged in the indictment are Howard DeWight Rader, former
plant manager; Harley W. Hopson, former manager of quality
assurance; Houston Stanley Burke, former manager of test
production; and former quality assurance supervisor Paul R.
Preston Jr.</p>
