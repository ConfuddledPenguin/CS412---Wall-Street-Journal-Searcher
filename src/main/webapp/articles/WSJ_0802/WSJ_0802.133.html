	<p class="article-leader">Logicon Inc. said its net income dropped 32% in its first
quarter ended June 30 because of problems with a $30 million
contract to provide air traffic controller training systems
for the U.S. Navy.
   Logicon, a Los Angeles-based supplier of electronic
systems and high-tech services, said net income was $1.8
million, or 43 cents a share, compared with $2.6 million, or
58 cents a share, in the same period last year. Revenue rose
7% to $63.5 million from $59.1 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Logicon said its earnings drop stemmed from a $1.1 million
pretax loss provision on the Navy contract. A company
spokesman said that if it weren't for the contract loss,
Logicon's net income would have risen slightly in the
quarter.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Logicon has filed for an adjustment in
the contract, saying the Navy imposed changes in system
performance criteria that weren't included in the contract.
These changes increased costs to the company and caused
delivery delays.</p>
