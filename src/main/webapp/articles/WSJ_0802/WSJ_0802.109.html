	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, the embattled chairman
of the Chicago Board of Trade, resigned suddenly from his
post as the top officer of the nation's largest futures
exchange.
   The proud manager, who reveled in the traditions of the
country's oldest futures exchange and the influence it
commanded, broke a venerable CBOT tradition by stepping down.
He is the first Board of Trade chairman to resign in 130
years, the exchange said. The Board of Trade was formed in
1848.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The exchange's directors said that Vice Chairman William
F. O'Connor was elected to serve as chairman for the
remainder of Mr. Mahlmann's fourth one-year term.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahlmann's resignation yesterday afternoon followed
weeks of mounting criticism leveled at the 52-year-old
executive for his role as chairman of financially crippled
Stotler Group Inc., which has futures brokerage and funds
management subsidiaries. Stotler Group's troubles and those
of its units have tarnished the reputation of the Board of
Trade at a time of increased congressional concern about lax
regulation in the futures industry, exchange members said.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahlmann's nickname, earned more than 30 years ago
when the young German immigrant started out trading grain in
the physical or "cash," as opposed to futures, market, has
taken on an ironic aspect in recent weeks. Stotler Group has
been driven to the brink of insolvency by the inability of it
and its main futures brokerage unit to raise enough cash to
meet industry capital requirements.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most serious blow yet to a Stotler unit was
delivered Tuesday by the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. The federal regulator charged the company's
Stotler Funds Inc. subsidiary with fraudulently misusing $5.5
million in customer money invested in two futures funds it
managed. Until then, the cash-strapped Stotler companies had
been able to say that no customer funds had been imperiled by
their difficulties.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. Mahlmann nor any other individual was named in
the CFTC charges.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahlmann couldn't be reached for comment on his
resignation or the events leading up to it.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning Mr. Mahlmann resigned from his role as
chairman of Stotler Group and its failed futures brokerage
unit, Stotler & Co. But in a letter distributed to exchange
members he said he was determined to serve out the remainder
of his term.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the exchange's board, after telling members in
a letter that the exchange had acted properly in its
oversight of Stotler, said they unanimously supported Mr.
Mahlmann as chairman of the exchange. Some members said
privately that the directors should have waited until more
facts were known about Stotler's troubles before lining up
behind the chairman.</p>
<p>By yesterday afternoon, Mr. Mahlmann appeared to realize
that the events surrounding the Stotler parent company and
its subsidiaries had overtaken him, and he wouldn't be able
to effectively lead the Board of Trade, an exchange director
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahlmann told the directors that his resignation was
"in the overwhelming interest of the Board of Trade,"
according to an exchange news release.</p>
<p>The fallout from the Stotler companies' troubles is likely
to haunt Mr. Mahlmann for months. Regulators are almost
certain to take disciplinary action of some sort against
Stotler Group, its subsidiaries or both. Company officers
could also be named. Civil lawsuits from disgruntled
investors in Stotler Group or in the funds managed by Stotler
Funds also are likely, regulators say.</p>
<p>Futures regulators say the case may also be referred to
the local U.S. attorney's office for possible criminal
prosecution.</p>
<p>Mr. Mahlmann has gone to great lengths in recent days to
emphasize that he hasn't been involved in the day-to-day
management of any of the Stotler companies for more than two
years. He began spending nearly all his time on exchange
affairs by early 1988, and agreed to relinquish his position
as managing partner of the Stotler partnership that was
reorganized as Stotler Group when the company went public in
August 1988.</p>
<p>Since mid-1989 Mr. Mahlmann hasn't received a salary from
Stotler. The Board of Trade made the chairmanship a paying
position in 1989 with an annual salary of $250,000.</p>
<p>Stotler's troubles were publicly hinted at July 12, when
Stotler Group asked that its stock not open for trading on
the American Stock Exchange because of "news pending." Three
days later the company, confirming widespread industry
rumors, said its Stotler & Co. futures brokerage unit
couldn't meet CBOT minimum capital requirements.</p>
<p>The company fell out of compliance with capital rules when
a nearly $13 million inter-company funds transfer between it
and the parent Stotler Group was disallowed by the CFTC.
Futures industry regulations require that brokerage firms
maintain a cash cushion equal to 4% of segregated customer
funds.</p>
<p>Less than two weeks later Stotler & Co. was forced out of
the brokerage business for lack of capital.</p>
<p>Stotler Group last week defaulted on $750,000 in
commercial paper payments and said it may not be able to make
$7.6 million in debt payments due within 30 days.</p>
