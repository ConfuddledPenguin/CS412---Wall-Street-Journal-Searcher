	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The dollar rose across the board as dealers
who had sold the currency against the mark Tuesday took
profits.
   But market participants agreed that the day's session
represented no long-term reversal in the dollar's fortunes.
The great bulk of dollar positions are short, they said, on
the belief that the U.S. currency is still headed for record
lows against its German counterpart.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5885
marks, up from 1.5869 marks late Tuesday. The U.S. currency
was also changing hands at 147.18 yen, above 145.80 yen in
New York late Tuesday. Sterling was trading at $1.8555, down
from $1.8640 late Tuesday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 147.05 yen almost an hour after the opening; it closed in
Tokyo Wednesday at 146.65 yen. Meanwhile, the U.S. currency
was trading at about 1.5840 marks, down from Tokyo's
Wednesday close of 1.5938 marks.</p>
<p>The dollar's value in recent days has been edging close to
the level of 1.5615 marks briefly seen on Jan. 4, 1988, which
was its lowest since the West German currency's creation
after World War II.</p>
<p>Supporting their view that the dollar will continue to
soften against the mark, currency analysts and traders noted
that the dollar's gains were led by purchases with yen. The
U.S. currency climbed exactly two yen from its intraday low
of 145.60 yen at the start of Australian trading to its day's
high of 147.60 yen in the afternoon in New York.</p>
<p>Against the German currency, the dollar peaked at 1.5948
marks just before the European close.</p>
<p>Some U.S. corporations and speculators who tried to sell
dollars, however, were unable to get their orders executed
before London closed and liquidity dried up, according to
Keith Raphael, a Chase Manhattan vice president for foreign
exchange. Left on their own, he said, New York market makers
had to bring the dollar's price down to find enough buyers
for the backlog of sellers.</p>
<p>"Because the pressure on the dollar is still strong, it
looks like it'll fall again" today, said Kenichiro Takeda, a
senior dealer and trading manager at Mitsubishi Trust in
Tokyo.</p>
<p>"The market's frustrated that it can't reach the lows,"
another Tokyo dealer said, bemoaning the part the Asian
market played in interrupting the dollar's decline. "The
downside still has a lot of potential for investors to take
profits."</p>
<p>But even investors who agree on the dollar's bleak
prospects bought it yesterday.</p>
<p>Explained a foreign exchange trader in Paris, "The dollar
fell too far too fast {Tuesday} and was due for a
correction."</p>
<p>The desire to chalk up profits was strong yesterday even
though monthly books had been closed the day before, said
Alan Leventen, managing director of financial services for
Balfour, Maclaine Futures in New York.</p>
<p>The next opportunity for pocketing gains, he said, will
come tomorrow, when the U.S. releases its July employment
statistics. Mr. Leventen said profit-taking pressure on any
downward tick in the dollar may leave it higher at the end of
the day, even if the jobs report is dismal.</p>
<p>In fact, in selling their non-dollar currencies yesterday,
dealers and investors ignored added evidence of U.S. economic
stagnation.</p>
<p>The July purchasing managers' index fell to 47.4% after
three months of gains. A reading below 50% indicates
manufacturing is in decline. The index had been expected to
read 50.8% for the month.</p>
<p>The June leading indicators index, meanwhile, was
unchanged after a revised 0.7% gain in May.</p>
<p>A weaker dollar may be favored by the U.S. Federal
Reserve, which is under pressure to spur economic expansion.</p>
<p>"A lower dollar is the equivalent of lower interest
rates," Chase's Mr. Raphael said. "I doubt we'll see another
easing in credit policy before October. Instead, the Fed will
hope weak fundamentals will weaken the dollar enough to
improve the trade deficit." The resulting rise in exports
would be a welcome boost for the U.S. economy, he said.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $373.30 an ounce, up $3.30. Estimated
volume was a moderate 3.3 million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$374.75 an ounce.</p>
