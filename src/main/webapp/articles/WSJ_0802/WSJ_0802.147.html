	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The annual meeting of the American Bar
Association in Chicago is off to an unusual start.
   Tuesday night, on the eve of the convention, ABA President
Stanley Chauvin discovered that $55,000 he had placed in a
hotel lockbox was missing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Chauvin, a 55-year-old Louisville, Ky., attorney,
received the money from a client Sunday night "in an escrow
transaction" in Louisville, a spokesman for the ABA said.
Lawyers in civil practice are frequently involved in escrow
transactions, in which money is held on behalf of clients
during certain proceedings. Such transactions, however, are
not usually conducted in cash. Because banks weren't open
Sunday and he was leaving for Chicago early Monday morning,
Mr. Chauvin took $55,000 in $100 bills with him on the plane
to Chicago.</p>
<p>Upon his arrival at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, he rented a
deposit box and put a cloth bag containing the bills into it.
Tuesday night, Mr. Chauvin checked on the money and found the
box empty, the ABA spokesman said. He wouldn't identify the
client involved, citing attorney-client privilege.</p>
<p>Mr. Chauvin wasn't available for comment yesterday. No one
at his Louisville firm, Alagia, Day, Marshall, Mintmire &
Chauvin, would comment.</p>
<p>A hotel spokesman said that it takes two keys to open the
deposit box -- the key of the renter and another key held by
hotel employees.</p>
<p>The box didn't appear to have been broken into, said Sgt.
Booker Moore, a policeman called to the scene to investigate
the reported theft.</p>
