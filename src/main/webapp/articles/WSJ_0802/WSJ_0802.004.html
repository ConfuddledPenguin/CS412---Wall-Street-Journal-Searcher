	<p class="article-leader">GREEN BAY, Wis. -- Fort Howard Corp. said Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Paul J. Schierl, who is "recovering
from complications following surgery," resigned from both
positions.
   The closely held tissue-paper concern named President
Donald DeMeuse to the additional post of chief executive; the
chairman's post wasn't immediately filled.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Schierl led the management group that, along with
Morgan Stanley Group Inc., took the company private in 1988
for $3.9 billion. Mr. DeMeuse was also a member of the
management group.</p>
<p>Fort Howard said Mr. Schierl will continue as a consultant
to Morgan Stanley working on special projects unrelated to
Fort Howard.</p>
