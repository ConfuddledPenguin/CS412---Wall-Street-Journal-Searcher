	<p class="article-leader">CMS Enhancements Inc. said it expects to post a net loss
for its fourth quarter ended June 30, reflecting more than
$4.5 million in nonrecurring charges.
   CMS said most of the charges are related to a planned
write-down of its computer data storage inventory. In the
yearago quarter, CMS had net income of $1.2 million, or 10
cents a share, on revenue of $42.8 million. The company said
it expects to report that total revenue in fiscal 1990 was
about 7% lower than the $200.4 million it had the year
before.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Tustin, Calif., company has been battered in the past
year by tough competition from other producers of computer
mass data storage systems such as hard disks. For the nine
months ended March 31, net income dropped 40% to $2.2 million
from $3.6 million a year earlier.</p>
