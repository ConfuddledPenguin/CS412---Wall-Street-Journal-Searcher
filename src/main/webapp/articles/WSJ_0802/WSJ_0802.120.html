	<p class="article-leader">Datron Systems Inc. said it has begun its previously
reported plan to buy back as many as 150,000, or about 5%, of
its common shares in the open market.
   Datron, a Simi Valley, Calif., maker of
satellite-communications systems and radio products, said the
shares would be held as treasury stock for use in stock
option and other incentive compensation plans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"At the current levels, we believe our stock is
undervalued," said David Derby, president and chief executive
officer. "While our first-quarter performance was below
expectations, we are highly confident about the company's
long-term growth prospects."</p>
<p>Last week, Datron reported an 80% decline in fiscal
first-quarter net income to $170,000, or six cents a share,
from $866,000, or 28 cents a share. Sales in the period ended
June 30 fell 21% to $8.3 million from $10.6 million.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading, Datron closed
yesterday at $7, up 62.5 cents.</p>
