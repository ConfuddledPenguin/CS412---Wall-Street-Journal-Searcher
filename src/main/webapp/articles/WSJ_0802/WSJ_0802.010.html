	<p class="article-leader">CINCINNATI -- A federal jury acquitted Miami Beach, Fla.,
hotelier Leonard A. Pelullo on all charges that he defrauded
a Gahanna, Ohio, thrift.
   Mr. Pelullo and Houston businessman David A. Friedmann had
been charged in U.S. district court in Cincinnati with four
counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy involving
the now defunct Savings One Association, which Mr. Friedmann
once owned.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Cincinnati jury's decision removes a cloud hanging
over Mr. Pelullo in a lengthy legal battle with DWG Corp.,
the centerpiece of Miami financier Victor Posner's battered
financial empire. Mr. Pelullo, a former consultant to Mr.
Posner, is seeking a Cleveland federal court's permission to
sue DWG for $8 million in fees he claims he is owed.</p>
<p>Granada Investments Inc., an investment company with which
Mr. Pelullo once was associated, has filed a lawsuit in the
same Cleveland court alleging that Mr. Posner and DWG's
directors shirked their fiduciary duty and manipulated DWG's
stock in rejecting Granada's $22-a-share, or $572 million,
bid for DWG last year.</p>
<p>DWG has countersued, charging that Granada's bid was a
sham intended to boost the value of its DWG holdings. The
company also alleged that the investor group obtained its
original DWG stake based on "material, non-public, inside
information" obtained by Mr. Pelullo during his time as a
consultant. The two sides, which each deny any wrongdoing,
are involved in settlement talks.</p>
<p>The thrift indictment handed up by a federal grand jury
here last year alleged that Messrs. Pelullo and Friedmann
conspired to obtain a $1 million loan that was used for
purposes other than stated in the loan applications.</p>
<p>The indictment also alleged that Mr. Pelullo paid Mr.
Friedmann some $145,000 in kickbacks for help in obtaining
loans.</p>
<p>But Mr. Pelullo argued in court that the alleged kickback
was, in fact, a deposit he had placed in escrow to be used as
prepaid interest on a loan extension he was expecting to
receive, and that Mr. Friedmann had stolen the money.</p>
<p>Mr. Friedmann, who has pleaded not guilty, is scheduled to
go to trial Aug. 13.</p>
