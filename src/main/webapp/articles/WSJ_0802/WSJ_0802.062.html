	<p class="article-leader">First, the value of your house sagged. Now, the value of
your business may be tumbling, too.
   The market for selling small firms "is getting worse,"
says Jerome Siebert, a Fairfield, Conn., business broker.
"Buyers are passing up deals they would have taken a very
hard look at last year." When they do decide to buy, Mr.
Siebert says, "they're going to press even harder for a
better deal."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Buyers have been forced to become more conservative as
bank regulators and the threat of recession have pressured
U.S. commercial banks to retreat from highly leveraged
transactions. New money sources, such as foreign investors,
have taken up some of the slack. And even sellers are willing
to help finance some deals. But financing terms today require
buyers to put more of their own money into transactions. With
more equity -- and risk -- in the deal, they want higher
returns. Experts say that expectation, in addition to the
more conservative nature of the lenders, is driving down
purchase prices.</p>
<p>Most business brokers, investment bankers and financiers
say prices for small companies continued to decline during
the first half of this year after falling throughout last
year. In 1989, the median price of publicly announced
business sales tracked by Mergerstat Review, a trade
publication, declined nearly 36%.</p>
<p>Where small companies were selling for as much as eight to
10 times cash flow in 1988, they are unlikely to get more
than six times cash flow today, says Jon Ledecky, a partner
of the Legacy Fund, a Washington, D.C., group that buys
stakes in family-run businesses.</p>
<p>"Getting deals done at the old lofty levels is no longer
achievable," he says. "That, I can say, is a national rule at
this point, no matter how hot the field."</p>
<p>Mr. Ledecky and many others don't see conditions for
business sellers improving. "The environment for selling
small businesses is not going to change in the next 18
months," Mr. Ledecky says. "If anything, it's going to get
worse."</p>
<p>There are dissenters to the majority view. "All deals are
down, but the market you're talking about {smaller companies}
is the most promising and most active at the moment," says
Elizabeth Squeri, editor of Buyouts, a Wellesley Hills,
Mass., newsletter. "We're cautiously saying things are
getting better."</p>
<p>There's no doubt some small companies are still in strong
demand, especially in hot industries such as environmental
services and biotechnology. And the big corporations that
snap up small firms for strategic reasons are largely
unaffected by the new financial climate.</p>
<p>Ted Berghorst, chairman of Vector Securities International
Inc., a Chicago-based investment bank specializing in life
sciences, says big corporations are actively seeking out
deals in biotechnology, where sales of genetically engineered
drugs are expected to rise sharply. "We have seen absolutely
no significant slowdown in terms of buyer interest," he says.</p>
<p>Tokyo's Mitsubishi Kasei Corp., for instance, recently
paid about $20 million for Seradyne Inc., a small
Indianapolis firm that markets diagnostic systems. "They had
some very exciting core technologies that complemented
Mitsubishi's product line," says Mr. Berghorst.</p>
<p>As Mitsubishi Kasei's purchase illustrates, foreign
investment also offers some hope for sellers of small
companies. "Our overall volume {of foreign investment} has
increased markedly in the past year, which we didn't expect,"
says Robert Machinist, president of MMG Patricof & Co., a New
York investment banking firm with offices in five European
cities.</p>
<p>Mr. Machinist's firm is in the process of raising about
$25 million for a U.S. video-production company to help it
make acquisitions. The money came from the sale of preferred
stock and warrants to European investors. At the Legacy Fund,
Mr. Ledecky says Girozentrale Vienna, a New York merchant
bank that represents Austrian investors, just funded the
leveraged buy-out of Snell Environmental Services Inc., a
small Astor, Penn., concern.</p>
<p>For most sellers of small companies, however, the
traditional bank financing they were accustomed to has dried
up. "Two years ago, several hundred U.S. banks were willing
to do highly leveraged transactions," says James Cowart, a
principal of Capital Resource Partners, a Boston merger
maker. "Today, there's a real small number who are doing
them." To close the recent sale of a small electronics
concern, he says, "we were faced with putting up all the
capital."</p>
<p>In the past 18 months, "there's been a steady shift among
lenders to a much more conservative approach, and my feeling
is it is going to continue like this for a while," says Paul
Broude, a partner at O'Connor, Broude, Snyder & Aronson, a
Waltham, Mass., law firm that represents emerging businesses
with sales of $70 million or less.</p>
<p>As a result, companies that used to take four to six
months to sell are staying on the block for six to nine
months. "Closing is very difficult in this market," says MMG
Patricof's Mr. Machinist. "You have to do much more work to
accomplish the same task."</p>
<p>When companies finally sell, buyers are forced to come up
with more equity to satisfy their lenders. Lloyd Greif, vice
chairman and managing director of finance at Sutro & Co., a
Los Angeles investment bank, says financiers typically want
twice as much equity in deals today.</p>
<p>In May 1986, for example, when Sutro arranged the sale of
Krause's Sofa Factory to Equivest Partners Inc., a Newport
Beach, Calif., investment group, less than 10% of the
approximately $20 million purchase price was in the form of
Equivest equity. Nearly three years later, Equivest purchased
Insurance Auto Auctions for roughly the same price. But this
time, the same lender required it to come up with equity
equal to 20% of the purchase price.</p>
<p>With more of their own money in the transaction,
increasing their risk, buyers are expecting commensurately
higher returns. One popular way to get them is to pay less.
"People are more value-oriented," says Mr. Machinist.
"There's less speculative buying."</p>
<p>Richard Israel, a Los Angeles business broker, says the
buyers of the three companies that he helped sell this year
paid an average of 15% to 20% less than what the owners were
asking. "Sellers haven't recognized the changes," he says.</p>
<p>Some small-business owners are finding that out the hard
way. In the past 90 days alone, says Mr. Siebert, the
Connecticut business broker, three deals he tried to arrange
with Mr. Ledecky's Legacy Fund "fell on their face." Mr.
Siebert says the buyers could not arrange financing, even
though the companies -- an apparel-accessories firm, a
computer outfit and a publishing concern -- are all
profitable, with combined pretax earnings of $6.2 million.
"The banks six months ago would take those deals," he says.</p>
<p>Counters Mr. Ledecky: "Jerry and I differ very much on why
those deals fell through. The sellers had very unrealistic
expectations about what their companies are worth. Money is
there for prudently priced transactions. But the days of
eight to 10 times cash flow are over."</p>
