	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In her 2 1/2 years as chairman of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Wendy Gramm has made
her share of enemies.
   The Chicago commodity exchanges dislike her stand on
trading rules. Securities and Exchange Commission officials
criticize her view of the markets. Congressional leaders
rudely question whether she works full time at her job. And
the White House recently waged an aggressive campaign to take
away a chunk of her agency's clout, despite repeated support
for her personally.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The upshot of all this: Later today, a Senate committee is
expected to vote overwhelmingly to grant her another term at
the helm of the commodities regulator. Just when it appeared
as though Mrs. Gramm's appointment to the CFTC was becoming
an embarrassment to the Bush administration, she has emerged
from her first stint as chairman stronger and better
respected than ever.</p>
<p>"It seems to me that we need strong leadership at the
CFTC, and Wendy's improving strength will be essential," says
Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, a former foe turned friend, and
the ranking Republican on the Agriculture Committee, which
oversees the CFTC.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gramm's resurgence as a shoo-in for another term
stems in part from her political connections -- which include
a husband who's an influential senator -- and in part from
signs of new vitality at the CFTC.</p>
<p>A colleague of then-Vice President George Bush on a
deregulation task force when she was at the Office of
Management and Budget, she became an avid supporter in his
presidential campaign. Her adopted Texas roots (she was born
in Hawaii) don't hurt in the current administration, either.
But the 45-year-old Mrs. Gramm also has helped herself,
becoming a feisty CFTC chairman in the past few months. (Mrs.
Gramm declined to be interviewed for this article.)</p>
<p>The oft-maligned agency has rebounded from a host of
public blunders to press some major enforcement actions.
Earlier this week, the CFTC filed charges against a company
part-owned by Karsten Mahlmann, who resigned yesterday as
chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, one of the most
important markets the CFTC oversees. Although Mr. Mahlmann
wasn't named in the CFTC complaint, the charges were
considered to be a major factor in his decision to resign.</p>
<p>Through it all, there is her husband, influential Sen.
Phil Gramm, who, like the president, is a Texas Republican. A
fierce defender of his wife -- and valued confidant of Mr.
Bush -- Sen. Gramm is the backstop of Mrs. Gramm's strength.</p>
<p>"It has to be a pretty blatant problem for the Senate not
to go along with the administration's choice," says Rep.
Glenn English (D., Okla.), who heads the House subcommittee
overseeing the CFTC. "When the Senate has to deal with a
member of a senator's family, that compounds the problem to a
certain degree."</p>
<p>While that isn't exactly a ringing endorsement, Mrs. Gramm
also has managed to convert many of those who sought a
tougher commodities regulator just a year ago. It was shortly
after that time that Sen. Lugar headed for the White House to
raise questions about whether Mrs. Gramm was right for the
CFTC job.</p>
<p>It's easy to understand why. In the spring of 1989, the
commodities markets were embroiled in scandal after an
undercover operation at the Chicago exchanges led to 16
guilty pleas and 32 other indictments. The traders' alleged
crimes: cheating customers in the same commodities pits that
the CFTC was created to patrol.</p>
<p>Senators pointedly asked where the agency had been. Mrs.
Gramm's answers didn't come easily or clearly. There was "an
inability to brief {Agriculture Committee Chairman} Sen.
{Patrick} Leahy or me comprehensively," recalls Sen. Lugar.</p>
<p>Things got worse. That July, the Chicago Board of Trade,
with the CFTC's knowledge, ordered a huge buyer of soybean
futures, Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A., to divest itself of its
holdings, in turn sending the price of soybeans plummeting.
Farm-state legislators heard howls from agonized constituents
and quickly scheduled hearings.</p>
<p>Before a House panel, Mrs. Gramm defended the Board of
Trade's actions, adding that her agency had consulted many
times with the exchange. Just days later, though, the
exchange chairman told stunned subcommittee members that the
CFTC itself had directed Ferruzzi to sell some of its
soybean-futures holdings hours before the board issued its
mandate.</p>
<p>The congressmen were livid. "I don't think there's a
logical explanation for misleading the committee,"
subcommittee Chairman English said at the time. "And some
members think she went further than misleading." A CFTC
spokeswoman later said that Mrs. Gramm didn't disclose the
action because a statement "might become a market factor."</p>
<p>But clearly the incident violated a cardinal rule of
congressional relations: Do it behind closed doors if you
have to, but keep members informed of sensitive subjects. For
a subsequent Senate hearing on the same subject, Mrs. Gramm
sent another commissioner instead, citing a busy schedule.
"That was a very unsatisfying experience for most of us,"
Sen. Lugar recalls.</p>
<p>Other appearances on Capitol Hill didn't win Mrs. Gramm
many friends either. Her style was often stilted and obtuse,
and she tried to bring obscure economic theory to legislators
who just wanted simple answers.</p>
<p>In a particularly embarrassing episode, Sen. Bob Kerrey
(D., Neb.) asked her whether she worked full time at her job.
A weak answer incited the senator to pose the question again
and again, forcing Mrs. Gramm to repeatedly deny that she did
work for her husband in Texas. At another hearing, in an
unusual show of senatorial discourtesy, Sen. Slade Gorton
(R., Wash.) browsed through the Washington Post sports
section as Mrs. Gramm testified.</p>
<p>Then this spring the administration, led by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, launched a campaign to wrest some
of the CFTC's supervision away from the agency and give it to
the SEC. At issue were stock-index futures, a commodity
product that allows investors to bet on the movement of a
basket of stocks without owning the stocks themselves.</p>
<p>For a time the battle appeared grim, with the chairman of
one of the administration's smallest agencies taking on some
of the White House's heaviest hitters. But Mrs. Gramm hung
tough, aided by futures executives and Agriculture Committee
members, and it now appears that she has won the battle and
will retain supervision of stock-index futures.</p>
<p>The fight also represents a turning point for Mrs. Gramm.
Following a pep talk from Sen. Lugar, her congressional
testimony got sharper. Her arguments became clearer, her
presentation more authoritative. At one hearing, she openly
sparred with SEC Chairman Richard Breeden, concluding that if
there were enforcement problems between the stock and futures
markets, it was because the SEC wasn't minding its store.</p>
<p>Her new gumption is gaining her praise from her fellow
CFTC commissioners. "She's very bright, very tough. I
probably mean tough in the good sense of the word," says CFTC
member William Albrecht. "She fights hard for what she
wants."</p>
