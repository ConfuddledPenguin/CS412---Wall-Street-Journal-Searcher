	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Federal Judge David V. Kenyon here rejected
a county plan to redraw supervisoral district lines that he
had earlier found to violate the constitutional rights of the
area's large Hispanic population.
   Judge Kenyon said the plan, supported by three of the
county's five supervisors, was a "nonsensical distortion" of
existing district lines and "not a good-faith effort" to
comply with his earlier order.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>After announcing his decision in open court, Judge Kenyon
took a short break and then began hearing alternative
proposals from the Justice Department, the American Civil
Liberties Union and the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund.</p>
<p>"His {ultimate} decision could be one of our plans, or one
he develops himself," said Ramona Ripston, executive director
of the ACLU of Southern California. She expects him to adopt
a plan as soon as tomorrow.</p>
<p>"We are only a few months away from having results from
the 1990 census," said a spokesman for Supervisor Michael
Antonovich, who favored the county plan. "The redistricting
should be done next year with accurate figures rather than
with 1986 {population} projections."</p>
<p>Ms. Ripston countered that the county's "intentional
discrimination" has already gone on much too long. "No woman,
black, or Hispanic has been elected to the board" in this
century, she said.</p>
<p>In June, Judge Kenyon found that the Board of Supervisors
illegally drew boundaries in 1981 to separate the county's
Hispanic community into three separate districts, thus
diluting Hispanic voting strength and maintaining an
all-white governing board. He ordered the county to draw up a
redistricting plan within 20 days. Supervisor Antonovich said
the county would appeal Judge Kenyon's finding.</p>
