	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Japan has agreed to give U.S. vendors
greater opportunities to sell certain telecommunications
terminal equipment and data-transmission services to Japanese
customers, U.S. trade officials said.
   The U.S. negotiators wrung these pledges from officials of
the Japanese Ministry of Post and Telecommunications just
hours before a deadline set for the White House to determine
whether Japan is abiding by a number of telecommunications
accords with the U.S. The deadline was set by mutual
agreement by the U.S. and Japan. The concessions made by
Japan avert threatened trade sanctions against that country,
according to the U.S. trade office.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills called the Japanese
agreement a "major breakthrough," asserting that U.S.
manufacturing, financial and other firms that require
communications services in Japan "should be able to run those
operations more easily and economically."</p>
<p>The latest commitments give U.S. companies the right to
sell network channel terminating equipment, or NCTEs,
directly to Japanese customers, instead of through common
carriers such as Japan's giant Nippon Telegraph & Telephone
Corp. as required by current regulations. U.S. trade
officials estimate the initial U.S. market share at $150
million annually but much larger in the future.</p>
<p>NCTEs are similar to the modems used to transmit data over
telephone lines. These devices enable users of
personal-computer networks to exchange digitalized data.
Direct access to Japanese customers could stimulate the U.S.
sales of NCTEs because of the technical superiority of the
U.S. products.</p>
<p>In another major concession, Tokyo has agreed to scrap
several barriers to its market for international value-added
networks, or IVANs. Such networks are the vehicles through
which electronic banking, voice mail, and other
communications services are conducted across national
boundaries.</p>
<p>The agreement gives U.S. providers of IVANs a shorter wait
for approval -- 30 days instead of several months -- and
removes the 20% surcharges that typically are levied by
common carriers for the lease of their lines. Although the
IVANs mostly link customers in the U.S. and Japan, the latest
package gives Japan-based U.S. providers the right to service
other countries.</p>
<p>U.S. providers currently have a fraction of Japan's $750
million annual IVAN market, but their share could grow
sharply as a result of the agreement, U.S. officials
predicted.</p>
