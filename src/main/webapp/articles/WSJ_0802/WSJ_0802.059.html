	<p class="article-leader">In between camcorders, ruby rings and facial-hair
removers, several cable television shopping channels have
started selling a novel product: books.
   Viewers can call a toll-free number to buy a copy while
the author and a host sit in a studio extolling the book's
virtues: "great photos;" "easy reading;" "get your own
autographed copy." Best-selling novelist Rosamunde Pilcher
pitched her latest book on QVC, and Arthur Hailey and Bob
Hope have appeared on J.C. Penney's Television Shopping
Channel. QVC says it sells 100 to 150 books a minute.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Faced with the hard economics of publishing, many writers
have become more aggressive and creative about promoting
their books and themselves. Joan Didion modeled a turtleneck
in an ad for the Gap clothing stores. Leslie Walker, a
Baltimore reporter, traveled the talk show circuit with the
brother of a murderer she portrayed in her book -- until the
brother was jailed for murder. Jimmy Carter took journalists
on fishing trips to promote "An Outdoor Journal" several
years ago -- and he's a former president.</p>
<p>But there's debate in the book world about how much of a
huckster a writer should be. The latest author to kindle the
controversy is Ken Follett. To increase sales of "Pillars of
the Earth," his latest novel in paperback, he agreed to be
part of the prize in a contest advertised in thousands of
bookstores. "Pillars" is about the building of a medieval
cathedral, and the winner of the contest will get a free trip
to England and a tour of Westminster Abbey guided by the
author.</p>
<p>And that's not all. At his publisher's request, Mr.
Follett wrote a romantic short story, "The Abiding Heart,"
that takes place in the present but uses the same medieval
cathedral as a backdrop. Good Housekeeping magazine got the
story free for its current issue. In return, Mr. Follett's
publisher, a division of Penguin USA, received two full pages
advertising the "Pillars" contest just before the story.</p>
<p>Some people in the book world are bothered by the Follett
magazine story because it was specifically written to garner
space -- and attention -- for an ad.</p>
<p>"I think it's disgraceful," says James Michener, the
83-year-old author of 37 books. But Tama Janowitz, who
promoted her novel "Slaves of New York" with a video of
herself at parties with Andy Warhol, says, "You do what you
have to . . . and as long as someone is moved to read your
book, it's worthwhile."</p>
<p>"I'd be crazy to turn down the chance to reach 20 million
Americans {Good Housekeeping's readership} at one sweep,"
says Mr. Follett. So zealously does the author groom his
public image that he says he once took a course to learn to
apply his own make-up for television, and went to a "color
analyst" so "I would wear colors that make me look
attractive."</p>
<p>Until recently, few authors would have admitted to such
concerns. "Ten years ago it was considered a bit tacky for a
serious writer to even go on a talk show," says Roger Straus
III, managing director of Farrar, Straus & Giroux. "The late
Walker Percy refused to go on Dick Cavett no matter how much
Cavett begged, and that was considered the best show for
selling books. Percy said his job was writing books, not
selling them."</p>
<p>Some writers still feel that way, including John Hersey
and Anne Tyler, but the number is dwindling. Even John Updike
will talk about his books on National Public Radio or the
network morning shows, and for his last book, "The Russia
House," John le Carre agreed to spend a week in New York
doing interviews.</p>
<p>"There is no longer a stigma attached to doing this," says
Laurence Kirshbaum, head of Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Books.
"{Writers} know if they want the bucks, want the books to
sell, they better roll up their sleeves and turn off the word
processor and get out there and sell."</p>
<p>Self-promotion by authors isn't entirely new. Mark Twain
was a notorious ham on the lecture circuit, and Charles
Dickens performed paid readings by the hundreds.
Book-promoting was taken to the heights of hype and crassness
in the 1970s by such legendary hustlers as Jacqueline Susann.
Ms. Susann wooed bookstore owners and wholesalers with
personal notes and visits. To get on television, she would
even do game shows. Barbara Cartland pitched not only her
romance novels but also her own line of bedsheets, greeting
cards, perfume and vitamins, and she recorded an album of
love songs.</p>
<p>Until recently, it seemed that writers were divided into
roughly two camps: It was all right for writers of trashy
novels to promote aggressively, but serious authors didn't
dirty their hands. Now, the distinctions are breaking down.</p>
<p>More than 50,000 books are published a year, and most
disappear fast, selling fewer than 5,000 copies. In the past
decade, many publishing houses have been bought by big
conglomerates that chase surefire best-seller writers with
huge advances. The payments may not "earn out" unless the
author's name can be burned into the public's consciousness.</p>
<p>"One of the wonderful, sad and desperate things about this
business is that nobody really knows how to sell books," says
Mr. Straus of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, whose authors include
Scott Turow. "Especially as the stakes have gotten higher, we
are all thrashing around looking for some way to sell these
books."</p>
<p>Advertising helps, but the usual marketing budget of
$15,000 -- or even, say, $200,000 for an expected bestseller
-- won't buy much of it. Author tours are one answer, and
more are being organized than ever. Even most literary
authors make the rounds of a dozen or so well-known
independent bookstores.</p>
<p>"There are so many writers out there that if you have a
chance to flog your book, you can't say no," says Mark
Childress, who is embarking on a 22-city tour this fall for
"Tender," his new novel. "My first two books got wonderful
reviews, but hardly anybody bought them. I spent two years in
a room writing this book, and three weeks on the road isn't a
big investment of my time. I want to make this a living, not
a hobby."</p>
<p>Getting exposure, even for a best-selling author like Mr.
Follett, requires a strategy. Mr. Follett's paperback
publisher, New American Library, knew that no magazine would
make a big fuss excerpting part of "Pillars" because it had
already appeared in hardcover. But once the publisher began
talking to Good Housekeeping about doing a contest, and how
to promote it, the magazine's editors agreed to run a short
story by Mr. Follett if the magazine could have it
exclusively.</p>
<p>It's too early to say what effect the story and contest
will have on sales, but "Pillars" jumped onto the New York
Times paperback best-seller list at fourth place about when
it landed in bookstores.</p>
<p>This wasn't the first offbeat book promotion by the
41-year-old British ex-journalist. To introduce a pen several
years ago, Bic ran ads picturing Mr. Follett's latest novel,
"Lie Down With Lions." Next to his signature, the copy read,
"The Bic Metal Point Roller is so exciting and stimulating I
couldn't put it down." In turn, his paperback publisher
shrink-wrapped thousands of free pens to copies of the book.</p>
<p>Mr. Follett's special willingness to hustle may have been
one factor in the recent feverish auction for his future
books. "One of the key factors in buying Ken's books is that
he's an aggressive promoter," concurs Carole Baron, publisher
of the Dell division of Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing
Group, which has agreed to advance Mr. Follett $12.3 million
for two novels.</p>
<p>As the pressure mounts, some authors are struggling to
figure out just where they should draw the line: What is
acceptable, honorable promotion, and what isn't?</p>
<p>"It doesn't bother me that these young guys are getting a
flood of money," says Mr. Michener. "But I think they better
be very careful about the ethics of their profession. Society
gives writers leverage, and the ethical obligation is to use
that leverage creatively for the welfare of society and the
profession."</p>
<p>Mr. Michener donates all his lecture fees to charity and
turned down "very substantial sums of money" to appear in a
wine commercial. But he recalls having to spend five years on
the lecture circuit early in his career, and he says he did
appear in a liquor ad years ago.</p>
<p>"I do think there is an area of respectable promotion,"
says William Styron, but he says he wouldn't endorse a
product or appear on something like the cable shopping
channel, because "that becomes hucksterism."</p>
<p>Mr. Styron says he was amazed recently at a request to use
a passage from his novel "Sophie's Choice" in a commercial
for Calvin Klein's Obsession perfume. "They were talking a
lot of money, but I very emphatically decided not to," says
Mr. Styron. "For one thing, my daughter told me she would
never speak to me again if I did it."</p>
<p>"I'm sure there are things I wouldn't do, like promoting
cigarettes," says Mr. Follett. "I understand there are
writers who are deeply, deeply serious about the creative
work they do and who feel promoting themselves would sully
that. But it would be pretentious to feel that way about
entertainment fiction. The way I look at it, I'm an
entertainer."</p>
