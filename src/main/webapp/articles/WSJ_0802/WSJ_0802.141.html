	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Pan Am Corp., citing sharply higher revenue at
its Pan American World Airways unit, said its losses from
continuing operations in the second quarter were half those
of the year-earlier period.
   The airline holding company reported a net loss of $49
million, or 33 cents a share, wider than the year-earlier net
loss of $7.7 million. But the 1989 results were helped by a
$92.1 million gain on the sale of a unit and $1.3 million in
income from discontinued operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The carrier's loss from continuing operations narrowed to
$49 million from $101 million. The year-earlier loss from
continuing operations was deepened, however, by $28.2 million
in charges associated with Pan Am's unsuccessful bid for NWA
Inc.; no comparable expense was incurred in the latest
period.</p>
<p>Revenue climbed 12% in the latest quarter to $1.02 billion
from $909.4 million.</p>
<p>Thomas G. Plaskett, Pan Am chairman and chief executive
officer, said, "We are encouraged by our second-quarter
results, not only by the substantial improvement over last
year but by the improving trends we recorded during the
quarter."</p>
<p>Pan Am said passenger traffic in the latest period rose
4.7% and was its highest ever for a second quarter. A
spokeswoman said revenue from that traffic showed an increase
of 16%, reflecting a greater proportion of passengers flying
in first or business class.</p>
<p>The company said it turned a profit in June, the first
month since August 1988 that it has done so. In composite New
York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Pan Am shares closed
unchanged at $2.125.</p>
