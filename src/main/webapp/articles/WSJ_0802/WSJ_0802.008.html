	<p class="article-leader">CLEVELAND -- Cleveland-Cliffs Inc. said 2,000 workers
began a strike at two Michigan mines it manages after members
of the United Steelworkers rejected an offer that would have
increased wages by about $1.50 an hour over four years.
   No further talks have been scheduled and neither side
would predict how long the strike would last.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said union demands would have led to an
overall $40-per hour increase in benefits and wages over the
four-year contract.</p>
<p>But David Foster, a negotiator for the workers, said union
demands amounted to about a $12-per-hour increase over four
years and added that the company did not respond to three
subsequent union offers. "We're waiting to negotiate," he
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Foster said workers currently earn an average of
$13.70 an hour including incentive pay, about the same level
they were paid in 1982.</p>
<p>For Cleveland-Cliffs, a prolonged strike could be
devastating. The two mines, in Empire and Tilden, account for
a large share of the company's business, with a combined
annual capacity of 16 million tons. The strike could also
hurt other company operations, which support the primary iron
ore business.</p>
<p>"It will be a very expensive strike," particularly if it
lasts for more than a week or two, said Harry W. Millis, an
analyst at Cleveland's McDonald & Co. Both mines were
producing and shipping at near capacity, Mr. Millis added, so
they won't be able to make up for lost output.</p>
<p>The two mines, which are owned by a group that includes a
Cleveland-Cliffs subsidiary and steel companies, produced 8.3
million tons of iron ore pellets in the first seven months of
this year.</p>
<p>A company spokesman said the last strike against
Cleveland-Cliffs was in 1977. The company, which manages four
other mines, posted second-quarter earnings of $14.1 million,
or $1.21 per share, on revenue of $89.3 million.</p>
