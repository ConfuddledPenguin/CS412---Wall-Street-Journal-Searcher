	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- The cost of living in East
Germany rose by 7.5% in July from June, but was down 5.5%
from July 1989, a German research institute said.
   The Leipziger Instituts fuer Marktforschung also said the
average monthly income of a family of four in East Germany
fell more than 5% in July, from a year earlier, due to the
restructuring of East Germany's social welfare and income-tax
regimes following the July 1 monetary and economic union with
West Germany.</p>

economic trends in East Germany, produces data considered
