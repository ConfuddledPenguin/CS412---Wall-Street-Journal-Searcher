	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Soaring oil prices prolonged the dollar's
slide and depressed bonds again, but blue-chip stocks managed
to wiggle a little higher.
   The October crude-oil futures contract jumped $1.87 to
$33.63 a barrel, the highest close since these futures
started trading in 1983. The dollar plunged in late New York
trading to 1.5480 marks from 1.5710, and eased to 136.55 yen
from 136.95 Friday. Traders said yen were being sold to buy
marks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 3.22 points in
quiet trading to 2567.33. However, declining issues
outnumbered advancers, 768 to 681, on the New York Stock
Exchange. Long-term U.S. Treasury bond prices eased, also in
very light activity, in response to oil's advance.</p>
<p>Traders bought currencies of countries that export oil and
have high interest rates. "The investment currencies are back
in vogue," said Robert White, manager of corporate
foreign-exchange trading at First Interstate Bank in Los
Angeles, referring to the British pound and the Canadian and
Australian dollars. Interest rates are higher in all three
countries, which also are oil exporters.</p>
<p>Mr. White said he was surprised that the dollar drew no
strength from news-service headlines early in the day that
the U.S. State Department viewed Iraq's conduct in Kuwait as
ominous. "The currency market is determined to take the
(U.S.) dollar down," he said.</p>
<p>Sal Gilbertie, oil futures trader at Merrill Lynch, said
oil rose because the likelihood of Mideast war seemed to be
reinforced by the Iraqi embassy violations and subsequent
saber rattling. In the oil futures market, "traders are
chanting, `$39 (a barrel) before $29,'" he said.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose. Big Board volume was 110.6 million
shares.</p>
<p>Bond prices fell 3/8 of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000
of face amount. The yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year
bond rose to 9.06%.</p>
