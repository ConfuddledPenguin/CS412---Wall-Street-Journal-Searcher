	<p class="article-leader">BOISE, Idaho -- On the margin, logging cutbacks in the
Northwest are shifting timber harvests eastward, into the
forested mountains from here through the Rockies. You might
think a wood-products executive whose office looks out toward
this supply lode would be delighted.
   Not Walter Minnick. The president/CEO of TJ International
(formerly Trus Joist) thinks those yields are uneconomic. He
says some timber sales in the region are subsidized 10 to 1,
even 20 to 1, by taxpayers. The U.S. Forest Service builds
roads for loggers and other users.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Minnick is not cut from the timber-industry mold. An
economics graduate of studious Whitman College near his
boyhood home in eastern Washington, he holds law and business
degrees from Harvard. And he is a member of the Wilderness
Society and the Idaho Conservation League, both of which he
credits with an economic approach to environmentalism.</p>
<p>Greens still lose most battles in this part of the
country. Resource industries hold sway, and with costs borne
nationwide, the politics favor logging even in this rough,
dry terrain. "The community enjoys jobs and prosperity," Mr.
Minnick explains. "It's no different from any other
subsidized local industry." Forest Service land accounts for
about half the intermountain West's timber, and Montana and
Idaho make up 20% of the total national-forest harvest.</p>
<p>In general, U.S. forestry companies rely on public lands
for the bulk of their timber supply. Add to that the
sentiment in logging towns and you get a consensus for
cutting, at least under Republican, pro-business
administrations.</p>
<p>But that's changing and his industry had better be ready
to make more out of less, Mr. Minnick says. He told
securities analysts in June that the Forest Service is "about
to be greened." A caucus within the agency, he elaborates, is
emerging to favor "non-consumptive uses." A Forest Service
biologist's report calling for halving the logging on public
lands in the Northwest to spare the spotted owl's "old
growth" habitat is the basis for wrangling within the Bush
administration currently. A Bush half step risks overruling
by the courts; last week, for instance, a U.S. circuit court
planted a legal sapling by blocking a cut that threatened no
species in particular but rather a "biological corridor"
between two wilderness areas.</p>
<p>Politically, too, the ground may shift against the
industry in the intermountain West just as it has along the
Pacific Coast. Boise, for example, is attracting white-collar
growth with its cleanliness, low crime and taxes, and access
to recreation.</p>
<p>Mr. Minnick has been nudging the process along. This
summer he sought to impress on a Republican congressional
hopeful just how subsidized the region's timber sales are.
"Hopefully, this information will be useful to you and other
free-enterprise, fiscal conservatives as you shape your
campaigns," he closed a letter.</p>
<p>If Mr. Minnick doesn't go along with the "commodity
ideology" toward natural resources that he says was
representative of the Reagan years -- timber yields in
national forests reached a historical peak in 1987 -- neither
does he support curbing exports of raw logs, a subissue of
the spotted-owl/old-growth forest fight. This cause is
spearheaded by Democratic Rep. Peter DeFazio and GOP Sen.
Robert Packwood, both of Oregon, who are aligned with the
greens and with U.S. millers pressed by foreign competition.</p>
<p>Here again, Mr. Minnick cites foresters' myopia. A
log-export ban, with the Bush administration's assent, has
now spread from harvests on federal land to most state
forests as well. His industry generally backed the new law,
he says -- "that's why it passed." Domestic companies
(including TJ International) both gain and lose by the
restriction, and see it heading off a similar ban being
applied to private lands, but Mr. Minnick thinks the whole
gambit is an inappropriate cover for failure to keep pace
with Japan at maximizing use of scarce resources in advanced
mills.</p>
<p>By toying with trade restrictions, Mr. Minnick said to the
analysts, the industry risks becoming "a fat boy sitting on a
fence just waiting to be knocked flat," like autos and steel.</p>
<p>In an interview, the avowed free trader argues, "Every
time you do something protectionist, you strengthen the
protectionists on the other side." He observes that the U.S.
often does that: It bans foreign-flag intracoastal shipping,
curbs dozens of import categories and, analogous to the
timber issue, restricts the export of Alaskan oil.</p>
<p>Yet TJ International was part of an industry petition to
have Japan cited as a violator of the "Super 301" trade law
for its barriers to American wood products. Mr. Minnick
squares this by saying that effective trade liberalization
should include a bit of bluster to get others to lower their
walls.</p>
<p>The Super 301 petition resulted in the U.S. negotiating a
reduction in Japan's tariffs on laminated veneer lumber (TJ's
mainstay, which the boss calls the "highest-tech wood product
on the market") to 3.9% from 20%. No sanctions were imposed.
Mr. Minnick says the trade law has been "used rather deftly
by an administration that is basically pro-free trade."</p>
<p>As a manufacturer of composite products, TJ International
is better positioned than many to prosper in a world of
scarcer materials. So, Mr. Minnick has an interest in his
supply pronouncements. But he says old-growth logs are
important to TJ, too -- they provide critical strength to the
wood-frame home construction that, along with customized wood
windows, is its business. It may have to "reconfigure"
output, even as it scrambles along with the rest of the U.S.
industry to shift operations to the timberlands of the
Southeast.</p>
<p>Mr. Minnick, 48 this week, sees the downturn in Northwest
logging as inevitable. Rapid cutting of private lands in the
1950s and '60s moved on to public lands in the '70s and '80s.
(In California, private harvests are still the rage as three
ballot measures to limit logging approach in November.) Mr.
Minnick says a dawning deficiency of West Coast timber is
unlikely to be made up until the "second-growth" plantings on
the private lands are ready in nearly 20 years. In the
Rockies belt, the cut is about what it was in 1970, but with
improved transport options its value as a replacement source
for timber grows.</p>
<p>Mr. Minnick doesn't want the stuff below cost, courtesy of
Uncle Sam. It isn't easy being big-minded in his business
right now: Though TJ International, above $350 million in
annual sales, aspires to make the Fortune 500, its income has
been off the past two years and the housing slump only gets
worse. But the CEO is undaunted. Of the whole industry, he
says, "The less government is involved, the stronger we will
be long term."</p>
<p>Does he really mean that? No breaks at the sales end,
either? Other than housing vouchers for the poor, yes, he
says. And no concocted lending institutions, like the
thrifts. TJ's bread and butter is the upscale new home, a
market whose foundation is the tax-deductible mortgage. What
about that? It's a subsidy, he concedes, and as part of an
overall addressing of federal largess, he'll put it on the
table, as they say in D.C. Few guys in the building business
will go as far with a level.</p>
