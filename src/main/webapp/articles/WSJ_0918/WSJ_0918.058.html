	<p class="article-leader">As their supporters kill each other in South Africa's
black townships, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and Nelson
Mandela fight a daily war of words. Mr. Buthelezi, who claims
that his Inkatha organization represents the nation's 7
million Zulus, resisted every request from the Pretoria
government to negotiate so long as Nelson Mandela was
imprisoned. Never modest, Mr. Buthelezi now says, "I have
probably done more than any other single black leader to
create circumstances in which you {Mr. Mandela} could
eventually be released." Nevertheless, this history is not
helping him with Mr. Mandela. On at least 50 occasions, Mr.
Buthelezi has called on Mr. Mandela to meet with him, but the
visit has never come about.
   Mr. Mandela's African National Congress appears to have
instigated the current round of violence, in which nearly 800
people have been killed in and around Johannesburg over the
past two months. The violence began on July 22, when ANC
supporters gathered outside a stadium where Zulu hostel
dwellers were holding a legal Inkatha rally, and threw stones
and petrol bombs at them. After the rally, police escorted
seven busloads of Zulus back to their hostel, where they were
ambushed: At least 19 people died that day. Ever since, both
sides have justified their atrocities as "self-defense."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some of the tension between the ANC and Mr. Buthelezi
originates in the chief's strenuous opposition to
international sanctions against South Africa. Mr. Buthelezi
said in 1988, "What {the people} want is economic,
educational and social upliftment, not poverty, ignorance and
disease. They want jobs, not hunger." When Mobil Oil pulled
out of South Africa last year, he said: "Every act of
withdrawal is seen by us as a vote in favor of revolution."</p>
<p>But Mr. Buthelezi is no stooge for apartheid. As chief
minister of the homeland "state" of KwaZulu, he refused to
accept "independence," and he is credited with thwarting
Pretoria's plan to turn the 10 homelands into foreign
countries and thus deprive blacks of their South African
citizenship. And he has steadfastly called for one-person,
one-vote Western democracy.</p>
<p>What bothers the ANC, most of whose leaders belong to the
Xhosa tribe, is that Mr. Buthelezi wants South Africa to be
not just ruled by the black majority, but to enjoy a free
enterprise economy with lots of checks and balances on
government. During his meeting with President Bush earlier
this year, Mr. Buthelezi criticized the ANC's insistence on a
"one-off, big-bang approach" to negotiations with a
"winner-take-all" victory. He frankly addresses white fears:
"We are not anti-white. We are just anti-apartheid."</p>
<p>"Run-of-the-mill white South Africans, by and large,
prefer Buthelezi, compared with the radical elements in the
ANC and the South African Communist Party," says Helen
Suzman, a leading anti-apartheid activist who retired last
year after 36 years in parliament. "I'm considered the
classical liberal," says Zach de Beer, leader of the
Democratic Party, "but he's never made a policy statement I
didn't agree with."</p>
<p>"He is far more realistic than the ANC," Mrs. Suzman says.
"He has a far better understanding of the urgent necessity
for economic growth and overseas investment here from running
an impoverished black area." The ANC flirts with
nationalization, but Mr. Buthelezi has resoundingly rejected
it. "I do not talk the language of nationalization because it
is fatal talk." But he is a politician with a constituency to
please, a poor, black, rural constituency. He says that
ownership of non-residential land is a "privilege for those
who can use it productively." He gives nods to a "mixed
economy," "constructive redistribution of wealth" and "a
whole range of support systems," although specifics have not
been forthcoming.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is this vagueness that causes even Mr.
Buthelezi's ardent admirers to have reservations about the
man. His personality is part of the problem: "He's the most
prickly, hypersensitive man I've ever known," Mr. de Beer
says. When he visited exiled ANC leaders in Zambia, Mr. de
Beer asked them whether they opposed Mr. Buthelezi because he
led KwaZulu and was therefore a "bantustan puppet"? No, they
replied, what bothered them was Mr. Buthelezi's insistence on
reminding everyone of his royal blood. (He traces his
ancestry to Shaka, founder of the Zulu nation.) "They told
me, `he wants to be treated like a god, and we won't do it.'"</p>
<p>It's well known in the South African press that any story
about Mr. Buthelezi that even hints at criticism comes in for
at least a blistering attack, if not a lawsuit. A few days
after David Webster, a white leftist activist, was gunned
down in front of his home last year, Mr. Buthelezi wrote to
one publication to attack Mr. Webster for calling Inkatha a
"Contra-type organization." Mr. Buthelezi did, at least,
apologize for his timing.</p>
<p>"I'd say there is a bottomless contempt for Buthelezi in
newsrooms, but it's never reflected in publications," says
Stephen Robinson, a London Daily Telegraph correspondent who
wrote what he thought was a positive piece on Mr. Buthelezi
that appeared in Frontline magazine. But Mr. Buthelezi sued
for defamation. "South African newspapers always cave in on
Buthelezi." So Denis Beckett, the editor and publisher of
Frontline, decided to fight Mr. Buthelezi in court. Mr.
Beckett and Frontline lost. "And he didn't have the bloody
grace to relinquish the 12,000 rand $4,700 fine," Mr.
Beckett says.</p>
<p>Like other journalists, Mr. Beckett fears that Mr.
Buthelezi is schizophrenic in his belief in non-totalitarian
ideals. "One minute he can be quite genuine about wanting
multi-party democracy and the next minute, if someone stands
up in the KwaZulu legislature and says they oppose Inkatha,
he says, `Stick it, man.'"</p>
<p>Above all, Mr. Buthelezi hates to be marginalized or
ignored. "Inkatha is now a force to be dealt with that cannot
be wished away," he says. "We have a role to play which we
will play, come hell or high water." That statement is the
core of his supporters' defense of Mr. Buthelezi.</p>
<p>"We're not saying he's a libertarian," says Russell
Crystal, executive director of the South African branch of
the International Freedom Foundation, a free-market think
tank based in Washington. But, Mr. Crystal adds, "a
socio-economic reorganization is a must, and I believe he
will allow the market to do it."</p>
<p>Since February 2, when President F.W. de Klerk unbanned
all political organizations, Mr. Buthelezi has had to compete
in the open market for supporters. That task is getting
harder as his rural Zulu people have been moving into the
urban centers and joining the big trade unions, which are
mostly ANC-aligned. He has been urged to modernize, to drop
his royalist and tribal trappings, in an effort to appeal to
younger Zulus and to whites. The formation of the new Inkatha
Freedom Party is seen as a move to that direction.</p>
<p>So an old joke has begun re-circulating in South Africa:
The definition of an optimist is a white man learning Zulu; a
pessimist is a white man learning Xhosa.</p>
