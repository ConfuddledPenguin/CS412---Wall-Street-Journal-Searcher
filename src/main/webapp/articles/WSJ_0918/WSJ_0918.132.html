	<p class="article-leader">Randall D. Hubbard, who recently acquired a 9.9% stake in
Hollywood Park Operating Co., called for the retirement of
Marjorie L. Everett, the Inglewood, Calif. race track's
chairman and chief executive officer.
   In a letter to company directors dated Thursday and filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Hubbard
proposed that he succeed the 68-year-old Mrs. Everett "who
should resign before the next annual meeting." He also asked
to be added to the board along with four of his designees.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It is my intention to devote substantial personal time
and effort toward the revitalization of Hollywood Park," said
Mr. Hubbard, who is also president of AFG Industries Inc. in
Fort Worth, Texas. "I believe that the interests of all the
shareholders require that fundamental changes be made in the
operation."</p>
<p>Mrs. Everett couldn't be reached. A company spokesman said
he couldn't comment beyond noting that the company must hold
its annual meeting within the next four months.</p>
<p>Mr. Hubbard said he wanted board representation last month
after he disclosed his holdings in Hollywood Park and in
Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises Inc., which owns the track.
Hollywood Park Operating manages the track. The companies'
stocks are paired for trading.</p>
<p>In the letter, Mr. Hubbard said he hoped to avoid the need
for spending substantial amounts of time and money on both
sides in a proxy contest. He urged the directors to consider
his proposals at their next meeting.</p>
