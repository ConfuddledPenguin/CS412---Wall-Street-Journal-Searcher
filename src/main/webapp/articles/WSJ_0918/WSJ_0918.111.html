	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush renewed his call for lower
capital-gains tax rates as budget negotiators continued to
haggle over the price Democrats will demand for agreeing to
such a tax cut.
   Last night, people close to the negotiations said that the
Democrats and Republicans had reached an impasse over the
capital-gains questions -- a development, they said, that
threatened to make further deliberations fruitless. The best
chance for a quick compromise, the sources indicated, was the
kind of change in bargaining position that only President
Bush and the Democratic leaders of the House and Senate could
authorize.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Indicating that he isn't letting the divisive subject die
as negotiations drag on, Mr. Bush yesterday called for a
deficit-reduction package "that is oriented toward growth . .
. one which contains incentives like the capital-gains tax
cut, which I am absolutely convinced will create jobs."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the closed-door budget talks at Andrews Air
Force Base continued, Democrats modified their plan to pair
the cut in capital-gains tax rates with an increase in taxes
on the upper-income Americans who would most benefit from
such a tax cut.</p>
<p>The Democrats dropped a proposal to raise the marginal
income-tax rate for the richest Americans to 35% from the
current 28%, and substituted a broader version of an
income-tax surcharge they proposed earlier, people close to
the talks said.</p>
<p>Although details of the new proposal weren't immediately
available, individuals familiar with the negotiations
indicated it would impose a 21% surcharge that would kick in
somewhere below $250,000. That would be the equivalent of a
33.8% tax rate. Democrats previously proposed a 20% surcharge
on incomes above $500,000.</p>
<p>Republicans were no more receptive to the surcharge idea
than they were to a simple increase in the top tax rate.
"Generally speaking, a surtax is an increase in rates," said
House Republican Leader Robert Michel of Illinois. "That's
not one of our favorite things to do."</p>
<p>On Sunday, Republicans responded to the Democrats' first
formal offer to accept lower capital-gains tax rates with a
plan to limit all tax deductions for taxpayers making more
than $200,000 a year. Democrats haven't agreed to that
approach.</p>
<p>The proposal would shave a couple's total deductions by 1%
for every $2,000 in additional income above $200,000 up to
$250,000, people familiar with the proposal say. That is, a
couple with $224,000 in income could take only 88% of their
total deductions. Deductions would be further limited for
couples with incomes above $475,000.</p>
<p>At last night's meeting, Democrats were prepared to
propose a new approach under which they would drop their
demands for a variety of new spending initiatives if
Republicans would abandon their pursuit of a capital-gains
tax cut. A person close to the talks said Democrats expected
Republicans to be no more receptive to that proposal than
they have been to the others.</p>
<p>Democrats' opening offer Sept. 7 to cut $500 billion over
five years represented net savings. They proposed $622.5
billion in total deficit reduction, but included $106.4
billion for new spending proposals covering education,
science, transportation, environmental cleanup and other
social programs important to Democrats.</p>
<p>House Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.) yesterday once
again raised the possibility that despite Mr. Bush's
statements a deficit-reduction compromise might exclude both
the capital-gains tax cut and any offsetting tax increases
aimed at upper-income taxpayers.</p>
<p>Republicans have proposed setting the maximum
capital-gains tax rate at 15%; Democrats have countered with
a 23.1% rate, aides say. Currently, capital gains are taxed
at a maximum rate of 33%.</p>
<p>As talks dragged through an 11th day, lawmakers began
discussing the need for stopgap legislation to keep
government programs funded after the Oct. 1 start of fiscal
1991. Congress has been proceeding with regular
appropriations bills, but final action awaits the budget
summit's outcome. Even if agreement is reached soon, it
couldn't be put into effect in time to avoid at least a
short-term emergency spending bill, a Democratic leadership
aide said.</p>
<p>Rep. Michel and Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, the
top Republican on the House Appropriations Committee, also
suggested that Democratic leaders would move to delay the
imposition of across-the-board budget cuts, which by law
would take effect after Oct. 1 if the projected 1991 deficit
hadn't been reduced before then. But the Democratic aide said
any such proposal would be hard to pass, since lawmakers
would fear such action would relieve the pressure on the
administration and congressional leaders to reach a budget
accord.</p>
<p>President Bush, speaking at the White House to out-of-town
reporters, also said that Congress must "enact real spending
cuts, not these smoke-and-mirror cuts that simply don't cut
spending as advertised."</p>
<p>The president asserted that there isn't a national
recession under way, and added: "But I do think that a budget
agreement is the best antidote to further economic slowdown,
because I think it'll result in lower interest rates and a
renewed sense of confidence in investment in America, both of
which are necessary to guarantee a more robust growth."</p>
