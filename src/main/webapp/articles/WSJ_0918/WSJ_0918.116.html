	<p class="article-leader">NEW ORLEANS -- Exxon Corp. disclosed it has started a $1
billion development of its deep natural gas reserves in
Mobile Bay, offshore Alabama that should lead to production
in late 1993.
   The company said its Exxon USA unit started construction
in March of a 300-million cubic feet per day onshore gas
treatment facility, and has awarded major contracts for other
key parts of the project. The development will include three
offshore production platforms, 36 miles of pipelines to
connect the platforms and the treatment plant, and the
drilling of six new wells. Six existing wells are also being
completed. The wells are being drilled to an average depth of
22,000 feet.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When completed, the Exxon development will be the largest
of three offshore natural gas projects currently under way in
that area, according to John H. Steele, Exxon USA Eastern
Production Division manager. Mobil Corp. and Shell Oil Co.
also are developing reserves there, he said. Mr. Steele said
Exxon began acquiring leases in the area in 1981 and has so
far invested about $1 billion there. The estimated productive
life of the wells is 30 to 35 years.</p>
<p>Production platforms in 15-to-45-foot deep Alabama waters
will be connected to the gas treatment facility in south
Mobile County where hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide will
be removed to prepare the gas for sale. Exxon said H.B.
Zachry Co. of San Antonio, Texas, was awarded the primary gas
treatment plant contract and Stearns-Roger Inc. of Denver,
Colo., was named engineering subcontractor. Value of the
contracts wasn't disclosed.</p>
