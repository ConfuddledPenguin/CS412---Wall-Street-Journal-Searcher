	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices closed mixed in sluggish trading,
but ended the session on an upswing as another surge in the
price of oil rekindled buying interest in the energy sector.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.22 to 2567.33, but
gains in Exxon, Chevron and Texaco more than accounted for
the advance; the performance of the three oil stocks lifted
the average by nearly six points.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Broader market indexes also posted modest gains. Standard
& Poor's 500-Stock Index went up 0.94 to 317.77, the New York
Stock Exchange Composite Index rose 0.47 to 174.62 and the
Dow Jones Equity Market Index added 0.79 to 294.40.</p>
<p>But declining issues led advancers on the Big Board by 768
to 681, and traders said the market remained plagued by
uncertainty regarding the Persian Gulf situation and the
deficit-reduction talks.</p>
<p>"Nobody wants to make any commitments for fear that
they're going to be wrong tomorrow," said James C. Andrews,
first vice president in charge of institutional trading at
Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Only 110,600,000 shares were traded, down from 133,390,000
shares Friday. Concerns about today's reports on the August
consumer price index and the July trade deficit also kept
investors out of the market, traders said.</p>
<p>Both reports are expected to reflect the impact of higher
oil prices, even though the July trade data was collected
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The CPI is expected to show an increase of 0.8%, with
prices excluding food and energy up 0.4%, according to a
consensus of economists polled by Dow Jones Capital Markets
Report. The July trade deficit is expected to widen to $7.3
billion from $5.1 billion in June, with a rise in oil imports
accounting for the move.</p>
<p>Although analysts have cited oil prices as a key influence
on the market recently, stocks declined only briefly in the
latest session as crude-oil futures surged to the highest
levels in New York trading since being introduced in 1983.
October futures ended the session at $33.63 a barrel, up
$1.87.</p>
<p>Jon Groveman, president of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Co., said
the previous surges in oil prices blunted the impact of the
latest advance on the market. "A lot of people who wanted to
react to that {rally} already have done so," Mr. Groveman
says.</p>
<p>Scattered bargain-hunting by institutional investors
helped the market recover its initial losses, traders said.
Stocks then proceeded to spend most of the session drifting
within tight trading ranges; buying in the final hour pushed
prices to session highs.</p>
<p>Chevron advanced 1 3/4 to 77 5/8, while Texaco rose 7/8 to
65 3/8 and Exxon gained 1/4 to 51 5/8. Among other oil
stocks, Mobil added 1 to 66 1/2, Amoco added 1 1/8 to 58 3/8,
Unocal rose 1 to 33 1/4 and Atlantic Richfield climbed 1 3/4
to 141 5/8. Within the oilfield-services sector, Halliburton
rallied 1 1/4 to 55 7/8, Schlumberger went up 1/4 to 66 1/2
and Parker Drilling jumped 3/4 to 8 3/4.</p>
<p>Similarly, precious-metals stocks took their direction
from gold prices; October gold futures rose $4.20 an ounce,
to $390.60 in New York trading. Homestake Mining went up 5/8
to 20 1/2, Newmont Mining rose 7/8 to 43 7/8 and Placer Dome
added 1/4 to 17 3/8.</p>
<p>Digital Equipment, which fell 9 7/8 last week as the
company cautioned against expecting any quick turnaround in
its fortunes, rebounded 1/4 to 56 5/8 in composite trading of
1.6 million shares. But Digital traded as low as 54 during
the session, and The Wall Street Journal reported in
yesterday's "Heard on the Street" column that few analysts
are willing to bet it has hit bottom.</p>
<p>International Business Machines gained 3/4 to 105 1/8. IBM
and Microsoft are expected to realign some of their
responsibilities for the development of the OS/2 operating
system for personal computers, which has flopped so far, the
Journal reported.</p>
<p>Unisys went down 1/4 to 7 7/8 in active trading, and other
key technology stocks also headed lower. Hewlett-Packard
dropped 3/8 to 32 3/4, Compaq Computer dipped 1/2 to 43 5/8,
Cray Research slipped 3/4 to 34 5/8 and Control Data lost 7/8
to 11 5/8.</p>
<p>UAL slipped 1 5/8 to 97 3/8. A group of unions at its
United Airlines unit is likely to abandon its most recent
buy-out offer -- valued at $201 a share, or $4.38 billion --
and may submit another, lower bid, the Journal reported.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas fell 1 7/8 to 50. Smith Barney, Harris
Upham downgraded its investment rating on the stock to
"avoid" from "hold."</p>
<p>American Home Products gained 3/4 to 48. As expected, the
company reached an agreement to help MicroGeneSys in
developing VaxSyn HIV-1, an experimental AIDS vaccine. Of
three vaccines now under intense study, VaxSyn has undergone
the most advanced human tests.</p>
<p>U.S. Surgical jumped 2 5/8 to 56 1/2. Salomon Brothers
upgraded its rating on the stock, which the firm expects to
outperform the market, and increased its earnings estimates
for 1990, 1991 and 1992 by 10 cents, 20 cents and 70 cents a
share -- to $1.65, $2.10 and $3, respectively.</p>
<p>Capital Holding rose 1/4 to 35. The company said it plans
to repurchase up to two million common shares, including
about 550,000 shares to be bought through its employee
pension fund.</p>
<p>Apple Bancorp, which dropped its opposition to a
$38-a-share takeover bid from New York real estate investor
Stanley Stahl, tacked on 3/8 to 33 1/8. The bank holding
company said it is now taking a neutral position on the
offer.</p>
<p>Paired certificates of Hotel Investors Trust and Hotel
Investors Corp. gained 5/8 to 3 1/2. First West Capital is
offering $5 each for the securities in a takeover offer.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index rose 0.26
to 321.71. Volume totaled 9,810,000 shares.</p>
