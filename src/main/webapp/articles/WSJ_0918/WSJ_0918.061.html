	<p class="article-leader">I read with great interest your informative Aug. 14
page-one article on repairing bad credit ratings. Recently,
the credit records of a person with a name similar to mine
were merged into my credit files. As a result, I was harassed
by a collection agency, denied credit and failed a background
investigation by my new employer. It took me a year to have
my credit-bureau records corrected.
   The credit-reporting abuses that the article described and
that I experienced are the result of major loopholes in the
Fair Credit Reporting Act. Reps. Schumer, Rinaldo and Lehman
have introduced separate bills to strengthen the act. Until
this happens, creditors, credit bureaus and collection
agencies will be able to continue to traffic in false
consumer-credit information with impunity.</p>
