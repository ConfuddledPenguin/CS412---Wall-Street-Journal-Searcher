	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Toby S. Myerson resigned as head of
Wasserstein Perella & Co.'s Tokyo office, and will be
succeeded by a former executive of Nomura Securities Co.,
which owns 20% of Wasserstein Perella.
   The appointment of Shin Kijima, currently a managing
director at Wasserstein Perella, comes after more than a year
of rumors that the relationship is strained between the
merger boutique and Nomura. A spokesman for Wasserstein
Perella denied the rumors, but added: "Mr. Kijima, in his new
position, strengthens the ties between Wasserstein Perella
and Nomura."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Though Wasserstein Perella has worked on a number of
medium-sized merger deals involving Japanese companies, it
hasn't participated in any Japan-U.S. transactions valued at
$1 billion or more, unlike several of its competitors.</p>
<p>Mr. Myerson, who held the post at the merger boutique for
about 15 months, will return as a partner to the law firm of
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, where he was a
partner before he joined Wasserstein Perella in June 1989.</p>
<p>"We are sad to see {Mr. Myerson} leave our Tokyo effort as
a result of his desire to return to New York, but he will
remain a valued friend and adviser," said Joseph R. Perella,
chairman of Wasserstein Perella.</p>
<p>Mr. Kijima, 40, has worked for Wasserstein Perella in New
York for the past two years, and will move to Tokyo in his
new post. Previously, Mr. Kijima was president of Nomura Bank
(Switzerland) Ltd.</p>
<p>Wasserstein Perella also named Yoshitaka Kitao, a managing
director of the firm, as head of its Japanese international
advisory business in London.</p>
