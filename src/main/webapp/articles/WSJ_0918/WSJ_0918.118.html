	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- For weeks, the banking community here has been
buzzing with rumors about a big new problem in First City
Bancorp of Texas' real estate loan portfolio.
   That's certainly nothing out of the ordinary for a
medium-sized Texas bank during these troubled times. Except
this real estate loan, totaling some $100 million, happens to
be in Spain. And, although it still is classified as a
performing loan, the credit has raised new questions about
whether First City, under the management of former Chicago
banker A. Robert Abboud, misled investors by characterizing
the bank as a pure play on the recovering Texas economy.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The problem you've got is that the investment community
was under the impression that Abboud was making Texas loans,"
says Frank Anderson, an analyst with Stephens Inc., a Little
Rock, Ark., investment banking firm. "This is not a market
where you want surprises."</p>
<p>Surprises, unfortunately, have been plentiful at First
City in the last several months. First, a string of
high-profile out-of-state borrowers such as Federated
Department Stores Inc. and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. filed
for bankruptcy-law protection. First City started falling
short of the ambitious earnings projections Mr. Abboud made
in 1988, when he led a $1.5 billion, federally assisted
recapitalization. And last week, First City rocked Wall
Street with the news that it is considering seeking a
minority partner to raise money to redeem an expensive
preferred stock issue.</p>
<p>The disclosure has already led to speculation that Mr.
Abboud wants to auction off the whole bank, which he firmly
denies. But the fact remains that a big squad of BankAmerica
Corp. officials has been combing through First City's books.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rumors have crushed First City's stock
price. After closing at $19.125 per share on the Big Board
Tuesday, First City's price went into a free fall, winding up
at $14.50 at Friday's close.</p>
<p>First City shares, which closed unchanged yesterday, are
trading at less than half their $39.50 high last fall, and at
a discount to the company's $36.78 per-share book value,
normally visited upon banks with serious loan-quality
problems.</p>
<p>But according to First City's latest public financial
statements, non-performing assets totaled $199 million, or
only 2.5% of loans and foreclosed real estate as of June 30,
while the allowance for loan losses stood at $148 million.
Although the problem assets were double the year-earlier
figure of $100 million, or 1.33%, the numbers still don't
suggest a bank in deep trouble. "I stare in disbelief at the
Quotron," says Thomas McCandless, a banking analyst with
Goldman Sachs & Co., who says he thinks the market "grossly"
overreacted to last week's news.</p>
<p>Alex. Brown & Sons' Sandra Flannigan, a long-time bear on
First City, was similarly perplexed about the company's
stock-price plummet. "I'm not getting any sense any new
catastrophe is on the horizon," she says.</p>
<p>If there is a Trojan horse somewhere, say analysts, it is
in First City's Collecting Bank, the entity set up at the
time of the April 1988 recapitalization to liquidate bad
loans made by previous management. According to the terms of
the bailout, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. agreed to
pay fixed assistance of no more than $920 million to plug the
gap between the bad assets' book value and market value.</p>
<p>On June 30, 1989, First City predicted Collecting Bank
would be able to liquidate all the assets and still have $115
million to $165 million left over. But collections have
slowed significantly in recent quarters, thanks in part to
the continued distress of the Southwestern real estate
market, and now First City estimates the cushion is just $25
million to $50 million.</p>
<p>By contrast, later entrants to the Texas market such as
NCNB Corp., Charlotte, N.C., and Banc One Corp., Columbus,
Ohio, received much cushier deals in which regulators
essentially agreed to assume the risk that the value of bad
assets might decline.</p>
<p>But First City's biggest problem right now is credibility.
Investors have lambasted Mr. Abboud's management team for
straying too far outside Texas in search of quick profits,
instead of concentrating on the improving market at home. The
Spanish credit, say critics, was a prime example. The loan
began, according to knowledgeable persons, as a plan to make
some quick fee income by helping the prominent Coca family of
Madrid out of a financial tangle left behind when the
patriarch, Ignacio Coca, committed suicide a few years ago.</p>
<p>When lenders threatened to foreclose on some of the
family's extensive real estate holdings, including a luxury
hotel in Marbella, on the Mediterranean, First City agreed to
refinance the loans and supervise an orderly sell-off of the
property. By helping the Cocas, say knowledgeable persons,
First City hoped to win the family as customers of its trust
department.</p>
<p>First City got Citicorp, which has a Spanish subsidiary,
to issue the loan and backstopped it with a letter of credit.
But when the family was slow to sell its property, First City
was called on to perform on the letter, sticking it with a
big real estate loan abroad.</p>
<p>According to several people, First City already has found
a buyer for two Marbella hotel properties; these people say
the buyer has in recent days plunked down a $9 million,
nonrefundable deposit on the hotels and expects to close the
purchase soon. The total value of the collateral is at least
double the loan value, sources say.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Abboud is said to be rueful that the deal was
done in the first place and has been stung by criticism of
his constant globe-trotting. In the past two years, Mr.
Abboud has traveled tens of thousands of miles and visited
with numerous heads of state, including Iraq's Saddam
Hussein, in an effort to build First City into an
international banking force.</p>
<p>Now, the one-time chairman of First Chicago Corp. is quick
to point out that 93% of First City's loans are in Texas, and
96% are in the U.S. He emphasizes that the bank's
international department is primarily in the business of
helping Texas customers finance foreign trade -- not the sort
of high risk, lesser-developed country credits that have
gotten so many U.S. banks in trouble overseas.</p>
<p>"This is a Texas bank," he says flatly. And to symbolize
his intention to stick to home cooking, Mr. Abboud has told
investors he'll try to sell both of First City's corporate
jets.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Abboud also bravely argues that First
City doesn't have to redeem the $125 million preferred stock
issue that triggered his search for partners. Although the
stock is scheduled to start paying an extremely high dividend
of prime plus six percentage points next April, the dividend
could easily be paid out of projected earnings, he says. "The
beauty is, we don't have to do anything."</p>
<p>But, given the market's skepticism of late, if First City
doesn't attract an investor after opening its books to
prospective partners, everybody will assume the worst.</p>
<p>"I can guarantee what investors will say," says Mr.
Anderson, of Stephens. "They're going to say, `they looked at
your portfolio, didn't like what they saw, and walked away.'"</p>
