	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal savings and loan bailout
officials said Monday they were canceling the much-promoted
international satellite auction of million-dollar properties
inherited from bankrupt savings and loans.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Resolution Trust
Corp., said the auction was canceled after the Auction Co. of
America, which the agency had hired, did not contribute to a
joint fund promoting the event.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The group we contracted with couldn't fulfill their end
of the deal," Mr. Seidman said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Jim Gall, chairman of the Miami-based Auction Co. of
America, disputed Mr. Seidman and accused the bailout agency
of bungling the auction. He said the firm has spent nearly $2
million over four months to prepare for the event, about what
it was obligated to spend.</p>
<p>The auction was to be held Nov. 15 in Dallas with
satellite hookups to bidders in nine other U.S. cities as
well as Tokyo and London.</p>
<p>The RTC had hoped to sell 71 properties valued at $300
million. The auction was a centerpiece for what the agency
had billed as its "great fall inventory clearance sale" aimed
at drastically slimming its ballooning inventory of S&L
assets.</p>
<p>"We hope to start over. . . . It's going to slow us up a
little but, but I don't think it's a major blow," Mr. Seidman
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gall faulted the RTC for failing to set minimum prices
for the properties and for withdrawing three properties from
the auction list and selling them using other methods.</p>
<p>Mr. Gall said potential buyers must have some assurance
the properties will remain on the auction list or they will
be unwilling to spend thousands of dollars on the
environmental, engineering and appraisal reports needed to
offer an intelligent bid.</p>
