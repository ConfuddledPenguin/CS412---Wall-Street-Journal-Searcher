	<p class="article-leader">Reading Barbara D. Phillips's perceptive description of
the public-education bureaucracy ("Off to the Education
Front," editorial page, Aug. 17) made me want to write from
the front about my most recent encounter with "the Blob."
Perhaps my experience may serve as a cautionary tale for
members of Teach for America.
   I have taught English in New York City and Omaha public
schools for the past 13 years. Recently I won a National
Endowment for the Humanities Teacher-Scholar Award. The
Teacher-Scholar Program is governed by the conviction that
students benefit most when teachers have a mastery of the
subjects they teach and are, like other professionals,
actively engaged in their fields. One teacher from each of
the 50 states is selected on the basis of exceptional
teaching and scholarship. A stipend of $27,500 accompanies
the award to replace the teacher's salary or supplement
sabbatical pay and allow him to devote a year to full-time
research in his field.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At the end of the year the teacher returns to the
classroom, intellectually revitalized and eager to pass along
what he has learned to both students and colleagues. The
example of his scholarship is a model to his students; his
own fascination with what he teaches is contagious. The
program is thus one of the few now offering hope of real
educational reform from within the system itself. Enter "the
Blob."</p>
<p>When I told the administrators of my school district that
I won the award, they said that in order to accept it I would
have to take a year's leave of absence without pay. This
meant facing a significant cut in salary and paying my own
medical-insurance premiums -- something that has now put our
family of five on or just above the national poverty level.
The local teachers' union echoed the district's position:
There is nothing that can be done; the contract has no
provision for teachers winning national teaching awards. Are
they afraid that too many other teachers will win and
bankrupt the system?</p>
<p>I suppose someone outside public education or a young
teacher just starting out might think that an educator
nationally recognized for excellence in teaching and
scholarship would, perhaps now more than ever, be a welcome
asset to the public schools. "The Blob" obviously thinks
otherwise. Let the members of Teach for America be
forewarned.</p>
