	<p class="article-leader">Your Aug. 14 Heard on the Street, "Pension Expense May
Drag Down '90s Corporate Profits," missed the biggest single
reason for fluctuation in pension expense from 1982 to 1989.
A change in accounting method propelled companies toward low
pension expense with an inevitable uptrend of pension expense
in years following the adoption of the new method.
   The Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 87
required adoption of this new policy in fiscal 1987, though
many companies adopted in 1986 and a few in 1985. It is easy
to see from the chart in the article the enormous drop in
1986 expense for companies that found it advantageous to
adopt FAS No. 87 early. Virtually every client of ours that
forecast pension expense at the time saw an immediate
substantial decrease in pension expense followed by a
gradually increasing expense in future years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The statement required acceleration of gains in the market
value of pension assets that had accumulated from the late
1970s and the 1980s. For most companies the rules also
required a less conservative (lower) measurement of liability
accompanied by less conservative actuarial assumptions. The
analyst you quoted commented that pension costs cannot go to
zero. In fact, many public companies have experienced
negative pension expense -- positive pension income -- in
recent years, mostly due to this accounting change.</p>
<p>The rules also allowed accumulated benefits of the change
in policy to be recognized in one year if liabilities were
settled with a third party such as an insurance company. This
approach was used widely by banks to offset losses due to
write-down of nonperforming loans, as well as by other
companies that were capturing surplus pension assets through
reversions.</p>
<p>Your conclusion appears correct. Pension expense will
increase in the future and may drag down 1990's corporate
profits. Given the FASB requirements, this should not be a
surprise to analysts.</p>
