	<p class="article-leader">Chyron Corp., Melville, N.Y., filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, as
it said it would last week.
   The maker of computer video graphic equipment, caught in a
dispute between its two major lenders, said it couldn't repay
$10 million in loans called by Manufacturers Hanover Trust
Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chyron was hoping to restructure loans and obtain
additional financing, but Manufacturers Hanover and Chyron's
other major lender, European American Bank, couldn't come to
terms on sharing loan collateral. Manufacturers Hanover
recently sued European American, charging fraud and breach of
contract in the dispute. Chyron also was named in the suit,
but Manufacturers isn't seeking any relief from Chyron.
European American has $20 million in loans outstanding to
Chyron.</p>
<p>"I feel like an innocent bystander shot in a subway," said
Alfred O.P. Leubert, Chyron's chairman. "It's a wrong that
should be righted."</p>
<p>Chyron officials said the company, in its filing for
Chapter 11 protection in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn,
N.Y., listed assets of $57 million and liabilites of $41
million.</p>
<p>Chyron, which employs 355, had a net loss of $1.9 million
on revenue of $44.1 million in 1989.</p>
