	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Attention all yuppies and yachtsmen,
homeowners and double homeowners, high-paid Hawaiians and
well-off North Dakotans: The deficit cutters in the White
House and Congress are eyeing your tax deductions.
   They are looking at the deduction for contributions to
charity so prized by universities, at the deduction for state
and local income-tax payments so dear to residents of many
states, even at the precious deduction for mortgage-interest
expense that saves homeowners nearly $50 billion in federal
taxes every year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Right now, more than $100 billion a year worth of tax
breaks, most of which go to subsidize the life styles of
upper-income Americans, are on the table at the bipartisan
budget talks under way at the officers' club at Andrews Air
Force Base outside Washington. No one is talking about wiping
out deductions altogether, but there is plenty of talk in
Congress to limit them, particularly for well-off taxpayers.</p>
<p>The latest assault on deductions is being led by President
Bush and his fellow Republicans, who are looking for a way to
cajole Democrats into accepting a cut in the capital-gains
tax without increasing the tax rate on upper-income
taxpayers. Over the weekend, White House negotiators
suggested limiting tax deductions for the approximately
600,000 taxpayers with incomes of more than $200,000 a year.</p>
<p>Whether the Democrats will go along is unclear. But the
proposal at least plays to their desire to make the affluent
pay. Indeed, some Democrats have even suggested trimming
deductions for all families earning more than $100,000 a year
and single people earning more than $50,000.</p>
<p>"I'll do anything to go after the pocketbooks of those who
have been enjoying themselves for the last decade," House
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat
of Illinois, said before the latest round of budget talks
began two weeks ago.</p>
<p>For affluent Americans, deductions are among the last
remaining respites from the tax man. George Bush, for
instance, shaved $26,370 off his federal income-tax bill last
year with various deductions -- and he doesn't even have a
mortgage. According to a copy of their 1989 tax return
released by the White House, the Bushes reported income of
$483,030. They claimed deductions exceeding $94,000 --
including $19,500 for real-estate taxes, $37,900 in gifts to
charity and $28,900 for legal and financial advice.</p>
<p>If deductions come under widespread attack,
less-well-to-do Americans would feel the bite as well. "I
wouldn't be destitute, but it would certainly crimp things,"
says Robert Gould Jr., 39, a consultant with KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accounting firm. He and his wife, a 38-year old
art consultant, bought a Colonial house in Westport, Conn.,
two years ago. Mortgage payments consume a quarter of their
combined income. In particular, Mr. Gould fears he won't be
able to save the money he will need to send his two children
to private universities.</p>
<p>"The ones who would be affected by this are people in our
age group, people who are in the formative stage of building
their wealth," Mr. Gould says. His fix to the nation's fiscal
crisis: "Cut spending. Period."</p>
<p>Curtailing deductions just might solve a political problem
that has vexed the budget negotiators since they began work
in May: If capital-gains tax rates are cut -- a move that
would largely benefit the wealthy who have assets to sell --
then what taxes on upper-income Americans could be raised?
Republicans, still singing from the hymn book of Reagan-era
supply-siders, insist they won't raise marginal income tax
rates, now at 28% for the highest-income Americans. "I am not
going to vote to raise marginal tax rates because {that
would} stifle incentives," says Republican negotiator Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas.</p>
<p>Democrats, meanwhile, have rediscovered the soak-the-rich
ballads of their past, and insist that any tax package must
hit the rich harder than the working class. House Democratic
Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri sounded the war cry last
week. "We must ask wealthy Americans to pay their fair
share," he said.</p>
<p>For Democrats, the debate has marked a return to an old
struggle to use the tax code to redistribute income. During
the Reagan years, many Democrats largely abandoned that
campaign. But now they seem to be embracing it anew. In part,
this reflects the ascendency of the son of a janitor, George
Mitchell, to the post of majority leader of the Senate and
the son of a milkman, Richard Gephardt, to the same post in
the House. It also reflects a growing sense among many
Democrats that the glorification of wealth that marked the
1980s has given way in the 1990s to public anger about greed
and inequality.</p>
<p>Still, Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said earlier this summer that "the odds are
against" a broad cut in deductions. Lobbyists for real-estate
agents, home builders, charities and state and local
governments have already mobilized, and hurriedly called a
joint meeting yesterday to devise a strategy to fight efforts
to limit deductions.</p>
<p>They worry about how a curb on deductions would affect
people like Travers Nelson. Mr. Nelson, director of design
and development for PersonaCare Inc., a developer of nursing
homes in Baltimore, says if he and his wife can't deduct
mortgage payments on their new townhouse, they may have to
take a second look at their charitable contributions. "We
won't be able to give as much," he says.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time tax deductions have been under
siege. In the 1970s, President Jimmy Carter campaigned
against the "three-martini lunch" -- the deduction for
business meals and entertainment -- but to no avail. The 1986
Tax Reform Act was more successful in eliminating some
smaller deductions -- such as the write-off for consumer
interest payments and for state sales taxes -- and limiting
others, including the three-martini lunch.</p>
<p>Other attacks on deductions were repelled during debate
over the 1986 bill. A Reagan administration proposal to
eliminate the mortgage-interest deduction for second homes
failed when lobbyists convinced lawmakers that second homes
weren't just for rich folks but were also used by the "middle
class" -- to say nothing of members of Congress, many of whom
own homes in their districts and in the Washington area.</p>
<p>Throughout the various battles, the biggest deductions
have remained intact. The deduction for interest payments on
home mortgages tops the list. Its estimated cost to the
Treasury is $47 billion a year. Congress did prove in 1987
that it could at least nick that sacred cow: It passed a law
that prevents any couple from deducting interest payments on
mortgages that exceed $1 million.</p>
<p>A group called the Alliance for America's Homeowners,
formed to protect the mortgage-interest deduction in the
mid-1980s, is already stirring from hibernation and preparing
to fight again. One new argument: With the housing industry
already in a deepening slump, this is the wrong time to cut
back housing write-offs.</p>
<p>The deduction for state and local income taxes is the
runner-up in size, draining about $22 billion a year from
federal coffers. That's one the White House specifically
proposed cutting back on.</p>
<p>But any narrowing in the deduction for state and local
taxes would affect individual states very differently, since
the higher a state's tax rate, the more a resident in that
state stands to lose. Moreover, in seven states there isn't
any state income tax at all. A new report by the
Congressional Research Service says that an earlier
administration proposal to cap the deduction for state and
local taxes at $10,000 would have had the following,
divergent effect: In Illinois and New Jersey, you wouldn't
hit the $10,000 cap until you reached $333,400 and $302,900
in income respectively. But in North Dakota and Hawaii, where
state income tax rates are higher, you reach the cap at
$84,300 and $88,625.</p>
<p>Deductions for charitable contributions are next in line.
They cost the Treasury $17 billion a year and they, too, are
backed by a vigorous lobby. "The adrenaline is flowing," says
Robert Smucker, a vice president of Independent Sector, an
umbrella organization for 700 charities.</p>
<p>More deductions may be on the chopping block as well.
Homeowners could get a double whack if the deduction for
property tax payments is also narrowed. That costs the
Treasury $12 billion a year. And then there is the deduction
for medical expenses. That one is already limited to
taxpayers whose medical bills exceed 7.5% of their income, a
hurdle met by relatively few taxpayers. It benefits
middle-income taxpayers more than those in the highest
brackets and costs the Treasury $3 billion a year.</p>
<p>Singling out any one of these big deductions is
politically risky; indeed, members of Congress are loath to
appear anti-housing or anti-charity. Hence plans, like the
new Republican proposal and one previously crafted by
Democratic Rep. Don Pease of Ohio, to trim deductions
across-the-board for upper-income taxpayers.</p>
<p>An alternative scheme, which has been considered in the
past, is to turn all deductions into tax credits. That would
have the effect of ensuring that $1 worth of deductions is
worth no more to a taxpayer in the 28% tax bracket than it is
to a lower-income taxpayer in the 15% bracket.</p>
<p>Currently, for instance, $10,000 in mortgage interest
deductions saves $1,500 in taxes for someone in the 15%
bracket, but $2,800 for someone in the 28% bracket and $3,300
for someone in the 33% bracket. If all tax deductions were
converted into a 15% tax credit, the $10,000 in interest
expenses would reduce a taxpayer's bill by $1,500 no matter
which bracket he is in. Applied just to mortgage interest,
that change would raise more than $50 billion over five
years, the Congressional Budget Office says.</p>
<p>All of the proposals are still far from law, of course.
But lobbyists opposed to paring deductions already are
predicting the most dire consequences. A letter several wrote
to negotiators yesterday chillingly predicted that limiting
deductions today ultimately could doom them altogether.</p>
<p>"Restricting itemized deductions in this manner sets a
precedent," the letter said, making "all of these deductions
prime targets for future revenue needs."</p>

<p>THE NORTH DAKOTA tax commissioner says that a resident of
that state would have to earn $241,650 before owing $10,000
in state income taxes. The threshold was given incorrectly in
