	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Cineplex Odeon Corp. said the $31.8 million
sale of 38 of its U.S. movie theaters to Plitt Amusement Co.
of Los Angeles won't go ahead as planned.
   Cineplex disclosed last month that the transaction might
not be completed. Sources close to the proposed sale said it
foundered over the reluctance of banks to finance an
acquisition valued at more than six times cash flow. Analysts
said the Plitt sale had an indicated value of eight times
cash flow.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The transaction, announced in June, had been scheduled to
close July 31.</p>
<p>Cineplex and Plitt said that "the matter was settled on
amicable terms," and that the two companies "have released
each other from any related obligations."</p>
<p>The Plitt sale was one of several announced by Cineplex as
part of the movie theater chain's commitments to its bankers
to raise $200 million through asset sales. Those proceeds are
to be used to cut its long-term debt load, which stood at
$479.4 million at June 30, 1990.</p>
<p>Allen Karp, president and chief executive officer of
Cineplex, said previously that the company doesn't propose to
dispose of assets at "fire-sale prices" to meet that target.</p>
<p>"We've got the confidence of our bankers and our major
shareholders to the extent that we don't need to give things
away," said a spokeswoman for Cineplex.</p>
<p>If Cineplex doesn't meet that target, its two major
shareholders, MCA Inc. and interests affiliated with Montreal
financier Charles Bronfman, have agreed to invest an
additional $100 million in Cineplex in the form of
subordinated financing.</p>
<p>To date, Cineplex has raised about $142 million in gross
proceeds from asset sales.</p>
<p>The company spokeswoman said the theaters, which are not
in areas that Cineplex has identified as core markets, will
remain on the company's list of assets to be sold.</p>
