	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Radical plans to establish a market economy in
the Soviet Union starting Oct. 1 have run into potentially
serious political obstacles only days after they were
publicly endorsed by President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The trouble stems from concern about the public's support
for a wrenching economic overhaul, and from continued
disagreements among Soviet economists and politicians over
the best approach to reform.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But leaders of the Russian republic, who are leading the
charge to a market system, say they will press ahead despite
the new central government obstacles, raising the prospect of
a political showdown between the biggest Soviet republic and
the central government.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev last week clearly sided with proposals
drafted by economist Stanislav Shatalin for a swift
decentralization and deregulation of the economy over a
period of 500 days, thus rejecting a more cautious reform
package worked out by Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov. But in
an apparent sop to conservative critics, Mr. Gorbachev
backpedaled yesterday and called for a national referendum on
private ownership of land -- something that could take months
to organize.</p>
<p>"This problem is too important to be decided in offices or
forums, even such a high one as this," he told the national
parliament. Seemingly on the defensive, he also insisted that
the Shatalin proposals won't "lead to capitalism." Instead,
"socialism will be brought in line with the private interests
of people," he said.</p>
<p>Less than an hour later, the Soviet government signaled
its intention to hinder the introduction of the Shatalin
proposals, which it believes will lead to the collapse of
Soviet central government and a drastic fall in living
standards.</p>
<p>Deputy Premier Leonid Abalkin, an economist who drafted
Mr. Ryzhkov's government program, told parliament that an
emergency session of the Congress of People's Deputies may
have to be convened to approve the Shatalin plans. Such a
session of the highest legislative body in the Soviet Union
could take two weeks or more to convene, casting doubt over
the Oct. 1 deadline.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Abalkin said the government within the next
10 days will present parliament with a state economic plan
and budget for 1991 that corresponds to the Ryzhkov reform
proposals, rather than the ones by Mr. Shatalin.</p>
<p>One key difference between the two sets of proposals is
that Mr. Abalkin and the government want to double and even
triple the government-set prices of most goods from Jan. 1,
1991, something Mr. Shatalin rejects. He instead seeks to
allow most prices to be set by supply and demand after an
initial period of stabilizing the economy through tight
fiscal and monetary measures.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev's call for a referendum on land ownership
and the government's hardball tactics both could delay the
implementation of the Shatalin program, even though they seem
unlikely to block it entirely. Nikolai Petrakov, the Soviet
leader's personal economic adviser, emphasized at a meeting
with American newspaper executives yesterday that Mr.
Gorbachev "is really one of the authors" of the Shatalin
500-day program and fully supports it.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, sales of land and housing are an important
part of Mr. Shatalin's strategy, particularly in the early
stages, because they are supposed to mop up some of the
billions of rubles currently in circulation. Mr. Shatalin
says that retail prices can only be allowed to float once
this money is tied down, thereby minimizing the danger of
surging inflation.</p>
<p>Private ownership of land remains a touchy ideological
subject here, which may explain Mr. Gorbachev's desire to
seek public backing for such a move. But organizing a
referendum could take months. For one thing, the national
parliament has yet to pass a law allowing referendums to be
held.</p>
<p>Neither the referendum nor the government's objections
"are desirable for the program," complained Ivan Silayev,
prime minister of the Russian republic, which has approved
the Shatalin plan and says it will start implementing it Oct.
1.</p>
<p>For the proposals to work most effectively, reformers want
all 15 Soviet republics and the national parliament to agree
on the same strategy in the next few days. But Mr. Silayev
hinted that the Russian republic would not shy away from
confrontation over the issue of timing.</p>
<p>Mr. Petrakov, who helped devise the Shatalin proposals,
said the absence of private ownership of land wouldn't
entirely scuttle the strategy but might weaken its
effectiveness. He said in an interview that people would
still be able to lease land with the right to pass it on to
their children, pending the outcome of any possible
referendum.</p>
<p>He was more upset about the Soviet government's attempts
to throw up fresh obstacles to the Shatalin plan. "I have to
say they are trying to put a burden on it," he complained.
Some analysts said the stalling tactics may be a last-ditch
attempt by the government to save itself. Several leading
politicians, including Russian President Boris Yeltsin, have
called for Mr. Ryzhkov's resignation -- a call echoed by
thousands of Muscovites at a protest rally Sunday.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev is reluctant to let Mr. Ryzhkov and his team
go, however, for fear of creating even more upheaval. Mr.
Gorbachev criticized the public calls for the government to
resign as "absolutely unacceptable." And he warned parliament
that such a move "would draw us into grim political battles
and enhance confrontation in society at a time when we most
badly need consolidation to carry out the market economy
program and draft a new federal treaty."</p>
