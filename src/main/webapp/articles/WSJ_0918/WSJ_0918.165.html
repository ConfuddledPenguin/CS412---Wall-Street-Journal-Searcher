	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Federal prosecutors said they won't retry
Mayor Marion Barry on 12 counts of cocaine possession and
perjury on which a jury failed to reach a verdict last month.
   Mr. Barry was convicted Aug. 10 in federal court here on
one count of possessing cocaine. He was acquitted on another
possession count. His sentencing is set for Oct. 26. The
mayor faces a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a
$100,000 fine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Jay Stephens, the U.S. attorney here, said in a statement,
"While the defendant mistakenly has flaunted the jury's
failure to reach a unanimous decision as to his guilt on all
counts, when all the dust has settled, the essential truth
will remain that the chief executive of this city, charged
with the responsibility of leading the fight against illegal
drugs and violence, has himself been convicted of
contributing to the human devastation."</p>
<p>Mr. Barry, whose lawyer conceded to the jury that the
mayor had occasionally used drugs, said he was relieved but
declined to elaborate. As a result of his being prosecuted,
Mr. Barry had announced that he wouldn't run for a fourth
term as mayor. But he remains an independent candidate for an
at-large seat on Washington's City Council.</p>
