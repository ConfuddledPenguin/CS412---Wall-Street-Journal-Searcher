	<p class="article-leader">SMITHFIELD, N.C. -- Harvey Gantt keeps on "keepin' on."
   Cast as the underdog against Republican Sen. Jesse Helms,
the black former mayor of Charlotte is waging a serendipity
campaign that may yet confound his powerful conservative,
white rival. Better financed and more experienced men have
failed before him, but there is an infectious appeal to the
new challenger that strikes a chord among Democrats looking
for leadership after years out of power.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At a rail depot in urban Greensboro, hundreds of younger
voters, many of whom have never before participated in
politics, turn out to contribute money and cheer Mr. Gantt.
Here in rural Johnston County, where a Ku Klux Klan billboard
welcomed visitors until the late 1970s, pillars of the white
establishment stammer and hesitate -- but don't outright
reject the historic candidacy before them.</p>
<p>The Mideast crisis could prove a fatal distraction, but
Mr. Gantt's newfound celebrity brings out the curious -- and
he hopes, the convertible. His gray-flecked hair and Baptist
roots comfort more conservative whites, and taking a page
from Mr. Helms's book, he makes a virtue of standing up to
his rival in the Senate race. "We won't take any stuff," the
47-year-old Mr. Gantt says. "This year we want you to know
what he stands up for."</p>
<p>Although savvy, unrelenting and confident, Sen. Helms at
68 is facing a changing world. As Ronald Reagan's tough
ideological ally, he last won in 1984 by painting then-Gov.
James Hunt as a whimpering pol. Today, with George Bush
talking taxes with Congress and peace with the Soviets, the
senator is reduced to toting around "homoerotic" photos for
shock value in his war against the National Endowment for the
Arts. "Men only," he says, like a chivalrous guardian
protecting women from seeing the pictures.</p>
<p>"I'd find something better to spend my time on," says
Barrett McLendon, a 28-year-old foundry worker whose own
concern is a toxic-waste dump in his rural county in the
Piedmont foothills. A self-described conservative, Mr.
McLendon is one of many young voters who backed Mr. Bush and
Mr. Reagan in the past but who now find themselves rethinking
Mr. Helms on environmental and social issues.</p>
<p>Race remains a factor, but the election also dramatizes
the class and education divisions in the newly urbanized
South. In a posh Greensboro neighborhood, college-educated
Republican women toast Mr. Gantt for his stand for abortion
rights while a black band plays on the veranda. Chilled white
wine is served at Mr. Helms's first stop in Smithfield, at
the handsome home of a state senator. Iced tea is served at a
second stop, where a more working-class crowd fans itself in
the heat as a young girl and a puppet sing, "We're in this
Thing Together, Jesus and Me."</p>
<p>A master parliamentarian in Washington, Sen. Helms refuses
to debate Mr. Gantt at home. He is so bent on avoiding
reporters that the state Associated Press sent out a message
recently asking its members to help track the senator's rare
public campaign stops. The Mideast crisis yields a political
windfall by accenting his standing on the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, though he overreaches, skipping over his
record as an early critic of the Iraqi regime to emphasize
the dubious heroics of a brief trip to the Middle East.</p>
<p>"There were many times I didn't think I was coming back,"
Mr. Helms tells supporters in Charlotte. At a ceremony in
Raleigh, he strains to make reference to the heat -- "It's
cool compared with where I came from" -- and to his
familiarity with heads of state. "I have met with a lot of
presidents these days," he says.</p>
<p>With a showman's flair, Mr. Helms remains unsparing in his
anti-federalism and strikes a pose separate from Washington
and such problems as the savings-and-loan debacle blamed on
the Capitol. (In fact, he was present, and voted for,
legislation to deregulate savings and loans more than a
decade ago.) He likens the Senate to turkeys on the way to
market, and announces to applause that "it was only when the
federal government took over control of the schools of
America that the quality of education began to plummet."
While chastising Mr. Gantt for supporting cuts in defense,
the senator urges Mr. Bush to stand aside and let "the chips
fall where they may" with automatic deficit-reduction
spending cuts of more than $85 billion -- half from the
Pentagon -- next month.</p>
<p>This outward austerity contrasts with an internal campaign
memo listing two dozen cases -- suitable for local ads --
where Mr. Helms tapped federal resources for home-state
interests. Included is a $905,000 grant in 1988 to assist in
the below-market financing for a privately owned
turkey-processing plant in southeastern North Carolina. Mr.
Helms personally intervened with then-Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development Samuel Pierce on behalf of the project,
according to the memo; and federal records separately show
the senator received a $2,000 contribution this summer from
the president of the plant's parent corporation.</p>
<p>Mr. Gantt, though beginning with strong black support,
must still win nearly 40% of the white vote to prevail in
November, and his emphasis on education and abortion rights
takes aim at the very suburban voters who have been crucial
to Republican success in the South. Six years ago, Mr. Helms'
winning margin -- about 86,000 votes -- was built on a strong
showing through the state's Piedmont corridor, and the
challenger must make inroads here while matching the showing
of Mr. Hunt, the 1984 challenger, in rural counties on the
plain east of Raleigh.</p>
<p>While the senator's negative ratings have increased only
marginally since 1984, Mr. Gantt has so far preserved a
more-favorable image than Mr. Hunt enjoyed at this point six
years ago. Pounded by negative ads, the governor fell into
the trap of endlessly explaining why he wasn't a liberal. Mr.
Gantt talks more about why he is a Democrat.</p>
<p>The Mideast crisis caught him flatfooted on
national-security questions; but on domestic issues, his
message of unrepentant Democratic pride is a rallying cry for
those party regulars longing to win back the governorship in
1992. "I feel like the Maytag man," says Rufus Edmisten of
his lonely vigil as the Democratic secretary of state.</p>
<p>Sen. Helms's backers argue that the press -- not the
senator -- inserts race into the contest. Still, racial
allusions make their way into his campaign. Mailings have
included a picture of Ron Brown, the black national
Democratic Party chairman, as well as a prominent reference
to a black lesbian activist. Mr. Gantt is labeled in one
television ad as not only "extremely liberal" but also
"extremely different."</p>
<p>Most sensitive perhaps is the Democrat's past investment
in a minority media firm in Charlotte that won a television
license in 1985 and shortly after sold it for $3 million. Mr.
Gantt denies any favoritism because no other final applicant
was before the Federal Communications Commission, but in a
prior campaign the issue was used to suggest he profited from
his race and minority preferences.</p>
<p>As Mr. Helms's ads begin to take effect, the coming weeks
will be a crucial test of Mr. Gantt's staying power. In a
battle of margins, he must at least contain Sen. Helms in
counties like Johnston. The conflicting pressures are seen in
the face of Frank Holding, a county commissioner and banker
whose brother is a major Helms backer. "The Democratic Party
has been very good to me," says Mr. Holding. "I expect to
support the Democratic ticket."</p>
