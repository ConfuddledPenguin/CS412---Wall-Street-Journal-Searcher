	<p class="article-leader">Silicon Valley Group Inc., citing adverse market
conditions, said it scrapped a proposed public offering of
its stock, and reached a new four-year, $50 million secured
credit facility with a group of banks.
   The semiconductor processing equipment maker had planned
on using part of the proceeds of the three million common
share offering, registered last month with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, to retire debt from a May 1990 agreement
to acquire control of the Optical Lithography operations of
Perkin-Elmer Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Silicon
Valley Group stock closed at $6.375, about 39% less than its
August peak of $10.375.</p>
<p>The San Jose, Calif., company added that it had already
borrowed $20 million under the new credit agreement, arranged
with a group led by San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp.'s
main banking unit, to help pay off an interim loan from the
Perkin-Elmer acquisition.</p>
