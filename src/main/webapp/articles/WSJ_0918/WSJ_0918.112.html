	<p class="article-leader">Xicor Inc. said it is temporarily reducing work hours for
most employees by 10% to 25% until continuing sluggish orders
pick up.
   The Milpitas, Calif., semiconductor manufacturer, which
employs roughly 1,250 people, said the scaled-back hours
would continue until bookings improve "significantly." It
added that it eliminated 36 jobs as the result of
reorganizing certain operations and trimming nonessential
staff.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Xicor also said that "unless bookings for quick turn
deliveries increase significantly in the near future, we will
not be able to attain profitability in 1990."</p>
<p>The company had a net loss of $4.8 million, or 26 cents a
share, on revenue of $20.4 million, for the second quarter
ended June 17. It said it expects to report increased revenue
and a narrowing of losses for the third quarter ended Sept.
9.</p>
