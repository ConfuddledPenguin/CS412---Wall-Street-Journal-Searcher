	<p class="article-leader">CAIRO, Egypt -- Recent U.S. talk of stationing troops
permanently in the Persian Gulf is backfiring in the Arab
world.
   Even in a country as supportive of the U.S. role as Egypt,
the suggestion of long-term foreign military involvement in
the Gulf is viewed as ominous and plays into the hands of
political forces already suspicious that the U.S. is only
after oil or control of the strategic region.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It wasn't a bright idea on the part of the Americans to
raise it at this time," says Akmed Kamal Abul-Magd, an
Egyptian lawyer and academic. "It's very alarming. It's most
destructive and most divisive."</p>
<p>Secretary of State James Baker broached the concept of a
long-term U.S. presence as an element of a regional security
structure, partly to pacify critics at home who were pressing
officials to come up with long-range plans after the hasty
buildup of a U.S.-led Western and Arab military force in
Saudi Arabia. But instead of reassuring Arabs, it sounded
alarm bells in certain quarters in countries near the
conflict. Now, to recover from its tactical blunder, U.S.
officials are promising to remove the troops as soon as they
aren't needed any longer.</p>
<p>But the mixed signals have stirred sentiments in Arab
society that Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is trying to
subdue. To forge an Arab military coalition to confront Iraq
after its Aug. 2 invasion and occupation of Kuwait, Mr.
Mubarak had to maneuver around a split among Arab nations
over the use of foreign troops to defend Saudi Arabia. Inside
Egypt, while there is near-unanimous condemnation of the
invasion of Kuwait, the public is divided over the deployment
of foreign troops on Saudi soil. Even the Islamic movement is
split over the presence of Western "infidels" in the land of
Moslem's holiest shrines.</p>
<p>The balance of support still tips strongly in favor of Mr.
Mubarak's pivotal decision to deploy Egyptian soldiers as
part of an Arab force to defend Saudi Arabia against possible
Iraqi attack. But Mideast experts say a permanent security
force raises more troubling issues.</p>
<p>"Arabs wouldn't welcome a long-term presence," said an
Egyptian official privy to foreign-policy decision-making,
"because the Arab mind turns in a conspiratorial way."
Unlikely as it may seem to Americans, many Arabs would tend
to think the U.S. somehow contrived to create the Kuwaiti
controversy to win a toehold in the oil-rich region, he said.</p>
<p>Any security arrangement, the official said, "has to
emanate from the important powers in the region," namely
Egypt and Saudi Arabia, even if it ultimately relies on
international military help. The sentiment suggests that U.S.
officials will have to play down talk of security
arrangements for the Gulf at least until the immediate crisis
-- the occupation of Kuwait -- is over.</p>
<p>Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, publicly blasting Mr.
Baker's plan, last week called for a "holy war" against the
U.S. presence in the region. Mr. Mubarak hasn't made an issue
of long-term security arrangements, but his government is
subtly trying to calm resentment stirred by the presence of
foreign forces.</p>
<p>For example, government-controlled Egyptian television
reran a show in which a popular TV-personality cleric, Sheik
Mohammed Metwalli Sharawi, talked about how even the prophet
Mohammed, father of the Moslem faith, relied on non-believers
for arms and for guidance through the desert. And when
Western news reports recently seemed fixated on the
U.S.-Soviet summit in Helsinki, Finland, Cairo radio led its
newscasts with a statement by President Bush calling the
deployment of U.S. troops in the Gulf "temporary."</p>
<p>President Bush himself appeared to go out of his way
yesterday to defuse Arab concern about the U.S.'s long-term
intentions. In speaking to reporters about U.S. forces in
Saudi Arabia, Mr. Bush said: "I want those soldiers out as
soon as possible. I want them all out -- all out, period."
But the president then added: "And yet, I can't say when that
will be."</p>
<p>In a further sign of its struggle to present a united
front, the Egyptian government last week barred several
journalists and opposition party members who object to the
presence of foreign troops in Saudi Arabia from traveling to
Jordan for a conference with Arabs sympathetic to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>Arabs' deep-seated disdain for foreign military
involvement in the region is rooted in sour memories of
foreign domination by the Turks, French and British and fears
that foreign occupiers will pursue their own special
interests, such as ensuring the flow of Middle Eastern oil to
the outside world.</p>
<p>"It also touches on something very deep in the heart of
Moslems," says Ibrahim Shoukry, an opposition leader whose
party is allied with the religious Moslem Brotherhood
movement and who was one of those barred from going to
Jordan. "Jews {in the U.S. armed forces} will be defending
the Islamic holy land."</p>
<p>At least among moderate Arab intellectuals, discussions
are beginning not just on the need for regional security
arrangements but also on new long-term economic, political
and social arrangements. "If the Arabs don't come up with
some solutions, others will come up with something for them,"
warns a leading political analyst, Ali Dessouki of Cairo
University. "Arabs have to get their acts together."</p>
