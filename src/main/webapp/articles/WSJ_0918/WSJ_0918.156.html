	<p class="article-leader">Standard Register Co., hurting from a weak general
economy, higher paper costs and tough competition in the
business-forms industry, said it expects lower third-quarter
and full-year earnings.
   The Dayton, Ohio, company also said it will begin a major
cost reduction program over the next six months, slashing
employment and closing several production facilities. The
company didn't elaborate. However, it said the program will
result in a one-time fourth-quarter charge. It didn't
disclose the amount.</p>
