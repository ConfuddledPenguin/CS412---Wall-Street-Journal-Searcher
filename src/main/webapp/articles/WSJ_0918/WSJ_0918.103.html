	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Supreme Court nominee David Souter,
concluding his testimony before the Senate Judiciary
Committee, parried continued efforts by senators to pin down
his views on the right to abortion and other issues.
   After 18 hours of testimony, it appeared that Judge Souter
is practically certain to be confirmed. The hearings are
scheduled to continue today, with witnesses testifying for
and against Judge Souter, who celebrated his 51st birthday
yesterday. But even as Senate aides were distributing lists
of scheduled witnesses yesterday afternoon, some liberal
groups, such as People for the American Way, were deciding
they wouldn't oppose the nomination.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some of the toughest questioning yesterday came from
conservative Republicans who seemed concerned that some of
Judge Souter's statements last week invited too broad a role
for the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) said he was "a little
troubled" by Judge Souter's suggestion that the courts must
sometimes fill the "vacuum" created by the failure of
Congress or the president to take action.</p>
<p>But Judge Souter said he was referring to courts
exercising their existing authority, not expanding their
jurisdiction to fill vacuums. He said that in 1954, the
Supreme Court ordered school desegregation after Congress and
the states declined to do it. But he said the court acted
under its authority to implement the 14th Amendment guarantee
of "equal protection of the laws," not under some usurped
power.</p>
<p>He repeatedly declined senators' invitations to criticize
a Supreme Court ruling last spring upholding the authority of
federal judges to order local officials to raise taxes to
fund school desegregation plans. He suggested that perhaps
the Supreme Court shouldn't have heard the case, which
involved school desegregation in Kansas City, Mo., but he
wouldn't find fault with the 5-4 ruling.</p>
<p>Judge Souter said he doesn't agree with the view of
retired Justice William Brennan, whom he was nominated to
succeed, that the death penalty in all circumstances is
unconstitutional. He said the authors of the Bill of Rights
envisioned the existence of capital punishment.</p>
<p>Reiterating his pledge to approach the right to abortion
with an open mind, he generally refused to discuss the 1973
Roe vs. Wade decision that recognized the right to abortion,
as well as varied questions about how to define legally when
human life begins. In the only specific response he gave on
the abortion issue, he said that if the 1973 decision were
overruled by the Supreme Court, state legislatures would pass
a variety of different abortion laws.</p>
<p>In other aspects of his testimony, the former New
Hampshire Supreme Court justice, who is currently a federal
appeals court judge, said that based on his five years as a
state trial judge, he has "enormous respect" for the jury
system in criminal cases and civil damages cases.</p>
<p>Although he didn't elaborate, his answer might mean that
he is skeptical of arguments that juries are approving
excessively large punitive-damage awards. The
constitutionality of punitive-damage awards is an issue to be
decided by the Supreme Court in its term that begins Oct. 1.
It is unclear, however, whether Judge Souter will be
confirmed by the Senate in time to vote in the case, which
will be argued Oct. 3.</p>
<p>Judge Souter said he doesn't "set myself up as an expert
in antitrust matters." But he said he doesn't believe
antitrust enforcement should be eliminated for vertical
price-fixing cases in which manufacturers dictate retail
prices.</p>
