	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The bond market limped along in another torpid
trading day, with prices of long-term bonds falling in
response to higher oil prices, and short-term securities
holding steady on hopes the Federal Reserve will eventually
ease interest rates.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended more than 3/8
point lower yesterday, a decline of $3.75 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount. The issue's yield, which moves in the
opposite direction of its price, rose to 9.06%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>James Capra, a senior vice president at Lehman Government
Securities Inc., said trading activity has come to a virtual
standstill, because investors are "too afraid to do
anything." He said the fear stems from uncertainties about
how economic and political issues will be resolved.</p>
<p>"I think the market is torn between the concern about a
Middle East war, a weaker dollar, and oil prices that keep
trading higher every day," vs. the potentially positive
aspects of a budget-reduction compromise and the possibility
that the Federal Reserve might reduce short-term interest
rates.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, World Savings & Loan Association, a subsidiary
of Golden West Financial Corp., sold $100 million of
seven-year subordinated notes yesterday at a price to yield
10.25%.</p>
<p>The World Savings note sale was considered important,
because it showed that investors aren't avoiding the
securities of all financial institutions, but instead are
dividing the industry into two groups, composed of those
institutions perceived to be in good shape and those
considered to be headed for trouble.</p>
<p>Last week, some market participants were surprised when
Chase Manhattan Corp. was forced to offer yields in excess of
13% to reset the rate on $200 million of two-year
auction-rate subordinated notes. The yield was 4.92
percentage points above the yield on two-year Treasury notes,
which was considered a high spread. The spread on the World
Savings notes was 1.5 percentage points above the yield on
the Treasury's seven-year notes.</p>
<p>James Quigley, debt syndicate director at Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets, said the narrower yield spread for World
Savings is an indication that investors perceive the Oakland,
Calif.-based savings and loan to be a relatively good credit
risk.</p>
<p>"It's false to say that all financial institution spreads
have widened out in the past few months," Mr. Quigley said.
"Investors do differentiate between the money-center banks
and credits like World S&L," which has assets consisting
primarily of single-family home mortgages and government
securities. In contrast, the big New York money-center banks
and many large regional banks have been plagued by troubled
commercial real estate loans and loans to lesser-developed
countries.</p>
<p>Ann Robinson, a banking analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &
Jenrette Securities Corp., said debt offerings made on the
bank or thrift level, like the World S&L issue, are more
appealing than those made by holding companies such as Chase
Manhattan.</p>
<p>Investors fear that if a bank or thrift becomes insolvent
and must be taken over by the government, the regulators will
"seize banks and save the bank but not the banking holding
company," Ms. Robinson said.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury prices ended mixed yesterday. The Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond was quoted at a price of 96 23/32 to
yield 9.06%, compared with 97 4/32 to yield 9.02% on Friday.</p>
<p>Prices of two-year notes were unchanged. The two-year
notes were quoted at a price of 100 5/32 to yield 8.02%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rates on three-month and six-month Treasury
bills were lower yesterday at the Treasury's weekly bill
auction, compared with last week's auction.</p>
<p>The average discount rate set on new three-month bills at
yesterday's auction was 7.39%, and the average discount rate
on new six-month bills was 7.3%. The rates were down from
last week's auction, when they were 7.41% and 7.34%,
respectively.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>

<p>

<p>Both issues are dated Sept. 20. The 13-week bills mature
Dec. 20, and the 26-week bills mature March 21, 1991.</p>
<p>Corporate and Junk Bonds</p>
<p>Junk bonds ended weaker again, the result of a lackluster
stock market and declines in the government bond market.</p>
<p>Many junk bonds declined about 1/2 point, underperforming
investment-grade corporate bonds, which fell between 1/4 and
3/8 point.</p>
<p>Among high-yield bonds that bucked the market trend and
advanced were pay-in-kind bonds of RJR Nabisco Inc. RJR's
17.375% convertible pay-in-kind debentures rose 7/8 point to
finish at 112 on the New York Stock Exchange. The other
widely held RJR issue, the 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind
debentures maturing in 2007, ended 1/2 point higher at 87
3/4.</p>
<p>Some market participants said investors bid up the bonds
on the expectation that the company's exchange offer for the
convertible debentures will be declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission soon.</p>
<p>Other dealers said the bonds were buoyed by Friday's news
that RJR, a food and tobacco giant, will export cigarettes to
the U.S.S.R. to help alleviate that country's cigarette
shortage.</p>
<p>In addition to the World S&L issue, Champion International
Corp. offered $150 million of five-year notes Monday that
were priced to yield 9.65%.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Feeling the effects of rising oil prices, municipal bonds
were 1/4 to 3/8 lower, with some bonds posting declines of as
much as 1/2 point.</p>
<p>"There's not really enough trading to get a feel for it,"
a municipal trader said of the market. Participants
anticipate that secondary activity will be slow as investors
focus on new deals this week.</p>
<p>In limited new-issue dealings, a Goldman, Sachs & Co.
group preliminarily priced an issue of $228 million of New
York State Urban Development Corp. correctional capital
facilities revenue bonds to yield from 6.50% in 1992 to 8% in
2016. Ratings of single-A/triple-B-plus are expected.</p>
<p>A Goldman Sachs group also repriced $126 million of Rhode
Island Housing and Mortgage Finance Corp. home ownership
opportunity bonds to lower yields by five to 10 basis points.
A basis point is equal to 1/100th of one percentage point.
The bonds are priced to yield from 6.4% in 1992 to 8.05% in
2022. Interest on part of the issue is subject to the federal
alternative minimum tax. Ratings of single-A-1/double-A-plus
are expected.</p>
<p>Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.2% issue, due 2018, was 3/8 point lower, at 97
1/4 to 97 3/4, to yield 7.39.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage securities prices, taking their cue from the U.S.
Treasury market, eroded.</p>
<p>Helping weigh on the mortgage securities market was
selling of securities outstanding by the Resolution Trust
Corp. But losses were capped by the continued collateral
collection by underwriters putting real estate mortgage
investment conduit, or remic, deals together. A remic is a
type of security authorized by the 1986 tax law. Underwritten
by Wall Street firms, remics provide a method of dividing up
the income flows from many mortgages into new securities with
various interest rates and maturities to attract banks,
insurers and other big investors to the home-mortgage market.</p>
<p>The RTC unloaded "$180 million Ginnie {Mae} 8 1/2s and
$100 million {Freddie Mac} PC 9s," a trader said,
characterizing the volume of sales as "a small amount" of the
Government National Mortgage Association and Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp. issues. PCs are participation
certificates. He said the securities "traded right on the
market and were well bid for. They're deal-related
securities."</p>
<p>The RTC selling is expected to continue in the next
session, with roughly $100 million more of seasoned Ginnie
Maes and as much as $200 million of various Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac coupons, according to another participant. Fannie
Mae is the Federal National Mortgage Association.</p>
<p>Most market players consider the supply manageable.</p>
<p>Aside from the RTC activity, secondary dealings were
subdued.</p>
<p>Ginnie Mae 9 1/2% issues for October delivery were down
1/4 at 99 10/32, Freddie Mac 9 1/2% Gold PCs were off 5/32 at
98 27/ 32, and Fannie Mae 9 1/2% issues were off 5/32 at 98
21/32.</p>
<p>Conventional mortgage securities have been outperforming
Ginnie Maes, because underwriters have been seeking the
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securities for remics.</p>
<p>Pricings of two new remic offerings, one from Freddie Mac
and one from Fannie Mae, totaling $600 million were announced
yesterday. A $300 million Freddie Mac remic is being offered
in 10 classes by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in Freddie Mac
Gold 1007. The securities are collateralized with Freddie Mac
10 1/2% Gold PCs. A $300.2 million issue of Fannie Mae remics
is being offered in 11 classes by Bear, Stearns & Co. The
issue, Series 1990-127, is backed by Fannie Mae 10%
securities.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Speculation that financial firms may be forced to mark
more securities to market value caused Japanese government
bonds to end weaker.</p>
<p>The yield on the benchmark No. 119 10-year government bond
rose as high as 8.58%, the highest yield for a benchmark in
about a decade. When the market closed, the yield was quoted
at 8.57%. The price of the benchmark bond fell 0.63 point, to
81.17. (When calculated using the semiannual compound method,
the yield on the No. 119 ended at 7.75%, according to Salomon
Brothers Inc.)</p>
<p>The mark-to-market talk began late Friday on reports that
the Finance Ministry was considering making accounting rules
stricter. The move might force firms to realize losses on
bonds and make holding such securities less attractive, a
dealer said.</p>
