	<p class="article-leader">General Signal Corp., Stamford, Conn., said that an
agreement to sell its Ultratech Stepper unit to an employee
group has been canceled by mutual agreement of the parties.
   Instead, General Signal said that Arthur W. Zafiropoulo
has been named president of Ultratech. Mr. Zafiropoulo most
recently headed General Signal's international semiconductor
operations and was president of the company's Kayex unit.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>General Signal, a maker of process controls, electrical
equipment and semiconductors, had reached a agreement in July
to sell 300-employee Ultratech to New Enterprise Associates,
a San Francisco-based venture capital firm. A General Signal
spokesman said the agreement collapsed due to inability to
agree on the amount of financing from General Signal.</p>
<p>Ultratech Stepper, which makes photolithography equipment
for semiconductors, accounted for about $40 million of
General Signal's sales of $1.92 billion in 1989.</p>
