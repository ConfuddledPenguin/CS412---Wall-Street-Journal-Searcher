	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Savings Bank said it recovered $15.6
million of a $25 million nonperforming construction loan on a
building in New York.
   The recovery settlement resulted from the recent sale of
the 46-story commercial and residential building under a
bankruptcy court auction. The bank was a major partner in a
$65 million construction loan with a consortium of banks that
was made in 1984. The loan became nonperforming in 1987.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>American Savings said the recovery amount was after
expenses related to liens, attorneys' fees, taxes and other
bankruptcy court fees. As a result, it will take an
additional loss of approximately $1.8 million on the loan,
which will be included in the third quarter.</p>
