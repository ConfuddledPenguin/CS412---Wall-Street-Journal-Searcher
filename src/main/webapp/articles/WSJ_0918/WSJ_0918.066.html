	<p class="article-leader">Nintendo Co. is trying to stomp a new enemy that's
sprouting up faster than the dread Micro-Goombas in Super
Mario Brothers 3: video stores that rent Nintendo games.
   With game prices in the range of $40 to $50, rental has
become an increasingly popular way for Nintendo addicts to
get a quick fix. Game rentals make up an estimated 5% to 15%
of the revenue of the nation's roughly 25,000 video stores,
up from virtually nothing three years ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nintendo, based in Kyoto, Japan, and the companies that
make games for the Nintendo system are lobbying Congress for
a law to ban game rental, which the House Judiciary Committee
is scheduled to vote on today. They argue that the rental
boom is cutting into Nintendo game sales, which they project
will total 70 million units this year.</p>
<p>Both sides can claim legal precedent thanks to the
patchwork of federal regulations covering rental of published
works. For instance, videos can be rented whereas records
cannot. Congress seems likely to pass a bill that would ban
the rental of personal-computer software. Game makers point
out that some titles are available both for PCs and Nintendo
machines, and say it makes no sense to ban rental of one
format and not the other.</p>
<p>The video-store industry argues that movie rentals haven't
damaged the movie business, despite Hollywood's anguished
predictions that they would. Even though video stores
typically don't pay royalties on rentals, the movie industry
makes huge revenue from sales to the stores.</p>
<p>In fact, some video-store owners say they ultimately help
Nintendo and the game-makers, who also don't earn royalties
from rentals. "I sell games mainly through rentals -- people
come in here, try a game, like it, and buy it," says Franklin
Sellars, owner of Videotape Home Systems Inc., a Pasadena,
Texas, store.</p>
<p>Nintendo and its allies deride this argument. They say
kids are renting games over and over again, not just once to
try them out. "Consumers can obtain complete use and
enjoyment of many video games through rental without
purchasing them, creating lost sales to the copyright owner,"
said Bruce Davis, chairman of gamemaker Mediagenic, in
testimony to Congress this summer.</p>
<p>The video-store lobby argues that the rationale for
anti-rental laws should be to prevent copying. It is easy for
consumers to copy records and PC software, but there is no
simple way to duplicate a Nintendo game (although Nintendo
has been circulating advertisements for a game-copying device
marketed overseas by a Taiwanese concern, Baelih Co.).</p>
<p>The fight over game rentals has emerged as the most
contentious part of the broader bill to ban PC software
rental. That's still a tiny business, but the software
industry wants to be sure it doesn't explode the way video
rental has.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the bill, the video-store industry
swiftly pushed through a clause exempting video games from
the ban. Nintendo fought back, but the exemption survived in
the version that passed the full Senate in May and a House
subcommittee last week.</p>
<p>This summer, Rep. Joe Barton (R., Texas) proposed a
compromise bill, backed by Nintendo, that would permit rental
one year after a video game's release. The Nintendo camp
compared this arrangement to a movie hitting the video stores
after it has had a chance to play in theaters.</p>
<p>Video-store owners were able to shoot down that version of
the bill. The first year of release "is precisely when a
video game is most popular," testified Thomas Carton, general
counsel of the giant Blockbuster Entertainment Corp.
video-store chain. "A one-year ban on rentals is not really a
`compromise'; it would gut the video game rental industry."</p>
<p>The tradition of American law favors the video-store
owners in this fight. In general, the "first sale doctrine"
holds that the buyer of a piece of property can dispose of it
however he likes, through sale, rental or almost any other
means.</p>
<p>The record industry, however, successfully persuaded
Congress six years ago to overrule this doctrine and ban
record rentals.</p>
<p>The PC software industry appears to have a consensus in
Congress that it deserves the same special treatment -- with
or without a clause banning video-game rentals. Nevertheless,
even apart from the Nintendo debate, the industry has run
into tremendous problems defining what it means by
"software."</p>
<p>The bill that passed the Senate and originally went before
the House made an exception for video games, but proposed to
ban rental of any other computer program, including any tape,
disk, or other medium embodying such a program.</p>
<p>This summer, some legislators and executives grew alarmed
that the bill's language appeared to cover the millions of
microchips in consumer and industrial products that have
programs embedded in them. For instance, Hertz Corp., the
car-rental giant, protested that the bill might cover the
microchips in automobiles.</p>
<p>The measure was rewritten last week to exclude software
"embodied in a machine or product and which cannot be copied
during the ordinary operation or use of that machine or
product."</p>
