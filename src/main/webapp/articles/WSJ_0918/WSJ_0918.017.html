	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Four real estate investment trusts controlled by
Gene E. Phillips and William S. Friedman, former top
executives of Southmark Corp., said dividends will be
determined on an annual basis after the trusts' current
calendar year ends, Dec. 31. Currently, dividends are
determined on a quarterly basis.
   A spokeswoman attributed the change to continuing
uncertainty over the ability of many of the trusts' borrowers
to meet their obligations and variable cash flows caused by
the expense of improving the trusts' real estate portfolios.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Despite the change in policy, the trusts will continue
making distributions agreed to earlier this year as part of
the settlement of a class-action suit over management of the
trusts. The four trusts agreed to make a minimum of the
following per-share distributions by May 23, 1991:
Continental Mortgage and Equity Trust, 94 cents; National
Income Realty Trust, $1.96; Income Opportunity Realty Trust,
33 cents; and Transcontinental Realty Investors, Inc., $1.06.
Per-share amounts are based on current numbers of shares
outstanding, the spokeswoman said.</p>
