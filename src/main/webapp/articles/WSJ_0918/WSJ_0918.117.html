	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- For years, the venerable Armand Hammer has
been jumping through hoops so that Occidental Petroleum could
pay hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends. Many people
are wondering if Dr. Hammer can keep it up.
   Most companies pay dividends out of profit. But during the
past nine years, the petrochemicals and energy company built
by 92-year-old Dr. Hammer has only once -- in 1984 -- earned
sufficient money from operations to cover dividend payments.
To raise cash for dividends, Oxy has had to sell assets and
issue new shares. Even if everything starts to go right for
Oxy, it isn't expected to earn its huge annual dividend of
$738 million at least until 1993.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Some analysts believe that Oxy, to keep up its dividend,
might have to sacrifice major assets or skimp on the capital
spending it needs to take advantage of higher oil prices. In
a recession, bears add, Dr. Hammer might even have to trim
the dividend that has been identified with his ironfisted
rule over the company.</p>
<p>Recently, Oxy shares, which sold above 30 earlier this
year, have been trading near their two-year low, partly
because of dividend concerns. With Oxy at 23 1/8 yesterday,
up 1/8, its $2.50 a share annual dividend rate gave the stock
a 10.7% yield, more than double the yields on other big oil
companies' stocks.</p>
<p>"As long as Dr. Hammer is active, he'll try his hardest to
keep the dividend," says Alan Gaines of Gaines Berland, a New
York brokerage firm. "But it's an imprudent dividend, and it
isn't carved in stone anymore." He adds: "If Oxy cut its
dividend in half, it would have a $15 stock."</p>
<p>Ray Irani, Oxy's president and the expected successor to
Dr. Hammer, says: "I want to assure you that we will have no
problem paying our dividend."</p>
<p>Oxy's capital spending this year will be about $1.3
billion, lower than some analysts expected. And Mr. Irani
says 1991 spending will fall to about $1 billion -- but only
because Oxy will complete rebuilding a damaged North Sea
production platform. "We aren't cutting back on exploration"
and don't plan to sell major assets or issue more stock to
pay dividends, Mr. Irani insists.</p>
<p>Oxy may be betting on its North Sea interests to bail it
out of an almost decadelong cash shortage. When Oxy's North
Sea oil begins flowing in 1992, cash flow could rise by $350
million a year, says Salomon Brothers analyst Bernard Picchi.</p>
<p>Right now, the Mideast turmoil is a mixed blessing for
Oxy. Though higher oil prices help its energy business, about
50% of Oxy's profit is generated by petrochemical operations
that are in the doldrums and could worsen in recession,
analysts say.</p>
<p>Salomon's Mr. Picchi expects Oxy's petrochemical profit
this year to dive by almost 30%, to about $700 million;
that's still more than double estimated oil-and-gas profit.
And for 1991, Merrill Lynch recently trimmed its per-share
profit estimate for Oxy by five cents to $1.35, citing "above
average" exposure to an economic slowdown. Oxy also has big
interest bills on long-term debt totaling about $8 billion.</p>
<p>Some people believe that when Mr. Irani succeeds Dr.
Hammer he'll review Oxy's dividend and perhaps sell the IBP
beef processor or coal or energy assets to cut debt. But Mr.
Irani says: "I'm totally in support of maintaining the
dividend." Questions on future asset sales are "speculative,"
he adds.</p>
<p>An Oxy spokesman says Dr. Hammer keeps Oxy's big dividend
because "he has a genuine feeling of responsibility to retail
investors" who hold most of Oxy's shares.</p>
<p>Dr. Hammer isn't a major Oxy holder. Still, with about 1.3
million Oxy shares he received about $3.3 million in
dividends last year, more than his 1989 salary of $2.3
million.</p>
<p>Since the stock market crash of October 1987, many oil
stocks have doubled or better, but Oxy is barely above its
1987 low of 22 3/8. One reason: It diversified into cyclical
petrochemicals. And since 1984, Oxy has trebled its shares
outstanding, eroding existing holders' stake in the company.</p>
<p>If the economy in fact doesn't tank and petrochemical
prices don't go any lower, Oxy could prosper and Dr. Hammer
could bask in glory.</p>
<p>C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell analyst Frederick Leuffer
says if there's no recession and crude oil sells for $25 to
$28 a barrel next year, Oxy will plug the hole in its cash
flow {which he puts at $250 million in 1990} and stop
"depleting itself" to pay dividends.</p>
<p>With Oxy stock above 25 early last month, Mr. Leuffer says
he told investors "to buy the heck out of it." So far, he has
been wrong but he maintains: "I think Oxy is good for 30 in
12 months."</p>
