	<p class="article-leader">United Airlines, Trans World Airlines and Northwest
Airlines said yesterday they are matching other airlines'
attempt to raise domestic fares 4.2% as of Oct. 1.
   The fare rise is almost certain to go into effect. The
three carriers were the last major airlines to match rivals'
plans to raise fares.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>United is a unit of UAL Corp., and Northwest is a
subsidiary of NWA Inc.</p>
<p>The carriers said the fare rise will affect all of their
domestic fares. Through their lobbying group, the airlines
have presented a separate proposal before the U.S.
Transportation Department and foreign governments to raise
international fares 6% to 10% on Oct. 1 as well.</p>
<p>If the 4.2% domestic fare rise goes into effect, it will
be the second widespread increase in about a month. Airlines
raised their domestic fares 5.3% on Aug. 31.</p>
<p>The airlines are battling fuel costs that have risen as
much as 50% since Iraq invaded Kuwait in early August.
Because fuel expenses are the second-largest operating
expense for the carriers, airline executives say their
carriers have been particularly stung by the rise in oil
prices.</p>
