	<p class="article-leader">"As we move from the Cold War to the trade war, there is.
. . ," -- Senator Ernest Hollings, (D., S.C.) Sept. 9, 1990</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This space has often warned about trade war, but now we
learn that Senator Hollings has already declared one. He's
even planned his own protectionist Sarajevo, the "Textile,
Apparel and Footwar Trade Act of 1990." If war results, at
least we'll know where to find the assassins.</p>
<p>They'll sit in the U.S. Congress. The Senate has already
passed (68-32) the textile bill, and the House will take its
turn today. Members no doubt figure it's a cheap vote that
won't matter because President Bush is certain to veto. But
coming when it does, amid the Iraq crisis and at endgame in
the Uruguay Round of global-trade talks, the textile bill is
a shot heard 'round the world. The last trade war, which the
U.S. did much to start with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, was
called the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Yet today's protectionists are going all-out to override a
veto. The Cotton Lobby, for one, is gripped with war fever.
"Second phase of telephone blitz campaign is aimed at
generating calls to 80 congressional districts considered
crucial to House passage of bill and possible veto override,"
reports the lobby's newsletter. In addition, Reps. Marilyn
Lloyd of Tennessee and Newt Gingrich of Georgia have
generously "appeared for satellite media tour to generate
additional support throughout country." And "ads began
running in USA Today and other newspapers."</p>
<p>The industry can afford all this because it's already the
most coddled in the U.S. Cotton growers benefit from a quota
that limits raw-cotton imports to one day's consumption each
year. This virtual ban means U.S. companies pay more for
cotton than the rest of the world. It's also the reason many
big clothing makers oppose this bill; they can't get the
cotton they need at competitive prices.</p>
<p>Worse, textile and apparel makers are already protected by
a cartel known as the Multifiber Arrangement. Under the MFA,
the U.S. has negotiated more than 1,000 quotas with 38
countries. About 75% of all textile and apparel imports are
already covered by quotas, and the average tariff is nearly
20% (compared with 4% on all manufactured goods). A nice
monopoly, if you can get it.</p>
<p>But the industry wants more. The bill would force the U.S.
to tear up those 38 treaties and impose a global quota of 1%
growth a year. This will save a few textile jobs for a while,
but at a cost of some $70,000 a job a year. The payers will
be consumers who cough up more for shirts, towels, blue
jeans, socks. According to economist William Cline, the total
cost would run to more than $500 billion through the year
2000.</p>
<p>All of this for an industry that isn't even suffering.
Textile employment actually rose from 1985 to 1989, while
fiber consumption by the industry jumped to an all-time
record last year. Exports rose by 27% and capacity use was
close to 90%. Unemployment in the states that would benefit
the most from the bill -- the Carolinas, other parts of the
South -- is actually lower than the national average.
Liberals could be denouncing this transfer of wealth from
poor to the rich, but their loyalty to unions counts for more
than equity.</p>
<p>The timing of this bill also suggests malice toward the
global economic system; a trade war would make everyone
poorer, as it did in the 1930s. Also, the textile bill is in
particular a stick in the eye of many countries President
Bush has adeptly persuaded to join an alliance against Iraq.
Turks and Egyptians can fight next to Americans in the
Mideast, but they can't sell their shoes in Chicago.</p>
<p>In a recent letter to House Speaker Foley, Secretary of
State Baker wrote, "This legislation would compound the
problems being faced by a number of countries which have
stood with us in the Gulf crisis despite the economic losses
they are incurring." The fact that his trade war might help
us lose a real war doesn't seem to bother Senator Hollings.</p>
<p>The world is more economically entwined than ever, but
Congress and the textile lobby seem to think this is the
mercantilist 17th century. The textile bill is a warning shot
to the Bush White House not to return from the Uruguay Round
of trade talks with more liberal rules for textiles. Laying
aside the effects on the world economy or the Middle Eastern
hostilities, a collapse at Uruguay will harm efficient U.S.
exporters -- farmers, high-tech companies, Boeing workers.
The Honorable Members don't seem to care; every war has its
casualties.</p>
