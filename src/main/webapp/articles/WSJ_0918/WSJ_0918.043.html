	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The U.K. Department of Trade and Industry said
it sued British Aerospace PLC and Rover Group PLC to recover
#44.4 million ($84 million) in subsidies made illegally to
the two companies at the time of British Aerospace's takeover
of the troubled motor car group in 1988.
   The action to recover the money was forced on the agency
by the ruling of the European Commission earlier this year
that said secret financial concessions made to British
Aerospace amounted to illegal state aid.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>British Aerospace had until Aug. 17 to repay the money.
Since it hasn't yet done so, the government said it was
obliged to carry out the EC's directive by trying to recover
the funds through the courts.</p>
<p>Because of the ongoing court proceedings, British
Aerospace wouldn't comment on the writs, beyond saying the
company must appeal the EC decision "to protect our
shareholders." It isn't known when the Court of Justice will
render its decision.</p>
