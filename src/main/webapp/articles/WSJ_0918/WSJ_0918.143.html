	<p class="article-leader">Newmont Mining Corp., Denver, said it retained Potter
Warburg & Co., of Melbourne, Australia, to advise the company
concerning its 24% stake in Newmont Australia Ltd.
   Newmont Mining sold a 19.99% stake in Newmont Australia to
Poseidon Gold Ltd. last month for $137.7 million, or $1.04 a
share. Newmont said at the time it would either sell its
remaining shares -- the 24% stake -- under a Poseidon Gold
offer or on the open market. Poseidon is offering to exchange
one of its shares for every two shares of Newmont Australia
it doesn't already own.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Newmont said it will wait to sell its shares until Newmont
Australia has evaluated the Poseidon offer.</p>
