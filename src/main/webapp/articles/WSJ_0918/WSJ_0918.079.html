	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Department of Education stopped
disbursement of all federal education funds to the DeKalb
County School District, Georgia's largest, after finding
violations of a law that bars discrimination against
handicapped persons.
   The order will halt more than $7 million in annual federal
aid to the 72,000 students in the suburban Atlanta school
system. The department found that DeKalb County illegally
refused to allow federal inspectors to investigate
allegations of discrimination against handicapped students.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>County officials contend that the department's Office of
Civil Rights doesn't have the authority it claims to enforce
the Education for the Handicapped Act.</p>
<p>Funding-termination actions are "rarer than hen's teeth,"
said Richard Komer, deputy assistant secretary of education
for civil rights. The last such order was in 1982, and this
is the first time the department has stopped funding over
alleged discrimination against handicapped students, he said.</p>
<p>DeKalb County, which has been fighting since 1984 to
challenge the department's attempt to use an
anti-discrimination statute to police the Education for the
Handicapped Act, has asked a federal district court to enjoin
the government from terminating funding.</p>
