	<p class="article-leader">Sprinting ahead of both competitors and its own earnings
estimates, Nike Inc. reported record net income of $99.7
million, or $2.62 a share, for the first quarter, ended Aug.
31. That was a 31% rise from the like period last year, when
the Beaverton, Ore., company earned $75.9 million, or $2.01 a
share.
   Even more significantly, the athletic footwear and apparel
company's world-wide orders for the next five months are up
42% from a year ago, exceeding the $1 billion mark for the
first time.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue for the three-month period rose 38% to a record
$833.6 million, up from $602.6 million in the prior year.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the company's stock slipped $3, to close at
$72 in national over-the-counter trading as investors who are
primed for nothing short of bravura performances from the
Beaverton, Ore., company apparently remained nonplussed by
the strong showing.</p>
<p>"I think the stock drop was unwarranted," said Gary
Jacobson, an analyst with Kidder Peabody, who follows the
company and is recommending a "strong hold" on the stock.
"Investors have come to expect positive surprises from Nike.
And while this is very good, it's not a surprise." Mr.
Jacobson noted that investors punished Nike like this once
before, in the third quarter last year, in the face of a
shining earnings report.</p>
<p>The company's stock did rise about 10% last week, in
anticipation of the earnings announcement and some analysts
speculated that those investors sold yesterday, taking the
opportunity to make a quick profit. "It's a funny market
right now," Heidi Steinberg, an analyst who covers Nike for
Salomon Brothers, said, "and I think the expectations have
been so high that the fact that the earnings came in the
analysts' range is suddenly not enough."</p>
<p>The company made its most substantial gains
internationally, where Nike launched an aggressive European
advertising campaign last year and bought out several of its
distributors to exert more control, analysts said. The
result: In this latest quarter, international sales increased
89% from the year before.</p>
<p>Nike has profited from the increasing popularity of the
"athletic look" in Europe and from the travails of Adidas,
its leading competitor there, Ms. Steinberg said. With Adidas
floundering after losing its founder last year, she says,
Nike has been able to shoot ahead of the pack. And the
company is in a much better position to spend aggressively on
advertising than its European rivals.</p>
<p>Domestically, the company is logging strong gains, too,
with sales of its athletic footwear up 31% in the quarter.
Domestic apparel sales increased 21% and non-athletic
footwear climbed 20%.</p>
<p>"They look pretty damn good, especially at a time when the
whole retailing climate is sluggish," said Fred Anschel, an
analyst who follows the company for Dean Witter Reynolds.
"There's been very little markdown pressure for them."</p>
