	<p class="article-leader">Barden Corp., said it signed a definitive agreement to be
acquired for $131 million by FAG Bearings Corp., the U.S.
subsidiary of FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schaefer KGaA, a West
German manufacturer of bearings and industrial systems.
   News of the transaction, based on an offer of $66.50 a
share, sent Barden shares soaring. They closed at $63, up
$30.50, in national over-the-counter trading.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Barden, headquartered in Danbury, Conn., is the last
independent U.S. manufacturer of precision ball bearings,
with about 20% of the domestic market.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, FAG Finance Corp., a unit of FAG
Bearings, will begin a tender offer for Barden's nearly two
million shares no later than Friday. FAG Finance doesn't own
any Barden shares at present. Barden said it expects the
offer to be completed next month, subject to U.S. regulatory
review.</p>
<p>Barden President Stanley Noss, in a joint statement with
FAG Bearings, said Barden had entertained "informal
overtures" from interested parties over the years, but none
had resulted in serious discussions.</p>
<p>"We were looking for a partner with strong resources and
technical capabilities so we could address the market
efficiently. Foreign vs. domestic doesn't mean anything" in
terms of who would acquire the company, Mr. Noss said. Barden
said it and FAG Bearings, based in Stamford, Conn., would
continue to operate separately and that all of Barden's
employees would be retained.</p>
<p>Walter Schwarz, president of FAG Bearings, cited an
"excellent strategic fit" of the two companies. FAG produces
heavy-duty bearings, a range of standardized ball bearings,
and aircraft and instrument bearings. Mr. Schwarz said FAG
plans to move its instrument-bearing operations from
Stratford, Ontario, to Barden's Danbury facility, as well as
introduce new lines there.</p>
<p>In 1989, Barden had sales of $98.2 million and earnings of
$2.9 million. FAG Kugelfischer had 1989 revenue of $2.8
billion.</p>
<p>In the past five years, Barden's three major domestic
competitors -- MPB Corp., Fafnir Bearings and New Hampshire
Ball Bearings Inc. -- have all been acquired. MBP was bought
by Timken Co. last May, Fafnir Bearings is now a division of
Ingersoll-Rand Co. and New Hampshire Ball Bearings is a unit
of Minebea Co. of Japan.</p>
