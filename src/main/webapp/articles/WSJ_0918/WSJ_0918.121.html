	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Three major exchanges are rushing out new
vehicles that allow investors to bet on the direction of the
Japanese stock market.
   Next week, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the Chicago
Board of Trade and the American Stock Exchange will offer two
new futures contracts and three new options contracts based
on Japanese stock indexes. The Amex and the CBOT expect, but
are still waiting for, U.S. regulatory approval.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>All three exchanges are trying to capitalize on the
successful launch earlier this year of warrants on the Nikkei
Index of 225 leading stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Active trading in the warrants, which are traded on the Amex,
indicated to exchanges that large and small investors were
interested in speculative bets on the world's second-biggest
stock market, after the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Most of the warrants were bets on a fall in the Tokyo
market, and the first of them came out just before Japanese
stocks plunged. From its record high of 38915.87 at the end
of last year, the Nikkei index has dropped 37%. Yesterday,
the index closed at 24365.60, a mere 2.6% above its low for
the year of 23737.63 on Aug. 23.</p>
<p>The warrants irked Japanese officials, who eventually
asked the Amex to hold off on listing more warrants. That's
one reason why the Amex is moving on to new ways to bet on
Tokyo stocks, though there still is resistance from Tokyo
exchange officials.</p>
<p>"In Tokyo, firms have been blaming index arbitrage for the
volatility in the stock markets," said one Japanese executive
familiar with the Tokyo exchange's thinking. The new Amex
options, he added, "would just add to that volatility."</p>
<p>Still, Amex Chairman James R. Jones said: "We commented
{to Tokyo exchange officials} that if the four products go
forward in Chicago, we were going to go forward. They are
sensitive and would like none of them to go forward."</p>
<p>Unable to get a license to the Nikkei Index, the Amex
developed its own "Japan Index" of 210 Japanese stocks. The
Amex boasts that it correlates better than 99% with the
Nikkei index.</p>
<p>The Amex, pending approval from the Securities and
Exchange Commission, wants to start trading options on the
Japan Index next Tuesday. Each morning, the Amex will make
public the closing price of its index, based on the
performance of the Tokyo market earlier that day. The Amex
product is a dollar-denominated index that will trade in
values of about 1/100 of the Nikkei; with the Nikkei index at
25,000, the Amex index value would be $250. Options trading
on the index are so-called European style, meaning they can
be cashed in only on the expiration date.</p>
<p>The Chicago Merc is offering futures contracts on the
Nikkei index, and options on the futures. The Merc is also
converting its index to a dollar denomination from yen, in
which the Nikkei index is normally calculated. The Merc has
secured approval from the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, and plans to launch its products next Tuesday.</p>
<p>The CBOT is offering futures on the Tokyo exchange's own
Topix index, which is based on the 1,229 companies listed on
the first section of the exchange, and options on Topix
futures. The CBOT plans to start trading the new products
next Thursday.</p>
<p>Only the CBOT products will trade briefly with the Tokyo
market in a two-hour-and-fifteen-minute night session. Also,
the CBOT's product is denominated in yen. Currently, the CBOT
has a night session in U.S. Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>An option generally gives its holder the right, but not
the obligation, to buy or sell securities, currencies or in
this case the value of an index at a specific price on or
before a certain date. Some options, such as the new Amex
issue, can be exercised only on their expiration date.
Warrants are similar, but are often less flexible than
options.</p>
<p>Initially, some money managers and brokers are skeptical
about the Amex's Japan Index options. "I don't think European
investors, which are some of the most substantial holders of
Japanese stocks among non-Japanese, will be willing to trade
this new product," said an executive at Japan's Nomura
Securities Co. He said the Amex index hasn't any recognition
among investors, as do the Nikkei and Topix indexes.</p>
<p>"People will be reluctant to invest," added the Nomura
executive. "There's got to be some sort of a super selling
point to be successful; I don't think the Japan Index has
that."</p>
<p>The Amex declined to comment, but privately exchange
officials said the Japanese don't appreciate having their
indexes imitated.</p>
<p>Barry M. Gillman, managing director at PCM International,
an international money management unit of Prudential
Insurance Co. of America in Newark, N.J., also said his firm
probably wouldn't be interested in buying the Amex options.</p>
<p>PCM already uses over-the-counter options on the Nikkei
average that are sold by big U.S. investment banks to hedge
its Japanese stock holdings. Like the warrants, they are
American-style options, which allow the holder to exercise
the options prior to their expiration.</p>
<p>"We like the flexibility to be able to exercise it at any
time," said Mr. Gillman. "And in terms of hedging against
market risk, this {the Amex options} doesn't seem to offer
any tremendous advantage."</p>
<p>Many Chicago traders say the key to whether the Board of
Trade and Merc stock-index futures fly is the response of
Japanese traders.</p>
<p>"I think they might be slow to enter when they're already
using their own local markets," says Joseph Cole, senior vice
president and research director for Indosuez Carr Futures
Inc. in Chicago. "You have to ask what the incentive is. I
don't necessarily see it." Futures and options on the Topix
and Nikkei indexes trade actively in Japan.</p>
<p>At least one small investor was intrigued by the Amex
product. Jeffrey Grossman, a real estate consultant in
Framingham, Mass., says he made money in Nikkei warrants and
would consider playing the Japanese stock market through
options. "I would be very interested" in options on a
Japanese stock-market benchmark, he said.</p>
<p>The outlook for the Tokyo stock market is anything but
clear. While some money managers believe -- even hope -- that
it is near bottoming out, others aren't sure.</p>
<p>Mr. Gillman said, "We'd rather see the direction turn
upward before buying. If it went through 20000 on freefall,
there's no particular level at which we'd say this is a
bargain," he said.</p>
