	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Foreign-educated doctors are stepping up
challenges to U.S. licensing practices they say discriminate
against them.
   More than 130,000 doctors -- 21% of the U.S. total -- were
educated in foreign medical schools. Most of these are
foreign-born, though some 20,000 are Americans who took
medical degrees abroad, often because they couldn't get into
U.S. medical schools.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Foreign medical graduates come from all over the world,
but the largest numbers have migrated here from India and the
Philippines. They have moved into all fields of American
medicine, and according to an American Hospital Association
study, they play a particularly important role in caring for
indigent populations in such cities as New York, Detroit and
Chicago. About half of the foreign-educated physicians
practice in five states: New York, California, Florida,
Illinois and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Despite the role of foreign graduates in U.S. medicine,
"discrimination against fully trained and qualified foreign
medical graduates in the areas of jobs, promotions, hospital
privileges, licensing, reciprocity and other facets of
medical practice" is common, says Navin Shah of the
International Association of American Physicians. "Under
false pretense of quality patient care, the authorities are
clandestinely eliminating the foreign medical graduates from
the practice of medicine" in order to protect jobs for
American-educated physicians, he charges.</p>
<p>Munni Setty says she ran into difficulty when she sought a
license to practice in Colorado in 1988. After graduating
from medical school in India in 1982, she completed a
three-year residency in Chicago, won certification as a
specialist in internal medicine and received licenses to
practice in California and Illinois. For American medical
school graduates licensed to practice in one state, it's easy
to win licenses in other states, but Dr. Setty says she
encountered a lengthy delay in Colorado.</p>
<p>Among other things, the Colorado State Board of Medical
Examiners asked her to supply resumes of her medical school
professors at the University of Bombay. "This was rather
impractical and almost impossible to obtain," she says. "I
think it was just purely discrimination."</p>
<p>Thomas Beckett, administrator of the Colorado board, says:
"I emphatically deny it. Every board has a responsibility to
determine that applicants go to a decent medical school." He
notes that state licensing laws require boards to develop
ways to assess foreign medical schools. "Some states ask how
many books there are in the library," he says.</p>
<p>Because many foreign graduates attended Third World
medical schools where standards of teaching, technology and
clinical practice differ significantly from those in U.S.
medical schools, state licensing officials say they must rely
on a series of tests and credential checks to determine if
foreign graduates are qualified to practice. But, under
pressure from foreign-educated doctors, U.S. officials in the
past few years have streamlined the process for foreign
graduates.</p>
<p>One change allows foreign graduates to take the same
certification test that U.S. medical school graduates take,
rather than a different test for foreigners only. "We are
happy that the same exams are given," says Dr. Shah, an
India-educated urologist who practices in Maryland. "Until
now, they always labeled us as second-rate because we took a
different exam. We want the same paper." Other steps to make
testing more uniform are in the works.</p>
<p>The International Association of American Physicians, an
umbrella group that includes the Islamic Medical Association,
the Association of Philippine Physicians in America and other
organizations of foreign medical graduates here, also is
pressing Congress to pass laws that would prohibit state
licensing boards from discriminating against doctors educated
abroad. Several anti-discrimination bills calling for federal
monitoring of state licensing practices have been introduced.</p>
<p>The American Medical Association concedes that some
foreign graduates "have been subject to requirements
different from other physicians" and opposes such
discrimination. But the AMA, worried about growing federal
control over medicine, has testified against bills that would
give the federal government a stronger role in licensing.
Instead, the AMA is starting its own service for collecting
and verifying physicians' credentials as a way to help
foreign graduates deal with requests from state licensing
boards.</p>
<p>Officials at the state boards deny that their rules are
designed to keep foreign doctors out. But "there are a few
extra hoops (foreign graduates) have to go through," says
Kathryn Hill, assistant executive vice president of the
Federation of State Medical Boards in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>
<p>Before they can practice in the U.S., foreign medical
graduates must pass a rigorous series of tests. First they
must show proficiency in English and a command of basic
medicine. The tests aren't easy. Of the 13,000 to 15,000
foreign graduates who take the tests each year, about 60%
pass the English test and about 25% pass the basic medical
science test, according to the Educational Commission of
Foreign Medical Graduates, the Philadelphia organization that
administers the tests.</p>
<p>After passing these tests, foreign graduates must complete
one to three years of training in a residency program in a
U.S. hospital and pass a nationwide exam before being
licensed to practice by various state medical boards. About
81% of the foreign graduates who took the test for the first
time in June passed.</p>
<p>Despite progress in eliminating differences between the
tests that foreign and U.S. medical school graduates take,
discrimination still exists, contend foreign graduates, who
regard some requirements as unnecessary. "Medical school is
only part of what makes a complete doctor," says Neopito
Robles, an Arizona surgeon from the Philippines. "Part is
training, and part is experience."</p>
<p>Part of that experience, too, is learning about the
American political system. Some members of Congress who have
introduced bills to help foreign doctors have made it clear
that they expect something in return. Rep. Stephen Solarz
(D., N.Y.), a sponsor of one of the bills, recently sent a
letter to doctors asking them to contribute to the Solarz
Congressional Club "to provide much needed help for my
re-election and to assist candidates who support us in our
efforts to help (foreign graduates)."</p>
