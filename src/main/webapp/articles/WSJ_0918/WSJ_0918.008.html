	<p class="article-leader">KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Applebee's International Inc. said its
board authorized the purchase of its common because the board
believes the current market price doesn't reflect its true
value.
   The restaurant developer said it will make "aggressive
purchases" of as many as 100,000 shares in the open market.</p>

closed at $9.75 a share, up $1.</p>
