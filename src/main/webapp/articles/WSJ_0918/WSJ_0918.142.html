	<p class="article-leader">Citing weakness in the stock market, King World
Productions Inc. withdrew its proposed $36 million public
offering for Merlin Program Capital Inc.
   New York-based King World, a syndicator of television
shows, filed the Merlin offering with the Securities and
Exchange Commission two months ago. Its plan was to set up
Merlin as a fund to expand production. Each investment unit
was to include one share in Merlin, priced at $16 a share,
plus a warrant to purchase a common share of King World in
several years at a price set now.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, as the stock market has declined in recent weeks,
King World's stock has fallen about 15%, closing yesterday at
$21.50 a share. The warrants would have been priced at about
a 30% premium to the current stock price, said Jeffrey
Epstein, chief financial officer of King World. "We don't
want to dilute current shareholders by issuing equity at
these prices," he said.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of the offering won't constrain King
World's ability to develop new television shows, said Mr.
Epstein.</p>
