	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson warned
that the Canadian economy could show a further contraction in
the current third quarter following a 0.4% decline in the
April-June period.
   Mr. Wilson also predicted that the government's fiscal
1991 budget deficit will be 1 billion to 1.5 billion Canadian
dollars (US$864 million to US$1.30 billion) higher than the
C$28.5 billion gap forecast in the government's Feb. 20
budget. Fiscal 1991 ends March 31, 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The minister said in a speech that he now expects the
country's gross domestic product to show inflation adjusted
growth of about 1% this year, down from a budget forecast of
1.3%. Gross domestic product is the total value of a nation's
output of goods and services.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson said the government's anti-inflation policy was
working. In recent months, a moderation of economic activity
has been accompanied by a moderation in the growth of credit
demand, he said.</p>
<p>He attributed the deterioration in the government's budget
deficit outlook to rising debt costs resulting from
higher-than-expected interest costs.</p>
