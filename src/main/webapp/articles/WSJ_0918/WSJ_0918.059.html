	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- Everyone in Moscow is in a hurry. No one ever
slows down to let you pass in front of him. The reason is
that you will probably both be competing for the same spot in
the next line. Which line doesn't matter, because Muscovites
stand in a growing line first, and ask what it is for later.
   Variations on this scenario are certainly familiar in any
Third World nation. While it is true that the Soviet Union is
in many ways as poor as or poorer than most Third World
countries, Moscow doesn't look Third World. Many of the
city's buildings are quite beautiful. People on the street
look generally healthy, well-coiffed and educated. Yet
because their education -- and perestroika -- allows them
access to information about the world market, their
resentment is all the greater. They now talk of themselves as
"Fourth Worlders" -- First Worlders forced into a Third World
environment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Until recently, what the public wanted never mattered much
in the police state that was the Soviet Union. These days,
though, citizens are playing an important role in deciding
which direction the country takes. The question is how long
this moment of choice will last. Ominous signs are collecting
that the old power blocs may be about to engage in desperate
acts to maintain their privileges.</p>
<p>Some of the drama of the current struggle was played out
recently on the stage of a conference in Moscow, "Transition
to Freedom." The conference, sponsored by the free-market
Cato Institute, took place during a week that the parliaments
of Russia and the Soviet Union were deciding on critical
economic reforms. U.S. free-market scholars such as James
Buchanan, Paul Craig Roberts and George Gilder faced off
against Soviets representing virtually the entire spectrum of
economic programs debated by the Soviet leadership. Talk
ranged from the most conservative -- read, socialist --
approach advocated by advisers to Soviet Prime Minister
Nikolai Ryzhkov to more-free-market policies recommended by
economists Alexei Yavlinsky and Stanislav Shatalin. The
conservatives were on the defensive.</p>
<p>Early on, Cato President Ed Crane reminded the large
audience that "the government that governs least governs
best." When he said this in English, the jaded free
marketeers from the West simply nodded in approval. But when
the Russian translator finished, hundreds of Russians clapped
and cheered wildly. Only a handful of die-hard Communists sat
glum-faced, arms folded.</p>
<p>As the conference continued, it became clear that some of
the speakers were going beyond academics. Radical economists
from Russia and other republics used the podium to call for
action against the Ryzhkov conservatives.</p>
<p>Alexei Yemelyanov, professor of economics and member of
Russia's Supreme Soviet, took the first swipe at Mr.
Gorbachev: "{Mr. Gorbachev} refuses to talk about property
rights. Instead, he and other Kremlin leaders are obsessed
with creating more laws. Yesterday, they created 33 new ones.
Gorbachev wants to shield the power centers with paper."</p>
<p>The diminutive Russian economist Larisa Piyasheva
delivered a speech filled with fire. "There has been not one
step toward a real free market," she said. "Gorbachev says he
favors the co-ops, but he continues to support legislation
that works against them {like 80% tax rates the moment they
become profitable}. There is no independent wholesale market
for retailers. And since the ruble is not convertible,
retailers cannot buy on the world market. This favors the
underground mafia that has connections with state
bureaucrats. The strategy of the government program is to
destroy the private economy -- it leads to a new total
slavery based on the power of the mafia."</p>
<p>But even Ms. Piyasheva's condemnations could not match the
midday finale. Moscow Mayor -- and Boris Yeltsin protege --
Gavriil Popov was due to deliver a simple speech. Instead he
stepped to the dais fresh with news that Prime Minister
Ryzhkov had just double-crossed the free-market reformers by
denouncing a free-market plan in the Soviet Parliament (in
the news here as the Shatalin plan), rather than presenting
it equally for consideration along with a "conservative"
plan.</p>
<p>After first charging that the Communist apparatchiks were
attempting to "privatize" by turning state property over to
themselves, Mr. Popov announced: "There have been dramatic
changes today. The old forces are threatening the new
program. We may have to ask the people to go into the streets
{if this doesn't change}. We have just entered the most
dramatic period in our process." (Indeed, on Sunday, Mr.
Popov's supporters did take to the streets by the thousands.)</p>
<p>Mr. Popov was followed by Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak,
who recently established a free-trade zone for his city. He
criticized Mr. Ryzhkov, saying the prime minister hadn't even
read the {Shatalin} report he publicly condemned. While Mr.
Sobchak didn't threaten demonstrations, he left little doubt
that he simply would not accept Mr. Ryzhkov's authority.</p>
<p>This time the "people" -- as the radicals would call them
-- won. The day after the mayors' protest, Mr. Gorbachev
announced that he favored the "Shatalin" plan adopted by the
Russian Parliament. But the Soviet Parliament has yet to
approve it.</p>
<p>However they vary in their commitment to market changes,
radicals in the Russian and other republics are united in
trying to clean out the old party apparatus. Vladimir Isakov,
who was acting chairman of the chamber of republics on the
day I interviewed him (Mr. Yeltsin was sick), put it bluntly:
"One of the main features of a democracy is that central
leadership is forced to give up power to lower, broader
levels of government. And there are few examples in history
when a power elite gives up that power peacefully. But the
government of Mr. Ryzhkov will be one of the exceptions that
make the rule."</p>
<p>Criticizing Mr. Ryzhkov these days does not carry with it
great risks. Still, the political chutzpah of the radicals in
condemning Soviet leadership surely causes great alarm among
the entire apparat. In fact, what is being attempted is
nothing less than a revolution against taxation without
representation. Mr. Gorbachev, the Supreme Soviet and all the
ministries -- including the army and the KGB -- are coming to
be seen as Britain before the revolution. Mr. Yeltsin and the
Russian republic play the role of the patriots who started
the tea party.</p>
<p>The economic plan just accepted by the Russian Supreme
Soviet (and tabled by the Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.) is
not merely significant for its moves toward market changes.
It is also the beginning of a move toward economic
independence from the Supreme Soviet by Russia. And if Russia
-- by far the largest and wealthiest (if one can use that
term) republic -- will not pay tribute to the Soviet Union,
who will?</p>
<p>Since Mr. Yeltsin and his political allies -- including
the mayors of Moscow and Leningrad -- bear no allegiance to
the Communist Party, they are unlikely to pay tribute
willingly to a branch of government whose primary purpose has
been maintaining the predominance of the party. Indeed,
privately, they have said as much. But that leaves open the
question of who will pay the salaries of the army and the
KGB, both of which are still very visible and functioning
institutions. How will these institutions react to
uncertainty? One senses apprehension about this question both
in the corridors of power and in the streets.</p>
<p>I walk with a Russian friend through Moscow's back streets
looking for a place to eat. We see a very young man in a KGB
uniform. My friend says the government is recruiting many
young KGB men now. He fears this may be the beginning of a
buildup for a KGB takeover of the country. "Something is
going to happen within a year," he says. "Can't you feel it
-- in the stores, in the lines, on the streets? Every power
sector is getting prepared for a showdown."</p>
<p>The feelings of my friend take on frightening proportions
when supported by an official working closely with the group
of anti-Communist reformers. He says troops are concentrating
around Moscow.</p>
<p>Perhaps this Yeltsin supporter is just posturing for
sympathy. But it's not difficult to see where some Yeltsin
supporters want to move now: They must convince the army and
the KGB that Mr. Gorbachev is the leader of a shell
government and that if they come over to the republic's side,
they will be better off. In fact, in an interview with
journalists Gennady Musaelyan and Mikhail Poltoranin, Mr.
Yeltsin criticizes the Defense Ministry now under Mr.
Gorbachev's control, saying: "The Defense Ministry has turned
a blind eye to the plight of its servicemen. And let's be
quite frank about this. These are people who do not owe the
state anything. In fact, it's the state that owes them."</p>
<p>If you were, say, a captain in the KGB, whom would you
follow?</p>
