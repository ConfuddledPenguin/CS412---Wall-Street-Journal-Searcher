	<p class="article-leader">HOLLYWOOD -- Geffen Records said it ended its agreement to
manufacture and distribute music produced by Def American
Recordings, escalating the controversy over violent and
sexually graphic lyrics in popular music.
   Geffen had already refused to release Def American's
latest record by The Geto Boys, a Houston-based rap group
whose lyrics go well beyond those of 2 Live Crew -- the group
that was arrested in Florida earlier this year. In one Geto
Boys song, a man murders a woman and copulates with the
corpse.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Geffen had already released records by other controversial
Def American acts like Andrew Dice Clay and the heavy metal
groups Slayer and Danzig, often removing the Geffen logo from
the packages but distributing them nonetheless.</p>
<p>The Geto Boys simply accelerated a growing disenchantment
with Def American's lineup, the company said. "It's a
personal choice," said Chairman David Geffen. "I think anyone
has the right to make any record they want, but I don't have
to produce it. It's one thing to tell dirty jokes -- I'm not
offended by 2 Live Crew -- but murder and mutilation, I don't
want to be a part of it."</p>
<p>Def American's contribution to Geffen's profits is less
than 1%, the company said. Time Warner's record division,
which already agreed to manufacture the Geto Boys album, is
expected to distribute the record and the whole Def American
line. Unresolved was what label within Time Warner's
sprawling music business would lend its name to Def American.
Geffen itself distributes its records through Time Warner,
though in 1991 it will become a unit of MCA Inc., which
acquired it for about $600 million last March.</p>
