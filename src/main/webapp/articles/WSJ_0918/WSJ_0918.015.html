	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it is
reviewing its ratings of the long-term debt of three Japanese
banks and some units for possible downgrading.
   The three banks are Mitsubishi Bank, rated triple-A; Tokai
Bank, rated double-A-2; and Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan,
or LTCB, also rated double-A-2. The respective Prime-1
ratings of the short-term debt of the banks aren't being
reviewed, Moody's said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mitsubishi and Tokai are Japanese "city banks,"
institutions with nationwide networks of branches. LTCB is
one of Japan's three designated long-term credit banks, which
are primarily wholesale lenders.</p>
<p>Last month Moody's downgraded two Japanese city banks,
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and Fuji Bank, after placing them under
review in the spring. And still earlier this year Moody's
downgraded several trust banks, Mitsui Trust & Banking Corp.,
Mitsubishi Trust & Banking Corp. and Yasuda Trust & Banking
Corp.</p>
<p>Now put under review, Moody's said, are:</p>
<p>-- Mitsubishi Bank's long-term deposits, senior debt and
standby letter-of-credit obligations and the senior debt of
the bank's guaranteed subsidiary, Mitsubishi Bank of
Australia Ltd.</p>
<p>-- Tokai Bank's long-term deposits, senior debt and
letter-of-credit backed obligations.</p>
<p>-- LTCB's long-term deposits, senior debt and long-term
standby letter-of-credit obligations, Long-Term Credit Bank
of Japan Finance N.V.'s senior debt and LTCB Australia Ltd.'s
long-term deposits.</p>
<p>Moody's cited Mitsubishi Bank's "relatively weak core
profitability and competitive positions among its Japanese
peers" and "vulnerability to domestic asset-quality
deterioration."</p>
<p>In reviewing Tokai Bank, Moody's will look at the lender's
quality of assets, especially "its domestic real
estate-related loan portfolio and its overseas credits," as
well as its core earnings and competitiveness, the rating
concern said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, LTCB's "weakening franchise as a wholesale
bank" as well as the bank's asset quality will come under
scrutiny, Moody's said.</p>
