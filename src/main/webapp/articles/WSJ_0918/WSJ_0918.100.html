	<p class="article-leader">Moody's Investors Service Inc., saying a continuing
decline in consumer spending will "inhibit" Sears, Roebuck &
Co.'s efforts to boost results at its merchandising group,
lowered its rating on about $6.9 billion in debt issued by
the Chicago concern.
   The rating company said it took the action because it
thinks "improvement within the intensely competitive
merchandising sector has not been nor will be achieved as
quickly as originally anticipated." Moody's also cited the
"increased use of leverage in Sears's businesses."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moody's put Sears ratings under review last month.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York company said "the continued
decline in consumer confidence in the economy and therefore,
in consumer spending, will inhibit Sears's merchandising
group's efforts to reverse the decline in its market share
and to increase profitability."</p>
<p>The "slower-than-anticipated rollout of Sears's power
format strategies" -- under which the retail and financial
services giant has been adding brand-name products to its
lineup of house brands -- and the "challenge" of boosting
sales through the company's everyday-low-pricing policy are
"expected to continue to hamper gains in sales productivity."</p>
<p>Moody's also said that Sears's "slow and incomplete
implementation of cost-cutting steps" has made "meaningful"
improvements in earnings and cash flow difficult to achieve,
and projected Sears will have continued difficulty in
narrowing its cost position in comparison to competitors.</p>
<p>However, Moody's said, Sears has demonstrated that its
merchandising efforts can give it "merchandise selection and
presentation comparable to specialty stores." Should the
company complete the reformatting of a majority of its
stores, trim costs and streamline distribution, Sears "should
be able to capitalize on its national franchise and
significantly improve earnings performance," Moody's said.</p>
<p>A Sears spokesman, citing company policy, declined to
comment on the move.</p>
<p>Lowered to single-A-2 from single-A-1 were Moody's ratings
on senior debt of the parent, as well as its Sears Roebuck
Acceptance Corp., Sears Overseas Finance N.V. and Discover
Credit Corp. units.</p>
<p>In addition, Moody's reduced to single-A-3 from single-A-2
ratings on long-term deposits at Sears's Greenwood Trust Co.
and Sears Savings Bank units.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, Moody's downgraded its "insurance
financial strength rating" on Sears's Allstate Insurance Co.
and Allstate Life Insurance Co. to double-A-1 from triple-A.
While the insurance operation "enjoys a leadership position
in personal lines, strong capitalization and excellent asset
quality," Moody's said, its ratings were cut because of the
"increased risks to Allstate policyholders that could result
from credit deterioration at Sears."</p>
<p>Moody's also placed under review the triple-A insurance
financial strength rating at Allstate's PMI Mortgage
Insurance subsidiary, because of the downgrade at PMI's
Allstate parent. The review will focus on the quality and
scope of additional contractual support from a third party,
which PMI officials have said they are seeking, Moody's said.</p>
