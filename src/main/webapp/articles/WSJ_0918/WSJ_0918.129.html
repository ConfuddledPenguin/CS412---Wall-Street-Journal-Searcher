	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- A U.S. District Court jury convicted two former
executives of defunct Commodore Savings Association of bank
fraud charges in connection with a 1984 plan to divert $1
million of Commodore funds to an affiliate through a sham
real estate transaction.
   Former Commodore President Woodrow O. Brownlee and John W.
Harrell, former vice chairman and chief executive officer,
were each convicted of one count of misappropriation of funds
and one count of making false statements. Each count carries
a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Sentencing is
scheduled for Oct. 30.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A 1989 trial on the same charges had ended in a mistrial.</p>
<p>The executives were accused of arranging the illegal
transfer of $1 million of Commodore funds to National
Mortgage Corp. of America, a financially troubled company
owned by Commodore Chairman Robert H. Hopkins Jr. They also
were accused of causing Commodore to spend an additional $1
million to channel the funds to National Mortgage and of
lying to federal regulators about the transaction.</p>
<p>Mr. Harrell's attorney, William T. Hill, Jr., said his
client hadn't decided whether to appeal. Mr. Brownlee's
attorney couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>In May 1989, Robert Hopkins, his brother, E. Morten
Hopkins and Mr. Harrell were convicted on federal charges in
connection with a scheme to hide Commodore's illegal
donations to federal political campaigns. Robert Hopkins was
sentenced to 15 years in prison in that case and the other
two men received six-month prison sentences.</p>
