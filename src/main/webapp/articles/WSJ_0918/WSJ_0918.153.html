	<p class="article-leader">Hawker Siddeley Group PLC said pretax profit for the six
months ended June 30 slumped 29%, hit by a #27.5 million
($52.1 million) contracting loss at its Hawker Siddeley Power
Engineering unit.
   The British electrical and mechanical engineering concern
said pretax profit of #66.6 million, compared with #93.2
million a year ago, was below some market forecasts of #67
million to #70 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The group warned in July that its first-half profits would
fall short of year-ago earnings due to cost overruns at the
power engineering unit. The overruns arose from a combination
of contract delays and unsatisfactory administrative controls
when the unit became overextended by rapid expansion in 1988,
Hawker Siddeley said.</p>
<p>Profit after tax, less minority interests but before
extraordinary items, dropped 31% to #37.9 million from #55.2
million a year ago. Earnings per share fell to 19.1 pence
from 27.9 pence.</p>
<p>Hawker Siddeley reported an extraordinary loss of #10.7
million for the period, which it paid to settle disputed U.K.
corporation tax for a period between 1980 and 1984. The
company didn't report any extraordinary items in the year-ago
period.</p>
<p>Sales were up 14% to #1.12 billion from #981 million.</p>
