	<p class="article-leader">VeriFone Inc. said that third-quarter earnings would
likely fall short of analysts' estimates, and that it has
implemented cost containment measures in anticipation of
slower revenue growth.
   "Revenue growth in the second half of 1990 hasn't met our
internal expectations," Hatim Tyabji, president and chief
executive officer, said in a prepared statement. He cited
shortages in petroleum and North American emerging businesses
operations, but said the company's financial market and
international operations are continuing to exceed
expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>VeriFone, a Redwood City, Calif., supplier of transaction
automation systems, became publicly held in March. Its stock
traded as high as $26 a share in July, but has been drifting
lower in recent weeks. In national over-the-counter trading,
VeriFone closed yesterday at $12.875 a share, off $2.</p>
<p>According to Zacks Investment Research Inc., analysts
expected VeriFone to earn 25 cents to 27 cents a share for
the third quarter. In the year-earlier quarter, VeriFone
earned $2.6 million, or 13 cents a share, on revenue of $34.8
million.</p>
