	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Gordon Henderson, the hottest new designer on
Fashion Avenue, bickers with his backer.
   "One hundred thousand dollars just isn't enough," pouts
Mr. Henderson, who wants to hire yet another $2,000-an-hour
model and thinks he needs a more lavish stage set for his
October showing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But he will have to settle for a modest auditorium stage
at the Parsons School of Design and 15 young women to parade
his new creations.</p>
<p>"Gordon, I'm not prepared to be flexible on this," says
Ricky Sasaki, the money man. "We're not in show business.
We're in the business of selling clothes."</p>
<p>Mr. Sasaki's line of argument is a bit hard to sustain. If
fashion isn't show biz, then what is? In recent years, the
high end of the rag trade has come very much to resemble the
old Hollywood studio system, in which moguls controlled the
destiny and creative output of contract players.</p>
<p>Like MGM in the '40s, fashion houses try to create stars
who will have powerful box-office appeal. (And Mr. Henderson
is a budding star.)</p>
<p>But in couture, as in Hollywood, backers don't always
realize what they are in for when they start feeding royal
jelly to a talented newcomer. Soon enough, the star becomes
temperamental and starts making demands.</p>
<p>Some U.S. designers, including Calvin Klein and Bill
Blass, have managed themselves and control their own
companies. But in this brutal business, a lot of designers
today (Marc Jacobs, Mary Ann Restivo and Bill Robinson) end
up as employees. They need the capital, organization and
security a backer can give them. In the current business
climate, the big retail chains aren't taking the chances they
once did on unproven designers without big backing who don't
deliver on time and don't move the merchandise.</p>
<p>But in these new symbiotic relationships between money and
young talent, sparks fly when objectives clash. Mr. Henderson
dreams of creating couture that will make him a legend. Mr.
Sasaki dreams of making money. The result: tensions that can
dog the relationship.</p>
<p>Mr. Henderson is a handsome, 33-year-old Californian, who
was named Best New Talent of 1989 by the Council of Fashion
Designers of America for his moderately priced women's
sportswear. A 1984 graduate of Parsons, Mr. Henderson worked
as one of Calvin Klein's many assistants, sketching and
running errands. Then he free-lanced for a number of small
clothing companies until Mr. Sasaki came along.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old Mr. Sasaki, who was born in Tokyo, talks
fast and thinks big. He made his fortune by forming, with a
partner, World Hong Kong, a trading company that controls a
number of Far East factories that manufacture clothes for
popular women's labels like Anne Klein and Harve Benard.
World Hong Kong, a privately held company that claims to have
annual sales of about $250 million, also operates a dozen
designer boutiques in Hong Kong, Singapore and Tokyo. (Mr.
Sasaki is something of a clotheshorse himself, and he adores
shoes. He isn't in Imelda's league, but he does have 800
pairs.) Until Mr. Sasaki met up with Mr. Henderson, he had
never tried his hand at star-making.</p>
<p>The two men were introduced to each other by a member of
Mr. Sasaki's staff at Barocco, a downtown Manhattan
restaurant, in 1988. Mr. Sasaki then saw Mr. Henderson's work
and quickly signed him up. He appreciated the young
designer's knack for creating affordable casual fashion with
a twist. Doodads, buttons, pleats and embroidery are little
touches that distinguish his style. Mr. Sasaki knew that
selling designer clothes at moderate prices promised a bigger
and surer payoff than high fashion does.</p>
<p>Mr. Henderson's inexperience had its advantages, Mr.
Sasaki says now. "We could work with him and mold him."</p>
<p>Mr. Sasaki has invested some $4 million to launch Mr.
Henderson's star. And, in the space of two years, the young
designer, who dresses in faded jeans and T-shirts, has become
a fashion business sensation, a regular at New York
nightclubs and a celebrity model in print ads for the Gap
retail chain (including ads in the September Esquire and
October's Vanity Fair).</p>
<p>Mr. Sasaki has visions of the Gordon Henderson label going
beyond women's clothes to a range of goods from cosmetics to
bed sheets. But when he considers his rocky relationship with
Mr. Henderson, he knows he has a long way to go.</p>
<p>"I told Gordon that we now have to get our sales to catch
up with our publicity," Mr. Sasaki says. "But he is all ego.
He just wants to spend more money and doesn't think about the
bill. He has a big head."</p>
<p>Under the five-year contract between Mr. Henderson and Mr.
Sasaki, which has recently been extended to 10, Mr. Henderson
is responsible for designing the fashion collections that
bear his name, as well as choosing fabrics within a set price
range. Mr. Henderson draws a salary -- this year between
$250,000 and $300,000 -- based on the company's annual sales,
according to Mr. Sasaki. He says the the Gordon Henderson
division of World Hong Kong had 1989 sales of about $7
million, not enough to turn a dollar, but he expects the line
to be profitable in 1991.</p>
<p>Mr. Sasaki's end of the bargain includes manufacturing and
marketing Mr. Henderson's designs. With World Hong Kong's
world-wide connections, the company can get lower prices on
fabric, it has factories to execute production runs large and
small. World Hong Kong also pays all the expenses to maintain
Mr. Henderson's office and staff on West 40th Street in
Manhattan, on the same floor where the very famous Liz
Claiborne got her start.</p>
<p>Mr. Henderson feels lucky to have hooked up with Mr.
Sasaki: "With Ricky, I usually get everything I want."</p>
<p>But Mr. Sasaki doesn't feel he is getting enough from his
rising star. Mr. Henderson is spoiled and hard to manage, and
that makes it harder for the company to deal with the
relentless pressure it is under to turn out a collection
season after season. In the beginning, Mr. Sasaki may have
given Mr. Henderson too free a hand. Still, Mr. Sasaki has no
regrets.</p>
<p>Despite World Hong Kong's know-how, for example, early
shipments of Mr. Henderson's wares were late. Also, Mr.
Sasaki was indulging Mr. Henderson's ideas about how clothes
should fit. The result was that his oversized sweaters looked
dreadful on everyone except the very tall and very thin.
Stores such as New York's Charivari and the Saks Fifth Avenue
chain sent back some clothes.</p>
<p>"That first year was very expensive," recalls Dexter Levy,
Mr. Sasaki's financial watchdog, "but we knew we'd have to
give it a little time." Michael Winter, the former president
of the Gordon Henderson division of World Hong Kong, left
after a year because, he says, "Gordon got so he wouldn't
listen to anybody."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the runway, Mr. Henderson's collections were
getting rave reviews. (Women's Wear Daily: "another terrific
collection." The New York Times: "intelligent affordable
sportswear." Time: "boldness and brights to burn.") So Mr.
Sasaki yielded to many of his star's demands.</p>
<p>But Mr. Henderson spent $500,000 -- twice what Mr. Sasaki
authorized -- to redecorate the company's showroom
headquarters, where store buyers visit to preview the
collections. Mr. Henderson designed everything, down to the
coiled doorknobs. He also ordered weathered New Jersey
barnwood for the floors, which turned out to be unsteady and
to generate dust, which gets the duds dirty.</p>
<p>Mr. Henderson says mishaps, particularly cost overruns,
are byproducts of sudden celebrity and the exigencies of
working for a big company. "At Parsons, they don't teach you
this," he says. "I never had to design with a price structure
in mind. We learned about developing creativity skills."</p>
<p>Today, under Peter Clements, the current president, Mr.
Henderson is doing a better job of meeting deadlines and
hewing to a budget. But Mr. Henderson still complains that
Mr. Sasaki tries to cut back on the wrong things. For
example, Mr. Sasaki didn't want to maintain a workroom to
make sample garments in New York when they could be made more
cheaply in Hong Kong. Only after witnessing the delays caused
by sending sample garments back and forth did Mr. Sasaki
relent.</p>
<p>"With them, it's always money vs. creativity," Mr.
Henderson says of Mr. Sasaki and his financial sidekick, Mr.
Levy. "They always want to set a formula. . . . They want
things to work on a timetable, for me to pick the colors
first or the fabric before I know what I'm going to design.
It's hard for a creative person to work that way."</p>
<p>It's a full-time job keeping Mr. Henderson in check, a
responsibility Mr. Sasaki shares with Mr. Clements. Splitting
his time between Hong Kong and Tokyo, Mr. Sasaki drops into
the New York office about four times a year, otherwise
communicating with Mr. Henderson through faxed messages and
phone calls. When in town, Mr. Sasaki and his wife don't see
Mr. Henderson socially.</p>
<p>Mr. Sasaki learned the backer business from his first
employer and mentor, Japanese millionaire Tomio Taki. Mr.
Taki, one of the first businessmen to see that there was
money to be made in backing a Seventh Avenue designer, bought
the Anne Klein fashion house in 1973. He then spun off one of
Anne Klein's designers, Donna Karan, whose label became one
of the industry's biggest hits, with current annual sales of
$145 million.</p>
<p>While Mr. Sasaki grumbles that Mr. Henderson is in a hurry
to become famous, Mr. Sasaki is just as eager for that to
happen. Aware that this season's star can sputter out, Mr.
Sasaki wants to exploit Mr. Henderson's current popularity.</p>
<p>Mr. Sasaki is taking cues from his former boss Mr. Taki,
who fast-forwarded Ms. Karan's business, introducing a
lower-priced DKNY collection last year, which has been a
major success in the stores.</p>
<p>At Mr. Sasaki's behest, Mr. Henderson is introducing this
fall a lower-priced collection called "But, Gordon." The
collection includes casual tops, pants and jackets, as well
as skirts retailing at an average price of $79 -- bargain
basement for a "designer" collection.</p>
<p>Mr. Sasaki sees dollar signs in the new line. "I told
Gordon that we can use his prestige as a designer to allow
many people to wear the clothes," he says. Retailers, hungry
for relatively inexpensive apparel with a designer image,
agree.</p>
<p>"We see positive happenings with `But, Gordon,'" says Mara
Urshel, a senior vice president at Saks. "There's a lot to
choose from, and the prices are right." Adds Laura Hall, a
merchandise manager at I. Magnin, "`But, Gordon' is priced
perfectly, about as much as our customers want to pay for
casual clothes."</p>
<p>For Mr. Henderson, the heavy advance orders are at the
expense of his higher-priced collection, stuff that sells for
between $100 and $400. He feels the bargain line undermines
his creativity. The company's production staff, led by Ingrid
Green, dictates the number of colors and geegaws he can use.
She vetoes certain pockets, buttons or top-stitching that
might add $1 or $2 to the cost of garments. With such
constraints, "it is a challenge for me to make the collection
look exciting, fresh and modern," Mr. Henderson frets.</p>
<p>It is critically important to keep costs down. Retailers,
who can no longer afford to stock designers who don't sell,
have cut back on their collections. Even high-toned Bergdorf
Goodman takes a harder line. "There isn't a designer in the
store who doesn't have to perform," says Andrew Basile, a
Bergdorf fashion director.</p>
<p>Many retailers look favorably on Mr. Henderson not only
because his clothes focus on young working women but because
he has the backing of a strong apparel organization.
"Obviously, if a small designer is owned by a big company,
there's a better chance of merchandise being produced and
being shipped on time," says Joan Kaner, a senior vice
president of Neiman Marcus.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Seventh Avenue showroom around 11 a.m.,
after working out with his personal trainer, Mr. Henderson
rushes to a meeting with Mr. Clements, Mr. Levy and Mr.
Sasaki, who happens to be in town.</p>
<p>Brushing by his assistants, who are scurrying around in
miniskirted Gordon Henderson outfits, the designer drops by
his desk, where he keeps a note written by an exasperated Mr.
Sasaki. It says: "Gordon, I want you to calm down and
concentrate on designing."</p>
<p>After Mr. Sasaki calls the meeting to order, he zeroes in
on the October fashion show, which is Mr. Henderson's only
advertising and publicity tool. "This show," Mr. Sasaki says,
standing up, "is very important to us. I don't mind if the
press criticizes the designs, but this time I want them to
see the clothes from head to toe."</p>
<p>Last time -- the April show -- was something of a
disaster. An overflow crowd spilled onto the runway, where
the models looked uncomfortable, swaddled as they were in
layers of sweaters, jackets, scarves and vests. Mr. Henderson
says he was inspired by collegiate clothes of the 1950s. But
Women's Wear Daily, an industry power that has been ever so
kind to Mr. Henderson, hated the show and gave it a "D."</p>
<p>This was the first negative review Mr. Henderson ever got.
"I really felt hurt," he recalls. "I poured my heart into
that collection."</p>
<p>Mr. Sasaki was less devastated. In fact, he thought the
review was a blessing in that it might bring Mr. Henderson
back to Earth. But Mr. Sasaki underestimated the fallout: 36
buyers canceled appointments to see samples in the showroom.
"We can't afford to let that happen again," he says.</p>
<p>The spring Gordon Henderson line will be shown off late
next month in a bigger but austere space at the Parsons
School. Mr. Sasaki vetoes the fancier backdrop Mr. Henderson
wants. "When we start making money, we can do more with the
show," he says. "But this time, we just want them to see the
clothes."</p>
<p>The next day Mr. Sasaki and Mr. Henderson go to a long
lunch. "We talked about establishing a better rapport," Mr.
Henderson recalls afterward. "Ricky is very concerned that
everything be fine with me."</p>
<p>But tension continues to come between the creator and the
backer. His name is on the label, and Mr. Henderson sometimes
acts like he owns the company. Earlier this year, Mr. Sasaki
was annoyed to discover that Mr. Henderson had signed a
licensing contract with Vogue Patterns to market some of his
designs to home sewers -- something Mr. Henderson has no
right to do. (Mr. Sasaki, indulgent as he sometimes is, let
him go ahead with the deal anyway.)</p>
<p>"He has to learn how important teamwork is," says Mr.
Sasaki. "I'm patient, but I'm not putting my whole life into
this."</p>
