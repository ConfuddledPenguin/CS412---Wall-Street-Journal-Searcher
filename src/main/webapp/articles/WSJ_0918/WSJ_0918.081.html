	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Over-the-counter stocks eased slightly as news
of buy-outs and corporate earnings enlivened an otherwise
dull day.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index eased 0.31 to 374.11, 0.1%
loss, as volume fell to 94 million shares from 103.5 million
Friday. Declining shares kept their lead over advancing
stocks, 1,022 to 776, while 2,453 shares remained unchanged.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Buy-out news ignited Barden, which almost doubled in value
after FAG Bearings Corp. of Stamford, Conn., said it will pay
$66.25 a share for the Danbury, Conn., bearing maker. Barden
shares soared 30 1/2 to 63 on 18,700 shares, more than 11
times average volume of only 1,600 shares.</p>
<p>High-flying Nike stumbled 3 to 72. The Beaverton, Ore.,
athletic footwear maker reported earnings for the first
quarter ended Aug. 31 rose to $2.62 a share from $2.01 a year
earlier, at the high end of Wall Street's expectations.
Analysts suggested investors who bought stock last week in
anticipation of a strong report took profits yesterday.</p>
<p>However, slow growth continued to haunt other companies as
Oracle Systems, for instance, traded heavily amid concern
about its future.</p>
<p>Generally, investors remained wary of OTC stocks as they
waited for economic news and developments in the Persian
Gulf. "Overall, it's just wait-and-see," said Hedi Reynolds,
managing director of OTC trading at Morgan Keegan & Co. in
Memphis, Tenn. Institutions continued to buy stocks
selectively, while small investors remained inactive, she
said. "Retail {business} is very, very slow, which is what
we're hearing from everybody," she said.</p>
<p>Technology shares closed mixed. Microsoft rose 1 to 60 3/4
after International Business Machines Co. extended three
licensing pacts with the Redmond, Wash., software maker.
However, Oracle, the day's most active stock, slid 5/8 to 6
7/8. The company has begun a round of layoffs to cope with
slower growth.</p>
<p>Microsoft was buoyed by the news that IBM extended its
licensing pacts for the company's DOS, Windows and OS/2
software. It was the first time that IBM sealed a broad-scale
licensing arrangement for Microsoft's highly successful
Windows 3.0 software, Goldman Sachs analyst Rick Sherlund
said. But he said IBM hasn't been forthcoming about details
of the Windows arrangement, making it too soon to gauge the
financial impact.</p>
<p>After the two companies' long-running arguments over the
marketing of OS/2, the extension of that licensing agreement
is positive, Mr. Sherlund added. "It's an acknowledgement
these guys have to live together," he said.</p>
<p>Oracle skidded near its 52-week low as analysts spoke of
continuing troubles at the Redwood City, Calif., software
maker. Dean Witter Reynolds analyst Timothy R. McCollum said
he thinks three high-level executives already have left the
company, in addition to a number of lower-level employees,
according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report. Oracle's
stock has plummeted from 15 just a month ago and is trading
at one-fourth its 52-week high of 28 3/8.</p>
<p>Other technology shares were mixed.</p>
<p>Intel rose 1/4 to 32 7/8; Conner Peripherals added 1/8 to
20 3/4; and Sun Microsystems gained 1/8 to 28 1/2. However,
Apple Computer fell 1/4 to 33 3/4 and 3Com fell 1 to 6 7/8.</p>
<p>Barden's planned acquisition prompted investors to buy
other machinery stocks:</p>
<p>Applied Materials rose 3/4 to 25; and Kaydon gained 1 3/8
to 35.</p>
<p>Kaydon also got a boost from Shearson Lehman Brothers
analyst Susan Hirsch, who repeated her "buy" opinion on the
Muskegon, Mich., maker of bearings and other machinery
components.</p>
<p>Justin Industries climbed 3/4 to 14 1/4 after a dissident
shareholder group said it offered to pay $18 a share for all
outstanding shares of the Fort Worth, Texas, company. The
group has an 11.4% stake in the company.</p>
<p>Speculation of an acquisition fueled a 1 1/8-point jump in
VeloBind to 8 5/8. The Fremont, Calif., maker of book and
document binding equipment confirmed it's in buyout
discussions with an undisclosed company.</p>
<p>American Greetings gained 1/8 to 28 1/2 after the
Cleveland greeting card company reported that net income for
the second quarter ended Aug. 31 rose to 20 cents a share
from 16 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Clean Harbors slid 1 3/8 to 5 1/8 after Massachussetts
health officials opposed construction of a hazardous-waste
incinerator planned by the Quincy, Mass., company. Among
other environmental stocks, Western Waste Industries eased
1/2 to 18 3/4 and Mid-American Waste, which doesn't handle
hazardous wastes, fell 1/4 to 25 3/4.</p>
<p>Mail Boxes Etc. tumbled 1 1/4 to 21 1/4 after the
Pennsylvania attorney general sued the San Diego franchiser
of mail services for allegedly misleading the public by
marketing mailboxes that customers are allowed to identify as
"suites" or "apartments."</p>
<p>Geriatric & Medical Centers lost 1 to 1 1/4. Late Friday,
the Philadelphia concern said that Pennsylvania is seeking
Medicaid audit adjustments and business-use and occupancy-tax
assessments that could result in a total $12.1 million
charge.</p>
