	<p class="article-leader">Magazine publishers are finding that noble causes may be
the best new way to help themselves as they help others.
   On the charity ball circuit, there's a new catchword:
"cause marketing." In a difficult advertising environment,
with many traditional forms of promotion exhausted,
publishers are adopting causes ranging from AIDS to
homelessness and breast cancer as their favorite charities.
And they are turning well-publicized fund-raising events into
opportunities to grab the attention of highly valued readers
and advertisers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Conde Nast Publications Inc.'s Vanity Fair raised quick
cash for Phoenix House's drug rehab center. News Corp.'s
Mirabella is giving a portion of its advertising revenue to
four different charities. Meredith Corp.'s Metropolitan Home
will hold its second major shindig next spring to fight AIDS.
And Hearst Corp.'s Town & Country is raising money for
cosmetic makeovers for cancer patients.</p>
<p>Magazine publishers concede their motivations are mixed.
They insist their first priority is the cause, and in the
do-good environment of the 1990s, the causes often do reflect
the personal convictions and concerns of editors and
publishers. In the case of many fashion magazines, for
example, AIDS has proven a devastating scourge, taking the
lives of several well-known designers.</p>
<p>For example, a major beneficiary of such publishers is the
Design Industries Foundation for AIDS. George Slowick, the
foundation's chairman, acknowledges that magazines are using
funds they might otherwise spend on different forms of
promotion, but that's OK with him. "Let's face it, we are
taking money out of marketing budgets," says Mr. Slowick, who
is also publisher of the book publishing trade magazine
Publishers Weekly. "We have to create win-win situations.
Magazines need something in return. The best situations are
when we both come out well: Magazines get publicity, and we
get dollars."</p>
<p>No one denies that the good works could well translate
into good business down the road -- and publishers don't
hesitate to get their own advertisers involved. Mirabella
told advertisers that for every ad page in its anniversary
issue, $1,000 would go to one of four charities, including
the AIDS foundation and a literacy group. Mirabella raised
$82,000 and plans to do it again each year. "It's very
unattractive not to give back, and we want to be attractive,"
says Julie Lewit-Nirenberg, publisher of Mirabella. "There is
a promotional value, no question. But promotion should be an
extra benefit, not the prime mover."</p>
<p>In November, Vogue will join with the Council of Fashion
Designers of America to put on "Seventh on Sale," with the
aim of raising $1 million for the New York City AIDS Fund.
Vogue will underwrite all the costs of the three-day event in
New York, including a celebrity dinner in Manhattan thrown by
Vogue editor Anna Wintour. Many of the famous designers who
depend on the magazine's coverage will donate their creations
for sale.</p>
<p>Ms. Wintour says she offered help to design council
president Carolyne Roehm, the fashion designer, out of
personal concern over the ravages of AIDS in the fashion
industry. Vogue is not offering an advertiser tie-in and has
no plans to run photos of the star-studded bash. But the
magazine is strongly promoting the event -- and the cause --
to its readers. In the September issue, Vogue had a
three-page spread on "Seventh on Sale," including information
on how to buy tickets or make a tax-deductible contribution.
The magazine also plans a series of articles on the AIDS
crisis.</p>
<p>"Fund-raising is something we shouldn't be known for,"
said Ms. Wintour, who is involved in several charities. "But
the reason is the time. AIDS is not going away, and there are
so many places the money can be channeled."</p>
<p>Vanity Fair raised almost $500,000 for Phoenix House last
March with a party in Los Angeles, and later ran four color
pages on it in its June issue. The drug rehabilitation
program is a favorite cause of Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown,
who also ran a story critical of former First Lady Nancy
Reagan for pulling her support from a Phoenix House project.</p>
<p>Other publishers are finding ways to subtly pressure
advertisers to donate to both their causes and their
magazines. Town & Country notified advertisers it would
donate 55% of beauty ad revenue from a special section in the
magazine's October issue to "Look Good . . . Feel Better," a
group that helps female cancer patients.</p>
<p>The wave of magazine good will can be traced back to the
fall of 1988, when Metropolitan Home magazine threw a benefit
at Manhattan's 27th Street Armory for the design industry
AIDS foundation that netted $800,000. Advertisers got
directly involved when Met Home later produced a special
"showhouse," giving 5% of the issue's net ad revenue, or
about $100,000, to the foundation. The magazine sold
sponsorships of the showhouse to several key advertisers,
including General Electric, Kohler and Lenox China.</p>
<p>Maybe the most elaborate, though unsexy, charity promotion
involves Meredith's Better Homes & Gardens and Sara Lee
Corp.'s Hanes hosiery and underwear. Buyers of Hanes and
Hanes Her Way products can send their $15 rebate directly to
the three-year-old Better Homes Foundation, which funnels
money to homeless families in 50 communities in 26 states.
Hanes is guaranteeing a minimum of $200,000. International
Business Machines Corp. and McDonald's Corp. have also given
to the magazine's foundation.</p>
<p>"You can question people's motivation, but our impulse is
that we have a communication power," says David Jordan,
Better Homes' editor-in-chief. "It's people with families
helping people without homes. We want it to go on forever."</p>

<p>Change at Colgate</p>
<p>Clay Timon, vice president of worldwide advertising at
Colgate-Palmolive Co., has left the New York-based company
because of differences with top management over the company's
advertising strategy, according to company insiders.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Timon, 46 years old, arrived at Colgate in 1985,
he has been responsible for building the company's
relationship with its two world-wide advertising agencies,
Young & Rubicam and FCB/Leber Katz Partners. "There was a
specific job to be done, and the sense around here is that it
was done," Mr. Timon said.</p>
<p>But Mr. Timon's inclination to use image-oriented
advertising for the company's personal care and household
products clashed with the product-oriented approach favored
by William Shanahan, Colgate's senior executive vice
president and chief operating officer, company insiders said.</p>
<p>Mr. Timon's position will be eliminated, with
responsibility for the company's advertising likely to be
left to several managers around the world. The company has
also reassigned Ariel Allen, vice president of creative
services at Colgate U.S., although her new position has not
been announced. The moves were first reported yesterday in
advertising trade publications.</p>
<p>Sources close to the account also said that they believed
Mr. Timon's departure could signal an era of increased
competition between Colgate's two world-wide agencies, and
that the company may begin entertaining pitches from other
agencies for special projects.</p>
<p>A Colgate spokeman called that scenario "just plain
wrong." The spokesman added, "Advertising will be managed at
a very senior level because of the importance we place on
creative excellence and maintaining excellent partnerships
with our two global agencies."</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>AGREEMENT: American Express Co. and France's Club
Mediterranee S.A. are close to signing a marketing agreement
likely to include joint promotions designed to sell Club Med
vacations through American Express travel offices world-wide.
Analysts said the move was a logical one for Club Med, which
has been trying to expand its distribution in Asia and
attract conventions to its vacation villages during the
off-season. The promotions are also likely to offer
vacationers incentives to pay for their Club Med stay with an
Amex card. Neither company would comment on the specifics of
the agreement, which is expected to be announced within days.</p>
<p>TACO BELL: Greater Los Angeles Taco Bell Advertising
Association awarded its $10 million account to Foote, Cone &
Belding, San Francisco. The account had previously been
handled by Tracy-Locke, Los Angeles, a unit of Omnicom Group.</p>
<p>WHO'S NEWS: Bruce Lee Albert was named chief operating
officer at Lord Einstein O'Neill & Partners, New York . . .
Medicus Intercon, a New York-based unit of D'Arcy Masius
Benton & Bowles, named John Hegquist executive vice president
and creative director.</p>
