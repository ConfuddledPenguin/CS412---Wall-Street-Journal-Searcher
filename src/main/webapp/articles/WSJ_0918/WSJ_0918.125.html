rights plan to allow ownership of up to 22.5% of the
company's common stock by companies controlled by Warren E.
Buffett, chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

by Mr. Buffett that Berkshire Hathaway or its affiliates be
permitted to acquire more than 20% of PS Group stock. As of
May, three companies controlled by Mr. Buffett held about an
11% stake.</p>
