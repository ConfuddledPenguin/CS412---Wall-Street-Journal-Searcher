	<p class="article-leader">PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia -- Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier
looks down at the courtyard three floors below to the spot
where Czechoslovakia's last democratically appointed foreign
minister, Jan Masaryk, was found dead a few days after the
1948 Communist coup.
   The official explanation of Mr. Masaryk's death was
suicide. But the circumstances surrounding it have fueled
speculation ever since.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Dienstbier suddenly moves toward the ledge. "You see
how easy it would be to fall," he says. Then he laughs and
adds, "Don't worry, I won't jump."</p>
<p>Mr. Dienstbier isn't about to do anything desperate, but
his dark joke reflects how much Prague's euphoria has
evaporated since Czechoslovakia's velvet revolution toppled
the Communists last November. Like many other East European
leaders vaulted from opposition to power, Mr. Dienstbier came
to office believing that his most important task was to
consolidate freedom from the Soviet Union and democracy at
home. Now, he finds himself confronted with the practical
problems of foreign trade and a collapsing economy.</p>
<p>"Dienstbier is like many of the other philosophers running
this country," complains Karel Dyba, finance minister for the
new Czech Republic. "He doesn't seem to understand that
unless we act on the economy, nothing else we do will count."</p>
<p>In his apartment at the 17th-century Cernin Palace, which
serves as Czechoslovakia's Foreign Ministry, a weary Mr.
Dienstbier acknowledges that he underestimated the difficulty
of economic overhaul. He and his former prisonmate, President
Vaclav Havel, have now begun to warn their countrymen that
painful austerity lies ahead. Mr. Dienstbier says he has been
working until 2 a.m. dealing with crisis after crisis: the
abrupt reduction of Soviet oil deliveries, the rupture of
East German commercial contracts and now the Persian Gulf oil
shock.</p>
<p>"It was easier to make a revolution than to write 600 to
800 laws to create a market economy," he sighs.</p>
<p>For Mr. Dienstbier, Mr. Havel and other former dissidents,
toppling the old Communist regime was like a fairy tale. Mr.
Dienstbier had been fired from his position as a Czechoslovak
Radio foreign correspondent for opposing the 1968 Soviet
invasion and was forced to work as a furnace stoker in the
construction of the city subways. In 1977, he helped found
the Charter 77 human-rights group, which led to his
imprisonment.</p>
<p>When his role as a spokesman in last fall's revolution won
him appointment as foreign minister in the new government
last December, he joked that he couldn't take the post until
he found a replacement for his coal-shoveling job.</p>
<p>Since taking office, Mr. Dienstbier has launched a series
of innovative plans, including a proposed Arab-Israeli peace
settlement and a program to give Western aid to the Soviet
Union to be spent on East European goods. Above all, he has
argued for creation of a Pan-European security structure to
replace both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
Warsaw Pact. The calls to dissolve NATO created a storm of
criticism in some Western capitals, particularly Washington.
"The Americans are furious with Dienstbier," a Western
diplomat says.</p>
<p>While Mr. Dienstbier's grand ideas for reshaping Europe
have turned Czechoslovakia into a lively, if controversial,
diplomatic player, the more mundane and intractable problems
of foreign trade frustrate the foreign minister. He has
embraced German political unity, saying a democratic Germany
represents no danger for Europe. But he worries about German
economic unity; East German companies have refused since
monetary union to take nonconvertible Czech crowns as payment
and have stopped commercial deliveries.</p>
<p>Mr. Dienstbier says West Germany must pay reparations for
the Czech losses. "Many of our companies will go bankrupt
unless the East Germans keep their contracts," he says.</p>
<p>Dealing with Moscow is even more complicated. President
Havel and Mr. Dienstbier have negotiated the withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Czechoslovakia, and Mr. Dienstbier says he
has no fundamental differences with Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev. But he expresses alarm about the Soviet decision
this summer to reduce oil deliveries 30%. And he says the
lack of strong authority in Moscow makes it difficult to
cement agreements.</p>
<p>"You just don't know who is responsible there," he
complains. "If you make an agreement with the central
government about oil or anything else, you don't know if the
Russian Republic will cancel it the next day."</p>
<p>Similar difficulties exist in relations with other
neighbors. While a dissident, he forged close links with the
leaders of Poland's Solidarity that he hoped would create an
alliance between the two neighboring Slavic states. They
haven't.</p>
<p>Against his earlier wishes, Mr. Dienstbier ended up
keeping tight border controls between Czechoslovakia and
Poland after the Ministry of Foreign Trade persuaded him such
controls were necessary to prevent a run on inexpensive Czech
goods. "It's terrible," he says. "The borders go down in the
West and up in the East."</p>
<p>Another nagging problem concerns his own ministry's heavy
bureaucracy, inherited from the Communists and filled with
scores of incompetent careerists. Since taking office, Mr.
Dienstbier has shaken up Czechoslovakia's diplomatic
establishment by naming some old dissident friends to
ambassadorships. He also has dismissed some secret-police
spies.</p>
<p>But critics say he hasn't done enough to get rid of the
incompetents or those who oppose democracy. "Dienstbier is
just too nice, he just can't bear to fire people," says one
close associate in private. "For every new diplomat like me,
there are three from the old regime."</p>
<p>Sitting in his small apartment in the palace, Mr.
Dienstbier doesn't hide the difficulties. "There are times
when I feel like a prisoner of this chateau," he says. "You
can't change everything overnight."</p>
<p>He points to his bedroom where three open suitcases
overflow with dirty clothes. "Sometimes I wish I still was a
stoker," he says. "At least then I got some sleep."</p>
