	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK (AP) -- Pandick Inc., a printer of prospectuses,
proxy materials and other financial documents, filed for
bankruptcy-court reorganization, becoming another casualty of
a business slowdown on Wall Street.
   James Alexis, president, attributed the Chapter 11 filing
to the "steady deterioration" of the financial markets since
the October 1987 stock-market crash.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, a company
is protected from creditors while it continues to operate and
tries to reorganize.</p>
<p>Mr. Alexis said in a statement that Pandick's business has
dropped more than 50% over the past two years. During that
time, the mergers and acquisition business has slowed
markedly and Wall Street firms have cut back sharply.</p>
<p>The turmoil in the financial markets since Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait further curtailed the company's business
and worsened its problems, Mr. Alexis said.</p>
