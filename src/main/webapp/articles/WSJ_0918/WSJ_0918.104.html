	<p class="article-leader">CSX Corp. said the Virginia Retirement System proposed an
exchange of a portion of CSX's RF&P Corp. dividend
obligations for the stock of an RF&P subsidiary that holds
the RF&P railroad. The Virginia Retirement System also
proposed that it purchase CSX's remaining RF&P dividend
obligations and its RF&P voting shares at $35 a share. In
yesterday's edition, terms of the transaction were misstated.

<p>PRIME MOTOR INNS Inc. said bank lenders were considering
extending the maturity date of existing loans and allowing
the company to retain a part of proceeds from asset sales.
Yesterday's edition incorrectly said lenders had agreed to
the extension and to the sharing of proceeds.</p>
