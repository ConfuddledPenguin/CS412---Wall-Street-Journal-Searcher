	<p class="article-leader">Real Estate Investment Trust Co. of California said it
will become self-managed after the retirement of its
president, William Walters Jr., at the end of the month.
   Mr. Walters, 65 years old, will remain a trustee. He also
owns William Walters Co., a real-estate concern that has
acted as the trust's management adviser.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>John F. Carpenter, 43, will succeed Mr. Walters as
president of the trust. He was formerly senior vice president
of Grubb & Ellis Co., a San Francisco-based commercial
real-estate services concern.</p>
<p>"No material change is anticipated in the current
operating focus," said the trust, based in Los Angeles, which
owns and operates California shopping centers, apartment
complexes, industrial buildings and commercial projects. Most
of the adviser's 12 employees will become direct employees of
the trust and the others will help Mr. Walters manage his
personal investments.</p>
<p>Investors increasingly prefer self-managed trusts because
of concerns about potential self-dealing between an outside
manager and its clients, said LeRoy E. Carlson, William
Walters Co. vice president and chief financial officer. After
Oct. 1, he will hold the same titles with the trust. "This is
being done now partly because of Mr. Walter's retirement,"
Mr. Carlson said.</p>
