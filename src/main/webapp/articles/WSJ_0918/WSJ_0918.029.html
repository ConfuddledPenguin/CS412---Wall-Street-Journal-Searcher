	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices retreated broadly in thin dealings
Monday with many investors on the sidelines because of a fall
in bond prices and continuing uncertainty about the Mideast
situation, traders said.
   In London, stocks closed mixed after erasing early losses
on the back of a good start on Wall Street and a late buying
spurt in London.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei index of 225 issues was down 531.86 points,
or 2.14%, at 24365.60.</p>
<p>At the end of the morning session Tuesday in Tokyo, the
Nikkei index fell 932.53 to 23433.07.</p>
<p>First-section volume Monday was estimated at 300 million
shares, down from 546 million shares on Friday. Decliners
outnumbered gainers 822 to 144, and 125 issues were
unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section fell 35.49 points, or 1.87%, to 1860.19.</p>
<p>The second section index was down 42.67 points, or 1.19%,
to 3544.15. Volume in the section was estimated at five
million shares, down from 6.6 million shares Friday.</p>
<p>"Investors' buying interest was completely cooled off,"
said Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock trading at
Okasan Securities.</p>
<p>As bond prices fell through the morning session and failed
to recover during the rest of the day, buying interest in the
stock market dried up, Mr. Ito said. He said investors fear
stock prices may drop below the year's previous closing low
of 23737.63 posted Aug. 23.</p>
<p>"There is no perception among participants that {domestic}
interest rates have peaked out. That means there is no
perception that stock prices have bottomed out," Mr. Ito
said.</p>
<p>Such fears were reflected by the sharp falls of stock
index futures Monday as institutions sold futures for short
hedging, traders said.</p>
<p>The index of the December futures contracts "remained
below the cash index. That shows there are strong
expectations that stock prices will decline," said Shigeru
Akiba, head of equity at UBS Phillips & Drew International.</p>
<p>Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of stock trading at Nikko
Securities, said stock prices were pressured down mainly
because of a small amount of selling by special money
accounts that will close their books Thursday for midyear
accounting. Because it takes four trading days to process
transactions, Monday was the last trading day for these
accounts, the official said, predicting less volatile trading
for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Mr. Akiba also sees the stock market in a lull this week,
with the Nikkei index hovering from 24000 to 25000 points.</p>
<p>Mr. Akiba said what he fears most is dumping by individual
investors or a heavy sell-off by investment trust funds as
the result of orders by investors to close their trust fund
accounts. But judging from Monday's trading, "neither may
happen after all," he said.</p>
<p>Strong advances for stocks aren't expected, however.</p>
<p>Mr. Ito of Okasan Securities noted that the majority of
institutional investors probably will take every opportunity
to sell whenever stock prices rise to profitable levels.
Expectations of such strong selling pressure discourages
individual investors from buying, he said.</p>
<p>Many sectors were sold Monday, including large-capital
shares such as those of steel makers, shipbuilding companies
and electric-power companies, as well as such small-capital
shares as high-priced, high-technology concerns.</p>
<p>Higher interest rates prompted further selling of interest
rate sensitive large-capital shares. NKK was down 20 yen to
455 yen (15 cents to $3.32), while Tokyo Electric Power fell
120 yen to 3180 yen.</p>
<p>Among high-tech shares, Kyocera fell 150 yen to 6850 yen,
Sony declined 140 yen to 6860 yen, and TDK was down 200 yen
at 5400 yen.</p>
<p>Construction companies and car makers also ended lower,
with Kajima dropping 20 yen to 1360 yen and Toyota Motor down
10 yen to 1900 yen.</p>
<p>In London, traders said that U.K. company interim results
and economic figures all due this week are contributing
factors to a nervous market in which volume levels remain at
record lows.</p>
<p>"Money does want to come into the market but investors are
just bidding at lower levels," one trader said. At the
current low prices, traders spotted only selective buying
across the board, although it wasn't sufficient to raise
volumes to even moderate levels.</p>
<p>A good start on Wall Street late in London trading session
generated buying activity there. "With such a nervous market
anything can move it," one trader said.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index edged
up 0.5 point to 2094.3. The Financial Times 30-Share Index
closed down 3.5 points at 1606.1. Volume was 286.6 million
shares, well below Friday's 418 million shares.</p>
<p>Among several companies reporting interim results, auction
house Christie's International posted a 17% rise in pretax
profit, but warned that the prospects for the second half
were unlikely to be as favorable. The shares ended a penny
lower at 257 pence ($4.87).</p>
<p>Hawker Siddeley, which recorded a 44% drop in pretax
profit on the back of a poor long-term outlook, had a 44
pence slide to 429 pence.</p>
<p>Industrial services and marketing group Inchcape lost 8
pence to 221 pence after posting a rise in pretax profit of
5.2% for the period.</p>
<p>Dalgety, a food and agribusiness concern, was unchanged at
356 pence after reporting a 7% rise in pretax profit.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, international employment services concern
Manpower, which reported only a marginal improvement in
pretax profit for the half year, closed down 1/2 penny at 58
pence.</p>
<p>Retailing concern Storehouse, which sold two major units,
ended 2 pence higher at 130 pence.</p>
<p>Shares closed lower in Paris, Frankfurt, Zurich, Brussels,
Amsterdam, Stockholm, Milan and Madrid. South African gold
stocks closed marginally higher.</p>
<p>Stocks closed lower in Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, Seoul
and Manila, and higher in Taipei and Wellington.</p>
