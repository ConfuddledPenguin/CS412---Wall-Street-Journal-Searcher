	<p class="article-leader">General Motors Corp.'s Automotive Components Group said it
plans to spend over $1 billion over the next five years on
expanding its industrial capacity and on research and
development in Europe.
   The manufacturing investment will involve the construction
of several new production facilities in Europe, ACG Europe
President Mark McCabe told a news conference. The funds will
also be used to modernize the division's 49 existing plants
in Europe, he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. McCabe said he expects the European market for car
parts to grow to $100 billion by the year 2000 from around
$60 billion at present.</p>
<p>He said the forecast is based on the assumption that
new-car sales in Western Europe will rise to 14.2 million
units by 1995 from 13.5 million at present. Demand from
Eastern Europe could add another 3.5 million cars to the 1995
figure, he noted.</p>
