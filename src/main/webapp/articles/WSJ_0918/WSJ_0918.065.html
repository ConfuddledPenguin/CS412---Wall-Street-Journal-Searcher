	<p class="article-leader">Kudos to Mary Cunningham Agee and her Nurturing Network
("Business World" by Tim W. Ferguson, Sept. 4). It's
inspiring to know that, amid all the negative rhetoric
surrounding the abortion issue, there are those who are
attacking the tragedy of abortion in a positive way.
   Her work also helps dramatize the fact that many abortions
might be included in the unfortunate "convenience" category,
not the poverty or teen-mother category.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also deserving of praise are those companies throwing
support behind such endeavors. Our society is on an
irreversible course that has more and more women in the work
force. The challenge is to seek ways to resolve the conflict
between career and family.</p>
<p>Maybe when women come to learn more about what Mrs. Agee
calls the "ultimate violence" that victimizes them, those
companies that have made the effort to accommodate the family
needs of their women employees will reap their rewards on the
bottom line.</p>
