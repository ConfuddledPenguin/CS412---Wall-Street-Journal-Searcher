	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Citicorp has identified some $200 million of
possible cost cuts in its global finance operation, with at
least another $50 million likely beyond that, someone close
to the business said.
   The potential expense cuts are part of Citicorp's plan to
streamline the operation, which provides commercial and
investment banking services in the U.S., Canada, Europe,
Japan, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bank holding company hasn't mandated any specific
number of people to be cut or amounts to be saved by the 53
managers who run the businesses within Global Finance, the
person close to the business said.</p>
<p>When the plan to cut expenses was disclosed, talk among
the staff in the operation was that 1,000 jobs would be lost.
The bank has no target, the source said, but a recent
published report that some 3,000, or 20%, of the staffers in
the operations would likely be pared is "excessive."</p>
<p>The $200 million of identified cuts, which will take at
least 12 months to execute, might come through restructurings
and divestitures of businesses, the person added.</p>
<p>In July, Michael A. Callen, Citicorp's head of global
finance for developed countries, said that costs and revenue
in the operation had become imbalanced. But he said that
"there won't be any slashing and burning like we've seen
elsewhere" in the company. At the time, Citicorp said it
eliminated two layers of managers in global finance.</p>
<p>A number of major banks have announced significant staff
cuts this year.</p>
