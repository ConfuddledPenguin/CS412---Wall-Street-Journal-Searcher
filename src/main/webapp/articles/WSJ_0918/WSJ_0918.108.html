	<p class="article-leader">ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- The former chief executive officer of a
Los Angeles defense contractor pleaded guilty to bribing Navy
officials for their assistance in obtaining military
contracts, federal prosecutors said.
   Manuel Caldera, former chairman, chief executive and
principal stockholder of Amex Systems Inc., waived indictment
and pleaded guilty in federal court here to paying thousands
of dollars to two Navy engineers for their help in obtaining
and maintaining contracts to build transit receivers for Navy
ships, according to U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson. The guilty
plea arose out of the government's continuing investigation
of defense procurement fraud, known as Operation Illwind.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Caldera made the illegal payments in connection with
six Navy contracts awarded to his company between 1978 and
1984, according to his plea agreement. The contracts had a
value of roughly $40 million, with potential follow-on value
of an additional $100 million between 1984 and 1988, Mr.
Hudson said in a statement. Mr. Caldera sold Amex Systems to
Allied-Signal Inc. of Morristown, N.J., in November 1984 for
$45 million, the prosecutor said.</p>
<p>Mr. Caldera, 59 years old, couldn't be reached for
comment. He faces a maximum sentence of seven years in
prison.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Allied-Signal said the company sold Amex
Systems to Science Applications International of San Diego in
1988.</p>
<p>A senior official at Science Applications said Amex
Systems was merged into its operations shortly after the
purchase. The official said Mr. Caldera "was not part of the
operation when we acquired it."</p>
