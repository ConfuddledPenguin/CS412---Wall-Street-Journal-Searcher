	<p class="article-leader">Charles H. Keating Jr., the man the federal government has
said is responsible for the biggest thrift collapse ever, is
scheduled to be arraigned today on criminal fraud charges in
state court in Los Angeles.
   A California state grand jury last week voted to indict
Mr. Keating, according to individuals who are familiar with
the government's investigation of Mr. Keating. The
indictment, which was sealed, marks the first time that
criminal charges have been filed against Mr. Keating, the
former chairman of American Continental Corp.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Keating resigned from his post at American Continental
late last month, after a federal judge dismissed Mr.
Keating's challenge to the government takeover of Lincoln
Savings & Loan Association, American Continental's main
operating unit. The government seized Lincoln in April 1989,
shortly after American Continental filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>The charges filed against Mr. Keating are said to include
allegations that he defrauded 23,000 investors through the
sale of $200 million in unsecured debentures. The debentures
were mostly sold through Lincoln branch offices in Los
Angeles and Orange counties. Many purchasers of the bonds
were retired investors, some of whom claim that Lincoln
branch officers falsely told them the debentures were
federally guaranteed and were as safe as insured certificates
of deposit.</p>
<p>The indictment also is understood to include charges that
Mr. Keating violated California state banking laws. American
Continental is based in Phoenix, Ariz. Lincoln is based in
the Orange County, Calif., city of Irvine.</p>
<p>Los Angeles County District Attorney Ira Reiner was named
last December to head a special statewide "prosecutors' task
force" looking into the collapse of Lincoln Savings. In
February, Mr. Reiner asked for a special grand jury to be
empanelled in Los Angeles County to assist in investigating
the Lincoln case.</p>
<p>Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for Mr. Reiner, yesterday
declined to say whether Mr. Keating had been indicted or was
about to be arraigned. She did read a statement, however,
saying that "the district attorney's office has concluded its
presentation of evidence to the grand jury." She added that
Mr. Reiner wouldn't "comment until such time a court lifts
the seal of confidentiality."</p>
<p>Stephen C. Neal, a Chicago attorney who is representing
Mr. Keating, declined to comment on the indictment.</p>
<p>Mr. Keating, who claims he is broke, already faces a
multitude of civil suits. The federal Resolution Trust Corp.,
responsible for the thrift bailout, has filed a $1.1 billion
civil racketeering suit against Mr. Keating. And the federal
Office of Thrift Supervision has filed administrative charges
against Mr. Keating and others, seeking $40.9 million.</p>
<p>The state of California also filed civil charges of
investment fraud against Mr. Keating earlier this year
seeking restitution for bondholders. The state has come in
for criticism, too, however. Bondholders at one point filed a
claim saying that the state Department of Corporations "knew
or should have known. . . . that the subordinated debentures
constituted an extreme risk to the investing public."</p>
<p>Mr. Keating's position has been that the bondholders
wouldn't have lost anything if the government hadn't seized
Lincoln and forced American Continental into bankruptcy
court. The outspoken Mr. Keating also has claimed that the
government has conducted what amounts to a vendetta against
him because of his criticism of the thrift regulatory system
after American Continental bought Lincoln in 1984.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a federal grand jury in Los Angeles is
continuing its investigation of Mr. Keating and others,
according to individuals with knowledge of that
investigation. These individuals say that federal prosecutors
may soon bring additional charges against Mr. Keating that
are similar to those being brought by the state of
California. Defense lawyers say that it is likely that Mr.
Keating will be tried first on federal charges.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors may be waiting for the sentencing of
Michael R. Milken, the former junk bond chief of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., scheduled for next week. Mr. Keating
was once a top Drexel client and a close associate of Mr.
Milken's. Mr. Milken has agreed to cooperate with the
government after he is sentenced.</p>
