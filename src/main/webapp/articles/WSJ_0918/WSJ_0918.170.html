	<p class="article-leader">Augusta, Kan. -- Two anglers, one a boy and the other an
adult, stood side-by-side beneath the towering willows that
encased the small Kansas lake. Both stared in front of them,
just beyond where their reflections reached out onto the
placid waters, at a small piece of painted balsa floating on
the surface. Suddenly the float bobbed twice and then
steadily disappeared from sight.
   The boy snapped his fishing pole gently and held on as the
hand-sized bluegill cut circular patterns as it splashed on
the surface. When the fight was over the fish was hauled to
hand; the hook's bait was checked and then carefully placed
in the same spot.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Within seconds the float was gone and the fight was on
again. So it went time after time after time. Most of the
fish were bluegill but the occasional larger channel catfish
kept the pair on their toes. Ten-year-old Matt Murphy smiled
at his success and thanked his mentor. It was an all-American
scene -- but with some obviously European twists.</p>
<p>Even from across the lake you could see that their rod was
not a conventional spinning or baitcast model. In fact, there
was no reel, only a 19-foot graphite pole that's wrist-thick
at the base and gradually narrows to its toothpick-like tip.</p>
<p>The float was a specially engineered piece of art that
rested on a spider-web-like line. The tiny pea-sized hook was
baited with a European favorite -- maggots.</p>
<p>And if you listened carefully, your ears would pick up
another sign of the scene's transatlantic background. Mick
Thill, the man who offered Matt the advice, has a voice that
betrays his years in England. Though he's spent much of his
life in the Midwest, it's an accent that thickens as his
enthusiasm grows. A man of many missions, Thill often sounds
as if he's still on the banks of the Thames.</p>
<p>One of his goals is to convince the American angling
public of the effectiveness of European tactics and
equipment. According to Thill, what works over there will
work even better in the U.S.</p>
<p>"The fish in Europe are so spooky now," said Thill. "First
of all, they've had catch-and-release over there for 100
years so the fish are pretty wise. It's also such a huge
sport. Not only are there a lot of {recreational} fishermen,
it's also a big competitive sport. It's like softball over
here in that you'll have small teams taking on others all the
way up to city championships. In England kids grow up
daydreaming of someday fishing for their city in the national
championships." It's a dream that Thill has realized many
times over, including a world championship in 1983.</p>
<p>Such competition has refined the tackle to its scientific
best. "The whole system is designed around total balance and
finesse," said Thill. "Quite often I'll be using a
pound-and-a-half test line and a tiny, tiny hook."</p>
<p>In addition to the long, reel-less pole, Thill likes to
demonstrate the advantages of the long spinning rods -- up to
12-feet long or more -- that Europeans often fit with a large
spinning reel. "There's basically no fishing from a boat,"
said Thill, "so if the fish are 40 or 50 yards out you have
to be able to cast out to them."</p>
<p>Thill, who lived in Chicago until he was 12 and now lives
in Urbana, Ill., where he manufactures many of the products
he promotes, also is quick to point out the advantages of the
sleek floats that he uses. "They're simply much more
sensitive than the big plastic floats you find in the
states," said Thill. "With a good float the fish won't feel
any resistance and the angler can even tell if the fish has
grabbed the bait and is swimming upward."</p>
<p>And then there is the bait. Though humans hate them, Thill
can prove that fish simply love maggots. "They're a great
bait," said Thill. "They're small yet attract big as well as
small fish; they're tough, active and are really
inexpensive."</p>
<p>After watching Thill throw handfuls of maggots into the
water you realize why he emphasizes the low cost. Baiting the
water, often calling chumming, is legal in most states and
according to Thill is an ideal way to attract and "turn on"
fish.</p>
<p>During a morning's fishing at the lake that sits in Matt's
backyard, Thill demonstrated a variety of European tricks,
including using a specially made slingshot to send a wad of
maggots to where a float and hook were being cast 100 feet
from shore. He also showed spectators how to use a lead
"plumb" to test the depth of the water as well as how to
locate important fish-holding structures.</p>
<p>Though he's converted a lot of adults to his style of
angling, Thill admits to setting his sights much younger.
"This is the perfect way for children to learn how to fish,"
said Thill. "It's quite easy and very, very productive, and
that's what's important to kids -- catching fish. All too
often a child will go fishing, not catch much of anything,
then get bored and move on to something else. I can take that
same kid, show him or her how to catch dozens of fish an hour
and they're hooked for life." True to his words, Thill had
Matt and his younger brother, Marshall, pulling in fish after
fish.</p>
<p>The ever-enthusiastic Thill also would like to see youth
fishing raised to more than just a recreational sport. In
addition to being the founder of the American Fishing
Association, Thill is the coach of the American Junior
Fishing Team. Though constantly battling for funding, Thill
has had some impressive successes in the world championships.
Someday he hopes to bring the gold back to the country of his
birth.</p>
<p>"If we had the money I think I could take an American kid
and make a world champion out of him," said Thill. "The kids
in America have such an opportunity to practice. A lot of
kids in Europe would simply die to have the fishing that
someone like Matt has right here."</p>
