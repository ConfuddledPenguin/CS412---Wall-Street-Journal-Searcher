	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A National Academy of Sciences panel
criticized the government's plan for modernizing beef cattle
inspection as being "probably no better," and in some
instances worse, than current procedures at U.S.
slaughterhouses.
   The committee said the Agriculture Department should
proceed with its so-called streamlined inspection system, or
SIS, but only after revamping it. At the same time, the
committee emphasized that much more fundamental changes in
meat inspection are needed to protect consumers from such
health hazards as salmonella, campylobacter and other
bacteria as well as chemical residues.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a bluntly worded critique, issued yesterday, the panel
said that the SIS plan isn't "designed to detect and
eliminate microbial or chemical hazards." The department's
Food Safety and Inspection Service was urged, among other
things, to develop speedy methods for testing beef before it
is shipped and to establish mandatory finished-product
standards.</p>
<p>Streamlined inspection, proposed for the beef industry's
80 largest packing plants, would be the first major change in
bovine meat inspection since the government began inspecting
cattle in 1906. Under the plan, plant quality-control
employees would take greater responsibility for visible
contamination, such as hair and mud, freeing federal
inspectors to focus more on food safety, rather than quality.</p>
<p>The plan would allow meatpackers to operate production
lines faster, boosting productivity as much as 40%. But
consumer advocates denounce streamlined inspection as
"deregulation in disguise" and a threat to public health,
while union officials see it as a move to drastically cut the
force of inspectors.</p>
<p>The committee, headed by Robert Kahrs, dean of the
University of Missouri's College of Veterinary Medicine, also
expressed misgivings about the SIS plan, which is being
tested at several pilot plants.</p>
<p>"From a food safety viewpoint," the panel said,
"SIS-Cattle alone is probably no better and, in some
situations, can be less effective than traditional inspection
because the reduced oversight by government inspectors isn't
compensated by a total commitment to product quality on the
part of the industry."</p>
<p>The panel cautioned that streamlined inspection should be
inaugurated only at plants where managers and employees have
demonstrated a commitment to effective quality control. In
recent months, several federal inspectors at SIS test plants
have reported serious lapses in food safety.</p>
<p>"The academy's report is a gratifying vindication of what
50 whistle-blowers stated in sworn affidavits: In its present
form, SIS weakens the USDA seal of approval," said Thomas
Devine, attorney for the Government Accountability Project, a
Washington-based defense group for meat inspectors and other
whistle-blowers.</p>
<p>The committee also faulted the Agriculture Department for
failing to heed key recommendations from two other academy
panels, which studied meat inspection and other food safety
issues in 1985 and 1987. For one thing, the department hasn't
yet developed a method for tracing contamination in beef
products back to specific feedlots or farms shipping tainted
livestock, the panel said. For another, the department hasn't
yet done any risk assessment.</p>
<p>"There is no evidence that SIS-Cattle confers greater
benefit to the public health than traditional inspection,"
the panel asserted.</p>
