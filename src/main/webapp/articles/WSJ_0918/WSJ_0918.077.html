	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration fired the Air Force
chief of staff for talking openly about plans for big bombing
raids on Iraq's capital that would specifically aim at
killing Saddam Hussein if war erupts in the Persian Gulf.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced the firing of Gen.
Michael Dugan, chiding him for using "poor judgment" and
disclosing classified information in remarks he made to a few
reporters who traveled with him on a visit to Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Cheney curtly said that the general won't get another job
but "will be retired."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gen. Dugan's comments, published in the Washington Post
and the Los Angeles Times on Sunday, have produced the
biggest embarrassment to the administration since the start
of the Gulf crisis on Aug. 2. While his blunt remarks could
help convince Saddam Hussein of American resolve, they also
raise questions about whether the administration intends to
abide by an American prohibition on assassination of foreign
leaders. And Gen. Dugan's disclosure that some American B-52
bombers are being equipped with Israeli-built missiles could
cause political problems in the Arab world.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, President Bush gave a mixed review of the
effectiveness of international economic sanctions on Iraq,
which are the cornerstone of his strategy for forcing Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait. Mr. Bush said that the sanctions are
working "to some degree." In remarks at the White House to
out-of-town reporters, the president added: "I can't tell you
definitively how effective they are at this minute."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush said the sanctions are choking off virtually all
Iraqi oil income, but he also said that ensuring that no
goods enter Iraq is "hard to do in terms of overflights and
some countries that seem to be more willing than others to
avoid the sanctions." However, he said he believes that Iran
is complying with the trade embargo.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush's remarks are significant because his analysis of
the effectiveness of economic sanctions will be an important
factor when he determines whether to move from economic
pressure to military force in order to push Iraq out of
Kuwait.</p>
<p>But the president also may have been speaking in an effort
to influence deliberations by the permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council, where new steps to tighten
the sanctions are being considered. According to a U.S.
official, three options are being discussed: extending the
embargo to include air shipments to Iraq; applying sanctions
against nations that are violating the United Nations-imposed
embargo of Iraq, and approving a resolution calling on U.N.
members to reduce Baghdad's diplomatic presence in their
nations.</p>
<p>"There's no set mix of these items," the official said.
"It could be one or all." President Bush explicitly endorsed
the idea of an embargo on some Iraqi air traffic, saying that
French President Francois Mitterrand has advanced such a
proposal and that "I would be prepared to work with anybody
to tie that additional knot in the sanctions."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush also said he "absolutely" regrets his
administration's moves to prevent Congress from passing
legislation to impose economic sanctions on Iraq in the weeks
before it invaded Kuwait. He said there was "some reason" to
think at the time that improving relations with Iraq would
moderate its behavior, but added that "if everybody had the
benefit of total hindsight, why, you'd go back and say, `This
doesn't make much sense.'"</p>
<p>Also yesterday, the State Department said that after the
weekend arrival of two chartered aircraft carrying 409
Americans and their non-American family members, there now
are about 1,280 American citizens in Kuwait and 170 in Iraq.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that
another flight carrying American citizens and their families
from Kuwait and Iraq is scheduled to leave Kuwait tomorrow
and arrive at the Raleigh-Durham, N.C., airport on Thursday.
He added that "we're looking into another possible flight
after this."</p>
<p>Mr. Boucher also said the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad reported
this past weekend that two American men and two other
Westerners were picked up Friday in Kuwait by Iraqi troops.
He said this brings to about 82 the number of American
citizens who have been rounded up by the Iraqi government.</p>
<p>The firing of Gen. Dugan illustrates the fine line the
Bush administration is walking in trying to show Iraq that it
is seriously considering military conflict without giving
away too many military plans in the process.</p>
<p>"As a matter of policy, we never talk about the selection
of specific targets for potential air strikes," Mr. Cheney
said at a news conference in which he explained Gen. Dugan's
firing. In addition, Mr. Cheney said, "we never talk about
targeting specific individuals who are officials of other
governments." Trying to kill foreign officials during an
attack could be considered attempted assassination, which
would violate an executive order President Bush and his
predecessors have issued barring political killings.</p>
<p>In his comments to reporters, Gen. Dugan said that U.S.
military planners have concluded that massive bombing,
including attacks of Baghdad, would be the most effective
option for forcing Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait if fighting
erupts. Moreover, the general said that in addition to usual
targets such as Iraqi air defenses and military industries,
he had asked planners to find targets important to Iraqi
culture and society.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheney didn't attack the veracity of Gen. Dugan's
remarks, but objected to Gen. Dugan's making the threats so
baldly in for-the-record interviews. "Given the extreme
delicacy of the current situation, it's incumbent upon senior
officials to be discreet in their public statements," Mr.
Cheney said.</p>
<p>Though Gen. Dugan's statements were similar to those made
privately by some other officials, they went beyond what
officials have said even on a not-for-attribution basis.</p>
<p>Gen. Dugan's remarks could both help and harm U.S.
interests in different ways. To get Saddam Hussein to
withdraw from Kuwait, military strategists say, the U.S. must
convince the Iraqi leader that it is ready to destroy what he
values most. But by suggesting an American willingness to
consider widespread destruction of Iraq's most important
city, the comments also seem to undercut Mr. Bush's argument
in recent weeks that he doesn't want to harm the Iraqi people
but only their unelected leader.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheney said he would replace Gen. Dugan, who had only
taken over as chief of staff three months ago, with Gen.
Merrill McPeak, who is currently commander-in-chief of
Pacific air forces.</p>
<p>In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Bush also reiterated his
administration's belief that there isn't any reason to draw
down oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because of the
cutoff of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil shipments.</p>
<p>"I think that when you have a real shortage of a product
or you see an external event that is going to guarantee that
there be a shortage, then would be the time when you most
certainly should use" the strategic reserve, Mr. Bush said.
"It is my judgment that there isn't such a shortage at this
time." He said that price increases in petroleum products
result from speculation that wouldn't be damped by a symbolic
draw-down of some reserve oil.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush also said that the current crisis won't prompt
him to reconsider decisions he made this year postponing
offshore oil exploration in large areas near the West Coast
and tracts off the East Coast. But he made a renewed pitch
for tax incentives to encourage domestic oil exploration
elsewhere, particularly in small wells that are economically
marginal.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush again praised cooperation from other nations in
the confrontation with Iraq, and there were further signs of
cooperation in both the Middle East and Europe. The Saudi
Arabian government appears ready to provide Egypt and Syria
economic assistance totaling nearly $3 billion a year in
return for their military support against Iraq, Saudi
officials said.</p>
<p>Details of the long-term arrangement haven't been
announced, but the officials said the aid would be in
addition to more than $10 billion the Saudis previously
agreed to provide to help defray the costs of deploying U.S.
forces in the region. Saudi Arabia also is prepared to pay
the full cost of airlifting another 10,000 or so Syrian
forces, which are expected to join about 3,000 Syrians
previously sent to help Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>At the same time, European Community foreign ministers
announced a mass expulsion of Iraqi military personnel and
set limits on the movements of Iraqi diplomats who remain. In
addition, the Western European Union, which links nine EC
countries in a joint defense pact, is expected to announce
further joint military measures today.</p>
