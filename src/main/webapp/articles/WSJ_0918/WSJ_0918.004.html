	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House approved a bill that would allow
federal regulators to increase deposit insurance premiums
paid by banks and savings and loans to whatever level the
regulators saw fit.
   The House moved with unusual speed to pass the bill, which
also would give the regulators freedom to change the premiums
whenever they believed it necessary, in the wake of dire
reports last week that the bank deposit insurance fund could
require taxpayer assistance if a recession struck.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The bill is nearly assured of becoming law because it has
the backing of the Bush administration and strong support in
the Senate, where it is likely to come up shortly. In the
face of that consensus, the banking industry isn't lobbying
heavily against it.</p>
<p>Separately, the federal banking agencies settled a
year-long dispute over the minimum level of capital -- the
cushion against losses that is drained before deposit
insurance funds are called in -- banks must hold. The Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency acceded to a Federal
Reserve Board proposal to set the minimum at $3 for every
$100 of assets for banks that receive the highest ratings
from their regulators -- about one bank in five. Other banks
would be required to hold somewhat more capital.</p>
<p>The deposit-insurance measure passed by voice vote under
an expedited procedure. It was sponsored by Banking Committee
Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas) and the committee's
ranking Republican, Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, and had
broad bipartisan support.</p>
<p>In a clear sign of Congress's election-season sensitivity
that it not be blamed for dawdling if a crisis like the
savings and loan mess strikes the banking industry, the bill
moved directly to the House floor without any hearings or
Banking Committee action. Under the rules that expedited the
bill, a two-thirds vote was required for passage, but there
appeared to be no opposition and there were only a few
congressmen on the House floor when the measure was cleared.</p>
<p>The legislation would allow the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. to set the annual premiums for banks and thrifts as
high as it wishes, removing the cap of 32.5 cents per $100 of
deposits. Currently the FDIC can raise premiums a maximum of
7.5 cents in any one year. Just a few weeks ago, after
expressing fears that continued bank failures could cause a
$2 billion loss to the bank insurance fund this year, the
agency increased the premiums to 19.5 cents per $100 for 1991
from 12.5 cents in 1990.</p>
<p>If the bill becomes law, the FDIC isn't expected to move
to raise the premiums quickly, but the FDIC's chairman,
William Seidman, wants the added flexibility.</p>
<p>Edward Yingling, a top official of the American Bankers
Association, said the trade group wouldn't fight the
legislation but added that "the premiums could quickly reach
the point where additional premiums are counterproductive" by
draining funds from banks. Another trade group, the National
Council of Savings Institutions, noted that "institutions are
already experiencing very severe operating budget problems."</p>
<p>On capital requirements, the Comptroller pushed for a 3%
minimum capital ratio -- $3 for every $100 of assets -- while
the FDIC wanted a 4.5% level that would accept some less
tangible forms of capital in the extra 1.5%. Under the Fed
rule accepted by the comptroller, banks rated the strongest
by regulators would have a 3% floor, while others would be
required to hold as much as 5%, determined on an individual
basis. The FDIC is expected to pass the Fed's capital rules
this afternoon.</p>
<p>Because savings and loan capital requirements by law must
be as stringent as those for banks, the Fed's position will
affect some thrifts. A spokesman for the Office of Thrift
Supervision said it expected that 730 of the nation's 2,450
thrifts won't meet the capital requirements when they go into
effect at the end of the year.</p>
