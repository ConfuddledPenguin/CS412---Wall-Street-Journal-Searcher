	<p class="article-leader">LEON, Mexico -- When delegates from Mexico's ruling
political party gather next week in the capital for a plenum
on democratic reform, don't look for Felipe Hidalgo. The
party bosses don't want him there.
   Mr. Hidalgo, a ruling-party dissident in Mexico's central
breadbasket, operates in a milieu of his own. "This is real
political dirty work," he says, hoping a bad joke will take
his mind off being shin-deep in the muck of a flooded,
unpaved barrio. Mr. Hidalgo is here organizing members of the
underclass to stand up to mail-fisted local bosses who
dominate the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But it isn't easy taking on the political machine that has
dominated Mexico for 61 years, the longest reign of any party
in the non-Communist world. Mr. Hidalgo's election as a local
delegate to the party congress was nullified arbitrarily by
hard-line higher-ups. Support for Mr. Hidalgo is being
siphoned off by a new PRI schism that claims to be seeking
democratic reform even though it is bankrolled by the party
executive committee.</p>
<p>Worst of all, Mr. Hidalgo is being shadowed by a pair of
goons decked out like the Blues Brothers, in sunglasses,
slicked-back hair and designer jeans.</p>
<p>"I have to begin to think seriously about what kind of
future I can hope for working with the PRI," says the
32-year-old Mr. Hidalgo, a smallish man with a barrel chest
and almost no neck.</p>
<p>The U.S., which will soon begin negotiating a free-trade
agreement with Mexico, may begin mulling that question
itself. For as the U.S. and Mexican economies become
increasingly intertwined, Washington also becomes more
closely tied to one of the world's ever rarer authoritarian
political regimes.</p>
<p>Efforts to reform the PRI are constrained by the same
rigid party structure that has long made Mexico a bulwark of
stability in an unstable region. For years, the Mexican
government ruled by cutting deals with leaders of the PRI's
three sectors: labor, peasants and a "popular" catchall. The
bosses, or "caciques", won economic privileges for themselves
and made sure that some material benefits trickled down to
their constituents.</p>
<p>But today Mexico is more urbanized, economically diverse
and better-informed; the caciques are more resented by
society than representative of it. Moreover, as Mexico makes
the painful conversion to a market economy, less wealth
trickles down from the bosses to the masses. Increasingly,
the PRI must rely on intimidation and electoral fraud to
maintain control.</p>
<p>Mexican political analysts believe the PRI must be
converted into a real political party with "authentic
leaders" who own public trust. "But every time you see an
authentic leader rise up in the PRI, he's beaten down by the
caciques," says Ricardo Pascoe, a leader of the leftist Party
of the Democratic Revolution.</p>
<p>Mr. Hidalgo has been bumping up against corrupt officials
since he was a boy watching policemen shake down the cashier
in his grandfather's pool hall. Mr. Hidalgo didn't fight back
until he was in his early 20s. Tired of seeing his
neighborhood ignored by the public transport system, a
concession run by PRI caciques, he organized minivans to
shuttle residents in and out of the barrios. When the
caciques had him thrown in jail, hundreds of his neighbors
clamored for his release.</p>
<p>"In that jail cell I changed," he says. Mr. Hidalgo found
his calling in politics and joined the PRI, hoping to change
it from within.</p>
<p>Last year, Mr. Hidalgo joined a national movement to
reform the PRI called the Corriente Critica, or Critical
Current. Though they didn't intend to, old-line PRI bosses
became the dissident group's best promoters. Most of the
peasants in local communal farms came running to Mr. Hidalgo
after the PRI appointed an ex-convict to a key agricultural
post. Mr. Hidalgo won over one slum after residents took
offense at a finicky PRI leader who sponged his hands with
rubbing alcohol as he pressed the flesh.</p>
<p>Quickly the Corriente Critica became a force. It helped
organize an embarrassing protest against the governor during
a visit by the president. Some communities have so taken to
speaking out that they hold regular town meetings to denounce
everything from price-gouging merchants to unfaithful
husbands. "People always called us the pillars of the party:
we never moved and were always silent," says Miguel Rubio, a
local leader. "But after Felipe got started, people began
paying attention to us."</p>
<p>Some of the attention Mr. Hidalgo could do without.
Bounding out of the PRI offices one day, he catches a glimpse
of one of the men who has been tailing him. He still makes
his way to a nearby house, where he plans a protest over a
lagging street-repair program. But he seems anxious and
distracted throughout the discussion.</p>
<p>The PRI establishment has more subtle ways of muffling
dissent. When Mr. Hidalgo called a news conference to
criticize the appointment of a PRI official, several
reporters showed up -- but not a single paragraph ran in the
local press. One local party official, nicknamed the King of
Tricks, not only blocked Mr. Hidalgo's nomination as a
delegate, but also saw to it that reformers were excluded
from top posts in the local party.</p>
<p>Felipe Hidalgo is increasingly frustrated. One night he
drives to one of the worst barrios, San Felipe de Jesus,
where the only public works in evidence are the PRI slogans
painted on crumbling walls. Neighborhood leader Maria Zuniga
tells Mr. Hidalgo she has been lobbying for 50 taxi permits
for job-starved residents. She sat in the waiting room of the
local transportation chief's office for eight hours before
learning the permits had already been awarded to local union
bosses.</p>
<p>"Felipe, what's happening to the Corriente Critica?" Mrs.
Zuniga asks. "It looks like we're being frozen out."</p>
<p>"You have to be patient," Mr. Hidalgo says, trying to
sound cheerful. But as he pulls his pick-up truck out of the
mud, its clear Mr. Hidalgo is the one who needs bucking up.
"If there aren't any reforms in the PRI soon, I have to
consider getting a job where I feel some sense of
accomplishment," he says. Mr. Hidalgo sighs and glances
uneasily at the headlight winking in the rear-view mirror.</p>
