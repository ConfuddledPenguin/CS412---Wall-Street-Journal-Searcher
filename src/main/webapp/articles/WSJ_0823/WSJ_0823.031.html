	<p class="article-leader">FARE WARNING</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most European scheduled airlines are waiting until next
week's meeting of the International Air Transport Association
to decide how to bring their fares into line with sharply
higher fuel costs. But some European charter carriers are
boosting prices, and several cargo carriers said they have
raised rates to cover higher insurance premiums on planes
flying to the Middle East.</p>
<p>Although tensions in the Gulf have pushed spot market jet
kerosene up by about 35% in the past month, most scheduled
airlines in Europe have held off raising their ticket prices.
One reason, industry observers said, is that the weak dollar
has blunted the effects of the fuel runup for carriers buying
dollar-denominated kerosene with strong European currencies.
Another is a reluctance to be the first to take the unpopular
step.</p>
<p>One exception is British Airways, which this week sought
British government approval to boost its domestic fares by 6%
on Sept. 15. The company's trans-Atlantic fares are set to
increase by the same amount from Sept. 1.</p>
<p>Another is KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, which said yesterday
it plans to impose an unspecified surcharge on passenger and
freight tariffs to the 13 Middle East cities it serves.</p>
<p>The IATA meeting, scheduled for next Wednesday through
Friday in Geneva, will be open to 83 passenger and cargo
airlines that participate in IATA's tariff-setting
conferences.</p>
<p>NO BUTTS ABOUT IT</p>
<p>Lufthansa will ban smoking on its domestic flights,
beginning Oct. 28. The carrier, 51%-owned by the West German
government, said it took the decision following a passenger
survey in which "over 90%" of the respondents said they would
prefer that smoking not be allowed at all on flights.
However, a Lufthansa spokesman said smoking will continue to
be allowed in designated areas on international flights.</p>
<p>WARMING UP TO PRETORIA</p>
<p>Southern African nations that joined ranks 10 years ago to
isolate and reduce dependence on South Africa will celebrate
a decade of economic cooperation this week by extending the
hand of friendship to their old foe. Leaders of the 10-nation
Southern African Development Coordination Conference, due to
begin a two-day summit in Botswana tomorrow, have warmed up
to South Africa after recent political changes there. But
wary of possible domination by South Africa, the region's
economic giant, the organization is looking for assurances
that Pretoria will uphold regional interests.</p>
<p>IRISH BEEF STAKE</p>
<p>The Mideast crisis threatens to push the Irish beef-export
industry, already suffering from the recent scare over "mad
cow disease," into its worst year in more than a decade.
Ireland sends 43.5% of its beef exports to the Middle East
and North Africa, with Iraq, Iran and Egypt accounting for
more than 90% of that business.</p>
<p>SPOTTING LEOPARDS</p>
<p>Mongolia, rich in animal species, is beginning to count
its living wealth in order to improve conservation. The
nation's many rare animals include snow leopards, Gobi Desert
bears, wild Bactrian camels, argali sheep and ibexes.
Officials have set limits for years on the number of each
species that can be killed, seldom knowing how many there
were to start with. Mongolia seeks to foster tourism,
including hunting safaris, to earn hard currency.</p>
<p>NOW OR NEVER</p>
<p>Greece said that if Athens fails in its bid to host the
1996 Olympic Games it will quit trying. "If we don't get the
1996 Olympics, we will never bid to host them again," said
Spyros Metaxas, president of the Athens Olympic Bidding
Committee. Greece, birthplace of the Olympics 2,766 years
ago, is hoping to stage the centenary of the modern games in
Athens, where they were revived in 1896. The other candidates
for staging the games are Atlanta, Toronto, Melbourne,
Belgrade and Manchester, England.</p>
<p>EUROPEAN CROPS</p>
<p>Dry weather hasn't burned most farmers, European Community
officials say.</p>
<p>Although some farming regions in Europe have been hard hit
by this summer's drought, the officials noted that overall
damage to agriculture is "fairly limited." But the EC
Commission is worried that farmers hit by the water shortage
will ask for EC disaster-relief funds. The officials said
community finances already are strained by aid to Eastern
Europe, and farmers shouldn't count on an EC bailout.</p>
<p>The drought hasn't been as bad for farmers as generally
thought, the officials added. For the main crops, such as
cereals and rapeseed, overall production is likely to exceed
last year's. Therefore, cereal producers who have complained
of low prices because of overproduction are unlikely to get
quick relief from higher prices.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>The Angolan government will meet Unita rebels in Portugal
on Monday for a third round of direct peace talks, the
official Angolan newspaper reported. . . . South Korea and
Iran signed an accord to jointly develop telecommunications
and postal systems, officials in Seoul said.</p>
