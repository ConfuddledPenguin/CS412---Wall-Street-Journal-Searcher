	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- The benefits for Japan of increased imports since
the 1985 Plaza Accord have outweighed the drawbacks, the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.
   Since the Group of Seven industrialized nations agreed to
an appreciation of the yen against the dollar in September
1985, imports as a percentage of total Japanese goods have
risen 1.95%, to 8.58% in 1989, MITI said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>MITI said rising imports have helped free up 310,000
workers for other jobs, alleviating Japan's labor shortage.</p>
<p>With the latest job data showing 147 job offers for every
100 job seekers, the labor-saving impact of imports has
helped head off a sharp rise in wages which could have
threatened Japan's economic expansion, a MITI official said.</p>
<p>The official said cheaper import prices also raised
Japanese consumers' purchasing power and allowed more capital
spending by Japanese corporations.</p>
<p>Among the drawbacks, MITI said the rise in imports lowered
domestic production by 15 trillion yen ($102.2 billion) and
lowered gross national product by 6.4 trillion yen.</p>
<p>MITI said although internationalization of the economy was
an overall benefit to Japan, factors such as rising oil
prices and a weak U.S. economy could slow the pace in coming
years.</p>
