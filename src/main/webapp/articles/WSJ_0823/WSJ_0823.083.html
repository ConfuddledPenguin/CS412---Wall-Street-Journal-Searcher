	<p class="article-leader">Forstmann, Little & Co. said it completed its acquisition
of General Instrument Corp., a cable-TV equipment company,
for $1.5 billion.
   Some 95.5% of General Instrument, or 29.9 million common
shares, was tendered under the New York buy-out firm's
$44.50-a-share offer, which expired Tuesday at 5 p.m., a
Forstmann spokeswoman said. The remaining shares will be
redeemed at the same price.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Including options that were converted as part of the
purchase, General Instrument had about 34.6 million shares
outstanding, she added.</p>
<p>In connection with the deal, General Instrument said it
will redeem all its remaining subordinated convertible
debentures on Sept. 12 for a total price of $1,068.27,
including interest, for each $1,000 face amount.
Alternatively, before the redemption, holders may convert the
debentures, which pay 7.25% and are due in 2012, into
$1,097.01 in cash for each $1,000 outstanding.</p>
<p>The Forstmann spokeswoman said virtually all debentures
had been converted prior to the buy-out, and she expected any
remaining holders to take the cash offer.</p>
<p>In its fiscal year ended Feb. 28, General Instrument
earned $98.7 million, or $3.27 a share, on revenue of $1.38
billion.</p>
