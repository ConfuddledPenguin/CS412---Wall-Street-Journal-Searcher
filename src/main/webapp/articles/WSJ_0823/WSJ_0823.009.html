	<p class="article-leader">AMSTERDAM -- Dutch industrial production in the first half
rose 4% from a year earlier, the Dutch Central Bureau of
Statistics said.
   In June, industrial output rose 1% from May and 5% from
the year-earlier month. The first-half rise was particularly
strong in the metal, paper and graphics industries, but the
housing and construction industries posted lower than average
growth rates of 1% each.</p>
