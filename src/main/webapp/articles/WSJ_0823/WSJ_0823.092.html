	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Merrill Lynch & Co. said it named Thomas
Sowanick as chief bond strategist, replacing James Kochan who
departed after 10 years at the securities firm.
   Mr. Kochan left Merrill to oversee the fixed income
money-management area of Baird Asset Management, a division
of regional investment banking firm Robert W. Baird & Co., in
Milwaukee.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At Merrill, Mr. Kochan had played an important part in
mapping the firm's bond advice.</p>
<p>In the spring of last year, Merrill ran a huge newspaper
advertising campaign, strongly recommending "high quality"
bonds. That turned out to be a good call, as interest rates
fell and bond prices rose. But earlier this year, Mr. Kochan
said: "We are constructive" on bonds, "which is less than
bullish but not bearish." Bond prices fell sharply for
several months after that.</p>
<p>A native of the Manitowoc, Wis., area, Mr. Kochan said he
had wanted to return to his home state, which the Baird
position allowed him to do. Mr. Kochan also said he had
"always planned on some day getting involved in the asset
management function."</p>
<p>Mr. Sowanick had been a bond strategist under Mr. Kochan,
and often filled in for him.</p>
<p>A Merrill spokesman said, "We are obviously disappointed
at Jim's decision, and at the same time we wish him well in
his new challenge. Jim has been an outstanding research
professional at Merrill Lynch. His service to our sales force
and clients has been exemplary. We are very fortunate to have
Thomas Sowanick to orchestrate the strategy area. His role,
comparable to Jim Kochan's, gives us an experienced person to
continue to run the fixed income strategy effort."</p>
