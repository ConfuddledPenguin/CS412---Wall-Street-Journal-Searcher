	<p class="article-leader">Universal Studios Florida is blaming the designer of its
"Jaws" and "Earthquake" attractions for myriad problems that
have shut down the two popular rides for much of the time
since the $630 million theme park opened June 7.
   The problems have caused "significant damage to our
business," said a Universal spokesman in Orlando. In
addition, Universal said it is racking up expenses to
"correct deficiencies" in the designer's work.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Underwater technology experts and other consultants have
been retained to overhaul "Jaws." This is "a major situation
for us and we're angry," the spokesman said. "Earthquake" has
"design flaws" and is "unreliable."</p>
<p>The high-thrills attractions were designed and built by
Ride & Show Engineering Inc., a San Dimas, Calif., firm made
up largely of Walt Disney Co. alumni. In a lawsuit filed in
state court in Orlando last week, Universal Florida charged
the design firm with negligence and breach of contract,
including failure to have the rides operating satisfactorily
on time.</p>
<p>"We strongly deny the allegations. We have been good
partners and acted in good faith," said Mark Messersmith,
Ride & Show director of marketing.</p>
<p>Mr. Messersmith said that the firm has a "long history of
success" with Universal, especially in California. Ride &
Show built the "Miami Vice," "Earthquake" and "King Kong"
attractions on the Universal Studios backlot adjacent to the
corporate offices of MCA Inc.</p>
<p>Universal Studios Florida is a joint venture of MCA and
London-based Rank Organisation PLC.</p>
<p>However, MCA's Florida attraction is much more ambitious
than its 25-year-old Universal City studio tour. There,
visitors view "Jaws" from the safety of their tram tour
seats; in Orlando, the great white shark attacks and nearly
sinks a boat that guests are riding in.</p>
<p>Such "motion-based technology" used at the Orlando
attractions is more complicated than anything at Universal
City, Mr. Messersmith said. One of Ride & Show's gripes is
that many elements of the Orlando rides have been handled by
other vendors and are thus out of Ride & Show's control.</p>
<p>"We usually try to be the general contractor and then we
have ultimate responsibility. In this case we are under the
direction of Universal. Disney and Universal are different
that way," Mr. Messersmith said. Ride & Show was founded six
years ago by two ex-Disney Imagineering employees. A large
number of Ride & Show's employees also worked at Disney,
Universal's main rival in the theme-park business.</p>
<p>Universal Studios has been issuing a free ticket with each
paid admission to mollify visitors who are disappointed about
the closed rides. Tickets cost $29 for adults and $23 for
kids aged three to 11.</p>
<p>Jaws had been running off-and-on until it was shut down
recently to be redesigned and rebuilt, the Universal
spokesman said. "It will reopen next year." Earthquake is now
in "technical rehearsal" meaning it is open to the public
when it is working.</p>
<p>Another major attraction, Kongfrontation, also is having
problems. Universal said there aren't any plans to bring
legal action against the attraction's designer, which
Universal declined to identify.</p>
