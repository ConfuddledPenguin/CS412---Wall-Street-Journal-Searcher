	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Justin Industries Inc. said it and Tony Lama
Co., both makers of Western footwear, signed a definitive
agreement for Justin to acquire Tony Lama for about $18
million, or $9 a share, plus the assumption of about $34
million of debt.
   But an investor group holding about 12% of Justin and
eager to acquire the rest sharply criticized the merger,
calling it "a completely defensive maneuver, a blatant
attempt to make {Justin} undesireable." The two leaders of
the investor group are Perry Sutherland, vice president of
Kansas City, Mo.-based Sutherland Lumber Southwest Co., and
Barry S. Rosenstein of New York, a former associate of
corporate buy-out specialist Asher Edelman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>John Justin, chairman and chief executive officer of
Justin, denied the assertion by the group, saying the
proposed acquisition had "no connection whatsoever" to the
investor group's attempts to acquire Justin. He said, "we've
talked with Tony Lama off and on for several years," long
before the investor group acquired its stake.</p>
<p>Justin, which also makes building materials and industrial
equipment, posted 1989 footwear sales of $142 million. El
Paso-based Tony Lama, which makes Western boots and leather
accessories exclusively, had 1989 sales of $75.6 million.</p>
<p>Yet Tony Lama isn't as financially-fit as its boots are
famous. For 1989 the company posted a loss of $1.8 million,
or 95 cents a share, and for the first half of this year it
had a loss of $901,000, or 47 cents a share. As for its
stock, after a planned $14-a-share acquisition by a Houston
leveraged-buy-out company collapsed in March, the price fell
to below $5 a share.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Tony Lama
stock surged $3.50 to $8. Justin stock fell 75 cents to
$14.25 in national over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>The investment group said it feared that Tony Lama's
losses, combined with its $34 million in debt, overshadowed
the synergy for Justin of acquiring another bootmaker. "On
the surface, it looks like Justin is offering a very high
price for a company that lost {millions} on a pretax basis
over the last 12 months," said Mr. Sutherland.</p>
<p>Last March, Justin's board rejected an $18.50 a share, or
$140.5 million, offer from the investment group. Last month,
in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
investors said that they were still trying to acquire Justin.</p>
