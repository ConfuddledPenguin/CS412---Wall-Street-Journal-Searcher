	<p class="article-leader">COLUMBUS, Ohio -- Where can you find a large bowling
league for homosexuals, the first Henri Bendel's store
outside of Manhattan and the kind of avant-garde art that
would pique Jesse Helms's interest?
   San Francisco? Key West?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nope. Here, in Columbus.</p>
<p>Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>No kidding.</p>
<p>To many Americans, Columbus is Blandsville, U.S.A., a town
of cornfields, cheerleaders and Rotary Club dinners. And it's
true that, for decades, Columbus was a city young Buckeyes
passed through before leaving the state, a town of
steakhouses, drive-ins and roller rinks. Downtown was dead.
The old airport terminal looked more like a bus station.</p>
<p>And while Memphis had Elvis and Hoboken had Sinatra,
Columbus had Woody Hayes, Ohio State University's gruff
football coaching legend, who symbolized the city's earthy
image. Anne Hayes, his 76-year-old widow, recalls that one
night Woody was planning to wine and dine her, but they ended
up at his office watching game film of Michigan State. "Woody
said that was a pretty good evening -- and damn cheap, too,"
she says.</p>
<p>But now, Columbus is an anomaly in the middle of the Rust
Belt, a booming center of banking, insurance and other
service industries. Ohio's largest city for almost a decade,
with a population of 615,000 now, Columbus continues to be
one of the few growing metropolitan areas in a slow-growth
region. Want-ads fill almost 30 pages in the local
newspapers. Companies like Limited Inc., Banc One Corp.,
Worthington Industries Inc. and Wendy's International Inc.
have brought buckets of money to Columbus.</p>
<p>With the prosperity has come vitality and diversity. As
Columbus became a white-collar growth city in the 1970s and
'80s, young professionals poured into town, bringing with
them their Madison Avenue fashions and liberal politics. Now
the city has become a magnet for artists, actors, musicians
and bohemians.</p>
<p>In many ways, the city was a logical beachhead for the new
wave. The huge state university and the state capitol have
always brought in people more tolerant to nonconformists and
alternative life styles. Generous benefactors have helped,
too: Leslie Wexner, the owner of Limited, donated $25 million
for a sprawling, $43 million center for modern art that
opened last year on the Ohio State campus.</p>
<p>But Columbus's attraction also happened partly by default.
Most of the other major cities anywhere near Columbus are
older and more staid. Many people find Columbus more
adventuresome and tolerant than, say, nearby Cincinnati,
where the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibit caused such a furor.</p>
<p>Columbus will never be confused with Greenwich Village,
but the newcomers are changing the face of the city.
Restaurants for homosexuals sit cheek-by-jowl with
century-old white stone buildings housing old-line Columbus
law firms. Ritzy Gucci and middlebrow Lazarus Department
Store occupy the same shopping mall. At Mr. Wexner's posh
Henri Bendel's store downtown, a slender mannequin, wearing
an $8,800 black-beaded dress, sits on a velvet piano seat,
red rose at her side.</p>
<p>Transplanted artists spend their evenings dancing to
Stravinsky beneath a hovering stained glass image of Jesus at
a local church -- "a warm, wonderful feeling," says Victoria
Uris, a former New York choreographer who moved to Columbus
to "create my own scene."</p>
<p>She was among numerous volunteers who recently ripped 10
rows of pews out of the Third Avenue Community Church and
replaced them with a performing arts stage. It's easy to
experiment in Columbus, says Ms. Uris, because the arts
community is so new.</p>
<p>The heartbeat of Columbus's hip subculture is a renovated
district on High Street called the Short North. Ten years
ago, it was a combat zone, with condemned buildings, drunks
living in doorways, a brisk drug trade and rampant
prostitution. Now, it's chock-a-block with art galleries,
funky specialty shops, street performers and a huge orange
phallic symbol attached to the front of a bar.</p>
<p>On the side of an old warehouse lies Mona Lisa, painted
sideways. Inside, the Reality Theater Company presents plays
on nuclear war, street life and rape. Down the street is the
Ohio Ethnographic Gallery, featuring devil masks from Haiti
and Mexico.</p>
<p>For radical chic, there's the Mothra Wrapped in Black
shop, named after the monster from 1960s Japanese movies. On
walls and racks hang jeans with silkscreen skulls and
daggers, spiked wrist bands and homemade drop-crotch pants,
favored by rappers. "If you can get it in the shopping mall,
you can't get it here," says the proud owner, Harold Davis.</p>
<p>For seven years, zanies have come out in force each Fourth
of July, when the Short North holds its Doo-Dah parade. The
grand poo-bah of the Doo-Dah is Douglas P. Ritchey, a custom
jewelry merchant. For last year's parade, which drew tens of
thousands, he anointed himself Son of Purgatory -- a gibe at
the city's more sober Son of Heaven Chinese artifacts
exhibit. And on Halloween, there's the Short North costume
contest, with prizes for "Most Naked but Legal" and "Best Use
of Skin."</p>
<p>"People here are starting to loosen up and realize there's
more to the world than white bread and paintings that match
the couch," Mr. Ritchey says.</p>
<p>That includes a new openness to the gay community, which
claims to have the largest bowling league in the country --
almost 400 members -- along with a softball team that
challenged the police department to a game this summer.
Scheduling conflicts postponed it until next summer.</p>
<p>"We even have lesbian Republicans," says Rhonda R. Rivera,
law professor at Ohio State University.</p>
<p>Things aren't perfect in Columbus, of course. Columbus is
the bank-robbery capital of the Midwest; the metropolitan
region has had about 90 holdups this year. Even Chicago has
only had 32.</p>
<p>And some longtime residents aren't thrilled with the new
beat in what's long been a serene, slow-paced city, where
polo and boating are favored pastimes and "equestrian
communities" accommodate homeowners and their horses.</p>
<p>Marilyn Harris, sitting in the City Center shopping mall,
is unimpressed with the perfectly groomed sales clerks who
work in exclusive stores like Gucci, Ralph Lauren Polo and
Henri Bendel's. Instead, Mrs. Harris, who says that she's in
her 60s, fondly recalls Charles Lazarus and his family, who
ran the Lazarus stores until the early 1980s. "Mrs. Charles
Lazarus," she says, "used to work in the garden and get dirt
under her fingernails."</p>
<p>For their part, newcomers have been frustrated that some
people are still guarded about avant-garde ideas. Kent Rigsby
hoped to bring culinary influences from France and Italy to
Columbus when he opened Rigsby's Cuisine Volatile four years
ago. He put the kitchen in the dining room. He served salmon
very rare. And he offered expensive delicacies like foie
gras. "I thought I could make a unique statement in
Columbus," he says.</p>
<p>The restaurant has proved popular, but Mr. Rigsby has
suffered his disappointments. Diners send back the salmon,
complaining that it's raw. "I'm hesitant about even putting
steaks on the menu because it pains me to cook them
medium-well to well-done," he says. And foie gras? "We
couldn't sell it to save our lives," he says.</p>
<p>Upscale merchants say that budget-conscious shoppers are
mystified at the high price of status. The City Center's
Milano Fur & Leather, a specialty import store, had to send
back $700 possum-lined jackets because "people didn't
understand them," says Rita Williams, the store manager.</p>
<p>"Here, people want the better shopping, yet they don't
want to pay for it," says the manager of Cashmeres of
Scotland, Debi Boggs. So she pushes the $350 crew-neck and
V-neck classics instead of the high-fashion $1,000 jackets.</p>
<p>But as Columbus grows, even the most eccentric residents
will find kindred spirits. Steven Stulholzer, a restaurant
manager, founded the Pagan Community Council of Central Ohio
this year. A public ritual is planned on Samhain -- that's
Halloween for non-pagans -- and Mr. Stulholzer figures about
60 followers will attend.</p>
<p>"The pagan community," he says, "is slowly coming out."</p>
