	<p class="article-leader">Algoma Steel Corp. of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, said it
hired Lancaster Financial Inc. to find a buyer for its Huron
Steel group of companies, a steel auto parts maker based in
Windsor, Ontario.
   Algoma, a unit of Dofasco Inc. of Hamilton, Ontario,
Canada's largest steelmaker, said Huron has about 325
employees and had sales last year of 55 million Canadian
dollars (US$48.3 million).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Algoma, which didn't disclose an asking price for Huron,
said the planned sale is consistent with the company's
strategy of focusing on its core steelmaking business. It
said proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes
and for reducing debt.</p>
