	<p class="article-leader">Anheuser-Busch Cos., a St. Louis-based brewer, confirmed
that in April, it put "on hold" its plan to build a $300
million theme park and resort in Spain, citing difficulties
with municipal officials in the region.
   Anheuser last year said it intended to build the park in
the Costa Brava region, on the Mediterranean Sea near
Barcelona. The 1,580-acre first phase was to include a golf
course, hotel, retail facilities, homes and condominiums, and
the theme park. In a possible second phase for expansion,
initially expected to be completed in 2000, Anheuser
tentatively planned to spend an additional $275 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the municipality with jurisdiction over the park
property separated in late 1989 into two cities, which then
voided previous pacts on taxes and services, according to
Anheuser. The company said that the situation hasn't been
resolved, and that it is investigating "other suitable
sites," should terms not be reached. A spokesman declined to
elaborate on potential sites.</p>
