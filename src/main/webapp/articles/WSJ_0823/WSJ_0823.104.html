	<p class="article-leader">ACEC-Union Miniere S.A. said it and Mexicana de Cobre S.A.
had offered to buy the Cananea copper mine from the Mexican
government for $475 million.
   The Belgian non-ferrous metals and mining concern said it
had formed a joint venture with Mexicana de Cobre to bid for
the mine, which is being auctioned as part of the Mexican
government's privatization program.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ACEC-UM said it would hold a 21% stake in the joint
venture, to be called Mexicana de Cananea S.A. de CV.</p>
<p>The company said it wouldn't comment on the details of its
offer until the Mexican government had issued its response,
which is required within 10 days. The Belgian company said
its offer, made Monday, was the highest bid.</p>
<p>Spokesman Philippe de Vynck said ACEC-UM is seeking to
diversify its sources of copper supply by investing in the
Mexican mine.</p>
<p>ACEC-UM's Metallurgie Hoboken-Overpelt unit is the largest
refiner of copper in Europe. ACEC-UM is 82% owned by holding
company Societe Generale de Belgique S.A.</p>
