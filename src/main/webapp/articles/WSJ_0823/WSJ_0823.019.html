	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Stung by a 56% plunge in second-quarter
pretax profit, AB Electrolux said it plans to lay off 10% of
its 150,000 employees world-wide by the end of next year
under a sweeping cost-cutting drive.
   The Swedish appliance concern said about 8,000 of the
15,000 job cuts would occur this year. Anders Scharp, chief
executive officer, said the biggest reduction would come in
the U.S. where market demand has softened so far this year
and isn't expected to recover for at least the next 18
months.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Electrolux said it will sell certain "nonstrategic"
loss-making operations, which weren't identified, as well as
certain real estate assets in the U.S. and Western Europe to
finance the estimated 700 million Swedish kronor ($121.52
million) cost of the restructuring moves. Those sales
probably won't be completed until next year, company
officials said.</p>
<p>Mr. Scharp remained guarded in his assessments of economic
prospects, especially in the U.S. where he said "there's
already a recession in our markets." And while he remained
confident that Electrolux would maintain its strong market
positions in both North America and Western Europe, he didn't
hold out prospects of rapid recovery for the company's
sagging profitability.</p>
<p>"We don't anticipate any improvement in the economic
outlook through the end of next year. If anything things
could turn out worse than we're expecting, especially in
Sweden," he said.</p>
<p>Electrolux said second-quarter pretax profit plunged to
500 million Swedish kronor from 1.12 billion kronor a year
earlier. Sales during the period declined 4% to 22.33 billion
kronor from 23.25 billion kronor the previous year.</p>
<p>Company officials said the Industrial Products division
accounted for more than half the second-quarter profit drop.
Spiraling raw material costs and falling prices for finished
products slashed profit at the Graenges AB aluminum unit.</p>
<p>Mr. Scharp declined to discuss which of the "nonstrategic
operations" Electrolux planned to put on the block. In recent
years, the company has expanded its outdoor-products division
through aggressive acquisitions. Besides Appliances, which
account for roughly 50% of sales, divisions for Commercial
Appliances and Commercial Services are also usually viewed as
core operations.</p>
<p>Lennart Ribohn, chief financial officer, cites the case of
a U.S. dishwasher factory to illustrate the delays Electrolux
has encountered. The Swedish concern acquired a small
dishwasher plant as part of the 1986 purchase of White
Consolidated Industries Inc.; bought another U.S. dishwasher
company to further boost volume; and then prepared to shift
the combined operations to a new plant in North Carolina.</p>
<p>But the plant construction project dropped behind
schedule, forcing Electrolux to continue parallel production
at the inefficient old plants. A new dishwasher model
redesigned according to specifications from a big buyer,
Sears, Roebuck & Co., still hasn't reached the market.</p>
<p>Similar snags have occurred at almost all 15 major plant
overhauls Electrolux has undertaken, Mr. Ribohn said. "In
retrospect we obviously were too ambitious and tried to do
too much at once."</p>
