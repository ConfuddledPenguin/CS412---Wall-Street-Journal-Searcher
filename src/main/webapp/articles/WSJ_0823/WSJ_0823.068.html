	<p class="article-leader">FORT WORTH, Texas -- AMR Eagle, the regional carrier
division of AMR Corp., said it agreed to buy 25 ATR turboprop
aircraft and take options for an additional 75, in a deal
that could be valued at as much as $800 million.
   AMR, parent of American Airlines, said the order also
included the leasing of an additional 16 planes made by ATR,
a joint venture of Aeritalia S.p.A. of Italy and Aerospatiale
S.A. of France.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>AMR Eagle consists of six carriers that fly to smaller
cities in the U.S. and feed passenger traffic into the larger
system of American Airlines. AMR Eagle has 211 planes, and
with the ATR order, expects its fleet to increase by 70
planes next year.</p>
<p>The ATR transaction, which had been expected, consists of
orders for 16 ATR-42s and options on an additional 25, and
orders for nine Super ATRs and options on 50 more of the
planes. The ATR-42 is a 46-passenger aircraft, and the Super
ATR is a stretch version that seats 64. The first of the
planes on order are to be delivered in March, in a schedule
that will stretch into 1996.</p>
<p>In Rome, Aeritalia valued the AMR order at $1 billion, and
said this is the biggest order it has received for its
planes. An AMR Eagle spokesman declined to comment on the
value of the contract. But industry analysts said the $1
billion figure is on the high side. As the largest U.S.
carrier, AMR typically negotiates hefty discounts for itself,
particularly on large aircraft orders such as this one.</p>
<p>This marks AMR Eagle's second large order for planes this
month. Earlier, it ordered 35 Jetstream Super 31s made by
British Aerospace PLC and optioned 15 more. It also took 50
options on Jetstream 41s.</p>
