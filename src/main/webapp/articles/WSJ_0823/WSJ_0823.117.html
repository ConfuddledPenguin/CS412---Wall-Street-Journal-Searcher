	<p class="article-leader">Donald Trump said he has taken the Trump Shuttle off the
market.
   Hours after signing the final closing documents on his $65
million bank bailout, Mr. Trump said in a telephone interview
that he pulled the shuttle from the market because it was now
a moneymaking operation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The sale of the shuttle, which Mr. Trump purchased from
Eastern Airlines last year for $365 million, had been sought
by his bankers to ease the drain on his cash flow and help
restructure his troubled empire. Until recently, the shuttle
was showing losses even before debt payments were factored
in. In the past few months, Mr. Trump has said the shuttle
operations have improved and, under the bank deal, some of
the debts payments will be deferred. The improvement in
operations, however, could be stalled by recent increases in
oil prices.</p>
<p>As part of Mr. Trump's agreement with his bankers,
interest payments on about $135 million of the debt service
on the shuttle will be deferred. Mr. Trump said that even
though the shuttle must continue making payments on its
remaining $245 million in debt, it is still making money.
"It's a great asset," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump's bankers have said in the past that the sale of
the shuttle would be an important component of getting Mr.
Trump back on his feet. Previously obtained documents show
Mr. Trump has already had losses of about $100 million since
purchasing the airline.</p>
<p>In June, former Trump Shuttle President Bruce Nobles said
no bids had been received for the airline, though Mr. Trump
disputed that claim. Mr. Nobles was subsequently dismissed
from his position.</p>
<p>Documents prepared by Mr. Trump's accounting firm, Kenneth
Leventhal & Co., estimate that as a going market concern, the
shuttle has a value of $340 million. If sold as part of a
liquidation, the accounting firm estimated, the Shuttle would
only fetch between $150 and $300 million.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Trump announced that the "vast transaction"
with his bankers was completed, and suggested his recovery is
tied to a turnaround in the Northeast's economy. "Interest
rates must come down sharply, and credit, which is squeezing
every business, must be made available," he said.</p>
<p>With the bank deal behind them, Mr. Trump's advisers said
they were now preparing a restructuring of his $1.3 billion
in casino debt. "This has been the most grueling assignment I
have ever been involved with," said Kenneth Leventhal
comanaging partner Stan Ross, who served as Mr. Trump's chief
liaison to the nearly 100 banks involved in the bailout.</p>
