Overseas shares closed at $15.875, down 37.5 cents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company had 34.9 million shares outstanding before it
said on Monday that it would buy back the one million shares
in the open market. It completed the private purchase

in the open market, "other opportunities came up," which
necessitated the privately negotiated approach, a spokesman
said.</p>
