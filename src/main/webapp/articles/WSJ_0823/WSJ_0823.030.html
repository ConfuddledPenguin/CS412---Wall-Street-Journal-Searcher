   Are Not Enough</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Terry Eastland's otherwise excellent article, "Heed
Reagan's Errors in Filling Brennan's Seat" (editorial page,
July 23), contains a serious inaccuracy. Mr. Eastland writes
that the vicious campaign against Judge Robert Bork was "the
first of its kind ever against a Supreme Court nominee." Not
so.
   In 1930, when President Hoover nominated Charles Evans
Hughes to succeed Chief Justice William Howard Taft, Hughes
became the target of a scurrilous attack almost as bad as
that directed at Mr. Bork. He was falsely depicted as a "tool
of Wall Street" and, as with Mr. Bork, was vilified by
distortions of his record and by outright lies.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hughes was the greatest lawyer of his time and the most
highly qualified person ever considered for judicial office
in the U.S. He had served as governor of New York, associate
justice of the Supreme Court and secretary of state. In 1916,
he was almost elected president in a cliffhanger contest with
Woodrow Wilson.</p>
<p>Incredible as it may now seem, 26 senators voted to reject
the nomination of this superbly qualified jurist. There were
15 Democrats and 11 "progressive" Republicans (the kind who
today are known as "moderates") in this group. It is said
that in later years some of these senators privately
apologized to Chief Justice Hughes for their shameful
behavior.</p>

<p>Mr. Eastland's suggestion that an affirmative-action
selection for a justice would be a bad idea was demeaning and
in poor taste. How would this be bad? It is ironic and
disturbing that Mr. Eastland, a former Justice Department
official, should ostensibly harbor a lack of appreciation for
this policy as well as an apparent disregard for the growing
diversity of American communities.</p>
<p>As if it were not enough that the specter of tokenism
would have blemished any minority candidate selected to
replace Justice Brennan, Mr. Eastland's insensitive statement
does not bode well for the future of qualified minorities
attaining government positions. Adherence to this
equal-opportunity vehicle, which theoretically is supposed to
ensure due representation via a quota system, may not be
entirely correct, yet neither is it acceptable "to solidify a
conservative Supreme Court majority" to assuage certain
political parties.</p>
<p>Like many Americans, I am unfamiliar with Judge David H.
Souter. Similarly, I am unaware of what Mr. Bush meant when
he declared his intention to fill the high-court vacancy with
a "strict constructionist." Nonetheless, it is unfortunate
that credentials and experience seem to be secondary
requirements for those occupying positions of special trust
and confidence.</p>
<p>Americans should demand of all officials and
representatives -- elected or otherwise -- moral leadership.
Moral guidance has been relegated to the pursuit of trendy
social issues that does little to engender faith in those in
office. In determining who will set the moral climate we must
find leaders in public and private life whom we can look to
for guidance and example and overcome the urge to perpetuate
the status quo.</p>
