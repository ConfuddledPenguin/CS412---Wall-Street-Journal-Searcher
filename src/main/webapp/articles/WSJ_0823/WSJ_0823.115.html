	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Once-highflying McCaw Cellular Communications
now seems to be caught in a downdraft.
   McCaw's problem is that it is a 1980s-style company.
Nurtured by the now defunct junk-bond house Drexel Burnham
Lambert, it piled on debt to buy mobile-telephone territory
at high prices. But with the economy faltering, McCaw is
losing favor with skeptical investors who don't like debt and
aren't sure how to value media assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In recent weeks, McCaw shares have been knocked down to 17
3/4, off 1 yesterday, from 27 3/4 in mid-July, and some bears
predict the selling isn't over. McCaw, which is getting hit
harder than other cellular stocks, traded as high as 47 last
year. McCaw's junk bonds also have been coming under fire.</p>
<p>"I'm not optimistic about McCaw" stock, says Gordon Fines,
a fund manager at IDS Financial Services. Earlier this year,
he dumped McCaw shares when they were trading in the 30s.</p>
<p>McCaw, once the darling of media investors, is the
nation's biggest cellular phone player. It grew crazily in
recent years as its go-go chief, Craig McCaw, bet the ranch
to build a national cellular network, bidding up prices for
cellular systems that he wanted to buy.</p>
<p>McCaw keeps posting losses, but revenue in the past five
years has grown seventeenfold, to a projected $500 million or
more this year. Starry-eyed cellular fans expect the company
to double in size in the next couple of years. They envision
a day when everyone will own a Dick Tracy-style wristwatch
with a mobile phone, making McCaw hugely profitable.</p>
<p>But now McCaw, after buying half of LIN Broadcasting in
March, is saddled with total debt of more than $4 billion and
an annual interest bill of roughly $390 million.</p>
<p>Moreover, the cellular phone business is facing its first
nationwide recession. Some analysts think that in hard times
many owners of mobile phones might stop using them -- typical
bills run at least $100 a month -- and they expect fewer
people to fork out a few hundred dollars to buy a cellular
phone.</p>
<p>Even if McCaw continues to sign on new customers fast,
almost everybody thinks it will keep showing big losses for
several years. (In the second quarter, McCaw's loss was $60.7
million.) Nobody even expects McCaw's operations to produce
enough cash flow till 1992 or 1993 to pay interest on all its
debt. In the next four years, analyst Ben Bendre of Salomon
Brothers says McCaw's negative cash flow will total more than
$1 billion.</p>
<p>Although McCaw has bank credit lines to cover the black
hole in its cash flow, analysts say the bankers could pull
back if McCaw starts missing performance targets defined in
its loan agreements.</p>
<p>"If the economy worsens, there's pressure on McCaw," says
Bear Stearns analyst Kenneth Leon. In July, when McCaw shares
were around 26, he told clients to bail out. Meanwhile,
British Telecom, which in 1989 paid $1.5 billion for 20% of
McCaw, has seen the market value of its investment cut in
half.</p>
<p>McCaw might need to raise more equity by issuing shares to
a big U.S. investor, Mr. Leon says -- a move that could bump
its stock down further. Alternatively, he says McCaw must
keep borrowing or selling assets -- in a climate where prices
for cellular systems are eroding.</p>
<p>When McCaw won a bidding war for LIN, it paid $350 for
every person living in the markets where LIN operates, or
$350 "per pop," in Wall Street jargon. Soon after, McCaw sold
other cellular systems to Contel Cellular for only about $210
"per pop," though McCaw posted a big gain on the sale.</p>
<p>Although LIN operates in prime markets, McCaw "paid a high
price" and might have trouble doing really well with the
acquisition, says Salomon's Mr. Bendre. Looking further out,
McCaw could face stiff rivalry from regional phone companies'
cellular units, as well as from new technologies.</p>
<p>"I think there's still 50% air in McCaw stock," says
Michael Murphy, who publishes the Overpriced Stock Service in
San Francisco. "Cellular phones are a nice perk in good
times, but they're the most easily postponable expense in the
world."</p>
<p>Rufus Lumry, McCaw's chief financial officer, says "I
would characterize us as a '90s company," not an '80s
company. McCaw has raised a lot of equity from British
Telecom and asset sales, he notes; shareholders equity now
exceeds $2 billion, though some of that will disappear as the
company keeps losing money. Mr. Lumry adds that in the
difficult '90s markets, McCaw's acquisition of LIN was among
the few deals to get bank financing.</p>
<p>A McCaw spokesman says the company is doing better than
its bankers expected. Also, "we feel our financial structure
is prudent. We don't see the need for asset sales and I'm not
aware of any ongoing talks about issuing more equity." McCaw
has been through recessions in Texas and Oklahoma, he adds;
new subscribers kept signing up, though at a slower rate.</p>
<p>Still, Bear Stearns's Mr. Leon says cellular fans might do
better with less-leveraged "plays" such as Cellular
Communications, Racal Telecom and U S West NewVector.</p>
<p>Recently, some investors have been selling short McCaw
stock -- betting it will fall further -- and buying McCaw's
junk bonds. The company's 12.95% bonds due 1999, which last
year traded near 100 cents on the dollar, now are at 80 and
are yielding about 17.4%. That distressed level indicates
some bondholders think McCaw might have trouble paying its
debts. A short-seller sells borrowed shares, hoping to buy
them back later at a lower price.</p>
<p>If McCaw exercises its option to buy the rest of LIN in
1995, it will need to raise an additional $5 billion -- or
put LIN up for sale. Since the McCaw-LIN merger, LIN stock,
at 54 1/8, down 2 7/8 yesterday, has fallen by about 25%.</p>
<p>Of course, if leverage works for McCaw, it will be a titan
of the cellular business. With the purchase of fast-growing
LIN, McCaw is in six of the 10 top U.S. mobile-phone markets.
Last week, Goldman Sachs said it was still recommending
"aggressive purchase" of McCaw and majority-owned LIN.</p>
<p>Goldman values McCaw's assets as high as $60 a share. But
in today's market, where investors look for cash flow and
earnings, it's hard to know where McCaw should trade.</p>
<p>Even now, with the stock at 17 3/4, shareholders value all
of McCaw's equity at more than $3 billion, about equal to
long-term debt. In effect, stock players are judging McCaw to
be no riskier than, say, MCI Communications, says Robert
Long, who heads First Boston's junk-bond research. But MCI's
cash flow covers the company's interest expense and McCaw's
doesn't. Still, "I like McCaw's bonds for their 17% yields,"
Mr. Long says.</p>
<p>Some McCaw bondholders say that if McCaw falters, it can
sell assets to pay them back. They figure that even if
cellular values fall to $90 per pop, McCaw's bonds will have
good value.</p>
<p>But selling assets to pay debt was a 1980s game. If Donald
Trump can't sell prime Manhattan properties at awesome
prices, who knows what values McCaw's cellular systems will
fetch? "You need someone willing to buy, and able to finance
the purchase" of cellular assets, says one gloomy McCaw
bondholder.</p>
<p>While McCaw has been well-run, Salomon's Mr. Bendre says,
"as recession sets in, you instinctively feel it will be a
damper" on McCaw's growth.</p>
<p>McCaw's chief, nevertheless, is well fortified for the
future. Last year, he made $54 million, mostly by exercising
stock options that he got in the early 1980s.</p>
