	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Around the world, securities firms have been
blaming Saddam Hussein for the recent stock sell-off on
international markets. But at the battered Tokyo exchange,
traders are acknowledging a different and more painful truth:
The glory days for the Japanese market may be over -- and
that, in the bigger picture, has little to do with Iraqi
tanks in Kuwait.
   "For five years, this market defied the law of gravity,"
says Bruce Johnson, director of research at Barings
Securities Ltd. in Tokyo. "Now, economic fundamentals are
catching up."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>And in a big way. Analysts had hoped that the
roller-coaster ride the Japanese stock market has taken this
year -- up 400 points one day, down 500 the next -- would be
a mere interlude on the way to ever-higher stock prices. But
now, even the most optimistic traders are changing their
tune.</p>
<p>The market has plummeted precipitously this year,
particularly in the last few weeks, in what amounts to its
most bearish performance since World War II. Suddenly, the
potent mixture of avarice and optimism that blasted Japanese
stocks into the stratosphere in the 1980s has been supplanted
by a pervasive sense of gloom. The Tokyo Stock Exchange this
year has recorded eight of the 10 largest declines in its
history. On Wednesday the Nikkei average fell 1086.93 points,
or 4%, to close at 25210.91, its lowest level in more than
two years. (In early trading Thursday, the Nikkei was down
521.09 points.)</p>
<p>The index has now dropped 35% since the start of the year
and 18% since the beginning of August. Over the last eight
months, stocks in the market have lost a third of their value
-- more than $1.3 trillion. And while the Tokyo exchange
started out the year as the world's most heavily capitalized
market, it has since fallen behind the New York Stock
Exchange.</p>
<p>Gone is the era when investors could blithely ignore
economic factors -- as they did in the 1980s -- and still
reap an average compound annual return of more than 20%. Gone
are the days when one of every dozen actively traded stocks
would double in a single year -- as happened in 1989. Gone,
too, are the explanations of how Japan's arcane corporate
accounting system or its sparkling economic prospects could
justify price to earnings ratios four or five times as high
as those on Wall Street or in the City of London. In the
words of Hiroshi Uchida, an analyst for CS First Boston
(Japan) Ltd.: "It's obvious that a bubble has burst."</p>
<p>For now, economists say, the stock market's implosion
doesn't presage the end of Japan's 45-month-long economic
boom. The world's second largest economy, driven by consumer
spending and heavy capital investment by manufacturers,
galloped ahead at a remarkable annualized growth rate of
10.4% in the first three months of the year. That breakneck
pace may be slowing, but most experts still expect Japan's
economy to grow by 4% to 5% this calendar year and next. And
corporate profits are generally stable or rising slightly.</p>
<p>Instead, there are certain trends within that robust
economy that are working to rein in the stock market, to the
point that share prices aren't expected to rise to their
previous highs any time soon. "The market is lower, and it's
going to stay lower," says Liam Newberg, an analyst at
Merrill Lynch & Co.'s Tokyo office.</p>
<p>A formidible array of negatives -- chief among them
tighter liquidity -- heralds a long bout of stock-market
malaise, experts say. The crisis in the Middle East, which
helped drive the New York Stock Exchange down more than 43
points yesterday, has depressed Japanese prices lately but is
considered a secondary factor in the long run. Indeed, some
analysts believe this year's more fundamental shift in the
Tokyo market ultimately could prove to be one of the most
important changes in Japan's post-World War II development.
They say Japan is entering a period of tighter money and,
eventually, industry shake-outs.</p>
<p>Already, some analysts are spotting weaknesses in
companies that didn't get around to raising money through
additional public offerings during the stock market boom. In
the shipbuilding industry, for example, all six of Japan's
major manufacturers eagerly want to retool production
capacity to keep pace with rising demand. But in recent
months, only two -- Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. and
Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. -- have raised new
capital through the equity market. "The other shipbuilders
are going to have to resort to some very creative financing"
to keep up with their competitors, says Thomas Murtha, an
analyst at Baring Securities. "They'll have to work hard just
to stay in place."</p>
<p>The market's plunge earlier this year prompted Japan's big
securities houses to stop underwriting new issues and,
although they started again in July, new issues have been
reduced to a trickle. Therefore, consolidation in businesses
such as shipbuilding, construction and banking may be
inevitable, analysts say.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, interest rates in Japan have moved
decidedly -- and, analysts say, permanently -- higher than
they were in the 1980s, restricting another source of capital
for businesses and individual investors.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan began this new era in May 1989 when it
raised its discount rate -- the first rate hike by the
central bank in that decade. Since then, though, the Bank of
Japan has raised the rate three more times, and nearly
everybody in Japan's financial markets expects at least one
more boost by year's end. The rate now stands at 5.25% --
more than double its historic low during the February 1987 to
May 1989 period.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein's occupation of Kuwait will likely help
keep rates high, if higher oil prices begin to spur higher
inflation in Japan. Until the recent embargo, the country
imported nearly 12% of its oil from Iraq and Kuwait. The
runaway inflation that followed the 1973 oil crisis left a
powerful impression on Bank of Japan governor Yasushi Mieno.
Economists expect him to keep interest rates high,
particularly if oil prices start to rapidly rise again.</p>
<p>The central bank's vigilance against inflation -- and
therefore its inclination to keep interest rates high -- will
probably increase in the latter part of the decade. Japan's
population is aging at a rate faster than that of any other
industrial nation, and its labor pool isn't growing.
Competition for new recruits is so intense that this spring
one textile manufacturer offered to buy each new hire a new
car as an incentive to sign on. Scarce labor is expected to
put so much pressure on wages that eventually "it could lead
to a South American style inflation if something isn't done,"
warns William H. Brown, president of Scudder, Stevens & Clark
Japan Inc., a fund-management firm.</p>
<p>Just as high rates have choked the stock market recently,
the low interest rates of the 1980s allowed Japan's stock
market to soar. "Liquidity was the lifeblood" of the market's
half-decade-long rally, says Mr. Brown. In the year ended
March 31, 1990, profit at 560 major companies was up 8.4%,
after growing more than 20% in the two previous fiscal years,
according to Yamaichi Securities Co. The central bank's key
measure of money supply has been growing at about 10% or more
a year since 1987.</p>
<p>During the booming bull market, a company's earnings
performance was often irrelevant to investors. Buoyed by the
availability of money, share prices seemed inevitably to
climb. Sometimes, even stocks in declining sectors, like
fisheries and mining, performed as well as or better than
stocks in high-growth sectors like automobiles and electric
appliances.</p>
<p>"When I started following this market, I thought, `This is
a completely speculative market and I don't understand it,'"
recalls Robert Zeilinski, a veteran analyst with Jardine
Fleming Securities Ltd. "Then I studied it some more and
decided, `No, it just functions according to a different set
of rules than Wall Street.' Then I studied it again, and
decided that probably I was right the first time: It's a
stupid market. Basically, everyone's just trying to figure
out what everyone else is buying."</p>
<p>But Japan's financial markets were smart enough to realize
that wealth begets wealth. Property prices soared in many
parts of Japan, as investors channeled money made in the
stock market into land, then channeled money borrowed against
escalating property values back into stocks. Stock prices
more than tripled and land prices more than doubled in the
last half of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Bank of Japan started worrying that this
asset inflation could spill over into consumer-price
inflation, and that's what triggered the policy of soaking up
excess liquidity with higher interest rates. Japanese
government bonds now yield more than 8%, for the first time
in six years. Corporate earnings per share, meanwhile,
average only 2.2% of stock prices.</p>
<p>Now, investors are socking away more and more money in
newly deregulated kinds of bank accounts that offer
market-based interest rates. Taking a break in the sunshine
on the steps of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Junichi Watanabe, a
trader with Baring Securities Ltd., gives voice to a now
common opinion: "Why invest in stocks, which can be
dangerous, when you can put money in a bank without any
risk."</p>
<p>Even globalization is contributing to Japan's new
liquidity crunch. In recent years, Japanese investors have
become savvier about investing abroad, and are looking at
more than just U.S. Treasury bonds. Purchases of West German
stocks by Japanese investors, for example, are zooming.
Clearly, the resulting paucity of money in the Japanese
market has directly influenced the trading floor. In the
tumultuous first six months of this year, daily trading
volume plummeted, right along with the value of trades. The
average daily trading value amounted to 879 billion yen, or
roughly $6 billion, during the first six months of this year.
That's about a third of the average daily value during the
same period last year.</p>
<p>A thin market also is a potentially volatile one. When
volume declines, the impact of a few large trades is
exaggerated, which is one reason many analysts blamed
computerized program trading for some of the steepest losses
this year. In program trading, an investor relies on a
computer to spot and quickly exploit -- often with big trades
-- price discrepancies in the market. Some of Japan's larger
securities firms have asked regulators to impose new
restrictions on the practice, which is largely conducted in
Japan by American companies.</p>
<p>Still, the big brokerage houses realize that simply
shackling program trades won't restore the market's former
luster. "We've passed the peak," says Stephen D. Barber, a
managing director at MIM Investco K.K., a British investment
firm in Japan. "It's fairly clear where we're going. A lot of
stocks have run their course."</p>
