	<p class="article-leader">STOCKHOLM -- Norsk Data AS said it broke even in this
year's first half, a surprisingly early recovery from huge
losses the previous two years.
   The Oslo-based computer concern reported pretax profit of
one million Norwegian kroner ($165,000) for this year's first
six months, compared with a loss of 194 million kroner a year
earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sales climbed 10% to 1.22 billion kroner from 1.1 billion
kroner.</p>
<p>Orders were flat in the first six months, but an 8%
decline in operating costs helped produce a swing in
operating profit to 10 million kroner, compared with a
year-earlier operating loss of 214 million kroner.</p>
<p>Norsk Data didn't give a forecast for the full year. But
Chief Executive Officer Erik Engebretsen said sales gains for
various new products in several key markets showed the
company was gradually regaining confidence of customers. "It
shows that the painful cost-cutting measures taken last year
are working," Mr. Engebretsen said.</p>
<p>By laying off 700 employees, or 21% of its work force
during the past 12 months, Norsk Data lowered its break-even
level to a level corresponding to annual sales of 2.5 billion
kroner this year.</p>
