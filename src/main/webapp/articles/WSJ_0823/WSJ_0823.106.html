	<p class="article-leader">CMS Energy Corp. said it agreed to jointly build a $105
million transmission line connecting its Consumers Power Co.
subsidiary with a utility subsidiary of PSI Resources Inc.
   CMS said it plans to use the transmission line to sell
electric power from its 49%-owned Midland Cogeneration
Venture, a 1,370 megawatt, gas-fired plant. CMS of Jackson,
Mich., said it will spend about $55 million for the project.
Plainfield, Ind.-based PSI Resources will contribute about
$50 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The companies will link their systems with a 345-kilovolt
transmission line between Battle Creek, Mich., and Akron,
Ind.</p>
<p>The transmission facilities are expected to be in
operation by December 1992. The project is contingent upon
regulatory approval.</p>
<p>The Midland Cogeneration Venture was designed as a nuclear
power plant but abandoned before completion in 1984. The
plant reopened on March 16 as a gas-fired plant. CMS said its
Consumers Power subsidiary purchases more than 800 megawatts
from Midland Cogeneration Venture.</p>
