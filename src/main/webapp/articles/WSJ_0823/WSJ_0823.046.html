	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Money market mutual-fund assets cracked the
$400 billion mark, a record, in the week ended Tuesday.
   Investors poured $6.5 billion into taxable money funds,
according to IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report. The influx,
the largest weekly increase since Jan. 9, swelled the assets
of the 433 funds to a total of $400.4 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Assets of tax-exempt funds also climbed to a record.
Investors put a total of $7.5 billion into 229 tax-free
funds, bringing their assets to $81.1 billion.</p>
<p>Donoghue's editor, Martha Wittbrodt, attributed the gains
to "investor nervousness and rockiness in the stock and bond
markets." She added that the assets flowing into the funds
"are coming from both retail and institutional investors."</p>
<p>Jane Ginsburg, head of marketing for Benham Capital
Management Group of Mountain View, Calif., which runs five
money market funds, said "people are worried about the Middle
East situation and don't know what to do, so they're going
for liquidity, safety and security." She said total assets of
the firm's three taxable money funds are up $109 million in
the month to date to about $4 billion.</p>
<p>Money funds, considered among the safest and most liquid
investments, invest in such instruments as short-term
Treasury securities, commercial paper (short-term corporate
IOUs), and bank certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>The inflow of money came at the same time as a slight
uptick in seven-day money fund yields, Donoghue's reported.
According to the Holliston, Mass., newsletter, the average
seven-day compound yield on taxable money funds inched up to
7.80% from 7.78%. The compound yield assumes dividends are
reinvested.</p>
<p>The average seven-day simple yield of the taxable funds
rose to 7.51% from 7.50%. But the average 30-day simple yield
eased, to 7.52% from 7.59%, and the average 30-day compound
yield slipped to 7.81% from 7.83%, the newsletter said.</p>
<p>Yields on tax-exempt funds inched up slightly. The average
seven-day compound yield of 229 tax-free funds rose to 5.26%
from 5.21%, Donoghue's reported. That's equivalent to a
taxable yield of 7.31% for an investor in the 28% tax
bracket, and 7.85% for someone paying 33% in taxes.</p>
<p>The average maturity of the investments in the portfolios
of taxable funds stayed steady at 45 days. That's within the
range of the past few months; the average maturity has been
as short as 29 days and as long as 53 days in recent years.</p>
