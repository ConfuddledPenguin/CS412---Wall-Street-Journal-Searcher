	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan will consider economic aid requests from
Persian Gulf countries that are hurt by the international
blockade of Iraq, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
   The spokesman said the policy, which he called
"unprecedented," was decided after Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak asked visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Taro
Nakayama to help Cairo offset foreign-exchange losses that
eventually could total $2 billion a year. Mr. Nakayama is on
a tour of several nations in the region.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to Egypt, Turkey and Jordan probably would be
eligible for aid, the spokesman said. Last week, Iran asked
Japan for $1.5 billion in fresh loans, but that request
wasn't directly tied to the crisis in the Gulf.</p>
<p>New money to countries in the region would take the form
of both grants and loans, the Foreign Ministry official said.</p>
<p>In addition to its pledge to provide financial aid, Japan
yesterday said it would dispatch medical and communications
equipment to Gulf countries hurt by the confrontation with
Iraq.</p>
<p>Japan, the world's second-largest importer of oil, has
been agonizing over how to respond to the Aug. 2 Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait. Although it joined in the international
boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil and froze Kuwait's financial
assets in Japan, the government considers itself
constitutionally barred from providing military assistance in
the region. Under the country's constitution, drafted by the
occupied Allied forces after World War II, Japan is prevented
from maintaining a military except for its own defense.</p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, some officials have said they
might consider revisions in the country's laws to provide
some kind of support to the multinational force in the Gulf.
But the country's political opposition, led by the Japan
Socialist Party, vehemently opposes such a move.</p>
