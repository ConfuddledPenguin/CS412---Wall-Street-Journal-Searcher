	<p class="article-leader">Gary L. McDowell's "Senate Should Put Souter to
Scholarship Test" (editorial page, Aug. 1) hits the mark on
two counts but is dead wrong on another. It's true that close
scrutiny of the nominee is appropriate and that a myopic
focus on abortion ultimately would disserve the Senate's
constitutional role of advice and consent. But the notion
that Judge David H. Souter should now face a battery of exam
questions on jurisprudence and constitutional theory is a
howler. Exam week is over; it's time to stop complaining and
read what Judge Souter has already written.
   Articles like Mr. McDowell's have repeated the claim that
Judge Souter has written "nary a word on the law" so
frequently I'm almost ready to believe it. But that would
mean ignoring the opinions published by Judge Souter during
his years on the bench. Every law student, at Harvard or
elsewhere, knows judicial opinions are primary authority.
Academic writings are merely secondary authority without
precedential weight. Also, contrary to the many articles,
there is a record, a fat one. Mastering it would require a
critical reading of Judge Souter's opinions, the statutes and
precedents on which they are based and, of somewhat lesser
importance, the briefs presented to the court. That's a lot
of homework, but an appropriate task (though less fun than
devising exam questions) for scholars who would offer
judgments on Judge Souter.</p>

<p>Mr. McDowell engages in wishful thinking if he believes
senators can act like law professors instead of politicians
in considering Judge Souter's qualifications. You can be sure
he'll be questioned on the right of privacy under the
Constitution, but it is hard to imagine one or more senators
resisting the urge to nail the abstract question of the right
of privacy to his specific views on abortion.</p>
<p>As to Mr. McDowell's concern about there being enough
evidence of Judge Souter being a scholar, anyone who lives
alone in a house full of books, who graduated from Harvard
College and Harvard Law School and who also was a Rhodes
scholar at Oxford is certainly no dummy.</p>

<p>Mr. McDowell makes some thoughtful points. Why, then, does
he choose to debase his own work with such a cheap-shot
introduction? What purpose does it serve the public debate to
compare Judge Souter with Chance, the simple-minded main
character in the book "Being There," other than to give Mr.
McDowell an opportunity to make a snide joke at the judge's
expense? Besides, Judge Souter can't be as much of an enigma
as Mr. McDowell thinks. He was confirmed by the Senate to the
appellate court within the past year. Are we to assume,
therefore, that senators "limply accepted" him without any
inquiries the first time or that their memories aren't what
they used to be?</p>

<p>Mr. McDowell began with a flourish but was a
disappointment in the end. I agree with him that the Senate
should resolve to know Judge Souter, "to know what he thinks,
to understand his conceptions of the law and judicial power."
Of course we should examine his "scholarly credentials in a
scholarly way." But I disagree that abortion must be left out
of the issue.</p>
<p>The abortion debate is more than a fleeting passion; many
people believe the abortion issue lies at the heart of
personal freedom. How dare Mr. McDowell suggest the Senate
ignore "the abortion mire" (as he calls it), and move on to
more "permanent concerns that will confront the Supreme Court
as it lopes into the next century." Abortion is as permanent
as you can get, Mr. McDowell. For many women, the abortion
option will represent the most important decision of their
lives.</p>

<p>Among the prerequisites for a Supreme Court nominee being
newly created for Judge Souter, Mr. McDowell's notion that he
must be "a scholar worthy of the Supreme Court" is Orwellian
newspeak. What was the scholarship of Earl Warren or of the
recently canonized William J. Brennan? While piously
disclaiming any idea of a messy confirmation scene over Judge
Souter's views on abortion, Mr. McDowell wants an inquiry
into his views on the "right to privacy" doctrine on which
the Roe v. Wade abortion decision was based. If ever there
was a distinction without a difference, this is it. Mr.
McDowell's injunction to the Senate to "examine this man's
scholarly credentials in a scholarly way" is either the
height of naivete or the depths of cynicism. What makes Joe
Biden, Ted Kennedy and Co. scholars?</p>
<p>Mr. McDowell's dutiful repetition of the liberal buzzword
"enigmatic" for Judge Souter gives the game away. How can a
man with a record going back over years of judicial decisions
be "enigmatic" -- with respect to his judicial
qualifications? Only his political views are unknown. Is all
this fancy talk just another way of saying that Supreme Court
nominees are to be subjected to a political litmus test -- or
that politics is or should be the basis for Supreme Court
decisions?</p>
<p>Political ideology is not judicial destiny. Oliver Wendell
Holmes was as strong a believer in laissez-faire capitalism
and social Darwinism as ever sat on the Supreme Court. Yet he
became a hero to liberals and even radicals by opposing
judicial attempts to strike down welfare-state legislation as
unconstitutional. "The 14th Amendment does not enact Mr.
Herbert Spencer's Social Statics," he said. Neither should
the Constitution be prostituted to enact anybody's ideology
today -- nor the Senate confirmation process be used to
encourage such political prostitution.</p>

<p>If this and future Senate Judiciary committees set strict
standards for judicial scholarship for the Supreme Court,
will this mean that our country will never again benefit from
the earthy wisdom of such as Hugo Black, Fred Vinson, Abe
Fortas and Thurgood Marshall?</p>
<p>Second, since I know little of scholars, is a "visiting
scholar at Harvard Law School" (Mr. McDowell's title)
equivalent to a Rhodes scholarship and a Harvard law degree
(Judge Souter's credits)?</p>
<p>Third, is it possible that the visiting Mr. McDowell is
from another planet? Otherwise, he would be well aware of the
near unanimous agreement by liberals and conservatives alike
that, after the gang job on Robert Bork, it will be a long
time before another widely known, well-documented judicial
scholar consents to such an inquisition.</p>
