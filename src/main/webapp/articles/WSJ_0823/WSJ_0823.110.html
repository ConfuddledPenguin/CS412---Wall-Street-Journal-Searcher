	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Federal regulators turned down a plan by
CrossLand Savings for meeting new capital requirements but
gave the thrift until the end of 1991 to devise a new plan.
   Under its proposal, CrossLand, the biggest thrift outside
California, would have converted $380 million in preferred
stock, which can't be counted as core capital, into common
shares, which do count toward the new capital standards. With
a 1.6% ratio of capital to assets, CrossLand falls at least
$335.6 million short of satisfying the 3% level required by
law. The conversion of the preferred into common shares would
have satisfied the 3% requirement.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>However, CrossLand, which has $12.8 billion in assets,
said that the Office of Thrift Supervision has indicated that
it wants an even higher level of capital for CrossLand
because of its relatively large exposure to commercial real
estate loans. Nonperforming assets, largely commercial real
estate loans, stood at $563 million as of June 30.</p>
<p>The OTS gave CrossLand until Dec. 31, 1991, to come up
with a new plan to meet the capital requirements.</p>
<p>Maurice Reissman, chairman, president and chief executive
officer, said that it was his understanding that the OTS
didn't object to the conversion of the preferred shares into
common but rather wanted CrossLand to raise more capital.</p>
<p>Mr. Reissman called the new deadline "an appropriate
amount of time." He added, "The game plan, candidly is to
wait until the OTS tells us the capital requirement that they
want us to meet. It is still my intent to go back to the
preferred shareholders and ask them to convert into common
equity."</p>
<p>CrossLand could meet the higher capital standards through
asset sales as well as raising new equity.</p>
<p>An earlier plan to have Chicago's Pritzker family and New
York investor Alvin Dworman invest $150 million in CrossLand
in return for 85% of its common stock was scuttled in March
because of shareholders' objections.</p>
<p>If the OTS calls for a significantly higher capital level
for CrossLand than the rest of the industry, analysts said
that the Brooklyn-based thrift faces an uphill fight, despite
its attractive consumer franchise with 82 branches in New
York, Florida, New Jersey and elsewhere. Henry Peltz, a
securities analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., said,
"They'll have a hard time. CrossLand is more or less being
kept alive by sufferance."</p>
<p>In addition, the federal Office of Thrift Supervision
imposed new restrictions on CrossLand, including directives
not to make any new loans other than residential mortgage and
consumer loans without federal permission.</p>
<p>The OTS loan restrictions won't pose a serious problem for
CrossLand, Mr. Peltz said. In the last six months, CrossLand
has shed $1.4 billion in assets and in in the past 18 months
has pared its junk bond portfolio down to $19.5 million from
$193 million.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, CrossLand posted a loss of $40
million, or $3.64 a share, after taking a $50 million special
charge for problem real estate loans.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, CrossLand closed unchanged at 87.5 cents.</p>
