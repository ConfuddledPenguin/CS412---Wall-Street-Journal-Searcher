	<p class="article-leader">The odds of Audi selling Roger Swaybill on another of its
German luxury cars looked pretty slim.
   The New York screenwriter had leased a 1985 Audi 5000 that
he says was underpowered and riddled with flaws. The hysteria
over unfounded charges that some of those same models had
raced out of control made possessing an Audi seem foolish.
Moreover, his service visits were a nightmare, and when he
tried to get out of the lease, he discovered he would lose at
least $2,000.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These days, Mr. Swaybill drives a luxury car he
enthusiastically calls "hot, powerful and exciting." But it's
no BMW, Mercedes-Benz or Lexus -- it's an Audi 200, a
successor to the star-crossed 5000.</p>
<p>"I was skeptical about giving them another chance," Mr.
Swaybill admits. "But I was overwhelmed with Audi's efforts
to keep me." His Audi dealer started by swallowing the $2,000
loss on the old lease. Then the dealer knocked several
thousand dollars off the price of the new 200 model. The car
also came with an extensive factory warranty that ensures Mr.
Swaybill will pay for little more than filling the gas tank
over the three years of his lease.</p>
<p>By lavishing this kind of attention on customers, Audi,
the luxury-car arm of Volkswagen AG, has stabilized itself
after a four-year skid that threatened its survival in the
U.S. market. Battered by the sudden-acceleration scare and
the onslaught of Japanese auto makers in the luxury market,
Audi's annual U.S. sales plunged to just 21,225 cars in 1989
from a record 74,241 four years earlier.</p>
<p>But over the past four quarters, Audi's sales have
increased from a year earlier, its longest such streak since
the mid-1980s. And through the first seven months of this
year, Audi has boosted its sales by 5.6% over the same period
a year ago, while European luxury-car sales overall in the
U.S. are off 6.9%.</p>
<p>Still, a comeback for Audi is far from certain. Sales in
July served as a sharp reminder by plunging 41.7% from July
1989. And as Mr. Swaybill's case illustrates, Audi is paying
dearly for every customer it wins.</p>
<p>Audi's marketing and rebate costs per car sold in recent
years rank among the highest in the auto industry. Last year,
the company's national advertising spending alone ran at an
estimated $3,300 a car. That's more than 10 times the
estimated $318 a car that General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac
luxury division spends annually on its national ads.</p>
<p>Then there are the huge discounts Audi is offering to make
sales. At one point during its four-year slide, the company
gave previous owners of its cars $5,000 off the price of a
new 5000 model. Now Audi, through dealer rebates, is lopping
as much as $3,000 off the price of its 100 models. That's
more than 10% off the base price.</p>
<p>Audi's much-advertised "Three-Year Test Drive" leasing
program is even more costly. The company takes off as much as
$6,000 a car to make payments on a three-year lease as low as
those for some other companies' five-year lease agreements.
The deal has proved popular enough to increase the number of
people leasing an Audi by nearly 250% over the past year.
Leases now account for more than half of the company's
overall car sales.</p>
<p>Audi has been spending big bucks for sales in other ways
as well. To get people to buy its 1988 and 1989 models, it
guaranteed the resale value of the cars after at least two
years. Audi told buyers they would get the difference between
the used price of their Audi and the average resale price of
comparable BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo models. Dealers say
customers eligible for the offer are getting refunds of $754
to $3,314 because the price of most used Audis has sunk so
low.</p>
<p>Audi officials say they see few alternatives to the
strategy of buying back consumer good will.</p>
<p>"We've had to look inward to decide if we're going to make
it and then take care to keep as many customers as we can,"
says Richard L. Mugg, the Volkswagen of America vice
president in charge of Audi's U.S. operations. He feels like
the "old high school coach who tells his team in the midst of
a losing streak that there's nothing like disappointment to
build dedication."</p>
<p>Disappointment is an understatement for what happened to
Audi. When the brand hit its peak in 1985, the aerodynamic
Audi 5000 was hailed as a styling masterpiece that even
influenced designs for the Ford Taurus, Mercury Sable and
Lincoln Continental. It helped that Audi's major rivals in
the U.S. were familiar foes it had long faced in Europe.</p>
<p>Then came the sudden-acceleration scare, which ultimately
proved baseless, but still resulted in the sales catastrophe.
While Audi was struggling to regain its strength, Japanese
auto makers were putting finishing touches on cars aimed
right at Audi and the other European luxury makes. The
top-of-the-line 32-valve Audi V8 Quattro with a 1990 base
price of $47,500, including a gas-guzzler surcharge, looks
like a bargain compared with a $63,550 Mercedes 420 SEL. But
Toyota Motor Corp.'s eight-cylinder, 32-valve Lexus LS400
costs just $40,400, even after adding in several luxury
options.</p>
<p>"With the concentration of competition at that end of the
market, it will be difficult to make a major move in market
share," says John Hammond, managing partner of J.D. Power &
Associates Inc., an Agoura Hills, Calif., market researcher.
"Audi is doing a lot of things better these days, but it's
swimming upstream."</p>
<p>Among the things Audi has improved are the quality of its
cars and customer relations. In customer satisfaction surveys
by J.D. Power, Audi did better than the industry average this
year after trailing it significantly in 1986, when
sudden-acceleration complaints began to mount. Another J.D.
Power survey this year on initial defects showed Audi making
a huge gain by jumping to 12th place from 27th in 1989.</p>
<p>Audi has worked hard with its dealers to focus more on
improving relations with customers. And it has run some
marketing campaigns highlighting safety features of its cars.</p>
<p>"Our aim," says Audi general sales manager Joseph Tate,
"is to show we're a safe buy." Establishing that notion and
easing lingering doubts about the sudden-acceleration scare
will be crucial for Audi to complete by next year. That's
when the company is scheduled to bring out an all-new
replacement for its bread-and-butter 100 and 200 models, most
of which will feature a V-6 engine instead of the current
five-cylinder power plant.</p>
<p>High hopes for the new 100s and 200s are a major reason
Audi is willing to pump so much into supporting sales now.
Still, expectations for the new models aren't so high that
Audi executives are willing to make bold predictions about
the future.</p>
<p>"We have those dreams {of getting back to 1985 sales
levels}, but here and now we have to keep looking at gradual
improvements," says Mr. Mugg. All it takes to remember the
immediate needs, he says, "is to just keep thinking about how
all we have is 0.2% of the market."</p>
