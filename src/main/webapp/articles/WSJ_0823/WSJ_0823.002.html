	<p class="article-leader">RUWEISHID, Jordan -- This bleak border post, at the edge
of no man's land between Jordan and Iraq, is an easy place to
meet the Arab Everyman in whose name Saddam Hussein wants to
wage holy war.
   Here, squatting in slivers of shade cast by desiccated
shrubs, or slumped in the back of battered sedans, are the
10,000 refugees fleeing each day from Iraq and "liberated"
Kuwait. (Iraq says it is holding hostage only those foreign
nationals in Iraq and Kuwait whose governments it considers
unfriendly; the rest may leave.)</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But, not all the traffic across the Iraq-Jordan border is
in hungry and tired workers. While King Hussein has said
Jordan will comply with United Nations sanctions against
Iraq, trucks continue to rumble from Jordan to Baghdad, most
of them loaded with corn, rice and small manufactured goods.
Coming the other way is an Iraqi trucker named Nizar. He has
delivered a load of Jordanian apricots and is returning now
for more cargo.</p>
<p>Offering a ride to a stranded American journalist, he says
in fractured English, "Very long drive. No politic. OK?"</p>
<p>The drive to Amman is indeed long, on a bumpy, two-lane
road through a featureless plain of sand and black stone.
Nizar, who says not to use his "other name or I be in trouble
in Baghdad," passes the time like truckers the world over. He
twiddles the dial on a crackly radio, honks and waves at
truckers going the other way, and stops every 45 minutes to
check his tires and add water to an overheating radiator. The
dashboard of his truck is decorated with a broken compass, a
picture of an almond-eyed Arab beauty, and a verse praising
Allah.</p>
<p>Breaking his own embargo on political chat, Nizar wonders
why America wants to stop trade to Iraq. From his wallet he
pulls well-fingered snapshots of his two little girls in
Baghdad. "You want them to be hungry?" he asks, kissing each
picture. When his passenger tries to explain the U.S.
position, Nizar shrugs.</p>
<p>"Saddam wants Arab oil for all Arabs," he says, echoing a
common view among Iraqi supporters. "George Bush wants oil
for America. Why so greedy?"</p>
<p>Nizar certainly isn't. He shares his sunflower seeds and
Pepsi, even offers his American visitor the cab to snooze in
while he lies in the shade outside to wait out the blistering
mid-afternoon heat. And letting his passenger out at sunset,
he offers a parting piece of advice. "Write in your
newspaper, Iraqi man like all other man. Only leaders want to
make war. OK?"</p>
<p>Back in Amman, rumors are rife. In the Middle East, "hard
information" is often a contradiction in terms, but facts
have become unusually rubbery in the current, highly charged
atmosphere. Among the rumors circulating in Jordan this week:
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak is dead from an assassin's
bullet, Saddam Hussein is in hiding after a failed coup, the
Saudi royal family has fled to Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>A simple question -- "Is there much food in Baghdad's
markets?" -- brings the following answers from recent
visitors to Iraq:</p>
<p>Palestinian engineer: "Everything you can dream of, they
have."</p>
<p>Egyptian laborer: "By God, the lines for bread are so long
that you cannot see the end]"</p>
<p>Iraqi Embassy official: "Why do you ask? Are you hungry?"</p>
<p>The situation -- judging from the comments of more neutral
observers -- is that Iraqis are suffering but far from
starving. There are severe shortages of rice and sugar, but
bread and most other foodstuffs appear no more scarce than in
recent months. However, there are clear signs of panic.
Refugees passing through Iraq tell of being mobbed by people
offering to buy food. Other travelers say they saw Iraqis
hoarding food and water in the backs of their cars.</p>
<p>Abbas Zaidi, a Pakistani schoolteacher from Karachi, was
on a pilgrimage to Shiite Moslem shrines in southern Iraq
when the crisis erupted. He says the population seems muted
in its support of Saddam Hussein. "Many people told me they
are scared," he says. "They know they cannot win in a war
against America." He says several people asked him for help
in getting to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein has styled himself as an Arab Robin Hood,
but what is obvious in the dusty border crossing here is that
he has robbed from the rich without sharing with the poor.</p>
<p>Iraq's Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz the other day remarked
that the U.S. should "listen to the voice of the Arab people.
There is a determined Arab nation wanting to live free."</p>
<p>As he spoke, thousands more flooded across the border,
determined to live free in some other part of the Arab
nation. So many, in fact, that yesterday Jordan ordered its
border with Iraq closed temporarily to incoming refugees so
it could properly deal with the multitudes already here.</p>
