	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian wheat stocks totaled 6,517,000 metric
tons at July 31, up 30% from 5,032,000 tons a year earlier,
Statistics Canada, a federal agency, said.
   A metric ton of wheat is equal to about 36.74 bushels. The
stocks included 700,000 metric tons on farms, down from
787,000 tons a year earlier, and 5,817,000 tons at terminals
and other commercial locations, up from 4,245,000 tons a year
earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Statistics Canada said stocks of wheat held on farms were
down from a year earlier, because of an increase in wheat
exports.</p>
<p>Stocks of barley totaled 2,049,000 metric tons, down from
2,800,000 tons a year earlier, and canola, or rapeseed,
stocks totaled 739,000 tons, down from the year-earlier
1,149,000 tons.</p>
