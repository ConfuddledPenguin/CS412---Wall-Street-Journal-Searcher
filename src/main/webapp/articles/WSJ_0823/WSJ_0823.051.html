	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- KPMG Peat Marwick, a major accounting and
consulting firm, said it will open an office in the Soviet
Union in the fall, as part of its expansion into Central and
Eastern Europe.
   Larry D. Horner, KPMG's chairman, said the Soviet office
will focus initially on counseling U.S. businesses about
opportunities in the U.S.S.R. Eventually, the company said,
it hopes to form a joint venture to provide tax and auditing
services.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The KPMG move follows similar ventures by other U.S.
accounting firms in the Soviet Union. Last June, Arthur
Andersen & Co. and Ernst & Young formed ventures with Soviet
firms that allowed the companies to perform official audits
of U.S.-Soviet businesses.</p>
