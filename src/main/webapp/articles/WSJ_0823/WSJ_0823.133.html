	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock prices dove in late trading on a spike
in crude oil futures, while a report that Iraq claimed its
airspace had been invaded added to the selling.
   The report from the Middle East, taken from Iraq's
official news agency, was unconfirmed by Western sources. But
the news hit a market already jittery from the rise in crude
oil futures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at its low for the
day at 2560.15, down 43.81.</p>
<p>The broader market also fell. Standard & Poor's 500-Stock
Index slid 5.31 to 316.55, the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index lost 2.72 to 174.22 and the Dow Jones Equity
Market Index tumbled 4.92 to 293.10.</p>
<p>Declining issues swamped advancers, 1,202 to 360, with 426
stocks unchanged. New York Stock Exchange volume eased to
175,550,000 shares from Tuesday's 194,630,000 shares.</p>
<p>Stock prices surged at the opening, pushing the Dow Jones
average up about 17 points within the first half hour of
trading. But the gains quickly evaporated as crude oil
futures rose through the morning.</p>
<p>The average drifted lower through the afternoon, finally
ending in a flurry of selling as October crude oil futures
rose to their highest levels since 1985, closing at $31.22 a
barrel, up $2.51. Traders say computer-driven sell programs
contributed to the final sharp drop at the end of the day.</p>
<p>"The market is adjusting to a new world," says Edward J.
Shopkorn, director of equity services at Mabon Nugent. He
says the market had adjusted to oil prices in the mid-$20
range, but now is dropping again as oil prices rise above $30
a barrel.</p>
<p>Mr. Shopkorn noted that a surge in the price of the
various Nikkei 225-Stock Index put warrants trading on the
American Stock Exchange yesterday means traders are expecting
the selling to carry over to the Japanese market.</p>
<p>The put warrants rise in price as the Tokyo Stock Exchange
bellwether index falls, and a surge in the warrants often
anticipates selling in Japanese stocks overnight.</p>
<p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues fell 1086.93 points to
25210.91 yesterday. A further drop in overseas stock markets
could add pressure to stocks in the U.S., traders say.</p>
<p>Dale Tills, head of institutional trading at Charles
Schwab, says traders are getting nervous as the industrial
average approaches a key support level at around the 2550
level. "As we get closer and closer to this support, it gets
very dangerous," he says.</p>
<p>He adds that if the Dow Jones industrial average falls
below the support level, it will have broken an upward trend
that has been in place for about six years.</p>
<p>"If we do break that support, it could mean 2,200 on the
Dow {industrials}," Mr. Tills says. "That's got a lot of
people nervous."</p>
<p>But Harold MacKinney Jr., head of the investment policy
committee at Fleet National Bank, remains hopeful that a
resolution to the Mideast crisis will save the market from
further losses.</p>
<p>He says the market's bottom is more likely to be 2500. And
the Dow Jones industrials could jump 100 points in a day on
any positive news, he says.</p>
<p>"I think if we resolve the {Mideast} problem effectively,
this thing is off and running and next year we could see the
market above 3000," Mr. MacKinney says.</p>
<p>Some oilfield equipment stocks were lower, after having
risen sharply following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Dresser
Industries lost 3 1/4 to 46 1/2, Halliburton was off 1 3/4 to
53 1/2, and Schlumberger was down 1 3/8 to 63 1/4.</p>
<p>Caesars World fell 1 7/8 to 11 7/8, adding to its 7/8
point loss on Tuesday. The casino operator reported fiscal
fourth quarter profit fell to 31 cents a share, less than
half of what it earned in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>But not all stocks fell.</p>
<p>MGM/UA Communications added 3/8 to 13 1/4. The company
said it received checks totalling $50 million from Pathe
Communications as the latest of a series of payments toward
Pathe's $1.3 billion acquisition of MGM/UA. The acquisition
pact calls for MGM/UA shareholders to receive a total of
$21.50 a share, including a $4-a-share payment that was
distributed on July 20. Payment of the remaining $17.50 a
share is set to occur before Oct. 23.</p>
<p>National Intergroup gained 1 1/2 to 16 1/8. The company
said it is seeking buyers for itself and its Foxmeyer drug
distribution unit as part of an accord reached with dissident
shareholder Centaur Partners.</p>
<p>Wilcox & Gibbs added 3/8 to 6 7/8. The company said it
would buy back up to one million of its 13.8 million common
shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Computer Associates added 1/4 to 7 1/8. On Monday, the
company said it would buy back up to 15 million of its 187
million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Care finished unchanged at 2 1/8. A
dissident shareholder group has apparently succeeded in
removing the companies current directors.</p>
<p>USAir Group was off 1 3/4 to 15 1/8. The company said it
will fire about 1,500 probationary employees in the next few
days as part of the company's program to constrain expansion
and to reduce costs. The company also said it would delay a
planned fare increase.</p>
<p>Dreyfus fell 2 1/8 to 27 1/4 in heavy trading. The company
said it will continue to waive its management fee for the
world-wide dollar money market fund until June 30, 1991.
Dreyfus has waived the fee since the fund was created. The
waiver was set to expire on Sept. 30. The normal fee on a
money market fund is about 50 basis points, or 0.5%, of the
fund's assets. Dreyfus's world-wide dollar money market fund
currently has about $8.6 billion invested.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index lost 2.95
to 324.39. Volume totaled 16,570,000 shares.</p>
<p>On the American exchange, CSS Industries edged up 1/4
point to 16 1/2 after the company said it would repurchase up
to 100,000 of its 5.2 million common shares.</p>
