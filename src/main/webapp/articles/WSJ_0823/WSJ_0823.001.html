	<p class="article-leader">Thirty-dollar oil is back.
   Mounting war scares drove futures prices of crude in
London and New York beyond $30 a barrel -- the highest level
for the North Sea Brent and the U.S. West Texas Intermediate
since 1985. Some oil prices reached as high as $40 a barrel
in the early 1980s.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On London's International Petroleum Exchange, Brent crude
for October delivery broke through the psychologically
important level only moments before the close and then
settled $2.56 a barrel higher at $30.19. In the U.S. futures
market, October crude traded above $30 by early afternoon and
ended at $31.22 a barrel, up $2.51.</p>
<p>Fuel prices also leaped in frantic futures trading. On the
New York Mercantile Exchange, September heating oil jumped
7.64 cents to pass 91 cents a gallon. Motor fuel wasn't far
behind. Unleaded gasoline for September delivery rose 2.85
cents to $1.04 a gallon.</p>
<p>The petroleum-price surge helped drive down stock and bond
prices in U.S. markets.</p>
<p>Growing Middle East tensions contributed to both
developments, with the oil-price climb being accelerated by
news that Saudi Arabia's exports of refined products may be
drying up because the fuels are needed by military forces
within its borders.</p>
<p>Before European and U.S. markets opened, Japanese
customers of Saudi Arabia reported they had been notified
that deliveries of so-called middle distillates, which
include fuels such as kerosene and diesel oil, will be
suspended for September. That led to the run-up in European
and U.S. markets in prices of heating oil, which is closely
related to diesel fuel and other middle distillates.</p>
<p>Oil industry officials confirmed that supplies of some
petroleum products are beginning to tighten in some areas of
the world, particularly in such countries as Pakistan, which
formerly depended on fuels from the now-closed refineries of
Kuwait. This is due in part to the fact that the U.S.
military is seeking additional jet and diesel fuels in the
Persian Gulf region. Also, some oil-producing countries are
beginning to stockpile some of the fuels their refineries
produce in case of eventual domestic needs.</p>
<p>Overall, Saudi Arabia's reduction in product exports isn't
expected to have a big world-wide impact, however. Saudi oil
officials said that the cuts probably will be limited and
that crude-oil exports aren't affected.</p>
<p>The kingdom's main petroleum exports are crude oil, not
fuels. Also, industry officials said that even though there
may be some dislocation of destinations for some Saudi
petroleum products, the overall volumes of fuels to be
processed remain the same.</p>
<p>There were new indications, meanwhile, that Saudi Arabia's
total exports will be increased in the next few days in line
with its prior commitment to produce more to help offset the
losses to world markets of four million barrels a day of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crudes.</p>
<p>"What the markets may be ignoring is that the Saudis have
followed through" on their plan to sell more crude to their
customers, said Marshall Thomas, editor in chief of the Oil
Daily. Mr. Thomas, an oil-marketing expert, said that in the
past few days the Saudis have responded to customer requests
for more oil. "This oil can be available starting in four or
five days," he said.</p>
<p>Hisham Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, officially confirmed
last Saturday that the kingdom would produce as much as two
million barrels a day more than its OPEC quota to help
stabilize oil markets. Such a step would be taken with or
without the approval of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, Mr. Nazer said.</p>
<p>Venezuela also is understood to be increasing its
production now after waffling over whether it would act
without OPEC's approval in providing as much as a promised
500,000 barrels a day in additional oil to world supplies.
But both Venezuela and Saudi Arabia still hope for some
endorsement of their plans from others in OPEC.</p>
<p>Yesterday, some OPEC sources suggested that the oil
ministers of at least six countries -- Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela, Algeria, Indonesia, Iran and Nigeria -- might meet
as soon as Sunday to consider the oil supply situation.</p>
<p>Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and president of
OPEC, is understood to be sending letters to each of the
others suggesting the meeting. But late yesterday an official
of the Saudi petroleum ministry said such a letter hadn't yet
been received.</p>
<p>In Caracas, Celestino Armas, Venezuela's oil minister,
told reporters that OPEC "will possibly hold a consultation
meeting" in Vienna on Sunday to discuss a temporary
re-distribution of oil quotas. He said such a meeting would
be attended by "all 13 members" but didn't clarify how
Kuwait, currently occupied by Iraq, would be represented.</p>
