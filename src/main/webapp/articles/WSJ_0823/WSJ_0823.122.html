	<p class="article-leader">Worthen Banking Corp. said it signed a non-binding letter
of intent to acquire all preferred and common stock
outstanding of TC Bankshares Inc. and all preferred and about
98% of the common stock of Twin City Bank, a TC Bankshares
unit.
   The bank holding company said completion of the
transaction is subject to the parties reaching a definitive
agreement, approval by the Federal Reserve Board and Worthen
shareholders. Worthen also must obtain the necessary
financing. Worthen said it is considering a capital offering
in connection with the proposed transaction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If all necessary approvals are met, Worthen, based in
Little Rock, Ark., said it expects closing on or before Dec.
31. Worthen said the acquisition price would depend upon the
earnings of Twin City and TC Bankshares, both Arkansas-based
banking concerns, but will not exceed $75 million if closing
occurs by Dec. 31. If the closing occurs after that date, the
purchase price could exceed $75 million, depending on the two
firms' earnings, Worthen said.</p>
