	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- High-yield currencies benefited from a dearth
of dollar-moving news yesterday, depressing the U.S. unit
across the board.
   Backed by high domestic interest rates, the British pound
briefly surpassed $1.93 and remained at its highest level
against the dollar in nine years. Sterling rose to $1.9240
late yesterday from $1.9115 late Tuesday. It peaked at
$1.9305 just before noon in New York.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dollar was quoted late in New York at 1.5590 marks,
down from 1.5645 marks a day earlier. The U.S. currency was
also changing hands at 146.30 yen, down from 146.65 yen in
New York late Tuesday.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar was quoted
at 146 yen, down from 146.92 yen at the close there
Wednesday. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.5595
marks, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 1.5630 marks.</p>
<p>In trading Wednesday, the Canadian dollar was lifted above
88 U.S. cents for the first time in 12 years. The Australian
and New Zealand dollars were also well bid throughout
trading.</p>
<p>Leading foreign exchange dealings, however, was the Swiss
franc. The dollar fell to within a Swiss centime of its low
of 1.2675 francs set more than 2 1/2 years ago. The dollar
ended New York dealings at 1.2780 Swiss francs, down from
1.2917 francs late Tuesday.</p>
<p>Though interest rates supporting the Swiss franc are the
lowest among highyield currencies, the economy of Switzerland
is more robust than that of Britain or Canada and more
predictable than that of Australia or New Zealand, commented
Gilbert Benz, a Swiss Bank economist in New York.</p>
<p>And inflation, which eats away at real investment returns,
is more amenable to central bank control in Switzerland than
in those other four countries, Mr. Benz said. Swiss inflation
has stayed under the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development average for the past five years.</p>
<p>Stacked against the dollar, Mr. Benz said, all five
high-yield currencies come out ahead. U.S. interest rates are
based under 8%, compared with 15% in the U.K., 14% in
Australia and New Zealand, 13% in Canada and 10% in
Switzerland. With the U.S. seemingly near a recession,
financial markets expect easier money there, despite
continued price pressures.</p>
<p>"There's nothing hidden in the agenda of investors," Mr.
Benz said. "People have already gotten burned thinking the
{U.S. Federal Reserve Board} wouldn't ease in the face of
inflation." Last month, the U.S. central bank allowed
interbank interest rates to decline a quarter of a percentage
point.</p>
<p>Dollar-centered dealings were indecisive. The market could
neither buy the dollar on Persian Gulf violence nor sell it
on new indications of U.S. economic weakness. In the void,
the currency drifted lower on the market's bearish opinion of
it, until traders chose to square up, buying back dollars.
During the recent weeks of military tension, most dealers
have refused to go home with oversold dollar positions.</p>
<p>"Everyone is short, short, short. The long-term players
don't care. They'll sell and go home, but the day traders
square up before going home, so the first guy that decides to
bail out beats everyone to the punch. Then there is a mad
scramble," said Robert Ryan, Bank of New York's foreign
exchange manager, describing what has become a typical end to
recent currency trading sessions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the dollar's general rebound occurred when it
struck technical support at its intraday low of 1.2710 Swiss
francs, Mr. Ryan said.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar rose to 88.08 U.S. cents from 87.73
cents previously, marking the first time it was above 88 U.S.
cents since Aug. 11, 1978.</p>
<p>"The Canadian dollar is basically negating any type of
economic fundamentals," said Diego Giurleo, corporate foreign
exchange manager in New York for Royal Bank of Canada. While
the Canadian economy is seemingly following that of its
neighbor to the south, he said, the Canadian unit is a
"darling" because of the returns of Canadian securities.</p>
<p>He noted that even the recent half-percentage point
reduction in the spread between yields of Canadian government
paper and similar U.S. bills has failed to dent interest in
the Canadian dollar. The spread is currently about five
percentage points, compared with 5 1/2 points last week.</p>
<p>The Australian dollar ended in New York at 82.03 U.S.
cents, above 81.45 cents Tuesday, after reaching a high of
82.24 cents in North American trading.</p>
<p>On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current
delivery settled at $411 an ounce, up $3.60. Estimated volume
was a moderate four million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Thursday, gold was quoted at
$413.75 an ounce.</p>
