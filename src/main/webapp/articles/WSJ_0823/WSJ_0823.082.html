	<p class="article-leader">Video cameras are changing the way things look in the
courtroom.
   Private investigators, equipped with compact video gear,
are being hired more often to spy on people who have filed
personal-injury lawsuits or workers' compensation claims.
Defense lawyers for insurance companies and their
policyholders are looking for taped evidence that can
discredit claims of injury, pain and suffering. Though judges
and juries sometimes frown on the technique, the impact,
plaintiffs' lawyers say, can be devastating.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's almost impossible to take away the sting of a
videotape," says T.J. Hallinan, a Lincoln, Neb., lawyer who
has felt the impact of videotapes in a courtroom. In
February, the Nebraska Supreme Court upheld a lower court
decision awarding only partial disability payments to one of
Mr. Hallinan's clients, a truck driver who claimed he could
no longer drive his tractor-trailer because of a back injury.</p>
<p>The lower court disregarded the testimony of doctors
supporting the claim when it saw a videotape of Mr.
Hallinan's client test-starting lawn mowers at a yard sale,
loading furniture into a truck and engaging in horseplay with
his children.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' lawyers have long used videotape to document
their clients' injuries. On the other side, surveillance to
expose fraudulent or exaggerated personal-injury claims isn't
new; insurance companies and their lawyers have long employed
private investigators to check on plaintiffs and testify at
trial. But the advent of small, inexpensive camcorders and an
increase in fraudulent claims and damage awards have made
attorneys for insurance companies much more willing to
consider video surveillance.</p>
<p>"Five or 10 years ago, there wasn't so much {taping}," Mr.
Hallinan says. "But now, if the situation justifies it, if
the cost justifies it, you can just about bet there's a
videotape out there."</p>
<p>The increase in surveillance has spurred a flurry of state
court opinions governing just how the tapes can be used at
trial, the extent to which judges and juries should rely on
them and at what point taping constitutes an invasion of
privacy.</p>
<p>Judges have been hesitant to give surveillance videotapes
more weight than medical testimony. Generally, they allow the
use of tapes in trials only to impeach or refute specific
testimony about an injury. Plaintiffs' lawyers complain that
tapes can be selectively filmed and edited. Even insurance
industry specialists recognize the potential for abuse.</p>
<p>"One of the problems you have with this is how do you
address a humongous problem -- that is, insurance fraud --
and how to preserve people's rights," says Richard D. Rogers,
deputy director of the Illinois Department of Insurance and a
member of the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners. "That is a line that we will have to walk."</p>
<p>The tapes can be particularly useful in
difficult-to-diagnose cases where medical specialists
disagree on a disability, such as with a back injury. They
are considered to be especially handy in workers'
compensation hearings, which are held to determine the extent
of a worker's job-related disability and the amount his
company or its insurer should pay in benefits.</p>
<p>Unlike personal-injury suits, where liability is a factor,
workers' compensation hearings usually turn on two issues:
whether the injury occurred, and how disabling it is. When
medical evidence is conflicting or inconclusive, the central
issue becomes the credibility of the claimant. That's where
surveillance tapes come in.</p>
<p>"In workers' compensation, it's the only thing between
winning and losing a case," says Denis Paul Juge, an
insurance defense lawyer at Sutherland, Juge, Horack & Dwyer
in New Orleans and an adjunct law professor at Loyola
University.</p>
<p>In one case, a New Orleans restaurant worker broke down
and wept while testifying two years ago at his worker's
compensation hearing that he could no longer tend his garden
because of a disabling back injury. The judge stopped the
trial and handed him a tissue, recalls Mr. Juge, who
represented the Louisiana Restaurant Association, which
insured the worker's employer. But the judge's sympathy
dissolved after he watched a two-hour tape of the plaintiff
shoveling fertilizer from his truck. The case was quickly
settled out of court; terms weren't disclosed.</p>
<p>Many plaintiffs' lawyers, however, question the fairness
of video surveillance. They argue that the technique can be
deceiving. "The problem with the tapes is that they give no
indication of what happened after the filming," says Mr.
Hallinan, the Nebraska lawyer whose client was taped starting
lawn mowers. Injured plaintiffs have good days and bad days
and may look healthy because of medication they are taking,
he argues. Mr. Hallinan's client, he says, was taking muscle
relaxants when he was videotaped.</p>
<p>In such cases, plaintiffs' lawyers say, the use of video
can backfire if a jury senses that only selected films are
being shown. In the case of Dan Ryan, a Chicago construction
worker who sued his employer after injuring his back when a
wall collapsed around him at a job site, investigators for
the company's insurer filmed him for several days. The jury
saw a three-hour tape that showed Mr. Ryan climbing
scaffolding at another job site. But what the jury didn't
see, says Mr. Ryan's lawyer, Chicago plaintiffs' attorney
Joseph Curcio, was Mr. Ryan being carried back down. When it
came out at the trial that Mr. Ryan had been selectively
filmed, says Mr. Curcio, the jury awarded him $1.3 million in
damages.</p>
<p>Judges also tend to be suspicious of surveillance, says
Mr. Juge, the New Orleans insurance defense lawyer. Any
inconsistency between medical testimony during a trial and
video-taped evidence is usually decided in favor of the
testimony, Mr. Juge says. Even if medical testimony is
unreliable, judges have been reluctant to rely solely on
tapes.</p>
<p>Much of the controversy over surveillance concerns
improper investigative techniques and how the tapes can be
used at trial. Courts in many states are just beginning to
deal with the issue of whether plaintiffs should be allowed
to view the tapes before trial to examine their authenticity
and potentially prejudicial effect. In the past year, courts
in Louisiana, Hawaii and New York have ruled that all secret
surveillance must be included in the routine pretrial
exchange of evidence.</p>
<p>But how to deal with fraudulent investigative techniques
isn't an easy issue. There are no insurance industry
guidelines regulating how far private investigators can go
when gathering incriminating evidence, and company standards
vary.</p>
<p>Guidance from judges has been ambiguous. Many judges agree
that society's interest in exposing fraudulent insurance
claims outweighs individual expectations of privacy.
Plaintiffs in injury cases can expect "reasonable inquiry and
investigation of their claims," says Mr. Juge. This standard
gives investigators wide latitude.</p>
<p>A Qick Mart convenience store in Chicago was sued after an
elderly customer, a scrap metal collector, slipped and broke
his hip. Maryland Casualty Co., the store's insurer, hired
the private investigation firm Wallrab, Capenigro &
Associates Inc.</p>
<p>In May, an investigator posing as a scrap dealer knocked
on the door of the man's second-floor apartment and offered
him a pile of metal outside if he would pick it up. A van
parked nearby was ready with a camera, but the plaintiff, his
hands shaking and able to walk only with a cane, turned down
the offer.</p>
<p>"The conversation ended shortly thereafter without
plaintiff taking the bait," investigator William Wallrab
wrote in a report to Maryland Casualty. The case hasn't gone
to trial yet. The company and investigators won't comment,
but other investigators and defense lawyers say such tactics
can easily alienate a jury.</p>
<p>David Cooney, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., defense lawyer,
says he only allows investigators to film in public places
and prohibits all contact with plaintiffs. Mr. Cooney,
representing North River Insurance Co., discredited a
personal-injury claimant in 1987 by having him secretly
filmed during a weekend recess in his trial. In the
courtroom, the claimant had used an orthopedic pillow and
cane and groaned audibly. But when he was taped walking out
of his house to pick up a newspaper and leaving a restaurant,
the cane was nowhere in sight. The camera also caught the
claimant getting into his car to drive to the courthouse. The
cane and pillow were already in the car.</p>
<p>In general, though, surveillance faces greater scrutiny
these days. "It used to be condoned behavior to let air out
of tires and trash lawns to get {plaintiffs} to do physical
work," says James Kithas, a private investigator in Fort
Worth, Texas. But now plaintiffs sue for bad faith over such
conduct, defense and plaintiffs lawyers say, and juries tend
to look askance at the use of secret video surveillance.</p>
<p>Even tapes that are legitimately produced "can come back
to haunt you," says Robert Frye, a defense lawyer at Shannon
Gracey, in Fort Worth. "They can argue that not only did you
deny the claim, but you're spying on them as well. It can
really make you out like the bad guy."</p>
