	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Rep. Newt Gingrich, the second-ranking House
Republican, further complicated deficit-reduction talks by
calling for tax cuts rather than tax increases.
   The Georgian, who is a budget summit negotiator, said
yesterday that he is putting together a package of tax cuts
that will include a reduction in the rate on capital gains
and, perhaps, a cut in the Social Security payroll tax. The
aim is to stimulate the economy at a time when it appears on
the verge of recession, he said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Previously, Rep. Gingrich had expressed more willingness
to increase taxes to help reduce the budget deficit. A
spokesman said, "He is still in favor of the summit process
and reaching the targets."</p>
<p>Still, his latest statement is yet another reminder that
Mr. Gingrich and the House Republicans he represents are
stalwarts against a tax increase. That position is yet
another obstacle to reaching a fiscal 1991 budget accord,
which would include tax increases and spending restraints.</p>
