	<p class="article-leader">BUSH CALLED UP reservists to bolster the military buildup
in the Persian Gulf.
   The president wouldn't say how many reservists will be
activated, but a call-up of 40,000 is likely. He also said
the U.S. may wait a few days before ordering ships to stop
more vessels carrying Iraqi goods, and implied the Soviets
want the U.N. to be given more time to approve military
action for enforcing trade sanctions. In Moscow, officials
said Soviet military consultants are still training Iraqi
soldiers. Meanwhile, Baghdad claimed that planes flying in
from Saudi Arabia penetrated Iraqi airspace, but it was
unclear if the alleged incursion was into Iraq or Kuwait. A
Japanese Foreign Ministry official said Tokyo will consider
aid requests from Persian Gulf countries hurt by the
international blockade of Iraq.</p>

<p>EAST GERMANY'S PARLIAMENT SET Oct. 3 as the date for
unification.</p>
<p>After a tense late-night emergency session, the lawmakers
found the requisite two-thirds majority in the 400-seat
Volkskammer to fix the date for unity with West Germany. The
294-62 vote ended weeks of bickering that has split the
country's coalition government. "This is a truly historical
event," Parliament President Bergmann-Pohl said.</p>
<p>The date for German unification is entirely up to East
Germany and the Volkskammer's decision requires no
ratification from Bonn.</p>

<p>The death toll rose to over 500 in 10 days of street
clashes in South African black townships near Johannesburg,
police said, as the violence spread to Vosloorus and Kagiso
townships. The fighting pits Zulus loyal to the conservative
Inkatha movement against Xhosas, most of them supporters of
the African National Congress.</p>

<p>A U.S. district court judge was convicted of two
corruption charges, disclosing a wiretap to an ex-mobster and
lying to the FBI in order to obstruct a grand jury probe. The
judge, Robert Aguilar of San Jose, Calif., faces probable
impeachment and removal from office by Congress if either
count is upheld on appeal.</p>

<p>Soviet troops expelled hundreds of Armenian guerrilla
fighters from a border region of the neighboring republic of
Azerbaijan, where they had been attacking villages and
battling soldiers sent by Moscow to intervene in a two-year
conflict over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>

<p>An ex-Thornburgh aide pleaded innocent to drug-related
charges resulting from a probe of alleged drug use by
officials. Henry Barr, who was a special assistant to the
U.S. attorney general, is apparently the highest-ranking
present or former federal official to face drug charges,
according to the prosecutor handling the Pennsylvania case.</p>

<p>The Philippine army brought an extra battalion into Manila
to bolster government forces as a series of bombings
increased fears of a coup attempt against Aquino. Three bombs
rocked the capital Tuesday night and early yesterday.</p>

<p>NASA engineers lost touch with the Venus-orbiting Magellan
spacecraft for the second time in five days, but later
restored steady radio contact. The latest problem in the $744
million mission to map Venus came less than eight hours after
officials released Magellan's first pictures of the planet.</p>

<p>Colombian police said they arrested the Medellin cocaine
cartel's head of assassins. The suspect, Humberto de Jesus

gunmen who are paid to kill enemies of the drug traffickers.</p>

<p>Britain called for frequent, short-notice inspections of
nuclear installations worldwide. The proposal was made at a
Geneva meeting of delegates from over 100 nations who are
reviewing the 20-year-old Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>

<p>A U.S. policy shift has drawn China into Cambodian peace
efforts, Vietnam's vice minister of foreign affairs, Tran
Quang Co, said. The American decision to drop support for
guerrillas fighting the Phnom Penh regime has isolated China,
which backs the Khmer Rouge rebels, he said, prompting
discussions between Beijing and Hanoi.</p>

<p>Sri Lankan troops landed on rebel-held Jaffna Peninsula by
ship and began advancing on a government fort under siege by
the insurgents for the past 10 weeks, officials said. Jaffna
is the headquarters of the main Tamil rebel group fighting
for independence from the ethnic Sinhalese-dominated
government in the Indian Ocean island.</p>
