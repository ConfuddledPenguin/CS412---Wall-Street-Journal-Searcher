	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT -- West Germany's auto production fell 1% in
July from a year earlier because of fewer workdays, according
to the West German Automobile Association.
   But adjusted for the calendar, production actually climbed
6% in July from the previous year, the association added.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A total of 295,400 cars were produced in July compared
with 297,165 the previous year. But there were only 15
working days in July this year, down from 16 in 1989. Most
West German auto factories close for a number of weeks in the
summer for vacations and plant maintenance.</p>
