	<p class="article-leader">American President Companies Ltd., Oakland, Calif., said
it plans a cost-cutting and reorganization effort that will
lead to layoffs and write-downs before the end of 1990.
   The transportation and shipping concern said it didn't yet
know how many layoffs there would be or how the write-downs
might affect its financial results, which already are down
this year because of broad problems in the shipping business.
American President had 4,994 employees at year end.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said the process will take place in two
phases, with the first focusing on eliminating "non-essential
positions" and streamlining corporate organization. The
second phase of the program, which will last through 1991,
will focus on increasing efficiency through investments in
new equipment, better training programs and other methods.</p>
<p>A spokesman said the moves were in response to the
company's "poor" earnings performance in 1989 and so far this
year. The company has been hurt by a slowdown in the general
economy and by higher fuel prices, a problem that will only
worsen with the current turmoil in the Middle East.</p>
<p>For the six months, American President had a loss of $1
million, or 22 cents a share, on revenue of $1.1 billion.</p>
