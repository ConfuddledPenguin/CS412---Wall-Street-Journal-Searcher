	<p class="article-leader">DAF N.V., hurt by its heavy dependence on the weak British
truck market, reported a loss of 32.1 million guilders ($18
million) for the first half.
   The loss, which was expected, compares with net income of
74.5 million guilders a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>For the full year, the Eindhoven-based truck maker said it
expects to record a "small" net income "provided that
negative general economic developments do not prevail."
Nonetheless, some London stockbrokers said they were sticking
with forecasts that DAF will have a loss for the year. John
Longhurst of James Capel & Co. forecast a loss of 60 million
guilders, while Stephen Reitman of UBS Phillips & Drew
projected a 50 million guilder deficit.</p>
<p>The company's troubles have prompted some analysts to
question whether it will be able to remain independent. DAF
said it is continuing to study possible joint ventures or
other cooperation projects with various possible partners in
Europe and the U.S., including Navistar International Corp. A
spokesman noted that DAF already cooperates with other
manufacturers in some areas; for instance, the company is
developing delivery vans jointly with Renault.</p>
