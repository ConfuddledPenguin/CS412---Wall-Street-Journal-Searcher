	<p class="article-leader">San Francisco -- The Museum of Modern Art recently
established a separate Department of Architecture and Design.
This summer, curator Paolo Polledri opened the department's
most ambitious project so far -- a dubious, slightly
incoherent assemblage called "Visionary San Francisco," on
view through Sunday. For this, he collected scores of images
of the city's supposedly heroic/romantic past and its
contentious, unheroic present, then added a few disconcerting
visions of its future.
   The visitor begins in a series of cramped spaces, on the
walls of which are hung drawings, plans and photographs of
historical "visions" for the Bay Area, a few of which
actually got built. These include two university campuses,
two world's fairs, two bridges, a grandiose 1904 master plan
for the city (which was never realized) and some freeway and
redevelopment schemes of the 1950s (many of which,
unfortunately, were).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This zigzagging trail ends up in two rooms full of
confusing drawings and models for "Yerba Buena Center," a
monument to the chaos of contemporary urban politics and real
estate finance. Twenty-three years after buildings were
demolished and residents evacuated for this dream project
just south of Market Street, the site is still mostly empty,
still a dream, still a project. The latest in a long chain of
developers (Olympia & York) and designers now promises to
fill up the remaining hole by 1999. I doubt that the result,
if I live to see it, will have the Tivoli Garden charm seen
in some of the architect Lawrence Halprin's ubiquitous
doodles.</p>
<p>The visitor then backtracks through a roomful of publicity
for the 195-acre dream plan of another current developer
(Santa Fe Realty) and into the museum's neoclassical rotunda.
Here are displayed works newly commissioned from four artists
(or pairs of artists), each supposedly related to four
written texts also commissioned for the occasion by Mr.
Polledri. The texts, and the corresponding artworks, were
intended to have something to do with "future visions" of San
Francisco, but only one set of them really does.</p>
<p>Writer William Gibson created a "Blade Runner"-like
dystopia in which poor people of the future live in
ramshackle shelters growing like barnacles over a ruined Bay
Bridge; Oakland apparently was somehow destroyed. His grisly
little tale of San Francisco-to-come is effectively
illustrated by Piranesian sketches of the decaying, inhabited
bridge, and two electronic, diagrammatic models in long,
glass-covered metal boxes by Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts of
Santa Monica.</p>
<p>The artists have elaborated on Mr. Gibson's text, by
imagining that Japanese corporations and other ruling powers
have walled off separate precincts of the city (including
Golden Gate Park, a Shopper's Haven, and a Presidio theme
park) for the embattled middle class.</p>
<p>The other three texts -- a neo-Ruskinian screed against
the post-medieval world and in favor of Beauty; an
overwrought essay/memoir on the local gay scene and
sensibility; and a stock detective story set in Hispanic San
Francisco -- all are second-rate stuff. (Even so, you have to
buy the $30 catalog to read them.) The paired works of art
are, respectively, unrelated to the text, hard to decipher,
and just plain awful. All of them look embarrassingly out of
place in a proud space accustomed to housing more serious
art.</p>
<p>The catalog does contain useful historical essays on the
planning of San Francisco, and reproductions of many of the
best things in the show. The most memorable things in it for
me were those two big sci-fi pinball machines in the rotunda;
some shamefully romantic renderings of the 1915 fair by Jules
Guerin; Don Potts's large-scale wooden models of the City
Hall dome (sliced in half) and one Golden Gate Bridge tower;
and a telling set of 1940 "Before" and "After" sketches by
architect Vernon DeMars. After 50 years, he is still fighting
City Hall -- showing how "modern architecture" is going to
improve urban life. To postmodern eyes, his messy, unruly
"Before" drawings may well look more appealing than his
tidied-up, rationalized "Afters."</p>
<p>A healthy contrast to the SFMMA show was the installation
of 25 works by Detroit-born, Europe-based artist James Lee
Byars earlier this season, to which were devoted all 9,000
square feet of the open lower galleries of the University Art
Museum in Berkeley. This museum is a sort of smaller,
cubistic, New Brutalist Guggenheim, formed of cast-concrete
galleries that ascend around in a jagged series of open
terraces, the ends of which overlook the spacious and
light-flooded lower levels.</p>
<p>At the Byars exhibition called "The Perfect Thought," one
could not actually come near to his dreamlike "room" of
hieratic gold and marble objects. Impeccably arranged atop a
42-foot-diameter gold-leafed circle on the floor, they had to
be viewed from the parapets of the galleries above, which
heightened the sense of their unworldly "perfection" -- a
favorite word, and perverse goal of this mysterious, witty
and unclassifiable artist.</p>
<p>After a world-wandering life spent doing giant folded
paper sculptures and staging cryptic performances in public
places (all described in the elegant catalog), Mr. Byars,
born in 1932, semi-settled in Venice 10 years ago and began
making, and occasionally finding, compellingly symbolic
spheres, rings, columns and other pure shapes of wood, stone,
marble or bronze (often gilded), ranging from a one-inch gold
sphere (kept under a glass bell-case) to a column of basalt
blocks 23 feet high.</p>
<p>Arranged atop the gold-leaf disc (a smaller gold disc was
hammered onto the floor of an adjacent empty gallery), along
with three pieces of antique furniture and an alienating set
of black psychiatrist couches, they form a kind of exquisite
room once inhabited by or designed for creatures like us, but
somehow better. A colossal gilded 19th-century amphora, about
10-feet high, lies tipped on its side; a precise row of six
glass cases contains each a pure geometrical shape, carved in
white marble.</p>
<p>The whole arrangement looked so eerily near to perfection
that one felt as if the museum had grown up around it, like a
bumptious modern church designed to house a holy relic. (Mr.
Byars always orchestrates his own installations, often
dictating to galleries and museums his own outrageous terms
("Close off the doors and windows] Paint all the walls
red]"). One could stare at each object from a great many
angles, admiring the artist's finesse, dazzled by his Louise
Nevelson palette (gold, black and white) and his semi-sacred
shapes.</p>
<p>But it was the suite of objects as a whole that led me to
imagine a lost civilization discovered by some Borgesian
archaeologist, a race that once understood the meaning of
circles, spheres and cubes; or the throne room of some
not-quite-human king in one of Italo Calvino's "Invisible
Cities."</p>
<p>I can't think when I've seen a museum display so
beautiful, so compelling, so dense with provocative
possibilities and unanswered questions. Major credit goes to
his curator and Boswell, James Elliott, for whom this clearly
was a long labor of love; and to Nina Hubbs, the museum's
installation designer, who could teach Mr. Polledri a thing
or two.</p>
<p>Mr. Byars's 25 precious objects now are being shipped to
Houston, to be reinstalled by him (differently) in the
Contemporary Arts Museum there. If you're anywhere near
Houston in September or October, go see this perfect show.</p>
