   Fraud-Ridden Claims</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>INSURERS are trying to beat high-technology cheaters at
their own game by scrutinizing doctors' computer billing more
closely and by cranking up security on their own databases.</p>
<p>Fraud bamboozled government and private insurers of about
$60 billion last year, or about 10% of the $600 billion spent
on health care, says the National Health Care Anti-Fraud
Association in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>A variety of cheaters bilk insurers by culling information
from office computers, such as details about patients and
their insurance coverage, and then by padding bills with
false visits, lab tests or X-rays. The potential for such
crimes is growing, too, as more insurers adopt "paperless"
claims, using completely electronic systems.</p>
<p>To ward off fraud, systems such as the one dubbed Robocop
at Aetna Life Insurance verify claims and police databases.
For example, the computer crosschecks claimant data to flag
such frauds as a single procedure leading to several claims
in different relatives' names.</p>
<p>About 40% of insurers have launched anti-fraud programs in
the past three years, says a survey by the Health Insurance
Association, a Washington trade group. Members investigated
about 19,600 cases in 1989, up 56% since 1987, saving $48
million.</p>
<p>Culprits include doctors, patients, employees and outside
hackers. Everyone, says Richard Ekfelt, director of the
anti-fraud group, "from welfare clinics to Beverly Hills
psychiatrists."</p>
<p>About 3% of the nation's doctors "routinely" commit fraud,
claim the insurers. The American Medical Association says it
has become more "militant," throwing out 39 physicians last
year, the first such expulsions. "There will be more to
come," promises President C. John Tupper.

<p>Government Isn't Paying</p>
<p>Its Tab, Firms Complain</p>
<p>AS health-care costs continue to soar, companies and
hospitals complain that Uncle Sam isn't paying his fair
share. But whether they'll push the government to act is
another story.</p>
<p>Of every dollar paid by businesses for health care, 11
cents results from Medicare and Medicaid shortfalls, charges
the American Hospital Association in Chicago. The group says
private payers shouldered about $2 billion in Medicare and $3
billion in Medicaid shortfalls last year.</p>
<p>The business community is beginning to do "low-key"
lobbying, says a U.S. Chamber of Commerce spokesman. But
there is "institutional gridlock," he warns, among groups
with different interests, and businesses worry about pushing
the U.S. too hard, for fear taxes will go up.</p>
<p>Still, there's plenty of incentive for action. Employers
saw per-employee health-care costs climb 67% between 1986 and
1989, says Foster Higgins, a consulting firm. More than 43%
of hospitals had operating losses in 1988, and that trend
continues, says the Healthcare Financial Management
Association, Westchester, Ill.</p>
<p>The government, meanwhile, begs to differ. The Health Care
Financing Administration, the agency that establishes
reimbursement rates, says payments are adequate. "We have no
data to indicate" anyone else is picking up the tab, says a
spokesman.</p>
<p>Sometimes Less Is More</p>
<p>In Hospital Storerooms</p>
<p>MEDICAL CENTERS are reaping surprising savings from
"stockless inventories" in the latest twist on the Japanese
concept of just-in-time delivery.</p>
<p>In stockless systems, vendors bring ready-to-use supplies
right to closets, nurses' stations and operating rooms.
Hospitals keep just a 24-hour reserve, instead of enormous
warehouses, and orders are sent electronically to one or two
vendors, who deliver 95% of supplies in 12 to 18 hours.</p>
<p>By contrast, the typical 500-bed facility may spend about
$850,000 a year on supplies, but hoard as much as six times
that amount of inventory throughout the hospital. And they
often have hundreds of vendors making deliveries.</p>
<p>Hospitals find that treating inventory problems yields a
whole range of savings. "It's like the level of water in a
lake," says Ned L. Gerber, health-care consultant at Coopers
& Lybrand in Chicago. "As the inventory level comes down, all
of the junk and problems that had sunk to the bottom are
exposed."</p>
<p>With an investment of about $250,000 in computer support,
Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn.,
slashed inventory by about $2.8 million and operating costs
by about $270,000 annually, including cutting 27 supply jobs.
An 18,000-square-foot warehouse formerly used for central
supplies is now earmarked for neurology and pulmonary
diagnostic centers.</p>
<p>Still, just 30 to 60 hospitals in the U.S. now use some
form of stockless inventory. Analysts say only one-third of
the nation's 6,000 hospitals can make the switch. Other
hospitals find their options limited if they are too far from
major distribution centers, don't have sophisticated
computers or can't find the right vendors.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>THE INSURANCE industry wants to put more medical alert
bracelets and necklaces on corporate employees. The Million
Dollar Roundtable, a trade group of agents, gave a $30,000
grant to Medic Alert, a nonprofit group that supplies warning
accessories. They clue emergency staff to allergies, rare
blood types, heart disease and other conditions that affect
one in four employees. . . . A survey showed that 73% of top
executives think drug abuse, acquired immune deficiency
syndrome and aging will push up health-care costs at least
20% each year until 1993, says Noble Lowndes, an East Orange,
N.J., benefits firm.</p>
