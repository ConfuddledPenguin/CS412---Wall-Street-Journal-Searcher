	<p class="article-leader">SAN DIEGO -- More than a thousand citizens are to gather
on a mesa here at nightfall today to shine their automobile
headlights across the border to Mexico. It is the latest such
symbolic protest against what these Americans say is the U.S.
government's failure to enforce its immigration laws.
   Three years ago those statutes were tightened under the
so-called Simpson-Rodino act. Yet for months, a former San
Diego mayor and the widow of a Border Patrol officer have
been trying to embarrass U.S. authorities into beefing up the
boundary between two ostensibly friendly peoples. Muriel
Watson is the leader of the Light Up the Border campaign, and
Roger Hedgecock, who held the top job in the nation's
sixth-largest city from 1983 to 1985, is promoting her cause
on his popular radio talk show.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>They say that Simpson-Rodino turned out to be a hoax, that
the Border Patrol wasn't bolstered as promised, and that
aliens are pouring across as never before and bringing crime
to nearby communities. The Border Patrol acknowledges that,
after a dropoff in the wake of the new law, apprehensions
will rise 35% this fiscal year. It estimates that only a
third of those crossing are caught. Mr. Hedgecock, alluding
in an interview to this newspaper's editorial advocacy of
open immigration, said, "You have got your wish here in San
Diego."</p>
<p>Not quite, as a daytime tour of the hilly border area near
the Pacific Ocean with Mrs. Watson shows. Watching dozens of
the mostly male masses huddle to begin a cat-and-mouse
routine with the Border Patrol that will culminate after
sundown, it is clear that crossing isn't yet easy. We see a
few dart through gaps in the coverage, running on into brush
toward the sewage-contaminated Tijuana River basin that still
separates them from population centers. Patrol trucks pass
along Dairy Mart Road, which parallels the border, every few
minutes, some carrying young men who didn't make it to the
promised land.</p>
<p>Mrs. Watson intersperses dread at each attempted crossing
with pity for immigrants who are raped or robbed by smugglers
along their nighttime escape path or run over, as is
happening increasingly, by cars as they race across
Interstate 5 to evade an alien checkpoint along the route
north. Many more women and small children are coming now,
part of whole families planning to settle in the U.S. A
simple yellow sign warns motorists to watch for "people
crossing" the eight-lane expressway.</p>
<p>By associating this mayhem with the immigration itself,
rather than with the laws that drive it underground, Mrs.
Watson repeats a mistake often made with regard to the
bloodshed that accompanies other forms of contraband. She
assumes that a more secure border would stop trouble before
it starts, as well as pressure the Mexican government, from
whose historically bad policies most of the aliens are
fleeing, into reforms that would alleviate the pressure.
(Some of the migrants actually are from Central America,
allegedly ushered through and out of Mexico with official
sanction.)</p>
<p>An evocative article in the August issue of Harper's
Magazine describes the terrifying trek to opportunity from
the immigrant's view. On the U.S. side as well, Mr. Hedgecock
says, the always rough edges of life where rich fronts poor
have taken on new meanness. An upsurge in robberies and what
police call "car prowls" in the border areas -- plus drug
sales and shipments, according to the former mayor --
reflects a "growing criminal undercurrent" that he estimates
at 10% of the immigrant population. (Here it must be noted
that Mr. Hedgecock himself was forced from office when
convicted of a felony campaign-law violation; his benefactors
were running a Ponzi scheme.)</p>
<p>Often the mere presence of groups of apparent illegals is
enough to put the locals on edge. In communities such as
Encinitas, north of San Diego, legal and extralegal roustings
of "campesinos" from their makeshift quarters in canyons and
their parking-lot "hiring halls" have brought protests from
poverty-law groups. On the other hand, citizens and
businesses (some of whom may be using the cheap labor)
complain of trash, human waste and intimidation from the
itinerants, and lament that the authorities duck enforcing
the law against them for fear of prompting civil-rights
litigation.</p>
<p>More than 40,000 illegals in the San Diego area signed up
for full-fledged amnesty under Simpson-Rodino, and an
additional 150,000 at least passed through the area under a
section for migrant agricultural workers. Mrs. Watson and Mr.
Hedgecock favor a controlled-entry program to fill jobs for
which no American citizen is applying. This would seek to
combat the idleness of young laborers that they believe
fosters much of the crime. Yet it is predicated on a
bureaucratic arrangement contrary to what we know is key to
economic dynamism. It would also, of course, shield U.S.
workers whose services may be overpriced or of lower quality.</p>
<p>In some ways, their idea is in line with the philosophy
behind proposed changes in the national immigration law. A
measure coming out of the House would hike the legal quota by
more than 50% but link the increase to filling demonstrated
voids in the labor force. (The Senate, and the Bush
administration, won't even grant that much.)</p>
<p>Close to home, Light Up the Border has enjoyed mixed
success. It is accused of racism by some Mexican officials
and the local left, and shunned by much of the San Diego
establishment. Yet something appears to have led the Army
Corps of Engineers to enhance fencing and lighting. Still, no
one has paid a political price for resisting tighter
controls. (Mrs. Watson is opposing an entrenched Democrat for
a legislative seat, and is regarded as a gadfly.) Will the
electoral earth someday shake? Mr. Hedgecock, who still likes
the access-control idea -- quashed a few years ago -- of a
Big Ditch along the border, expresses frustration toward the
inertia of the governing elite he once was part of. "The
fed-up middle class doesn't care what's `politically
acceptable,'" he says.</p>
<p>A movement like his is bound to attract elements that are
xenophobic or worse. But Mr. Hedgecock and Mrs. Watson, for
all a libertarian on the issue will disagree with them,
represent instead a good body of Americans who aren't haters
but feel besieged by forces that disturb their peace. In an
earlier day they would have been part of the Silent Majority
that "pays the taxes and obeys the laws." Their powerless
rage is not so different from what fueled tax, busing and
dirty-art revolts that conservative intellectuals have
embraced.</p>
<p>So add a political paradox to the fiscal and cultural
effects that proponents of open immigration must be prepared
to deal with. Pondering these issues over some great ceviche
at the Mariscos Hector storefront cafe in close-by Chula
Vista after the tour of the front lines, one is left to
regret the status quo and to find unappetizing the short-run
alternatives.</p>
