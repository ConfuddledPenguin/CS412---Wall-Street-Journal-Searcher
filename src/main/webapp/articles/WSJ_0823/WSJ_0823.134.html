	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Caesars World Inc. reported that earnings
for its fourth quarter ended July 31 fell 55% to $7.4
million, or 31 cents a share, from $16.4 million, or 66 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   Most of the decline came from Caesar's Nevada hotel/casino
operations, particularly from low table-game win percentages
at Caesars Tahoe. In Las Vegas, a decrease in wagering
activity at Caesars Palace was partially offset by a higher
win percentage by the company over the same period a year
ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue fell 5.1% to $223.7 million from $235.7 million.</p>
<p>Although Caesars' results were about what analysts
expected, the company's stock fell $1.875 a share to $11.875
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.</p>
<p>The drop may reflect "growing nervousness over what the
problems in the Middle East and higher oil prices could do to
the travel business," said Lee Isgur, an analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. in New York.</p>
<p>But Caesars has had other problems. Competition from new
casinos in both Las Vegas and Atlantic City, N.J., has hurt
its business for the past few quarters. Caesars has also
blamed higher provisions for bad debts, as well as increased
casino payroll and operating costs related to completing a
two-year renovation and expansion program.</p>
<p>For the full year, net declined 45% to $36.8 million, or
$1.52 a share, compared with $66.9 million, or $2.72 a share,
a year earlier. Revenue fell 3.5% to $870.2 million from $902
million.</p>
<p>Caesars said it bought back about 1.2 million of its
common shares during fiscal 1990, reducing the number of
shares currently outstanding to about 24 million. During the
year, Caesars said it also bought back $19.8 million of its
13.5% notes due in 1997.</p>
