	<p class="article-leader">Though Akira Kurosawa has been making films for half a
century, he probably was anonymous to most Americans until
this spring, when he won a special Academy Award. The prize
was payback from his students, film makers such as Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas and Martin Scorsese, who have
learned much of what they know from the Japanese master. (Mr.
Lucas, for example, quite openly borrowed from Mr. Kurosawa's
"Hidden Fortress" for his "Star Wars" trilogy.)
   This broadest show of acceptance must have been gratifying
to a man who, 20 years ago, was so depressed by his life and
his film career that he tried to kill himself. So in a way it
is a shame that the first Kurosawa film to be released after
this belated introduction to the movie-going public is "Akira
Kurosawa's Dreams."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Not that this cinematic anthology of an old man's visions
isn't extraordinarily vivid and evocative as well as quite
moving; it is. But these painterly set pieces don't have --
couldn't have because of the form -- the sustained narrative
pulse that give the best Kurosawa pictures their emotional
energy. (Nor are they as immediately accessible as his
sometimes bloody action pictures, such as "The Seven Samurai"
or "Yojimbo.")</p>
<p>Mr. Kurosawa's "Dreams" is both a logical extension of the
director's lifelong search for a harmonious take on the world
and a relief after the bleakness of his last film, "Ran."
That powerfully constructed work was a resolutely hopeless
interpretation of "King Lear" that suggested Mr. Kurosawa had
looked back on his already long life and decided he should
have worked harder at his failed suicide.</p>
<p>Now, as Mr. Kurosawa has rummaged through his subconscious
and reconstructed what he found there in film form, he has
found a more heartening range of emotion for a man of his age
and accomplishment. As thinking people have always been, he's
worried about the future of the world and upset by human
destructiveness. But he also sees beauty and responds to it
in two ways: as an ambitious artist who will never have time
to do all he wants to do, and as a perpetual seeker who hopes
someday to simply appreciate the beauty he's found.</p>
<p>He has taken this mixture of memory, fear, loss, anxiety
and hope and divided the ingredients into eight vignettes,
each with a particular point to make (pro-nature, anti-nuke,
pro-artist, anti-war).</p>
<p>He has shaped his dreams into folklorish tales that could
also serve as an advanced guide to the film-maker's craft.
For this collection he has created an assortment of striking
worlds that can be light and lyrical or dark and barren. Mr.
Kurosawa not only knows every trick in the book, he invented
many of them. He has used these vignettes as a showcase for
the mix of harshness and beauty, simplicity and extravaganza,
that makes his visual poetry, always accompanied by the most
striking sounds.</p>
<p>The first two tales unfold from the point of view of small
boys learning the oldest lesson in the book, that humans pay
a price when their desire or greed interrupts nature's
course. "Sunshine Through the Rain" is drawn from a Japanese
legend that says foxes get married when the sun shines on
rainy days and it is bad luck for humans to watch. "The Peach
Orchard" tells the story of a little boy still mourning the
loss of the family peach trees his parents had chopped down,
and whose imagination briefly brings them back to life.</p>
<p>Mr. Kurosawa has choreographed these stories as a blend of
dance and painting. A troupe of Kabuki-like dancers
represents the foxes in the first; a troupe of human dolls
wearing brightly colored costumes re-creates the peach
orchard for the little boy in the second. The composition and
movement of these pieces is so striking that the non-Japanese
speaker may feel tempted to ignore the subtitles because the
narrative is so much more prosaic than the imagery.</p>
<p>Mr. Kurosawa appointed as guide through the rest of his
dreams the appealingly inquisitive-looking actor, Akira
Terao. Though he is in young middle-age, Mr. Terao's
character, called "I," seems to represent in some ways the
spectator that Mr. Kurosawa feels himself to be. Whether
wandering through a world devastated by nuclear war, or
stepping into a van Gogh painting to meet the artist, "I"
looks like a professional tourist. He'd like to be a part of
the horrible and wonderful things going on around him but
he's too busy asking questions to get caught up in anything,
even the end of the world.</p>
<p>The most playful piece is "Crows," Mr. Kurosawa's homage
to van Gogh. The film maker found a wheat field in Japan that
has a van Gogh glow and put director Martin Scorsese in the
middle of it. The amusingly frantic Kurosawa disciple stands
holding his paint easel, his hair and beard dyed red and a
straw hat on his head, and a bandage (and a helpful reference
to a missing ear). "I" watches Mr. Scorsese's hyperkinetic
Vincent race through the stunning set Mr. Kurosawa built for
this piece, a world designed to look like a three-dimensional
van Gogh painting.</p>
<p>After presenting his vision of a nightmarish nuclear war,
Mr. Kurosawa ends on a note of reconciliation and redemption,
with "Village of the Windmills." But this isn't the last word
from Mr. Kurosawa: He's just begun production on his
adaptation of "Rhapsody in August," Kiyoko Murata's novel
about a Japanese family's reconciliation with its American
relatives.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"Pump Up the Volume" is 42-year-old director Allan Moyle's
vision of contemporary teen life, told from the point of view
of a kid who becomes a celebrated talk-radio host working off
a short-wave radio in his bedroom. In life he's just another
alienated suburban teenager who gets good grades and doesn't
talk to anybody at school. At night he's a star, talking
dirty (in a disguised voice) and talking directly about the
problems of being a teenager today: "All the great themes
have been used up and turned into theme parks."</p>
<p>Christian Slater, the Jack Palance lookalike who played
nasty so nicely in "Heathers," plays this Lenny Bruce wannabe
as a nice kid who wants to be bad, and he does it well. The
movie has an engaging low-budget congeniality, though Mr.
Moyle never quite gets a handle on whether he's making a
cartoon or playing it straight.</p>

<p>VIDEO TIP: A friend of mine who has seen almost every
movie ever made on any continent says Mr. Kurosawa's "Ikiru"
(Japanese for "to live") changed his life. This, too, is a
movie about dreams, the dream of a man dying of cancer who
finally finds meaning in his last years.</p>
