	<p class="article-leader">Comprehensive Care Corp., St. Louis, said dissident
shareholders succeeded in their effort to oust the directors
of the provider of chemical dependency programs.
   A spokesman for the dissident group said that the new
directors intend to meet on Monday and remove the company's
chief executive officer, W. James Nicol, and that the new
chief executive will be James P. Carmany, a 51-year-old
former Comprehensive Care executive vice president who left
the company last year in a dispute with management.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said six nominees of the shareholders
committee were elected directors: Norman L. Perry, Harvey G.
Felsen, Howard S. Groth, Robert I. Miller, Charles Moore and
Michael K. O'Toole. Mr. Nicol, the ousted board's nominee,
also was elected a director.</p>
<p>The dissident group, which holds about 9.1% of
Comprehensive Care's stock, launched its proxy fight after
management's attempt to sell the company failed last year and
the stock price collapsed. The group, called the Shareholders
Committee to Rejuvenate CompCare, has said it might seek a
restructuring of the company's assets and liabilities.</p>
