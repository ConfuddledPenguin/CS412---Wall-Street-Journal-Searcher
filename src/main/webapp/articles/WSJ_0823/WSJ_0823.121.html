	<p class="article-leader">Veba AG of West Germany, a diversified energy and trading
company, reported that first-half group net income slipped
1.5% to 391 million marks ($250.2 million) from 397 million
marks a year earlier.
   The company said the results were dragged down by the
petroleum and chemical sectors, where earnings declined from
"exceptionally good" year-earlier levels. But Veba said its
power generation, trading, transport and services businesses
had "stable profit levels" in the latest period. Pretax
earnings fell 5.2% to 981 million marks from 1.04 billion
marks. After taxes, profit eased 2.3% to 433 million marks
from 443 million marks.</p>
