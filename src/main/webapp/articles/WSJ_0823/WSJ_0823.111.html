	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on long-term Treasury bonds exceeded
the psychologically important 9% mark as oil prices surged to
their highest level since 1985.
   But the benchmark bond's high yield, which attracted herds
of investors on previous occasions, sparked little excitement
among investors yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It appears that 9% is not the magic level," said Michael
Moran, manager of government securities trading at Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. "People are too spooked by
the prospects of what could happen in the Mideast to try to
decide" if now is the right time to buy bonds. He said
trading activity was extremely light yesterday, with few
people willing to take on new investment positions.</p>
<p>For days, some bond market analysts had predicted a bond
market rally as soon as yields on long-term securities hit
9%. But these analysts may have underestimated the depth of
bearishness pervading the bond market. That bearishness,
fueled by inflation fears, continues to drive investors away
from bonds while putting upward pressure on yields. Inflation
cuts the value of fixed-income investments by reducing the
inflation-adjusted return.</p>
<p>In trading yesterday, the yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond ended at about 9.05%, the highest
closing yield on a benchmark bond this year. The bond's price
fell 1 1/8 points, a loss of about $11.25 for a bond with a
$1,000 face amount.</p>
<p>"Bond yields are very attractive, but this is not the
right time to jump into the market," said Sung Won Sohn,
senior vice president and chief economist at Norwest Corp.,
Minneapolis. "As soon as investors see the market stabilize,
then I think we will see a whole lot of people jumping into
the market to take advantage of the yields. But we are not
there yet."</p>
<p>The bond market started to lose ground in early trading
when investors concluded that the Federal Reserve wasn't in
the process of lowering short-term interest rates. On
Tuesday, the possibility that the Fed was on the verge of
easing emerged when the federal funds rate slipped to 7 3/4%
from its target level of 8% shortly after the Fed executed $2
billion in customer repurchase agreements. Although many
economists said the Fed action was merely technical in nature
and designed to offset reserve shortages in the banking
system, a few investors thought the Fed was in the process of
cutting rates.</p>
<p>But when the Fed failed to enter the market yesterday,
that sent a clear signal that the nation's central bank isn't
yet ready to change monetary policy.</p>
<p>Bond prices began to deteriorate rapidly later in the day
as crude oil prices soared in heavy trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. The crude oil futures contract for
October delivery ended at $31.22 a barrel, up $2.51 on the
day.</p>
<p>The declines in long-term government securities prices
"were all a result of the spike in crude oil prices," said
Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. "Whatever happened in oil, the credit market
showed a mirror reflection."</p>
<p>At the heart of the energy price spike is the perception
among oil investors and consumers that the flow of oil from
the Persian Gulf will dwindle as the Iraq-Kuwait conflict
intensifies.</p>
<p>Comments by an Israeli official that war between the U.S.
and Iraq was "inevitable" added fuel to the fire, while
President Bush's comment that Americans should try to
conserve energy did nothing to assuage investors' fear that
an oil shortage is imminent.</p>
<p>In addition to fears of inflation and rising oil prices,
dealers said investors are worried about the market's ability
to absorb a large amount of new Treasury notes to be sold
next week.</p>
<p>The Treasury announced yesterday that it will auction
$11.5 billion of two-year notes next Tuesday and $8.5 billion
of five-year two-month notes on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Today, the Treasury will sell $10.5 billion of 52-week
bills.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Treasury bonds were sharply lower due to fears of
inflation, rising oil prices and the realization that the
Federal Reserve is not yet ready to reduce short-term
interest rates.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
96 26/32, down from 97 30/32 on Tuesday. The issue's yield,
which moves in the opposite direction from its price, jumped
to 9.05% from 8.94%.</p>
<p>Shorter-term Treasury securities showed smaller declines.
Prices of two-year notes, for example, fell to 99 17/32 from
99 21/32 on Tuesday, while the yield rose to 8.24% from
8.17%.</p>
<p>Treasury bills were mixed. Three-month bills showed little
change as the discount rate on the 90-day bills finished at
7.59% to yield 7.83%, compared with 7.58% to yield 7.82% on
Tuesday. The discount rate on six-month bills rose, however,
to 7.52% to yield 7.90%. That compares with 7.48% to yield
7.86% on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Junk/Corporate Bonds</p>
<p>Junk bonds followed stock prices lower yesterday, with
most issues posting declines of between 1/4 and 3/8 point.</p>
<p>"The whole market is in disarray," said James Spirrison, a
senior vice president in the high-yield department at
Chicago-based Rodman & Renshaw. "Nobody wants to do anything
at all."</p>
<p>So far this week, the junk bond market has fallen 1.74%,
according to First Boston Corp.'s high-yield index. For the
month, the junk bond market has generated a negative return
of 3.74%.</p>
<p>Sam DeRosa-Farag, a First Boston analyst, said the
hardest-hit sectors are food, housing, retail, air
transportation and financial sectors. Mr. DeRosa-Farag said
that deferred pay bonds have declined more than the
cash-paying bonds and junior securities have been hurt more
than senior and senior secured bonds.</p>
<p>Among the junk bonds that took a beating yesterday:</p>
<p>-- AmBase Corp.'s 14.875% senior subordinated notes fell 9
1/8 points to 62 on the New York Stock Exchange after
plummeting more than eight points Tuesday. Traders cited
concerns about the company's sale of its Home Insurance Co.
unit.</p>
<p>-- Charter Medical Corp.'s 14.25% senior subordinated
debentures fell two points to end at 20. The health-care
company said late Tuesday that the Securities and Exchange
Commission plans to review its 1988 management-led leveraged
buy-out.</p>
<p>-- Caesars World Inc. bonds slipped after the casino
operator reported quarterly earnings of $7.4 million, down
from $16.4 million in the year-ago period. Its 13.50%
subordinated notes slid 3/8 point to 100 1/8.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, recently depressed junk bonds of American
Standard Inc. rebounded slightly. The company's 12.875%
senior subordinated debentures added 3/4 point to end at 89.
A spokeswoman couldn't explain the recent activity.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade corporate bond market, high-grade
issues showed losses across the board. Long-term corporate
issues declined the most, falling 5/8 point on average.
Intermediate corporate bonds, by comparison, shed 3/8 to 1/2
point.</p>
<p>Municipal Issues
</p>
<p>Municipal bonds were broadly lower, with some issues down
as much as 1 1/2 points.</p>
<p>"The market is getting crushed," said one trader. "They're
not leaving anything behind."</p>
<p>In the secondary market, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's
7.20% bonds maturing in 2018 were 1 1/8 point lower at 96 1/2
to yield 7.46%.</p>
<p>The turmoil in the secondary markets carried over to
new-issue dealings, where new offerings were being priced
lower than comparable secondary issues, traders said.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>In the mortgage-securities market, the 9 1/2% coupons for
September delivery from Government National Mortgage
Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. and Federal
National Mortgage Association were all down 11/32, as were
the 9% coupons from the three agencies.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>Investors went on a modest buying spree in many European
bond markets, pushing prices higher for the first time in
several days.</p>
<p>Traders said investor interest was stimulated by yields
that have reached what investors consider attractive levels.</p>
<p>West German bonds posted gains for the first time in five
sessions as yields exceeded or approached 9%.</p>
<p>Bonn's 8 3/4% bond due 2000 rose 0.20 point to 98.80 to
yield 8.93%. The latest 10-year issue, the 8 1/2% bond due
2000, rose 0.10 point to 96.80 to yield 9%.</p>
<p>French government bonds ended higher for the first time in
four trading days. Among benchmark issues, the 8.5% issue due
2019 rose 0.11 from late Tuesday in Paris to 81.57 to yield
10.53%.</p>
<p>British government bonds were modestly higher. The 11 3/4%
benchmark bond due 2003/2007 was quoted late at 98 3/32, up
9/32 from late Tuesday, to yield 12.00%.</p>
<p>But in Tokyo, selling in the futures market, rising
short-term interest rates and a weak stock market weakened
the Japanese government bond market.</p>
<p>At the Tokyo Stock Exchange close, the benchmark No. 119
10-year bond was quoted at a price of 83.03, down 0.17, to
yield 8.105%.</p>
<p>(Foreign bond yields are quoted here in local terms and
therefore differ somewhat from yields calculated for these
markets by U.S. investment firms, which tend to use the
semiannual compound measure to compare yields across markets.
Using that method, the yield on Japan's No. 119 bond ended at
7.46%, according to Salomon Brothers Inc.)</p>
