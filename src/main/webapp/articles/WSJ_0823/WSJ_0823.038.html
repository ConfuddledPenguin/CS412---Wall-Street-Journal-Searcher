	<p class="article-leader">Despite an initial surge at the opening bell,
over-the-counter stocks eased by midmorning and then fell
drastically in the last hour of trading on their way to
another closing loss.
   Traders say uncertainty about a resolution to the crisis
in the Middle East is preoccupying investor minds. They say
until there is positive news from the Persian Gulf the market
can expect more erosion of stock prices.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The market can take bad news and it can take good news.
It can't take uncertainty," says Robert McCready, a senior
trader for A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index ended the day at 374.84, a 4.84
point loss. The Nasdaq's broad index's 1.3% loss was slightly
better than the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index's
1.5% decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7%, or
43.81.</p>
<p>OTC stocks surged at the opening bell only to show losses
again before the first hour of trading was complete. Traders
found little consolation in the opening burst and even less
in a steep decline during the last hour.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite Index had been down about two points
at midafternoon.</p>
<p>Declining issues led advancers 1,267 to 722. Volume was
146.1 million shares compared with 166.5 million shares
Tuesday.</p>
<p>This was the OTC's fourth consecutive losing session.</p>
<p>Robert O'Toole, head of OTC trading for Shearson Lehman
Brothers, suggested that investors sold off
telecommunications, cable and cellular stocks in an effort to
take whatever profit remains in their portfolios.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Utility Index outpaced the broader market's
slump, closing 2.9% lower.</p>
<p>MCI Communications, the most active OTC issue, fell 5/8 to
33 on two million shares. Tele-Communications Class A shares
fell 7/8 to 10 1/4. American Television & Communications was
down 1/2 to 29 1/4.</p>
<p>McCaw Cellular was off 1 to 17 3/4. LIN Broadcasting
tumbled 2 7/8 to 54 1/8. Contel Cellular dropped 1/2 to 13
1/2.</p>
<p>Nike has been hit by major declines recently and yesterday
was no exception.</p>
<p>The athletic-shoe maker's shares fell 5 3/8 to 62 despite
apparently good news that local black community groups in
Portland, Ore., Nike's headquarters, would not join a boycott
of Nike and its products. "Operation Push" has urged a
boycott, claiming Nike does not provide adequate employment
or business opportunities for blacks.</p>
<p>Traders speculated that investors are skeptical of Nike
shares because of general market woes and concerns that a
prolonged recession would hurt sales of expensive athletic
shoes.</p>
<p>Elmwood Federal Savings Bank shares lost 50.9% of its
value diving 6 3/4 to 6 1/2. Susquehanna Bancshares cited
changes in market conditions late Tuesday when it terminated
its agreement to purchase Elmwood Federal for about $24
million. Susquehanna shares added 3/4 to close at 17 3/4.</p>
<p>Justin Industries signed a definitive agreement to acquire
Tony Lama Co. for $9 a share or about $52 million. Tony Lama
jumped 3 1/2 to 8. Justin Industries fell 3/4 to 14 1/4.</p>
<p>Mission-Valley Bancorp and Northern California Bancorp
announced they would merge. Their merger agreement calls for
Northern California shareholders to receive 1.23 new shares
for each existing share. Mission-Valley shares added 2 to
close at 12 1/4. Northern California declined 1 1/2 to 16.</p>
<p>Xoma fell 1 3/4 to 18 1/4 on concerns about the Food and
Drug Administration's requests for more information about
Xoma drugs intended for the treatment of septic shock and
complications associated with bone marrow transplants.</p>
<p>NovaCare announced it plans to offer another four million
common shares in a public offering. NovaCare shares dropped 1
5/8 to 18 7/8.</p>
<p>Autodesk was one point higher at 46 3/4. The company
reported late Tuesday that net income for the second quarter
rose to 59 cents a share from 46 cents a year ago.</p>
<p>Stuart Hall fell 1 5/8 to 9. The company disclosed Tuesday
that another investor group has expressed interest in
acquiring a 7% stake in the company. Stuart Hall said it is
not negotiating with that group but has negotiated with
another group also interested in a 7% stake.</p>
