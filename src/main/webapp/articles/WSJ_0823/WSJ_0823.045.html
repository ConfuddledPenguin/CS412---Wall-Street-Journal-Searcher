	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- The local Republican Party still may not win
elections, but at least now it offers a winning ticket.
   The woebegone county GOP, outnumbered by Democrats 2 1/2
to 1, has a new scheme to register Republican voters. How
will it combat the electoral imbalance? Fiery rhetoric?
Grass-roots appeal? A heavy dose of idealism?</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"An exciting contest," proposes county GOP Chairman Henry
Sneath, in a letter to fellow Republicans. He wants local
youths to compete in registering Republican voters in
Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District. The winner will
be selected in a raffle.</p>
<p>The grand prize: "An all-expense-paid weekend for two to
Washington, D.C." But for those drooling for a trip to the
Potomac, there's a catch: The tightfisted GOP will only pay
$50 each for the winner and guest, including transportation
and hotel.</p>
<p>The lucky couple will be chaperoned the entire weekend by
doting party elders who will save airfare by driving them on
the five-hour trek. The winner's discount hotel room will be
paid for with leftover frequent flier mileage. And if you're
going with your sweetheart, you may have to sleep in separate
rooms, says Sallie Duhon, a 55-year-old ward coordinator who
will chaperone the trip.</p>
<p>"It's not the fanciest trip," admits Rick Santorum, the
Republican candidate for the 18th District. There may be no
free lunch in Washington, but county Republicans hope party
fat cats in the capital will pick up part of the tab.</p>
<p>When the 18th District, in suburban Pittsburgh, was
redrawn in 1981, it gave the GOP a chance to gain a
congressional seat. But the Republicans still haven't won it,
nor do they hold any of the other four seats in Southwestern
Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Some 25 eager young Republicans have signed on, but the
target of the registration drive, Democratic incumbent Doug
Walgren, hasn't let the extravaganza disrupt his New England
vacation. Says Jonathan Delano, Mr. Walgren's chief of staff:
"No one is quaking in their boots."</p>
<p>One Republican volunteer, David Rice, 21, says he wasn't
lured by the prize. "I don't see how you could be," he says.</p>
<p>Maybe that's because he hasn't heard about the "attractive
runner-up prizes." These include tickets for the Republican
"victory cruise" on the Allegheny River. The party has high
hopes for the election, but apparently not too high: The
cruise sails three weeks before Election Day.</p>
