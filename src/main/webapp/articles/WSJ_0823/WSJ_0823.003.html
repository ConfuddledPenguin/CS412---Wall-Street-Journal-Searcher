	<p class="article-leader">U.S. District Court Judge Robert Aguilar of San Jose,
Calif., was convicted of two corruption charges, disclosing a
wiretap to an ex-mobster and lying to the FBI to obstruct a
grand jury probe.
   Unless he resigns, Judge Aguilar faces probable
impeachment and removal from office by Congress if either
count is upheld on appeal. He would be the fourth federal
judge forced from the bench in the last decade for alleged
criminal wrongdoing.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The San Francisco jury acquitted the 59-year-old Judge
Aguilar on three other counts, including a charge that he
attempted to influence another Northern California federal
judge in the handling of a case. For each of his convictions,
he could be sentenced to five years in prison.</p>
<p>His attorney, Paul Meltzer, of Santa Cruz, Calif., said he
believed an appeal was likely, but added, "I think that this
is probably the end of a long and distinguished career on the
bench." Mr. Meltzer asserted that the judge had been cleared
of the "core charges" against him. Judge Aguilar couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>A Justice Department prosecutor on the case couldn't be
reached.</p>
<p>The trial was the second for Judge Aguilar and involved
scaled-down allegations. In the first trial, prosecutors
accused the judge of using his office as a "racketeering
enterprise." Federal prosecutors dropped that charge after a
mistrial on that and six other charges in March. Judge
Aguilar had been the first federal judge ever charged with
violating the federal anti-racketeering statute. In the March
trial he was aquitted of an obstruction of justice count.</p>
<p>Judge Aguilar was convicted of disclosing to ex-mobster
Abe Chapman that Mr. Chapman was the subject of a federal
wiretap, which Judge Aguilar had learned about from a fellow
judge. The judge denied intentionally tipping off Mr.
Chapman, who at the time was a relative by marriage.</p>
<p>He was also convicted of attempting to obstruct a grand
jury investigation by lying to the FBI about his knowledge of
the wiretap and about his involvement in an attempt by former
Teamster leader Rudy Tham to overturn a 1980 embezzlement
conviction. Mr. Tham and Mr. Chapman were friends.</p>
<p>Judge Aguilar was acquitted of conspiring to influence the
federal judge who was handling the Tham case, Stanley Weigel.
Judges Aguilar and Weigel testified that Judge Aguilar asked
Judge Weigel several times about the status of the case but
didn't attempt to influence its outcome.</p>
<p>Judge Aguilar was appointed by President Carter in 1980.
His supporters have asserted that the government's case
against him was a Republican political vendetta in response
to decisions he made that were unfavorable to prosecutors.</p>

<p>SEC CHARGES five lawyers with insider trading.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission charged five
members of a Michigan law firm with insider trading in the
stock of Zenith Laboratories Inc. in May 1988, shortly before
the company announced plans to seek federal bankruptcy
protection.</p>
<p>The suit names Saul Bluestone, Joseph Bartnick, Albert
Lopatin, Sheldon Miller, and Norman Rosen, all partners in
the Detroit law firm of Lopatin, Miller, Freedman, Bluestone,
Ehrlich, Rosen & Bartnick.</p>
<p>The suit alleges that in May 1988, Mr. Bluestone learned,
by virtue of his position as a member of Zenith's board, that
the firm had authorized its president to file a bankruptcy
court petition. On the morning of May 2, the SEC said, Mr.
Bluestone called his bank, where his Zenith stock was pledged
as collateral for personal loans, and instructed his banker
to sell 50,000 shares of Zenith common stock for at least $2
a share.</p>
<p>The complaint alleges that Mr. Bluestone passed on the
information about Zenith to Mr. Bartnick, and that either Mr.
Bluestone or Mr. Bartnick shared the information with Mr.
Lopatin, Mr. Rosen and Mr. Miller.</p>
<p>As a result, Mr. Bartnick, Mr. Lopatin, Mr. Miller and Mr.
Rosen sold 22,500, 14,668, 16,000 and 6,000 Zenith shares,
respectively, at about $2 a share, the SEC alleges.</p>
<p>On May 4, Zenith announced it was filing for bankruptcy
protection, the SEC said. The price of Zenith shares declined
to a close of $1.125 on that day.</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the charges, Mr. Bluestone,
Mr. Bartnick and Mr. Rosen consented to the entry of a final
judgment enjoining them from further violations of the
securities laws and ordering them to give back the losses
they allegedly avoided of $42,167, $17,796, and $4,617,
respectively.</p>
<p>The order also directs the three to pay civil penalties
equal to the amount of the losses allegedly avoided, and
directed Mr. Bluestone and Mr. Bartnick to pay additional
penalties equal to the losses avoided by the individuals they
tipped off to Zenith's announcement.</p>
<p>The SEC said litigation against Mr. Lopatin and Mr. Miller
is continuing. The commission said it is seeking injunctions
against the two, disgorgement of losses avoided of $11,563
and $10,753, and civil penalties.</p>

<p>BATTLE IS BREWING over regulation of lawyers in Texas.</p>
<p>The staff of a legislative advisory panel stirred a
controversy by making recommendations that could strip the
State Bar of Texas of its policing powers. Currently, Texas
is one of 34 states that authorize the bar to regulate the
legal profession -- by administering attorney discipline, for
example.</p>
<p>But the staff of the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission is
proposing changes that would include the creation of an
independent state agency to police attorneys, leaving the bar
to operate more as a trade association. "Separating the
regulatory and association functions would provide an `arms
length' distance between the interests of the profession and
those of the state," a recent staff report said.</p>
<p>Among the staff's other recommendations: Requiring public
disclosure of all final disciplinary actions against Texas
attorneys. Under current rules, many such actions are made
public, but confidential reprimands are permitted.</p>
<p>The staff report was submitted to the full Sunset
Commission, a group of legislators and private citizens
charged with periodic reviews of various agencies. Last
Friday, the commission conducted public hearings on whether
the system of regulating Texas attorneys should be revamped.
Its final recommendations will be submitted to the Texas
Legislature, which will convene in regular session in
January.</p>
<p>In a lengthy report submitted to the commission on Friday,
the State Bar of Texas challenged most the Sunset staff's
proposals. It argued, for example, that the recommendation
for an independent regulatory agency "is not supported by
fact or good policy."</p>

<p>HOUSTON FIRM parcels $100 million contingency fee among
all employees.</p>
<p>Vinson & Elkins received the fee from a $350 million
settlement reached last April in litigation against Santa Fe
Pacific Corp. and its Santa Fe Railway unit. J. Evans
Attwell, managing partner of the Houston law firm, said the
money arrived Friday.</p>
<p>Vinson & Elkins's 201 partners got most of the $100
million, but bonuses also were paid to the remainder of its
1,600 workers. Mr. Attwell said the firm would "normally"
reward all employees in cases of this magnitude, although
"clearly a case of this magnitude doesn't come along with
great regularity." He declined to say how much each partner
or any employee received.</p>
<p>Vinson & Elkins had represented a group of companies that
sued Santa Fe and four other railroad companies in 1984,
charging them with illegally trying to block a coal slurry
pipeline the group wanted to build.</p>
<p>The other four railroads previously had settled their part
of the case. Vinson & Elkins's total contingency fees from
the litigation is believed to be a little less than $200
million.</p>
