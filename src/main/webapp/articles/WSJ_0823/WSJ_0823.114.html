	<p class="article-leader">Mideast tensions continued to boost gold futures prices,
although trading volume was lower than in several recent
sessions.
   December delivery gold ended with a gain of $3.30 an ounce
at $419.30. The close was just $1 below the intraday high and
nearly $3 above the day's low of $416.50. Trading was
moderate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is an extremely political market, with traders
watching everything that is being said and done by both Iraq
and the U.S.," said Sharon Ziemian, a Citibank vice
president. "Market fundamentals aren't having much weight at
the moment."</p>
<p>The armed standoff between the U.S. and Iraq in the
Persian Gulf region is underpinning the gold price, she said,
"because everyone is aware that it's the type of situation
that can blow up at any moment."</p>
<p>Demand for bullion is mostly at the "high end" of the
market, she said, explaining that buying interest was mostly
from well-financed professional international investors
rather than from smaller ones.</p>
<p>Ms. Ziemian also said a pattern has developed in recent
weeks in which the gold market is active and strong early in
the week, then tends to ease in price and volume as the
weekend approaches.</p>
<p>"This is still August, after all, and people are going
away on weekends," she said, "so there's a tendency to
continue to follow the summer custom. But many traders are
adjusting their positions before going away so that they
won't be vulnerable in case of any unexpected developments."</p>
<p>Gold trading was quieter than might have been expected in
view of the strength in oil prices, said Dinsa Mehta, chief
bullion trader for Chase Manhattan Bank. "Gold's $15 price
swing and lower close on Tuesday shell-shocked some traders,"
Mr. Mehta said. "Gold has lost some of its `fear premium.'"</p>
<p>Mr. Mehta also pointed out that higher interest rates have
cut into investor interest in gold. "This has taken the edge
off the lower interest rates/higher oil price combination
that had been fueling the gold price rise lately," he said.</p>
<p>"Right now, gold remains an event-driven market.
Technicals are out; fundamentals are out. Bullets flying in
the Middle East could drive the December price up to and
beyond the $425 level."</p>
<p>Vahid Fathi, analyst for Prescott, Ball & Turben,
Cleveland, said December gold is poised to test the $425
level for the fifth time in recent months.</p>
<p>"Gold is drawing major support from a very weak dollar,
and if it penetrates above $425 it could go as high as $475,"
he said. But if it fails to do so this time, he said, it
could remain "locked in a range of between $400 and $425 in
the intermediate term."</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>COTTON: Futures prices rose, with the October contract
ending with a gain of 0.64 cent a pound at 73.12 cents. More
than a week of hot and dry conditions in the major
Mississippi River Delta cotton-growing area has renewed
concern over cotton supplies, one analyst said. Total U.S.
inventories of cotton at the end of the 1989-90 season on
July 31 are estimated to have been only 2.9 million bales,
the slimmest in 20 years, the analyst said. This could cause
concern if strong mill demand develops for October delivery
cotton, according to the analyst. However, another analyst
said the 1990-91 cotton crop has already begun to be
harvested in the Rio Grande Valley and that during the next
three months a glut could develop as an estimated 14.8
million bales hit the market. "Dealers aren't equipped to buy
and store that much cotton, especially in view of the tighter
bank financing which has developed," the analyst said.</p>
<p>LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle futures prices rose on tight
cattle supplies and strong cash prices for beef, while pork
belly and hog futures declined slightly. Analysts said the
pattern of strong prices for beef and weak prices for pork
could become a trend throughout the fall. Analysts had been
expecting a livestock report that was released after the
close of trading Tuesday to show movement of eight million to
nine million pork bellies out of cold storage outside
Chicago, but the report showed movement of only about 5.9
million bellies, which are used to make bacon. That, coupled
with a seasonally high number of freshly killed hogs, exerted
downward pressure on cash prices and futures prices, said
Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp.,
Arlington Heights, Ill.</p>
<p>GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Futures prices rose slightly, as
traders offered up yet another possible explanation for the
huge position of Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.'s futures trading
arm in soybean oil futures contracts. The unit had been
thought to be holding a majority of all receipts for delivery
of soybean oil based on July and August futures contracts,
which show ownership of the oil stored in warehouses. Trading
in the July contract ended last month, and trading in the
August contract ended yesterday. The new rumor holds that one
reason ADM may be seeking to control such a large quantity of
soybean oil is to keep profit margins high for processing
soybeans into oil and meal. At the moment, profit on crushing
soybeans is about 50 cents a bushel, the difference between
the actual cost of crushing -- about 35 cents a bushel -- and
what the converted products are worth on the market.
Archer-Daniels is one of only five major companies that crush
soybeans into oil and meal, and limiting availability of oil
may help it keep profit for the processing high, according to
some traders. The Chicago Board of Trade was thought to be
worried that ADM's position signaled an intent to corner the
soybean oil market. ADM remained mum on the reasons for its
position.</p>
