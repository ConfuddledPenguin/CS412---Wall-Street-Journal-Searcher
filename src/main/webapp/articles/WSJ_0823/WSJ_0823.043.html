	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Washington Post Co., an early investor in the
cellular-phone industry, agreed to finance an experimental
wireless communications system that one day could rival
existing phone services.
   The agreement calls for Washington Post to set up a
limited partnership with Baltimore-based American Personal
Communications Inc., which earlier this year received
licenses from the Federal Communications Commission to build
and test the system in the Washington area.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, Washington Post will invest $6 million to be
used for "research, technology exploration and labor costs
over a two-to-three-year period," said Wayne Schelle, APC's
chairman.</p>
<p>If the test is successful, the partners said they will ask
the FCC for an operating license to provide service in the
Washington area and will pursue licenses for other U.S.
markets.</p>
<p>Like cellular networks, the new network will use
transceivers placed around the city to transmit and relay
calls. However, the new system is expected to require far
less electricity than cellular systems. This, proponents say,
will allow for phones that are lighter than current cellular
portables, because their batteries are smaller.</p>
<p>Mr. Schelle's network is still experimental. But if such
networks test successfully, analysts have said, they could
pose a serious long-term challenge not only to cellular-phone
networks, which provide portable phone services today, but
also to local phone companies that have long enjoyed a
monopoly on hard-wired residential and business phone
services.</p>
<p>Mr. Schelle envisions a phone that will sell for about $75
once full-scale networks are operating, plus a monthly
service charge of $35 to $45 a month by 1995. Portable
cellular phones, by contrast, sell for $1,000, and service
costs about $90 to $100 a month. Mr. Schelle and Washington
Post were partners in the Washington-Baltimore area's first
cellular network in 1983. He ended up selling his 40%
interest the following year for $52.5 million. The Post left
the cellular business in 1986, realizing a $200 million
after-tax gain on its investment in properties that also
included networks in Detroit and Miami.</p>
<p>"This gives us a successful partner with sufficient
resources," Mr. Schelle said. "It's like starting the game in
the fourth inning." A spokesman for the Post said the company
will set up a new division to provide and market pocketphone
services if the Washington tests succeed.</p>
<p>"We're not a company that likes to flip assets," he said.
"Our aim is to do this broadly and systematically in a way in
which we can have a sizable stance."</p>
<p>The Post is not alone. A growing number of companies are
either planning or have begun to erect networks that will
provide pocketphone services. In England, several companies
already provide a service called Personal Communications
Network, or PCN, that allows customers to place calls on
pocketphones. And several companies, including partnerships
involving regional Bell companies, have begun building
networks in England to provide two-way phone services.</p>
<p>In the U.S. the FCC has awarded about 20 licenses to test
"personal communications services" or PCS. Companies such as
APC, Millicom Inc. and Graphic Scanning Corp., have received
permission from the FCC to test their PCS systems at various
frequencies.</p>
<p>Nynex Corp. recently announced plans to install an adjunct
pocketphone-type system to its cellular network, using
network equipment from American Telephone & Telegraph Co. and
Qualcomm Inc.</p>
<p>Motorola Inc. plans a satellite-based service. The company
wants to offer portable-phone service through a network of
more than 70 low-orbit satellites by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>The Post and APC expect to begin testing the system by
year end and to have it working fully in suburban Maryland
and Virginia by the end of 1991.</p>
<p>The Washington test will involve transmission and
reception in two frequencies -- 900 MHz, which current
cellular networks use, and 1800-1900 MHz, Mr. Schelle said.</p>
<p>In the first stage, as many as 2,000 customers will get a
one-way service, with which they can place calls after
receiving a message on an attached pager. In the second
stage, expected to be available by the end of next year,
customers will get two-way service allowing them to send and
receive calls.</p>
