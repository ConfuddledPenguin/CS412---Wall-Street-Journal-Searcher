	<div class="article-body"><p>Employees had never seen the likes of the bash at
Materials Research Corp. last November. The host was Sony USA
Inc., the new owner of the troubled company. While the 500
guests nibbled nervously on sushi, sashimi, hot dogs and
hamburgers, two top Sony executives assured them their jobs
were safe.</p>
<p>As the party ended, the company gave each employee an
extra week's pay, a Sony Walkman and a copy of "Made in
Japan" by Akio Morita, chairman of Sony Corp., Sony USA's
parent.</p>
<p>More to the point, Materials Research is now flourishing.
Flush with millions in Sony capital, the Orangeburg, N.Y.,
maker of semiconductor equipment has hired 200 workers and
started developing three projects. Revenue is on the rise
again.</p>
<p>Materials Research isn't alone. Japanese companies bought
54 small U.S. firms in this year's first half, double that of
the first half of 1989, says KPMG Peat Marwick, a New
York-based accounting firm.</p>
<p>"Until we find a way to finance small technology companies
that need large sums of money, more and more entrepreneurs
will turn to Japan," says venture capitalist Glenn Mueller of
the Mayfield Fund in Menlo Park, Calif. Japanese buyers often
provide long-term capital that small companies can't find
here, he adds. Increasingly, traditional U.S. venture-capital
firms shy away from early-stage startup investments and other
risky deals.</p>
<p>Small U.S. concerns already work with Japanese investors
and suppliers. But the greatest potential impact begins when
the Japanese actually buy a U.S. concern.</p>
<p>Among other things, the acquisitions heighten fears of
some Americans that the Japanese are buying key U.S.
technology concerns to gain the upper hand in business and
trade. American workers often complain that their new
Japanese bosses don't involve them in key decisions. Others
say the Japanese tend to hire and fire Americans without the
concern shown at home to loyal Japanese employees.</p>
<p>But the managers at acquired companies say new Japanese
owners often take pains to minimize tensions and give
Americans a large degree of autonomy. "We're working on the
same development projects we began before the acquisition,"
says Sheldon Weinig, who founded Materials Research in 1958
and is still chairman and chief executive.</p>
<p>Materials Research financed itself for years through
equity and debt. But along with many semiconductor companies,
it fell out of favor with investors and lenders in the
mid-1980s.</p>
<p>In July 1989, after receiving a bid from a European
company, Mr. Weinig contacted Sony, with which it was
exploring joint ventures. In less than a week, Sony offered
to buy the firm for $58 million -- almost 50% above the
market price.</p>
<p>Since then, Sony has financed a major expansion of the
company's research and development efforts, the hiring of new
scientists and engineers and the construction of a new
materials plant in Japan. It also is paying back Materials
Research's $16 million loan from a bank syndicate.</p>
<p>And while Materials Research is working on a number of
Sony projects, there are few outward signs of Sony's
presence. The biggest one is a company store that sells the
entire Sony line at a discount.</p>
<p>Yet Japanese ownership does change life in many ways.
Three years ago, for instance, Fujitsu Ltd., the Japanese
computer maker, acquired Intellistor Inc., a Longmont, Colo.,
disk-drive designer.</p>
<p>Now Intellistor engineers regularly visit Fujitsu's U.S.
headquarters in San Jose, Calif., to discuss new designs and
projects. Many Intellistor employees also travel to Tokyo in
"an attempt to let them know how the Japanese company works
and get a sense of what our product needs are," a Fujitsu
official explains.</p>
<p>Employees crowd into an Intellistor six-week course on
Japanese culture; many also are learning Japanese.</p>
<p>Decision making also has taken on a Japanese flavor, says
Lewis Frauenfelder, Intellistor's founder and president.
"We're more consensus-oriented. More people who are involved
in a project get to decide on its direction."</p>
<p>When Intellistor moved into its new research facility in
May, the opening of the building was bicultural -- a
Western-style ribbon-cutting followed by a Japanese-style
christening with rice wine.</p>
<p>But American officials say outright interference has been
minimal. There are no Fujitsu supervisors at Intellistor.
Instead, two Japanese engineers act as liaisons between the
concerns. Though Fujitsu is its only customer, Intellistor
doesn't follow Japanese development standards; it generates
its own designs and blueprints.</p>
<p>Venture capitalists sold Intellistor because "they felt
they couldn't continue financing the company and still make a
profit," says Mr. Frauenfelder. Since then, Fujitsu has given
financial support, including $11 million for the research
facility.</p>
<p>Other U.S. concerns also say Japanese owners take pains to
minimize tensions. Before Toyota Motor Corp. completed its
$30 million acquisition of Bodine Aluminum Inc., a St. Louis
foundry, it spoke extensively to the state's governor and
other politicians to explain its long-term plans. Tokyo's
Clarion Co. Ltd. offered long-term contracts to managers at
McIntosh Laboratory Inc., Binghamton, N.Y., to persuade them
to stay. Clarion is buying the pricey sound-equipment maker
for $30 million.</p>
<p>To minimize disruptions, the Japanese often try to appoint
only their U.S. officials to boards of companies they buy.
Nichirei Corp., a large Japanese seafood processor, even
appointed outsiders to the board of Sea Watch International,
a Maryland food company it acquired in 1988.</p>
<p>Japanese purchasers "always ask what they can add to a
deal," says James Martens of Peers & Co., a New York
investment bank specializing in Japanese acquisitions of U.S.
firms. "Most Japanese acquisitions have been followed by an
infusion of capital or technology or both."</p>
<p>Indeed, many entrepreneurs say freedom from scouring the
U.S. markets for capital was among the biggest benefits they
gained by selling to the Japanese. Says Thomas Bologna,
president of Gen-Probe Inc., a San Diego biotechnology firm
purchased last year by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. of Tokyo:
"We can now concentrate on the task of building companies and
selling products."</p>
