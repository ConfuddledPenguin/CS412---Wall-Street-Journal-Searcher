	<p class="article-leader">PADERBORN, West Germany -- With a thud, the chief
executive of Nixdorf Computer AG lays a bulging white
notebook on his desk.
   It contains blueprints for one of the world computer
industry's biggest mergers: the scheduled Oct. 1 union of
West Germany's two largest computer makers, Nixdorf and the
Data and Information Systems division of electronics giant
Siemens AG.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The executive, Horst Nasko, flips through the pages, each
one a complex diagram of who will report to whom in the
merged organization's 27 geographical regions and 10 product
and service divisions. Planning the merger, first announced
Jan. 10, has occupied more than 100 planning committees.
"There's a lot of overtime in that book," Mr. Nasko says. But
he thinks it well worth the cost and effort: "It is better
that we be prepared."</p>
<p>There is good reason for the slow, careful preparation.
The combination, to be voted on today by Nixdorf shareholders
here, is slated to begin in perilous times with a mission to
become the first European computer company to play in the big
leagues of the world market against the industry's
technological and financial leaders from the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p>"Of all the European companies, the only one that could
feasibly become a strong competitor with European technology
would be Siemens-Nixdorf," says Martin Hingley, a European
industry analyst at International Data Corp., a Framingham,
Mass., market-research firm.</p>
<p>Other Europeans have aspired to be world-wide competitors.
But each has stumbled on some combination of weak finance,
insufficient economies of scale, bad strategy or uneven
technology. On the Continent, major European manufacturers
never managed more than a 25% market share during the 1980s
-- and they are losing even that now. France's Groupe Bull,
the closest European rival to Siemens and Nixdorf, and N.V.
Philips of the Netherlands appear likely to spend months
bailing red ink. Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. is
desperately trying to halt a three-year sales slump. And last
month, Britain's International Computers Ltd. threw in the
towel and agreed to merge with Japan's Fujitsu Ltd.</p>
<p>But Siemens Nixdorf Informationssysteme AG, or SNI as the
merged business is to be called, has plenty going for it. It
will be big: Had it been merged last year, the combined
businesses would have ranked second in the European computer
market after International Business Machines Corp. of the
U.S., and eighth in the world market. It will have an
impregnable home base in Germany, where it leads IBM in
several market segments. It will have deep pockets, as a
78%-owned affiliate of cash-rich Siemens. And its planned
product strategy seems on target: to sell specialized
software and services -- "solutions" in computer-marketing
jargon -- that use standardized computer hardware as much as
possible.</p>
<p>Yet the pitfalls are many. The company risks ending up as
a strong player in the European market but an also-ran in the
rest of the world. It will be dependent on other
manufacturers for some of its technology; for instance,
Japan's Fujitsu supplies its top-of-the-line mainframe
computers. It may also be meditating too much on its own
navel: So preoccupied do Siemens-Nixdorf officials appear
with the technicalities of their own merger, that they don't
appear interested in hunting other mergers to grow, says
industry analyst Peter Knox of Salomon Brothers Inc. "I would
expect the {Siemens-Nixdorf} merger process to take some
time, and it's going to stretch their management
capabilities," he says.</p>
<p>And the merged company will have to spend a lot of time
simply repairing Nixdorf's tattered business. The Siemens
data business is profitable, with net income for the year
ended Sept. 30 of about 250 million marks ($159.9 million) on
revenue of 5.4 billion marks, but Nixdorf's losses in
calendar 1989 swelled to 1.07 billion marks on revenue of
5.26 billion marks.</p>
<p>This year has been better for both companies: Siemens'
data division expects revenue growth of at least 20%, while
Mr. Nasko says Nixdorf's losses are diminishing, and its
orders at the end of July were only 2% behind year-earlier
levels.</p>
<p>But the biggest challenge of all will be combining the
widely disparate cultures of entrepreneurial Nixdorf and
bureaucratic Siemens. "In the first couple of months there
will be frictions -- this is normal," concedes Albrecht
Doehler, an executive director of the Siemens data division.</p>
<p>Since its 1958 founding in this north German town of
80,000, Nixdorf traded on a carefully crafted image as
leaner, faster and smarter than its two main competitors in
Germany, IBM and Siemens. Heinz Nixdorf, who died in 1987,
delighted in ridiculing the big boys: He was once quoted as
calling IBM a cow that ought to have been slaughtered long
ago. He focused on marketing, and with trendy sales
strategies Nixdorf posted nearly 20 consecutive years of
growth.</p>
<p>Siemens' computer division, by contrast, prided itself on
its technology and reliability as part of Europe's biggest
and richest electronics group. Everything it does is big. In
contrast to Nixdorf's emphasis on minicomputers, Siemens has
spent more than one billion marks to develop its own
mainframe range to compete with IBM's core business in
Germany.</p>
<p>But Nixdorf's rapid decline following its founder's death
forced the merger. Nixdorf misjudged market trends. And its
former, free-wheeling management style let costs balloon.
Salesmen, for instance, had too much freedom to negotiate
steep discounts with customers, says Nixdorf's Mr. Nasko. As
losses mounted, the list of potential buyers for Nixdorf
included Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Inc. of
the U.S. But Siemens won, Mr. Nasko says, partly because it
promised a complete merger of both businesses, rather than a
takeover putting Siemens managers at the top.</p>
<p>But feelings among Nixdorf employees remain mixed.
"Siemens is good, it's stable," says one of Nixdorf's
longest-serving employees, a bodyguard and driver to the late
Mr. Nixdorf. But how does he feel about the company losing
its independence? With one finger, he traces a teartrack down
his right cheek.</p>
