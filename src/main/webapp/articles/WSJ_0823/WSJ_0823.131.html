	<p class="article-leader">LAS VEGAS, Nev. -- ATI Medical Inc. said it expects to
report a fourth-quarter net loss of about $250,000, primarily
due to nonrecurring costs associated with the start-up of its
Americare subsidiary.
   For the fiscal year ended July 31, the company said it
will post net income of about $2.4 million, or 45 cents a
share, on record revenue of about $50 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The renter of medical equipment said the earnings, which
will be recorded officially in about six weeks, will be lower
than originally anticipated by the company. The expenses
connected to the Americare unit reduced earnings by about
$500,000, or six cents a share, it said.</p>
<p>In the year-earlier fourth quarter, ATI posted earnings of
$663,673, or 13 cents a share, on revenue of $10.2 million.
For all of fiscal 1989, the company reported earnings of $2.2
million, or 41 cents a share, on revenue of $39.1 million.</p>
<p>ATI said that while a lower hospital census in the last
three months of the fiscal year also affected operating
results, the company's total volume in July was at record
levels and ATI resumed profitability during that month. The
company said its cash position remains strong.</p>
<p>"Given the way our stock has moved, we wanted to reassure
people that it was only one {troubled} quarter . . . that it
isn't a disaster," Paul E. Stevenson, ATI's president and
chief executive officer, said in an interview. In American
Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, ATI closed at
$5.875 a share, up 50 cents.</p>
<p>Despite the temporary disruption in earnings growth, Mr.
Stevenson added, ATI should continue to show profit
improvement in fiscal 1991, when revenue should reach at
least $60 million, a 20% jump from 1990.</p>
