	<p class="article-leader">NEAR THE IRAQI BORDER, Saudi Arabia -- U.S. Army
paratroopers are scheduled to hold today what is believed to
be the largest exercise for ground troops since American
forces arrived here at the beginning of the month.
   The exercise, important to demonstrate that thousands of
U.S. troops can work together in the harsh desert
environment, got the go-ahead after Saudi leaders reversed
their initial opposition to such large-scale troop movements,
according to U.S. military officials. The cautious and
tradition-bound Saudis have been reluctant to allow
large-scale maneuvers by U.S. troops until now.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Approval for the exercise came this past week as the
Saudis also made more airfield and training areas available
to U.S. forces, especially those protecting vital oil,
shipping and other industrial facilities in the northeast
region.</p>
<p>"There is still some reluctance by the Saudis about where
we can go and where we can train," said Maj. Baxter Ennis,
the spokesman for the Army's 82nd Airborne Division from Fort
Bragg, N.C. But, he said, the situation has "improved
dramatically" in recent days.</p>
<p>When Defense Secretary Dick Cheney visited troops last
weekend, Col. Gene Cole, the division's aviation commander,
praised the Saudi government's cooperation. "We've had
excellent support" from the Saudi military, Col. Cole told
the secretary, adding that his troops were "totally confident
that we can do the mission."</p>
<p>But a visit with an Army platoon handling anti-tank tow
weapons in the 115 degree desert heat, shows that some day
and night exercises still are being blocked by Saudi
opposition. "As they start giving us more freedom to
operate," said one soldier, "our troops will get better
acclimated to living in the desert."</p>
<p>This past week, cargo planes received permission to use
additional landing strips throughout the country to speed up
the flow of men and war materials, according to U.S. military
officials.</p>
<p>A group of reporters watched a giant long-range C-5 cargo
aircraft land at one of those isolated strips, which also had
dozens of the Army's anti-tank helicopters and combat
vehicles lined up on the tarmac guarded by U.S. troops.</p>
<p>While the sprawling airfield has a six-story control tower
and huge storage buildings, it isn't near any major highway
and is difficult to spot among the rolling sand dunes.</p>
<p>Military officials here declined to provide details, and
reporters are restricted from disclosing the specifics of
such bases and exercises.</p>
<p>In many units, only about half of the soldiers have had
the opportunity to actually train in the Saudi desert,
according to officers and enlisted men. The troops are
conserving ammunition and missiles by not doing any actual
firing during exercises. Even the vehicles that the 82nd
Airborne brought into the area seem strangely out of place:
Their khaki-green color must be changed by slapping on mud or
some other type of camouflage to make them blend into the
desert.</p>
<p>"We're oriented toward the jungle and city warfare, not
the desert," one soldier told reporters with a shrug.</p>
<p>But by other measures, the U.S. deployment is proceeding
fairly smoothly. The American military presence has grown so
large that convoys of Army vehicles mingle freely with the
cars being driven on the coastal road that links some of the
country's major oil and chemical facilities.</p>
<p>Marines and some of the Army's most potent tanks are
expected to replace paratroopers in some forward positions.
One 19-year-old private from Tulsa, Okla., summed it up this
way: "The Saudis built all the airfields, underground bunkers
and bases necessary to protect their country. Now, we're
putting in U.S. troops to get the most out of that
investment."</p>
