	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- For U.S. energy watchdogs, Saddam Hussein is
the best thing to happen in more than a decade.
   Once again, the nation's addiction to foreign oil is at
center stage. The battered nuclear power industry hopes for a
revival. Environmental groups call for more conservation,
more mass transit, and new provisions forcing auto companies
to boost gasoline mileage. Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma wants
tax incentives for oil producers; Sens. Frank Murkowski and
Ted Stevens of Alaska want to drill in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge. The Florida Solar Energy Industries
Association has even nominated Saddam Hussein for its "Solar
Man of the Year Award."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But what will come of this new burst of oil-saving
activism? Unfortunately, not much.</p>
<p>The latest effort to wean the U.S. from imported oil is
almost certain to fail, due to powerful political currents
running against it. An environmental movement that's stronger
than ever, a worsening budget deficit, a White House
dominated by a free-market ideology, and intense regional
disputes in Congress will all conspire to block any
broad-based effort to reduce the nation's need for foreign
oil. And in the end, Americans will demonstrate once again
their chronic unwillingness to suffer short-term pain for
long-term gain.</p>
<p>"One has to be skeptical on the basis of past history"
that America will now fix its energy problems, says James
Schlesinger, President Carter's energy secretary. "This is a
society that has powerful antibodies against a consistent and
persistent energy policy."</p>
<p>Barring a catastrophic new loss of oil reserves from the
Mideast, the risk is that U.S. dependence on foreign oil will
climb from 50% today to 75% by the end of the decade.</p>
<p>A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll illustrates the
American public's ambivalence. Despite the crisis in the
Middle East, 57% of the public still oppose efforts to
construct more nuclear power plants. And 62% oppose taxing
gasoline to encourage conservation. On the question of
loosening restrictions on offshore oil drilling, public
opinion is more divided, with 48% in favor and 42% opposed.</p>
<p>For now, the greatest obstacle to most efforts to cut
energy dependence is the environmental movement.
Environmentalists have already shown they can close down such
substitutes for foreign oil as the Shoreham nuclear power
plant in Long Island, N.Y., and offshore oil drilling in
California and Florida. In a bow to their political clout,
President Bush has tied his own hands by putting several
large offshore lease areas off-limits for 10 years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the White House is resisting proposals to
mandate energy savings. Such measures are popular in the
abstract -- The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that
80% of voters favor "tougher conservation measures." But when
it comes down to particulars, such as forcing car makers to
turn out more fuel-efficient cars, the politics get more
difficult. When the department finally got approval for its
modest list of energy-saving ideas recently, President Bush
kept his distance, leaving the department to unveil the plan
on its own.</p>
<p>Asked at his news conference yesterday in Kennebunkport,
Maine, why he hadn't called on the American people to
conserve energy, Mr. Bush quickly responded: "I call upon
Americans to conserve." But the president added that,
although it was "a good time to conserve," he didn't want to
panic people and didn't believe the circumstances required
people to cancel vacation plans or take other drastic steps.
Indeed, Mr. Bush stated that he didn't intend to curtail use
of his speedboat during his holiday in Maine.</p>
<p>With a Texan at the helm, the White House is more willing
to contemplate new tax breaks to spur the domestic oil
industry. But such measures run smack into another obstacle:
a burgeoning budget deficit. With higher oil prices,
increased defense spending and slower growth pushing that
deficit ever higher, any proposal that increases spending or
drains revenue is likely to be a loser.</p>
<p>And if that's not enough to kill energy-saving ideas,
Congress remains hamstrung by intense regional and
special-interest disputes that pit oil-consuming states
against oil-producing ones. With an election approaching, the
odds for that rivalry producing a sensible energy policy are
slim.</p>
<p>"This is where Washington is at its worst," says Thomas
Griscom, formerly a Reagan White House aide and longtime aide
to former Sen. Howard Baker (R., Tenn.). "There's not a lot
of people willing to set a goal that you won't achieve for
four to five years because, politically, it's hard to get any
credit back home when you're running for re-election."</p>
<p>Congress will certainly make a stab at enacting oil-saving
measures when it returns in September. In the wake of the
Iraqi crisis, members will see an opportunity for action. "I
would misread Congress completely if I didn't expect them to
come back and to make this a major focal point," says deputy
energy secretary and former Louisiana congressman Henson
Moore. "We'll hear a lot of speeches. There will be a lot of
hearings. There will be a lot of advice given to the
administration."</p>
<p>Moreover, there will be several key opportunities that
will test policy makers' determination to go beyond speeches
and take action. But in each case, the obstacles facing these
measures illustrate how difficult it will be for Washington
to produce a coherent oil-saving policy.</p>
<p>The Energy Department, for instance, plans to spend this
fall on a previously arranged effort to devise a
comprehensive National Energy Strategy. The exercise might
seem an opportunity to devise a sweeping battle plan for
energy security. But already the effort has run into internal
ideological conflicts that suggest it will have only modest
results.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, when the department was drawing up a
report on a series of public hearings to help prepare an
energy strategy, the White House sent a pre-emptive warning
that the final strategy would stress free-market ideas rather
than government activism. Budget Director Richard Darman and
White House Economist Michael Boskin maneuvered in internal
meetings to force the Energy Department to declare pointedly,
in the preface to its report on the public hearings, that the
Bush administration's policies will focus above all on the
use of market forces to regulate energy supply and demand.</p>
<p>Such ideological pressures, coupled with the meek
energy-conservation plan the administration offered after
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, already has critics expecting a
modest rather than a grandiose energy strategy from President
Bush. Mike Matz, Washington director of the Sierra Club's
public lands program, predicts the strategy is likely to
endorse some steps toward greater energy efficiency but "for
the most part it will endorse business as usual."</p>
<p>In Congress this fall, lawmakers will be considering a
measure that would force auto makers to produce fleets that
average 40 miles to a gallon of gasoline by the year 2001, a
sharp increase in fuel efficiency from today's average of
27.5 miles per gallon for new cars. The bill, offered by Sen.
Richard Bryan (D., Nev.), was first offered as an
environmental measure designed to cut auto emissions thought
to heat the atmosphere, but now it is attracting interest as
an energy-conservation measure that could save 2.8 million
barrels of oil a day by 2005 -- more than the U.S. has been
importing from the Persian Gulf.</p>
<p>But the Bush administration already has spoken out against
the bill. And auto companies fiercely oppose it, arguing that
they wouldn't be able to build the bigger cars that Americans
want for their safety features.</p>
<p>An even tougher bill has been introduced in the House, but
it hasn't gone anywhere because it has been headed off by
Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who is a close ally of
auto companies and who heads the Energy and Commerce
Committee, which would have to pass such a measure.</p>
<p>Oil companies are hoping that the Persian Gulf crisis has
given them a lever to persuade Congress to open Alaska's
national wildlife refuge for drilling. That could be a
promising area for oil-exploration. But oil from the Exxon
Valdez spill is still on Alaska's rocky beaches, and
environmental groups in and out of Alaska will continue to
pose a formidable obstacle. Does the threat from Saddam
Hussein make environmentalists more open to oil drilling
there? "The answer to that clearly is no," says former Sen.
Gaylord Nelson, counselor to the Wilderness Society.
"Obviously those who want to drill in the arctic and every
other place in the country will use any excuse they can think
of to open up every place they can find for drilling
regardless of environmental consequences."</p>
<p>The Bush administration, with Congress's blessing, has
already given a 30% boost to research into renewable energy
sources. But the effort pales when compared with those of
other countries, such as Japan.</p>
<p>Renewable-energy advocates are calling for a much more
concerted government effort. But the budget deficit will
undermine those arguments, as even the advocates acknowledge.
"We've got a massive deficit, it's costing them millions of
dollars a day to keep troops out there," says solar-industry
lobbyist Scott Sklar. "To say I ought to have a few hundred
million dollars more . . . to bring in conservation and
alternative fuels and that sort of stuff, I think {President
Bush} is going to be reticent to do it."</p>
<p>With such formidable obstacles, energy consumers will have
to suffer a bigger shock before the U.S. public policy
apparatus takes meaningful action. For now, voters seem more
incensed over alleged price-gouging by oil companies than
upset at America's energy-security dilemma. Says Robert
Teeter, a Republican pollster and longtime adviser to
President Bush, "I just don't think we're far enough into
this yet to know how public opinion will be affected."</p>
