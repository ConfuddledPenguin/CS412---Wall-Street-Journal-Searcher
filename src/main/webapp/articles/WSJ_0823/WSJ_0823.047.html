	<p class="article-leader">Even if all lawyers should not be killed, most should
probably be isolated from the conduct of foreign relations.
Trained in a system that requires consensus and civil order,
they tend to confront barbarian outrages with impotent
legalities, applying the softest tools to the hardest stone.
   But the call to international law is not always an attempt
to dignify capitulation by the construction of illusion. In
concert with a great array of forces such as the U.S. and its
allies are now assembling in the Gulf, even the pathetic
legalisms that give meaning to the word toothless can spring
to the life for which they were originally intended. And,
just as finely crafted resolutions and declarations are of
little value unaccompanied by real power, real power is
improperly realized absent finely crafted declarations and
resolutions.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The number of Saddam Hussein's hostages and
hostages-in-waiting ranges from a hundred or so to almost a
million, depending upon whether or not you are Egyptian. As
Saddam's assets dwindle he turns to local traditions such as
the refusal to distinguish between combatants and
noncombatants. Though most Westerners find this as
incomprehensible and difficult as the urge to martyrdom, we
have our own traditions that, for our enemies, can be
similarly threatening. To punish the transgressions we most
abhor, we have created institutions of long memory, noted
determination, and infinite patience.</p>
<p>The president has wisely avoided precipitate action while
military and political activity increase the range of his
options. Reinforcing Saudi Arabia and choking Iraq was the
best initial strategy, and until new opportunities arise it
remains so. Nonetheless, it accentuates the role of the
hostages. Mr. Bush has said that he will hold Iraqis
responsible for the Americans among them, but he would do
well to be more specific. An uncertain threat can mean
nuclear retaliation or absolutely nothing. Iraq should be
told that the U.S. and its allies will pursue and try war
criminals. Every soldier under Saddam, from generals to
privates, should know what we have done before and will do
again, that when it was done it was not easy, that we
persevered through 50 million deaths, that half a century
later we are hunting down the criminals, that if men lived
1,000 years we would be hunting these criminals still. If the
implication they draw from such a declaration is that Baghdad
will be overrun as was Berlin, then that implication should
stand.</p>
<p>Early in the Second World War, Roosevelt and Churchill
insistently made the punishment of war crimes one of the aims
of victory, and many of the guiding declarations issued in
the war years were emphatic: The St. James, Moscow, and
Potsdam declarations, the last of which stated with
compelling simplicity that "Stern justice shall be meted out
to all war criminals including those who have visited
cruelties upon our prisoners."</p>
<p>In October 1943, the Allies established The United Nations
War Crimes Commission as an institution for the practical
application of the near universal sentiment against war
crimes. The effectiveness of such steps is hard to judge, but
it is impossible to ignore the difference in treatment
experienced by Allied prisoners of the Reich, whose
governments made clear what they would do after the war they
had the potential of winning, and others, notably the Jews,
who had no such shield. No guarantee exists that similar
steps will deter across the exquisitely delineated cultural
lines that separate Iraq and the West, especially in light of
Japanese treatment of Allied prisoners. Still, Japan's
Chinese prisoners fared far worse, and American and British
exhortations were directed mainly at Germany. Perhaps had a
similar tactic been used in regard to Japan, history would
have been slightly different.</p>
<p>One of the problems of the Nuremberg tribunal, The
Subsequent Proceedings, which followed, and the International
Military Tribunal for the Far East was that though little
they affirmed in law was new, they had to break new ground in
its application. Now, however, precedent and procedure are
clearly established. Though Iraq has already violated the
Fourth 1949 Geneva Conventions -- in deporting prisoners,
taking hostages, discriminating among captives according to
nationality, and using civilians to shield military targets
-- we are concerned above all with the hostages' survival and
the length of their captivity. The more specific the demands
and threats in this regard, the better.</p>
<p>Were the nations whose citizens are prisoners in Iraq to
offer in the United Nations a resolution, backed by the
declarations of their parliaments, to the effect that they
will hold each and every individual to account for the fate
of the hostages, the Iraqi security and military apparatus
that blindly follows Saddam's orders might hesitate. Saddam
might discover a certain viscosity in his chain of command.
The desire to overthrow him might become simultaneously more
fervent and more logical. Lives might be saved.</p>
<p>In isolation, a U.N. resolution is worth little more than
the collected speeches of Cyrus Vance, but in combination
with the armies and fleets now gathering in the desert and
upon nearby seas, an unambiguous statement of intent would be
far more than a misplaced legality. Not only might it be of
interest to the Iraqis, but it would elucidate our aims,
principles and values, make clearer our purpose, and solidify
our resolve. In addition, it would be yet another of the many
active responses to the crisis. When Iran held our hostages
we were debilitated not so much by the arduous passage of
time as by the days and weeks that passed during which
absolutely nothing was done. Americans are impatient. We need
action each day, even if this means that our political
leadership must actively guide us through the great
difficulty of waiting. Action each day. And why not? Saddam
Hussein began with the initiative. We have wrested it from
him, and we must keep it from him.</p>
