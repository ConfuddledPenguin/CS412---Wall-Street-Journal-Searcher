	<p class="article-leader">In 1983 the U.S. Navy, fearing trouble in the Gulf,
decided it needed a way to move troops and gear quickly from
ships onto harborless desert coasts. It placed an order for
pontoon causeways, which are simple, low-tech affairs --
essentially boxlike metal cans strung together to float
between ship and shore.
   Then came trouble. Although the pontoon contractor had
charged plenty, it fell far behind schedule. Worse, the end
product flunked specs. The square corners of the cans kept
diverging from a true 90-degree angle, and the bolt holes did
not line up; only months later was it found that the factory
floor had not been level. Workers had tried to bang the
objects into shape with a sledgehammer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Switch suppliers? No chance: The manufacturer was "wired"
politically. So the Navy went right on buying from Wedtech
Corp. in New York's depressed lower Bronx.</p>
<p>As reporter Marilyn Thompson tells it in "Feeding the
Beast: How Wedtech Became the Most Corrupt Little Company in
America" (Scribners, 325 pages, $22.50), John Mariotta and
Fred Neuberger had been running a little tool-and-die shop
when Mr. Neuberger stumbled across the 8(a) program of racial
preference in federal contracting. What a boon]</p>
<p>"Do you mind being a minority?" he asked his partner.
"What do you mean, minority?" Mr. Mariotta shot back. "Puerto
Rican." "I am Puerto Rican. What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>He learned quickly enough. The setaside program, a cross
between affirmative action and industrial policy, enabled the
once-obscure company to grab contract after contract from an
often reluctant Pentagon, swelling from revenue of $1.5
million a year in 1978 to $117 million in 1985. As the
"model" client of the federal Small Business Administration,
it also got heaps of grants and loan guarantees, along with
help from local governments.</p>
<p>Wedtech played its hard-luck Bronx location for maximum
symbolic value, giving off the odor of sanctity the way some
magazines give off perfume from scent strips. Mr. Mariotta
kept asserting, quite implausibly, that he had saved its
entire (largely immigrant) work force from the welfare rolls,
and thus was doing society a favor by taking set-aside work.</p>
<p>Almost at once the company embarked on an audacious career
of forgeries, perjuries and briberies. From a phony billing
scheme, based on applying Wite-Out to genuine invoices, it
graduated to cooking of books and stock manipulation.</p>
<p>Members of Congress made themselves helpful. At one point
New York Democratic Congressman Mario Biaggi demanded an
astounding 5% of any contract revenue he helped steer the
firm, on top of stock. Wedtech forked over $50,000 to a
family law firm to have the chairman of the House Small
Business Committee quash an investigation, and later paid
another $50,000 for a promise to have him start a probe of a
rival firm. Ethics charges were a favorite weapon against
those who stood in Wedtech's way.</p>
<p>The firm was likewise adept at deploying those other
uncontrolled forms of modern armament, lawsuits and bias
charges. It sued Ms. Thompson and her newspaper, the New York
Daily News, and menaced Barron's over a critical editorial.
Wedtech lobbyist E. Robert Wallach charged that by breaking
the corruption story the press had jeopardized hundreds of
minority jobs and had thus shown itself to be racist.</p>
<p>Mr. Wallach, fatefully, also sought to amplify the firm's
"general ally structure" by exploiting an old and close
friendship with Attorney General Edwin Meese, his political
antipode but apparently an indulgent listener. And the firm
hired a lobbyist with Reagan White House connections, which
may have been its undoing.</p>
<p>"SBA officials were accustomed to being strong-armed" by
Congress and local officials, but "White House interest was
virtually unheard of," writes James Traub in another
treatment of this shabby saga, "Too Good to Be True: The
Outlandish Story of Wedtech" (Doubleday, 370 pages, $21.95).</p>
<p>Throughout, Wedtech was suffused with a sense of
grievance, "a sense of injured merit," as Mr. Traub puts it.
Merit? If not superior competence, what kind of merit?
Incredibly, Wedtech insiders felt a moral superiority, as
victims deserving redress from an unfair society. They
squandered fortunes gambling and ordering Mercedeses by the
six-pack, yet went on swearing they were "socially
disadvantaged."</p>
<p>Full of lurid situations and ripe frauds, the Wedtech
affair is not entirely well served by either of the two
books. Ms. Thompson's great virtue is that (after a shaky,
clumsy opening) she hews closely to the plot line. Events
unfold at a smart clip and the reader grasps the overall
shape of the story.</p>
<p>While Ms. Thompson holds back from guessing at the wider
meaning of it all, Mr. Traub keeps halting the action to
deliver op-ed pieties about the Reagan years as an era of
greed. Yet he does a fine job describing how the slush fund
worked and how the prosecutors built their case.</p>
<p>Oddly, Mr. Traub seems to blame this disaster of
uncompetitive procurement on laissez-faire politics, a thesis
that itself cannot be made to float except by pounding the
material with a mallet. In point of fact, free-market
Reaganites tried to abolish the Wedtech-promoting SBA and
Economic Development Administration, and some of the bolder
ones questioned the setaside program. Soldiers who entrust
their lives to the quality of American military equipment may
question it too.</p>
