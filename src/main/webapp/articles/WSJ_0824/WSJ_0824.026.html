	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Atlantic Richfield Co. said it is boosting
gasoline prices in some markets, ending a two-week-old price
freeze that began when President Bush requested that oil
companies set prices responsibly following Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
   Arco said it would make increases averaging 2.5 cents per
gallon in certain markets due to dwindling gasoline supplies
at its service stations. In the past two weeks, Arco's
regular unleaded gasoline has been selling for as much as 13
cents below the general market, sales have increased over
19%, and more than 160 stations a day are running out of gas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Earlier this week, Arco said it was raising the price of
its diesel and jet fuel.</p>
<p>The company said it will limit gasoline price adjustments
to crude-oil price changes occuring since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. "The spread between Arco's wholesale gasoline prices
and crude-oil market prices will not exceed the spread in
place during July, the month before the Iraqi invasion," said
George H. Babikian, president of Arco Products Co., the
company's marketing and refining division.</p>
