	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s former mergers
chief, Leon Black, is part of a group that bought 3,750,000
shares of Class A stock in Fruit of the Loom Inc. from Farley
Inc.
   Mr. Black's role was disclosed in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing by FL Management, an investment
advisory firm headed by Mr. Black and three other former
Drexel employees, John Hannan, Arthur Bilger and Craig Cogut.
The group's holding amounts to 7% of Fruit of the Loom's
stock.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Black group is investing money on behalf of several
French institutions, which put up the cash to buy the Fruit
of the Loom stock, Mr. Hannan said in an interview. The
French institutions formally made their investment as Land
Free Investment Ltd.</p>
<p>Farley previously entered into a put option agreement that
gives Land Free Investment the right to require Farley to
purchase its Fruit of the Loom stock, under certain
conditions, at an exercise price of $15.54 between July 12
and July 15, 1991.</p>
<p>The filing said the purchases were made for investment
reasons, and Mr. Hannan said the group didn't have any
present intention to increase its holdings. Mr. Black, while
at Drexel, was a regular adviser to Farley Inc.'s chairman,
William Farley.</p>
<p>The filing also disclosed that Messrs. Bilger, Black and
Cogut have an indirect interest in 3,660,000 Class A Fruit of
the Loom shares which were previously acquired through
partnerships that are partners in Champlain Associates. In
addition, Messrs. Black and Cogut have an indirect interest
in 141,153 shares of Class A stock owned by Wicklow
Investment Associates, in which Mr. Cogut is a general
partner.</p>
<p>Mr. Black also directly owns 124,000 Class A shares and
Mr. Cogut owns 34,264 Class A shares.</p>
