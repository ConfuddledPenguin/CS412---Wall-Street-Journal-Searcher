	<p class="article-leader">How many lawyers does it take to run a bar association?
Five, provided they are Utah Supreme Court Justices.
   In an unprecedented ruling, the Utah Supreme Court put the
5,000-member Utah State Bar in what amounts to a kind of
receivership after finding the bar was mired in a growing
budget deficit with no clear plan to extricate itself.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>An audit found that in each of the past five fiscal years,
the bar spent as much as 30% more money than it received in
dues -- which have been increased by about 90% over the past
four years.</p>
<p>Petitioned by angry lawyers, the state Supreme Court
ordered the bar to cut its expenses by about 15%, and forever
desist from deficit spending and short-term borrowing against
dues revenue.</p>
<p>"It's about time," says Brian M. Barnard, a Salt Lake City
lawyer who is something of a bar gadfly. Two years ago, Mr.
Barnard filed suit against the bar in federal court, claiming
his mandatory dues were being spent on "frivolous things that
are nonessential to the practice of law."</p>
<p>His suit is still pending, but Mr. Barnard says he may
withhold his claims now that the Supreme Court has acted.</p>
<p>Mr. Barnard says the bar's most frivolous expenditure was
the construction three years ago of a $3.5 million "Law and
Justice Center," which serves as the bar's headquarters. The
building was also designed to house facilities for
out-of-court legal arbitration sessions.</p>
<p>Says Mr. Barnard: "That was just a ruse. If you want to do
arbitration, you can get a free room at the public library.
The building was just a way to help inflate the egos of the
bar commissioners."</p>
<p>The bar's public relations consultant, John Becker,
bristles at Mr. Barnard's charge, and points out the building
has been praised by the American Bar Association as a
prototype facility and program "to make the system of justice
more open to the public."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the bar still owes money for construction of
the building, partly because private donations to the project
fell short of what the bar anticipated, and because some
lawyers who pledged money to help pay for construction later
reneged on their pledges.</p>
<p>Mr. Barnard calls the situation "lamentable," and worries
that it creates a negative image. "If you're looking for a
lawyer for some advice in a financial matter, maybe it's
relevant how they mind their own store," he says.</p>
