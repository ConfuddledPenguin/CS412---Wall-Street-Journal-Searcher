	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Shrugging off the bad news
that's driving down the German stock and bond markets, the
mark soared to a record high against the staggering dollar.
   In New York trading yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.5400
marks, its lowest level since the West German currency was
created in 1948, before climbing fractionally to 1.5444 marks
late in the day, compared with 1.5590 marks late Wednesday.
At the official fixing in Frankfurt yesterday, the dollar had
been pegged at 1.5432 marks, down more than a pfennig from
Wednesday. Traders here expect the trend to continue, with
some predicting the dollar may fall below 1.50 marks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At mid-morning in Tokyo Friday, the dollar was quoted at
146.08 yen, up from 145.88 yen at the close there Thursday.
Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.5515 marks, down
from Thursday's Tokyo close of 1.5564 marks.</p>
<p>The threat of war in the Mideast and $30-a-barrel oil, if
anything, appear to be helping the German currency thrive.
Even Bonn's own problems such as the soaring costs of
unification and fears about inflation, which have sent German
equity and bond markets reeling, haven't damped enthusiasm
for the mark.</p>
<p>Currency experts agree that the mark, along with a handful
of other European currencies, has replaced -- at least for
now -- the dollar in its traditional role as the haven for
investors in times of crisis. Currency traders consider West
Germany better insulated from oil-price increases than the
U.S. or Japan. The Swiss franc and sterling, which has the
status of a petrocurrency, have fared even better than the
mark.</p>
<p>The dollar also fell to a new low against the Swiss franc
in New York yesterday: It was quoted late in the day at
1.2553 francs, down from 1.2780 francs late Wednesday. The
dollar's previous low against the franc, reached Jan. 4,
1988, was 1.2675 francs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the pound climbed to $1.9555 from $1.9240 late
Wednesday. Against the yen, the dollar slipped to 146.15 yen
from 146.30 yen.</p>
<p>If the strong mark has West German exporters feeling the
pinch, they can expect little relief in the form of interest
rate cuts or other intervention from the Bundesbank. In fact,
the Bundesbank sees the strong mark as a help in keeping
inflation in check by depressing the price of imports. At the
same time, it expects the effect on exporters to be offset by
surging demand from East Germany.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve, meanwhile, pressured by the Bush
administration to hold down U.S. interest rates lest an
increase hurt economic growth, has shown little inclination
to intervene, since the weak dollar helps shrink U.S. trade
deficits by making exports cheaper.</p>
<p>"It's no secret that we see this {the strong mark} as
working to our advantage," says one Bundesbank official. The
rise in oil prices comes at a time when Germany faces an
inflationary threat from the increasing amount of funds that
Bonn is pumping into East Germany to support the East's
crumbling economy.</p>
<p>Some analysts, in fact, say such inflation fears may
pressure the German central bank to increase interest rates.
And speculation of a West German increase while U.S. rates
stay steady has contributed to the mark's strength.</p>
<p>Further jumps in oil prices plus the costs of East German
unification could boost German inflation to more than 3% in
the coming months, from 2.4% currently, says Geoffrey Dennis,
chief international economist for James Capel & Co. in
London. That, in turn, could push the Bundesbank to raise
interest rates "by the end of the year," he says.</p>
<p>Prof. Ruediger Pohl, who is on the five-member panel of
economists regularly advising the Bonn government, observes
that short-term market interest rates are close to the
Bundesbank's 8% Lombard rate, under which banks borrow
short-term funds. The Lombard, two full points above the
discount rate, serves as the upper reference point for German
money-market rates.</p>
<p>"I can imagine that the Bundesbank might want to create a
little more upward maneuvering room" by lifting the Lombard
and thus allowing market rates to drift higher," Prof. Pohl
said. "Many things depend on what happens in the Gulf, but
the inflation risks from East Germany are greater than many
imagine," he said.</p>
<p>Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl declared in July that
the central bank's timing for monetary policy moves isn't
influenced by electoral politics. Yet Bonn officials assert
that Chancellor Helmut Kohl would take a dim view of a rate
increase shortly before the all-German elections in December.
"Particularly," adds Prof. Pohl, "when the government still
insists that the costs are manageable."</p>
<p>Although West German shares have joined the global drop in
equity markets, investors pulling out of the stock market are
remaining in mark interest-bearing accounts for one of the
best interest-rate margins anywhere.</p>
<p>Analysts agree, however, that the dollar could stage a
comeback if there were a quick resolution of the Mideast
conflict, a brisk reversal in oil prices and a resurgence in
the U.S. economy -- preferably without U.S. interest-rate
cuts. Until then, the dollar is a bad bet.</p>
<p>"Basically, the dollar's fall hasn't ended," says Michael
Koch, treasurer of the Bank of America's Frankfurt branch.
"We're going to see DM1.50 before its over. Before that you
can't expect the Bundesbank to step in {with intervention}.
It's not in their interest."</p>
<p>But there are risks. With Bonn's borrowing requirement
multiplying to support East Germany, interest rates should
remain high whatever the Bundesbank does. Tighter credit
could hamper Germany's tricky economic adjustment after
unification on Oct. 3 by reining in growth and lifting the
price of crucial industrial investment. The result could
further pummel West German equity and bond markets.</p>
<p>Even as the mark rose yesterday, West German shares
tracked the world-wide drop in equities. The DAX Index of
West German shares plunged another 54.76 points, or 3.4%, to
end at 1520.34.</p>
<p>Even a previous day's statement by Kuwaiti Finance
Minister Sheik Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah that he has instructed
West German banks to increase Kuwait's holdings in West
German equity failed to spur investor confidence in equities.</p>
<p>But with a real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rate of
about 6.6%, or the difference between the current 9% one-year
money market rate and July's 2.4% inflation rate, the mark
remains king.</p>
<p>"It's one of the many puzzles at the moment," says Mr.
Dennis of James Capel. "The main explanation is that the
equity market is being pressured by factors that favor the
currency."</p>
<p>Separately, on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
for current delivery settled at $412 an ounce, up $1.
Estimated volume was a heavy six million ounces.</p>
<p>In early trading in Hong Kong Friday, gold was quoted at
$411.05 an ounce.</p>
