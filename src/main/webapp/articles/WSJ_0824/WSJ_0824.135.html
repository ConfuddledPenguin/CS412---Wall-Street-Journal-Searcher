	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Some 3,000 dissident Southern Baptists are
discussing plans to withhold millions of dollars in annual
contributions from the Southern Baptist Convention, in what
some religious experts see as a first step toward their
pulling out of America's largest Protestant denomination
altogether.
   The Baptists, who are holding a three-day meeting in
Atlanta, represent the moderate faction of the denomination.
In recent years, they have become increasingly angered at the
conservative fundamentalist faction that has ruled the
denomination.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In discussions currently under way, the moderates are
proposing to set up a trust fund into which their churches
would funnel the money that is now being sent to the
denomination's coffers in Nashville, Tenn. The trust fund
would then spend the money on the moderates' own causes, such
as a possible new seminary. Using the trust fund, they could
bypass causes supported by the denomination's fundamentalist
leaders, such as the creation of a new religious right lobby
in Washington.</p>
<p>The plan poses a direct threat to the denomination's
financial health -- and its conservative political clout --
because moderate churches have traditionally contributed far
more money to Southern Baptists headquarters than have
fundamentalist churches. Moderates estimate they contribute
at least 60%. This year's budget is about $137 million.</p>
<p>The denomination's president, the Rev. Morris Chapman,
couldn't be reached for comment, nor could the denomination's
top financial officers. However, in a statement issued last
week, several top Southern Baptist leaders strongly warned
churches not to stop sending donations to headquarters,
warning that a lack of funds could lead to mass layoffs and
the shutdown of programs.</p>
<p>Since fundamentalists took control of the denomination in
1979, moderates have charged that they have not been given a
fair voice in denomination affairs. Those who don't hold
certain conservative political and religious views -- such as
favoring school prayer, strictly opposing abortion, upholding
a literal interpretation of the Bible -- are penalized. They
have been shut out of leadership positions, and some have
even been fired.</p>
<p>Angry at that situation, some moderates over the past year
have responded by cutting back on their contributions. As a
result, the denomination has had to curtail projects and lay
off some employees. In the event of an outright financial
rebellion, the denomination could find itself perilously
short on cash to support its vast missionary force and six
seminaries. The financial setback could also badly hurt the
denomination's powerful image as the religious right
powerhouse, an image that prompted conservative politicians
to court leading Baptist preachers and consider their
fundamentalist views in the 1980s.</p>
<p>In addition, a declaration of financial independence by
moderates would inevitably generate momentum "toward the
forming of a new denomination," said Glenn Hinson, a
professor of church history at Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Louisville, Ky., who is attending the meeting.
Others said they expected the moderates to break from the
denomination as early as next year.</p>
<p>One of the meeting's organizers, the Rev. William
Scarborough, pastor of National Heights Baptist Church in
Fayetteville, Ga., said the possibility of a schism seems to
appeal mostly to younger Baptists. "But for people like
myself, who have served in the Southern Baptist Convention
all our lives, it's really hard to think of going with
another church," he said.</p>
