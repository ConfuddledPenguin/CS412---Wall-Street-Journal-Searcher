	<p class="article-leader">DEAUVILLE, France -- "Good news]" cried Didier Krainc,
striding across the horse-racing grounds here last Saturday.
"The Arabs will be buying."
   Mr. Krainc, the marketing manager for the French
Thoroughbred Sales Agency, was doing his best to stir
enthusiasm into a glum and anxious crowd of horse breeders
and owners before the yearling sale began that evening. For
the most part, his audience remained unconvinced.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I'd rather be a gold trader than a horse trader at the
moment," said one despondent trainer after Mr. Krainc had
passed.</p>
<p>So far, the pessimists appear to be justified. With Iraq's
Saddam Hussein facing off against a growing multinational
force in the Middle East, few Arabs seem inclined to while
away their time appraising horseflesh at the six-day sale in
this gambling and racing resort on the Normandy coast.</p>
<p>Kuwait's ruling al-Sabah family, ousted from the tiny
sheikdom during the Iraqi invasion three weeks ago, "is one
of the most respected by other gulf families, and very few of
them would want to see their name appear now," explains one
bloodstock agent. "Would you want to be seen spending money
on baubles as the U.S. sends in its troops?"</p>
<p>The nervousness here about the Arabs' attendance is
understandable. Over the past decade, Arab buyers from the
Persian Gulf countries have lavished piles of money on horses
in Europe and the U.S., building up large racing stables and
carrying off trophy after trophy at the major derbies. "The
Arabs spend about #200 million $385 million a year on their
horses," estimates Jocelyn de Moubray, editor of the British
racing weekly Pacemaker Update.</p>
<p>Although Arab-owned stables are now well established and
breeding more of their own stock, such buyers as Saudi
Arabia's Prince Khaled Abdullah and the four al-Maktoum
brothers from Dubai's ruling family are still major players
on the yearling-sale circuit. The al-Maktoums alone dominate
European racing and, in more peaceful times, are frequent
visitors at such high-society gatherings as Ascot, where they
are often seen decked out in top hats and tails, gracing the
Royal Enclosure.</p>
<p>"The al-Maktoums have 500 or 600 horses in training every
year," says one of their trainers at Deauville. Other, older
stables -- the Aga Khan's, for example, which has about 140
in training -- pale by comparison.</p>
<p>Arab money usually represents about 40% of the sales by
value at Kentucky's Keeneland yearling auction, the largest
in the U.S. At the Deauville event, the season's first
European sale for yearlings, Arab purchases typically account
for 10% to 15% of the value of horses sold.</p>
<p>But this year the Arabs, and the al-Maktoums especially,
are likely to be more attentive to the odds on Saddam Hussein
than to those on their horses. Sheik Mohammed al-Maktoum is
the defense minister of the United Arab Emirates, a union of
small desert kingdoms, including Dubai, that aren't far from
Kuwait as the missile flies and that have recently become a
target of the Iraqi leader's bellicose speeches for breaking
oil quotas. Other Arab buyers have already played shy at the
yearling sale at Saratoga, N.Y., which was held shortly after
Iraqi troops marched into Kuwait.</p>
<p>"If there's a risk of war, you can't expect people to
commit themselves to buying anything, be it apartment blocks
or horses," says Richard Galpin, a British blood-stock agent.</p>
<p>In the minds of many of the breeders and owners at
Deauville, there is one hope: the Japanese. Amid economic ups
and downs, horse racing has always shown resilience because
of the attractions it holds for new money. And Japanese
wealth, coming in the wake of Arab and U.S. fortunes, has
proved no exception.</p>
<p>"We're starting to feel the effects of Japanese money at
the sales," says Luca Cumani, a trainer for Sheik Mohammed
al-Maktoum and the Aga Khan. Indeed, top prices at both the
Keeneland and Saratoga sales this year were paid by Japanese
buyers. And at Deauville, there seem to be more Japanese
visitors than ever before, though few of them are well-known
buyers.</p>
<p>When the Deauville auction began Saturday evening, the
bidding started slowly, and prices were disappointing -- down
20% compared with last year. Moreover, fewer than half of the
first 30 horses were sold. Among those buyers, there were no
Arabs and only one Japanese.</p>
<p>"It's a soft market," complained Patrick Chedeville, who
runs one of France's largest commercial breeding operations.
Another breeder, more hopefully, called it "selective."</p>
<p>Only with the bidding for the 38th lot -- a colt, sired by
the European stallion Sadler's Wells, which was expected to
attract the interest of an al-Maktoum stable -- were spirits
revived. Eshoku Zen and Kihachiro Watanabe, two Japanese
owners, competed for the horse, pushing other bidders aside
as the price climbed.</p>
<p>At 6.5 million French francs ($1.25 million), four times
the sale price of any other horse at the evening's auction,
Mr. Zen dropped out, leaving the colt to Mr. Watanabe, owner
of the transport company Toko Corp. Although the price was
well below Mr. Zen's 1985 record of 9 million francs for a
Deauville yearling, it equals last year's top price paid by
Crown Prince Maktoum al-Maktoum, the eldest of the four Dubai
brothers.</p>
<p>Eventually, an Arab buyer did appear. Although it was only
one Arab, bidding for one of the less well known and cheaper
horses, it was enough to stir excitement. The television
cameras covering the sale swung around to focus on him.</p>
<p>Fati Kalla, a London-based Palestinian and former film
producer, ended up buying two horses at the sale that
evening, which he said went better than he had expected. "The
Japanese are here to pick up the best yearlings . . . so
prices were reasonable," he noted. "But the money isn't there
like it was before the Iraqi invasion."</p>
<p>It was only on Sunday, after the initial glare of
publicity surrounding the sales had subsided, that Saudi
Arabia's Prince Abdullah arrived here from London. The prince
appeared at the auction ring on Sunday evening and bid
780,000 francs for a colt.</p>
<p>Beside the sums of earlier years, it was a modest
purchase. But Mr. Krainc seemed vindicated. "Things," he
insisted, "are looking much better."</p>
