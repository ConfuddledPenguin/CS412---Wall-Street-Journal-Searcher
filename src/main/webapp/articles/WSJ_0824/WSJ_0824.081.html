	<p class="article-leader">BASEL, Switzerland -- Ciba-Geigy AG and Roche Holding AG,
two major Swiss chemical and drug companies, announced that
Ciba has agreed to acquire Roche's plant-protection unit.
   In June, Roche announced its intention to divest itself of
the unit and said it was talking at that time with various
potential suitors. Roche said the unit was too small to
compete on its own.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The agreement covers companies in the Maag Group,
including Dr. R. Maag AG in Switzerland, Maag Agrochemicals
Inc. of Florida and La Quinoleine Et Ses Derives S.A. of
France.</p>
<p>The pact is subject to regulatory approval. Maag, with 378
million francs ($295.8 million) in sales in 1989, will
complement Ciba's own agro division, which had 1989 sales of
4.25 billion francs, according to the announcement.</p>
<p>Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed.</p>
