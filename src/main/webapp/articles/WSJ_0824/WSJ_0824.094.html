	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- BSN S.A. said Invus Group Ltd. of the U.S. agreed
to buy the U.S. biscuit operations it put up for sale in May.
   A spokesman for the French food group said he couldn't
disclose the price for the transaction, beyond saying that it
would generate a "substantial capital gain."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Terms of the sale will see Invus Group, a unit of the
closely held Belgian company Artal, take control of BSN's
U.S. biscuit units Mother's and Salerno. The units have
combined annual revenue of about $200 million for a 5.7%
stake of the U.S. market.</p>
<p>Invus Group will also take over distribution of BSN's Lu
brand in the U.S., but BSN will retain ownership.</p>
<p>BSN's move out of the U.S. biscuit market reflects its
decision to focus on faster-growing, less-expensive markets
in Asia and Europe, where it has recently been on an
acquisition binge.</p>
<p>The U.S. pullout doesn't extend to BSN's other U.S.
operations, which include products with higher market shares,
such as Dannon yogurt, Lea & Perrins condiments and Evian
mineral water.</p>
<p>BSN is France's biggest food group, with consolidated 1989
revenue of 48.7 billion francs ($9.3 billion) and profit of
2.7 billion francs. BSN said Invus Group generates annual
revenue of about $1.3 billion in the U.S., with a large
portion coming from baked goods. It didn't provide further
details.</p>
