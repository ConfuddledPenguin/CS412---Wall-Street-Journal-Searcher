	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- The 10 major U.S. auto makers planned to build
106,425 cars and trucks this week, down 18.7% from 130,980 a
year ago.
   General Motors Corp. said two of its U.S. car assembly
plants will remain idled until Sept. 4. The Ypsilanti, Mich.,
plant has been closed since Aug. 13, initially because the
Persian Gulf conflict derailed an order for Chevrolet
Caprices and Buick Estate Wagons bound for the Mideast, but
now because of a lack of U.S. dealer orders.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The plant that builds the Buick Reatta has been closed
since the end of July to retool for the 1991 model.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. said it's planning Saturday overtime this
week at its Wayne, Mich., car assembly plant and daily
overtime at three truck assembly plants.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Ford has four car assembly plants
idled this week but has scheduled to reopen the plants next
week.</p>
<p>Chrysler Corp. said this week it's planning Saturday
overtime for its Newark, Del., plant. The company said it
plans to reopen Monday its St. Louis II assembly plant that
builds its long wheelbase minivans. That plant has been
closed since the beginning of the month for retooling.</p>
