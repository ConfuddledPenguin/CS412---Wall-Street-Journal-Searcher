	<p class="article-leader">In early 1987 in a remote UN refugee camp in rural Costa
Rica, Jose Aguirre Sanchez, a 57-year-old bean farmer from
southern Nicaragua, told me about Sandinista mass murders in
his home village 18 months before that drove him into exile:
   "The Sandinista army started killing civilians. My close
friend was killed in it. He read a Catholic Bible and liked
to tell people about it. He was kind of a preacher. One day
the Sandinistas surrounded his house while he was eating
dinner. The Sandinistas threw a grenade at the house and
started shooting at it. They shot my friend in the arm and
all the children in the house ran out. The Sandinistas said
they would take my friend to the hospital to get treatment
for the gunshot wound and led him away. Instead they killed
him. His mutilated body was found later. His name was Rufino
Laguna. We didn't tell the authorities because we were
afraid. The Sandinista soldiers started killing other people
in the town."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On that visit to two refugee camps for Nicaraguans in
Costa Rica, historian Ronald Radosh and I interviewed 50
refugees who told of similar experiences of fleeing lethal
Sandinista army attacks on remote villages where the Contras
had passed through but were not present during the assaults.
They said scores of women, children and other civilians were
murdered in cold blood. We concluded that the Sandinistas had
a counterinsurgency policy of "draining the sea," that is,
killing or driving out the "sea" of rural peasants who could
lend support to the guerrillas.</p>
<p>Other evidence of political massacres by the Sandinistas
emerged as well. Shortly after our report was publicized,
Gary Moore, an investigator with the Washington-based
National Forum Foundation, went on muleback to remote areas
inside Nicaragua. There, he taped villagers attesting to
political murders by Sandinista security officials (an effort
that landed him in prison and resulted in the confiscation of
some of his documentation).</p>
<p>What was the reaction of the international human rights
community to these and other shocking reports? Most ignored
the few who spoke up, following the lead of Americas Watch,
the most prominent human rights group concentrating on Latin
America. Americas Watch retraced our steps in the refugee
camps, but cast doubts on the refugee reports by criticizing
us for not collecting corroborating evidence of massacres
inside Nicaragua -- in war zones closed to foreign
investigators but where, they claimed, they had free access.</p>
<p>Americas Watch went even further stating, in a report
issued the same month as my organization's refugee report:
"The government of Nicaragua does not engage in a pattern of
violations of the laws of war. Nor does it engage in
systematic violations of the right to life or to physical
integrity of detainees. . . . Nor does it engage in a
deliberate pattern of forced disappearances of persons."</p>
<p>In 1989, when Americas Watch acknowledged that Nicaraguan
armed forces "engaged in a pattern of killings" in northern
Nicaragua, it stated that it believed the killings were "a
new phenomenon." In other words, any prior killings by
Sandinistas were acts of individuals and did not reflect
official policy.</p>
<p>But now evidence of the awful truth has become
irrefutable, thanks in large part to the courageous work of
Marta Patricia Baltodano, a Nicaraguan human rights lawyer
and director of the Nicaraguan Association Pro Human
Rights-established by the U.S. State Department to
investigate and prosecute Contra human rights violations.
Since the Sandinistas' electoral defeat, she has been able to
uncover eight secret mass graves in remote northern Nicaragua
that corroborate the earliest reports of systematic killings
of civilians by Sandinista soldiers and militants.</p>
<p>Working with four lawyers, a forensic doctor and local
witnesses no longer afraid to testify, Ms. Baltodano has
already established that three of the graves contain the
remains of civilians murdered by Sandinista military and
State Security personnel (Nicaragua's secret police, who were
trained and assisted until February by their East German
counterparts, the dread Stasi). The five others still are
under investigation. In the excavation of each gravesite, the
new, freely elected mayors have been eager to help. Ms.
Baltodano told me that local "campesinos", who have been too
afraid to speak openly about the murders before, have now
enthusiastically volunteered to shovel out the sites and air
the truth.</p>
<p>In the most recent discovery, on Aug. 15 in Murra, a town
close to the Honduran border, Ms. Baltodano's group, with a
large local crowd looking on, found 17 skeletons. Fourteen of
the bodies have been identified as evangelicals who were
rounded up by a Sandinista battalion, forced to dig their own
grave and then shot or stabbed to death on April 10, 1982 --
when the Contra war was still in its infancy. Family members
identified the victims through gold fillings in their teeth,
remnants of clothes, and in one case an agrarian reform ID
number linking him to a local farming cooperative.</p>
<p>In June, the Nicaraguan Association found another shallow
grave in Mokoron, 220 yards from a Sandinista military
battalion near Wiwili in northern Jinotega. This site yielded
parts of 11 skeletons. One by one the relatives of eight of
the victims have come forward to identify them. They were
caught by the State Security while trying to escape being
dragooned into the Sandinista army in October 1983. The
remains of two adults and a seven-year-old child have not
been identified. Cords used to bind the victims were found,
and the forensic examiner concluded the victims' throats had
been cut.</p>
<p>There is every indication that Ms. Baltodano's findings
are only the tip of the iceberg. Every week campesinos
cautiously come to her with new leads. Her office, already
overwhelmed, has not yet investigated in Nueva Guinea, Punta
Gorda and the villages of southern Zelaya, where the refugees
I interviewed came from. Nor has she checked the area along
the Atlantic coast, where many Nicaraguan Indians, targeted
by Sandinista authorities as civilian dissidents,
disappeared.</p>
<p>That the Sandinistas were able to get away with the
summary execution of noncombatants is in no small part due to
the failure of some of the main human rights groups that deal
with Latin America. The Sandinistas even cited Americas Watch
reports to deflect too-close scrutiny on rights-abuse
charges. At the same time, reports (such as ours) that
documented Sandinista abuses were attacked and dismissed as
having been trumped up by or linked to the CIA.</p>
<p>The Organization of American States' Human Rights
Commission recently met with Ms. Baltodano to discuss her
findings. But so far none of the private human rights groups
that concentrate on Latin America have shown much interest in
her work. As they did in Chile and Argentina, these groups
should be insisting on a full accounting. Even though an
amnesty law in Nicaragua may bar the prosecution of war
criminals and rights violators, a full investigation should
be supported out of humanitarian concern for the victims'
families and in the interest of justice.</p>
