	<p class="article-leader">George Melloan paints a distorted picture of the
exchange-rate mechanism (ERM) of the European Monetary System
(Global View, op-ed page, July 16). This mechanism makes many
European currencies artificially strong by tying them to the
deutsche mark. But Mr. Melloan states, "Strong currencies
have certainly done no harm to the industries of France, the
Netherlands, Ireland and Austria." As evidence, he cites
their impressive economic growth rates. He then argues that
Britain, which has remained outside the ERM, has no
compelling reason not to join: "If having a strong currency
did none of these countries any harm, what exactly is
England's problem?"
   The track record of strong-currency ERM nations is not as
nice as Mr. Melloan suggests. For example, the average annual
growth rate of the economy in France was lower from 1979-87
than for the pre-ERM years 1970-78. The same was true for
Italy. Evidence also suggests that the average rate of
unemployment in ERM countries has been higher and has
declined more slowly than in non-ERM countries.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Moreover, the clearest supposed benefit of ERM membership
-- price stability -- may not be so clear at all. While
inflation has been reduced dramatically in ERM nations, it
has fallen by a similar amount in the rest of the
industrialized world. Inflation rates in ERM nations are now
somewhat lower than in many non-ERM nations, but the
disinflation process was much slower for ERM members.</p>
<p>Mr. Melloan concludes by wondering why Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher has been so reluctant to place the pound in
the ERM, ". . . what is England waiting for . . . given the
good track record of the other ERM nations? . . . Presumably,
Mrs. Thatcher knows the answer, but she isn't telling." Yet,
perhaps Mrs. Thatcher has been hesitant precisely because of
the track record of other ERM nations. Existing evidence
suggests that this reluctance merits praise, not derision.</p>
