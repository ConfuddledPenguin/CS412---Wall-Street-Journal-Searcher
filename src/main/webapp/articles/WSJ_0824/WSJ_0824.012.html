	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French state-owned Electricite de France, or EDF,
said the agency that oversees privatizations in East Germany,
the Treuhandanstalt, approved a plan in which a group to be
led by EDF will be able to participate in the restructuring
of East Germany's electricity system.
   The agency signed an accord Tuesday with three West German
electrical concerns and EDF, which allows the EDF-led group
to acquire a participation of as much as 15% in the future
electric company that will be in charge of power production
and transportation -- but not distribution -- in East
Germany.</p>

include other European electrical companies.</p>
