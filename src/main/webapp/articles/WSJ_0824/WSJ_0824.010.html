	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- Berliner Bank AG said it sold
its 25.1% stake in Bankinstitut Zuerich AG, a Zurich,
Switzerland, bank, to Bayerische Landesbank Girozentrale.
Terms weren't disclosed.
   The Berlin-based banking group said the transaction, which
was agreed to in principle June 27, still requires approval
from Swiss banking authorities. The Swiss banking commission
will look into the matter in September, Berliner Bank said.
Bayerische Landesbank is a Munich-based bank.</p>
