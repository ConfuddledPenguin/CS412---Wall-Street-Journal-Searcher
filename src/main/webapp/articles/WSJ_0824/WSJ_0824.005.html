	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Paul M. Schlem has agreed to step down as
chief executive of debt-strapped Vintners International Co.
as part of a refinancing plan offered by the wine maker's
lenders.
   If the plan is approved by the company's board in early
September, according to someone familiar with the
negotiations, Vintners will be granted a one-year moratorium
on interest payments on its $220 million debt, and additional
financing to carry the company through the fall grape
harvest. In exchange, the company will follow a "conservative
plan to downsize the company over the next 12 months."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Vintners -- which operates Paul Masson, Taylor California
Cellars, and Taylor Wine Co. of New York -- is the nation's
third-largest wine maker. According to one source familiar
with the company's finances, Vintners lost $20 million in its
last fiscal year, on sales of $250 million.</p>
<p>Mr. Schlem, who took the company private in $240 million
leveraged buy-out from Joseph E. Seagram & Sons in 1987,
would remain the company's chairman and largest shareholder,
according to another major stockholder. But day-to-day
managment of the company would fall to a three-man committee
made up of board members Edward McCray and Lee Dill, and
Frank Jerant, a production manager at the company's Paul
Masson vineyard.</p>
<p>Bank of New England Corp., Harris Bankcorp., and Household
Commercial Financing Services, the three lenders, declined to
comment on the proposed deal. Vintners has gone in and out of
default on its loan, but its lenders haven't called the
loans.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Schlem and Mr. Jerant declined comment. The two
board members couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The company has been staggering under a debt-to-equity
ratio of 16 to 1, and has been "hemorrhaging money,"
according to Thomas Pirko, a beverage industry consultant who
has been following Vintners for Tokyo-based Bevmart.</p>
<p>In July 1989, chief executive officer Michael Cliff, one
of the partners in the leveraged buy-out, was asked to step
aside by the company's board. Mr. Cliff and Mr. Schlem had
differed over the best approach to carry the company out of
its financial difficulties. Mr. Cliff had been trying to move
the company from its bedrock "jug-wine" market, which was
softening, into the import of premium wines, a rapidly
growing segment of the market.</p>
<p>Mr. Schlem favored concentrating on the company's major
domestic brands, asserting that Mr. Cliff's plans had
inflated marketing costs from $12 million in fiscal 1987 to
$32 million in the fiscal year ending July 31, 1989.</p>
<p>Mr. Cliff acknowledged Thursday that he and Mr. Schlem had
differed over long-term strategy. Mr. Cliff, who remains a
stockholder, declined to discuss the company's financial
problems since his departure.</p>
<p>Roughly 25% of the company's middle -- and upper -- level
management have resigned or been dismissed since Mr. Cliff's
departure, according to a source familiar with the company's
operations.</p>
<p>Mr. Schlem had hoped to raise about $100 million through a
sale of the company's Taylor Wine Co. of New York subsidiary,
but the best offer received for the unit was $40 million,
according to someone who looked at the unit for a potential
buyer. "Nobody would touch it at that {$100 million} price,"
he said. "And Schlem had to have the money to get through."</p>
<p>Mr. Pirko, of Los Angeles-based Bevmart Inc., predicts
that if the current refinancing is approved, "it will only
temporarily stem the flow of blood. I think that without a
long-term capitalization and restructuring, the company
doesn't have a place in the major wine business.</p>
<p>"What the company needs to compete against E&J Gallo
Winery and Grand Metropolitan PLC, the number one and number
two players, is a major amount of capital to upgrade their
brands and to launch an importing business," he said.</p>
