	<p class="article-leader">Apple Computer Inc. has set plans for introducing three
new computers in mid-October, including the company's first
Macintosh computer with a detachable color monitor that will
sell for a "street" price of roughly $2,500, according to
people familiar with Apple's plans.
   Earlier this year, Apple came under fierce criticism for
sticking with an aging family of lower-cost computers and for
offering color models only at prices above $4,000 at a time
when many color models compatible with International Business
Machines Corp.'s PC sell for below $2,000. John Sculley,
Apple's chief executive officer, has repeatedly defended the
company's move into higher-priced, higher-performance
products. But in February, he forced out his chief of product
development and added those duties to his own.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Apple's three new computers will be the first to be
introduced by the Cupertino, Calif., concern since Mr.
Sculley took over product development. Prices for the
products, all Macintosh computers, haven't been established.
But people familiar with Apple's plans say the products
include a replacement for the company's venerable Macintosh
Plus, a new Macintosh with a detachable color monitor priced
at roughly $2,500 and a high-end machine that's basically a
slimmed-down version of its hot-selling Macintosh IIci.</p>
<p>Apple won't comment on the future products, though it
confirmed that it plans a major product introduction in
October.</p>
<p>Industry observers say the new products could represent a
watershed for Apple because if they don't sit well with
customers the company may decide to abandon its proprietary
approach to computing. Today, Apple doesn't license its
system software, which controls the basic operations of its
Macintosh computers, to other companies.</p>
<p>Senior executives at Apple lately have been studying new
ways of doing business. The company's executives are even
privately asking whether Apple should be licensing its
proprietary software. That software is the key to Apple's
success, but it also prevents Macintosh owners from using the
vast number of software programs written for IBM's PC.</p>
<p>The most important of the new computers is the Macintosh
LC, a mid-range, color model that offers some distinctive
advantages over the company's low-end Macintosh SE, but none
of the power of its higher-priced color models.</p>
<p>The LC will use Motorola Inc.'s 68020 microprocessor and
will have room for added electronics gear that will enable it
to run software written for the company's incompatible Apple
II computers. Observers, who declined to be identified, say
Apple hopes to regain some of the momentum it has lost this
year with educational customers who want to buy Macintoshes
but balk at prices for various models.</p>
<p>While Apple hopes to win back education customers with the
LC, it plans to continue to sell Apple II machines, say
people familiar with the company's plans.</p>
<p>But the LC probably won't be shipped to customers until
next January, partly because Apple is scrambling to secure
sufficient quantities of color monitors from its chief
supplier, Sony Corp., said one industry executive who asked
not to be identified. Any delay in shipping the LC could
complicate things for Apple because it could result in
customers holding off on purchases of existing models.</p>
<p>People familiar with the discussions say Apple won't make
drastic shifts in its proprietary approach now. They say
Apple's senior management wants to see the reception given
its forthcoming models before altering its course.</p>
<p>Even if the new products sell well, however, the company
still could shift gears. For months, some analysts have urged
Apple to begin selectively licensing its system software,
arguing that Apple will benefit from competitors' selling
machines that use Macintosh software. "Who knows what event
will push Apple into doing that?" asked Michelle Preston, an
analyst at Cowen & Co. "It could be any number of things."</p>
<p>Separately, a federal judge in San Francisco put off
deciding some potentially major issues in Apple's copyright
infringement suit against Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard
Co. Apple claims operating system programs of the two
companies are too similar to the "look and feel" of its
Macintosh system and yesterday had sought a ruling that its
copyrights were valid.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard have contended that the
Macintosh visual displays aren't original enough to be
deserving of much protection under the copyright laws and
that their products were largely covered by license
agreements with Apple, among other arguments. Judge Vaughn
Walker didn't indicate when he would rule.</p>
