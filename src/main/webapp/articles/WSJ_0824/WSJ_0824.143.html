	<p class="article-leader">British Airways PLC grounded seven Boeing 767s in London
after routine maintenance revealed cracks in six of the
jetliners in the pylons connecting the engines to the wings.
   The planes only began flying with British Airways last
February. The airline had used them on routes to Europe and
the Middle East, a Boeing Co. spokesman said. They are
powered by Rolls-Royce RB211524E engines.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>British Airways has 10 more 767s on order, Boeing said.</p>
<p>The design of the grounded planes is "unique to that
engine and airframe construction," said the Boeing spokesman.
"There isn't any reason to expect this problem would show up
in any other Boeing airplane."</p>
<p>Boeing and British Airways have developed a possible
solution to the problem, the Boeing spokesman said. The
Seattle-based company sent a team of engineers and mechanics
to London last night to begin implementing the changes.</p>
<p>The Boeing spokesman said he didn't know how long it might
be before the planes are back in service.</p>
