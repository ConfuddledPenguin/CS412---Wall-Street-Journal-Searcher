	<p class="article-leader">MADISON, Wis. -- "No Sniveling]"
   Gov. Tommy Thompson's desk plate is like a shot across
your bow. No mealymouthing here, it warns, no pussyfooting
around. Lest its message be lost, there is a second sign
nearby:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"What part of NO don't you understand?"</p>
<p>Here is the Republican whom Wisconsin Democrats call "Dr.
No." The man who used the line-item veto 615 times in only
three budget bills. Tough, but disarmingly gregarious at the
same time, he'd make a good barroom bouncer. That's because
he was a barroom bouncer, while working his way through the
University of Wisconsin.</p>
<p>To conservative admirers, 48-year-old Gov. Thompson also
is a potential GOP star of the future -- if as expected he
wins re-election against a solid Democratic candidate in a
state that went for Michael Dukakis only two years ago. Gov.
Thompson has built a reputation as a conservative
problem-solver. Yet he has managed to remain popular in this
bastion of progressive-to-liberal politics -- more popular,
at one point, than Milwaukee Brewers slugger Robin Yount.</p>
<p>"Tommy is an example of an activist conservative," says
House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich. "He's open to
conservative solutions, not just conservative opposition."</p>
<p>Assertively "pro-business," Gov. Thompson has cut
Wisconsin's capital gains, income and inheritance taxes. He
now enjoys partial credit for an economic resurgence that has
created 250,000 new nonfarm jobs during his first term. Yet
he's been unable to deliver in a major way on a 1986 campaign
pledge to provide state relief for soaring local property
taxes. Challenger Tom Loftus calculates property taxes will
jump $1 billion during the governor's first term and is
making that jump his prime issue.</p>
<p>"The rich have gotten tax breaks, the middle class has
gotten property-tax increases," says Mr. Loftus, who's
speaker of the Wisconsin Assembly.</p>
<p>In 1987, Tommy Thompson cemented a friendship with then
Vice President George Bush by volunteering for a wild
speedboat ride with Mr. Bush at the helm. Like Mr. Bush, Gov.
Thompson hasn't run against government. "I think you can be a
conservative and still like government," he says. What he's
done instead is pursue some traditional governmental
objectives in untraditional ways.</p>
<p>Politically, meanwhile, he has driven wedges between
elements of the Democratic coalition -- between the teachers
union and parents, for example, and between the '60s-style
liberals of Madison and the more conservative Democrats of
Milwaukee. Two social programs, Learnfare and Choice,
illustrate his approach.</p>
<p>Learnfare cuts welfare payments to adults if their
teen-agers cut school. Learnfare is politically popular, and
the governor hopes to extend the concept down to the
six-year-old level.</p>
<p>Much to Gov. Thompson's frustration, however, a legal
challenge held up Learnfare's application to Milwaukee County
and its concentration of welfare recipients. At issue was the
flawed record-keeping system of the Milwaukee public school
system, which makes it hard to document when a given pupil
was in school and when he wasn't.</p>
<p>"How in the hell," fumes the governor, "can they run a
school system when they can't tell you who's attending and
who's not?" The challenge now appears resolved in time for
this school year.</p>
<p>Choice, a first-in-the-nation pilot program, spends
taxpayer money to send children to private, non-sectarian
schools. So far, it affects just under 1,000 low-income grade
school and high school students in Milwaukee. But it
represents a pointed challenge to the public school
establishment: Shape up, or watch your pupils ship out.</p>
<p>Choice is bitterly opposed by the Wisconsin Education
Association Council, as well as the state superintendent,
Herbert Grover. "We're going to have two school systems in
this state and both paid for by public money," he recently
declared. "One will have accountability and one won't."</p>
<p>Gov. Thompson relishes the uproar. "The teachers union
can't stand competition," he says. "If we succeed in this,
the eyes of the nation will be on us."</p>
<p>The evolution of Choice is a good illustration of the
Thompson governing style. He didn't invent the idea, whose
key backer was Polly Williams, a black Democratic legislator
from Milwaukee. But he latched on to it, making it his own.</p>
<p>"I don't see an innovative guy, I see a very pragmatic
guy," observes Charles O. Jones, a University of Wisconsin
political scientist. "He's partisan but not ideological. He
takes his opportunities as they present themselves."</p>
<p>"His manner and his technique are very down-home
Wisconsin," says Washington conservative activist David
Keene, a friend since he and Mr. Thompson championed a truly
lonely cause -- Barry Goldwater -- in their University of
Wisconsin days. "But he has this single-minded quality."</p>
<p>Democratic opponent Tom Loftus is in many ways the
governor's polar opposite: a classic liberal Democrat and
proud of it. "The election of 1990 will determine if
Wisconsin is the progressive state of the 21st century or a
state with a once-proud past now sliding towards average," he
told a rally here. The self-described underdog has a shot at
an upset, given the property-tax issue and the strength of
the state Democratic party. But the earnest, issues-oriented
Mr. Loftus is no match for the governor as a campaigner.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Gov. Thompson was in Milwaukee
harvesting the endorsements of three veteran Democrats who
helped build the modern Wisconsin Democratic Party. One was
ex-Mayor Henry Maier, a legend after governing Milwaukee for
28 years. Mr. Thompson's satisfied grin faded only slightly
when the ever-crusty Mr. Maier described him as a man with
just one weakness. "He should either shave or use makeup to
combat his three-o'clock shadow."</p>
<p>Then it was off to the Wisconsin State Fair. Cowboy hat on
head, Mr. Thompson auctioned off champion livestock as a
figure in a pink hog costume, Willy B. Bacon, whipped up the
bidders. Then, after recuperating at a beer tent, the
governor hit the midway.</p>
<p>With his police escort dutifully trailing along behind, he
slid down the giant slide, got soaked on a bumper boat, rode
the Ferris wheel, the double Ferris wheel, the roller coaster
and every other ride in sight. Fairgoers rushed over to give
him high-fives, to ply him with food, to hug him and pose for
snapshots.</p>
<p>It was 1:30 a.m. when Tommy Thompson finally rolled up to
the executive mansion, clutching the cowboy hat like a
trophy.</p>
