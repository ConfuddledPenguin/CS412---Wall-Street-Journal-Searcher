	<p class="article-leader">Bryan Jamison's distorted views of the business brokerage
industry (Manager's Journal, editorial page, July 30) require
comment. As the president of a business sales firm, I am
truly amazed that a part-time president of a small
manufacturing company felt he was so well versed in the art
of business acquisitions that he would proceed to paint
everyone in the business sales industry with the same
narrow-minded brush.
   It is possible that the brokers Mr. Jamison dealt with
were well aware he was looking to get "great mileage at
cocktail parties" by mentioning his plans to acquire another
company. What a professional business broker has to offer to
a serious buyer is invaluable. Please, Mr. Jamison, next time
you're looking for party chatter, stick to the repaving of
your parking lot. With any luck you won't be satisfied with
the job the paving company does for you and in your next
column you can bad-mouth every paving contractor in the
country.</p>
