	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- SmithKline Beecham PLC said it agreed to
manufacture a generic form of its blood-pressure drug Dyazide
for distribution by Rugby Laboratories in the U.S.
   SmithKline said capsules of the product would be shipped
by Rugby to wholesalers and pharmacies by Oct. 1. The company
said it also would continue to provide Dyazide for patients,
doctors and pharmacists "who prefer brand-name products."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A SmithKline spokeswoman said she didn't know details
about pricing plans for the generic version of the drug. She
indicated that the chemical formulation of the generic
version would be identical to that of the brand-name product.</p>
<p>Dyazide, a longtime mainstay of SmithKline's drug line,
was introduced in the U.S. in 1965. But U.S. sales plunged
53%, to $153 million in 1988, the first full year after the
Food and Drug Administration approved the initial generic
form of the product. Moreover, the arrival of generic
competition stunned the company, even though its patent on
the drug had expired seven years earlier.</p>
<p>Frederick Kyle, president of SmithKline's U.S.
pharmaceuticals unit, said the alliance with Rugby would give
his company "an excellent opportunity" to compete against
more generic rivals to Dyazide that are expected to enter the
market.</p>
<p>In February, SmithKline cut the Dyazide price to
wholesalers by 11%.</p>
<p>The price-cutting action came in the wake of an admission
by Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. that its employees filled
Vitarine capsules with SmithKline's Dyazide to win FDA
approval of a generic version of the medicine. Meanwhile,
Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., another generic competitor,
withdrew from the blood-pressure medicine market following
allegations that data used to obtain FDA approval for
marketing Bolar's product had been falsified.</p>
