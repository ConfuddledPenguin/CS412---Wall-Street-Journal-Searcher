	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- AmBase Corp., a week after agreeing to sell
its Home Insurance Co. unit, said it received an offer from
an investor group to acquire 50.1% of AmBase at $4 a share,
or about $67.8 million.
   If approved by AmBase's board, the plan would jeopardize
the sale of Home Insurance Co., AmBase's principal business.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Vik Brothers International, a European-based investor
group, agreed on Aug. 14 to purchase the troubled property
and casualty insurance unit for $544 million. Vik officials
couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The latest offer includes refinancing of $410 million in
AmBase bank debt and a cash infusion of as much as $68
million. The Vik agreement called for assumption of $76
million in debt.</p>
<p>The new investor group indicated that if it gains control
of AmBase it would keep the insurance unit. "We believe that
the Home Insurance Co. is well positioned to become a premier
underwriter," a spokesman for the investor group said.
AmBase's directors are expected to vote on the offer today.</p>
<p>William Walsh, one of the investors, said management,
including Chairman George Scharffenberger, wouldn't stay on
but that executives running Home Insurance and other units
would be retained.</p>
<p>The investor group includes Sequoia Associates, Menlo
Park, Calif.; Hermitage Capital Corp., a subsidiary of
Financial Securities Fund L.P., New York; and Whitman
Heffernon Rhein & Co., New York. Some notable names in the
insurance industry are part of the group including Donald
MacNaughton, former chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America, and Benjamin N. Woodson, former chairman of American
General Corp.</p>
<p>AmBase rose 25 cents a share yesterday to $2 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. It was one of the few
gaining stocks on the Big Board.</p>
<p>"This is a pretty positive offer," said Gloria L. Vogel,
insurance analyst with Bear Stearns Co. "Shareholders are
left with more than under the Vik agreement." Under that
agreement, shareholders essentially would have been left with
only the Carteret Bancorp Inc. unit, and still holding most
of the $730 million in total AmBase debt. Included in Vik's
purchase would be Gruntal Financial Corp. and Sterling Forest
Corp., among other Home Insurance units.</p>
<p>Under the latest proposal, the investor group is
considering refinancing AmBase's existing bank debt of $410
million through a new financing facility to be led by Westpac
Banking Corp.</p>
<p>Once the controlling stake is purchased, the investors
would seek to raise a further $68 million through a rights
offering to shareholders. The rights include zero-coupon
notes, which would carry attached warrants to purchase 34
million AmBase shares at $2 each. If shareholders don't
accept the rights-offer, however, the investors said they are
prepared to make a cash infusion of up to $68 million.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for the investor group declined to say if they
would use a tender offer to seek the controlling stake, or to
elaborate on the terms of the rights offering. AmBase
currently has about 34 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Udayan Ghose, insurance analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers, said the investor group is in a strong position.
"You're looking at controlling an awful lot of equity without
putting up very much money. The key here was that they were
able to get financing from Westpac."</p>
<p>Indeed, analysts were skeptical that AmBase officials
could raise enough cash from the Home Insurance sale and a
planned preferred stock offering to pay off its corporate
debt.</p>
<p>In addition, the Vik agreement angered shareholders who
filed suit in Manhattan federal court last week charging
AmBase with disseminating false information to inflate its
stock price. Before the announcement of the Vik agreement
last week, AmBase shares were trading at $7 or $8 apiece.</p>
<p>After AmBase put Home Insurance on the block in February,
it suspended payment of its quarterly common stock dividend,
but said that it expected to pay a special dividend to
shareholders when it closed on the sale. Shortly after
reaching the accord with Vik, AmBase officials admitted the
company would not be able to distribute the special dividend.
The shareholder lawsuit claims AmBase should have disclosed
earlier that it would not be able to pay the special
dividend.</p>
<p>Mr. Scharffenberger has a hefty severance package, which
would pay him five years of salary, plus a five-year
consulting contract. In 1989, he earned more than $1.54
million, in addition to stock options and other bonuses.</p>
