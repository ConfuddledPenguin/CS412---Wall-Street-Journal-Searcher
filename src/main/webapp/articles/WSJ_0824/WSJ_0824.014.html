	<p class="article-leader">PORTLAND, Ore. -- Avia Group International Inc., a unit of
Reebok International Ltd., said it named Mitsui & Co. as the
exclusive distributor of its athletic shoes and apparel in
Japan.
   Under terms of the agreement, the shoes, shirts, shorts
and other apparel items, will be marketed under the Avia name
by Mitsui, a $126 billion trading company that owns a number
of health clubs and markets lines of skis, golf clubs and
bowling equipment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mitsui will market Avia's products through its Bussan
Sports Academy subsidiary.</p>
<p>Approximately $9 million of Avia's $200 million in sales
last year came from Japan, analysts said. Backed by the name
of a big Japanese firm, Avia's Japan sales are expected to
grow by about 50% each year, reaching about $30 million in
three years, analysts estimate.</p>
<p>Avia is also negotiating deals with Yugoslavia and
Czechoslovakia, said Harry de Boer, Avia's international vice
president. Agreements are expected to be signed soon. Avia's
international division, which last year had sales of $35
million, is expecting growth of about 40% this year, and
better than 50% in each of the next two years, Mr. de Boer
added. Currently, it does 75% of its business in Canada, the
U.K., Germany and Spain.</p>
<p>Avia's international growth comes at a time of
retrenchment in its domestic division. The company's overall
sales last year of about $200 million were flat, though at
one time it had visions of selling $250 million of products.</p>
<p>Avia shoes sell on the higher end of the retail scale --
between $50 and $90 a pair. Competition in that league is
stiff, especially since it must rival companies, including
its parent Reebok, that have advertising budgets two to three
times in size. Avia spent about $20 million in advertising
and promotions in 1989.</p>
<p>As a result, the company has scaled back its overall
growth expectations for the next couple of years, taking the
time to reposition itself on the marketing front. For
example, next year it will stop making sneakers for tiny tots
and younger children, focusing instead on making greater
inroads in the adult market. As part of the regrouping
effort, the company trimmed the size of its staff by 30%
earlier this year.</p>
<p>Its "For Athletic Use Only" advertising campaign will also
be "less exclusive and elitist," a company spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Reebok International is based in Stoughton, Mass.</p>
