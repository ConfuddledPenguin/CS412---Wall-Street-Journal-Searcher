	<p class="article-leader">Western Union Corp. again extended the deadline of its
recapitalization plan in which it is seeking to exchange $530
million of secured notes for new notes and common stock.
   The financial services and communications company, which
is based in Upper Saddle River, N.J., extended the deadline
to midnight Monday; the deadline had been last Monday and
then was extended a day, to Tuesday. Western Union said it
wants at least 95% of $500 million in 19.25% senior secured
notes exchanged, and at least 80% of $30 million in 16%
notes. As of Tuesday, $322 million and $1.2 million,
respectively, had been tendered by holders, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Last week, holders of Western Union preferred stock
approved reclassification of the shares to common stock, an
important part of the recapitalization plan. Western Union
has said it could face a bankruptcy-court filing without the
recapitalization.</p>
