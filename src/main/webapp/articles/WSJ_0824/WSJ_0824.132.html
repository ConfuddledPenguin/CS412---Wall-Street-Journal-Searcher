	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. FACES a long stay in Saudi Arabia, however the
current crisis ends.
   Even if Bush succeeds in pushing out Iraq, analysts see no
scenario in which the threat to the Persian Gulf oil fields
recedes. "If we leave, they will be threatened again," says
Henry Schuler of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies. The U.S. has effectively assumed the role of
protecting all the Gulf states, including Qatar, Bahrain and
the United Arab Emirates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>One sign of a long stay: Many U.S. troops are taking over
abandoned Saudi work camps with permanent structures. But
America's new role raises major problems. One is how much of
the tab will be picked up by the Saudis and by other
countries that depend on Gulf oil. Another is sustaining
support at home and morale among the troops for defending
non-democracies whose customs differ sharply from Western
ideals.</p>
<p>"What is clear," says economic consultant David Smick, "is
that the U.S. now has a 51st state: Saudi Arabia."</p>
<p>OUT IN THE COLD: Top Bush aides put the freeze on the
Energy Department.</p>
<p>Sununu and Darman seek to rein in the department, which
they see as too eager to act. The White House vetoed DOE
plans to pump oil from the strategic petroleum reserve,
despite growing pressure with oil prices over $30 a barrel.
"You want to use it when you have a situation where supply
suggests it is necessary," says an administration official,
"and we're not there yet."</p>
<p>Some department officials hoped for a high-profile
announcement of major energy conservation measures, but the
White House limited them to minor measures and refused to
give the announcement a presidential push.</p>
<p>RECESSION FEARS could become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>With the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showing
the number of voters expecting a downturn more than doubling
since Iraq's invasion, University of Michigan economist
Thomas Juster says that such sentiment could itself push the
economy over the brink. In almost all recent recessions, he
says, "the trigger has been a drop in consumer spending on
discretionary items."</p>
<p>Richard Curtin, who compiles the university's closely
watched consumer-confidence survey, says "attitudes were very
bleak indeed the first weekend after the invasion." Optimism
has increased a bit since, he says, but remains "much lower"
than a month ago. Today's GNP revisions will further show the
economy's weakness even before the crisis erupted.</p>
<p>But Bush strategists hope to blame Saddam Hussein for a
recession that may well have happened anyway.</p>
<p>CALIFORNIA'S DECISION to hold its 1992 primary right after
New Hampshire's juggles the political calculus. The early
primary in a large, media-oriented state will give an even
bigger advantage to well-financed and well-known candidates
like Cuomo and Jackson; Democratic insiders expect financial
obstacles will keep some lesser-known candidates out of the
race.</p>
<p>PAKISTAN'S U.S. AID is in peril if its interim government
refuses to let deposed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto take
part in October elections. Not just liberals but also
conservative Democrats like Sen. Johnston and Republicans
such as Sen. Kassebaum warn that a cutoff of the massive U.S.
assistance is possible.</p>
<p>DEMOCRATS DISTRIBUTE a briefing book to candidates urging
them to charge Republicans who raise the S&L issue with
seeking to distract from GOP failures ranging from the
deficit to the Hubble telescope. The book also suggests the
government manage S&L assets rather than sell them off: "Can
an empty shopping center make a good day care center?"</p>
<p>VOICE FROM THE PAST: George McGovern, the 1972 Democratic
presidential nominee, suggests public support for Bush's
Middle East moves will wane. "Is the emir of Kuwait and the
royal family of Saudi Arabia the American way of life?" he
asks. "If I were in Bush's shoes, I would try to get this to
the conference table as quickly as possible."</p>
<p>POLITICAL MONEY nears record levels despite Congress's
talk of reform.</p>
<p>House candidates have already outstripped all previous
fund-raising -- more than $163 million as of June 30. Senate
candidates are slightly behind the pace of their record
spending of 1986, but have raised more than $115 million,
with Republicans enjoying a slight edge over Democrats.</p>
<p>Candidates resort to ever-more-innovative schemes. Former
Maine Rep. David Emery, trying to win back his old seat,
offers a two-day Kennebunkport package to PAC managers in
Washington. For $5,000, they get a reception with Bush at a
local seafood restaurant, a photo with him, accommodations at
a local inn and greens fees.</p>
<p>Sen. Packwood sends a fund-raising letter to pro-Israel
donors, complete with typos to make it look personal.</p>
<p>MINOR MEMOS: In a TV commercial on his former Ku Klux Klan
membership, Louisiana Senate candidate David Duke says,
"There are different Klans, just like there's different
fraternities at a college." . . . The Chicago Cubs streamer
flying outside columnist George Will's home is replaced by
one for the more-successful White Sox. . . . Silver lining
department: "Situation in Middle East Could Help Cruise
Industry," proclaims a news release from a Florida cruise
agency.</p>
