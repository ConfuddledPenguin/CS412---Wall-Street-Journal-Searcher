	<p class="article-leader">George Bush is earning well-deserved praise for his
handling of the crisis in the Persian Gulf. It will be an
unhappy paradox if he wins the war in the Gulf while
simultaneously losing the American economy. Yesterday in
Kennebunkport, the White House put out a statement that it
was monitoring the turmoil in the markets but had nothing in
mind to influence them right now. Today, however, Mr. Bush
will meet with his economic advisers, including Treasury
Secretary Brady, Chief of Staff Sununu and OMB chief Darman.
Whatever else this group may discuss, we hope it takes up the
possibility of President Bush applying to the economy the
quality he's brought to the Gulf -- leadership.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its remarkable
plunge yesterday, falling more than 75 points to finish below
2,500. Admittedly, there is little concrete action that a
President can take on short notice to turn around the sort of
financial debacle we witnessed this week. But the Bush team
ought to try to stand back a bit and recognize the
extraordinary amount of negative static in the market right
now, for which it bears some responsibility.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Middle East crisis, with oil prices running up over
$30, has no doubt rattled the market. But consider the
pre-existing status quo to which this crisis is merely an
appendage: a clearly floundering budget summit, the
expectation of new taxes of some sort, the possibility of a
stock-transfer tax, a Democratic leadership determined to
stop at all costs a cut in the capital-gains tax, an
administration lobbying for easier money and sniping at the
Federal Reserve's independence, the potential for
stagflation, the expected passage of a $30 billion-plus Clean
Air bill, a credit crunch driven in part by fears of
regulatory overkill and prosecutions.</p>
<p>We suspect that what the market would most like to have
right now is reason to believe that the Bush administration
isn't abandoning it to this economic quagmire, while its time
and attention is consumed with Saddam Hussein. There are
indeed several things the White House could do to give the
economy a measure of much-needed confidence:</p>
<p>Recognize and acknowledge that the budget-summit status
quo has been overtaken by events. There really is no time now
to play a drawn-out end-game over the budget with the
Democrats. With a changed set of circumstances, the emphasis
should shift away from recessionary tax increases and over to
the spending side, which now consumes real resources. The
stock-transfer tax, for instance, is a nutty idea. Why not
say so? The recurring White House statement that "everything
is on the table" is akin to saying that as-yet-unnamed
members of the economy are going to be taken out and shot. So
until then, everyone stops investing in the future.</p>
<p>Reassert the Fed's independence. Up to now the point of
the Fed bashing has been easier money. But with the dollar
tumbling and inflation in the air, that policy is more
feckless than ever. It's time to help the markets believe
that the Fed will be allowed to conduct policy through the
Iraqi crisis without someone gnawing on its independence.</p>
<p>Press hard for a capital-gains cut. Beyond the Senate
Majority Leader's coterie, the economic case for cutting
capital gains is pretty much settled. It's an economic
incentive to stimulate and reward investment. With the Fed
now obligated to focus on inflation, a capital-gains cut (if
necessary, coupled with a payroll-tax cut) is the one power
source available to jumpstart the economy. We suspect a
majority of Senators would still agree.</p>
<p>Take steps to pump up domestic energy supply. Where the
law allows, President Bush should declare a national security
emergency to nullify prohibitions against drilling.
Restrictions on drilling off the coasts of California and
North Carolina are prime candidates. The Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge and Point Arguello off the Santa Barbara
coast are the country's most promising reserves.</p>
<p>On balance, this has been a good few weeks for George
Bush. An administration, however, operates at its peril if it
fails to recognize that a market plunge the magnitude of this
week's is a sign its economic policy deserves some immediate
attention.</p>
