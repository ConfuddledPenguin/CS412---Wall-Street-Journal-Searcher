	<p class="article-leader">Procter & Gamble Co. dropped its plans to market Maalox
antacid and other Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. products, bowing
to an antitrust lawsuit by the Justice Department.
   Federal prosecutors had challenged the marketing pact in a
lawsuit filed this month because it would give P&G, makers of
Pepto-Bismol, too big a share of the over-the-counter stomach
remedies market. Justice Department officials estimate that
P&G and Rorer had combined sales of $236 million in that $900
million market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While both companies still assert that joining forces
doesn't create antitrust problems, they decided they'd rather
quit than fight the U.S. government.</p>
<p>For Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the immediate impact of the
failed marriage is a $30 million reduction in its pretax
income for fiscal 1990. That was the one-time payment
expected from P&G for the right to market Maalox and other
products.</p>
<p>In 1989, Rorer Group Inc. reported net income of $86.5
million on sales of $1.2 billion. This year Paris-based
Rhone-Poulenc S.A., a chemical company, merged most of its
drug business with Rorer, of Fort Washington, Pa., to form
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer.</p>
<p>The marketing and distribution pact included several
over-the-counter and prescription drugs, such as Perdiem, a
laxative, and Ascriptin, a combination analgesic-antacid. But
Maalox seemed to be the most appealing label to P&G because
it is the leading antacid in the U.S., with about a 15%
market share. The marketing agreement also was an inexpensive
way for P&G to launch new products under the Maalox name.</p>
<p>Now some industry experts say P&G will unveil its own
antacid brand or sell new products under the Pepto-Bismol
name. P&G offered no clues, saying only that it remains
interested in antacids.</p>
<p>Although Rhone-Poulenc Rorer says it will continue to
manage the Maalox business, as well as the other brands,
others expect new suitors to offer marketing proposals.</p>
<p>The dilemma for Rorer in the past has been how to spend
heavily on Maalox marketing while also building its research
and development program. P&G was a good partner because it
has the marketing clout to build up the brand.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of the drug industry was interested the
last time, so there are plenty of places to go," said Gary
Stibel, a consultant with New England Consulting Group, which
has represented drug companies in such ventures. "The
question is, what will the feds allow?"</p>
