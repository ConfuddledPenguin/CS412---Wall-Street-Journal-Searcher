	<p class="article-leader">Hang Seng Bank Ltd. reported that consolidated profit
after taxes and transfers to inner reserves spurted 17% to
651 million Hong Kong dollars (US$83.7 million) in the first
half from HK$556 million (US$71 million) a year earlier,
helped by the modest rebound of the local economy.
   The bank, a unit of Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.,
said share earnings rose 17% to 65.7 cents from 56.2 cents.
Its directors proposed raising the interim dividend to 27
cents from 22.5 cents.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hang Seng, based in Hong Kong, cited improved deposits and
loans, driven by the local economy's improvement over the
course of the half. It expects its full-year dividend to
reach at least HK$1.20 following 1989's HK$1 payout.</p>
<p>Keith Wu, senior research manager at Citicorp Scrimgeour
Vickers Hong Kong Ltd., termed the results "extremely
encouraging," and reflective of the group's success in
capitalizing on high interest rates.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu said the bank generally manipulates its figures so
it can report a stronger performance in the second half than
the interim period. But he quickly dismissed the notion that
the results portend well for its parent, which reports
Tuesday and is expected to be hard hit by its operations in
the U.S. and Australia.</p>
