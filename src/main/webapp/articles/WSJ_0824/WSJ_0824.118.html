	<p class="article-leader">Yugo America Inc., the troubled unit of the Yugoslavian
car maker, tapped tiny ad agency Buckley/DeCerchio to try to
revive its failing fortunes and to combat its reputation as
an auto industry joke.
   Yugo, which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings just
last December, said it will spend $8 million to $10 million
on advertising in a bid to make a comeback. That won't be an
easy trick: The car maker has taken a beating in the image
department following years of complaints about reliability
and plummeting sales.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"What we really have to do is overcome the `Yugo image,'
which isn't as bad as everybody says it is," said John
Spiech, president and chief executive officer of Yugo
America, a unit of Zavodi Crvena Zastava. "But you can't do
it overnight. It takes awhile to come back."</p>
<p>Mr. Spiech conceded Yugo faces a mighty challenge to
overcome years of sliding sales and negative publicity. The
Yugo remains a favorite target of late-night comics. The
company also must fight a reputation for pumping out cars
that are flimsy and unsafe.</p>
<p>Yugo is attempting to address these problems in its first
commercial in more than a year, which Buckley/DeCerchio is
filming now in Los Angeles. The ad, which will pitch the
$4,335 GV Plus model, is expected to portray a big rig
lifting the car, turning it over and shaking it vigorously.</p>
<p>"We want people to look at this commercial and say, `Hey,
this car is reliable,'" Mr. Spiech said. "That's the
statement we need to make." The ad will begin airing Sept.
10.</p>
<p>But it isn't clear that simple advertising can clear up
such deep-rooted problems. While a $10 million ad budget may
be a step up for Yugo, it pales in comparison with the
budgets of other U.S. and Japanese auto makers, which
routinely spend upward of $100 million annually.</p>
<p>Sales have been on a precipitous decline at Yugo. In the
first seven months of this year, it sold only about 4,300
cars in the U.S., down from 6,400 in the year-earlier period
and way down from 31,000 cars in the first seven months of
1987.</p>
<p>For Buckley/DeCerchio, the account almost doubles the size
of the trendy young shop to $23 million in billings. The
addition of an auto account also gives the agency, which
until now has been known for relatively small clients such as
Snapple beverages, an added measure of respectability. Jane
Cavalier, the shop's president, said yesterday that Yugo
immediately becomes the agency's largest client.</p>
<p>The account also may help establish Buckley/DeCerchio as a
serious shop. Tom DeCerchio, 30 years old, and Bryan Buckley,
26, a former creative team at Chiat/Day, left their posts at
the hot shop to start the agency in August 1988. The two set
up their business in Mr. DeCerchio's one-bedroom Manhattan
apartment, having snagged the $6 million Godfather's Pizza
account, which they still service. After picking up several
other small pieces of business, the executives just this year
moved out of the apartment and opened an office in New York's
SoHo district.</p>
<p>"For our company, this is a chance to build a brand that's
coming back and attach a personality to it," said Mr. Buckley
of his agency's new assignment. "We're going to give people a
reason to drive this car. This is a great opportunity."</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>IRISH DEAL: Young & Rubicam said it agreed to take a large
minority stake in Javelin, a Dublin-based agency with annual
billings of $3 million and a staff of 24. Terms weren't
disclosed. With this purchase, Young & Rubicam said it will
be represented in 19 European countries.</p>
