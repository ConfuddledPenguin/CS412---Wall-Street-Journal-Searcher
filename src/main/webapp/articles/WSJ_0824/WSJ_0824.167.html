	<p class="article-leader">Regarding your July 27 editorial "The Great Non-Litmus," I
agree that the Supreme Court is becoming increasingly
irrelevant with regard to abortion, because of both the
galvanization of the pro-choice forces and the growing
inclination of the justices to let the states resolve the
issue. I also think your optimism that the political system
can now work out the issue may also be correct. That is not
to say, however, that the legislative marketplace would have
reached a satisfactory equilibrium on abortion by now had the
court never involved itself.
   Despite widespread sentiment for some loosening of
abortion restrictions prior to Roe v. Wade, a majority of
state legislators were reluctant to act. It is baffling how
some states could prohibit abortions in the case of rape or
incest despite overwhelming popular sentiment to the
contrary.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hence, the role of the Supreme Court. The court set
controlling normative values on abortion with which many
people clearly agree. It also may have set norms that are
beyond what the majority would accept. The Roe decision
certainly created a framework that was much broader than
necessary to resolve the case before it. The irrelevancy of
the court with regard to abortion, however, as measured by
the current state political battles, is due mainly to popular
acceptance of much of what the court decided in Roe. If the
court had never interfered with the state legislatures, I
doubt that they would have reached a political solution that
incorporated the existing sentiment for some liberalization
of abortion restrictions.</p>

<p>You find Roe v. Wade unconstitutional because "the word
`abortion' does not occur in the Constitution."</p>
<p>These words do appear: "The enumeration in the
Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to
deny or disparage others retained by the people" (Ninth
Amendment), and "No state shall make or enforce any law which
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the
United States; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws" (14th Amendment).</p>
<p>Over the years, the court has found that the Ninth
Amendment protects us from government interference in such
matters as personal medical decisions and contraception. It
doesn't take a great legal leap to reason that to restrict
abortion would interfere with the personal medical choices of
a woman in a way that cannot be applied to a man, thus
violating both the Ninth and the 14th amendments. Leaving
abortion to the political process means that women's status
as equal citizens will vary from state to state, from year to
year.</p>

<p>Your editorial asserted with derision that if Louisiana
adopted its proposed highly restrictive abortion law, the
worst thing that would happen is that women would have to
cross a state line to obtain an abortion. Was your subsequent
July 30 "Notable & Quotable" excerpt from the Alan Guttmacher
Institute's recent report -- noting that because of a sharp
decrease in the availability of abortion services, many women
must travel long distances to obtain these services,
increasing the likelihood that the abortion will take place
later in pregnancy when the health risks are greater --
intended as counterpoint or atonement?</p>
<p>Having to travel not only takes time and causes delay, it
also costs money. Traveling long distances also separates the
woman from her family and friends, requires time off from
work, and leaves her without follow-up medical care. Before
you decide that barriers to exercising any kind of right are
inconsequential, check out what those barriers mean to the
individuals who will have to surmount them.</p>
