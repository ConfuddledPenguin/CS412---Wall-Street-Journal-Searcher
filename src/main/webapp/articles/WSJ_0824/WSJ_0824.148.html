	<h3>Heard on the Street: Scott Paper, One of Industry's Buoyant Few, Seen by Some as Just About Recession-Proof</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- As the stock market sinks into the depths
on fears of war and recession, why is Scott Paper one of the
few paper companies bobbing along with only a minor dip?
   It can't be the company's earnings. The maker of bathroom
tissue, paper towels and printing papers earned about $4.11 a
share last year before one-time gains, almost the same as in
1988 and well below the $5 some analysts expected. And this
year's first-half earnings of $1.83 a share were 11% below
the year-ago profit, prompting even the most bullish analysts
to project another flat full year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>It isn't the dividend that's attracting investors; Scott
yields a modest 1.8%. Clearly, it isn't the state of the
paper industry, which is in the midst of a cyclical downturn.
Nor is the Street abuzz about the double-digit earnings
growth Scott has achieved under Philip E. Lippincott who, in
1983, became chief executive officer and began to revitalize
the company.</p>
<p>What is buoying Scott's stock is a widespread belief that
the company is just about recession-proof. Never mind that
paper-products companies' stocks are down 17% since year end
and that the market is off 13%, as measured by the Dow Jones
Equity Market Index. Scott is down less than 3% year-to-date,
despite a 2 1/4 drop yesterday to 43 7/8.</p>
<p>The case for the stock is simple: "Tissue is more
necessary than discretionary," says Gary Palmero, an
Oppenheimer & Co. analyst. If anything, he says, Scott should
see demand surge, as its new machines in France, Italy, and
Spain come on line and it assimilates a recently acquired 51%
of Feldmuhle AG's European tissue operations. Use of sanitary
tissue products is growing steadily in Western Europe, where
it now stands at 15 pounds a year per capita compared with
more than 39 pounds for Americans.</p>
<p>Costs are declining for pulp, the tree fibers used to make
paper. List prices for one benchmark pulp grade are off $40 a
ton from last year's peak and heading lower, says Evadna Lynn
of Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>Ms. Lynn recently began following Scott with a strong
"buy" recommendation. She estimates that every $50-a-ton drop
in pulp prices adds about 25 cents a share to the company's
final profit.</p>
<p>Although costly production snafus have dogged Scott's
printing paper division, "the problems are diminishing," says
George Adler of Smith Barney. He expects Scott to earn about
$4.75 a share in 1991.</p>
<p>The stock is a bargain at yesterday's level of about 10
times estimated earnings for 1990, Mr. Adler says. "The
market is taking a `show me' attitude," he says. Even
Kimberly-Clark, a recent favorite of recession-wary
investors, is comparatively expensive at about 12 times this
year's estimate of earnings before a one-time charge.</p>
<p>As the market recognizes Scott's value, Mr. Adler says, he
sees Scott's share price rising to about $55 in the next six
months and to "at least" $65 by the end of 1991.</p>
<p>But some analysts caution that Scott's recent performance
has so far offered little proof of its supposed potential.
Furthermore, the bears say Scott isn't quite as
recession-resistant as some investors believe.</p>
<p>Scott is particularly vulnerable to a downturn in the
market for its cash cow, printing papers, says Bruce Kirk, an
analyst with S.G. Warburg & Co. In 1989, 44% of Scott's
pretax operating profit came from that division.</p>
<p>"In some way, shape or form, coated paper ends up in
advertising-related businesses" such as magazines and
catalogs, Mr. Kirk says, adding: "If the economy in general
is soft, the advertising is sluggish with it, and coated
paper doesn't grow."</p>
<p>Rival makers of coated paper will be adding new machines
in the next two years, threatening overcapacity.
"Coated-paper prices will come under pressure," says Sherman
Chao of Salomon Brothers. In the tissue business, Europe
could become a profitless battleground if Kimberly, Scott,
James River and European companies slash prices to capture
market share.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, skeptics contend that investors in the stock
may be setting themselves up for a beating on the next poor
earnings report. "Investors have been willing to give Scott
Paper and its management the benefit of the doubt, saying
`Let's wait one more quarter,'" Mr. Chao asserts. "At some
point, someone is going to give up," he adds.</p>
