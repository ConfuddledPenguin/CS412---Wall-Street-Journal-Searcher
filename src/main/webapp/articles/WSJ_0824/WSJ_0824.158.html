	<p class="article-leader">THE U.S. FACED a crucial test in Kuwait over Iraq's threat
to close embassies.
   As the Bush administration's war of nerves with the Iraqis
intensified over Saddam Hussein's order that Western
embassies in Kuwait shut down today -- and with most vowing
they will remain open -- the U.S. acted to forge a global
effort to aid nations hurt by the embargo of Iraq. U.S.
officials analyzed the needs of Jordan, Egypt and Turkey, and
Bush reportedly asked Japan's Kaifu to help some nations.
Israeli military sources said Jordanian officers have been
training Iraqis to use U.S.-made Hawk anti-aircraft missiles
captured from Kuwait. And Kuwaiti officials said Baghdad has
mined most of Kuwait's oil wells and threatened to blow them
up if there is an attack.</p>

<p>ARMENIA'S PARLIAMENT PASSED a declaration of independence
from Moscow.</p>
<p>The southern republic's legislators voted to assume
control over defense, foreign and economic policy, and
resolved to reunite with the disputed territory of
Nagorno-Karabakh. While the statement stopped short of
calling for a complete break with the Kremlin, Armenia became
the fifth of the 15 Soviet republics to move toward
secession.</p>
<p>Estonia began formal talks with Moscow on separation, and
the republic of Turkmenia declared the right to overturn
Soviet laws on its territory.</p>

<p>Black nationalist leader Mandela urged the South African
government to deploy troops in black townships near
Johannesburg, as members of the Zulu and Xhosa tribes clashed
for the 12th day with spears, axes and knives. President de

fighting, which has claimed over 500 lives.</p>

<p>A panel of federal judges recommended that television
cameras be allowed in federal courtrooms on an experimental
basis. The experiment, which requires the approval of the
U.S. Judicial Conference, would allow cameras into civil
proceedings in six district courts and two appeals courts for
three years.</p>

<p>Researchers halted the growth of colon cancer cells in a
test tube by replacing a damaged gene with its normal
version. The experiment supports a theory that certain genes
normally prevent uncontrolled, malignant cell growth and that
cancer arises when these "tumor suppressor" genes are
inactivated.</p>

<p>FDA scientists documented their belief that a synthetic
growth hormone designed to boost cows' milk production poses
no health risk. The agency released a review of over 120
studies to support its statements that milk and meat from
cows treated with bovine growth hormone, which is still not
approved, are safe.</p>

<p>The West German government welcomed East Germany's
decision to fix Oct. 3 as the date the two nations will
merge, expressing relief that bickering about the timing of
unification was over. The East German Parliament approved the
date late Wednesday, and it requires no ratification from
Bonn.</p>

<p>Moderate Southern Baptists discussed plans to withdraw

that has ruled the denomination for over a decade.</p>

<p>NASA said it replaced part of the computer memory of the
Venus-orbiting Magellan spacecraft, which broke off radio
contact temporarily Wednesday for the second time within a
week. Magellan is on a $744 million mission to use its radar
to make pictures and maps of the planet's surface.</p>

<p>West African troops set sail from Sierra Leone to enforce
a cease-fire in Liberia, where a rebel army led by Charles
Taylor threatened to fight them. The West African Economic
Community, which mobilized the 3,000 soldiers, emphasized
that the task force was on a peaceful mission to halt the
eight-month-old civil war.</p>

<p>Israel's finance minister said he would ask the U.S. for
more military and other aid when he visits Washington next

assistance is sought by the Israeli government, which
currently receives about $3 billion annually from the U.S.</p>
