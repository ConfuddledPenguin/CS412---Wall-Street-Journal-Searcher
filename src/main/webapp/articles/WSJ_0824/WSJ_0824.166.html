	<p class="article-leader">ISTANBUL, Turkey -- Surrounded by glossy mockups for a new
ad campaign, Cem Kozlu, Turkish Airlines' new chairman and
chief executive officer, enthusiastically outlines his goal:
"The key thing is to change the mentality of a monopoly to a
customer-oriented company."
   In Athens, Greece, Loukas Grammatikos, the new
director-general of Olympic Airways, has just returned from
New York and looks tired -- for good reason. The 24-year
veteran of the Greek carrier piloted the Boeing 747 to New
York and back as part of his regular duties.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>His concerns differ substantially from Mr. Kozlu's. The
Greek government hasn't yet agreed to raise the skimpy
capital base of the loss-making airline. Olympic's fleet
renewal program has been messy and long. "If we improve our
service," Mr. Grammatikos says, "if we solve our financial
problems, if we renew the fleet, then I think the company can
survive."</p>
<p>The two small Mediterranean airlines have their
similarities: Both are state-owned, overstaffed and
undercapitalized and offer indifferent service. State
meddling and labor unrest often undermine management
initiatives. Each is burdened with unprofitable domestic
route networks. Neither has a sterling safety record.</p>
<p>Yet there are huge differences, too. One is profitable,
the other not; one is free of subsidies, the other dependent
on the state.</p>
<p>Both, however, say they are doing their best to guarantee
better futures.</p>
<p>A restructured Turkish Airlines has benefited from seven
years of a free-market government and is on course to cope
with more competitive skies as Europe and the world gradually
deregulate aviation. The government still plans to sell
shares in the profitable carrier on the Istanbul Stock
Exchange this year.</p>
<p>Olympic, on the other hand, provides a handy freeze-frame
look at what can happen if a government and its state airline
don't change old, unprofitable ways. Trying to do anything at
Olympic, says a government official familiar with the
company, "is like trying to run in water."</p>
<p>Olympic reflects Athens's less than successful economic
policies. It is heavily subsidized but still loses money,
having piled up 60 billion drachmas ($378 million) of
interest-bearing debt to the state. It can't -- or won't --
pay its fuel bills at home. Several initiatives to
restructure the company in the 1980s came to naught. Mr.
Grammatikos and Olympic's new chairman, Vassilios Filias --
the requisite political appointee, he is a sociology
professor with no airline experience -- appear thus far
unable to steer the wayward monopoly toward efficiency.</p>
<p>It wasn't always this way at Olympic. In 1957, billionaire
ship-owner Aristotle Onassis took over a small airline the
state had created after the war. He named it Olympic and by
many accounts ran it skillfully. But when fuel prices shot up
in 1974, the state wouldn't allow Mr. Onassis to raise fares
to the 33 domestic airports the airline served. The company
started running heavy losses, and Mr. Onassis sold it back to
the government.</p>
<p>It has been downhill for Olympic ever since.</p>
<p>Under state ownership, Olympic became a place where failed
politicians and ministers' nephews found jobs, according to
government officials and former employees. The number of
staff zoomed from 6,000 in the Onassis days to nearly 13,000
(plus 2,000 in the catering operation) today. Olympic has 38
jetliners and last year carried 6.7 million passengers,
two-thirds of them on domestic routes.</p>
<p>The airline's government-set domestic fares are too low to
be profitable -- 48% below Spain's, the next cheapest in
Europe. Olympic had negative operating results in six of the
past 10 years. Mr. Grammatikos says he expects the carrier's
losses to narrow this year to 10 billion drachmas on revenue
of 160 billion drachmas. But interest expenses are expected
to be 23% of revenue this year, an enormous amount compared
with the European airline average of 2% to 3%.</p>
<p>In recent talks with the Greek finance minister, Mr.
Grammatikos asked for a 30 billion drachma capital increase,
which would raise Olympic's measly capitalization to 55
billion drachmas. The minister "was favorably indifferent, or
indifferently favorable," said the 54-year-old pilot. "He
didn't say no."</p>
<p>The government has said it doesn't intend to take the
airline private, a position that pleases its unions. Mr.
Grammatikos thinks that's a shame. "If private capital got
into the company, it would give Olympic more dynamism and
force it to operate as a free-enterprise company in a free
market," he says. A bill pending in the Greek Parliament --
one that is provoking nationwide strikes -- would take
Olympic and other state enterprises out of the public sector.</p>
<p>Unlike Olympic, Turkish Airlines, or Turk Hava Yollari as
it's known at home, isn't questioning its survival. In
Turkey's past seven years under President Turgut Ozal,
foreign-exchange controls have been dropped, an export boom
and rapid tourism development have ended hard-currency
shortages, and Turkish Airlines is flowering under Ankara's
hands-off attitude and Mr. Kozlu's management.</p>
<p>The government used to put retired generals at the helm of
the airline, with predictable results. But in 1988, Mr.
Ozal's government decided to expand Turkish Air and make it
more competitive internationally. That was when it pensioned
off the general in charge and brought in Mr. Kozlu.</p>
<p>The 43-year-old executive says he learned from Stanford
Business School and Procter & Gamble Co. about management by
objective, strategic planning and the case-study approach.
From his doctorate in management from Istanbul's Bosphorus
University and from his stint as managing director of Turkish
trading company Komili Holding AS, he learned about
international trade and competition.</p>
<p>Turkish Airlines is no longer a monopoly. At least 10 new
charter, scheduled and commuter airlines compete against the
state-owned carrier and the foreign airlines that serve
Turkey. The company was profitable through most of the 1980s
and last year earned $2 million on revenue of $542 million.
Mr. Kozlu expects 1990 profit to reach $15 million.</p>
<p>In trying to meet its competition, Turkish Air has created
its own charter airline, has moved to improve service in
several areas and is studying ways to trim its staff while
increasing its efficiency.</p>
<p>To capitalize on Turkey's booming tourist trade, the
carrier teamed up with West Germany's Lufthansa last year to
create a charter airline, Sunexpress, based in Antalya,
Turkey, that flies with leased Boeing Co. 737s to northern
Europe.</p>
<p>To win the loyalty of Turks traveling abroad, Turkish Air
launched a frequent-flier program, and about 4,000 people
have paid $50 each to sign up.</p>
<p>The carrier still has a way to go, however. On a recent
flight, an Istanbul-based British businessman remarked that
flight attendants "are smiling and trying to be helpful," but
nevertheless said he flies with the competition whenever
possible.</p>
<p>After taking over in October 1988, one of Mr. Kozlu's
first goals was to improve on-time performance, in which
Turkish Air then ranked lowest among the 21 members of the
Association of European Airlines. Now, it's the fourth
highest. Next year, he says, he intends to separate the
domestic fleet from the international fleet to further reduce
delays. Of the carrier's 4.2 million passengers last year,
56% flew on domestic routes.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozlu also has had the planes repainted, given flight
attendants new uniforms and set about redecorating overseas
offices. Employees who speak foreign languages now get extra
pay, and 600 staffers are taking language lessons at company
expense.</p>
