	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Imperial Oil Ltd., 70%-owned by Exxon Corp.,
said it is seeking a buyer for a coal mine near Sparwood,
British Columbia.
   The mine produces about 1.6 million metric tons of coal
annually and has annual revenue of 50 million to 100 million
Canadian dollars (US$44 million to US$88 million), a
spokesman said. A metric ton is about 2,204.62 pounds.</p>

reduce debt from the oil and gas concern's C$5 billion
acquisition of Texaco Canada Inc. this year.</p>
