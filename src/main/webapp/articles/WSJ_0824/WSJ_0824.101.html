	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The prospect of an imminent war in the Persian
Gulf battered bonds again, prompting investors to take cover
by buying short-term Treasury notes and bills, the safest
securities available.
   The "flight-to-quality" buying spree was evident in price
quotes posted for long-term securities relative to short-term
securities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond, for example, fell
3/4 points for a loss of about $7.50 for a bond with a $1,000
face amount. The issue's closing yield jumped to 9.13%, the
highest on the bond since April 14, 1989 when it was 9.14%,
according to Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</p>
<p>Short-term Treasury notes and bills, however, ended
unchanged or modestly higher in brisk trading. Dealers said
investors decided to flee the battered stock market and
unwind their money-losing long-term bond positions, using
proceeds to buy short-term securities. As a result, prices
for two-year Treasury notes held firm and the yield was
unchanged at 8.24%. The discount rate on three-month Treasury
bills fell to 7.53% from 7.59% Wednesday.</p>
<p>William Sullivan, director of money market research at
Dean Witter, said the flight-to-quality buying was first
evident in Tokyo, where investors bailed out of the Japanese
stock market as the Nikkei index of 225 Japanese stocks
plunged 1473.28 points to 23,737.63. That was the
fourth-largest single-day decline in that market.</p>
<p>In the broader bond market, prices were knocked sharply
lower. Once again, the market's nemesis was rising oil
prices, which investors fear will lead to spiraling inflation
and interest rates. Fixed-income investors dislike inflation
because it cuts the value of their portfolios by reducing the
inflation-adjusted return.</p>
<p>After hitting a five-year high Wednesday, October oil
futures ended at $31.93 a barrel yesterday, up 71 cents.</p>
<p>Douglas Schindewolf, vice president and money market
economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., said investors
are paralyzed by the fear of inflation and "uncertainty about
how high oil could go in the event of an actual armed
conflict."</p>
<p>Many analysts expect further declines in government
securities, accompanied by higher yields, as long as the
focus remains on oil prices and the Persian Gulf, and not on
economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>"Forecasting rates is hazardous business with the events
in the Middle East so unpredictable, but I think rates will
grid a bit higher," said James Fralick, an economist at
Morgan Stanley & Co.</p>
<p>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has said foreign embassies
in Kuwait must be closed by today, and threatened that
embassy personnel remaining in the oil-rich Arab kingdom
could be stripped of their diplomatic status if they remain.</p>
<p>President Bush, along with other Western leaders, has said
he will not abide by Mr. Hussein's deadline and will keep the
U.S. Embassy open.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow's deadline could be the triggerpoint," for the
first clash between U.S. and Iraqi forces, said Mr.
Schindewolf.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Commerce Department today will release
revisions to second-quarter gross national product data.
Economists believe the figure will be revised upward to an
inflation-adjusted annual rate of 1.5% from 1.2%, according
to a Dow Jones Capital Markets Report.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>British government bonds continued to recuperate from a
severe oil-related beating while prices in West Germany were
modestly lower.</p>
<p>But in Japan, which imports all of its oil, the bond
market rout continued. Traders said higher oil prices and a
disappointing government bond auction pushed yields on
Japan's benchmark 10-year bond to the highest levels in
nearly a decade.</p>
<p>In Tokyo trading, the yield on the benchmark No. 119
10-year bond ended at 8.31% as the issue's price fell to
82.21, down 0.82 points. The yield on nearest bond futures
contract ended at 88.45, down 1.03 points, to yield 8.089%.
That was the highest yield ever for a bond futures contract.
(When calculated using the semiannual compound measure, the
yield on the No. 119 bond ended at 7.60%, according to
Salomon Brothers Inc.)</p>
<p>As prices sank, the Japanese Finance Ministry attempted to
support the bond market by purchasing 90 billion yen of
10-year bonds. But the purchase had almost no influence on
the market.</p>
<p>With yields for existing bonds above 8%, traders said
investors weren't interested in buying new 10-year securities
at yesterday's government auction because the 7.53% yield on
the securities, which was set by the government, was
considered unattractive. The offer totaled 800 billion yen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Japan's long-term prime rate is expected to
jump to 8.5% from 7.9% currently because the sell-off in the
Japanese bond market has sharply boosted the costs of funds
for banks.</p>
<p>Japan's three long-term credit banks, which reset the
long-term prime rate at the end of each month, are expected
to make the decision to boost the long-term prime rate today.
The three banks are Industrial Bank of Japan, Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan and Nippon Credit Bank.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities</p>
<p>Long-term Treasury bonds were hit hard again, but some
short-term bills and notes ended unchanged or higher.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of
96 1/32 to yield 9.13%, compared with 96 26/32 to yield 9.05%
on Wednesday. The latest 10-year note ended at 98 8/32 to
yield 9% compared with 98 22/32 to yield 8.93%. Two year-note
were unchanged at 99 17/32 to yield 8.24%.</p>
<p>The Treasury yesterday sold $10.52 billion of 52-week
Treasury bills at an average rate of 7.40%.</p>
<p>Next week, the Treasury will sell $11.5 billion of new
two-year notes and $8.5 billion of new five-year notes. In
when-issued trading activity yesterday, the two-year notes
were quoted at yields of 8.24% while the five-year notes were
quoted at yields of 8.67%.</p>
<p>Here are details of yesterday's 52-week Treasury bill
auction:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>
<p>                                         52-Week Bills</p>
<p>Applications .......................... $24,477,190,000</p>
<p>Accepted bids ......................... $10,519,670,000</p>
<p>Accepted at low price .................             48%</p>
<p>Accepted noncompetitively .............    $611,430,000</p>
<p>Average price (Rate) ..................  92.518 (7.40%)</p>
<p>High price (Rate) .....................  92.528 (7.39%)</p>
<p>Low price (Rate) ......................  92.498 (7.42%)</p>
<p>Coupon equivalent .....................           7.95%</p>
<p>The bills are dated Aug. 30, and mature Aug. 29, 1991.</p>
<p>Junk, Corporate Issues</p>
<p>The junk-bond market added to its heavy losses as plunging
stock prices pulled bond prices sharply lower.</p>
<p>Junk bonds plummeted at the opening but managed to stage a
partial rebound at midday after the stock market stabilized.
But when stocks resumed their sharp slide later, junk bonds
followed suit.</p>
<p>Most higher-quality junk bonds ended one point lower, but
mid-to-lower quality issues suffered even greater losses.</p>
<p>One of the biggest losers was RJR Nabisco Inc. Its 17.375%
convertible pay-in-kind debentures fell 2 1/8 points to 106
1/4 while its 17% exchangeable pay-in-kind debentures ended 3
3/4 points lower at 80 3/4.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Fort Howard Corp.'s 14.125% junior debentures
fell two points to 40, Gaylord Container Corp.'s 13.75%
subordinated debentures dropped three points to an offered
price of 62, and National Gypsum's 14.50% senior subordinated
debentures shed two points to 40.</p>
<p>The market's better-quality recession-resistant issues,
such as Duracell Holdings Corp. and Kroger Co., remained
firm.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade market, $600 million in new
corporate debt was priced including a $250 million issue of
five-year issue of Federal Farm Credit Banks notes.</p>
<p>Strong demand prompted underwriters at Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets to increase the size of the issue twice after
pricing. The notes, which are non-callable for two years,
were priced to yield 8.94%.</p>
<p>In the secondary market, high-grade bonds also posted
losses, ending the day about 1/2 point lower.</p>
<p>Municipal Issues</p>
<p>Municipal bonds were 3/8 to one point lower.</p>
<p>In new-issue dealings, seven firms won $550 million of
Texas tax and revenue anticipation notes. The bulk of the
notes were purchased by a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets
group, which priced them with a 6 1/2% coupon to yield 6.18%.</p>
<p>Among dollar bonds, New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.20%
issue due in 2018 was 3/4 point lower at 95 3/4 to yield
7.52%.</p>
<p>Mortgage-Backed Securities</p>
<p>Mortgage-securities prices fell again.</p>
<p>Government National Mortgage Association's 9 1/2%
pass-through securities for September delivery lost 3/8 point
to 97 5/8, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s 9 1/2% issue
fell 10/32 to 97 9/32 and Federal National Mortgage
Association's 9 1/2% securities were 10/32 lower at 97 26/32.</p>
<p>The Department of Veterans Affairs offered $293 million of
mortgage pass-through certificates backed by vendee loans,
which are loans issued to finance the sale of VA-owned
properties acquired as a result of loan defaults.</p>
