	<p class="article-leader">EL SEGUNDO, Calif. -- Softsel Computer Products Inc. said
its shareholders approved a change in the company's name to
Merisel Inc.
   The change, effective immediately, reflects the company's
acquisition in April of Microamerica Inc. Merisel wants to
convey through the name its goal "to combine the best
aspects" of both companies, a spokeswoman said.</p>
