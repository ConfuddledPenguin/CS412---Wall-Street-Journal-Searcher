	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- Allied-Lyons PLC said Suntory Ltd. of Japan, a
beverage concern, increased its shareholding in the British
beverage company to just under 5% from 2.5%.
   Suntory subscribed for 19.1 million new Allied-Lyons
shares at 446 pence each, paying a total of #85 million
($163.8 million). Suntory first acquired shares in
Allied-Lyons in October 1988, forming the joint-venture
company Suntory-Allied Lyons. A standstill agreement between
the two companies prevents Suntory from increasing its stake
beyond 5%.</p>
