	<p class="article-leader">TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Florida Attorney General Robert A.
Butterworth is seeking details of a secret stock agreement
between Times Publishing Co. and a group including Texas
billionaire Robert M. Bass.
   Mr. Butterworth said he is concerned the agreement,
announced last week, may have harmful effects on the Poynter
Institute, a St. Petersburg educational foundation that owns
a majority stake in Times Publishing. And Mr. Butterworth, in
a letter to the institute, said he may take the matter to
court, if necessary.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the stock agreement, Times Publishing, the parent
company of the St. Petersburg Times, is to buy back a 40%
stake owned by the Bass group. The parties agreed not to
disclose certain terms of the transaction, including the
purchase price. As part of the accord, the Bass group also
agreed to drop a lawsuit seeking to force the redemption of a
preferred stock issue.</p>
<p>However, the parties did disclose that under the pact,
preferred stock would be redeemed. And that's what concerns
Mr. Butterworth. He said the Poynter Institute petitioned his
office earlier this year for help in litigation, claiming
that any redemption of the preferred stock would severely
limit the institute's future charitable educational
activities. The Poynter Institute had been receiving
dividends from the preferred stock.</p>
<p>In requesting additional information on the stock deal,
Mr. Butterworth's letter said, "In the absence of any
verifiable explanation to the contrary, the earlier
statements by the Institute . . . can only lead us to
conclude that the fiscal integrity of a charitable
educational institute is now in jeopardy."</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Bass group hadn't any comment. A
prepared statement from Andrew Barnes, chairman of both Times
Publishing and the institute, said, "We are comfortable . . .
that the settlement is fair and assures significant on-going
financial support for the institute."</p>
