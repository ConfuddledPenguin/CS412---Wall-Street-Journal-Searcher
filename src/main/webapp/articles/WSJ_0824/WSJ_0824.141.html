	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A comprehensive Food and Drug Administration
review of research on a synthetic growth hormone reinforces
earlier FDA assertions that milk and meat from dairy cattle
treated with the product are safe for human consumption.
   The FDA study, being published today in the journal
Science, should help dispel consumer concerns about the
genetically engineered product, bovine growth hormone, which
is injected into cows to boost milk production.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>FDA officials are intent on explaining why they authorized
the sale of milk from BGH-treated cows in 1985 when they
approved field tests of the hormone. BGH has yet to be
approved for commercial use.</p>
<p>The authors of the report say that analysis of more than
120 studies has led the agency to conclude that use of BGH
presents "no increased health risk to consumers."</p>
<p>In their report, Judith Juskevich, a former FDA
toxicologist and pharmacologist, and C. Greg Guyer, a chemist
in the agency's Center for Veterinary Medicine, also cite
previously unpublished data from 16 studies underwritten by
biotechnology companies seeking FDA approval to begin
marketing BGH.</p>
<p>These data, among other things, show that BGH is harmless
because it breaks down into inactive fragments in the
gastrointestinal tract while being digested, and that
pasteurization destroys 90% of the BGH in milk, according to
the scientists.</p>
<p>While the findings aren't surprising, the new study is
unusual in several respects. "It's unprecedented for the FDA
to publish such an assessment of scientific data on a drug
before it is approved," said Jeffrey Nesbit, chief spokesman
for the FDA. Submitting data to peer review by a panel of
experts -- in this instance, appointed by the editors of
Science -- is also unprecedented for the agency, he said.</p>
<p>BGH is one of the most promising products of recombinant
DNA technology. Commercial batches can be produced by
genetically engineered bacteria for injection in cows twice a
month. In farm trials, milk yields have jumped 10% to 25%.
BGH, also called bovine somatotropin, is biologically
identical to the natural growth hormone produced by the cow's
pituitary gland.</p>
<p>Some consumer advocates and medical experts have
questioned the validity of the safety studies. As a result,
some of the nation's largest milk processors and distributors
have backed away from BGH, refusing to handle milk from
BGH-treated herds. Nonetheless, Monsanto Co. and other
developers of the synthetic hormone are still counting on a
$500 million-a-year global market for BGH. Publication of the
FDA study in a journal as prestigious as Science lends
credibility to their claims regarding the product's safety.</p>
<p>But the new study "won't speed up or deter the approval of
BGH," Mr. Nesbit said. FDA clearance for commercial use is
expected sometime next year.</p>
