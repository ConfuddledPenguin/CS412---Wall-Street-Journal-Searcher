	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Stock exchange membership prices are falling
along with the price of stocks.
   A seat on the New York Stock Exchange changed hands
yesterday at $301,000, the lowest sale price since Dec. 17,
1984. The last sale at a price below $300,000 took place a
few days earlier in 1984.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On Monday, an American Stock Exchange seat sold for
$107,500, the lowest price since January 1980.</p>
<p>"I would anticipate that if the market continues to
decline, seat prices will decline with it," says Perrin Long,
securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical.</p>
<p>He says it's hard to predict how low seat prices will
fall, as prices will to some degree be tied to market
performance. He says that if the Dow Jones Industrial Average
falls to the 2000 level, NYSE seat prices could fall to the
$200,000 to $225,000 range. The average, which reached a
record high of 2999.75 in mid-July, closed below 2500
yesterday.</p>
<p>Charles Vincent, a vice president and securities analyst
at Provident National Bank, says falling stock prices usually
mean lower trading volume and lower revenue for securities
firms, which cut the value of exchange memberships.</p>
<p>But the drop in exchange seat prices is a trend that long
predates the recent stock plunge tied to Mideast tensions.
Analysts cite the drop-off in equity trading volume from the
high levels of 1986 and early 1987 as one big reason, and Mr.
Long says the increased role of electronic equities trading
also has contributed to the decline in the value of exchange
seats.</p>
<p>NYSE seat prices peaked Sept. 21, 1987, at $1,150,000.
That sale was one of seven made in 1987 for $1 million or
more. After the October 1987 world-wide stock market crash,
seat prices declined. The last sale of 1987 was made on Dec.
29 for $625,000.</p>
