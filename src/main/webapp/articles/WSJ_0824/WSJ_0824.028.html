	<p class="article-leader">AMSTERDAM -- Arie Maas, chairman of the Dutch company that
just bought U.S. toy retailer FAO Schwarz, isn't thinking in
miniature.
   In an interview, the 56-year-old executive says his
company, N.V. Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer, or KBB, will help
expand the small chain of luxury toy stores by opening more
sites in the U.S. and breaking into Europe and Japan. KBB is
also browsing for more U.S. specialty-store chains. Owning
just one small chain in the U.S. wouldn't make financial
sense, Mr. Maas says. But he declines to give any hints about
specific targets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Schwarz purchase marks KBB's second foray into the
U.S., 10 years after a disappointing first attempt.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, KBB faced a common problem for big
players in small markets: It had little room for growth at
home and little experience abroad. Part of the company's
answer was its 1980 acquisition of the Maxway Inc. chain of
discount department stores, figuring its experience with
small towns would be of use for Maxway locations.</p>
<p>Before it could really test that idea, however, KBB was
caught with heavy debts in the early 1980s, just as interest
rates soared and consumer spending dropped in the
Netherlands. In 1982, the company had a loss of 60 million
guilders ($34 million at current rates) and verged on
bankruptcy. It was forced to swallow an emergency injection
of equity from a bigger Dutch retailing rival, Vendex
International N.V., which still owns 36% of KBB.</p>
<p>To reduce its debt, KBB then sold some of its assets,
including Maxway. By the mid-1980s, KBB figured it was
healthy enough to expand again, and this time decided to
diversify into smaller, specialty stores with the flexibility
to respond quickly to fads. In 1987 KBB bought M&S Mode, a
Netherlands-based chain of mid-priced womenswear stores. The
following year, it acquired 60% of in RetailNet, which owns
chains of small Dutch stores specializing in household goods,
baby clothes, toys, lighting and home decor, and other
products.</p>
<p>Finally, KBB felt bold enough to move abroad again, and
began looking to the U.S., where it believed its experience
with Maxway would be helpful. KBB was receptive when a U.S.
retailing consultant proposed the FAO Schwarz deal. KBB won't
disclose how much it paid for FAO Schwarz, but an industry
executive estimates the price at $40 million.</p>
<p>With sales of about $50 million a year, FAO Schwarz is
tiny compared with KBB, whose sales last year totaled Fl 4.16
billion ($2.4 billion). But FAO's prestigious name and tight
focus suit KBB's strategy. FAO Schwarz concentrates on the
top end of the market, selling such items as $7,000 rocking
horses in a dazzling toyland atmosphere. Mr. Maas says that
means FAO doesn't need to worry when mass-market giants such
as Toys "R" Us Inc. play rough.</p>
<p>Pieter Spierings, an analyst at Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank
N.V., says the acquisition looks logical on the surface but
is impossible to assess because KBB hasn't provided financial
details. Mr. Maas will say only that Schwarz is profitable
and that its sales, based on a comparable number of stores,
so far this year are up 20% from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Because Schwarz operates just 17 stores -- including its
famous flagship on Fifth Avenue in New York -- Mr. Maas
figures there is plenty of room for expansion. Over the next
five years, he says, Schwarz could open as many as 60 stores
in the U.S., while continuing to expand its catalog sales.</p>
<p>Schwarz already is studying the possibility of a store in
Tokyo, and Mr. Maas envisions a few stores in Europe,
starting perhaps in Paris or Frankfurt. Another possibility,
he says, is that some Schwarz toys might be sold at KBB's
Bijenkorf department stores. (The stores already have their
own hot-selling teddy bear, called BOB, after the Dutch
initials for "well-educated bear.")</p>
<p>While it experiments abroad, KBB is trying to reinvigorate
its Hema unit. By far KBB's biggest Dutch chain, Hema
accounts for about half the company's sales. But after a long
run of success, Hema's operating profit has declined in the
past three years. The chain, which sells a grab bag of
merchandise running from cheap underwear to fine wines, is
faced with tough competition from exactly the kind of
specialty shops that KBB sees as its future.</p>
<p>Hema "became a little bit sleepy over the past few years,"
says Roel Gooskens, an analyst at Van Meer James Capel N.V.
But KBB's Mr. Maas predicts Hema's results will start to
improve next year as it begins to benefit from new product
lines and renovated stores.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, KBB's RetailNet unit is negotiating to acquire
Bruna BV, a Dutch chain of 450 book and stationery shops.
Eventually, Mr. Maas says, KBB might try to move more of its
specialty shops across borders in Europe. One candidate, he
says, is KBB's Praxis chain of do-it-yourself stores.</p>
<p>Perhaps chastened by its past troubles, however, KBB
promises to proceed slowly. "I always say you can't keep two
watermelons in one hand," says Mr. Maas. "You're likely to
drop both."</p>
