	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of Boston Corp. said its directors voted to
opt out of provisions of the recently passed Massachusetts
interstate banking law that allows banks outside of New
England to acquire or open banks in the state.
   The statute, signed into law in July, allows a
Massachusetts bank to opt out of the interstate banking
provisions until July 1, 1992, by a two-thirds vote of its
directors.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Prior to the passage of the law, only banks based in other
New England states have been able to enter the Massachusetts
market. Bank of Boston officials had lobbied against the
interstate banking bill and had previously indicated they
would opt out under the provisions until 1992.</p>
<p>In a statement, Bank of Boston said, "This decision is
consistent with the corporation's intention to remain an
independent institution and with its strategic objective to
build long-term stockholder value."</p>
<p>The company added that the "action wasn't taken in
response to any known proposal to acquire Bank of Boston
Corp."</p>
<p>The bank holding company's stock price has been depressed
recently because of poor results due to the slumping New
England economy and real estate market.</p>
<p>BayBanks Inc., another bank holding company buffeted by
New England's economic woes, chose to opt out of the the
provisions last month, but retained the right to "opt in"
before 1992 if it deems it "advisable."</p>
