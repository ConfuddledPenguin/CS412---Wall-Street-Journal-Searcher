	<p class="article-leader">Bruce L. Edwards, an associate professor at Bowling Green
State University, speaking to the Heritage Foundation last
spring:</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Since Rudolph Flesch published his book "Why Johnny Can't
Read" in 1955, we have heard a lot about Johnny. . . . Not
only can Johnny not read, he also can't write. Johnny can't
spell, can't do arithmetic, can't tell you when the Civil War
was fought, can't distinguish the words of Stalin from
Churchill, and can't identify Central America, or his own
state for that matter, on a map. There's one other thing
Johnny can't do. Johnny can't fail.</p>
<p>No matter how poorly Johnny has performed in school, our
benevolent, paternalistic educational system -- the perfect
analogue to our welfare system -- has by and large found a
way to promote Johnny to the next grade, found a way to keep
his self-esteem intact, lest he be disgruntled, discouraged,
or guilt-ridden.</p>
<p>Johnny's deficiencies as a student can always be explained
away by reference to personal circumstances: poor school
lunches, budget cuts, biased testing procedures, a broken
home, racial or gender discrimination. (Well, in Johnny's
case, probably not gender discrimination.) And besides, his
underdeveloped skills or languishing motivation can always be
remediated or accommodated next year, on the next rung, by
the next teacher, in the next school, perhaps by diverting
him to some subject matter or vocational interest more to his
liking or aptitude -- a scheme that may well postpone
recognition of his failure indefinitely, possibly all the way
up to and including graduate school.</p>
<p>For Johnny himself to fail -- as an individual and not
merely as a faceless, disadvantaged personification of some
larger subclass -- someone would have to be responsible. Some
parent, some teacher, some principal, some school board,
maybe even Johnny himself would have to become accountable
for that failure, would have to explain it to somebody; and
performance standards, objective criteria, would have to be
evoked to catalog the extent of the failure and the place to
begin to remediate Johnny.</p>
