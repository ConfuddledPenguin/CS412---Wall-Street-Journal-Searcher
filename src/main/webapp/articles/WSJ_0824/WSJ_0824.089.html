	<p class="article-leader">PHILADELPHIA -- Cedar Group Inc. expects to realize
marketing and management benefits "almost immediately" from
its acquisition of Gardenbolt International Corp., said
Lawrence Rutstein, chairman.
   Earlier this week, Cedar Group announced its agreement to
acquire Gardenbolt, a Sayerville, N.J., distributor of
imported fasteners, for $5.5 million. Gardenbolt had 1989
sales of about $26 million. The transaction is expected to be
completed next month.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Rutstein said Cedar Group believes the move will help
the company expand its market share significantly at a time
when the industrial-fasteners industry is consolidating and
sales growth is generally "stagnant or flat." In the U.S.,
industry sales of imported nuts, bolts and other fasteners
exceeded $1 billion in 1989.</p>
<p>"Gardenbolt is a major step for us," Mr. Rutstein said in
an interview. "It puts us into the top tier of distributors
in the country."</p>
<p>Cedar Group would also gain an experienced management team
"that can help us as we make additional acquisitions," Mr.
Rutstein said. Under terms of the agreement, Steven
Schonholtz, president and chief executive of Gardenbolt, will
become executive vice president and chief operating officer
of Cedar Group.</p>
<p>Mr. Rutstein said Gardenbolt, with more than 50 years of
experience in the fasteners industry, has "an excellent
reputation that can help us attract other companies to our
nest."</p>
<p>Moreover, the product-line mixes of the two companies
complement each other. Cedar Group, which anticipates sales
in the range of $18 million to $20 million in fiscal 1991
ending Jan. 31, concentrates on bulk marketing of internally
threaded products, such as nuts and washers.</p>
<p>In contrast, Gardenbolt handles a broad line of screws and
externally threaded bolts. It generally sells them in smaller
quantities at higher margins and to different categories of
customers. "We'll have a wider product line for a wider
customer base," Mr. Rutstein said. As another advantage, he
cited Cedar Group's ability to expand beyond its traditional
distribution centers in Philadlephia, Chicago and Houston by
tapping into the Gardenbolt network.</p>
<p>Mr. Rutstein declined to make any specific forecasts for
fiscal 1991 sales or earnings, but he indicated that
Gardenbolt would contribute immediately to profit.</p>
<p>Combined annualized sales would reach about $45 million,
he said. But depending on the timing of the transaction's
close, Gardenbolt may add sales of only about $10 million in
the current fiscal year.</p>
