	<p class="article-leader">If some environmentalists have their way, the decision to
have a tooth filled may soon require people to grapple with
decisions of a much larger order, such as their burial plans.
According to a recent report in Nature magazine, the
increasing use of cremation poses environmental problems
related to fillings.
   It seems the crematoria heat causes the dental amalgams to
release harmful mercury vapor in the air. Getting yourself
and your fillings buried in the ground, on the other hand,
would be relatively harmless, argues Dr. Allan Mills, the
author of this study. While investigators have been
preoccupied with the dangers that amalgam materials might
pose to patients, Dr. Mills notes, "none of the investigators
seems to have considered the nature of the final disposal of
the teeth and their owners."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>We'd bet that a whole lot of people haven't been thinking
much about this particular disposal problem, but concerned
environmentalists needn't worry. They can either opt for
burial in the ground or, if they insist on cremation, they
can consider Dr. Mills's suggestion that their filled teeth
be extracted and safely disposed of. How and when these
extractions are to take place, Dr. Mills does not say. Will
dentists be rushed to the deathbed to remove fillings, as
family members gather round for this final gesture toward the
environment? Will Medicare pick up the costs? These questions
have yet to be answered.</p>
