	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Shell Oil Co. said a fire at its Deer Park,
Texas, refinery injured two workers and closed a large
portion of the plant, causing already rising gasoline prices
to climb faster.
   With gasoline supplies tight and the market extremely edgy
because of the potential for war in the Middle East, any
supply disruption, even short term, can have impact. "It's
bad news," said Thomas Manning, a vice president at refining
consultants Purvin & Gertz Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, U.S. refiners have been producing gasoline,
heating oil and other petroleum products at full capacity, a
situation that has sparked a flurry of accidents and could
cause more. "The harder you run something, the more likely a
fire is," Mr. Manning said. "They seem to run in bunches."</p>
<p>Indeed, Crown Central Petroleum Corp. said a critical
portion of its Houston refinery developed a leak yesterday
and was shut down. The petroleum products markets are so on
edge that rumors flew among traders that other refineries
across the country had operating difficulties.</p>
<p>The Shell accident, at a 215,000 barrel-a-day capacity
refinery along the Houston Ship Channel, occurred in a large
distillation unit. A spokesman for the company, a unit of
Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said the fire started yesterday
morning, but he didn't know the cause. One Shell worker was
flown to a nearby hospital with first-degree and
second-degree burns, and another was treated at the plant,
the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The fire was burning as of yesterday afternoon, but Shell
expected that it would burn itself out by the end of the day,
the spokesman said. He said it was too early to assess how
long the distillation unit, which processes 165,000 barrels a
day of crude oil, would be out.</p>
<p>The distillation unit is the first stage in processing
crude oil before sending it to other parts of the refinery.
Analysts said Shell can probably continue to produce gasoline
for a short time without the unit by processing so-called
intermediates it has in storage through the rest of the
plant.</p>
<p>Shell has had a number of accidents and operating problems
in its refining system in the past few years. Last winter,
its plants had to shut down, triggered by an extraordinary
Gulf of Mexico freeze. And in May 1988, the company's Norco,
La., refinery exploded, killing seven workers and injuring
scores of others.</p>
