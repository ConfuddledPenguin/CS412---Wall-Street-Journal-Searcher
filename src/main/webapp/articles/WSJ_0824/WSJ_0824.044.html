	<p class="article-leader">TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Prosecutors lowered the boom on the Hung
Yuan Group, the underground investment house that at its peak
controlled billions of dollars and whose downfall wiped out
the savings of thousands of small investors in Taiwan.
   In the past two days, almost all top Hung Yuan officials
have been arrested on suspicion of violating the country's
banking law. In Taipei, the prosecutor's office confirmed the
arrest of eight officials, including the group's head, Shen
Changsheng. Three other officials were reported under arrest
in other cities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Taiwan's Bureau of Investigation said it had summoned 42
people for questioning and that its agents searched 33
offices and residences. But Taiwan newspapers reported that
several Hung Yuan officials couldn't be located, including Yu
Yungming, Hung Yuan's former president.</p>
<p>The government also froze what little remains of Hung
Yuan's assets, which officials and analysts say were amassed
primarily through a pyramid deposit-taking scheme that
offered very high returns, and through real estate
speculation and stock market manipulation. Late last year,
the Bureau of Investigation said it believed the group's
deposits totaled $6 billion. One Taiwan newspaper reported
that Mr. Shen had told investigators Hung Yuan owed $3.5
billion to depositors and still has about $1.1 billion in
assets.</p>
<p>But analysts said the assets are probably far less than
$1.1 billion -- and most of that is probably land holdings
that are losing value because of the severe downturn in the
local property market.</p>
<p>The government crackdown comes more than seven months
after Hung Yuan suspended all interest payments and
withdrawals. Hung Yuan's once-bustling head offices were
quiet, although several burly employees manned the reception
desk in case of trouble from angry depositors.</p>
<p>"Investors have to know that most of what they invested
won't be recovered," said Thomas Hwang, general manager of
the ROC Banking Institute.</p>
<p>Most significantly, the arrests passed without notice on
the Taiwan Stock Exchange, where Hung Yuan used to push
stocks up and down at will. In the past, the very rumor of a
government investigation of the group would send the market
plummeting. But on Thursday, all eyes were on the Middle East
and Tokyo, where the Nikkei Stock Average fell 5.8%. Taipei's
weighted price index ended the day down 173.34 points, or
4.9%, at 3333.46.</p>
<p>Hung Yuan and the 170 mostly short-lived imitators it
spawned were underground in name only. The group had a
flamboyant presence in the late 1980s, when the quest for
easy money and speculative investments became a way of life
for millions of people on Taiwan. Before its fall, Hung Yuan
had a 7,000-person sales force and 200,000 investors enticed
by annual interest rates of nearly 50%. The whole gray-market
investment industry is estimated to have attracted $8 billion
before it fell.</p>
<p>With the exception of some early investors who weren't
foolish enough to reinvest their profits in the group,
analysts say few people benefited from Hung Yuan's rise. That
includes the sales force, most of whom sank large sums in the
company.</p>
<p>Most investors didn't know that some of Hung Yuan's senior
officials had criminal records. Mr. Shen has been prosecuted
for robbery, fraud, possessing stolen goods, assault and
forging securities. Mr. Yu, his lieutenant, has been
prosecuted for fraud, forgery and violating
negotiable-instrument laws. According to police records, both
have spent time in jail. Still, Mr. Shen and Hung Yuan
inspired intense devotion from investors.</p>
<p>The beginning of the end came in July 1989, when the
government enacted a tough banking law that allows only
licensed banks to offer interest payments in return for
money. Most of the underground houses soon collapsed, but
Hung Yuan survived longer by suspending interest payments and
withdrawals.</p>
