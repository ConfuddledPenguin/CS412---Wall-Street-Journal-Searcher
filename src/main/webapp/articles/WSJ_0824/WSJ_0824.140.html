	<p class="article-leader">Sumitomo Metal Mining Co. of Japan revised its prediction
of sales for its first half ending Sept. 30 to 274 billion
yen ($1.88 billion) from 268 billion yen, encouraged by
rising nonferrous metal prices and strong demand for
construction materials in recent months.
   As a result, pretax profit in the first half is expected
to reach 14 billion yen, up from the initially predicted 11
billion yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sumitomo Metal Mining also said its pretax profit for the
fiscal year ending March 31 is expected to rise to 27.5
billion yen from the previously estimated 22 billion yen. A
year earlier, the company had pretax profit of 23.9 billion
yen.</p>
