   Come Bud and Miller</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>JAPANESE consumers -- lovers of foreign fashion and art --
are developing a taste for imported beer.</p>
<p>Budweiser is most popular, but marketers are quickly
expanding shelf space for brands such as Miller, Beck's Bier,
Mexico's Corona Extra and even fruity Belgian brews. Though
foreign brands still account for less than 2% of Japan's beer
market, the value of imports in the first four months of this
year reached 3.4 billion yen ($23 million), double the amount
during the same term last year.</p>
<p>"People want to drink different beer for different
occasions," says A. John Hamaguchi, a manager at Hiroya Co.,
which imports Corona beer. Imported beer, which well-traveled
Japanese have an ever-easier time recognizing, has the snob
appeal that Tokyo's chic bars like. Indeed, so many Japanese
are following the recent U.S. fad of downing Corona beer
flavored with fresh lime that Hiroya expects sales of the
brand in Japan to double this year to 400,000 cases.</p>
<p>A cut in the duty charged on foreign beverages and higher
domestic beer prices also are helping ale sales.</p>
<p>Japanese breweries that market or sometimes even produce
under license most foreign brands are trying to cash in on
the boom.</p>
<p>Suntory Ltd. now offers Big Bud bottles of about half a
quart for thirsty drinkers. Sapporo Breweries Ltd., which
distributes Miller beer in Japan, hopes to double sales this
year to 500,000 cases by appealing to faddish young Japanese.
Its TV ads try to convince consumers that it's "proper
manners to drink standing up" -- a practice long considered
impolite in Japan.</p>
<p>Car Showrooms Spread</p>
<p>Outside Auto Industry</p>
<p>SELLING AUTOS in Japan is becoming a hot marketing trick
for companies that aren't even in the business.</p>
<p>Department stores, railway companies and pasta makers,
among others, are opening showrooms in conjunction with Mazda
Motor Corp. At least 23 non-auto industry companies have
joined a new dealership network -- including car dealers and
firms in totally unrelated fields -- that Mazda has set up in
addition to its regular system. With 119 members, the network
has sold more than 27,500 cars since starting business last
September.</p>
<p>The dealer network, which also includes regular car
dealers, is called Eunos and is changing the way Japanese car
dealers do business. Dealerships, often affiliated with a
single auto maker, usually represented only its models. But
in the Eunos network, the seven models on sale include French
Citroens as well as Mazda's sporty 1.7 million-yen Miata
(called the Eunos Roadster in Japan).</p>
<p>Some Mazda dealers aren't smiling. A Eunos spokesman says
the new showrooms won't provide direct competition, because
the Eunos cars are different. But a Mazda dealer in the Tokyo
suburbs says he felt more pressure to sell his cars after the
Eunos showroom was built across the road.</p>
<p>Though salesmen have long visited prospective customers'
homes to chase business, Eunos dealers try to draw customers
into their fancy showrooms with big displays and racks of
fashionable driving outfits. "Young people nowadays already
know which models they want," says Yasuo Kimura, a Eunos
spokesman. "They want to look at the cars and sign the papers
in the stores."</p>
<p>Food-concern Showa Sangyo Co. last fall opened an auto
showroom near the entrance of a shopping center near Tokyo.
It plans to display gift packages of spaghetti next to the
racy autos.</p>
<p>Dental Hygiene Items</p>
<p>Take Bigger Sales Bite</p>
<p>FOR YEARS, Japanese have shown little interest in dental
care, and even considered crooked teeth cute. Suddenly,
though, the country is awash in dental and other personal
hygiene products.</p>
<p>Marketers are launching new mouthwashes, miniature dental
kits, tooth whiteners and even a 300-yen "bio etiquette
drink" called Smash. Its minty flavor and mushroom extract
supposedly purify the breath. Sales of dental-care products
may grow as much as 40% this year to five billion yen,
retailers say.</p>
<p>The products are especially popular among fastidious young
Japanese. They increasingly are buying up deodorants and
liquid soap, and spreading the concept of having a "morning
shampoo" -- instead of bathing the night before. Pfizer Inc.
of the U.S. promotes its liquid plaque remover as a way to
keep teeth white.</p>
<p>But the concept of spending money to keep the mouth clean
may take a while to spread to the older generation. "Japanese
still think of dental care as treatment, not prevention,"
says a spokesman for Warner Lambert's Japanese unit, which
holds 30% of Japan's mouthwash market with its Listerine
brand. It recently cut prices of its 350-milliliter bottles.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>HERE'S A U.S.-Soviet joint effort in the Japanese soft
drink market: Coca-Cola (Japan) Ltd., a wholly owned Coke
unit, is selling a carbonated honey drink using Soviet
fermenting technology. The 200-yen-a-bottle beverage, called
Kefran, is only marketed in Japan, targeting health-conscious
Japanese. . . . In the midst of Japan's worst labor crunch in
16 years, gas stations are offering workers designer-brand
uniforms. Idemitsu Kosan Co. chose Jun Ashida, who designed
clothes for Japan's royalty.</p>
