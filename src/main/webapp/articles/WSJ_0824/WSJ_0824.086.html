	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department said it called in
three major oil refiners and two independent gasoline
marketers for questioning about the big price jump since
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The department said it's looking for possible price-fixing
or other antitrust violations. James Rill, the department's
antitrust chief, declined to identify the five companies but
said more companies will be interviewed in the inquiry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We are getting cooperation from the oil companies," he
said at a news briefing yesterday, indicating that compliance
with the investigation has been voluntary.</p>
<p>Such confidential questioning is typical in the
preliminary stages of an antitrust investigation.</p>
<p>At this point, the inquiry is focusing on the entire U.S.
petroleum-products industry, rather than on particular
companies, Mr. Rill added.</p>
<p>Federal officials will decide within four weeks whether to
take the further step of making compulsory demands for
documents from target companies or convening a grand jury to
consider criminal charges, Mr. Rill said. A team of 10
Justice Department lawyers and economists are looking into
the possibility of collusion by major oil companies and
price-gouging by distributors and retailers, he said.</p>
<p>The American Automobile Association said its most recent
national survey found that the average price of gasoline at
the pump jumped 15% from Aug. 1, the day before the invasion,
to Aug. 20. The average pump price of unleaded regular
gasoline jumped to $1.237 from $1.075 over that period, the
AAA reported.</p>
<p>State attorneys general, as well as officials from the
Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Energy, are
working with the Justice Department. Scores of members of
Congress, as well as state officials, have criticized big oil
companies for recent increases in gasoline prices.</p>
<p>In a statement issued late yesterday, the American
Petroleum Institute defended the industry's pricing. Despite
the market turmoil since the Iraqi invasion, "members of the
petroleum industry have been trying to act with restraint and
responsibility," the trade group said. As evidence, it
asserted that the 16-cent-a-gallon increase in gasoline pump
prices since the invasion compares with a rise of about 25
cents a gallon for spot-market crude prices and 35 cents a
gallon for spot-market gasoline prices.</p>
<p>"In other words, the pump price for gasoline increased by
a considerably smaller amount than have the costs oil
companies must pay to replenish those supplies," the
statement said.</p>
