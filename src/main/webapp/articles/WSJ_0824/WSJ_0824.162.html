	<p class="article-leader">KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- This Southeast Asian nation will
retain its preferential trade status with the U.S., thanks in
part to a strong endorsement from the American Embassy here.
   The U.S. Trade Representative's office in Washington,
D.C., asserting that Malaysia is increasing its protection of
workers' rights, has rejected three petitions filed by U.S.
labor organizations seeking to rescind the country's trade
privileges under the Generalized System of Preferences.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The petitions pointed to alleged abuses of workers'
rights, especially within the foreign-dominated electronics
industry, as grounds for canceling the reduced-tariff and
duty-free benefits on certain Malaysian goods shipped to the
U.S.</p>
<p>The campaign to end Malaysia's special status had been
encouraged by the controversial behavior of a U.S.-owned
company in a recent labor dispute, the leaking of a number of
confidential memorandums implicating U.S. concerns in
concerted efforts to keep their Malaysian facilities
union-free, and Kuala Lumpur's former absolute ban on unions
in the electronics sector.</p>
<p>A U.S. trade official in Washington said the petitions --
submitted by the AFL-CIO, the privately funded International
Labor Rights Education and Research Fund and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers -- "were not
accepted because no substantial or new information was
provided to warrant further review."</p>
<p>The ruling doesn't come as a surprise. Trade and labor
analysts, including several who supported the petitions, had
said all along it was unlikely the U.S. would revoke the
preferential status of an ally and significant trading
partner. In 1989, about 8% of Malaysia's $12.65 billion
(US$4.69 billion) in exports to the U.S. came under the GSP,
while the U.S. shipped goods valued at M$10.3 billion to
Malaysia.</p>
<p>Also, a confidential assessment by the U.S. Embassy here
-- a copy of which was obtained from Washington -- disputed
allegations by the three American labor groups and backed
continued GSP benefits for Malaysia. Parties associated with
the trade action said that the embassy's favorable review was
a significant factor in persuading the trade office to reject
the petitions.</p>
<p>The embassy's assessment flatly rejected the views
contained in the petitions: "In our view, none of them
present any new, relevant issues for review. The Malaysian
government has continued to take steps to provide
internationally accepted worker rights to its citizens."</p>
<p>An announcement by the trade representative's office had
been expected more than a month ago. But the heavy caseload
of petitions, as well as the U.S. Labor Department's concerns
about alleged rights violations in Malaysia, delayed the
ruling, said labor analysts familiar with the proceedings.</p>
<p>One analyst said that "the guys from Labor were the only
ones that said you can't dismiss these {petitions} that
lightly. . . . They said this needs to be looked at
seriously."</p>
<p>Though the odds were slim and the potential economic
impact marginal, the possible loss by Malaysia of its GSP
status was seized upon by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad as
a rhetorical weapon against political and labor-union
opponents. Dr. Mahathir and his supporters in the last four
months repeatedly accused their adversaries of threatening
Malaysia's economy by colluding with the U.S. labor groups
that filed the petitions.</p>
<p>Malaysian labor and political-opposition leaders denied
urging American groups to file the petitions to pressure the
government into granting additional safeguards to workers and
removing constraints on union organizing. But their denials
were lost in a blizzard of critical reports churned out by
the Malaysian media, which are largely controlled by the
government and Dr. Mahathir's United Malays National
Organization.</p>
<p>"Mahathir turned GSP into an effective campaign issue,"
said a labor analyst, noting that a national election must be
held by October 1991 but is widely expected to take place
sooner. "And it's a tough issue for the labor leaders to
defuse because they have been pushing so hard on such things
as unionizing the electronics industry."</p>
<p>Malaysia thwarted an earlier petition, filed in 1988 by
the AFL-CIO, the giant U.S. labor federation, to revoke its
GSP benefits. Though the petition was accepted for further
review, the trade representative's office finally ruled in
April 1989 that Malaysia should retain its status, in part
because because the workers' rights that the nation upheld
were approaching international standards.</p>
<p>But U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills, in a letter
that same month to Malaysian Trade and Industry Minister
Rafidah Aziz, expressed concern that Malaysia "does not allow
full freedom for workers to associate and form the labor
organizations of their own choosing in certain export
industries, such as the electronics industry." She also noted
that a government-investment program restricts collective
bargaining issues between workers and foreign-backed
concerns.</p>
