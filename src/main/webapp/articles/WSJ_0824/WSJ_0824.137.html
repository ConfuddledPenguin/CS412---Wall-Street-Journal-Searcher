	<p class="article-leader">Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., Hong Kong, reported that
first-half profit after taxes climbed 16% to 1.12 billion
Hong Kong dollars (US$143.9 million) from HK$964 million a
year earlier, buoyed by the strength of its core businesses.
   The conglomerate, controlled by the local tycoon Li Ka
Shing, said per-share earnings also grew 16% to 37 cents from
32 cents. But profit after extraordinary items fell 56% to
HK$1.49 billion, or 49 Hong Kong cents a share, from HK$3.42
billion, or HK$1.13 a share. The company recorded a one-time
gain of HK$368 million from the sale of its engineering
units, which was dwarfed by the HK$2.45 billion gain a year
earlier from the sale of shipping terminal interests.
Operating profit grew 11% to HK$1.25 billion from HK$1.13
billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue rose slightly to HK$6.4 billion from HK$6.34
billion.</p>
<p>Mr. Li, Hutchison's chairman, praised the company's
performance and said profit before special items for the full
year should show an improvement, compared with the
year-earlier HK$3.03 billion.</p>
