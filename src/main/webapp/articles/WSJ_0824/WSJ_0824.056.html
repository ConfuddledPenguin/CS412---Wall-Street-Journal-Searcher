	<p class="article-leader">Like a growing number of employers, Cray Research Inc.
offers family leave for dads who want to take time off after
their new baby is born. So how many of Cray's 4,000 employees
have taken paternity leave since the firm adopted the policy
last year? No more than four.
   "The notion of taking six months off might be good for
your sanity, but it's absolutely fatal to your career," says
William Linder-Scholer, 45-year-old director of community
affairs at Cray, a supercomputer maker based in Minneapolis.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When his daughter, Laura, was born 18 months ago, Mr.
Linder-Scholer turned down a 10-week unpaid leave in favor of
a one-week vacation. "No CEO would ever speak out against
family leave. It's subtle, unspoken, never in print -- it's
just the way the game is played. If you're in an environment
where the nature of the business is chaotic, you just can't
afford to be gone if you want to be a player," he says.</p>
<p>More dads may be changing diapers than a decade ago, but
that doesn't mean they are taking time off from work to do
it, even when they can. Money is one reason. Most husbands
earn more than their wives, and they often can't afford even
a temporary loss of that paycheck. Stereotypes also play a
role -- many people believe child rearing is a woman's job.</p>
<p>But fear of career consequences is often the greatest
concern -- even though leave takers are usually guaranteed
the same job when they return. Peer pressure helps perpetuate
the belief that paternity leaves unfairly burden co-workers
with extra assignments. And many men hoping to move up in
management fear that a leave would hinder or eliminate their
chances. "Many men aren't convinced that they wouldn't be
penalized for that opportunity," says Gordon Collins, a
psychology professor at the College of Wooster in Ohio.</p>
<p>The failure of most fathers to take advantage of paternity
leave is ironic, given the heated debate over the issue.
Recently, President Bush was criticized by proponents of
leaves for vetoing a bill that would have guaranteed workers
up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for childbirth, adoption or
family illness. For his objection, Mr. Bush cited fierce
global economic competition.</p>
<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 18% of U.S.
employees at companies and organizations with 100 employees
or more were offered unpaid paternity leave in 1989 and
another 1% could take paid leave.</p>
<p>While no statistics are available, companies that offer
paternity leave say few men take it. At Campbell Soup Co.'s
headquarters in Camden, N.J., not a single employee has taken
paternity leave in the three years since the food company
began offering a three-month unpaid benefit. At Unum Corp., a
Portland, Maine, insurer, only one man has taken paternity
leave in the past five years (although the benefit has been
offered since 1978) -- while 250 women took maternity leave
in that time. Moreover, that one father's leave was only two
weeks long, although the insurance concern allows 12 weeks of
unpaid leave. Unum says about 25 men inquired about the leave
in those five years but decided against it upon learning it
is unpaid.</p>
<p>Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal in
New York, has offered a four-month unpaid paternity leave for
three years and recently extended it to six months. But it
said fewer than 10 men have taken the leave, while more than
200 women took a parental leave.</p>
<p>Dan Borgenheimer, 30, a senior process engineer at
Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Co., contends that paternity
leaves are "disruptive" to the workplace. "There's even some
resentment when women take off. We have to split their
workload among all the remaining people, and we're already
busy as it is," he says. Mr. Borgenheimer, who also insists
on using his vacation time when he is ill rather than taking
sick days, took off only one vacation day when his first
child, Sarah, was born four years ago.</p>
<p>Since Minnesota Mining, a St. Paul, Minn., maker of
adhesives and other products, began offering the benefit in
1986, more than 85 men have taken the two-month unpaid
parental leave, out of a domestic, male-dominated work force
of about 50,000. About 1,200 women took the leave in the same
period.</p>
<p>Minnesota Mining says its culture of flexibility may
account for the leave's unusual popularity. "We don't have a
real stringent system or yes-no policy on {time off}," says
Mary Auvin, a company spokeswoman. Instead, "we try to work
things out rather than lose somebody we've already trained."
She also attributed the number of men taking advantage of the
benefit to the state's 1987 parental-leave law, which
requires concerns to offer men and women six weeks of unpaid
leave.</p>
<p>For Michael Harens, a systems analyst at Prudential
Insurance Co. of America, paternity leave "wasn't even a
consideration" when his daughter, Jacqueline, was born 14
months ago -- even though Prudential offers a six-month
unpaid paternity leave. The Newark, N.J.-based company
couldn't say how many men have taken the leave since it was
first offered about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Harens, fearing snickers from the management,
encouraged his wife, Mary, a legal consultant, to take a
three-month leave instead. "I think it's still socially
unacceptable," says Mr. Harens, 31. "The stigma is still
there. It's not so much that a man couldn't handle it, but
that" society says a man shouldn't do it, he says. "I don't
think we even talked about him taking a leave. It was just
assumed that I would stay home," adds Mrs. Harens, 32. A man
staying home to change diapers instead of work is "sort of
looked down upon."</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, the psychologist from the College of Wooster,
explains, "We haven't escaped the notion that house-husbands
are, to a certain degree, wimpier than persons who are not."</p>
<p>Mr. Harens insists he is "leaps and bounds" more active in
the upbringing of his children than his father was. "My
father had seven children and never changed a diaper," he
says.</p>
<p>Some people question the idea of a man, who has been
through no physical hardship, staying home with a baby while
his wife, who has been through months of physical strain,
goes back to work. "It's a controversial issue but I say, why
does the man need time off? We recommend that the woman stay
home because her body needs to recover. There's really no
need for him to be there unless she's sick and needs help,"
says Pearline Gilpin, a nurse midwife and Lamaze class
instructor at Meharry Medical College's Hubbard Hospital in
Nashville, Tenn.</p>
<p>Indeed, Deidre Demorest, a part-time family counselor and
graduate student in Santa Clara, Calif., says she and her
husband, Michael Brown, would have "just gotten on each
others' nerves" had they both taken a leave. Ms. Demorest,
31, took 14 weeks off from work to recover from a Caesarean
section last January while Mr. Brown took one week of
vacation.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown, 35, a financial analyst at aerospace concern
Lockheed Corp., bypassed the option of a six-month unpaid
personal leave of absence because the couple couldn't afford
it, he isn't a "stay-at-home kind of person," and because
"he's not as into being with {Sean} as I am," explains Ms.
Demorest.</p>
<p>Money was the major factor when Patricio Rojas's baby,
Monica, was born nine months ago. Mr. Rojas took only a
one-week vacation to help his wife, Anne, recover. "I thought
long and hard about it and basically . . . we can't make it
on just {my wife's} salary," says Mr. Rojas, a senior
automated design engineer at Unisys Corp., a computer and
business systems concern. Unisys, based in Blue Bell, Pa.,
offers a nonpaid personal leave for employees that can be
used for paternity leave. Mr. Rojas says he wishes he could
have afforded a leave, because "my baby is more important
than my career."</p>
<p>Some couples compromise on paternity leave by having the
husband work at home while the wife recovers. Louis Hook,
director of finance for a division of the University of
California in Los Angeles, managed his 12 employees out of
his home last January while bathing, feeding and changing the
twin son, Randall or Carlton, "assigned" to him. Meanwhile,
Mrs. Hook recovered from her Caesarean and watched over the
other baby.</p>
<p>"I think {Louis} was excited about being home. He realized
that once he returned to work, he wouldn't have the
opportunity to spend that kind of time with them again,
except on the weekends," says Mrs. Hook.</p>
