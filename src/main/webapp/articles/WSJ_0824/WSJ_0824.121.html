	<p class="article-leader">BIG SPENDERS</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japanese corporate capital spending in the current fiscal
year will rise 16.1% from the previous fiscal year, according
to a report by Nippon Credit Bank.</p>
<p>The report, based on the bank's survey of 1,391 companies
conducted in July, represents a 5.1 percentage-point jump in
capital-spending plans from the previous survey conducted in
January.</p>
<p>"The January survey covers the fiscal year beginning in
April, when a lot of corporate-spending plans still haven't
been settled, so estimates are usually lower than the July
survey. But even so, the latest results show a healthy rise,"
said a bank official.</p>
<p>The expected 16.1% rise would constitute the third
straight year of double-digit growth, following increases of
10.9% and 15.6% in the previous two fiscal years, the
official said.</p>
<p>The report said the manufacturing sector's plans are
especially bullish, with outlays expected to be 21.8% higher
this year. Following increases of 25.4% and 24.6% in the past
two fiscal years, respectively, the report said the latest
rise would result in the first three-year stretch of more
than 20% growth since the bank began its surveys in 1975.</p>
<p>MORE TV FOR PORTUGAL</p>
<p>President Mario Soares ended Portugal's 26-year government
television monopoly by signing a law allowing two private
stations to run alongside the two existing state-run
channels. Competition for commercial-television rights is
expected to be intense. The legislation stipulates that at
least 10% of the programs on the new channels must be made in
Portugal and 50% must be in Portuguese. In addition,
advertising can't occupy more than 15% of air time, and
pornographic programs are banned.</p>
<p>DOWRY DEATHS</p>
<p>An average of more than 10 women a day died in India last
year because they didn't bring an adequate dowry to their
marriages, Home Minister Mufti Mohammed Sayeed told
Parliament. Dowry-related deaths totaled 4,006 in 1989,
nearly double the year-earlier toll. The official didn't say
how the brides had died, but there are frequent reports of
women being doused in kerosene and burned alive in what
families call kitchen accidents.</p>
<p>WOES FOR LEBANON</p>
<p>Lebanese bank and municipal employees started a strike for
higher wages. The action by employees at 118 private banks
and the central bank quickly caused a shortage of cash
throughout Lebanon. The strike by the municipal employees was
expected to cause health problems in Beirut and other cities.
The General Confederation of Labor Unions, which represents
an estimated 200,000 members, called for a demonstration in
Moslem West Beirut yesterday afternoon to protest soaring
prices and deteriorating living conditions.</p>
<p>TROPIC TOPIC</p>
<p>Disappearing mangroves have joined vanishing rain forests
as a cause for concern. Delegates from 20 Asia-Pacific
nations yesterday established the International Society for
Mangrove Ecosystems, to be based at Ryukyu University on
Okinawa. Many of the trees, which grow around estuaries in
tropical and subtropical regions, have been felled recently
to make way for factories and shrimp farms. Some experts said
Okinawa, for example, has lost 90% of its mangroves.</p>
<p>WIDENING GAP</p>
<p>The Philippines had a first-half trade deficit of $1.87
billion, widened from a $1.15 billion deficit a year earlier,
the Central Bank of the Philippines said. The latest period's
leading exports included semiconductor devices, coconut oil,
children's and infant's clothing, copper, and electrical and
electronic machinery and parts. Crude oil, electronic
components, fabrics and aircraft led imports.</p>
<p>FEUDING FARMERS</p>
<p>Feuds over scarce resources in China's vast interior have
made peasant farmers extra keen on having sons -- not so much
to work the fields as to fight other farmers.</p>
<p>The official Farmer's Daily said the trend was the latest
in a litany of woes, including corruption and resentment,
plaguing China's birth-control policy in the countryside.</p>
<p>"There are some peasants who scheme about raising the
balance of power against hostile other farmers by having more
sons," the newspaper commented. "They think that more men
mean more power."</p>
<p>It cited an example of one farmer whose son was carted off
to a labor camp for 12 years for beating up neighbors. "One
has gone," the farmer was quoted as saying. "I'll just rear
another."</p>
<p>The newspaper said such "faulty mentalities" stemmed from
increasing conflicts caused by the scarcity of oil,
fertilizer, electricity, medicine, plastic sheeting and other
basic items.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Prince Charles is to have a bone graft on his right arm,
Buckingham Palace said. The 41-year-old heir to the British
throne sustained a double fracture in a polo accident in June
and, although the top break has healed, the bottom fracture
hasn't. . . . New Zealand's Parliament passed sweeping
anti-smoking legislation that bans most tobacco advertising,
allows for fines of up to $31,000 and bars tobacco
sponsorship of sports.</p>
