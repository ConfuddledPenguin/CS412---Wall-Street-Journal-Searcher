	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- The Pension Commission of Ontario said it
charged four former officials of Enfield Corp. and its former
subsidiary, Federal Pioneer Ltd., with a breach of fiduciary
duties in administering the companies' pension funds.
   The individuals charged are Michael Blair, former
president of Enfield and Federal Pioneer; Jacques Lavergne,
Enfield's former chief financial officer; Donald Webster, a
former Enfield director; and Carole Penhale, Enfield's former
corporate investment manager.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The commission said the charges arose from the purchase in
August 1989 by the Enfield Master Trust pension fund of
nearly two million Enfield shares for 17.9 million Canadian
dollars (US$15.8 million), or 49.7% of the trust's estimated
C$36 million in total assets at the time.</p>
<p>The Master Trust was an umbrella fund covering various
participating pension plans within Enfield and Federal
Pioneer.</p>
<p>The commission alleged the share purchases violated
Ontario rules that prohibit more than 10% of a pension plan's
assets from being invested in the securities of any single
issuer. The commission said Mr. Blair also has been charged
with a conflict of interest. At the time of the share
purchases, Mr. Blair was vying for control of Enfield. Hees
International Bancorp Inc., Enfield's major shareholder, was
attempting to remove Mr. Blair from the Enfield board.</p>
<p>Mr. Blair said he hadn't yet seen the commission's
charges. He denied he had any knowledge of the share
purchase. The other defendants or their representatives
couldn't be reached for comment. A total of six charges have
been filed against each of the defendants, the commission
said. The maximum fine for each conviction is C$25,000.</p>
<p>Enfield is a holding company based in Toronto. Federal
Pioneer, an electrical equipment maker, has since been sold.</p>
