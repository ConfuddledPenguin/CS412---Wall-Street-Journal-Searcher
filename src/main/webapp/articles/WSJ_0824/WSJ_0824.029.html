	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The British government broke off talks with
Hanson PLC about the sale of state-owned PowerGen and said it
will sell the country's second-largest electricity generator
through a public offering instead.
   The government's abrupt flip-flop came one month after it
said it might shelve the long-planned flotation -- part of
the Thatcher government's #11 billion ($21.19 billion)
electric-utility privatization -- because of Hanson's "firm
interest" in bidding for PowerGen. Since then, Hanson
executives have pored over the PowerGen books while the
government has endured criticism that Hanson, a longtime
government contributor, was being given unfair advantage in
the sale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Energy Secretary John Wakeham indicated yesterday that the
government's decision to proceed with a sale to the public
was based on price. The Energy Department said Mr. Wakeham
concluded the terms of any sale to Hanson or another single
bidder "now offer insufficient benefit compared with
flotation," scheduled for next February. Analysts have said
the PowerGen sale could raise #1.1 billion or more.</p>
<p>The department's statement indicated the government relied
on new information from a recent PowerGen board report that
boosted profit projections. The board has been hostile to the
idea of a Hanson takeover.</p>
<p>Hanson declined to say what it had been prepared to pay or
whether it had submitted a formal bid.</p>
