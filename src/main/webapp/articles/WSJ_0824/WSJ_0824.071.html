	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Sales of domestic-built cars and trucks fell
4.7% in mid-August, a smaller drop than some experts had
expected, but a discouraging sign for auto makers
nonetheless.
   Growing concerns about economic uncertainty and increasing
tensions in the Persian Gulf have made already-cautious
consumers even more nervous, several dealers said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"We aren't seeing that impetuous-type buyer," said Tony
Tulino, general sales manager at Faulkner Oldsmobile in
Philadelphia. "Overall, our customers are concerned about
what's going on in the Middle East. We're seeing a careful,
scrutinizing buyer."</p>
<p>Makers of domestic vehicles sold 261,389 cars and trucks
in the Aug. 11-20 period compared with 274,320 vehicles a
year earlier.</p>
<p>The seasonally adjusted annual sales rate for the 10-day
period hit 7 million vehicles, according to a Commerce
Department formula. That rate is substantially lower than the
strong 8.4 million car-sales pace a year ago, but up from the
rate of 6.6 million cars in early August.</p>
<p>"Considering all the negatives out there -- stagnant
growth, declining employment, rising energy prices and
international tension -- I expected much worse," said Thomas
Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers
Association. Sales of trucks and of Japanese cars made in the
U.S. showed some strength, Mr. Webb said, but he predicted
that neither will escape the effects of a sluggish economy
and rising gasoline prices.</p>
<p>Chrysler Corp. posted the sharpest sales decline among the
Big Three auto makers, continuing a months-long pattern. The
company's domestic car sales skidded 27.3%, while its
domestic truck sales dropped 9.5%. The company's Jeep sales
have been badly hurt by Ford Motor Co.'s recent introduction
of its Explorer sport-utility vehicle.</p>
<p>Ford's domestic car sales fell 22.9%, but truck sales rose
19.3%, largely on the strength of the Explorer.</p>
<p>"Our truck sales are up 25% this month and that's boosted
mainly by the Explorer," said Lou Stanford, owner of Varsity
Ford in Ann Arbor, Mich. He said that "probably 10% to 20%"
of people trading in vehicles for the Ford Explorer are
trading in Jeep Wagoneers for the top-of-the-line Eddie Bauer
model.</p>
<p>General Motors Corp. fared the best among the Big Three,
again continuing a recent trend. Its domestic car sales fell
10.1%, while its truck sales edged up 1.3%. Sales in the
Oldsmobile division fell 26.7%; Buick sales dropped 25%.</p>
<p>To help spur sales of its Oldsmobile models, GM yesterday
added cash rebates ranging from $500 to $1,500 on select 1991
models, and doubled rebates on some 1990 models to a maximum
of $2,500. The program is an enhancement of an existing
incentive program than runs through Sept. 26, the company
said.</p>
<p>Mr. Tulino said Faulkner Oldsmobile had sold 753 new
Oldsmobiles in the first seven months of this year, down from
931 a year ago but is hopeful that the latest round of
rebates will boost sales. "When incentives go up, so do
sales, most of the time," he added.</p>
<p>The sales decline also touched Japanese auto maker Nissan
Motor Co. Its domestic truck sales fell 3.5% while its car
sales rose 3.9%</p>
<p>Toyota Motor Co. reported a 65.8% increase in sales of
U.S.-made cars, while Honda Motor Co. showed a 26.6%
improvement in its domestic car sales.</p>
