	<p class="article-leader">The first of two 747-200B jetliners built by Seattle-based
Boeing Co. to replace the aging Air Force One presidential
plane was delivered yesterday to Andrews Air Force Base, Md.
   The planes have taken five years to produce at a cost of
$262 million, and will replace the Boeing 707-320B used for
nearly 30 years. The aerospace concern said it hopes to
deliver the second, identical presidential transport before
year end.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Much larger than the old "Flying Oval Office" first used
by the late President John F. Kennedy, the new planes can
carry as many as 70 passengers and 23 crew members, require
35% shorter runways, have a range of more than 7,140 miles,
are equipped for air-to-air refueling, and have an enhanced
communications system for sending or receiving data through
normal or secured channels world-wide. They also have a
conference/dining room, quarters for the president and first
lady, an office area for senior staff, and another office
that can be converted into a medical facility.</p>
