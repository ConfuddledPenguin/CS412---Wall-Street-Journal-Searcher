	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Zapata Corp. said it plans a restructuring that
includes selling a 90% stake in its fleet of offshore
oil-drilling rigs, giving bank lenders 80% control of the
company, and making a cash tender offer for subordinated
debt.
   Zapata said that if bondholders don't accept the tender
offer, it will probably seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,
Zapata closed at $1.625 a share, down 25 cents.</p>
<p>Zapata said it expects to reach a final agreement "within
days" with a group of European investors for the sale of a
90% interest in its 12-rig fleet for about $280 million.
Zapata would retain the remaining 10% stake and receive
management fees for three years, as well as a share in any
profits the operations might generate.</p>
<p>Proceeds would be used mainly to repay $53.6 million of
debt on the rigs and to restructure the firm's senior bank
debt.</p>
<p>The company said that under an agreement in principle
reached with its banks, the restructuring will cut its $560
million of senior secured debt to $115 million. The banks
would get at least $160 million cash and 80% of Zapata's
common stock. Lenders currently own 30% of the company.</p>
<p>Zapata also must pay off $15 million in revolving credit
and pay fees related to the restructuring, as well as provide
funds for taxes and future working capital needs.</p>
<p>Remaining funds will go toward a tender offer for $78
million of subordinated debentures, on which $24 million in
accrued interest is owed. Zapata said if bondholders don't
accept the offer, "it is likely that the company will be
forced to file for protection under bankruptcy laws."</p>
<p>It said the cash offer will be made "within the next few
months and will reflect the deeply distressed nature" of the
bonds. The company said the bonds have recently traded at
between $350 and $480 for each $1,000 face value, including
accrued and unpaid interest.</p>
<p>Zapata hasn't had an operating profit since the first
quarter of fiscal 1985. It had a loss of $20 million, or 63
cents a share, in the latest third quarter ended June 30.</p>
<p>The new restructuring plan supersedes a 1987 plan that
assumed sufficient cash flow between then and the end of this
year to pay down both principal and interest on its debt.
"The first one was {drawn up} under the assumption that the
depression in the offshore industry would come to a close and
evidence that rig utilization would pick up," a spokesman
said.</p>
<p>Despite recent developments that have pushed oil prices
above $30 a barrel, Zapata said, "fundamentals of the market
for offshore drilling services remain unchanged." As a
result, "We don't have the cash flow to service the principal
and interest at the end of the year" as called for under the
previous plan.</p>
