	<p class="article-leader">Royal Nedlloyd Group N.V. reported a 76% plunge in its
first-half profit and said it wouldn't pay an interim
dividend.
   The transport giant, which is based in Rotterdam, the
Netherlands, said profit collapsed to 26.8 million guilders
($15.3 million), or 1.40 guilders (80 cents) a share, from
112.7 million guilders, or 6.47 guilders a share, a year
earlier. The latest half's net included 95.6 million guilders
of profit from sales of assets, including a tanker and
Japanese real estate. Without those asset sales, Nedlloyd
would have reported a substantial loss.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"These results are horrible," said Jan Stoop, a securities
salesman at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Nederland N.V. in
Amsterdam. "The outlook does not look particularly good." The
profit drop was bigger than most analysts expected, despite
Nedlloyd's warning this month that its performance was
deteriorating.</p>
<p>The results were announced after the close of trading on
the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, where Nedlloyd shares closed at
54.3 guilders, down from 56.5 guilders, in a generally weak
market.</p>
<p>Nedlloyd said it expects that its net for the full year
will be "considerably below" the 146 million guilders
forecast this year. For 1989, the company reported net of 252
million guilders, including about 106 million guilders of
exceptional items.</p>
