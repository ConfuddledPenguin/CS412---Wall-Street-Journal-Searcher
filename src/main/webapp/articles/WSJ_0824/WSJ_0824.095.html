	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- A handful of U.S. companies say they have
discovered a way to reduce the high costs of operating a
business in Japan without major sacrifices in management
control.
   The solution involves listing a Japanese subsidiary
publicly on the Tokyo stock market, and then selling off a
minority interest in the concern to Japanese investors. If
done skillfully, the strategy can take advantage of what's
left of the high prices on Japan's stock market and possibly
improve the subsidiary's recruiting and marketing
capabilities.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The most recent U.S. firm to try the strategy is Kentucky
Fried Chicken Co. On Tuesday, executives at Kentucky Fried
Chicken Japan, the fast-food chain's Japanese subsidiary,
served up two million shares on the second section of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange. While the market as a whole has been
down sharply in recent weeks, hungry Japanese investors
gobbled up the stock at the maximum value the Tokyo Stock
Exchange would allow.</p>
<p>The stock sale -- the largest initial public offering in
Japan so far this year -- netted the subsidiary a quick $109
million, according to executives at PepsiCo Inc., Kentucky
Fried Chicken's U.S. parent.</p>
<p>"Obviously, we're pleased" about investor response to the
offering, said Leonard Schutzman, a senior vice president and
treasurer at PepsiCo.</p>
<p>In attempting to raise money by taking its Japanese
subsidiary public, Kentucky Fried Chicken has followed in the
footsteps of a number of other firms, including Levi Strauss
& Co., Shaklee Corp., Avon Products Inc. and Hughes Aircraft
Co. The Japanese market's astronomical stock price-earnings
multiples -- still over 40 -- lend powerful appeal to the
idea of listing on the Tokyo exchange.</p>
<p>Mr. Schutzman says Kentucky Fried Chicken Japan plans to
use the new capital to expand in the Japanese market. With
282 wholly owned outlets and 646 franchises in Japan,
Kentucky Fried Chicken is already Japan's biggest foreign
fast-food chain. The company has ambitious goals; its
management says the Japanese market can sustain as many as
2,000 additional restaurants.</p>
<p>Prior to the public offering, PepsiCo and Mitsubishi Corp.
each held a 50% stake in Kentucky Fried Chicken Japan. Mr.
Schutzman credits executives at Mitsubishi and the fast-food
chain's subsidiary with recognizing the enormous potential to
raise money through the Japanese equity market. PepsiCo and
Mitsubishi have each retained a 34% share in the subsidiary.</p>
<p>Mr. Schutzman says the company considered abandoning the
strategy after the Tokyo stock market lost a third of its
value in the first quarter of this year and gave it another
close look when the market resumed its slide this month.</p>
<p>But even in the current bear market, the fast-food
franchise had no trouble moving its new stock. Kentucky Fried
Chicken Japan was auctioned off for 8,470 yen a share
($57.71). In the first day the shares were traded, the market
chased their price up nearly 30% to 11,000 yen at the
closing.</p>
<p>The bear market may actually have improved the climate for
initial public offerings for foreign companies in Japan.
Investors here have begun to shy away from big stocks in
favor of small new companies such as Kentucky Fried Chicken,
according to Yoko Kamiki, a trader at Daiwa Securities Co.</p>
<p>Not all attempts to raise capital through Japan's equity
market have proved successful, though. Offerings by Avon and
Shaklee, issued after the stock market drop in October 1987,
have foundered.</p>
<p>Officials at PepsiCo stress that the public offering was
not merely an attempt to milk the Japanese stock market.
"We're not planning to take the money and run," says Mr.
Schutzman. Rather, he says, the move is part of an effort to
improve the company's corporate image and to increase market
share.</p>
<p>Masanori Mochida, vice president of the Global Finance
Department at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp., which advised
PepsiCo in structuring the Kentucky Fried Chicken listing,
says that listing on the Japanese market can also help
foreign companies with their recruiting.</p>
<p>"Talented management prospects just out of college feel
more comfortable about a company if it's listed," he argues.
"They don't want to work for some firm they don't know
about." Mr. Mochida says that acceptance of a listing
application is interpreted as a sort of "seal of approval" by
a company's business allies as well.</p>
<p>Officials at Levi Strauss -- whose public offering in June
is considered a success by many analysts here -- say listing
in Japan has helped them from both a financial and a business
perspective. A company spokesman says Levi Strauss listed in
Japan "to demonstrate to employees our commitment to the
Japanese market." The offering also enabled the company to
construct a 46 billion yen distribution center, the spokesman
says.</p>
