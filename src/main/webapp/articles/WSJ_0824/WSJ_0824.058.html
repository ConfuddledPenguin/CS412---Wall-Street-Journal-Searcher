	<p class="article-leader">SYDNEY, Australia -- Media mogul Rupert Murdoch surprised
investors by substantially marking up the valuations on many
of his far-flung News Corp. assets and reporting a higher
annual operating profit than had been widely expected.
   News Corp. said it has revalued its publications and
television licenses upward by about three billion Australian
dollars (US$2.46 billion). That is three times bigger than
analysts had expected. And the company's debt-to-equity
ratio, although lower as a result, still suggests that debt
levels are even higher than some News Corp. watchers thought.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>News Corp. also announced that its operating profit after
tax but before extraordinary items fell by 43% to A$282.3
million, or A$1.02 a share, in the year ended June 30 from
A$496.5 million, or A$1.58 a share, a year earlier. Analysts'
estimates had ranged between A$215 million and A$250 million.</p>
<p>After extraordinary items, News Corp.'s profit fell 71% to
A$343.3 million, or A$1.21 a share, from A$1.16 billion, or
A$3.52 a share. The dividend is maintained at 10 Australian
cents a share.</p>
<p>Revenue rose 12% to A$8.76 billion from A$7.81 billion.</p>
<p>Asset revaluation is an exercise News Corp. undertakes
every three years. In previous years, the company has used it
as a tool to increase its borrowing power by boosting its
shareholders' equity. But Mr. Murdoch has said the debt-laden
company won't be pursuing its usual agressive acquisition
strategy, so News Corp. watchers were looking for the company
to use the latest revaluation more as a defensive tactic to
make its balance sheet look stronger.</p>
<p>Under Australian accounting rules, the company can
periodically write up the value of certain assets if News
Corp. directors think they are worth more than the purchase
price. But the company doesn't have to provide a breakdown of
what assets were written up -- or marked down. A News Corp.
official said in a telephone interview Thursday that "we
don't discuss which {assets} went up or down." He also
declined to disclose News Corp.'s current debt levels,
although those figures will be released when the company
publishes its annual accounts next month.</p>
<p>The last time News Corp. revalued its assets was in 1987,
when it added about A$1 billion to its asset valuations.
According to the 1989 accounts, News Corp. valued its
publishing rights, titles and television licenses at A$8.85
billion. The latest increase, based on independent
valuations, will boost that figure by about a third.</p>
<p>The size of the latest write-up startled several analysts,
some of whom had expected soft advertising markets in the
U.S. and U.K. to force News Corp. to write down the values of
certain assets, thus limiting the overall mark-up.</p>
<p>George Batsakis, an analyst at Melbourne stockbrokerage
firm J.B Were & Son, said that while there appeared to be
much scope to revalue certain News Corp. assets, he "didn't
think it could be above A$2 billion."</p>
<p>Viktor Shvets, who tracks News Corp. in Sydney for Baring
Securities (Australia) Ltd., had expected a total asset
write-up of about A$1 billion. The huge revaluation is
"clearly positive" for the company because it improves its
debt-to-equity ratios, he said. But, "by the same token, it
highlights {the company's} debt levels," which apparently are
higher than some analysts had estimated.</p>
<p>Even after the sharp revaluation, News Corp.'s
debt-to-equity ratio is still 0.90-to-1. While that is well
below the 1.1-to-1 that News Corp.'s bank lenders stipulate
must exist every year on June 30 -- and below the 0.98-to-1
that the company reported for June 30, 1989 -- analysts said
it suggests that News Corp.'s debts have swelled.</p>
<p>According to analysts' estimates, the debt-to-equity ratio
News Corp. disclosed Thursday suggests the company is
calculating its equity at A$10.5 billion, including an
estimated A$1.3 billion in preference shares and A$1.2
billion in convertible notes that the company counts as
equity. Its debt, then, is about A$9.45 billion. That's about
$500 million more than Baring Securities had estimated. And
to put the debt figure into perspective, it is about as much
as Uruguay owes its international creditors.</p>
<p>News Corp. has been jettisoning assets to cut its debt
load, but the News Corp. official said the company plans "no
major asset sales" during the current fiscal year.</p>
<p>News Corp. said it ended fiscal 1990 with net tangible
asset backing of A$27.91 a share, including convertible notes
and U.K. special-dividend shares. That is up from A$15.20 a
share a year earlier. Yet, News Corp. shares are trading at a
substantial discount. They closed yesterday on Australian
stock exchanges at A$10.40 each, down from A$10.80 on
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Analysts also noted that the latest year's profits were
buoyed by certain accounting changes, including the way News
Corp. treated losses on Sky Television, its fledgling British
satellite-TV service.</p>
<p>A net extraordinary gain of A$61 million included profits
from the sale of the Star magazine in the U.S. and the
spinoff of 49% of the South China Morning Post in Hong Kong,
offset in part by a write-off of previously capitalized
development costs at Sky TV and a provision against
investments and obsolete equipment.</p>
<p>The profit drop was blamed on initial losses at Sky TV;
substantially lower earnings at Ansett Airlines, a 50%-owned
Australian domestic carrier, that suffered from an
industrywide pilots' strike, and increased interest costs.</p>
<p>News Corp. said it earned "a significant first-time
operating profit" at Fox Broadcasting Co., its U.S. national
programming service. Fox Broadcasting achieved a 27% increase
in its prime-time household ratings.</p>
<p>The Twentieth Century Fox Film division result declined,
though. "Fox Film has developed a strong schedule for the
1991 financial year and is encouraged by the initial
box-office acceptance of `Die Hard 2,' which has already
grossed in excess of U.S. $100 million," the company said.</p>
<p>TV Guide magazine "performed satisfactorily and its
results exceeded budget expectations," News Corp. said.</p>
<p>Operating profit at the company's British newspapers was
"slightly below" that of the previous fiscal year. Results
were affected by reduced advertising volumes and the entry of
new competitors.</p>
