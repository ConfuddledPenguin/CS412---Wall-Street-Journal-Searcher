   Isn't Harming Firm's Sales</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">Operation PUSH's call for a nationwide boycott of Nike
Inc. athletic shoes and other products apparently hasn't had
much impact so far.
   Several retailers who sell Nike items report that
consumers for the most part are ignoring the civil rights
group's boycott call. Many customers don't even seem aware of
it, they say.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Nike's stock has taken a pounding since the boycott was
announced, dropping $2 yesterday in over-the-counter trading
to close at $62. But analysts said the declines had more to
do with investor nervousness over the possibility of war in
the Middle East and fears that a recession is imminent.</p>
<p>Ray Cabillot, an analyst with Piper Jaffray & Hopwood,
said he hasn't altered his forecast that Nike will earn $7.25
a share on revenue of $2.7 billion for the year ending next
May. Last fiscal year, Nike earned $243 million, or $6.42 a
share, on revenue of $2.2 billion.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the athletic apparel maker said sales in
Chicago, where Operation PUSH is based, have increased since
the boycott call.</p>
<p>PUSH called for the boycott because it says Nike gets
about 30% of its more than $2 billion in annual revenue from
black customers but invests little in black communities. Last
week, Nike announced a series of affirmative-action programs
that PUSH officials then denounced as inadequate.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for PUSH said its boycott is working and
that the impact on sales probably won't show up until Nike's
next quarter.</p>
