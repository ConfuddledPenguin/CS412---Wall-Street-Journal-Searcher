	<p class="article-leader">ANN ARBOR, Mich. -- Gelman Sciences Inc. said it
anticipates that it will report a loss of approximately $1.5
million for its fiscal year ended July 31.
   The health-devices company had net income of $2.1 million,
or 98 cents a share, on sales of $71.1 million, for its
fiscal year ended in 1989. Net sales for 1990 were
approximately $73 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Gelman said financial results for fiscal 1990 were hurt by
lower-than-planned sales, poor performance of the company's
Australian subsidiary, and higher-than-anticipated expenses
in Gelman Sciences Sunbeam Process operations and year-end
adjustments.</p>
<p>The company expects to release year-end results in late
September.</p>
