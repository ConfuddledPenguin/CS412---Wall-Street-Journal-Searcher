	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Let's assume the nightmare comes true: Iraq
attacks U.S. troops or Saudi cities with chemical weapons as
part of a major war. Should the U.S. fight back with chemical
or even nuclear weapons?
   A number of military analysts say the answer is no. Even
though chemical or nuclear weapons promise a quick victory in
battle -- and an emotionally satisfying response to a
barbarous attack -- the political fallout from using these
weapons would be disastrous to U.S. interests. Moreover, the
analysts say, the U.S. has more than enough aircraft and
missiles to destroy Iraqi targets using conventional bombs in
a war. Nuclear and chemical weapons don't add that much
militarily.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It's a losing proposition," says retired Maj. Gen. Elmer
Pendleton, who was the Pentagon's senior officer in Turkey.
"With our massive air ability, we can do the job as well"
without nuclear or chemical weapons.</p>
<p>Using even small battlefield nuclear weapons would be a
"disastrous mistake," adds Gary Milhollin, an arms control
expert at the University of Wisconsin Law School. "It would
be a signal to all the countries in the Third World that to
stand up to the First World they need nuclear weapons."</p>
<p>One reason that the U.S. can contemplate more seriously
using chemical or nuclear weapons is the easing of relations
with the Soviet Union, says retired Adm. Thomas Moorer, a
former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The two
superpowers aren't backing different sides in this conflict,
so the U.S. can worry far less about retaliation from the
Soviet Union.</p>
<p>"With them {the Soviet Union} out of the picture, it has a
significant impact on the flexibility available to the
president," Adm. Moorer says. During this crisis, for
instance, the U.S. has been able to empty the Mediterranean
of aircraft carriers because of the diminished Soviet threat
in Europe.</p>
<p>Last October, about 20 military planners sat down for a
war game to plot U.S. responses to a chemical attack by a
country in the Middle East, says Francis West, president of
Gama Corp., a Falls Church, Va., consulting firm that stages
war games for the Defense Department. They quickly realized,
says Mr. West, that the U.S. didn't need to resort to
chemical weapons to deal a devastating blow to the attacker.
That's a calculation the Iraqis can make as well, Mr. West
says, and one that might disincline them from attacking.</p>
<p>"It's hard to see any initiation of chemical weapons by
Iraq where it doesn't come out much worse for them" if the
U.S. uses only conventional weapons, he says. "That's the
essence of deterrence."</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. is likely to reject out of hand a
strategy of terror involving bombing a city in Iraq with
chemical or nuclear weapons in retaliation for a chemical
attack on a Saudi city. "The last thing I'd do is say that
because {Saddam Hussein} attacks a population, I'd attack a
population," says Albert Wohlstetter, a nuclear strategist
who has greatly influenced Pentagon thinking. "It's like
saying that if a terrorist kills your child, you kill his."</p>
<p>And using chemical or nuclear weapons effectively in a
battle is very difficult. A change in wind could spread
killer microbes launched against Iraqi soldiers over
civilians or U.S. soldiers instead. The potency of chemical
agents also dissipates over time, making the weapons
relatively ineffective against such targets as airfields or
Iraqi chemical and nuclear research facilities.</p>
<p>Nuclear weapons, on the other hand, are so destructive
that they can't be used anywhere near U.S. troops or
civilians -- essentially ruling out their use in a battle to
retake Kuwait. Even the smallest nuclear weapons, fired by
Howitzers, can kill anything in an area nearly one-half mile
across.</p>
<p>Any use of chemical or nuclear weapons by the U.S., even
in retaliation, also would produce heavy political damage.
International support, so critical for the economic blockage
against Iraq, would wither, say analysts, and opposition
would mushroom at home. "If we retaliate with chemical
weapons, we're getting into the mud with the pigs," says
Lawrence Korb, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
"We can accomplish our objectives with conventional weapons."</p>
<p>For all the incentives against the use of these weapons by
the U.S., Iraq can hardly rest easy that the U.S. will
forswear them. It's impossible to gauge the effect of cries
for revenge on policy makers if U.S. soldiers are gassed,
with grisly pictures of their remains broadcast to this
country. "When survivability {of U.S. troops} hits the mind
of the American people, we're capable of doing anything
{Saddam Hussein} can dream up," says Adm. Moorer.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Wohlstetter, the defense strategist,
recommends retaliating to a chemical attack by launching a
chemical attack against encampments of Iraqi soldiers -- even
though he recognizes the political risks. A U.S. chemical
attack would force Iraqi soldiers in future battles to don
protective gear, which can reduce their effectiveness by a
factor of six, he calculates. And it would also deter a
second chemical attack by Iraq.</p>
<p>"Hitler didn't use gas," Mr. Wohlstetter says, "because he
didn't think there would be a net gain from using them."</p>
