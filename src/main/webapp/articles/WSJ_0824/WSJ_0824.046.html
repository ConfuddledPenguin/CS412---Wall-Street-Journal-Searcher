	<p class="article-leader">Federal courts may soon follow most state courts in
opening their doors to the scrutiny of television viewers.
   A committee of federal judges has issued a report
recommending that cameras be allowed in federal courtrooms on
an experimental basis. The plan, which requires the approval
of the U.S. Judicial Conference, would allow cameras into
civil proceedings in six district courts and two appeals
courts for three years. The courts would participate on a
volunteer basis beginning July 1, 1991.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Timothy Dyk, a Washington attorney who represents a
coalition of news organizations including the National
Association of Broadcasters, C-Span and several newspapers,
has been trying to persuade the U.S. Judicial Conference to
permit cameras and other broadcast equipment into federal
courtrooms for nearly seven years. The Conference is headed
by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and sets rules for all
nonmilitary federal courts except the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The Judicial Conference will decide whether to authorize
the plan at its September session. Advocates believe that the
experiment has a good chance of getting approval. In a May 7,
1990, letter to U.S. Rep. Robert W. Kastenmeier, a proponent
of cameras in the courts, Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, "I
am by no means averse to the idea of the sort of experiment
with television and radio coverage in federal courts which
you describe."</p>
<p>Proponents of cameras in the courts have long argued that
the benefits include public education and the incentive for
courts under the watchful eye of the public to work more
efficiently. They say that modern cameras and
state-of-the-art lighting and sound equipment permits
broadcasters to work without being intrusive.</p>
<p>"The benefit is that it takes the mystique and elitism out
of the law and puts the law on a level of everyman," said
James Goodale, a New York attorney and media specialist.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Dyk, 45 states allow cameras in their
courts. "The federal courts are about to enter the electronic
age," he said. "What having cameras means in part is that the
public will have greater confidence in the judicial system by
seeing how it works."</p>
<p>Opponents fear that lights, cameras and microphones might
disrupt courtroom proceedings. They also worry that the
broadcast media might misinterpret or trivialize legal issues
and that jurors and witnesses might alter their performance
if they are televised.</p>
<p>The committee that proposed the plan, the Ad Hoc Committee
on Cameras in the Courtroom, recommended against opening the
courts to cameras last fall. The committee's chairman, U.S.
District Judge Robert Peckham, of San Francisco, couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>Two people familiar with the decision said that lobbying
efforts by Steven Brill, president of the American Lawyer
Media Limited Partnership, in which Time Warner Inc. is a
limited partner, may have influenced the committee to change
its position. Mr. Brill is planning to launch a 24-hour cable
channel primarily devoted to live trial coverage.</p>
<p>"The argument is basic," said Mr. Brill. "If there's one
branch of government that is meant to be public, it's the
courts. . . . The strength of a democracy is based on people
knowing what's going on."</p>

<p>FEDERAL APPEALS COURT rules lender is not liable for waste
cleanup.</p>
<p>The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Portland, Ore.,
ruled that the Port of St. Helens, a municipal corporation
that issues revenue bonds to promote industrial development
in St. Helens, Ore., is not liable for the cleanup of
hazardous waste on property that it owns.</p>
<p>The decision marks the second time that a federal appeals
court has ruled on the scope of an exemption in the federal
Superfund law that shields lenders from liability when they
have a security interest in a company but don't participate
in its management. Under Superfund, those who own or operate
contaminated sites are responsible for cleaning them up.</p>
<p>In the decision, the appeals panel ruled that the port did
not have to pay the cleanup bill because it had not exercised
any management authority at the site.</p>
<p>Environmental lawyers said the decision is significant
because it appears to conflict with a May ruling by a federal
appeals court and could set the stage for a challenge in the
U.S. Supreme Court. An Atlanta court found lenders do not
have to be involved in the day-to-day operations of a
facility to incur liability.</p>
<p>In the current case, the port issued bonds in 1981 to
Bergsoe Metals Corp. of St. Helens to finance the
construction of a recycling plant. The port holds the title
to the property.</p>
<p>In 1986, Bergsoe was put into involuntary bankruptcy
proceedings. By that time, state environmental authorities
had determined that the plant was contaminated with hazardous
waste.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy trustee sued East Asiatic Ltd. of New York
and East Asiatic Inc. of Copenhagen, former shareholders of
the company, seeking to hold the companies liable for the
cleanup. (That case is still pending.) Those companies then
sued the port, alleging that the port is liable for the
cleanup costs.</p>
<p>In a key finding, the appeals panel rejected the
plaintiffs' argument that the port is not covered by the
exemption because it negotiated the building of the plant and
maintained the right to inspect the site.</p>
<p>The court wrote that "merely having the power to get
involved in management, but failing to exercise it, is not
enough" to incur liability under Superfund.</p>
<p>"The opinion should comfort lenders because it
distinguishes between the power to manage and the actual
management of a borrower's operation," said Lawrence P.
Schnapf of the New York firm Lord Day & Lord, Barrett Smith,
an environmental lawyer not involved in the case.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Conklyn, of the Seattle firm Bogle & Gates, a
lawyer for the plaintiffs, said that her clients had not
decided whether to appeal. "It is our position that the port
took sufficient action to indicate it might be liable," Ms.
Conklyn said.</p>
<p>A lawyer for the port couldn't be reached for comment.</p>

<p>APPEALS COURT WIPES OUT $26.6 million award to Eli Lilly.</p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated
a lower court's finding that Medtronic Inc. infringed on an
Eli Lilly & Co. patent, and dismissed a related 1988 $26.6
million damage award.</p>
<p>The ruling was expected because the U.S. Supreme Court in
June found in favor of Medtronic's central argument in the
case, and sent the matter back to the court of appeals.</p>
<p>Lilly had sued Medtronic for infringement of a patent on a
heart pacemaker. Medtronic, a maker of biomedical devices,
claimed that a 1984 amendment to a federal law -- which
permits companies to produce drugs patented by other
companies if the manufacture is intended solely for the
gathering of data for an application to the Food and Drug
Administration -- also applied to its heart device. The heart
device also requires FDA approval.</p>
<p>A federal district court in Philadelphia ruled that the
amendment applied only to drugs, and a jury awarded the $26.6
million to Lilly in 1988. But the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled
in March 1989 that the law wasn't restricted to drugs.</p>
<p>In June, the U.S. Supreme Court also found that Medtronic
was protected by the law's exception to patent infringement
claims. Lilly's patent on the device expires in October.</p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals' ruling also erases
contempt-of-court citations issued against Medtronic by the
federal court in Philadelphia, as well as certain injunctions
that had remained in place.</p>
<p>Medtronic said the lower court's earlier contempt finding
had "held chilling implications for medical research
activities and onerous overtones limiting First Amendment
protection for scientific dialogue." The company said that it
is "extremely pleased that the company's position has been
vindicated after seven years of intense litigation."</p>
<p>The appeals court remanded the case to the lower court for
final action. A Lilly spokesman said: "We are disappointed
with the court's decision." He added, "Since this is ongoing
litigation, we would prefer not to comment further."</p>

<p>AT&T IS SUED for not paying benefit to deceased employee's
unmarried partner.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan, is believed to be the
first federal case over "domestic partnership" benefits. It
claims that American Telephone & Telegraph Co. discriminated
against the partner of a deceased lesbian employee by not
paying her a sickness-death benefit that is routinely given
to surviving family members.</p>
<p>In the suit, Sandra Rovira of New Rochelle, N.Y., alleged
that by not paying the benefit, AT&T violated city and state
discrimination laws -- as well as its own personnel policy,
which bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
or marital status. The suit claims that AT&T also violated
federal labor law by not following its personnel policy. The
policy says the company will not discriminate in providing
the benefit, according to the suit.</p>
<p>A spokesman for AT&T said, "AT&T doesn't discriminate on
any basis, including sexual preference." He said the
company's benefits committee rejected Ms. Rovira's benefit
claim on the basis of "state law regarding the legal status
of the relationship."</p>
<p>Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, a gay-rights
group representing Ms. Rovira, said that AT&T's
sickness-death benefit usually equals one year of the
deceased employee's salary. The suit asked the court to order
AT&T to pay the benefit, estimated at $58,000, plus damages
of $75,000 for the alleged discrimination.</p>
<p>Ms. Rovira's companion, Marjorie Forlini, an AT&T sales
manager, worked at the company for 18 years until she died of
cancer in 1988. She and Ms. Rovira lived together for 12
years and considered themselves a married couple, the suit
argues.</p>
<p>Ms. Forlini helped raise and support Ms. Rovira's two
sons, who also were denied the benefit, according to the
suit.</p>

<p>THRIVING IN THE U.S.S.R.: Philadelphia firm lines up
Soviet business.</p>
<p>Schnader, Harrison, Segal & Lewis has been retained by a
number of Soviet government and private entities to appraise
business offers and look into trade options. Among its
clients are the Russian republic of the Soviet Union, the
city of Leningrad and a major Soviet magazine, Literaturnaya
Gazeta.</p>
<p>Jerome Shestack, the senior partner who conducted the
negotiations, said the Russian republic and the city of
Leningrad have taken the lead in encouraging entrepreneurial
efforts in the Soviet Union. "They are more receptive to
free-enterprise types of solutions than the central
government at this point," said Mr. Shestack, formerly the
U.S. representative to the United Nations Commission on Human
Rights.</p>
<p>Mr. Shestack said much of the firm's work will involve
evaluating offers the Soviets have received from American
businesses. The Soviets also are seeking advice on their own
trade and financial proposals, Mr. Shestack said, such as a
possible employee stock-ownership plan for Literaturnaya
Gazeta and a Leningrad joint venture with a U.S. department
store.</p>
<p>The law firm also is working in the U.S. to help fund the
restoration of buildings in Leningrad.</p>

<p>GULF CRISIS spurs Houston law firm to offer free phone
service.</p>
<p>Butler & Binion said it will provide free phone
connections to Washington for Texans seeking information
about relatives in Kuwait and Iraq.</p>
<p>The firm's philanthropy was inspired by "reports of people
who were running up $600 phone bills calling numbers in
Washington trying to get information," the firm said.</p>
<p>Associate Stephanie Harrison, acting as a spokeswoman for
the law firm, said the service will utilize Butler & Binion's
tie lines connecting its Texas offices to its Washington
office.</p>
<p>Texans can dial an 800 number and have a Butler & Binion
operator connect them to a dial tone in Washington.</p>
<p>"Service will continue until the State Department
inaugurates its own 800 service or until the crisis is over,"
the law firm said.</p>
