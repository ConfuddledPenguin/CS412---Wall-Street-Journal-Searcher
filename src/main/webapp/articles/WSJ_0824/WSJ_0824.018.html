	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- New orders for durable goods in July
rebounded from a big decline the prior month, but demand for
the big-ticket items has barely grown over the past year, the
Commerce Department reported.
   U.S. factories received $128.3 billion of orders for
durable goods last month, a 2.9% increase from June, when
orders fell 3.2%, the department said. Most major categories
-- primary metals, machinery, transportation equipment and
capital goods -- increased in July after declining the month
before. Orders for transportation equipment, particularly
aircraft, showed the strongest gains last month, jumping 5%
after tumbling 6.3% in June.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Durable goods, generally defined as products expected to
last at least three years, range from cars and home
appliances to computers, factory equipment and sheet metal.
Economists consider demand for such items a good barometer of
the economy's health.</p>
<p>Although analysts were pleased by the across-the-board
improvements in durable-goods bookings last month, most found
little evidence that manufacturing is rebounding from its
stagnation of the past year. At the end of July, orders stood
only 1.5% above their monthly total a year earlier, according
to the report. Since the beginning of this year, orders have
fallen in three months and risen in four, leaving the overall
total practically flat since January.</p>
<p>"The individual components in July are generally
encouraging, but this report is generally quite volatile so
you should discount the strength," said Alan Gayle, chief
economist at Crestar Financial Corp. in Richmond, Va.</p>
<p>Moreover, economists were reluctant to place too much
significance on the July figures, given the new uncertainty
in the economy after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, sending oil
prices spiraling.</p>
<p>"These decisions were made to place orders well in advance
of developments in the Middle East," said Nicholas Perna,
chief economist at Shawmut National Corp. in Boston. "That
means the numbers are essentially borderline irrelevant."</p>
<p>He continued: "The real question is what are orders going
to look like if people become convinced that oil is at $30 a
barrel and rising, and the threat of recession is becoming
precipitous."</p>
<p>Defense capital goods was the only category to show a
decline in orders last month, posting a 3.1% decline on top
of a 21.9% plunge in June. Non-defense capital goods orders,
a good indicator of business investment plans, grew 10.7%,
but economists worried that companies' jitters over the
economy in light of the Middle East crisis will lead them to
scale back capital-spending plans.</p>
<p>Orders for primary metals grew 1.5%, orders for
nonelectrical machinery -- a category that includes computers
-- rose 2.7%. Electrical machinery orders increased 1.9%.</p>
<p>Unfilled orders grew 0.7% but shipments fell 2%.</p>
<p>All the numbers were adjusted for normal seasonal
variations.</p>
