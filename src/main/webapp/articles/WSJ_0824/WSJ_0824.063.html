	<p class="article-leader">A Colorado scientist may have found the secret of long
life, a gene that appears to control aging.
   Unfortunately, the secret was unearthed in a tiny worm.
But, the scientist suggested, his experiments indicate that
it may be possible someday to modify the aging process in
other creatures, possibly including humans.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The experiment "says we're not stuck with it {aging} as it
is; it is a biological process that we can do something
about," said Thomas E. Johnson, a molecular geneticist with
the Institute for Behavioral Genetics at the University of
Colorado in Boulder.</p>
<p>In this week's issue of Science, Mr. Johnson reports that
he succeeded in mutating a single gene and thereby doubling
the maximum life span of a group of standard laboratory
worms, creating what might be called the Methuselahs of the
annelid world.</p>
<p>The initial experiment actually was carried out four years
ago, Mr. Johnson said in a telephone interview. But, he said,
he was so startled that a single gene mutation could have
such a dramatic affect on the worms' life span that he waited
until he could replicate the experiment before publishing his
finding. "We've now replicated it more than 200 times," he
said.</p>
<p>The experiments were part of a broader study of the
genetic underpinnings of aging. The focus was on the maximum
life of the creatures if biological aging were the only cause
of death. This theoretical maximum life span is a calculation
based on the obvious fact that the older a group of creatures
grows the higher the death rate. The maximum life span is
calculated by a formula, known as the Gompertz equation, in
which one starts with the death rate of a species at puberty
and then determines how often the death rate doubles as the
creatures age.</p>
<p>For humans, for example, the death rate at puberty is
about two deaths per 10,000 persons per year. This rate
doubles every 7.5 to eight years thereafter. The Gompertz
equation says that at this rate, 100% of the group will be
dead in about 110 years. Hence, the maximum life span of
humans is about 110 years.</p>
<p>The Colorado experiments were done in a roundworm known as
Caenorhabditis elegans. It is found in the soil, is less than
0.04 of an inch long and is composed of less than 1,000
cells, Mr. Johnson said.</p>
<p>A few years ago, researchers found that mutations of a
single gene increased the maximum life span of the worms by
60% to 110%. Mr. Johnson claims to be close to locating the
gene, which has been dubbed the age-1 gene. In the newly
reported experiments, the aging of one strain of worms with a
mutant age-1 gene was slowed to the point that the death rate
doubled as infrequently as each 7.3 days instead of each 3.5
to 4.5 days for normal worms used in the experiments. As a
result, the maximum life span of the mutant strain rose to
about 37 days from 21 to 23 days in the normal strains. In
another mutant strain, the maximum life span was more than
doubled to 57 days by a mutation of the age-1 gene.</p>
