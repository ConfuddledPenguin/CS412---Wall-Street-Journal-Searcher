	<p class="article-leader">The Securities and Exchange Commission said it filed
motions for judgment of civil contempt against Robert J.
Palle Jr., the former president of Texscan Corp., and James
A. Luksch, a former Texscan vice president, for failure to
pay fines associated with their 1989 settlement of insider
trading charges.
   In 1987, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged
Texscan and six of its former officials with insider trading
in connection with the sale of 40,200 Texscan shares ahead of
negative news about the company's financial health. The civil
suit, filed in federal court in Phoenix, Ariz., alleged that
the defendants materially overstated the company's financial
results for its fiscal years ending April 30, 1984 and 1985,
and that certain officers used nearly $750,000 in advances
from the company for their personal use.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Texscan, which in 1987 was a Scottsdale, Ariz., maker of
cable television equipment operating under the protection of
the federal Bankruptcy Code, has since moved to El Paso,
Texas.</p>
<p>Mr. Palle, who hasn't paid $12,416 owed, and Mr. Luksch,
who has failed to pay $14,287, were ordered to pay the
amounts by last year, the SEC said. Messrs. Palle and Luksch
couldn't be reached to comment.</p>
