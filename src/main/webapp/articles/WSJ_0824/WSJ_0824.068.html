	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Daiwa Securities Co. and Nikko Securities Co.
have applied to Swiss authorities for banking licenses,
officials at the two major Japanese brokerage firms said.
   The licenses would allow the firms to expand the scope of
their operations in Switzerland and compete on a more equal
footing. "It's essential to our business," a Daiwa executive
said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While both companies operate subsidiaries in Switzerland,
their chief Japanese rivals, Nomura Securities Co. and
Yamaichi Securities Co., have had licenses to offer banking
services since 1988.</p>
<p>Officials at Daiwa and Nikko said they didn't know when
Swiss authorities would reply to the applications.</p>
