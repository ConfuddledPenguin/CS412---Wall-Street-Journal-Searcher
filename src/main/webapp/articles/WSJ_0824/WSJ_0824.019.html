	<p class="article-leader">SURGUT, U.S.S.R. -- Sergei Telkov and Alexei Suchkov are
27-year-old masters of the art of survival here in deepest
Siberia.
   They wear Italian clothes with designer labels, watch
American pop-music videos on their Japanese television sets
and drive around the potholed streets of Surgut in gleaming
new cars. They work off their stress at a gym in the morning
before heading to the office. Back home in the evening, they
sit around munching American chicken legs, wondering how to
spend all the cash they earn.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"How much does a big Mercedes cost in the West?" Mr.
Telkov asks over dinner one day, lighting up an American
cigarette and pouring his wife another glass of Bulgarian
Riesling.</p>
<p>Yuppies have made it to Siberia. It has taken hard work
and a lot of hassle, but Messrs. Telkov and Suchkov are among
the first of a new generation of upwardly mobile
professionals to take root amid the taiga and tundra. Like
their counterparts in Manhattan or London, they are deeply
conscious of money and status. They spend hours hunting for
goods with the right labels. They even fret about taxes and
real estate.</p>
<p>In a place better known for its freezing winters and
Stalin-era prison camps, however, it comes as little surprise
that the Siberian breed has some distinct peculiarities. They
have to make do with a bright yellow soda called Tarkhyn,
which tastes like mouthwash, because Perrier hasn't made it
out here. Even the best restaurants offer only greasy potato
soup as their special, and meat is hard to find -- let alone
cellular telephones or laptop computers.</p>
<p>Their biggest struggle, though, is trying to have a bit of
class in a society that long claimed to be classless.</p>
<p>They support their extravagant life style with revenues
from the Soyuz construction and interior decorating company
that Mr. Suchkov founded less than two years ago. Surgut, a
joyless concrete jungle built on a swamp by the river Ob, is
a big center for the Soviet oil and gas industry. As the two
are finding, anyone who can put up buildings and redo
interiors faster and better than state organizations is bound
to make a fortune.</p>
<p>Messrs. Suchkov and Telkov are the sort of people Mikhail
Gorbachev needs as he tries to steer the Soviet Union toward
a market economy. Private property still isn't legal in the
Soviet Union, but Mr. Gorbachev has allowed cooperatives, so
that's how the firm was founded. That means the local town
council could theoretically close it down any time, as has
happened to cooperatives elsewhere. Fortunately, the new head
of the council is an old colleague of Mr. Suchkov.</p>
<p>The handiwork of Messrs. Suchkov and Telkov can be found
all over town. Inside dormitory No. 10, a drab concrete block
that houses 300 oil workers, Soyuz has painted exotic
landscapes on the replastered walls. Director Maria Gorobets
sits in the ground-floor library, which has been made to look
like the interior of a medieval castle, complete with fake
brick fireplace, and gushes about their work. "They have so
much fantasy," she says. "It's really unusual."</p>
<p>Most of their other jobs, including a new brick plant and
a concrete office block for the state-owned oil company, are
less inspiring. But they provide solid income for Soyuz's
canny management, which uses all the tricks it can.</p>
<p>For instance, Soyuz has allied itself with the Surgut
chapter of the Young Communist League. Although Soyuz's
directors are downright disdainful of communism, the link
gives them a hefty tax break under Soviet rules. The league
has a special tax status similar to that of charities in the
U.S. Instead of paying the state corporate taxes of 45% of
its profits, the cooperative just pays 15% to the league.</p>
<p>Last year, the cooperative's revenues were about 1.7
million rubles, or $2.7 million. After paying for materials
and the wages of their 30 full-time workers, Messrs. Suchkov
and Telkov and a third director were left with about 50,000
rubles ($80,000) income apiece, plus a substantial sum that
they plowed back into the company. With the average national
wage here less than 3,000 rubles ($4,800) per year, that
makes them the Soviet equivalent of the Sultan of Brunei.</p>
<p>Despite the support and contracts they receive from local
authorities, not everyone is happy about their hefty income.
The local bank, for one, tends to scrutinize their accounts
to check for any evidence of bribery. Soyuz dismisses the
charge as envious nonsense.</p>
<p>And the two entrepreneurs are less than enthusiastic about
a new personal-income-tax law. "I work hard because I want to
live well, but hard work is starting to lose its sense," Mr.
Suchkov grumbles.</p>
<p>Under the new law, he faces steep progressive tax rates
for anything he earns over 700 rubles ($1,100) per month. "If
we didn't have a problem with taxes, we could build a big
firm," he says. "But as soon as you start earning more than
Gorbachev, people start complaining."</p>
<p>Taxes, however, are nothing compared with the everyday
hassles of keeping the firm running smoothly in a nation
plagued by shortages of everyday goods.</p>
<p>One morning, Mr. Telkov drives to a crumbling blue
building. Inside, next to the Aeroflot office, is one of
their latest projects: a hairdressing salon. They rented a
tiny room from Aeroflot, put in running water and painted the
place in warm yellow and brown tones. On each wall is their
trademark, a fleur-de-lis between two lighted candles.</p>
<p>"Baroque," says Mr. Telkov.</p>
<p>"Rococo," Mr. Suchkov corrects him.</p>
<p>Finding staff was no problem: They simply approached four
of the best hairdressers in the area and offered to triple
their salaries.</p>
<p>But where to get supplies? A relative who was recently in
Canada brought back some curling tongs, an electric
hair-dryer and a few complimentary bottles of Holiday Inn
shampoo. After that, they were on their own.</p>
<p>Mr. Telkov went to the Svoboda factory in Moscow, the
nation's biggest producer of soap and shampoo. It refused to
sell supplies to cooperatives on principle. Because the Soyuz
salon charges the same for its services as state-run
competitors, local distributors are supposed to provide them
with some materials. That, at least, is the theory.</p>
<p>To grease the wheels, they do small favors for their
competitors in the state sector who have access to government
supplies. In one case, a state hair salon wanted new orange
polka-dot overalls for its staff like the ones the
cooperative uses. The two obliged by going to their source in
far-away Tyumen for the material, in exchange for shampoo and
other supplies. "It's a long chain," Mr. Suchkov says.</p>
<p>Pampering themselves is easier than finding shampoo for
their company. There are plenty of gyms, built for the oil
workers; the Soyuz cooperative rents one four mornings a
week. And for some reason that nobody could explain, lots of
American chicken legs started appearing in Surgut's stores
recently.</p>
<p>Even in Siberia, money talks. But since anything worth
buying is only on sale on the black market, consumerism can
get pretty expensive.</p>
<p>They bought their Japanese TV sets and video recorders in
Moscow for a staggering 15,000 rubles, the equivalent of
$24,000. Prerecorded tapes go for about 150 rubles ($240). On
the edge of the Surgut farmer's market every Sunday, people
sell jeans for 350 rubles ($560). But that's too cheap for
Messrs. Suchkov and Telkov, who have known each other since
they studied together at a Tyumen Building Institute in the
early 1980s. They have developed a taste for Italian and
French linen trousers with designer labels that go for about
600 rubles ($1,000).</p>
<p>"It's so hard to find good children's clothes," says Mr.
Suchkov's wife, Yelena, taking another bite of American
chicken. Still, their four-year-old daughter Anna is neatly
turned out in a T-shirt which reads "Lambada" and a denim
skirt.</p>
<p>There are still some things that money can't buy. Mr.
Telkov, who is wearing a green "International Golf and
Country Club" shirt, talks about how he and his wife Galina
want to move out of their cramped apartment on the edge of
town. But all apartments are state-owned, and can't be bought
or sold. "We need private property," he grouses.</p>
<p>And then there are those annoying little things that would
irritate yuppies anywhere. The two couples recently went to
the Black Sea to work up a tan before their vacation in
Yugoslavia later this year.</p>
<p>"There are no decent restaurants in Sochi," Mr. Suchkov
complains. "You even have to bribe the waiter to serve you
champagne."</p>
