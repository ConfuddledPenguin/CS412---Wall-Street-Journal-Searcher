	<p class="article-leader">On Nov. 13, 1988, James and Patricia Miller of Carlsbad,
Calif., and their two sons got into their car, snapped on
their seat belts and headed off for dinner at a relative's
house. They didn't make it.
   The family had driven only a mile when another car swerved
across the center line of a country road and hit the Millers'
Ford Escort head-on. James and Patricia, in the front seat,
suffered broken bones and bruises. Their 11-year-old twin
boys in the back seat were far less fortunate. One was
killed, the other paralyzed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Why did the parents escape with relatively light injuries
despite being closer to the point of impact? They were
wearing "three-point" lap-and-shoulder seat belts. The boys
wore just lap belts, which were standard in the rear seats of
American cars for two decades.</p>
<p>The family sued Ford Motor Co., contending it knew
lap-only belts offered inadequate protection in a head-on
crash. "Here we were, safety conscious, wore the damn things
and paid the price because of them," says a still-grieving
James Miller. Ford maintains that the lap belts were
effective and that the car didn't "contribute to or enhance"
the boys' injuries. But in April it paid the Millers $6
million to settle the case rather than go to trial.</p>
<p>The Millers' case may be especially sad, but it is hardly
unique. Safety engineers have known for years that lap-only
belts don't prevent injuries as well as the lap-and-shoulder
variety, and could actually cause injuries in certain
situations. But shoulder belts weren't a priority for
regulators, they say, because only 2% of people buckled up in
the back seat until the mid-1980s. Only last fall were rear
lap-and-shoulder belts required on newly built U.S. cars.
Some 120 million cars still have rear lap-only belts.</p>
<p>At the current rate of use in the U.S., some 25 lives
would be saved and 500 people would avoid injury each year if
all cars had rear shoulder belts, according to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Twenty-five deaths,
regulators and auto makers note, is a tiny percentage of the
nearly 26,000 Americans killed each year in cars, but many of
these cases are particularly heart-wrenching because they
involve children sitting in the back.</p>
<p>Car companies are being hit by a rash of lawsuits over the
issue. General Motors Corp. recently disclosed in court that
in the past five years, more than 100 suits have been filed
against it alleging that "defects in rear-seat lap belts
resulted in injury or death." Ford says it has settled a
dozen Escort lap-belt cases and has 16 pending on all models.</p>
<p>Auto makers have introduced retrofit kits that convert lap
belts into lap-and-shoulder belts, but few drivers buy them.
They cost about $150, including installation. The kits aren't
available on all models, and some dealers have hesitated to
install them for fear of one day being sued for faulty
installation.</p>
<p>The kits pose a dilemma for regulators: They want to
publicize the kits' availability but don't want to scare
consumers who don't buy one from using their lap-only rear
belts. Lap belts are quite effective in side-impact and
rollover accidents, if not in head-on crashes.</p>
<p>Auto makers, who are under pressure from the
traffic-safety agency to increase efforts to make dealers
aware of the availability of the kits, say they're doing
their best to get people to buy them. Ford says it sent six
million letters to drivers last year advising them of the
kits.</p>
<p>It would have been relatively simple and inexpensive --
$20 a belt or less in today's dollars -- to have required
rear lap-and-shoulder belts as standard equipment in 1968,
the year auto makers were required to install them in the
front seat. And it would have been easier still in 1972, when
regulators went so far as to require car makers to install
anchor points for rear shoulder belts. But they never took
the final step and required the belts, largely because auto
makers opposed the idea.</p>
<p>"It's all taken too long," says Jerry Ralph Curry, who
took the helm at the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration last year and wants to speed up
decision-making.</p>
<p>It appears in retrospect that regulators might have done
car companies a favor by being more forceful. Auto makers
complain about regulation, but they also concede that it's
often the best way to deal with safety issues. Randall
Edwards, Chrysler Corp.'s manager of safety programs, says
auto makers for a long time believed that safety doesn't
sell. "It comes right out of the profit margin," he says.</p>
<p>But auto makers don't want to be seen as fighting safety
improvements because of cost considerations, and they resist
characterizing the issue in those terms. "Cost wasn't the
issue," says Richard J. Molloy, an associate general counsel
at Ford. He says Ford feared that shoulder harnesses would
discourage passengers from wearing any belt at all. He adds
that the children's car seats of the 1970s and early 1980s
worked with lap belts, and Ford worried that shoulder
harnesses might mean the seats would be used improperly.</p>
<p>"At that point in time, that {the lap-only belt} was the
best design known," maintains GM Chairman Robert C. Stempel.</p>
<p>But was it really? Since the 1960s, safety engineers have
known that, while lap belts keep people from hurtling out of
cars, they don't restrain the upper torso during frontal
collisions. Many European car makers started putting
three-point belts in rear seats during the 1970s. GM's own
Adam Opel AG subsidiary has put lap-and-shoulder belts in the
rear seats of cars sold in Sweden since 1975, and in West
Germany since 1979.</p>
<p>"We were perfectly aware that the wearer of lap belts
would bang his head into something in front of him," says Roy
Haeusler, Chrysler's chief engineer for automotive safety
from 1960 to 1974 and an early proponent of lap belts.</p>
<p>Engineers were also becoming aware of even more disturbing
injuries, ones apparently caused by lap-only belts
themselves. "The Seat Belt Syndrome," a 1962 report partially
paid for by the auto industry, described injuries caused by
lap belts rupturing the soft tissues of the belly. "It was
clear that the belt was causing them," says John W. Garrett,
who co-wrote the report, issued by the Automobile Crash
Injury Research program at Cornell University.</p>
<p>Regulators had always intended to require rear as well as
front shoulder harnesses. But Mr. Haeusler says the car
industry resisted the cost of a safety device with little
consumer appeal. Many drivers abhorred seat belts, and
Congress began pressuring regulators to slow down.</p>
<p>So in the early 1970s, regulators decided to concentrate
on improving safety in the front seat. "Once that was
accomplished," says Douglas Toms, the traffic-safety agency's
chief from 1970 to 1973, "then, we would move on to bringing
the rear seat up to the same level."</p>
<p>Instead, auto makers and regulators became locked in a
bitter fight over air bags in the front seat. "Into that
crack dropped rear shoulder belts, never to emerge again
until the early 1980s," says Benjamin Kelley of the Institute
for Injury Reduction, a group formed by trial lawyers that
lobbied for rear shoulder belts.</p>
<p>Tragedies continued to occur. One happened in 1980 to
Bernard Ames, a public-affairs officer at the traffic-safety
agency, who was riding in the back seat of a car that went
off the road. Mr. Ames, the only person in the car wearing
his seat belt, sustained internal injuries and later died
from complications. The other occupants escaped serious
injury.</p>
<p>The wearing of seat belts surged in the mid-1980s, mainly
because a series of state laws required their use. The laws
were aggressively supported by car makers in an unsuccessful
effort to dodge federal requirements for air bags or
automatic seat belts. Today, use of rear seat belts stands at
16%, while use in front seats approaches 50%.</p>
<p>In 1986, the National Transportation Safety Board, a
federal agency independent of the traffic-safety
administration, released a controversial report. "In many
cases the lap belts induced severe to fatal injuries that
probably would not have occurred if the lap belts had not
been worn," it concluded. Though safety experts attacked the
report because it only reviewed crashes where the lap belt
had caused injury, it attracted wide attention.</p>
<p>In June of that year, even before the report was released,
GM did an about-face and announced plans to install rear
lap-and-shoulder belts in all its cars within a few years.
The car maker was aware of the pending report, but said it
was switching because an internal study found that lap belts
were much less effective than previously thought.</p>
<p>The auto makers also faced a wave of lap-belt lawsuits. In
late 1987, a Maryland jury awarded $3.3 million to James
Garrett, a boy who was paralyzed while riding in the back of
a Ford Escort that ran into a truck. Because the award was
public, not settled out of court, the number of lawsuits
surged after that.</p>
<p>In July 1989, under pressure from Congress, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration adopted a rule
requiring three-point belts in rear seats (except in the
center position) by December 1989. Light trucks, including
minivans, were given until September 1991 to comply, though
some manufacturers are voluntarily installing them now.</p>
<p>The rules come too late for Melanie Knox Ellis, who is now
26. On July 26, 1987, she and her sister Julie Knox sustained
severe lap-belt injuries in a head-on collision on the way
home to Pennsylvania from the New Jersey seashore, where they
had celebrated Julie's 17th birthday.</p>
<p>"I remember waking up and feeling a hot, burning pain in
my belly," Mrs. Ellis says. That pain turned out to be a
severed artery, which eventually resulted in surgeons
removing all but 18 inches of her intestines. The two young
women also suffered broken backs. Because of her shortened
intestines, Mrs. Ellis has chronic digestive problems,
including trouble retaining nutrients. She recently married,
but has decided not to bear children on the ground that her
body can't nourish another being. GM settled the sisters'
case last month, according to their attorney, Neal Pope, who
says all terms are confidential. GM declines to comment.</p>
<p>In the crash, the front-seat passenger, was wearing a
three-point belt and suffered a lesser back injury. The
driver, who also was wearing a lap-shoulder belt, walked away
unhurt.</p>
