	<p class="article-leader">YAMAGATA, Japan -- People in this rural prefecture are
determined to defend Japan's ban on imported rice -- but deep
down, many believe change is inevitable.
   "I don't like the idea of (eating) things grown in places
I can't see," says Takehiko Takahashi, operator of a
noodle-shop and part-time rice miller. "But some things you
just can't do anything about."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Two hundred miles to the south, in Tokyo, politicians are
beginning to talk guardedly about a limited opening of the
rice market. Politically, it would be Japan's riskiest
market-opening measure yet. But it's the price Japan may have
to pay for a successful conclusion to the latest round of
multilateral trade negotiations under the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade. U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Clayton
Yeutter pushed that view during meetings with Japanese
officials in Tokyo this week, and some Japanese officials
privately agree with him.</p>
<p>Japan's 4.2 million farm households and their main
lobbyist, the powerful union of agricultural cooperatives
called Nokyo, are alarmed. The farmers' political influence
has long outweighed their numbers, and many observers think
it's only a matter of time before the government adopts a
long-awaited redistricting plan that would shift more voting
power to the cities.</p>
<p>On a steamy August day, some 200 farmers gather in
Yamagata for a Nokyo forum with representatives of all the
major parties. Each politician reaffirms the official
doctrine, embedded in a resolution passed by the Diet,
Japan's parliament, that Japan should remain self-sufficient
in rice production.</p>
<p>But when the floor is thrown open to questions, one farmer
recalls that similar promises were made about the country's
beef and citrus markets, only to be tossed aside in the face
of persistent U.S. pressure. What's to stop the government
from caving in on this issue, too? he wonders.</p>
<p>Similar questions are on the minds of people throughout
this region, where shimmering, green rice paddies carpet the
valley. Clusters of homes amid tall shade trees mark the
villages whose residents own the surrounding paddies.</p>
<p>In one such hamlet, 51-year-old Matsuo Itagaki and his
wife are packing melons laid out on a straw mat on the floor
of their barn. Their household is typical of the region's
farm families. The Itagakis work their five acres of rice
land -- a fifth of it given over to other crops under a
government program to trim surplus production of rice -- and
smaller patches of land for melons and fodder for silkworms.
Their two sons commute to salaried jobs: the 26-year-old
works in a cardboard factory, the younger in a government
office.</p>
<p>When the parents can no longer farm, their sons might keep
the rice paddies going, Mr. Itagaki says. The children aren't
likely to give up their weekday jobs for the risk and tedium
of the dry-field crops, he says. But with rice farming,
mechanization has made it possible for the once backbreaking
work to be done only on weekends. And rice farming produces a
reliable income, thanks to government price supports.</p>
<p>But Japan's agriculture ministry doesn't want to encourage
more weekend rice farmers. Instead, it hopes to promote
larger-scale farms. Many experts, including farmers, agree
that Japanese farms will be more cost-efficient only when
their scale is increased sharply.</p>
<p>Toshio Yamaguchi, a ruling-party member of the Diet who
last month declared that opening of the Japanese rice market
is "inevitable," cites Yamagata's cherry growers as a model.
While easing of restrictions on cherry imports has enabled
American cherries to claim a spot on Japanese supermarket
shelves, the Japanese cherry industry has also thrived,
thanks to improved growing techniques and clever marketing.</p>
<p>But cherries are a seasonal product, and something of a
luxury. Rice farmers here doubt that importing rice would
help reverse the long, gradual decline in Japanese rice
consumption.</p>
<p>How much a lifting of the ban on rice imports would do for
U.S. exports is unclear. No one is calling for a total
opening of the market right away. Mr. Yeutter indicated this
week that the U.S. could accept some form of import quotas,
in combination with tariffs, as an interim step in
liberalizing the rice market. But he warned that the U.S.
Congress and some developing countries would scuttle any GATT
accord that doesn't include "meaningful reform in
agriculture."</p>
<p>In one of the more elaborate proposals, a group of
Japanese academics recently suggested setting an import
ceiling of 200,000 tons in 1992. (Japan now produces and
consumes about 10 million tons a year of milled rice.) Under
the Forum for Policy Innovation's plan, Japan would gradually
increase the ceiling while lowering domestic support prices.</p>
<p>After 1997, according to the plan, the ceiling would be
replaced by a 200% import duty, which the group thinks would
be enough to protect domestic producers. Though Japanese rice
now sells for six to seven times the price of U.S. rice, the
group calculates that imports of short-grained California
rice would be only three to four times cheaper than Japanese
rice of comparable quality, after shipping and handling
costs.</p>
<p>Thailand and China could also compete for market share,
though some experts say those countries seem several years
away from being able to export Japanese-style rice in large
volumes. Thailand, which already exports about 10,000 tons of
rice a year to Japan for use in alcohol under a loophole in
the import ban, is the world's leading rice exporter. In
1989, Thailand exported about six million tons of unhusked
rice, compared with about three million tons for the U.S.,
according to the international Food and Agriculture
Organization.</p>
<p>Four years ago, Mr. Yeutter, as U.S. special trade
representative, turned down a petition by the U.S. Rice
Millers Association for action against Japan, and said the
U.S. instead would try to win access to the Japanese market
through the GATT talks. With those talks scheduled to end in
December, Mr. Yeutter now says he is "cautiously optimistic"
that Japan will find the political courage to open its
market.</p>
<p>The crisis in the Middle East, meanwhile, may be giving
new impetus to the U.S. pressure on Japan over rice, because
Iraq was the biggest export market for U.S. rice farmers.</p>
