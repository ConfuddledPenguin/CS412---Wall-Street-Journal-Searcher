	<p class="article-leader">Fears that rising petroleum prices will increase farmers'
costs on a range of products, along with sizzling weather in
central growing regions, forced soybean futures prices
higher.
   The contract for November delivery of soybeans rose 12.25
cents a bushel to settle at $6.4150, a five-week high for
soybean futures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The high price of oil is likely to inflate costs of
bringing the crops to market, including prices of fertilizer,
chemicals and transportation. Analysts said that concern
drove the market from the start of trading yesterday.
"Initially, I think we were supported by oil prices," said
Steve Freed, analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago.
"That pushed us through some key resistance points."</p>
<p>Buying picked up steam when fund managers and investment
houses, including Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., jumped in.
Traders said Shearson bought futures for 24 million bushels
of soybeans, and other houses followed suit.</p>
<p>One major factor supporting the surge in prices was dry,
hot weather in the soybean growing region from Missouri to
Tennessee and along the Mississippi River. The area has seen
only 40% to 60% of normal August rainfall, and no rain is
forecast through the weekend.</p>
<p>Those factors are feeding a general notion that soybean
yields may not be as high as predicted by the U.S.
Agriculture Department, which has forecast a yield of about
1.84 billion bushels for August.</p>
<p>However, because farmers in the Mississippi River valley
plant a different, more resilient kind of soybean than their
Northern counterparts, the crop could rebound even with late
rain, said Daniel Basse, director of market research for
AgResource Co., Chicago.</p>
<p>Rumors of additional Soviet purchases of soybean meal were
circulating in the market yesterday, as was the belief that
farmers in Brazil, a large soybean producer, will be hit hard
by petroleum-related costs. Analysts predicted the soybean
and other grain markets will continue to move on the basis of
news from outside markets.</p>
<p>Prices of corn and wheat futures contracts also rose.</p>
<p>In other commodities markets yesterday:</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices showed small changes, as
the market entered a holding pattern pending fresh news.
December gold traded over an $8-an-ounce range, between $417
and $425, before ending $1 higher at $420.30 an ounce.
December silver fell 0.50 cent an ounce to $5.2530. October
platinum advanced $3.10 an ounce to $505.90. The bullion
market was active overnight in Europe, as dealers bought and
sold aggressively "with a slight emphasis on the buying
side," according to one analyst. A significant development in
New York futures trading was that the December contract
failed to rise above $425 for the fifth time since March.
This failure is heightening skepticism that gold can rise
significantly from current levels, the analyst said.
"Everything is bullish for gold: The military situation in
the Middle East is approaching a crucial stage, possibly a
shooting one; oil continues to surge, and oil products are
roaring higher; the dollar continues to plunge, as have
stocks and bonds; and yet gold does very little," he said.
One reason for the sluggishness is that traders may be going
directly into other types of investments such as oil,
currencies and interest-rate futures, he said, and it may
take a major development such as a shooting war to send gold
skyrocketing. Another analyst said the market in the past
several weeks has absorbed a huge amount of selling and
behaved well in doing so. He said the Soviet Union may have
sold 75 to 90 tons (a metric ton of gold equals 32,150
ounces), that mining companies had been heavy sellers to fix
their gold at relatively high prices and that some selling
might even have come from Iraq. Also, he said, there has been
little pickup in demand from Europe, the U.S. and the Far
East. Trading has been mostly among major dealers, he said.</p>
<p>COPPER: Futures prices rose. The December contract
advanced 1.15 cents a pound to $1.2350. Demand was mostly for
contracts from December forward, analysts said, with
liquidation in the soon-to-expire September contract holding
the price advance to a modest 0.50 cent at $1.2965. The first
day for notices to be issued indicating intention to deliver
copper against the September contract is next Friday; the
approach of this date was believed to have triggered the
selling of September contracts, analysts said. As for the
strength in the deferred positions, Fred D'Agostino,
president of Metal Resources Inc., a Riverside, Conn., copper
trading firm, said: "Copper at the moment isn't reflecting
fundamentals as much as it is reacting to the Middle Eastern
crisis. The possibility that a slower U.S. economy might
reduce demand for copper is more remote than immediate
concern over the Persian Gulf tension. This has become a
highly emotional market."</p>
<p>SUGAR: Futures prices advanced. The October contract rose
0.29 cent a pound to 11.31 cents. Judith Ganes, analyst for
Merrill Lynch, said that while the Mideast crisis has taken
some steady buyer countries from that area out of the world
market, higher prices for oil and gold may stimulate the
Soviet Union to spend some of its income from those
commodities on sugar. In addition, oil prices might prompt
Brazil to convert more cane to fuel alcohol rather than to
sugar, which would reduce the exportable amount of sugar.
F.O. Licht, a West German sugar statistical firm, predicted
production of sugar beets in Europe for the 1990-91 season,
which begins Sept. 1, of 33.5 million metric tons, up from
32.9 million tons in the current season. This expected
increase could stimulate demand for sugar, which had been
held down by smaller output and higher prices, Licht said.</p>
