	<p class="article-leader">Flagship Financial Corp., Jenkintown, Pa., said it plans
to close or sell the five retail offices of its First
American Savings unit in New Jersey, write off $10 million of
good will, and accelerate the buildup of its loan-loss
reserves.
   Flagship estimated the effect of these actions would be a
charge of $13 million against third-quarter earnings that
would be partly offset by future improvements in earnings,
lower quarterly expenses and reduced taxes. In the 1989 third
quarter, Flagship earned $1.5 million, or 42 cents a share,
including a gain of $312,000, or nine cents a share, on the
sale of assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Flagship said it decided that First American couldn't meet
profit targets in the New Jersey market "in a reasonable
time," so the company will concentrate instead on expanding
in suburban Pennsylvania markets.</p>
