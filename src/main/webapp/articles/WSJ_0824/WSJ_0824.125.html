	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Citing strong sales performance, especially in
overseas markets, and continued success in bringing in new
products, Sony Corp. said consolidated pretax profit rose 32%
to 70.27 billion yen ($481 million) during its first quarter
from 53.18 billion yen a year earlier.
   Sales in the June 30 quarter soared 47%, to 841.18 billion
yen from 571.81 billion a year earlier.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Net income increased 5.7% to 24.54 billion yen from 23.21
billion in the year-earlier period. Net income growth slowed
despite the sharp increase in sales because of the expenses
connected with the company's acquisition of Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. last November, Sony said.</p>
<p>Sony's strong performance in the first quarter reflects
strong sales growth in all product categories and geographic
regions.</p>
<p>Overseas sales, which account for 74% of the company's
sales, posted a bullish 63% increase from a year earlier,
helped by good demand in overseas economies as well as the
yen's weakness against most major foreign currencies, a
spokesman said. Overseas sales amounted to 620.22 billion
yen, compared with 380.41 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Domestic sales rose 15% to 220.97 billion yen from 191.41
billion.</p>
<p>While the electronics industry in general has had
difficulty increasing sales in the past year because of a
greater profusion of audio and video equipment, Sony fared
well because of the immense popularity of 8mm-video
camcorders, as well as strong growth in other electronics
areas and its record business, Sony said.</p>
<p>By product category, sales of video equipment grew 38% to
221.19 billion yen from 159.81 billion. In addition to 8mm
video camcorders -- with sales of 800,000 units during the
quarter, up from 550,000 units a year earlier -- video
equipment for broadcast use contributed to strong sales.</p>
<p>Audio equipment sales rose 30% to 191.89 billion yen from
147.68 billion. Sales of compact-disk players increased to
two million units from 1.6 million units. The company's
Walkman stereo line sold 3.6 million units compared with
3,150,000 a year earlier.</p>
<p>Sales of television sets also advanced strongly, by 41% to
124.47 billion yen from 88.03 billion in the corresponding
period a year ago. Large-screen color TVs registered
especially strong growth in both domestic and overseas
markets, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Sales in other product categories, which include
semiconductors, electric parts, workstations and telephone
and other communication equipment, rose 49% to 124.46 billion
yen from 83.53 billion.</p>
<p>Sales at Sony's record division rose 25% to 115.65 billion
yen from 92.76 billion, helped by growth in sales by Sony's
CBS Records Inc.</p>
<p>The movie division, newly added due to November's
acquisition of Columbia Pictures Entertainment, posted 63.53
billion yen in sales, which accounted for 7.6% of Sony's
overall sales for the period.</p>
