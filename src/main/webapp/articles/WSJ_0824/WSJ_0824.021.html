	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- A rise in the price of oil to $40 a barrel could
shave $20 billion a year off Japan's trade surplus, the Tokai
Bank Ltd. reported.
   Oil prices have climbed sharply since Iraq invaded Kuwait
Aug. 2, with the price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate
oil for October delivery rising above $30 in Tokyo yesterday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest statistics show that rising oil prices could
trigger higher interest rates, lowering Japan's real economic
growth by 0.8 percentage point.</p>
<p>The impact of higher oil on Japan's economy will be
relatively light, compared with the blows Japan suffered in
the two oil crises of the 1970s, a bank official said.</p>
