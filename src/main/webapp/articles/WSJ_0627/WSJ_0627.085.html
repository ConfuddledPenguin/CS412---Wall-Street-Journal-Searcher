	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration announced some steps
designed to preserve the endangered northern spotted owl, but
it put off issuing its promised long-term strategy for saving
the bird without seriously damaging the timber industry.
   The administration said its plan would cost 1,000 logging
jobs in the Pacific Northwest. But environmentalists
contended it would allow so much logging in the next two
years that little room would be left to carry out any
long-term plan ultimately agreed upon.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This is the most short-sighted approach to saving the owl
and saving the timber industry that the White House could
come up with," said Rindy O'Brien, chief lobbyist for the
Wilderness Society.</p>
<p>In announcing the forest-management steps, administration
officials also said they support pending legislation that
would ban the export of raw logs from state lands. The Forest
Service estimates that the change would save about 6,000
sawmill jobs in the Pacific Northwest by the year 2000.</p>
<p>In addition, the administration said it will ask Congress
to expand the role of a cabinet-level committee that rules on
whether proposed timber sales would jeopardize an endangered
species. Under the administration's plan, the panel also
would be allowed to develop long-term forest-management
plans. Environmentalists objected strenuously to this
proposal, saying, among other things, that it would
politicize the forestry decisions.</p>
<p>The administration also plans to seek legislation that
would allow it to carry out the spotted owl forest-management
plans without being subject to court challenge.</p>
<p>On Friday, the administration declared the owl threatened
and put it under the protection of the Endangered Species
Act. That decision brought dismay to the industry, but timber
groups were more hopeful after yesterday's announcement.</p>
<p>"It is encouraging that the federal agencies are
responding to President Bush's call for balance as it applies
to protecting northern spotted owls and timber families,"
said Mark Rey, executive director of the American Forest
Resource Alliance, an industry group.</p>
<p>Under the administration's plan, there will be little, if
any, change in the amount of logging on federal lands in the
Pacific Northwest for the current fiscal year, which ends
Sept. 30. In the following year, logging on Interior
Department land will be reduced to 750 million-to-800 million
board feet from about 950 million board feet this year. The
plan was outlined by Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
and Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan.</p>
<p>Mr. Lujan said the steps would save 450 pairs of owls, 125
more than under a plan proposed by an inter-agency scientific
panel last spring. There are about 2,000 pairs of owls left,
mostly in old-growth forests in Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>The 1,000 jobs to be lost as a result of the
administration's plan compares with 7,600 under the earlier
proposal. Environmentalists, however, contend that the
reduced employment loss would be achieved only because the
administration would allow excessive cutting in areas that
aren't designated as spotted owl habitats.</p>
<p>The Agriculture Department, which controls land accounting
for 75% of the annual timber harvest, hasn't presented its
plan for future fiscal years. The administration is setting
up an inter-agency task force to devise a forest management
plan for fiscal 1991 that it says will be designed to protect
the owl while mitigating economic dislocation. The panel,
which will be headed by Mr. Yeutter and will consult with
lawmakers and governors from affected states, will complete
its work by Sept. 1 so that any legislative changes
recommended can be acted upon in the current congressional
session.</p>
<p>"The administration is deeply concerned both about
endangered species and the livelihood of families in the
Pacific Northwest who depend on timber production," Mr.
Yeutter told reporters.</p>
