	<p class="article-leader">JERSEY CITY, N.J. -- In 1982, Earl Aldredge, a Vietnam
veteran who vowed to track down industrial polluters,
literally unearthed what has become New Jersey's biggest
environmental-cleanup problem.
   Working as a volunteer for Jersey City, the 300-pound Mr.
Aldredge, outfitted as always in his cowboy boots, 10-gallon
hat and cowboy shirt with "Toxic Tex" embroidered in
rhinestones, discovered white, yellow and green crystals
growing on surface soil around the city. State testing
verified that the crystals were chromium, a potentially
hazardous substance.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Sifting through city demolition permits, Mr. Aldredge
tracked the chromium waste back to local slag piles. He then
began hounding the state to take action. "He was so
persistent that you couldn't ignore him," says Thomas McKee,
the state enforcement agent working on the case.</p>
<p>Eight years later, Mr. Aldredge's persistence has evolved
into a complicated -- and potentially expensive -- legal
wrangle for three companies that the state blames for the
slag. The problem is especially nettlesome for PPG Industries
Inc. of Pittsburgh. Until 1964, PPG's plant, located in the
heart of the city, processed chromium ore to make paint
pigments. The resulting slag -- iron laced with chromium and
other chemicals -- was then trucked and used as landfill in
at least 58 sites in Jersey City alone, according to the New
Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.</p>
<p>Burying industrial wastes was once common in the chemical
industry. But now, past actions are being judged under new
standards. The upshot: More and more environmental skeletons
are being unearthed and are coming back to haunt companies
such as PPG.</p>
<p>"Environmental problems always are a potential
blind-side," says Charles Locastro, a securities analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. PPG, he says, is well managed
and "pretty conscientious about dealing with environmental
problems." Yet he expects it to put in reserves as much as
$30 million to $40 million annually for a number of years to
handle problems such as those at Jersey City.</p>
<p>The Department of Environmental Protection has ordered PPG
to pay $31.5 million to clean up some of the Jersey City
sites, the ones in residential areas. If PPG refuses, the
department could go to court and perhaps get that sum
trebled. The order has forced PPG to negotiate on a
settlement after years of stonewalling, says Michael Schuit,
a state regulatory lawyer involved in the discussions. Mr.
Schuit says PPG's attorneys have privately estimated its
total cleanup costs at $200 million to $300 million. PPG
calls those figures speculative.</p>
<p>During New Jersey's eight-year pursuit of PPG, state
regulators have built their case against the company.
Voluminous documents, including sworn statements from former
PPG employees and internal PPG reports subpoenaed by the
state, show that company officials knew back in the 1950s
that the chromium wastes posed at least minor health risks.</p>
<p>PPG says that the state can't prove which slag came from
which company, and that PPG won't take responsibility for
slag it didn't produce. It also terms the state's cleanup
standards too stringent. Though refusing to disclose the
amount it has set aside for future cleanups, PPG says it
believes its reserves, as well as insurance coverage, can
cover anticipated liabilities.</p>
<p>So far, only one of the three slag producers has agreed to
clean up chromium-contaminated sites -- some 26 of them, all
in neighboring Kearny and Secaucus. In April, Maxus Energy
Corp., a Dallas petroleum producer formerly called Diamond
Shamrock, agreed to provide up to $51.5 million for cleanup.
Maxus also will pay a $2.5 million fine, the largest
environmental levy New Jersey has ever assessed.</p>
<p>A third company, Allied-Signal Inc., acquired its
liability. In 1954, Allied bought a closed
chromium-processing plant in Jersey City as part of its
purchase of Mutual Chemical Co. of America. And though Allied
sold the plant just a few months later, the state holds it
responsible for the plant's slag. Allied's cleanup appears
less complicated, though, because 90% to 95% of the slag is
buried at the original dump site.</p>
<p>PPG isn't as fortunate. Hauling records, PPG receipts of
slag sales and sworn statements from trucking people indicate
that its slag was trucked extensively throughout the city. As
a result, its potential liability could grow. Already, Exxon
Corp. has sued PPG in state Superior Court seeking removal of
chromium from contaminated oil-storage properties in Jersey
City. (The two other companies are also defendants, though
with apparently less exposure.) The Exxon suit in January
follows a similar action, which PPG settled, by Ultramar
Petroleum Inc.</p>
<p>Such suits could be only the beginning. One Jersey City
law firm's ad in a local paper features a skull and
crossbones and asks "anyone living or working close to
chromium" to join others filing claims. Health officials,
meanwhile, want to conduct clinical studies to determine just
how serious a hazard the slag poses.</p>
<p>For some Jersey City residents, the hazard is apparent.
Neil Napolitano used to ride his bicycle in a tiny park next
to his house here. But a year ago, state inspectors found
chromium slag buried there, and the city put up a warning
sign. Now, tests show high levels of chromium in the
14-year-old boy's body. For years, he had suffered from
rashes on his elbows, severe headaches and respiratory
ailments, which his doctor now thinks were allergic reactions
to chromium. Since the boy has avoided the park, his health
has improved. But his doctor says he can't say what the
long-term effects may be.</p>
<p>Adding to local fears is the grisly death two years ago of
a 60-year-old welder who had worked at a truck terminal in
nearby Kearny. A state medical examiner attributed the man's
death partly to chromium poisoning. The septum of the man's
nose, the bridge separating the two nasal passages, had been
eaten away, a condition that was common among chromium
workers as recently as the 1960s. The chromium also
apparently had bored a hole through the roof of the man's
mouth and turned his skull yellow.</p>
<p>Health concerns have been heightened because the waste is
all over Jersey City. It lies beneath vacant lots fenced off
with "Keep Out" signs. Houses are built on or near it; so are
parks, libraries and warehouses. Last summer, chromium dust
was discovered in the carpeting, duct work and vacuum
cleaners of an elementary school -- and in the children's
blood. PPG, saying the state couldn't prove that any of the
dust at the school came from its slag, has refused to pay the
$251,500 cleanup bill the state sent it.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Jersey City, an abandoned discount store sits
near the site of an abandoned drive-in theater. For years,
the area was known as the "yellow lake" because
yellow-stained rain water would pool there and empty into the
Hackensack River.</p>
<p>"There's about 950,000 tons of chromium sitting there,"
says Mr. McKee, sipping coffee in a nearby diner. To
temporarily prevent slag from moving or blowing about,
plastic tarps have been spread over about half of the 30-acre
site.</p>
<p>Against this background, Robert Hazen, the state
environmental agency's manager of risk assessment, says
Jersey City chromium could be more serious than the
celebrated Love Canal case. "It's worse because that
situation was mostly PCBs and dioxins and only involved one
spot," he says. The Love Canal solvents haven't been
positively linked to human cancer, but the most hazardous
form of chromium, hexavalent chromium, is known to cause
cancer through inhalation.</p>
<p>Mr. Hazen also notes that the material in Love Canal
didn't climb walls or form crystals blown about by wind. But
chromium, being water-soluble, doesn't always stay put. It
seeps through concrete, is drawn up cinder-block walls and
slides around like Jello under buildings. Now, many concrete
floors and walls of buildings are buckling throughout Jersey
City.</p>
<p>The leaching process is more mysterious. Ronald Ross, a
former consultant to the Hudson County Regional Health
Commission, says contamination rates can change drastically
for no apparent reason. At a warehouse once rented by
Leaseway Transportation Corp., for instance, monitoring
initially showed little to worry about. But, when Dr. Ross
rechecked a few months later, chromium "suddenly popped out
all over the place in a couple of areas in the building," he
says.</p>
<p>Afterward, says Lynn Clark, Leaseway's director of
environmental affairs, the Cleveland-based trucking company
relocated its eight employees because "we were concerned
about their safety," both because of chromium exposure and
because the warehouse's walls became unstable as slag under
its footings shifted.</p>
<p>PPG's plant on Garfield Avenue was a popular place in
winter during the 1950s and '60s. Its two- and
three-story-tall mounds of green, black and yellow slag
became sledding hills for children when the snow fell.</p>
<p>But inside the antiquated, turn-of-the-century plant, the
work was hot and dangerous. Orange and yellow dust floated
about. Kilns, heated to 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, roasted
chrome ore from South Africa into quarter-inch pellets and
crystals. These products were sold to makers of yellow,
orange and green paints, and to make chrome for auto bumpers
and trim.</p>
<p>Even then, the dangers of hexavalent chromium were
well-known. Studies dating back decades suggested that the
dust probably caused lung cancer and commonly destroyed
workers' septums.</p>
<p>Chester J. Milczarek, the plant's manager and chief
chemist from 1957 until 1961, said in a sworn statement in
1987 as part of a Jersey City Redevelopment Authority lawsuit
against PPG that he routinely took air samples because PPG
wanted to prevent such injuries. (PPG lost that suit in
Newark federal court and was ordered to pay the authority
$253,000 to clean up a contaminated site in the city. PPG's
appeal of the judgment failed.)</p>
<p>One of Mr. Milczarek's technicians had a perforated
septum. Many other employees had "chrome sores," skin ulcers
evidently caused by exposure to chromium. This was especially
true, Mr. Milczarek testified, of workers who didn't wear
gloves; the dust invaded scratches and cuts. The sores almost
always left scars because company nurses, to clean them,
picked off the scabs every day; otherwise, untreated lesions
would spread, Mr. Milczarek testified.</p>
<p>Mr. Milczarek testified that his own tests of PPG's slag
showed that at least 1% was the known carcinogin, hexavalent
chrome. The company admits to producing about 330,000 tons of
slag.</p>
<p>By the time he left the plant in 1961, Mr. Milczarek
testified, most of the slag was gone -- sold as landfill for
as little as 10 cents a cubic yard or, in some instances,
given away. Donald Dailey, works manager at the PPG plant
from 1956 until 1964, said in a deposition last year that
people were "so anxious to get {slag} that we didn't have any
trouble getting rid of it.</p>
<p>"Sometimes it caused so much traffic congestion that we
would have to tell them to slow down for a while," said Mr.
Dailey, whose sworn statement was taken in connection with
Ultramar's suit against PPG. "Anything you got out of it was
gravy and solved the problem of storage." PPG's plant was the
smallest facility of the three in the area, and it simply
didn't have the room to keep the slag.</p>
<p>The slag was prized because plants rarely would grow in
it, making it a favorite fill for potholes and street
projects. And a newspaper article in the 1950s quoted Jersey
City's public-works director as saying, "We tested it and
found that it killed off rats." The article said he had all
but eliminated rodents at the city's big housing projects
with it.</p>
<p>PPG's own records, subpoenaed by the state, show that the
company was concerned about the chromium for years after its
plant had been dismantled and the site sold. In 1981, for
example, company officials visited the site and noted the
hexavalent chrome at a truck-turnaround area and along a
railroad embankment. "Runoff from these areas flows to city
storm sewers and into upper New York Bay," the lower Hudson
and North rivers, the PPG memo says.</p>
<p>Now, some residents say the chromium problem has
practically ruled out any redevelopment in the inner city.
Before fears about the slag spread, some redevelopment had
been going on because Jersey City is just across the Hudson
from lower Manhattan. One suspected PPG slag site is landfill
used in Liberty State Park, a reclaimed area on the Jersey
City waterfront close to the Statue of Liberty and Ellis
Island.</p>
<p>Only two years ago, Mildred Napolitano, Neil's mother,
says she could have sold their house for $169,000. "Now, it's
worth zip," she says. She says one insurance company has
canceled coverage because of chromium found at the park,
which the state contends was produced by PPG. Mrs.
Napolitano, an employee of the county welfare department,
says she can't afford to buy another house.</p>
<p>What may be worse, she says, is that friends rarely visit
her anymore out of fear of contamination. "We're living in a
nightmare," she says. "I wish the company that dumped the
chrome here would buy my house so I could move away."</p>
