	<p class="article-leader">Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc., citing a slowdown
in the art market, said it expects as much as a 75% decrease
in second-quarter earnings, to between six and 10 cents a
share, on sharply lower sales.
   A year earlier, Martin Lawrence earned $2 million, or 24
cents a share, on sales of $12.9 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Martin S. Blinder, chairman of the retail-art gallery
operator based in Los Angeles, said sales will be 12% to 17%
below the year-earlier figure. The fall-off reflects a
continued decline in consumer retail spending, he said,
besides the broad-based softening in the art market.</p>
<p>The company said it blames the art market's current
weakness on disappointing auctions conducted in May by the
major New York auction houses. It believes the next major
test of the market's strength will come in November, at the
fall New York auctions.</p>
