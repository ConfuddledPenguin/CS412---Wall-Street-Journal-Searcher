	<p class="article-leader">Just how Sicilian dons came to control the U.S. heroin
traffic is the subject of Claire Sterling's "Octopus: The
Long Reach of the International Sicilian Mafia" (Norton, 384
pages, $19.95). Carefully researched, vividly written,
"Octopus" goes a long way to untangle a subject that is among
the most difficult to investigate and understand.
   A longtime resident of Italy, Ms. Sterling has written
extensively on terrorism's global reach, most recently in
"The Time of the Assassins," which linked the near murder of
Pope John Paul II to the Bulgarians and the KGB. In
"Octopus," she shows how the Sicilian Mafia (and not its
American offspring as conventionally believed) played a key
role in setting up the heroin pipeline to the U.S. and the
distribution network here.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As far back as 1957, the American dons "leased" domestic
narcotics distribution to their Sicilian godfathers. With a
firm monopoly on marketing, the Sicilians made deals with
Turkish gangs that managed the pipeline bringing heroin from
Pakistan to the eastern Mediterranean. But in the early
1970s, the French authorities shut down the "French
Connection" laboratories, thereby eliminating the Sicilians'
main competitors. From then on, Palermo was the sole
headquarters for the assault on the U.S.</p>
<p>Much of the story is told through fascinating and often
frightening portraits of drug lords, among them Michele
Sindona, favorite banker to the Mafia until he lost billions
for the dons in his bank scams; and Luciano Leggio -- the
"capo di tutti i capi." Locked up for life in 1974 on a
murder conviction, Leggio continued to conduct much of his
business from his Italian jail cell, establishing near total
control of the Sicilian Mafia's activities, including the
drug trade. Leggio's centralized authority, coupled with
control of the raw heroin supply and laboratories, resulted
in an enormous infusion of heroin into the U.S. by the end of
1977. The population of heroin addicts rose to about 750,000
-- nearly 20 times the number in 1963 when the Sicilian Mafia
began its serious assault.</p>
<p>Ms. Sterling has no patience with any liberal notions that
drug dealers are only catering to some inherent weakness of
our already corrupt society. "Octopus" documents the
extensive efforts by the Sicilians to stimulate demand and
expand their drug markets.</p>
<p>In this effort they were aided by some of the losers in
the Mafia wars in Sicily who emigrated to Canada, Brazil,
Venezuela and the U.S., where they became franchisees for the
home company. Ms. Sterling points out that in 1972, when the
entire U.S. heroin population consumed some 90 kilos (198
pounds) a month, the Brazilian Mafia families alone were
preparing to ship 300 kilos a month. The Mafia was not just
feeding a habit, but creating one.</p>
<p>But "Octopus" also describes the incredible battle put up
by the Italian police and members of the judiciary, who
challenged the Sicilian Mafia on its own turf. Many were
blown up or shot to death, including the prefect of Palermo,
gunned down with his young wife by Kalashnikovwielding thugs.
Others survived to see hundreds of Mafiosi they had put
behind bars in the 1980s slip back into business through
grotesque loopholes. Beginning in 1986, an Italian high court
packed with judicial theorists systematically threw out lower
court verdicts on procedural grounds that ranged from
"defects of motivation" to "errors of form."</p>
<p>If there is a weakness in "Octopus," it concerns the
cocaine trade, where convincing documentation is still
lacking. But given what Ms. Sterling has learned about the
Sicilian Mafia, it is reasonable to suppose -- as she does --
that the untouched and uncontrolled Mafia families in
Venezuela have established close business ties with the
Medellin gangsters next door in Colombia, just as the
Sicilian Mafia dominated the Turkish, Corsican and Camorra
gangs in earlier periods. Whoever controls the distribution
network eventually controls the supply as well.</p>
<p>There are some valuable lessons in "Octopus." Foremost is
that no anti-drug program can succeed without a close working
relationship between law enforcement and judicial agencies,
both nationally and internationally. When such cooperation
exists, great achievements are possible; without it, each
country and each branch of government flounders in its own
confusion. Typical was the "Pizza Connection" court case that
partially uncovered the Sicilian Mafia's delivery and
distribution system for heroin in the U.S. Unfortunately,
because of the deplorable lack of cooperation between the
DEA, FBI and various local and state enforcement agencies,
only one segment of the system was exposed, leaving the
pipeline intact.</p>
<p>That information must be shared was learned -- after years
of failure -- by those fighting terrorism in the mid-1980s,
thanks in part to the work of a presidential task force
headed by then-Vice President George Bush. It is mystifying
that this basic insight has not been driven home to our
anti-narcotics leaders. Perhaps this excellent book will help
remind them of this fundamental principle of effective
action.</p>
