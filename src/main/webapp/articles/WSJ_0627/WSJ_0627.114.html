	<p class="article-leader">FRANKFURT, West Germany -- In what appears to be the first
corporate takeover battle in East Germany, five West German
insurance companies made a 270 million mark ($161 million)
counteroffer for 51% of the state-owned East German insurance
monopoly.
   The move is intended to block a controversial plan by
Europe's largest insurance concern, Munich-based Allianz AG,
to acquire control of the East German monopoly, which will
become a West German-style joint-stock company called
Deutsche Versicherungs AG in July.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The five insurers said their offer about equals the price
Allianz would pay for its intended share in Deutsche
Versicherungs. The East German government earlier agreed to
sell Allianz a 49% stake in Deutsche Versicherungs, which
initially would have 100% control of the East German
insurance market.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Cologne-based Colonia Versicherungs AG, a
leader of the group of five companies bidding against
Allianz, said the group had been talking with East German
officials since June 14 about taking a stake in the insurance
monopoly. Colonia identified the other members of the
competing group as Gothaer Lebensversicherung AG, Nordstern
Versicherungsgesellschaften, R&V Versicherungsgruppe and
Wuertembergerische Feuer.</p>
<p>The group's talks with the East Germans broke down Monday,
however, when the companies learned that Allianz planned to
increase its stake in Deutsche Versicherungs to 51%, giving
it control of the East German insurance market, the Colonia
spokesman said. Yesterday, the group submitted its
counteroffer for a 51% stake in Deutsche Versicherungs to
East German President Lothar de Maiziere.</p>
<p>Allianz itself hasn't disclosed any intention to acquire
51% of Deutsche Versicherungs, and a spokesman at Allianz's
Munich headquarters wouldn't comment on the counteroffer.
Allianz has scheduled a news conference for this afternoon in
Munich to discuss the turn of events, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The counteroffer differs from the Allianz joint venture
agreement in one major way, the Colonia spokesman said. The
group wants to break Deutsche Versicherungs into five
regional insurance companies, with each of the five partners
taking control of one regional company. That would make the
East German insurance market more competitive than under the
Allianz plan, the Colonia spokesman said.</p>
<p>Although current plans would give Allianz and Deutsche
Versicherungs a monopoly in the East German insurance market,
East Germany will open up this sector to competition under
the economic and monetary union with West Germany on July 1,
allowing other companies to compete directly with Deutsche
Versicherungs (and Allianz) in the East.</p>
<p>But the Colonia spokesman said Allianz and Deutsche
Versicherungs would have an enormous unfair head start in
East Germany over other companies that would have "to start
from scratch."</p>
<p>West German insurers have been campaigning against
Allianz's East German agreement, and antitrust authorities in
both countries are reviewing that accord. Some West German
government officials have expressed reservations about
allowing Allianz such a commanding share of the East German
insurance market.</p>
