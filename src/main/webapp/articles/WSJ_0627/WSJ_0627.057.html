	<p class="article-leader">NEW DELHI TRAGEDY</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and forced labor have
robbed many of the boys and girls in India's capital of their
childhood, according to a new United Nations report titled
"The Invisible Child."</p>
<p>The UNICEF report said more than 500,000 children, 80% of
them illiterate and many underfed, are forced to work in New
Delhi, where the per capita income of the city's 800 million
inhabitants is about $410.</p>
<p>Child labor is only outlawed in India for certain
hazardous jobs. Many of the children are latter-day slaves,
the report said. "The children have to put up with long
working hours, eight to 12 hours a day," the report said.
"They face verbal, physical and sexual abuse from most people
who deal with them."</p>
<p>The report said a survey of parents in the slums found
that less than 5% wanted their children to stop working. They
just wanted labor conditions to improve.</p>
<p>TAIWAN'S DRIFT-NET BAN</p>
<p>Taiwan's drift-net fleet won't be allowed to operate in
the South Pacific after July 1, 1991, a government official
said. Lee Chien-chuan, director of the Agriculture Council
Fisheries Department, said the ban was in reaction to
criticism of drift nets for their indiscriminate depletion of
marine life. He said Taiwan has already cut its drift-net
fleet in the South Pacific to 24 vessels from 60.</p>
<p>SAS WANTS WEST BERLIN RIGHTS</p>
<p>Scandinavian Airlines System said it requested permission
to fly to West Berlin's Tegel Airport. Presently, only
airlines of the U.S., Britain and France -- the Allied powers
-- are allowed to fly to West Berlin. SAS, which is 50%-owned
by the governments of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, believes it
is the first non-Allied power airline to request West Berlin
landing rights since the Wall fell in November. The Swedish
Foreign Ministry applied to the French, U.S. and British
embassies in Bonn and the West German Foreign Ministry for
the landing rights.</p>
<p>THE DWINDLING RAIN FOREST</p>
<p>Brazil's Science and Technology Secretary Jose Goldemberg
said ranchers and farmers in 1988 and 1989 cut down nearly
18,000 square miles of the Amazon rain forest, the news
service Agencia Brasil reported. Mr. Goldemberg was quoted as
saying that the figures were based on satellite photos.
Separately, the European Community yesterday called for
urgent talks with Brazil on saving the Amazon rain forest
before it's all wiped out.</p>
<p>STAYING PUT IN LONDON</p>
<p>In the wake of recent announcements first by Manufacturers
Hanover Corp. and then by American Express Co. that they were
taking space in London's Canary Wharf office complex, Merrill
Lynch & Co. said it has decided against taking 240,000 square
feet in the 4 billion ($6.91 billion) development on the
north bank of the Thames. A Merrill official in New York
explained that flagging conditions in London's financial
market persuaded the securities firm to remain in its present
London quarters. Canary Wharf, an Olympia & York Developments
project, is now about half rented.</p>
<p>APPEAL TO TOKYO</p>
<p>Japan's Federation of Economic Organizations, a powerful
group of business leaders, called on the government to lift
restrictions on rice imports as one way to ensure the success
of the so-called Uruguay round of multilateral trade
negotiations. Despite strong pressures from the U.S., Japan
has steadfastly refused to abolish the ban on rice imports,
claiming that rice-farming has a special status in Japan. In
the past, the federation indicated that the government should
allow some rice imports, but it made its position clearer
this time by saying there should be no sanctuary in trade.</p>
<p>A POLITICAL POLL IN FRANCE</p>
<p>French business executives generally lack confidence in
President Francois Mitterrand and favor two outsiders, rather
than established party leaders, as future presidential
candidates, according to a poll published yesterday in the
newspaper Le Figaro.</p>
<p>The survey of 800 executives said only 42% of the
respondents expressed confidence in Mr. Mitterrand. By
contrast, 64% expressed confidence in Premier Michel Rocard,
but he trailed Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, as the person whom the executives would most like
to see play a major public role.</p>
<p>Mr. Delors also was the executives' choice to be the next
Socialist candidate for president, backed by 43% of the
respondents compared with 38% for Mr. Rocard and 7% for the
president of the National Assembly, Laurent Fabius.</p>
<p>The first choice for joint candidate of France's two main
rightist parties was Lyon Mayor Michel Noir.</p>
<p>POSTSCRIPTS . . .</p>
<p>Italy's Benetton family has agreed to sell to the Credito
Romagnolo bank its 15% shareholding in Banca del Friuli,
Credito Romagnolo announced. The value of the sale was put at
about 164 billion lire ($133 million). . . . French Labor
Minister Jean-Pierre Soisson plans to propose a 2.5% increase
in the country's minimum wage at a regular government cabinet
meeting today, Labor Ministry officials said. The increase,
if ratified, would put France's gross minimum wage at
5,285.09 francs ($937) a month.</p>

<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>NEW DELHI, INDIA, has an estimated population of eight
million. The figure was incorrectly stated in yesterday's
edition.</p>
