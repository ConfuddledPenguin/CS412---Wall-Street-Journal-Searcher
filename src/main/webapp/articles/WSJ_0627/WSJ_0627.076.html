	<p class="article-leader">MERIDEN, Conn. -- Cenvest Inc. shares lost 21% of their
value as the bank holding company said it expected a
second-quarter net loss, reflecting the addition of $13.2
million to its reserve for possible losses on bad loans.
   Cenvest's directors also omitted the second-quarter
dividend.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company made the additional loan-loss provision after
the Connecticut Banking Department and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. reviewed two of the company's subsidiaries,
Central Bank and First Central Bank.</p>
<p>Like many Northeast bank companies, Cenvest has been
jarred by a weak real estate market. The company, which had
been paying out 12 cents a share as a quarterly dividend on
its about 3.9 million shares outstanding, also plans to
charge off $4.5 million of loans from its current reserves.</p>
<p>In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Cenvest's
stock dropped $1.25 to $4.75 a share.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 1989, Cenvest earned $865,000, or
22 cents a share. Cenvest said that its primary capital at
March 31 was 8.64% of its assets and it doesn't expect that
figure to change after the addition to loan-loss reserves.
The company complies with the Federal Reserve Board capital
requirement, a spokeswoman said.</p>
