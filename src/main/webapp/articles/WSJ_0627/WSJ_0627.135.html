	<p class="article-leader">BONN -- With German monetary and economic unification
rolling ahead at top speed, the West German government
proposed a full political merger by mid-December.
   In a "discussion paper" drawn up by Bonn's Interior
Ministry, the West Germans proposed that the two Germanys
unite formally the day after all-German elections are held.
Such a vote seems likely Dec. 9 or Dec. 16.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>On Sunday, the West German mark will become the official
currency in East Germany under a treaty designed to integrate
the two nations' economies. Among many other measures, the
agreement also includes a plan for harmonizing tax systems
and introducing Western-style unemployment insurance in the
East. The next step is to negotiate a treaty on political
unity. The discussion paper is supposed to smooth the way for
the dialogue.</p>
<p>The two nations have agreed to synchronize their efforts
with international negotiations aimed at sorting through the
"external aspects" of unity, such as military orientation. At
talks in East Berlin last week, the Soviet Union -- which
takes part in the talks with the two Germanys, the U.S.,
France, and Britain -- sought to slow the rush toward
integration.</p>
<p>By stepping up the pace of political-unity talks, Bonn is
putting pressure on these negotiations to yield early
results.</p>
