	<p class="article-leader">HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. -- In a move to secure a broader
market for its cars in the auto rental industry, Chrysler
Corp. said it agreed to acquire Dollar Rent A Car Systems
Inc. Terms weren't disclosed.
   Dollar is the third rental-car company Chrysler has
purchased within the past year. But with a world-wide fleet
of 80,000 cars and annual revenue of $600 million, Dollar is
nearly twice as large as Thrifty Rent-a-Car System Inc.,
which the auto maker bought last year for $264 million. Last
year Chrysler paid $40 million for Snappy Rental Inc.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts viewed the move as part of the continuing trend
by auto makers to buy rental companies, which purchase
millions of vehicles annually for their fleets. "It makes
perfect sense if you can capture your biggest customer," says
Charles H. Finnie of Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. in Baltimore.</p>
<p>Chrysler officials said they intend to boost their share
of Dollar's fleet from the current 25% level. While Dollar
franchisees have the right to buy vehicles from any auto
maker, a Dollar spokeswoman said: "We think we have the
ability to structure deals that make it better for them
{franchisees} to buy cars from Chrysler than from somebody
else."</p>
<p>Chrysler isn't alone in this buy-the-customer approach to
protecting high-volume buyers from rival companies. Ford
Motor Co. has put money into Hertz Corp. and Budget Rent A
Car Corp. General Motors Corp. has done the same with Avis
Inc. and National Car Rental System. Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
of Japan yesterday completed its acquisition of Value Rent A
Car Inc.</p>
<p>Chrysler, however, has had some problems making the
strategy work smoothly. Just two months ago, Chrysler
officials surprised the rental market by allowing Thrifty to
purchase a large block of cars from Mitsubishi Motors.
Chrysler officials said they wouldn't force Thrifty to
purchase Chrysler vehicles that were higher priced than those
supplied by Mitsubishi.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Chrysler spokesman called the Mitsubishi
decision an isolated incident, not an indication of a retreat
from the rental fleet sales business.</p>
<p>Chrysler said it isn't planning to merge Dollar with the
operations of its other rental car agencies, Thrifty or
Snappy Rental Inc. The three companies now give Chrysler a
presence in three different segments of the rental industry.
Snappy specializes in the business of providing replacement
vehicles for people who require them mostly as a result of
insurance coverage after an accident.</p>
<p>Dollar has rental facilities in airport terminals, rather
than at nearby off-airport locations out of which Thrifty
operates. Eight of 10 Dollar customers are business
travelers, while less than half of Thrifty's customers rent
vehicles for business purposes.</p>
<p>"Dollar will continue to operate independently under its
existing brand names," the company said in a statement. The
auto maker will acquire Dollar through Pentastar, its
subsidiary that also owns Thrifty and Snappy. Henry J.
Caruso, Dollar's president and owner, will be retained by
Chrysler as a consultant.</p>
<p>Mr. Caruso, who will not maintain an equity interest in
Dollar, founded the company in 1966 as a single rental car
outlet.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, Chrysler closed at $15.75, down 37.5 cents.</p>
