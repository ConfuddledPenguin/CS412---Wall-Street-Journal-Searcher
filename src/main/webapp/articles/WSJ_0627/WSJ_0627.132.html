	<p class="article-leader">PRINCETON, N.J. -- Laurance S. Rockefeller, who majored in
philosophy at Princeton University, donated $21 million to
his alma mater for a center to study and teach human values.
   Mr. Rockefeller, a 1932 graduate, called the donation "the
fulfillment of my Princeton education," and a
"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity" to help provide training
embracing "an understanding of the relationship of mind, body
and spirit" to basic values and a sense of well-being.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Princeton University Center for Human Values is
scheduled to open this fall. It will offer interdisciplinary
undergraduate courses and graduate seminars in ideas and
issues relating to religion, philosophy, ethics, history,
politics and the sciences. It will also sponsor discussions
and lectures and help finance research projects. The center
initially will include at least six new endowed faculty
positions.</p>
<p>The idea for the center evolved after the 1988 inaugural
speech of Princeton's President Harold T. Shapiro, in which
he said a modern university should give students "an ability
to engage in the moral discourse required to give greater
meaning to our national life."</p>
<p>Traditional university divisions can make it difficult to
examine the ethical issues that range across society,
Princeton officials said.</p>
<p>Mr. Rockefeller, a son of John D. Rockefeller Jr., has
devoted much of his time and money to conservation issues;
previous donations to Princeton have helped fund dormitories,
a residential college and a molecular-biology laboratory.</p>
