Boston-based Healthco International Inc. that it is
nominating seven candidates to Healthco's board in connection

stockholders to remove Healthco's current board and replace
it with its own nominees.</p>

efforts to explore possible alternatives to maximize
shareholder value.</p>
<p>Gemini said it is nominating Kenneth W. Aitchison, Bernard
J. Hale, John K. Looloian, Robert E. Mulcahy III, Emanuel R.
Pearlman, Mary C. Webster and George A. Zurkow.</p>
