	<p class="article-leader">Mitsubishi Motors Corp. of Japan plans to export its
U.S.-made, four-wheel-drive Eclipse car to Europe, a
spokesman said.
   The Eclipse is produced by Diamond Star Motors Corp., a
joint venture between Chrysler Corp. and Mitsubishi that
began operations in Illinois in September 1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Shipments of the model are expected to start in next
spring. Focusing on nations in Europe with relatively
moderate barriers to car imports, the company plans to export
200 Eclipse models a month to Switzerland, Austria and
Sweden. Another Mitsubishi spokesman said the car will have
60% local content, adding that the company's exports to
Europe also will contribute to lowering the U.S. trade
deficit. Sales of the Eclipse in the U.S. market in 1989
totaled 32,000 units, the company said.</p>
