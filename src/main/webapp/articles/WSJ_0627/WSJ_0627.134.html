	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The International Monetary Fund next week
will increase its interest charges on more than $30 billion
in loans outstanding to 9.65% a year from a current 8.85%,
according to IMF officials.
   This action, they explained, will be required under a
"burden-sharing" agreement approved by the IMF's
policy-making interim committee in May.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Through higher charges on its regular loans and a
reduction of interest payments to the U.S. and other creditor
nations, the IMF intends to build up a special $1.2 billion
"pool" over several years. The "pool" would support efforts
of borrowing nations with overdue IMF loans to repay these
credits and regain eligibility for IMF financial assistance.</p>
<p>The higher charges won't apply to certain IMF loans, such
as its credits to poorer Third-World countries, primarily
sub-Saharan African nations.</p>
