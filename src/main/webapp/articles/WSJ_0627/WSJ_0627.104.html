	<p class="article-leader">Kaufman & Broad Home Corp.'s fiscal second-quarter net
income fell 24% to $15.1 million, or 46 cents a share, on a
35% increase in revenue.
   In the year-ago period, the home builder and commercial
real estate developer posted net income of $20 million, or 57
cents a share. The latest quarter, ended May 31, includes a
$300,000 gain from the sale of land, compared with $5.5
million a year ago.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Excluding the effect of land sales, the company said in
Los Angeles that its second-quarter net would have dropped
10%. Revenue in the latest quarter rose to $349.8 million
from $260 million.</p>
<p>The profit decline reflected lower profit margins in
California's weakened housing environment, partially offset
by strong revenue and earnings contributions from the
company's French commercial and residential development
activities in the Paris area, said Bruce Karatz, president
and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>For the six months, net income fell 10% to $28.5 million,
or 86 cents a share, from $31.5 million, or 98 cents a share.
Revenue climbed 49% to $665.8 million from $445.9 million.</p>
