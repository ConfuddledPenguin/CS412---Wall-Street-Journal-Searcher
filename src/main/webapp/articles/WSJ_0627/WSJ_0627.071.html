	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A new possible suitor for Ultimate Corp.
emerged as FNIC disclosed that it holds 8.4% of the
computer-systems concern and is considering an acquisition.
   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in
Washington, FNIC said that its decision hinges on further
study of Ultimate, taking into consideration a poison-pill
anti-takeover measure Ultimate adopted in April.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>FNIC's decision also would take into account factors such
as the availability of financing and the "attitude and
action" of Ultimate's board, the filing said.</p>
<p>Based in Midvale, Utah, FNIC has operations, investments
and joint ventures in management information services, data
processing, software development, and related technology
companies.</p>
<p>Ultimate Chairman Michael O'Donnell said there has been no
discussion between the two companies, and Ultimate "hasn't
been contacted" by FNIC.</p>
<p>FNIC purchased 749,578 Ultimate shares from May 22 to June
4 for $6.50 apiece, all in private transactions. The company
paid for them with notes bearing a 9% interest rate and a
Sept. 30 due date. In New York Stock Exchange composite
trading yesterday, Ultimate's shares rose 50 cents to $7.625.</p>
<p>Other investors who have indicated interest in acquiring
Ultimate are Norman Elowitz, who runs Honey Fashions, a
women's apparel concern in Manhattan; and Theodore Sabarese,
founder and former chairman of East Hanover, N.J.-based
Ultimate.</p>
<p>Mr. Elowitz, who was unavailable for comment, recently
raised his holding in Ultimate to 8.42% and reiterated his
desire to acquire the company. In February, Ultimate rebuffed
a $10-a-share, or $95 million, takeover proposal from Mr.
Elowitz.</p>
<p>Late last month, Mr. Sabarese told the SEC that he didn't
think he'd be able to garner financing for a purchase of
Ultimate. After settling a claim in a personal filing he made
under bankruptcy laws, Mr. Sabarese said he held less than 1%
of Ultimate's shares. Mr. Sabarese couldn't be reached for
comment.</p>
<p>For the year ended April 30, Ultimate reported net income
of $125,000, or one cent a share, compared with a net loss of
$13 million, or $1.32 a share, in the year-earlier period.
Revenue rose 4.9% to $209.7 million.</p>
