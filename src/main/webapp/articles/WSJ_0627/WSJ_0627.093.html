	<p class="article-leader">CareerCom Corp., blaming a sharp decline in its
truck-driver school enrollments, said it expects to report a
loss for the third quarter ending Saturday, June 30, and for
the second half ending Sept. 30.
   The anticipated losses weren't quantified. For the three
months ended June 30, 1989, the company reported net income
of $300,518, or three cents a share, on revenue of $36.1
million. For the 1989 fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, the net
loss was $8.1 million, or 79 cents a share, resulting in a
loss for the full year of $7.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>CareerCom of Lemoyne, Pa., an operator of various training
institutes, has been unpopular with investors in recent years
because of its erratic performance. Last year's results
included pretax charges of more than $12 million related to
buy-outs of employment contracts and stock of several
officers and directors.</p>
<p>CareerCom said the truck-driver school enrollment decline
was linked to federal funding cutbacks that took effect in
January. In recent weeks, however, the company said
enrollments have rebounded somewhat, raising the prospect
that earnings performance might improve.</p>
