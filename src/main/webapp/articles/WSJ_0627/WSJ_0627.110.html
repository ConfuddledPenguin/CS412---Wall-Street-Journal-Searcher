	<p class="article-leader">General Development Corp. said in Miami that bankers
approved a $14.5 million credit facility for its water and
waste water unit, General Development Utilities.
   The real estate development company, which filed for
protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code in April, said the loan will enable its water
and sewerage utility to operate outside of bankruptcy. The
loan is from a consortium of banks led by Bank of New York,
NCNB Corp. and Barclays PLC.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>General Development said $2.5 million of the utility's
credit facility will be used for working capital and $12
million for capital expenditures. It said the utility will
now be able to pay $2.5 million in property taxes to various
counties where its plants are located.</p>
<p>General Development also said St. Lucie County in Florida
assumed operation of General Development Utilities'
facilities in that county as the result of a condemnation
action. St. Lucie deposited $45 million with the state court
as a deposit on the assets. General Development said $38
million of those funds will eventually be used to pay off its
existing bank debt, $23 million of which applies to the St.
Lucie facilities.</p>
