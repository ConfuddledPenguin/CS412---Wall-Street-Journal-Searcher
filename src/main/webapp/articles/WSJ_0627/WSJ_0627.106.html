	<p class="article-leader">Turner Broadcasting System Inc., Atlanta, said its board
proposed to triple the total of authorized Class A shares to
75 million and double authorized Class B shares to 300
million.
   The cable television programmer, in its proxy statement
for its July 23 annual meeting, said that if holders approve
the measure, none of the additional authorized shares would
be issued immediately, but would become available for
issuance as stock dividends or for other purposes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At March 31, Turner Broadcasting had 22.8 million Class A
shares and 26.9 million Class B shares outstanding. Class A
shares hold five times more voting power than Class B shares.</p>
<p>The company said the board is seeking the authorization
increases in both classes of stock, because boosting one and
not the other could alter Chairman Ted Turner's ownership
stake, and thereby nullify a number of shareholder agreements
contingent on Mr. Turner's current stake.</p>
