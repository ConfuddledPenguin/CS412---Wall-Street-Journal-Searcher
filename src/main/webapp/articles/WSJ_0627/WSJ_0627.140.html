	<p class="article-leader">BUENOS AIRES -- Telefonica de Espana S.A. and Bell
Atlantic Corp. of the U.S. probably won the bidding for the
state telephone company Empresa Nacional de
Telecommunicaciones, or Entel, newspapers reported Tuesday.
   The bids were opened Monday and the winners will be
announced Thursday.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the privatization plan, Entel is being broken into
two companies, one covering the northern half of Argentina
and one the southern half. The government is selling 60% of
each company. Telefonica, Spain's state-controlled
telecommunications monopoly, submitted the highest bids for
both companies, the Public Works Ministry confirmed.</p>
<p>But after Telefonica chose the southern Entel company,
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic raised its bid slightly for
the northern firm, as allowed in the bidding terms.</p>
<p>In all, the 60% of the two Entel concerns that was sold
fetched $214 million in cash, as well as obligations to
assume $5 billion in debt and accompanying interest payments,
and to pay an additional $379 million in cash over six years.</p>
<p>Shares in the two new companies amounting to 10% will be
given to employees. The remaining 30% will be offered on the
Buenos Aires Stock Exchange.</p>
