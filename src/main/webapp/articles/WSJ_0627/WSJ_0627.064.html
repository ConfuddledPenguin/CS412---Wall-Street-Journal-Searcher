	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s former chairman
Peter A. Cohen has reached a severance pact with Shearson
that will pay him $10 million or more in salary and benefits,
people familiar with the agreement said.
   The pact -- which includes some unusual provisions
regarding future liability of Mr. Cohen's former bosses and
their families -- ends one of Wall Street's most difficult
executive divorces.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Five months ago, Mr. Cohen was ousted as Shearson's
chairman and chief executive officer as part of a major
shake-up orchestrated by the firm's parent, American Express
Co. Because of his high profile, and the bitterness
surrounding the financial problems of the U.S.'s
second-biggest brokerage firm, Mr. Cohen's departure and his
private severance negotiations with his former employer have
drawn intense interest on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Shearson officials have wanted to get Mr. Cohen's
departure behind them so the firm -- which is in the process
of changing its name back to Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. --
can go forward and recover from nearly a year of management
and financial turmoil.</p>
<p>But the 43-year-old Mr. Cohen won't be going away soon. As
part of the agreement, he will remain a Shearson "consultant"
until March 1991 and remain on the firm's payroll until the
end of November 1991, with a secretary and office paid for by
Shearson. This setup allows Mr. Cohen to receive the rest of
certain company benefits to which he's entitled, according to
Shearson officials.</p>
<p>Even by Wall Street standards, the financial terms of Mr.
Cohen's severance pact are eye-openers.</p>
<p>Mr. Cohen worked for Shearson for nearly 20 years and
amassed a large and intricate web of holdings of Shearson and
American Express securities. All these holdings had to be
unwound.</p>
<p>According to the people familiar with the agreement, much
of the $10 million or more Mr. Cohen will be paid represents
the resolution of complex stock and options agreements he
had; about $2.6 million of the pact represents severance pay,
and that basically offsets loans Mr. Cohen owed to Shearson
as part of a stock-purchase program. The ultimate value of
Mr. Cohen's package isn't yet certain. Depending on how his
securities holdings are valued, and other variables, he could
receive closer to $15 million, some people familiar with the
pact said.</p>
<p>Gary Beller, American Express general counsel, said in a
statement that the settlement is "fair and equitable" and
recognizes Mr. Cohen's contributions to Shearson for nearly
20 years. "We wish him well in his future endeavors," the
statement said. American Express and Shearson wouldn't
comment further.</p>
<p>Mr. Cohen declined to comment. His attorney, Stanley
Arkin, wouldn't discuss the terms of the agreement, but said
in a statement: "The matter was resolved in a way which
appropriately recognizes Peter's many years of significant
contributions to Shearson Lehman Hutton. Peter is a talented,
energetic executive who looks forward to new adventures and
accomplishments in the years to come."</p>
<p>In Shearson's latest annual report, the firm took the
unusual step of devoting a full page to its former chief,
including a small photograph of him. "Our strengths" in
brokerage and investment banking, the annual report says,
"are, in large part, the result of Peter's vision and
leadership."</p>
<p>Privately, however, American Express and its chairman,
James D. Robinson III, have blamed much of Shearson's
problems on what the company portrays as Mr. Cohen's
overreaches -- including his acquisition of ailing E.F.
Hutton & Co. for $1 billion in 1988 and Shearson's failed
role in the RJR Nabisco Inc. takeover. Some friends of Mr.
Cohen's say some American Express board members wanted to use
the severance negotiations to punish the former Shearson
chief.</p>
<p>It's clear that relations between the departed chief and
his former bosses aren't good. American Express's board,
which handled the negotiations, brought in former Iran-Contra
prosecutor Arthur Liman to represent it. And Mr. Cohen hired
Mr. Arkin, who has handled two prominent cases that caused
headaches for American Express. (Mr. Arkin represented banker
Edmond Safra, the victim of a smear campaign by certain
American Express employees, and Salim B. Lewis, who pleaded
guilty to manipulating a stock offering by Fireman's Fund
Corp., then an American Express unit.)</p>
<p>Included in Mr. Cohen's severance pact, according to
American Express executives and others familiar with it, are
a series of legal "releases" in which Mr. Cohen is prevented
from suing all directors and officers of American Express and
Shearson, as well as their families.</p>
<p>Legal experts were surprised by the extra provision
protecting the families of Mr. Cohen's former bosses.</p>
<p>Speaking generally, Thomas Russo, a partner at Cadwalader,
Wickersham & Taft, said: "It is somewhat unusual to go beyond
the parties involved {in release provisions}. I've never seen
it, actually. But remember, severance agreements are
individually negotiated. They're not cookiecutter
agreements."</p>
<p>He added: "People want freedom from liability. And the
liability issue is often a very important part of any
negotiation because people just want to totally sever the
relationship and don't want to worry about subsequent
lawsuits."</p>
<p>Some securities executives speculate that the release
provisions in Mr. Cohen's pact are partly to protect Mr.
Robinson's wife, Linda, a well-known public relations
official who played a major behind-the-scenes role in the RJR
takeover efforts that eventually soured for Mr. Cohen and
Shearson. (RJR was taken private in a record $25 billion
leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., which was
a rival of Shearson in the RJR takeover battle.) It is
believed that Mr. Cohen resented Ms. Robinson for what Mr.
Cohen saw as attempts by her to undermine his position at
Shearson both during the RJR fight and at other times.</p>
<p>Ms. Robinson yesterday wouldn't comment on the severance
agreement. But she denied she was out to get Mr. Cohen. She
said she stood by a quotation in a recent interview in Vanity
Fair magazine, in which she said: "The story that I wanted
Peter Cohen to take the fall-that theory is pathetic and
implausible. My husband was defending Peter Cohen. I only
rooted for Peter Cohen to succeed, for his failure would only
have hurt Jim."</p>
<p>Mr. Liman, the American Express lawyer, said the
wide-ranging releases involving family members were "my idea"
to prevent any future lawsuits. "It was an idea the board
authorized," Mr. Liman said, "because given the kind of
history of press accounts, I felt very strongly that I didn't
want to work out a severance agreement that had releases only
to have litigation by proxy. There was going to have to be
universal peace."</p>
