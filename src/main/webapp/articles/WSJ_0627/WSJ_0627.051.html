	<p class="article-leader">While Congress and the courts have been worrying
themselves about flag-burning, Seventh Avenue has been
turning versions of Old Glory into socks.
   Also bikinis and evening gowns, sweaters and wristwatches.
Even Barbara Bush wrapped herself in the flag -- a stars and
stripes scarf -- at her husband's inauguration. And nobody
seemed to give a hoot.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Times change, along with fashion. And Abbie Hoffman must
be turning over in his grave.</p>
<p>Not so long ago, wearing clothes that looked like flags --
or that were made from flags -- brought forth an immediate
incendiary reaction.</p>
<p>The National Society Daughters of the American Revolution
forced a stars-and-stripes girdle off the market in 1965,
calling it a "shocking caricature" of the flag. Three years
after that, Mr. Hoffman, the Yippie activist, was arrested
for wearing an American flag shirt. The ensuing flap created
a renegade fashion trend that has now returned in a more
benign, apolitical form, as designers pledge allegiance to
Old Glory's bold graphics. What goes around comes around.</p>
<p>Why just a few days before the House of Representatives
last week voted down a proposed constitutional amendment
prohibiting the burning and desecration of the flag, Saks
Fifth Avenue, with patriotic zeal and in time for Flag Day
June 14, advertised a flag-patterned shirt: "New Glory. A
salute to casual. . . ." New York shoppers snapped up 50 of
the shirts, at $57.50 each, the first day of the promotion.
The shirt looks a lot like the Hoffman original.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoffman, after his arrest in 1968, wore the infamous
apparel on "The Merv Griffin Show" and, in so doing, launched
the fashion trend the first time around. TV viewers didn't
actually get to see the shirt because CBS blacked out the
video just as Mr. Hoffman unzipped his jacket to show it off.
The Vietnam War era censorship gave the shirt instant cachet,
and impetus to sales of flag shirts across the land. It also
firmly linked flag fashion with the counterculture. Kids wore
flag patches on the seats of their jeans.</p>
<p>At least one flag-wearer had his day in court. In 1970, a
Canadian named Valarie Goguen was arrested on Main street in
Leominster, Mass., for wearing jeans that had a small U.S.
flag sewed to the seat. At his arrest, Mr. Goguen insisted
that he hadn't intended to make a political statement. He
claimed that he used a toy flag to patch a hole in his pants.
But a jury convicted him of violating Massachusetts flag laws
and sentenced him to six months in jail.</p>
<p>Four years later, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned his
conviction, saying the Massachusetts law "fails to draw
reasonably clear lines between the kinds of nonceremonial
treatment that are criminal and those that are not."</p>
<p>"The flag is a focus in this country for political
expression and social attitudes," says Whitney Smith, a
well-known flag expert, or vexillologist, and director of the
Flag Research Center in Winchester, Mass. "When there is some
national crisis or celebration, people want to express that
sentiment," he says.</p>
<p>The flag is "unabashedly red, white and blue, fervidly
starred and striped," said designer Donald Brooks during the
first wave of flag fashion.</p>
<p>Now, more than two decades later, it's the establishment
that plunks down $300 for Ralph Lauren's limited-edition
sweaters with 23-star-flag replicas emblazoned across the
chest. And Perry Ellis sells $2,000 cashmere stoles -- huge
replicas of the flag, but in gray, brown and beige. Marc
Jacobs, who designs for the label, has also used the Old
Glory look on sequined dresses and says he does so with
feelings of reverence. "It's a pride thing for me," he says.
"The American Flag is an icon, and I'm an American designer."</p>
<p>Today's fashion isn't protesting anything. Designers mean
no disrespect, quite the contrary. And they haven't incurred
the wrath of the current anti-flag-burners even though the
U.S. Flag Code of 1942, as amended, clearly states that the
American flag is not to be used as apparel, bedding or
drapery.</p>
<p>Congress last year passed the flag protection law that
this spring was overturned by the Supreme Court. It defined
the thing to be protected as "any flag of the United States,
or any part thereof, made of any substance of any size, in a
form that is commonly displayed." The definition didn't
completely eliminate the confusion that exists about when a
piece of fabric is a flag to be protected and when it is a
tank top to be worn to the beach.</p>
<p>Fashion designers, no constitutional lawyers, clearly
believe that they are within their rights to use flag motifs.
Then, too, there's a general feeling that if you can burn the
flag, you can surely wear one.</p>
<p>Even supporters of the ill-fated flag amendment aren't
sure where to draw the line. "If someone takes two flags,
sews them together and makes them into a poncho, we have a
problem with that," says John Minnick, a spokesman for the
American Legion.</p>
<p>But since most flag-fashion isn't made of real flags, Mr.
Minnick doesn't generalize. "I don't know, we'd have to see
the item of clothing first. . . . But if it is done in a
disrespectful manner that holds the American flag up to
ridicule, I can tell you flat out we are opposed to that," he
says.</p>
<p>The DAR, which still distributes free copies of the flag
code, also isn't doctrinaire about flag fashion. Says the
DAR's president-general, Marie Yokum: "It's a sticky thing
that gets more complicated."</p>
