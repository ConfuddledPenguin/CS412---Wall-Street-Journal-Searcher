	<p class="article-leader">The analysts who so hotly debated the nuances of the murky
abortion decision that the Supreme Court handed down Monday
seem to lose that subtlety when they confront the abortion
views of the American public. In the seven months since
pro-choice candidates defeated their pro-life opponents in
Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races, columnists from
coast to coast have cited the pro-choice "majority" as though
the matter is settled. National Abortion Rights Action League
executive director Kate Michelman coined the conventional
wisdom in the wake of last year's pro-choice election
victories: "If you're out of touch with the pro-choice
majority, you're out of office."
   That's a nice soundbite, but surveys show public opinion
is considerably more complex and ambivalent, not just on the
morality of abortion, but on its legality as well. A
two-thirds "pro-choice majority" can be shown to exist only
when abortion is framed broadly as an issue of personal
freedom.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>When asked whether abortion should be allowed by law in
various specific circumstances, a majority of Americans says
that in many cases it should not be. And the cases where
Americans would restrict abortion -- when the woman's chief
reason for abortion is that the potential child would grow up
without its father, or that it would strain the woman's
financial resources, or disrupt her career, education or
relationship with the father -- comprise the vast majority of
abortions that are performed in the U.S.</p>
<p>In June 1989, shortly before the Supreme Court's
restrictive decision in Webster v. Reproductive Health
Services, a CBS/New York Times survey asked whether abortion
should be "legal as it is now," legal only in extreme cases
(rape, incest or threat to the life of the woman) or entirely
illegal. Some 45% of the adults interviewed favored the
status quo, but 39% favored allowing abortion only in the
extreme cases and another 12% favored outlawing it
altogether.</p>
<p>That 51% majority for sharp restrictions dropped by three
points in a post Webster survey of the same respondents a
month later, creating a 48-48 split between those who favored
the status quo and those who favored restrictions. In its
written analysis of the poll, CBS heralded similarly
near-equal splits on two other questions about abortion as
"evidence of movement towards a more pro-choice consensus."
But this "consensus" proved short-lived: The percentage
favoring sharp restrictions bounced back to a 53-43 advantage
in a CBS/Times poll two months later.</p>
<p>The most specific questions about abortion have been put
in a series of surveys by KRC Communications Research, which
polls for the Boston Globe and the San Francisco Examiner. In
a KRC survey last year, before Webster, majorities said that
abortion should not be legal in cases where the grounds for
it are economic or emotional strain, an uncooperative or
absent father or the woman's sense that it is the wrong time
in her life to have a child. Five months after Webster, KRC
found a rise in pro-choice sentiment. A bare plurality
(statistically a tie) now favored legal abortion when the
woman's reason was that she could not afford to bear a child,
but majorities still opposed it when the grounds cited were
the father's absence or unwillingness to help raise the
child.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania and Idaho, the two states whose legislatures
passed extensive abortion restrictions in the wake of Webster
(Idaho's legislation was vetoed by Gov. Cecil Andrus), have
been depicted in the media as exceptional pro-life bastions.
But last December, when KRC asked voters across the country
whether they would like their states to adopt laws similar to
Pennsylvania's, an overwhelming majority said yes. This year,
KRC found that 48% of Americans would approve of their state
adopting a law similar to the Idaho bill that "outlaws
abortion except in the cases of rape, incest, profound fetal
deformity or if the life of the mother is threatened," while
only 43% would oppose it.</p>
<p>The point is not that there is a pro-life majority. That
conclusion would be no more accurate than the converse.
Indeed, when confronted with KRC's national finding on the
Idaho restrictions, pro-choice activists rightly noted that
if the phrasing of the question were changed, the results
would probably change as well.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most revealing approach is to let people state
their views on abortion in their own words. Just after
Webster was handed down, American Viewpoint, a Republican
polling company, asked voters to name "the one thing you
would like your state representative to keep in mind when
discussing and voting on" abortion. The most frequently cited
theme in the responses was a woman's right to choose,
mentioned by 36%. Overall, 54% offered pro-choice answers.
But the share of respondents who gave one anti-abortion
response or another, plus those who stressed that abortion
should be legal only in certain cases, totaled 48%. (The
total exceeded 100% because some responses covered two
themes.)</p>
<p>Linda DiVall, who directed the American Viewpoint survey,
noted that pro-choice sentiment formed a large, ready-made
bloc, while the anti-abortion responses were diffuse. Pulling
the latter group together while minimizing the focused
hostility of the former group is no doubt an uphill battle
for a pro-life candidate. But if a pro-life candidate could
hold all his potential supporters together, the voters would
apparently split almost evenly. This is why pro-choice
activists avoid debating specific restrictions, according to
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who works for pro-choice
groups.</p>
<p>Pro-choicers who resist acknowledging voters' ambivalence
should be reminded that one-dimensional images of public
opinion hurt their cause too. Consider: The abortion
restrictions most likely to be approved by state legislatures
in the wake of Webster are not outright bans, but tighter
regulation of abortion clinics. The media have widely
reported polls that purport to show that large majorities
would favor laws to require parental consent, viability
testing, a pre-abortion waiting period and a full briefing of
the woman on options other than abortion. But last July CBS
found that when these restrictions are described collectively
-- as "laws that would make it difficult for private clinics
to perform abortions" -- a majority opposes them. Isn't the
latter finding as significant as the former?</p>
<p>Rather than discrediting each other, these snapshots of
public opinion, taken from different angles, can combine to
flesh out a multidimensional image of public opinion. Recent
CBS polls illustrate this nicely. Last fall nearly 70% of
adults agreed with the statement, "even in cases where I
might think abortion is the wrong thing to do, I don't think
the government has any business preventing a woman from
having an abortion." In the same survey, a bare 48% plurality
agreed that "abortion should be available for those who
really want it, but it should not be easy to get." In
November, when asked which of three statements best expressed
their views, 41% chose to say abortion should be "generally
available," and an opposite 15% felt it "should not be
permitted," but 42% chose positions favoring legal abortion
with "stricter limits" than the status quo.</p>
<p>The result is a triply qualified hypothesis: Two-thirds of
Americans believe abortion generally should be decided by the
woman, but most think it should not be allowed in the less
severe circumstances; and despite widespread reluctance to
enforce the law in such cases, about half want barriers to
discourage women whose motives are less than compelling.
That's a lousy soundbite, but a good stab at what the public
really thinks.</p>
