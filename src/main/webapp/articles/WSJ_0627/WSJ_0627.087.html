	<p class="article-leader">TUCSON, Ariz. -- Tucson Electric Power Co. said Charles E.
Bayless was named president and chief executive officer of
the troubled utility, effective next Sunday, and announced
the placement of $96 million of first-mortgage bonds in a
major step toward its financial restructuring.
   Mr. Bayless, 47 years old, succeeds Thomas C. Weir, 56,
who assumed the top job in July 1989. Mr. Weir will remain on
the board and will help oversee the liquidation of the
company's investment subsidiary assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Bayless joined Tucson Electric as senior vice
president and chief financial officer in December 1989, and
has been deeply involved in the utility's refinancing
efforts. He previously had served as chief financial officer
of Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, the first major
utility in 50 years to seek bankruptcy-law protection, and
holds degrees in electrical engineering, business and law.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Bayless said the private placement of
$96 million of first-mortgage bonds with institutional
investors will help the utility focus on firming up its
short-term credit lines and seeking higher revenue through
rate increases and the wholesale power markets. The company's
subsidiaries have sold off about $180 million in marketable
securities in recent weeks, he added.</p>
<p>The company will meet with bankers later this week to
begin negotiating an anticipated $300 million credit facility
that "should give us the financing to go for several years,"
Mr. Bayless said. In addition, the utility plans to submit a
regulatory request for an estimated 10% rate increase in
August.</p>
<p>The mortgage bonds, placed through PaineWebber Inc., carry
an interest rate of 12.22% and mature in 2000. Proceeds will
be used for construction and working capital.</p>
<p>Last month, Tucson Electric officials had raised the
possibility of a bankruptcy filing if various financing plans
were unsuccessful. In 1989, the company reported a loss of
$82.1 million, or $3.55 a share, on revenue of $593.7
million.</p>
<p>Mr. Weir and John P. Schaefer, the company's chairman,
were thrust into those posts last year following the abrupt
resignation of Einar Greve, the utility's top executive, amid
a barrage of bad news. The company has been plagued by excess
generating capacity throughout the Southwest as well as ill
effects from its diversification into areas including thrifts
and real estate.</p>
<p>Edward J. Tirello Jr., an analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., called Mr. Bayless's appointment a "very prudent
move," because of his financial background and his experience
with the troubled New Hampshire utility. Mr. Tirello said the
company probably will have to request additional rate boosts
of 5% to 6% a year over the next few years. He expects the
company to report a loss of perhaps $2 to $3 a share for the
year, and an additional loss for 1991.</p>
<p>The company's shares closed yesterday at $11.375, up 25
cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.</p>
