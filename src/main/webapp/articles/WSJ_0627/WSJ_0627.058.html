	<p class="article-leader">Reading anything wider than Reader's Digest on a plane
these days probably means jabbing a seatmate with your elbow.
Airlines, trying to squeeze more profit out of each flight,
are squeezing most passengers into tighter, narrower seats.
   "The No. 1 complaint is the ever-shrinking economy-class
seat," says Michael Ashington-Pickett, publisher of
Ashington-Pickett Airlines and Travel Reports, a travel
newsletter that surveys executives who fly frequently. Mr.
Ashington-Pickett's readers rank "tight, cramped seating"
miles above other annoyances such as flight delays, high
fares or bad food.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"People are uncomfortable, miserable and complaining about
it," he says.</p>
<p>There's a basis for their complaints. Even as the U.S.
population in general, and middle-aged baby boomers in
particular, develop broader backsides, airlines have had
aircraft makers chop seat widths -- typically to about 19
inches now from the 22 inches provided for many years -- as
well as make aisles narrower, to get in more seats. Pitch,
which is the seat spacing front-to-back, has been scrunched
in some cases to 31 inches from 34 inches, meaning there's
less legroom, too.</p>
<p>"I think we are bumping up against some absolute
body-dimension limits right now," says Ed Perkins, editor of
Consumer Reports Travel Letter. "They're offering 90% of the
necessary room" for comfort, he claims. Safety's a concern,
too. Passenger advocates and flight attendants say the close
space impedes classic emergency procedures, such as assuming
the standard "crash" position.</p>
<p>Carriers say they must pack in passengers to stay in
business. Deregulation of the industry and lower fares
created slim profit margins, making every seat count. "The
name of the game is how many people you can get into the
airplane," says John Casey, a vice president at industry
consultant Avmark Inc. "Yield for the carrier means its
survival or not."</p>
<p>Airlines weren't especially forthcoming about the coziness
in their cabins, with most simply stressing that they are
within industry standards. Delta Air Lines, which Consumer
Reports Travel Letter's August 1989 issue shows offering
especially cramped space on most of its planes, says it isn't
getting complaints from customers.</p>
<p>"We've had an excellent passenger service record," boasts
a Delta spokesman. "If we were jamming people in, I don't
think that would be the case."</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins says that may only mean that, in airline and
government surveys, fliers are asked about service overall
and not about seats specifically. Besides, he says, most
passengers don't know that airlines are to blame for the
skimpy seating. "People don't realize that seat size is
controllable by the airline," he says. "They think it just
comes from Boeing that way."</p>
<p>Boeing Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. and other aircraft
makers follow the orders of airlines, which want more seats.
Some Boeing 747s have been reconfigured to 10 seats abreast
from nine; McDonnell Douglas's DC-10 now often has nine seats
across, up from eight.</p>
<p>As for questions on safety, Kathleen Rosenauer, a
spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association that represents
all major U.S. airlines, points out that carriers are
required to meet standards set by the Federal Aviation
Administration. "There's no way we would configure an
aircraft that didn't meet FAA standards," she says.</p>
<p>The industry's "high-density" strategy actually began in
the mid-1970s before deregulation, as a response to wild
fluctuations in oil prices and jet fuel costs. As passengers
were squeezed more and more, airlines demanded innovations
from their manufacturers to reduce discomfort, such as
thinner, firmer cushions, thinner armrests and curved seat
legs.</p>
<p>But airplanes fly 60% to 80% full these days -- another
byproduct of deregulation -- and chances are that passengers
will sit shoulder-to-shoulder with another traveler.
(Shoulders, say U.S. Army studies, as well as hips, are
getting wider.) It has become more difficult to disguise the
crunch.</p>
<p>"They treat us like we can't tell the difference,"
complains Michael Turner, who flies about twice a week as
chief operating officer for Restaurant Administration
Services, a Wendy's International franchisee based in
Orlando, Fla. The 50-year-old executive says he plans to
avoid carriers that "squeeze us like cattle. I'm going to
vote with my dollars."</p>
<p>A few airlines are accommodating passengers tired of being
squeezed by other carriers: They have turned spacious seating
into a marketing tool. Alaska Air Group's Alaska Airlines
touts two inches more legroom in its economy class than the
industry average. American Airlines, on its planes flying the
highly competitive Los Angeles-San Francisco route,
guarantees a 36-inch pitch. Midwest Express, which flies out
of Milwaukee, offers 25-inch-wide leather seats and a 34-inch
pitch on all planes. And the airlines say prices on these
routes are still competitive with those of carriers with
denser seating.</p>
<p>Passengers with the wherewithal can buy comfort on almost
any flight. "The guy who pays the most gets the most room,"
says A.J. Merrett, commercial director of Aircraft Furnishing
Ltd., a British seat supplier for Boeing and others.
First-class and business-class seats, typically much more
costly, are also roomier.</p>
<p>People who can't pay extra are requesting aisle seats more
than ever. "Businessmen used to want the window so they could
work," says Eileen Umhoefer, president of Spirit of Travel
and a Denver travel agent for 30 years. "Now they always want
the aisle," which is her preference as well.</p>
<p>Other cramped passengers develop methods of coping. Ali
Atif, a 6-foot-2, University of Houston student, pulls his
legs back by balancing his feet on his toes in order to fit
into his seat. He admits the maneuver is useless, however,
when the passenger ahead of him reclines.</p>
<p>Sometimes nothing works. Carolyn Riviere of Orlando
remembers her flight last December from Spokane, Wash., to
New Orleans. She and her husband, who is blind, had, as
usual, settled into two outer seats so he could have the
aisle, when an extremely large woman sat beside the window.</p>
<p>"Her body was in my seat, I'd say by about a third," says
Mrs. Riviere. "I couldn't pull down my armrest because it was
behind her shoulder." Mrs. Riviere wrote the stewardess a
note, with no results. After ordering a glass of wine, she
couldn't reach her purse to pay, all three were lodged in so
tightly.</p>
<p>In the July 1989 crash landing of a United Airlines DC-10
in Sioux City, Iowa, some tall passengers couldn't assume a
bent-over, braced crash position because there wasn't enough
space, says Richard Livingston, chairman and chief executive
of the Airline Passengers Association of North America. Mr.
Livingston also contends that closely placed seats can hamper
evacuation. (United Airlines says it doesn't think it's
appropriate for an individual carrier to comment on a safety
matter.)</p>
<p>"We believe that the trend should be reversed," Mr.
Livingston says, so "that instead of holding pitch steady or
decreasing it, we should be increasing it." His organization,
a consumer group, plans to file a petition with the FAA on
the dangers of tight seating. More room, he says, would
"enhance the evacuation process and enable far more
passengers to assume the crash position." The Association of
Flight Attendants, a union, has already formally written to
the FAA requesting action to require more space at exits.</p>
<p>An FAA spokesman asserted that in the Sioux City crash,
all of the passengers would have been able to assume a
secondary crash position, which basically can be done by
leaning forward on the seatback ahead. The agency believes
the alternate position is as safe as the bent-over one
preferred by consumer groups.</p>
<p>The FAA requires airlines to demonstrate that a plane can
be evacuated within 90 seconds, even with half the exits
blocked. It also regulates aisle widths and access to exits
but has never specifically tested the size or placement of
seats in relation to safety.</p>
<p>Mr. Perkins from Consumer Reports professes "serious
concerns as to whether the seats are so terribly close
together as to impede evacuations." Although all aircraft are
tested by the FAA every year, Mr. Perkins says these tests
can't account for passengers' panic. "Your mental attitude is
different when you're sitting in smoke and there's a fire
roaring 10 feet behind you," he notes.</p>
<p>"The test isn't intended to simulate panic or any specific
accident scenario," an FAA spokesman says, but the agency
feels the test is "conservative" because of other criteria,
like the blocked exits, that are considered in an evaluation.
He adds that the FAA is studying "possible improvements with
regard to access to exits."</p>
