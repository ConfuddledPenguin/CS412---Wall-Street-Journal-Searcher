	<p class="article-leader">One of the most revealing meetings in the current flurry
of consultations to remap Europe took place at Brest-Litovsk.
Mikhail Gorbachev's foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze,
conducted a long and private discussion there on the future
of Germany with the West German foreign minister,
Hans-Dietrich Genscher. That the Soviet statesman chose this
particular site to host his colleague is an ominous sign. In
1918, Brest-Litovsk was the place where Russia and Germany
designed the separate peace that laid the foundation for more
violence in this century. A new "Brest-Litovsk" portends a
new -- and dangerous -- Soviet-German relationship.
   The visible collapse of communism and American concern
about "helping" President Gorbachev in his hour of need seem
to have caused us to forget some important history. We are
overlooking the long story of Russian -- and then Soviet --
expansion, the special relationship between Russia and
Prussia, and, after 1871, with united Germany. Russia and the
Soviet Union have been major factors in the European and the
world balance of power since the time of Peter the Great.
Like Britain, Russia often changed allies. Bismarck said
Russia was a "mastodon" and had to be handled carefully.
While Germany was Austria's ally, Bismarck cultivated a
"Reinsurance Treaty" with Russia in order to protect
Germany's rear in case of trouble with Britain or France.
After Bismarck was dismissed by Wilhelm II in 1890, the
Kaiser let the Reinsurance Treaty lapse. The Kaiser's
decision was an important factor in the tragedy of 1914.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ambivalent connection between Russia and Prussia was
manifest at many other critical moments. The Hitler-Stalin
Pact, which set off World War II, was not an aberration. The
first agreement concluded at Brest-Litovsk had these
consequences: Russia made a separate peace with Germany at
the expense of its allies. Seventy German divisions were then
shipped to the Western front for the great German offensive
of 1918 -- if America had not entered the war, Germany surely
would have won. After the war, Lenin invited the Germans to
train officers and build planes and produce other munitions
secretly in Russia. Mr. Shevardnadze even had the gall
publicly to underline the significance of the meeting place,
in case any Western foreign office missed the point.</p>
<p>Against this background, how should we view Mr.
Gorbachev's unresolved difference with President Bush about
the future of Germany? Is Mr. Gorbachev really driven by
anxiety about a possible attack by a non-nuclear Germany
against the Soviet Union, a nuclear superpower?</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev's effort to neutralize Germany is consistent
with another and far more plausible hypothesis: That whatever
his subjective intentions may be, the natural consequences of
the policy he proposes would enable the Soviet Union to
snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. It would give Mr.
Gorbachev what NATO, for the past 40 years, has prevented: A
neutral and indefensible Central Europe open to Soviet
domination. Such an outcome would soon prove an irresistible
temptation to an ambitious Soviet ruler. What is at stake in
Mr. Gorbachev's bold gamble is nothing less than the future
of the world balance of power and the outcome of the Cold
War.</p>
<p>For more than 40 years, this has been the principal goal
of Soviet strategy. Soviet proposals of this kind have been
put forward with depressing regularity ever since the Soviet
leaders rejected America's Baruch Plan for the international
control of nuclear energy in 1946. The Rapacki Plan is the
best known of Soviet "peace" plans. It was offered in 1957
and is often revived. It proposed to establish a nuclear-free
zone comprising both Germanies, Poland and Czechoslovakia --
a zone where nuclear weapons could not be manufactured,
stored or used.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Soviet Union offers the Western Allies a
non-aggression pact as well as a proposal for
denuclearization and neutrality. Secretary of State Dean
Acheson said about one early ploy, "we already have a
non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. It is called the
Charter of the United Nations and nothing should be done to
qualify the force of its generality." The non-aggression pact
Mr. Gorbachev has recently dangled before Western eyes hardly
represents new thinking. It should be rejected out of hand.</p>
<p>The most striking change Mr. Gorbachev has brought about
in Soviet foreign policy is to make European neutrality an
immediate and urgent objective, rather than a distant and
theoretical hope. In this perspective, Mr. Gorbachev's
decision not to use force to suppress the revolutions in
Eastern Europe becomes intelligible. Such an attempt would
have postponed and perhaps ruined his efforts to obtain
economic help from the West. And it might well have provoked
civil disorder at home; desertions and mutiny by his own
troops on a much larger scale than the defections of Soviet
troops in Hungary in 1956; and even NATO intervention. Was it
perhaps Mr. Gorbachev's conclusion that it was better for him
to allow East Europe to go free, and then trump the Western
ace by neutralizing the whole of Europe, East and West
together?</p>
<p>A neutral Germany, a country of 85 million people, would
destroy NATO, force the U.S. to withdraw from Europe to
Fortress America, and leave Britain, France, Italy, Spain,
Turkey and the smaller countries of Europe incapable of
self-defense. The American nuclear guaranty would lose all
credibility. Without American backing, the British and French
nuclear forces would remain too small to deter the Soviet
Union, which would then be the only major nuclear power in
Europe. Western Europe would be "Finlandized" -- a neuter in
world politics. The U.S. could no longer mobilize allied
coalitions to help deal with crises like those in Korea, the
Persian Gulf or the Middle East.</p>
<p>With or without Japan, a helot Western Europe would be the
inevitable milch-cow of Soviet economic recovery. No scenario
for the future could be more threatening to the U.S. than the
modernization of the Soviet Union in partnership only with
Germany or with Western Europe as a whole rather than with
the Western nations as a group.</p>
<p>Given Mr. Gorbachev's overwhelming need for Western
economic help and the turbulence of Soviet society, no such
eventuality can materialize if Western policies are even
moderately rational. But concerted and active allied
diplomacy will be required to counter Mr. Gorbachev's bid.
But there is no sign as yet that the West has even
contemplated a policy commensurate with the situation.
Instead, the Western nations seem willing to help the Soviet
Union piecemeal, without obtaining any quid pro quo in
return.</p>
<p>Many believe that the problem isn't serious because if the
Soviet Union becomes capitalist, it will no longer be
expansionist. But capitalism doesn't always bring peaceful
democracy. Take Germany, which was extremely capitalist both
in 1914 and in 1939. So was Japan. Popular governments in
pluralist societies have committed aggression in the past,
and dictatorships have been peaceful neighbors. Arms control
agreements, improvements in human rights, the adoption of
multiparty elections and a market economy, however desirable
in themselves, should not be regarded as a sufficient
consideration for Western economic cooperation on the scale
that will be required. Peace is a separate matter.</p>
<p>At the moment, the key question is whether a united
Germany should continue to be a member of NATO or withdraw.
If Mr. Gorbachev's goal is peace, it is as much in Moscow's
interest as ours that Germany remain firmly anchored in the
West. This is not a subject on which Mr. Bush can compromise.</p>
<p>After what we had to endure since 1945, it would be
unimaginably foolish for the U.S. and its allies to help
Russia modernize and enlarge its fantastic military
capabilities without insisting on a clear end of the Cold War
and the achievement of real peace -- not a new detente, a
"modus vivendi", or a wary cooling off period, but a regime
of genuine peace.</p>
