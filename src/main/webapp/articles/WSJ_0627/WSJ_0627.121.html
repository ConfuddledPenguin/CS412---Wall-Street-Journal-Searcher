	<p class="article-leader">Adam Opel AG, the big West German operating unit of
Detroit-based General Motors Corp., said its 1989 profit more
than doubled to 1.12 billion marks ($669.5 million) from 505
million marks a year earlier.
   Sales increased 19% to 20.81 billion marks from 17.46
billion marks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Describing its performance as "absolutely the best results
in the history of the company," Opel predicted further growth
this year. "Taking into consideration 1989's results, plus
the numbers from the first half of 1990. . ., we assume that
we can conclude 1990 with better results than in 1989,"
Ferdinand Schwenger, chief financial officer, said.</p>
<p>Opel said it held 17.8% of the West German domestic car
market in May. For this year's first five months, the company
estimated it boosted its West German market share on average
to about 17% from 16.1% in 1989. Opel officials said they see
this rise translating into 1990 sales growth of more than
10%, to an indicated total of about 23 billion marks.</p>
