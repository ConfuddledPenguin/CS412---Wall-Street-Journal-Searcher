	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade said it submitted
plans for futures contracts based on auto and health
reinsurance policies to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission for regulatory approval.
   Exchange officials said the proposed contracts were
designed to allow insurers in the U.S. and abroad to hedge
against losses on the policies they write in these areas.
Less risk for insurers could also mean lower insurance costs
for individual policyholders, the exchange said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Insurers currently try to reduce their risk of losses on
outstanding policies by giving a portion of the premium paid
on a policy to a company known as a reinsurer, who in return
shoulders a portion of the risk.</p>
<p>Insurers, some of whom could see their profit margins
squeezed if the contracts are widely used, haven't rushed to
embrace the proposed contracts, which were unveiled by the
exchange last month. Insurance regulators say they haven't
yet seen details of the contracts, and are taking a
wait-and-see approach before passing judgment.</p>
<p>Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said, "the
insurance markets represent a huge financial sector that
currently has very limited ways by which to manage its
considerable risk." Premiums for U.S. auto and health
insurance totaled $130 billion in 1987, the last year for
which data are available, said exchange economist Gerg
Samorajski.</p>
<p>The value of the cash-settled contracts will be based on
the difference between insurance premiums collected and
claims paid on a group of insurance policies over a fixed
time span.</p>
<p>As the three-month term for each futures contract
concludes, reinsurance certificates will be issued to the
remaining holders of contracts. The certificates will be
redeemed for the net premium earned or lost about four months
later, "when virtually all claims will have been paid," the
exchange said.</p>
<p>Exchange officials said it may take as long as six months
for approval. A potential launch date for the contracts,
assuming they will be approved, hasn't yet been set.</p>
<p>Burton Gutterman, an exchange director involved in
developing the contracts, said the exchange's "phones have
been ringing off the hook" with questions from insurance
companies about the proposed contracts. For the next several
months the exchange will be trying to "educate" insurers on
why the contracts would benefit them, he said.</p>
<p>The Board of Trade said it wants to pick as many insurers
as possible to participate in providing policies to be
included in the insurance pools underlying the contracts. No
company has yet signed up to participate.</p>
<p>Because insurance companies are regulated at the state
level, most insurers wanting to trade the futures contracts
will have to seek approval from state regulators. Peter
Kelly, Connecticut insurance commissioner, said he had yet to
receive any information on the contracts. The issue came up
at a meeting of state insurance regulators in Baltimore
earlier this month, but none of his compatriots from other
states had any information, either, he said.</p>
