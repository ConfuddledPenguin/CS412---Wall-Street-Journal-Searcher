	<p class="article-leader">Store shelves may be bare in many East Bloc countries, but
consumers there know what they like: Sony, Adidas and
Mercedes-Benz.
   Those names ranked high with consumers in a survey of
brand awareness in Hungary, Poland and the Soviet Union.
American brands, including Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Pepsi,
ranked high in terms of pure name recognition. But they
lagged in perceived quality, falling below many European and
Japanese brands, according to the survey conducted by Landor
Associates, an image consulting firm based in San Francisco.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>To gauge consumer preferences, Landor interviewed 1,500
shoppers, 500 each in the three countries. All were 18 or
older, and lived in urban areas. Consumers were asked which
brands they recognized on a list of 400 trademarks, which
included names from Japan, Western Europe and the U.S.
Shoppers were then asked how highly they regarded those
brands. Combining the familiarity and esteem scores, Landor
then ranked the brands by "image power."</p>
<p>Eastern Europeans know far fewer brands than the average
American, who is familar with a dizzying 1,800 trade names.
But considering that Eastern Europeans have little first-hand
experience with the brands they cited -- and scant exposure
to advertising -- they're a surprisingly brand-conscious lot,
the survey found. Hungarians proved the most worldly
shoppers, recognizing an average of 250 of the 400 brand
names. Poles were less brand conscious, distinguishing about
175. The average Soviet shopper, however, could pick out only
100.</p>
<p>Although incomes are skimpy and basic consumer products
scarce, big-ticket items such as autos and electronics topped
the wish lists of East Europe's shoppers. But not just any
cars: Mercedes-Benz ranked among the top 10 brands in all
three countries. "When you have nothing, you dream big
dreams," said Don Casey, president of Landor.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps you dream of playing soccer. Adidas, the brand
of athletic shoes and sportswear, ranked in the top five of
all three countries. A spokesman for the German company
attributed the powerful showing of Adidas to the simple fact
that the company has done business in those countries for
several decades.</p>
<p>American companies that managed to penetrate the East Bloc
early also fared relatively well. Although Coke outsells
Pepsi by a margin of 2-to-1 in international markets, the
Pepsi-Cola brand handily outranked Coke in the Soviet Union.
Pepsi was introduced there 16 years ago; Coke is a relative
newcomer to the East Bloc.</p>
<p>Overall, however, Landor executives expressed surprise at
consumers' strong appreciation of Japanese brands, and dismay
at their relative lack of regard for U.S. goods. In an
international survey conducted by Landor in 1988, consumers
ranked Coke the world's most powerful brand. But the mighty
soft drink ranked 14th in the Soviet Union, 17th in Poland
and a mere 24th in Hungary.</p>
<p>And while Eastern Europeans found many U.S. brands
familiar, they found few of them illustrious. McDonald's, for
example, was the best-known brand in Hungary, where it
operates three restaurants. But Big Mac ranked No. 40 in
terms of esteem. In the Soviet Union, where a McDonald's
restaurant in Moscow serves as many as 50,000 customers a
day, the company was the 12th best known, but ranked 17th in
terms of esteem.</p>
<p>"We're still new to these markets," said a McDonald's
spokesman. "We think the quality perception will improve when
more people have a chance to try the product."</p>
<p>Then again, it is difficult to compare the quality of a
luxury car with a soft drink or a hamburger.</p>
<p>Marketing consultants and officials of the companies whose
brands were tested found little cause for alarm in the
results, which they shrugged off as pop research. Some
critics questioned the survey's value to marketers, since few
of the consumers questioned could actually recognize the
products they say they admire -- let alone afford them. "If
Mercedes or Jaguar have a great awareness level, that's
good," said Clive Chajet, chairman of Lippincott & Margulies
Inc., a New York image and identity consultant. "But since
they equal years of salary, what's its commercial value?"</p>
<p>U.S. products fared much better than their Eastern
European competitors -- which were almost entirely absent
from the lists. Aeroflot, the Soviet Airline, did show up in
the rankings, but not without qualifications. Soviet
consumers ranked their airline the nation's best-known brand,
but in esteem ranked it 35. Hungarians found the Soviet skies
even less friendly. They ranked Aeroflot 92 in terms of
recognition, 210 in esteem.</p>
