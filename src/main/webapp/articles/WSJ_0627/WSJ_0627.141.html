	<p class="article-leader">Precious metals futures gave up most of Monday's price
gains.
   August gold closed at $352.90, off $3.30 an ounce. July
silver settled at $4.8250 an ounce, down 0.3 cent. October
platinum settled at $485.70 an ounce, down $1.90.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Prices were boosted Monday by news that South Africa's
central bank has been intervening to support the gold market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, silver performed relatively better than gold or
platinum, according to Don Tierney, metals analyst at Stanley
B. Bell & Co. in New York, because some precious metals
traders decided silver was a buy. But July silver had to fall
below its 12 1/2-year low of $4.7620 -- the contract traded
as low as $4.7350 -- before buying developed.</p>
<p>"I can't believe this silver price -- it just seems so
attractive, especially when you realize that the last time it
was in this area was in December 1977," Mr. Tierney said.</p>
<p>Mr. Bell said many metals traders are turning from gold to
silver because they are tired of getting slammed in the
overnight gold market. "Three times in the last few months
they have awakened to the news that gold is down anywhere
from $6 to $20 an ounce," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Bell pointed out that the number of gold contracts
remaining to be nullified by opposite trades or fulfilled by
delivery of the metal is only 9,000 more than in silver,
narrowed from a differential of 40,000 contracts a month ago.
He said he expects ultimately to see this so-called open
interest in silver exceed that in gold when the commodity
funds that are holding large short positions take their
profits in gold. "I expect them to roll out of gold and into
the silver market," he said.</p>
<p>Larry Heim, publisher of the Heim Investment Letter in
Portland, Ore., said yesterday's action in the silver market
was positive.</p>
<p>"The move to under $4.76 cleaned out all the stop-loss
orders that might have been placed by not-very-determined"
buyers, he said. Such price action, he said, bodes well for a
possible short-term turnaround in silver prices and perhaps
even a major move higher.</p>
<p>William O'Neill, futures analyst at Merrill Lynch Futures
in New York, said the focus in the gold market now is on cash
bullion. He said the sell-off in gold would have been worse
if the dollar hadn't eased in the afternoon; gold and the
dollar typically move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>As for gold-producing countries supporting gold prices,
Mr. O'Neill said: "It would be naive to expect South Africa
or the Soviet Union to engage in any long-term campaign to
support gold. These countries are so currency-starved that
long-range support is out of the question."</p>
<p>But although ultimately their need to sell the metal will
far outweigh any support they can possibly give the market,
he said, such producer intervention probably did help to halt
the market's slide temporarily.</p>
<p>However, Mr. O'Neill said, the market is still in an
erosion mode. "On rallies we have lower highs and on
sell-offs lower lows," he said. He said the one bright spot
has been some investment buying from the Far East, but in
general, investment buying has been absent.</p>
<p>Platinum seems to be in a bullish supply/demand situation,
according to Mr. O'Neill, but it can't rally independently of
gold.</p>
<p>He said he is considering a "spread" trade in which he
would buy two October platinum contracts and sell one October
gold contract to act on his expectation of platinum
outperforming gold. But he said he won't initiate this trade
until the price premium of platinum over gold narrows to
about $115 a ounce from $126 currently.</p>
<p>In other commodity markets yesterday:</p>
<p>GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices closed mixed in relatively
subdued trading. Soybean and corn futures for July delivery
closed slightly lower, reflecting many traders' belief that
Monday's rally wasn't totally supported by forecasts of hot
weather spreading across Midwestern growing areas this week,
said Steven Freed, a futures analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. Short-covering by commodity funds,
or the buying of contracts to offset those sold earlier in
anticipation of continued price declines, accounted for a
significant portion of the Monday rally, Mr. Freed said. July
soybean futures closed 4.75 cents a bushel lower at $6.08 a
bushel after gaining 13.25 cents a bushel Monday. July corn
futures slipped 1.25 cents to close at $2.8575 a bushel after
a five-cent gain Monday. Wheat futures for July delivery on
the Chicago Board of Trade bucked the trend and gained half a
cent a bushel to close at $3.34. Analysts said that corn and
soybean prices are likely to rise and fall in step with
Midwestern temperatures for the next several weeks.</p>
<p>ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices drifted lower in
extremely light trading. The New York Mercantile Exchange
estimated volume at only about 54,000 contracts, resulting in
a sluggish session as traders apparently decided to hold
tight ahead of the weekly report of U.S. petroleum
inventories due from the American Petroleum Institute late
yesterday. The August crude contract lost 24 cents a barrel
to close at $17.14. Later months were lower as well. Even
gasoline, which in recent sessions has seemed immune to
crude's declines, fell. July unleaded gasoline contracts lost
0.95 cents a gallon to end the session at 61.32 cents.</p>
<p>COPPER: Prices drifted lower in a continuation of Monday's
sell-off. The July contract settled at $1.0835 a pound, down
0.55 cent. Release of a London Metal Exchange report showing
supplies down 375 metric tons was a non-event, analysts said.
Stocks at New York's Commodity Exchange warehouses rose 1,140
tons to 18,801 tons. Mr. O'Neill of Merrill Lynch noted that
in London the premium of spot copper over metal to be
delivered in three months is now $16 a metric ton, narrowed
from $50 a few months ago. The narrowing "reflects that the
demand for immediate copper is falling," Mr. O'Neill said, as
well as indicating heavy selling by copper merchants. Mr.
O'Neill said the copper market is drifting because there are
few reports due out this week. He added: "Though the mid-June
car sales were not good, I didn't think they were all that
bad. I think we may be near a bottom for those numbers."</p>
<p>COTTON: Prices continued fluctuating wildly. The old-crop
July contract settled at 86.31 cents a pound, up 1.54 cents,
while the new-crop December contract fell 0.30 cent to close
at 74.25 cents. Ernest Simon, cotton specialist at
Prudential-Bache Securities in New York, said there still
isn't much cotton from last year's crop available for
delivery. "Tuesday was the second day in which sellers could
give notice that they intend to deliver cotton," he said. "So
far, there have been no delivery notices." He said the July
contract is being driven up by traders who have sold
contracts in anticipation of lower prices and now must go
into the market to buy the contracts back. A few holders of
long positions in the July contract, he said, are probably
foreign countries who want cotton to meet current needs and
are holding onto their contracts until some short-seller
delivers physical cotton to them. However, he said, even the
rally in new-crop cotton has been explosive. "Seven times in
June the new-crop month of December has made new contract
highs," he said, attributing the rally mainly to hot and dry
weather in Texas. "Weather in other cotton-growing regions
has been good, with the crop coming along nicely," according
to Mr. Simon. He said the market is also being propelled
upward by commodity funds that use trend-following techniques
and buy a commodity when certain technical indicators show
prices to be in a general uptrend.</p>
