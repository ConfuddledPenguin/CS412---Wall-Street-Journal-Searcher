	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- In the latest in a series of courtroom reversals
for federal banking regulators, a federal judge here ruled
that several agencies acted illegally in closing some of
Texas American Bancshares Inc.'s banking units last year.
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge Barefoot Sanders faulted
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., among others, for
repaying only a fraction of funds owed by Texas American's
lead bank to 13 solvent affiliates after regulators closed
the lead bank last July.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The incomplete repayment caused a chain reaction of
failures in the otherwise solvent banks, allowing the FDIC to
complete a previously negotiated sale of Texas American's
entire bank network to a Dallas investor group.</p>
<p>But Judge Sanders held that, because some non-affiliated
creditors of the lead bank received 100 cents on the dollar
owed them, the FDIC's action violated a 19th century banking
law requiring that all creditors of a failed bank be treated
equally.</p>
<p>"The facts of this case indicate an . . . egregious use of
the FDIC's extensive (but not unlimited) powers by
manipulating the recovery of affiliated banks on the
obligations owed to them in order to make those banks
insolvent as well," he wrote.</p>
<p>The FDIC's liability in the case is minimal: As part of a
negotiated settlement of various legal disputes with Texas
American, the agency had already agreed to pay no more than
$5 million if Judge Sanders ruled against it.</p>
<p>What's more, Judge Sanders' ruling probably won't have any
impact on future bailouts becauses the 1989 Financial
Institution Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act gave
regulators expanded power to favor one group of creditors
over others.</p>
<p>The ruling represented a particularly stinging rebuke to
the FDIC, coming, as it did, in the wake of several other
court decisions against banking regulators.</p>
<p>Just last week, for example, a federal bankruptcy judge
here ruled that the FDIC can't use a $1 billion claim against
First RepublicBank for voting purposes when creditors decide
the fate of the company's plan to emerge from bankruptcty
court proceedings.</p>
<p>Mark Rosen, a deputy general counsel for the FDIC, said
the agency was "disappointed" by the ruling and is likely to
appeal.</p>
<p>The decision, if upheld in other cases stemming from past
bailouts, could wind up costing the government hundreds of
millions of dollars. For example, First RepublicBank Corp.,
which lost its 40-bank network in a 1988 federal bailout with
strong parallels to Texas American's, has asserted that 35 of
its banks failed through so-called "manufactured
insolvencies." The Dallas bank holding company, which isn't
related to First Republic Bancorp of San Francisco, claims
that those banks were worth almost $1 billion before they
were sold to NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C.</p>
