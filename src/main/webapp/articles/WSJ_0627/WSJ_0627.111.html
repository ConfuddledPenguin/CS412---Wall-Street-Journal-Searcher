	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Many top executives blame the lagging
quality of American goods and services on a lack of
commitment from workers rather than on themselves, according
to a new poll.
   Philip Crosby Associates Inc., a Winter Park, Fla.,
consulting firm that specializes in workplace-quality issues,
released a Gallup poll showing that chief executive officers
acknowledge America's problems with quality. But the
consulting firm said that executives are wrongly denying
their own responsibility for the problem.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>According to the Gallup survey of 401 chief executive
officers of U.S. companies, 62% said lack of managerial
attention doesn't affect quality, 70% said pressure for
short-term profits isn't a quality problem and 20% admit that
manufacturing speedups hamper quality. Almost 300 of the
chief executives run companies with sales of more than $75
million a year, said George Gallup, the pollster's
co-chairman.</p>
<p>Lance Arrington, president of Philip Crosby, said it's
good that U.S. top executives are no longer reluctant to
admit that foreign competitors are doing a better-quality job
than they are. But he warned, "When executives look only to
the work force, only to those people who discover the defect
. . . they are ignoring the fact that the real problem most
likely rests somewhere back up the line, perhaps too close to
senior management decisions for comfort." Mr. Arrington, a
former ITT Corp. executive, said he and his firm have
counseled many U.S. and foreign companies on quality
training.</p>
<p>Contrary to the views expressed in the Gallup poll, lack
of management attention, a drive for short-term profits and
manufacturing-speed demands have a crucial negative effect on
quality, Mr. Arrington said.</p>
<p>While most executives don't seem to realize it, "{quality}
is often impaired by all of these three pressures a
significant portion of the time," Mr. Arrington said.</p>
<p>Mr. Arrington's views tend to jibe with the conclusions of
the Commission on Skills of the Workplace, a 35-member group
formed by a former unit of Carnegie Corp. The commission last
week issued a report saying, in part, that corporate
management needs to reorganize the workplace in ways that
give workers more authority, while training them better, to
improve product quality and productivity.</p>
<p>The Gallup survey confirms "the overwhelming need for
management to educate, train and instill a commitment to
quality . . . from the executive suite to the production
floor," Mr. Arrington said. He estimated that as much as 40%
of companies' service-oriented effort is wasted because it
involves correcting poor-quality work or planning for
expected defects.</p>
<p>Nearly half of the poll respondents who have
quality-improvement programs developed them in the past four
years, but too many of them use "less than effective"
methods, the consultant said.</p>
