	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush gave new life to the moribund
budget talks by eating his "no new taxes" rhetoric and
declaring "tax revenue increases" are needed to shrink the
deficit.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu insisted privately
to Senate Republicans that the president hadn't said anything
new. But Mr. Bush's intended audience, top congressional
Democrats, heard the president say the words they had been
waiting for, and they pledged to begin serious negotiations
promptly toward a deficit-reduction compromise.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The president has concluded that tax increases are
necessary," said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D.,
Maine). "We share the president's view."</p>
<p>The president's comments came in a statement the White
House released after Mr. Bush hosted a two-hour breakfast
with congressional leaders. He said, "It is clear to me that
both the size of the deficit problem and the need for a
package that can be enacted require all of the following:
entitlement and mandatory program reform; tax revenue
increases; growth incentives; discretionary spending
reductions; orderly reductions in defense expenditures; and
budget process reform."</p>
<p>Republicans ranging from Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, a
tax foe, to Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, who has drafted
a plan that calls for higher consumption taxes, later said
Mr. Bush was simply restating what he has said previously.
But Sen. Mitchell described Mr. Bush's statement as "clear
and unambiguous" and "new and significant."</p>
<p>Congressional Democrats tried not to gloat publicly, but
privately they were jubilant that their tactic of
stonewalling in the budget negotiations produced what they
viewed as a significant concession from the president.</p>
<p>"Sometimes you're not able to get to the substance until
you cure a political problem, and only he {Mr. Bush} could
cure the political problem," said Sen. Wyche Fowler (D.,
Ga.). "The great drawbridge has been let down by the
president, and now we ought to scramble out of the castle
into the fray."</p>
<p>Summit negotiators said new deficit-reduction proposals
may surface this week, perhaps as early as today, when the
talks are scheduled to resume. House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt (D., Mo.) said House Democrats are drafting a plan
that would cut the projected deficit by $50 billion next
year. They're likely to rely on deep cuts in defense
spending.</p>
<p>The senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, Sen.
Domenici, has been circulating a $50 billion plan that would
raise taxes about $24 billion next year, cut spending on
government benefit programs, known as entitlements, about $10
billion and cut other programs.</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said there is
"a tacit understanding" among budget negotiators to reach an
agreement by mid-July. Senate Budget Committee Chairman James
Sasser (D., Tenn.) said all sides hope for an agreement
before Congress has to vote on raising the federal debt
ceiling in late July or early August.</p>
<p>Despite the new enthusiasm, negotiators are far from
agreement on exactly what taxes to raise, what spending to
cut and how to alter the budget process. Administration
officials noted that Mr. Bush stressed in his statement the
need for "budget process reform to assure that any bipartisan
agreement is enforceable."</p>
<p>"We're now on the 20-yard line," Sen Dole said. "Only 80
yards left to go."</p>
<p>Political analysts said Mr. Bush probably won't be hurt by
abandoning his memorable campaign promise. "The public
recognizes he is breaking his pledge; there is no ambiguity,"
said Democratic pollster Peter Hart. But when voters are
asked what difference that makes, Mr. Hart added, most reply:
"Hey, it really doesn't make any difference."</p>
<p>According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll last
month, 89% of Americans thought a federal tax increase was
very likely or somewhat likely. Moreover, resistance to
higher taxes seems to be waning. In April, voters opposed any
tax increases 57% to 39%. A month later, they divided 48% to
48%. And when asked in the latest survey whether they would
rather live with the current federal budget deficit or tax
increases, voters opted for raising taxes by a 49% to 43%
margin.</p>
<p>But while the president may be politically safe, other
Republicans stand to lose a valuable political weapon, and
they were showing their pain. "The White House has caved in
too quickly on tax increases," complained Rep. Chuck Douglas
(R., N.H.). With communism crumbling, Cold War rhetoric has
lost its bite, and some Republicans see the tax issue as the
most significant difference between them and Democrats.</p>
<p>Republican pollster Linda DiVall said, "This is not only
going to make some Republicans very uncomfortable, it's also
going to force some of them to draw distinctions between
themselves and the president." Indeed, Rep. Robert Walker
(R., Pa.) quickly got 90 of the 176 House Republicans to sign
a letter to the president that said flatly, "We were stunned
by your announcement. . . . A tax increase in unacceptable."</p>
<p>As long as the issue was simply whether to raise taxes,
political analysts say Republicans had a clear political
winner. But that issue is slipping away. "Someone who is
complaining about taxes being raised in the budget summit
will have to complain against both parties and the
president," said Speaker Thomas Foley (D., Wash.)</p>
<p>As the issue shifts to which taxes to raise, analysts say
Democrats may have an edge if they can succeed in painting
the president and other Republicans as reluctant to tax the
rich and eager to tax middle-income Americans.</p>
<p>Whatever the political ramifications, Mr. Bush succeeded
in getting the budget summit back on track. In their first
six weeks, the talks had accomplished nothing. Democrats were
divided, and those who distrusted the administration were
blocking progress.</p>
<p>Trying to salvage the summit, Budget Director Richard
Darman and Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady held separate
meetings last week and early this week with influential
Democrats, including Speaker Foley, Sen. Mitchell, and the
chairmen of the House and Senate tax-writing panels, Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois.
Mr. Darman also spent two hours with Rep. Gephardt yesterday.</p>
<p>All the Democrats stressed how important it was for Mr.
Bush to get personally involved, but aides said none of them
were certain what Mr. Bush would tell the congressional
leaders over the breakfast.</p>
<p>A White House official said that after an hour with Mr.
Bush, the Democrats urged the president to address the tax
issue publicly. "They said, `We want a more public
admission,'" the official said. "Bush said, `OK, let's talk
about it.'"</p>
<p>It took another hour, with occasional breaks to wait for
photocopies to be made, for the participants to agree on the
wording of Mr. Bush's statement. Each word was weighed. A
congressional source said a White House draft of the key
sentence began, "It is clear that. . . ." Democrats insisted
it say, "It is clear to me that. . . ."</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater refused to
concede that Mr. Bush had repudiated his campaign promise.
And at a meeting with Senate Republicans, Mr. Sununu argued
that Mr. Bush hadn't done anything he hadn't already done by
proposing $20 billion in new revenues in his January budget
proposal, according to New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.</p>
<p>But Sen. Domenici said of Mr. Bush's statement, "If it
helps those who did not want to proceed with negotiations,
then it has served its purpose."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush told reporters, "I'll let the statement speak for
itself." Asked why he had moved now, Mr. Bush said, "It's
essential that these talks get moving and get moving faster."</p>
<p>One Bush adviser said the president, though aware of the
political risks to Republicans, is signaling his willingness
to raise taxes because he believes "what counts most is
results." He added, "There's nothing as important to a
president as the condition of the economy . . . {and} the
huge major economic issue out there is the budget deficit."</p>
<p>Lobbyists for one pillar of the Republican constituency,
the business community, quickly rallied around Mr. Bush and
his efforts to get deficit-reduction talks going.</p>
