	<p class="article-leader">A new study bolsters the growing belief that the nation's
high homicide rate among young men -- particularly blacks --
isn't only a crime concern but a major public health problem
as well.
   Researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said
the murder rate among U.S. males from 15 to 24 years old is
more than four times higher than any other developed country,
and more than 40 times higher than in Japan and Austria.
Moreover, the homicide rate among young black men in the U.S.
is seven times higher than for young white males, and was 39%
higher in 1987 than it was in 1984.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Both the high U.S. homicide rate and the vulnerability of
young blacks are well established, but the wide differences
depicted in the study contribute to a growing urgency among
policy makers to develop strategies to address the problem.</p>
<p>"Looking at all the {data} together, they present a
startling picture that we can't afford" to ignore, says Lois
A. Fingerhut, a statistician with the CDC's National Center
for Health Statistics and lead author of the report.
"Innovative public health strategies must be developed to
reduce this loss of our nation's youth," she and co-author
Joel C. Kleinman say in the study, which is published in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.</p>
<p>Last fall, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan described the homicide rate among youth as a major
public health problem -- echoing previous federal efforts to
reduce the rate among young blacks. Earlier this year,
doctors from Harlem Hospital in New York City published a
report in the New England Journal of Medicine saying that
life expectancy among black men in Harlem was lower than that
of men in Bangladesh.</p>
<p>The homicide study, Ms. Fingerhut says, argues for
thinking about the problem much the way public agencies
approach infectious diseases. The homicide rate "is a problem
we have to solve. It doesn't have to be a fact of life."</p>
<p>The study compares the U.S. homicide rate in 1987 among
males from 15 to 24 years old with those in 21 other
developed countries. It also ranks murder rates in selected
states for blacks and whites in that age group.</p>
<p>More than 4,000 of these young men were murdered in the
U.S. in 1987, the authors say, for an overall homicide rate
of 21.9 per 100,000 population. The next highest country was
Scotland, where the rate was 5.0. In Japan, just one in
200,000 young men was murdered in 1987, according to the
report.</p>
<p>Particularly startling, however, were the wide differences
within the U.S. The homicide rate among young blacks is 85.6
per 100,000, while among whites it is 11.2. The rate among
blacks in the age group was highest in Michigan at 231.6 per
100,000. For whites, the rate was highest in California at 22
per 100,000.</p>
<p>"The overall differences {between blacks and whites} are
phenomenal," Ms. Fingerhut says. "They're beyond staggering."</p>
<p>The authors also cite FBI reports noting that the majority
of homicides in the U.S. involve victims and offenders of the
same race and who knew each other. Some 90% of black male
victims were killed by blacks, while 87% of white male
victims were murdered by whites, the study says.</p>
<p>This suggests that a plan to reduce homicides should focus
on programs to teach young people to solve personal conflicts
without violence, the authors say.</p>
<p>The study is also likely to fuel the continuing debate
over gun control in the U.S. -- 75% of murders in the U.S. in
1987 were committed with a firearm while less than a quarter
of the homicides in 21 other countries were gun-related. To
alleviate the problem, Ms. Fingerhut adds: "We clearly have
to look at the issue of firearms availability."</p>
