	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Continental Cablevision Inc. has asked CBS
Inc. to let the cable operator's local-access channel in
Concord, N.H., become an affiliate of the CBS network.
   The proposal by Boston-based Continental's New England
subsidiary points up the intensifying debate over programming
exclusivity, pitting CBS and other over-the-air broadcasters
against the cable industry. CBS declined to comment on the
request but may be likely to deny it, given the opposition of
its 200-plus affiliate stations to letting CBS programming
air on rival cable channels.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Continental Cablevision of New England Inc. proposed the
affiliation deal -- including a request that CBS pay the
cable system just as it pays local broadcast stations to air
CBS programming -- in the wake of a much broader request that
another cable operator, Denver-based Tele-Communications
Inc., made to the NBC network last week.</p>
<p>Tele-Communications asked General Electric Co.'s NBC unit
to let TCI become an NBC affiliate wherever an NBC station
doesn't now operate. But the request is viewed as a political
ploy in the debate over program exclusivity, and NBC is
expected to oppose it.</p>
<p>But H. Franklin Anthony, a senior vice president with
Continental Cablevision's New England unit, said his proposal
to CBS is a serious plan aimed at providing local news in
Concord, where a UHF affiliate of CBS had recently ceased
operations.</p>
<p>The debate over program exclusivity heats up today as a
U.S. House subcommittee takes up a cable reregulation bill.
The bill includes a provision requiring cable channels to let
their programming be carried by new rivals such as direct
broadcast satellite, or DBS. While federal law lets a cable
system carry network programming without having to pay the
networks for it, cable channels aren't required to make their
fare available to rivals.</p>
<p>A group of rural electrical cooperatives and other
entities yesterday urged the subcommittee to require cable
networks to make their programming available to new, rival
technologies. NBC is a partner in Sky Cable, a proposed DBS
service that hopes to carry cable programming if and when it
begins operating in the mid-1990s.</p>
