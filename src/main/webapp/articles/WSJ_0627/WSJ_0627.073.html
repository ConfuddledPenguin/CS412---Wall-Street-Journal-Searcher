	<p class="article-leader">SAN FRANCISCO -- A state court of appeals refused to
overturn a trial court's judgment that any prospective buyer
of Maxxam Inc.'s Pacific Lumber Co. unit must be notified
that the lumber company is encumbered by pending lawsuits.
   Los Angeles-based Maxxam has interests in aluminum
products, forest products and real estate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The ruling by an appeals court panel here in effect
upholds that of a Superior Court judge in Humboldt County,
Calif., who ruled in May that any interested buyer must be
advised that pending lawsuits challenging Maxxam's 1985
takeover of Pacific Lumber could award the property to
shareholder-plaintiffs.</p>
<p>That could make it more difficult for Maxxam to sell
Pacific Lumber, or restructure its debt related to the unit's
acquisition. Pacific Lumber, based in Scotia, Calif., is
reportedly trying to restructure its $580 million of junk
bond debt, and negotiate loans from banks and insurance
companies.</p>
<p>The takeover also became a target of environmentalists
after Maxxam chairman, Houston investor Charles Hurwitz,
doubled the rate of cutting redwoods at Pacific Lumber in
order to service the debt load.</p>
<p>David Robertson, an attorney for Maxxam, couldn't be
reached for comment on the denial of his appeal.</p>
