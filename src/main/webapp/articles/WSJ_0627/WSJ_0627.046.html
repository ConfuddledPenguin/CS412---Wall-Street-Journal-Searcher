	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Campeau Corp. said certain creditors of its
Allied Stores Corp. unit have won permission from U.S.
bankruptcy court to file a suit alleging fraudulent
conveyance.
   A fraudulent conveyance suit typically alleges that the
previous owners of a company acquired in a leveraged buy-out
committed fraud by transferring their assets in a sale, even
though the company was insolvent or was rendered insolvent by
the transaction.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Campeau said such a suit would be based on Allied's
purchase of shares in Federated Department Stores Inc.,
another Campeau unit, in May 1988 and April 1989. The
purchases gave Allied a 50% stake in Federated.</p>
<p>Allied and Federated filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in January.</p>
<p>Campeau said it could be liable to repay as much as $250
million if such a suit were successful. The company didn't
indicate whether it expects a suit to be filed. The
information was contained in a circular distributed by
Campeau ahead of its annual meeting, scheduled for July 30.</p>
<p>Representatives of the Allied creditors couldn't be
reached for comment.</p>
<p>Campeau purchased Allied in 1986 and Federated a year
later in highly leveraged transactions with a combined price
tag of $10 billion. Allied used some of the proceeds from the
sale of its Brooks Brothers and Ann Taylor divisions to
purchase the Federated shares from a Campeau subsidiary,
which in turn used the funds to pay off debt from the
Federated acquisition.</p>
<p>David Heiman, a partner with the law firm of Jones, Day,
Reavis & Pogue of Cleveland, which represents the Ohio-based
Campeau subsidiaries, said the bankruptcy court approved an
agreement between Allied and its bondholders that
"acknowledges we would not claim that they do not have
standing to bring such an action."</p>
<p>Mr. Heiman said the agreement requires the bondholders to
give 30 days' notice of their intention to file a fraudulent
conveyance suit. He said the parties also agreed not to take
any action at least until Sept. 12, 1990.</p>
<p>Separately, Campeau disclosed in its information circular
that its chairman and chief executive officer, Robert
Campeau, missed a $1 million payment on a personal loan from
Campeau Corp. that was due April 30.</p>
<p>The company said it has requested that Mr. Campeau
"propose a plan of repayment" and it "intends to pursue the
remedies available to it if necessary." It said Mr. Campeau
has $13 million in loans outstanding from the company,
including $9 million lent to Mr. Campeau during the fiscal
year ended Jan. 31, 1990.</p>
<p>Mr. Campeau also faces a deadline of June 30 to come up
with a first payment of 40 million Canadian dollars (US$34
million) to buy back Campeau shares seized from him by
National Bank of Canada after Mr. Campeau defaulted on
personal loans to the bank. Mr. Campeau hasn't indicated how
he intends to raise the money.</p>
