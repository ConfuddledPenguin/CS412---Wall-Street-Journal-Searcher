	<p class="article-leader">STAMFORD, Conn. -- Champion International Corp. said it
plans to build an $85 million de-inking facility for recycled
newspapers and magazines at one of its newsprint mills.
   Champion, a major paper manufacturer, said the facility is
scheduled to begin operating in 1992 and is expected to
recycle 145,00 tons of pulp a year, all of which will be used
to make newsprint at its mill in Sheldon, Texas.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The company said it was responding to a need for recycled
pulp by newsprint customers, as more states pass legislation
requiring newspapers to use de-inked pulp.</p>
