	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Bush administration and key senators
agreed on a compromise version of a major housing bill,
boosting prospects for Senate approval of the legislation.
   The agreement represents an important bipartisan
breakthrough, culminating three years of work to formulate a
new housing agreement. The National Affordable Housing Act is
expected to be introduced on the Senate floor today by
co-sponsors Alan Cranston (D., Calif.) and Alfonse D'Amato
(R., N.Y.).</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Staff members from the Housing and Urban Development
Department, the White House Office of Management and Budget
and the Senate Banking Committee met over the weekend to work
on the agreement. HUD Secretary Jack Kemp met with members of
the committee yesterday morning to iron out the final details
of the compromise.</p>
<p>The final proposal calls for total outlays of $18.1
billion for fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1, followed by
increases to $19.5 billion in fiscal 1992 and $21 billion in
fiscal 1993. The administration originally had asked for
total outlays considerably lower than those in the
compromise, but agreed to the higher levels in return for
concessions on other major points.</p>
<p>One of those compromises was an agreement to increase
funding for the Home Ownership and Opportunity for People
Everywhere program, a key part of Secretary Kemp's program to
provide public-housing residents with money to purchase homes
from public housing authorities. The compromise calls for
$240 million in fiscal 1991, $650 million in fiscal 1992 and
$1 billion the following year. The bill originally had
contained $435 million over the three years.</p>
<p>The higher levels represent a victory for Mr. Kemp, who
lobbied hard for the HOPE program and considered it essential
to his "urban homesteading" concept of empowering the poor to
purchase their homes, rather than rent.</p>
<p>Another crucial element of the legislation was the funding
of the Housing Opportunity Program, which would supply money
to cities and states for developing and rehabilitating
affordable housing. The new program, if accepted, would
consolidate 10 existing programs. A proposal offered by Sen.
Connie Mack (R., Fla.) would allow recipients to use HOP
funds for rental assistance through the use of vouchers, a
position that was resisted by some members of the Banking
Committee.</p>
<p>The administration compromised on the issue of new
construction of public housing units. The administration had
sought to require states and localities to match federal
funds 1-to-1, but agreed to the Senate Democrats' position of
a 2-to-1 match. Secretary Kemp had warned last week that the
bill might be vetoed because of the construction provisions,
saying he feared the possibility of profiteering from new
construction projects.</p>
<p>The accord also includes provisions to improve the
actuarial soundness of the Federal Housing Administration's
mortgage-insurance program, which is threatened by solvency
problems unless higher premiums are introduced, according to
a report done for the organization by Price Waterhouse.</p>
<p>The compromise calls for two-thirds of the closing costs
for FHA borrowers to be paid up-front, rather than financed
over the life of the mortgage. Additionally, the compromise
accepted the administration's proposal to add a 0.5% annual
risk-based premium on loans to home-buyers who make low down
payments.</p>
<p>The HUD secretary will be given discretion to make
adjustments in the premium required of FHA borrowers to
"reflect the condition of the economy," a source close to the
negotiations said.</p>
<p>Mike Ferrell, lobbyist and general counsel for the
Mortgage Bankers of America, criticized the compromise,
particularly the requirement that first-time home-buyers
provide two-thirds of their closing costs at one time. "The
net effect of this will make the FHA an insurer of last
resort," he said. "The borrowers in good markets will go with
private mortgage companies, leaving the FHA with the
high-risk borrowers." He added that the provision could knock
out 75,000 to 100,000 first-time buyers.</p>
<p>Others see the compromise as an overdue necessity. Citing
a 1989 General Accounting Office report showing default rates
of as much as 40% for low down-payment loans made in the
early 1980s, Tom Schraw of National People's Action, a
consumer advocacy group, supported the administration's
position. "If one out of three people with low down-payment
loans defaults," he said, "we don't think anyone, liberal or
conservative, can support that kind of program."</p>
