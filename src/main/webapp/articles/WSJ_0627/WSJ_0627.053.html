	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The first overhaul of federal food-labeling
rules in 17 years would allow food makers to provide
consumers with a "nutritional profile" of every serving they
eat.
   The Food and Drug Administration, as part of a major
initiative to require nutritional labels on almost all
packaged foods, is about to propose a way for consumers to
compare the nutrients in a food serving with the recommended
daily allowances for fat, saturated and unsaturated fatty
acids, salt, cholesterol, fiber and potassium.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
disclosed the proposal yesterday when he gave further details
on three food-labeling rules that are to be formally proposed
within a week or so.</p>
<p>For the first time, consumers would be able to tell from a
label what their daily intake of the seven substances should
be and what one serving of a particular food would furnish.
Though there is a growing clamor for such health-related
information, the food industry hasn't been able to provide
so-called nutritional profiles because the government has
never set recommended daily allowances for those seven
nutrients. Under the sweeping new rules, the FDA would fill
this regulatory void by setting what it calls "reference
values."</p>
<p>For food companies, adding nutritional profiles to their
labels would be optional because many food packages aren't
large enough for them. But it appears likely that a large
share of the industry would provide the profiles. A survey
commissioned by the National Food Processors Association
showed a strong consumer preference for a label format with a
nutritional profile. Of 400 consumers polled, 80% found the
nutritional profile of breakfast cereal "very helpful."</p>
<p>"Consumers should have full access to information that
will help them make informed choices about the food they
eat," Dr. Sullivan said here at a food safety and nutrition
conference. "Simply put, Americans must be helped, not hyped
or hustled, in the supermarket."</p>
<p>The HHS secretary is in a race with Congress to revamp the
nation's food-labeling requirements. Floor action is expected
next month on labeling bills sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman
(D., Calif.) and Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio). Some in
Congress believe that Dr. Sullivan, sensing the political
appeal of comprehensive food labeling, is trying to steal the
march on lawmakers.</p>
<p>Consumer advocates welcome the competition. "If Congress
adopts the legislation this summer, the FDA will be simply
one step ahead in implementing it," says Bruce Silverglade, a
lawyer for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
Washington-based consumer group. "The {parallel} efforts,
although competitive politically, are complementary in a
practical sense."</p>
<p>But Dr. Sullivan is running into resistance within the
White House. Strenuous objections from Richard Darman, the
White House budget director, thwarted the HHS secretary's
plan to publish three new regulations this week in the
Federal Register as well as a tentative final rule that would
define such terms as "cholesterol free" and "low
cholesterol."</p>
<p>The snag in the regulations is the volatile issue of
federal pre-emption.</p>
<p>The triad of rules, among other things, would require
nutrition labeling on virtually all packaged foods and would
define serving size for 159 food categories, ranging from
jelly to breads. Currently, just 61% of the food products
regulated by the FDA carry nutritional labels, many of which
are added voluntarily by manufacturers.</p>
<p>Dr. Sullivan, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and
U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills say these rules should
pre-empt state and local labeling laws. They fear that a
hodgepodge of labeling requirements would disrupt food
production and distribution in the U.S. and impede trade. But
Mr. Darman and other White House officials regard federal
pre-emption as running counter to the principles of
federalism and states' rights embraced by President Bush.
They also are sensitive to Mr. Bush's concerns about
reregulation tendencies in his administration.</p>
<p>Yet to be resolved, administration officials say, is
whether the proposed rules will be silent on federal
pre-emption or whether the FDA will seek public comment on
the issue.</p>
<p>The food industry has been adamant on the need for
regulatory uniformity. "Make no mistake," says John Cady,
president of the food processors group, "different food
safety and labeling requirements will impose very substantial
added costs to our national food distribution system." Adds
C. Manly Molpus, president of the Grocery Manufacturers of
America: "When it comes to what diet and health information
goes on food labels, there can be only one cook in the
kitchen."</p>
<p>But consumer groups oppose federal pre-emption. The
industry "just wants to preclude more stringent state
labeling requirements," including freshness dating and
organic-food labeling laws, Mr. Silverglade says.</p>
<p>The thrust of the labeling package is to help consumers
make sense out of a welter of confusing and often conflicting
nutritional information as food companies increasingly rely
on health claims as a marketing tool. Under current
regulations, nutritional labels are required only when a
company makes a nutritional claim or adds vitamins, minerals
or protein to a product.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dr. Sullivan said nutritional labeling would be
required on every packaged-food product that is a "meaningful
source" of nutrients. Food sold by restaurants, bakeries and
other small businesses would be exempt from the proposed
rule, as would spices and bite-size food, such as mints and
penny candies. Supermarkets would be required to post
nutritional information on fruit, vegetables, fish and
seafood or distribute booklets to shoppers.</p>
<p>On the top half of a typical label, the FDA would require
food companies to list the number of calories from fat per
serving, as well as the amount of saturated fatty acids,
cholesterol and total dietary fiber. Currently, only figures
for protein, carbohydrates fat and calories are required.</p>
<p>On the bottom half, the agency now requires companies to
list the percentage of recommended daily allowances per
serving of eight nutrients: protein, vitamin A, vitamin C,
thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, calcium and iron. Under its new
rules, the FDA would make the listing of thiamine, riboflavin
and niacin optional, and would only require protein on foods
for infants and young children.</p>
<p>The agency also proposes switching from recommended daily
allowances, or RDAs, to an internationally used term,
"reference daily intakes," or RDIs, for the sake of
uniformity. At the same time, the agency would update the
RDIs for protein, 12 vitamins and seven minerals. In
addition, it would set RDIs for seven other nutrients,
including vitamin K, manganese and selenium.</p>
