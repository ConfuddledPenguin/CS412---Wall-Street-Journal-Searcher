	<p class="article-leader">New York -- It's difficult to feel much optimism about the
future of American Ballet Theatre. Unless ABT starts showing
more signs of creative integrity than it has so far under its
new directors, Jane Hermann and Oliver Smith, the company is
hardly likely to survive for very long. Though such an
appraisal may seem premature, the interviews Ms. Hermann and
Mr. Smith have been giving do not inspire confidence in their
artistic judgment.
   What they are planning is to give ABT an infusion of
Euroschlock -- works by those drearily familiar figures, some
of them expatriate Americans, who have made careers out of
portentousness rather than steps: James Kudelka, Maguy Marin,
Glen Tetley and Jiri Kylian. Next season is to bring Mr.
Kylian's meretricious "Sinfonietta," last seen at the Met in
1979 during the visit of Mr. Kylian's own Netherlands Dance
Theater. To help us survive the two years it apparently is
going to take for this choreographer to come forth with a new
ballet for ABT, we are to get a re-working by the Bolshoi's
Vladimir Vasiliev of Mikhail Baryshnikov's version of that
old warhorse, "Don Quixote."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In none of their interviews did the directors say a single
word about Mark Morris, whose "Drink to Me Only With Thine
Eyes," commissioned by Mr. Baryshnikov in 1988, is both
surpassingly beautiful and -- though it only was accorded two
performances in the current ABT season -- a crowd pleaser.
They said scarcely more about Twyla Tharp. From what they did
say, it's hard to believe that Ms. Hermann and Mr. Smith
realize how fortunate they are to have a new ballet by her in
the current season's repertoire, as well as enough hits by
her to make up an entire evening.</p>
<p>There's little doubt that this Tharp triple bill excited
the audience as much as anything presented all season. "Push
Comes to Shove," it's true, wanted edge. But, then, it's no
less an ensemble piece than a star vehicle, and the ensemble
looked under-rehearsed, while Gil Boggs, in the role created
in 1976 by Mr. Baryshnikov, showed none of the latter's comic
flair. "In the Upper Room" also looked as if it needed more
rehearsal, but came off better. Its association of order with
energy is theatrically potent, and the audience greeted the
final curtain with the kind of roar that signifies
identification as well as excitement. "Nine Sinatra Songs,"
new to the repertoire, sent waves of euphoria rolling through
the auditorium.</p>
<p>The Sinatra ballet is a good example of what Ms. Tharp has
to offer ABT -- apart, that is, from a brilliant work, in
which ballroom dancing, enhanced by virtuosity, illuminates
behavior, feelings and the vagaries of human nature. At the
same time, the piece does wonders for the performers,
especially those who, like Susan Jaffe, Christine Dunham and
Amanda McKerrow, have talent but seem incapable of realizing
it fully without better artistic guidance than they evidently
get at ABT. Apart from Leslie Browne, all the cast responds
to the technical challenges of "Nine Sinatra Songs" with a
whole heartedness that transmutes proficiency into art. The
metamorphosis of Ms. McKerrow was one of the season's big
pleasures. For the first time, she looked not like a
promising neophyte but a mature artist. Maybe in due course
Twyla Tharp could even rescue Ms. Browne.</p>
<p>The choreographer's ability to isolate the essential gifts
of a particular dancer has never been more clearly in
evidence than in her handling of Cheryl Yeager, whom Ms.
Tharp cast as the female lead in her new piece for ABT,
"Brief Fling." Until Ms. Yeager appeared in this ballet, her
artistic resources seemed limited to a combination of
pertness and a disarming, if unfocused buoyancy. "Brief
Fling" gave her the chance to show that she has something
more interesting to offer. In the case of her partner, Julio
Bocca, Ms. Tharp has extended his range and concentrated his
gifts.</p>
<p>Both Ms. Yeager and Mr. Bocca perform at breathtaking
speed the most dazzling steps and combinations. Because the
choreographer has so clear an understanding of the different
capabilities of male and female dancers, she makes their
prowess complementary as well as competitive, and thus a
metaphor of sexual harmony. In demonstrating the resources of
classical ballet technique, Ms. Tharp tests the pair to the
limits of speed, precision, daring and stamina. The results
are exhilarating -- not simply because the dancers exemplify
an ideal freedom from ordinary physical limitations, but
because they also embody an energy that transcends mere
physicality.</p>
<p>In composing these dances, as well as those for the two
pairs of demi-soloists -- Claudia Alfieri and Gil Boggs, and
Isabella Padovani and Robert Wallace or Johan Renvall -- Ms.
Tharp shows a thorough mastery of ballet technique. The same,
unfortunately, cannot be said of Mr. Kylian, Mr. Kudelka, Mr.
Tetley and Ms. Marin, nor of that current ABT favorite, Agnes
de Mille, whose foolish and glib "Fall River Legend" has just
been disinterred by the new ABT management.</p>
<p>Like so many of Ms. Tharp's works, "Brief Fling"
juxtaposes classical ballet with the choreographer's
idiosyncratic postmodern choreography, the latter wonderfully
performed by Jamie Bishton, Kevin O'Day, Keith Roberts and
Shelley Washington. There is no conflict between the two
kinds of dance, only an illuminating dissimilarity. "Brief
Fling" is at once about co-existence and variety. Properly
understood, the piece demonstrates how ballet can survive
after the death of Balanchine, whose work has brought an
entire phase of the art to a glorious but inhibiting
conclusion.</p>
