	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices rebounded widely in light but healthy
trading, with the Nikkei Index extending midday gains
following active buying by investment trust funds.
   London stocks, meanwhile, ended a choppy session mixed, as
an opening advance ran out of steam.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 447.58 points to
31571.77, posting the first daily gain in four trading days.
The index fell 570.38 points Monday, the biggest daily loss
since April 16.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index
surged another 494.91 points to 32066.68.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the index moved narrowly around 31300 points
most of the day, as firm currency and bond markets encouraged
investors to look for bargains after Monday's retrenchment,
traders said.</p>
<p>High-technology issues led the advancers in the afternoon.
Interest rate-sensitive large-capital shares added moderate
gains because of perceptions their prices neared bottom after
the heavy selling of the past week, observers said.</p>
<p>Volume on the first section was estimated at 400 million
shares, improving from 292.3 million shares Monday. Advancers
outnumbered decliners 655 to 286, while 174 issues were
unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was up 22.33 points, or 0.97%, to 2323.35.</p>
<p>The second section index rose 23.32 points, or 0.57%, to
4111.58. Volume in the section was estimated at 18.3 million
shares, up from 12.4 million shares Monday.</p>
<p>Securities companies tried to stir up activity before
today, the first trading day for transaction recorded in
July, by placing buy orders for their own accounts and
intensifying sales efforts, traders said.</p>
<p>"The point isn't whether or not we expect stock prices to
go up in July. We've got to do something, instead of just
being discouraged" about the market, said a senior trader at
Yamaichi Securities.</p>
<p>The dealer-led buying won support from individual
investors who were encouraged by the firmness of the yen and
bond prices yesterday morning.</p>
<p>After rising 200 points within 20 minutes of the open of
trading, the Nikkei Index remained higher. Investment trust
funds, which consistently placed buy orders at lower levels,
also helped prevent the index from falling and made investors
feel secure about buying, traders said.</p>
<p>New funds are scheduled to begin investing in the stock
market this week, following payment of salary bonuses. But
because an increasing number of trust fund accounts have been
unwound because of the stock market's poor outlook, the
overall effect of new trust funds on the market this month
probably will be "between neutral and positive," said Shin
Tokoi, deputy general manager of stock trading at County
NatWest Securities.</p>
<p>Although traders said there's little fear that stock
prices will fall below 31000, the traders predict a slow
recovery of the market from its current level.</p>
<p>Mirroring the lack of market strength, daily trading
volume has remained below 500 million shares for 12
consecutive trading days, the longest such period since
October 1986.</p>
<p>Securities companies, which have been suffering from a
lack of commission income, are hoping to lift volume by
boosting high-priced issues, which can increase overall
transaction value on smaller volume, traders said.</p>
<p>Winners yesterday included Kyocera, which advanced 160 yen
to 8330 yen ($1.03 to $53.59). Pioneer Electronic gained 80
yen to 6150 yen, and TDK was up 250 yen to 7050 yen.</p>
<p>Other gainers were Daifuku, which rose 80 yen to 2800 yen,
and Fuji Photo Film, which rose 110 yen to 4390 yen.</p>
<p>Construction issues rose, with Kajima gaining 40 yen to
1900 yen, while Ohbayashi added 40 yen to 1610 yen.</p>
<p>London shares zoomed higher in the early going on a surge
in the stock-index futures market and bullish recommendations
on the brewery sector. But with most institutional investors
already locked into end-of-quarter positions, there was
little significant buying at the upper levels, market
professionals said.</p>
<p>Even a strong start to Wall Street didn't inspire any
fresh movements, dealers said. "It's a buyers strike," one
dealer said. "We opened firm but died later on a lack of
business."</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index gained
1.3 points to 2399.8, well below the early morning intraday
peak of 2420.1.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30-Share Index fell 2.8 points to
1926.6. Volume was a modest 461.2 million shares, up from
379.1 million issues Monday.</p>
<p>In the futures markets, the June FT-SE 100 Index contract
closed at 2409, slightly better than the 2407 settlement
Monday, but well below the day's peak of 2432. Dealers
expressed surprise over the robust demand for the June
contract, considering it will expire Friday.</p>
<p>Of the top 100 stocks in terms of market capitalization,
38 finished lower, 53 closed higher, while nine ended
unchanged.</p>
<p>Among corporate features, brewers ended stronger on a
combination of some buy recommendations, stock shortages, and
because of the positive sentiment prompted by the "Guinness
money" coming back into the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>The funds investors gained from the sales of Guinness
shares to LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, as part of the
companies' agreement to hold an equal share in the other, are
being re-invested in Guinness and the sector in general,
market professionals said.</p>
<p>Allied-Lyons rose 4 pence to 510 pence (7 cents to $8.82),
Scottish & Newcastle advanced 3 pence to 340 pence, and
Whitbread gained 8 pence to 451 pence. Against the trend,
Grand Metropolitan fell 12 pence to 660 pence on what traders
said was a "switch" recommendation from Grand Met into
Allied-Lyons.</p>
<p>Cement and building products maker RMC gained 18 pence to
707 pence, after a bullish buy recommendation from brokerage
Robert Fleming.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, shares ended higher in Paris, Amsterdam,
Stockholm and Madrid; lower in Frankfurt and Brussels; and
were mixed in Milan and Zurich. South African gold stocks
closed narrowly mixed.</p>
<p>Also, stocks closed higher in Sydney, Hong Kong and
Singapore, lower in Seoul, Manila and Taipei and mixed in
Wellington.</p>
<p>Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets,
as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International
Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each
index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The
percentage change is since year-end.</p>
