	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- The Soviet Union is having trouble paying $2
billion in foreign bills but has asked for more Western
credits to help move toward a market economy, Gennady I.
Gerasimov, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, acknowledged.
   "We're experiencing some commercial difficulties now," he
said. "Our perfectly immaculate record on the external market
of always paying our debts is now under question." He
attributed the $2 billion deficit in the current account, or
balance of payments, partly to disruptions from moving away
from central planning.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Citing the $2.98 billion West German bank credit backed by
Bonn this week, he said, "If we have credits, it will be
easier for us to have economic reform." The Soviet Union's
economic potential should be enough collateral for
large-scale economic credits, he said, though Moscow hasn't
any plans for implementing them.</p>
