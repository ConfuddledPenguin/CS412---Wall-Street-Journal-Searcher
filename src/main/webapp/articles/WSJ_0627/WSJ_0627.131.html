	<p class="article-leader">West Co., Phoenixville, Pa., said it expects to report a
drop in second-quarter earnings that "could be greater than
50%" because of production problems in the U.S. and a
curtailment of business in Brazil.
   For the quarter ended July 2, 1989, the maker of
specialized packaging for the pharmaceutical industry
reported net income of $6.8 million, or 42 cents a share, on
sales of $79.5 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>West cited two unrelated reasons for the anticipated
earnings decline. The first was the discovery of substandard
raw materials that forced a halt in production. The company
said it had to conduct new testing and inspections before it
could begin output of a replacement product.</p>
<p>The second reason, West said, was a series of changes in
Brazilian monetary and fiscal policy, imposed in recent
months. Those changes "substantially curtailed" West's
activity in Brazil.</p>
<p>Rene L. Guerster, West's president and chief executive
officer, said the expected lower results will include a
reserve for expenses related to the raw-material problem. He
didn't quantify the reserve.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Guerster noted that West has resumed
production and that Brazilian operations are returning to
normal.</p>
