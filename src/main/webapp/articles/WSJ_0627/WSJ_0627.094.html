	<p class="article-leader">Unisys Corp., struggling with a heavy debt load, said it
sold $150 million of preferred stock to Mitsui & Co. of Japan
that can be converted into 4.6% of Unisys's common stock
outstanding.
   Unisys, a maker of computer equipment and defense
electronics, also arranged a $50 million, five-year loan from
the huge Japanese trading company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Japanese investments in U.S. computer companies have
sometimes been controversial, and, in some cases, barred by
the U.S. government on the grounds that the technology is
crucial for national security. But Unisys, Blue Bell, Pa.,
played down the significance of the investment, noting that
Mitsui can't increase its stake.</p>
<p>Unisys also said it was natural to turn to Mitsui for
financing, given that the two companies have worked together
for decades. The companies each own one-third of Nihon Unisys
Ltd., a computer marketer that does about $2 billion of
business each year in Japan. And Sperry Corp., which merged
with Burroughs Corp. four years ago to form Unisys, began
working with Mitsui in the late 1950s.</p>
<p>Unisys has made little progress thus far on its stated
plan to cut debt by $600 million to $800 million this year,
from about $4 billion, or 50% of total capitalization, at the
end of last year. The Mitsui arrangement, however, doesn't
seem to indicate that the Unisys plan has run into problems.
It simply means that the debt reductions, mainly through the
sale of real estate, will occur in the second half.</p>
<p>Investors took the Mitsui arrangement in stride. Unisys
stock closed at $13.125, down only 50 cents, in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The more worrisome problems are all long term. Unisys ran
into difficulties in late 1988 as inventories swelled and
orders in the U.S. slowed. Although its momentum had been
impressive to that point, it wound up reporting a $639
million loss for 1989, including a $230 million charge
related to an 8% reduction in its work force. Unisys followed
that with a loss of $3.1 million, or 19 cents a share, in the
1990 first quarter and securities analysts expect it to only
break even in the current second quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts generally predict that Unisys will do much better
in the second half, as it gets its debt under control and as
it gets the full benefits of last year's job cuts. So,
earnings estimates range from $1 to $2 a share for all of
1990. But many analysts are wary about counting on such a
sharp upturn, especially because there haven't yet been signs
that Unisys's U.S. business is turning around.</p>
