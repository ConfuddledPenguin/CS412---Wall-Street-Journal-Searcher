	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- A House Judiciary subcommittee unanimously
approved legislation that would restrict use of the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in
lawsuits. But prospects for the bill's enactment are cloudy.
   The current law, known as RICO, grants triple damages to
victims of civil fraud. For years, business groups have been
lobbying for a change in the law, arguing that it was
intended to apply only to organized crime. But
public-interest advocates have argued against altering the
law, saying it is an effective weapon against fraud by
savings-and-loan associations and other white-collar
businesses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Offered as a compromise by crime subcommittee chairman
Rep. Bill Hughes (D., N.J.), Rep. Bill McCollum (R., Fla.)
and Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.), the measure approved
yesterday is more moderate than a version approved by the
Senate Judiciary committee in February. Rep. Hughes called it
a "vast improvement on what Congress has passed in the past."</p>
<p>Under the House bill, federal courts would act as
"gatekeepers" for the RICO law, allowing its use only if
certain conditions are met. For example, the court would need
to determine whether the case involves "egregious criminal
conduct" for which there has been a previous criminal
conviction. If not, the law couldn't be applied unless the
court determined that the case was of unusual magnitude or
significance. The bill also would impose a stiffer burden of
proof in RICO cases than is the norm in most civil cases.</p>
<p>Arguing that the bill shouldn't let people who defraud
savings and loans off the hook, Rep. John Conyers (D., Mich.)
introduced an amendment to maintain existing RICO penalties
for pending and future S&L cases. "We're talking the biggest
scandal in American history," he said. But he voluntarily
withdrew the amendment after other committee members
questioned its constitutionality. Rep. Conyers also
introduced an amendment to exempt current lawsuits from the
change. The measure failed on a 4-6 vote.</p>
<p>Rep. Conyers, who voted to approve the bill, said he will
reintroduce his savings-and-loan amendment when the bill
comes before the full Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>Floor action on the Senate bill, which differs
significantly from the House version, isn't expected soon. A
spokesman for the bill's Senate sponsor, Sen. Dennis
DeConcini (D., Ariz.) said he didn't know whether Sen.
DeConcini would support the gatekeeper compromise.</p>
<p>Sen. DeConcini initially received criticism for his
version of the bill because it granted RICO relief in current
lawsuits, including those against Charles Keating, chairman
of the former parent of Lincoln Savings & Loan Association.
Mr. Keating's ties to Sen. DeConcini are the subject of a
Senate ethics investigation. Sen. DeConcini subsequently
modified his position, calling for RICO relief only in future
lawsuits. The Senate Judiciary Committee included this change
in its version of the bill.</p>
<p>Unlike the House version, however, the Senate RICO bill
wouldn't give the courts the power to grant triple damages.
Instead, such damages would be eliminated in all but a few
instances.</p>
