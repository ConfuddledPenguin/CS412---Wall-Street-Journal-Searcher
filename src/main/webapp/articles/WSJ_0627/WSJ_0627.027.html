	<p class="article-leader">Nooz kums to us frum France that the guvermint has decided
to spell French more like itz spoken. Mostlee, the 1,200 odd
changes arent big ones -- they lopped the little hats off the
`i's' and `u's' and they took away some hyphens. All rite.
But how kum? Their reasons are suspishus.
   Prime Minister Michel Rocard sez he wants to make things
eezier for kids facing the demands of their own langwidge.
The guvermint hopes the simplificashun will aid foriners --
that iz, Africans in ex-French koloneez -- in their struggle
with the old imperial tung. Itz trew that French iz
difficult, and that many of the changes -- "piquenique",
French for "picnic," bekumz piquenique -- arent exactly
revolushionerry.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Behind the recommendashuns of M. Rocard's High Commishun
on the French Langwidge, though, rests an uncommishun-like
emoshun: panick. 1992 is approaching fast and English is
turning out to be the forin langwidge of choice in
pioneerland East Yurp. The French fear they'll lose what grip
they retain on internashional culture. French, of course,
used to be the world's langwidge, the "lingua franca" of
diplomats. To find vestiges of that grandeur, just look at
the text inside yer passport. What will yew find? French.</p>
<p>In fact, the noo rerite provides ample evidence of how
much the French have allredy caved. This time, the regime has
confined itself to removing hifins from anglicisms that have
snuk their way into the langwidge of Racine and Proust.
Weekend, for example, bekumz weekend. Just a few years ago,
in the early days of his presidencee, Francois Mitterrand was
ordering kinglier changes. He directed his guvermint to
concoct French alternatives to "Franglais" words. The
walkman, for example, bekame the "baladeur." Parisians,
though, turned their nozes up at this "dirigisme". Even M.
Mitterrand's own guvermint did not get very far with the
Frenchonlee policee. This noozpaper's Thomas Kamm has
reported that when M. Mitterrand's forin minister, Roland
Dumas, met with francophone heads of state to discuss the
future of the problem, he told them it was time to set up un
task force.</p>
<p>Az for the hifins, mebbe the French arnt doing themselves
a favor. For a year now diplomats at Kay d'Orsay have been
complaining that Germun reunification will let the Germuns
dominate in Yurp. So what are the French doing? Turning nice
palatable wurds like "contre-espionnage" into long
unpalatable wuns like "contreespionnage." Lots of foriners
and Frenchmin too wud call that a Germunification of the
French langwidge.</p>
<p>The idee that the changes will help foriners iz also
kwestionable. Won of the major shifts is in the spelling of
the French wurd for unyun, "oignon." The French say it wud be
better tew spill unyun like itz spoken, "ognon". But this
will mean a lot of updating works for publishers who produce
cookbooks documenting that very American fenomenon, "nouvelle
cuisine". And if they're going tew change "oignon", why dont
they change that evun harder wurd for its cozzin, garlick --
ail?</p>
<p>In fact, the "modest" French proposall will even force itz
way into American dictionaries. "Bonhomie", for example, kums
from the French, but is now an English word. Now, in the name
of accomodating foriners, the French want tew switch the
French spelling -- "bonhomie" bekumz "bonhommie". Where doze
that leave us Americans with our spelling? Websturs will
rilly be pleezed.</p>
<p>Behind the reriting of the French langwidge something for
witch there iz a fine French word: "tiers-mondisme",
Third-Worldism. In the hope of making things eezier for
African Francophones, the French are lowering the levill for
evereewun. We wonder if all the distingwished Francophone
authors from this part of the world will appreshiate being
condescended to.</p>
<p>The wurld, of course, has survived such efforts before.
Rite here in Amerika, earlier this censhury, Kernel McCormick
changed the spelling of English in his noozpapers. Through
bekame thru and night bekame nite. But in the end mytee
papers like the Chikago Tribyewn changed bak. The only item
frum that vocabulary that can claim to have survived is
perhaps our ubikwitous adjective for diet food: lite.</p>
<p>Even the French -- espeshully the French -- have their own
failed models to look bak tew. After the revolushun, the
guvermint gave the months noo names, like "Thermidor" and
renumbered the years, bekuz it wunted to shake off the
influence of the old society and the Cathlick church. That
lasted fewer than 15 years. After Napoleon bekame emperur,
they went back to "Janvier" and "Fevrier". Wait that long,
and the Mitterrand changes may have disappeared. Problee, we
shudnt wurry.</p>
