	<p class="article-leader">Zeist, the Netherlands -- Ad Hoogendijk conducts his
practice in a narrow office lined with shelves neatly marked
"Philosophy," "Sexology" and "Literature." Tomes by Masters
and Johnson, Wilhelm Reich, Spinoza and Kant stand next to
Jack Kerouac's fiction and Dante's "Divine Comedy." The
selection may reflect some of the free spirit of the '60s,
but Mr. Hoogendijk's work revolves around the eternal
questions of life and death. He is a consulting philosopher,
a sage for hire.
   Mr. Hoogendijk, 39 years old, is the first among a dozen
Dutch philosophers to have set up a consultancy practice. For
a price of 100 guilders ($53), paid at the end of each
75-minute session, men and women from all over Holland visit
the suburbs of this small town near Utrecht, climb the stairs
to the second floor of an anonymous red brick building in a
characterless housing development, and sit down to talk about
matters of fate and destiny.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The first modern wise man with an hourly rate was Gerd B.
Achenbach of Cologne, West Germany. He started guiding the
perplexed nine years ago. Soon the Danes began making
appointments with their own home-grown rent-a-Kierkegaards.
But today the Dutch are the most enthusiastic converts to
taxi-cogitation. Mr. Hoogendijk has a theory to explain this.
Here it is, free of charge:</p>
<p>"Ever since the Middle Ages, we Dutch have been a nation
of traders. A generation of philosophers has now emerged who
want to put that ancestral trading temperament into
practice."</p>
<p>Mr. Hoogendijk, who has the height, blond hair and angular
cheekbones of a Northern seafarer, wants to offer his logical
and epistemological skills to industry. He believes
philosophy can be fruitfully applied to career coaching in
big companies suffering from demotivated staff and
relationship problems.</p>
<p>If there's one thing that makes Mr. Hoogendijk wrinkle his
sapient brow with disdain, however, it's the suggestion that
what he is doing resembles therapy. "I have explained again
and again why what I do isn't therapy," he snarls
unstoically, flushing slightly. The blowfish that dangles in
front of the window trembles on its string. "I am not a
therapist," he says. "I don't want to be a therapist. I am
not interested in people's past; I like to talk about the
future. I don't diagnose and I don't prognosticate." If
comparisons must be made, he would rather be likened to a
lawyer.</p>
<p>At Amsterdam University, where he obtained a master's
degree in philosophy, Mr. Hoogendijk found that he and a
couple of fellow students tended to apply their philosophical
training to the problems in their daily lives. "I thought,
why not try to do something practical with philosophy?" He
then studied sexology and pastoral theology at Rijks
University in Utrecht, and opened a practice in a room in his
house.</p>
<p>The first "visitors," as he and his fellow consulting
philosophers prefer to call their clients, came through the
small ads he put in the newspapers ("Philosophical practice
for clarifying discussions about vital questions"), the
flyers he sent out, and the dozens of interviews he gave on
the radio and to the press. The very first person he saw was
a woman in her 50s who ran a company and felt, he says, "that
she had a philosophical attitude to life, and problems at
work that she wanted to talk about."</p>
<p>Three years on, Mr. Hoogendijk has written a book,
"Spreekuur bij een filosoof" ("A Philosopher's Office
Hours"), soon to be translated into English. It's an
examination of the in and outs of practical philosophy, with
a special emphasis on his personal pantheon of philosophers:
Michel Foucault, Herbert Marcuse, Jean-Paul Sartre and Hannah
Arendt. As their acolyte, his ambition is to take
existentialist, phenomenological and structuralist thought
and apply it to various aspects of contemporary society.</p>
<p>Dividing his time between his private practice and the
philosophy classes he teaches in vocational schools, Mr.
Hoogendijk says he has between two and 15 consultancies a
week. He has spoken to people as young as 18 who were worried
about what university studies to choose to older folks
worried about death. Some visitors may come just once, but
the average time people need to talk things over is several
months.</p>
<p>A first-time visitor finds herself settling down in the
yellow wickerwork chair, with Mr. Hoogendijk sitting across
from her in a more lavish leather swivel armchair. There is a
low table between them. The room is bright and impeccably
tidy.</p>
<p>Most visitors are concerned with problems related to their
careers. Others come because they are worried about personal
problems or the meaning of life. Mr. Hoogendijk tries to help
his clients find their own answers and to get them thinking
about identity, ability and ambition.</p>
<p>"Most people don't know what they want," says Mr.
Hoogendijk, touching his pale yellow psychedelic tie. He
adds, sounding, despite his denials, very much like a
therapist, "Many have buried their desires. I try to
encourage a form of Utopian thinking." He likes to start by
pinpointing the problems in a person's life, before building
an ideal life plan, in 10-year slices, made of "all the
dreams, ideals and wishes." Then visitor and philosopher talk
about it and try to build a bridge, as Mr. Hoogendijk puts
it, between the real world of mortgages, families and sexual
frustration and the secret world of fantasy.</p>
<p>If this sounds like something any craggy fellow could do,
Mr. Hoogendijk and other consulting philosophers have formed
the Organization for Philosophical Practice (VFP) to keep
opportunistic Platos-come-lately out of the wisdom-monger
game. VFP members meet regularly in an Amsterdam hotel called
De Filosoof, run by Ida Jongsma, a philosopher friend of Mr.
Hoogendijk from student days.</p>
<p>Mr. Hoogendijk sees a rich future for his field. For too
long, he says, his country's philosophers have sat in their
ivory towers, oblivious to the teeming world beyond their
walls, even though they were writing books about life, love
and death, fear and freedom -- subjects with obvious
importance to the everyday life of ordinary people.</p>
<p>"Philosophy," he concludes, "is destined to become more
and more important. We're entering an era when people want to
feel that there's a connection between their work and the
meaning of life. And that's going to change a lot of things."</p>
