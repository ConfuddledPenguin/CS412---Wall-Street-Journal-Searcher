	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- An early rally inspired by deficit-reduction
talk gave way to earnings worries yesterday, and stocks
closed slightly lower.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 2.72 points to
2842.33.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stock and bond prices rallied sharply yesterday morning
after it was reported that President Bush said tax revenue
increases would have to be part of any "responsible"
deficit-reduction effort. The industrial average jumped about
30 points in early trading, but the rally quickly faded as
earnings concerns began to dominate the market again.</p>
<p>Caterpillar, which fell 5 Monday on a statement from the
company about its earnings outlook, tumbled another 6 to 52
1/2 on huge volume of nearly five million shares. Corning
said earnings for its fiscal second quarter fell to 71 cents
a share from 76 cents a year earlier, and the stock fell 2
1/8 to 43 7/8.</p>
<p>L.A. Gear, which is expected to announce earnings today
after the market's close, fell 1 3/8 to 26 1/8. Earlier this
month, L.A. Gear said it expected earnings for the second
fiscal quarter, ended May 31, to be about 50 to 60 cents a
share against 91 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>Investors don't see signs of strong consumer spending, and
that's one reason why shares of retailers are weak. Wal-Mart
slipped 5/8 to 59 1/2. Investors are also losing faith in
some cyclical stocks whose fortunes are tied to the economy.</p>
<p>Dow Chemical fell 1 1/2 to 57 3/8 with 1.3 million shares
changing hands. Shearson Lehman and Goldman Sachs both
lowered estimates of the company's earnings for the second
quarter and the year; also, Oppenheimer & Co. recommended
that investors avoid the stock, based on its belief that
earnings may stay in a downward trend over the next 12 to 15
months.</p>
<p>"The scary thing is that (bad earnings news) is running
across industries," said Leo Grohowski, director of
Marinvest's stock investments. "People are asking, where is
the strength in the domestic economy?" Mr. Grohowski said
investors are now buying defensive issues "where there is a
high degree of confidence that earnings will be good," even
though many of these issues are expensive.</p>
<p>The divergence between cyclical and defensive issues was
in evidence among the stocks in the Dow industrials. While
General Motors fell 1 to 46 7/8 on 1.2 million shares and
Aluminum Co. of America lost 7/8 to 63 7/8, Philip Morris
rose 1/4 to 46 7/8 on 2.5 million shares, Coca-Cola Co. rose
3/8 to 43 1/4 and Merck added 5/8 to 82 7/8.</p>
<p>Other drug stocks generally rallied along with Merck, but
there was one notable exception: Pfizer, which fell 1 1/8 to
62 3/8. PaineWebber analyst Ronald Nordmann estimated that
Pfizer's second-quarter earnings will be "no better than 85
to 90 cents a share, and could be lower." The company posted
net income of 80 cents a share in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>Mr. Nordmann also said he sees the potential for favorable
second-quarter earnings surprises from Warner-Lambert, which
gained 3/8 to 62 1/4, and Eli Lilly, which added 1/8 to 79
3/8. Among other drug stocks, Johnson & Johnson rose 1/8 to
64 7/8; Dean Witter Reynolds added the stock to its list of
recommended issues.</p>
<p>Selling spilled into heavy-machinery stocks. Deere dropped
1 1/4 to 69 1/2, Clark Equipment fell 1 3/4 to 39 1/4 and
Nacco Industries lost 1 1/2 to 59 1/2.</p>
<p>Continental Bank, which said it expects to post a
second-quarter loss, fell 5/8 to 15 3/8. The company noted
that the loss would reflect a pretax reserve of $50 million
to cover costs of a plan to eliminate certain product lines
and reduce its staff by about 900 employees.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Transportation Average fell 12.07 to 1135.77
-- its ninth loss in the past 10 sessions -- as the airline
group was hit with selling. UAL, which owns United Airlines,
slid 5 to 147; AMR, the parent of American Airlines, fell 1/2
to 62 7/8; Delta Air Lines dropped 3/4 to 73, and USAir Group
fell 1/4 to 25 7/8.</p>
<p>Gulf States Utilities rose 1 to 11 1/8 after agreeing in
principle to a $300 million settlement of a dispute with
Southern Co. over power sales contracts. In response,
Standard & Poor's upgraded its ratings on Gulf States' debt
issues; the agency said the proposed settlement "removes
considerable uncertainty surrounding credit quality" at the
utility. Southern gained 3/8 to 25.</p>
<p>Unisys lost 1/2 to 13 1/8. The company agreed to sell $150
million of convertible preferred stock to Mitsui & Co. of
Japan through a private placement. The accord also calls for
Mitsui to provide Unisys with a five-year, $50 million loan.</p>
<p>American International Group, which agreed to acquire
International Lease Finance for cash and stock valued at
$1.38 billion, tumbled 2 5/8 to 94. International Lease
advanced 3 7/8 to 31 in over-the-counter trading.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index fell 0.59
to 356.80. Volume totaled 10,540,000 shares.</p>
