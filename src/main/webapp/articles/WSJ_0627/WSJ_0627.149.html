	<p class="article-leader">FREEHOLD, N.J. -- Raycomm Transworld Industries Inc.
expects to report break-even results for the fourth quarter
ended March 31 and a $730,000 profit for the year, compared
with net losses in both year-earlier periods.
   The fiscal fourth quarter is usually the weakest for
Raycomm, when the temporary-help concern pays higher payroll
taxes; the levies are higher early in the calendar year and
decline as the year goes on, said Robert Fain, president and
chief executive officer, in an interview.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But by slashing overhead, reducing corporate staff and
focusing on a core business -- placing technical personnel in
the aerospace, defense and electronics industries -- the
company was able to bring its net worth to about a positive
$766,000 at fiscal year's end from a negative $1.3 million a
year earlier, Mr. Fain said in an interview.</p>
<p>The fourth-quarter estimate compares with a year-ago loss
of $575,000, or six cents a share. Raycomm's quarterly
revenue is estimated at $12.5 million to $13 million vs.
$12.8 million, Mr. Fain said.</p>
<p>For the year, Raycomm's profit estimate equals eight cents
a share, compared with a loss of $2.7 million, or 30 cents a
share, for fiscal 1989. The company estimates that revenue
slipped about 4.4% to $53.5 million from $55.9 million; the
company disposed of two businesses, temporary-help
franchising and nursing placement, during fiscal 1989.</p>
<p>"We're enjoying a very good {fiscal} first quarter," Mr.
Fain said, and the company projects substantially stronger
results for both the quarter and all of fiscal 1991.</p>
<p>"The most important thing that could get in the way," he
said, would be a radical cut in defense {spending}, and we
weren't able to replace the business. I don't foresee it, but
it could happen."</p>
