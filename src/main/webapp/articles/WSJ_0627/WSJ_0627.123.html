	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- President Bush made a politically charged
decision to delay oil drilling in environmentally sensitive
areas off the California and Florida coasts. But he did so
only after employing a favorite tactic: He called in members
of Congress to collaborate on the call.
   Lawmakers from California and Florida trooped into the
White House on consecutive days last month, and, seated
around a long conference table, gave Mr. Bush a telling
message. Neither delegation voiced much enthusiasm about
having drilling off its coast. Surprisingly, though, a few
Californians -- including Democratic Sen. Alan Cranston --
said drilling in some carefully selected spots might be
acceptable.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As the decision Mr. Bush unveiled makes clear, those
messages were pivotal. They galvanized the president's
natural inclination to tilt toward environmental and
political concerns in his decision, while offering a
consolation prize to his old friends in the oil industry.</p>
<p>After 16 months of deliberations, Mr. Bush said he is
postponing oil-and-gas leasing and drilling in a large area
off Florida and nearly all of two large areas off northern
and southern California until the year 2000. He also will
permanently ban drilling in California's Monterey Bay and
delay leasing until after 2000 in the Georges Bank area of
the North Atlantic and an area off Oregon and Washington.</p>
<p>But in a small concession to oil interests, Mr. Bush said
that 87 potentially lucrative tracts near existing drilling
off the California coast near Santa Barbara might be made
available for leasing in 1996, pending further scientific
studies of that area.</p>
<p>"My goal is to create a much more carefully targeted
(drilling) program, one that is responsive to local concerns,
to environmental concerns, and to the need to develop
prudently our nation's domestic energy resources," Mr. Bush
declared.</p>
<p>The drilling decision is among the most politically touchy
that Mr. Bush will handle in this election year, because it
directly affects the fortunes of Republican gubernatorial
candidates Pete Wilson in California and Robert Martinez in
Florida. Their elections are pivotal to GOP hopes of
controlling the drawing of as many as 10 new congressional
districts those states are likely to get as a result of this
year's census.</p>
<p>And while Mr. Bush's decision falls short of the total
drilling ban environmental activists want, it seems to tilt
far enough toward environmental concerns to insulate those
two candidates from attack by environmental groups on the
issue.</p>
<p>California's Mr. Wilson, now in the U.S. Senate, has been
particularly worried about the drilling issue, and at times
in recent months seemed to wish it would just disappear. At
one White House meeting with Mr. Bush, for instance, he
counseled the president against hasty decisions by reminding
him of the story of a death-row inmate who asked for some
fresh strawberries as part of his final meal. When told that
strawberries were out of season, the condemned man replied:
"That's all right, I'll wait."</p>
<p>The story of how Mr. Bush settled the offshore leasing
issue speaks volumes about his decision-making style. Never a
snap decision-maker, he tends to agonize over a tough call.
Faced with a debate between warring factions, he invariably
tries to split the difference. And before moving, Mr. Bush
tries to draw all factions into his tent by meticulously
consulting them.</p>
<p>In this case, Mr. Bush's own advisers were split over how
to finesse the delicate matter. Interior Secretary Manuel
Lujan angered White House aides at one point in the
deliberations by suggesting in a speech that moratoriums on
drilling are a bad idea and leaving listeners with the
impression he wanted to plunge ahead with development. Mr.
Lujan was forced to issue a statement declaring he remained
committed to environmental protection.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, such advisers as presidential pollster Robert
Teeter argued that the chances of actually drilling in
sensitive areas off California and Florida coasts were
remote, regardless of what Mr. Bush decided, because
congressional action and environmental lawsuits would tie up
developers anyway. Some White House aides contended it might
be wiser for Mr. Bush to save his political capital for a
later fight to begin drilling in the big Alaska National
Wildlife Refuge, which may have rich oil reserves.</p>
<p>The offshore-leasing decision was especially agonizing for
Mr. Bush, because he was torn between his love for the
offshore-drilling business, which he helped create as a Texas
oil man, and his politically important promises to be an
"environmental president." During one meeting with lawmakers,
an aide recalls, Mr. Bush posed a series of rhetorical
questions that disclosed his inner struggle. "If we go down
this pike," Mr. Bush asked, "where are we going to get the
energy if we have another oil shock? Wind? Come on. Solar?"
Mr. Bush didn't answer his own queries.</p>
<p>The long odyssey toward a decision actually began on an
airplane carrying presidential candidate George Bush to a
campaign event in California in October 1988. Campaign aides,
worried about staying on the right side of the environmental
concerns prominent in that hotly contested state, gave Mr.
Bush a draft of a speech in which he would declare that he
favored holding up drilling in both northern and southern
California for more study.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush called the aides to his cabin on the plane and
questioned taking such a stand. "Do we want to lock this in?"
he asked. But he was persuaded to do so.</p>
<p>Once he was in the White House, Mr. Bush tackled the
problem by turning to a time-honored method for putting off a
tough decision: He formed a task force, and called on it to
study proposed lease sales in both California and Florida
waters -- technically known as lease areas 91, 95 and 116.</p>
<p>But simply forming a task force on these sensitive issues
produced wrangling. Interior Secretary Lujan proposed that he
become chairman of the group and that the Environmental
Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration be given merely advisory roles. White House
aides were worried that under his configuration, Mr. Lujan
and Energy Secretary James Watkins -- both generally
considered to be pro-drilling -- would be the dominant forces
on the task force. So White House officials pressured Mr.
Lujan to include the EPA and NOAA as full members of the task
force, along with budget director Richard Darman.</p>
<p>The task force held hearings, read 11,000 pieces of mail
on the issue and even sent submarines to study the ocean
floor. But all this failed to produce a consensus, as was
apparent when the task force finished up a thick report and
gave it to President Bush at a White House meeting in
January. The report offered a wide array of options, which
aides say would have had the effect of delaying leasing a
year or two, five years or 10 years.</p>
<p>Mr. Bush wasn't satisfied with his choices, and he didn't
face any burning timetable for deciding. So he ordered White
House aides to go to work further defining options. More
papers went back and forth to the president, filtered through
his chief of staff, John Sununu, and it became clear that
what Mr. Bush was seeking was a way to slice the issue even
thinner -- a way to allow drilling in some parts of the
controversial areas while blocking it entirely in others.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, lobbying intensified on both sides of the
issue. In January, for example, Chevron Corp. Chairman K.T.
Derr, a politically active friend of the president, sent a
three-page letter saying he could understand delaying the
California lease sale for as long as five years, because
drilling there already has been slowed by state and local
concerns, but arguing that there wasn't any reason for a
delay in Florida.</p>
<p>Last month, Mr. Bush called the task force back in for
more deliberating, and met with the congressional
delegations. Finally, about a month ago, Mr. Bush got a staff
memo outlining a decision he liked.</p>
<p>All that was left was timing the announcement. Ultimately,
White House aides say, they decided to announce the
offshore-leasing decision, which they hope will satisfy
environmentalists, on the same day they unveiled a decision
to allow logging to proceed despite concerns about the
northern spotted owl, a decision environmentalists won't
like.</p>
<p>As is often the case with attempted compromises, Mr. Bush
didn't entirely please either side on the drilling issue. The
oil industry reacted with bitter complaints. "These decisions
on offshore oil and natural gas leasing are harmful to our
country and economy," the American Petroleum Institute
declared. "Locking up these energy-rich lands at a time when
our dependency on foreign energy is escalating is a serious
mistake."</p>
<p>The National Ocean Industries Association, an organization
representing the offshore-oil industry, declared that Mr.
Bush has "abdicated his responsibility to provide safe and
dependable energy supplies for the American people."</p>
<p>Oil companies with significant offshore investments echoed
the petroleum institute. Phillips Petroleum Co. said that
even though none of its current plans are affected by the
moratorium, it nonetheless is disappointed.</p>
<p>"The oil industry has shown it can drill and produce oil
offshore in an environmentally safe manner. . . . Not
developing U.S. offshore oil and gas reserves can increase
tanker traffic (for importing), a source of recent oil-spill
problems," Phillips said. The Bartlesville, Okla., company
earlier this year took a $280 million charge on its offshore
California investments where production has been stalled by
Santa Barbara-based citizens groups fearful of transportation
mishaps.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Chevron said, "Our initial reaction to
what we're seeing in news reports is that the president's
actions seem to go too far. We'll need to take a look at
what's actually been announced and study the details before
we have any more to say."</p>
<p>Environmentalists generally expressed pleasure, but also
chided Mr. Bush for not calling for a permanent drilling ban.
"These are just temporary, politically expedient steps," said
the American Oceans Campaign. "If the president sincerely
cares about the environment, he will join with those seeking
permanent protection for these and other important coastal
areas."</p>
