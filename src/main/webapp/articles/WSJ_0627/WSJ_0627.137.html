	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Yields on certificates of deposit at major
banks and brokerage firms were little changed in the week
ended Tuesday.
   Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold directly by
banks were mostly flat to down slightly. The average yield on
a one-year consumer CD remained at 7.85%, while two-year CDs
fell to 7.91% from 7.93%, according to an 18-bank survey by
Banxquote Money Markets, a New York information service.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While none of the banks in the survey offered a yield as
high as 9%, investors can still find consumer CDs at some
banks that yield that much or more.</p>
<p>Average yields on small-denomination CDs sold by leading
broker dealers were also little changed. Average yields on
six-month CDs eased to 8.15% from 8.17%, while average yields
on one-year CDs remained at 8.17%, according to Banxquote.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, average yields for large-denomination CDs,
which typically require deposits of $90,000 or more, were up
slightly. However, the gains are so slight that average
yields for most maturities are still below the levels of two
weeks ago. Average yields on one-year jumbo CDs rose to 7.94%
from 7.90%, while five-year maturities rose to 8.25% from
8.22%.</p>
<p>"Rates moved in a very narrow range,"said Norberto Mehl,
chairman of Banxquote. This is evidence, he said, of the
current retrenchment in the banking industry. "Banks are
under no competitive pressure to increase rates since they
don't need to attract cash to make new loans," This is
especially evident among banks in Texas and Florida, he said,
where average yields are the lowest in the country.</p>
