	<p class="article-leader">Your "Giving a Hand" column each Thursday is a welcome
reminder that it lies within the power of each one of us to
help others in need. Whether you are focusing on individuals
(your May 10 story on the scores of financial-community
professionals who contribute so much by helping the homeless
men residing at St. Paul's Chapel to become independent
citizens again), or on the efforts of corporations (your May
31 story on Lipton Co.'s effort to use its marketing and
promotional expertise to increase volunteerism in six cities
across the nation), your regular coverage offers hope and
encouragement to us all. Thank you.
