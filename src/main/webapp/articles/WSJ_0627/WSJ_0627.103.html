	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A promising investment-banking boutique led by
Lehman Brothers alumni has received a rude awakening to the
new order on Wall Street.
   Stamford Co., stung by a corporate-finance slowdown and
heavy trading losses, has scaled back its operations amid the
departure of several pivotal executives. The Stamford Capital
Group Inc. unit, created by Sheldon S. Gordon, former vice
chairman at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., has cut its staff
18% this year, and recently pared its new products and
trading operations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"To tell you the truth, {the securities industry} is as
slow as I've seen it since I've been in the business," says
Mr. Gordon, Stamford's chairman, who started his career on
Wall Street in 1959.</p>
<p>Stamford's experience underscores the difficulties Wall
Street's investment boutiques face these days. These
boutiques, many of them launched by top deal makers to focus
on small niches, have been hammered hard by the slump in
investment banking. Merger activity has fallen to its lowest
level in seven years, and deals that had been expected to
close within three months are taking nine months and more,
bankers say.</p>
<p>Just last week, Coniston Partners, one of Wall Street's
best-known boutiques, reined in its investment operations
sharply, and other small investment firms are believed to be
on the rocks.</p>
<p>Stamford Co., launched last year, is modeled after Wall
Street's traditional investment banking partnerships. Its
core partners, including James Boshart, president, and David
Stein, head of corporate finance, are all former executives
of Lehman Brothers, which was bought by Shearson Lehman in
1984. Stamford focuses on so-called middle market companies
involving transactions valued at between $15 million and $150
million. Stamford also manages about $500 million in investor
assets.</p>
<p>But the firm recently has run into increased competition
from bigger securities firms that earlier shunned middle
market transactions. With so few deals around, the big firms
are devouring whatever deals they can, including many smaller
ones, Mr. Gordon says.</p>
<p>At the same time, two top Stamford executives recently
jumped ship. Steven Kohlhagen, head of asset management, left
for AIG Financial Products, and John Brennan, chief
administrative officer, is launching a law practice in
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, three top traders also departed in the
wake of heavy losses from the October 1989 stock-market
slide. Stamford had trading losses of about $10 million in
the fourth quarter, largely stemming from the slide in UAL
Corp. shares.</p>
<p>As a result, Stamford has sharply cut back its trading. It
commits just $10 million of its approximately $70 million of
capital in trading, down from as much as $35 million several
months ago. It has halved its trading staff and slashed its
new products development.</p>
<p>Stamford has a staff of 70, down from its high of 85.
Before the prolonged corporate-finance slump, executives
planned to enlarge the firm to about 125. But Mr. Gordon says
now that he believes the securities industry's problems won't
be over for as long as four years.</p>
<p>Stamford made a splash last year when it hired a group of
Shearson Lehman investment bankers and worked out a joint
venture in which each firm will receive revenue from certain
transactions involving mid-sized companies.</p>
<p>Not all recent executive changes at Stamford have involved
departures. The firm recently hired Thomas Pickens as a
principal from Merrill Lynch & Co. Mr. Pickens will build up
the firm's effort in the $200 billion private-placement
market.</p>
