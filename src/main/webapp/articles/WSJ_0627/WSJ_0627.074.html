	<p class="article-leader">Alexander Cockburn (Viewpoint, op-ed June 14) rejects my
criticism of his representation of events in Israel, accusing
me of "truth-tampering." Let's look at Mr. Cockburn's
statements and sources.
   1. Citing an account on May 18 in the Israeli newspaper
Ha'aretz, Mr. Cockburn wrote that Gush Emunim leader Rabbi
Moshe Levinger was honored at a celebration at the West Bank
town of Elkana by senior Israeli military officials and
Israeli President Chaim Herzog before going to jail for
killing a Palestinian.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I pointed out (Letters to the Editor, June 4) that
Ha'aretz carried no such account of a celebration in Elkana
honoring Rabbi Levinger. The only function of the ceremony in
Elkana was the marking of the 13th anniversary of the
settlement's founding.</p>
<p>But Mr. Cockburn continued to cite the "report" in the May
18 Ha'aretz: "A substantial part of Gideon Levi's report in
Ha'aretz that day concerned the cordial relations visible at
Elkana between senior {Israeli} officials and Rabbi
Levinger."</p>
<p>In fact, the six-line passage concerning Rabbi Levinger in
Mr. Levi's 145-line article reported that the mayor of
another Israeli settlement hugged Rabbi Levinger and that two
senior Israeli military officials shook his hand, winked at
him or smiled at him. There was no other reference to Rabbi
Levinger. A handshake, a hug and a wink with a person who was
in attendance among the crowd of 5,000 at the ceremony have
become, according to Mr. Cockburn, a celebration honoring
Rabbi Levinger.</p>
<p>2. In his follow-up article, Mr. Cockburn wrote that at
the Elkana ceremony President Herzog wore "the symbolic
headwear of chauvinist ultra-right orthodoxy." President
Herzog wore a knitted skullcap, worn by modern religious Jews
throughout Israel and the world, regardless of political
ideology. Avraham Burg, a member of the left-of-center Labor
Party, wears the same headwear.</p>
<p>3. Mr. Cockburn wrote that President Herzog referred in
his speech to the Palestinians nearby as "foreigners." In
fact, Mr. Herzog referred to a particular passage from
Leviticus, which mandates Jews to treat the "ger" -- the
biblical word for non-Jewish neighbor -- with "love and
respect." Mr. Herzog then added, "I believe that the moral
commitment about the relationship with the "ger" is being
fulfilled in Elkana."</p>
<p>4. Citing a report in the May 13 Ha'aretz, Mr. Cockburn
wrote that Rabbi Moshe Neriya "enjoin{ed} every Jew `to shoot
Arabs left and right without thinking and without
hesitating.'" I pointed out in my letter that Mr. Cockburn
twisted Rabbi Neriya's statement, in the form of a letter,
into a call for mass murder. Rabbi Neriya actually wrote as
follows:</p>
<p>"As someone who has tasted the feeling of being under a
rain of heavy rocks, whose life was in danger, of being
killed or {sustaining} severe injury, I know how someone who
defends himself feels. . . . When you are attacked {by
murderers}, it is not the time to think but to shoot right
and left and bring about the dispersal of the murderers who
are upon you . . ."</p>
<p>In response, Mr. Cockburn again cited the May 13 Ha'aretz
and charged that I had "slyly substitute{d}" the rabbi's
quote with "a more decorous statement."</p>
<p>The May 13 Ha'aretz story, even though it contains only a
partial excerpt of Rabbi Neriya's letter, shows Mr. Cockburn
to be mistaken. The story specifically quotes from "a
document" written by Rabbi Neriya that, the reporter noted,
was "read to 100 rabbis":</p>
<p>"This is not the time to think but to shoot right and left
and bring about the dispersal of the murderers who are upon
you. . . . The arrest of Rabbi Levinger -- a public man who
did not come to murder and did not intend to kill -- is a
warning in all of us to get together and defend ourselves to
protest against the Attorney General and the State which tie
our hands and deny us the right of self-defense."</p>
<p>I called Dan Margolit, author of the Ha'aretz story and
asked him about the Neriya quote. Mr. Margolit told me: "I
wrote that Rabbi Neriya's words came from his letter in which
he said that one should shoot right and left if one is
attacked by rocks and feels endangered." Was this a call for
mass murder, I asked? "Absolutely not -- that's crazy," he
said.</p>
<p>5. Mr. Cockburn rejects my statement that Israel Shahak
has no more credibility on human-rights violations than
Lyndon LaRouche. Let me cite just several of the many public
declarations by Mr. Shahak in which Mr. Shahak has called
Jews "Nazis" who run "concentration camps" and has declared
that "Israel's policy is similar to Hitler's."</p>
<p>My central purpose in writing is not to defend Israeli
policies, but to correct the sloppiness in reporting about
Israel, in particular Mr. Cockburn's.</p>
