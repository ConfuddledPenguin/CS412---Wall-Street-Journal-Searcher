	<p class="article-leader">WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- Nynex Corp. said it was awarded
three cable-television franchises in the U.K. that represent
a potential total of 219,000 households and 10,800
businesses.
   Nynex, which got a relatively late start in competing for
U.K. cable properties, applied for a total of 23 franchise
licenses. Many of the choicest properties, including those
for metropolitan London and Birmingham, were grabbed early by
such rivals as Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. Only
four franchises remain to be assigned, and Nynex is bidding
for all of them.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In its announcement yesterday, Nynex said it was awarded
rights with its partner, Britannia Cablesystems Group Ltd.,
for the cable-TV franchise to serve England's Darlington
district, representing a market with about 34,000 homes and
1,800 businesses.</p>
<p>In addition, Nynex and Britannia won a pair of franchises
to serve a total of 24 small adjacent Surrey communities
south of London. These franchises represent about 185,000
residences and about 9,000 businesses.</p>
<p>Nynex, already a participant in three other successful
U.K. cable applications in the U.K., said its goal is to
attain 1.2 million potential cable and telephone customers
there. A Nynex official said the company expects to invest
about $160 million over the next six years to develop those
cable businesses.</p>
<p>Britannia is a partnership of several individual investors
in the U.S. and the U.K. with interests in cable-TV
operations and television programming.</p>
<p>Separately, Nynex disclosed that it was awarded two
contracts, valued at a total of $2 million, by Philippines
Long Distance Telephone Co. to provide certain
project-management services for at least three years.</p>
<p>In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Nynex shares closed at $82.25, up 12.5 cents.</p>
