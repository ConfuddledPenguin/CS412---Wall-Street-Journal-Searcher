	<p class="article-leader">National-Standard Co. said it completed the sale of its
South African unit, which will result in a third-quarter
charge of $2.8 million. Terms of the sale weren't disclosed.
   The unit, based in Uitenhage, was sold to Natstan
Manufacturing Ltd., a new, closely held South African company
formed by members of the management group of the subsidiary.
The Uitenhage operation makes tire bead wire and carbon steel
welding wire.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>National-Standard, a wire and metal products and machinery
manufacturer based in Niles, Mich., said the charge
represents the cumulative decline in the value of
National-Standard's investment in the South African company
because of foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>The company said the decline had been reported in its net
equity and now must be included in the statement of earnings.
The transaction has no effect on National-Standard's net
equity, company officials said. All proceeds will be used to
reduce National-Standard's level of borrowing.</p>
