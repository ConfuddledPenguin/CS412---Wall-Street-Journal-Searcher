	<p class="article-leader">Take a travelogue, combine it with a series of
reminiscences, throw in some sociological observations and a
couple of true confessions, and you will have a pretty clear
idea how Peter Conrad produced his most recent book, "Where I
Fell to Earth: A Life in Four Cities" (Poseidon, 252 pages,
$18.95). Mr. Conrad is an Oxford professor whose previous
books include a memoir about his childhood in Tasmania and a
book about opera. He divides his time between an apartment in
Manhattan's Greenwich Village, a renovated cottage in London,
his rooms at Oxford, and a house in Lisbon.
   Of the four cities he calls home, Mr. Conrad concentrates
most on New York, where he is able to indulge his
self-confessed voyeuristic impulses to the fullest. From the
window in his West Village apartment an array of peek-a-boo
images presents itself: a young woman writer, a boy who spray
paints his wall to look like spaghetti, and an
exhibitionistic male dancer in a cowboy costume who performs
a nightly striptease for anyone interested enough to watch.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A fascinated but guilty onlooker, Mr. Conrad compares
himself with Jimmy Stewart in Alfred Hitchcock's movie "Rear
Window." In the downtown nightclubs, at the annual Village
Halloween parade and on the everyday streets he spies on the
bizarre display of human nature surrounding him. New York, to
him, is merely a spectator sport.</p>
<p>At Christ Church College, Oxford, where Mr. Conrad teaches
English literature for part of the year, he is not quite so
disinterested an observer. He describes the careful college
rituals in which he is obligated to participate: At dinners,
"there is a strict league of seniority, which sometimes now I
am aghast to find myself at the top of . . . I have to mutter
a Latin grace which I can never get right." Sometimes the
rituals are obscure to the point of absurdity: Academics at
Christ Church have arbitrarily decided that the proper
college time is five minutes ahead of Greenwich mean time,
"so when we ring the bell and say grace, we take care to be
out of step with everyone else. What better evidence could
there be of England's anachronistic quaintness?"</p>
<p>If Oxford requires mature behavior according to a strict
code of rules, Lisbon is where Mr. Conrad goes to recapture a
childhood mood, "squeezed into vacations from adult
existence." At the home of friends there, he hangs around the
kitchen help, explores the neighborhood, is easily moved to
tears by a procession of the Virgin. He also likes his London
residence, a renovated cottage hidden from the street,
because it too resembles a child's playhouse: "Here is my
child's cabin, my fugitive's unlicensed hideout, my
observer's oblique periscope."</p>
<p>Mr. Conrad lives in four very different places, yet none
of them is quite a home. For him, after an adolescence spent
yearning to leave his parents' orderly, boring Tasmanian
house, "flight was always my ambition, my motive and my
motor." Though Mr. Conrad seems to want us to believe that a
life of running from one city to another is exciting, it only
seems sad. He is eager to play the role of the wistful
onlooker or the child who never grew up, but he never seems
able to be a full participant in any of the worlds he
inhabits. Perhaps without meaning to, Mr. Conrad tells us
more about his own inescapable melancholy than about the
charm and the novelty of travel.</p>
<p>Offering a far sunnier atmosphere is Peter Mayle's "A Year
in Provence" (Knopf, 207 pages, $19.95). Mr. Mayle and his
wife, Jenny, who are British, decided after many vacations in
Provence to buy a house near the Luberon mountains not far
from Avignon and to move in for good. This is a
month-by-month record of their first year, which they spent
renovating their 18th-century stone farmhouse with the help
of many local laborers.</p>
<p>The Mayles' year in Provence is full of small challenges:
trying to understand the "rich, soupy" local patois; heating
their large house; and moving a new stone table, weighing
about 800 pounds, from the driveway to their enclosed
courtyard. Then there is the problem of how to discourage the
scores of old friends who are eager to visit as soon as the
weather gets warm. Yet the Mayles, who seem to be an almost
impossibly genial couple, rise to every occasion with their
sense of humor intact.</p>
<p>They have lots of help, ranging from their
clarinet-playing plumber to the pool man, a dandy in
sunglasses and gray flannels. Apparently the Mayles had an
endless supply of money to pour into their investment, for a
good part of the year was spent employing the services of a
steady parade of contractors, masons, electricians and sundry
local experts including a certified chimney sweep. And there
always were neighbors on hand to supply extra advice; one of
them, Massot, is a crusty old eccentric who claims to eat
foxes (recipe included).</p>
<p>Though Mr. Mayle is not about to acquire a taste for fox,
he describes the more traditional Provencal food with
delight. This is, of course, a part of the world where
builders stop work promptly at noon to unpack a six-course
lunch and where everyone knows where to find the best
truffles or olive oil. The Mayles take their food and wine as
seriously as the locals, tucking into earthy winter feasts
and snapping up the first baby vegetables of spring in the
outdoor markets.</p>
<p>"A Year in Provence," like the many good meals its author
describes, offers fleeting but genuine satisfaction.</p>
