	<p class="article-leader">LAWRENCE, Kan. -- From early boyhood, when he was
enthralled by World War II movies, Gregory Sherman dreamed
about becoming an Army officer.
   Joining the National Guard while still in high school, he
later slogged through four years of drills and
military-science classes here at the University of Kansas.
Even a serious knee injury didn't quench the stocky history
buff's passion to win the gold bars of a second lieutenant.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Greg Sherman's martial dreams are now dead, one of the
earliest victims of budget cuts hitting the Pentagon. Like
many other students enrolled in the Reserve Officers'
Training Corps nationwide, he's learned that today's
shrinking Army has no room for him -- at least not as a
full-time, active-duty officer. Nudged by his commanding
officer, he dropped out of the program this spring. He even
stayed away from the ROTC's graduation ceremonies a few weeks
ago to avoid the pain of watching 20 beaming classmates pin
on those beloved bars.</p>
<p>"I still know, deep inside, that I'm good enough to be a
career officer," Mr. Sherman says ruefully. "If the Army was
flourishing, the way it was years ago under Reagan, I
definitely would have stuck it out. But the whole world has
changed."</p>
<p>Among the first places in U.S. society to really feel the
impact of the defense-budget cuts now taking shape are
college campuses. It's an ironic turnabout from Vietnam War
days, when ROTC instructors were reviled at many schools as
the ugly face of the military-industrial complex.</p>
<p>Now Uncle Sam is telling undergraduates he doesn't want
them. "Young people are graduating, but we can't bring them
on active duty because {the force} is getting smaller," Gen.
Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
complained in a speech last month. "I'm getting lots of
letters from parents who are disturbed by that."</p>
<p>Each of the armed services will need thousands fewer
officers in coming years, and the ROTC historically has
provided about two-thirds of those leaders. The Army faces
the deepest manpower cuts, and in just the past few months it
has quietly forced out about 900 active-duty colonels and
lieutenants.</p>
<p>But the easiest way to slim is to reduce intake, so among
the most prominent targets of the cutbacks are the 86,000
students enrolled at more than 1,000 American colleges and
universities. "This is a gut-wrenching process," concedes
Maj. Gen. Wallace Arnold, who runs the Army's cadet-training
command.</p>
<p>While the overall dimensions of the officer-training cuts
still aren't clear, the number of new Army ROTC graduates
assigned to active duty has dropped 25% from last year.
Shunning the less-valued, part-time reserve assignments,
about 1,000 would-be officers bailed out of Army ROTC
programs altogether in recent months. Many more are likely to
be encouraged to leave or be forced out in coming years as
standards get tougher, scholarship money dries up and ROTC
instruction is available at fewer schools.</p>
<p>"We simply don't have enough money to train all the
current cadets," says Col. Robert Kuhn, the ruddy, talkative
military-science professor who has been running the Army ROTC
program here at the University of Kansas, a pleasant campus
of high-rise offices and ivy-covered classrooms nestled in
rolling farmland. Already, he says, "Students are asking when
we're going to start kicking them out."</p>
<p>Ironically, all the post-Cold War changes haven't prompted
the Army's bureaucracy to issue formal orders to scale back
ROTC recruitment. So, while Col. Kuhn and his counterparts
struggle to push older cadets out of the program, the ROTC
instructors continue to be judged by how many new cadets they
sign up.</p>
<p>Col. Kuhn's second-floor window offers a good view of the
spot where some of the Midwest's angriest demonstrations
against the Vietnam War took place. These days, students here
and at dozens of other campuses are protesting the Defense
Department's ban against gay men and women. The outcry began
after three openly gay cadets from Harvard, MIT and
Washington University in St. Louis were dismissed from the
ROTC or denied commissions. Since then, various school
administrators have debated taking action against the ROTC.
The Army, which last Friday announced it plans to phase out
ROTC units at 50 campuses across the country by the fall of
1991, says the schools were chosen because they turn out the
fewest officers and not because of any involvement with the
protests.</p>
<p>Col. Kuhn, meanwhile, has been assigned to begin teaching
this fall at West Point, which, along with the other service
academies that traditionally turn out many of the military's
career officers, is expected to escape the brunt of the
cutbacks. But ROTC cadets don't enjoy the same powerful
protectors at the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Douglas Baskett, a mechanical-engineering major and
self-described "military fanatic," resigned from the ROTC,
with some faculty encouragement, just weeks before graduation
here. Some of Mr. Baskett's friends are now officers; but all
he has to show in the way of military achievement for his
countless mornings of marching, four years of studying
military strategy and a rigorous six-week summer camp is a
piece of paper certifying that he has successfully completed
"Army Military Qualification Standards Level I." Angrily, he
says: "Nobody should go through four years of such hard work
to be weeded out at the very end."</p>
<p>Paul Rocuant, a recent graduate of the University of
Connecticut, didn't wait to be pushed. Realizing that he
wouldn't get his first choice of an assignment in military
intelligence, the political-science major turned his back on
the military and enrolled in law school. "The entire Army is
surrounded by a cloud of uncertainty these days," Mr. Rocuant
explains.</p>
<p>Just to increase his chances of snaring an active-duty
assignment, Dane Childs, an athletic, gung-ho type at Kansas
State University, changed his major to history from
architecture. The gambit didn't work. Mr. Childs doesn't
discourage students from joining the Army ROTC, but says,
"It's an awful lot of sweat and effort for a crapshoot."</p>
<p>Even high-flying students are getting nervous. Here at the
University of Kansas, Jerry Rutherford, a pre-med student
with nearly straight A's, wakes at 5:30 a.m. almost every day
during the school year for extra training climbing ropes,
throwing grenades and speed-assembling M-16 rifles. Yet Mr.
Rutherford still worries about how cutbacks will affect his
future.</p>
<p>"Above all, my father urged me to be a realist," says the
20-year-old, whose grandfather was an Army general, and whose
father now holds the same rank commanding armored forces in
northern Germany. "He stressed how hard it's going to be, how
well you will have to perform to go active duty."</p>
<p>The stakes for ROTC cadets are higher these days -- and
mistakes more costly. Before graduating from Northern
Michigan University, Steven Bowman found out that the Army
rejected not only his bid to become an engineering
specialist, but also his hope of joining the active-duty
force. "I felt cheated on both ends," he recalls, and hastily
signed papers to quit the ROTC. But now the former cadet is
back in the Army reserves, still hoping to win a commission.
"For so many years, I fantasized about becoming an officer,"
Mr. Bowman explains. "A single month away from ROTC made me
realize how much I missed all the people and everything
connected with it."</p>
