	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- Tim Matheson and Dan Grodnik resigned as
co-chairman and co-chief executive officers of National
Lampoon, citing the previously announced sale of the humor
magazine to J2 Communications for more than $4 million.
   The resignations came as a surprise, because J2 had said
Messrs. Matheson and Grodnik would head the National Lampoon
division after the acquisition was completed. James P.
Jimirro, president and chief executive officer of J2, a video
producer and distributor, will oversee the operation of the
magazine.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Messrs. Matheson and Grodnik weren't available for
comment. However, a spokesman for the men said, "They have
guided the company through a transition, and I don't think
they fully planned to continue." He also said the magazine
has been losing money, and the sale to J2 "gave them an
opportunity to plug the leaks and bolster the value of their
stock."</p>
<p>After the merger, Messrs. Matheson and Grodnik will hold a
total of about a 30% stake in J2. Yesterday, J2 said it
signed a definitive agreement under which National Lampoon
shareholders will receive two-thirds of a share of J2 common
for each National Lampoon share. They will also receive a
warrant to buy one share of J2 at $3.50 or $3.75 each,
depending on the trading level of the stock.</p>
<p>In over-the-counter trading yesterday, J2 shares closed at
$2.625.</p>
<p>Mr. Matheson and Mr. Grodnik wrested control of the
magazine from Matty Simmons, the magazine's former editor,
chairman and largest shareholder.</p>
<p>The duo helped to increase advertising pages to 40 from 10
and brought back traditional advertisers such as Chrysler
Corp.</p>
<p>Mr. Jimirro, president and chief executive officer of J2,
is a former head of Disney Channel and Disney Home Video.</p>
