	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Whitman Corp. is negotiating to sell its
Hussmann Corp. commercial refrigerator manufacturing unit to
Sanyo Electric Co. for $500 million to $600 million,
according to people familiar with the talks.
   Sanyo, a maker of consumer electronics and appliances
based in Osaka, Japan, last week submitted the highest bid
for the St. Louis-based Hussmann unit, according to people
familiar with the bidding. However, even Sanyo's bid was
somewhat below Whitman's expectations, and Whitman must now
decide whether to proceed with the sale, the people said. In
addition, Whitman is trying to see whether any other bidders
will offer a price or terms for Hussmann that are more
attractive than Sanyo's bid. The exact terms of Sanyo's bid
couldn't be determined.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>A spokesman for Whitman said the company received bids for
Hussmann last week, but declined to identify the bidders or
comment on whether Sanyo was among them. "When a
determination is made as to the adequacy of the bids, we will
announce it to the public," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>In Osaka, a Sanyo spokesman said he had no information on
any talks with Whitman. The spokesman said the company's
policy is not to comment on mergers or acquisitions until
they have been arranged.</p>
<p>Whitman said in March it would explore the possible sale
of Hussmann to concentrate on its packaged goods and
soft-drink business. Whitman makes candies and owns the Pet
Inc. food manufacturer, a Pepsi Cola bottling operation and
the Midas International auto service shop franchiser.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley & Co., a New York investment banking firm,
has handled the Hussmann auction for Whitman. A Morgan
Stanley spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>The price for Hussmann could disappoint Wall Street
analysts, some of whom who had estimated that Hussmann could
command a price of more than $700 million. Lately, estimates
of Hussmann's price have been dropping, encouraged by
Whitman's management.</p>
<p>Joel Tiss, a conglomerate analyst at Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., said Whitman officials told him that after-tax
proceeds from the Hussmann sale "will range between $400
million and $500 million." He added: "Our own estimates say
it should be toward the lower end of that."</p>
<p>Mr. Tiss said that his original estimate of Hussmann's
pretax sale price was between $600 million and $800 million
but that the actual sale price "might be closer to $600
million to $750 million."</p>
<p>A Whitman official confirmed that the company's chairman
had told analysts recently that after-tax proceeds from the
sale would be between $400 million and $500 million.</p>
<p>David S. Moore, a conglomerate analyst at Donaldson,
Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., said he is expecting
Whitman to realize after-tax proceeds of about $525 million,
which he said implied a pretax sale price of "close to $600
million."</p>
<p>Mr. Moore said he is concerned that the sale of Hussmann,
which had a small loss in the first quarter, "might be bad
timing. We think strategically, it's a sound move, but we're
not convinced that the timing is absolutely perfect."</p>
<p>Sanyo is a major producer of refrigerators in Asian and
Pacific markets. Sanyo has a plant in San Diego that makes
small refrigerators and in 1986 bought a plant in Indiana
that makes large refrigerators for the consumer market.</p>
<p>Hussmann has about 40% to 45% of the market for
refrigerators and refrigerated display cases for supermarkets
and about 25% of the market for such equipment used in
convenience stores. In 1989, Hussmann had a profit of $60
million on revenue of $789 million.</p>
