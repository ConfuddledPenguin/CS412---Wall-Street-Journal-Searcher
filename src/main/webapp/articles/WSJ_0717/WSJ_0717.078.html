	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- As many as six million taxpayers will be
able to switch to a simpler form to file 1990 tax returns,
the Internal Revenue Service said.
   The IRS has added several new lines to its 1040A form so
that taxpayers may use it to report pension or annuity
income, payments from an individual retirement account,
taxable Social Security benefits, estimated tax payments or
credit for elderly or disabled citizens. In the past,
taxpayers reporting these items were required to use the
longer 1040 forms.</p>
