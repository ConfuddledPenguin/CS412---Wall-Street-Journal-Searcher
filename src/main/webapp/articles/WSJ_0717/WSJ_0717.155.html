	<p class="article-leader">CULVER CITY, Calif. -- MGM/UA Communications Co. said it
received a $53 million payment from Pathe Communications
Corp. as part of Pathe's revised $1.3 billion acquisition of
the once-mighty studio.
   Last month, Pathe and MGM/UA revised and extended the
$20-a-share proposed transaction, with Pathe agreeing to pay
MGM/UA shareholders an extra $1.50 a share. In the agreement,
$4 of the $21.50 is to be paid out by July 20 to holders of
record July 10.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Under the original tender offer, Pathe already had
deposited $200 million into an escrow account as a down
payment on the acquisition. The $53 million represents the
remainder needed to make the interim $4 payment to
shareholders, who will keep the money even if the deal
collapses. If it goes through, holders would get the
remaining $17.50 in October.</p>
<p>The prior agreement between the two companies had been
backstopped by a proposed $650 million loan by Time Warner
Inc. to Pathe. That agreement fell apart, Pathe and Time
Warner have sued each other, and Pathe is looking for new
sources of financing.</p>
<p>MGM/UA also said that according to a ruling by the New
York Stock Exchange, MGM/UA shares had been trading on the
basis of one share of stock plus a "due bill" of $4 since
July 3. It is expected that the stock will begin trading
"ex-payment" one business day following the payment date, the
company said.</p>
<p>The latest payment brings to $253 million the amount Pathe
has advanced toward the transaction since last March. Pathe
has also given MGM/UA a $75 million security interest in
three upcoming Pathe films. According to the revised
agreement, Pathe must deposit $50 million payments on Aug. 21
and Sept. 20.</p>
