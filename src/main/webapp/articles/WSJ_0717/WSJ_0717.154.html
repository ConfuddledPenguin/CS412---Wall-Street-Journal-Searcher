	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Nicholas J. DeMarco, head of Pierre Cardin
USA, said he was forced to resign his post after 12 years and
filed a suit against the Paris-based fashion design company.
   Mr. DeMarco's civil action, filed in New York State
Supreme Court, has been transferred to federal court in
Manhattan. The suit charges Mr. Cardin and his company,
S.A.R.L. de Gestion Pierre Cardin, with wrongful termination,
breach of contract, wrongful conversion of U.S. licensing
royalties and fraud. The plaintiff seeks compensatory damages
of "not less than $5 million" and punitive damages of "not
less than $5 million."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In an interview, Mr. DeMarco said that he has maintained
an "excellent relationship with Cardin" and speculated that
he was being forced to leave his post to "facilitate the
eventual sale" of Mr. Cardin's world-wide licensing business.
He said he has reason to believe the businesses were up for
sale but declined to elaborate. He said Mr. Cardin hasn't
returned numerous phone calls and messages.</p>
<p>Maxwell Stolzberg, a Manhattan attorney for S.A.R.L. de
Gestion Pierre Cardin, said: "Mr. Cardin has his own business
reasons for (Mr. Marco's) termination and it had nothing to
do with any sale of his business or licensees. . . . As far
as I am aware, the licenses are not up for sale. . . . The
contract that he had with the Cardin organization provided
for a termination on notice, and that notice was given."</p>
<p>Pierre Cardin's U.S. licensees encompass 32 companies that
manufacture women's, men's and boy's apparel, generating
about $201 million annually at wholesale prices, according to
Steve Weiner, chairman of the Pierre Cardin licensees in the
U.S.</p>
