	<p class="article-leader">Acknowledging that McDonnell Douglas Corp. "made some
mistakes in the course of our reorganizations," John
McDonnell, chairman, said the struggling aerospace giant will
eliminate 14,000 to 17,000 jobs, or at least 11% of its
world-wide work force, by year's end.
   The announcement by the nation's No. 1 Pentagon contractor
is by far the single largest layoff notice issued this year
by any aerospace concern, and it exceeded expectations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Many other aerospace companies, including Boeing Co.,
General Dynamics Corp., Lockheed Corp. and Northrop Corp.,
have also said in recent months they are scaling back their
work forces. But St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas, with
several military aircraft lines slated for termination and
manufactuing problems still dogging its commercial-airliner
business, finds itself in an especially dire situation.</p>
<p>Although it has a $27 billion backlog of orders for its
MD-80s and MD-11s, the company hasn't posted a profit at its
transport aircraft unit in Long Beach, Calif., since 1988;
excessive overhead has been much of the problem.</p>
<p>The bulk of the job cuts, part of previously disclosed
plans to slash $700 million annually from the company's cost
structure, will come at the Long Beach subsidiary, though
skilled assemblers and electrical workers may actually be
added to help with a brisk jetliner-delivery schedule.
Already, some 2,400 employees on the payroll have been laid
off there, and 1,500 contract personnel have lost their
assignments. By year-end, the goal is to trim a total of
8,000 jobs from the site, the bulk of them white-collar
positions.</p>
<p>Yet hourly workers still fear the worst. "People are
running scared," said Richard Rios, recently elected
president of United Auto Workers Local 148, which represents
nearly 20,000 of the rank and file at the Long Beach factory.
"A lot of new people here went out and bought homes, and now
they're wondering about their mortgages."</p>
<p>Peter Lazes, director of a Cornell University program that
is exploring how military suppliers can help their workers
adjust to the changing political environment, declared: "The
meltdown of the industry has begun."</p>
<p>Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. said
"additional {debt} rating declines are likely" for defense
contractors in the next three to five years, reflecting the
industry's slowdown. The Dun & Bradstreet Corp. credit-rating
unit made the prediction in a report on a study of 16 defense
contractors, including four European companies.</p>
<p>For some, though, announcement of the planned McDonnell
layoffs was anticlimactic. Late last week, rumors of bigger
events ran rampant through the company and the financial
markets; they included such speculation as the resignation of
Mr. McDonnell or a Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law filing. Although
McDonnell Douglas vehemently denied the conjecture and most
Wall Street analysts dismissed it as gossip, investors
yesterday were apparently disappointed that McDonnell Douglas
isn't doing more.</p>
<p>"When none of the speculation came to pass, it looks like
people just sold off," said Paul Nisbet, of Prudential-Bache
Securities. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading,
McDonnell Douglas shares closed at $42.50, down $2.375.</p>
<p>Besides the job reductions in Long Beach, about 4,500
slots will be eliminated in the St. Louis area, where
McDonnell Douglas builds jet fighters for the Navy and Air
Force. In addition, there will be retrenchment at other
facilities in Missouri, Southern California, Arizona and a
score of other states where McDonnell Douglas has offices and
manufacturing operations. The company's world-wide employment
is 135,000.</p>
<p>Mr. McDonnell explained in a letter to employees yesterday
that, while the company has taken a series of major steps to
curb costs in the past 18 monts, "we did not do enough to
establish the boundaries that would prevent excessive
duplication of functions and services, and we did not
exercise sufficient control over costs and staffing."</p>
<p>"It took us too long to recognize that we had too many
people on the payroll," Mr. McDonnell said, adding that "I
accept responsibility for the fact that we must take these
harsh actions now."</p>
<p>In addition to paring back jobs, Mr. McDonnell said other
moves will be taken to correct the company's "unsatisfactory
financial performance," which featured operating losses in
three of four quarters last year and a break-even result for
the first three months of 1990.</p>
<p>These actions include:</p>
<p>-- Temporarily reducing by 50% company contributions to
salaried savings plans, which had been matching 75 cents on
the dollar, in a bid to save as much as $60 million a year.</p>
<p>-- Shaving the capital budgets at each of the company's
seven divisions by an unspecified amount.</p>
<p>-- Making "significant cuts" in budgets for travel,
consultants, advertising and other support activities.</p>
<p>-- Restricting overtime payments to certain salaried
employees.</p>
<p>Mr. McDonnell reiterated that the $700 million in cost
savings -- about $12 a share in terms of earnings, according
to Prudential-Bache's Mr. Nisbet -- was necessary to
"generate and obtain the large amounts of cash needed to
fund" the MD-11 three-engine commercial jet. The wide-body
plane will cost some $2 billion this year to develop, and
many analysts have identified it as the key to restoring
McDonnell Douglas's financial health.</p>
