	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southmark Corp. said its plan to reorganize
around its San Jacinto Savings Association unit was confirmed
by a bankruptcy court judge.
   Under terms of the plan, creditors will receive $76
million in cash and a package of securities in the
reorganized Southmark, once a $9 billion real-estate and
financial-services conglomerate. Southmark shareholders also
will receive shares in the reorganized company.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Southmark will contribute $100 million in new capital to
troubled San Jacinto and will liquidate its remaining assets.
The plan will be put into effect in mid-August.</p>
