	<p class="article-leader">RED BANK, N.J. -- Fiber optics might sound pretty dull --
until Lanny Smoot introduces himself.
   Mr. Smoot sits behind a wall-size window here at Bell
Communications Research, rummaging through papers. He notices
visitors and stops to say hello. But his visitors would need
awfully long arms to shake his hand, because Mr. Smoot is
actually in Morristown, N.J., 55 miles away.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>His image is being projected through fiber optics, and
it's so lifelike that even skeptical reporters are startled
to find he's not simply sitting behind a pane of glass.</p>
<p>This might seem like video magic, but the uses of fiber
optics are neither far off nor far-fetched. Within just a few
years, fiber optics "is going to change the way we live and
the way we do business. It's going to completely transform
our world," says Stewart Personick, a fiber optics pioneer
and an assistant vice president at Bell Communications
Research.</p>
<p>Fiber optics could change television within a few years by
allowing more choices for more people and a much wider range
of video services. Telephone companies are testing links that
let doctors transmit X-rays and other diagnostic tests to
distant specialists for instant evaluations.</p>
<p>Another likely development: artificial-reality machines
that use remarkably crisp pictures and sound to "deliver" a
viewer to a pristine tropical beach, to a big football game
or to a quiet mountaintop retreat. Japanese researchers
envision golfers practicing their swings in front of
three-dimensional simulations of courses.</p>
<p>The spread of fiber optic networks could have profound
implications for where and how people live and work. As such
sophisticated communications become more commonplace,
business travel could be reduced. The efficiency of fiber
networks also raises the prospect that work forces won't need
to be so concentrated: Many employees will be able to
contribute to organizations without having to live in or near
big cities.</p>
<p>"Doctors could have world offices, not local offices. And
I could go on vacation -- or pick a vacation spot -- by
immersing myself in a different environment, stroll down the
streets of Barcelona or along a Caribbean beach," says Mr.
Smoot, an executive at Bell Communications Research.</p>
<p>The technology is so powerful that last month the Commerce
Department refused to lift its ban on exporting fiber systems
to the Soviet Union. Citing national security, the agency
rejected a plan by U S West Inc. to build a trans-Soviet
fiber network that would link Japan and Europe. At the same
time, however, the U.S. allowed shipment of older and slower
fiber technology to Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Even in the U.S., significant obstacles must be overcome
before the promise of fiber optics becomes reality. Phone
companies are finding it difficult to offer fiber
universally. Sharks like to chew on undersea fiber cables.
Bringing fiber to homes and small businesses is proving
especially tough. And fiber itself isn't a flawless
technology. For example, there's the challenge of keeping
phone service working when electric power goes out.</p>
<p>Underlying all these issues is a more fundamental question
of economics: whether there will be enough demand for fiber
services to justify speeding up construction of a nationwide
fiber-based broad-band network, conservatively estimated to
cost $250 billion.</p>
<p>Meantime, telephone companies and cable television firms
are battling over the vast potential market. Because so much
can be carried on fiber optic lines, phone companies could
use their lines for cable TV. But phone companies are
currently barred from the cable business, and cable companies
are working to make sure that doesn't change.</p>
<p>Fiber optics uses hair-thin strands of super-clear glass,
instead of copper wire, to carry conversations, images and
data. Whereas copper wire uses electrical impulses, fiber
optics relies on light to deliver the message.</p>
<p>A single fiber strand can transmit 16,000 phone
conversations at once, compared with 24 for the 100-year-old
copper wire technology.</p>
<p>It can transport symphony-quality sound, high-definition
television signals and fantastic amounts of data. And since
light travels a lot faster than electricity, the speed is
awesome: The entire text of the Encyclopaedia Britannica and
the Bible could travel around the Earth through a fiber cable
in less than two seconds.</p>
<p>"All of the voice communications and all of the data
communications today are but a tiny trickle of what could be
carried in the future," says Mr. Smoot. "We're sort of like
the blind who have never seen."</p>
<p>Over the past five years, American Telephone & Telegraph
Co., MCI Communications Corp., United Telecommunications
Inc.'s US Sprint and other long-distance carriers have
installed millions of miles of fiber optic cable. Small
telecommunications firms are building rings of fiber cable in
big cities. Local telephone companies are stringing fiber
between their major switching offices and conducting tests in
neighborhoods.</p>
<p>By most counts, much of the U.S. will be "glassed" by the
year 2015.</p>
<p>The idea of sending messages by light is as ancient as
signal fires. John Tyndall, a British physicist who explained
why the sky is blue, enlivened his lectures during the 1870s
by demonstrating that light can bend. He focused a beam
through a huge container of water with a spout near the
bottom. As the water shot out and bent with the force of
gravity, the audience could see light trapped within the
stream.</p>
<p>In the 1880s, Alexander Graham Bell proved that a light
beam could carry voice signals. And in the 1960s, when the
laser emerged from Bell Labs and scientists in England
advocated using ultra-pure glass fibers to transmit phone
calls, fiber optics jumped to the fast track.</p>
<p>Soon after, Corning Inc. developed glass so clear that if
oceans were made of it, the bottom of the Mariana Trench,
nearly six miles below the surface of the Pacific, would be
visible. In 1983, MCI placed the first commercial order for
90,000 miles of fiber cable.</p>
<p>These days, high-capacity fiber can dispatch 1.8 billion
bits of information a second over a single wispy strand of
glass. This is how: A transmitter containing a tiny laser
converts electrical signals that represent human voices,
computer data, text or pictures into modulated light waves --
flashes of ones and zeros -- for digital transmission. The
most sophisticated lasers, with a light source no bigger than
a grain of salt, blink on and off about one billion times a
second.</p>
<p>At the other end, a photo detector picks up the signal and
transforms the flashes back to an electrical signal that can
be reconverted to voice, data or video.</p>
<p>Several signals can be fed into the glass strand at the
same time and yet remain discrete even after traveling many
miles at top speed. Electrical signals, on the other hand,
tend to mingle after a short trip through copper wire. And
unlike copper, fiber can carry signals in both directions at
the same time.</p>
<p>One of the earliest benefits to come roaring down the
fiber autobahn will be crystal-clear video conferencing.
Consider Mr. Smoot's image. It is delivered over a large
rear-projection, high-resolution screen set into the wall.
Multiple camera angles give a panoramic view, leaving the
viewer with the impression of looking through a window.</p>
<p>Most video conferencing over phone lines today doesn't
provide full-motion pictures, so an executive's wave creates
a blur across the screen. The video switches that will be
part of the fiber optic network will let customers receive
full-motion movies and other video works on demand. The
switches will also let them send crisp, full-motion video
pictures. Parents could send videos of their children to
relatives across the country -- either tapes from last
Thanksgiving or a live birthday party.</p>
<p>Prototypes have been developed, but none is commercially
available. Much needs to be done before that happens.</p>
<p>More than four million miles of fiber optic cable have now
been laid across the U.S., much of it alongside railroad and
subway tracks. Even abandoned coal tunnels beneath the
streets of Chicago now provide a home for fiber cable. To
link continents, thousands of miles of fiber have been reeled
from huge boats. AT&T has its own fleet.</p>
<p>A month after a cable was installed in the Atlantic off
the Canary Islands five years ago, the connection went dead,
or "dark" in the parlance of fiber optics. Hauling the cable
up, technicians found shark teeth embedded in the casing. One
bite had shorted the cable. After three more outages,
technicians set about creating a Jaws-proof sheath.</p>
<p>The teeth didn't go to waste. They were set in a dental
mold and used to test designs.</p>
<p>The major deterrent to the spread of fiber is cost. Until
recently, it was far more expensive than copper. But before
long, fiber will cost less than copper because of
efficiencies and higher production.</p>
<p>Yet even though fiber is already beginning to make sense
economically for new construction and replacement -- some new
housing developments are being strung with glass instead of
wire -- ripping out copper before the end of its useful life
and replacing it with fiber is too expensive.</p>
<p>Another problem is keeping the phones working in a power
failure. The typical telephone receiver operates on
electricity. Because copper conducts electricity well, the
power for today's phone service comes over the phone lines
themselves, and the phones can even be powered by back-up
batteries in case of an outage. That's what happened in the
San Francisco earthquake. But glass fiber isn't an efficient
conductor of electricity, so phones might have to be powered
by the local electric company. If there were a local power
outage, there would be a phone outage, too. Phone companies
are considering alternatives such as backup batteries.</p>
<p>GTE Corp. is conducting the largest and most sophisticated
fiber trial in the U.S. to date. In Cerritos, Calif., the
company has joined the local cable operator to test a fiber
network that will connect up to 700 households. About 100
will receive telephone and TV signals over the same fiber
line. At the same time, the two are testing a coaxial network
for interactive video and pay-per-view movies.</p>
<p>Customers in some homes and a demonstration center at
GTE's Cerritos lab site will be able to send home videos back
and forth, as well as order up movies. Unlike in regular
pay-TV, viewers will have all the conveniences of using a
VCR: They will be able to stop the movie and watch the rest
of it later, to fast-forward through dull passages, or to
replay favorite scenes.</p>
<p>Across the country, about 50 small cities or developments
are being "glassed" for various phone-company trials.</p>
<p>But regulatory and social-policy questions remain to be
settled.</p>
<p>Phone companies want to reverse the 1984 Cable Act
provision that bars them from owning cable systems within
their territories. Phone companies say they can offer the
best check on skyrocketing cable fees: real competition.</p>
<p>Meantime, the Bells want Congress to ease some of the
restraints of the consent decree that broke up AT&T. The
decree bars them from many activities, including video
programming.</p>
<p>The Bells could transmit movies and other video fare as a
common carrier, but programming is where the big money is.
The Bells contend that, without a financial interest in
programming, they couldn't justify the expense of fiber.</p>
<p>"We need adequate earnings opportunities," says A. Gray
Collins, Bell Atlantic Corp.'s executive vice president of
external affairs. "The current form of regulation gives us no
reason to introduce new services and technology. We can't be
expected to build the network and not be allowed to benefit
from it." Without incentives, Mr. Collins says, many
customers won't get fiber until 2030 or so -- 20 years later
than is possible.</p>
<p>But many consumer groups think the phone companies are
asking far too much. Gene Kimmelman, legislative director for
the Consumer Federation of America, points out that many
information services don't rely on fiber, such as the masses
of electronic information that already crisscross the globe
on copperwire. And he questions why phone companies should be
allowed to accelerate the deployment of fiber when consumers
aren't clamoring for the extra features. Mr. Kimmelman
believes fancy services that can be delivered only over fiber
optics will eventually evolve, but he thinks the phone
companies have greatly overestimated demand.</p>
<p>"Why should we pay hundreds of billions of dollars to
accelerate investment when we already have an infrastructure
that can provide all these services?" asks Mr. Kimmelman.
"Fiber will come to the home when it is cost-effective."</p>
<p>The Bells claim there is little time to lose. They say
that strategic competitors such as Japan, Germany and France
are gaining the advantage by aggressively installing fiber
optic networks.</p>
<p>They worry that big corporations, the most lucrative
segment of the U.S. phone business, will continue to develop
their own networks -- which can be designed, built and
installed by foreign rivals.</p>
<p>The U.S. companies also argue that foreign telephone
companies could end up with more sophisticated networks that
could process transactions faster. That would attract
financial services businesses and other
telecommunications-intensive industries away from the U.S.,
they say.</p>
<p>Whether or not the U.S. gets in the game aggressively, Mr.
Smoot notes, fiber optics is on its way. "For the future,
what you're looking at is telepresence -- allowing me to be
where you are. Not just seeing you, but seeing all of the
things associated with you -- all the papers on the desk,
your PC, your whole environment," he says.</p>
<p>"This is a wave that is not possible to stop."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Corrections & Amplifications</p>
<p>ALTHOUGH LIGHT and electricity travel at about the same
basic speed, voice and data messages can be transmitted much
faster through light than through electricity in copper
wires. The reason is the much greater bandwidth of light,
which permits far greater capacity. In last Tuesday's
edition, the comparison of speeds was oversimplified.</p>
