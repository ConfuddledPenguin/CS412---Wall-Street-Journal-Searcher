	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- To help spread the risks of developing new
television shows, King World Productions Inc. announced a
public offering for an outside programming fund, Merlin
Program Capital Inc.
   King World said it filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to raise $36 million in an offering of 2,250,000
units at $16 each. Each unit includes one share of Merlin
common stock and one warrant to purchase a common share of
King World between March 1, 1992, and August 31, 1995. The
exercise price for the warrants hasn't been set yet.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Production and development costs for new shows will be
split 50-50 between King World and Merlin, the company said,
and each will share equally in net receipts, but only after
payment of distribution fees to King World.</p>
<p>Much like Walt Disney Co.'s Silver Screen partnerships,
King World's Merlin Program lays off some of the high risk of
developing new entertainment on outside investors. Like movie
partnerships, the investment is risky, however, and it
remains to be seen if investors will find syndicated
television shows as attractive an investment as movies. "I
wouldn't put any widows and orphans into this one," said one
Wall Street analyst.</p>
<p>The $36 million production fund is a blind fund that could
go into future shows of any sort, King World said, but to
start with, the Merlin money will help support two shows in
the works. One is "Only Yesterday," a weekday magazine-style
show is set to premiere this fall. The other is a series
based on the old "Candid Camera" show, which is still being
developed. King World said it has already spent about $2
million developing "Only Yesterday," and half that amount
will immediately be paid by Merlin after the closing of the
offering.</p>
<p>King World has been highly successful as a syndicator of
television shows produced by others, including the hits
"Jeopardy]" and "The Oprah Winfrey Show," but its track
record as a producer is too new to evaluate. One of its first
efforts, the syndicated tabloid show "Inside Edition" has
survived several seasons, though its ratings are modest.</p>
<p>And the current business climate is tougher now. As King
World said in the prospectus for the offering, "television
stations licensing programming for the 1990-1991 season are
generally less willing than they were in prior seasons to
acquire new programs."</p>
<p>When the offering is completed, King World said it will
own 1.5 million shares of Merlin preferred stock, which is
convertible into 40% of Merlin's common stock on a fully
diluted basis. King World said it will have the option to
purchase the Merlin shares being issued in the offering for a
four-year period beginning Aug. 1, 1993, but that option can
be exercised only if it purchases all the shares.</p>
