<p>CONTINGENT VALUE RIGHTS being issued on the American Stock
Exchange in connection with Rhone-Poulenc S.A.'s purchase of
a majority stake in Rorer Group Inc. are scheduled for August
distribution. Their maximum value at July 31, 1994, if Rorer
extends them one year, would be $54.12 each. Yesterday's
edition incorrectly stated the distribution date and maximum
value.</p>
