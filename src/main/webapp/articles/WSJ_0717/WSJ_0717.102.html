	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Pennzoil Co. said it intends to raise its stake
in Chevron Corp. to just under 10% by year end from its
current 8.8% stake.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Pennzoil said it would stop purchases slightly below the 10%
threshold to avoid triggering Chevron's poison pill plan.
Pennzoil said that, based on Chevron's recent stock price,
that would limit purchases to about another $291 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In San Francisco, a Chevron spokeswoman said, "We can't
comment until we have a chance to evaluate" Pennzoil's
filing.</p>
<p>Pennzoil, which first amassed Chevron shares late last
year as a "long-term investment," praised Chevron's recent
operating performance but was critical of what it views as
steps taken to "dilute" earnings and shareholder value.</p>
<p>Pennzoil's plans to raise the stake aren't surprising.
Pennzoil has indicated that it would invest in Chevron all
the $2.6 billion of proceeds it received from Texaco Inc. to
settle their mammoth legal dispute. So far, Pennzoil has paid
roughly $2.1 billion for about 31.5 million Chevron shares.
Chevron has 355 million common shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Analysts were puzzled at why Pennzoil would make its
filing now. "The timing is a little odd," said Frederick
Leuffer, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.
in New York. "Chevron's stock is up."</p>
<p>Chevron shares closed yesterday at $75.125, up $1.125, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Pennzoil bought
its other Chevron shares at an average price of $67 each.
Pennzoil finished yesterday at $79.625, up 50 cents, also on
the Big Board.</p>
<p>When Pennzoil disclosed its stake in December, Chevron
reacted swiftly by reducing the trigger point for its poison
pill to 10% from 20%. The company also filed suit against
Pennzoil, accusing it of misrepresenting its intentions in
its SEC filings. So far, Pennzoil has won most of the court
battles and a hearing is set for Sept. 14 to rule on
Pennzoil's request to dismiss the rest of the claims.</p>
<p>In a letter to shareholders, Pennzoil said that "Chevron
appears to be doing well in its efforts to improve its
operating performance," citing a number of asset sales and
plans for oil exploration in the Soviet Union. It was the
potential for improvement that enticed Pennzoil as a holder,
the company said.</p>
<p>But Pennzoil then appeared to raise the rhetoric against
Chevron management compared with previous disclosures in
which Pennzoil Chairman J. Hugh Liedtke went out of his way
to praise Chevron executives. In the shareholder letter, he
wrote, "Chevron's hostility is extremely disappointing to
us."</p>
<p>He cited concern about Chevron's Employee Stock Ownership
Plan, for which the company recently borrowed $1 billion.
Pennzoil also criticized a new management incentive plan in
which Chevron can award as much as 1% of its shares
outstanding each year to about 300 key employees. Pennzoil
said that with Chevron's stock price above $70, the value of
the plan this year could come to about $250 million.</p>
