	<p class="article-leader">The disintegration of the Soviet Communist Party continues
apace. At an ostensibly rebellious Party Congress, Mikhail
Gorbachev arranged to have himself re-elected General
Secretary, and secured a rubber stamp on his plans to reduce
the party's role. Then Boris Yeltsin, president of the
Russian Federation parliament, announced his resignation from
the party and dramatically strode out of the congress.
Gavriil Popov and Anatoly Sobchak, mayors of Moscow and
Leningrad respectively, followed him in resignation, as have
and will many others in the party rank and file. Now some
50,000 people assembled outside the Kremlin in opposition to
the party, and Mr. Gorbachev commanded it to give up its
total control of radio and television.
   The message is reaching even into the U.S. State
Department. Stopping in Ireland on his way to receive a
briefing on the Party Congress from Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze, Secretary of State Baker opined that the U.S.
government might actually start to talk to the likes of
Yeltsin-Popov-Sobchak if they get around to forming an
official opposition party. Maybe State will even succeed in
discovering that these three have all been voted into office
in popular elections, unlike Mr. Gorbachev and other
central-government officials.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev's new governmental architecture
raises some interesting questions of political authority.
Chief of State Gorbachev inherits the power taken away from
General Secretary Gorbachev. On paper, President Gorbachev
has far more power. The military and KGB now will report
directly to the president and will be less answerable to the
party. Party cells already are being removed from factories,
putting heads of enterprises directly under presidential
authority.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev will leave party duties to his
unprepossessing choice for deputy general secretary, Vladimir
Ivashko. The central committee's Politburo, once the supreme
power in the Soviet Union, will become a debating society. It
now will meet only once a month. Mr. Shevardnadze and other
key ministers saw no need to remain members.</p>
<p>Mikhail Gorbachev has chosen to try to rule the Soviet
Union through the presidency, rather than the party. But now
that he has created a dictatorial presidency, a question
arises: Will anyone do what he dictates? Clearly he has
cleverly positioned himself in anticipation of the party's
rapid decline, leaving open the possibility that he himself
can defect when the time is ripe. But where will he get his
political authority meanwhile?</p>
<p>He was not elected president by the people, but by a
Supreme Soviet carefully packed with Communists. He is not as
popular with the people as Mr. Yeltsin appears to be,
although Mr. Yeltsin's popularity probably derives more from
his anti-party campaign than from a widespread belief that he
can deliver the people from their misery.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev still will derive some authority from the
party -- until it withers away. Some will continue to come
from the Supreme Soviet, although this legislative body also
will suffer from the rising public anger at communism. That
will make Mr. Gorbachev more dependent on the military and
the KGB as he tries to maintain public order.</p>
<p>But the army and quite possibly the KGB as well are
themselves suffering deep inner divisions over who exactly
has authority. Generals of the army by and large supported
Communist hard-liners in the congress, but there is
increasing evidence that the rank and file leans toward the
reformers. Some of the rank and file, of course, come from
secessionist-minded republics and don't like anything
Russian. So when President Gorbachev issues orders, can he be
certain they will be obeyed now that party discipline in
these two powerful institutions has been weakened?</p>
<p>Some of those thoughts no doubt crossed Mr. Gorbachev's
mind when he watched Mr. Yeltsin walk out. That no doubt
explains why he reacted so bitterly. Perhaps he was tempted
to also shed the party albatross. But that he couldn't do.
Mr. Gorbachev will stay put and will need all his
considerable political skills to withstand the forces of
revolution now raging in the Soviet Union.</p>
