	<p class="article-leader">HANOI -- In his own quiet way, Nguyen Van Chan revels in
the fact that he has beaten the system.
   The system in question is that practiced by the Vietnamese
Communist Party in this nation of 66 million. Like all
totalitarian systems, it is at times tyrannical, abusive and
arbitrary. Despite extensive political, social and economic
reforms it remains a system of men and caprice rather than
one of institutions and principle.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Chan, 65, is one of its better-known victims. The
majority of the tormented have remained anonymous, suffering
out of sight. But for various reasons, though mostly luck,
Mr. Chan became a cause celebre at home and abroad, and that
accounts in large measure for his success against the system.</p>
<p>Largely uneducated, Mr. Chan has an entrepreneurial flair,
but he had the misfortune to try to put his natural business
instincts to work in Hanoi at a time when socialist
principles required everyone to live equally, usually in
poverty.</p>
<p>First, he invented a fountain pen that he and his family
produced from plastic waste. Later, he marketed glue that he
developed to enable him to make rubber sandals. Both his pens
and his glue were immensely popular, for the simple reason
that they worked better than what came off the government
production line.</p>
<p>For his troubles, Mr. Chan was jailed three times between
1960 and 1974. His operation was properly registered and used
only scrap, yet he was accused of conducting illegal business
and possessing illegal materials. On one occasion he was held
for three months without being charged.</p>
<p>Undeterred, he graduated to heavy-duty bicycle tires,
finally producing one that, once again, easily outlasted its
state-produced rival. By 1982, he was selling thousands of
tires. Newspapers published articles about him, and he was
widely hailed as "the tire king." His efforts earned a gold
medal at a national exhibition -- and attracted renewed envy
and attention from local authorities.</p>
<p>In familiar fashion, district police in 1983 descended on
Mr. Chan's suburban home, which he and his large family used
as both residence and factory, and demanded proof that the
house and equipment were his. "When I proved that everything
was legal, that was the first time that they lost and I won,"
he says.</p>
<p>Invited to the district police station, he was required to
explain the production process step by step, supposedly to
show whether he was a real working man or an exploiter. "When
I showed it was from my own brain, they lost for the second
time," he says.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a few days later the police accused him of
stealing electricity, acquiring rubber without permission and
buying stolen socialist property. Warned that he was to be
jailed again, he fled to the countryside while firing off
protests to higher authorities. His family was given only
three hours to leave before the house and contents were
confiscated.</p>
<p>After six months on the run, Mr. Chan learned that the
order for his arrest had been canceled. He rejoined his
family in January 1984 and began a long struggle for justice.
Mr. Chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987 when an
investigative reporter, capitalizing on reforms then being
introduced, got Mr. Chan's story published in a weekly
newspaper. In 1988, 18 months after the Communist Party's
sixth congress endorsed family-run private enterprise,
district authorities allowed him to resume work, but they
released only one of his machines, and they didn't return his
rubber stocks or his house.</p>
<p>Although he was invited back to display his products at a
national exhibition in late 1988, and many of the country's
leaders stopped by his stand to commend his achievements as
an example of private initiative, he wasn't satisfied. He
wanted his property -- and his "dignity" -- back.</p>
<p>When I met Mr. Chan at his son's home in Hanoi in April
1989, he was about to mount his bicycle to deliver yet
another petition to district officials. His wife was in
tears, and fearful of the consequences. But a determined Mr.
Chan assured me, "I will win. They will lose a third time."</p>
<p>Finally, after seven long years, he did triumph. Early
this year, newly installed district officials handed back his
house keys, apologized for the misdeeds of their predecessors
and promised to pay him 200 taels of gold valued at $90,000
for irrecoverable stock and personal possessions.</p>
<p>Now his business is flourishing, with branches in Ho Chi
Minh City. His company is turning out motor bikes as well as
bicycle tires, and starting to generate big profits with
heat-resistant rubber belts for use in electricity
generators. Other new products on the way include tires for
small cars.</p>
<p>For the benefit of those who weren't around to share his
moments of victory, Mr. Chan has made a video that shows his
family's return to the house, which the authorities had used
as a health clinic. Neighbors greet them with exploding
firecrackers, and help them clean the yard and scrub interior
walls and furniture.</p>
<p>One of the first things Mr. Chan did when he settled in
was to throw a party for all his friends who had stood by him
in his darkest hours. In the video, he introduces them to the
camera: This one hid him from the police; that one allowed
her place to be used as a mail drop so that he could keep
contact with his family while on the run.</p>
<p>If Mr. Chan's experience has led him to question the
system that he has battled for half a lifetime, he stays
silent about it. He is philosophical. "I am fortunate," he
says. "The wheel of history keeps turning."</p>
