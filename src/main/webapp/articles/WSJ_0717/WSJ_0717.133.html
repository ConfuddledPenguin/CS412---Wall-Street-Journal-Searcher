	<p class="article-leader">Cooper Cos., New York, has bought the shares of its
preferred held by Cooper Development Co. for $6.4 million and
is discussing buying the rest of the shares, which are held
by a third company.
   The buy-back, 183,591 shares at $35 each, from Cooper
Development will boost net income attributable to common
because it cuts the dividends Cooper Cos. pays on the
preferred. The shares yield 12% quarterly, payable in
additional preferred.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Cooper Cos., a manufacturer of optometric and ophthalmic
products, and Cooper Development -- two independent concerns
-- were subsidiaries of Cooper Laboratories Inc. until they
were spun off before the liquidation of their former parent
in 1985. Cooper Cos. was based in Palo Alto, Calif., until
January 1990.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman said Cooper Cos. is also discussing the
possible buy-back of the 500,000 remaining preferred shares
from another former Cooper Labs subsidiary, Cooper Life
Sciences Inc. Cooper Development and Cooper Life Sciences are
based in Mountain View, Calif.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Cooper Cos.
common fell 12.5 cents a share to $4.</p>
