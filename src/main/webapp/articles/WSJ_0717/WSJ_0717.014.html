	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- American Telephone & Telegraph Co. plans to
increase by the end of the month its charges for several
long-distance communications services to businesses.
   AT&T's price boost, when it becomes effective July 27,
will amount to a 2% overall increase in rates for two
outbound-calling services sold to businesses and a 0.5% boost
in the monthly bill for business customers who use multiple
AT&T services, the company said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>That boost, while small, would be one of the most
significant since the Federal Communications Commission last
year changed its method of regulating the company's profit
from long-distance service.</p>
<p>The FCC used to make AT&T set its rates according to its
costs of delivering service. Now the commission sets a "price
cap" on what AT&T can charge. The idea is to motivate AT&T to
cut its costs of delivering service, thereby allowing
customers to benefit from lower pricing while AT&T gets to
keep more of what it makes on each call.</p>
<p>Since late 1989, the company has increased certain flat
fees, such as private-line hookups and consumer calls to AT&T
operators. The latest increase would apply to so-called usage
charges covering the time of day a call is made and the
distance it travels.</p>
<p>AT&T, which is expected to announce lower second-quarter
earnings later this week, derives more than 50% of its
revenue from long-distance service and, with a more than 65%
share, dominates the U.S. market.</p>
<p>The company said the price increases will affect about 8%
of its business customers, and are being made to cover
increased costs of installing new digital equipment and
backup systems in its network, inflation and other
unspecified costs.</p>
<p>"Over the past five years we've lowered {overall
long-distance} prices by 45%. Now we're talking about a 2%
bump," said a company spokeswoman. "It's fine-tuning to
maintain our service {profit} margins."</p>
<p>AT&T estimated that it has reduced outbound-calling prices
for businesses by 32% since 1984. It said the "price-cap"
formula by which it sets its pricing would be adjusted to
show an additional $46 million in annual revenue this year
compared with 1989, because of the latest pricing change.</p>
<p>Specifically, pricing increases will apply to a customer's
network usage, including time-of-day charges and the distance
that a call travels between two points, said AT&T. The
affected services are AT&T Software Defined Network Service,
or SDN, and several plans within the AT&T PRO WATS
long-distance service.</p>
<p>For example, a six-minute call between San Francisco and
Washington using PRO WATS service will increase to $1.52 from
$1.49 today. A five-minute daytime call between Chicago and
Denver over AT&T's SDN network will climb to 97 cents from
the current 95 cents.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, AT&T closed
at $37.125, unchanged.</p>
