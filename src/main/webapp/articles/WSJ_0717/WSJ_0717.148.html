	<p class="article-leader">Anchor Savings Bank definitively agreed to sell $400
million of deposits at 18 of its Georgia branches to the
Trust Co. of Georgia unit of SunTrust Banks Inc.
   Terms weren't disclosed, but the sale price will be
released in public filings later, said John V. Brull, Anchor
senior vice president and chief financial officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The savings bank has said that shedding its Georgia
interests is part of its plan, approved by regulators in
mid-April, to comply with new thrift-capital standards.
Anchor wants to concentrate on the New York metropolitan
area.</p>
<p>Trust Co. takes over the checking, savings and certificate
of deposit accounts of Anchor's branches in Fulton, DeKalb,
Douglas, Cobb, Gwinnett and Chatham counties. Trust Co. won't
take over the real estate and leases, and Anchor will seek
other buyers for them, Mr. Brull said. Anchor also will
retain the unsecured loans from those branches in its
portfolio.</p>
<p>Anchor, which entered the Georgia market in 1982, has six
other branches in the state. Anchor has agreed to sell one of
them to Home Federal Savings Bank of Atlanta and is close to
a sale agreement on another, Mr. Brull said. The four others
are for sale.</p>
