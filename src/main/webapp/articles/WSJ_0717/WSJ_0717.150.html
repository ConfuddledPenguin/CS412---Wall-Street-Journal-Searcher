	<p class="article-leader">As if the asbestos litigation against the Manville Corp.
personal-injury trust wasn't tangled enough, now judges
handling the thousands of cases appear to be squabbling over
turf.
   Two weeks ago, U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein, of
Brooklyn, N.Y., urged lawyers involved in the cases, which
allege injuries resulting from exposure to asbestos, to
consider consolidating all the cases nationwide into one
courtroom, presumably his.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But Judge Weinstein never issued an official order that
would call for such a consolidation.</p>
<p>Late yesterday U.S. District Judge Thomas D. Lambros of
Cleveland did.</p>
<p>In what some lawyers are calling a pre-emptive strike
against Judge Weinstein, Judge Lambros ordered the
establishment of a single national class of claimants in all
asbestos-related personal injury cases.</p>
<p>In a class-action suit, typically all similar claims are
tried together, instead of separately, with several named
plaintiffs standing in as representatives of the entire
class. Damages are generally awarded under some sort of
formula devised for the particular case.</p>
<p>The virtue of a class action is that, at least
theoretically, the available money for damages is divided in
such a way that every plaintiff gets his fair share. In
contrast, when the cases are tried separately, the first
plaintiffs to win judgments can deplete the defendant's
resources, leaving nothing for any other claimants.</p>
<p>Judge Lambros's order effectively prevents any other judge
from consolidating the cases in any other court at this time.
Judge Lambros, the chief judge of the Cleveland federal
courts, presides over 7,000 asbestos-related cases involving
more than 13,000 individuals' claims. As a practical matter,
the judge's surprise move could induce the federal
administrative office of the courts to step in as a referee
and decide where the cases should be tried.</p>
<p>The move by Judge Lambros follows increasing problems with
the Manville trust, set up by Denver-based Manville in 1986
to pay the company's asbestos personal-injury claims. The
trust is a defendant in nearly 100,000 cases before 500 state
courts and in each of the nation's federal jurisdictions. In
recent weeks, it has come under fire because of its huge cash
shortfall.</p>
<p>Last week, Judge Weinstein gave the Manville trust until
Aug. 6 to restructure its financing and to change the way it
pays asbestos victims. He issued a temporary stay barring the
trust from paying any settlements, judgments, trustees' fees
or plaintiffs' attorneys fees until the changes are made.</p>
<p>The move worried the community of attorneys representing
the claimants. They said they were concerned that Judge
Weinstein, who is known to favor giving as much money as
possible to the claimants, would cut the attorneys' fees to
the bone if he gained control of all the cases. Indeed, Judge
Weinstein, in suggesting consolidation, indicated that his
biggest concern with the current tangle of cases was what he
considered to be runaway attorneys fees.</p>
<p>Judge Weinstein declined to comment late yesterday, as did
a representative for the Manville trust. Some plaintiffs'
attorneys predicted that Judge Lambros's order would be
appealed.</p>
<p>Individuals familiar with the situation said that last
week some plaintiffs' lawyers met in Chicago to discuss their
concern that Judge Weinstein might be ready to certify a
national class of claimants and bring the cases to Brooklyn.</p>
<p>One of the individuals said the attorneys decided to seek
out judges who they believed were more lenient toward
plaintiffs' attorneys and try to get them to take control of
the cases. Judge Lambros was said to be one of these judges.
Judge Lambros couldn't be reached for comment last night, but
he is understood to have denied any undue pressure.</p>
<p>In his order yesterday, Judge Lambros said the asbestos
litigation meets the criteria for creating a single class
action because "it has become apparent to judges managing
these cases that there are insufficent funds among all of the
defendants to pay all meritorious claims and all the costs
associated with processing the claims through the judicial
system."</p>
<p>Lawyers contacted late yesterday expressed some
uncertainty about the precise meaning of certain aspects of
the order. While he called for a national class action, the
judge also established "subclasses" for existing cases. Some
lawyers interpreted this to mean that those cases already on
trial dockets in the nation's courts should remain where they
are.</p>
<p>The order said the largest concentration of cases
involving asbestos claims is in Judge Lambros's court.</p>
<p>The judge also said the only group that could veto his
order was an ad hoc committee of judges with the largest
asbestos dockets. The group met for the first time at the end
of June.</p>
