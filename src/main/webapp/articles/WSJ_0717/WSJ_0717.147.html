	<p class="article-leader">TAMPA, Fla. -- Florida Federal Savings Bank, embroiled in
a two-year investigation of its student loans, agreed to pay
the U.S. $17.9 million as part of a civil settlement.
   The settlement, disclosed by a U.S. attorney in Florida,
covers "false claims" filed with the Department of Education
by the thrift under the Guaranteed Student Loan Program. That
program makes low-interest loans available to students for
college expenses.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1988, Florida Federal, St. Petersburg, Fla., came under
scrutiny for allegedly filing as many as 17,000 fraudulent
insurance claims on $35 million in government-backed student
loans. The investigation helped spark a management shake-up
that resulted in the resignation of the thrift's chairman.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Florida Federal was fined $2,150,000
after its conviction on charges, including conspiracy and
filing false claims, related to the student-loan case. Two
former officers were also convicted of falsifying statements,
and a third has been indicted on several charges and awaits
trial.</p>
<p>Florida Federal has also agreed to correct the records of
students whose credit standing was hurt by the fraud
committed by Florida Federal, the U.S. attorney's office
said.</p>
<p>In St. Petersburg, Florida Federal officials couldn't be
reached.</p>
