	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Daiwa Securities Co., one of the top four
brokerage houses in Japan, is planning to set up a securities
company in Budapest in a joint venture with Hungary within a
month, a Daiwa official said.
   The new company will be capitalized at about $10 million,
of which Daiwa will take up more than 50%. The rest will come
from the National Bank of Hungary and the Hungarian Foreign
Trade Bank.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Hungary, which is undergoing privatization of
government-owned companies and which reopened the Budapest
Stock Exchange on June 21, needs know-how on every aspect of
the securities business, the Daiwa official said.</p>

underwriting of stocks issued by privatized Hungarian
companies, research and gathering information.</p>
