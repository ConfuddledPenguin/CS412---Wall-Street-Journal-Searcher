	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Business inventories rose slightly in May,
the Commerce Department reported, but they were outpaced by
an increase in sales.
   Inventories of retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers
rose to $799.40 billion in May, up 0.4% from $796.05 billion
in April. Sales reached $538.33 billion, up 0.9% from the
April figure of $533.60 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Inventories equaled 1.48 months' sales in May, meaning it
would take companies just under 1 1/2 months to sell off
their inventories at the month's buying pace. The ratio was
down slightly from April's 1.49 but was higher than March's
1.47.</p>
<p>Total sales rose on the strength of the manufacturing and
wholesale sectors, with retail sales down 0.6%. Analysts saw
little encouragement in the sales figures. "I don't think the
sales rise signals a rebound in this economy," said Gary
Ciminero, chief economist for Fleet/Norstar Financial Group
Inc.</p>
<p>Automobile inventories were down slightly in May,
prompting some apprehension about the rise in non-automotive
inventories. "There is some concern about inventories going
up outside of automobiles," said Daniel Friel, economist for
NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C. "Those inventories have gone up
enough to be of some concern."</p>
<p>All the numbers were adjusted for seasonal variations.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of the Commerce Department's report on
business inventories and sales in May. The figures are in
billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted:</p>
