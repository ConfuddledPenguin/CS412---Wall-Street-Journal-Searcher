a $12-a-share bid from ISS International Service System AS,
Copenhagen.
   ISS AS seeks to acquire the remaining 1.3 million shares,
or 36%, it doesn't already own of the New York-based
building-maintenance services company. An ISS International
Service System official said that the company hopes to have a
special stockholder meeting in September to act on the merger
agreement.</p>
