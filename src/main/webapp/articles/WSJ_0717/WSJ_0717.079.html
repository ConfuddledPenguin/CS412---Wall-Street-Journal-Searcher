	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- One crisp morning last October, eight federal
agents burst through the front door of Martin Heydt's garden
supply shop, seizing cartons of records, client lists and two
computers.
   "It was bizarre," recalls Mr. Heydt, owner of Worm's Way
in Bloomington, Ind. "I guess because we advertise in High
Times, they thought we must be guilty of something."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Indeed, the Drug Enforcement Administration last year
searched several of High Times' advertisers, among other
concerns, during a nationwide raid called Operation Green
Merchant. And like Mr. Heydt -- who was never charged with
anything -- many dropped their ads in the magazine shortly
afterward. Since then, High Times says its ad revenue has
dropped by a third.</p>
<p>For High Times, a $3.95-a-copy monthly magazine devoted to
marijuana smokers and growers, the raid was yet another salvo
in the government's war on drugs. In May, a federal
prosecutor in New Orleans subpoenaed the magazine and three
of its staff members to testify before a grand jury
investigating High Times for conspiracy to distribute drugs.
High Times "is against everything we stand for," says Steven
Cummings, deputy DEA chief of cannabis investigations.</p>
<p>To many others, too, High Times is a blatant snub of the
"Just Say No" campaign. It features, for instance, centerfold
photos of primped marijuana buds, as if shot for the local
garden-club calendar.</p>
<p>Today, jittery advertisers shunning the magazine still
fear another DEA raid. High Times says circulation has
dropped to 250,000 copies a month from a peak of 405,400 in
1976. Canada even banned the sale of High Times last year. If
not for "government harassment," groans High Times editor
Steven Hager, "we'd be hundreds of pages, thick with ads."</p>
<p>But once again the magazine is fighting back. Once the
streetwise source of hard-drug articles and counterculture
news, High Times is going "green." It now advocates
environmentally sound uses of the hemp, or "Cannabis sativa",
plant, the source of marijuana buds. For instance, paper can
be made from the plant stalks and methanol oil can be
extracted from seeds to make "marijuana methane."</p>
<p>Says a High Times subscription pamphlet: "The good news is
we've found a plant that can save the world. The bad news is
that it's illegal."</p>
<p>A recent ad offers shirts and shorts made from hemp:
"Stoned Wear. A new line of hemp clothing and products from
Sativa Creations." The magazine is even delivered in black
"environmentally safe cornstarch bags" to ensure privacy.</p>
<p>High Times has always printed studies and reports touting
what it contends is the relative safety of smoking marijuana.
It also likes to remind readers that American colonists,
including Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and George
Washington, devoted many acres to hemp grown for cloth, rope
and heating oil.</p>
<p>The grand jury investigation is continuing, focusing on an
ad for a marijuana seed catalog by the Seed Bank in Amsterdam
that runs frequently in the magazine. The investigation into
Trans-High Corp., the magazine's parent company, is being
headed by U.S. Attorney John Volz.</p>
<p>"It's as if there's not enough crime out there, so he {Mr.
Volz} is creating more," says Michael Kennedy, an attorney
for High Times since its start. "It's all designed to get him
headlines."</p>
<p>Mr. Kennedy, who is also the attorney for Ivana Trump,
plans to raise First Amendment objections. "More important
than the fact they're actually trying to suppress information
is their attempt to chill the effort to publish," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Kennedy in June tried to quash the subpoenas on those
grounds, but his motion was denied by a federal judge.</p>
<p>Many parents and drug-abuse groups would like to stifle
High Times. "To the average person . . . High Times is
shocking and unbelievable," says Billie Avery, executive
director of the National Federation of Parents for Drug Free
Youth. "It has no value for the American family."</p>
<p>Potential readers are clearly there. In the past 10 years,
as the DEA has stepped up border patrols, domestic marijuana
growers have seen an opportunity. Last year, the DEA
eradicated 130 million plants vs. 39.2 million in 1985.</p>
<p>With domestic policing of fields, indoor growing is also
on the rise. The magazine's house botanist, Ed Rosenthal,
answers readers' queries in the "Ask Ed" column. A recent
reader asks: "In a two-bedroom apartment, will six 1,000-watt
halides {grow lamps} draw so much power that it will be
suspicious?" The column gives monthly awards of "Bud of the
Month" or "Garden of the Month."</p>
<p>But, says the DEA's Mr. Cummings, "There are U.S.
attorneys looking into the `Ask Ed' column, on possible
charges of aiding and assisting in the growth of an illegal
product."</p>
<p>Other High Times features include High Witness News and
Trans-High Market Quotation, which gives readers, as well as
federal drug agents who subscribe, a quality index and street
price of marijuana throughout the country. For example, the
word on Houston Homegrown: "Takes four joints to get high;
not worth the money or the headache -- $20 {per} 1/4 oz."</p>
<p>Tom Forcade, an underground journalist and member of Abbie
Hoffman's Youth International Party, started High Times in
the summer of 1974. Soon ad money rolled in and readership
surged.</p>
<p>In 1978, Mr. Forcade committed suicide. Since then, the
magazine has watched profits ebb and flow. In the early
1980s, the magazine advocated the legalization of all drugs,
including cocaine and heroin, which caused much internal
debate over editorial mission.</p>
<p>Today, it has dropped hard drugs in favor of focusing on
what is "accomplishable" with the marijuana plant. With a
staff of about a dozen, High Times now interviews the few
political advocates of legalization, such as Kentucky
gubernatorial candidate Gatewood Galbraith. Cartoons,
commentary and stories on local pot and hemp rallies fill the
pages, too.</p>
<p>"We'll be watching," says the DEA's Mr. Cummings.</p>
