	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- A First City Bancorp. of Texas shareholder
filed suit in federal court here charging the bank holding
company and others with misleading investors about the health
of its loan portfolio.
   The lawsuit, filed by Jerry Krim of Arlington, Va.,
alleges that First City, several officers and directors, and
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp., the company's
investment banker, made excessively optimistic statements
about First City's prospects in proxy materials issued in
connection with a federally assisted bailout of the company
in 1988, as well as in subsequent annual reports. Donaldson
Lufkin is a unit of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the
U.S.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The complaint accuses the new management team of A. Robert
Abboud, chairman and chief executive officer, of failing to
disclose "the true extent to which (First City's) loan
portfolio was composed of high-risk loans to debt-laden
companies who were having difficulties meeting cashflow
projections."</p>
<p>In recent months several such loans have been placed on
nonperforming status, contributing to what First City says
will be a decline in second-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>The plaintiff, who is seeking to have the lawsuit granted
class-action status, requests unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages.</p>
<p>Neither First City nor DLJ would comment on the complaint.
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange
yesterday, First City shares closed at $21.25, down $1.75.</p>
