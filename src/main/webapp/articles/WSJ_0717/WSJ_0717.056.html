	<p class="article-leader">International Business Machines Corp. reported a solid
5.2% increase in second-quarter earnings, the first time
since the mid-1980s that the company has put together
respectable quarters back to back.
   "While first-half results are encouraging, much remains to
be done this year," IBM Chairman John Akers said in a
statement that was slightly more measured than the one that
accompanied the first-quarter earnings report.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>IBM did exceed securities analysts' expectations for the
second consecutive quarter, reporting net income of $1.41
billion, or $2.45 a share, while analysts had generally
estimated $2.25 to $2.35 a share. A year earlier, IBM earned
$1.34 billion, or $2.31 a share. (Per-share earnings grew
faster than the total figure because IBM has been buying back
shares, cutting the average number outstanding to 573.3
million from 581.4 million a year earlier.) Revenue climbed a
surprisingly strong 8.4%, to $16.5 billion from $15.21
billion.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise in the quarter was the strength of
software revenue, which grew 26% to $2.35 billion. Although
software revenue had increased a heady 30% to 35% for years,
growth had recently slowed into the single digits as IBM had
begun providing hefty discounts on software as a way of
increasing hardware sales. IBM indicated that the strong
showing was an aberration but suggested that percentage
increases in the mid-teens were possible in the second half.</p>
<p>IBM said results continued to be good in personal
computers, where IBM has been gaining market share for the
past year and a half. Demand also remained strong for a line
of high-end disk drives that IBM began shipping late last
year. IBM also singled out for praise the AS/400, a line of
minicomputers that had been going gangbusters since its
introduction two years ago but that had finally seemed to be
losing momentum in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Revenue rose again in the U.S., even though the whole
computer industry has been having trouble here for years --
although the increase was apparently in the low single
digits, as opposed to the double-digit growth of the first
quarter and the 1989 second quarter.</p>
<p>IBM also said it is seeing some early benefits from a
job-reduction and plant-consolidation program that occasioned
a $2.4 billion write-off in the 1989 fourth quarter. Benefits
from the program are expected to really start to show up in
the second half.</p>
<p>At the same time, IBM acknowledged that 20 cents a share
of the latest quarter's earnings came from the drop in the
dollar -- because IBM does nearly 60% of its business
overseas, and a drop increases the value of that business
when it is translated into dollars.</p>
<p>In addition, operating profit margins were disappointing.
Profit before taxes, interest expense and other income was
just 15.7% of revenue, while many securities analysts had
been predicting the margin would be at least half a
percentage point higher. The difference apparently came
because a heavier-than-expected percentage of revenue came
from products such as personal computers, where profit
margins are lower than on the big systems.</p>
<p>The decline in mainframe revenue wasn't a big surprise,
given that a manufacturing problem in the 1989 first quarter
packed far more deliveries into last year's second quarter
than are normal. Still, IBM indicated that second-quarter
mainframe revenue was flat compared with this year's first
quarter -- even though the second quarter typically accounts
for 25% of mainframe revenue and the first 15%.</p>
<p>In the first half, IBM earned $2.45 billion, or $4.26 a
share, up 6.8% from $2.29 billion, or $3.92 a share. Revenue
climbed 9.8% to $30.68 billion from $27.94 billion.</p>
