	<p class="article-leader">Tokyo stock prices moved up strongly in moderate trading
that was focused on stocks with bright earnings outlooks,
traders said. Buying was prompted by widespread expectation
that domestic interest rates probably won't rise further, the
traders said.
   In London, shares gained in a moderately active session,
supported by futures-led buying, a strong showing on Wall
Street, and better-than-expected U.K. retail sales figures.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tokyo's Nikkei Index of 225 issues gained 377.36 points to
33021.73, ending above 33000 for the first time since June 6.</p>
<p>In early trading in Tokyo Tuesday, the Nikkei index
advanced 145.41 points to 33167.14.</p>
<p>Monday's volume on the first section was estimated at 580
million shares, up from 512.6 million shares Friday.
Advancers outnumbered decliners 691-277, while 163 issues
were unchanged.</p>
<p>The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed in the
first section was up 30.32 points, or 1.28%, at 2400.16.</p>
<p>The second section index advanced 9.91 points, or 0.22%,
to 4477.16. Volume was estimated at 33 million shares, down
from 41.3 million shares Friday.</p>
<p>The market opened amid improved momentum on the eased
credit stance by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, which led to
strong advances in New York stocks Friday.</p>
<p>The Fed's move helped to reduce expectations for a further
rise of Japanese interest rates, which have been holding
investors off from active buying, traders said.</p>
<p>They added that surprisingly little selling helped push up
stock prices widely. Advances for the futures indexes, which
ended the day at or just below intraday highs, made investors
hold on to their stocks without taking profits at yesterday's
level, traders said.</p>
<p>While higher-rates possibilities have faded, there's also
little expectation among participants that the Fed's move
will help to push down Japanese interest rates, as Japan's
money supply has remained at high levels in recent months and
the country's economy continues to perform well.</p>
<p>With domestic short-term interest rates remaining at
attractively high levels, institutional investors are
unlikely to become active buyers, said Shigeru Akiba, head of
equity at UBS Phillips & Drew International.</p>
<p>If June money supply data to be disclosed Friday show
high-paced growth, investors may again start talking about
the possibility for interest rates to rise, the Phillips &
Drew official said.</p>
<p>Institutions are also waiting to see results of a series
of U.S. economic indicators due later this week, including
consumer prices, as well as the testimony of U.S. Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan tomorrow, to judge the
direction for U.S. interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>With both exchange rates and bond prices remaining
relatively stable yesterday, stock investors mostly focused
on corporate earnings outlooks as incentives for buying,
traders said.</p>
<p>Strong advances for Sony and Kyocera early in the morning
session prompted gains for other companies whose earnings are
expected to grow strongly in coming years, traders said. A
wide range of electronics shares and public spending-related
shares set the pace of advances during the afternoon session.</p>
<p>Gains for some construction and housing companies prompted
heavy selling in midafternoon on profit-taking, said
Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock trading at Okasan
Securities.</p>
<p>"But they managed to finish higher, absorbing the
selling," Mr. Ito said. "That's a good sign that market
turnover is improving," he said.</p>
<p>Sony finished up 80 yen to 9080 yen (54 cents to $61.31).
Kyocera ended at 9220 yen, up 60 yen.</p>
<p>Shipbuilding companies closed higher, with
Ishikawajima-Harima gaining 29 yen to 1020 yen, and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries rising 20 yen to 1000 yen.</p>
<p>Blue-chip issues advanced briskly. Toyota Motor gained 70
yen to 2340 yen, while Fuji Photo Film advanced 200 yen to
4920 yen.</p>
<p>In London, shares were in demand from the outset, dealers
said, as this past week's rise in New York equities filtered
into optimism for the U.K. market, on the belief that the
broad-based index would be able to breach the 2400-point
barrier.</p>
<p>By late morning, news of a larger-than-expected drop in
June's retail sales helped lift the index across the
2400-point line and beyond. Provisional June retail sales
showed a 2.8% decline from May, and a 0.9% drop from a year
ago.</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index gained
24.3 points to 2406.5. The index reached as high as 2410
points.</p>
<p>The Financial Times 30 Share Index advanced 20.8 points to
1900.9. Volume amounted to 346.9 million shares, compared
with 399.2 million shares Friday.</p>
<p>Although some profit-taking set in during the late
afternoon to topple the index from midafternoon intraday
peaks, good demand for stock-index futures contracts and a
buoyant early effort on Wall Street left the market with a
firm undertone, dealers said. A shortage of stock in some of
the blue-chip leaders will likely lead to another rise today,
analysts predicted.</p>
<p>Glaxo gained 15 pence to 870 pence (27 cents to $15.70)
and Reuters rose 25 pence to #13.14; both issues were cited
by dealers as stocks specifically helped by a shortage of
their shares.</p>
<p>Wellcome fell 10 pence to 585 pence after a downgrading by
Hoare Govett Ltd., following downgradings a week ago by
Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. and James Capel & Co.</p>
<p>Carlton Communications continued to suffer from a
downgrading last week, finishing down 25 pence at 435 pence.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, share prices closed higher in Paris, Amsterdam,
Brussels, Madrid and Milan, mixed in Frankfurt and Zurich,
and lower in Stockholm. South African gold stocks closed
higher.</p>
<p>Also, stocks closed higher in Sydney, Wellington, Manila
and Singapore, and lower in Hong Kong, Seoul and Taipei.</p>
