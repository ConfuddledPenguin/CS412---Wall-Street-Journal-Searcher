	<p class="article-leader">OSWEGO, N.Y. -- Ruth Thorpe, a life master at the game,
has played bridge through three fires, twice at the Pontiac
Hotel here in Oswego and once at the Ithaca Hotel in Ithaca.
   But worse still was the raging storm that blew out the
windows at the Arlington Hotel in Binghamton, where she was
playing in a tournament with Johnny Cullinan, another life
master. The rainwater gushed in, and was soon an inch deep.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"It was so cold, I was shivering and could hardly hold the
cards," says Mrs. Thorpe. "Johnny went to the bar and got me
a ginger brandy. It's the only time he ever bought me a
drink." The game, relocated hastily to a second-floor room
across the street, rolled on.</p>
<p>And so has Mrs. Thorpe. Those old hotels all are gone now,
but Mrs. Thorpe is still playing bridge. Serious bridge, too.
Last February, she and her frequent partner, Audrey Johnson,
finished first in a national tournament held simultaneously
in more than 100 cities and involving 9,200 players. Mrs.
Thorpe plays in Oswego tournaments three days a week and
usually visits a sick friend for a social game Sunday nights.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thorpe, bridge champion, is 95 years old.</p>
<p>She began playing a card game called pedro before the
modern game of bridge was devised (by yachtsman Harold S.
Vanderbilt on a Caribbean cruise in 1926). The American
Contract Bridge League believes she is the organization's
oldest active player.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thorpe is a slender, gentle woman, known as Aunt Ruth
to almost everyone in this upstate town on the shores of Lake
Ontario. She is in good health, needs no medications, pays
her own bills and bakes her own pies in the white frame
bungalow she and her late husband, Walter, built themselves
62 years ago. Her depth perception isn't what it was when she
was 90, and she is a little hard of hearing. "I must get
younger," she says, as she stumbles a bit coming down her
front steps. But at the bridge table, she is a tiger.</p>
<p>"At the level we play it, bridge is a serious game," says
Mrs. Thorpe. She dismisses social bridge-rubber bridge, the
kind most amateurs play -- as "party" bridge or "kitchen"
bridge. "They talk a lot and they miss all the slams (big
winning hands)," she says during lunch at the Admiral Woolsey
waterfront restaurant here. What she plays -- what she has
been playing since doctors thought she had tuberculosis years
ago and she wasn't allowed to participate in outdoor
activities -- is duplicate bridge.</p>
<p>"It's hard to imagine her life without bridge," says her
great-niece, Joan Braun. "It puts her in constant contact
with people of all ages. It gets her up and moving."</p>
<p>Duplicate bridge is always played in a club or tournament
setting, with a director certified by the contract bridge
league in charge. Participants pay a nominal fee, from $2 to
$6 per person, to play. Mrs. Thorpe directed the Wednesday
afternoon tournament in Oswego for 37 years, donating her
profit -- as much as $750 in a good year -- to the Catholic
Daughters of America. Most days at her games, there were 12
or more tables. Now, she says, participation Wednesday
afternoons is down to five or six.</p>
<p>In duplicate bridge, cards are placed in "boards," and
every pair ultimately plays the same hands as everyone else.
Top honors go to those who come closest to achieving the
maximum potential of the cards they play. Partners will run
up their score by making, for example, five hearts, when
everyone else is making four. "It's that extra trick that
counts," says Mrs. Thorpe.</p>
<p>"The whole idea," says Jane Johnson, a league official,
"is to get the most out of each hand, whether declaring
playing the hand or defending." Winning hands, or boards,
is what counts; winning games or rubbers -- the way
conventional, social bridge is played -- has no place in the
heady world of duplicate bridge.</p>
<p>Serious players win master points for their successes in
tournaments at the local, regional and national level. Mrs.
Thorpe has accumulated 1,200 master points, achieving life
master status in 1961. (She is No. 3,375 of 40,829 life
masters.) Last February, in winning the national seniors
event for players 55 and older, Mrs. Thorpe and her partner,
Audrey Johnson, 67, scored an astonishing 79.1%, which means
they played at nearly 80 percent of bridge perfection that
day. It's a little like batting .800, a state of grace no
baseball player has ever approached.</p>
<p>In tournaments, contestants must fill out cards saying
which bridge-playing system they use. Mrs. Thorpe fills in
the space with one word, "standard." That means she plays a
sophisticated version of a basic system popularized by
Charles Goren more than 50 years ago. But others keep trying
to come up with more complicated systems. When Mrs. Thorpe
encounters opponents who claim to use one of these
innovations, she is delighted. "I know I'm going to fleece
them," she says.</p>
<p>She is particularly contemptuous of systems that try to
fool people. "They don't scare me," she says. "They lead from
weakness, and I believe in dealing from strength. Did you
ever scare anyone by being weak?"</p>
<p>The glory of duplicate bridge, and now its biggest
problem, is its difficulty. "It takes at least a year of hard
study, including lessons, to master the game," says Mrs.
Thorpe. "Young people these days are very smart, but they
have so many other things they want to do."</p>
<p>Also, the good players are sometimes rude and aggressive
and scare off the novices. Mrs. Thorpe -- a member of the
league's national goodwill committee, which seeks to promote
decorum and table manners -- remembers with distaste a
tournament in which a frustrated player picked up his chair
and flung it against a nearby wall.</p>
<p>Because many of the serious players are growing old, the
game tends to thrive in retirement communities, especially in
Florida and California. The contract bridge league says it
has 4,000 clubs and 190,000 members. No one has any idea how
many Americans still play "party" bridge socially.</p>
<p>Oswego has always been a good bridge-playing town, and
Mrs. Thorpe and her friend Mr. Cullinan are living legends in
the whole central New York area. They still bask in the
reflected glory of Oswego's greatest bridge player, a doctor
named William Halsey, who used to teach nurses to play the
game during idle moments in the operating room.</p>
<p>"He died at the bridge table in 1949," says Mr. Cullinan.
"And when the tragic news reached Peg Weekes, our best woman
player, her first question was, `What was he in?' `One
spade,' she was told. Peg thought for a second or two and
said, `He probably should have been in four.' And, sure
enough, when they went back and looked at the board, it
became obvious he had seriously underbid his hand."</p>
<p>"It's probably what did him in," notes Mrs. Thorpe.</p>
