	<p class="article-leader">DAVENPORT, Iowa -- Lee Enterprises Inc. said it paid $100
million to acquire the remaining 50% stake in its Napp
Systems Inc. joint venture from partner Nippon Paint Co. of
Japan.
   The two companies have operated jointly the San Marcos,
Calif.-based maker of printing plates for 17 years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lee, which operates a chain of small-to-midsize newspapers
and has broadcast holdings, said it and Nippon Paint "have
agreed that single company ownership is better than a joint
venture" to meet what it called "increasing competitive
pressures and technological innovations." Lee said it expects
the unit will be able, with a single management team, to
respond more swiftly to such conditions.</p>
<p>The venture, which had 1989 sales of about $75 million, is
profitable, according to Lee. The company declined to
disclose the venture's earnings. Lee has historically, under
accounting rules, reported its half of the venture's net
income both as earnings and in its revenue figures. Once the
transaction is completed, Lee's revenue will show the full
amount of Napp's sales.</p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Michael J. Riley said Napp has
about 50% of the market in its specialized printing-plate
field, "and that figure is growing."</p>
<p>A "lot of analysts are expecting (Lee's earnings for 1990)
to be down, after analyzing our basic businesses," Mr. Riley
said. But as a result of the transaction to take full
ownership of Napp, "Our bottom line should be up for the
year," he said.</p>
