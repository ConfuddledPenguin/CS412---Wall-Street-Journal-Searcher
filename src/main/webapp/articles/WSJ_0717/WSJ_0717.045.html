	<p class="article-leader">Over-the-counter stocks posted their fourth straight gain
as the Dow Jones Industrial Average flirted with the 3000
mark.
   The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1.16 to 469.60, a 0.5%
advance, but still remains below a high of 485.73 set last
Oct. 9. Volume dropped to 138.1 million shares from 160.6
million Friday as advancing shares trailed decliners, 946 to
969.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mirroring this year's trends in the OTC market, technology
stocks gained but financial issues sagged, felled partly by a
steep plunge in International Holding Capital. Shares of the
Honolulu thrift fell 8 to 17 after it announced that Sumix
Corp. failed to gain timely approval from the Office of
Thrift Supervision for a merger of the two thrifts. Three of
Nasdaq's four financial indexes fell slightly.</p>
<p>"It's a very splintered market," said Richard Bruno, head
of OTC trading at PaineWebber. Mr. Bruno said he continued to
see strong interest in technology and biotechnology shares,
while investors largely shunned financial stocks. "I wouldn't
jump in with both feet and buy everything that's for sale,"
he said, adding that investors continue to be selective.</p>
<p>At A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, small investors are
returning to OTC stocks, according to William Sulya, director
of OTC trading. In the last few trading sessions, Mr. Sulya
said prospects of lower interest rates has attracted
individual and institutional investors to stocks among all
industry groups. He added, however, that small investors seem
to be attracted only to "quality names" with strong
operations.</p>
<p>Technology shares were mixed. Intel added 1 1/4 to 51 1/4;
Microsoft advanced 7/8 to 79 1/4, and Lotus climbed 1 to 33
3/4. However, Oracle Systems, continuing to lose ground after
last week's earnings report, eased 3/8 to 18 3/8 and was the
day's most-active issue. Apple Computer dropped 1 1/8 to 45
5/8.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq 100 Index of larger stocks, including many
technology issues, rose 2.88 to 492.36.</p>
<p>Micropolis jumped 1 1/16 to 9, a new 52-week high, on more
than three times average volume. The Chatsworth, Calif.,
maker of high-capacity disk drives reported net income for
the second quarter ended June 29 of 20 cents a share,
compared with a year-earlier loss of 92 cents a share.</p>
<p>American Depositary Receipts of Telefonos de Mexico,
Mexico's government-subsidized telephone company, were among
the day's most-active issues, with more than 4 million ADRs
changing hands at 1 23/32, unchanged from the previous close.
Among other communications issues, MCI Communications gained
1/2 to 40, leading a 0.6% gain in the Nasdaq Utility Index.</p>
<p>Other active stocks included Class A shares of
Tele-Communications, which rose 5/8 to 15 1/8. A week ago,
the Denver cable television company offered three million
Class A shares at $14.25 apiece.</p>
<p>Nike raced to yet another new 52-week high, as shares of
the athletic footwear maker surged 2 1/4 to 94.</p>
<p>Shares of Goulds Pumps continued to climb on takeover
speculation, although a company official flatly denied rumors
that Britain's BTR PLC made an offer for the Seneca Falls,
N.Y., maker of centrifugal liquid holding pumps. Investor
relations liaison James A. Nelson told Dow Jones Professional
Investor Report the company hasn't had any acquisition offers
and "has no interest whatsoever" in being acquired. Gould
rose 1 to 26 on nearly 1.1 million shares, more than six
times average volume. The stock was active last week on
similar rumors.</p>
<p>Mr. Nelson said that second-quarter earnings are due to be
reported July 23 and added that he's comfortable with
consensus estimates the company will earn 40 cents a share,
up from 39 cents a year earlier, and $1.49 for the full year,
up from $1.41 in 1989.</p>
<p>Industrial Funding Class A shares plunged 3 5/8 to 5 7/8
after the provider of capital equipment leases reported a
loss for the second quarter ended May 31 of three cents a
share, compared with net income of 18 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>C-Cor Electronics lost 1 to 9 1/4 after the State College,
Pa., maker of cable-television equipment said it plans to lay
off about 90 workers at two Pennsylvania plants. C-Cor cited
weak orders due to uncertainty about regulation of the cable
television industry.</p>
<p>Westmark International tumbled 2 7/8 to 38 3/4. Anne Marie
Bugge, vice president of investor relations for the Seattle
maker of medical equipment, told DJPIR the fall was an
"overreaction" to the introduction of a new ultrasound system
by a competitor, Acuson Corp. of Mountain View, Calif.</p>
<p>Multimedia fell 7/8 to 69 5/8. A 400,000-share block
representing about 3.5% of the Greenville, S.C., media
company traded early in the day.</p>
