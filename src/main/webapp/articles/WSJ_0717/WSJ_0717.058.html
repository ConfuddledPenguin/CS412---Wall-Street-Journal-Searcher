	<p class="article-leader">No one should make the mistake of thinking that all the
politicians intent on soaking taxpayers for more live in the
nation's capital, New York, New Jersey or Massachusetts. The
tax drama continues out West.
   The California budget battle is coming to a head. But any
would-be refugees from California, weary of its higher taxes,
real-estate prices and crime, better take note of
developments in a few nearby havens.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Most strikingly, Arizona completed a fitful legislative
session of its own recently by effectively raising income,
property and excise taxes instead of curbing spending.
Republicans engineered this one. The $265 million package
squeezed through when go-along, get-along Republican leaders
of the Legislature ignored their conservative backbenchers
and bought off enough Democrats with spending sops to
assemble a majority.</p>
<p>The performance earned poor reviews, including a
"wretched" from the increasingly tax-hostile Arizona Republic
newspaper. The state's tumultuous politics are likely to
continue through the September GOP primary, in which the
tax-flaying former (and impeached) governor, Evan Mecham
faces four foes for governor. Indeed in November, voters may
toss the Republicans out of legislative control after 24
years.</p>
<p>Arizona's changes actually lower the top personal
income-tax rate to 7% from 8%. But by eliminating deductions,
the politicians aim to make the tax burden more progressive
and reclaim for state government the revenue windfall from
the 1986 federal tax revision. The legislation also will
repeal indexing of tax brackets. Business groups are
marshaling to pass a November initiative rescinding the tax
hikes.</p>
<p>The partisan dividing line is clearer in Colorado, where a
limitation on spending and taxation is due for a November
vote. In that state, Republicans have already cast their lot,
with libertarian-conservative John Andrews trying to oust
Democrat Governor Roy Romer. Mr. Andrews's platform includes
Amendent 1, the taxpayer-relief effort.</p>
<p>Six counties in the Denver area may provide a clue to the
outcome when they vote next month on a sales-tax increase to
build a stadium to lure a baseball franchise. Phoenix is
vying for the same expansion club, but the Arizona
Legislature, in another of its windup acts, voted to allow
Maricopa County to impose a stadium sales-tax hike without
putting the move to a public vote. (A number of obligations
and tax bites were shifted to the local level in Arizona,
otherwise the state boost would have been larger.)</p>
<p>Arizona competes most directly with the Las Vegas area for
jobs fleeing Southern California, so you'd think Nevada would
gain from its southern neighbor's follies. That may indeed
turn out to be the case. Democrat Governor Bob Miller talks
of hiking taxes only on the mining industry, which is
prospering in the northern part of the state. But rapid
growth has left some public facilities lagging, so the school
lobby has placed a November ballot initiative to impose an 8%
to 10% corporate income tax. The absence of such a tax has
helped Nevada recruit business.</p>
<p>Once again, of course, Arizona isn't going to be outdone
in the revenue-raising competition. The education
establishment there has its own gambit on the November
ballot, to raise spending per pupil by $100 a year for a
decade.</p>
<p>It should be a bronco-bucking few months ahead for
taxpayers in the wild, wild West. Tax advocates may persist
in saying there is opinion-poll support for all this. We
continue to think the politicians are getting close to
stirring up another tax revolt.</p>
