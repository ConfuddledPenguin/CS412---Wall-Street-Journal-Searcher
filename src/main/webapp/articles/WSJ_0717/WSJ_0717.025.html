	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Fresh-faced, mild-mannered, hardworking and
armed with an M.B.A., Clifford Gookin could have earned
himself a nice, steady living just about anywhere in
corporate America. But who wanted a steady living when Wall
Street beckoned?
   By the time he was 32 years old, this son of a Pine Bluff,
Ark., chicken-feed salesman was earning close to $500,000 a
year, flying around the world to give advice to corporations,
and living in a $750,000 Connecticut home with stereophonic
sound piped into several of its eight rooms.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Gookin was no Bruce Wasserstein or Henry Kravis. He
was a mid-Eighties Everyman on Wall Street, a soldier who
executed deals, not a honcho who brought in big clients. Like
hundreds of his peers, he had a good resume: He had gone to
Harvard Business School and joined the First Boston Corp.
class of 1983. Then he got swept up in one of the great
financial booms in history.</p>
<p>This was a working experience truly unlike others. Even
junior employees routinely jumped from firm to firm in search
of ever higher six-figure compensation; departments grew so
fast that members had to introduce themselves at Monday
morning meetings. In short, Mr. Gookin was very much in the
right place at the right time.</p>
<p>Until last December. Just before Christmas, Mr. Gookin's
boss, John Harrison, told him their division, leveraged
buy-outs, was going through a "slowdown," and that he should
return to his old department, investment banking. But when he
reported to investment banking, Mr. Gookin learned that
department had just begun layoffs and couldn't accommodate
him. So Mr. Gookin returned to Mr. Harrison, who simply said,
"Gee, I'm really sorry."</p>
<p>That was it, though it took a few minutes for Mr. Gookin
to realize he had just been fired.</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin is hardly alone. Despite the strong stock
market, the securities business has slashed some 45,000 jobs
nationwide since 1987; the carnage that began with low-paid
clerks has spread upward to once highflying, high-paid
investment bankers. Most who are lucky enough to have kept
their jobs are anticipating salaries much more in line with
those in other industries.</p>
<p>Many others have lost their jobs and say they simply don't
understand. Elaine S. Gilde, a graduate of Harvard Business
School, was a director in the merchant banking group at
Merrill Lynch & Co, where she worked on some successful
deals, such as a junk-bond financing for retailer Ann Taylor.
In January, she was terminated, and she is still looking for
work. "What's wrong with this picture?" she wonders. "I did
all the right things. I went to all the right schools."
Recently, she ran into a Harvard classmate -- at the
unemployment office. "It's a true commentary on 1990," she
says.</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin similarly wonders what went wrong with his
world. Even though he himself once left First Boston in favor
of a competitor's higher offer during good times, he doesn't
understand why First Boston didn't stand behind him in bad.
After all, many of the firm's senior managers continue to
make seven-figure salaries that, if cut, could sustain a lot
of Mr. Gookins.</p>
<p>Now he is divorced. The home with the stereophonic sound
is gone along with most of his savings. He is job-hunting. He
paid his own way to fly from New York to Los Angeles for a
job interview, only to have the interview canceled after he
got there. Two finance jobs he thought were in his grasp went
to rival job seekers from the defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert.</p>
<p>Like the loser in a real-life game of musical chairs, Mr.
Gookin feels a sense of injustice, and of disbelief. "I was
making more money {in a year} than my father had earned in
his entire life," he says. "I figured that if they were
paying me that much, somebody must have thought highly of
me."</p>
<p>None of the present or former First Boston officials
mentioned in this article would comment. A spokesman for the
firm, which paid Mr. Gookin 12 weeks severance and a bonus
for 1989, doesn't dispute Mr. Gookin's account, adding that
he was "a good man" victimized by a shrinking workload.</p>
<p>Former clients like Tom Moore, chief executive of
Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., praise Mr. Gookin's work. At Blodgett
Corp., a Vermont pizza-oven maker sold in an LBO that First
Boston sponsored, Chief Financial Officer Sam Hartwell says,
"I'd go anywhere with him. He represented our interests. He's
not a `Bonfire of the Vanities' type guy."</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin says he rarely attended the Manhattan dinner
parties to which his peers flocked when the workday was done.
He describes himself as a homebody who thrived on work. "I
couldn't name-drop about who I saw in the Hamptons," he says,
referring to the wealthy Long Island resort towns. "I've
never been to the Hamptons."</p>
<p>He came to Wall Street after graduating from Claremont
Men's College in California, working for two years for
management consultants McKinsey & Co., and attending Harvard
Business School.</p>
<p>The Street's boom was just beginning, and while other
industries also sent recruiters to Cambridge, Mass., the town
seemed to be crawling with investment bankers ready to throw
their money around in search of Harvard recruits. Mr. Gookin
signed up following a dinner at pricey Locke-Ober's on the
Boston Common, at which he remembers First Boston's Robert
Cotter, who is now the firm's mergers boss, telling him that
First Boston was hot, and a really fun place to boot.</p>
<p>It took a while for the fun to start. Once in, Mr. Gookin
began grinding out the computer calculations and stilted
prose of the paper work behind the securities deals his
superiors had thought up. The hours were long, but it wasn't
all drudgery. There were drinks with clients at the Harvard
Club, or, after closing a deal, dinner at the steakhouse
Christ Cella, where the tab for one can run to $75.</p>
<p>During one 1985 deal for Sperry Corp. bonds in which a
drafting session at the printer's office broke up before
dawn, the printer installed the 27-year-old Mr. Gookin at the
Stanhope Hotel, sumptuously decked out with Limoges china and
Baccarat crystal.</p>
<p>As Mr. Gookin moved up the pecking order he reveled in the
role of the "workhorse," the junior person in charge, on some
deals, of the nuts and bolts work: coordinating with clients,
writing and crunching numbers, making sure that deadlines
were met. Mr. Gookin would assemble a team of associates and
convert an office into a war room. "You're kind of like the
field marshal," Mr. Gookin says.</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin says First Boston was still small enough back
in 1985 that the place seemed like a "family" to him. But all
kinds of deals -- stock and bond offerings, mergers,
takeovers -- were pouring into the firm and its major
competitors. The simple need for even relatively
inexperienced bodies like Mr. Gookin to do the routine work
was enormous. And the headhunters were out in force.</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin learned that Bear Stearns & Co. was offering a
vice presidency for young associates willing to work in its
San Francisco office. He quickly applied, and, offered a 25%
pay increase, soon left his First Boston family. His bosses
there, he recalls, weren't even angry. Loyalty wasn't
particularly expected, and First Boston itself was routinely
stealing employees from competitors.</p>
<p>Thus, the powerful Joseph Perella, who along with Mr.
Wasserstein ran First Boston's merger group, jumped at the
chance to steal Mr. Gookin back from Bear Stearns a year
later. Mr. Gookin hadn't enjoyed his move to the West Coast,
and he called Mr. Perella to tell him that. While in San
Francisco on business, Mr. Perella had the 28-year-old to
breakfast at his hotel, the Stanford Court. He offered him
his pick of jobs. "You can go any place you want," Mr. Gookin
recalls the senior banker saying.</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin says he returned a chastened man. This time, he
insists, "I was totally dedicated" to staying at First
Boston. His return was also greeted as a minor event: After
all, he was the second prodigal son to return to the firm
from Bear Stearns within a few months.</p>
<p>In 1987 First Boston awarded him a vice presidency and the
chance to speak to the annual gathering of its new recruits,
a speech he would make for three years straight -- including
one four months before his own dismissal.</p>
<p>"I was the epitome of what it was like to be a young,
successful, First Boston investment banker," he says.</p>
<p>The trim, boyish-looking Mr. Gookin was introduced as a
trooper who had strayed and seen the error of his ways. He
recalls looking out over the group of about 150: They were
"tall, mostly white, mostly men. Most of them were athletes.
They had short hair. A lot of them showed up in suspenders.
In terms of uniformity, they looked like the Marines."</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin says his speech was designed to deflate the
super-confident group. "I called it the mogul speech -- how
to become a mogul," he recalls, saying that he basically told
them that despite their suspenders, they weren't yet moguls
and would have to work very hard to get there.</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin observes that not all of the younger associates
got the message. One associate none too fond of late hours
used to leave his jacket on the back of his chair, his light
on, his calculator out and his papers in a deliberate
clutter, so that any manager taking an evening stroll would
think he was still at work. Another had his computer rigged
so that when a superior walked by he could switch from video
games to spreadsheets at the touch of a key.</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin recalls a particular Monday morning in which
managing director Richard Bott, who prized his meticulously
polished Chippendale desk, found that someone, presumably his
overworked subordinates, had left a pepperoni pizza face-down
on the desktop right where Mr. Bott could normally see his
own reflection.</p>
<p>When they weren't working, Mr. Gookin recalls, talk among
many of the young associates often strayed to the feasibility
of jetting to Paris for the weekend or helicoptering among
various Canadian ski resorts.</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin's responsibilities were growing. "It was
unbelievable: I'd have two or three deals going
simultaneously." Pressed into service at the financial
printers in the small hours of the morning, Mr. Gookin would
see competitors from two, three, four rival firms, proof that
even while the city slept, Wall Street's deal-making
machinery was grinding on.</p>
<p>During one deal, on which Mr. Gookin had been working
nearly nonstop for weeks, he began living on and off at the
Omni Berkshire Place hotel near the office. On another
project, deciding whether to issue stock for an Australian
fire-extinguisher maker, Wormald Ansul Ltd., he went on a
six-week tour of the company's operations in England, Brazil,
Canada and Australia.</p>
<p>The hours, however, were beginning to take their toll on
his marriage. After a 36-hour flight from Australia, Mr.
Gookin missed part of his wife's birthday celebration. "At
some point, how many kids' birthday parties or holidays or
special events can you miss and not have it create some
tension?" he says. "There were soccer practices, piano,
debates. I tried to hit the important things."</p>
<p>And then there were problems at the office as well. In
early 1988 the firm's two superstars, Messrs. Wasserstein and
Perella, left to set up their own firm, taking 23 people with
them. Then, the firm's leveraged buy-out division left,
virtually en masse, to start its own shop, Vestar Capital
Partners.</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin, who worked in the investment-banking
department, was transferred to help fill the gaping hole in
the LBO group, which managed 14 investments where First
Boston had taken its own money and bought an ownership stake
in a company, and which looked for other such investments.</p>
<p>After a few years of advising clients, the 31-year-old now
found himself with the job of deciding in a matter of days
whether First Boston should spend hundreds of millions of
dollars to bid for a company, and at what price. Companies
were being picked off left and right, and the competition was
intense because the fees that the investment bank could make
on such a deal were enormous. Mr. Gookin describes it as
"like driving a car at 100 miles per hour with a blindfold
on."</p>
<p>At one point, Mr. Gookin, no expert in the mining trade,
found himself with a hard hat on in a Louisiana salt mine in
order to judge the value of Domtar Inc.'s Sifto Salt
division, which was up for sale. Trying to learn more, he
swallowed hard and sat down to a lunch of broiled alligator
with the mine's manager, served by the manager's wife.</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin, who wasn't convinced by what he saw of Sifto's
operations, persuaded First Boston to bid low. Many of the
unit's assets were eventually bought by North American Salt
Co.</p>
<p>In fact, none of Mr. Gookin's four bids during his tenure
in the LBO group was a winner, a move he attributes to
prudence in an overheated and speculative market, but which
he also says added up to zero fees for First Boston. His
stock was plummeting. Only he didn't know how far.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, his mentor in the LBO group was
pushed aside. Mr. Gookin says senior managers were being
hired from outside the firm. "The people who became your boss
didn't know you or what you were capable of," he says. When
he pitched an idea, he began to get the impression that his
bosses weren't even listening.</p>
<p>Then, in the middle of last year, Mr. Gookin's marriage
ended. He lost the house and most of his savings in the
divorce settlement after his wife's lawyer made much of the
fact that Mr. Gookin was a successful investment banker. He
thought the settlement generous but says his lawyer told him
to accept because "you can earn your way out." Six months
later, Mr. Gookin was out of work.</p>
<p>He spent the next several months on the empty 35th floor
of one of First Boston's two midtown office towers, a place
he called the "ghost town." Gone were the china and crystal.
There were no facsimile machines or coffee pots, just
cardboard boxes filled with fired employees' belongings,
empty desks, and phones for those who had been let go to use
in seeking other employment.</p>
<p>Particularly awkward, he says, were encounters on the way
to the cafeteria with those still working at First Boston. In
late May he was approaching the elevator when a colleague who
didn't know of his dismissal saw him leaving the dreaded
Floor 35 and asked, "Are you here?"</p>
<p>"I'm here," Mr. Gookin said softly. "I'm here." To limit
conversation, he would take a sandwich to his desk and eat
alone.</p>
<p>While there, he had plenty of time to think. The most
bitter of his thoughts is that he lost his job not by any
grand design, but by drawing an unlucky number in some
cost-cutter's lottery. As he sees it: "Somebody two boxes
over and one box up says we have to cut costs, and they
randomly go through the firm."</p>
<p>Mr. Gookin says that some of his colleagues attended
nightly dinner parties, drove Porsches and viewed weekend
work as an intrusion on their skiing. His dismissal hurts all
the more because, he insists, with him work came first. He
says that his own vacations consisted of driving to Hilton
Head Island, and that he spent most of his free nights at
home with his family.</p>
<p>But now, he says, there is no money even for Hilton Head.
He is earning spending money working on a temporary finance
project for a friend's business in San Francisco; he sleeps
in the friend's apartment. Though he is glad to be working,
even temporarily, he has had to put up with a painful
separation from his seven-year-old daughter, who remains in
Connecticut.</p>
<p>As he interviews for another job -- competing against a
horde of similarly displaced investment bankers -- he is left
with only a few remnants of his former life: his Paul Stuart
suits, his tennis racket and his Range Rover. "I go to work
and I go home," he says. "Everything is on hold."</p>
