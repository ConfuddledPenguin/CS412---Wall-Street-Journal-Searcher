	<p class="article-leader">Sandoz AG, a major Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical
group, said first-half sales rose 3% to 6.77 billion francs
($4.83 billion) from 6.56 billion francs a year earlier.
   Its chemical, construction and environment, and nutrition
divisions showed slight declines in sales, while its
pharmaceutical and agro-chemical units posted mild gains.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The seed division sales rose 34%, largely because of the
influence of an acquisition, the company said.</p>
<p>The company said that based on first-half figures, group
profit for 1990 should at least match last year's 958 million
francs and return on sales rate of 7.7%, despite currency
influences and a sluggish U.S. economy. The company wasn't
more specific. In keeping with Swiss business practices, the
company didn't provide any firsthalf profit figures.</p>
