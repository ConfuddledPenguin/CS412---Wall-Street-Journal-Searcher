	<p class="article-leader">Purity Products Inc., Baltimore, and a sister company,
Purity Products of Virginia Inc., Petersburg, Va., have
agreed to settle an 18-month-old suit brought by Tropicana
Products Inc., Bradenton, Fla., a unit of Seagram Co.
   In the federal suit, Tropicana alleged that the two
distributors secretly sold the Tropicana products to
retailers and wholesalers outside the Baltimore area in
breach of their distribution contracts. Tropicana's general
counsel, Steven B. Gold, says the scheme allowed the
distributors to pocket promotional discounts paid by
Tropicana and to profit further by undercutting other
distributors in those areas that also sold Tropicana
products.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Gold says the distributors agreed to stop diverting
Tropicana products and to pay Tropicana $510,000 rather than
face trial on racketeering charges and punitive damages
exceeding $1 million.</p>
<p>Ivan Goldstein, president of both distribution companies,
declined to comment.</p>
<p>Last year, a federal judge in Tampa, Fla., denied the
distributors' motion to dismiss the suit. Tropicana, the
judge ruled, had listed hundreds of violations by the
distributors that showed a pattern of racketeering occurring
in a specified period of time.</p>
