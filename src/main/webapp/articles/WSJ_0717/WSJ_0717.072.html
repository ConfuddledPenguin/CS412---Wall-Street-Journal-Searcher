	<p class="article-leader">The Senate takes up the farm bill this week, and one of
the first votes will be an attempt to put the bloated sugar
program on a diet. Senators Bill Bradley of New Jersey and
Bill Roth of Delaware think it's absurd that U.S. consumers
should pay twice the world price of sugar to support a few
wealthy domestic growers. Quotas on imported sugar cost
consumers $2.4 billion in higher food prices every year. They
also undercut U.S. foreign policy by undermining many
faltering Caribbean and Asian democracies that need currency
earnings to repay foreign debts and import U.S. products.
Senators Bradley and Roth propose a cut of about 10% in the
sugar subsidy. A budget squeeze already recently forced cuts
of about that size in subsidies for milk, wheat, cotton, rice
and feed grains. But the sugar lobby is powerful, and it has
discovered that large PAC contributions serve as a useful
sweetener. The vote on the sugar program will show whether
Congress has any interest in reforming America's Soviet-style
agricultural policy.</p>
