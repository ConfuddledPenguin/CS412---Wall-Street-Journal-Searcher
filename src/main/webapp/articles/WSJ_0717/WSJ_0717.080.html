	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve Board issued proposals
to significantly relax limits on securities activities by
U.S. banks abroad and broaden the businesses the overseas
units can enter without specific approval from the central
bank.
   Under the package of proposals, overseas securities units
of U.S. banks would be allowed to underwrite as much as $60
million or 25% of the parent's so-called Tier 1 capital.
Currently, the limit is a flat $15 million. In the U.S, banks
are allowed to underwrite a limited amount of debt, and
although the Fed has indicated it will approve equities
underwriting, it hasn't yet approved an application by any
U.S. bank to do so.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Tier 1 capital, considered the most important form of
capital, consists of common stock and other "tangible"
investments that provide a cushion for losses.</p>
<p>The proposal would also raise the limit on the amount of
securities from a single issuer that an overseas bank unit
could hold in its trading account to $30 million or 10% of
Tier 1 capital, whichever is lower. The current limit is $15
million.</p>
<p>The Fed also proposed that underwriting life insurance,
operating as a futures commission merchant and acting as a
principal or agent in interest-rate and foreign-currency swap
transactions be added to the list of approved activities for
the overseas units. The Fed has allowed banks' foreign
subsidiaries to engage in some of those activities on a
case-by-case basis, but the proposal would allow the units to
engage in the activities simply by notifying the Fed.</p>
<p>The proposal, which is expected to be published in the
Federal Register soon and will be open for comment for 60
days, also would allow the foreign securities units to
underwrite 100% of an issuer's securities. Currently, the
bank units are allowed to underwrite only 20% of an issue.
The Fed said it was seeking comment on allowing banks to
exceed the underwriting limits if the parent company would
remain well-capitalized even after the excess underwriting
amount was deducted from its capital.</p>
<p>Within 30 days of the close of an underwriting period, the
bank subsidiary would have to divest enough of the issue it
has underwritten to meet other limits, such as the
restriction on subsidiaries' investment holdings. That limit
is currently $15 million. The proposal would increase the
limit to $25 million. The increase is warranted, the Fed
said, because of the growth in capital at U.S. banks
operating overseas.</p>
