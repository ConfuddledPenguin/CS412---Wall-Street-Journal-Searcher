	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade directed Stotler &
Co., the futures brokerage unit of Stotler Group Inc., to
boost its capital by the close of business tomorrow or begin
liquidating customer accounts.
   Stotler, whose chairman, Karsten "Cash" Mahlmann, is also
the chairman of the exchange, confirmed industry assertions
that it wasn't in compliance with Board of Trade capital
requirements.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stotler's capital problems are an acute embarrassment to
Mr. Mahlmann, whose administrative talents were touted in his
campaign for the exchange's top job, even though he hasn't
been involved in the company's day-to-day management for the
past few years.</p>
<p>Low capital levels also may prompt a cash flow crisis for
Stotler & Co., an old-line grain trading firm that has been
eclipsed in recent years by larger financial futures trading
rivals. It said it was transferring some customer accounts to
other brokers and was looking for additional capital to
remedy its problems. If a capital infusion isn't found,
"Stotler Group may be unable to meet its debt obligations
unless those obligations are refinanced or restructured,"
Stotler Group said.</p>
<p>Stotler said that transferring customer accounts, and
thereby forgoing trading commissions generated by those
accounts, and other planned changes would reduce revenue and
net income for Stotler Group. For the first quarter, Stotler
Group reported net income of $370,000, or 17 cents a share,
and commission revenue of $28.4 million.</p>
<p>Neither Stotler Group nor the exchange disclosed the
amount of capital Stotler has to support customer accounts.</p>
<p>Stotler's capital problems may be tied to a dispute with
regulators over counting certain assets, specifically
commercial paper, as regulatory net capital, exchange members
said. Commodity regulations require that futures brokerage
firms maintain liquid assets in a separate account equal to a
certain percentage of funds in customer accounts.</p>
<p>Restrictions are placed on a firm's activities when its
capital as defined by regulators falls to 7% of customer
funds. The firm can be immediately forced out of the customer
business if the capital level hits 4% of customer funds.</p>
<p>Stotler Group had shareholders' equity of $8.5 million as
of March 31.</p>
<p>Stotler Group's stock, which is listed on the American
Stock Exchange, didn't open for trading Thursday or Friday.
The trading halt prompted disclosures from exchange members
that the company hadn't maintained an adequate capital
cushion to support its customer business.</p>
<p>The company's stock opened for trading late yesterday
morning on the Amex and closed at 5, down 2 7/8.</p>
<p>Stotler Group said that one of its five subsidiaries, R.G.
Dickinson & Co., a Des Moines, Iowa, securities broker, isn't
affected by the Board of Trade capital directive.</p>
