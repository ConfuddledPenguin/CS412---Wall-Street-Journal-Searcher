	<p class="article-leader">NVR L.P., McLean, Va., said its working capital and
mortgage warehouse credit facilities expired yesterday but
that it expects to have an extension at current levels in
place by next Monday.
   NVR also said land-development partnerships in which its
NVR Development subsidiary is general partner failed to make
several interest payments due yesterday and won't make any
other loan payments on that debt until the debt is
restructured. Currently, NVR Development isin default on a
$10 million unsecured working capital line.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, NVR said its home-building operations are
cutting prices in response to a weak market and that it is
scaling back certain operations in Florida and in the
Midwest. In connection with the moves, the company said it
expects to take a charge against earnings that will result in
a second-quarter loss. In the 1989 quarter, NVR had net
income of $9 million, or 34 cents a share.</p>
<p>NVR said it expects the credit lines for the parent
company to be extended to at least Aug. 31.</p>
