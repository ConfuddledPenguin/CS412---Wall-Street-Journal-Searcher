	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- Standard & Poor's Corp. downgraded about $700
million in debt issued by UAL Corp.'s United Airlines unit,
citing unsettled labor disputes and burdensome leases.
   S&P said the United ratings remain on its CreditWatch list
"with negative implications," pending the airline company's
possible acquisition by its employees. UAL declined to
comment.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The rating concern cut its ratings on $200 million of
industrial revenue bonds to triple-B-minus from triple-B, and
on $500 million of subordinated debt to double-B-plus from
triple-B-minus. It cited "erosion that has already occurred"
in the airline's credit, and said the ratings could be
lowered further after a buy-out or financial restructuring.</p>
<p>United's contracts with its three major unions have
expired and are in negotiation or mediation; progress isn't
likely until the airline's future ownership is resolved, S&P
said. Failure to complete the buy-out would leave unhappy
employees reluctant to agree to productivity and work-rule
concessions sought by management, it said.</p>
<p>Completion of the buy-out would improve the labor
situation but add substantial debt to the balance sheet, S&P
said. United's total debt was about $1.7 billion at March 31,
lower than prior levels, S&P said, but the "debt equivalent
of United's off-balance-sheet leases has mounted rapidly to
approximately $5 billion, and will rise further as new
aircraft needed for fleet expansion and modernization are
delivered." It said the new equipment will lower operating
costs and facilitate growth, but raise fixed financial
obligations significantly.</p>
