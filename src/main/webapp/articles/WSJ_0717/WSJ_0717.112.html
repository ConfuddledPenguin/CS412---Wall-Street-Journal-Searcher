	<p class="article-leader">General Development Corp. said it will probably have to
pay much larger claims than it originally thought for a
revised plea-bargain agreement to settle charges that it
defrauded thousands of home buyers.
   The developer, which is operating under federal bankruptcy
law protection, was dealt a blow last week when a federal
judge rejected its plea-bargain agreement with the U.S.
attorney in Miami. Under the restitution part of that
agreement, General Development would have had to pay home
buyers $80 million to $100 million over 25 years.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>General Development said the court gave the parties until
Aug. 7 to submit a revised plea agreement and restitution
plan. Failing that, the court will set a date to begin the
company's trial. The company, which said it has been
negotiating with the U.S. attorney, said it believes it will
be able to develop a plan by Aug. 7 that will satisfy the
court.</p>
<p>However, General Development said, "It is likely that the
revised terms of the restitution plan would result in
substantially larger claims for restitution than originally
anticipated."</p>
