	<p class="article-leader">St. Andrews, Scotland -- At one time, what's now called
the Old Course here comprised 22 holes, but in 1764 its first
four holes were combined into two longer ones, and the same
was done with the final four. So great was to become the
prestige of St. Andrews that the resulting 18 holes is now
the standard size of golf courses everywhere. The
consolidation was to prove fortunate, for if the course had
stayed at 22 holes, many physicians would be too tired to see
their patients on Thursday mornings.
   History permeates the sod of St. Andrews, where the 119th
British Open will be contested beginning Thursday. It is,
uncontestedly, golf's birthplace, dating from at least the
15th century and, possibly, much further back.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>No golf artifacts survive from those earliest days, but an
act of the Scottish Parliament, dated March 1457, stated that
"the Fute-ball and Golfe be utterly cryit doune, and not
usit" -- which, I guess, expressed disapproval. The populace
must have paid little heed, because in 1491 another act
ordained that "in no place of the realm there be usit
Fute-ball, Golfe or uther unprofitabill sportis."</p>
<p>By the 1500s, Parliament had given up on such
unprofitabill strictures, possibly because the king, James
IV, was deeply into the game. So, later in the century, were
James V and his daughter, Mary, Queen of Scots. Mary was such
a golf nut that she was spied on the St. Andrews links a few
days after the murder of her husband, Lord Darnley. It's not
recorded whether the unpleasantness affected her score.</p>
<p>Moving right along, we come to 1754, when 22 "noblemen and
gentlemen" of this gray-stone town across the Firth of Forth
from Edinburgh formed the Society of St. Andrews Golfers.
That later would become the Royal and Ancient Golf Club
(R&A), which promulgates golf's rules everywhere but in the
U.S.</p>
<p>Among the society's first set of 13 rules was No. 11,
which read: "If a Ball be stop'd by any person, Horse, Dog,
or anything else, the Ball so stop'd must be played where it
lies." This is why golfers must wait until no one is looking
before kicking their balls out of the rough.</p>
<p>The rule probably was first violated at St. Andrews,
because the place is rife with golfing trouble. To an eye
accustomed to the lush greenery of American layouts, the Old
Course, set on sandy, undulating seaside land, looks more
like a poorly tended farm than a place to play golf, its
dominant color the yellow-brown of the high, fairway-hugging
grasses that sway in the wind. Herbert Warren Wind, in a
wonderful article on the place, called it a "tawny sea of
billows."</p>
<p>One wonders why the Scots put so many of their golf
courses in such places in an otherwise beautiful land --
until it starts to rain, and the water disappears into the
sandy soil. If they didn't play golf in the rain in Scotland,
they'd never play at all.</p>
<p>But beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and St. Andrews
grows on many. "The more you study it, the more you love it,
and the more you love it, the more you study it," said the
great Bobby Jones, who won the British Open on the course in
1927, and the British Amateur here three years later.</p>
<p>Mark Calcavecchia, who won last year's Open title at Royal
Troon and is here to defend it, expressed a similar view
during last month's U.S. Open in Medinah, Ill. "Once you've
played St. Andrews a few times, like I have, its variety
starts to sink in," he said. "There are holes you can play
five or six different ways."</p>
<p>The course that will test the world's best this week is
one of four owned by the municipality of St. Andrews. All are
available for public use except for tournaments and the few
weeks that the R&A expropriates them. The Old Course has been
altered little over the past 150 years except for length. To
compensate for the game's technological improvements, it now
measures 6,933 yards.</p>
<p>That the Old Course has kept pace is well attested. In the
past seven Opens staged here -- in 1955, '57, '60, '64, '70,
'78 and '84 -- first place was attained by 72-hole scores in
the narrow range of 276 to 283 strokes, with the wind, or
occasional lack of it, usually being the determining factor.
"You can't discuss St. Andrews without talking about the
wind," '70 champ Jack Nicklaus has declared.</p>
<p>Individual holes at the course are the stuff of
picturesque dentist-office prints, but two stand out. One is
the 14th, a 567-yard par five that exemplifies the Old
Course's treachery and its stewards' proclivity for the
whimsical. From an elevated tee overlooking a ravine, the
golfer faces what Nicklaus calls "the most dangerous drive in
the world when the wind is blowing."</p>
<p>Ten bunkers, including ones named "Hell" and "The
Beardies," line a fairway called "Elysian Fields." Beyond
that stands a huge, rolling double green, one of seven on the
premises. Gene Sarazen caught "Hell" on 14 during the 1933
Open here, took two shots to get out, and got an eight on the
hole. He lost the tourney by a stroke.</p>
<p>The 17th, the "Road Hole," probably is golf's most famous.
It's a 461-yard par four dogleg right, with a road lined by a
stone wall tracing its right edge. Some players try to cut
the dogleg by flying the wall, but then must hit a
middle-to-long iron into a trapped, narrow, terraced green
that Bobby Jones said was "capable of deflecting a second
shot in bewildering directions." Many elect to play short and
chip on to avoid such difficulties.</p>
<p>After a career in which he won 13 titles in the "Grand
Slam" of his day (the U.S. and British opens and amateur
championships), Jones called his 1930 British Amateur win
here his most memorable, and a third-round match in which he
defeated Cyril Tolley in 19 holes the best of that tourney.
In his book "Golf Is My Game," Jones rhapsodized that
Tolley's third shot on 17, a pitch over a bunker to two feet
of the cup, was a shot that "never has been surpassed for
exquisitely beautiful execution."</p>
<p>Jones, who regularly scored much lower, had a 75 that day.
But it was on the Old Course. And the wind was blowing.</p>
