	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- French consumer prices in June rose a preliminary
0.2% from May and 3% from a year earlier, the National
Statistics Institute said.
   The June result matches May's monthly rise of 0.2% and
leaves the year-to-year inflation rate unchanged at 3%.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest monthly rise was in line with estimates by
economists, who had expected price growth to remain broadly
under control in June, with the growth rates for most main
price categories showing little change from May. But the
stable year-to-year rate was slightly below previous
forecasts, which had generally called for a rise of 3.1%.</p>
