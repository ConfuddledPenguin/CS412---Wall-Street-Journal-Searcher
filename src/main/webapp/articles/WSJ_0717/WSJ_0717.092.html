	<p class="article-leader">Bad news continues to hammer the informal resale, or
secondary, market for limited partnerships.
   Resale prices of many partnerships fell in the second
quarter, as more sponsors slashed payouts to investors or
revealed plans to convert their partnerships into new,
publicly traded investments.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>These are some of the findings of the latest Wall Street
Journal survey of trading at a number of small investment
firms that buy partnership interests from investors, either
for their own accounts or for resale to new investors. The
survey covered resale-market trading in 20 widely held
partnerships during the quarter ended June 30.</p>
<p>The partnerships in the survey are a small sample of the
nearly $90 billion of such investments sold publicly by major
Wall Street brokerage firms and other syndicators since the
late 1970s. About half invested in real estate or mortgages,
while the rest of the money they raised went into everything
from leasing jetliners to drilling for oil and operating
cable-television systems.</p>
<p>Designed as long-term ventures, partnerships typically
have lives of about 10 years before their assets are sold and
investors are paid off. But at least 20% of older
partnerships are foundering, according to brokerage-industry
estimates. The resale market, informal and inefficient as it
is, is about the only outlet for investors who want to get
out before a partnership runs its normal course.</p>
<p>The best prices investors got when selling the 11 real
estate partnerships in the survey during the latest quarter
were about 46%, on average, below their original prices. The
average discount was about 35% in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Out of a total of 20 partnerships in the survey, 17
changed hands in the latest period, the same number as in the
first quarter. The best prices sellers got plummeted,
however, to 42% below the original offering prices. The
overall average discount was about 35% in the previous
quarter.</p>
<p>At these depressed prices, several partnerships in the
survey offer seemingly high yields to new investors. But the
estimated recent yields can be deceptive. They are based on
cash distributions for the latest four quarters divided by
current prices. There isn't any guarantee the partnerships
will continue to provide that income.</p>
<p>Indeed, Ross Bowler, president of 2nd Market Capital
Services, a Madison, Wis., secondary-market firm, says,
"Dozens and dozens of partnerships have cut or eliminated
their distributions in the last few months."</p>
<p>Also depressing prices in the second quarter were
partnership "roll-ups," including a massive one involving a
partnership in the survey, Equitec Real Estate Investors Fund
XV.</p>
<p>"The Equitec roll-up has definitely had an impact on the
prices of other partnerships," says Jim Frith, president of
Chicago Partnership Board Inc., another secondary-market
firm. With so many other sponsors in financial straits, "a
lot of people are nervous there will be more roll-ups and
historically, they have been a really bad deal for the
limited partners."</p>
<p>In a roll-up, several non-traded limited partnerships,
typically including some healthy ones and some that aren't,
are consolidated into new, publicly traded investments.
Limited partners usually approve the reorganization to gain
liquidity. But the price of the new units once they begin
trading typically sinks far below the supposed exchange value
syndicators put on them.</p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission has said it is
studying the fairness of roll-ups to investors. A
congressional subcommittee headed by Rep. Edward J. Markey
(D., Mass.) also plans hearings on the issue later this
summer.</p>
<p>The Equitec partnership included in the survey is one of
11 partnerships sponsored by Equitec Financial Group,
Oakland, Calif., that are included in a roll-up by Hallwood
Group Inc., a New York merchant bank. Hallwood is asking
about 87,000 investors in the 11 partnerships to exchange
their interests for newly issued units of Hallwood Realty
L.P., a master limited partnership to be listed on the
American Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Separately, Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. has said it
is considering a roll-up that would include another
partnership in the survey, Prudential-Bache Energy Income
Series III-14.</p>
<p>The tainted reputation roll-ups are gaining is prompting
some other sponsors to consider converting individual limited
partnerships to real estate investment trusts that would
eventually trade publicly.</p>
<p>New York syndicator W.P. Carey & Co. says it is among
those pondering the idea, which could affect its Corporate
Property Associates 3 included in the survey.</p>
<p>Public Storage Inc., a Glendale, Calif., sponsor has filed
preliminary plans with the SEC to convert two of its
partnerships to REITs, Public Storage Properties X Ltd. and
Public Storage Properties XI Ltd. But the conversion wouldn't
affect its partnership in the Journal survey, PS Partners VI
Ltd.</p>
<p>Another issue confronting many partnership investors
lately, is the prospect of changing management, as some
partnership syndicators sell their interests to others. One
partnership affected is Consolidated Capital Institutional
Properties 2, which is included in the survey.</p>
<p>Consolidated Capital Equities Corp. plans to sell its
general partner and management interests in that partnership
and 15 others it sponsored to ConCap Equities Inc., a newly
formed group of real estate development and property
management companies. The sale is subject to approval by
limited partners.</p>
