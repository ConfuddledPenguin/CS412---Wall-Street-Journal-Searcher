	<p class="article-leader">Stone Container Corp. and Waste Management Inc.
definitively agreed to form a paper-recycling joint venture,
which the two companies said they expect to become "the
world's largest marketing enterprise for recycled paper."
   The new company will sell paper collected by Oak Brook,
Ill.-based Waste Management, the nation's largest
waste-handling concern, and by third parties. Waste
Management is collecting increasing amounts of recyclable
paper, aluminum and plastic through its curbside collections,
under its Recycle America program.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Chicago-based Stone, which is already a big manufacturer
of recycled paper and has under way a $200 million program to
boost its capacity, will be "the major purchaser" of the old
corrugated boxes and newspapers the venture collects.</p>
<p>A major impediment to paper-recycling efforts has been the
absence of solid long-term markets for collected waste.</p>
