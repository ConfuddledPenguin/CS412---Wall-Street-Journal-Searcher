	<p class="article-leader">Campbell Soup Co. said it expects to break even in the
year ending July 29, reflecting continued troubles overseas
and recent weakness in several product categories.
   The projected results include a fourth-quarter charge of
$302 million, or $2.33 a share, for plant closures and
businesses put up for sale.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In fiscal 1989, the Camden, N.J., food company posted net
income of $13.1 million, or 10 cents a share, including a
charge of $201 million, or $2.02 a share, for a restructuring
begun in August.</p>
<p>Speaking to securities analysts in New York, Campbell
Chief Executive David W. Johnson said per-share operating
earnings for the year would be about $2.33 to $2.35,
significantly below analysts' estimates of $2.50 to $2.60.</p>
<p>In an apparent attempt to quell takeover rumors, Mr.
Johnson also said he believes members of Campbell's
controlling Dorrance family, who own 41% of the stock, are
opposed to a takeover.</p>
<p>Responding to a question, Mr. Johnson said two previously
undecided family members, Charlotte Weber and Tristram Colket
Jr., now favor independence, joining four cousins who have
disclosed their opposition to a sale.</p>
<p>"Charlotte and Tris have, as far as I'm concerned, shown a
move to the other line," Mr. Johnson said.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson cited continuing problems at Campbell's
Italian cookie business and some British frozen-food
operations as major reasons for Campbell's disappointing
financial performance. Campbell put both units up for sale
earlier this year.</p>
<p>In the current quarter, Campbell has also lost market
share in three U.S. food categories: dry soup, red-and-white
condensed soup and Le Menu frozen entrees.</p>
<p>But Mr. Johnson predicted that Campbell's earnings would
soon resurge. Over the next few years, he said, the company
will seek to achieve 20% annual growth in earnings, 20%
return on equity and 20% cash return on assets. Mr. Johnson
vowed to "make Campbell a premier performer in the peer group
of food companies."</p>
<p>In composite trading Monday on the New York Stock
Exchange, Campbell shares fell 12.5 cents to $55.875.</p>
<p>Separately, Standard & Poor's Corp. lowered its rating on
Campbell's senior debt to double-A from triple-A and affirmed
the company's A-1-plus commercial paper rating, affecting
about $500 million of debt.</p>
<p>In reducing the rating, S&P cited Campbell's recent
operating results, "balance sheet deterioration" and possible
changes in family ownership of the company. In addition,
"uncertainties exist about when and whether operations will
again reach levels consistent with the highest rating," S&P
said.</p>
<p>Moody's Investors Service Inc. also lowered its rating on
Campbell's long-term debt to double-A-2 from triple-A.</p>
