	<p class="article-leader">PITTSBURGH -- Aluminum Co. of America, hurt by sharply
lower aluminum ingot prices, reported that second-quarter
earnings fell 43% to $161.9 million, or $1.86 a share.
   A year earlier, Alcoa earned $285.2 million, or $3.21 a
share. Sales for the quarter fell slightly to $2.69 billion
from $2.76 billion in the 1989 second quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The results, which were in line with analysts'
expectations, reflect a 24% drop in aluminum ingot prices,
Alcoa said.</p>
<p>In addition, the results reflected revenue of only $6
million from the company's Brazilian affiliate, down from $61
million for the first half of 1989. The drop is linked to
actions taken by Brazil's government to improve that
country's economy. Lower fabricated activity also depressed
earnings.</p>
<p>For the six months, Alcoa reported earnings of $310.5
million, or $3.55 a share, down from $561.2 million, or $6.33
a share, a year ago. Sales were $5.33 billion, down from
$5.38 billion.</p>
<p>Earnings for the 1990 second quarter include favorable
translation and exchange adjustments of $9.9 million, or 11
cents a share, compared with $19.7 million, or 22 cents a
share, in the quarter the previous year. For the six months,
the favorable adjustments were $5.8 million, or seven cents a
share, compared with $20.9 million, or 24 cents a share, in
1989.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Alcoa closed
at $69.25, up 50 cents.</p>
