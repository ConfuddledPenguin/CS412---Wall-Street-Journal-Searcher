	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed to a
new record yesterday, closing just a fraction under 3000.
   The industrials closed 19.55 higher at 2999.75, the third
consecutive high.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In early trading it seemed as if the industrial average
would easily close above the 3000 mark. Many key earnings
reports turned out better than expected. International
Business Machines hit the high end of analysts' expectations,
announcing earnings of $2.45 a share for the second quarter.
Investors pushed the stock up 1 3/8 to 122 3/8 in turnover of
2.2 million shares.</p>
<p>United Technologies, another stock in the industrial
average, gained 1 1/2 to 60 3/8 after an upbeat earnings
announcement late Friday.</p>
<p>NCR Corp., a computer maker, rocketed 3 7/8 to 68 after
reporting strong second-quarter earnings, and other
technology issues followed the stock higher. Digital
Equipment, for example, climbed 7/8 to 85 1/8.</p>
<p>Yet for all the celebration, caution prevailed. As the
industrial average seesawed around the 3000 level yesterday,
the pace of trading began to slow in the afternoon -- a clear
sign that money managers aren't enthusiastically chasing
stocks to new highs. New York Stock Exchange volume was a
moderate 149,430,000 shares. The rally was fairly narrow: 868
issues advanced on the Big Board while 678 fell.</p>
<p>"It is probably the most unexciting record high I've
seen," said Robert Devine, head of equity trading at UBS
Securities. "There is no euphoria. A lot of money managers
have been in the wrong stocks, such as cyclicals," or shares
whose fortunes swing with the economy. "It's been a wacky
trip up; portfolio managers are not happy."</p>
<p>There are dozens of buy orders below current prices, says
Thomas Gallagher, head of equity trading at Oppenheimer & Co.
But many investors think the market is too expensive right
now. "Nobody is committing," said Mr. Gallagher.</p>
<p>Foreign investors, who can really push the stock market
when they jump in, were also buying lightly yesterday. "I am
surprised that the Japanese investors have not been in here
in a bigger way," said Thomas Callahan, senior vice president
at Yamaichi International (America) Inc. "The market's on the
move and that's the kind they like, but the way the currency
has been acting is a definite negative for them." Lately, the
dollar has been falling against the yen, which would diminish
returns on U.S. stocks for a Japanese investor.</p>
<p>Joseph DeMarco, head of equity trading at Marinvest,
added: "I don't know of any other industry where they are
setting new highs and people are so miserable." Mr. DeMarco
said he's cautious because of the lagging Dow utility index,
which fell 0.31 to 205.86 yesterday. The weak utility average
is a sign that interest rates aren't falling much further, he
said. "The stock market wants to see further easing" of
interest rates before it moves higher, he added.</p>
<p>Yesterday, investors sought out shares of banks with sound
earnings, while dumping those of several other financial
concerns.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan jumped 2 1/8 to 37 7/8; NCNB rose 1 3/4 to 36
1/2. Second-quarter net at Morgan rose slightly from a year
ago, while NCNB reported a 50% earnings increase.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan lost 1/2 to 20 3/4 on 2.4 million shares
after reporting that its second-quarter net fell 62%. First
Chicago declined 1 to 27 5/8; its net for the quarter fell
35%.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Hanover tumbled 7/8 to 30 7/8.
Prudential-Bache Securities issued a sell recommendation on
the stock and said the company's dividend may be vulnerable.
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the Fed is
developing additional steps to tighten banks' capital
requirements.</p>
<p>Among broader averages, Standard & Poor's 500-stock index
set an all-time high, climbing 1.64 to 368.95; the previous
mark was 367.40, set June 4. New records were also
established in the Dow Jones Equity Market Index, which
gained 1.45 to 342.67; and the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index, which rose 0.80 to 201.13.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas dropped 2 1/2 to 42 3/8 after outlining
a cost-cutting program, calling for a reduction of about 11%
in its work force and other moves, aimed at saving more than
$700 million annually.</p>
<p>Warrants of RJR Nabisco Holdings slipped 3/8 to 7 as the
company launched a $6.9 billion recapitalization program,
which will reduce its debt load. Among other things, the plan
calls for RJR to sell $1.7 billion of newly issued common
stock to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for $6.25 a share.</p>
<p>Cummins Engine advanced 3 1/8 to 54 3/8 after agreeing to
sell a 27% aggregate stake to Ford Motor, Tenneco and Kubota
of Japan for $250 million.</p>
<p>Mattel, which skidded 2 1/8 Friday, rebounded 1 7/8 to 22
3/4 after Kidder Peabody analyst Gary Jacobson made positive
comments on the stock. Mr. Jacobson said the earlier sell-off
was "unwarranted" and presented a buying opportunity.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index gained 1.59
to 365.58, but remains well below its all-time high of
397.03, established last October. Volume totaled 13,690,000
shares.</p>
<p>Wells-Gardner Electronics climbed 7/8 to 3 7/8 after
estimating that its second-quarter earnings at between 19
cents and 23 cents a share, compared with less than one cent
a share a year earlier.</p>
<p>New Line Cinema gained 7/8 to 16 1/4.</p>
<p>Live Entertainment announced an Oct. 4 release date for
its home-video version of the company's "Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles" movie.</p>
<p>Mitchell Energy & Development rose 3/4 to 18 1/8. Earnings
for the fiscal year ending next January could rise to around
75 cents a share from 65 cents a year ago, Barron's magazine
reported.</p>
