	<p class="article-leader">STAMFORD, Conn. -- Triangle Corp. directors adopted a
so-called poison-pill measure designed to make hostile
takeover bids prohibitively expensive.
   The tool manufacturer's board said that Triangle will
distribute rights to buy preferred stock to common-share
holders of record July 26. Under certain circumstances, the
rights would entitle the holders to buy Triangle's common
shares at half price.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Triangle's board adopted the poison pill in light of the
purchase of "an ownership position" in the company by Helmut
Rothenberger, chief executive officer of the Frankfurt
hand-tool manufacturer Rothenberger Werkzeuge AG.</p>
<p>"Mr. Rothenberger has not filed a Schedule 13-D with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and Triangle does not
know how much stock he (or any group of which he is a member)
intends to acquire," the company said.</p>
<p>Triangle also said it doesn't know what Mr. Rothenberger's
"intentions may be generally," adding that he says he is
willing "to acquire more shares at reasonable prices."</p>
