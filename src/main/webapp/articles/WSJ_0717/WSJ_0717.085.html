	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- The U.S. will try to build bridges to the
non-Communist political opposition in the Soviet Union, just
as Washington has reached out to other non-Communist
political groups in Eastern Europe, Secretary of State James
Baker said.
   "I don't think that's inappropriate just because it's the
Soviet Union," he said. He added that he agreed to some
extent with those who say the U.S. should step up contacts
with such Soviet opposition figures as Russian Republic
President Boris Yeltsin and the mayors of Moscow and
Leningrad, all of whom quit the Communist Party last week.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the secretary of state said only that the U.S. should
"touch base" with the Soviet opposition "to make sure that we
understand where the opposition is coming from, that they
understand where we are coming from."</p>
<p>That stops well short of the outright political support
the U.S. granted to non-Communist groups in Eastern Europe.
Mr. Baker gave no hint that the administration is planning to
withdraw its strong backing for President Mikhail Gorbachev,
who still heads the Soviet Communist Party.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the new policy represents a change. When Mr.
Yeltsin visited Washington last year, he was given a curt,
low-key reception, and administration officials later
expressed a dim view of him.</p>
<p>Separately, the U.S. has proposed that the four victorious
World War II powers retain their rights to approve Germany's
borders, even after that country is unified, until the
Germans sign a treaty guaranteeing their border with Poland.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker, who was flying here for the "two plus four"
talks on German unification, told reporters that the U.S.
will introduce this idea at the negotiations starting today.
The talks are being held by the foreign ministers of the two
Germanys and the four World War II victors -- the U.S., the
Soviet Union, Britain and France.</p>
<p>For this week's session of the talks, the third in the
series, the Polish foreign minister also will be present.
Last week, Poland demanded that the allies retain their
rights in Germany to help force adoption of a border treaty,
and Mr. Baker's comments appeared designed to reassure the
Poles.</p>
<p>The U.S. idea on the Polish border represents a rare move
by the Bush administration to pressure West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, who in recent months has been the Western leader
closest to the U.S. The aim is to reassure Poland that a
powerful united Germany won't violate Poland's border as Nazi
Germany did in 1939.</p>
<p>Mr. Kohl has insisted that for legal reasons such a treaty
can't be written until Germany is unified. But the Polish
government fears the Western powers will have no leverage if
they give up their World War II legal rights at the moment of
unification.</p>
<p>A senior administration official traveling with Mr. Baker
hinted that the U.S. might back off its idea if West Germany
and Poland can agree at today's meeting on some guarantee
that a simple, narrowly written border treaty will be
ratified quickly after the first all-German elections. The
elections are set for Dec. 2. He noted that Poland's
government has told the other powers it isn't aiming at
disrupting Germany's unification.</p>
<p>Even as a negotiating tactic, however, the U.S. proposal
represents a significant policy change. The U.S. has insisted
previously that the World War II victors relinquish all
rights when unification occurs.</p>
