	<p class="article-leader">The fraudulent dealings of one New York attorney are
costing members of the state bar millions of dollars in
restitution funds for dozens of bilked clients.
   Last week the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection, in
Albany, awarded $2.3 million to 61 former clients of Jack B.
Solerwitz, a former Long Island attorney now in prison for
grand larceny. There are 50 more claims pending, with losses
of more than $2 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"If not the largest case of client theft, it is certainly
close to the largest in the state's history," says Martin
Minkowitz, a partner at Stroock & Stroock & Lavan and
chairman of the state bar's Committee on Professional
Discipline.</p>
<p>Since March 1988, 149 former clients across the country
have claimed huge losses resulting from their dealings with
the 33-year old Mr. Solerwitz, who was disbarred in February
and who listed $4 million in debts on his personal-bankruptcy
filing in Nassau County (N.Y.) Court.</p>
<p>The Lawyers' Fund is an agency created by the state
finance law in 1981 to pay full or partial restitution to
victims of dishonest lawyers. There is a $100,000 limit for
each individual claim. The source of the agency's funds is
the membership of the New York bar -- about 90,000 practicing
lawyers.</p>
<p>Until this year, New York lawyers were required to pay a
$100 registration fee to the state every two years. Of that,
$50 went to the Lawyers' Fund. As of June 1990, the biannual
fee requirement has tripled. Of the $300 payment, $60 will go
to the client-security fund. And for at least the next year
most of the $60 will go to the victims of Mr. Solerwitz.</p>
<p>"There are those who now call the registration fee the
`Solerwitz Memorial Surcharge,'" says Grace Moran, deputy
counsel for the state's grievance committee for Nassau and
Suffolk counties on Long Island, who handled the part of the
case against Mr. Solerwitz involving his right to practice
law in the state.</p>
<p>In April, Mr. Solerwitz, who was once renowned for
representing 800 disenfranchised air traffic controllers in
the aftermath of the 1981 strike, pleaded guilty to grand
larceny in Nassau County Court. He admitted taking $1.8
million from escrow and other accounts of many clients. He
was recently sentenced to a prison term of 5 to 15 years.</p>
<p>Mr. Solerwitz, who practiced in Mineola, Long Island,
handled employment discrimination cases, divorces, and real
estate transactions. According to information in his victims'
claims, he bamboozled his clients in three ways, says Ms.
Moran, the lawyer at the grievance committee.</p>
<p>He would take fees without doing the requisite work, she
says. He would take down payments for houses, divorce
settlements and personal injury proceeds, place them in
escrow and use the money for his own purposes, she says. And
he would persuade people to lend him large sums of money.
"You would be amazed at how many people remortgaged their
homes to lend him money," says Ms. Moran.</p>
<p>"To this day, we are still getting complaints," she says.
"This morning, one called claiming $9,000 in losses. It was a
$9,000 personal injury settlement in which he had written a
bad check. I don't know when it will end."</p>

<p>JUSTICE DEPARTMENT admits it defamed former official.</p>
<p>In an unusual admission of error, the Justice Department
conceded that it had mistakenly accused Roger Pilon, a former
department official, of disclosing classified information to
a foreign government and then resigning from his post in the
face of removal proceedings.</p>
<p>The department made the admission, together with a formal
apology and a settlement of $25,000, in documents signed on
Thursday. But department officials didn't announce the action
publicly. Mr. Pilon, now an officer of the Cato Institute, a
Washington research group, disclosed the documents yesterday.</p>
<p>In a letter to Mr. Pilon's lawyer, Assistant Attorney
General Stuart Gerson acknowledged that a report widely
distributed last November by the department's Office of
Professional Responsibility "incorrectly stated" that a
counter-intelligence investigation into allegations that Mr.
Pilon had provided the South African government with
classified documents "discovered that sufficient cause
existed to terminate (Mr. Pilon's) political appointment."
The report also mistakenly stated that Mr. Pilon resigned
from his job as director of the department's office of asylum
policy "prior to the initiation of removal proceedings."</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. Gerson continued, the 1988 investigation
exonerated Mr. Pilon. After having been put on administrative
leave of absence, Mr. Pilon resumed his post and his "top
secret" security clearance was returned. Moreover, his
subsequent resignation "was not made in the face of removal
proceedings," Mr. Gerson wrote.</p>
<p>A department spokesman declined to answer questions as to
whether anyone in the Office of Professional Responsibility
would be disciplined for issuing the incorrect report.</p>
<p>Mr. Pilon called the incident a "Kafkaesque nightmare . .
. because we never knew where the accusations came from." His
wife, Juliana, also was investigated for allegedly disclosing
classified information, but she was never charged.</p>
<p>Rep. Don Edwards (D., Calif.), one of several lawmakers
who had pressured Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to
publicly exonerate Mr. Pilon, praised the admission, but he
added, "This apology is long overdue."</p>
