	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The investigative arm of Congress delivered
a scathing report on the financial-planning industry and
contended that the Securities and Exchange Commission's
oversight "may be doing more harm than good."
   The General Accounting Office study said that investors
may be misled by the SEC's implied "seal of approval" in
licensing financial planners. The process must be improved,
the GAO said, "to provide people who might use an adviser a
minimum level of assurance" that the adviser operates within
the law.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The GAO report focuses on an industry that has more than
tripled over the past decade to about 14,000 registered
advisers who now manage roughly $4.6 trillion in assets. As
its basis, the GAO used figures from other studies showing
that advisers defrauded investors of $90 million to $200
million a year. But the agency added that it thought the
figures were low, and some consumer groups put the annual
figure much higher.</p>
<p>In a response by Kathryn McGrath, former head of the
investment-management division, the SEC conceded that its
oversight is below par but quickly added that doing more
would require much more money. The report offers "laudable
goals that the staff would support in a cost-free
environment," Ms. McGrath said.</p>
<p>Last spring, Rep. Rick Boucher (D., Va.) unveiled a bill
that would force all financial planners to register with the
SEC, provide full written disclosure to clients of
compensation and allow customers to sue for damages. As
important, the legislation would give the SEC broader ability
to attack abuse by financial planners, including fining
power.</p>
<p>Rep. Boucher's bill isn't considered likely to go far this
year, and the first hearing on the matter will be held
tomorrow by the House subcommittee on telecommunications and
finance.</p>
<p>The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires financial
planners to register with the SEC. But the GAO reported that
a financial planners group, the International Association of
Financial Planning, estimated that there are 100,000 to
300,000 financial planners in the U.S.</p>
<p>Registration doesn't necessarily improve an investor's
chances of getting a competent adviser, the GAO said.
Planners don't need any training, said the GAO, which quoted
one industry official as saying, "It is easier to become a
registered investment adviser than to become a licensed
driver."</p>
<p>In one example, the GAO described a woman who lost her
life savings of $60,000 despite being "impressed" that the
adviser was SEC-registered.</p>
<p>Moreover, the report criticized the agency's inspection of
licensed advisers. The SEC usually inspects advisers for the
first time an average of three years after they are
registered, but many have never been inspected, the report
said.</p>
<p>The SEC has proposed setting up a self-regulatory
organization for financial planners, but that plan hasn't
gone far.</p>
<p>The GAO recommended that the SEC inspect all newly
registered advisers within a year and periodically afterward.
The SEC called the proposal "a good idea." Advisers shown to
be riskier should have a shorter leash, with inspections
every six months, the GAO said. In addition, the report
proposed that the SEC verify education and other experience
before granting registration.</p>
