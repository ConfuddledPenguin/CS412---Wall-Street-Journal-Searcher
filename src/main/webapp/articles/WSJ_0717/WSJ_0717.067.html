	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- The Dow Jones Industrial Average sprinted to
its third consecutive record, but fell short of closing at
3000 by just a quarter of a point.
   Much of the market's stride came from reports of strong
second-quarter earnings at some companies. International
Business Machines jumped 1 3/8 to 122 3/8 after announcing a
quarterly profit that was at the high end of analysts'
estimates.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Late profit-taking kept the industrial average below the
3000 benchmark, finishing at 2999.75, up 19.55. Trading
activity was a moderate 149.4 million shares in New York
Stock Exchange trading -- considerably slower than the 200
million-plus share turnovers on Thursday and Friday last
week.</p>
<p>Stocks dominated the action in financial markets. Bond
prices closed essentially unchanged. The dollar ended mixed.</p>
<p>Stock prices rose in early trading partly on IBM's
earnings news and similar good tidings from NCR. "Stocks have
some forward momentum, with the worst earnings news behind us
and earnings generally not declining as much as expected,"
said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Minneapolis-based
Norwest Corp. He also thinks investors are expecting further
declines in interest rates, which should help boost corporate
profits.</p>
<p>Other analysts are harder put to explain why the
industrial average has leaped 108.91 points over the past
four sessions.</p>
<p>Steven Einhorn, portfolio strategist at Goldman Sachs,
said investors are so busy buying stocks they are overlooking
fundamental concerns that normally would slow the market's
gains.</p>
<p>"We are in an overvalued market that looks like it wants
to get more overvalued, independent of bonds, independent of
earnings, independent of the dollar," he said. "Investors
appear to want to own only one asset. That's the default
reason for it going up, but that isn't the kind of market
that will play to the strengths of a fundamentalist. The
market has been irrepressible."</p>
<p>Stock investors have had all the right reasons one could
want to sell, Mr. Einhorn said: a Fed easing on interest
rates that was slow in coming and modest, a
weaker-than-expected dollar, some earnings disappointments
and a yearlong decline in the margin of rising stocks over
falling stocks.</p>
<p>But a rising market makes people who have a lot of cash
nervous, Mr. Einhorn said. "They don't want to miss something
that could be powerful and extended, whether they're
fundamentally bullish or not." While the 3000 mark itself has
no magical significance, "it can add impetus psychologically
as we get close to it" for those portfolio managers feeling
pressure to jump on the bandwagon, he said.</p>
<p>Frank A. Cappiello Jr., president of San Francisco-based
McCullough, Andrews & Cappiello, a money manager, agreed that
stocks are the place to be for investors. "The only game in
town now in total return is stocks," he said. "Gold is bad
news. Real estate is more big chasms and bottomless pits to
come. Bonds have been more volatile than stocks over the past
two years, and I think people have been intuitively aware of
it."</p>
<p>Mr. Cappiello said there is ample reason to believe the
market has room to climb further. He cited continued positive
earnings news and the belief that interest rates are going to
come down further before they go up.</p>
<p>Bond traders didn't act like they saw lower rates coming.
Bond prices closed unchanged, with investors having digested
Friday's drop in interest rates and awaiting pivotal economic
news later this week.</p>
<p>The dollar was stronger than expected but ended mixed;
traders are awaiting Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's semiannual
economic and monetary review tomorrow for signs that fighting
inflation remains the Fed's top priority.</p>
<p>In major market action:</p>
<p>Stock prices rose. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners,
868 to 678.</p>
<p>Bond prices were flat. The yield on the Treasury's
benchmark 30-year bond stood to 8.45%.</p>
<p>The dollar was mixed. In late New York trading, the
currency was quoted at 1.6547 marks, compared with 1.6510
marks Friday, and unchanged at 148.15 yen.</p>
