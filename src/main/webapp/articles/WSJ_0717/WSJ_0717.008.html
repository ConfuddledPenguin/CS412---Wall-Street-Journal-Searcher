	<p class="article-leader">DIBOLL, Texas -- Temple-Inland Inc. reported net income
rose 24% in the second quarter because of a decrease in tax
rates, despite lower operating earnings in most of its
businesses.
   Earnings rose to $65.7 million, or $1.18 a share, from
$52.9 million or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
rose to $587 million from $489 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the first six months, net rose 19% to $127.9 million,
or $2.30 a share, from $107.4 million, or $1.94 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose to $1.2 billion from $963 million.</p>
<p>The company's container and containerboard group, its
largest segment, said operating earnings declined about 26%
in the quarter. Temple-Inland said that though box shipments
"remained strong," average selling prices of corrugated
cardboard declined and manufacturing costs increased.
Bleached paperboard earnings also declined.</p>
<p>The company's financial services group, however, reported
operating earnings of $15.1 million compared with $1.1
million a year earlier. The company said Guaranty Federal
Savings Bank contributed $7 million to operating earnings.
The tax savings that boosted earnings for the quarter came as
a result of tax benefits associated with the purchase of
Guaranty.</p>
