	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW DROPPED its objections to a united Germany being a
NATO member.
   The decision, announced by President Gorbachev after two
days of talks with West German Chancellor Kohl, removes the
last major hurdle to German unity. Gorbachev said it was the
right of a sovereign Germany to choose which military
alliance it belonged to. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Baker
said the U.S. will try to build bridges to the non-Communist
political opposition in the Soviet Union, just as Washington
has reached out to other non-Communist political groups in
Eastern Europe. Baker was on his way to Paris for the "two
plus four" negotiations concerning German unification.</p>

<p>THE PHILIPPINES WAS HIT by its most severe earthquake in
14 years.</p>
<p>The quake jolted Manila and surrounding Luzon island,
killing over 100 people, injuring more than 100 and leaving
others pinned under buildings. Nearly 1,000 people were
reported trapped in four luxury hotels and other buildings in
the mountain resort of Baguio. The temblor, which measured
7.7 on the Richter scale, slightly damaged buildings and
knocked out power in Manila. Most casualties were reported
north of the capital in densely populated central Luzon.</p>
<p>The search for victims was hampered by poor communications
and lack of equipment, and government agencies differed on
the casualty count.</p>

<p>The Bush administration ordered a review by outside
experts of the U.S.'s long-term space goals after several

forecasting, and the vice president also emphasized that
"there is no White House investigation of NASA."</p>

<p>French researchers reported promising results from a
10-year study in which they treated breast cancer without

breast cancer.</p>

<p>Backers of Poland's premier formed a political party,
sealing their break with Solidarity union leader Walesa. More

trying to destabilize the government.</p>

<p>A trial opened in Reno, Nev., in a suicide case against
the band Judas Priest and CBS Records. Relatives of two young
men who shot themselves in 1985 are alleging that the victims

Class." Band members deny such messages exist.</p>

<p>The African National Congress sent a report on alleged
police violence to South Africa's president, demanding an end
to what one black leader called the "shocking inhumanity" of
police in rural areas. Separately, U.N. Secretary-General
Perez de Cuellar praised de Klerk's policies but said
Pretoria needs to stem right-wing violence.</p>

procedures mandated in recent years to guard against
cracking, metal fatigue and other such problems.</p>

remember the incident.</p>
