	<p class="article-leader">Creditors of Revco D.S. Inc. may have grounds to sue
former shareholders and others responsible for Revco's failed
$1.25 billion leveraged buy-out, according to a preliminary
report by a court-appointed special examiner.
   In the report filed late yesterday in federal court in
Akron, Ohio, Barry L. Zaretsky, the Revco examiner, said it
appears the management-led buy-out left the company with
insufficient working capital to continue as a going concern.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Therefore, Mr. Zaretsky wrote, creditors of the company,
now in bankruptcy court proceedings, have grounds to sue the
selling shareholders, investment bankers and others for
defrauding creditors through a so-called fraudulent
conveyance. But he recommended that any such suit be
postponed in hope that a voluntary reorganization plan can be
agreed on.</p>
<p>Mr. Zaretsky preliminarily found that projections used to
support the buy-out group's analysis of the viability of the
deal may not have been properly prepared. And while Mr.
Zaretsky wrote that it was still too early to determine
whether Revco was essentially bankrupt immediately after the
buy-out, he said certain indications of insolvency were
present.</p>
<p>A lawyer for Revco said he couldn't comment because he
hadn't yet read the report. Creditors' lawyers couldn't be
reached.</p>
<p>Under fraudulent-conveyance law, creditors must prove that
the selling shareholders or others involved in the
transaction intended to defraud creditors or that the effect
of the deal was to leave the company insolvent, unable to pay
its debt or without enough capital to conduct its business.
In some states, a suit can be brought as many as six years
after the buy-out occurs. Under the law, anyone involved in
the fraudulent transfer can be held liable.</p>
<p>Fraudulent conveyance laws can be used to attack
transactions of any size, but many bankruptcy lawyers have
argued that the law, which was first adopted by some states
in the U.S. in 1918 and is based on 16th-century English
common law, should not apply to modern business transactions
such as leveraged buy-outs. In a leveraged buy-out, the
purchase of the company is financed largely by debt that is
to be repaid with funds generated by the acquired company's
operations or the sale of its assets. Bankruptcy lawyers say
the law was never intended for such complex transactions.</p>
<p>Mr. Zaretsky's findings may therefore be controversial.
"My research suggests that fraudulent conveyance applies to
leveraged buy-out deals, that highly aggressive
leveraged-buy-out deals may create significant fraudulent
conveyance risks," Mr. Zaretsky said.</p>
<p>As a result, the report may play a role in how future LBOs
are structured. Particularly if the report triggers a
successful fraudulent conveyance suit in the Revco case,
financial institutions may decide to write down loans made to
companies that took on huge amounts of debt during Wall
Street's go-go 1980s.</p>
<p>In many cases corporations financed their own buy-outs
with so-called junk or high-yield bonds. As the economy has
cooled, or the LBO company hasn't been able to generate
enough cash to meet interest payments and other obligations,
more and more have sought protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code.</p>
<p>Such was the case in July 1988 when Revco, then a
2,000-store drugstore chain based in Twinsburg, Ohio, became
the largest junk bond-financed leveraged buy-out to file for
protection from creditors. Since then Revco hasn't been able
to put together a plan to re-emerge from bankruptcy that
suits its various debtholders and creditors.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the report recommends that no litigation be
commenced immediately, in hope of stimulating the parties to
reach agreement on a reorganization plan. If the debtors do
not reach such a plan by November, the report advocates
bringing litigation to avoid the risk of losing the right to
do so. According to the report, other actions under
consideration that would have to be brought by the end of
1990 include negligence, breach of duties owed to the debtors
and breach of contract. Mr. Zaretsky indicated in the report
that he is still investigating these issues but that his
preliminary analysis suggests that those actions alone could
return millions of dollars to the estates.</p>
<p>In addition, the report determined that the buy-out itself
is not the only fraudulent conveyance action available. At
the time of the buy-out, nearly $80 million in fees was paid
to various professionals and the banks, and, the report
states, "these may have been grossly disproportionate to the
benefit, if any, received by the debtors." Mr. Zaretsky said
that among the professionals who may be liable are lawyers,
investment bankers, accountants and appraisers who worked on
the deal, but he said his investigation was not far enough
along to determine precisely who might be sued.</p>
<p>The report said legal action could be filed against these
parties for recovery of the fees, whether or not the buy-out
is attacked. And Mr. Zaretsky wrote that he would consider
filing litigation concerning paydowns, extra interest and
security interests granted on the notes and debentures to
facilitate the buy-out even if a reorganization plan is
ultimately reached.</p>
<p>Under fraudulent-conveyance law, former shareholders of
the company could be ordered to return the cash they received
for their shares. But Mr. Zaretsky indicated in the report
that he hoped to find a remedy that would not involve such
disgorgement.</p>
<p>Because the fraudulent conveyance field is still
relatively new territory in terms of LBOs, Mr. Zaretsky said
he was still exploring possible remedies. But he said that he
hoped to develop theories that, in essence, would reorder the
priority of the estate's debts and make the estate solvent.</p>
<p>Under these theories, unsecured general creditors would be
paid in full with interest, at the expense of parties who
contributed to the fraudulent conveyance.</p>
<p>The report also indicated that liability may extend to
certain members of Revco's former senior management,
including Sidney Dworkin, Mark Dworkin and William Edwards,
who may have received payments disproportionate to their
stock when they left the company. The report estimated that
the estate could recover $8 million to $12 million if actions
against the men were pursued.</p>
<p>"The report will fuel the flames and induce other
participants in LBOs to seek to reverse them," said Joel
Wolosky, a lawyer with the New York law firm of Parker Chapin
Flattau & Klimpl, who represents a shareholder and two
directors of Wieboldt Stores Inc. in a fraudulent conveyance
suit involving the store's buy-out.</p>
<p>Mr. Zaretsky, who is a Brooklyn Law School professor and
counsel at the New York law firm of Kelley Drye & Warren,
said his report indicates that "in the long run, lenders to
highly aggressive LBO deals will be hurt."</p>
<p>A lawyer for the banks said he could not comment on the
report because he hadn't yet read it. Lawyers for the trade
creditors and noteholders couldn't be reached for comment.</p>
