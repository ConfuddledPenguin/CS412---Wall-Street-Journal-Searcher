	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- When Home Depot Inc. opened its first
home-improvement stores in the Northeast last year, it took
the uncommon and expensive step of relocating dozens of
people to head departments such as plumbing and paint.
   Why bother to move hourly employees hundreds of miles to
sell cans of paint? The company wanted the new stores to be
headed by employees bred in the Home Depot culture, people
who "bleed orange," a term of honor derived from store
workers' orange aprons.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With a culture that stresses candor among employees and a
commitment to service that transcends lip service, Home Depot
has remodeled the more than $100 billion home-improvement
industry and become one of the nation's fastest-growing
retailers. In sales per square foot, an important measure of
retail performance, Home Depot's $303 figure last year beat
out the likes of Sears, Roebuck & Co., K mart Corp. and
Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</p>
<p>Enamored with such numbers, Wall Street has pushed up Home
Depot's stock price about 77% this year -- a jump that comes
despite a cloudier industry outlook and regrouping efforts by
competitors.</p>
<p>Home Depot has become the largest home-repair chain in the
business by winning over customers first with broad selection
and low prices. In each of its 126 stores in the South and on
the East and West coasts, Home Depot sells more than 30,000
fix-it items, triple the number for typical hardware stores.
In its spartan warehouses with ceiling rafters and concrete
floors, the company has been able to slash costs,
undercutting hardware stores by 20% and matching or beating
its warehouse competitors.</p>
<p>More important, though, is the company's slavish attention
to service, sometimes won by playing hardball with
manufacturers. Using its volume-buying clout, Home Depot
demands that the makers of products, such as certain light
fixtures and gas grills, rewrite instructions it deems
incomprehensible. It has strong-armed vendors into putting
bar codes on such unwieldy items as plywood and wood dowels
to speed up checkout lines. And it hires former electricians
and tradespeople to ensure that shoppers get skilled advice.</p>
<p>"Trying to wed two conflicting strategies -- low-cost
structure with broad assortment and a high level of customer
service -- is arguably one of the most difficult retail
concepts to pull off," says David Bolotsky, an analyst with
Goldman, Sachs & Co. "Home Depot is further along the
learning curve than anyone else."</p>
<p>That curve, though, has had its share of rough spots. Five
years ago, rapid expansion hurt the company. Stretched too
thin, management was forced to curtail new-store openings and
to sell off some properties after earnings took a dive. "That
was a tremendous strain," concedes Bernard Marcus, Home
Depot's 61-year-old chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Earnings have rebounded since then. In its year ended Jan.
28, Home Depot's net income jumped 46% to $112 million, or
$1.42 a share, and sales climbed 38% to $2.76 billion, the
most in the industry. With those numbers behind it, the
company believes its current plan to triple in size to about
365 stores by 1995 is manageable.</p>
<p>Maybe. Sales in the home-improvement market are slowing.
Partly as a result of a softer housing market, home-repair
industry sales are expected to climb only 1% to 6% annually
in the next five years, compared with the 7% to 15% surges in
much of the 1980s, according to Management Horizons, a Price
Waterhouse consulting unit that tracks the retail industry.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Home Depot has forced some retailers to
copy its warehouse format. K mart, for one, developed
Builders Square, a warehouse chain that has grown to 145
stores since the mid-1980s. But analysts believe Builders
Square, despite having more stores, is weaker in service,
selection and presentation of products.</p>
<p>Competitors also have begun playing on Home Depot's
weaknesses. Some building-material chains, such as Lowe's
Cos., North Wilkesboro, N.C., are pursuing sales to small
contractors, an important clientele that Home Depot recently
has been trying to target more. Some smaller hardware chains
have adopted a convenience-store orientation, eschewing
discounts and selection while opening more stores to become
more accessible to shoppers.</p>
<p>Still other stores, including Builders Square, are trying
to steal sales from Home Depot by offering professional
installation services for items such as gutters and roof
shingles. This type of service, which Home Depot says it has
begun to experiment with, is particularly well suited for a
growing number of consumers termed buy-it-yourselfers. They
purchase products such as kitchen cabinets for bargain prices
at home centers, then hire someone to do the installation.</p>
<p>The stores that have had the most trouble responding to
Home Depot are independent stores lacking strong roots in
their communities. "Right now, when Home Depot goes into an
area, they just cut up and spit out the independents," says
Walter Stoeppelwerth, a remodeling consultant in Bethesda,
Md.</p>
<p>Much of Home Depot's success comes from the culture it's
developed. Mr. Marcus and President Arthur Blank, the pair
who founded the company in 1978, encourage a fierce
competiveness. At sales meetings, managers cheer cartoons of
Homer, Home Depot's handyman mascot, visiting competitors in
hospital beds and unplugging their life-support systems.</p>
<p>The founders also take pains to encourage a high level of
candor in the company. Once each quarter, the executives
answer impromptu questions from any of Home Depot's army of
20,000 employees in orange aprons on a live talk-and-rally
session beamed by satellite to the stores.</p>
<p>At a February meeting, store managers got to poke fun at
the company's merchandise buyers in a contest to pick the
worst product of the year. Entries included an electric
heater that wouldn't shut off, a ceiling fan that shook and
hummed, and a flimsy paint tray that sagged when paint was
poured into it.</p>
<p>The buyers weren't overly ashamed, though, because Home
Depot puts a premium on experimentation. No adherent to the
"if it ain't broke, don't fix it" philosophy, the company is
constantly tinkering with its merchandise mix. Going beyond
the faucets and cabinets that it already offers for kitchen
remodeling, for example, the company has begun to test sales
of refigerators and stoves.</p>
<p>Home Depot also takes steps to prevent dilution of its
culture. Store managers, who typically earn a $45,000 base
salary, are never hired from outside. The highest entry-level
position in the stores is assistant manager. Once the
assistant learns the culture and proves he's adept at
training others, he may advance to store manager. Mr. Marcus
and Mr. Blank, who spend about 40% of their time visiting
stores, are personally involved in training every manager --
a practice likely to be strained by the company's rapid
growth.</p>
<p>Training for store workers stresses taking care of
customers first, then stocking shelves. That way, the
stocking becomes the interruption, instead of the other way
around. Sometimes, however, workers become so busy with
shoppers that pallets of merchandise sit untended, blocking
aisles -- a problem that Mr. Marcus acknowledges. Among other
things, the company is studying the use of special night
crews to stock shelves.</p>
<p>Having highly trained, ready-to-serve salespeople helps
Home Depot in its mission to give novice do-it-yourselfers
the confidence to try increasingly complex and expensive
projects. "Most of us aren't plumbers," says Leonard Berry,
director of Texas A&M University's Retailing Studies Center.
"Home Depot helps you through the mystery of home upkeep."</p>
<p>It did for Robert and Phyllis Witherington, bankers by
day, home tinkerers by night. They were recently in a Home
Depot in Kennesaw, Ga., outside Atlanta, buying some paint
for their garage. Mr. Witherington mentioned to the paint
salesman that his front porch steps were in disrepair. The
salesman directed Mr. Witherington to a display with several
types of concrete and pamphlets on concrete repair. Knowing
they can find solid advice and the proper materials for
projects, the Witheringtons are now planning a complex and
costly job -- expanding their deck.</p>
