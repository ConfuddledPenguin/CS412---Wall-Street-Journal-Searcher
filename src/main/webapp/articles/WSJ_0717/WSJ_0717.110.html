	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The House voted for legislation that would
require more vigorous scrutiny of older jetliners to ensure
they are safe to fly.
   The bill, approved by voice vote, would require the
Federal Aviation Administration to inspect aging planes to
determine whether they are in compliance with maintenance
procedures mandated in recent years to guard against
cracking, metal fatigue and other age-related problems.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The special FAA inspections would occur every four or five
years for planes 15 years or older. Proponents said the
stepped-up reviews are needed to ensure the safety of older
jetliners; 28% of the nation's jetliners are over 20 years
old, and that percentage will rise as planes are kept in
service longer than was originally planned.</p>
<p>"Under the legislation, an inspection will be required in
which a straightforward question will be asked: `Is this old
airplane safe?'" said Rep. James Oberstar, (D., Minn.),
chairman of the House Aviation Subcommittee. "Aircraft will
not be permitted to return to service until the answer is
`yes.'"</p>
<p>The potential problems involving aging airliners was
illustrated in April 1988, when an Aloha Airlines plane lost
the top of its fuselage, killing a flight attendant. The
incident prompted the FAA and the airline industry to develop
more stringent policies for older aircraft.</p>
