	<p class="article-leader">Bamberger Polymers Inc., New Hyde Park, N.Y., said 11
members of its sales force in the Northeast and West Coast
divisions quit, which will have an adverse effect on
third-quarter sales and earnings.
   In the third quarter a year earlier, the plastics company
earned $159,000, or five cents a share, on sales of $41
million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Company officials said they would take "all legal action
available" if they determine that the sales employees "have
acted in concert to interfere" with its business
relationships.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange,
Bamberger shares closed at $2.25 a share, down 25 cents a
share.</p>
<p>Officials couldn't be reached to elaborate on the
