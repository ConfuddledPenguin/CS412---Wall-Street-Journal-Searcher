	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A First Boston Corp. executive who played a
pivotal role in negotiating the firm's merger two years ago
is leaving, in the latest high-level management change at the
big securities firm.
   Michael Duval, a managing director, will depart this week
to launch a small investment banking boutique specializing in
international merger deals.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The 52-year-old Mr. Duval helped structure First Boston's
merger with its bigger Credit Suisse First Boston affiliate
in 1988; that move effectively gave control of First Boston
to Credit Suisse, the giant Swiss bank. A former president of
First Boston's real estate unit and once the firm's No. 5
executive, he was removed from its management committee this
year, after John Hennessy took over as president and chief
executive officer.</p>
<p>In an internal notice to employees, Mr. Hennessy said Mr.
Duval "has made an outstanding contribution to the firm,
especially in our merger and privatization transactions, as
well as in our compliance efforts."</p>
<p>Despite his clipped wings, Mr. Duval's departure is a blow
to First Boston. The firm, battered in the past year by
turmoil stemming from the collapse of the high-yield,
below-investment-grade "junk" bond market, has slipped
recently in Wall Street's underwriting rankings. The
securities firm earned just $11 million last year.</p>
<p>Since the merger, a number of traders and executives have
departed. In June, First Boston lost David C. Batten -- he
had been a managing director since 1978 and played a major
role in building the firm's corporate finance business -- to
Blackstone Group. Other recent defections included the
government-bond trading head, David Bunting, and several
other traders, moves triggered by a bond trading shake-up at
the firm. Earlier this year, William E. Mayer, First Boston's
chief executive, was bumped aside to head a new merchant
banking unit at the firm.</p>
<p>A First Boston spokesman declined to elaborate on the
internal memo about Mr. Duval's resignation.</p>
<p>Mr. Duval, meanwhile, has agreed to be a consultant to
First Boston on Washington issues, including international
banking and tax matters. He is known as much in political
circles as in the securities arena. In the late 1960s, he was
an attorney with the U.S. Transportation Department and
joined the White House staff in 1970. Appointed special
counsel to President Gerald Ford in 1974, he helped develop
Mr. Ford's economic and energy policies.</p>
<p>While Mr. Duval wasn't widely known to the public, he was
an important behind-the-scenes investment banker at First
Boston. Within the firm, he is best known for structuring and
negotiating the merger between First Boston and Credit
Suisse, a deal that took the securities firm private. First
Boston's parent, CS First Boston Inc., is 44.5%-owned by CS
Holding, which owns Credit Suisse.</p>
<p>Mr. Duval joined First Boston in 1984 after seven years at
Mead Corp., where he was senior vice president and chief
strategic officer. Among other things, Mr. Duval played a
major role in Mead's strategic restructuring.</p>
<p>His new venture, named the Duval Group, will focus on an
area Mr. Duval sees burgeoning in the 1990s: international
mergers between companies driven by strategic concerns. For
the next few months, Mr. Duval will hammer out financial
backing for the venture, which he expects to launch in
January; he will start with about two dozen professionals.</p>
<p>"The opportunity here is to build the venture myself and
have a major ownership in it," Mr. Duval said. "That's an
opportunity First Boston couldn't offer me."</p>
<p>Among his other jobs, Mr. Duval was a top executive in
First Boston's compliance area. The firm's general counsel,
Michael Zeiss, now will report to Mr. Hennessy, instead of
Mr. Duval, according to the internal notice to employees. A
successor to Mr. Duval isn't likely to be named.</p>
