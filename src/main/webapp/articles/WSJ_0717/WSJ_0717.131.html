	<p class="article-leader">Maxicare Health Plans Inc., which filed for bankruptcy law
protection in March 1989, said that a bankruptcy court judge
in Santa Ana, Calif., approved its reorganization plan.
   Maxicare said in Los Angeles it needs to raise additional
cash before it can emerge from bankruptcy-law proceedings,
which a spokesman said the company hopes to do by Oct. 1.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The reorganization plan calls for creditors and
shareholders to receive $129.3 million in cash, $67 million
in notes and newly issued common shares and warrants.
Maxicare said it expects the new securities to be traded in
the over-the-counter market.</p>
<p>Maxicare was once the nation's largest publicly traded
health maintenance organization with more than two million
members in 26 states. After its huge debt payments exceeded
its revenue, Maxicare was forced to close or sell many of its
health plans and lost many of its members. Maxicare now has
about 300,000 members in seven states.</p>
