	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Southland Corp. said it agreed in principle on a
fourth restructuring proposal with its bondholders' steering
committee and a Japanese suitor, averting a possible
bankruptcy-law filing and avoiding a showdown over late
interest payments.
   The agreement changes significantly the details of a
debt-exchange offer from the company this month, increasing
the face value of the publicly held bonds offered in exchange
for current bonds while reducing the interest rates. The
accord also increases the cash infusion by Ito-Yokado Co. to
$430 million from $400 million and reduces the equity
retained by the founding Thompson family.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>This year, Ito-Yokado, operator of 7-Eleven stores in
Japan, offered to buy 75% of the company, contingent on a
restructuring of Southland's debt and preferred. Yesterday's
agreement reduces that stake to 70%.</p>
<p>Southland, the troubled parent of the 7-Eleven retail
convenience stores, had said that it didn't intend to make a
June 15 interest payment on its senior subordinated debt.
That payment officially went into default Sunday. Without an
agreement with senior debtholders, the company could have
been forced into bankruptcy proceedings yesterday.</p>
<p>This plan is the fourth restructuring proposal written by
the company this year, but it is the first accepted by the
bondholders' committee, which represents about 70% of the
public debtholders. The latest proposal reduces the equity of
existing shareholders including the Thompson family to about
5% from 6.5% in the third proposal and 15% in the original
plan. And while reducing Ito-Yokado's equity to 70%, the
proposal gives bondholders about 25% of the company's common,
up from 18.5% in the third proposal.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that the bondholders took "meaningful
haircuts" in this restructuring proposal, bondholder
committee chairman John Gordon of Deltec Securities Corp.
said the proposal gives them "as much as they could
reasonably expect to get" out of the restructuring. "All of
us are very enthusiastic about what the new owners will be
able to do with this business," said Mr. Gordon. He said the
proposal increased the value of the exchange offer to
bondholders by about 15% and was unanimously approved by the
committee.</p>
<p>All bondholders weren't pleased, though. "I'm not happy,"
said George Nicholas, a Dallas holder of some of the
company's 15 3/4% and 16 3/4% bonds who filed suit against
Southland in a Dallas County court yesterday, seeking payment
of the interest due June 15. The new agreement doesn't change
his sentiments, he said. "It's supposedly a great deal for
us, but it's just smoke and mirrors to me," he said. Mr.
Nicholas said the deal cuts interest payments on his bonds to
about one-third of the original levels, and although it
increases the face value of the notes, the new proposal
raises the value of the deal by "not much more than a couple
of cents."</p>
<p>The exchange offer still requires the approval of numerous
creditors, preferred stockholders and banks. The company said
it will file its prospectus for the debt exchange with the
Securities and Exchange Commission as soon as possible and
hopes to complete the debt restructuring by mid-August.</p>
<p>Southland, which owns about 6,700 7-Eleven and other
convenience stores in the U.S. and Canada, went private in a
$4.9 billion leveraged buy-out in late 1987 to avoid a
possible hostile bid by the Belzberg family of Canada.
Increased competition eroded sales and profit margins and
made it difficult for the company to service the huge debt
from the buy-out.</p>
