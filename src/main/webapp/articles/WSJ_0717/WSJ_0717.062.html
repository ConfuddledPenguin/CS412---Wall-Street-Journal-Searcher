	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Need cash? Call a pension fund.
   While government officials fret about the threat of a
credit crunch, cash-flush pension funds are pumping billions
of dollars into a myriad of new investment pools. Their
goals: big returns from investing in everything from
salvaging companies overloaded with debt and buying bankrupt
securities (two of the most popular strategies) to investing
in European real estate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"The source of funds for deals used to be insurance
companies and banks," says Charles H. Salisbury Jr., a
marketing executive for money manager T. Rowe Price
Associates, Baltimore. "Now the only ones with excess capital
are pension funds."</p>
<p>So, at a time when Wall Street is shrinking many of its
operations, organizers of some limited partnership funds for
socalled alternative investments are scoring impressive
successes. E.M. Warburg Pincus & Co. recently completed
raising a $1.8 billion pool to finance corporate turnarounds
and other investments, with much of the money coming from
pension funds, including $100 million from the giant
California Public Employees Retirement System.</p>
<p>Last week, a partnership organized by Chicago investors
Sam Zell and David Schulte succeeded in raising $1 billion
from big investors to rescue troubled companies. That
included $30 million from the Minnesota state public employee
pension fund and $10 million from AMR Investment Services,
which runs the American Airlines pension fund. Mr. Schulte
says that 50% of the money for the new partnership was raised
from corporate pension funds and another 24% from
public-employee pension funds.</p>
<p>Even excluding the new Zell-Chilmark fund, $2 billion has
been raised by various turnaround and bankruptcy-investing
partnerships, according to Tremont Partners Inc., New Caanan,
Conn., consultants. Tremont has compiled a directory of 50
bankruptcy funds, including 10 that have begun shopping for
money since April. "I find that remarkable," says Mary Ann
Johnson, Tremont's president.</p>
<p>Despite the success of some fund-raisers, it is clearly a
buyer's market. The cash hoards of the big pension funds
allow them to be picky about the partnerships they will back
with investments, and to demand better financial terms from
sponsors.</p>
<p>National Investment Management Inc., a California
investment firm with five funds under its belt, started to
raise money for a new small-company leveraged buy-out fund in
January and February by sending out 500 proposal books to
foundations, endowments, pension funds, insurers and banks.
During the next three months, it followed up with telephone
calls to each prospect. "Forty said come see us, and from
that maybe 20 will invest," said National partner Kenneth
Finn, adding: "We'd be thrilled with $50 million."</p>
<p>With many highly leveraged companies in trouble, sponsors
are discovering that money for new LBO funds is especially
hard to find. "Anybody who is raising an LBO fund will tell
you it is tough going," says Richard Schmeelk, a former
Salomon Brothers banker who has worked in Canada, and now is
pushing a new fund for CAI Advisors & Co. to specialize in
buy-outs of Canadian companies.</p>
<p>Targeting geographic or industry niches is becoming a
standard marketing tactic for today's LBO fund-raisers.
Conseco Capital Partners purchases only insurance companies,
for example, and Kansas City-based Reimer & Koger Associates
Inc. is starting to market a fund to buy Oklahoma companies.
(It will have the backing of the state government, which will
guarantee investors against the loss of half the money they
put into the fund.)</p>
<p>Pension-fund managers are jumping at many of the other
investment pitches, however. With assets totaling more than
$2.5 trillion, pension funds are brimming with cash looking
for a home. Previously, they have been big backers of
alternative investments, such as venture capital, oil and gas
partnerships and, in their heyday, LBO funds.</p>
<p>Investments off the beaten path promise diversity and
higher returns than their portfolios of stocks and bonds, the
managers believe. Further, pension funds, especially those
for state and local government employees, expect to be around
forever; that allows them to tie up chunks of their assets
for years, as is often required with alternative investments.</p>
<p>"There is just an enormous amount of money available for
enhanced-return investment products," says Jerome P. Greene
of Benedetto, Gartland & Greene Inc., which sells privately
placed securities to pension funds and other big investors.</p>
<p>Just how much money pension funds will pour into the
latest alternative investment pools isn't clear. But even a
small percentage of pension assets means billions of dollars
flowing away from public stock and bond markets and into the
unseen world of private investments.</p>
<p>The California Public Employees Retirement System, for
example, recently earmarked 2% of the fund for alternative
investments, which investment chief DeWitt Bowman says will
provide a "toe-in-the-water" baptism in the private market
area. It's a big toe, as the allocation will amount to more
than $1 billion for the $58 billion California fund.</p>
<p>Thomas E. Flanigan, chief investment officer of the $30
billion California State Teachers Retirement System, expects
pension funds eventually to shift 20% to 25% of their assets
to alternative fields, which he defines as anything outside
publicly traded stocks and bonds and U.S. real estate.</p>
<p>Mr. Flanigan says that pension funds like his, which is
growing by $4 billion a year, are becoming the primary source
of investment funds in the U.S. "We are going to be aligning
ourselves with multinational corporations and going into
partnerships on an international basis," he predicts.</p>
<p>Making such deals routine will take years, however. In the
meantime, "No one has a concept that is big enough to absorb
the capital that first went into venture funds and then
leveraged buy-out funds," says Steven P. Galante, managing
director of Venture Economics Inc., which tracks the venture
and buy-out activity.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some industry experts worry that pension
officials are getting caught up in investment fads that could
prove dangerous. "All these limited partnerships that have
been offered to the pension funds are on the high-risk side,"
says Ronald D. Peyton, president of pension consultants
Callan Associates Inc.</p>
<p>But big investors are improving the odds by using their
clout to squeeze more generous terms out of partnership
organizers. For example, the standard management fee for
partnership organizers, formerly 2% of the assets under
management each year, is now more often 1 1/2% or less in new
funds.</p>
<p>"A few years ago we would have made it 2%, but we wanted
to remove as many of the barriers as we could" to attract
investors, says Thomas Hicks, a Dallas-based investment
banker who has raised $160 million for a new LBO fund and
hopes to reach $250 million by the fall.</p>
<p>Organizers in the past also routinely kept 20% of their
partnerships' profits; now investors are demanding that they
first receive a return of about 10% on their investments
before divvying up the rest with the organizer. And that
once-sacred 20% share for the organizer is under pressure,
shrinking to 15% in some cases.</p>
<p>Still another wrinkle is that partnership organizers are
giving investors more leeway to later opt out of deals they
might object to on various grounds.</p>
