	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Investors rushed to buy RJR Nabisco Inc.'s
newly glamorous junk bonds, propelling prices sharply higher,
in reaction to the company's huge refinancing program.
   The tobacco and food company touched off the buying spree
by announcing details of a $6.9 billion refinancing designed
to strengthen its balance sheet and ward off a potential
financial crisis. The plan includes retiring many of the
company's most troublesome junk bonds by buying them back in
the open market and by an exchange offer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>RJR Nabisco's announcement helped lift prices of other
high-yield, high-risk junk bonds yesterday. Elsewhere in the
U.S. bond markets, though, most interest rates were little
changed, taking a breather after having fallen late last week
as the Federal Reserve eased credit slightly.</p>
<p>Long-term Treasury bond yields hovered in a narrow band
all day yesterday, finishing the session almost exactly where
they began. For example, 30-year Treasury bonds now yield
8.45%, the same as late Friday. Treasury bill rates also were
flat, and municipal bond prices ended little changed.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve officials probably won't cut interest
rates any further until a clearer picture of the economy
emerges in August, investment managers and economists say.
Several money managers fear that the Fed acted too soon, that
inflation will remain stubbornly high, and thus that
short-term bonds represent a much better buy right now than
long-term bonds.</p>
<p>Moreover, traders are bracing for a huge wave of U.S.
government borrowing next month that some analysts predict
will nudge interest rates back up over the next few weeks.
The Treasury's quarterly financing, which typically consists
of three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds, is
expected in early August. "There's also a great deal of
concern about the budget deficit and concern that politics is
ruling the day" once again, said William Brachfeld, executive
vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc.</p>
<p>While U.S. bonds stalled yesterday, British government
bond prices surged in brisk trading. Traders cited the
British pound's recent strength in the foreign-exchange
markets as well as unexpectedly weak U.K. economic reports
that could indicate reduced inflationary pressures. West
German government bond prices also climbed.</p>
<p>To keep the U.S. bond market rally going, "new evidence of
a slower economy probably will have to emerge," said John
Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.
"However, we do not foresee a deep enough decline in economic
activity that would open the way for a significant bond
rally."</p>
<p>Thomas G. Moles, managing director in charge of fixed
income investments at J&W Seligman Inc., agrees that the Fed
probably won't cut rates again in the near future. "What the
Fed's going to do is sit back and see what the market
reaction is" to last week's credit-easing move before taking
further action, he said.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Moles recommends buying longer-term bonds,
especially top-rated issues. "We're increasingly leaning
toward higher-quality issues," he said. "Reaching for yield"
by buying lower-rated issues wouldn't be smart, he said, in
view of the economy's listlessness.</p>
<p>Junk, Corporate Bonds</p>
<p>Investors reacted enthusiastically to RJR Nabisco Inc.'s
refinancing plan.</p>
<p>RJR's 14.07% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, due in
2009, which were reset to yield 17.375% under the new plan,
soared 8 1/4 points to 114 3/8 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Pay-in-kind debentures pay interest in the form of
addition securities.</p>
<p>The other widely held RJR issue, the 14.07% exchangeable
pay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, which have been
reset to yield 17%, jumped 4 5/8 points to 91 3/4.</p>
<p>Investors who bought RJR Nabisco's bonds early this year
and held them have made a fortune. Prices of some issues have
nearly doubled over the last six months amid speculation that
the company's controlling owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co., would take steps to lighten RJR's enormous debt burden.
KKR took the company private in a $25 billion leveraged
takeover, the largest in history.</p>
<p>Prices of other corporate junk bonds rose about one point,
traders said. Also, while volume in RJR Pay-in-kind bonds was
triple the recent daily average, activity in other bonds was
about double.</p>
<p>Among high-grade corporate bonds, prices were little
changed. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. tapped the
markets with new debt issues.</p>
<p>Treasury Securities
</p>
<p>Treasury bond yields hardly budged all day. Trading
activity was sluggish.</p>
<p>Among actively traded issues, the government's 30-year
bonds were quoted late yesterday at a price of about 103 1/4,
to yield 8.45%, the same as late Friday.</p>
<p>"The bond market had its big excitement on Thursday and
Friday" of last week, said Joseph Liro, a vice president at
S.G. Warburg & Co. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan disclosed
Thursday that the Fed was poised to ease credit. Then on
Friday, the central bank acted, trimming rates slightly. The
Fed's move resulted in a drop in the interest rate on federal
funds, or funds that banks lend each overnight, by 0.25
percentage point to 8%.</p>
<p>But banks haven't yet responded by lowering their prime
lending rate, which remains stuck at 10%. The prime rate is
closely watched because banks use it as a peg to set rates on
a large number of loans to individuals as well as small and
medium-sized companies.</p>
<p>The Treasury yesterday held its regular weekly sale of new
three-month and six-month bills. Here are details:</p>
<p>Rates are determined by the difference between the
purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows
the investor's return while lower bidding widens it. The
percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while the
coupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.</p>

<p>Both issues are dated July 19. The 13-week bills mature
Oct. 18, 1990, and the 26-week bills mature Jan. 17, 1991.</p>
<p>Foreign Bonds</p>
<p>British government bond prices surged again yesterday.</p>
<p>U.K. government bonds are attracting more investors
because of growing signs that Britain's weak economy will
help depress inflation, pull down interest rates and drive up
bond prices.</p>
<p>Investors also are attracted by Britain's high interest
rates and its "inverted yield curve," which means short-term
rates there are higher than long-term bond yields.</p>
<p>Britain's 11.75% bonds due 2003/2007, which traders watch
as an indicator of long-term bonds in general, climbed
yesterday by 22/32 of a point yesterday to 102 31/32, to
yield 11.30%.</p>
<p>Among other active issues, the 12% bonds due 1995 rose
14/32 of a point to yield 12.01%. Traders cited retail sales
and industrial production figures as evidence of U.K. economy
weakness.</p>
<p>In other major markets:</p>
<p>-- West German government bond prices also rose. Bonn's
8.75% benchmark bonds, due 2000, rose 0.45 point to 101.75 to
yield 8.47%.</p>
<p>-- Japanese government bond prices inched higher. Trading
was relatively light.</p>
<p>Mortgage-backed Securities</p>
<p>The mortgage securities market ended unchanged to
marginally higher after a lifeless session in both the
primary and secondary markets.</p>
<p>No major new offerings were priced yesterday.</p>
<p>Although price movement has been negligible, the secondary
market continues to benefit from the dearth of new issuance,
which has been combined with solid demand from dealers and
retail accounts in recent days.</p>
<p>Among actively traded secondary issues, Government
National Mortgage Association 9.5% issues were up 2/32 at 99
23/ 32, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9.5% securities were
2/32 higher at 99 2/32 and Federal National Mortgage
Association 9.5% issues were up 2/32 at 99 18/ 32.</p>
<p>Municipal Bonds</p>
<p>Municipal bonds ended narrowly mixed, with a large number
of issues unchanged to as much as 1/4 point higher.</p>
<p>Municipal players are already turning their attention to
the week's new-issue calendar, where more than $1.5 billion
is expected to be priced.</p>
<p>In two of the week's largest issues New York will sell
$225 million various purpose general obligation bonds today.</p>
<p>Also Tuesday, a Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group is
expected to price $325 million Connecticut general obligation
bonds.</p>
<p>Among actively traded bonds, the New Jersey Turnpike
Authority's 7.20% bonds of 2018 were unchanged at 99 1/2 to
yield 7.30%.</p>
