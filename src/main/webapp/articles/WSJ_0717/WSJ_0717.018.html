	<p class="article-leader">NCR Corp. surprised investors with solid profit and
revenue gains for the second quarter, pushing the big
computer maker's shares higher in active trading.
   Dayton, Ohio-based NCR reported net income of $115
million, or $1.66 a share, up 4.5% from $110 million, or
$1.42 a share, in the 1989 second quarter, when the company
had a larger base of shares outstanding.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenue climbed 5% to $1.61 billion from $1.53 billion.</p>
<p>NCR said strong foreign sales offset continuing weakness
in the U.S. market. Despite the slow domestic sales, the
company said it still expects to achieve profit and revenue
gains for the year.</p>
<p>"The quarter looked good almost across the board: Sales
were up, gross margins were up, and discretionary spending
was down," Don Young, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein &
Co., said. The one negative factor was continuing weakness in
domestic orders, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Young also said he expects NCR to report strong
earnings for the current quarter, but he called the fourth
quarter "a question mark," as the company is to begin a risky
product-line transition in the fall.</p>
<p>Investors welcomed the company's earnings report, bidding
NCR shares up $3.875 each to close at $68 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, with 407,100 shares changing
hands. Average daily turnover in the stock is about 250,000
shares.</p>
<p>Favorable currency-exchange rates in the second quarter
also boosted NCR's results, analysts said, an effect that
should extend into the third quarter. And analysts lauded the
company's tight rein on expenses. "NCR has some of the best
cost controls in the industry, and that was a significant
factor in the second quarter," Jay P. Stevens of Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. said. "They manage factory inventories closely,
and they don't have excess people."</p>
<p>NCR's chairman and chief executive officer, Charles E.
Exley, said orders abroad set a record in the second quarter,
showing a "substantial gain" from year-earlier activity. The
improvements offset a decline in U.S. orders, he said.</p>
<p>Bank automation systems and check-processing equipment
were particularly strong, while the NCR Tower series of
computers posted a third consecutive record quarter in sales,
the company said.</p>
<p>Mr. Exley said second-half results will be helped if
foreign-exchange rates continue at current levels. "Despite
the softness of U.S. incoming orders in the second quarter,
we still see the opportunity to achieve single-digit growth
in revenue and net income for the full year," he said.</p>
<p>During the second quarter, NCR purchased 2.2 million of
its shares under a previously announced buy-back program. NCR
said the buy-backs continued to boost per-share earnings
while hurting net income. The company had an average of 69.3
million shares outstanding in the latest quarter, down from
an average of 77.7 million a year earlier. Higher research
spending also cut into earnings, the company said.</p>
<p>First-half net dropped 2.3% to $167 million, or $2.38 a
share, from $171 million, or $2.17 a share. The increase in
earnings per share reflected the stock buy-backs. Revenue
grew 3.3% to $2.87 billion from $2.78 billion.</p>
