	<p class="article-leader">HOLLYWOOD -- Live Entertainment Inc. set Oct. 4 as the
date for its video release of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:
The Movie." It will be supported by a $20 million marketing
campaign as well as a cross-promotion with PepsiCo Inc.'s
Pizza Hut restaurants.
   The motion picture has grossed more than $130 million at
the box office so far, and a series of animated TV versions
released earlier in video by Live have sold more than 13
million units.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Purchasers of the "Ninja Turtles" cassette will receive
coupons redeemable for more than $20 in free food and Pepsi
from Pizza Hut's 6,500 restaurants. Pizza Hut will co-sponsor
the television, print and radio advertising campaign.</p>
<p>Despite the $24.99 suggested price, Live will provide
cooperative advertising to retailers who price the tapes as
low as $18.88. But some mass merchants are likely to price
the videocassettes -- which sell for about $16 wholesale --
even lower.</p>
<p>Separately, Live, whose voting stock is 48%-owned by
Carolco Pictures Inc., also said it will change the name of
its home video unit from International Video Entertainment
Inc., or IVE, to Live Home Video Inc.</p>
