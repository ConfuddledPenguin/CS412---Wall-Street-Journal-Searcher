	<p class="article-leader">VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Prices for lead and zinc
dropped sharply as bargainers for Cominco Ltd. and the United
Steelworkers of America appeared close to a settlement that
could end a strike that began July 9.
   "We're almost in a position to recommend to the
membership" a new two-year contract, said Ron Schmidt, the
union's chief negotiator. He said the union has already won
acceptable increases to wages and pensions, following a
21-hour weekend bargaining session.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"There are just a couple of things to resolve," he said,
including a plan to reopen the currently dormant Sullivan
lead-zinc mine, at Kimberley, British Columbia. The proposed
two-year pact, which the union's bargaining committee hopes
to present to striking workers today, would replace one that
expired June 30, a week before the walkout began.</p>
<p>The accord would cover about 700 currently inactive
workers at Sullivan, and an additional 2,900 striking workers
at Cominco's big lead-zinc smelter complex, at Trail, British
Columbia. The shutdown at Trail, which at full capacity
produces about 5.8% of the Western world's refined zinc and
about 2.6% of its refined lead, has helped drive up lead and
zinc prices in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Reports of an impending settlement sent lead and zinc
prices plummeting yesterday on the London Metal Exchange.
Spot prices for lead and zinc closed at about 38 cents (U.S.)
and 70 cents (U.S.) a pound, respectively, down from 41 cents
and 75 cents at Friday's close.</p>
<p>Mr. Schmidt wouldn't elaborate on the terms of the wage
and pension proposals from Cominco. But a union official said
it calls for a wage increase of about 18% over the two-year
life of the accord. The average hourly wage at Trail under
the previous pact was 16.82 Canadian dollars (US$14.54).</p>
