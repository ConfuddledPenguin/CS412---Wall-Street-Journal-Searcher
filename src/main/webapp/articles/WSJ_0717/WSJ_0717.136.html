	<p class="article-leader">Tomkins PLC of Britain said pretax profit for the year
ended April 28 rose 18% to #77 million ($138.8 million) from
#65.1 million a year earlier, helped by the industrial
management concern's low exposure to the depressed British
economy.
   The results were at the top end of market expectations,
which were for a rise of between #75 million and #77.5
million, and were in line with the company's forecast of "no
less than" #76 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Profit attributable to shareholders, after taxes, rose 22%
to #53.6 million from #43.9 million. Per-share earnings rose
15% to 28.2 pence from 24.5 pence.</p>
<p>Sales rose 30% to #720 million from #550 million.</p>
<p>Tomkins said it is proposing to pay a final dividend of
6.55 pence a share, which, together with its interim payment
of 2.70 pence, would make the full-year payout 9.25 pence, up
37% from 6.75 pence last year.</p>
