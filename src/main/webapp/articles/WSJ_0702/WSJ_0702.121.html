	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Unlike the previous two summers, natural-gas
prices haven't climbed this year and could stay at low levels
through the entire season, industry officials and analysts
say.
   "Terrible, terrible," is how Paul Taylor, a vice president
of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., a large gas producer, describes
the market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"This year the price has been flat as a pancake,"
complains Don Salanty, Amoco Corp.'s vice president of
negotiations and sales for natural gas.</p>
<p>After spot prices climbed as high as $2.25 a thousand
cubic feet in January, the weather turned warm quickly and
gas prices fell like a rock. They've been hovering around
$1.40 since March and without some extreme drought conditions
this summer few expect much of a change.</p>
<p>"Right now we're looking at gas prices down two cents to
four cents in July," says John Olson, an analyst at First
Boston Corp. "The prospects are the same through the summer,"
he adds.</p>
<p>In the previous two summers, hot weather sparked increased
use of natural gas by electric utilities, causing prices to
climb. But the situation is different this year.</p>
<p>For one, there's an oversupply now. The amount of gas in
storage is 5.7% greater than this time last year, according
to First Boston. "Last winter's warm weather is the primary
cause," says a spokesman for Enron Corp., the nation's
largest natural-gas pipeline company.</p>
<p>Normally, gas producers, pipelines and customers put gas
in storage ahead of winter because a cold snap can stretch
the system's ability to deliver gas during this period of
peak demand. But with the winter heating season about 21%
warmer than normal, demand was weak. "The excess supply has
been with us since," says Mr. Salanty of Amoco.</p>
<p>"This industry keeps getting surprised by weather
patterns," says Mr. Taylor of Anadarko. "Demand can swing
100% from summer to winter." So far this year, industrywide
demand is off about 5%.</p>
<p>A more than $8-a-barrel plunge in crude oil prices this
year has also depressed gas prices because certain gas
customers can switch fairly easily between gas and certain
crude products.</p>
<p>"We're beginning to see fuel-switching in the Northeast
because of cratering fuel prices," says Mr. Olson of First
Boston, with some customers opting to burn residual fuel oil
instead of gas. "We haven't faced resid competition in
years," Mr. Taylor says.</p>
<p>Natural-gas prices for some customers in the New York
area, for instance, could total as much as $2.40 a thousand
cubic feet after transportation charges are added, Mr. Olson
says. Residual fuel can be bought at New York Harbor for
around $2.08 for the energy equivalent, he adds. Similar
price competitiveness exists on the Gulf Coast too, gas
producers say.</p>
<p>"We're getting some gas turned back to us" because of fuel
switching, Mr. Salanty says.</p>
<p>Some companies reduce their gas output in the face of low
prices but not enough are now doing this industrywide to put
supply and demand more in balance. "We started curtailing
production in February," says Mr. Taylor. Andarko, one of the
more extreme examples, had peak production of 540 million
cubic feet of gas a day in February and sold an average of
360 million cubic feet daily in June.</p>
<p>While most natural gas is currently bought and sold in
30-day contracts, for the first time, a natural-gas futures
contract began trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
April and it seems too early to tell if it will catch on.
"It's not a major player yet," says Mr. Salanty, though Amoco
is watching it closely. Mr. Salanty says that the New York
Merc's crude oil contract is so successful because oil
producers and consumers actively trade. Those players are
mostly absent from the gas contract right now, he says.</p>
<p>But the New York Merc said that just 58 days into trading
of the gas contract, open interest exceeded the level reached
by the crude oil contract in the same time period after its
launch in 1983. Since its birth, the crude contract has
reshaped world oil markets.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week:</p>
<p>Meats and Livestock</p>
<p>Futures traders will react today to a Friday report by the
government that hog farmers intend to begin rebuilding their
herds this fall.</p>
<p>A tight supply of hogs helped push prices to record levels
this spring, and that in turn is causing record retail prices
for pork in the supermarket.</p>
<p>After the close of trading Friday, the Agriculture
Department reported that a survey of hog farmers indicates
they are planning for the birth of 2% more piglets in
September, October and November than in the like 1989 period.</p>
<p>If that materializes, the tight supply of fattened hogs in
the U.S. should begin to ease by early next year.</p>
<p>The forecast was included in a quarterly survey of hog
farmers by the Agriculture Department.</p>
<p>So far, at least, the nation's hog herd is continuing to
slip. According to the department, the number of hogs in the
U.S. on June 1 was down 3% from that date in 1989.</p>
<p>The department's report was generally in line with
expectations by livestock analysts, according to Jerry
Abbenhaus, a livestock analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons, St.
Louis.</p>
<p>Precious Metals</p>
<p>Silver and gold futures finished last week on a strong
note, though analysts say there were no new fundamental
factors driving the market. William O'Neill, futures analyst
for Merrill Lynch Futures in New York, said that though New
York dealers reported some bullion purchases, the rally
looked mostly technical to him.</p>
<p>"Once the August contract for gold punched through the
$356-an-ounce level, the rally fed on itself," Mr. O'Neill
said. He said traders this week should keep their chart books
at hand because he believes the rally, if sustained, will
continue to be driven by technical forces. If current prices
hold, he suggested, commodity funds will be attracted to buy
contracts. "The market is pretty thin, so such buying could
move the market substantially," he said.</p>
<p>Michael Frawley, a metals trader at PaineWebber in New
York, said the next upward resistance level for gold is $370
an ounce for the August contract. He said the contract will
find support between $350 and $352. It closed Friday at
$359.90 an ounce, up $5.80.</p>
<p>The most important change in the gold market over recent
weeks, Mr. O'Neill said, is the drop in producer selling.
"That is more important than what happens to the dollar, to
interest rates or to oil prices," he said. "That is the key
for the coming week and for the summer."</p>
<p>Silver, said Mr. O'Neill, is trailing gold because it
hasn't attracted any physical demand. September silver would
have to top the $5.15 to $5.20 area to demonstrate it has
technical strength, according to Mr. Frawley. The contract
closed Friday at $4.963 an ounce, up 7.1 cents.</p>
