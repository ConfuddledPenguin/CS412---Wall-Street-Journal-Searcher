	<p class="article-leader">Lithuania gave Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev a gift by
temporarily freezing its act of independence in time for the
start of the Soviet Communist Party congress today. Mr.
Gorbachev is returning the favor by turning the gas pumps
back on.
   The breakthrough opens the door to negotiations that
Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene predicted
could lead to independence in two or three years. Lithuanian
radicals fear a Soviet trick, but the Parliament accepted
Mrs. Prunskiene's logic that "you can only have talks with an
independent country, so the very fact of having talks shows
we're already a little independent."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Lithuania's moratorium will last for 100 days from the
start of talks and can be extended or terminated at
Lithuania's will. If the negotiations break off or if the
Lithuanian Parliament is kept from its business, the
moratorium will automatically cease. The leaders of
Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, the three Baltic republics,
agreed Saturday to seek joint talks with Moscow on
independence, Reuters reported.</p>
<p>The timing of Lithuania's announcement gave Mr. Gorbachev
a badly needed victory. But the decision stemmed more from
diplomacy than desperation; the Kremlin's two-month-long
blockade was singularly unsuccessful at disrupting daily life
or undermining spirit in Lithuania.</p>
<p>As the Parliament debated the dangers of compromise,
Vilnius felt more like a summer resort than a city under
siege. The blockade had forced some 50,000 people out of
work, but most took long paid summer holidays, and the
reality of unemployment hadn't hit home. Gas shipments had
long since stopped, but the roads were full of cars fueled by
gasoline brought in privately from Poland and Byelorussia and
sold on the black market. Shops were full and there were few
lines.</p>
<p>The blockade of gas and vital raw materials was Moscow's
key instrument in trying to force Lithuania to renounce its
drive for independence. It did take a toll: Hundreds of
factories curtailed operations and 10 plants, including a
major oil refinery, were shut down. People lived under strict
rationing for months.</p>
<p>But the blockade also strengthened the confidence of many
Lithuanian's in their ability to make it without Moscow.
"First we thought we couldn't stand the blockade more than a
month, but now after two months we realize we can survive
these conditions," said Povilas Gylys, an economics professor
and official of the independent Lithuanian Communist Party.</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Gorbachev seems to have understood the
blockade strategy wasn't working as planned. After returning
from his visit to the U.S. in May, he backed down from his
refusal to negotiate unless the republic revoked its March 11
declaration, and proposed a freeze instead.</p>
<p>"Both sides can interpret a moratorium as their own
victory," Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis told the
Parliament last week. "They can say it's not independence,
and we can say it's the first step toward independence."</p>
