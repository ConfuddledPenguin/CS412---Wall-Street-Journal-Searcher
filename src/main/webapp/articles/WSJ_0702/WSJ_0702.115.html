	<p class="article-leader">Research percolating in molecular biology laboratories
could give scientists tools to shut down the cellular
machinery underlying arthritis, asthma, multiple sclerosis
and other diseases caused by a hyperactive immune system.
   And while biologists caution that it's a long, uncertain
path from the lab to marketable drugs, an unusually
high-powered group of investors is betting that a small
Seattle company can deliver on this latest biotech promise.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Recent experiments suggest how certain white blood cells
that circulate in the bloodstream pass through blood vessel
walls and into joints and other body sites. In normal,
regulated amounts, these white blood cells trigger the body's
defense against infection from bacteria or viruses. But
unchecked, these cells can accumulate dangerously, producing
the swelling, pain and tissue damage characteristic of
diseases in which the body's defensive mechanism, for reasons
unknown, turns upon itself.</p>
<p>A team of scientists in Seattle believes it can create
drugs that would jam the pathways through which
inflammation-causing cells travel from the bloodstream to
specific sites near bone joints, in the lungs and in the
brain. The scientists caution that the research is in its
infancy and that such drugs could be years away.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, several Seattle entrepreneurs have hooked up
with these scientists, forming a new company to turn the
nascent science into medical treatments. The start-up, called
Icos Corp., brashly predicts that medicines from the new
research will provide significant advances over current
therapy, and, in the case of multiple sclerosis, provide
treatment where none now exists.</p>
<p>Some biotech industry experts are skeptical about the
company's business prospects, and its ability to pay back
initial investors. But scientists familiar with the research
at the company's core say Icos's strategy is certain to
intensify the increasingly competitive world-wide hunt for
better anti-inflammatory drugs, for which there's huge
potential: About 37 million Americans, plagued by some form
of arthritis, spend an estimated $3 billion to $5 billion a
year on all sorts of medication. While the Icos approach to
treatment -- preventing the inflammation -- is perhaps the
least developed of any being pursued by researchers, some
believe it is the most promising.</p>
<p>"If we're successful, the drugs we develop would be the
first to actually halt the production of unwanted
inflammation," says Robert Nowinski, Icos's 44-year-old
president and chief executive officer. "Current medicines for
arthritis and asthma simply relieve symptoms associated with
inflammation, but we hope to stop the inflammation before it
ever gets started."</p>
<p>Mr. Nowinski, a biologist of some note, is nothing if not
confident. He made a bundle in 1985 selling to Bristol-Myers
the biotech venture he started in 1981, Genetic Systems. Last
September, Mr. Nowinski walked out of a top research
management post at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., chafing at the
big New York company's bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Heading back home to Seattle with only the vaguest of
notions about starting another biotech company, Mr. Nowinski
jumped at an offer from Isaac and David Blech, two Seattle
venture capitalists who had backed his first enterprise.
Christopher Henney, who until last year was a research
director at Immunex Corp., another Seattle biotech firm, was
the first person Mr. Nowinski contacted. "We each had a
shopping list of research areas, but the anti-inflammation
work ranked highest for both of us," recalls Mr. Henney, who
is now Icos director of research.</p>
<p>Within six months, Mr. Nowinski enlisted two top biotech
industry executives to help manage the company, and an entire
team of scientists from a world-famous research institute.</p>
<p>With the help of PaineWebber Inc., he talked 400 investors
into putting up a total of $33 million, the largest private
funding ever for a new, unproven biotech firm. Big names in
business signed on: Walter Wriston, former head of Citicorp,
and Frank Carey, a former chairman of IBM, were both
persuaded to join Icos's board. William Gates, chairman of
the Seattle-based software giant Microsoft Corp., was urged
to invest, becoming the company's single-biggest shareholder
with a 10% stake.</p>
<p>By building a high-tech company with a lot of hurry and
hoopla, Mr. Nowinski is risking criticism as hyping
discoveries prematurely. In fact, in a 1989 book called "Gene
Dreams," author Robert Teitelman skewers Mr. Nowinski's
involvement in Genetic Systems as overselling the promise of
biotechnology.</p>
<p>But since the forming of Icos, Mr. Nowinski has stumbled
across several research advances that, he is convinced, will
help Icos beat Merck & Co. and other pharmaceutical giants
racing to find new anti-inflammatory drugs. The new research,
described in just a handful of recent scientific articles, is
designed to selectively block the action of proteins and
enzymes, which, like traffic cops, route the body's white
blood cells to their destination.</p>
<p>Mr. Henney knew of "cutting edge" research taking place at
the nearby Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. A small
team of scientists there are among the first anywhere to
identify molecules, called "adhesion" proteins, embedded
within the inside lining -- the endothelium -- of tiny blood
capillaries. When a wound occurs, such as a splinter in the
skin, these adhesion proteins extend into the bloodstream
like fishing hooks, latching onto specific white blood cells
floating by.</p>
<p>The blood cells and the hooks are linked by protrusions on
their surfaces that fit snugly into one another. Once bound
together, the adhesion proteins draw the blood cells through
the capillary wall and into the tissue site, where they mount
an inflammatory attack of other immune system agents to
counter infection.</p>
<p>"The power of the technology is that these adhesion
proteins differ from site to site in the body," says Thomas
St. John, who along with Michael Gallatin and their
colleagues are rushing to identify the structure of each of
the protein's "hooking" sites. Icos believes the white blood
cells' path into the tissue site could be barricaded with
drugs that home in on the hooking sites only of those cells
involved in unwanted inflammation.</p>
<p>By January, Messrs. Nowinski and Henney had hired away the
Fred Hutchinson center scientists. The two men also persuaded
George Rathmann, chairman and founder of Amgen Corp., a
California biotech concern, to sign on as chairman of the
Icos board.</p>
<p>About then, Mr. Nowinski was approached by officials at
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island offering the
rights to a new technology they felt could quicken the
company's efforts to find drugs blocking the cells' homing
sites. Moreover, the Cold Spring Harbor researchers had
identified enzymes within immune system cells that direct
them to carry out an anti-inflammatory response.</p>
<p>Mr. Nowinski hopes the company -- with the combination of
the Hutchinson and Cold Spring research -- may have an
inflammation-blocking drug for testing in animals within two
years. But drug industry observers say Icos will also need a
hefty dose of luck.</p>
<p>"I can't criticize the technology," says Jeffrey Jay, who
runs Canaan Partners, a biomedical venture capital group.
"But it's going to take a lot more money and a lot of time
for them to succeed." Moreover, he says, the need to raise
capital will "greatly" dilute current shareholders' value.
"It's not an investment I'd recommend right now," he says.</p>
