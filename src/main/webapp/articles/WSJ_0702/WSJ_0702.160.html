	<p class="article-leader">At last A. Robert Abboud can truly call himself a Texas
banker.
   After two years of broadcasting nothing but good news from
First City Bancorp. of Texas, the Houston bank holding
company he helped rescue in 1988, the former Chicagoan
suddenly finds himself grappling with troubles all too
familiar to natives of the Lone Star state. Rising problem
loans. Falling profits. And, above all, skepticism on Wall
Street.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Their near-term picture is spotty and deserves a lot of
scrutiny," says James J. McDermott Jr., a banking analyst
with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc., who calls recent trends
"alarming."</p>
<p>Mr. Abboud didn't do much to calm such worries when he
disclosed that he expects First City's second-quarter profit
to fall to 75 cents to 95 cents a share from $1.08 a year
earlier -- the first such decline since he took the helm in
April 1988. Worse, he said that nonperforming assets,
including several questionable credits to such debt-laden
outfits as Circle K Corp., were likely to jump to $200
million, 43% above the year-end total. The news drove First
City stock down two points in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading Friday. The stock closed at $26.25 a share,
a new 52-week low.</p>
<p>Of course, bad news isn't exactly a rare commodity in the
banking world these days. Across the country, credit quality
fears and dwindling interest margins are depressing bank
stocks and forcing painful personnel changes.</p>
<p>But until lately, Mr. Abboud and First City had seemed
almost bullet-proof. For starters, the deal the banker
structured to take over First City two years ago cleansed the
books of most problems, including sour real estate loans and
Third World credits, and brought in nearly $1.5 billion in
federal aid and private equity. That enabled him to start
lending again while most of his Texas competitors were still
mired in workouts.</p>
<p>What's more, the feisty 61-year-old brought with him a
carefully cultivated image as a tight-fisted lender. In the
late 1970s, as chairman and chief executive of First Chicago
Corp., Mr. Abboud braved fierce criticism from the local
business community by slamming the brakes on loan growth.
Although many now credit him with preventing the bank from
following crosstown rival Continental Illinois Corp. into
collapse, at the time his actions helped get him fired. "It
was a little like trying to persuade hedonists to forgo
earthly pleasures and wait for their reward in the
hereafter," Mr. Abboud wrote in his autobiography, "Money in
the Bank."</p>
<p>But now some in the industry are wondering if Mr. Abboud
hasn't succumbed to the siren call of quick profits. Last
year, First City's loans rose 15% to $8.22 billion, a
blistering pace considering the spotty nature of Texas's
economic recovery, and much faster than deposit growth.</p>
<p>By contrast, total lending by all Texas banks shrank
during the period. "Finding quality loans is quite
difficult," says Ronald G. Steinhart, chairman of Fort Worth,
Texas-based Team Bank, which was also resurrected with
federal aid. "We don't see {First City} doing crazy things,
but we see them being the most aggressive" lenders.</p>
<p>Some of First City's early credit decisions are coming
back to haunt it. Since the beginning of the year, four major
out-of-state borrowers that owe the bank a collective $72.5
million have trooped into federal bankruptcy court: Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.; Circle K, the convenience store chain;
Federated Department Stores Inc.; and Garfinckel's Inc., a
department-store chain owned by Mr. Abboud's longtime friend
Wafic Said.</p>
<p>"It seems to be the same story we so frequently see in
banking," says Sandra Flannigan, an analyst with Alex. Brown
& Sons, Baltimore. "Any time a bank grows its loan portfolio
at a pace far greater than the expansion of loan demand
within the region, it's often followed by problems and losses
in the portfolio."</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, that isn't the way Mr. Abboud sees it.
"I certainly hope I haven't lost my reputation as a
conservative lender, because I consider myself one," he says.
He acknowledges that First City has moved to tighten credit
policies this year, particularly in the wholesale lending
department, which participates in large national credits such
as leveraged buy-outs. The bank is also trying to direct more
loans to the Texas market, which Mr. Abboud believes is
poised to take off.</p>
<p>But he denies that First City has made a habit of
extending risky loans. If the bank has cut some deals others
weren't comfortable with, that might be because the credits
involved particularly complex financial arrangements, he
says, not because they were unwise.</p>
<p>The Garfinckel's loan, he says, is a case in point.
Although the company has filed for bankruptcy-court
protection from creditors, First City hasn't even felt
obliged to place the credit on nonperforming status. Of the
initial $21 million Garfinckel's owed, First City has already
received a $7.5 million cash paydown. A revolving credit
facility of $3.8 million is secured by customer receivables
of nearly twice that amount, and the remainder of the loan is
secured both by the store's assets and by a contract that
would allow the bank to "put" the credit to a third party,
Mr. Abboud says.</p>
<p>First City also says it is confident it will win full
repayment on the Drexel, Circle K and Federated facilities.
"I'm comfortable that {nonperformers} are flattened out," Mr.
Abboud says. He also points out that nonperformers remain a
relatively low 1.4% of total assets and that the bank's
capital position is quite strong.</p>
<p>And if there are a few more rough spots along the way, Mr.
Abboud doesn't seem worried. Indeed, with the sort of
contrarianism that has long confounded friends and foes
alike, Mr. Abboud vows to continue pushing First City into
areas other banks have shied from, such as international
trade finance.</p>
<p>He even says he might try to capitalize on First City's
recent troubles by marketing its expertise in managing
difficult loans to other banks. "We know how to work out of
problems," he says. "I think that's a very valuable resource
at this particular time."</p>
