	<p class="article-leader">Eliot Savings Bank, Boston, was closed by banking
regulators and its deposits were assumed by the South Boston
Savings Bank unit of Boston Bancorp.
   South Boston Savings acquired approximately $400 million
in deposits of Eliot Savings from the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. at a purchase premium of $250,000. None of
Eliot Savings' assets, except cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities, were acquired by South Boston. Eliot
Savings' three offices were to open for business today as
branches of South Boston Savings.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Eliot Savings, with assets of $450 million, was closed by
the Massachusetts commissioner of banks and the FDIC as
liquidating agent. Boston Bancorp had assets of $1.42 billion
as of April 30.</p>
<p>Eliot Savings, which had a $50.5 million loss last year,
was hurt by the slump in the real estate market, as were many
financial institutions in New England. Analysts have said
they expect more bank failures in the region in months to
come.</p>
