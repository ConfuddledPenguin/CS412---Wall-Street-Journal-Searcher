	<p class="article-leader">GREENVILLE, S.C. -- Multimedia Inc. said it is redeeming
its subordinated redeemable discount debentures, due 2005, at
their $480 million face value, as part of a $1.1 billion
refinancing package.
   The newspaper, broadcasting and cable-television concern,
which issued the discount debentures as part of a
recapitalization in 1985, said its latest refinancing package
is composed of a $700 million bank facility and a $400
million private placement of unsecured senior notes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition to redeeming the debt, Multimedia said it will
use the proceeds from the refinancing to service its bank
debt and to create a pool of about $375 million for
acquisitions.</p>
<p>Multimedia said its new credit agreements allow it to buy
back stock within certain limitations; it may do so based on
market conditions. The refinancing facilities provide an
overall interest rate of about 11%, the company said.</p>
