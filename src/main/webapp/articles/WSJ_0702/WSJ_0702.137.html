	<p class="article-leader">N.V. Philips is preparing to announce the elimination of
at least several hundred more jobs in its computer division,
sources close to the company said.
   The Dutch electronics company, which in June announced
plans to cut 210 computer-related jobs in the Netherlands,
plans further reductions at plants in France, Sweden and
Canada, the sources said.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In addition, Jan Timmer, Philips's new chairman, is likely
to sketch plans for broader cost-saving measures when he
assumes his new post this week.</p>
<p>In the computer division, which has had losses estimated
at more than 100 million guilders ($53 million) a quarter in
the past year, Philips apparently aims to improve performance
enough to attract potential partners or buyers for parts of
the business.</p>
<p>An extraordinary meeting today is expected to draw about
1,000 shareholders, a Philips spokesman said.</p>
