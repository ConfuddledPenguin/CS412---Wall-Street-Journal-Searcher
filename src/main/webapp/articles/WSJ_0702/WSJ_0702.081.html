	<p class="article-leader">MOSCOW -- The Politburo of the Soviet Communist Party used
to meet regularly on Thursdays to decide such diverse matters
as the invasion of Afghanistan and investment for the
nation's machinery industry. These days, when the Politburo
meets at all, it concentrates on party affairs.
   Staff at the party's Central Committee headquarters, long
accustomed to giving instructions that were immediately
obeyed, are far fewer in number and wield far less clout than
before. "The situation has changed radically from two, three
or five years ago," says one official. "People once viewed us
as gods. Now they listen to us only if we have something new
and interesting to propose."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Such are the fruits of Mikhail Gorbachev's two-year
struggle to bring democracy to the Soviet Union. Slowly but
surely, the Soviet leader has moved to transfer political
power from the discredited Communist Party to a more
legitimate system of elected government. All the while, the
party has watched and -- at least publicly -- applauded.</p>
<p>No longer. When the 28th Communist Party Congress opens
today in Moscow, Mr. Gorbachev is likely to face a hostile
audience. At that meeting, the highest body of party power
must decide whether to back his efforts to relegate the party
to a back seat, turning it into an organization that advises
on policy but neither dictates nor implements it.</p>
<p>But in the weeks leading up to the meeting, particularly
at a conference of Russian Communists last month, hard-liners
have mounted a rear-guard action to preserve party power. For
the first time, they have openly criticized Mr. Gorbachev's
entire perestroika program, accusing him of selling out the
military, losing Eastern Europe to the capitalists and
driving the Soviet economy to the brink of collapse. Yegor
Ligachev, a conservative figurehead in the Politburo, has
even called for Mr. Gorbachev to resign as party leader.</p>
<p>Such bitter attacks have sent a shiver through the nation,
forcing some of Mr. Gorbachev's aides to give soothing
reassurances. "The Congress won't settle the fate of
perestroika -- it will go on -- but the fate of the party
itself," Alexander Yakovlev, a Politburo member and Gorbachev
confidant told Pravda last week.</p>
<p>But as Mr. Gorbachev himself concedes, the party is still
a powerful force to be reckoned with. He has created the
beginnings of a democratic system, including a feisty
parliament and a new-style presidency, but the party
apparatus continues to hold many of the levers of power. Mr.
Gorbachev conceded as much when he decided not to give up his
post as party leader to concentrate on the presidency.</p>
<p>The Congress seems sure to be a feast of conservatism;
only an estimated 2% of delegates are radicals committed to
faster reforms. So far, the best guess is that Mr. Gorbachev
will cling to the middle ground, aligning himself with
moderate conservatives even if it means compromising on some
of his political reforms. But, frets Boris Bolotin, a
researcher at a Moscow think-tank, "Gorbachev's
maneuverability is at an end."</p>
<p>The problem with trying to strike compromises with the
hard-liners is that it risks setting off defections by
liberals who are demanding a major overhaul of the party
itself. It could also seriously affect political stability,
leaving the Soviet Union with a messy system of government in
which the Communist Party and new democratic bodies struggle
for control.</p>
<p>Signs of that struggle already abound. In Moscow,
Leningrad and elsewhere, newly elected city councils are
fighting party cadres for control of newspapers and
buildings. Radicals and conservatives throughout the nation
are at loggerheads over ousting party offices from factories,
farms, the KGB and the military.</p>
<p>"This is a very difficult period, full of contradictions,"
says Lev Voznesensky, a senior government official. Because
of the lack of a clear divide between the role of party and
state bodies, "there is already a vacuum of power and it will
be terrible if it isn't filled quickly."</p>
<p>A look at two key areas of decision-making, economic
policy and foreign policy, shows why the Communist Party
hardliners are seeing red -- and why Mr. Gorbachev still
can't free himself from the party. Party influence has
undoubtedly diminished. But the state power structures
supposed to take over its functions aren't complete. As a
result, the system of government has become murky at a time
when clear, tough decisions are needed more than ever.</p>
<p>For years, major questions of economic policy were the
party's prerogative. Once its leaders made a decision, the
word was passed down through several departments of the
Central Committee that oversaw whole branches of the economy,
from machine-building to agriculture. Party officials in
every factory and farm and the party-run media then launched
propaganda campaigns to bring the message to the workers.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev, seeking to improve economic efficiency, set
out to change this command system. But taking the party out
of economic management has been a slow process. Although he
quickly closed the Central Committee's economic departments,
party influence lingers on.</p>
<p>When the Soviet leader introduced detailed plans for
perestroika, or economic restructuring, in June 1987, he did
so in the traditional way, at a Central Committee plenary
meeting. When the Soviet parliament recently passed a law on
ownership that permits some private property, it first needed
formal approval from party ideologues. Economists say local
party bureaucrats continue to boss farmers around.</p>
<p>But a decisive moment came this spring, after parliament
elected Mr. Gorbachev as president of the U.S.S.R. Using his
most radical language to date, he announced his intention to
turn the Soviet Union into a "market economy."</p>
<p>For the first time, the party wasn't consulted, even
though switching to a market economy is an ideological
bombshell. Instead, bureaucrats and economists around Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov submitted plans to the Presidential
Council, a newly created body of advisers hand-picked by Mr.
Gorbachev.</p>
<p>The council's reception was cool. "Most of the people were
against the program," says Oleg Bogomolov one of several
leading economists invited to participate at the session. "It
didn't represent a serious attempt to create a market. Its
main point was to curb demand."</p>
<p>The government reworked its plans and presented them again
to the Presidential Council. This time, no independent
economists were invited, and the program was approved. But
all hell broke loose when Mr. Ryzhkov unveiled it in
parliament. The program included steep price rises for bread
and other basic goods, sparking panic-buying. Parliament
rejected the proposals and, after heavy lobbying by Mr.
Ryzhkov's aides to limit the political damage, ordered the
government to come up with a new version.</p>
<p>Party officials are still seething, and their hostility
may have contributed to the public's outraged reaction to the
program. Some party people, notably Mr. Ligachev, openly
question the need for a market economy. But even those who
support the idea say many of the government's problems could
have been avoided if the party had been involved.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure that if we had discussed it in the Central
Committee we would have come up with anything better," says
one senior party official deeply critical of the program's
details. "But maybe it would have prevented them from making
such deep political mistakes."</p>
<p>Even some liberal economists believe it was a mistake to
bypass the party. "There was a need to explain the reform to
people," says economist Otto Latsis, deputy editor of the
party's theoretical journal, Kommunist. "Only the party is in
a position to do that. So far, it is the only consolidating
force in society."</p>
<p>In foreign policy, an area where Mr. Gorbachev has made
the biggest changes, public disputes have been fewer. But the
decision-making process at times has become convoluted as the
functions of party and government officials have blurred.</p>
<p>It used to be simple. Only a handful of people in the top
party leadership made the decision in 1979 to send Soviet
troops into Afghanistan. Although the Defense and Foreign
Affairs ministries were consulted on this and other key
decisions, their input was marginal and any objections were
overridden or ignored, officials say.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Gorbachev's foreign minister, Eduard
Shevardnadze, the foreign policy process has changed beyond
recognition. Mr. Shevardnadze has turned his ministry from a
body that implemented orders into one that formulates policy.
Meanwhile, the Central Committee's international department
is now stripped of much of its staff and most functions. "The
atmosphere there is one of imperial decline," jokes Andrei
Kortunov, an analyst at Moscow's U.S.A. and Canada Institute,
who says his friends in the international department now
spend their time writing articles and traveling abroad.</p>
<p>Still, the Central Committee department retains some
influence, particularly since Alexander Yakovlev, a Gorbachev
confidant, was placed in charge of it in 1988. Mr. Yakovlev
and Mr. Shevardnadze see eye to eye on most important issues.
Together with Mr. Gorbachev, the three men were instrumental
in deciding not to intervene in the anti-Communist
revolutions in Eastern Europe last year.</p>
<p>But at a lower level, there are times when coordination is
difficult, and party bureaucrats still play important roles.</p>
<p>Arms control is one such area. According to officials
involved in the process, Soviet positions are thrashed out at
interagency meetings attended by experts from the Foreign
Ministry, the Defense Ministry, the KGB, representatives of
military industry and Central Committee staffers. These
meetings are chaired by Lev Zaikov, a Politburo member who is
far less liberal than Mr. Shevardnadze.</p>
<p>The result is occasional policy zigzags. This year, Mr.
Shevardnadze appeared to make major concessions to the U.S.
on limiting strategic nuclear weapons. But to the surprise of
the West, Moscow's position then quickly hardened. Foreign
Ministry officials say the change of heart resulted from a
reassessment of the Soviet position at meetings chaired by
Mr. Zaikov.</p>
<p>But in some areas the party has completely given ground,
allowing the ministry a free hand. In the past, ambassadors
to East European nations were party people picked by the
Central Committee. This year, the Foreign Ministry replaced
many of the old guard with professional diplomats. But,
taking into account the spirit of democracy, it first
submitted its list for approval to the Soviet parliament's
foreign affairs committee.</p>
<p>"It was a ridiculous procedure," says Mr. Kortunov of the
U.S.A. and Canada Insitute, who advises the parliament
committee and attended the session. "There was no vote, no
cross questioning. It was just a formal chat."</p>
