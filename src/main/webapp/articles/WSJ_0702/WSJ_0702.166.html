	<p class="article-leader">HOUSTON -- Wainoco Oil Corp., an oil and gas exploration
and production company, said it completed its acquisition of
the U.S. oil and gas properties of Tredegar Industries Inc.,
a Richmond, Va., plastics and aluminum maker, for $15.3
million.
   The properties were acquired for less than the $16.5
million initially expected, because Amerada Hess Corp., New
York, bought some of the properties under a preferential
purchase right, Wainoco said.</p>
