	<p class="article-leader">DALLAS -- Recognition Equipment Inc. will introduce soon a
series of products aimed at the computer imaging market,
company officials said.
   The new products represent a shift in strategy for the
company, which is trying to reshape its own image after a
string of quarterly losses and a host of litigation. As part
of that shift, Recognition Equipment is divesting itself of
some operations to focus its attention on image processing,
systems that enable companies to automate the handling of
paperwork.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The products to be introduced fall into three categories.
One category will enable users to create and modify their own
image processing systems without requiring sophisticated
programming knowledge. The second will enable users to enter
images and data from documents into the system. The third is
made up of workstation products that enable each user to
program the system to handle specific work applications.
Recognition Equipment can sell customers products in each
category or bundle them into a complete system.</p>
<p>Recognition Equipment has been involved in optical
scanning products for some time. But in the past few months,
the company has shifted its strategic focus from developing
specific, proprietary systems to industry-standard products
that can be adapted to any customer's equipment, said Tom
Hurley, co-chief executive officer.</p>
<p>The company also is approaching the market differently,
Mr. Hurley said, by teaming with computer makers and systems
integrators to develop complete systems for customers. As an
example, he cited the proposal the company submitted with
Wang Laboratories Inc. to provide a large state agency with
an imaging system that would automate the handling of tax
forms. In other projects, the company is teaming with
companies such as International Business Machines Corp. and
Andersen Consulting.</p>
<p>Mr. Hurley said Recognition Equipment is focusing its
marketing attention on systems for government agencies and
transportation, insurance and financial services companies,
all of which handle large amounts of documents. But it hopes
to gain business in other market niches through its partners.</p>
<p>Bob Vanourek, co-chief executive, said that the company is
looking at the possibility of selling assets that contribute
about $100 million in sales annually, but that only the
Postalogic division, which makes mail reading and sorting
systems, has been sold. Because of the difficulty in finding
financing sources these days, he said, the sale of assets
hasn't progressed as quickly as hoped. And he said the
company isn't under any pressure to sell and may choose to
operate the divisions as autonomous units if adequate bids
don't emerge.</p>
<p>Mr. Vanourek wouldn't project earnings, but said the
company is "getting close" to returning to profitability. For
the first half ended April 30, the company had a net loss of
$13 million, wider than the $490,000 loss a year earlier.</p>
<p>Mr. Vanourek also noted that the company increased its
cash balances to $45 million at the end of the second quarter
from about $25 million a year earlier, and attracted some
significant new outside institutional investors. He also
estimated that the company's work force has shrunk about 11%
to about 2,200 in recent months, and said the major staff
reductions "are behind us."</p>
<p>Messrs Hurley and Vanourek were installed as co-chief
executives late last year under an agreement with Prospect
Group, a leveraged buy-out firm that attempted to take over
Recognition Equipment. New York-based Prospect owns a 14%
stake in the company. Recognition has been mired in eight
civil lawsuits relating to a 1988 indictment that accused the
company and two of its top officers with attempting to
manipulate the award of $400 million in U.S. Postal Service
contracts. In November, a federal judge acquitted all
defendants in the case; since then, Mr. Vanourek said, the
company has settled most of the major litigation stemming
from the indictments.</p>
