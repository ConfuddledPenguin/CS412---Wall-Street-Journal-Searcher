	<p class="article-leader">The following are excerpts from an interview with Saddam
Hussein, president of Iraq, by Karen Elliott House of the
Journal. They enlarge on issues discussed in Ms. House's
article on page one of this newspaper Thursday. A related
editorial appears nearby.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>How has the end to the Cold War affected the Mideast?</p>
<p>The positive side is much greater than the negative
impact.</p>
<p>The positive side is that this will make the Arab nation
one single share and not two to be divided between two
superpowers. . . . America can no longer say Arabs are tools
of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The negative side is that it is now clear the U.S. can
exert influence on the Soviets and make them abandon any
position contrary to the U.S. So the U.S. thinks it can cast
things any way it wants in the region and in alliance with
Israel can suppress any voice in support of Arab rights. So,
the U.S. has tilted more towards Israel. This is a very grave
change.</p>
<p>Can Egypt sit out a war?</p>
<p>Peace is the prevailing theme in the Arab world for all
Arabs. Any Arab who wants to defend his rights should not be
interpreted as not desiring peace. Egypt is part of the Arab
world.</p>
<p>If war were to break out as a result of the expansionist
policy of Israel it is only natural that this will be fought
by all Arabs. . . . (I)f fighting continues for a long time
no Arab individual shall remain capable of remaining outside
the circle of contribution to confrontation with Israel.</p>
<p>Israel is accustomed in other wars to snatching quickly
from Arabs valuable objectives and this has helped Israel in
maintaining its expansionist policies.</p>
<p>So if Israel were to conduct an aggression, then the con-
frontation must be long. This is the view of Iraq and Arabs
have no different view. Once the fighting continues for a
long time the outcome will be different. It will not be what
Israel desires.</p>
<p>How can there be a long war when Israel possesses nuclear
weapons?</p>
<p>Arabs do have new weapons which may be sufficient for
confronting this small population (Israel) if it were to
commit aggression against the larger population.</p>
<p>Do you mean chemicals can deter nuclear weapons?</p>
<p>Yes, I believe chemicals constitute a deterrent. Why
should the U.S. fail to voice concern when they and others
helped Israel possess nuclear weapons? When I said if Israel
attacks Iraq with nuclear weapons then Iraq would respond
with chemicals, all hell was raised and still is being
raised.</p>
<p>This has been treated as a threat. It is as if the
objective was that Arabs should accept that Israel has
nuclear weapons and can dictate the situation and Arabs
should abandon all their rights.</p>
<p>Are you seeking a nuclear capability?</p>
<p>It has neither been in our program nor is it now in our
program to use these for military purposes.</p>
<p>Iraq is in possession of binary chemical weapons. Our
scientists and technicians and military men calculate that
this is sufficient to deter an Israeli nuclear weapon. If the
U.S. were to lend us nuclear weapons with the objective of
striking a balance with the nuclear weapons given Israel, we
shall not decline them.</p>
<p>Do you expect more terrorism?</p>
<p>The U.S. went through a war to create an independent union
and civilians were killed. So let us address human issues on
a single standard. We cannot talk about those deprived of
basic rights as terrorists. The U.S. attacked the house of
(Libyan leader Moammar) Gadhafi with women and children
inside. The raid killed civilians. Is this terrorism? If
Palestinians conduct an attack in the occupied territories,
if such Palestinians are regarded as terrorists, we have to
regard the president of the United States as the greatest
terrorist.</p>
<p>Is war inevitable?</p>
<p>The U.S. is not prepared to sacrifice anything for peace
in the area. Does the U.S. feel it is doing us a favor just
talking to the PLO? It is the PLO that is doing the U.S. a
favor. It is opening a dialogue with a country whose bias is
clear for Israel.</p>
<p>It is the duty of the U.S. to make peace comprehensive.
The U.S. should give up the evil ideas of the Zionist lobby
including the false view that the U.S. cannot guarantee oil
supplies without Israel in the region to insure that.</p>
<p>What is your oil strategy?</p>
<p>Oil is $14 a barrel now, one half the real level of 1971.
This price does not respond to the true value. Who is
responsible for this injustice? Western countries. Isn't this
a conspiracy against the economy of the region? We do not
want to use oil as a political weapon. . . . But nobody can
eliminate the significance of economics in political
relations.</p>
<p>What are prospects of a final peace with Iran?</p>
<p>We are conducting direct dialogue with the Iranians and
each party has told the other that we are placing great hopes
on this dialogue achieving the desired objectives. So my hope
is great that peace will come about between Iran and Iraq.</p>
<p>Why do you call on U.S. ships to leave the Persian Gulf?</p>
<p>We were not consulted by the U.S. when the ships were
brought in, but we didn't fight their presence because some
of our Arab brothers under the existence of Iranian
aggression saw it proper that U.S. ships should be allowed.
But now that East-West relations have achieved such a
positive level and now that the Iraq-Iran War is over, we
cannot see how the presence of U.S. ships can be interpreted
for positive reasons. Ask the U.S. what are the reasons for
their presence other than conducting intelligence on Arabs
for Israel or creating a naval military situation between
Iraq and Iran.</p>
