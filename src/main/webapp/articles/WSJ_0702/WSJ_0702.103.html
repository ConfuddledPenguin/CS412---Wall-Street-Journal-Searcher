	<p class="article-leader">Rite Aid Corp., the nation's largest drugstore chain, and
its president will go to trial today in Cleveland on charges
that they tried to bribe a member of the Ohio Board of
Pharmacy.
   Attorneys for the company say a judge's ruling last week
that some taped conversations of Rite Aid president Martin L.
Grass can't be used as trial evidence was a key victory.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Grass and the company are charged with paying a member
of the Ohio Board of Pharmacy $33,000 to resign as part of an
alleged scheme to pack the board with people more friendly to
Shiremanstown, Pa.-based Rite Aid. The company insists the
payment was a legitimate buy-out of an existing consulting
contract with the board member, Melvin T. Wilczynski.</p>
<p>Last week, Cuyahoga County (Ohio) Common Pleas Court Judge
Lillian Greene ruled that pharmacy-board investigators had no
authority to tape conversations between Mr. Grass and Mr.
Wilczynski because bribery doesn't fall under the board's
jurisdiction. The judge suppressed three taped conversations
but said a fourth tape and a videotape of the payment could
be used at the trial. The two tapes were made by Cuyahoga
County sheriff's officers.</p>
<p>John Jeffries, professor of law at the University of
Virginia, called the suppression of the tapes "very
surprising" and "hostile to the prosecution." He says such
taping is legal under federal law because one party to the
conversations, Mr. Wilczynski, consented.</p>
<p>Rite Aid attorney George J. Moscarino, of the Cleveland
law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis & Pogue, says the ruling will
help prove Rite Aid's innocence. "The ruling finally enables
us to show the tremendous bias and outrageous misconduct of
the pharmacy-board investigators," Mr. Moscarino says. He
contends board investigators had a grudge against Rite Aid
and "venue shopped" after a prosecutor in another county
refused to bring the charges.</p>
<p>Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor William R. Caine, who
brought the case against the company, declined to comment.</p>
<p>But others close to the case said the suppressed tapes
aren't crucial to the prosecution. They say prosecutors can
rely on the videotape of an April 27, 1989, meeting in a
Cleveland airport hotel room. The tape shows Mr. Grass
handing Mr. Wilczynski a corporate check and six copies of an
undated resignation letter to Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste,
which Mr. Grass instructed him to sign. On the tape, Mr.
Grass said that Gov. Celeste had agreed to appoint a Rite Aid
official as Mr. Wilczynski's successor on the board.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Gov. Celeste vigorously denied an
agreement.</p>

<p>LENDER LIABILITY LIMITED in some environmental cases by
Colorado statute.</p>
<p>The law, which took effect July 1, is designed to shield
financial institutions in situations where they have
foreclosed on loans to companies that own or operate property
contaminated with hazardous substances. Because lenders
acquire such properties in foreclosure, they're increasingly
named as defendants in environmental damage suits filed by
adjoining landowners and others who contend their property
values have been hurt by the pollution.</p>
<p>The Colorado law exempts lenders from these so-called
third-party claims if the contamination occurred before the
lender acquired the property. Even if it occurred afterwards,
a lender may be exempt if it had the property properly
inspected before foreclosing and didn't "knowingly and
recklessly" cause the pollution.</p>
<p>Colorado is the first state to impose such limits on
lender liability, but the law is attracting considerable
attention from other states, says John Byrne, senior counsel
at the American Bankers Association in Washington, D.C. "It's
a positive change," says Mr. Byrne.</p>
<p>Some environmentalists had contended that the law unfairly
limits a plaintiff's right to sue. But Colorado bankers
countered that it will help small businesses that handle
hazardous materials. They said banks were refusing to make
loans to such companies because of the prospect of litigation
if the lender had to foreclose. "This law eliminates some of
the uncertainty," says Jac K. Sperling, an attorney with
Denver-based Fairfield & Woods, counsel for the Colorado
Bankers Association.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Byrne notes that the law doesn't restrict a
lender's liability for cleanup costs (as distinct from
property-damage costs) at a site owned by a company to which
it lent money.</p>
<p>Last May a decision by the federal appeals court in
Atlanta apparently expanded the potential cleanup liability
of financial institutions.</p>

<p>FREE-SPEECH PROTECTION for fund-raisers eroded in New York
ruling.</p>
<p>Philanthropists who feel deceived by fund-raising
campaigns may sue charities in New York for fraud and
misrepresentation without having to prove the charities
intended to deceive givers. The decision was part of a state
appeals court ruling in a case brought by several American
Jewish donors against the Jewish National Fund.</p>
<p>The donors filed the suit in September 1988, claiming that
the fund had violated New York consumer protection laws by
leading them to believe that donations aided tree planting in
all of Israel, including the territories occupied after the
1967 war with Arab countries. The fund, however, only plants
trees in land held before the war.</p>
<p>The charity challenged one part of a lower court ruling,
which ordered it to state in its literature that it does not
plant trees in occupied territories. The plaintiffs
challenged another part of the lower court ruling that
dismissed the claim that the fund had violated New York
consumer protection laws.</p>
<p>In a 4-1 decision, the Appellate Division of the state
Supreme Court reinstated the plaintiffs' consumer law claim
and upheld the injunction (requiring explanation of where the
trees will be planted) imposed by the lower court. "While the
solicitation of charitable donations is a form of protected
speech, it is subject to narrowly drawn government regulation
designed to protect the public from fraud or other deceptive
practices," the court ruled.</p>
<p>The dissenting judge wrote that "the leading case on
charitable solicitation . . . makes it clear that such
solicitations involve speech protected by the First
Amendment."</p>
<p>The plaintiffs' lawyer, Howard Rubin of Goldman, Drazen,
Rick, Steiner & Rubin, says the ruling means that anyone who
gives money based on statements calculated to persuade now
has the right to sue for fraud.</p>
<p>The fund's lawyer, Stephen Wagner of Anderson Kill Olick &
Oshinsky, says he will probably appeal. If upheld by the
Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state, the ruling
will force all advertisers -- not just charities -- to screen
all advertising and campaign copy closely to weed out
statements that might be construed as deceptive, regardless
of the intent, Mr. Wagner said. Such a decision might
persuade courts in other states to construe their consumer
laws in the same broad manner, he said.</p>
<p>"It will be a very grave restriction of the First
Amendment rights" of anyone who advertises, Mr. Wagner warns.</p>

<p>JUDGE DENIES UNUSUAL REQUEST in libel suit.</p>
<p>Federal Judge Edward S. Northrop of Baltimore ruled last
week that National Life Insurance Co., a Montpelier,
Vt.-based insurance company, isn't entitled to receive the
names and addresses of people who received copies of
allegedly defamatory materials.</p>
<p>National Life had sought the information in connection
with a suit it filed in May seeking $13 million in damages
against Phillips Publishing Inc., a Potomac, Md.-based
publisher of consumer and trade newsletters and magazines,
and Richard E. Band, a financial analyst who edits a Phillips
publication called Richard E. Band's Profitable Investing.</p>
<p>The suit alleges that in a series of special reports,
articles and promotional materials, Mr. Band made false and
defamatory statements about the company's financial stability
that damaged its reputation and business. The Wall Street
Digest Inc., a Sarasota, Fla.-based financial newsletter
publisher that reprinted one of Mr. Band's articles, is also
a defendant in the suit.</p>
<p>The defendants deny the allegations.</p>
<p>National Life sought the names of subscribers and the
approximately one million people who recieved promotional
material containing Mr. Band's findings. Profitable Investing
has 2,400 subscribers; the Wall Street Digest has 25,000.</p>
<p>Theodore Sherbow, a lawyer with the Baltimore firm of
Weinberg & Green who is representing National Life, said the
request was an attempt by the company to engage in
"self-help" to correct the false information, as urged by
former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell in another
libel case.</p>
<p>But Bruce W. Sanford, in the Washington, D.C., office of
Cleveland-based Baker & Hostetler, attorneys for Phillips and
Mr. Band, said National Life's request would have resulted in
"the court helping them engage in a war of public opinion
rather than a war of litigation."</p>
<p>In his ruling, Judge Northrop wrote that the information
didn't seem relevant to National Life's case at the present
time, but said the company could resubmit its request at a
later date.</p>

<p>FORMER CONGRESSMAN'S extortion conviction in Wedtech
scandal is overturned.</p>
<p>A federal appeals court reversed the convictions of former
U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia, of New York, and his wife, Jane Lee
Garcia, who were convicted in October. Mr. Garcia, a Democrat
who had represented the Bronx for six terms, resigned
earlier.</p>
<p>The court ruled that insufficient evidence may have been
presented to prove that the Garcias committed extortion. The
case stemmed from payments and loans that Wedtech Corp., a
defunct defense contractor in the Bronx, made to the Garcias
in return for favors by the congressman.</p>
<p>The appeals-court panel said prosecutors failed to prove
that Wedtech made the payments out of fear of economic loss,
one of the legal definitions of extortion. Instead, the
appeals court said, "By paying the Garcias, Wedtech was
purchasing an advocate, not buying off a thug."</p>
<p>A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office said no
decision has been made on whether to appeal the decision.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>THE SENATE CONFIRMED three new members for the U.S.
Sentencing Commission, giving the panel a full complement of
seven. The new members are Julie Carnes, a former assistant
U.S. attorney in Atlanta, David Mazzone, a federal judge in
Boston, and Michael Gelacak, a Washington lawyer and former
Senate aide. The commission establishes guidelines for
criminal sentences in the federal courts.</p>
