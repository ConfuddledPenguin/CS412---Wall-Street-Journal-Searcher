	<p class="article-leader">CHICAGO -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange said it issued
fines totaling $165,000 for "major" violations of exchange
trading rules.
   The Merc fined Ronald Wertz, a former commodity
representative, $125,000 for making unauthorized sales in its
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index futures pit and allocating
them to customer accounts in April 1987. The exchange also
said Mr. Wertz made unauthorized transfers of funds out of
customer accounts in 1986 and 1987.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Wertz, who failed to appear at the hearing where the
exchange found him culpable and who couldn't be reached for
comment Friday, also was stripped of his rights to act as a
commodity representative.</p>
<p>In addition, the exchange fined James G. Sledz $40,000,
and expelled him from membership in the Merc. Mr. Sledz, the
exchange said, "prearranged" yen futures trades in August and
October of 1987. Mr. Sledz "participated in an ongoing
pattern of illegal transactions in which brokers deliberately
converted customer funds and opportunities to their own use
and the use of others," according to the exchange.</p>
<p>Mr. Sledz is cooperating with federal officials in their
broad investigation into trading abuses at the Chicago
futures pits, and the information about his alleged
violations was included in his plea agreement, a Merc
spokesman said.</p>
