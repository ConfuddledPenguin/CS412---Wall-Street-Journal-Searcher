	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Fairfield-Noble Corp. said that it
discontinued operations and that its lenders have foreclosed
on its loans.
   The maker and seller of sportswear for women and girls
blamed a tumultous retail environment and the company's
failure to obtain financing for its decision last Friday to
close. A spokesman wouldn't elaborate.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Fairfield-Noble, which went public in 1969, consisted of
its Lloyd Williams and Cathy Hardwick divisions. The company
closed the Cathy Hardwick unit during the fiscal year that
ended June 30, 1989, for which it had a net loss of $5.9
million, on $24.5 million in sales.</p>
<p>According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings,
the company in fiscal 1989 violated its loan agreement with
Chase Manhattan Bank, but it didn't default; if it had,
Fairfield-Noble said in SEC filings, it would have been
unable to continue operations.</p>
<p>According to SEC filings, Fairfield-Noble at Sept. 30,
1989, had assets of $5.9 million and a net worth, or assets
minus liabilities, of $11,000. It had 2.3 million shares
outstanding. Two principals, Hy Rabin and Clarence Scaduto,
controlled 45.2% of the company's stock. As of June 30, 1989,
Fairfield-Noble had a total of 2,400 shareholders.</p>
