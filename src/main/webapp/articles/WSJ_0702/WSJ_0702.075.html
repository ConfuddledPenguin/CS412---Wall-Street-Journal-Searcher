	<p class="article-leader">If you want to watch "Batman" on your home videocassette
recorder, nearly every video store has a copy for rent. But
if your taste runs to stomach-turning cult movies such as
"Horrors of the Black Museum" or "Blood Feast," Video Vault
in Alexandria, Va., has them to go.
   "Guaranteed Worst Movies in Town" is Video Vault's slogan.
Owner Jim McCabe notes proudly that his inventory of film
turkeys on video also includes "Scum of the Earth," "Kill
Baby Kill" and several copies of "Plan 9 From Outer Space,"
which, he adds, "is considered the worst movie of all time."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Stocking hard-to-find cult movie classics is Video Vault's
way of attracting attention in the maturing and overcrowded
retail video industry. Growth in the rental business has
slowed, and rentals per household fell last year from 1986.
Moreover, national or regional chains run by such companies
as Blockbuster Entertainment Corp., Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
and West Coast Video Ltd., Philadelphia, increasingly
dominate the field. But many single and dual outlet video
retailers are finding new ways to attract customers.</p>
<p>The winning formulas typically involve marketing ideas,
such as Mr. McCabe's "worst movie" campaign, that set the
small stores apart from the cookie-cutter approach of the
chains. Other profit-making ideas from the video independents
include home delivery of video rentals, mail-order sales and
rentals, wide-ranging inventories and attention-getting
promotions to lure customers to the store.</p>
<p>"The days of opening a store, putting posters in the
windows and having the customers flock in are gone," says Lou
Berg, owner of Audio-Video Plus in Houston.</p>
<p>Single outlet video stores, once the staple of the
industry, now make up half of the nation's roughly 27,000
video retail outlets, says Paul Eisele, president of the
Fairfield Group, video industry consultants in Westport,
Conn. About 15% are owned by chains with 50 or more outlets,
and this sector is growing fast. The remaining stores belong
to smaller chains. A $50,000 investment used to be enough to
open a mom-and-pop video store. But Mr. Eisele says it now
takes $500,000 to open a state-of-the-art video superstore.</p>
<p>Many of the small survivors entered the business in the
video boom years of the late 1970s and have had a decade to
win customer loyalty. But times have changed. These days,
says Michael Becker, owner of Video Room in New York City:
"You have to work at keeping your customer base." Otherwise,
he says, a new chain-store outlet, "with its advertising
clout, can knock you out of the box."</p>
<p>A lot of single outlets crashed in the late 1980s. Some
lacked the money required to buy multiple copies of the
Hollywood hits that most customers want. Others were victims
of price-cutting and longer rental periods offered as
inducements by new chain outlets.</p>
<p>But many have found ways to survive. A firm believer that
video shopping should be fun, Mr. Berg makes his two Houston
outlets attractions in themselves. An inflated gorilla
hanging from an Empire State Building replica over the front
door announced the arrival of "King Kong" on video. A
costumed Ninja Turtle greeted kiddies one weekend. When a
"Star Trek" video was released, Mr. Berg built a replica of
the Starship Enterprise's bridge and took pictures of
customers sitting in Capt. Kirk's chair.</p>
<p>He also stresses an exhaustive inventory. "It's not the
size of the store, it's the breadth of the titles," Mr. Berg
says. His stores stock 23,000 different titles, compared with
roughly 8,000 for the average Blockbuster outlet. Mr. Berg
says Audio-Video Plus revenue is growing about 10% annually.
And though most stores depend on rentals, his derive about
70% of their revenue from sales of videos.</p>
<p>"Don't kid yourself," says Video Vault's Mr. McCabe.
"You've got to carry the new movies." Specialties such as his
horror movie list "kind of enhance the image," he says.</p>
<p>In New York, Mr. Becker plays to the ethnic, cosmopolitan
life style of Manhattan's Upper East Side by stocking some
1,200 foreign films, as well as the usual assortment of
American movies in his 11-year-old store. "The fewer times
you disappoint the customers, the less chance they have of
going elsewhere," he says.</p>
<p>Since returning videos is an annoyance -- Mr. Berg in
Houston likens it to "taking your clothes to the dry
cleaners" -- Mr. Becker's Video Room uses bicycle messengers
to pick up and deliver videos from apartment house doormen.
His bike crew, weaving through Manhattan traffic, makes as
many as 600 deliveries on a busy Saturday.</p>
<p>Jim Salzer, owner of Salzer's Video in Ventura, Calif., a
burgeoning coastal community north of Los Angeles, says he's
facing six new Blockbuster outlets in his market. "I've got
one factor on my side, and that's location," he says.
Salzer's Video, an addition to the record store he's run for
24 years, is next to a Highway 101 exit ramp that's used by
42,000 cars on an average day.</p>
<p>Location isn't Mr. Salzer's only weapon. He spent $12,000
on a sort of video automatic teller machine tied to his
store's computer. It allows customers both to return and to
rent videos after business hours. Playing the fast-food and
merchandising angles, Mr. Salzer stocks beer, wine, ice
cream, potato chips, T-shirts and posters, in addition to
20,000 video titles. "A lot of people think we're crazy,
{but} we're looking at a real high profit margin," typically
a 50% markup on non-video items, Mr. Salzer says. Sales for
this year's first half have climbed 15% from a year earlier,
he says.</p>
<p>Mail order is getting attention from video retailers.
Jerry Frebowitz, who has five Movies Unlimited stores in the
Philadelphia area, also has a 656-page catalog "loaded with
things you don't find in your video store: films from the
'50s, `The Brain That Wouldn't Die,' classic serials such as
Captain Marvel and Flash Gordon."</p>
<p>In Alexandria, Mr. McCabe's Video Vault started renting
cult movies by mail this spring. "We're getting 50 phone
calls a day," he says. "I've got one {employee} who does
nothing but mail order." Customers pay a $19.95 membership
fee. Rentals cost $15 for three movies for three days. Mr.
McCabe says word of his service has spread through
underground horror genre magazines such as Gore Gazette and
Psychotronic Video.</p>
<p>"I've got members in 35 states," he says, "and they
definitely aren't renting `Ferris Bueller's Day Off.'"</p>
