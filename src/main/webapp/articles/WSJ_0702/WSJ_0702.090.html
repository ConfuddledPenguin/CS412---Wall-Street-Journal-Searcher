	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Robert Campeau and National Bank of Canada were
silent this weekend about whether Mr. Campeau had made a
first payment of 40 million Canadian dollars (US$34.2
million) to retrieve his Campeau Corp. securities seized by
the bank.
   Mr. Campeau, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Toronto real estate and retailing company, had until midnight
Saturday to come up with the money. National Bank, based in
Montreal, seized the securities in January after Mr. Campeau
defaulted on personal loans amounting to C$153 million. Mr.
Campeau previously faced a deadline of May 31 to make a first
payment, but that deadline was extended.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The new deadline fell as Campeau Corp. reported a widening
loss for its first quarter ended April 30.</p>
<p>After National Bank's seizure of securities, Mr. Campeau's
fully diluted stake in Campeau Corp. fell to about 21% from
43%. The securities included 13 million Campeau Corp. common
shares, C$60.4 million of convertible debentures and four
million convertible preference shares.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Campeau's agreement with National Bank, he was
to pay a further C$40 million by Jan. 31, 1992, or, failing
that, pledge the C$60.4 million of debentures back to the
bank. National Bank agreed to vote the securities seized
according to Mr. Campeau's direction.</p>
<p>Separately, Campeau Corp. said that Edward J. DeBartolo
Corp., a Youngstown, Ohio, developer, agreed to extend to
July 20 an agreement not to call its US$480 million loan
without first giving nine days' notice. The agreement, which
has been extended several times, was due to expire Saturday.
A similar agreement with the Reichmann family's Olympia &
York Developments Ltd. doesn't have an expiry date.</p>
<p>Campeau Corp. defaulted in January on the DeBartolo loan
and on US$225 million remaining in a loan from Olympia & York
when its U.S. retailing units, Federated Department Stores
Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection. In March, Campeau Corp. refused to pay interest
due on the loans.</p>
<p>Campeau Corp. itself hasn't filed for bankruptcy or
liquidation in Canada, but it has said it plans to seek
approval at the July 30 annual meeting to dispose of a
"substantial portion" of its Canadian real estate assets to
reduce debt.</p>
<p>For its first quarter, Campeau Corp. reported a loss of
US$80 million, or $1.87 a share. A year earlier, it had a
loss of $67 million, or $1.65 a share. Revenue rose slightly
to $2.26 billion from $2.23 billion.</p>
<p>The latest period's result included a $47 million gain
from the sale of assets, compared with a gain of $98 million
a year earlier. The company also had a $21 million charge in
the most recent period related to Chapter 11 reorganization
costs. There wasn't a similar charge a year earlier.</p>
<p>Operating profit declined to $185 million from $213
million. Operating profit, defined as earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and costs related
to Chapter 11 reorganization, is considered the most accurate
measure of a business under Chapter 11.</p>
