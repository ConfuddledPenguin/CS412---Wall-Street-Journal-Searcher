	<p class="article-leader">Comprehensive Care Corp. said it agreed to settle a class
action lawsuit by paying $150,000 in cash, and issuing
687,500 shares of common stock.
   The company, which denied any wrongdoing, said the
litigation arose of an unsuccessful attempt by closely held
First Hospital Corp. of Norfolk, Va. to acquire it last year.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Comprehensive Care, which runs chemical dependency
treatment programs, said the settlement is subject to
approval by the court, among other things.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Care shares closed Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange at $2.625, unchanged. That price gives an
indicated value of $1.8 million to the shares that will be
issued. The company currently has about 10.2 million common
shares outstanding.</p>
