	<p class="article-leader">Major steelmakers, while rebounding from a lackluster
first quarter, will post lower second-quarter earnings as
prices and orders failed to match last year's robust levels.
   Analysts said average profits for each ton of steel
shipped in the second quarter will range from $20 to $25 a
ton, up from about $15 in the first quarter but down from $50
in last year's second quarter.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The average second-quarter profits are somewhat skewed
because of special problems at various steelmakers, including
maintenance-related outages, one-time charges and start-up
costs of new plants. Excluding those special items, according
to John Tumazos, a steel analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette, major producers would have earned about $30 per ton
of steel shipped.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, relieved steelmakers began seeing
steadily improving volume and pricing.</p>
<p>The pricing erosion that began in the second half of 1989
appears to have halted, as modest price increases were
announced and implemented on most key plate and sheet
products. Still, selling prices, while improved from the
first quarter, are about $20 a ton lower than a year ago,
says Mr. Tumazos.</p>
<p>And while prices are beginning to rise, so are labor, raw
material and energy costs. All steelmakers, except industry
leader USX Corp., have negotiated higher-cost labor contracts
within the past year. USX, whose contract with the United
Steelworkers expires in January 1991, will begin negotiations
in the second half.</p>
<p>Most steelmakers also began to see orders pick up at the
end of the first quarter, as car makers began boosting
production. J. Clarence Morrison, a metals analyst with
Prudential-Bache Capital Funding, noted that booming orders
continued through the second quarter and became more
broad-based, extending to smaller buyers serving the energy,
agriculture and equipment-making industries.</p>
<p>Still, those positive factors weren't enough to offset
problems at some major steelmakers.</p>
<p>Hardest hit was Armco Inc., which expects to post a
second-quarter loss. The company recently announced that it
would take a $70 million charge in the quarter for a jury
award against it, a federal tax assessment and ongoing
toubles at its insurance and financial companies, which are
in liquidation.</p>
<p>But even without the charges, analysts said Armco would
post an operating loss of about 10 cents to 15 cents a share,
compared with last year's profits of $75.6 million, or 84
cents, including a $45 million loss from discontinued
operations. Armco has had trouble with its Brazilian
operations, and lost carbon-steel orders in the quarter
because of prolonged labor talks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, earnings at Bethlehem Steel Corp., the nation's
No. 2 steelmaker, were squeezed by the close-down of its
blast furnace at Sparrows Point, Md., for repairs. Analysts
expect Bethlehem to earn between $10 and $15 a ton in the
second quarter, compared to $13 a ton in the first quarter.
Per share earnings are estimated at about 25 cents a share,
down from $1.03 a year ago.</p>
<p>Inland Steel Industries Inc. experienced start-up costs
for its I/N Tek joint venture with Nippon Steel, but should
be able to earn about $25 to $30 a ton, compared to last
year's $56 a ton, analysts said.</p>
<p>USX will likely lead its competitors in profits per ton,
in part because the company didn't have any unusual items.
The No. 1 steelmaker is expected to earn between $30 and $32
a ton, compared to $53 a ton last year, and $23 a ton in the
first quarter, according to Charles Bradford, an independent
steel analyst.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the third quarter may be the industry's
best of the year. By then, steelmakers should more fully
benefit from major price increases slated for shipments
beginning July 1. And auto-related orders could pick up even
more in anticipation of a possible strike against the auto
makers, which begin contract negotiations in September.</p>
<p>The big wild card is imports, which were surprisingly low
in the first half. But a soft world economy, especially in
countries like Brazil, and falling spot prices in Europe may
lead foreign steelmakers to increasingly seek sales in the
U.S. "There's a risk of rising foreign deliveries in second
half," said Peter Marcus, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.</p>
<p>And those increased imports could be chasing after fewer
orders.</p>
<p>Prudential's Mr. Morrison notes that the industry is
heading into a seasonal low. "Can this high level of order
pattern that we've seen lately be sustained?" he asked. The
answer, he said, may be in the performance of the durable
goods market.</p>
