	<p class="article-leader">A federal court jury in Boston awarded Cool Light Co. of
Hollywood, Calif., $16 million in punitive and compensatory
damages to be paid by GTE Products Corp., a unit of GTE
Corp., Stamford, Conn., for fraud, breach of contract and
failure to deal "fairly and in good faith."
   Cool Light, a maker of television studio lights that
generate 80% less heat than traditional studio lights,
alleged that GTE Products, a Danvers, Mass., lighting
products maker, breached a contract to make parts of Cool
Light's product and subsequently produced its own version of
the light. Cool Light brought in a host of celebrities,
including the actors Michael Landon, Ed Asner and Angie
Dickinson, to testify in the trial on behalf of the light's
inventor, George Panagiotou.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GTE Products officials denied any wrongdoing and said they
are considering an appeal. "We're disappointed at the jury's
verdict and a little puzzled, because we continue to believe
that we did nothing wrong," Vincent D'Alessandro, a GTE
Products vice president, said.</p>
