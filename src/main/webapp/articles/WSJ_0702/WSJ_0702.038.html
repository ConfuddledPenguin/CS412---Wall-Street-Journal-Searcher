	<p class="article-leader">BOSTON -- Bank of New England, continuing its
retrenchment, said it will sell or close 95 branches, more
than half of them in Massachusetts, as a cost-cutting
measure.
   The closings are part of a previously announced plan by
the bank to trim overhead by 35% in the next five months in
an effort to return to profitability. "By concentrating our
focus on locations with the most potential, we will improve
customer service while reducing overhead," said Chairman
Lawrence K. Fish.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Bank of New England, one of the most aggressive lenders in
the region in the 1980s, has been hurt by the deepening real
estate slump. It reported a first-quarter loss of $46.6
million, or 68 cents a share, despite one-time gains from the
sale of $173 million in assets. It posted a loss of $1.11
billion last year.</p>
<p>In all, 52 branches in Massachusetts and 25 in Connecticut
are slated for sale or consolidation, said bank spokesman
Thomas L. Lavelle. Closing or sale of another 18 branches,
some in rural areas of western Massachusetts, is planned,
said Mr. Lavelle. The bank is also planning to sell its
subsidiaries in Maine and Rhode Island by year's end. Once
all such plans are carried through, the bank's total will
have dropped from its current level of 444 branches to 281.</p>
<p>Analysts agree it may be difficult for the bank to sell
very many of its branches during the consolidation. "If you
want to get a branch cheap, you just pick one up from the
(Resolution Trust Corportation)," said Tracey Stangle, an
analyst and senior vice president with First Albany Corp.
"They'll sell them for nothing, which is about all most New
England banks can afford right now."</p>
