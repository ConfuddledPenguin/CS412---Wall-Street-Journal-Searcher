	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Sales of new homes rose a slight 0.4% in May
after declining for five months, but still failed to spark
any optimism about the strength of the housing industry.
   "The number is up an undistinguishable amount from the
past declines," said Martin Regalia, chief economist for the
National Council of Savings Institutions in Washington.
"These numbers are really indications of a housing
recession."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In the report, the Housing and Urban Development and
Commerce Departments said new single-family homes were sold
at an annual rate of 532,000 in May. Sales had declined 5.2%
in April to a 530,000 pace, and they dropped 7.8% in March to
a 559,000 clip.</p>
<p>"The slight increase in May isn't something to cheer
about," said Gary Ciminero, chief economist for Fleet/Norstar
Financial Group in Washington. "I'd say we're still wallowing
around as far as new housing sales are concerned . . . I
expect the downward trend to continue."</p>
<p>Most economists agree that the May report reflects the
recessionary state of the housing sector and they predicted
further drops in housing prices as a result.</p>
<p>"Home-sale prices will have to decline to reduce the glut
of unsold homes," said Mr. Ciminero. "We're already starting
to see some decline in home-sale prices, particularly in the
Northeast. Once we get some reliable data that's up to date
we might see some more regional declines."</p>
<p>New homes in the Northeast were sold at an annual rate of
84,000 in May, down from the 94,000 rate in April and the
86,000 pace in March. The South also experienced a decline,
with new homes sold at an annual rate of 199,000 in May
compared to 201,000 in April. New-home sales were up from the
previous month in both the Midwest and the West.</p>
<p>However, housing numbers are generally regarded as
imprecise and are subject to significant revisions. All
numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations.</p>
