	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Junk bonds, the sorriest securities in the
fixed-income market just a few months ago, are climbing out
of their deep hole.
   The high-risk, high-yield bonds posted a total return of
4.31% in the second-quarter, according to Merrill Lynch & Co.
Statistics compiled by First Boston Corp., which unlike
Merrill Lynch includes in its study highly volatile
zero-coupon bonds, said junk bonds posted a total return of
5.74% in the second quarter. Only convertibles, which are
bonds that can be exchanged for stock, outperformed junk
during the second quarter, thanks largely to a soaring stock
market.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>While the returns for junk bonds are respectable, they are
far from spectacular considering investors could have gotten
similar returns by investing in long-term Treasury bonds.
Long-term Treasurys posted a total return of 4.30% in the
second quarter after a negative 4.02% return in the first
quarter. And investing in Treasurys, which are considered the
safest securities in the world, doesn't create the nail
bitting, sweaty palms and sleepless nights that have come
with investing in junk.</p>
<p>Still, junk's second-quarter performance represents an
important turning point for a market that nearly collapsed
last September. Junk bonds posted negative total returns
(interest payments plus price changes) in this year's first
quarter and the fourth quarter of 1989.</p>
<p>The current junk-bond recovery could come to a screeching
halt if the economy contracts or if interest rates rise. And
with prices of most middle-tier and lower-tier junk bonds
trading at substantial discounts to their face value, prices
have a long upward climb before they are anywhere near full
face value.</p>
<p>"We are not ready to call it a huge, dramatic rally, but
you will see better overall performance," said Joseph C.
Bencivenga, director and manager of high-yield research at
Salomon Brothers Inc. He said that while prices were bid
higher for many junk bonds, trading was active in a limited
number of issues.</p>
<p>But Sam DeRosa-Farag, an analyst at First Boston Corp.,
said that technical indicators for junk appear bullish. The
advance-decline ratio, for example, shows marked improvement.
Mr. DeRosa-Farag said that of the 352 junk-bond issues he
followed in the month of June, 4.6 junk bond issues advanced
for each one that declined.</p>
<p>Another sign that sentiment is improving, he said, is that
buying has moved from the "higher quality" junk to
middle-tier and lower-tier bonds.</p>
<p>"The best paper always pops first," Mr. DeRosa-Farag said.
"Then, as sentiment improves, people start to venture down
the capital structure and begin to look at the lower tiers."
Stronger purchases of middle-tier and lower-tier junk bonds
may explain why B-rated junk bonds posted a total return of
8.12% in the second quarter, outperforming junk bonds that
had higher credit ratings.</p>
<p>Top-tier junk bonds, such as those issued by Kroger Co.
and Duracell Inc., have little room for capital appreciation
because they already trade at premiums to their face values.</p>
<p>The turnaround in long-term Treasurys represents yet
another about-face for a market that has shifted gears
several times this year.</p>
<p>Treasury-bond prices fell sharply in January when rising
interest rates around the world pulled bond yields higher.
Treasurys fell further in April on stronger-than-expected
economic data and fears of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>But since May, the market has been rising on growing
speculation that the economy is growing weaker and, more
recently, on optimism that efforts are underway to cut the
size of the U.S. budget deficit. These trends are considered
good for bonds because a weaker economy and smaller deficit
could prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates.</p>
<p>James Kochan, chief fixed-income strategist at Merrill
Lynch, said the factors that fueled the bond market's
rollercoaster performance during the first half of 1990
remain in place. This makes bond-market forecasting extremely
difficult.</p>
<p>"The market begins the second half under the influence of
two opposing forces -- a soft domestic economy that could
prompt Fed easing and booming economies overseas that could
spark central-bank tightening," Mr. Kochan said.</p>
<p>By far the best performers in the second quarter were
zero-coupon bonds. Zeros, which pay no interest and are sold
at a deep discount to face value, racked up a total return of
12.05% in the second quarter, according to First Boston.</p>
<p>Zeros are extremely volatile and their prices tend to
surge when the interest rates fall and plummet when interest
rates rise. The securities are generally three times more
volatile than cash-paying bonds with similar maturities.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>Bond prices ended with gains for the fourth straight
session on growing optimism that the federal budget deficit
will soon be reduced.</p>
<p>The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1/2 point, a
gain of about $5 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The
bond's price was quoted late Friday at a price of 103 23/32
to yield 8.40%.</p>
<p>The bond market began to advance on Tuesday, lifted by
news that President Bush had said that tax revenue increases
are needed to shrink the budget deficit. On Friday, Mr. Bush
reiterated his stance and said that higher taxes are a
"necessary step to get stalled budget negotiations moving."</p>
<p>In the corporate bond market, investment grade bonds ended
1/4 point higher, while junk bonds were little changed.</p>
<p>Among the notable exceptions to the junk market's quiet
tone were the bonds of Stone Container Corp. and Charter
Medical Corp., which posted strong gains, and those of Carter
Hawley Hale Stores Inc., which continued to weaken.</p>
<p>Stone Container's debt securities climbed on news that the
company will use $65 million from the sale of timberland to
repay debt. Stone Container's 11.5% senior subordinated
notes, maturing in 1999, advanced 3/8 point to end at 93 3/8.
The gain in Stone Container bonds comes amid reports that
second-quarter earnings for paper producers will be lower
than year-earlier results.</p>
<p>The bonds of Charter Medical advanced despite a
credit-rating downgrading by Moody's Investors Service Inc.,
which cut Charter Medical's senior debt ratings to single-B-2
from single-B-1, and its subordinated and junior subordinated
debentures to Caa from single-B-3. Charter Medical's 14%
senior subordinated debentures, due in 2000, finished 1/2
point higher at 39.</p>
<p>The junk bonds of Carter Hawley Hale Stores continued to
slip as worries about softer retail sales nagged bondholders.
Carter Hawley Hale's 12.25% senior subordinated notes,
maturing in 1996, fell two points to 84.</p>
