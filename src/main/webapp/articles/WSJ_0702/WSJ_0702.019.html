	<p class="article-leader">Hasbro Inc., citing cautious ordering by retailers and the
close-out of a major toy line, said it expects to report an
earnings skid of more than 50% for the second quarter, on a
10% drop in revenue.
   The gloomy forecast by Hasbro, the nation's leading toy
maker, underscores the general sluggishness in the toy
industry. The continued popularity of video games and growing
sales of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, made by Playmates Toys
Inc., have especially hurt companies that make toys for boys.
And only a couple of major companies that make girls' toys,
Mattel Inc. and Tyco Toys Inc., are expected to post healthy
sales gains.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also, some hot-selling toys have cooled, and retailers
aren't as keen on toys linked to new movies, says Eugene
Gilligan, editor of Playthings, a trade magazine.</p>
<p>The share earnings drop predicted by Hasbro were
especially surprising because analysts had been expecting
flat earnings on a sales increase of perhaps 3%.</p>
<p>Hasbro Chairman Alan G. Hassenfeld said net income
declined to 12 cents to 14 cents a share in the quarter from
$18.2 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
fell to about $270 million from $301.4 million. The second
half "looks more hopeful," he said, although he still expects
Hasbro's 1990 earnings to equal last year's $92.2 million, or
$1.56 a share. Revenue will be "flat or increase modestly,"
compared with $1.41 billion in 1989.</p>
<p>Hasbro, based in Pawtucket, R.I., noticed a conservative
trend in orders beginning in April, with retailers apparently
concerned about stocking too many new and unproven products.
Mr. Hassenfeld also noted that some troubled retailers have
cut back on orders. Ames Department Stores Inc., which filed
for bankruptcy protection in April, purchased about $35
million worth of toys last year from Hasbro. This year,
orders from Ames will be to $2 million to $2.5 million. "It
isn't easy to replace $35 million in revenue just like that,"
Mr. Hassenfeld said.</p>
<p>Contributing to Hasbro's woes are the weakening sales of
two mainstays, G.I. Joe and Transformers. Sales of both have
been hurt by the hot-selling Ninja Turtles: Playmate
officials expect Turtles sales this year to double from last
year's $100 million level. Another disappointment for Hasbro
has been Record Breakers, a line of race cars, which is being
discontinued.</p>
<p>The company said business is down in its Playskool, Milton
Bradley and Hasbro Toys divisions, but that has been offset
in part by double-digit sales increases in its international
division.</p>
<p>On a more optimistic note, Hasbro said two toy lines
introduced in limited quantities this summer are selling
well, World Wrestling Federation figures of professional
wrestlers and Baby Uh-Oh, a doll that dirties its diapers.
Cabbage Patch dolls, purchased by Hasbro last year from
Coleco Industries Inc., are also doing a brisk business. And
the company has high hopes for its long-anticipated New Kids
on the Block dolls, fashioned after members of the popular
rock band.</p>
<p>Things aren't much cheerier for other toy makers. Lewis
Galoob Toys Inc., South San Francisco, Calif., has sputtered
because of slowing sales of Micro Machines, its line of
mini-cars, and other items.</p>
<p>John Taylor, analyst for L.H. Alton & Co., anticipates
Galoob will report a second-quarter loss of about 50 cents a
share on sales of $35 million to $45 million. That compares
to a profit of 45 cents a share on $56.1 million in sales a
year earlier.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor, who had expected Galoob to post a profit of 13
cents a share for the quarter, revised his projection when
told of the growing inventory of Micro Machines in toy
stores. Micro Machines last year accounted for about 70% of
Galoob's sales.</p>
<p>Tonka Corp., Minnetonka, Minn., could report a quarterly
loss of 25 cents to 50 cents a share, predicts Robin Young,
an analyst at John G. Kinnard & Co., vs. a profit of one cent
a share a year ago. Mr. Young thinks Tonka's sales will fall
16% to about $160 million from $189 million.</p>
<p>The decline has come amid Tonka's inability to come up
with hot new toys to replace fading hits like Ghostbusters.
Tonka's total orders as of June 3 had declined 11.6% to $657
million from $743 million a year earlier. Excluding orders
for Sega video games, which the company has stopped
distributing, orders have fallen 7.4% to $651 million from
$703 million.</p>
<p>Two toy firms which expect to post healthy gains for the
quarter make girls' toys, which skirt direct competition with
video games and the Turtles.</p>
<p>Mattel, the Hawthorne, Calif.-based maker of Barbie, will
report second-quarter profit of 40 cents a share, up from 33
cents a year earlier, estimates Barry Rothberg, analyst for
Mabon Nugent & Co. Sales are expected to rise about 20% to
$325 million from $272.3 million, largely because of Barbie's
continued success.</p>
<p>Tyco Toys, Mt. Laurel, N.J., also is gaining sales on the
popularity of three dolls, Oopsie Daisy, My Pretty Ballerina
and Quints. Sales are expected to jump nearly 40% to about
$100 million from $71.7 million in the 1989 second quarter.</p>
<p>But analysts expect Tyco's profits to only equal the 48
cents it posted in last year's second quarter because its
63%-owned Nasta International Inc. unit has forecast a loss
for the year.</p>
<p>Among toy retailers, Toys "R" Us Inc., is the exception.
While many discounters and toy chains have held back on new
orders, Toys "R" Us "hasn't been bashful about building
inventory," notes Dorothy Lakner, analyst for Deutsche Bank
Capital. Ms. Lakner estimates that Toys "R" Us second-quarter
earnings will increase 25% to 10 cents a share from eight
cents a share a year ago, restated for a stock split, on a
sales gain of about 22%.</p>
