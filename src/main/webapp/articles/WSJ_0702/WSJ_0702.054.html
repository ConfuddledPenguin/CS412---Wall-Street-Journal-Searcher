	<p class="article-leader">ROCHESTER, N.Y. -- The former president of North Atlantic
Fisheries Inc. settled a Securities and Exchange Commission
lawsuit accusing him of stealing company funds, falsifying
books and records, and filing false statements with
regulators.
   The case stemmed from allegations by the SEC that Peter
Kolokouris, as president of North Atlantic, committed fraud
in connection with the company's 1985 initial public
offering. In the civil suit filed in federal court in
Rochester, the SEC alleged that Mr. Kolokouris had a secret
ownership interest in the company's underwriter, from which
he received kickbacks.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Kolokouris settled the case without admitting or
denying the allegations. North Atlantic, which processes and
distributes fish, is operating under a temporary receiver
appointed by the federal Judge Michael Telesca in Rochester.</p>
<p>John R. Parrinello, an attorney for Mr. Kolokouris, said,
"It was clear that a settlement was in the best interest of
everybody."</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Mr. Kolokouris turned over $2.1
million in stock in North Atlantic, Flower City Chemicals
Inc., Zorba's Palace Inc. and Rochester Venture Associates
Inc. This amounts to all the stock Mr. Kolokouris owned or
controlled in those companies. He will also resign as an
officer of those companies.</p>
<p>The settlement prohibits Mr. Kolokouris from being an
officer or owning 5% or more of any public company for five
years.</p>
