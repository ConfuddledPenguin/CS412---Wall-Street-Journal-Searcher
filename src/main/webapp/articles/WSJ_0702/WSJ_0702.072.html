	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Treasury Department said it is examining
charges by a former thrift regulator that the government
delayed closing Silverado Bank, Savings & Loan, Denver, until
after the 1988 presidential election because Neil Bush, the
president's son, had been a board member.
   Kermit Mowbray, a former federal regulator in Colorado,
said that in the fall of 1988, his office received a phone
call ordering the regional regulators to delay closing
Silverado until after the November election. Mr. Mowbray, in
testimony before a congressional committee two weeks ago,
said he couldn't remember who made the call or who actually
received it.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Washington S&L regulators have claimed that the huge
number of insolvent S&Ls caused a delay in closing dozens of
thrifts during that time, including Silverado. Losses at
Silverado are expected to total roughly $1 billion.</p>
<p>The Office of Thrift Supervision, which was made an arm of
the Treasury under the S&L cleanup law, last week requested
the Treasury's inspector general to investigate the charges.</p>
<p>Thrift regulators are currently pursuing an administrative
action against Neil Bush, charging that he didn't disclose
his business relationship with several large Silverado
borrowers while he was a director from 1985 to August 1988.
At a news conference last week, President Bush said he has
"full confidence in the integrity and honor of my son."</p>
