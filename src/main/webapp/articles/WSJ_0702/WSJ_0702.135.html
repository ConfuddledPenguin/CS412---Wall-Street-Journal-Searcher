	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japan's wholesale prices in the second 10 days of
June inched up 0.1% from the previous 10 days and rose 0.9%
from a year earlier, because of the yen's decline, the Bank
of Japan, the central bank, said.
   The wholesale price index, in which the year 1985 is equal
to 100, stood at 90.5 in the latest period. Though domestic
prices remained flat from the preceding 10 days, central bank
officials said, export and import prices rose, as a result of
the Japanese currency's depreciation, and pushed up the
overall price level.</p>
