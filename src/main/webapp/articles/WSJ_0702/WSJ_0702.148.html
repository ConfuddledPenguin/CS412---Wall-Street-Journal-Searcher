	<p class="article-leader">Japan Air Lines Co. said its consolidated pretax profits
rose 15% to 59.01 billion yen ($385.7 million) in the fiscal
year ended March 31 from 51.35 billion yen the year earlier.
   Net income, however, fell 12% to 17.68 billion yen from
20.18 billion yen. Per-share net fell to 107.50 yen from
129.05 yen.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Revenues climbed 15% to 1.255 trillion yen from 1.092
trillion yen. JAL said revenues were boosted by the
continuing strength of Japan's economy and the increasing
trend among Japanese to travel abroad.</p>
<p>The company cited a fall in extraordinary profits from
sales of fixed assets and an increase in corporate tax
reserves as reasons for the fall in profits.</p>
<p>For the current fiscal year, JAL sees pretax profits
edging up to 60 billion yen while net income is expected to
recover to 23.5 billion yen. Revenues are expected to rise to
1.305 trillion yen.</p>
