	<p class="article-leader">Your Law column commentary (June 4) about the joint trial
of state and federal cases relating to a common nucleus of
fact in the asbestos litigation highlights the imagination of
the federal and state judges involved and their determination
to resolve complex and expensive-to-litigate cases in as
economic a method as possible.
   Concurrent litigation of related issues is not uncommon,
and you deserve credit for publicizing the method; it is
hoped, other judges will follow suit.</p>
