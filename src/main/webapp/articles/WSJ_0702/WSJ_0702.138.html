	<p class="article-leader">SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Go-Video Inc. said it received the
first shipments of its long-awaited dual-deck videocassette
recorders from the manufacturer, Samsung Electronics Co. of
South Korea.
   Go-Video has received purchase orders for 30,000 of the
VCRs from its distributor, D&H Distributing Co., Harrisburg,
Pa. Go-Video expects to fill those orders before the end of
the year, said R. Terren Dunlap, chairman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The dual-deck VCRs, which allow viewers to duplicate tapes
or play one while recording another, will retail at stores in
the Northwest, mid-Atlantic and Arizona, including Sharper
Image and Hammacher Schlemmer. At Hammacher Schlemmer, the
VCR will retail for $1,295 and have a five-year warranty.</p>
<p>Go-Video acquired the technology for its VCR by taking a
group of Asian electronics companies to court two years ago,
charging that they refused to sell it the technology to make
the decks. Samsung was dismissed as a defendant in that case
after it agreed to make Go-Video's patented dual-deck
recorder. Litigation in that case is continuing against
several other manufacturers, and Go-Video filed a second suit
against the companies in January, alleging that they have
monopolized the entire consumer-electronics business. The
defendants include Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. and its
Panasonic unit, Victor Co. and its U.S. JVC Corp. unit, Sony
Corp., NEC Corp., Sharp Corp. and Sanyo Electric Co.</p>
