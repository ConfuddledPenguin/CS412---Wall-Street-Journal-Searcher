	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- After recently saying that its discovery of
a glitch in accounting for zero-coupon bonds sold to Mexico
had caused an immediate jump of $27 billion in debt subject
to the federal debt ceiling, the Treasury has concluded that
there was no glitch.
   A Treasury spokesman, acknowledging "some confusion" in
statutory interpretation, said the department's lawyers have
now determined the initial interpretation was the correct
one. The ruling involved $30 billion in zero-coupons bonds
sold to Mexico earlier this year to help that country
alleviate its debt problem.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The latest shift, however, doesn't alter the Treasury's
need for an increase in its current $3.12 trillion debt limit
before Congress starts its scheduled August recess. Without
an increase before the recess, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady warned Congress in a recent letter, "it is highly
likely that default would occur before Congress returns in
September."</p>
<p>Mr. Brady stressed that debt ceilings estimates are
subject to greater-than-usual uncertainty now because the
Resolution Trust Corp. is borrowing working capital from the
Federal Financing Bank, an entity within Treasury. His letter
didn't mention the zero-coupon bonds.</p>
