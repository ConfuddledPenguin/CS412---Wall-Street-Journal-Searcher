	<h3>Abreast of the Market: Growth-Stock Managers See New Gains --- `Value' Investors Have Other Ideas</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Growth was golden in the first half of 1990.
   The growth-stock managers who are having a stupendous year
with stocks such as Compaq Computer, Merry-Go-Round
Enterprises and Home Depot -- all up more than 20% in the
second quarter -- predict more of the same in the second
half.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Not so, protest the "value" investors, whose hunt for
bargain-priced stocks has saddled them with sizable holdings
of lagging bank, auto and basic materials issues. They
predict a sharp second-half advance for shares of companies
whose fortunes are linked to the economic cycle.</p>
<p>Who's right will depend largely on which way the economy
swings. Right now, investors and economists are divided over
whether economic growth will speed up or slow further.
Polarized thinking on this topic is one reason why the Dow
Jones Industrial Average has drifted between 2850 and 2900
over the past two weeks.</p>
<p>But scanning the list of winning stocks and industry
groups leaves little doubt about the dominant investment
theme so far this year. "The thing that's driving the stock
market right now is earnings momentum," says Byron Wien,
chief U.S. investment strategist for Morgan Stanley. "What's
not driving the market is value."</p>
<p>The software, communications and semiconductor industry
groups are full of companies growing earnings at 15% a year
or better. Winning stocks such as Storage Technology, up
189.4% so far this year, have impressed investors with their
unique products, dominant market shares and their leap-frog
earnings advances in a time of slowing economic growth.</p>
<p>But value investors, who specialize in sniffing out stocks
trading at discounts to their worth, say the game isn't over
yet.</p>
<p>"There is more than one way to skin a cat in this market,"
says Mr. Wien. "Everybody is focusing on growth stocks, but
an investor could make it in cyclical stocks, too." Mr. Wien
is a growth stock enthusiast, but he also has one third of
his portfolio dedicated to economically sensitive issues,
such as Ford and Fluor.</p>
<p>No doubt, cyclical stocks are cheap, a sign that most
investors expect more slow economic growth. Aluminum Co. of
America, for example, is trading at a ratio of price to
per-share earnings of about 7, compared with 16.52 for
Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.</p>
<p>But "if the economy picks up, cyclical stocks will do
better than the growth stocks," says value investor Paul
Lesutis, a director at Provident Capital Management.</p>
<p>Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. economist Giulio Martini
expects the economy to snap back with 4.5% growth in the
second half of this year from about 2% in the first half,
with much of strength coming from a rebuilding of inventories
by all kinds of companies, such as auto and chemical
manufacturers.</p>
<p>"When the economy turns out to be stronger, the
underestimation of earnings will be greatest for those
companies that are sensitive to the economy," Mr. Martini
says.</p>
<p>First-half weakness was related to inventory liquidations,
Mr. Martini argues. "Once you get stimulation on the
production side, you will have more income creating more
consumer spending," he says. He expects the unemployment rate
to drop to 4.3% a year from now compared with slighty more
than 5% currently, and inflation to rise to more than 6% from
about 5% currently. The Federal Reserve could even raise
interest rates later this summer, Mr. Martini predicts.</p>
<p>Some investors are already second-guessing growth stocks,
not so much because of their investment style but because
these stocks may not meet their high earnings expectations.
At the end of the second quarter, money managers showed a
preference for stocks such as Procter & Gamble that are
indeed growth companies but are less prone to negative
earnings surprises.</p>
<p>The rotation in leadership of stocks in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average tells the story best. Procter & Gamble and
Merck, two blue-chip consumer stocks, accounted for 22.1% and
19.7%, respectively, of the Dow industrials' 173.48-point
gain in the second quarter, according to Birinyi Associates,
a stock research firm. But for the first half, technology
bellwether International Business Machines accounted for
37.1% of the Dow industrials' 127.49-point gain, Birinyi
says.</p>
<p>"The market is terrified of earnings disappointments
currently," says Kent Simons, general partner and fund
manager at Neuberger & Berman, which is why "investors are
running to Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo, Coca-Cola Co. and
McDonald's."</p>
<p>Mr. Simons and his partner Larry Marx say that many growth
stocks -- be they technology or consumer issues -- are so
expensive that they are now riskier than some of the shares
of basic industrial companies that aren't growing earnings as
fast. "There is earnings risk in Alcoa, but it is arguable
that there is more risk in the price of Johnson & Johnson"
because earnings expectations for the drug stock are high,
says Mr. Marx.</p>
<p>Growth stock investors expect slow economic growth, a mild
drop in interest rates and declining inflation this year.
Lower interest rates will make bonds less competitive,
enhancing the relative appeal to investors of the high-growth
companies -- especially if the earnings of cyclical companies
deteriorate further.</p>
<p>Michael Strauss, chief economist for UBS Securities,
expects the economy to slow to such an extent that bonds will
be a better investment than stocks.</p>
<p>"In the second half we will get a major slowdown in
consumer spending," he predicts. Mr. Strauss foresees the
economy growing at less than 1.5% in the second half. He
expects unemployment to rise, weak sales, and, naturally,
poor corporate profits. Mr. Strauss says the consumer has
lost his punch. And the performance of some retail stocks
recently shows those fears. J.C. Penney was down 11.5% last
quarter to 60 5/8.</p>
<p>But it is precisely in such an economic environment that
companies with dominant products continue to earn more than
concerns subject to the economic cycle. "I continue to
believe they (growth stocks) will maintain leadership," says
Michael Schonberg, a growth stock investor and managing
director at Chase Investors Management Corp.</p>
<p>Mr. Wien of Morgan Stanley says the debate between the
growth stock managers and the value investors will be settled
this summer. Meanwhile, investors should fasten their seat
belts because changes in sentiment are likely to be
explosive.</p>
<p>"Precarious balances don't endure forever," says Mr. Wien
in a recent report. "The factors producing the standoff are
too powerful. Something will change."</p>

<p>Friday's Market Activity</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average edged 1.98 points higher
