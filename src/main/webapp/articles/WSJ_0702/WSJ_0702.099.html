	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- When it comes to underwriting stocks and
bonds, more is less these days on Wall Street.
   Despite a rising volume of new issues, securities firms'
underwriting profits in the first half plunged to their
lowest level in five years. Fees that firms earned from
underwriting new securities so far this year amounted to a
paltry $1.2 billion, according to Securities Data Co. That's
down 17% from a year earlier -- even though the volume of new
issues actually rose 13% in the same period.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The reason is that Wall Street firms are making less than
ever on each stock or bond issue they help bring to market.
The fee that securities firms raked in for each issue -- an
average of $399,000 -- is down 44% from a year earlier. In
1985, the last time total underwriting fees were so lean,
Wall Street firms made an average of $1.1 million an issue,
Securities Data says.</p>
<p>"This is just a dramatic drop-off," says Francine Wissak,
a Securities Data analyst. The shrinking fees per issue
should throw cold water on "anyone who says they're doing
deals and making money and that things are coming back to
normal levels," Ms. Wissak says.</p>
<p>The deepening slump in underwriting profits is likely to
lead Wall Street firms to cut staffs further and pay many of
the remaining employees less, some industry executives argue.
Even as underwriting fees slump to five-year lows, salaries
remain far above 1985 levels.</p>
<p>"We've got to be more rational on compensation," says
Robert Downey, a partner at Goldman, Sachs & Co. and chairman
of the Securities Industry Association, a trade group. Wall
Streeters "can have damn good careers," Mr. Downey says, "but
they're not going to have instant gratification."</p>
<p>The end of Wall Street's fat-fee era reflects the collapse
of the junk-bond market, once a big money maker for
investment banks. Just seven new junk-bond issues were
brought to market in this year's first half, with fees
totaling a mere $16.2 million. This is down from $462.4
million in fees for 69 issues a year earlier, Securities Data
says. Throughout the late 1980s, junk bond fees averaged $450
million every six months.</p>
<p>Despite lower fees paid by issuers, some securities
executives maintain that underwriting profitability has
rebounded in other areas. They say that's partly because
firms are widening the underwriting "spread," or the
difference between the price a securities firm pays to buy an
issue of stock or bonds from the issuing company and the
slightly higher price the firm charges investors.</p>
<p>"In the past, much of the spread has been given up to the
investor, and investment bankers haven't kept it," says Roger
Vasey, senior vice president of Merrill Lynch & Co.'s global
debt markets division. "Now the trend is in favor of
retaining a bigger percentage of the spread on deals,
although we're working harder for it."</p>
<p>Still, there's currently nothing in Wall Street's hopper
to replace the once-lush revenue flowing from high-yield junk
bonds. For instance, the hottest area of the underwriting
landscape right now -- mortgage and asset-backed securities
-- generates razor-thin fees for securities firms, industry
executives say.</p>
<p>One area that's making up ground is fees from underwriting
issues of common -- both initial public offerings and issues
by companies with stock outstanding. With the stock market
rising to near-record levels and many companies trying to
reduce debt levels by selling equity, fees earned from
underwriting stocks surged 35% to $709.3 million in the first
half, Securities Data says.</p>
<p>Some analysts expect the stock resurgence to continue. "As
companies de-leverage going into the '90s, you should have
more issuance of stock to strengthen {the companies'} capital
structures," says James Hanbury, an analyst at Wertheim
Schroder & Co.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was swept up by the rising equity tide.
Goldman ranked No. 2 in total underwriting fees for stocks
and bonds for the six months, earning $171.7 million in fees,
nearly two-thirds of it from stock issues. Merrill Lynch,
with $172.6 million in fees, remained on top, underwriting 29
more stock or debt issues than Goldman.</p>
<p>Initial public stock offerings, although not booming,
continued to rake in the fees. Securities firms' fees from
IPOs totaled $457 million, a 15% jump from $396 million in
the first half of 1989. Although IPOs account for 40% of all
underwriting fees, they're still far below the levels seen
just a few years back. In 1986's fourth quarter alone, IPOs
generated $541 million in fees for Wall Street, surpassing
this year's entire first-half level.</p>
<p>Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., helped by heavy IPO volume,
jumped to the No. 3 fee spot for total underwriting fees. The
Baltimore-based brokerage firm earned $114.3 million in fees
through 22 offerings -- a big jump from its $63.9 million and
its No. 9 ranking in last year's first half. Much of the
increase stems from a threefold jump in IPOs underwritten by
Alex. Brown.</p>
<p>"The markets have been more receptive," says Richard
Franyo, an Alex. Brown managing director. "But you've got to
be a bit worried that as the markets get a little overcooked,
it could end."</p>
<p>Salomon Brothers Inc. ranked No. 4, posting a 65% jump in
underwriting fees for the period. But First Boston Corp. and
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. lost ground. First Boston, which
has shied away from the junk market recently, made just $89.5
million in total underwriting fees, down 22% from a year
earlier. Shearson Lehman slipped to the No. 8 spot from No.
5, earning $78.6 million. Shearson was hurt in part by
uncertainty stemming from the firm's well-publicized
financial and management turmoil.</p>
<p>Missing in action is Wall Street's fee leader for 1989's
first half. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. earned $260 million
from underwritings, with junk bonds accounting for 94% of its
fee total. Of course, Drexel is out of the picture now; its
parent company filed for bankruptcy-law protection in
February after a cash crunch caused by the collapse of the
junk-bond market.</p>
