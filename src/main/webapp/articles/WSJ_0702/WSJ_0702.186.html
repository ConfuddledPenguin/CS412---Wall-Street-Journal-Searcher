	<p class="article-leader">A San Antonio, Texas, television reporter, jailed last
week for refusing to name confidential sources, is "bothered
most" that he was incarcerated even after authorities
determined his notes wouldn't affect the outcome of a murder
case he was covering.
   Brian Karem, a 29-year-old reporter with KMOL-TV, started
a six-month sentence Wednesday following a round of appeals
and a petition to the U.S. Supreme Court. He was charged with
contempt last year when he refused to give the names of three
people who helped arrange a telephone interview with accused
killer Henry David Hernandez in the county jail regarding the
shooting death of a San Antonio policeman.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I made a promise" to protect the sources' identity, Mr.
Karem said from the same county jail. "I intend to keep that
promise."</p>
<p>A wide array of players -- attorneys, journalists, media
critics and others -- hope the case will force the courts to
clarify the murky area of First Amendment law surrounding
journalistic privilege. The U.S. Supreme Court case most
often cited is ambiguous on this point and is nearly 20 years
old.</p>
<p>"The law from the U.S. Supreme Court has been less than
clear on this for a number of years," said John H. McElhaney,
an attorney whose media clients include the Dallas Morning
News and WFAA-TV in Dallas, both A.H. Belo Corp. properties.
"It is not in the public's interest to tie up reporters in
every . . . case," he said.</p>
<p>The federal magistrate who reviewed Mr. Karem's case, John
W. Primomo, said in an interview that "the law in this area
is not well-established." The magistrate, after a closed
hearing with Mr. Karem and his attorney, determined that the
journalist's notes "would not be important" in prosecuting or
defending Mr. Hernandez and his brother Julian, who was also
charged with the murder of Officer Gary Williams in March
1989. That has been enough to prompt some federal courts to
forgo pursuing contempt charges against journalists.</p>
<p>But the magistrate said he also found that, while there
might be journalistic privilege in civil cases, "there is no
reporter privilege to withhold information in a criminal case
where the interests of the state in prosecuting and the
interest of the defendant outweigh the interest of the
reporter."</p>
<p>Defense and prosecuting attorneys in the murder case had
clamored for Mr. Karem's notes, claiming the identities of
the intermediaries who helped set up the Hernandez interview
might affect the outcome of the case. Those lawyers weren't
immediately available to comment late yesterday.</p>
<p>The journalist handed over transcripts of the interview,
the news segment that aired and raw footage that didn't, but
he wouldn't give up the notes, saying to do so would make him
"nothing more than another investigative arm for law
enforcement" and make future sources clam up. Two of the
three sources have since been identified without Mr. Karem's
assistance, but the third hasn't come forward.</p>
<p>If the source does speak up, Mr. Karem will be freed.
Meanwhile, the contempt charge has been appealed to a federal
appeals court in New Orleans. Mr. Karem's attorney had asked
the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the charge until that appeal
is heard, but the high court refused, and the journalist had
to start serving the sentence.</p>
<p>The reporter "has an abrasive personality and angers
people profoundly," said Forrest Carr, managing editor of Mr.
Karem's station. "But regardless of what you think of his
personality, you have to believe in what he's fighting for,"
he said. "We're 100% behind Brian."</p>
