	<p class="article-leader">Dense-Pac Microsystems Inc. lowered by as much as 30% its
sales forecast for its current fiscal year ending Feb. 1991
to between $7 million and $8 million. The company cited a
slowdown in orders in its defense-related and commercial
businesses.
   "Many defense contractors are playing conservative and
waiting for (government) funding until they release orders,"
said Bill Stowell, Dense-Pac's chief financial officer.
Defense contractors account for roughly 75% of sales for
Garden Grove, Calif.-based Dense-Pac, which designs and makes
memory components used in advanced-technology systems such as
aircraft, missiles and communications equipment.</p>

orders were weak last month, the company said.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year ended Feb. 28, 1990, Dense-Pac posted
a net loss of $183,599, equal to five cents a share, on sales
of $7.1 million. The company didn't make a bottom-line
forecast for the current fiscal year.</p>
