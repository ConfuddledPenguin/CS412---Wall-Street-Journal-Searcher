	<p class="article-leader">Much has been written about the democratic implications of
employee ownership and self-management. Less effort has gone
into tracking the actual financial and structural condition
of an enterprise once control has been exercised by its
employees. And even less research has been spent on employee
ownership in those instances where employees are organized
and controlled by national unions.
   As investors ponder the financing of the takeover of
United Airlines by the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA),
the International Association of Machinists (IAM), and the
Airline Flight Attendants (AFA), they would do well to take a
closer look at what union management has already cost this
once-invincible airline.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>If the unions are successful, the employees will indeed
own United, and will gain from improvements in profits that
result. United will, however, be controlled by the union
leadership, despite the appointment of Chrysler's former No.
2 man, Gerald Greenwald, as the chief executive if the
buy-out succeeds. While Mr. Greenwald certainly is qualified
for the position, his experience in union negotiations seemed
to be paramount in his appointment. Thus, key decisions may
be made on a political basis rather than on a long-range
economic basis, because union officials must make re-election
their prime objective.</p>
<p>To be sure, Mr. Greenwald will strive for a sound
management approach and there will be "independents" on the
company board. But like Mr. Greenwald, they will be chosen by
the unions. Management personnel at United clearly understand
that being in the unions' good graces will help them hold
their jobs, and any "independent" manager or board member
will surely understand this too. But does all this
decision-making power really affect the company's bottomline?</p>
<p>The pitfalls of union decision making at United are well
illustrated by the failed Frontier Airlines deal. United
could have acquired this regional airline in 1986. But it
needed to maintain Frontier pilots' lower wages for five
years to make the deal profitable. The pilots union nixed
this proposed acquisition by refusing a wage deal, despite
the wishes of Frontier pilots whose jobs were at stake, and
despite the fact that the deal would have given United
control of Denver, plus valuable planes, gates and hangars.</p>
<p>Here, ALPA stunted United's growth, and the airline
slipped behind American -- now No. 1 in the industry. And
when Frontier ultimately was taken over by Continental, its
pilots were forced to work for much lower wages. The probable
reason for ALPA's intransigence: A merger of United with
Frontier would have added millions to the cost of ALPA taking
over control of United. This kind of decision making -- plus
the sale of Covia, United's extremely valuable computer
reservations system, to help finance the buy-out -- will
likely lead to a further loss of market share.</p>
<p>The democratic element of employee ownership is not always
apparent when union power and management control are
concentrated in the same hands. This also was illustrated by
ALPA's proposed United takeover agreement. The agreement
reduces the seniority ranking of the pilots who were hired
during its 1985 strike against United (or who crossed its
picket line). After the strike, ALPA attempted to have pilot
trainees, who were not on the payroll during the strike,
placed ahead on the seniority list of those who had worked
during the strike. The courts struck this down.</p>
<p>The proposed machinists union agreement also exhibits
unbridled union power. It sets terms and conditions for
nonunion employees, for whom the IAM has no legal right to
bargain. Most startling and sad is that the IAM deal gives
this union carte blanche to organize the thousands of
United's nonunion clerical and reservations employees who
have steadfastly remained nonunion and supported management.
Unionization of this group will certainly not reduce costs.
More significant is the desertion by current management of
the employees who have supported it over the years. Such a
deal is a clear demonstration of management subservience to
union power.</p>
<p>The unions have made much of their "concessions" as proof
that the takeover financing would be viable. But a close look
questions that claim.</p>
<p>Each of the proposed contracts of the three unions are for
five-year periods, and promise no strikes. For most
employees, these contracts establish "book" wage increases of
4% a year, and then make "concessions" by providing wage
increases of 2% a year compounded. Also included are a
probable restoration of the fourth- and fifth-year book rates
in lump-sum form, and the right to negotiate -- or send to
arbitration -- proposals for higher increases.</p>
<p>These vaunted "concessions" are in fact guaranteed wage
increases, regardless of business conditions for airline
employees whose compensation averages 65% above the industry
generally. The takeover will thus be saddled with
ever-increasing wage costs, which cast some doubt on the
takeover's viability.</p>
<p>Thus, while employee ownership and self-management may
make sense in certain instances, the concept should not be
glamorized to the point where all forms are blindly accepted
as being more "democratic" and making economic sense. When
union power and management control are concentrated in the
same hands, the result, as may soon be demonstrated in the
UAL deal, is likely to lead neither to fiscal responsibility
nor to more democratic participation by individual workers.</p>
