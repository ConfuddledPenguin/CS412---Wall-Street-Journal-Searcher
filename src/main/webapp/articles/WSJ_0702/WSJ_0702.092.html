	<p class="article-leader">EAST BERLIN -- The West German mark replaced East
Germany's flimsy currency yesterday, and Rolf Bittighoefer
said he still had to pinch himself to fathom it all.
   Sipping a $4 glass of champagne at one of East Berlin's
best hotels to celebrate, Mr. Bittighoefer recalled his years
as a border guard in the late 1970s, with orders to shoot on
sight anybody trying to flee to the West. A West German guard
on the other side of a fortified fence once patted his pistol
and said he had a special bullet reserved for him.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"I'm glad I wound up with his money instead," Mr.
Bittighoefer said. After finishing his champagne, he said, he
would return to the drugstore he opened last month and stock
his shelves with merchandise he bought on credit from West
German distributors. For the first time, his customers will
have to pay in West German marks. "Will it work?" he asked.
"It has to work."</p>
<p>Monetary union -- or "Day X," as it is known here -- took
months to prepare. Billions of West German marks had to be
brought over to furnish East Germany's 16 million people with
their new currency, a high-cost and risky operation that is
about to jolt East Germany's economy to the core.</p>
<p>For all practical purposes, Germany reunified over the
weekend. Having lost its currency and surrendered control
over its finances and social-security system, East Germany
ceased to exist as a sovereign state. "People know that as of
Monday, the music plays in Bonn," observed a senior West
German Foreign Ministry official. "That is where the budget
decisions will be made, and all other important decisions."</p>
<p>In a nationally televised address last night, West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised that wealthy West Germany
will do everything it can to help ease East Germany back on
its feet, but that the process won't be easy for all. "The
citizens of the Federal Republic and the DDR are now
irrevocably linked," he said. "We have waited for this for 40
years."</p>
<p>Although many West Germans grumble about the cost of
unity, the arrival of the West German mark and rescue
programs didn't come a moment too soon for East Germany's
rapidly deteriorating economy. East Germany's former system
of central planning has disappeared as quickly as the
Communist regime that controlled it for four decades.</p>
<p>Many East German officials are adjusting quickly. Edgar
Most, former vice president of the Staatsbank, East Germany's
monolithic central bank, shrugged as he explained his own
whirlwind transition from Communist administrator to
arch-capitalist after signing on as board member of Deutsche
Bank AG's fast-growing joint venture in East Germany. "There
were no longer any other alternatives," said the 50-year-old
Mr. Most. "Our first task was to survive."</p>
<p>Yet, at least for a day, fears of economic crisis and mass
unemployment faded as East Germans celebrated in scenes
reminiscent of the night the Berlin Wall was opened in
November.</p>
<p>On Saturday night, 10,000 people counted down the minutes
to monetary union in East Berlin's huge Alexanderplatz
square. At midnight cheers went up and the midnight sky
filled with fireworks as groups of revelers popped champagne
corks. Many of them sang the West German national anthem and
chanted "Germany, United Fatherland."</p>
<p>At one point, a milling crowd of several hundred was
waiting outside an Alexanderplatz savings bank in the
mistaken belief they could begin drawing their West German
marks there after midnight. A megaphone crackled from the
fringe of the crowd. "Attention] Attention] This is the
People's Police," a voice boomed, to jeers and whistles. But
the crowd fell silent when it went on : "If you want your
money, go across the street to the Deutsche Bank." In an
instant the throng wheeled and surged toward the new Deutsche
Bank branch across the square, joining the crush of several
hundred already waiting to get in.</p>
<p>Rainer Grossimlinghaus, the manager of Deutsche Bank's new
Spittel market branch in East Berlin, couldn't sleep Saturday
night. He arrived at the bank at 6:30 a.m. Sunday to find a
queue of people 60 yards long waiting patiently outside for
the door to open.</p>
<p>"We were very busy for a while, but all went very
smoothly," he said. Most came merely to make a quick currency
exchange, but about a dozen paused long enough to open the
branch's first accounts.</p>
<p>Working behind the counter was Regina Buthut, a former
Staatsbank employee who underwent four month of intensive
retraining in Western retail banking at one of Deutsche
Bank's West Berlin branches.</p>
<p>"It's really like the hour zero," she said. "Everybody is
staring reality in the face."</p>
