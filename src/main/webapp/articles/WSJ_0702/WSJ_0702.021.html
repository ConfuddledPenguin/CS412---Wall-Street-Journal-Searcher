	<p class="article-leader">Pat Fallon, whose ad agency created it, calls it among the
most "ripped-off campaigns in the history of the business."
He isn't far from wrong.
   A radio station, a car company and a handful of magazines
all have copied the campaign. So have a graphics house, an
electronics company and one of the Baby Bells.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In all, well over a dozen recent campaigns look awfully
familiar. In fact, at first glance they look almost exactly
like the "Perception/Reality" ad campaign that Mr. Fallon's
Minneapolis ad agency, Fallon McElligott, first created for
Rolling Stone magazine five years ago. That long-running
campaign pairs people's "perception" of the magazine -- a
picture of a hippy, a pig or a pair of granny glasses -- with
the "reality" -- a photo of a yuppie, a policeman or a pair
of Ray Bans.</p>
<p>For a "creative" industry, the ad business sure doesn't
seem too long on originality. Just as prime-time television
seems to endlessly reproduce itself, with one season
chock-full of detective shows and the next crammed with legal
dramas, the ad business can't get enough of a good thing. A
few years ago, every other TV commercial seemed to be filmed
in that black-and-white, shaky-camera style popularized by
director Leslie Dektor. In print, the one to follow is
clearly Rolling Stone.</p>
<p>Not that anyone admits to copying the distinctive-looking
ad. Consider a current Field & Stream magazine ad picturing a
pair of Cole-Haan yuppie loafers on one side and a pair of
Wolverine duck boots on the other. The ad "is trying to
change a perception" that all the magazine's readers are "low
income, low education, low interest," says Steve Crane of
Perri, Debes, Looney & Crane, the Rochester, N.Y., ad agency
that created it.</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Crane is quick to add, "We didn't set out to knock
off `Perception/Reality.' It definitely isn't derivative, as
much as it may look that way."</p>
<p>The "Perception/Reality" format has spread to almost every
other conceivable product, too. A graphics design firm in
California copied the ad almost exactly, noting in the fine
print that it is perceived as "only a stat house. In reality,
it is the one place where you can go for all your graphic
needs." A Los Angeles radio station ad shows a pair of
sneakers on the left and a pair of ladies' pumps on the right
to prove that, contrary to perception, "working women love"
the station.</p>
<p>Bill Miller, the Fallon copywriter who helped originate
the campaign, says he runs across at least one new knockoff a
month. Some don't copy the "Perception/Reality" line
outright, but look suspiciously similar anyway, including
current ads from Bell Atlantic Yellow pages and Siemens, the
big electronics firm. Spokesmen at both say that despite the
perception, the reality is that they didn't ape the Rolling
Stone campaign on purpose.</p>
<p>Some ads, on the other hand, have quite intentionally been
copycats. Volkswagen actually received permission from
Rolling Stone for its "Perception/Reality" ad showing a '60s
Bug on one page vs. VW's current lineup on the other. But
Soap Opera Digest was slapped with a "cease and desist"
letter when it tried a similar parody, without permission, in
1988. Its ad looked exactly like Rolling Stone's
"Perception/Reality" campaign -- but under both captions, it
showed the same frumpy housewife pushing a grocery cart with
fat kids in tow.</p>
<p>Rolling Stone has sent a handful of warning letters to
other pretenders, but has yet to take further legal steps.
Felix Kent, Fallon's New York lawyer, says the ads now
include a copyright notice but enforcement is difficult. "No
one has an exclusive right to a concept," he says, adding,
"Whenever you have a successful campaign, others try to rip
it off."</p>
<p>"I hope {the knockoffs} remind everyone of the original,"
shrugs Jann Wenner, Rolling Stone's publisher. And Mr. Fallon
notes practically, "We've had so many things ripped off that
it would take an entire department to follow up on it, and
I'd prefer running an advertising agency. It isn't worth the
effort."</p>

<p>JWT Wins Nuprin</p>
<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. awarded its estimated $30 million
Nuprin pain reliever account to J. Walter Thompson.</p>
<p>The hotly contested account was put up for review earlier
this month after several years of disappointing sales. Grey
Advertising, which had handled the account since the brand's
introduction in 1984, also participated in the review, as did
Ogilvy & Mather and several other agencies. Grey had created
the "Little, yellow, different" campaign for Nuprin.</p>
<p>Thompson, a unit of WPP Group, has handled advertising for
Gerber Baby Formula, a joint venture between Bristol-Myers
and Gerber Products Co., since February 1989. The agency has
won several new accounts this year, including Toys "R" Us,
The Wall Street Journal and Premier Cruise Lines.</p>
<p>Grey continues to handle a number of other Bristol-Myers
Squibb brands, including Miss Clairol, Clairesse, Ultress,
Windex, Drano and 4-Way cold products.</p>

<p>Ad Notes. . . .</p>
<p>CHEMLAWN SETTLES: ChemLawn Services Corp. settled a
lawsuit with New York state regarding pesticide safety claims
it made in brochures. Under the settlement, ChemLawn, a big
lawn-care company and a unit of Ecolab Inc., agreed to pay
the state $100,000 in costs and not to make certain claims.
In one of the disputed claims, ChemLawn compared the toxicity
of treated lawn clippings to baby aspirin. ChemLawn said it
hadn't made the claims since 1987, a contention disputed by
the attorney general's office.</p>
<p>WHO'S NEWS: Dale P. Brown was named president and chief
executive officer of Sive Associates, a Cincinnati marketing
unit of Young & Rubicam. Ms. Brown, previously an executive
vice president at the Martin Agency, succeeds Jack Thinnes,
who will leave Sive to take on new responsibilities at Y&R
Advertising.</p>
<p>CBS-K MART: CBS announced details of its second fall
promotion with K mart. It said other sponsors involved in the
tie-in this year will include MasterCard International, Isuzu
and Pepsi.</p>
