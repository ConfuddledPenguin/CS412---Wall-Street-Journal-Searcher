	<p class="article-leader">TOKYO -- Japanese housing starts in May surged 8.4% from a
year earlier, after a large increase in construction of
private houses, the Construction Ministry said.
   A ministry official attributed the jump in starts of
single-unit dwellings to demand pent up since winter, when
construction was discouraged by fears of an interestrate
spiral in Japan.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Overall housing starts totaled 146,627 units in May.
Starts of private single-unit houses rose 10% from a year
earlier to 48,629 units.</p>
<p>The weakness of the yen forced the Bank of Japan, the
central bank, to raise its official discount rate half a
percentage point December and a full point in March, bringing
it to its current level of 5.25%. The discount rate is the
interest rate charged on loans to financial institutions. The
increases didn't have immediate effects on the yen's exchange
rate, leading to speculation that further rate boosts could
be ahead.</p>
<p>The yen and bond prices strengthened in May, though the
currency remained weak, compared with levels in 1989, and its
stability helped dispel fears of another immediate increase
in base interest rates.</p>
<p>New confidence that interest rates wouldn't rise released
several months of pent-up demand for private housing, a
ministry official said.</p>
<p>New housing starts increased 0.5% in April, and declined
2% in March, compared with year-earlier levels.</p>
<p>A large number of renovations that got under way in May
added to the growth in private-housing starts, the official
said.</p>
<p>Growth in starts of new rental housing was lower, at 5.3%.
Starts totaled 66,739 units. A total of 28,436 units in
multifamily dwellings began construction in May, up 9.1%.</p>
<p>Starts of company housing continued to be strong in May,
reflecting Japan's tight labor market. Construction began on
2,823 units of corporate housing, up 59%. Companies are being
forced to offer greater benefits to workers, including
housing, to prevent them from switching jobs.</p>
<p>The ministry expects growth in housing starts to remain
strong in the months ahead, but to decline from May's high
levels, the official said. Release of the backed-up demand
for housing will spell more moderate increases, he said. en</p>
