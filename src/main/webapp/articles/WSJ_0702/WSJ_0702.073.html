	<p class="article-leader">In your May 30 page-one article "Seeds of Change: Farmers,
Eying Costs and the Environment, Limit Use of Chemicals" you
are generally on the mark with the conclusions that farmers
are trying to apply fertilizer and chemicals more
effectively.
   There has been a great deal of emphasis on the appropriate
application rate of fertilizer, particularly nitrogen
fertilizers, that may lead to high nitrate levels in the
water supply if applied indiscriminately. However, your
suggestion that fertilizer use per acre on corn dropped 8%
last year due to this phenomenon is subject to other
interpretation. For example, the drought in 1988 reduced
yields and fertilizer uptake in many areas. As a result,
there was a substantial amount of fertilizer carry-over from
1988 to 1989, the most likely reason farmers applied less
fertilizer in 1989. This may also be the reason some farmers
were able to slash their fertilizer use substantially and
still obtain high yields.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>I also take exception to the statement that "many farmers
were afraid of putting something into the ground that could
knock them dead if they inhaled it," in reference to
anhydrous ammonia. Having applied anhydrous ammonia
fertilizer on many acres as a young man, I can assure you
that inhaling it does not knock anybody dead. If it did, this
is a ghost composing this letter. As with other gases, if it
is in such heavy concentration that it replaces the oxygen,
one could be asphyxiated from the lack of oxygen.</p>
