	<p class="article-leader">DETROIT -- Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp.
followed Ford Motor Co.'s lead in an unusual midyear price
increase on most of their cars and some trucks.
   The Big Three auto makers rarely lift prices in midyear.
The last time GM did so was 1986. But the moves, in response
to Ford's action on June 18, reflect a desire by the Big
Three to increase revenues hurt by weak sales and to mitigate
possible "sticker-shock" when they announce prices on this
fall's 1991 models. When 1990 models debuted last year, their
far-higher sticker prices drove many buyers away, causing a
longlasting sales slump.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>GM, Ford and Chrysler also were emboldened to raise prices
because their stocks of unsold cars are far leaner this year
than last year as they head into summer and the end of the
1990 model year. GM dealers, for example, had a 62-day supply
of unsold cars at the end of May compared with a 72-day
supply a year earlier. Chrysler had a low 56-day supply,
compared with a 67-day supply.</p>
<p>Still, Chrysler has struggled with slow sales this year,
causing some dealers to worry about the $60 to $160 price
increases Chrysler announced Friday on most of its cars and
some trucks. The No. 3 auto maker also raised destination
charges on some of its vehicles by $15 or $30. Chrysler said
it was taking the step because of "increased operating and
product costs."</p>
<p>GM also is raising prices on a variety of vehicles by $66
to $369. In addition, GM is raising destination charges for
all cars and trucks by $10. GM said it made the moves to
"partially offset higher raw materials, labor and health
costs."</p>
<p>GM officials said the company's prices overall rose an
average of $83 a vehicle, or five-tenths of one percent.
Chrysler didn't provide an overall average increase.</p>
<p>The Chrysler and GM increases are effective today. Ford's
price hikes ranged from $58 to $134 on many cars and trucks.</p>
<p>Even though the increases might seem modest, some Chrysler
dealers fear any boost could scare away marginal buyers.
That's something Chrysler can ill afford because its combined
car and truck sales through May were off 14.8% from a year
ago, while its share of the U.S. car market for May dropped
to 9.7% from 10.9%.</p>
<p>But May was still an improvement over April's 7.8% share.
Analysts said the uptick gave Chrysler a window of
opportunity to generate more revenue. "Chrysler's share among
domestic car makers has bounced back recently and there
hasn't been that much deterioration in sales, so they thought
they could get away with a slight increase," said David
Healy, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd investment
banking arm of Barclays Group.</p>
<p>Chrysler said its smallest increase of $60 comes on the
Dodge Daytona, which started at $9,745, and on most Chrysler
LeBaron models. The $160 boost affects Chrysler Fifth Avenue,
which started at $20,860 and Imperial, which started at
$25,495.</p>
<p>Prices of Chrysler's minivans will each increase $118,
except for the Chrysler Town & Country version, which will
cost $125 more. Chrysler's least expensive minivan previously
started at $11,995.</p>
<p>Chrysler isn't raising prices of its least-expensive
domestic cars, the Plymouth Sundance and Dodge Shadow or on
two of its slowest-selling cars the Eagle Premier and Dodge
Monaco.</p>
<p>The No. 3 domestic auto maker didn't release any
information about price increases on Jeeps models. But
dealers said base prices on Cherokee, Wagoneer and Grand
Wagoneer jumped an average of $103.</p>
<p>GM slapped its biggest price increase of $369 on the 1991
Chevrolet S/T Blazer two-door truck. The truck's price prior
to the move was $12,966. The No. 1 auto maker also added $220
to the price of the 1991 Caprice Classic, which had cost
$15,125.</p>
<p>The lowest price increases of $65 primarily affected the
1990-model GM-10 cars: Chevrolet Lumina, Buick Regal,
Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme and Pontiac Grand Prix. The weak
sales of the midsized cars have disappointed GM officials who
expected the GM-10s to constitute the heart of GM's lineup.</p>
