	<p class="article-leader">LOS ANGELES -- TransTechnology Corp. posted a fiscal
fourth-quarter loss of $4.6 million, or 90 cents a share, and
said it suspended its dividend as part of a revised credit
agreement with its bank lenders.
   In the year-ago quarter, the maker of aerospace and
industrial products earned $5.3 million, or $1.02 a share.
Revenue fell 13% to $62.4 million from $71.6 million.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>TransTechnology had a loss from continuing operations of
$3 million, or 59 cents a share, compared with earnings from
continuing operations of $5.3 million, or $1.23 a share, a
year earlier. Two unprofitable units were recently sold.</p>
<p>Lee M. Parker, vice president, said the fourth-quarter
loss included "between $10 million and $12 million" in
write-downs, reflecting mainly inventory adjustments and an
increase in reserves for environmental cleanup of a facility.
TransTechnology's computer graphics business also was hurt by
the loss of a major customer.</p>
<p>Last month, TransTechnology cautioned that it would report
a loss for the quarter and year. In January, Chairman Arch
Scurlock predicted a strong fourth quarter that would "put
the company solidly in the black" for fiscal 1990.</p>
<p>Mr. Parker said Friday that "once it became apparent we
would be running a loss for the whole year, it became
advantageous to recognize things we might have debated with
auditors on and maximize the losses that will allow us to go
back and file for income tax refunds and generate income
tax-loss carry-forwards."</p>
<p>For the year, the company had a loss of $8.4 million, or
$1.64 a share, compared with year-earlier net income of $9.2
million, or $1.80 a share. Revenue fell to $198.5 million
from $219 million. The full-year loss from continuing
operations was $3.3 million, or 64 cents a share, compared
with year-ago earnings from continuing operations of $12.3
million, or $2.39 a share.</p>
<p>TransTechnology said that last week it reached agreement
with its bank lenders led by Bank of America in Los Angeles
for a $37 million loan to replace a $40 million revolving
credit facility. Mr. Parker said TransTechnology has borrowed
about $34 million of the $37 million available.</p>
<p>TransTechnology paid a dividend of 24 cents a share on
common stock in June. TransTechnology said that prior to this
year, it had increased its dividend every year for the past
decade.</p>
