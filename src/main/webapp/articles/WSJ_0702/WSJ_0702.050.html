	<h3>Technology: Pressure Rises For New Accord On Cut in CFCs</h3>

	<p class="article-leader">LONDON -- The ink is barely dry on a world
ozone-protection agreement reached here, but political
pressure for tougher measures is already mounting.
   The United Nations-sponsored pact calls for the developed
world to ban chlorofluorocarbons and many other
ozone-destroying chemicals by the year 2000. The developing
world has an extra decade to comply. The accord, expected to
cost the U.S. economy about $4.5 billion, is aimed at halting
chemically caused damage to the atmosphere's natural layer of
ozone gas, which helps block the Sun's harmful ultraviolet
rays.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the London agreement won't be the last word on the
subject. Even as the 10-day meeting ended Friday, officials
from West Germany, Australia, Scandinavia and other
"green"-minded nations were pushing for tougher measures --
including a ban by 1997, instead of 2000. And
environmentalists and some leading ozone scientists
immediately denounced the accord as inadequate to protect the
ozone layer.</p>
<p>"Within five years' time, they {world governments} will
realize they have to go a lot faster" to end use of CFCs,
said Joseph C. Farman, a British scientist whose discovery of
an "ozone hole" over Antarctica in 1985 touched off the
global alarm over CFCs. The accord, Mr. Farman said, will
still allow a 33% rise over the next decade in the
atmospheric concentration of ozone-destroying chlorine
compounds -- with unpredictable results for human health.</p>
<p>The prospect of tougher curbs worries many
chemical-industry officials, who say even the 2000 deadline
will be difficult to meet. "It's crystal ball-gazing," said
Michael Harris, a lobbyist for Britain's Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC. The accord "is an act of faith that somehow
or other our industry will find the answers to meet that
timetable."</p>
<p>The world's $2 billion-a-year production of CFCs and
related chemicals are used in refrigerators, air
conditioners, foam insulation, spray cans and industrial
solvent compounds. Many of these uses can be avoided; for
instance, nations can easily replace CFCs with hydrocarbon
gases as spray-can propellants, as U.S. industry did by law
in 1978.</p>
<p>But industry officials say that at least 40% of today's
CFC uses will depend for substitutes on special
ozone-friendly chemicals that the industry is only now
developing, many of which won't be ready until the middle of
the decade.</p>
<p>Most of the measures adopted in London -- which must still
be ratified by each nation's legislature -- are already in
U.S. House and Senate drafts of the Clean Air Act in
Congress.</p>
