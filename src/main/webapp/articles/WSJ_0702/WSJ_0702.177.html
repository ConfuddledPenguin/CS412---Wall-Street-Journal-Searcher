	<p class="article-leader">OSLO -- Striking oil workers began shutting down Norway's
offshore petroleum production after last-minute talks failed
to settle on a new contract, the union said.
   The Norwegian Federation of Oil Workers said the strike
could be a long one, but didn't estimate when the strike
might end.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Norway's North Sea fields produced 1.63 million barrels a
day of oil and 1.8 billion cubic meters of natural gas a
month in April, the latest official figures available. Norway
and the U.K. are Europe's largest petroleum producers.</p>
<p>The government has urged both sides to continue
negotiations, noting that roughly 25% of Norway's national
income comes from petroleum, and "a strike could be grave for
our economy," a government spokesman said.</p>
<p>The union said the 2.5% pay raise offered to offshore
workers is less than half its demand. The union also said the
strike defends workers' negotiation rights and protests
increased automation that may cost jobs.</p>
<p>Management maintains that the union's average annual wage,
313,000 kroner ($48,700), is already 85% higher than the
average wage in mainland industry.</p>
