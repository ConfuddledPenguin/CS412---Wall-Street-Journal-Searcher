	<p class="article-leader">OTTAWA -- Canadian farmers have increased their wheat
acreage by an estimated 3.2% this year, apparently confident
that the Canadian Wheat Board can again sell whatever
Canadian wheat that's produced.
   The wheat board is a government agency that handles
Canadian exports of wheat and barley. In nine of the past 10
years, the board has been able to sell practically all of the
wheat and barley farmers wanted to deliver.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Statistics Canada, a government agency that surveys
farmers, estimated Friday that Canada's wheat acreage this
year has increased to 34,744,000 acres from 33,671,600 last
year. Canada is usually the second largest wheat exporter
after the U.S., with Canadian sales accounting for about 21%
of world wheat exports.</p>
<p>Canadian spring wheat, which is seeded in the spring and
harvested in the autumn, accounted, as usual, for most of the
country's wheat acreage. This year's spring wheat seeding was
the largest since 1986,totaling an estimated 27,953,500
acres, a 6.7% increase from last year.</p>
<p>Price prospects for this year's spring wheat crop aren't
encouraging, however. The Wheat Board's asking export price
for the top grade of Canadian Western Red Spring wheat has
declined to US$163 a metric ton from $193 a ton in January. A
metric ton of wheat is equivalent to 36.74 bushels. "The
{price} drop reflects market expectations of an increase in
global wheat stocks in the current year after three years of
decline as well as seasonal pressure from new crop supply,"
said Patricia Mohr, senior economist at Bank of Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada estimated that acreage for durum wheat,
which is used to make pasta products, declined 13.2% to
5,600,000 acres. It was the first decline in durum acreage
since 1983. U.S. durum growers have complained that Canadian
durum has been making inroads into the U.S. market because of
alleged Canadian subsidies. But last week the U.S.
International Trade Commission, which investigated the
complaints, issued a report in Washington indicating there
wasn't any evidence that Canadian durum was unfairly priced.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada estimated Canada's winter wheat acreage,
which was seeded last autumn, at 1,190,500 acres, a 16.9%
increase from last year.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada estimated Canada's rapeseed acreage at
6,350,000 acres, a 11.5% decline from last year. This year's
rapeseed acreage is the smallest seeding since 1983 but it is
9% more than the area farmers indicated in March that they
intended to sow. Rapeseed, also known as canola, is Canada's
main oilseed crop.</p>
<p>Flaxseed acreage is estimated to have increased 18.4% to
1,870,000 acres. The report is expected to bolster flaxseed
prices because the increase is smaller than expected and
flaxseed supplies are tight, said Harvey Hanec, vice
president and prairie commodity coordinator for Scotia-McLeod
Inc.</p>
<p>Barley acreage was estimated to have declined 2.1% to
11,808,000. Mr. Hanec said the barley estimate was bullish
for the market because the acreage estimate was smaller than
expected. Barley is Canada's main feed grain.</p>
<p>Oats acreage was estimated to have declined 13% to
4,447,000 acres. But Mr. Hanec said the market had expected a
bigger drop and he predicted the report would be bearish for
oats.</p>
<p>Cool, wet weather slowed seeding in many parts of the
country this spring, but farmers were generally able to
complete planting on schedule.</p>
<p>Growing conditions have been generally favorable. The
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, a farmers' cooperative, reported
Friday that recent hot weather has helped bring crops along
in Saskatchewan, Canada's biggest wheat growing province. But
it said the hot weather also has led to drier soil conditions
and most areas of the province need rain within the next week
to 10 days.</p>
