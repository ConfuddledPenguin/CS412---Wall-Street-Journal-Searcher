	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.
are recalling about 43,000 cars that failed federal exhaust
tests, the Environmental Protection Agency said.
   The cars are 1986 Mitsubishi Cordias, Tredias and Space
Wagons; 1986 Dodge and Plymouth Colt Vistas; and 1987
Mitsubishi Space Wagons and Dodge and Plymouth Colt Vistas.
All of the cars have two-liter engines and nonelectric
chokes.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The manufacturers will modify the cars' air-injection
systems, clean and modify the carburetors and clean the
exhaust gas recirculation systems. The companies agreed to
the recall, which will be free to owners, after reviewing EPA
test results that showed excessive levels of hydrocarbons,
carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide in the cars' exhaust.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi began notifying owners by mail Friday.
Chrysler, which will repair the Dodge and Plymouth models,
expects to begin notifying owners in mid-August, the EPA
said.</p>
<p>Chrysler confirmed the recall but said it had no comment.
Mitsubishi wasn't available for comment.</p>
