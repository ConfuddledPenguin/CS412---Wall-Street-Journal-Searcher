	<p class="article-leader">PARIS -- By replacing aging Chairman Gustave Leven, Source
Perrier S.A. begins a search for more vigorous leadership
amid lingering sales problems caused by this year's benzene
contamination incident.
   Mr. Leven, 76 years old, built his once-sleepy water
company into an international marketing force. But the
idiosyncratic chairman failed to groom a strong successor.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>With sales recovering only slowly after Perrier recalled
its green bottles in February from stores and restaurants
world-wide, the company's main shareholders decided to take
action.</p>
<p>The new chairman is Jacques Vincent, who heads Perrier's
main shareholder, investment group Exor S.A., and who until
now was Perrier's vice chairman. But Mr. Vincent, 66 years
old, is expected to be an interim chairman. His job is to
find a longer-term professional manager, something Mr. Leven
apparently hadn't done to Exor's satisfaction.</p>
<p>Mr. Vincent's accession quieted rumors that Perrier might
be put on the block or become a takeover target, although it
didn't put the talk entirely to rest. Exor controls around
35% of Perrier shares and the sometimes divided Leven family
controls about 18% more.</p>
