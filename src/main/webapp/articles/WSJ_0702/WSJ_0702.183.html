	<p class="article-leader">In regard to your May 10 editorial "Lost Opportunity"
about the Senate's failure to approve a capital-gains tax cut
last November, I do not wish to quarrel with the excellent
sense of your editorial in the slightest, but why call this a
lost opportunity? Although the federal deficit is many times
larger and the crises we face in social wars far more evident
than they were in 1985, I do not understand why the
opportunity to lower the capital-gains tax is any less.
Particularly if the American people are united in demanding
it.
   I've been a long-term investor in both real estate and the
market since 1943, and I owe much of my success to the more
sensible tax code in place before 1986. The main benefit to
America is the unquestionable rise in revenue that would
ensue if the capital-gains tax were reduced. If longterm
investors were to be confronted with the bargains they would
have from a lower tax on sale of appreciated assets, the
effect would be enormous. Perhaps the reduction of the
federal deficit, as important as it would be when accompanied
by the natural reduction in inflation, is not as significant
to America's future as the break middle-income investors
would get from longterm appreciation.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Middle-income people have virtually no other way to save
up for the enormous costs of college education for their
children. And the housing and construction industry, now in a
predicament, could be given a shot in the arm if
middle-income folks could invest in family homes. If demand
for homes rises, the relative cost of mortgages goes down.
And every industry would benefit from a renewed lower tax on
capital gains. I think this is still very much worth fighting
for.</p>
