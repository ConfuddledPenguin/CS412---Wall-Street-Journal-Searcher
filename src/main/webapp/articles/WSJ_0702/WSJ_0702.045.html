	<p class="article-leader">Ilya Saslavski is the new Soviet man. He is 28, but looks
22. The capitalist reformer with the intense, boney face is
both a deputy to the National People's Congress and the
elected head of the Oktyabrsky District in Moscow. Aides
twice his age hover around him in an austere office the size
of three Soviet apartments. Crutches rest against the wall
behind his desk. Mr. Saslavski is an invalid, and even in
summer he wraps his slight body in two sweaters.
   While the much-publicized party convenes within the
Kremlin walls today, the real action is taking place at a
more local level, around such combative intellectuals as Mr.
Saslavski.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Western accounts tend to treat Soviet politics as normal
and ordered, with disputes settled at prearranged meetings
like the congress. But order has abandoned the Soviet Union.
The party has already lost the ability to impose its
decisions on the nation. It now vies for authority with many
semi-autonomous political bodies -- including parliaments on
each level of government, municipal governments, ministry
bureaucracies and the Presidential Council. Each of these
institutions tends to ignore the decisions of the others.</p>
<p>Asked what will happen at the 28th Party Congress, Mr.
Saslavski replies: "Nothing] A big spectacle] Somebody will
cry about the salvation of socialism, about the old great
Fatherland. Somebody will say the party must make a new face.
I know a lot of fascist criminals who have made a new face
for themselves."</p>
<p>Local authorities no longer try to reform the old power
centers, but to displace them. The Russian republic
government of Boris Yeltsin has assumed foreign policy powers
from the federal level and at a news conference Wednesday,
Mr. Yeltsin said he was willing to assume monetary policy as
well.</p>
<p>In this chaotic atmosphere, the struggle for control of
the Soviet Union comes to resemble a turf war. The party
apparatus seeks to maintain control of its property while
reformers aim to sell or give the buildings to private
enterprise. At the height of the Lithuanian crisis, the party
was worrying about protecting buildings.</p>
<p>A property battle in Mr. Saslavski's district is typical.
The Russian Communist Party recently built an apartment
building there, for use by the party elite. But Mr. Saslavski
has announced that he is taking possession of the building in
the name of the local government, and turning over the
apartments to ordinary families. The dispute is to be settled
in court, but Mr. Saslavski wouldn't have mounted the
challenge unless he knew that the local judge was pro-reform.</p>
<p>In Moscow and Leningrad, the hardline Communist parties
have grabbed the local newspapers away from city governments.
Battles rage for control of each television channel.
Sometimes, the fighting gets trivial. In the Moscow City
Soviet last Wednesday, hardliners put a bust of Lenin in a
hallway. Later in the day, the reformist bloc marched down
the hall and stole it.</p>
<p>The crisis of authority pervades the bureaucracy. "I don't
know what the decision-making process will be tomorrow," says
economist Andrei Anikin. "I don't know what it is today. I
only know what it was yesterday." Parts of the nation are now
free zones, where reformers have managed to carve out some
turf. But there is no stability, no civil society.</p>
<p>Amidst this rugged political street fighting, democratic
reformers reject the moralistic politics of a Vaclav Havel or
an Andrei Sakharov. "If people think they can rule with a
moral mantle, they will fail," says Pastahor Koteinkovo,
considered one of the more brilliant young political
scientists in the nation. "Politics is a professional
business. The people understand that there is no place for
morality in politics."</p>
<p>Reformers say their main purpose now is to forge alliances
with party hacks and other opportunists. Moscow's reformist
City Council head Gavriil Popov, for instance, has already
established ties with powerful KGB figures.</p>
<p>"Democrats proved their ability to ally with different
people when they made an alliance with Yeltsin. He was not a
democrat and it has turned out to be a very good alliance,"
says Andrei Kutinikov of the Institute of the U.S.A. and
Canada.</p>
<p>It has indeed. Mr. Yeltsin has surrounded himself with
free-market intellectuals and, according to reformers, has
irretrievably tied himself to capitalism. The democrats are
practically rapturous about Mr. Yeltsin's tactical genius.
Recently, he was invited to speak to the conservative party
leaders, but he stood them up to visit new graduates of the
military academy.</p>
<p>Mr. Yeltsin moreover is the crucial link between the
democratic intelligentsia and the people. "He is the only
man, and the last man, who can be believed by the miners,"
says People's Deputy Eugeny Vostrikov. At a press conference
Wednesday, Mr. Yeltsin declared that the federal government
had violated every plank of its recent agreement with the
miners, and announced that from now on, his Russian
government would take control of mine issues. Thus, he is the
major source of stability, for if the miners or transport
workers go on strike, then the Soviet Union dissolves quickly
into chaos.</p>
<p>In the West, Mr. Yeltsin's claims that the KGB recently
tried to kill him are discounted, but here they are treated
as fact. Mr. Yeltsin has his own bodyguards and will not
accept KGB protection. It is also widely believed that while
the military could succeed in overthrowing Mr. Gorbachev
without much public protest, the generals would have a
difficult time mobilizing their troops against Mr. Yeltsin.</p>
<p>As democrats have consolidated, so have the party
hardliners. The years of perestroika provided them with
greater resources, and have especially strengthened the
young, aggressive party officials. "They are profiteering
from perestroika," explains economist and Democratic Union
leader Yuri Skubco. "The party nomenklatura have the power to
register new enterprises. The whole system depends on whom
the "apparatchiks" decide to give registration to. Basically,
the sphere of cooperation with foreign companies was
controlled by the KGB."</p>
<p>Party conservatives organized their troops at the recent
Russian Party Congress, and they will be further consolidated
at this week's Union Congress, at which the Russian oligarchs
will join even more rigid Leninists from the Baltics and
Byelorussia.</p>
<p>The Party is still the richest organization in the Soviet
Union. It controls the most important trump card, the KGB. As
recently retired KGB Maj. Gen. Oleg Kalugin explains in the
current issue of Moscow News, the KGB is as engaged in
domestic political espionage, as it always was.</p>
<p>For democrats, the Party Congress will mark the formal
break with the Leninist forces. This will provide the
headlines, but in actuality, of course, the two sides broke
long ago. Society is polarized.</p>
<p>Mr. Gorbachev sits in the middle, alone. "Perhaps Mr.
Gorbachev will give to the party the opportunity to make
quarrels among themselves and he will look at them like Zeus
looking down on earth," says Mr. Saslavski. Other observers
suggest a Romanian strategy: Mr. Gorbachev could change the
party's name, appoint new leaders, and then form a coalition
with phony democratic parties.</p>
<p>But the widespread sense is that brilliant tactics can no
longer save Mr. Gorbachev. He has violated the trust of both
sides. Although he still controls the stageplay of the Party
Congress, he may be left irrelevant to political reality, as
the struggle for power dissolves into building-by-building
battles between hard young democrats and hard young
apparatchiks.</p>
<p>For 72 years the Communists have portrayed the New Soviet
Man, a musclebound behemoth, loyal to the collective and
smiling vapidly. Now along comes the likes of Ilya Saslavski,
an arrogant, prickly manchild with useless legs. The
conservatives may win in the end in a bloodbath, but for the
moment, in the Oktyabrsky district, he is beating them.</p>
