	<p class="article-leader">It pays to be lucky in business, as James F. Montgomery
once more has been reminded.
   Mr. Montgomery is chairman and chief executive officer of
Great Western Financial Corp., which became the biggest
thrift in Florida's lending market with its acquisition of
the remains of Miami-based CenTrust Savings Bank from the
Resolution Trust Corp. Great Western, based in Beverly Hills,
Calif., paid about $86 million to pick up 71 branches and $5
billion of deposits formerly held by CenTrust. Mr. Montgomery
said Great Western intends to sell assets it also acquired in
the transaction, reducing its ultimate outlay to about $60
million. The government threw in $1.7 billion, tying CenTrust
with Western Savings Association, Phoenix, Ariz., for the
distinction of being the most expensive single thrift failure
to date.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Great Western's $60 million bill contrasts with the $150
million Mr. Montgomery agreed to pay for certain CenTrust
branches and deposits last year, before the extent of the rot
at CenTrust became clear. CenTrust, laid low by the
extravagant ways of its chairman, David L. Paul, was seized
by the government early this year, enabling Great Western to
scrap its previous accord and ultimately to save tens of
millions of dollars. That also raises the question of whether
regulators could have saved the taxpayers money by moving
more quickly to rein in CenTrust before the value of its
assets shriveled so much.</p>
<p>"Some time has passed since our first agreement, and the
assets have deteriorated," noted Mr. Montgomery. "I can't
second guess the government. But sometimes things work out to
where you can pick up things a little cheaper."</p>
<p>Great Western also on Friday acquired 18 Florida branches
of defunct Gibraltar Financial Corp.'s Gibraltar Savings Bank
from the RTC. The two transactions will give Great Western
150 Florida branches and particularly strenghten its presence
in Miami and Orlando, two of the country's more bristling
banking markets. Great Western also got a toehold on
Florida's prosperous West Coast, entering for the first time
Tampa and St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>Mr. Montgomery said that about $2.1 billion of the $5
billion in CenTrust deposits acquired from the government are
retail deposits, with the remainder being more volatile
brokered deposits. On that basis, Great Western's purchase
price was roughly 3% of retail deposits, which is the middle
range of prices paid for large thrift branch systems bought
from the RTC.</p>
<p>Brokered deposits are large sums of money placed by Wall
Street money managers, who move the deposits swiftly from
institution to institution in search of the highest interest
rates.</p>
<p>Mr. Montgomery said he expects the brokered deposits to
leave the institution when Great Western trims the high rates
CenTrust had been paying to attract deposits. In all, Mr.
Montgomery said, the two transactions are expected to
eventually leave Great Western with about $6 billion in
Florida retail deposits.</p>
<p>Great Western has $40 billion of assets and about 1,000
offices nationwide. The transactions were disclosed after the
market closed on Friday, when its stock closed at $18, off
12.5 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
