	<p class="article-leader">DEARBORN, Mich. -- Ford Motor Co. said it will temporarily
idle its Dearborn assembly plant for one week beginning July
16, because of a shortage of dealer orders for the Mustangs
built there.
   The move will affect about 2,100 hourly employees on the
plant's two shifts, and it will cut Mustang production by
about 3,700 units. According to industry trade publication
Ward's Automotive Reports, Ford's dealers held an 81-day
supply of Mustangs at the end of May, significantly higher
than the 60- to 65-day supply that is optimum for the
industry.</p>
