	<p class="article-leader">The head of the Trump Shuttle has stepped down, a move
reflecting the continuing turmoil at Donald Trump's
one-year-old airline.
   Bruce Nobles, president of the Shuttle, was replaced
Friday by Richard Cozzi, who has been the airline's vice
president of operations since its inception. Mr. Cozzi will
also be the chief operating officer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The Shuttle has lost almost $100 million since Mr. Trump
acquired it from Eastern Airlines for $365 million in June
last year. Although Trump officials and Mr. Nobles weren't
available for comment, Mr. Trump has previously expressed
disappointment that the Shuttle hasn't performed better. The
airline, which operates Boston-New York-Washington shuttle
flights, has increased its share of that market to 50%, but
Trump officials had hoped for 60% by now.</p>
<p>Mr. Nobles's departure follows a series of other changes
at the Trump Shuttle. It recently canceled four daily round
trips in both the Boston-New York and Washington-New York
markets on Saturday, as well as two other flights in each
market Sunday. Also, it has laid off about 70 employees and
cut back a few frills, such as its concierge desk.</p>
<p>Mr. Nobles was president of the Pan Am Shuttle before
joining the Trump airline. At Pan Am, Mr. Nobles helped to
end Eastern Airlines' dominance in the lucrative Boston-New
York-Washington shuttle flights. By the end of 1988, after
two years of operations, Pan Am had garnered 45% of the
travel on those routes, largely because of Mr. Nobles's
start-up efforts and Eastern's much publicized difficulties.</p>
