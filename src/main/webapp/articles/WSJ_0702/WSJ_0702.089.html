	<p class="article-leader">In the old days, debates between experts on Japan were
genteel, scholarly affairs. But as divisions between the
experts have grown, so too have bitterness and rancor.
   Last year, for example, Karel van Wolferen and Edwin
Reischauer met to tape a show on Japan at a Cambridge, Mass.,
radio station. Mr. van Wolferen, a Dutch journalist and
author of a book critical of Japan's political system,
believes the U.S. should be warier of the country. Mr.
Reischauer, a former ambassador to Japan, advocates a strong
friendship between the two nations.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The show, however, was never aired; it degenerated into a
shouting match.</p>
<p>"The guy got so violent," says Mr. Reischauer.</p>
<p>Counters Mr. van Wolferen: "I was very polite to him all
the time. I told him, `It's clear I know more about political
developments in Japan than you do. Why don't you just
listen?'"</p>
