	<p class="article-leader">The Federal Trade Commission took a step toward blocking
the $220 million acquisition of certain assets of Union
Carbide Corp. by Arco Chemical Co., but the companies said
they believe they can still resolve antitrust issues.
   Resolving those issues may be particularly important to
Arco Chemical, because it has already made full payment to
Carbide. And, according to both companies, the payment is
nonrefundable under the terms of their agreement, reached
last September. The companies added that if the deal doesn't
go through, Arco Chemical has rights to the proceeds from a
subsequent sale of the assets.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The step taken by the FTC was to authorize its staff to
seek a preliminary injunction rescinding Arco Chemical's
purchase of Carbide's urethane polyols and propylene glycol
businesses. Urethane polyols are the main raw material for
polyurethane, which is used in foam cushions and packaging.
Propylene glycol is used in products including fiberglass,
paints and cosmetics.</p>
<p>The FTC said it was seeking a recision, as opposed to a
barring of the transaction, because it "had reason to believe
that beneficial ownership" of Carbide's assets had already
passed to Arco Chemical. Marc Schildkraut, an FTC staff
member, declined to say exactly what constitutes beneficial
ownership in the view of the commission. But he acknowledged
that the up-front payment by Arco Chemical is part of the
issue.</p>
<p>"An up-front payment is unusual," said Mr. Schildkraut.
Asked whether the payment could be returned to Arco Chemical
by court order, he said, "That's something that will be up to
the judge." The companies haven't commented on the reasons
for the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p>The FTC also alleged that the companies failed to make
timely premerger notification filings to antitrust agencies.
The commission didn't go into specifics, and the companies
denied the charge.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Carbide, based in Danbury, Conn., said it
continues to operate the businesses in question and to
collect the revenue from them. Upon closing of the sale, he
said, Carbide is to pay Arco Chemical any "surplus cash flow"
accumulated during this interim period, and Arco Chemical is
to compensate Carbide for any "negative cash flow."</p>
<p>Carbide has already accounted for the up-front payment,
having taken in the 1989 third quarter a gain to earnings of
about $62 million.</p>
<p>Arco Chemical, based in Newtown Square, Pa., said in a
statement that it is still negotiating with the FTC's staff
and that the commission's action "was intended only to
authorize litigation in the event the matter cannot otherwise
be resolved."</p>
<p>All the parties to the negotiations declined to specify
the antitrust issues.</p>
<p>Arco Chemical added that it is confident the courts will
allow the acquisition to proceed if the FTC's action results
in litigation.</p>
<p>In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Arco
Chemical closed at $40.75, unchanged. The company is
83%-owned by Atlantic Richfield Co., Los Angeles. Carbide
shares closed on the Big Board at $19.25, down 12.5 cents
apiece.</p>
