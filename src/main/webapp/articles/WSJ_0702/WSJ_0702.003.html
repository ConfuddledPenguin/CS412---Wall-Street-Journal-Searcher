	<p class="article-leader">CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- PC/Computing, a computer magazine
owned by the Ziff-Davis Publishing Co. unit of Ziff
Communications Co., New York, said it acquired the subscriber
list of Personal Computing, a computer magazine that the
Netherlands-based VNU N.V. is discontinuing.
   Terms weren't disclosed.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Personal Computing, which has a paid circulation of more
than 400,000 and which was recently named "best computer
magazine" by the Computer Press Association, said it will
stop publishing after its August issue.</p>
<p>VNU (United Dutch Publishers) has been systematically
selling off its U.S. magazines in the past three years and
expanding its acquisitions of computer data-based services
for the marketing, legal and financial professions. At one
point, VNU published seven computer and electronic magazines
under VNU Business Publications Inc., based in Hasbrouck
Heights, N.J.</p>
<p>Personal Computing, founded in 1976, is the last of the
magazines that VNU owned in the U.S. The magazine, which has
changed owners three times since its inception, was acquired
by VNU in 1980.</p>
<p>With the folding of Personal Computing and the sale of its
subscriber list to Ziff-Davis, Robert J. Lydon, president of
VNU Business Publications and Personal Computing, said he
will leave the company. "Ziff came to us with a very
attractive offer," he said, adding, "In today's increasingly
complex market, we felt our readers and advertisers would be
better served by Ziff's multi-title resources in the computer
field."</p>
<p>Ziff-Davis also owns PC Magazine, a biweekly computer
magazine, and PC Week, a weekly newspaper. The three
publications combined have 1.2 million readers, the company
said.</p>
<p>PC/Computing has a paid circulation of more than 500,000.
With the acquisition, PC/Computing will add about 100,000
subscribers to its list. Most of Personal Computing's
circulation will be lost to PC/ Computing, owing to
duplications, lost newsstand sales and the termination of a
bulk subscription from the Pan Am Shuttle, a Northeast
corridor air carrier. PC/ Computing said its product is
already sold in airport newsstands.</p>
