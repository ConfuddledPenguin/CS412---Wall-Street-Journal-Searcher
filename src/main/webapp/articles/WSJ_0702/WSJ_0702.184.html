	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- In the end, President Bush decided, actions
speak louder than lips.
   In abandoning his politically potent anti-tax pledge, Mr.
Bush calculated that the conservatives who were most outraged
by his decision will eventually return to his camp -- both
because their arguments will be lost amid a reinvigorated
economy and because, says one close adviser, "They have no
place else to go."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In a session with reporters, President Bush acknowledged
that his sudden announcement that tax revenue increases will
be part of any budget accord has sent "the arrows flying."
But he said he expects he will ultimately be judged more on
the results of the decision than on the fact that he went
back on his promise: "More important than posturing now or
even negotiating is the result. Do we continue to provide
jobs for the American people and do we continue to provide
economic growth, and do we try to stop saddling the
generations on the way up and the young people with
absolutely unacceptable deficits?"</p>
<p>In the meantime, the arrows have indeed been flying on the
president's right flank since the Tuesday announcement. The
conservative Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based think
tank whose leaders have supported Mr. Bush on other tough
issues, called the move a "deplorable flip-flop" and likened
it to Mr. Bush's burning a flag or offering a pardon to
Willie Horton, the furloughed Massachusetts convict that Mr.
Bush made infamous in the 1988 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>One of Mr. Bush's 1988 primary opponents, Christian
broadcaster Pat Robertson, was even more blunt. On his 700
Club television show last week, Mr. Robertson characterized
the president's statement as: "Read my lips, I also lie." And
Ralph Reed, a Robertson associate who heads a conservative
group called Christian Coalition, said in an interview that
"George Bush has guaranteed himself primary opposition in
1992."</p>
<p>But presidential allies dismiss such talk. They note
public-opinion polls show that most of the public seems
prepared to blame others, such as former President Reagan or
Congress, much more than Mr. Bush if taxes do rise. And if a
successful deficit-reduction package succeeds in boosting the
economy, no one will care about the conservatives'
complaints, they argue.</p>
<p>"If you get results, that's all that counts. Nothing works
better than a good economy," says GOP pollster Robert Teeter,
a close associate of Mr. Bush who conferred with him several
times in recent weeks. Even if conservatives remain unhappy
with the president, he is still likely to be infinitely more
acceptable to them than anyone the Democrats nominate in
1992.</p>
<p>For the moment, says GOP political consultant John
Buckley, "there isn't an immediate mechanism by which they
{conservatives} can hurt the White House. The belief is that
conservatives sure aren't going to punish congressional
candidates for what the White House has done." The White
House, says Mr. Buckley, is "preparing for an exam in 1992. I
think they think they can flunk any number of conservative
quizzes between now and then and still not flunk the
cumulative exam."</p>
<p>Moreover, White House officials note that the chorus of
complaints from the right, while widespread, is far from
unanimous. At least some normally stringently anti-tax voices
(including this newspaper's editorial page) have been
restrained in their criticism, saying they will wait to see
whether the president can deliver on his other goals for the
budget summit -- significant social-program spending cuts and
an overhaul of the government's budgetary process -- before
deciding whether to condemn him for his apostasy on taxes.</p>
<p>Still, while discounting any long-term threat to the
president from the right on taxes, White House aides and
allies admit some danger exists. The principal risk, they
say, is that the issue could prompt conservatives who were
already suspicious of Mr. Bush's commitment to their causes
to become a nuisance, continually setting off political brush
fires against him and burning up resources.</p>
<p>Angry conservatives, however, insist the dangers to the
president go further. "In politics, intensity counts for
something," says Mr. Reed, the Robertson ally. "In '80 and
'84 we worked with intensity. We delivered for {Ronald
Reagan} because he was talking our language and singing our
song." By contrast, he suggests, many conservatives might sit
on their hands in 1992, especially if the Democratic nominee
isn't closely identified with the party's liberal wing.</p>
<p>Stuart Butler, director of domestic policy at the Heritage
Foundation, adds, "I know there is this notion that he is
only alientating a constituency that has nowhere else to go."
But that notion, he says, "is overlooking the fact that they
are a constituency that is mad as hell."</p>
<p>Mr. Bush, for his part, insisted in his news conference
that his policy reversal didn't represent a change in his
philosophy on taxes but rather a requirement of leadership.</p>
<p>"We've got a very important national problem, and I think
the president owes the people his judgment at the moment he
has to address that problem," the president said. "And that's
exactly what I'm trying to do." He knew he would "catch some
flak on this decision," he insisted, "but I've got to do what
I think is right, and then I'll ask the people for support."</p>
<p>Noting that he is about to begin a week of discussions
with world leaders that will culminate with next week's
Houston summit of the leading industrialized nations, the
president said: "I am optimistic that we can get a budget
agreement legislated which not only tells the world that
America puts its fiscal house in order, but also will garner
the full support of the American people."</p>
