	<p class="article-leader">If people ever questioned the power of the free press and
that of The Wall Street Journal in particular, they should be
aware of the Fibreboard story reported in your paper by Roger
Lowenstein (Heard on the Street, May 3).
   He detailed certain proposals that were counter to the
shareholders' interests, which were to be acted on at the
annual meeting being held on May 7. The reaction to the
article's disclosures was to ignite shareholders either to
cast their vote or change the one previously made. The
inspectors of the election got only three hours of sleep on
the night previous to the meeting because of the need to
recount the changed vote.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>As a direct result of the article, the contested proposal
did not receive a majority of the votes cast. It subsequently
has been rescinded by the company.</p>
<p>On behalf of the thousands of shareholders of Fibreboard,
I would like to express our appreciation for the outstanding
coverage. It is a wonderful example of the power of the press
to inquire and disclose so that the reader can make an
informed judgment as to the merits of a matter.</p>
