	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Moody's Investors Service Inc. lowered ratings
on about $1 billion of Charter Medical Corp.'s high-yield,
high-risk junk bonds. The ratings firm cited volatility in
demand for pyschiatric services and Charter's possible
difficulties in refinancing debt.
   Moody's reduced Charter's senior debt ratings to
single-B-2 from single-B-1, and its subordinated and junior
subordinated debentures to Caa from single-B-3. In addition,
Moody's lowered Charter's preferred stock rating to Ca from
single-B-3, and affirmed Charter's senior subordinated debt
at single-B-3. Last March, Moody's had placed all of
Charter's credit ratings under review for possible downgrade.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Charter, based in Macon, Ga., is one of the largest
operators of psychiatric hospitals in the U.S. and also
operates 13 general hospitals. A Charter spokesman declined
to comment on the dowgrades, except to say, "We're very
positive" about the company's prospects.</p>
<p>Moody's said Charter's lower credit quality relates to its
"limited prospects for a rebound in profitability, to the
newly demonstrated potential for volatility in demand for
psychiatric services, and to the increased risk facing highly
leveraged companies with refinancing needs."</p>
<p>The ratings firm concluded, "Plans to reduce construction
of new hospitals will increase discretionary cash flow
through 1992. However, meeting future years' bank debt
amortization obligations is likely to require external
sourcing of funds which Moody's believes represents higher
risk for the company in the present financial environment."</p>
