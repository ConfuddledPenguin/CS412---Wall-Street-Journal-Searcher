	<p class="article-leader">WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. -- Texaco Inc. named Peter I. Bijur
president of its European operations.
   The appointment, effective in November, is a major step up
for the 48-year-old executive, who for the past year has been
running the company's U.K. operations. Before that, Mr. Bijur
was chief executive officer of Texaco Canada Inc. until it
was sold as part of Texaco's restructuring. In 1984, he drew
the difficult task of selling assets related to Texaco's
acquisition of Getty Oil Co.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In his new post, Mr. Bijur will succeed Paul B. Hicks Jr.,
64, who is retiring after 37 years with Texaco. Mr. Hicks has
served as a senior vice president of Texaco Inc. in addition
to being president of Texaco Europe.</p>
<p>Mr. Bijur, a Texaco employee for 24 years, will take
charge of Texaco Europe at a crucial time. Right now,
international oil companies are vying for business in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union. "These areas are the new
frontier because they've been closed for so long," Mr. Bijur
said.</p>
<p>Although Western Europe will remain the primary focus for
Texaco Europe, Mr. Bijur said his operation will aggressively
seek opportunities in Eastern bloc countries as they shed
government structures that have kept the countries from
striking up business relations with Western companies.</p>
<p>Texaco has already established a task force to look for
opportunities as those countries open up. The company
recently reached an agreement with the Soviet government to
use computers for geological research, and is pursuing
possible marketing arrangements there.</p>
