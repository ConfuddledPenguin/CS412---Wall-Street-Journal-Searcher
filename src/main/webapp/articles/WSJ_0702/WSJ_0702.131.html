	<p class="article-leader">ATLANTA -- Signs of the past decade's turbulence were
evident everywhere as about 4,000 of the country's personnel
managers gathered here last week.
   Vendors of services that scarcely existed when the 1980s
began dominated the exhibit hall: Outplacement firms to ease
unwanted managers on to other careers; drug-testing concerns
to ensure a narcotic-free workplace. Some services vow to
catch workplace criminals; others, to attack spiraling
health-care costs.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Workshop topics at the meeting, the annual convention of
the Society for Human Resource Management, betrayed the pace
of change: Illiteracy in the workplace. Sex. Drugs. AIDS.
"How many people here have been involved in mergers,
acquisitions, rapid growth or reductions in force, corporate
relocation or a plant closing?" asks Jackie Greaner, an
Atlanta consultant. Almost all the 80 or so people attending
her session raise their hands.</p>
<p>When she asked the question at a similar gathering eight
years ago, Ms. Greaner says, fewer than 10% of attendees said
yes. "Who here knows what business as usual is?" she asks. No
one raises a hand. To her, the answers signal the end of an
era of predictability.</p>
<p>There are, says Jeffrey J. Hallett, a Falls Church,
Va.-based consultant, "no rules, no institutions, no
behaviors, no experiences and no definitions" that can be
counted on to last through the next decade. During the 1990s,
he predicts: "Confusion and turbulence will be worse, not
better" as companies struggle to cope with technology,
globalization, changing demography and a changing work force.</p>
<p>One result is a kind of revisionism.</p>
<p>During the 1980s, many mourned the death of corporate
loyalty, lost to the ravages of cutbacks and downsizing.
Today, however, some experts contend that corporate loyalty
wasn't all it was cracked up to be but actually downright bad
for companies and workers alike.</p>
<p>The word for the 1990s, they say, is "commitment."</p>
<p>The difference between loyalty and commitment, says Ms.
Greaner, is that commitment is "more conscious. Corporate
loyalty isn't necessarily a healthy attitude. Loyalty means
don't miss time off the job, don't call in sick. It's
passive. You can be loyal, but not actively participate in
your company."</p>
<p>Agrees consultant Joseph L. Mancusi: Loyalty is "based on
the presumption you will be taken care of. Corporations or
managers or people on welfare -- they are equal if they feel
they are going to be taken care of."</p>
<p>What's more, experts contend that commitment can be
created. "Even if you aren't committed to your organization
any more, you can help people find other sources of
commitment that make them excited," says Ms. Greaner.
"Commitment isn't all or nothing," she says. "You can be
committed to your boss, your job, to your customers."</p>
<p>"We are recycling the '60s in the '90s," says Mr. Mancusi.
"People are finding external things to be committed to."</p>
<p>Most chief executive officers have said -- at least once
in their careers -- that "people are our most valuable
assets."</p>
<p>Mr. Hallett wishes they meant it. With a shrinking work
force and declining skills level, he contends that a stable
and trained work force is as much a critical investment as
plants and machinery. But conventional accounting doesn't
take people into account, except as costs.</p>
<p>"Human resource people and the bean counters have to get
together to figure out a new set of generally accepted
accounting principles to get human relations on the balance
sheet," he tells one session. "We have to figure out how to
account for human relations so we can value investment in
people. Until we get {people} on the balance sheet, no one
will take it seriously," he says.</p>
<p>"It's true," says Gary Stagner, director of human
resources for Partners National Health Plan, a health
maintainance organization in Irving, Texas. "I come out of a
service industry, and people are our only product."</p>
<p>Others have personal reasons for agreeing: "If you could
value your contribution, it would make you more valuable to
the organization," says James Wells, an associate vice
chancellor who handles personnel matters for University of
Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, Mass.</p>
<p>Mr. Hallett contends the idea isn't so far-fetched, noting
that at the turn of the century, there wasn't any recognized
method for accounting for inventory, or for work in progress.</p>
<p>If companies hope to keep unions at bay, one speaker
warned the personnel managers, they had better wise up -- and
treat their employees a lot less nicely.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom, of course, is that companies are
ripe targets for unionization if they don't pay their workers
well. But Daniel C. Stone, an anti-union strategy consultant,
suggests that some workers are susceptible to union overtures
because they're paid too generously. That, he contends, can
lead to boredom and complacency -- issues he says a union can
capitalize on.</p>
<p>"I usually find something I can sink my teeth in --
management styles, lack of communication, a bully supervisor,
whatever," he says. "I've been involved in a couple of
campaigns this year and the issue was boredom. It's
incredible."</p>
<p>Mr. Stone says he recently faulted executives at one
company that hired him, which he didn't identify, for
"overpaying" employees. He had unkind words for the
employees, as well.</p>
<p>He said employees "take all those liberal benefits that
you pay them and they'll complain about it and they'll say
this is a lousy place to work for. But they're there every
pay day with their little hand out and they make a fist as
they grab their pay check and go off to the bank."</p>
<p>Every banner, sign and meeting badge featured the
society's new logo: a distinctive "HR" in white letters, set
within a dark box. To one convention-goer, however, the logo
isn't distinct enough.</p>
<p>Robin Inwald recently filed a petition with the U.S.
Patent and Trademark office, seeking to cancel the logo
registration issued to the society in February. That design,
she argues, is "confusingly similar" to a logo used since
1980 by Hilson Research Inc., the psychological testing
company she owns in Kew Gardens, N.Y.</p>
<p>Ms. Inwald contends that the society obtained its
registration fraudulently, since it knew about her logo from
advertisements she bought in its monthly magazine and from
exhibit booths she has rented at its conventions. If the
society continues using its new logo, she fears, potential
clients may believe her company and the society are one --
resulting in what she says could be "irreperable damage" and
"great injury" to her company.</p>
<p>Catherine D. Bower, the society's vice president for
communications, denies the association stole the idea for its
logo from Hilson Research. She says "meticulous research"
preceded adoption of the design last year, part of a $30,000
image overhaul from the group's previous identity as the
American Society for Personnel Administration. Ms. Bower
believes differences between the logos -- the society's is
boxed, for instance -- minimize the likelihood of confusion,
and she says there are no plans to apologize to Ms. Inwald --
or to reconsider the decision.</p>
