	<p class="article-leader">The big beverage companies will post higher second-quarter
earnings, on the continued strength of low-calorie drinks and
on the successful introduction of several new beers.
   Coca-Cola Co. is expected to post an earnings gain of
about 18%, analysts estimate. PepsiCo Inc. and Anheuser-Busch
Cos. are seen having increases of at least 10%. Adolph Coors
Co. may report a 20% boost in earnings. After a gain from the
sale of an Ohio business, bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.
is also expected to report higher net income.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Analysts expect Coca-Cola, which generates the bulk of its
earnings abroad, to show a 6% to 7% increase in concentrate
shipments overseas. That's below the company's typical goal
of 8% to 10%, but analysts noted that much of the decline
resulted from continued economic deterioration in Argentina
and Brazil. Outside those countries, Coca-Cola's overseas
shipments rose 9%, estimates Emanuel Goldman, an analyst with
PaineWebber Inc. The second-quarter results compare with a
strong period a year earlier, in which shipments increased
15%.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola is expected to show strong volume gains in
Europe, a critical geographic stronghold for the company,
particularly in France and Spain. Coca-Cola has made a big
push in France since it acquired the bulk of its French
distribution business last year. Separately, Coca-Cola said
its British joint venture opened a new plant in Wakefield,
England, on Thursday. The plant is the largest soft-drink
production facility in Europe.</p>
<p>In the U.S., Coca-Cola's volume, measured in gallons, is
expected to inch up only 2% to 3%, analysts estimate, while
PepsiCo is expected to post an increase of about 5%.
Coca-Cola, which derives about one-third of its volume from
fountain accounts, has been hurt by softness in the
restaurant industry. But PepsiCo has been able to capitalize
on the fountain business because PepsiCo's own restaurants
have been outperforming most others, says Martin Romm, an
analyst with First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>Additionally, analysts said, PepsiCo benefited from
stronger sales of recently reformulated Diet Pepsi and from a
smoother execution of its summer marketing programs,
including the sale of specially designed Pepsi cans, called
"Cool Cans." Coke has had a rougher ride. Earlier this month,
amid bad publicity, the company abandoned its MagiCans
promotion. Some of the cans, which contained currency and
coupons redeemable for prizes, proved to be defective. Mr.
Romm said he believed the promotion had a "modest" impact on
volume. But a spokesman for Coca-Cola said the MagiCans
promotion had "no negative impact. If anything, MagiCans
contributed to the up side" of sales, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola will earn
58 cents to 60 cents a share, according to analysts'
estimates, compared with 49 cents, adjusted for a stock
split, a year earlier.</p>
<p>PepsiCo, of Purchase, N.Y., will earn about $1.10 to $1.15
a share in the quarter, despite an estimated four cents a
share in earnings dilution from acquisitions. The higher
earnings, boosted by stronger restaurant and snack-food
sales, compares with the $1 a share PepsiCo reported a year
earlier.</p>
<p>Discounting a gain and certain one-time charges, Coca-Cola
Enterprises apparently will show another decrease in
operating earnings. The company's earnings have been
disappointing for several quarters because soft-drink price
increases haven't covered the bottler's rising costs for
marketing and raw materials.</p>
<p>Several analysts expect the bottler's per-share earnings
from operations to be about 21 cents to 24 cents. Those
figures don't include a gain from the sale of an Ohio
bottling property and certain charges that, taken together,
will result in a net per-share gain of 15 cents. In the
year-ago quarter, Coca-Cola Enterprises reported per-share
net income of 26 cents. A company spokesman noted that that
figure included about three cents in income related to the
sale of property and a repurchase of bonds.</p>
<p>In the quarter, Anheuser-Busch, St. Louis, is expected to
report earnings of 90 cents to 92 cents a share, compared
with 82 cents in the quarter a year ago. The company's beer
shipments increased a moderate 3% or so, as the brewer
boosted sales with new products, including Bud Dry and Busch
Draft Light. Mr. Romm said Anheuser-Busch continued to enjoy
sales growth at the expense of smaller competitors.</p>
<p>Coors, of Golden, Colo., is expected to report that
earnings increased to between 55 cents and 60 cents, from 46
cents a year earlier. Led by sales of Keystone, Keystone
Light and Coors Light, Coors is expected to show an 18% jump
in beer shipments in the quarter.</p>
