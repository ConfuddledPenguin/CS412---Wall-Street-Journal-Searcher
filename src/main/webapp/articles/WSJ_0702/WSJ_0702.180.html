	<p class="article-leader">A U.S. bankruptcy court judge ordered the Chapter 11
proceedings of holding companies of Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. moved from San Francisco
to Cincinnati.
   The unusual transfer is the result of one of the most
hotly contested disputes in the bankruptcy proceedings of the
two Campeau Corp. retail units. Allied bondholders argued
that the holding company cases should be heard in Cincinnati,
where the retail units filed for bankruptcy-court protection
Feb. 15. Four other Federated and Allied creditors committees
supported the request for the transfer.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>At a hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Lloyd King
in San Francisco, Issac M. Pachulski, an attorney for
Federated Stores Inc., and other holding companies argued
that the cases should remain in San Francisco because Ralph's
Grocery Stores Inc., partly owned by one of the network of
four holding companies, is located in California.</p>
<p>Jonathan M. Jacobson, an attorney for Allied bondholders,
said that the proceedings should be heard by U.S. bankruptcy
court Judge J. Vincent Aug, Jr., in Cincinnati, because the
affairs of the holding companies and retail units are
"completely enmeshed."</p>
<p>Separately, Allied has announced an agreement with
Chemical Banking Corp. for a new loan facility to finance its
receivables. The arrangement replaces a Citibank financing
that expires today. The agreement calls for $630 million in
receivables financing but can be increased to $700 million.
The loans will be funded by commercial paper. A spokeswoman
for Chemical said this will be the first time a company in
Chapter 11 proceedings has been able to access the commercial
paper market. The agreement must be approved by Judge Aug.</p>
