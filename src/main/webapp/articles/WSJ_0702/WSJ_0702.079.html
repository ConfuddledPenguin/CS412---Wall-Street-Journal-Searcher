	<p class="article-leader">George Melloan's timely reminder that "Class Struggle Will
Not End With Communism" (Global View, op-ed, May 21) suffers
from a reductionism that treats class struggle, a
political-economic phenomenon, only as a political force.
Class struggle, while manifesting itself in various forms in
the political arena, is an economic mechanism as well. It
exhibits itself more ostensibly when the disparity of wealth
and poverty takes a more visible toll on people's lives. As
such, it has always existed in societies with economic
classes, whether democratic or nondemocratic, capitalist or
communist. The existence of numerous lobbying organizations
in this country -- representing consumers, unions,
professions, industries, ethnic and racial groups and so on
-- is the best example, though a confused one, of how this
process works in Western societies.
   The decline of communism as a political force in Eastern
Europe should not be interpreted as the end of class struggle
in those countries. The very opposition to the political
elites ruling these societies is a manifestation of this
struggle. To view class struggle as a mere tool in the hands
of those who are hungry for power is to underestimate one of
the major forces shaping human history.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Also, the fact that the Soviets were able to export
communism, in the name of class struggle, to Third World
countries had less to do with the appeal of this rhetoric to
"would-be-despots" than with the reality of economic
injustices perpetrated by powerful political and economic
elites, such as Batista, Somoza, Haile Selassie, etc. in
those societies.</p>

<p>As an expatriate Englishwoman I read Mr. Melloan's article
with a mixture of amusement and despair. Amusement at the
wonderful eccentricity of my race, and despair at that
growing faction of British society raised to believe that
hard work is not necessarily a prerequisite to achieving a
comfortable living.</p>
<p>Karl Marx, I am sure, would be appalled by that portion of
British society described by Mr. Melloan. "Workers of the
World Unite" meant just that, with the emphasis on workers;
and it meant fair and equitable return for a fair amount of
work. Those profiled in the article have in all probability
been unable to hold down any job and probably do not have any
desire to do so. By the same token, this type of person looks
with scorn upon others entrepreneurial enough to make a
financial success of their lives by working long, dedicated
hours.</p>
<p>British schools, while generally instilling a love of
academia, do not follow through and instill drive and
ambition to excel in business. Unfortunately, those children
born into working- and lower-middle-class families who do
have ambition usually have to remove themselves to North
America to succeed.</p>
