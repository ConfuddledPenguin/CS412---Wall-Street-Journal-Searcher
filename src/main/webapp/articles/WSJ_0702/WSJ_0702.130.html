	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON (AP) -- West Germany was the world's biggest
exporter during the first three months of 1990, recapturing
the lead from the U.S., the International Monetary Fund
reported.
   West Germany increased its exports to $99.8 billion, up
more than 18% from the year earlier. The U.S. increase of
almost 10% brought its total to $97.2 billion.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>In 1989, the U.S. regained first place with $364 billion
of exports compared with West Germany's $341 billion. West
Germany first forged ahead in 1986.</p>
<p>Experts say the economic unification of West Germany and
East Germany, which officially began yesterday, could put the
united Germany ahead of the U.S. as the world's biggest
exporter for years to come. The IMF didn't give any figures
for East Germany, which isn't among its 151 member countries.</p>
<p>Japan trailed in a distant third place with $274 billion
of exports for 1989 and $68 billion for this year's first
quarter.</p>
<p>The U.S. remained by far the world's biggest importer,
bringing in $125 billion in foreign-made goods in the first
quarter, up from $118 billion a year earlier. West Germany's
imports also increased, to $78 billion from $65 billion.</p>
<p>Japan, striving to reduce complaints about its big export
surplus, was the only one of the seven major industrial
countries to report a drop in exports for the quarter. Japan
still had a $12 billion surplus for the period, second only
to West Germany's.</p>
