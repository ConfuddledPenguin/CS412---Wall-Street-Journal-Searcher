	<p class="article-leader">ORLANDO, Fla. -- Bairnco Corp. said it expects to report a
"significant" second-quarter net loss, and the board, as
expected, slashed the quarterly dividend.
   Bairnco, which recently moved here from New York,
manufactures specialty laminates and adhesives, shielding
chambers to test electronic equipment for emissions, and
cutting products, including saws and choppers for butchers
and meatpackers.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>The expected net loss and dividend cut stem from losses in
the shielding unit and the general economic outlook, Bairnco
said. In the second quarter a year earlier, Bairnco earned
$3.2 million, or 30 cents a share, on $54.2 million of sales.</p>
<p>Bairnco also moved back the target date for spinning off
its Keene Corp. unit to shareholders. It now expects to spin
off the unit in July; it had hoped to complete the
transaction by June 30.</p>
<p>The dividend the company announced -- five cents, down
from 25 cents -- doesn't reflect the Keene unit, Bairnco
said. Keene's board will take dividend action after the
spinoff. The Bairnco dividend is payable July 20 to
shareholders of record July 13.</p>
<p>Bairnco faces litigation regarding Keene. Shareholders
have filed suit, charging Bairnco misled investors about
Keene's potential asbestos liability. For five years ending
in 1974, Keene had a unit that made some products containing
asbestos; in Bairnco's annual report this year, Bairnco
disclosed that the insurance that has covered Keene for
asbestos litigation may be in doubt.</p>
<p>In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday,
Bairnco shares fell 50 cents to $6.50.</p>
