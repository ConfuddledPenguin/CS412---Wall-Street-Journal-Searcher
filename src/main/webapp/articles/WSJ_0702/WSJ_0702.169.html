	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- A federal judge ruled that the U.S. can
prohibit Capital Cities/ABC Inc. from broadcasting the 1991
Pan American Games in Cuba under the federal Trading With the
Enemy Act.
   The Treasury Department had refused to allow the
broadcast, claiming that ABC's agreement to pay Cuba $6.5
million for exclusive rights to televise the event violated
the law. The Treasury Department told the network it would
allow the broadcast only if no substantial amount of money
was paid to Cuba.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>ABC sued the Treasury Department in federal court in
Manhattan in December, alleging that the prohibition violated
the network's freedom of speech and was an illegal attempt to
restrict news coverage.</p>
<p>CBS Inc. and General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting
Co. network filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting ABC.</p>
<p>Judge John Sprizzo, however, said the restrictions were
constitutional and dismissed ABC's lawsuit. He said that in
this case constitutional concerns about free speech were
outweighed by the executive branch's right to conduct foreign
policy.</p>
<p>A. Douglas Melamed, an attorney for ABC with Wilmer,
Cutler & Pickering in Washington, said, "While no decision
has been made, it is likely we'll appeal."</p>
<p>To win rights to broadcast the sports event, which is held
in a different member nation every four years, ABC agreed to
pay the Pan American Sports Organization $8.7 million, with
the understanding that 75% of the money would be passed on to
Cuba. The network said that the Treasury Department's
proposed alternatives, which called for paying only minimal
travel expenses in Cuba, were unacceptable to the Pan
American Sports Organization, which includes a group
representing the U.S.</p>
<p>The judge rejected arguments that the broadcast agreement
was protected by a 1988 law adopted by Congress to exempt
informational materials from trade embargoes. The judge said
the law's legislative history was too vague to determine
whether such agreements were protected, and he left it to the
agency to interpret the law.</p>
<p>Floyd Abrams, an attorney for CBS and NBC in their
friend-of-the-court brief, said the 1988 law was meant to
include such broadcasts, and Congress's intent in passing the
law will be an important issue if the case is appealed.</p>
<p>ABC also argued that the Treasury Department was
misapplying its own regulations because the restrictions
allow newsgathering activities to proceed without prior
approval. But Judge Sprizzo said the agency has the right to
decide whether the broadcast agreement fell under the
category of news gathering.</p>
<p>Mr. Abrams said he was also concerned about why the
Treasury Department would take a hard line against the
broadcast. "At a time of cooling rhetoric around the world
and a decrease in international tensions, it is difficult to
understand why First Amendment interests must be trumped by
Cold War ones," he said.</p>
