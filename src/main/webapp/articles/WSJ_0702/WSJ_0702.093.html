	<p class="article-leader">NEW YORK -- Despite a shrinking market share, Merrill
Lynch & Co. clung to the top of the global underwriting heap
in the first half as U.S. financing volume rebounded.
   Merrill's strengths in the corporate debt, convertible
debt and asset-backed securities markets helped propel it to
the top underwriting spot, a position it has held since early
1988.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>But the nation's largest securities firm was hurt by a
drop in its share of stock underwritings. It helped
underwrite 9.4% of all common stock issues, down from 13.9% a
year earlier, halving its total underwriting market-share
lead over Goldman, Sachs & Co.</p>
<p>"We should be a bigger factor" in equity issues, said
Jerome Kenney, president and chief executive officer of
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets. "But we're getting involved
earlier on, trying to determine which companies over the next
three years will consider {issuing} equity," he said.</p>
<p>Overall, the volume of stock and bond offerings in the
U.S. in the first half rose 13% to $163 billion. The rise was
triggered by a surge in new issues of mortgage and
asset-backed securities, which accounted for about 55% of all
money raised in the U.S.</p>
<p>But a slump in Eurobonds and international equities led to
a 6% decline in the volume of global stock and bond issues to
$252.6 billion, according to Securities Data Co. Merrill,
with an 11.4% share of the global marketplace, continued its
top ranking; second-place Goldman's market share stood at
9.5%.</p>
<p>Rising interest rates and the collapse of junk bonds sent
the U.S. corporate debt market into the skids. Corporations
issued just $54.1 billion of new bonds in the first half,
down 26% from a year earlier and the smallest amount of money
raised in this sector since the second half of 1985.
Investors apparently craved quality: triple-A, double-A and
single-A-rated bonds accounted for more than 70% of this
market's volume, Securities Data said.</p>
<p>For the first half, Merrill underwrote $26.3 billion of
domestic stock and bond issues, for a 16.1% market share,
according to Securities Data. Goldman, with its continued
dominance in equity underwriting, was close on Merrill's
heels, helping to raise $21.2 billion, for a 13% market
share. First Boston Corp., a unit of CS First Boston Inc.,
and Morgan Stanley & Co. each hold a 10.8% slice of the
market.</p>
<p>Because of a pullback by financial institutions in issuing
new stocks and bonds, Merrill and Goldman turned to
industrial issuers for about one-fifth of their financings.
In 1989's first half, financial firms, including commercial
banks and savings and loans, accounted for more than 25% of
Merrill's underwriting business; now that figure stands at
8%.</p>
<p>Merrill raised $13.6 billion in corporate debt issues, for
a 25.1% market share. Morgan Stanley was No. 2, by helping to
raise $12.5 billion.</p>
<p>Some securities executives expect the corporate debt
market to rebound in the second half. They point to a large
supply of debt maturing in the next six months set at very
high rates that have to be refunded.</p>
<p>"We're looking for a very sizable volume of
{corporate-debt} business for the Street in the second half,"
said Roger Vasey, senior vice president of Merrill's global
debt markets division.</p>
<p>Issuers of mortgage and asset-backed bonds found a more
receptive audience. This sector posted record first-half
volume, raising $89.8 billion, a 59% jump from 1989's first
half, Securities Data said.</p>
<p>One reason mortgage-bond underwriting has increased is
that investors skittish about taking big risks felt more
comfortable turning to these higher-quality bonds, securities
executives say. Bear, Stearns & Co., a unit of Bear Stearns
Cos., led all securities firms in mortgage-bond underwriting.</p>
<p>And issuers looking to get assets such as credit-card
receivables off their books hit it big. The volume of
asset-backed bonds more than doubled in the first half to
$19.2 billion. In the past two weeks alone, nearly $5 billion
of asset-backed bonds have been brought to market. For the
half, First Boston led all other firms, helping to raise $5
billion.</p>
<p>Stock issues sizzled. Boosted by near-record stock prices,
stock underwriting volume surged by 45% to $12.9 billion.
Reflecting the stock market's renewed strength, the number of
common stock offerings for the first half totaled 308, a 67%
jump from a year earlier. Goldman Sachs led in the stock
category, helping to raise $2.5 billion for a 19.1% market
share.</p>
<p>Issuers of initial public stock offerings didn't fare as
well. New offerings raised $7 billion, up from a moribund $6
billion a year ago. But IPOs on average outperformed the
market averages in the first half, gaining 14.5%, an
indication of momentum to come, Securities Data said.</p>
<p>Alex. Brown & Sons won top IPO honors, helping to raise
$1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, underwriting volume abroad continued to slump.
Turbulence in the Japanese stock market overshadowed
improving prospects in Europe, triggering a 28% drop in
Eurobond and international stock volume to $89.6 billion.
Eurobonds are debt securities sold by issuers outside their
home markets.</p>
<p>But Eurobonds denominated in European currency units
soared to a record $11.4 billion, an increase of more than $5
billion from a year earlier. Look for ECU-denominated
Eurobonds to play an increasingly bigger role in
international underwriting as Europe's 1992 economic unity
nears, industry executives say.</p>
