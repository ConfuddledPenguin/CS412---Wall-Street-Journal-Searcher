	<p class="article-leader">SAN ANTONIO, Texas -- Tesoro Petroleum Corp. said it will
pay the government of Trinidad and Tobago $2.8 million to
settle litigation related to a now-defunct oil exploration
and production venture.
   The Trinidad and Tobago government, in a lawsuit filed
last year, sought unspecified damages and the return of $350
million in profits it said were generated by the joint
venture. Trinidad-Tobago accused Tesoro of wire and mail
fraud, racketeering, bribery and violations of prostitution
laws.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>"Tesoro has always been confident it would prevail in a
trial . . . and still maintains that conviction," the
refining and marketing concern said. "Nonetheless, the
company has elected to settle on what it regards as very
favorable terms compared to the cost of extended litigation."</p>
<p>Officials of Trinidad-Tobago hailed the settlement as a
victory. Prime Minister A.N.R. Robinson said, "The case and
its settlement show that corruption is wrong and the people
of Trinidad and Tobago will tolerate it no longer."</p>
