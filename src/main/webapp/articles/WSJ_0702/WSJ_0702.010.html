	<p class="article-leader">TORONTO -- Holders of Dylex Ltd. approved the
authorization of a new class of convertible preferred shares
that could be used instead of cash to pay off 150 million
Canadian dollars (US$128.4 million) of debentures
outstanding.
   Holders of the 9.25% debentures can retract them at 110%
of their face value in 1992. The retailing company can ill
afford such a cash outlay. Dylex had losses of C$10.5 million
for the quarter ended May 5 and C$60.7 million for the fiscal
year ended Feb. 3. But the company has the option of
substituting the new securities for cash.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Wilfred Posluns, chairman and chief executive officer,
said Dylex nevertheless would like to avoid issuing the newly
authorized shares, because they could dilute the company's
widely held Class A nonvoting shares, into which the
preferred would be convertible.</p>
<p>He said Dylex might consider raising cash through the sale
of a division or real estate, share issues by a division, or
borrowing against real estate. But he said no specific plans
had been made for any of these measures.</p>
<p>In trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Dylex
Class A shares closed unchanged at C$3.95 (US$3.38).</p>
