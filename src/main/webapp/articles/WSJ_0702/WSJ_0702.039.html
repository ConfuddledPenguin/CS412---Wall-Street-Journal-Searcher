	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The White House is beginning to worry that
proposals to make the Western alliance more palatable to the
Kremlin and to the Western public are moving too fast.
   When the North Atlantic Treaty Organization meets in
London this week, talk of extensive change in the alliance
will be in the air, and President Bush will be cheerleading
for change. But behind the scenes, Mr. Bush is determined to
keep the process from turning into a reckless rush.</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>West Germany has floated a host of ideas to alter the
basic tenets of the alliance that has existed for more than
four decades. When NATO leaders meet in London, everything
will be open to change: defense strategy on the ground, the
positioning of nuclear weapons and the makeup of Western
military forces.</p>
<p>In addition, the U.S. is prepared to discuss with its
allies eventually withdrawing U.S. nuclear-tipped artillery
shells from West Germany unilaterally, the Washington Post
reported Sunday. Such a withdrawal would be designed to
counter Soviet calls for complete denuclearization of
Germany. The White House wouldn't confirm the report.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials fear the West may be hurrying into
other commitments that would cut troop levels in a united
Germany too deeply. They also are concerned that too much
loose talk of nuclear withdrawals will incite public clamor
to remove all short-range nuclear weapons from Germany before
agreements on such weapons can be negotiated with Moscow.</p>
<p>So the president and his men are saying the NATO meeting
merely should start the process of changing the alliance,
rather than complete the job. This is a tricky position for
the U.S. to take because it raises the risk of a clash with
West German leaders, who are eager to accommodate Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev so he will let the united Germany
belong to NATO. The Bush administration, which has been
working assiduously to develop a special relationship with
the emerging new Germany, doesn't want to alienate Germans
now.</p>
<p>The U.S. shares the general German goal; indeed, Mr. Bush
himself called the NATO summit to pave the way for a new
Germany's membership in the alliance. U.S. and German
officials already have agreed on broad outlines for how to
change NATO. Specifically, they have agreed in principle on
the idea of thinning NATO's front-line troops and putting
them under multinational commands rather than under
individual member countries.</p>
<p>The NATO meeting is likely to bless such a change, which
would fundamentally overhaul Western defense strategies and
set up a defense structure that could be shrunk as East-West
tensions ease. In addition, the NATO meeting will lay plans
to begin negotiations to shrink NATO's nuclear arsenal and
perhaps adopt language for a historic non-aggression
agreement between NATO and Warsaw Pact nation.</p>
<p>Yet the U.S. also wants to be sure that it doesn't
emasculate NATO, the one European organization in which the
U.S plays a dominant role. The U.S. sees a NATO with muscle
as essential to its hopes to retain political, economic and
military influence in the emerging Europe.</p>
<p>U.S. officials are worried about West Germany's new
willingness to promise the Soviets specific reductions in the
united German army as part of the conventional-arms agreement
now being negotiated in Vienna. While the U.S. and West
Germany, until recently, agreed that they should offer the
Soviets some general pledge to shrink the German army after
unification, they resisted negotiating the extent of the
reduction until the conventional-arms treaty is finished and
follow-up talks with the Soviets begin.</p>
<p>Now, U.S. officials say, Bonn is suggesting that a
specific pledge be made by inserting in the conventional-arms
pact a formula defining how many troops any Central European
country can maintain. U.S. officials don't want to commit the
West to a specific troop level before military planners have
calculated the size and configuration of the new NATO.</p>
<p>In addition, while the U.S. has promised to stop
modernizing NATO's arsenal of short-range nuclear missiles
and shells and to start negotiating cuts in the stockpile,
Mr. Bush and his aides want to squelch any talk that NATO
might scrap its policy of reserving the right to be the first
side to use nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>The U.S. considers the first-use option necessary to guard
against a conventional attack. More importantly, it worries
that a no-first-use pledge would help generate public
pressure to pull all nuclear weapons out of Germany without
waiting for an orderly negotiating process.</p>
<p>Britain and France, which don't want the public pressing
them to get rid of their own nuclear arsenals, share the U.S.
sentiment. So this week's meeting, Secretary of State James
Baker suggests, "will simply kick off a review" of how the
West will negotiate cuts in short-range nuclear arms.</p>
