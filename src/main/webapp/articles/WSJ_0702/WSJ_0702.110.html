	<p class="article-leader">CALTON Inc. (Freehold, N.J.) -- Standard & Poor's Corp.
said it lowered its rating on the $62 million of subordinated
debt of this home builder to triple-C-plus from
single-B-minus. The rating concern said its action reflects
Calton's diminished liquidity and financial flexibility. S&P
noted the recent weak New Jersey-Pennsylvania real estate
market and "excess supply" in the Florida market. Calton
probably won't return to 1986 and 1988 profitability levels
in the next two years, S&P said.</p>
