	<p class="article-leader">WASHINGTON -- The Democrats believe they may have found
the thinker who can plot their way out of the political
wilderness. He's the Republican theorist who helped evict
them from the White House more than two decades ago.
   Kevin Phillips, generally credited with coming up with
Richard Nixon's "emerging Republican majority" in 1968, is
being quoted by Democrats all over town and denounced by
Republicans as a "fraud" whose new book is "garbage."</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>Mr. Phillips, an owlish Republican political analyst, is
developing a cult following among Democrats, who believe his
critique of Reaganism and Republicanism may help them regain
control of the White House. "Kevin," says Democratic party
chairman Ronald Brown, "has crystallized a lot of things."</p>
<p>Mr. Phillips calls the Republican 1980s a decade of
excesses and binges. He accuses the GOP of becoming the party
of greed. And he blames Ronald Reagan and George Bush for
"the new political economics, intensifying inequality and
pain for the poor, the unprecedented growth of upper-bracket
wealth, the surprisingly related growth of the federal debt."</p>
<p>In a city whose cultural life seldom reaches beyond
newspaper clippings and television sound bites, Mr.
Phillips's "The Politics of Rich and Poor" (Random House, 263
pages., $19.95) is the rare book that roils the capital's
waters. Rep. David Obey, a leading Democratic voice on
economic issues, was so anguished when he left his copy on
his desk that he called his office and asked an aide to run
it over to him at National Airport so he could finish it on a
trip back to his Wisconsin district.</p>
<p>"This is not the Brookings Institution or Harvard saying
these things," observes Sen. John Breaux of Louisiana,
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
"It's coming from within the Republican Party."</p>
<p>The Phillips thesis is that in the Reagan years the rich
became richer; the income of the top 1% of Americans rose to
more than 11% of the nation's total income in 1988 from 9% in
1980. Meanwhile, large chunks of the nation's population were
on a slide of "downward mobility." The result, he says, is
more economic losers than winners, with a large number of
Americans "facing deteriorating personal or family incomes or
a vague but troubling sense of harder times ahead."</p>
<p>Mr. Phillips argues that the Reagan era represents the
third of what he calls "Republican heydays of wealth
concentration." He says that after the first two, the Gilded
Age that ran from the mid-1870s through the early 1890s and
the Republican ascendancy of the 1920s, came an economic
downturn and a populist reaction. He raises the question of
whether the U.S. is on the verge of a third burst of populism
and reform.</p>
<p>Mr. Phillips, whose book made the capital-area best-seller
list of the Washington Post only a week after it became
available, isn't discomfited by the praise it has received
from his erstwhile rivals. He believes his effort might be
worthwhile if the GOP "pays a lot more attention to the
average guy again."</p>
<p>For all their exultation over Mr. Phillips's argument,
some Democrats are troubled that this critique should emerge
from Mr. Phillips's word processor. "It is the sign of many
of the problems we have," says Democratic pollster Harrison
Hickman, "that it takes a Republican analyst to make our own
case."</p>
<p>Even so, many Democrats are pleased to have that case
aired in such a deliciously ironic fashion and to have new
attention on the contrast between what Mr. Phillips calls
"proliferating billionaires and the tens of millions who were
gradually sinking" in the 1980s.</p>
<p>"It's the kind of book you'd expect to be written by a
Democrat," Mr. Obey says.</p>
<p>That's precisely what a lot of Republicans are saying.</p>
<p>"I refuse to read that fraud's book," says John Buckley, a
Republican political consultant. "The man is a liberal
Democrat corporatist who despises entrepreneurship, Reaganism
and conservatism. Anyone who can deliver cornpone Marxism in
a Locust Valley lockjaw and get called a conservative is
pulling a swindle off on someone."</p>
<p>House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia believes
that Mr. Phillips, in focusing on the success of the wealthy
in the Reagan years, is suffering from a kind of political
astigmatism.</p>
<p>"Phillips is saying that people will be offended by a
party that allows a few big trees in the forest but also
protects your right to plant your own tree as an
entrepreneur," Mr. Gingrich says. "We're arguing that people
are more turned off by a party which promises to cut down the
biggest trees in the forest but to overregulate and overtax
you so you won't be able to plant your own tree."</p>
<p>Democrats who tread deeply into the pages of Mr.
Phillips's book will find little comfort, however. He argues
that Democratic leaders are responding to the GOP much as
their party forebears did to earlier Republican heydays:
"cowed, conformist and often supportive of the prevailing
entrepreneurial, free-market mood."</p>
<p>But such Democrats as House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri say that Mr. Phillips "understands what
the last 10 years have meant to working people." Democratic
pollster Celinda Lake believes that the Phillips book and the
contretemps that it has stirred may highlight what she calls
"fundamental fault lines in the Republican coalition." She
adds: "It's a whistle in Democratic ears, if only we'll
listen."</p>
<p>The bookish Mr. Phillips is an unlikely protagonist in the
first passionate ideological debate of the summer. A
49-year-old graduate of Colgate University and Harvard Law
School, Mr. Phillips was an adviser to Richard Nixon's 1968
presidential campaign. For the past two decades he has
published a political newsletter and now also publishes a
biweekly on business and public-affairs issues. He gives
speeches to corporate groups and provides political analysis
on television public-affairs shows. (He is also a member of
this newspaper's panel of political experts.)</p>
<p>In recent years, however, he has strayed widely from the
prevailing winds within the Republican Party, though always
clinging to the conservative label.</p>
<p>"I don't remember once at Heritage when Kevin Phillips's
ideas have come up as something significant," says Stuart
Butler, director of domestic policy for the conservative
think tank that buttressed much of the policy underpinning of
the Reagan revolution. "He just doesn't figure in deep
discussions about where the conservative movement is going."</p>
<p>White House aides curtly dismiss Mr. Phillips's book,
which carries only two promotional blurbs, one from Mr. Nixon
and the other from Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York.
But leading conservatives are enraged by it. Rep. Steve
Gunderson (R., Wis.) argues that Republicans "are broadening
our base much more than the Democrats are doing." Eddie Mahe,
a Republican political consultant, calls the book "garbage"
and adds: "Maybe he calculated that the best way to sell a
lot of books is to make a lot of outrageous statements."</p>
<p>Mr. Phillips is taking the criticism with equanimity. "I
was involved enough in the beginning of this Republican era
that I have combat medals," he says. "And I frankly don't
think much of some of the dynamics of the 1980s."</p>
