	<p class="article-leader">Swatch Says It's Time
   To Reach Older Crowd</p>
	<div class="article-body"><p>EVER SINCE SWATCH introduced its colorful watches in the
U.S. eight years ago, they've been a favorite of trendy
teens. Many people older than 16, however, found them simply
cheap and plastic.</p>
<p>Swatch is aiming to change that perception. The Swiss
company is rolling out new models to attract more grown-ups.
The company also plans to boost U.S. ad spending 25% next
year and announce in August a new ad agency for its
world-wide account, estimated at $35 million.</p>
<p>"They're moving into this decade with the knowledge that
they aren't a trend anymore, so they have to be brand," says
Nat Whitten, a principal at Weiss, Whitten Inc., Swatch's
interim U.S. ad agency.</p>
<p>The light-hearted watches virtually created a market for
fashion timepieces in the early '80s. But the U.S. boom came
just as Swatch's rapid global expansion caused product
shortages. U.S. sales peaked at five million units in 1986,
and totaled four million last year.</p>
<p>To get sales moving again, Swatch is introducing a $45
scuba watch, guaranteed to keep ticking at depths of 600
feet. Later this year, the company will launch a $75
chronograph watch, twice the price of a classic Swatch.</p>
<p>"We want to add upscale products, and respond to different
demands of the market," says Raymond Zeitoun, president of
SMH (US) Inc., Swatch's U.S. parent. The company has also
boosted world-wide production capacity 15%, to about 16
million watches annually.</p>
<p>Even those changes may not allow the company to double its
unit sales in the next few years -- Mr. Zeitoun's goal. The
U.S. market for inexpensive watches is flat, and competition
is fierce. "Companies make these kinds of changes during
tough times," says C. Michael Jacobi, vice president of
marketing at Timex Corp. "The watch industry is still
searching for what's next."</p>
<p>Egging On Consumers</p>
<p>To Eat Spam in the A.M.</p>
<p>IT MAY NOT SOUND like a breakfast of champions. But George
A. Hormel Co. of Austin, Minn., says plenty of aficionados of
its Spam brand of canned meat like to fry up a few slices to
eat with their eggs.</p>
<p>To encourage that habit, the company is rolling out Spam
Breakfast Strips, a refrigerated product that tastes like
Spam but looks like bacon. By putting the newly shaped Spam
near bacon in the refrigerator case, the company hopes
consumers will more readily see that Spam has 50% less fat
than bacon. A World War II staple, Spam still accounts for
about 75% of the $170 million market for canned lunch meats.</p>
<p>Other makers of breakfast meats are trying to rouse new
interest in their products, too. Swift Eckrich Inc., Downers
Grove, Ill., has begun selling in airports and convenience
stores a wiener-sized version of its Swift Premium Brown 'N
Serve sausage links.</p>
<p>Called Sausage Sensation, the pre-cooked product is
designed to be warmed on roller grills beside hot dogs and
eaten in a bun.</p>
<p>"The problem with any established brand is that people
don't see it anymore," says Patrick Riley, Swift's director
of marketing for breakfast meats. "You have to get people to
pay attention again."</p>
<p>Morning meats have been in a slump for years, with health
concerns turning off some consumers, and fast-food giants
like McDonald's stealing others. "You wouldn't want to
incorporate {Sausage Sensation} in your diet for health
reasons," says Mr. Riley. "It's just supposed to be fun."</p>
<p>Dessert Ex Machina:</p>
<p>A Marketing Miracle?</p>
<p>AT LAST, a snack machine that doesn't steal quarters.</p>
<p>Nabisco Brands is testing an automatic, in-store sampling
machine that dispenses free, tiny packages of new products to
shoppers who pull a lever.</p>
<p>The RJR Nabisco Inc. subsidiary is hoping the machines,
installed in 10 ShopRite grocery stores in New Jersey, will
be a more effective way to woo potential fans. Sampling is
usually accomplished by mailings, or with product
demonstrators. But most sampling programs last only a few
days, so Nabisco estimates they reach only about 15% of
shoppers. The machines can be restocked and left in stores
for weeks.</p>
<p>Developed by Econo-Pak Inc. of Sussex, N.J., the sample
machines cost about $600. Dispensing only every 30 seconds,
the machines are designed to discourage the greedy.</p>
<p>Sales of the crackers being sampled have more than doubled
in stores with machines, according to Allan Falvey, director
of consumer promotions at Nabisco. Coupons attached to the
samples are redeemed at about three times the rate of coupons
delivered through other avenues. "It works because it's
something different," Mr. Falvey says.</p>
<p>Don't expect stores to fill up with gizmos. Some sampling
specialists say such devices would be effective only for
names as familiar as Nabisco. And because the machines must
be restocked, they would be practical only for companies that
deliver their products to stores, rather than ship through
warehouses. "It's a gimmick," says an executive at a large
sampling company.</p>
<p>Odds and Ends</p>
<p>BLUE CONTINUES to be the top choice for ties, according to
a survey by retailer Tie Rack U.S. And red was voted the
color for "power ties" of the 1990s, pushing aside yellow. .
. . When it comes to that most unforgiving item of clothing
-- the bathing suit -- most women are playing it safe this
summer, according to NPD Group, a market research firm. Some
70% of suits sold so far this year have been one-piece
numbers.</p>
